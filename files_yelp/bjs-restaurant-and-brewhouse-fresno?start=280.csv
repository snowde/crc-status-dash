Jin M.,"Azusa, CA",0,96,,4.0,5/2/2013,"I was traveling through Fresno on business and decided to stop at BJ's for dinner.  I ordered a chicken caesar salad and my husband ordered the shrimp scampi.  The salad was the best I have ever tasted.  The dressing was very light and not fishy at all.  The chicken was perfect.  Tender, flavorful and moist.  My husband thoroughly enjoyed his scampi.  We also ordered peach sangria which was also delicious. The place was clean, we were seated quickly and the wait staff was very efficient and friendly.  A lone hair came clinging to the side of my husband's plate and when he pointed it out to the server he immediately notified the manager who came to our table and very apologetically stated that his meal was on the house.  We were very impressed with how serious they took our dining experience.  Bravo BJ's!  Next time we pass through Fresno, we will be back."
Kelly H.,"Fresno, CA",36,139,39,1.0,11/2/2009,"It bugs me when chains claim things like ""We take our food as seriously as we take our beer,"" and then they serve fries that were quite obviously frozen. That is not taking your food seriously. And the food is, at best, average for a chain. But what really bothers me is the way they hype their beers. I've tried most of their beers and have never really liked any of them. And it's not like I'm a Bud Light drinker who has never had any real beer. Quite the contrary, I love me some good craft beer. I just think their beers are overdone and over-hyped. I imagine that if they served any ""normal"" beer, theirs would never be ordered by anyone more than once. So if it's not great food, and I can't get a decent beer, there's really no reason to go back."
Cindy D.,"Camarillo, CA",102,18,2,4.0,11/25/2012,"Food was delicious - this is one of my favorite places to get pizza.  It's a little pricey, but the food is delicious.  We like BJ's favorite and tonight we had the stuffed mushrooms."
A F.,"Clovis, CA",0,5,,5.0,9/23/2014,"Coworkers and I are here once a week after work for a beer and happy hour apps. Food is always great, service wonderful, and pleasurable atmosphere. Highly recommend the avocado spring rolls."
Betsy L.,"Tulare, CA",35,113,15,4.0,9/28/2012,"I usually come here for one of two things: a baked potato or pizza. They have a HUGE variety of beers on tap, and the food is amazing! There is a wait on weekend nights, but not so bad mid-day."
Valerie H.,"Atascadero, CA",0,15,,3.0,9/16/2014,"Food is great as expected.....however, the music is so loud you can't hear the person across the table.  The people at the next table were having trouble hearing the waitress over the noise!"
Elly M.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,18,1,2.0,9/14/2014,"I have been to many bjs in different locations and I have always been happy with their consistency and service. However, this Fresno location was not up to par. Our server Danielle was slow and not attentive. Two out of our group ordered salads but when they arrived there was no dressing. When we asked for dressing when we got the salads Danielle told us to hold on because she has other tables. That was very rude. She then brought the rest of the table ranch dressing for pizza but the salad dressings we ordered were not there.  We sat and watched the rest of our group finish their meals while we waited for dressing. It was not my typical bjs experience."
Steve C.,"Fowler, CA",0,4,1,5.0,5/15/2012,"Very good service, food, beers and great deals ..busy on. Fridays"
LoLa L.,"Fresno, CA",2,61,,1.0,5/20/2013,"Worst service of my life! I thought it was a joke at first and people would jump out with cameras because this place is just awful!! Food wasn't good waiting over an hour and a half, And then we sat down the whole thing took three hours to get everything! Never never again!!!"
Charity K.,"Simi Valley, CA",69,148,17,4.0,9/19/2011,"I have eaten at this restaurant a few times due to different travels through Fresno. Overall my experiences have been fine. They are nothing to write home about. The food is standard BJ's fare (or is it fair - either way). I enjoy BJ's in general, so it is good. The service is never super quick, but I don't feel neglected either. This particular location always seems busy, but we have been lucky to get a table rather quickly when we have gone, and the food prices are reasonable. I had a mini pizza with a wheat crust, which was new for me. I enjoyed the wheat crust, but I think I like their traditional crust better. I don't have much to report here... But I would eat at this location again without hesitation."
Casey S.,"Burlington, WA",1,27,2,5.0,6/28/2012,I always get the best service whenever I come here. I have a serious addiction to there Parmesan Crusted Chicken! Add on a mojito and a pazooki and I'm a happy camper. Thank you for always being reliable!
Gary C.,"Fountain Valley, CA",305,107,32,1.0,12/29/2011,"Hair in your food, food taking over an hr to come and screwing up the order on a pizza, this is the worst BJ's I have ever been to........."
Sebastian L.,"Monterey, CA",135,30,13,5.0,5/29/2012,Great apitizers had gf eating all that wad on sampler and she does not try anything plus thier brew on taps are all good give me a blonde
Rhanier S.,"Carson, CA",57,28,1,4.0,7/8/2012,I love BJ's it's a bit busy especially at dinner but there service is pretty good and there portions are outstanding. The Pizza here is a must try.
Mallik K.,"San Jose, CA",59,84,59,5.0,5/25/2012,All day... I can stay there all day.. had wonderful memories here.... I love their beers and food aswell ...
Mark P.,"Temecula, CA",17,271,11,4.0,4/28/2012,"Good variety of food, but since I was on a business trip (dining alone) it made it tough.  They really cater more to larger parties, but the food was good, place was clean and service was ok.  I've been to better locations with better service."
Enrique T.,"Fresno, CA",0,2,12,1.0,11/16/2013,Don't let it fool you. This is not deep dish pizza. It's just expensive pizza with a thick crust.
Tan V.,"Fresno, CA",0,10,,1.0,8/1/2014,I go there for the beer. Heifenwieser beer to be exact and there sampler of beer. Good place to go hang out at the bar. Food is not as great as it looks. I thought it lacked a lot of flavor in many of the dishes. When I go there I only order appetizers because they usually are the best. The jambalaya is probably the best dish there. Everything else is either hit or miss. Wait time for food and seating is always long. The only good thing was last time we went they gave out free sampling of pizza for people waiting.
Christina M.,"Fresno, CA",150,9,7,5.0,7/12/2011,"Yummy food and great beer! We had the Chicken Lettuce Wraps, California Chicken Sandwich, Jeremiah Red and Nit-Wit seasonal. Wonderful experience!"
Kayci H.,"Fresno, CA",215,26,,3.0,12/30/2010,"Despite the average waiting, the experience I had with the waiters stick out through my mind. There were five of us. It was a friends birthday. It wasn't crowded- Busy, but not crowded. However after waiting 20 minutes alone...while our supposed ""Host"" or whover brings you drinks sat there and chatted near our table with a co-worker...I saw her other workers giving her disgruntled looks. Finally someone else took over...YAY?  Only actually no. Within another 15 minute wait for someone to take our order...we got switched to someone else...again. Much less patient and friendly. However The saving grace was the food. And portions were big enough even for the friend who I call the vaccuum to handle That was the saving grace, but I am afraid to approach the place again due to the server's lack of grace or work ethic."
