Brea T.,"Del Rio, CA",20,50,52,3.0,2/17/2012,Went late at night. Familiar with late night appetizer specials and they had none. Food was cold. Nothing special disappointing. BJ's in Modesto much better.
Nichole M.,"Clovis, CA",240,670,5,4.0,4/4/2009,"I'm a thin crust pizza girl. Always been, always will be sorry Chicago. However, BJ's did a damn, good job of trying to convert me! I had the buffalo chicken pizza. It had mildly hot chicken, finely chopped celery, onions with cheese. It was massive, and I ate a small by myself. And small is really a ridiculous way to categorize this size of pizza. You don't even need ranch on the side....because it's in the pizza too! mmmm.....nice fat boosting touch!"
Pedro F.,"Fresno, CA",0,29,,2.0,10/23/2011,"one of the only reasons i come here is because they're open pretty late during the weekend so its a late night hang out spot to get some food the service here is always sloooowwww and horrible the food takes FOREVER to come out i'd give them a 1 star if it wasnt for their santa fe spring rolls, jambalaya and their signature pizookies"
Anne B.,"San Luis Obispo, CA",158,41,2,1.0,2/9/2011,"I went here with 3 kids and two adults.  Our server was timid and unhelpful. My friend's kid ordered a cheeseburger. IT came out and it was RAW, not just rare, but RAW, mealy raw hanburger. My daughter's mac n cheese was so cold it had skin on it. My fries were cold, but my friends were searing hot.  I finally got our server over to ask them to cook his cheeseburger and I wanted to see the  manager.  The manager came over to explain that the burger was meant for someone who had ordered it raw....now really? Come on. IT took another 30 mins to get a replacement cheeseburger and by that time I was so fuming mad that it took so long, and our server did the whole ""avoid the mad customers thing"". The manager did nothing for us but take the cheeseburger off the bill.  We should have been comped the whole thing, and honestly the manager copped an attitude with me. It's not like I'm a manager of a restaurant myself and know how customers should be treated, oh wait....I am! But I guess a big corporate chain doesnt care about the average customer as all the sheep will continue to go drink their Wyders cider branded as BJ's cider...ugh...NEVER AGAIN will I go there."
Pete S.,"Fresno, CA",35,59,17,3.0,6/2/2011,"This place is always crowded when i go for dinner. I dont like that feeling or ambiance for dinner and its kind of hard not to feel it in this place. Most of the food is delicious like the Baked potatoes, the pizza, and pasta dishes but avoid the clam chowder at all costs, its very disappointing. The service isn't consistent, sometimes its good, we get refills quick, asked if we got everything or we need anything, and sometimes its bad, long waits for our order, condiments, refills, etc.  Probably due to some people being able to handle being busy or not which really sucks for the waiters. Free pizzoki for b days. YAY! but they made a smaller b day version now. Awww! Cool place, good for going with friends but, not the kind of place i would frequent only for personal preferences."
Daniel N.,"North Highlands, CA",182,234,25,4.0,12/22/2011,Excellent pizza! BBQ chicken and great white or custom built!
Trisha R.,"Fresno-High, CA",0,18,6,5.0,5/7/2012,"I love BJs. Always great service and great food. I had one bad experience in the past, we were seated and were forgotten, but the management were great and paid for our entire meal. Was very happy. That was maybe even a year and a half ago. I've been many times since and has been great. LOVE their Avocado Egg Rolls. The best! :)"
Veronica A.,"Fresno, CA",16,33,,4.0,5/26/2011,"I love the potatoes, avocado egg rolls, and pazookies but the curbside staff is awful"
Timothy O.,"San Diego, CA",136,576,,4.0,5/3/2009,"I'm not sure how I missed writing a review for this place on my continuing tour of the casual dining chains of Fresno. Friends from work used to like to come here often, possibly because the waitresses were usually cute Fresno State coeds. This is a large-ish free-standing restaurant at Fashion Fair Mall. The lunch crowd is busy most weekdays, so seating a large party can mean a wait. I like the personal deep-dish pizzas and the house-made root beer. The food is a cut above Applebee's, though the menu has a lot of the same items - sandwiches, fried appetizers, sliders, etc."
K. Kristin P.,"Oakland, CA",13,13,,4.0,5/13/2012,"I love this place. And so does everyone else. BJ's is usually pretty crowded, but I've always gotten my food quickly and it's delicious!"
Nieves R.,"Firebaugh, CA",17,13,,3.0,1/26/2012,"Waited 10 minutes for a server to acknowledge me,  but three of them walked by multipue times.  They could have at least said, ""we'll be right with you."""
Rachele Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,65,,4.0,12/9/2008,"Food is always great here. The service is usually horrible. The hostesses hate their job, and the waiters want you to get out quick.  Great for late night specials. Pizza's are 5 bucks after 11?"
Torn S.,"Visalia, CA",3,19,,4.0,10/24/2011,They have the best Blue Moon which they have on tap!! It taste so refreshing and smooth. Their wings are bomb as well! They also have good happy hour prices.
chris l.,"Sanger, CA",12,50,,4.0,10/11/2011,"This place has killer chicago style pizza's, baked potatoes, clam chowder, and beer. The Nutty Brewnette is their best beer imo."
Lisa M.,"San Lorenzo, CA",95,179,11,5.0,6/4/2011,"Went to BJ's again last night while in town again on business, this place is great, the food is so tasty, the service is outstanding, all for a pretty reasonable price.  The Italian salad is so full of stuff and so great, I'm not sure we'll ever want to try any other salad, deep dish pizza is so yummy and the beer is great too.  Thanks guys for another great experience!"
Mark G.,"New Lebanon, OH",7,72,2,4.0,8/18/2011,You know a place is good when you go there at 2pm and there is a wait - and it was worth it.  We got the nachos and pizza - both were REALLY good.  Strongly recommend the buffalo chicken pizza - can't beat it!
Lauren H.,"Robstown, TX",16,162,25,4.0,7/14/2010,"Too bad this is such a drive for us, or maybe it's a good thing.  Love the happy hour specials in the bar, but apparently, so does everyone else!  We went last night expecting to sit in the bar, but to no avail...it was packed!  So we waited, and waited, and finally gave up to be seated elsewhere.   The service here is almost always excellent.  Which is why I thought it was weird that our server last night warned us that he might not pay attention too well since he would be serving the HUGE party next to us, so just flag him down if we need something...uh, no...that's not really how that works...but he was ok I guess.  I haven't had anything there that I didn't like, except for maybe the chili, but I'm from Texas, so maybe I just have a higher standard  :) Right now, the Tuscan Tomato Bisque is at the top of my list, along with the Buffalo Chicken Pizza, oh and the calamari!  Yum!   The beer is good, just drink it fast while it's cold, and go ahead and get the pitcher.  They are cool about bringing you little dabs of things to try if you aren't sure about your order.   I could eat here daily, IF only it were closer, but then again, IF my aunt had nuts, she'd be my uncle :)"
Krystle W.,"Fowler, CA",13,19,,5.0,8/12/2011,I cant stop ordering the parmesan crusted chicken so yummy. They are not stingy with their food here. Ahi tuna appetizer is good but small. Clam chowder is really good with big chunks of clams. Their deep dish pizzas are also fantastic. I LOVE thier beignet and would rather have it instead of the pazookie but thats just me.
james s.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,14,,1.0,4/15/2014,"We had dinner there last night.  With tax and tip, it came to over $90.  I'm only stating that to give some perspective.  My friend ordered the beer tasting flight of 4 different beers.  He took a taste of one of them (BJ's own brew).  He didn't like it and asked to have it replaced with another one.  He was told that BJ's won't do that by the server.  This is very annoying.  One of the expectations of a restaurant patron is that if you don't like what you are served, you get a replacement.  I asked for the manager, who came and squatted down beside us (yes, she squatted, not stood).  Her response was they would lose too much money if patrons were allowed to send back drinks they didn't like.  I told her I thought that was very poor business practice.  Telling a patron that cost was more important than satisfying a customer.  She shrugged and said she'd let upper management know, and apologized.  Now about the bill perspective.  The flight comes with four 5-ounce pours.  You can buy an individual 5-ounce pour for $1.95, which means that the cost of the beer is no more than 65 cents.  It is not worth 65 cents to BJ's to satisfy a customer?  That's less than1 percent of the tab.  Also, after telling us that BJ's wouldn't take substitute the beer, the server asks us if we want desert or more drinks.  I know that's her job, but is she kidding?  Does she really think we want to give BJ's any more business when they won't replace a 5-ounce beer?  The irony is that if we had ordered anything else, BJ's would have more than made up the 65 cents they would have lost by replacing the beer.  The Cheesecake Factory is just a short walk across the parking lot, and the Yard House is a short drive up the road.  They both treat their patrons better, so that's where I will be going in the future, not BJ's."
Willyelpforfood K.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,145,18,5.0,4/17/2011,Always a great fun busy atmosphere! Nice staff always prompt with refills and checking to make sure we have an enjoyable meal. Pizookies are a must as is their pizza! Top shelf margaritas hit the spot also!!
