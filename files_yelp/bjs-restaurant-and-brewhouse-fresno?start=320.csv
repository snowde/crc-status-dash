Brian M.,"Rocklin, CA",49,69,2,1.0,12/4/2011,"Won't try them again....20 mins before closing and we were told they can not serve us.  It's the principle they didn't try to offer anything or were not polite about it at all.  Next Spot Buffalo Bills Wings or whatever and they did serve us after the closing time and great service under $20bucks.  Good spot, great food!"
Stanley S.,"Clovis, CA",330,62,28,5.0,6/22/2011,Had the Jimbayala and it was delicious. They also do a wonderful job with their Cajun Chicken.  I have not been dissapointed with the food. Depending on who you get to serve you will determine how good of service you get.
Lindsay M.,"Fresno, CA",0,13,,4.0,8/5/2010,"I made my first visit here a few weeks back. Silly me, I did not try any beer but I'll fix that next time. Our waitress did a great job and the girl who brought our menus had me rolling with laughter about her ""nutrition info is evil so order beer instead"" spiel. The food was decent, but not memorable. Definitely a place to take a large group or family since it's all sort of middle of the road fare. I'm definitely more prone to visit a local, independent joint, but wouldn't hesitate to come back if a friend wanted to eat there."
mary v.,"San Francisco, CA",84,83,18,2.0,1/15/2011,"Arrived and self-seated at the bar area during happy hour (3pm). Not crowded. probably about 6 or 7 occupied tables. After 10 minutes of waiting, no one helped us. So, we went to the bartender and asked for a menu. After another 10 minutes, we even moved tables w/in the bar area and still no one helped us. Finally, a waiter came close enough for us to flag down. We ordered pasta, calamari, a beer, and a cocktail. 20 minutes later, calamari came out. 45 minutes into our arrival BJs, we asked when we'd get our drinks. The waiter was like..""what did you order?"" Horrible service."
Mike S.,"Greenville, SC",283,471,74,4.0,12/21/2007,"I was out on a business trip and looking for a good sit-down place to eat with my colleagues instead of the Sizzler (yuck!).   We came across BJ's Restaurant and Brewery. Now the word brewery always catches my attention.  I tried a few lagers and an IPA and they were phenomenal! The chicken sandwich was great pub food and the desserts were mmmm mmmmm delicious. The staff was very friendly. Another pleasant surprise in sunny Fresno, CA! I bought a pint glass from the waitress at the bar instead of snatching one. It was a nice souvenir to bring back home.  BJ's brewery, I miss your beer..come to Boston please!"
Ivy N.,"Fresno, CA",122,52,57,3.0,11/7/2012,"i usually go here during lunch hour specials. i've tried pretty much most items on the menu. i really like the avocado egg rolls, the huge baked potato, ribs, and clam chowder. i'm not much into this spot as much as before because of its standard choices of food which don't really give me the Wow factor anymore. good place for a family outing because the kids menu has cute little smiley face fried potato things."
Monika L.,"Oakhurst, CA",0,7,,3.0,9/1/2013,"I'm not a huge fan of chains, but for a chain the food is pretty decent. Their root beer is awesome and, on a hot Fresno day, just that is worth it.  Wonderfully hand crafted root beer and sodas.  Paired with a pizza a decent lunch that makes a visit to the mall much better."
Hylary L.,"Morgan Hill, CA",175,334,4,4.0,9/12/2010,"I had a really good experience at this BJ's. I've been to BJ's before in San Jose, but actually preferred this location. The layout of the restaurant seemed much better and open. Anyway, BJ's has a lot of things about it that I like. The first thing that I mention only because it's a recent development for me is their gluten free thin-crust pizza. Hurray! Very yummy and inexpensive! BJ's also has many tasty drinks, but my favorite thing, which sadly contains gluten, thus I cannot eat it, is their pizookie. Think of the most delicious thing you've ever tasted, heated up with ice cream on top. SO....GOOD!!! I could eat those pizookies all day...*sigh* Anyway, this BJ's is a good one. If I lived in the area I'd probably go here frequently."
April A.,"Kerman, CA",2,2,,5.0,2/21/2013,"I love love love this place! I've never been let down here before. The food is great, well priced and comes out quick. The atmosphere is nice and the place looks great with the long bar, brick walls, and high ceilings. The staff is always very friendly and accommodating!"
Laura Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",150,248,1,3.0,12/3/2007,"I was here for work.  Amanda got girly drinks.  I stayed sober to maintain accuracy.  Three 30-somethings in short-sleeved button-downs come over.  One of them has very plucked eyebrows and giant forearms.  They are all pilots.  Amanda tells them she is an equestrian; I tell them my name is Siobhan, and they believe us.  One of them tries to share a barstool with me; I noodge him off.  About that time, about twenty of our coworkers walk in, and we grab our salads and hide in the middle of the group.  I never finish my food because they've drowned my lettuce in at least a half gallon of Bleu Cheese."
Alissa P.,"Torrance, CA",0,14,,4.0,7/13/2013,Thank goodness for BJ's! We ate there Monday night after failing to find an open restaurant in Fresno. Service was great and the food was good. Definitely a step up from a TGIFridays or Applebees. We'd eat there again!
Rakayla M.,"Madera, CA",1,58,4,5.0,6/15/2010,"Chicago pizza is soo good! Beers and root beerareall brewed and are really good! If u r looking for somewhere relaxed and laid back to eator watch the game, here it is!"
Jerry M.,"Fresno, CA",49,157,27,4.0,3/24/2008,"I have been to this place several times...and I will say, it is very consistent. It never ceases to amaze me how franchises can vary from city to city. They do it really well here. Not fine dining, but it's better than your run of the mill bar and grill (Friday's, Chili's, etc.) Be forewarned on their Tatonka Stout...I was expecting Guinness and got a mouth full of insanely sweet beer. I mean, it was way too sweet for my liking. Other than that...it's all good."
Will K.,"Fresno-High, CA",0,3,,4.0,4/27/2009,"My wife and I have eaten here several times and they never disappoint! We always know that we can go and count on great food and great beer every time!  Our friends were in town this past Saturday night and we decided on BJ's because they had never been before and were in the mood for beer.  Once again BJ's did not disappoint, the BBQ Chicken Pizza was awesome as usual, the new spinach artichoke pizza was oh so yummy and the beer, well I can't decide which one I like better the Jeremiah Red or the Nutty Burnett (I am partial to those since I am married to one, lol).  Our friends were not disappointed as well. If you are looking for a great place to enjoy some beers and pizza with friends, BJ's is where it is at!"
Lina S.,"Fresno, CA",88,75,13,3.0,3/29/2012,food is consistently good but typical. i really enjoy the jambalaya and the pazooki's. the service is always pretty good. what i dont like about BJ's is how they handle large prtis. they always make them wait until the whole party is there and then 15 minute after that. then they wait like 30 minutes to actually put in the order. at the end they only split the check three ways. how lame is that???
Chuy H.,"Fresno, CA",41,24,12,5.0,8/6/2010,"I love this place. Their beer is pretty damn good! I love their pizza, and I'm not one of those guys that cry bcuz it's not exactly like the original(if that was the case I'd cry about every single taco place in Fresno compared to Mexico). This is the closest to Chicago style pizza we'll get in Fresno. My only complaint was that the waiter couldn't split the check, but other than that I love it!"
Jim T.,"Fresno, CA",136,90,1,1.0,8/31/2011,"Why do I go here.  I've been here a couple of times, never by my choice. The service ALWAYS sucks. It takes 15 minutes to get a drink (if I'm lucky), and that's just water. My food order is always wrong. Hey, here is an idea, write the order down.  Why are you shocked that I left you .50 cents for a tip?  I couldn't tell you about the food because by the time it gets here I'm so pissed off, and I just want to get out of the place.   I wish there was someplace better nearby.  I miss Rockbottom, that place was the best."
Scott U.,"Hanford, CA",3,67,9,4.0,3/29/2010,"This is the place to go for the seriously delicious and inexpensive lunch specials.  My personal favorite is the unlimited soup an salad special for about $6.99.  I love the Tuscan Tomato Bisque.  The salads are hearty, and the waitresses are quick to keep the customer reloaded, if necessary.  One serving of each fills me just fine.  I've also enjoyed the lunch sized specialty salad, half of a giant stuffed potato and soup or salad, and the half sandwich and soup or salad.  The lunch menu has an excellent selection, and you can sit, eat, and be served in less than an hour."
Cindy H.,"Hanford, CA",1,3,,5.0,1/2/2011,I love this place I am a fan of the mini beef tacos and the teriyaki chicken is the best. The place is great.
Nicole E.,"Los Angeles, CA",89,215,60,4.0,10/22/2007,"I really like BJ's. They have a great variety of food their beers are great and the service is usually friendly and on point.  I wasn't really sure what Fresno would have to offer, but I was pleasantly surprised. My favorite: the blackened chicken potato, it comes w/alfredo sauce - omg! it should be illegal!  I also got my favorite blue cheese wedge salad and a hefe. I'm going to be here for 30 nights, I think I'll be coming back to BJ's for about 25 of them."
