Robert D.,"Fresno, CA",6,58,3,5.0,8/5/2010,"Since BJs came to Fresno I have been a happy man as well as guests that I have brought here. The service is great, love the servers! The food, everything I have tried so far, and I have a long way to go on their VAST menu choices, is simply amazing. If you get the chance...try and do a lunch order online. It WILL be ready for when YOU want to pick it up. AWESOME!"
Gabe H.,"Fresno, CA",3,17,,3.0,7/29/2010,"The best thing here is the beer. The food sucks. Last time I went, it took forever for my food to come out. Plus, there was hair on it! But i got to admit that the beer was good."
Scott D.,"Creston, CA",1588,650,1446,4.0,11/23/2008,"We ate here on our way home from a road trip. It was lunch hour and there was a little wait but they had flat screen tv's every where and a bar. It's a Chicago style eatery & menu. They have the best pizza anywhere, and we had the sliders, onion rings and spagetti. The service was good, the food great and the A/C cold."
Victoria B.,"Turlock, CA",7,121,9,4.0,2/24/2009,"This BJ's compared to the one in Modesto IS better. We had our engagement party here and it was a good experience. The wait staff was polite, food was good and we didn't have to wait long."
Sheila C.,"Fresno, CA",388,361,,4.0,12/27/2008,"Hey this place is pretty good. Nothing to write home about but definitely a place you can take your friends to have good food, drinks and an overall good time. I come here quite a bit. Dinner is sometimes a little full but hey you can call ahead is what I hear I have never waited longer then 15 minutes for a table though. Its not that expensive and I have tried a lot off of their menu and have to say I have never been disappointed."
Anna H.,"New Fairfield, CT",8,34,,3.0,1/18/2011,"This was okay. Not the best, but it was okay. It reminded me of your typical chain restaurant. The pizza really wasn't that good that I had. The atmosphere was nice. It would be a great place to take some friends for drinks."
Ed M.,"Merced, CA",42,95,12,2.0,12/24/2007,"HOLD IT ONE SECOND. They claim ""chicago"" style pizza on the logo....AND I AM FROM CHICAGO...so i should know. First of all, i never heard of this place in chicago. (i just checked the website too, there is no location there) Second i don't consider the pizza ""chicago"" style at all.  Don't get me wrong, the pizza was great and all...but really...this isn't what i call chicago style. sorry, we take pride in our deep dish pizza."
Misty V.,"Clovis, CA",98,191,12,2.0,3/11/2011,"Wow, what happened to this place?  Remember when they used to have the free bruschetta for filling out there survey online?  That bruschetta was worth going for on a weekly basis.  Remember their delicious chicken caesar sandwiches?  Oh the ciabatta roll was so good.  Oh those were the days.  After a pretty long hiatus, we decided we wanted something different and went here early on a Friday night.  Luckily, we beat the crowd and did not have to wait but parking was a pain.  Waitress was a little slow upon greeting us but I had been playing with my son so I barely noticed.  The place was loud so that made my son louder and I was having to yell just to be heard.  Food finally came and everything tasted great.  However, we never saw our waitress again.  She never brought my husband's requested honey mustard, nor did she ever check on us again so that he could remind her.  Finally after our meal was over, and our drinks had been empty for some time, she comes over and asks hubby if he wants a refill of....what was it?  oh yes, iced tea.  Refills his tea, brings our check and asks if we want any boxes.  We glance down at a few tossed fries and my sons prechewed hamburger pieces and decline.  Only THEN does she ask if I would like a refill.  After getting our refill and waiting an eternally long time to get our card processed, we finally get to leave.  Over an hour later than we arrived.  $36 and an hour later, we decided we probably won't be back.  For dinners over $30, we have an excessive amount of much better options so it strikes me as odd that BJs wouldn't try to be better."
Vinnie S.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,34,,3.0,5/19/2011,"Went last night. Good atmosphere, but they were out of two entree items I picked. Waitress was not friendly. Finally got a calzone, which was actually good. Still, very difficult to find anything not over a gazillion calories."
T G.,"Redlands, CA",89,219,28,3.0,8/17/2008,"Always consistent.  For dinner, generally a wait, but they do allow call-ahead for their list, so definitely take advantage of this. They have awesome LUNCH SPECIALS.  Salad, 1/2 sandwich, fries, tax, tip and drink for $10!  Many other lunch-sized portions available for cheap. Service is always good and consistent.  Good not excellent, but at least consistent. Only gripe, there's always a wait to get seated, but then there's open tables because they never seem to have enough wait staff on."
Patrick T.,"Clovis, CA",109,65,20,3.0,3/8/2008,"I'm not a big  drinker, but I understand the brew is good.  I personally always get the root beer and that definitely is brewed also.  I love it.  The food is decent and most people order the pizza's there.  The thing about their pizzas is that all of them are made with that very thick pan crust.  So if you are a carb lover this may be up your alley, but for me I love thin crust.  But the pizza is still good.  It is pricey, but I do go there once in a great while because it is a great place to meet friends and socialize."
Katie A.,"Fresno, CA",0,10,,2.0,10/8/2012,"I was turned onto BJs by the promise of a giant cookie served with a scoop of icecream on the top. I had no issues with the one I went to in the bay area. I thought I'd try it here in Fresno. No...nothing to compare. The home made cream soda was nothing to cheer about but my fiance liked the rootbeer floats. I ordered the fish and chips and was surprised when I received three oily battered fish on my plate. The fish was so coated in oil that I had to use my napkin to get some of it off. This also mutilated the taste of the fish. I couldn't even finish it. We asked the waiter about the pizookie which was what we specifically went there for. We opted for the macadamia nut and were brought out a cookie that tasted like dough. It was not fully cooked at all. Very unsatisfying. Gets two stars for the waiter, he was actually really perky and nice but if you want grease, butter yourself up in lard and not pay 12.95 for the fish and chips!"
Jehan S.,"Austin, TX",1,10,,2.0,3/20/2010,"Ok so I have been going to BJ's for years, since they opened actually. I normally experienced good service there but as of lately things have not been so great. Sometimes I will go there for lunch or dinner and sit in the bar area instead of waiting to be seated. Whenever i do this the waitress seems to be the same girl and she is very rude. She seems to get upset because me and who ever I am with usually do not order alcohol. After we order regular drinks the service gets crappy. After our food is brought out she never checks on us or refills our drinks. I normally do not get upset out not being checked on often but this girl is just a crappy server. My gf that was with me is a server at another local eatery and she even says this girl sucks. Finally we complained a got a free pazookie but I was hoping this girl could be taught a lesson by mgt.  Then about a week ago I order food to go around 9PM. When I walked in I went to the counter where you pick up to go orders. Then the guy at the register says oh are u looking for to go? I say yes and he says it is at the bar. This guy was also on the phone while he was talking to me. I have no problem waiting until you are done, because it comes off as rude. I guess after a certain time the to go orders must be picked up at the bar. This is a very bad idea. I cannot stand the smell of alcohol and I waited to be helped more than 5 minutes. Then the bar tender tried to be funny and made a stupid joke about my name. Seriously can I just have my food now. I just wanted my food and good  service but didn't get either one. I don't know if I want to go back to BJs after so many bad experiences. Ive had many of my bday dinners there and have spent a lot of money... totally not worth it."
Big Appetite K.,"San Jose, CA",29,123,,3.0,2/25/2008,"I'm not a drinker, so this place probably doesn't garner the most accurate rating as it should... But, as far as the food, this place is like any typical brewery/sports bar stuff you'll find. A variety of steaks, chops, seafood, pasta and salads are available, and if you like beer... this is a decent place. Most of the reasons for the so-so rating was due to the crowd. It was the typical bar-like crowd - obnoxious frat boys from Fresno State and some business types, gawking at the chicks and making it pretty obvious that they wanted to be noticed... Well, I wish the number of women in the place was higher, but maybe it was just a bad night that I happened to go there... I'll give it another shot when I'm in the area again..."
mango b.,"Fresno, CA",0,25,,4.0,7/3/2010,"Fast, friendly, and good. Try the avocado rolls; its going to blow your mind."
N S.,"Fresno, CA",1,29,2,5.0,10/30/2009,"Very good food (especially for a chain).  Also, always has outstanding service.  The wait can be long but you can call ahead and put your name on the wait list. If  you are going to support a chain then this is a good one."
Rose C.,"Clovis, CA",0,6,,4.0,10/26/2009,"Good pizza and bar food. I am not a big fan of their beer, so I'm glad they have other beers available. Quick and friendly service.  You have to try Pizookie if you go here."
L L.,"Clovis, CA",1,23,,3.0,5/16/2011,"good but not great. i like how big their portions are, but i dont really crave their food. the only time i go there is when it is someones birthday. and i also wish their lighting wasn't so dim, i felt like i was going blind."
