Sergio V.,"Clovis, CA",0,12,,1.0,9/25/2017,This place always gets my order wrong and takes forever for the food to arrive.. I always just end up eating the food because I waited over 45 minutes for the wrong thing and don't want to wait any long. Service sucks.. You have been warned.
Don B.,"Waterford, PA",2,32,,4.0,6/11/2017,"Haven't been here for 2 years. Service & food still top notch! The jambalaya is soooo good! Love the Nutty Brewnette,one of my fave beers. We plan on several visits while in California. Miss this place a lot!"
Rick C.,"Fresno, CA",157,80,9,5.0,6/28/2016,Lot of positives about this place! They are open late and have great happy hour specials. Their menu has a ton of different items but I always seem to get the deep dish pizzas. It is spacious inside with a ton of seating. Their beer selection is top notch too. A lot of good ipa's available as well as BJ's own selection of brews. Sometimes this place is super busy but the servers and workers are always nice. Check it out if in the area or after you are done shopping at the mall
Baze B.,"Clovis, CA",26,97,75,3.0,7/7/2016,"Great selection of craft brews and full menu to suit any taste one may have. I like their calamari and pizzas and for you beer lovers go with their home brews, I chose the IPA. Nice laid back but fancy place and seems to get a fun crowd too, right near fashion fair so you can combine it to make it a shopping trip too."
Russell E.,"Tacoma, WA",1,13,1,1.0,2/1/2017,"Ordered curbside. Arrived and someone had parked there and left their car. Called inside, they had no alternative solutions. They put me on hold while I drove in circles and eventually they hung up on me. Called back and was immediately put on hold again. Ten minutes later the curbside person returned to their car. I parked and called the number and was promptly put on hold again. Ridiculous, never coming back."
Suzy O.,"Visalia, CA",0,79,16,1.0,5/5/2017,"I really used to like coming here. After tonight, we'll probably never come back. To begin - they say us at the bottom of the kitchen delivery ramp, right next to the emergency exit (when there were clearly booths and tables available elsewhere in the restaurant). My pizza arrived cold, my son's food arrived cold and his ribs were ""scaly"" (super weird), husband's order arrived incorrect. The only thing decent about the whole meal was my wedge salad - it's kind of hard to screw up a 1/4 wedge of iceberg lettuce. Well -- except for the fact that I was expected to eat it with my fingers as we were not provided with silverware."
Aaron E.,"Orange County, CA",94,1429,2127,2.0,11/23/2014,"BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse: because you are in Fresno and have to eat something. On my second evening in lovely Fresno, CA I found myself at BJ's because the lines at The Cheesecake Factory made the iPhone 6 debut look calm. Again, I failed to find many places to eat in the Central Valley my fellow Yelper. Something I hope to rectify on my next trip. All of that said, my table was clean, the service was on point and the prices are reasonable. They offer a bevy of different options, I chose the Buffalo Chicken Pizza. I know, my bad. This pie is all dough and no go. Dry and wood-tasting chicken breast marinated is combined with diced celery, red onions and a sloppy drizzle of ranch dressing and buffalo sauce and that is the good part. The bad part is the 3/4 inch of too soft, almost mealy, doughy crust these guys have going on. If this is an attempt at Chi-Town pie, BJ needs to actually go to Chicago some day. The Cubbies win more that BJ's Pizza's do.  Bleh."
Bill L.,"Fresno, CA",6,22,14,3.0,9/25/2016,Normally I'd give BJ's a five but this night I ordered a brisket burger (on sourdough) and there was almost no brisket. Service very good and the hamburger was great but the absence of much brisket was a downer.   I'll post a picture of the inside of the sandwich if I can.
David M.,"Pasadena, CA",1,5,,1.0,12/21/2016,"I had to come back to the review... why? Because a day after my horrendous experience with BJ's, every single member of my party received food poisoning. Each one of them. BJ's infected 100% of my friends and family with a disease. How in the world is that even possible. Just sickening... supposed to be a restaurant, not a place where they use their customers to trial chemical warfare in their food."
Niko W.,"Fresno, CA",0,5,2,1.0,5/14/2017,"This place is garbage.  Worst service we've ever experienced ever, seriously.  Literally still waiting for one of our meals, everyone else at the table is done eating. The food is barely mediocre."
Debbie M.,"Visalia, CA",0,32,,1.0,3/18/2017,"Beware! They tell you they will text you when your table is ready, but they don't then skip over you. Their excuse was ""something must've gone wrong"". Yeah, you didn't text me! Then 45 minutes for food to come which means one and a half hours to eat! I've also noticed a great deal of servers taking food back to the kitchen. Not good!"
Eugenia R.,"Long Beach, CA",16,12,3,2.0,6/9/2016,"Was here celebrating 2 birthdays! We had to wait 15 minutes for our drinks. We went ahead and ordered when we got the drinks so we didn't have to wait any longer. Food arrival wasn't to bad. I ordered the sirloin at a medium. It was rare!!! By the time I got a re-fired  everyone at the table was done with their dinner and dessert!!! I was charged full price for our dinner.  If the rating was only based on my meal it would be less than a 1, but since there were several of us I'm giving it a 2. Manager asked me to contact him but with an invalid email."
Madeleine G.,"Kerman, CA",0,4,7,5.0,9/4/2016,"I'm giving this place a 5 star for their fast service, the food was great in quantity and quality, and because our waiter was the best! My girls and I had a fantastic time at BJ's and that's all thanks to our waiter Tim Koppi. He made the experience so much better. He gave us an exceptional service, he was fast, helpful in choosing from the menu, and was very funny as well. I will definitely come back again!"
Lindsey M.,"Flushing, NY",39,262,,3.0,1/6/2017,"Two stars for the food, but 4 stars for the beer and frozen strawberry margaritas! I would only go to BJ's for happy hour and maybe appetizers, but not for a full dinner."
Tina M.,"Bakersfield, CA",1,54,54,3.0,7/19/2017,"i'm in Fresno visiting my friend and we decided to go here for a late dinner and drinks.  It was pretty busy when we got there around 10:30 ish...our waiter was nice but seemed like he was new, he wasn't too knowledgeable about the drinks etc.  we ordered the crispy fried artichokes for an appetizer, he got an Alabama sunrise i believe and i got a frozen strawberry something lol..his was good but from my perspective very weak, mine was good too but tasted more like a smoothie with a splash of alcohol not worth all the calories that's for sure.  We ordered another Alabama drink with an extra shot of rum but it tasted the same lol...we ordered the lemon thyme chicken and shared it for dinner...it was just mk nothing special i personally wouldn't order it again.  We then decided to get the cookies and cream pazooki...OK that was super yummy!!! Tasted like a hot, gooey insane oreo cookie!!! like i said service was hit and miss not a bad experience but nothing that would make me just want to go back."
Tyler T.,"Reedley, CA",201,172,304,2.0,9/4/2014,"My first time here I ordered the most expensive steak hoping it would be the best steak I've had in a long time. It was late and they had dimmed the lights. While bringing my steak up to my mouth I felt something hit my nose and my chin at the same time. It was one heck of a long hair. Long story short, the manager came and apologized and gave me a full refund for my meal and gave me a gift card for the amount of our dinner had it been included. Tonight is my opportunity to see BJ's shine! Our initial interaction was great. No problems! My daughter dropped one of her books and it was swiftly picked up by a passing waiter. Classy.  Our avocado roll was amazing. As was my Caesar salad.  For my main course I ordered baby back ribs. They were a little dry and a little tough. But they passed as really good with the BBQ sauce! As I neared the end of the rack I flipped it over and saw the corner of a meat pad (from the store to collect pooled blood) hangin out under my food!  Holy Cow! This was BJ's opportunity to fix the problem in the back kitchen! Our poor waiter and the manager have to deal with the brunt of the issue, while the cooks continue presenting unacceptable meals. At least in my case. I'm all for updating reviews for fixed issues, but BJ's is goin in the list of unsanitary places I don't want to eat at.  The manager was awesome in handling the situation, as was the waiter. I really do feel bad for them because these mistakes are coming from the kitchen."
Ar B.,"Saint Johns, FL",0,20,,2.0,7/25/2017,"Food had no taste, even after I put a ton of salt.  I pretended to take it home since I had so much left over but I had to throw it away.  Even my pizookie was just okay.  Our server was nice."
Debbie N.,"Turlock, CA",61,1,,1.0,7/30/2017,"Have always enjoyed coming here for different events- parties, gatherings etc. that changed today. I am not sure if there was a shortage of ice or what the issue was. But our drinks had 5 ice cubes. If we were lucky. When we asked for more ice we did not receive until asking again. We asked other wait staff who, instead of getting us a glass with ice, walked around trying to figure out who had our table. We asked for ketchup and we're given an empty bottle. It will be a long time before we come back! Even asked the manager who was behind us for assistance and he walked off. Got up and asked the woman behind in the service area and she completely ignored us. If you're looking for warm beverages or to be ignored then this is the place to come. Should have read it the yelp reviews before coming here!"
Danielle J.,"Huntington Beach, CA",201,37,9,5.0,10/25/2016,"Delicious!!! First time here and loved the food and environment!! Huge TV screens with multiple games on as well as yummy food!! Big menu with lots of options. The chips, salsa and guacamole were SO GOOD!!! We ended up getting two orders. I ordered the Ahi Salad, which was also so good!!! Fresh vegetables and ahi.  All of the food that I saw looked really good!! Can't wait to come back!!"
Joseph Y.,"Fresno, CA",153,32,52,3.0,8/2/2016,"I like this place a lot: the food, the ambiance, the location, and the fact that they stay open later than almost all the fine dining restaurants in Fresno. Their spaghetti is awesome with huge meatballs, their fettuccine is superb, the appetizer ribs were the best aside from Dickies, and not to mention their lemonades... But aside from those, they need to work on the customer service more; the server that I had was not very attentive and most of the time you see like 4 or 5 people standing at the front just standing there... I mean like even thought you're done or if you're the host... A little hand to help your own co-workers doesn't hurt.... Especially when their busy as heck and you're just standing there"
