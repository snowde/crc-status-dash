Ben C.,"Clovis, CA",68,69,2,3.0,8/30/2015,"Bjs brewhouse is a delightful little restaurant chain that serves some classic American style food without too many frills. With a wide open seating area, and a television screen any direction you look, it is almost reminiscent of a sports bar. This is in no way problematic as long as you go in recognizing that loud yelling from the bar area, and some random guys down in the dining area are frequent disruptions. Overall the atmosphere is boisterous and loud, but cohesive. The lighting makes it easy to read the menus without having to strain while also maintaining a level of dimness that makes it seem more cozy than it really is.  The service at Bjs is in-line with the ambiance. Although I have never had a bad experience, I have never really had an amazing one either. Aside from the fact that some of the waiters are really easy on the eyes, most of them seem like they are working their way through college. Obviously that is perfectly acceptable, but sometimes it can be problematic when they seem a bit distracted while ordering. As I said, no one has been too bad, just never that exceptional service that you hope for. The menu itself is a mishmash of Asian-fusion, Italian, American, and a few other things. I can honestly say that most of the entrees and appetizers are ok. They don't blow me away, but they also aren't bad. I never find myself ordering the same thing twice because of how good it was. Except perhaps the broccoli cheese soup. They only serve it certain days, and it is worth ordering.  Two items that they are known for are their pizzas, and their burgers. The burgers are, again, ok. They have big patties, and lots of different topping options. I have not had one in awhile due to being a vegetarian, but I can't remember ever feeling disappointed with a burger. The pizza, on the other hand, is very hit or miss. Served deep-dish style, the pizzas are offered in a variety of overwhelming flavors. BBQ chicken, the Great White... the list is long, but overall is entirely underwhelming. I can say that I haven't really had a pizza I liked at Bjs. They don't provide that ump you expect of good pizza, which leaves me craving some nice cheesy sauce pizza from some other local pizza shop.  Finally, the reason I keep going back to Bjs, they have desserts. The Pizookie (pizza cookie) is perhaps the most famous item on their menu. A fresh, hot, thick, gooey cookie topped with some creamy vanilla ice cream, how could that be bad? I would suggest sticking with the classic flavors. Chocolate chip, peanut butter, or white chocolate macadamia are all winners. I have also had the Oreo, the Red Velvet, and the Ghirardelli double chocolate, all of which left me wishing I had ordered one of the originals.  All in all Bjs is a great little chain. Before I gave up drinking I could always rely on their bartenders to provide a tasty cocktail, they have entrees that are worthy of your 12 bucks, and the desserts are all bomb. If they weren't so much like every other chain they would be worth four stars, but there's just nothing unique about Bjs."
Mike D.,"Fresno, CA",11,131,119,2.0,10/7/2015,"Food---OK I guess. I've had various pizzas, burgers, salads, and apps over the years. But I'm finally writing a review based on the service. THE WORST!!! We had a large group (10) on a week night. Ordered beers and water. 35 minute wait---for beers and water? How is this possible?  Servers were nice and all. Not their fault I guess, but hey management, get it together."
Mr. Nice G.,"Fresno, CA",16,222,186,4.0,12/17/2016,"One of the best places to go for a wide range of craft beers. Very large bar area with plenty of tvs to catch the game. The food selection is   adequate for a brew house menu nothing stands out that you can't get anywhere else. The price is reasonable, keep in mind you will pay 15-20% more for beer and good than you would your local bar. But hey its the atmosphere you pay for."
Nicole S.,"Long Beach, CA",15,27,40,3.0,7/24/2015,"The pazookie's are amazing! Probably the best part of the restaurant. The food is good as well and I have no complaints about the atmosphere. It might be a bit noisey to take a date but hey, the food is worth it. The only downside is the long wait time to get a table and the poor service I got last time. Our server was attentive yet forgetful, she had to be reminded to bring things several times. Also, we waited about 30 minutes for the pazookie and although it was worth it, I've waited less than 15 minutes on a busy night but with a different server."
Emma Z.,"Coarsegold, CA",0,2,,2.0,7/6/2017,"Bad service. Mediocre food. As soon as we walked into the restaurant, the staff began to talk poorly about us. We heard mumbles of ""oh great"" and ""good luck"" before being seated. I asked for sugar with my iced tea & the waitress didn't return with it, or to even check on us until we were ready for the bill. I understand that when working in the food industry, shit happens. But this was by far the worst service I've received."
Priscilla W.,"Fresno, CA",332,185,841,3.0,4/24/2015,"I must admit that I'm biased to this restaurant in that I am in love with their chicken wings! The service varies from time to time. Some of my visits have been wonderful other times I have come here and they've left me with much to be desired. Overall I think the big selling point is that they're open late every night. They don't close till midnight every night and on the weekends it's 1 a.m. That makes this restaurant a great place to go after hours before you go home. And by the way, if there is a basketball game on or football game they always offer some type of happy hour specials during the game. Overall a great place to go for friends and a large menu"
Jeremy C.,"Madera, CA",203,117,3035,4.0,6/20/2014,"Always enjoy the food here, the service can be a hit or miss. The menu has an abundance of items like vegetarian, bbq, American style, Asian fusion, pizzas and so much more. The menu is probably 10 plus pages of items front to back. BJ's has a phone app that makes it easier to get a table, order food, pay and keeps track of your loyalty points. Yes there is a loyalty program that keeps track of your purchases and gives you points to be used for food items or experiences like events etc., and it is free. If your in a rush use the app to pay and you will be out of there as soon as your done eating.   Great brewed in house beer selection and full bar. Customer service has always been pretty good for me, except those times where the waiter/waitress did not give it there best. Parking can be a hassle especially during the holidays at this location due to the mall being right here.  BJ's does offer curbside pickup and has selected parking spots located right in front. I have had an issue with my order before at this location and I wrote a email to the manager about it, the manager responded quickly and made it right. very pleased with the way my complaint was handled.   Things I love at BJ's the ribs, the shrimp lettuce wraps, the parmesan crusted chicken entrée, the pizza cookies, the pizza and the in house brewed beer flights/sampling's."
Diala H.,"Fresno, CA",0,4,,4.0,1/15/2017,I always come here for the deep dish pizza and the pizookies. My favorite is the smores pizookie its my favorite and its my favorite cheat meal dessert. Waiting time can be kind of inconvenient on saturday nights but its usually worth the wait
Ad G.,"CA, CA",0,237,406,2.0,9/29/2015,Take out order took 30-35 mins. Return to hotel open the bag and no utensils! No napkins!  Not sure why so much extra cheese was on the pizza.  The dessert Beignet with ice cream ...had to search for utensils.  I even tipped on my bill and waste that money.
Shola A.,"Fresno, CA",3,62,116,1.0,2/18/2016,"Going here was a pretty bland experience. Nothing stood out at all. The food was overpriced and flavorless. When there was flavor, it is either bursting in salt or ""blackened"" (read as burnt darker than me).  I got the peach margarita, with one of the new low calorie meals, Mediterranean pita tacos with chips instead of the slaw. How they can't get a nice fresh meal for under 600 calories is a mystery to me but oh well! The tacos were filling but then again, sawdust had more flavor. There was nothing I could find to redeem this meal. But the peach margarita was really really good (1+ star!) however, but it was not $10.00 good. I thought about taking pictures for my review but I didn't want to even remember this place in any way. Overall, it was an over-over-over priced Applebees with nicer decor, delish drinks and quick service. The food court at the mall has more flavorful food then this place."
Daniel B.,"Reedley, CA",102,6,,2.0,11/14/2016,"Two stars for the service and the drinks. The food? Not so good! I ordered the brisket burger medium and it came out not only well done but beyond well done. Not a happy camper. I told the waitress about it and she smiled kindly and said she would let the kitchen staff know about. Still never fixed the problem. I probably should have mentioned that it lacked in flavor too. My wife had the deep dish baked ziti. Very dry, and flavor profile was bland and freezer aisle mediocre. The Caesar salad was ok and the tortilla CHIP soup didn't come with tortilla chips and we were offered oyster crackers. I had the makers and coke and my wife had the nutty brewnette."
Ronald W.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,16,,5.0,11/26/2016,Came in with a group of 30 unannounced.  Amy the manager and her crew took care of us with no Problems or complaints.  Will definitely be back to this location.
Ronald W.,"Fresno, CA",29,51,23,4.0,4/25/2017,I love this place great service best root beer black cherry soda great pizza i have absolutely zero complaints about this place always great food
Mikayla S.,"Fresno, CA",155,3,,1.0,11/11/2016,"We closed out with a wonderful server Michael and received a new server named Adam in the bar area. He came by the first time and asked if we wanted to get more drinks started and we said ""Not yet, thank you!"" He did not come by a single time after that and would look directly at our table every time he would walk by and stop at another table he was serving. I don't know if he didn't want to open up another table since we didn't order the first time he came by, but we kept waiting for him to stop while looking directly at him and him making eye contact with us. It was very rude of him and ruined our wonderful BJ's experience we were having before he was our server."
Marlene P.,"Clovis, CA",23,36,4,4.0,4/11/2017,"I recommend joining the Premier Rewards. They send emails with discount coupons. After your visit they send emails & you can let them know how your visit went. You will even get personal responses from time to time, not computer generated ones. Some dishes are really good and better than others. If you didn't like what you had on your first visit, don't write them off. Try something else. The salmon dishes are great. Pizzas are good. The crust is thick, but crisp on the outside & tender inside. Soups; the ones I have tried are very good. Salads are fresh. My husband even likes the steaks. All you can eat soup & salad Lunch is a great deal. I'm not the biggest fan of the pizookie, but I guess they sell a lot of them. I see others eating them all of the time.  Yeah, once in a while something gets screwed up, but let them know so they can make it right. We have been repeat customers of BJs for may be nine years now."
Linda C.,"Fresno, CA",71,321,752,1.0,12/14/2015,"I've said it plenty of times whenever we are choosing a place to go out. BJ's is my least favorite place of them all.  The service here has always been horrible for me.  But this last visit really did it for me & I understand there are great servers and not so great ones but I just felt so disrespected.  Tiffany T at the bar was absolutely rude.  My friends told her they wanted the beers on one tab and the shot on another.  Because I wanted to purchase a shot of whiskey for my BF. While my sister's BF, wanted to treat the first round of beers for the guys.  We were not rowdy at all, this was our first bar of the evening. So I can't even fathom what I had done for her to be rude.  When she brought the tab, unseparated, I was like whatever. I'll pay for it. But my sister's BF was like, the whiskey was only $8? I was like oh?  So he kindly asked her AGAIN, if she could separate it.  She said to him, ""YOU TOLD ME IT WAS ALL ONE TAB.  OMG. "" in the rudest way possible, acting very annoyed with us.  The. Turned around for not even a minute to separate the tab!  It didn't even take a minute !!!!!  And then she said card. Grabbed it out our hands and charged them. I was appalled because she was so nice to the other men down the bar from us.  Then the unpleasant stares we got from her and a couple of other servers near the bar wasn't welcoming either."
Lily A.,"Fresno, CA",3,30,24,3.0,5/31/2017,"Overall I think this is an average restaurant. The ambience is quite nice as the lights are dim and the music is low. Wait time is extremely long during dinner but during lunch, service is fast! My favorite dish is the pizza and craft beer! Other food dishes are mediocre in my opinion. However, I will continue to come on special occasions and group events."
Jeff T.,"Madera, CA",138,156,249,4.0,1/13/2015,"I've been to BJ's at least half a dozen times and I find it a great casual sit-down restaurant at an affordable price point.  Lines are reasonable, food is good.  I like their home-brewed root beer; though I'm just a root beer dilettante I find it tasty and satisfying.  Service has proven reliable and friendly.  BJ's is always a great place to meet some friends or grab a lunch on your own."
Chris F.,"Fresno, CA",46,11,5,5.0,12/19/2015,"My wife and I went here Friday December 18. Despite the crowds, we were seated almost immediately. We ordered the stuffed mushrooms appetizer. These are stuffed with artichoke spinach dip, feta cheese , onions and a lemon aioli. We also ordered the BJ's favorite deep dish pizza with pepperoni, Italian sausage, meatballs, olives, mushrooms and seasoned tomatoes.  The food was brought out quickly. We scarfed down the mushrooms and pizza. Both were outstanding. Our waiter was attentive without being annoying.  I heartily recommend BJ's ."
Bob M.,"Peoria, AZ",62,82,47,2.0,5/18/2015,The food was okay tonight. My wife had the Parmesan Chicken and said it was good.  I had the baby back ribs and they were dry. Our server was good but it took an hour to get our food. My suggestion... Don't come when they are busy because the kitchen is slow...
