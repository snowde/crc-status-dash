Joshua B.,"Visalia, CA",80,28,41,3.0,4/26/2016,Upon walking in i am always Greeted with a smile. They have amazing homemade soda as well I love the root beer and vanilla creme. But the food quality is okay it's nothing really fantastic. The desserts are good like the pizzookie but other than that I'm not really that impressed with the food.  Only thing I don't like is the restaurant is usually cold(bring a sweater!) and if you go at night you can't really see your menu. It's dark inside. Since the restaurant is so big you can be left sitting for a while got your drinks and food! I would give 4 maybe even 5 stars if it was faster service.
Shelby P.,"Visalia, CA",2,12,5,5.0,6/14/2016,"I am so not seeing what the 2 star reviews are saying. I went to BJ's for my anniversary and it was amazing!! Our server did have a lot of tables and we also ordered drinks at the same time as our food. It took a little longer then expected but we understood with how many tables he did have. Our drinks came and the food  followed right behind him. Everything was so delicious and before they left the table they had me cut into my house sirloin to make sure it was cooked fine which I greatly appreciated, so tack on great service. I was perfect and juicy, one of the best steaks I have ever had! My boyfriend loved his brisket burger and the thin fries are to die for. So reasonably priced! Thank you BJ's for an amazing meal!"
Caitlin C.,"Fresno, CA",191,2,,1.0,11/2/2016,"Terrible service. Went with a party of 12 for a birthday party, we told the waitresses it was our friends birthday, never did they bring a pazookie. They never asked if we wanted any dessert, they just rushed the checks. We had to wait 5 min for silverware to be brought to us, after the food was already brought out. The waitresses never asked how the food was, very poor service."
Mia T.,"Fresno, CA",0,40,6,3.0,3/14/2017,"Open late is a big advantage for them but prices are a Lil high for the food they got. The mini pizookie sampler was good but still pricey. First time there n I think money could be better spent elsewhere, their handcraft sodas were probably only thing worth the price, and the fact they are open later on Wednesdays and Sundays."
Viktoria Lynn L.,"Fresno, CA",83,81,340,3.0,12/2/2015,"We started with the avocado egg rolls (sauce was too sweet for my liking). I ordered the stuffed potato with chicken, broccoli cheese and Alfredo sauce (dry and very bland) it was served with soup or salad so I picked the chicken tortilla soup (only item I cared for, great flavor lots of cumin though) . My husband ordered the jambalaya and it was very good! Not much of a happy hour or lunch special if that's you're thing."
Alan T.,"Fresno, CA",310,103,238,4.0,2/14/2015,"I absolutely  love the shrimp lettuce wraps and the avocado egg rolls are extremely good too. As far as entrees  are concerned Ive tried the cajun pasta and both are really good. They have a great selection of beers on tap, included a  few that are exclusive  to the restaurant. Service is good but can be slow late at night. Im usually  go after 10:00 pm so I can't  speak for any other times of the day. The atmosphere  is cool, dimly lit, the flooring  is bi-level, and theres quite a few televisions throughout  the restaurant. The bathrooms are always clean and parking is usually  pretty  good. Overall, I think its a great place."
Add T.,"Fresno, CA",15,15,8,3.0,2/21/2015,"ORDER : BJ house pizza and the great white pizza with calamari.   Pizza was average. The chicken texture was nothing compared to the fowl itself, disturbing. Something you can buy ingridents at winco and make the same quality pizza which is not from scratch. Calamari was bland and looked unimpressive. Drink lots of beer before you order to lower your standards. Disappointed but it's a chain restaurant. Expected I guess."
Tina V.,"Fresno, CA",77,64,11,2.0,8/31/2016,"First time here and I ordered the pork ribs half rack. It was pricy, $18.99 and it only came with 5-6 pieces and it did not taste good at all. The side that I chose with the ribs was mashed potatoes and that was not good either! It tasted cheesy!! First time having mashed potatoes that tasted like cheese...ewww! I'm giving 2 stars because the only thing good here that I liked was the clam chower. Service was slow, we had to wait a long time for the server to come back to take our orders after we told her we needed a few extra minutes. Few minutes did not mean 15 mins! Anyway I guess she took forever because the place was packed for a Wednesday! Anyway, I would not come back here again unless I want the clam chowder. Service was not good, food was bad, and price was too expensive"
Paul H.,"Burbank, Los Angeles, CA",0,3,1,1.0,11/25/2015,"The hosted has an attitude problem very rude ...  They had a lot space empty for group of 10 people but they put me on waiting for 40 min. When I ask if the could seat on the back where is empty space she tells ""the are all reserve and need it to wait""  guess what after 40 min we end up seating there. As the picture nobody smiles ..."
Linda T.,"Fresno, CA",2,13,3,2.0,8/7/2016,"Not sure what's been going on with management but this place hasn't been as great as it used to be. My husband and I come here very often so we know how the food we enjoy should come out. With that being said, theres been multiple occasions with bad food and service. At first I thought I might be a one time thing but it's been continuously occuring. Hopefully they get their stuff together soon."
Alyssa H.,"Dinuba, CA",34,73,128,4.0,7/15/2016,"The service wasn't so great, not bad but not good either. The food was pretty damn good. Packed around 7. Unless your eating for two, make sure you make reservations if you can not stand waiting around by the entrance way."
Rick R.,"Fresno, CA",971,18,5,2.0,8/16/2015,My food quality & taste was decent.  But for the price it was very small.  $14 meal and only 8 ounces of food. Disappointed about the food.  The atmosphere was cool though. With some friends so we still had a good time.
Joe T.,"Fresno, CA",15,4,1,1.0,6/5/2016,Horrible experience. Been here over an hr and 40 mins and all of our party has not been served. They can not cash me out because of their issues. I'm held hostage due to their inability to handle Sunday brunch crowd.  Food was cold and never did get my drink. Will not be back.
Erin A.,"Fresno, CA",50,63,70,2.0,9/14/2015,"I was hesitant to come here again to watch a football game as we came for one game last year and felt rushed. They were promoting watching the game there, though, and everyone knows that's a 3 hour ordeal so we decided to give it another try. Bad idea!! This visit was even worse than the last! I got off work late so my hubby sat in the bar, ordered an appetizer and politely waited for me. He later placed our pizza order with a comment that I wasn't there yet but I should be there before the food comes out. Not 2 minutes later, a server drops the salads off to my bewildered husband. 15 minutes later, the pizza comes out to a table with 2 untouched salads on it! How utterly and completely rude! At least the server noticed that faux pas and had the pizza immediately taken back (but they later delivered the exact same pizza to us). So I show up after a stressful day at work ready to relax and watch the game but am immediately greeted by a salad that is in the way of me enjoying the half of the appetizer that my hubby kindly left for me. So I move the salad, eat the appetizer, eat the salad and then they bring out the exact same pizza which is now lukewarm and dry. Why they didn't just re-make the pizza baffles me. It had been waiting at least 30 minutes - don't they have health rules about how long cooked food can sit? So after one slice of this lukewarm nonsense I push my plate away in disgust. The server immediately comes over to pick up my plate, get our pazookie order (which I refuse to give her) and leaves with ""I'll bring you a box"". A BOX!?! My husband is still eating! So she brings us the box and asks about the pazookie choice AGAIN and my husband and I say ""No we haven't decided yet!"" in perfect irritated unison. BTW, it's not even halftime yet...  So we continue to refuse to give our pazookie order until the 4th quarter starts and then we don't receive it until the 2 minute warning and it's barely warm. Nice to know some servers have a sense of humor. But of course my husband still insists on tipping 20%... Needless to say, we won't be back."
Jovana A.,"El Paso, TX",67,4,,4.0,4/23/2016,Went there last night around 8ish the atmosphere was nice.. I love the dim lights makes the moment a bit special when on a date  our waiter always came and asked us if we needed anything else. I had the sangria and I've had better it didn't have a lot of the fruity flavor I'm used to so if you like me I don't recommend it. I ordered the chicken and spinach on top of quinoa absolutely delicious!!! Overall a great expierence.   I highly recommend
Sharon K.,"Fresno, CA",21,23,2,5.0,8/8/2016,"FANTASTIC. I threw my daughter a surprise 40th birthday party here this past weekend. Cicily and Amy, along with their staff, went above and beyond. Service was wonderful, food was spectacular. We were a party of about 20 and they didn't miss anything. This is by far our go to for any future special occasions or just popping in for a meal. I cannot say enough good things about this place."
Sarah F.,"Fresno, CA",0,5,,4.0,2/2/2017,Tonight I ordered a pick-up order for a chicken salad and pazookie. I noticed on the bjs website they were offering a free pazookie with any purchase of $13 or more. Score!! Food was great & the hostess was nice!
Celestine V.,"Honolulu, HI",491,300,1020,3.0,4/23/2014,"After coming here a few times for meals, I decided I should review this place on a recent take-out experience. I came looking for large amounts of root beer, and I figured they'd have something to sell me about a gallon's worth in. I called ahead and was told they had growlers for that and they would cost me $9, so I asked for two. When I came in, there was one person who was absolutely certain they had 4 in stock, and spent 15 minutes looking for them. They finally came to the conclusion that they were out of stock, and gave me my root beer in the to-go coffee containers, and gave me a receipt to come back and get them in a few days when they were in stock.  When I did go in to get them, not only did I have to pay for refills (I thought at least they might give me something comped for the trouble), but the root beer they gave me was flat. It really bummed me out because their root beer is my favorite.  Based on my previous dining experience and customer service, I bumped the rating up a bit, but I felt like that situation could have been better on their part."
Alexis B.,"Parrish, FL",0,33,24,4.0,7/10/2016,"We have been three times this past week (traveling) and have had generally a good experience.  Our last visit was slow service and the server came and filled up my Sierra Mist with water lol. The time before service was slow too.  But it's the only time we have together so we don't mind waiting because we get to catch up.  The staff are friendly.  There hasn't been a wait to get in but we have been going after 9pm.  I have really enjoyed the broccoli cheddar bread bowl, there's nothing like sourdough in California!  It's yum.  My hubby did not enjoy the baked ziti (too oily).  The wedge salad and chunky wedge fries are great!"
