Cherie B.,"Leesburg, VA",41,63,28,4.0,9/6/2017,"I had the pleasure of dining here last weekend, and I can't wait to go back. The atmosphere and ambiance was cool and fun--perfect for a Saturday night. Even though the menu is large, I was thrilled to see an entire section of healthier items. Nutritional information was easy to read.  I orderered the Peruvian shrimp quinoua and hubby had flatbread pizza. They were both wonderful! We couldn't resist splurging on dessert. The Beignet was incredible!  Our service was fantastic as well. We can't wait to go back when we are able to enjoy some of the yummy craft brews."
Bill C.,"Bristow, VA",83,110,206,2.0,11/4/2017,"Somebody please teach them what ""medium rare"" means.  The slowest kitchen in the planet combined with mediocre food and badly executed instructions (medium rare open a  dictionary) Table of 6, sitting for a very long time after the order was taken.  Waiter was good. The Manhattan was made well. The saving grace. Price is well beyond the experience."
Lisa R.,"Haymarket, VA",1,27,,2.0,10/10/2017,"I would have to agree with JE's assessment of this restaurant and add that for the quality of the food, it is overpriced.   Went there for lunch on Monday, Oct 9 with my husband and he ordered what he thought was the special priced pizza since this was the advertised special for the day.  However, upon getting the check for the meal, he was told by our server that the pizza size he ordered was not the special and he paid $12.00 more as a result of this oversight.   Now, yes my husband should have read the fine print but being that the server is there to assist, and knowing that this was the day's special, the server could have gone a step further and clarified with my husband in a gesture of goodwill but he chose not to assist.  Not good anticipatory skills as a server!   I like a courteous smile and prompt service, which our server provided, but I also like a brain to go along with that smile and prompt service, especially in the service industry.  Okay, I'll get off my soapbox now."
Beth R.,"Beaches, Jacksonville Beach, FL",12,1,,4.0,1/2/2018,We had the best experience today here at this place. The waiter Dray did a good job serving us. The food was great
Marie B.,"Alexandria, VA",50,79,41,2.0,8/8/2017,"If a restaurant wanted to send a message that they don't want you back as a customer, pretty sure they would have done it like this. All of my To-Go order was burned to a crisp! (And this is coming from a person who likes well done food!). So disappointed. Granted, I have had hit or miss experiences the past few visits  (mostly misses), they are conveniently located and offer a big variety at a reasonable cost.  Between the condensation leak in the lobby to the food, I'm over it."
Nathan B.,"Manassas, VA",8,206,2,5.0,8/15/2017,"My family has been to BJ's several times and have always enjoyed it. I am updating because my wife and I attended a special beer dinner event last night. I had signed up for BJ's email club because they force you to do it to register for call-ahead seating online. That is how I was notified about the beer dinner. The dinner was five courses and featured beers from Sam Adams and a couple of BJ's beers too. The menu with the beer tasting was delicious and included some items from their latest menu. The beers from Sam Adams were perfectly paired with the food and not only were good beers but accentuated the food taste. Welcome beer: Sam Adams Boston Lager-a solid beer 1st course: Watermelon/Feta Salad paired with Angry Orchard (owned by Sam Adams) Crisp Apple and BJ's Berry Burst Cider-A really nice and light salad with a citrus vinaigrette and the feta and watermelon tasted great. Ciders were nice and light and brought out the flavors of the citrus and watermelon in the salad. 2nd course: Creamy Couscous Mac and Cheese paired with Sam Adams Honey Rye Pale Ale-the thought of couscous as a mac and cheese did not tempt me but I have to admit I was wrong. The dish is a base of couscous made like mac and cheese but it is topped off with bacon, tomatoes, and basil. So delicious! My least favorite of the beers, just not a lot of flavor in the beer but it allowed my favorite part of the dinner to take over my taste buds. 3rd course: Bone-in wings with Nashville Hot Sauce paired with Sam Adams Rebel IPA-wings were crispy and perfectly cooked inside. The Nashville Hot sauce is outstanding, a little spicy but definitely not too spicy. Served with homemade dill pickles, celery, and ranch. IPA and spiciness were a great match. Palate Cleanser: BJ's Midsummer's Ale which is a saison/farmhouse variety of beer 4th course: Cherry Chipotle Glazed Salmon/asparagus/couscous paired with Sam Adams Maple Red Ale-The glazed salmon had just a touch of sweetness from the cherry and was really tasty after we removed the dark fishy layer on the bottom side. For me the star of the entree dish was the asparagus. Perfectly cooked so it was still crispy but warmed through. I ended up drinking the saison with this part of the meal.The black pepper/coriander flavor in the saison made the chipotle flavor in the glaze stand out.  Palate Cleanser: Sam Adams Black Lager-a schwarzbier style beer-a sweet roasted malt flavor in the beer got my mouth ready for dessert 5th course: Churro Pizookie paired with Sam Adams 20 pounds of pumpkin-Cinnamon sweet goodness. Not really a cookie like the other Pizookies but it is short pieces of a churro with a scoop of cinnamon sugar dusted vanilla ice cream. I was so full from the rest of the meal I could not enjoy this dish in it's full glory but what I did eat was perfect with the pumpkin spice beer. I would like to come back just to eat it by itself. Service was outstanding for the entire event. Managers and servers all pitched in to make the event go smoothly. A Sam Adams representative was there to talk about the beers as we tasted them. It was nice to learn about the history of the beers. They even had raffles of neat Sam Adams themed items like pint glasses, t-shirts, ear buds, and keychains. I am really sad because I won a pint glass, earbuds, and a keychain but was stupid enough to leave them sitting on the table when we walked out.  Overall the experience was fantastic and we had a really good time. We are going to try to get a group together for the next one. I very highly recommend signing up for BJ's emails and getting in on one of these special event dinners. The next one is planned for some time in October and I will definitely be attending again. I can't wait!"
Joyce A.,"Gainesville, VA",150,231,326,3.0,7/12/2017,"My husband, my sister, and I came here for a late dinner one night after a long day of unpacking. I have to say the service was the worst part of our visit. When we first walked in, being so late, there was hardly anyone in the restaurant. Someone walked by--I'm not sure if she was a hostess or server or who she was--and told us to just sit anywhere. She mumbled something to us about the menu and walked off. Confused, we sat at a nearby table, wondering if they were still serving the full menu because we weren't sure if that's what she had said. After about 10-15 minutes of waiting for someone to bring us menus, our server finally came out from the kitchen to greet us. He was friendly but pretty slow. He asked us if we were ready to order, but we told him we didn't even have menus. After more waiting, we finally had menus. We ordered our dinner, and my husband and I ordered drinks. The food and drinks were great. I thought I had a pretty good meal, but my sister didn't enjoy her food as much. I would give this place another try. The food was decent enough, and it's very close to our house. I would just want to try at a different time of day, hopefully when there are more people around and we would be less ignored."
Abbi H.,"Haymarket, VA",0,25,,2.0,12/21/2017,The place looks nice. The food is a little over priced. I ordered the Shrimp Pennine dish. The picture in the menu shows a lot of shrimp and some Pennine on the bottom. I only got 5 shrimp.  A little miss leading.  Won't go again.
Joseph C.,"Gainesville, VA",43,8,,3.0,12/21/2017,"The best thing I can say is that everything is just average. The food, staff, decor, wait time, and price to portion ratio are all good, but not great. You leave feeling just okay about your meal experience, so if you are okay with okay, then go for it."
Bob M.,"Park City, UT",245,55,63,5.0,5/25/2017,"I love this place!  Better food and service than Bar Louie, better micro brew selection than anything in Gainesville and the food is consistently good.   Most that bash this place forget the fact that bartenders, wait staff are human...they should come to a place 3-4 times before judging 1 crew!  Overall, this is your best bet in Gainesville VA!"
Alex C.,"Leesburg, VA",1,8,3,5.0,9/22/2017,"I love love love coming here!!!! The food and customer service never disappoints. Alexa our server was awesome she was very attentive and on top of everything. The food was even better we had the shrimp penne and asparagus, which is always amazing as well as the deep dish BJs favorite pizza.  If you're ever in the area I definitely recommend you stop by!!!"
J E.,"Stafford, VA",0,635,1556,3.0,8/26/2017,"We stopped in for a business lunch during a weekday.  Service was decent, presented with a smile, but a little slow and somewhat forgetful at times.   The menu the have is quite large, which can be very worrisome, as you have to wonder how they can make so man items and make them perfectly.  Well, they don't really make them perfectly, just adequately. The food we ordered taste good, it wasn't bad.  But this is more of a typical chain restaurant with not much more to offer.  Probably great for drinks and happy hour though."
Vanessa S.,"Gainesville, VA",23,5,2,3.0,9/5/2017,"Recently ordered to go since they have nice online deals. When I got there nobody was at the take out register which was a little confusing. Lots of server were standing around but nobody would seem to care that's why only 3 Stars. The food was pretty good though. I ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger with French Fries and the Fried Asparagus which was actually really tasty. I think they have to work more on their customer service, since the food is really good. They also offer deals from Monday - Thursday."
Adrianna C.,"San Antonio, TX",88,318,482,2.0,6/1/2016,"Came in recently after having not been in for some time. Was quite disappointed to find that the menu had changed and many of my favorite items are no longer on the menu. I loved the corn fritters for an appetizer and my favorite main dishes were either the pesto chicken sandwich or their (i think it was called) California burger, served on sourdough toast, neither of which are on the menu now.  We order their avocado eggrolls to start and 3 of the 6 were very burnt. I ordered the guacamole bacon burger which was the closest thing they had to my old favorite. The bun was terribly dry and the burger was overcooked. I hardly finished half of it.  Service was friendly but slow. Not sure why, but they seated us on the far far end of the restaurant, the other half that is separated by a wall from the rest of the dining area. Only two other parties were seated there and I think being over there resulted in us being frequently forgotten.  This used to be one of my favorite places in the area, but I don't think I will be returning now."
Jami G.,"Indian Trail, NC",0,2,,1.0,11/8/2017,"Went with friends and we received cold food and slow service. We talked to our waiter about the issues and he sent the manager to the table. . She said ""I was told to come"". What manager says that?!?! No customer service from the manager at all."
Vanessa P.,"Manassas, VA",151,383,194,4.0,6/2/2017,"Overall, BJ's is a nice place with high ceilings and a swanky sports bar type atmosphere. The staff is all very nice, service is quick.  I had the Thursday rib special, and although I *loved* the flavor of the sauce, I felt that the meat to bone ratio was a little off - so there was little meat on the bones.  The triple chocolate pizookie is god's gift to mankind (and bless them for having a dinner special that includes a mini one of those, cos I could polish off a normal sized one easy). I'd definitely eat at BJ's again - maybe next time I'll have a hamburger though."
Jaleesa B.,"Centreville, VA",0,5,1,1.0,8/18/2017,"I used to live in Huntington Beach, CA, and would eat dinner at BJ's on a regular basis. I recently moved to Northern Virginia, and was excited to see a BJ's not too far away in a nearby city Gainesville. My husband went there tonight and grabbed to-go meals for us. For me, he got my favorite, Jambalaya. My husband got a burger for himself. I was repulsed by the burnt, over seasoned, over cooked mess of a ""jambalaya"" dish. And my husband's burger was rare, rather than medium well as he requested. My husband took the trip back to BJ's to return the horrible meal. I wish we would have checked before leaving the restaurant, but we are BJ's vets, and have never experienced anything like this. BJ's definitely lost a long time customer!"
Tony D.,"Gainesville, VA",1,20,,4.0,7/30/2017,"Tell yourself you're going to BJ's for a meal, but we both know the truth - you're going for the Pizookies! Chocolate chip, triple chocolate, cookies & cream, salted caramel, or even monkey bread. Delicious! BJ's is what you think it is - it's got the comfort of a chain restaurant with a step up in quality. It's got a wide array of options, from burgers & salads up through steaks & pizza. Personal favorites? The Parmesan-crusted chicken for dinner, or the fried chicken for lunch. It even has respectable gluten free options, including gluten free pizza.  The biggest selling point for me is the variety. You have traditional appetizers like chips & salsa or wings, or you have crazy new options like cauliflower or beets. (Seriously.) You can sit yourself down in front of a pulled pork burger (which is amazing) or a tasty jambalaya bowl. Try something different every time. But don't forget to save room for dessert..."
Michael O.,"Manassas, VA",2,49,10,5.0,9/20/2017,"YUMM. I love BJ's in Gainsville. The place is comfortable, intimate with a touch of luxury. The menu has one of the best varieties I have seen without being overwhelming. I think everyone will be able to find something easily here. I had the Roast Shrimp Peruvian Quinoa Bowl. It was really a great dish. I would easily go back just for that. I server was friendly and attentive. I also had dessert;  I had the Pizookie trio. A Pizookie comes in a round metal dish and is like a warm brownie or cookie that is topped with ice cream. We ordered the salted caramel, chocolate chip and chocolate pizookies. This was so amazing that I may consider skipping right to dessert on my next visit."
Stellar R.,"Gainesville, VA",0,25,2,2.0,10/24/2017,Below average food. Local chili's or applebees would be better.
Ray H.,"Silver Spring, MD",18,1,,4.0,10/17/2017,"Good experience here for the first time. Our waiter Travis was very helpful AND entertaining. He knew the menu well since there is so much to choose from and he timed our orders just right, from drinks, appetizers, to main course. Great  guy, great service, great place for a friends and family dinner outing."
Jennifer F.,"Washington, DC",100,170,3,5.0,5/7/2017,"Called 15 minutes prior to arrival with 12 hungry and wet golfers!  Ali quickly had us set up and when I miscounted and had to add more, she did it with ease.  Christopher was terrific!  He handled the large party and the separate checks with aplomb.   The menu is frighteningly large - 20 pages!  It is hard to decide what to have but it was really, really good.  The Chowder in the Bread bowl was amazing!  So yummy. I can imagine that the place gets really loud when it is full but we had a terrific time."
Brian M.,"Southfield, MI",0,5,,3.0,9/26/2017,"BJ's is a good sports bar with good food. Every time I go, I expect it to be better but it's not. It is solidly average. That said, it's the best place to watch a game, eat good apps and drink a beer or five."
Linda C.,"Centreville, VA",134,237,184,3.0,2/24/2017,"I've been to BJ's a few times and I do like the atmosphere. It is a cavernous restaurant that seems to go on forever. Very high ceilings, and yet it doesn't seem impersonal. Comfortable booths and seating and the dining room seems very clean. Huge bar area with a very large selection of beers. Unfortunately, the ladies' room was a bit of a disaster. The trough sink was clogged, resulting in a few inches of water spread across the whole six-foot basin. Not attractive. They seem to add something new to their menu each time I'm there. This time the latest was a kale and quinoa bowl, which you know is all the rage. Everyone seems to have loads of kale and quinoa these days. But I do like it, it's a satisfying dish, so I ordered it. I wasn't in the mood for a large lunch or heavy food. It tasted great and I enjoyed it. My husband had a chicken sandwich that he enjoyed as well. In fact, I've enjoyed everything I've gotten there. My only negative is that everything seems to be somewhat overpriced. The myriad choices of beers are great, but they start around $6 and go up from there. The aforementioned bowl I had was almost $11, which is a bit much for what I could essentially get across the way at Cava Grill for less. I guess we are paying for atmosphere. Our service was a little slow, even though it wasn't busy. The server was friendly, but kind of forgot to check on us until we were almost done. In fact, I had to pretty much hunt her down for some lemon at one point, because she simply disappeared. I still like going here on occasion, but it's not really a favorite. It could be so much more, in my opinion, since they have such a great space. I did hear that BJ's (the big box store as well as the restaurant) was being taken over by new management, which may account for the lackluster service."
DC P.,"Fairfax, VA",0,18,,1.0,9/15/2017,"A V O I D !    Temperature is about 60 degrees on a 75 degree day.  Guacamole was worse than what you get at Walmart, no cilantro, no citrus, and no salt.  The avocado is likely from a frozen bag. Was taken off bill Received sour ranch dressing.  Finally brought out fresh 10 minutes later.  Just an apology Wife's sandwich had a rock hard avocado on it.  Was taken off the bill. Finally they would honor an advertised $1 unlimited soda deal because I didn't ask for the deal.  Given everything sucked and had to be sent back I was a bit distracted. I cannot stress enough to avoid the food here"
Jennifer B.,"Gainesville, VA",0,6,,4.0,6/25/2017,"Deep dish pizza is very good, and the Parmesan crusted chicken is to die for. The service can be slow depending on the server, seems like they put to many tables on one server sometimes.  But the food is worth the wait and the beverages are great!"
Shara R.,"Gainesville, VA",0,15,,4.0,11/10/2017,"Fun place!  Menu is huge, lots of options to choose from.  Offer lots of their own beers, including seasonal flavors.  Prefer to sit in the bar area, no wait for a table.  Service is good.  Think typical bar food and atmosphere.  Worth a visit."
Giselle W.,"Atlanta, GA",317,159,110,1.0,1/12/2017,I believe the one in Laurel is better.... service 1/5 food 2/5 atmosphere 2/5 Parking there was confusion around there promotional. Ambiance was there kinda felt crowded and tooo open
Marcia H.,"Charlottesville, VA",7,20,6,5.0,9/20/2017,"Heading to Gainesville to meet my sibs for dinner I wasn't sure what to expect.  Yelp rating was only 3 stars.  Well, our experience was great!!  Great food, service and atmosphere.  ""Brook C"" was friendly, attentive and helpful...could not have asked for better.  We spent about two hours eating and talking.  Never felt rushed, always felt they were happy we were there.  As a bonus, the (manager?) was kind enough to take our group picture, marking the occasion (our late parents' 72nd Anniversary).  Thanks!!"
Dave S.,"Vienna, VA",20,34,1,3.0,8/26/2017,"We go here pretty frequently, but have noticed a trend of the service getting worse. Tonight, we waited for about 20 minutes before our server even came to our table. Then our appetizers showed up with our entrees.  The food was good, the server was nice, but very slow and didn't check in on us. Overall, on a downward trend. I hope management reads this and gets their kitchen staff in order."
Andra G.,"Warrenton, VA",0,7,,1.0,9/10/2017,"Came back in to watch football today as BJs is advertising happy hour during football games. Place was empty and not all TVs were working. When asked to put football on the third TV in the bar area they put on professional bull riding. Wrong CBS channel. No one cares or checks.   The quality of food continues to be a hit or miss. Most often it's a miss. Tonight the ribs were dry, burnt and had no flavor. All of the flavor and fat had been rendered off of them almost as if they had been dropped into a fryer. They tasted greasy. The ribs when prepared well are great here. Unfortunately the quality control in the kitchen has dropped significantly."
Elizabeth L.,"Manassas, VA",0,8,,3.0,9/21/2017,"The service and food here were both decent, I was expecting more since the menu was so large but everything felt like a more upscale applebee's. Probably will not return unless just to grab a drink."
Sarah T.,"Centreville, VA",9,34,4,2.0,12/4/2016,"Service was inexcusably slow. We were seated for 15 minutes before a waitress took our drink order. And then we had to wait another 30 minutes for our food. We ordered the seared ahi salad, which tasted fine, and the cherry chipotle glazed salmon, which was overcooked and tough. Time and money would be better spent at a GAR."
Luis G.,"Manassas, VA",86,19,5,5.0,1/16/2017,"Been here a couple of times already and both times I called ahead.  I suggest to do that because this place can get really busy and will have a long wait.  This time...I took my girlfriend for her birthday.  The food was really good.  I ordered the Bison burger. That was really good.  I thought it would come with fries, but it came with coleslaw.  She ordered special tacos.  I forgot what it was. I think it was chicken.  We also shared a Santa Fe salad. That was really good.  The cool thing about this place is that they have their own app.  You can do reservations, pay your bill, order for take out, and earn rewards points to earn and redeem them."
Rocky J.,"Bristow, VA",1,6,,4.0,3/22/2017,"BJ's is a wonderful place for all! Families, Business dinners, prom nights, etc. I personally would recommend this place over any of the other establishments in the Promenade.  First, the environment is very relaxing, but positive with the friendly greetings when you first walk in, to the comforting service you receive from the waiters. BJ's is one of a kind and I don't think you can get much better in Gainesville Virginia, and I only say that because there's only a few places like this around the area.  The reason why I give BJ's four stars instead of five is because of some of the items on the menu, first let me start of with the Pindina. It has to be the worst item on the menu, the wrap was soggy and that's from the horrible cheese, and chicken that's put inside. The ranch dressing that was put inside of the wrap over powered the taste of the greasy burnt chicken and it made the wrap somewhat bearable to eat. Another reason I gave it four stars is because sometimes the Pizookie's are burnt, I mean the cookie that's the base is totally burnt and you can't cut it or eat it. Other than that they're usually very good, you just have to be lucky and hope that there's a great chef in the kitchen the night you go.  The best things on the menu (My personal opinion) would be there handcrafted burgers, or there fresh salads. With every bite you can taste the wonderful flavors of the burger and it's the type of flavors that will never bore you. That goes with the salads as well, they taste so fresh, and they put the right amount of dressing so your salad will never be dry or taste bland. BJ's will also give you more than enough food, and that goes for both burgers and salads. By the time you leave you won't want to eat again for weeks!"
Fernando U.,"Gainesville, VA",68,182,61,3.0,11/19/2016,"I try to eat at locally owned establishments but I can't help liking BJ's.  Their menu is incredibly wide which is good when you don't know exactly what you want.  Their house beer is delicious and have a great variety of it.  I've been to several BJ's and have enjoyed their food.  This time I had a chicken barbacoa plate and it was good.  Somewhat bland but that's to be expected at a chain.  Ultimately, the wide menu and beer is good enough reason to visit."
Karl B.,"Centreville, VA",22,231,20,4.0,12/17/2016,"We had a nice, comfortable lunch in mid-afternoon. It is a large, attractive restaurant. Our hamburgers were very good. Next time I will try some other dish. The pizookies are great."
T B.,"Haymarket, VA",14,43,10,2.0,11/17/2016,"I've eaten here more than 15 times.  I stopped going about a year ago because the quality of the food was god-awful.  Burgers...very inconsistent.  Service....very inconsistent...some of the nicest servers ever...and some of the grumpiest least-attentive servers ever. My kids love the corndog kids meal which is why we go there occasionally....because we love our kids. The flatbread pizzas and dry, overdone, disgusting.   I got a burger and fries last night.  Burger was average.  But fries were obviously fried a while ago.  How hard is it to throw fries in made-to-order? Positive...the decor and the look of the restaurant is very nice.   Positive...the pizooki is a great dessert item. so my suggestion...go somewhere else for dinner...stop in for a drink before, or a pizooki after.  But skip the meal there.  It's the worst."
Tamara D.,"Manassas, VA",0,3,1,1.0,6/9/2017,The absolute worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant!!! The wait time was long. The service was terrible and the food absolutely horrible. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to my worst enemy!!! The general manager had an attitude from hell because I complained about his staff serving my child old fruit!!! I had to give at least one star!!! Didn't want to!!!!
sissy o.,"Haymarket, VA",2,62,1,5.0,11/14/2016,"I love this restaurant that I believe is named after BJs wholesale warehouse (located nearby). If not, sorry guys! This place has a very welcoming aura- the bar is nice and long, the draft beer selection is amazing, and the flatbreads are great. I always enjoy myself and so do the people I take there- old and young alike. I've been there three times; and even though its located in a terrible suburban crazy mixed land use shopping megaplex (Gainesville VA) it is fine going there off hours. I found out this is actually a chain of restaurants - no relationship to BJs the warehouse. Still love it very much!"
