Journey L.,"Bristow, VA",0,34,7,3.0,6/14/2016,"Good food! Huge menu. Wait staff ok. Didn't like being seated near restrooms but will ask for different table next time. Noisy due to high ceiling but at least was able to converse with my clients at lunch on my last visit. Update 7/9/2017- Have returned here several times since my initial visit. Biggest problem still remains. The wait staff still needs training. It took at least 20 minutes to bring our salads after ordering our entire meal selections. Wasn't finished with the salads and there was our main course! I would have liked to have eaten the salad first, dishes cleared before my main course is delivered. The food itself was good but some work is needed on presentation. Overall, I am still leaving it at 3 stars simply until management gets training put in place. I DO know what I am speaking of because I have a degree in hospitality management and dining is a big part of course work. Additionally, my parents used to own a large seafood and steakhouse for 12 years. I am hoping that management will see this review and put some changes in place. With so many wonderful restaurants in NoVA, it's easy to go elsewhere."
Jonathan N.,"Bristow, VA",233,10,19,4.0,7/19/2015,"Everything was exceptional nothing mind blowing or amazing for a 5 star rating service is always super slow, no host it seems like, servers are friendly enough. Great beer selections food is good for the price can't complain, always have a decent time we chose here because UNOs in Manassas was closed their website said midnight then they told us 11 was when they actually closed so disappointing but we can always count on BJ if nothing else."
Steve A.,"Gainesville, VA",18,2,,1.0,6/18/2015,Absolutely horrible service tonight. Do not go here. They either need more help or need to hire better help.
Kelly H.,"Gainesville, VA",48,23,4,5.0,5/21/2014,"I must say I absolutely love this place!  It's a newer restaurant that recently opened up in the Gainesville area and I have been pleasantly surprised with the service each time we go. My first experience was for happy hour - great deals on drinks, the appetizers all tasted amazing (my favorite is their flat bread pizzas) and, although it can get a bit crowded as can be expected with any new bar, the service was relatively quick and super friendly! We then went for my birthday dinner and that sealed the deal for me - the food is just spectacular!  You do need to call ahead, especially on Friday or Saturday nights, but they are super organized and were able to get our party of 6 right to a table soon after arrival.  Overall this place is awesome, completely affordable and I always have a great time whenever we go!"
Justin M.,"Chantilly, VA",0,17,4,5.0,7/4/2016,Bj's BrewHouse always has great beer and excellent food with a menu that compares with cheese cake factory... We frequent the place and are members of their rewards club. We recently paid them a visit and were delighted to have unbelievable service from a server we have never had before. It's was comparable to a 4-5 star location. We hope they keep him and more quality staff to really make the place stand out amount the other choices in the shopping center.
Renee G.,"Manassas, VA",0,2,,1.0,6/30/2016,We waited an hour to have our order taken. Another 45 minutes for our food to come. It was tepid and dry. Steak should have been medium it was well. Sent it back. It came back well a second time with some excuse about their marinade turning the meat gray. It was a Wednesday! The restaurant was half empty. I have been here several times but this was my last.
Stephanie J.,"Burke, VA",234,393,246,3.0,2/17/2014,"A great addition to the Gainesville restaurant market that specializes in large chains.  One of the most notable facets of BJ's is their extensive offering of, well, everything. The menu is more like a book and there is certainly something for everyone. The wine and beer offerings are extensive and they offer full bar service too. While the restaurant was noisy the atmosphere was friendly and the service was efficient. It reminded me very much of a Great American Restaurant. We had the cookie dessert and wine during our recent visit, both were excellent. We sat in the bar area because the wait for a table seemed as if it would be long (we were told 45 minutes). However, the bar area has tables and booths with exceptional wait service so we were not inconvenienced or off put at all. BJ's seems to be one of the better chains and I will visit again to review a more extensive selection of the menu."
Karen M.,"Ashburn, VA",54,261,10,3.0,2/22/2014,"I did a little skip of joy when I heard BJ's hit Northern VA. I have many fond memories of the various BJ's in Southern CA. BJ's where I had my first legal beer at 21, where I learned what a growler is, what bruschetta is, had many good times with friends...the list goes on.  Just as I have evolved in the last 15 years, so has the food. It used to be pizza, burgers, nachos...now there are many more healthy options with salads, lighter sandwiches and such.  The deep dish pizza is still on the menu and the beer is still the same with 2 new additions and few seasonal's thrown in.   The fiance and I came for dinner and had over an hour wait to get a table. This location just opened so some of the servers were still being trained and you can tell some of the staff is still in the learning curve phase.  We wanted to chill out at the bar while waiting for our table, but there was a couple steps to get up to the bar.  We asked the hostess if there was a ramp to get up to the bar at the back of the restaurant (we couldn't see from the front door). She said no, we'd have to go back outside through the Take Out door which had a ramp. So, we went back outside, around and came back in. When we got to the bar it was pretty crowded, there seemed to be a lot of confusion and the bartenders weren't really paying attention to the customers.  Finally after about 5 minutes someone finally came over and said they were in the middle of a shift change.  Probably could be coordinated a little better.   When our table was ready we went back outside through the Take Out door, back in through the front door and were seated at a table in the back of the restaurant. I had the Ahi Tuna salad and thought it was quite good.  The fiance had a chicken sandwich and said it was ok. He got a Pizookie (the baked cookie) to go.  As we were leaving, near the bathrooms in the back, we saw there IS a ramp to get up to the bar inside. Sigh.  Anyway, I think this location needs a bit more time to work the kinks out, but overall it was decent and I'll be back!"
Liz H.,"Fredericksburg, VA",0,21,42,4.0,8/10/2014,"Came with a party of 9. We called in advance. When we arrived we were told 20 mins. It took them 35 to seat us but the hostesses were great to put up with us.  Free Wifi is a bonus!  The waitress did an amazing job putting up with my family.  Food was decent, however prep/kitchen slow, but for a packed restraint and young/new staff it was pretty impressive."
Bj L.,"Gainesville, VA",56,143,,4.0,1/28/2014,"Solid 4.5 stars. Attended the soft opening with a set menu and was very impressed! They have a great drinks list, a combination of local beers, national and international, and their own brews.The mixed drinks look great and they have several ciders and fruit beer options. Prices are very reasonable. Artichoke appetizer with lemon aioli was fantastic, batter was light and fresh. Mains were shrimp scampi (huge portions, slightly dry--ask for extra scampi butter) and meatball deep dish pizza (Spicy and tasty, though the tomato was a little acidic). The portions are HUGE!  Servers were fantastic and you'd never know this was a dry run.  I can't wait to sample more of the menu! Welcome to Gainesville, BJs!"
Tim G.,"Gainesville, VA",3,19,4,4.0,5/20/2014,"So I likes the place, I just had the hardest time drying to figure out what type of atmosphere they are going for. All that aside it's a nice place that caters to all walks of life. Speaking of walking I'm a self professed light weight and having said that I had two of their house brews the first one was the HopStorm. The first sip was great the bitter after taste, yeah not so much! BUT if bitterness is your thing than HopStorm is up your alley. Just remind me to not hang around you. Bitter people just don't work with me.   My second brew was the Harvest Hefeweizen. (My auto correct finished that for me) ok so I like that much better and it came as a recommendation from out Server. Two thumbs up my man!  I actually ate too. I had the crispy jalapeño burger. Hmmmm? Not so sure I know what I think about it. My burger was good but ya know I wasn't digging those skinny ass fries. Next time I will try the wedge fries.  Yup I said next time because I don't have anything really bad to say. Nice atmosphere although again can't figure out the ""theme"" the wait staff was pretty good too."
Jerry S.,"Haymarket, VA",0,3,,1.0,9/12/2015,"Stopped into BJ's tonight to grab a salad to go. Ordered it from the bar staff while chatting with friends. Took an hour to get it and despite that ridiculous time to get a salad, the order was wrong. How can they mess up a grilled chicken salad? Tonight confirmed what I've felt the last few times I've been there. Horrible service. Horribly mismanaged. Thankfully there are now lots of other choices if where to go in Gainesville now. I won't be back."
Matt H.,"Ashburn, VA",9,296,20,3.0,3/10/2014,"Service was good, but a little slow to the point where the manager needed to come over and apologize. The pizzas were very good.  The deep dish pizza I got reminded me a lot of a Pizza Hut Pan Pizza, but the toppings were much better.  My oldest son loved his pizza too. My wife literally said, ""That was the worst burger that I've ever had.  It was greasy, the bun had too much butter, and it just was not good.  Who butters a hamburger bun, especially that much?""  The string cut fries were good though. We also got an appetizer that had a little bit of everything and it was very good.  My Dad enjoyed his 2 beers, and the house Root Beer was good too. It's a nice place, but not some place I'll crave to go to.  Take Out for pizza would be good."
Yolanda M.,"Metairie, LA",0,4,,2.0,11/21/2015,"Here for a birthday celebration. We had to wait unnecessarily when there were empty tables, the hostesses are ditzy, and the ladies restroom was filthy. BJ'S needs to get it together."
Lucy C.,"Bluemont, VA",0,10,,2.0,4/18/2016,"Service is friendly but slow. Food and drinks are just ok, which begs the question why one would have to wait 45 minutes to be seated WITH a reservation..."
Kyle F.,"Germantown, MD",3,164,28,2.0,5/28/2015,"Been there twice, the last time I visit BJ's.  The food is typical American Bar with a select number of beers.  The food is overpriced for quality of food and atmosphere.  If you like bar food and don't want to miss the game, this place is definitely for you."
Bryce J.,"Springfield, VA",71,6,,5.0,5/10/2015,"Obsessed with this place. Their Honey Crisp Chicken Salad is amazing and I find myself craving it all the time! Prices are reasonable too. Great for date night, late night dinner with friends or lunch with girlfriends. One of my favorite restaurants on the strip."
Lauren S.,"Warrenton, VA",63,66,16,3.0,3/18/2014,"I went here during the pre-opening training week, so I have to be kind, I will update the review when I do.  Food- really good. I had the avacado egg roll appetizer. Yum! Beer - excellent! But, staff - needed training, to be expected. I'm sure this will be a great place one they all get trained up.  I love the decor. They have what looks like beautiful copper kegs ? to make beer in but I asked the manager about them and she told me that they don't actually brew there. :-(. Weird.  I ordered a steak salad. Good dressing. But they totally overlooked my med-rare steak to shoe leather. I never send food back, but felt an obligation to as they're learning. I received another order, which. (Because it took do long) I took home. The second time it was just right. The manager informed me that it was coming off the menu anyway. This was also weird because I think its important for the kitchen to know how to cook meat to order.  Again, this was the training period. Because the food was so good (though the execution needed help) I would recommend the place, in time."
Jim R.,"Magnolia, DE",0,1,1,2.0,11/7/2015,"Wow....30 minute wait turned into an hour and half wait.  I get being busy, but being told ""5 more minutes"" four times and ""we're setting your table up now"" three other times just is not right.  Can't even rate the food as I'm still waiting to be seated.  Smells good though, I guess that's something."
Alex K.,"Killeen, TX",0,19,,3.0,3/7/2016,"Food seems over priced for what it is to me, lots of draft beers but thats not my thing.  Service was slow.  It was ok dont think I will be returning."
