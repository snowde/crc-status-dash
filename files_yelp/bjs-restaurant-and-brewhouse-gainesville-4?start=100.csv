The male waitress was in la la land. I went w husband,  in another time Not to please.. I won't be there costumer any more.."
erin B.,"Centreville, VA",2,30,1,1.0,10/12/2015,"What a disappointment. I loved this place when I lived in San Diego, was my weekly go to spot. This place is a shit show plain and simple. I've tried it three times now, and their opening week was another than it is now.  Ijust attempted to order a sandwich to go, and apparently that's frowned upon. At least you would think so after it took 10 minutes just to get the bartenders attention in between her hissy fits at the service bar area. She then directed me to the to go area, where I stood for another 5 until I had to grab a hostess to find someone to take my order. And then when she finally showed up, you would have thought I asked her to donate her liver. She didn't even look at me just asked what I wanted and kept doing something else until she handed me a receipt. And I stupidly tipped her! I was in the restaurant business for several years, this place needs a major overhaul on their staff and some serious customer service training."
Monica P.,"Washington, DC",89,17,,1.0,7/14/2016,"Heed the bad reviews. Terrible. Definitely do not eat there, ever, no matter how long the line at Uncle Julio's is."
Leah T.,"Bristow, VA",0,11,3,3.0,4/26/2016,The host stand is a big issue. Such rude girls with bad attitudes. Not a good first impression. You can tell they don't care about their jobs. The food is pretty good for the most part. Sometimes it does come out cold. And the service is always bad. Especially in the bar cocktail area. Every time I go I get a different server and each and every single one of them act like they don't care about anything. Lots of bad attitudes. Not a friendly place.
M M.,"Bristow, VA",0,5,,1.0,2/22/2017,"This morning my neighbors house caught on fire and they lost everything. this is a family with 4 children and I know this is very stressful for all of them. I went to local businesses to ask for donations of gift cards. I walked into BJ's Brewhouse thinking I have been her several times and I'm sure they will offer something. well to my surprise I was told NO. This family lives, shops, and eats in this community and to be told they can't offer anything to a family in need is very sad. I will be taking my family to other restaurants in the area. Thanks for nothing...."
Sean K.,"Orlando, FL",6,53,,2.0,1/17/2016,"My rating of two stars for this location, unfortunately, is due to the service at this location. I was here with a coworker on business and this was his recommendation, due to familiarity with the brand. Unfortunately, the experience here was not to expectations. Despite the restaurant appearing mostly empty (weekday night), it took a while between being seated and having a waiter come by. It appeared that there were not enough servers scheduled for even the relatively small turnout that night, but it lead to comments from my coworker regarding the service. The food itself was decent and not at a terrible price. The decor is also very upscale looking, reflecting the particular area this restaurant is in. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to make up for the issues we encountered. Some other reviews here mention the service - it seems inconsistent, so I think making improvements there would improve the overall experience tremendously."
Jodie C.,"Warrenton, VA",29,436,1316,4.0,6/14/2015,"Looking hidious from a sweaty hike earlier, we went here for a late lunch. Sat at the table....looked around...Last persons ticket was still on the table(booth). We were so so thirsty and no one came around. Finally, our waiter arrived. Took drink orders. He was very nice. Funny even. Ice-Tea was really good. Waiter came back and we ordered our app.- spinach stuffed mushrooms. They were really good but.....where are the plates? We were so hungry we didn't wait for him to come back, we just ate... one last mushroom left and he asks if we need plates. :-)  - I ordered the french dip with thin fries. My friend got the parmesian chicken with mased potatoes and asparagus.  - I was absolutely happy with my french dip...oops. I mean Roast Beef dip. That's what it's called on the menu. I finally found one that was not only good enough to eat but one that knocked me outta the park. Awesome! Fries were delightful.  - My friend loved the parmesian chicken and of course I took some bites. The mashed potatoes were really good.  ------I must add that the wait for the food was quite long. We laughed about how this place was getting 3 stars before we even taste the food because of the wait for everything. Between our app and our meal, our waiter DID come by twice and apologize for the wait. He said it was perhaps a shift change. Let me say...from my point of view..he got his stars back because he did come apologize twice... he didn't just ignore us until our food was ready so we appreciated that."
Kim L.,"Gainesville, VA",13,49,98,3.0,11/13/2014,The Santa Fe salad was good but not an omg I need to have that again! Why classy places like this use iceberg lettuce is beyond me. The lettuce was a bit limp.  I do recommend the 130 calorie Cosmo though
Natalie J.,"Washington, DC",4,9,,4.0,2/17/2016,"OK food that is overpriced. Had a salad, not good not bad We have eaten at a number of BJ's in different parts of the U.S. and this BJ's is the best. The food is tasty, the service is friendly, the restaurant is clean The menu is so large it takes a while to get through unless you been there before"
Kerri M.,"Gainesville, VA",33,122,38,4.0,9/30/2015,"Had drinks and appetizers here for a celebration and I loved this place. Food was good, drinks had a bit too much alcohol for me, but my friends had no complaints"
S K.,"Manhattan, NY",53,189,44,2.0,5/12/2016,"If you want something EXTRA salty go have their jumbalaya. You wont be disappointed. Just overall, The food isnt' that great here.."
Sarah H.,"Manassas, VA",0,15,,4.0,8/1/2016,Only been here once but my husband and I had a really good experience.  The atmosphere was very nice and we both enjoyed our food.  We got the Parmesan crusted chicken and the steak.  The prices were a little high but we both enjoyed our meal.  I would definitely go back.
Kevin L.,"Gainesville, VA",0,5,2,4.0,7/31/2016,"If you would like a place to eat with family or friends then this is the place. Unfortunately it does take a long time for the food to come, but it is so worth it. But, if you come through the doors starving then I would not recommend to come here, if not then definitely try the chicken alfredo."
Rick G.,"Gainesville, VA",24,32,14,2.0,9/22/2015,"Seriously, I feel like a Salmon swimming upstream coming to this place.  It's a brew house that seldom can pull-off the task of delivering a ""brew"" in anything even remotely resembling a timely fashion.  To top it off, I ordered the Tatonka for the bizillionth time and big surprise, no Tatonka!!!  In fact they have NEVER had TA-Frickin-Tonka, ever....it's a mythical beer.... I came back, it's a Tuesday and......Tatonka!! Finally, oh you smooth frothy vixen I have waited so long and you do not disappoint!  Wait, somebody pinch me...."
S A.,"Charlottesville, VA",0,18,,2.0,12/20/2016,"Just ok. I won't go back. The burger was too salty - I have tasted better. Staff are nice but kept pushing some discount card or frequent user card at EVERY moment - first the person who sat us, then the wait staff. Geez, enough with the promos."
Jeff P.,"Gainesville, VA",6,20,,4.0,6/15/2016,"Decent food, nice atmosphere....like going there."
Brandy W.,"Bristow, VA",1,4,1,3.0,4/28/2015,"I've been to dine for lunch on four occasions.  I always found the food to be delicious. However, my one complaint is that on each occasion we found service to be very slow, even when the restaurant was empty.  We often had to ask multiple Times for items such as condiments, etc as the servers seem to forget our requests.  Additionally, on two occasions my salad came out with no dressing or my burger came out without the mustard that comes as a standard dressing.  But the food is good so I will give it another try."
Alena C.,"Manassas, VA",32,17,2,5.0,8/3/2015,"Decided to stop in for a late lunch of course it wasn't busy. I had a great server Crystal B.   who came by several times, and never let my glass get empty. One of my three pet peeves when eating out. I had the Pesto Chicken Sandwich and BerryBusrt Cider. The food was great and loved the cider! I'm bummed I had no room for a Pizzokie, which is usually a must when dinning here.  My dinning experience has also been very good at this location. You couldn't give my any amount of money to return to the Tyson's location. I heard the wait here can be a bit longer at times, but never enough for me that I'd give a negative review. I also love their app especially when reserving a table, take out or even paying. I'll definitely be back!  Bon Appétit!"
Katie S.,"Springfield, VA",507,823,4852,3.0,3/3/2014,"Came here Saturday night for drinks for a friend's birthday and overall had a good time.  The bar area was CRAZY busy both with people waiting for tables and people that we doing exactly what we were doing. We waited for a little bit and a high top opened up and we grabbed it.  After fighting to get to the bar we were all pretty happy to have a dedicated server.  Our Server came over and took our order and everything was great for a while. Then about an hour or so into being there, she disappeared. Our food came out and she came to check on us and acted annoyed that we wanted more drinks.  About another hour into that a couple of our other friends showed up and one of them asked for a Bud light...apparently this annoyed her even further and she told my gf they didn't serve Bud light. However, since the guy at the table next to us had one, I went up to the bartender and asked. And wouldn't you know...  they do serve it!  In fact, the bartender asked why I thought they wouldn't; so I told her and she rolled her eyes and said she was sorry when I pointed to our server.  I'm not sure what that was all about. But it didn't matter, apparently our server got cut for the night and asked us to close out almost immediately after.  So we moved over to the bar and had a good time the rest of the time we were there. Server experience aside, the place is beautiful and they have a really great selection of beers. The food we ordered was good as far as aps go.  I think this place will do just fine once they get over the growing pains other yelpers have described. Perhaps that is all that was going on with our server?  Who knows."
Katherine M.,"Haymarket, VA",112,1,1,5.0,12/28/2015,"My family and I ate here for dinner around 6:30 so it was packed. We made 3 seats at the bar work and Julia, the bartender, was amazing. Our appetizer, Sriracha and queso dip and chips, was out in well under 10 minutes and was absolutely delicious! It wasn't spicy at all so be warned if that's what you're expecting from it. My fresh mozzarella and tomato salad was the best I have ever had. You could taste how fresh the basil and tomatoes were and it had just the right amount of everything! Right after we had finished those our main entrees were in front of us in only 5 minutes. For dessert we had their 3 salted caramel mini Pizookies and they were the perfect dessert size for 3 individuals not to mention they tasted like little pieces of heaven! We were full and happy with plenty of time to spare for our movie! I only wish I had known that BJs sells movie tickets for $8.50 rather than the outrageous $12.50 cost at the theater itself because we had already purchased our tickets online  Great service, amazing food, and a fun restaurant to experience!"
