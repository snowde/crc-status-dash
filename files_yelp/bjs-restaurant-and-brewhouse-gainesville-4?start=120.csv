Audrena M.,"Vienna, VA",0,11,2,1.0,5/28/2017,"The WORST BJs experience ever! First off, we ordered an appetizer because there was a coupon online for one free appetizer with the purchase of 9.95 entree. The waitress then begins to tell me I cannot use my coupon without being a rewards member(BS). I then tell her I'll go ahead and download the app so I did and BOOM what do you know(same coupon as before). So at this point I'm just like okay whatever. It takes the waitress 45 minutes to bring us our appetizer. The table behind us was received their food and packed their to go boxes before our APPETIZER came out. So at this point I'm very agitated . I get another waiters attention because our waitress apparently forgot about us. Long story short she brings us the appetizer with no apology or reason as to why it took so long. Well, 5 minutes later our food comes out. I ordered the salmon pita taco with fries. It must've just been sitting out because my food and my dads food both came out cold and soggy. The fries were stale and cold. The tacos were literally the MOST DISGUSTING thing I've ever eaten. They were cold too, It had an odd sweet taste. They added cold slaw which smelled like the dumpster out back. The salmon was dry and bland. The strawberry lemonade was decent but it was wayyy too sweet. Needless to say after my long rant, that I will not be returning here. Go to BJs in Tyson its way better."
Tami W.,"Manassas, VA",0,32,5,3.0,5/17/2016,"Atmosphere and beer was good but my Santa Fe Chicken Salad was not!  Cold, tasteless chicken thrown on cold lettuce, tomatoes, avocado, cheese with not so great dressing mixed in... Waitress had recommended this salad so I didn't want to really complain about how awful it was but surprised she didn't even ask why I hadn't even ate half when she cleaned off our table.  Someone else at our table ordered a brisket burger which they said was good, another got the  club sandwich which was good too but I just haven't much luck here in entree choices - last time I had pasta which was pretty terrible too.  Perhaps they should cut back on the huge menu selection and instead focus on making a smaller offering good.  Also make sure you ask about beer prices, we were surprised to find out that we were paying $6.50 a beer on draft!"
Kelly K.,"Reston, VA",258,1638,1220,3.0,2/18/2014,"Spacious restaurant with a nice vibe although the music was a little too loud for my taste. It was packed last Sunday at lunch. We managed to get a seat in the bar area. Our waiter provided better than average service. The food was tasty though nothing seemed fresh made. Rather it was like upscale fast food. I tried the fish tacos and it seemed like frozen fish sticks with prefab lettuce, cabbage and cilantro that had no flavor.  Prices vary from reasonable to a bit pricey. The half rack BBQ was 17.95 which was pricey. It came with a small serving of tasty beans and a side order of choice."
Avi A.,"Fairfax, VA",14,9,,1.0,2/15/2016,Most ridiculous place. Bad service. I don't think they will make it in the food Busines.
Hall S.,"Leesburg, VA",0,10,4,4.0,11/28/2015,The food was great and the drinks were great. Atmosphere is so chill. The only thing i would probably recommend is a food runner for the bar area only.
David A.,"Bristow, VA",108,99,26,4.0,5/28/2015,"Bj's continues to be a great place to go for a family meal.   We go every now and then during the week.   They have good draft brews and sodas.   Their pizza is definitely their go to.   Service can be slow at times,  however if you are fortunate to get Janett she does a great job.   The smores pizookie is a good dessert."
Sonja G.,"Centreville, VA",0,1,,1.0,7/27/2016,"This was the worst service I have ever experienced! The waiter was rude and the older lady that delivered the food, pretty much threw it on our table. It took nearly 45 minutes to receive our order (with children ). I rarely pay with cash but wanted to use what I had in my purse. When the waiter gave the check, he wouldn't return to the table to get change. I kept waving to him but he just kept ignoring me. We finally had to get a waitress to get his attention. I tipped him anyway simply because I believe in tipping but I will never go back! I have also discouraged anyone else from eating there. I am only giving it a star because the system won't except zero stars."
Robert L.,"Charlottesville, VA",1,16,4,5.0,6/8/2016,Love this place! Love the ribs! And the beer selection. And that they let me try new beers before I decide on one or the other. And they do have separate menu for GF. Active atmosphere! Excellent for large groups.
E B.,"Manassas, VA",1,37,,2.0,12/3/2016,"Last night we were meeting a friend for dinner (3 in our party).  We were told it was going to be about a 30-40 minute wait.  We had a drink from the bar while we waited.  When we were seated about 40 minutes later, we were greeted by the waiter (Bryan S. - he never gave us his name, but it was on our check), and he told us that he would be back in 5 minutes, as he was busy.  He came back took our drink orders and a short time later delivered our drinks- and then took our food and appetizer orders.  Our meals were delivered - and there seemed to be some confusion if it came to our table or not.  We found out it was our meals, but the appetizer had not been delivered, we were a bit puzzled.  When our waiter came back to the table, I told him to cancel the appetizer.  Shortly after that, a food runner brought our appetizer.  We were looking for our waiter, as he had not delivered any plates to our table for the appetizer and pizza.  We eventually flagged him down and he brought us plates.   When the bill came, we showed him the app on my phone that had a BOGO free entree.  He did take it off the bill, but not the appetizer.  Being with a friend, I did not want to cause any comfortableness for him, so I avoided requesting the manager.  In total, with the bar bill, our total came to about $100.  We did tip him 20% - as I don't believe it was totally his fault that we had a less than satisfactory experience at BJ's.  Needless to say, I will be hesitant to return or to recommend BJ's, a local establishment near our work and home.  Is this the standard for BJ's?"
Nicole D.,"Hightstown, NJ",9,38,15,3.0,6/28/2015,"Decent food in a decent atmosphere. While My food was good, it was nothing to rave about. The menu is extensive which can be overwhelming in the best of circumstances, but it also isn't organized in a particularly helpful fashion. It's good for a decent meal at a decent price, but there are other restaurants in the immediate area that looked interesting and I would definitely go to them before heading back here."
Sean C.,"Chantilly, VA",0,5,,2.0,11/27/2016,The staff and service here is terribly slow. Food isn't bad but the service just make me avoid the place
Samir S.,"Alexandria, VA",76,49,34,2.0,3/26/2016,"The beer was good, the food was pretty forgettable. We tried the avocado egg rolls, a sub par copy of the Cheesecake Factory appetizer. The pizza reminded me of a higher end frozen pizza with a chewy crust. Not very good. The pasta with asparagus hardly had any asparagus in it. $66 dollars (tip included) for a meal we regretted ordering. Service was also pretty lackluster. We won't be back."
CL H.,"Washington, DC",24,78,16,3.0,3/26/2016,"Went for lunch on a weekend and seated quickly (after having to sit for a long promotion of their app by the hostess -- not good timing, but I realize company probably requires her to push it hard). Our waitress -- wish I could remember her name -- was wonderful: attentive without interrupting a great deal. The food was good, not amazing for what we had. Loved the sourdough bread bowl with tomato basil. Tomato and mozzarella salad was ok, but not how I prefer it prepared. Boyfriend had a club sandwich that was adequate, and fries were good (took some time for requested ketchup). Curious to try some of the brews, and the dessert. But enjoyed the berry hard cider. Great for lunch; not sure I'd pay for dinner pricing. It's what's to be expected for a chain."
Taranjeet S.,"Manassas, VA",0,11,5,4.0,12/5/2015,"I have been here multiple times and only after this I am posting this review.  When it comes to restaurant, there are few factors which are considered for rating, which are as below: - Ambience -It is very positive and upscale, no issues here. Restaurant is very CLASSY - Wait time - Always some kind of wait time, especially on the weekend. 25-45 min - Bar - It is nice bar - Service -Here is where problem is, waiters and waitresses are well trained and give positive vibe however MANAGER's issue is he/she is scheduling them short on a busy weekend. I can understand that they need to keep expenses in check for meeting targets and goals but I can clearly see waiters running around like crazy. They are managing large number of tables with huge seating. Please Please schedule more staff in busy hours. Service is very slow as couple times I waited 20 minutes for a refill. Not acceptable as they are working very hard but are outnumbered by issues.  - FOOD -It is very acceptable, we go there for avocado egg rolls. Man they are awesome.  - Price -Very acceptable for the area.  Bottom Line: Food is nice but service is taking ratings down. Please schedule more waiters during busy times and do not be cheap and over work your staff. It only kills your ratings, their confidence and TIP."
A A.,"Falls Church, VA",8,143,3,1.0,11/29/2014,"BJ's Staff is terrible. From the clueless hostess who left us hanging, to the inept and untimely waitress who brought our food out cold (appetizer and entree and drinks ALL at the same time!), to the annoying obnoxious manager with bad breath - dude! nobody cares what kind of beer YOU like so shut the hell up already and let us eat in peace! And get your bad breath away from me! Ruined my meal. Pricing is a scam. Sliders are $9.95 + $1 for fries.  meat across all 4 sliders totals about 1/4 lb or less, the buns are huge for sliders it's all bun no meat! A regular burger is $7.95 with fries INCLUDED! So you tell me why there's a pricing disparity? A 1/3 lb bacon cheeseburger with fries INCLUDED is $9.75. I could continue with more examples from the encyclopedia of a menu which is way too big, but you get the point. Prices aren't accurate.  I asked for sliders. The waitress' reply was not 'would you like fries' but 'what kind of fries?"" Then when I got bill is when I discovered the pricing scam and the meat scam DO NOT ORDER SLIDERS!!!! The soup  is also another classic ripoff. Huge shallow bowl with an extra large rim to make it appear like a lot of food but when I poured it in to a cup it barely was an inch of soup! Wow so little food. Too many tricks with presentation and pricing it just isn't a place I want to deal with wondering where else I'm getting ripped off."
Donna W.,"Woodbridge, VA",107,37,9,5.0,1/6/2016,"We went on a weekend, late afternoon and had lunch in the bar area.  They were very busy, almost packed restaurant.  The service was good as was the food and drinks.  All three of us enjoyed our meals and decided we should come again."
Morgan C.,"Haymarket, VA",13,24,19,3.0,6/2/2015,"So after 2 bad experiences a manager reached out to me to give BJ's another chance.  My fiancé and I went this past Saturday 05/30/15 and I tried to call ahead for a reservation. Well they don't do reservations. They put your name on a list and hopefully you can be seen around that time (which I guess I understand). However when we got there, my name wasn't on the list (even though I called and gave my number). So we had to put our names on a list again.. Fortunately it wasn't too busy otherwise we would of just left.  We killed about 15 min and then I received a text saying that our table was ready. So we were then seated. I'm not going to lie, I hated we were sat. It was a small 2 person booth at the very front of the restaurant. Not a big deal but... So we were greeted right away by a very friendly server. Very tall skinny white guy (I can't remember his name thought). He brought us out water and we ordered the sriracha Brussel sprouts as an appetizer. They were alright. I probably wouldn't get them again though.  For dinner we decided to split the California Chicken Club which was really good. I'd definitely get it again. It was- Layered with Applewood smoked bacon, avocado, melted swiss cheese, lettuce, tomatoes and roasted garlic mayonnaise on grilled sourdough bread- copied that from their website. We also got the french fries as a side and they were the really skinny one. I was a little annoyed that we had specified that we wanted to split it and they brought it out on one plate. They didn't even bring an additional plate... So we just used the plate from our appetizer.  Our bill for those 2 things ended up being just over $17.  I'm still not sure I'm sold on this place. Might give it another shot but we'll see...."
Sam P.,"Northern, VA",6,25,17,4.0,9/19/2015,Decided to try this restaurant after a co-worker spoke highly of it.  I ordered the Brewhouse Burger and it was tasty and a huge portion! Will definitely return to try other items.
Susan B.,"Bristow, VA",76,20,2,1.0,9/11/2016,"This place is going to the dogs. The waiter sucked, the food was cold, and they charge us for a glass of wine that we did not have. The girl at the front, needs to learn how to smile.. All around it sucked."
Nicole M.,"Centreville, VA",0,7,,4.0,5/8/2016,"Atmosphere is great, my friend and I frequent this place often. The food hasn't ever blown me away, but it's always good. What I really love is their different beer blends. The Jerry Burst is delicious...cider and red ale. Definitely worth a try if you haven't been. The bar is specious and you can usually always find a spot."
