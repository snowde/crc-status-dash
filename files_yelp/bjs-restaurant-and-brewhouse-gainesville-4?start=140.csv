Babak A.,"Haymarket, VA",6,13,,1.0,12/28/2015,"How do you screw up fish tacos? You start with frozen fish, over cook it, serve it as a sloppy mosh, and charge too much!  Order a salad, I hear those are pretty edible."
Kelly Ann R.,"Jeffersonton, VA",15,32,14,1.0,12/14/2015,Food was just okay but got totally turned off by watching an employee floss their teeth while walking through the restaurant before walking back to the kitchen.
Shane B.,"MIDLAND, VA",10,69,36,4.0,1/26/2016,"I've been here several time. It's a great place for lunch and food is always great. I really like the enlightened lunch menu. It does have the feel of a franchise type place but the people are very nice. The enchilada fries are not good, that's about only thing I've had that I didn't like. The calamari is very good. Also have great flat bread pizzas. You can't go to wrong here."
Wen F.,"Gainesville, VA",51,84,117,3.0,1/8/2015,"I feel that the food here is really hit or miss, but inconsistency at a restaurant really irks me. Restaurant 101 taught me that the worst thing you can do is serve a customer a great dish and then a crap dish. While I really do enjoy their fried Calamari, Ribs, and Pzookie desserts, everything else I ordered made me wish I didn't.  I love pizza, as a native New Yorka I grew up loving getting a NY style pizza but I grew to love Chicago Deep dish as well. Hell I would eat a papa johns or even costco pizza any day, any time, I love pizza and it is personal for me. Sad to say BJ's really left me disappointed. The crust is too thick, the toppings are not sufficient especially when a large is almost $30. There is also a lack of pizza sauce, too little cheese, ugh. I've tried their Jambalaya my god it tasted like someone accidentally dropped a bottle of salt in there, I'm all for good seasoning but it was really extreme to the point where  I couldn't eat it.  Sucks I wish BJs was better, I really want our local businesses to thrive."
Mike R.,"Sterling, VA",93,235,431,4.0,11/13/2014,"Have to say, I'm impressed with BJ's restaurant and Brewhouse. We went there for a birthday dinner for my mom.  The fiance and I got there a little early, so we hit the bar for happy hour.  I was impressed with their selection of house brews.  They must have had about a dozen choices of beers they make, and I didn't even bother looking to see what else they had on tap if anything... because, well, when in Rome.... So I had the Stout, which was in my opinion, an excellent stout.  It wasn't mellow and subdued like a Guinness... it was BAM! in your face with moderate hops and you could taste the alcohol bite, while still being creamy and delicious.  Not for the faint of heart.  It was a good beer and mighty tasty... and at 8.5% abv, Lookout! I really liked how they had a good description as well as listing the ABV and IBUs for all their beers.... I like to know what I'm getting into when I order a unknown beer.  I also would like to give them credit for not bombing all their beers with tons of hops.  It seems like most of the microbrews I go to nowadays just dump hops hops hops in all their beers and have like 100 IBU.  BJ's had a lot of beers with light to moderate IBUs with only their IPA being really heavy on the hops, like it should be. Anyhow, this isn't all about the beer.  We still have dinner to worry about.   First, let me start off the dinner portion of my review with a big shoutout to SAM our waiter.  He was awesome.  He did a great job putting up with our large party including kids and indecisiveness.  We never felt rushed despite us taking a long time to decide on our orders as well as lingering around after our meals were finished.  He made us feel very welcome and handled us perfectly.  He went over just about everything on the menu when he saw we were having issues selecting what we wanted out of their very extensive menu.  I mean, this place has everything from Pizza, to two different appetizer sections, to Pasta, to salads, to steak and seafood, back to burgers and fish tacos.  I mean, c'mon, if you can't find something you want to eat here, you might as well go eat corn with the cows. So I decided on the black and blue burger (with blue cheese on the side).  Speaking of which, Sam informed us that they make everything on site... so if there was ANYTHING we didn't want in any of the items, they could remove them.  That's refreshing to hear... that their food is made to order and not prepackaged or premade.  So yeah, I had the burger with the thin and crispy fries.  The fries were awesome... they were cooked perfectly.  They were what all fries should strive to be.  The burger was a solid burger.  Good for a restaurant, but could probably be outdone by a restaurant that specifically caters to burgers (ie. Melt, Rays Burgers, etc.) but I would say the burger was on par with what you would get at a restaurant that has a lot of stuff going on.  The bacon and sauce on it were both good. I also added a salad with my burger, with ranch dressing.  I have to say, the ranch was watered down and not up to par.  I'm somewhat of a ranch snob, and while it wasn't ""bad"" per se, it definitely had lots of room for improvement.  The rest of the salad was okay, if not a little on the small side.  I would probably skip it next time, frankly. My fiance got the roast beef dip sandwich, and she was not impressed.  It didn't taste like it was sliced to order.  It wasn't rare, or medium rare... or even medium looking for that matter.  It was just brown looking slices with mediocre au jus.  I had a bite and I agreed... I would pass on that dish next time.  The owners should visit a Blue Ridge Grill to find out what a french dip sandwich should be like. My sister got the kale and brussel sprout salad and added a piece of salmon.  HOLY COW, it was like a whole freaking salmon on top of her salad.  It seriously looked like the size of a brick.  I would say she got her money's worth for adding that salmon to the salad. All things considered.  I would definitely return for happy hour.  Where the beers flow for $4 and you can also get buffalo wings for $4 (5 piece).  I almost forgot, I shared some wings at the bar with my fiance, and they were solid wings.  I was a little disappointed in the bartender.  I asked her what kind of style they had for the wings... and she gave me crazy eyes like I was asking a weird question.  I was like, you know... hot/mild/bbq?  she was like, we can make them really spicy if you want....  Later, I looked at the menu, and they had like 5 different sauce choices.  Oh well, no big whoop, we had them standard-style I guess, and they were good.  Nice and crispy and came with a few pieces of celery... not bad for 4 bucks. Shoutout again to Sam.  He was the best dang server I can remember.  Best of 2014 fo' sho.  BJ's, you should give that man a raise... or a high five and a pat on the back."
Rachel A.,"Centreville, VA",262,14,2,2.0,3/26/2016,"I'm a regular at bj's and I had the worst service today at the bar. Emily H didn't pay any attention to us, took forever to take our order, and when our order came out it was the wrong thing and all she said was "" just try it you might like it"" well maybe if you didn't mess up my order we wouldn't be having this conversation. She does not care, other than that whenever I come I see a bartender named julia and she's outstanding every single time."
Martin S.,"Haymarket, VA",0,12,,3.0,9/23/2016,Service was somewhat slow.  Ordered the salmon over asparagus and the asparagus were tough and somewhat shriveled up.  Salmon was a small portion.
Beth C.,"Moody, AL",11,27,,2.0,11/22/2014,We liked BJs when it first opened but since we have had less than pleasant experiences.  The cost is too high to have inefficient service and less than tasty food.  The last experience was the worst so we likely won't be back.   We order the Ahi Poke which came unseasoned with so little avocado it was barely discernible.  The service was so bad we considered leaving before the food came.  We were ignored by wait staff and when our waiter finally came he was inefficient and barely present.  I have a loyalty card and wasn't credited for the last 3 visits.  This is it for us!  We'll never be back and won't recommend anyone put themselves through the poor service and poor food!
Gastro N.,"Bluemont, VA",0,18,5,2.0,1/7/2015,"This restaurant is high-price and should reflect that price point in the food quality and service quality. It has the potential to be excellent, but misses the mark regularly. I have been to this restaurant a half-dozen times, and have yet to have a positive experience there. Steaks are improperly cooked, every visit. The service (slow) & food (sent back at times) is always inconsistent with price. It is loud in the dining area. I would not recommend this restaurant for your mid-scale dining experience. The POSITIVE: BJ's has a great drink selection, and a bar area for drinking cocktails while waiting for your table. They also have a mobile app for the reservation system that helps the seating process.  DEEP DISH PIZZA at BJ's is what they do well, and consistently well. If you want to satiate your deep dish craving, you might still take a chance with BJ's."
Rod H.,"Gainesville, VA",8,7,4,4.0,3/19/2016,Good food great service . If you get all that in Gainesville Virginia you're doing good
Michael F.,"Gainesville, VA",0,5,,4.0,8/9/2015,"I went to BJ's for about the 6th time, since it had opened last year, a few nights ago.I am still impressed by the large menu and the many options offered. There is something for everyone! I plan on eating my way through the menu. The food taste wise is pretty great, but I feel like it is a bit too pricey for the quality and quantity. I've noticed waiting for food here can be a tad longer than expected, but worth the wait. Just grab a signature brew and dine with friends. Overall, a nice addition to Gainesville and a must try I almost forgot, The service is on par. I was seated by a friendly hostess, who greeted me warmly at the door. The energy went on to my sever, who was both professional and prompt. The location is also well maintained, and the bathrooms were clean."
Glen H.,"Bristow, VA",0,20,,3.0,4/21/2016,Not too bad.  Do not use there app it doesn't work well. A very good variety on the menu. And overall very good food.
Tina H.,"Vienna, VA",1,28,21,5.0,5/18/2015,The service was great! Food was delicious. There are  SO many options to choose from. Will definitely come back again to try something new!
Laura Jane O.,"Livingston, NJ",10,32,2,3.0,10/29/2015,"Service was great, beer was good, food was decent. Very much like a Friday's or Chilis. Nothing special, good reasonably priced lunch with quick service. OHHHH BUT THE DESSERT  shareable portions and Oh so good!! (I had the smores cookies pan cake) An easy place to grab a bite to eat."
Jim M.,"Warrenton, VA",0,65,2,3.0,3/17/2015,"Hard to believe I had to ask to get NCAA March Madness on a tv ... And then, no audio ... Just music, thank you very little.  Response: ""we only put audio on for football"" Great staff and food tho"
Emily M.,"Ashburn, VA",0,24,4,2.0,3/8/2015,Dirty silverware for the entire table = loss of a star. Why BJs?! I really really want to like you!
Jimmy S.,"Gainesville, VA",28,20,13,2.0,9/28/2014,"I go to BJs often and this is the one in my area so I go to this location frequently. Dining in is always good, though I've noticed service is getting slower, I don't know if it's the servers being lazy or the kitchen is backed up. Sometimes you can't find a server to get your check or they take forever to bring you a drink, but the food at this place is definitely worth it.  However, my worst experience was with take-out. My boss decided to buy the office lunch and ordered and i went to pick up. The girl at the counter seemed to have an attitude for no reason and just looked pissed off to be there. When we got back to the office, my boss noticed they forgot her appetizer. I called to see if they could deliver it or remove it from my boss' credit card. The girl was so rude, she was like, ""you forgot your spring rolls here."" When clearly she didn't put them in the bag. This was the worst take out experience I've had and don't plan on going down that route again."
Walt R.,"Washington, DC",10,48,10,4.0,11/13/2014,"First: never had a bad meal here... Ever! First stared going to the one in Jacksonville, FL and was very pleased by the staff, service and quality of food. Visited some in several other states and found the same good quality... They are supposedly known for their pizzas, but after well over a dozen visits have yet to try it,, so many other tempting dishes...   The best dish:  the Parmesan Crusted chicken with garlic potatoes and broccoli..! Always a crowd pleaser, HUGE portions for a reasonable price, and always enough for next day's meal... the wings are also good for an appetizer or meal, meaty with a good sauce, good heat and flavor. They brew their own beer, in the fall the Pumpkin Ale is exceptionally good... Our server in the FL restaurant suggested getting it with whipped cream and a pinch of cinnamon on it.... As unappealing as it might sound, it was anything but!! It tasted like you were drinking a piece of delicious pumpkin pie... Not a foo foo drink, but a good glass of solid fall Ale...   Solid restaurant, reasonable pricing, excellent food selection! Use the smartphone app to make a reservation and preorder appetizers/meal,  also use it and you get a discount."
Randy M.,"Warrenton, VA",17,457,11,4.0,10/9/2014,"Have eaten here twice.  Once with a group of 7 for dinner and the other lunch at the bar.  This place gets packed and the wait can get pretty long, but they do have call ahead service.  They have plenty of beers on tap and the menu is quite large.  I've had a burger and one of their pizzas, I preferred the pizza.  BJs Brewhouse is a great addition to the Gainesville area, I just hope the wait times get a little shorter. I must admit that when this place first showed up, I honestly thought it was affiliated with the BJs wholesale store on the same block."
Kayla S.,"Spanaway, WA",6,15,3,1.0,2/20/2016,The wait is ridiculous even when they are not busy. The service is awful and when you are finally seated they forget about you and you'll only get one drink 20-30 mins in and when you do finally get food it will be a completely different waiter who gives you the wrong food and will never come back. Then you have to hunt down someone to print your check that isn't even the things you've ordered. This has happened to us twice. We just moved to the area and we were hopeful that it would be just as good as the other Bjs we would go too. But sadly it isn't. Worst service I've ever had.
