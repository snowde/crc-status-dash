Joan L.,"Gainesville, VA",0,15,,3.0,9/25/2016,"BJs is okay. I thought it would be like Sweetwater, but I don't think it's as good. Sweetwater is something I crave and BJs is just okay. Not great and not bad...just okay. They offer a very extensive menu, somewhat like Cheesecake Factory, but there is nothing on their menu that I crave or look forward to having again."
Jackie W.,"Haymarket, VA",0,23,,5.0,3/31/2015,"HUGE variety of options on the menu. I recommend the corn fritters appetizer, clam chowder soup and mahi mahi tacos. We have also tried several of the pizzas and burgers and all were very good. You cannot leave without trying the S'mores Pizookie. Delicious!!! Service has always been very pleasant and prompt, fast food delivery. They have a beautiful bar area and takeout service."
Megan H.,"Gainesville, VA",1,29,7,1.0,11/2/2015,Loved this place in San Antonio. But not Gainesville!   They called us to go to our table then we waited and waited to actually get to our table. Waitress rushed us to pick drinks. Then took forever to get them back to us. We will see how the food goes but after I saw people walking out mad I'm not keeping my fingers crossed.  Well food took over an hour. Then they couldn't find my husband's. We took it to the wrong table. Then it shouldve been re cooked. Especially since he works for the health department in the navy. My steak had no flavor and was overcooked. Don't think we will be back.  It took another 30 minutes to get the check and we had no pen so we hunted down someone with one. Wait staff dropping fid and breaking glass all night. Horrible experience. What a waste of $150.
Heather W.,"Washington, DC",47,10,,4.0,2/15/2016,"Stopped in before seeing a movie. Was quickly seated at the bar. Drinks were great! I had a heaping root beer float and my boyfriend had a custom beer/cider blend that he enjoyed. Once ordered, food was out fast and was tasty. Floors are a little slippery, so be mindful."
Kiaundra J.,"Sugar Hill, GA",0,5,5,1.0,2/12/2016,"Went here once and will never return. The food food forever to come out and was cold and tasteless. The service was horrible. A pet peeve of mine is having to flag down a different waitress because yours is never in sight. I told the waitress I wanted a half sweet tea and half lemonade, she replied an Arnold's Palmer. I said yeah, but I made sure I said sweet tea because some people get it wrong. She brings back my drink and it has no sweetness what so ever. I then said the drink was horrible and had no sugar and she said oh I thought you wanted regular tea with lemonade. Moral of the story, don't cut me off being a smart a$$ and still mess up my order."
Shannon T.,"Haymarket, VA",2,40,,2.0,7/20/2016,I have never had a good experience here.  I have tried it a few times and the service is always bad and I am never impressed with the food.
Ingrid K.,"Aldie, VA",65,571,1487,5.0,11/12/2014,No messing with pagers here. They take down your mobile number and text you as soon as your table is available. Brilliant. The food and service were fantastic on Veterans Day. We appreciate the free entree for my Vet. We'll definitely be back.
Colleen B.,"Gainesville, VA",625,84,47,4.0,10/24/2014,Huge menu.  I Came for lunch and was immediately seated. I ordered the pizza and salad with the lemonade.  The pizza was just ok for a bar pie.  The salad was great and the lemonade was delicious. I will definitely come back for the pizzookie!
steve g.,"Bristow, VA",1,172,11,1.0,12/6/2015,"The service here is absolutely horrid. I went here again in September '15, just getting around to posting this review. Came here with my wife for dinner one evening. Her chicken came out under cooked, ewe, our server was too busy to come check on us, so I got up after a while and found another server, he came over and took the dish away and asked if she wanted something else, so she asked for another entree from the menu. After a long time our original server finally came back to check on us. At this point I am long done with my burger. We tell her what happened, so she goes to check on the replacement entree, she comes back about 5 minutes later with a menu and says they don't have anything for you. LOL seriously, we had been there for a full hour between the 15 minutes waiting to take the original order, 15 minutes for the food to come out, and 30 minutes after that. We weren't too happy to be sitting there for so long without proper service. She went to try and find a manager, but he was too busy to come pay us a visit. So, unfortunately I really don't think I am going to be coming back to BJ's. I have been to Uncle Julios and their service is fantastic also Firebirds has fantastic service too. I realize things are going to go wrong sometimes, but when they do there should be people that care and want to try make things right, but not here at this place, not say they are too busy. Update. Okay so they keep sending me coupons for bogo or 1/2 off pizza. Yeah I can't resist a deal. I think if you go here when it isn't so busy you will be okay. The brisket bbq burger is good. I just finally got around to trying the deep dish pizza. It was pretty good. They do cook the crust ahead of time and then stick the toppings on and cook it again. It tasted a lot different compared to the pizza I got a few years back when they first opened."
June D.,"Gainesville, VA",3,3,,1.0,7/6/2015,Went here for my birthday and it was a horrible experience. Firstly the seats were covered in food. The table was sticky and dirty and the silverware had food dried on it and overall all of the silverware was filthy and had to be returned. I ordered a burger and it was way overcooked. My daughter got a salad and kept telling me it tasted funny and wouldn't eat anymore. After inspection I realized why. There was wilted slimy lettuce. My son found a hair in his french fries. Unfortunately he found it in his mouth. Will never go here again.
Scott D.,"Nokesville, VA",3,24,12,4.0,11/30/2015,"Excellent food,  but average service.  Sunday afternoon so it was very busy.  Waitress was hard to find when we needed her.  Had Ahi Poke and siracha wings appetizers was great,  drinks and beer was awesome. We ordered deep dish pizza chicken bacon ranch ordered without tomatoes. Waitress told us pizza would be delayed because they made it with tomatoes, but then someone else brought one out a few minutes later.  It was obvious they had picked of the tomatoes and brought it out anyway as it was only warm and still had several tomatoes left.  They eventually replace it with a new one without tomatoes and it came out hot.  The manager apologized and took it off our bill.  It was very tasty with big chunks of chicken."
D. H.,"Centreville, VA",5,7,3,3.0,7/19/2014,"I've eaten at BJ's three times now. I'm always baffled by the enormous turnout in the parking lot. It always seems to be busy, but I wouldn't say BJ's food really lives up to its popular illusion. The first time, I ordered the honey-lime seared scallops with garlic brown rice. This dish actually made me not want to go back. It didn't taste bad, but the scallops had absolutely no flavor, and I couldn't taste even a speck of seasoning in the brown rice. I don't think I've ever had more bland food in my life.  When I was in California, we decided to eat at a BJ's there, so when I went for my second time, I ordered the gluten-free pizza. THIS was actually delicious. Both the taste and texture were like a regular pizza. It was thin, crispy, and flavorful. I'm actually very impressed with their GF pizza, as I've searched all over town for a good one and this has been the best one I've found. This renewed my hope and enticed me to go back to the BJ's in Gainesville and try something else.  The last and most recent time I went there, I ordered the Santa Fe Salad with blackened chicken, per the recommendation of the server, who claimed their blackened chicken was ""to die for."" The salad tasted good- the dressing was fresh and light and the combination of the cheese, avocado, bell peppers, corn, and tomatoes was perfect. However, I wasn't blown away by the blackened chicken. I was expecting some sort of flavor burst of cumin or cayenne pepper, but instead, I got chicken that was of course blackened on a grill, but completely lacking in flavor and spice.  One thing I have to give to BJ's is they have good handcrafted root beer and cream soda. But, who really goes to a restaurant for the soda?  The service was okay..definitely nothing to write home about. The hostesses that I've interacted with aren't all that friendly and the waiters seem a touch pushy about getting you to order drinks, apps, and dessert to hike up the tip.  I'll probably go to BJ's for their gluten-free pizza, but aside from that, it just isn't worth it."
Ray B.,"Vienna, VA",7,4,,5.0,9/11/2014,They brew their own beers. The menu is huge. We got the club and Mediterranean wrap.  Location is great.  Atmosphere is great.
Jesse E.,"Gainesville, VA",46,4,1,3.0,9/14/2014,"To start on a horrible note, we asked for a certain football game to be shown and the bartender Chris had a horrible attitude. She was abrasive and beyond rude. She snapped at several people at our table an a manager even stopped by to apologize to tell us she had a manager sit down 5 minutes before we arrived. Once she close out for the day our experience was much better. Latanya was our server and was absolutely delightful. She went above and beyond to make sure to make up for the bartender's unfortunate attitude.  I have given this restaurant 4 chances and 3 of the 4 times were way below par. Latanya deserves kudos for her positive attitude and great service!"
Heidi H.,"Haymarket, VA",2,70,,5.0,11/7/2014,"Great service and great food. Our table orders egg rolls, chicken club, shrimp tacos, jambalaya, and rib sandwich. It all came out hot and amazing. Food did not take too long, kitchen must be well trained. The waiter was very friendly and good with service. We did wait about an hour and fifteen minutes. The wait was suppose to under 45 minutes. The hostess staff is absolutely laughable. They always look so confused. They are not efficient whatsoever about seating people. When we finally were seated tonight, that sat us at a table for 6 instead of 4. Crazy... especially since a lot of others were also waiting. Food is great- definitely need more training with the hostess staff."
Sandi T.,"Gainesville, VA",4,45,10,3.0,11/22/2014,"Wish I could leave starts for the food and stars for the service.  3 stars for the food... 4 for the service.   This is my second time there and wasn't impressed.   Started with a wedge salad that was covered with at least a 1/2 cup of dressing.  Inedible...had to send back.  Waitress was sweet and offered something else but I knew I had a burger coming so I politely declined.   Then the burger.  I was disappointed that in the menu description, it said it came with grilled onions, lettuce, tomato and pickles.  Well, the grilled onions were missing.  When I asked our server, she said that the onions are cooked in the meat.  Okay, but not what I was expecting.   I'm not one to complain or send back my food but when the burger came without the grilled onions I was expecting, over done ( I asked for med well and it was dead as a doornail), thin as a pancake and ice cold, I had to send it back.  Once again the server offered to get me a new one but, again, I politely declined.  We had already been in there for over an hour...it was really busy. We did have dessert and it was really good!   Not sure I will visit again in the near future...maybe some day but not now."
Iain B.,"Gainesville, VA",12,167,64,1.0,6/8/2014,"Finally getting around to reviewing BJ's, my wife and I came here around 5PM on a Saturday about 3 weeks ago. We've tried to come here multiple times prior to that but every, single time the place is packed with a 1+ hour wait.  The last time we walked in and put our names down for a 45 minute wait we didn't get the text to come back for over 2 hours... Honestly, I don't get it.  The food is terrible... We arrived around 3:30PM and the restaurant was packed, but no one was waiting so we were seated immediately. Our waiter was a young guy, and when we told him that we were here for the first time he immediately said, ""Aren't you glad to not have to drive 30 minutes down the road for great food?  Well maybe you'll have to try it first before we can say that?"" Yea man, let's not get ahead of ourselves. The first problem is the menu is enormous.  There are well over 100 items and there are very limited vegetarian options. We started off with drinks, which ended up being the highlight of the meal. The beer was fresh and my wife liked her strawberry martini, though the waitress who confusingly took over for the first guy brought a Margarita by accident first. For appetizers we started with the spinach and artichoke dip and an order of the corn fritters without bacon. The spinach and artichoke dip was absolutely dreadful.  it was like eating Elmer's glue.  It was pasty, had no flavor and tasted like it came out of a can. The corn fritters weren't any better, they had no flavor and tasted frozen.  Maybe the bacon aioli that we didn't get brought the dish together but the fritters were bland and awful.  They didn't even taste like corn... At this point we just asked for the check.  We didn't see the point in getting anymore food if it was just going to be more processed, Sysco-tasting garbage like the appetizers were- especially considering the prices on the menu. Every time we drive by and see all the people standing outside, waiting to get in, we just shake our heads. We deserve better here in Gainesville, but unfortunately a lot of the residents here just don't realize it."
Tommy F.,"Front Royal, VA",64,69,31,3.0,7/19/2014,"I can't speak to the food, but the drinks were okay. I like that one can order a flight of 4 mix and match small beers. I tried the heavier beers - stout, nut brown, red and something else. I guess the last one wasn't that memorable. That was the problem, while the beers were tasty, there was nothing there which was so memorable that it would leavr me craving to go back.      Service was polite, but mediocre. They were very discombobulated during shift change. There was no coordination between the 2 servers, and they were quite slow. We considered leaving after placing the order because it took so long to arrive. I would go back, but I wouldn't rush to do so. Perhaps that accounts for the surprisingly dead Friday night at 10:00 PM."
Simply C.,"Fairfax, VA",0,46,74,4.0,2/17/2016,I have only been to this place one Sunday and we missed the rush hour.  I like the concept of the restaurant. I had the mahi-mahi tacos which is delicious.  I am hoping to visit their restaurant in the Tysons area since Gainesville is far from us.  Would definitely visit again if we travel to that area.
Elias V.,"Kensington, MD",13,117,1,5.0,7/3/2015,"Wow, forget Bar Louie around the corner. This place has stunning atmosphere, very ample and roomy. Delicious food, great variety and best of all full bar. The bar commands the place with its layout. This is my new hangout spot with the guys. I give it 5 Pineapples!"
