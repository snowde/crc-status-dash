Mrs. F.,"Gainesville, VA",0,7,3,4.0,5/19/2016,"We went in last night for my husbands birthday and all of us were so happy with how all the food came out. The appetizer was great (pretty sure we got the sampler). My margaritas were amazing. Our waiter Dan was excellent, especially with helping my husband, mother in law, and father in law pick out different beer options. I ordered the fried chicken and truly cannot stop thinking about just how good it was. My husband got the brisket burger and he said it was the best burger he's ever had and the best brisket as well. My father in law loved his dish (I don't know what he got but he kept saying how good it was after), and my mother in law got the spaghetti and meatballs and she loved it as well! I cannot wait to go back. It was soooo good and I definitely recommend the fried chicken. The only complaint I have is we were told that the chocolate chip cookie ice cream thing would be free because it was my husbands birthday and we were charged for it."
T T.,"Williamsburg, VA",0,48,48,3.0,1/11/2015,Over all it was ok....beer rocked this world but the food was ok and the service started bad but got better.
Lisa S.,"Bristow, VA",0,13,,1.0,7/21/2014,"We've tried this place several times at different times of the day.  The beer selection is outstanding but that would be the only reason I would go back.  But I won't be back because the place gets so crowded you can't comfortably enjoy a beer at the bar.  As far as the food goes, here is my last conversation with the manager... I had ordered the cherry chipotle salmon the last time I had come in and enjoyed the flavor, however the fish was way over cooked.  I requested my salmon rare this time and the manager informed me that the grade of salmon they use doesn't allow for the fish to be served rare.  That should say it all.  They try to display themselves as a higher end establishment but don't invest in quality food.   As for the wait time.  We tried the call ahead option and were told 45 minutes.  We got there 30 minutes later and were told we had 45 more minutes to wait.  After 45 minutes we were told we still had a half hour atleast.  That time we left and got pizza..."
Judi F.,"Lake Worth, FL",0,6,,1.0,8/11/2016,"The service here is the worst! Came on a Thursday night at 730. Not exactly rush hour. We have been sitting here for hours, and we are still surrounded by dirty dishes! Came in to no hostess in the hostess stand, stood there waiting for 10 minutes before anyone even greeted us, if it wasn't my daughters birthday (and her favorite place) we would have left then, should have left then! Asked to speak to a manager and they actually told us he was busy,, turned out she chased us out the door to ask about our complaint ! She was very nice and apologetic and gave us gift cards. That went along way toward making us feel better!"
Jennifer B.,"Bristow, VA",23,42,27,4.0,3/12/2015,"Every time we come here it's great.   The only issues are: ~ Long waits (I guess everyone loves it too :) ) The calling ahead method is annoyingly useless here.    ~ Drink Prices - $10+ for a cocktail? In Gainesville? More than the apps or some of their entries? Other than that - food is great (and great prices), HUGE menu, speedy food &   every server has been wonderful."
Tricia E.,"Lincoln, NE",26,29,1,4.0,7/11/2014,"I've been here twice thus far, and the results were different both times. The first time I went, I was very disappointed. I ordered the Moroccan Salmon with cous cous, and it was dreadful. The cous cous had ""mixed vegetables"" in it that were under-cooked and lacked flavor, and it was drenched in a bland tomato sauce. No flavoring or seasoning. The salmon was over-cooked, barely had any Moroccan seasoning, had no sauce, and was dry. I would rate my meal 2 stars; it was edible, but not enjoyable at all. The rest of my family got burgers and all seemed to enjoy their meals. The second time I went here, I ordered a medium rare steak and a tomato mozzarella salad. This meal was fantastic! The steak was cooked perfectly and seasoned so well. It was tender and melt in your mouth delicious! The tomato mozzarella salad was an excellent take on caprese salad, with chopped red onions and drizzled in balsamic vinegar. I'm getting hungry thinking of that meal right now! Definitely a 5 star meal, and would make me want to come back again. The wait staff were attentive both times. Also, call ahead seating is the way to go with this restaurant, as the wait times are very long. Even with call ahead seating, still expect about a 15 minute wait if you go during dinner time. Overall, I'll give this restaurant 4 stars."
Karen P.,"Woodbridge, VA",1,18,,2.0,8/3/2014,"I was not impressed.  We came for lunch on a Friday afternoon - just past lunch rush.  It was busy but not crowded. The potato skin app was far too much for two people.  It was what I would expect for four people.  The skins were good.  That was about it for the meal. Clam chowder looked as if it came from a can.  It was grayish and heavily salted.  It was almost inedible it was so salty.   Grilled chicken alfredo - chicken was so over cooked it was tough, dry and burned in spots.  I almost wondered if they gave be the blackened.  However it was not seasoned as blackened chicken is so combined with the dryness and toughness - it was overcooked. Alfredo sauce was bland and gummy.   Pasta was undercooked.  I like al dente but this was, well chewy.  It could have used another minute to boil.   Husband said the fish and chips were nothing special.  He was give the wrong fries.  He did not want the wedges.  Either someone too the order wrong or read it wrong.   We did not bother with dessert. With so many restaurants in that area, I can state we will not be back until we see better reviews.  And if we do it will most likely be for just apps and booze."
Ja R.,"Manassas, VA",20,38,12,5.0,12/20/2015,"Since my last review new management have done a remarkable job .. Service is fast , food is great for the value , atmosphere is wonderful ... Nice place to hang out with friends and watch football on Sunday's ..."
Tracy T.,"Dallas, TX",2,6,5,5.0,8/13/2015,"My husband and I decided to try this place while in Manassass on business. We were pleasantly surprised! The decor and ambiance was wonderful not too fancy and not too formal! They had several tvs with football on (which my husband approved), and a good selection of craft beers (which he also approved)! I was also pleased with my drink-orange crush, made with their hand crafted cream soda! Our meal was delicious too! My husband had the cherry glazed salmon and I had the barbacoa chicken. Both meals happened to be on the light menu but were not lacking in flavor at all. The salmon was served with couscous and asparagus, and the chicken was served with brown rice, black beans, feta, and the most delicious sauce! It was probably the best chicken breast I have ever had! It was so juicy! I wish there was a BJ's Brew House closer to home! Next time I'm in town I will definitely return! Service was pretty good too!"
Lynda D.,"Alexandria, VA",0,23,,1.0,6/1/2015,"We love BJ's.  It is one of our favorites, so much that when we travel, we actually seek it out.  We have been to multiple locations in California, Nevada and Texas as well as the Tysons Corner location (which is the closest to where we live). This one in Gainesville is absolutely horrible. Does not compare to the service and quality of food and beverages that are typical of BJ's. Arriving around 4pm on Saturday, we were meeting some friends in advance to going to see a concert at nearby Jiffy Lube Live.  It was a good location for a meet-up since we were driving separately and wanted to go into the show together.  It was not too busy and appeared perfect.  We sat in the bar area at one of the bar tables.  It took about 10 minutes for a server to greet us and about another 15 minutes to get our beers.  The server disappeared!  Even the bartenders appeared to be ignoring their customers, including us when we sought them out to order from the bar. The one star is for the beer - gratefully even bad service cannot mess up the good quality beer.  After the first round, it took another 10  minutes for the server to ask if we wanted another beverage.  Luckily, the food servers are different and the food actually come out in a reasonable amount of time. However, the food was not up to par.  I ordered a turkey burger with a side mixed green salad.  No condiments for the burger were offered and the salad was all spinach and all wilted with no dressing.   Good thing that the Tysons Corner location is the one that we typically go to.  We will NOT be going here to Gainesville ever again."
Jennifer M.,"Falls Church, VA",12,64,9,2.0,6/18/2015,"Ordered online at 1040 on a Thursday evening. Online ordering said pickup permitted 15 min from order so selected 11. Followed email confirmation instructions by parking in pickup spot and called to let them know we were there. They had not received our order by name and only found it after we gave the confirmation number. (Prior to that said ""we don't have that order."") Gentleman on phone was polite but it was obvious they hadn't started order. 15 min later my husband walked it. He came out with the order and said they gave him $10 off for a 3 meal order. That would have driven a higher rating but we opened the bag later to find the order was incorrect. Food was good but online ordering was a fail. If we have to wait that long and come in to eventually get the food we may as well just come in the first time to at least ensure the order is correct."
Darren T.,"Gainesville, VA",14,12,,2.0,6/25/2015,"I like BJ's Brewhouse. The Pizookie and Bison Burger are delicious. My family doesn't like this place though and I understand why. The place has not been clean on the multiple occasions that we have gone there. There is often a wait even when it looks like it is not that busy.  We were once seated at a table with plates leftover from previous customers. Honest mistake, maybe but we have seen dirty tables in this place more than a few times. I really like the bison burger though. I sometimes think of eating carryout so I can eat what I like without having to see the dirtiness."
Alex H.,"Fairfax, VA",0,9,,5.0,7/21/2014,"I love BJ's. Sorry I had to get that out of my system. This place is great though. I've been two times and the food has been great. I haven't tried their entrees but their appetizers (especially the stuffed mushrooms) and deep dish pizzas are very well done. They also have an impressive draft beer selection including their own brews and the bar area is set up beautifully. Service has been helpful, friendly, and knowledgeable both times."
Mike R.,"New Orleans, LA",21,1,,1.0,4/25/2015,"I went in with great expectations about this place based on what I'd heard from friends. We went on a Saturday night with a party of five. We were told there are no reservations for anything less than seven people, but there was call-ahead service. We called in at 5:00 for a 6:30 arrival. When we got to the restaurant, there was an additional 20 minute wait...not a big deal for a Saturday night. They sat us at around 6:50 and we placed drink and appetizer orders almost immediately. The drinks came out within five minutes and the app within ten and we ordered our entrees along with the drinks around 6:55.  Then our waitress basically disappeared. She refilled drinks once around 7:10, then didn't return for at least 30 minutes. In the meantime, it took a ton of time to flag down (what appeared to be) an assistant manager or a host...it was hard to tell because he didn't actually let us know which he was. This was around 7:40.  We told him we had somewhere to be by 8:30, and that we would like him to check on our food and to possibly bring our check out along with it when it was ready. He took ten minutes to go back in the kitchen, then return to tell us we were about to be served. We waited another ten minutes before we flagged him down again, still with no food. Now nearly 8:00 and seeing people that arrived after U.S. Receiving our food, we asked to have our food bagged up so we could make it to our other engagement on time. The ""manager"" said yes but seemed annoyed. When he returned to tell us the food would be out any minute, he gave us our check with 25% taken off.  No apology, only ""it's Saturday night, what do you expect?""  When I pointed out that our waitress didn't even bother to check in with us, didn't refresh our drinks or offer us any updates for more than 30 minutes, he said ""I guess I'll have to coach her up on that.""  No additional apology. The waitress came by and handed us the check, looking very confused that we didn't have any food but were paying anyway. The manager clearly did not clue her in as to what was going on. No apology on her part and no idea that leaving us alone without checking on us for huge stretches of time was any kind of problem. We paid and our food finally came out in to-go containers around 8:10...1:15 after the initial order.  It was clear the waitress didn't even place our original order with the kitchen and the ""manager"" was covering for her.  We took the food and left. I had the baked lasagna. It was bland and cold, but probably would have been okay if I'd been able to eat it in the restaurant fresh.  The food never sat well, and eventually made me sick later that evening (it didn't not stay down long).  TL;DR Moral of the story, crappy service (1:15 for simple entrees), crappier management (failure to take ownership of poor service), and food that made me sick. I won't be going back to BJ's anytime soon. I would recommend you do the same."
R G.,"Manassas, VA",1,88,87,5.0,6/6/2015,"We really enjoyed this restaurant. Jackie was a really great server. The southwest spring rolls were delicious, and the California club was filling and had a unique flavor. We tried the Beignets, and they are tasty. Not Cafe DuMonde, but a a great twist on an old favorite. The unique thing about this restaurant  for us, was the bottomless refills you can sample of their handcrafted sodas (root beer, black cherry, and orange cream soda)  It's not too loud or noisy, like some microbreweries. Highly recommend."
Sean P.,"Ashburn, VA",70,180,65,4.0,8/20/2014,"It's a bar on steroids. Everything's bigger here. The brews, the menu... even the building. The selection is truly massive, and the quality is pretty top notch across the board. We went in with a group of about 18, and even though we only had one server for the majority of the two hours we were there, drinks rarely ran dry and service was damn near perfect. The apps were good (mozz sticks, wings and calamari). The pizza was great, as was the pasta. No complaints. It can get a bit crowded during the lunch rush. If you're averse to loud noises it may not be the place for you (but, well, most bars and brewhouses wouldn't be either)."
Trevor B.,"Haymarket, VA",0,1,,2.0,6/20/2016,"Beer is good , food sucks! Pick apps only as I have never had a good entree here. And I question their food borne illness quality control"
Chuck H.,"Bristow, VA",0,4,,2.0,5/20/2015,"Pro: Food is pretty good, pazookies and beers are great. Decent prices. This is the only reason for the two stars.  Cons: (1) Terrible customer service. Waiters with (grossly) offensive body odor, waiters who do not come to your table for 30+ minutes, slow service (even on slow days), never answer the phone when calling ahead to be put on the wait list, and managers who just do not give a damn. (2) Food comes out cold half the time, lukewarm if you are lucky.  The must leave all items under a heat lamp until everything is ready, but it does not keep it hot. it is not unusual to have one item piping hot while the other is cold.  (3) In about every 1 of 3 visits, our order is messed up. Forgotten sides, wrong drink, etc...  Bottom line is although the food is good, the service is very hit or miss.  Either way expect it to be slow. Seated for 15 minutes before a waiter comes is never acceptable, 20 minutes for drinks to come is never acceptable, 40 minutes for a burger is never acceptable.  The fact that the manager doesn't respond to complaints is never acceptable."
Layla B.,"Greenfield, WI",17,97,33,5.0,8/13/2014,"Visited here early on a Wednesday evening. Our server Tim was incredibly friendly and attentive. We ordered beer and cider, both of which were very good. Our garden salads were fresh with shaved parmesan cheese. The veggie pizza with hand-tossed crust had a flavorful sauce, with fresh veggies and cheese. The pizza was really delicious. We had one of their huge baked cookies (just chocolate chip, although are was a litany of other choices) which was delightful. This restaurant was busy, but not too noisy. The atmosphere was very comfortable, the food was great and service was excellent. I would definitely recommend a visit. It probably gets busy on the weekend, but we arrived at 5 on a weekday and were seated immediately."
Reina M.,"Centreville, VA",0,15,2,1.0,6/21/2015,Service is bad even though it was slow. Took awhile for beers to come. Forgot our kids side order. Floor was slippery everywhere...so slippery one of their hostess fell.  Food was meh...
