Stephanie J.,"Manassas, VA",4,38,3,3.0,6/7/2014,"First time here & was not impressed at first.  The wedge salad had a weird, sweet dressing on it.  Our waiter was not real knowledgeable or attentive. Our entrees arrived and BJ's redeemed themselves.  The food was good!  The California chicken sandwich was delish!"
Tara O.,"Gainesville, VA",15,28,,4.0,8/16/2015,"Went here for lunch lsst week. The food, atmosphere and prices were amazing! We all had the soup and salad. It was all unlimited. The broccoli cheese soup was by far my favorite!!! Would totally visit again for dinner!"
Kathryn B.,"Bristow, VA",0,17,3,4.0,5/9/2015,"I have since been back since out long visit, and have not had any other issues.  We went back there today and had a great visit and our waiter, Daniel, was so personally, and friendly and made sure that our entire meal was the best it could be.  I spoke to the manager on the way out and asked him to please give kudos to Daniel and told him I would post this onto yelp."
Morganne A.,"Gainesville, VA",50,6,,5.0,10/15/2015,"Takes forever to be seated but so worth it! The staff is friendly, great food, delicious beer! Love!"
Sarah B.,"Gainesville, VA",0,7,,1.0,10/9/2015,"First time at this restaurant in Gainesville. Decided to use call ahead since we were taking family out who was visiting. However, I called and was put on hold for more than 5 minutes. Since the restaurant is less than 5 minutes from our house, we decided to simply drive over.  When we got to BJ's, I mentioned the problem with their call ahead. They simply did not care at all. This will be my first and LAST visit."
Lelee R.,"Manassas, VA",60,70,24,4.0,6/9/2015,"Their pizza + beer are amazing. But that's what they're known for so that's good! I've tried their other dishes when I'm not in the mood for pizza, and they're ok. Their pizookies are awesome though! I get that for dessert almost every time I go there. Service can sometimes suck though. I understand that it's a big restaurant + that they can get pretty busy on the weekends, but it's still your job to be on top of things. The best waitress there, though, is Latonya. Def go see her. She's always on top of everything."
Greg R.,"Warrenton, VA",7,10,4,5.0,2/15/2014,"Best new restaurant in Gainesville. Deep dish pizza and potato skins were great, quality food! Home brewed root beer was delicious!"
Bianca B.,"Haymarket, VA",15,9,,5.0,7/17/2014,"So far I've eaten hear twice, once with just adults, and the second time with children, both times I had an excellent experience.  The clam chowder is perfect. The salmon is cooked to perfection as well. I love the fact that they have a light menu that actually has great tasting food offered.  The kids menus are no joke my kids ate all of their dinner which is rare! They actually cook kids food just as well as the cook their larger entrées!  Not to mention my margarita was just the way I like it. Kudos to the bar tender that night!"
Ah F.,"Gainesville, VA",28,86,495,1.0,2/7/2014,Not good service.  Slow check out. Food average.
Jennie O.,"Aldie, VA",0,3,,3.0,11/14/2016,"My boyfriend and I really like going to BJ's--he loves the jalapeno burger!! We usually have okay service, nothing too great though. This time we took his mom and aunt and didn't have good service at all. The manager/hostess was a little rude when we were going to be seated--we were going to sit in a booth in the bar but decided there's more room at the booths in the restaurant (I like the bar area for happy hour only.) When we came back down to get a table in the restaurant, my boyfriend's mom was looking at different booth sizes to see what options we had and the manager made some unpleasant comments like ""we have a system here"" and ""it will be a few minutes--we have people waiting at the bar for a table"" (which turned out to not be true since there was about 15 tables in the restaurant that were open), ""there's a party of 40 in the back that we are trying to handle right now"". I have worked many years in the restaurant industry so I understand how they are run. It was an off time (around 3:30 on a Saturday afternoon) so they weren't busy at all and it's a transition time for the servers which I completely understand--but she was rude how she went about it where the hostess that was there originally was so pleasant. The server was really nice and overall good, but very forgetful!! I highly suggest writing down orders so you don't forget!! My burger was completely wrong--sauce came on the burger when I asked for it on the side and the egg was cooked over-medium when I specifically asked for it to be well done. I didn't complain about the burger as I was able to eat half of it--the second half was too soggy so I didn't eat it. I thought maybe this was the kitchen's fault, but when I looked at the receipt, I noticed the server had rung it in wrong. My boyfriend's mom had asked for ice on the side for her tea and sweetener with it, but she didn't receive it until she asked again once we got our entrees. Overall the service was okay and maybe I'm too critical since I know what good service should be, but it's definitely not something to rave about."
Chris G.,"Gainesville, VA",16,7,,5.0,3/17/2014,This is a newer restaurant in the area and I have not say down and eaten food but have had finger foods and apps with a beer.  The beers are good and for a growing area that lives craft beer this is the place to go right now. Tons of beer and the Bartenders are nice.  Try it out!
Charlotte W.,"Gainesville, VA",7,10,,5.0,1/11/2015,"We generally sit in the bar and get appetizers.  The bartenders are fantastic, and the waitstaff has been as well anytime we've sat away from the bar.  The beer is good, and the food is excellent.  Try the potstickers!"
Sam L.,"Centreville, VA",1,9,,5.0,7/4/2015,Every time I come here my food is always good. My service is phenomenal so I'm satisfied all across the board! Keep up the good work!
Pixy F.,"Montgomery, AL",12,17,4,4.0,4/19/2015,"Lots of space, good beers and good food.  There are a lot of tvs, but not so loud and crowded that you can't have your own conversation.  Good spot. The Brunette brown ale....best bear for dark beer lovers.  The PM Porter I'd more like a weak stout, the Imperial Stout is not too strong (not strong enough for this gal....but I like Rasputin). The Brunette, is where it's at in the winter.  The appetizers and happy hour are good."
Heather L.,"Gainesville, VA",0,35,2,4.0,6/27/2015,"I love this place. I hate this place. Ok I hate the price on some of the entrees. I've been here maybe 4 or 5 times. Hubby and I went here yesterday for lunch. As soon as he walked in, the hostess was demanding our phone number for their rewards program. I thought we were signed up, but couldn't remember, so I gave her our number. Of course, it didn't come up, she wanted to keep punching in numbers. UGH! I told her, I don't care about the rewards program, just seat us so we can eat!  I haven't had bad service here, but then again, I don't go when they are crazy busy either. I do love the avocado rolls here. They are best I've had. They aren't greasy at all. Hubby and I almost always pick the same entree. We were arguing (kinda) on who would get the shrimp scampi. I got that and he got the jambalaya. For $17, I felt robbed. A bunch of noodles, tiny bits of tomato, about 9 shrimp and 2 little pieces of bread. Boo!  The pizookies are to die for! I literally wanted to lick the plate. If I had to come here again, skip the entree. Get appetizers and pizookies! Yum!"
Robert F.,"Gainesville, VA",1,30,2,3.0,6/21/2014,"Bar is above average...good selection of beers and drinks. Food is average...you can find this type of food most everywhere. Wait staff rates a ""C."" Needs to be more focused on the customer and less on each other. Overall - good place to go for drinks and appetizers."
Alicia T.,"Leesburg, VA",21,359,29,5.0,4/7/2015,We are becoming regulars at this place. The menu is endless; there is something for everybody here. The berry cider is a favorite for drinks. We love splitting a flatbread pizza for an appetizer and MUST finish up the meal with a Pizookie trio! My recommendation...Call ahead because wait times are crazy long. It is worth it though!
A C.,"Manassas, VA",0,1,,2.0,5/29/2016,"First I went to Bj and we were seated.  The server NICHOLETTE was extremely rude. We waited over an 1hour for our food.  The people that came after us actually got their food first.  I asked another server... the big guy to get the manager.  Instead he goes and tell our server that we want to speak to the manager so she had the audacity to come over and say what's the problem.  I told her she knows what the problem is.. she laughed a little and walked off... no kidding.  I asked a different server to get the manager and he comes over and I told him we have been waiting here over an hour for our food and this couple over to the side has gotten their food and we were here before them. At this point I'm about to blow!  He then says let me see what's going on. He finally brings the food, but at this point me and my family are ready to go so I just asked for the check and boxes.  He did take care of the check however I believe he had a attitude because we complained.  The staff here is very unprofessional. I will not be ordering or eating there any more."
Caitlynn B.,"Amherst, VA",4,1,1,5.0,6/16/2014,"Everything was delicious!  From the Irish root beer, to corn fritters, to the deep dish pizza, and the cookies!"
Cindy E.,"Warrenton, VA",73,13,1,4.0,2/7/2014,"Just had lunch with some coworkers, Friday afternoon. Got seated right away. The place was packed but the layout accommodates well and we did not feel crowded. The server approached us right away and took our drink order. She also informed us they have $3 pints during lunch. This would be AWESOME if I was not returning to work after. The food was great. I got the half salad half flatbread with the roasted veggies and goat cheese. The goat cheese and veggies were perfectly paired and I was very pleased. The portions are perfect. They are not overwhelmingly huge and I finished my plate feeling satisfied. The lunch combo was I believe $6.99 so my total check was like $7.42. We all had great food and great service. It's also a cute place and would make for a fun happy hour. Will definitely be going back!"
