M. K.,"McLean, VA",0,34,,3.0,2/29/2016,"The food here is always a hit or miss depending on what you get, so I tend to just stick to certain things. Their appetizers tend to be more delicious than their actual meals, so I always just get a few appetizers and make a meal of that. Their meals can be kind of bland and sometimes in a salad they'll skimp on the toppings that belong on the salad which can be annoying too. But their desserts are always good.. the pizookies are DELICIOUS and their new monkey bread pizookie is so delicious you MUST try."
Pearl D.,"Burke, VA",1,151,,4.0,8/5/2015,"Large and spacious. Cool place. The Blonde and Hefeweizen were good. Lots of good menu choices like mahi- mahi , fish and chips, steak , and salads."
Mike B.,"Orlando, FL",28,25,,5.0,5/16/2015,"Really like the food a lot.  Service is a little spotty sometimes, but they are very friendly. They seem like they get overwhelmed some times.  Recently downloaded the app and it is totally worth it. Have been back a few more times and the service has improved. Great food."
Jed K.,"Gainesville, VA",0,1,,1.0,10/27/2014,"High expectations, big disappointment. Sat down and waited and waited for a server. It was not that busy. After ten minutes, I had to ask the hostess for someone to come over to us. Food was so-so. I had pork chops and they were fine but the green beans were rubbery and had no taste, as if they had been frozen. Took a long time to get the check. Not inclined to go back."
Drew E.,"Fairfax Station, VA",46,38,96,5.0,2/6/2015,"I had a great time at BJs, everything you'd expect and want. It was fun, food was good, and the service performed."
Amanda J.,"Gainesville, VA",2,16,,5.0,5/10/2015,Good is always great. Beer too. A couple bad things are call ahead seating and overall host staff. Quoted times are always wrong and the host staff always seems lost. Once you get in it is great.
Stacie M.,"Alexandria, VA",14,242,2,1.0,10/14/2014,"We ate here again yesterday afternoon for the second time and again I was left disappointed. For starters, the food was very cold and there was no 'TLC' given to the food whatsoever. My cajun pasta was absent the 'cajun'; my husband's fries served with his meal we think were made days ago and served to him; my friends buffalo chicken pizza was doused with BBQ sauce???. The serve was also a little absent-minded and needed reminding for certain things. This is not a restaurant we will likely be going back to try again."
Stephen T.,"Broad Run, VA",0,1,,2.0,11/10/2015,"I came here yesterday, Monday straight from work. Had a long day and was happy to walk into happy hour at the bar. I requested a double Jack and mountain dew from two different bar tenders one named Molly and the other I don't remember. I ordered 3 drinks all of which were singles and when I asked Molly she said ""I didn't want to drown you in Jack."" I find this appalling. II have thoroughly enjoyed the food and service up until this point. I didn't think the waitresses or bartenders could alter orders to their preference. I was extremely let down by her response. I even noticed her ask the other bartender if she had poured me doubles and she shook her head no. I was entirely sober and hadn't had a drink that day prior to my visit. I could understand if I was under the influence upon arrival. This was not my first time at Bjs and I have received doubles in the past. After this experience I will debate going back and will advise friends and family not to waste their time. This experience was very upsetting and a total let down since I enjoy the bar there and it's local for me."
Colin R.,"Manassas, VA",0,2,,1.0,5/1/2015,We had a 2 hour wait to get in. Once seated took 20 mons to get our drinks. After ordering it took 30 mins to be told out food would be out shortly another 15 we were told sorry for the delay. When I got my food it was wrong I ate it because I didn't have another hour to wait.
Tracy B.,"Manassas, VA",2,2,,3.0,6/28/2015,Food was above average. Good deserts. Staff was nice but our waiter was over booked on tables.
Betsy A.,"Vienna, VA",0,11,,4.0,8/14/2015,"This is a fun place to go eat,, with a lively atmosphere, good selection of beers, a huge menu, lots of TV's with sports on. and you don't have to get dressed up.. A mixed crowd depending on the time of day and day of the week, of families, couples, singles. Many times a long wait to get seated as they do not take reservations, and also to get your food. .. I went on line and Joined their BJ's club. You get offers via email, earn points, and join their priority club, where you call ahead and ask to be put on a wait list, and it does sometimes shorten the wait time when you get there.  Be warned a SHORT wait time here is 20 to 30 minutes on weekend nights. LOL. Another tip, if you get a carryout, do NOT grab the bags, and rush to your car. Go through EACH box in that bag, and be sure everything you ordered is there. Twice I have ordered carryout and not all items were there or something I did NOT even order was inside a box. Now,. I take a list with me of what I ordered and check the boxes... Have been here about 14 times for lunch, happy hour, dinner, and even for a burger at 10pm one night. It has bit of all types of food, Southwest/ Mexican,, Asian, Italian, Sea food,  and American favorites.. Several times, when not wanting a big dinner, have been to the Bar at happy hour on weekdays and had their special priced appetizers (love the chicken lettuce wraps,  the South west rolls, and their small personal pan pizzas) Ask for the Happy Hour menu.  . This is not the place for  getting dressed up to have a gourmet dinner,  or that romantic quiet candlelight Dinner, or for a great steak. Go to other places for those meals. But, for what it is,  a  casual place to eat and drink and kick back, (and watch a game on a lot of TV's)  it is a good addition to the restaurant scene in this area."
Meg H.,"Annandale, VA",0,11,,1.0,3/28/2016,"Food ok. Service eh. Silverware was disgusting and covered in food, fingerprints, and grease. Asked for new ones and came back with more dirty silverware."
Lona B.,"Manassas, VA",4,40,4,4.0,1/16/2015,"Girls night out!! I had fried calamari for an appetizer, it was just ok. Then I had the southern fried chicken dinner...it was delicious! Great atmosphere, great server. I will go again with the family."
Dawn R.,"Culpeper, VA",78,419,883,3.0,12/15/2014,"I've been here twice - once for a beer and once for dinner. It's a neat place, but the food wasn't all that amazing this time around. We went with a big group and they were very accommodating (after taking 2 hours to seat us). They made up for it with a few free apps, so that was really cool of them. I'd like to try some of the different items on the menu, so I'm sure we'll go back again."
Kelly B.,"Vienna, VA",1,26,,1.0,10/25/2015,"I will not return. We came here for a birthday party, with reservations at 6pm for 10 people. We had three small children with us, and it took an hour and a half for dinner to arrive. And that was after I asked for the children's meals to be expedited. While the food was perfectly satisfactorily, and the waitress was very kind and apologetic, the fact was the kitchen was unacceptably slow and we won't go back."
M R.,"Waxhaw, NC",0,15,,3.0,11/2/2014,"The only time I have come here and it was efficient was during the week for lunch. Ordered burgers, fries, kids pizza for a party of 5. The restaurant was not packed and it took much  longer than expected. Ordering dessert added about a half hour to the experience. Overall food is good but just be ready to wait a while for your food. You may also wait quite a while for a server to come and greet you at your table."
Yonatan D.,"Manassas, VA",3,35,7,1.0,2/3/2015,"My first visit here was pretty good, but today my girlfriend went for lunch with her co-workers and got food poisoning. She was the only one who ordered fried chicken and basically a couple hours later began vomiting. She ended up leaving work early (around 4PM) and now we're currently at PWC Hospital waiting for her to get treated. She also mentioned there was a strand of hair in her food, but realized this when she was halfway finished with her meal. She mentioned this to the staff and they just simply apologized. Never again...if I'm in the area and craving a good beer and burger I'll settle for Bar Louies nearby. At least they're consistent and don't poison customers."
Fred S.,"Andover, NJ",0,150,124,4.0,1/20/2015,Stopped in for lunch and pleasantly surprised. Large restaraunt with huge beer selection on tap. Quick service and great food.  Great place for a business lunch with a time limit.
James M.,"Mooresville, NC",0,1,,1.0,5/14/2015,"IF YOU HAVE A GLUTEN ALLERGY DO NOT GO HERE.  I was just in the restaurant.  Service was terrible.  Food was not cooked correctly.  I also specifically ordered the ""gluten free"" plain pizza and expressed that I have an allergy.  About 20 minutes later I knew something was wrong.  Anyone who has a gluten allergy STAY AWAY from this place.  They are not worth anyone's time or money."
Susan G.,"Gainesville, VA",50,17,,1.0,10/17/2015,"Lunched today - 10-17-2015 - and ordered the brewhouse burger with fries. Came on a Cold Metal Tray - like a cookie tray - and the burger was cold due to the tray and the fries were cold as well. Actually asked the waiter if they ran out of plates as I thought it unusual. He said No - this is how they serve them now. Well the burger was COLD and the fries were colder. Horrid experience! Told the manager this was not a good experience and he stated he would comp the burger. Great! But - he took my rewards points away in order to do it. Tried to get my points back after I got home and realized what happened. He said he would fix it and get back to me. Hung up on me! Never fixed it. Such amazingly BAD customer service and I am in the Customer. service industry. Not the way to fix! Location #552. I am so sorry to post such a horrid review we have always had great food and service from this location. I want to go back but ...... Give me my points back, take the cold trays away (who does that!) THEN I will go back. Blech. You guys had a Major Malfunction today. If I could give ZERO stars,I would.  Ruined a perfectly lovely day."
