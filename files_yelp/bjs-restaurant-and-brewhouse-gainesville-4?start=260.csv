Mandéque O.,"Gainesville, VA",8,22,3,1.0,12/31/2014,"I'm not a fan of factory prepared food. I don't know what I was expecting, I would've been better off at a one of a kind place. :/"
A K.,"Gainesville, VA",0,12,,3.0,4/25/2015,Typical chain but good food. Service is mediocre.
Zach M.,"Marshall, VA",0,22,,2.0,12/26/2015,"Been to BJs 5-6 times. Have had one good experience.The service has gone downhill. Food is fine, not worth dealing with the poor service. Entrees came out before beers tonight. I would not go out of the way to try this place."
Scott H.,"Manassas, VA",215,561,90,5.0,7/10/2014,"To be honest, I wasn't expecting much from this large chain brewpub/restaurant. My experiences with similar franchises - e.g. Gordon Biersch, Rock Bottom - have been hit or miss. The beer at these places tend to be rather basic (with a few exceptions) and the food tends to be overpriced and uninspired. Maybe it's an issue of greatly exceeding tampered expectations, but I was completely blown away with BJ's. I've been there twice in the last two weeks, and they are my new ""go to"" spot in the Manassas/Gainesville area. I stumbled upon BJ's Brewhouse while looking for something different for dinner - that served good beer of course - on the handy-dandy Yelp app. I had heard of the franchise before, but didn't realize that there was in one in Gainesville. I also didn't realize that Virginia Gateway had expanded with a ""Promenade"" - one of those swanky town-center type places with shops and restaurants that tend to be a bit more upscale. (Not quite Reston Town Center, more like Loudoun One or Stonefield in Charlottesville) It's a great addition to the area. My first visit to BJs was on a Saturday night, and as I expected from reading the Yelp reviews, they were packed. However, we were able to find immediate seating in the bar area while waiting, and we received our text for seating within 15 minutes. BJ's has a great app that allows you to view estimated wait time and add your name to the list to lessen the wait.  The other thing that makes the wait go by fast is their beer selection. I was impressed with their offerings. They brew the standards to appeal to the common beer drinker - light lager, kolsch, amber, Irish red - but they also have stronger brews, such as their Tatonka Imperial Stout. They also brew seasonals, and were offering ""Hoppy Scotsman"", a slightly hoppy Scottish ale. Unfortunately they had just kicked their Imperial Red Reserve. Unlike many brewpubs, they offer a strong selection of other beers as well. There's about 22 others on tap, and while most of them are standard stuff you'd see anywhere - the standard imports and macro-crafts - you'll find a couple of nice options, such as selections from local breweries Heritage and Old Busthead, and Stone Arrogant Bastard. Personally I'd prefer to have their house brews - they are all really good. My second visit was on the 4th with the family, and everyone raved about the beer. My father in law even took a growler of kolsch home. Still, if I were rating for just beer I would give them four stars. The food bumps them up to five stars. On my first visit I had a steak, and chose their awesome cheddar mashed as one of the sides. For some reason I had a craving for clam chowder, and I was happy to see that a bowl of soup was offered as a second side. The chowder was great, and my steak was cooked perfectly rare. I tried a bite of my wife's burger and it was great. On the next visit, my dad, father-in-law, and I decided to split two 12"" deep dish pizzas. We all agreed that the pizza was amazing. With the thickness of the pizza, the expectation is that it will be a heavy pizza. But instead, it's very light and with the right hint of buttery. I'll be hard pressed to get anything else on return visits. Well, except for the pizookie that is. What's a pizookie? I'm glad you asked. It's a large cookie cooked into a deep dish pizza pan topped with vanilla ice cream. And it's freakin' awesomesauce. You can order a full-sized one, or a trio of small ones, or a giant one to share for the whole table. I got a normal-sized salted caramel on my first visit and was in heaven. We got a trio with the family, and the cookies 'n cream pizookie stood out of that bunch. So to summarize, we have really good house-made brews, awesome deep dish pizza, and something to cure your sweet tooth. What more could you want? Well, how about great house made sodas - the wife LOVES the orange cream soda. BJ's delivers on all fronts for me, the wife, and the family. I really love their craft beer, but I channel Fred Durst when I say for me, I do it all for the pizookie."
Tom K.,"Bristow, VA",3,15,1,1.0,7/19/2014,This was our second visit. Food was cold and not very good even though we had their pizza   Each course we had was delivered first to the wrong table. When they offered money off our bill it was noted that we were uniformed officers which I'm sure is their way of hiding the problems from owners. Twice thete. Both times dissatisfied. There will not be a third
Yvonne R.,"Warrenton, VA",0,3,,1.0,2/28/2016,Very disappointed. Arrived at 6:15 pm left10:30 waiter offered and we requested up front separate checks. Told no problem. Appetizers spinach dip substituted for Luke warm velvetta pot stickers delivered instead of potato skins returned but charged anyway. Drinks incorrect and forgotten. Salad forgotten. To go pizza ordered and came to table not in box. 30 mins later waiter had to go track down pizza. Attempted to provide checks 5 times never correct even with managers help. No appearance at table by manager to apologize for problems. Will never go back  3 couples spent $250 for horrible service. Never again.
Tom E.,"Bristow, VA",0,13,,1.0,11/25/2015,"Terrible service... Food not much better. Overly salty and bland. Very slow service, much better options than Bjs in Gainesville now!"
Sarah W.,"Rehoboth Beach, DE",6,7,15,4.0,7/16/2014,Good food! Always packed. You can download the app to get rewards and do order ahead. Will come back here.
Meagan V.,"Centreville, VA",13,16,9,4.0,11/8/2014,"They have a great gluten free menu, the food is always tasty & we always have fun. The only problem is that they can be understaffed sometimes, this has happened several times to us. The staff work really hard, but they fall behind because so many of them go home. The food is always on point though, so definitely worth the wait if you have time."
Bo Q.,"Gainesville, VA",0,2,,4.0,2/18/2016,I like BJ's in Gainesville.  They do not only provide very good dishes but their services are excellent.  I definitely will go back and strongly recommend it to you.
Mason C.,"Manassas, VA",0,4,,1.0,1/14/2015,"The wait  for a table is always obnoxiously long (elongated this time due to host accidentally putting us down as party of 4 not 2 which caused us to be seated after people that came in after us).... Waited close to 45min for a table on a Wednesday night... Last time we tried to come we were told wait for two was over an hour.... Once seated the food was mediocre my fish was obviously left in fryer too long and my wife's burger was dry and not very tasty... Also server was not very good seemed like we had to wait forever to get our water glasses refilled and I needed more tartar sauce which also took forever... The only thing worth while in this place was the beer I wanted to try their Jeremiah Red but they were out of it so stuck with staut instead... Sadly dont see us coming back.... Bottom line while this place could have potential it obviously lacks space, staff and service...."
Federal F.,"Gainesville, VA",0,7,,2.0,8/25/2014,"Restaurant interior = 3.5 stars. Good wood accents and feels like quality. I didn't rate it higher because I wasn't sure what the theme was supposed to be. Feels like a highly decorated cafeteria. A little noisy. Bar appearance = 4 stars. Pretty neat looking Drink selection = 4 stars Food = 2 stars--standard fair. You can get it anywhere but here it's a little more pricey. I expected more of a chef like feel, not an out of the can or box experience. But that is exactly what you get here. Signature pizza is a bland dough and standard toppings. The other items our party ate were equally a 'meh'....My overall rating is 2 stars because that experience was a let down. The other ratings I gave weren't effective enough to really put it into a 3 star category. Server was very pleasant and enthusiastic though service was painfully slow. I still gave her a 20% tip because that's how I roll. They weren't that busy. When asked about a particular item on the menu it was either fantastic, great, or very good. Food, however, was just average. It's what happens when a restaurant tries to be a jack of all trades and a master of none. Would I go back for the food. Nah....there's better food around. For drinks? Perhaps but I'd try to hit Bar Louie's first."
Abe S.,"Fort Washington, MD",29,24,9,5.0,11/21/2014,Was passing thru here and from the service from the bartenders and Brandy the manager everything was wonderful. Polite people clean place.
Jade D.,"Manassas, VA",1,11,1,5.0,3/16/2015,"This is my new favorite place to eat in the area. I've tried many items on the menu, all were delicious. My favorites are the watermelon feta salad, the pizza, and pizookies of course! Salted caramel and the peanut butter s'mores are to die for! Food comes out pretty quick too so you're not waiting forever.  It does get crowded on weekends around dinner hour, but they do call aheads so take advantage."
Henry H.,"Haymarket, VA",0,22,1,2.0,9/15/2014,"I recently got take out from BJ's. New Orleans jambalaya was great (4 out of 5). The basic steamed side of green beans was not. I was charged $3.50 for a total of 17 green beans - yes, so few that I counted (also posted a picture to give visual aid). That's roughly 20 cents/green bean. My advice - food is great but stay away from sides if you're a person who considers value to be important."
Marylou P.,"Bristow, VA",1,7,4,3.0,1/2/2015,"BJS has been a welcome  addition to this franchise  heavy corner of Prince William  County.  It's a good environment with plenty of tvs featuring sporting events and the draught beer list is superb.  Food is above average pub fare with a diversity of well priced options.  I will add, however, that our experience with the wait  staff has been less than ideal.  We've brought in large groups and they have had difficulty in keeping our drinks refreshed, mixed up dishes, and have been less than friendly.  My guess is that they are understaffed.  Looking forward to visits in 2015."
Ms. Blue ..,"Washington, DC",3,60,40,1.0,7/7/2014,"Not impressed ! Its a wing n beer joint that happens to have nice booths nice tables fried food ,horrible service"
B Y.,"Manassas, VA",19,122,83,3.0,9/5/2014,"I've been here twice, the good seems decent but nothing to write home about. Maybe the ""third times a charm"""
Tamesia J.,"Gainesville, VA",13,14,9,4.0,9/14/2014,"First time visiting and already making plans to revisit.   The menu is huge.  Appetizers,  entrées, and beer all were quite tasty and very responsibly priced.  The cocktails were a bit over priced to me, ranging between 8.50 and $10.00.  Our waitress was extremely pleasant and knowledgeable on the entire menu,  including the beers.   We were pleased with all of her suggestions.  The  atmosphere is great for date night ( dining area) or girls night (bar area).  Several flat screens located throughout also."
Joe W.,"Fauquier County, VA",1,5,3,3.0,4/22/2014,"Bj's is new to Gainesville, and so far, they are trying to hit their stride, as service is hit or miss (we've dined there five times now).  The first time, it was 100% a hit (food was great, service was great).  The next time, only a few weeks later, we had high expectations, and after being seated, were forgotten most of the evening.  Our waiter entered the witness protection program, and we spent the next 90 minutes constantly trying to track someone down to get our drinks, focus on the fact that our entrees arrived but no appetizers, while someone tried to deliver the wrong food to us (meant for other tables) several times.  Several dishes had to be sent back (cold, over salted, etc).  It was the ""Longest"" dinner ever, most of it spent waiting.  Still, we went back and had a really good experience on another day, followed by yet another bad experience.  On one ""bad"" day, the crowd was not nearly as big as the day they were excellent, so it's not that they were overwhelmed by the crowd.  So it's all about who is working that day - so I guess we need to get the names of all the folks working the days we had a great meal and great service and call ahead to ensure the A team is working!!   Bottom line:  The menu is diverse, when they are ""on"" the food and service is very good, and the beer (especially my favorite, HopStorm IPA) is excellent.  They simply need to find consistency."
