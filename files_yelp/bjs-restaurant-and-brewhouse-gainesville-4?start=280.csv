Andrea W.,"Gainesville, VA",0,22,,4.0,7/3/2015,Good food and great beer selection. Nice addition to the Gainesville area. We haven't had a meal we didn't like yet.
J W.,"Ketchikan, AK",13,6,1,1.0,3/21/2015,"New and clean with decent food. Customer service is a perpetual disappointment. We keep trying hoping it is an isolated issue. Sadly, it is not. Go to Firebirds instead!"
Darrin K.,"Gainesville, VA",0,9,,5.0,8/2/2014,"Bjs brewhouse another favorite place for me and my wife to go to. The place is usually busy, but that is a good thing when it comes to restaurants. My favorite burger is the deluxe burger, but any other burger you get there is top-notch and delicious along with their wedge fries! This place is known for their burgers and beer of course, since its a brewhouse."
Brian M.,"Clifton, VA",4,48,39,1.0,8/22/2015,"The hostess staff were welcoming, courteous, and friendly. However after that the evening went south. Our waitress must have been having a bad day and it reflected in her attitude towards us. Very ubrupt, dis-missive, and punctuated by tossing the tablewear down in the middle. But it gets better as the drink order took her about 20 minutes just to get and then deliver. The food order was just as lengthy. For a burger the ordeal took over 30 minutes. Then when she brought my son's burger out it was the wrong order...she replaced it with another wrong order...and finally on the 3rd try ...success. Our order was cold the food was not at all ejoyable or tasty...maybe it was partially influenced by the overall atmosphere that we as customers were a ""bother"" and somehow didn't matter. Oh, it was not a busy night at all.  If you want a beer i think the place would work. For food and good service try another place...there are plenty there. Skip this place. Such a disappointment."
Gretchen H.,"Bristow, VA",107,11,,1.0,10/5/2014,"Curbside was a joke. Been a fan but ordered curbside and had to call 3 x before anyone would answer (note rings about 20x then service cuts off). When I finally got someone Kaitlin said she doesn't work takeout and wasn't offering assistance so I asked her to find out status. Finally good delivery comes out and I explain no one is answering she doesn't say anything and starts to walk off. When I asked her name she said Kaitlin. I'm sorry but courtesy in food service, especially someone in a hostess or position to handle customers is lacking today. Disappointing."
Lilly R.,"Nokesville, VA",7,76,,3.0,11/16/2014,Came here on a busy game day and our waiter was all over the place. He kept forgetting  about us and we had to flag him down a couple of times. I ordered  a pizza and it was very flavorful  well as their selection of beer.
K A.,"Reston, VA",1,71,,4.0,11/14/2014,"I have been to this place a few times & I get the same results each time, great food and great service.  The only hesitation I had the last time, when I walked in there was a lady with a huge dog. (now, that may be a working dog, I don't know) but it was just weird seeing the dog moving around and shaking his tail while you eat.  overall, great place to hang out. definitely going again."
Don S.,"Washington, DC",189,31,2,3.0,9/30/2014,"We decided to give BJ's another try.  We went during off-hours and there were very few patrons, so the experience was the complete opposite of that of my previous review.  Lesson learned.  The food is still good.  We'll steer clear of BJ's during busy times and stop by during off hours."
Michael S.,"Warrenton, VA",13,5,,2.0,1/23/2015,"We went on Tuesday and had a pretty bad experience. The server kept disappearing. The food took forever to come out. When we eventually got our food the plates were very hot, but the food was cold. My wife had gotten the turkey club which room temperature. She mentioned it to the waitress and the waitress's response was the sandwich was supposed to be a cold sandwich. My wife had it before and it was a hot sandwich.  For the price of the food I would expect better service and food quality It'll be a while before I go back."
Nina W.,"Raleigh, NC",0,24,,4.0,1/14/2016,"Very pleasant dining experience.  Food and wine were above average, and the service was very efficient.  Nice atmosphere as well."
Joe B.,"Washington, DC",57,30,,2.0,8/25/2014,"Service started good when they first opened. Now it just flat out sucks! I'm dead serious, will it stop you from going?? Probably not but you will learn after you throw your hard earned money down the drain for sub par food with service to match. However beer is good and the bar area is not bad if that's what you are going for."
Adam N.,"Haymarket, VA",1,18,,4.0,1/14/2015,"We had a nice meal in the bar area tonight. I had the Jalapeño Burger with wedge fries. The burger was cooked as it should have been and the fries were hot and tasty. I like the BJ's Blond (beer) best, it's light but has a nice flavor. Our servers have been REALLY good the last 2 trips as well."
Allison B.,"Washington, DC",5,50,10,2.0,3/28/2014,"On par with other chains like Ruby Tuesday. Food was just okay, drinks good but hard to screw up that. Actually, I'd probably prefer Ruby Tuesday over BJ's which isn't saying much as I haven't been there in years. Many other better options in the same area. Probably won't be back. Staff was friendly!"
Ken M.,"Manassas, VA",0,3,7,1.0,3/16/2014,Was super underwhelmed with our first visit to BJs brewhouse. The server wasn't very helpful and only stopped by a couple times. We were left waiting several times and had to get her attention. And if someone orders from the gluten free menu you should ask or go ahead an assume they don't want croutons on their salad. The menus were cumbersome and not organized well at all. Felt like cheesecake factory menus. Their glutten free slection was very small. My GFs pizza was pathetic. My grilled chicken was over cooked and dry. The appetizer was so delayed it came with the main course. We ordered a cherry coke and when it showed up she told us it was just coke and grenadine and it was way over sweet to boot. The only time she was attentive was after she dropped off the bill and we felt rushed to leave. Will not be returning.
Chris M.,"Fairfax, VA",62,8,1,2.0,6/6/2015,Took over an hour to bring out our food. We ordered burgers and there was countless families around us that got their food after we had our order taken getting served and even paying and leaving before we got our food.  The manager comped our appetizer. Gee thanks. Missed seeing a movie because you guys forgot to put our food in. Used to recommend this place. Not anymore. You're only as good as your employees.
Jessica T.,"Occoquan, VA",47,20,2,1.0,3/22/2014,I don't understand the point of calling ahead if they make you wait more time than quoted when you arrive. Like 30 to 40 additional minutes.
Mario O.,"Bristow, VA",0,11,2,2.0,3/2/2014,"Absolutely underwhelming... My Bride and I have been looking forward to trying BJ's since construction started and today was our day.  When we got there the place was pretty busy, but we were seated almost as soon as we got there, though where we were seated was cramped and offered no privacy at all...and the din of the crowd bordered on the ridiculous. The decor is very nice...and the service was good though our waiter became a little scarce once the food came out (which took a really long time). We started off with the pot stickers which very well could have come from the freezer section at Giant...nothing spectacular about them at all... My Bride got the Cajun shrimp Caesar salad and I ordered the grilled pork chops.  Both entrees were barely seasoned (I think the  only seasoning my green beans had was the salt that was added to the water when they were boiled). My Bride's shrimp were tiny and not well-seasoned at all...certainly NOT Cajun...the salad was very lightly dressed with what was not even a good Caesar dressing.  My chops tasted as though they just put a little salt and pepper and slapped  them on the grill. I've had much better food at the big chain restaurants (Chili's, Outback, McDonald's)... Needless to say, we will not be returning to BJ's... If you're looking for a place to watch a game and eat some average pub grub, then this might be the place to go, otherwise take your $50+ elsewhere...you'll be glad you did..."
Morganne A.,"Warrenton, VA",8,20,,5.0,5/8/2014,"Jason and I have found a new place to add to our top list  of favs! The beers are fantastic! My favorite is the Nutty Brewnette. The Parmesan crusted chicken is amazing and so are the pastas! Next time I'll try the jalopeno burger and maybe some desert (something I rarely do, but I can't resist their amazing selection).  The service is on key and super friendly. The patio is by far the best place to enjoy some stuffed mushrooms and a cold IPA. I feel so classy when I sit in the patio area. Thanks for picking Gainesville, va to do business! I've been there twice in one week and decided that's where I want to go for my birthday!"
Courtney S.,"Manassas, VA",3,12,,5.0,10/4/2014,"LOVE this restaurant! My boyfriend and I have made this our ""go-to"" place. We've been going to BJ's consistently since the restaurant opened. The food never ceases to amaze us. They are always adding new things to the menu, so there is always something to try! I have not found a dish that I did not enjoy. The portions are large in size, I'm always going home with leftovers! The pizzas are excellent, full of flavor. We enjoy all of their microbrews as well. We have yet to have a bad experience here. And we can never leave without ordering one of their pizookies for dessert- a must have!!"
Courtney P.,"Manassas, VA",60,43,,3.0,5/27/2015,"Came here on Memorial Day for a quick lunch with my mom and best friend. The food was great, we each ordered a salad, I believe mine was called the south west or something like that, it had corn, black beans and avocados and the dressing was fantastic. I wish I could give more stars but our service was horrible. We arrived around 11:45 and the place was dead and through out our whole dining experience we barely saw our waiter, water glasses never filled, never checked on and he never came around for the bill ! I'm not really sure where he went off to.. After looking around, the manager comes by and ask to take our plates and we state that our food was great but we can't find our waiter and we would please like the check. She was polite and friendly, but she could tell we were a bit annoyed. Right before signing the bill, our waiter comes over like okay, thanks ! No sorry, I got slammed, nothing. It was frustrating. I very rarely leave anything under $10.00, well I did that day..I would come back to BJ's, I just hope I get a different waiter."
