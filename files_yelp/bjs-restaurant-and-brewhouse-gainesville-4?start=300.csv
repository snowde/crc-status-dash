Ed M.,"Chantilly, VA",72,2,,2.0,4/27/2014,Awful slow service that is unknowledgeable about the menu.   Should have the new restaurant and new staff kinks worked out by now.
Juli T.,"Gainesville, VA",38,20,3,3.0,7/2/2014,"First meal was great!!  So I ordered it 2 other times and it was different every time, not bad but not as good as the first time.  Lemon thyme chicken.  The rootbeer was not the best. The gluten free pizza dough was the best I had around here.   Great service and food was hot."
Allison L.,"Bristow, VA",1,7,5,5.0,9/12/2014,"Great selection of beers and bar drinks, great menu with plenty of choices for everyone, great ambiance! You can't go wrong with BJ's!! They also have mobile pay which you can do if you sign up, it is so cool! You can also add yourself to the wait list before you leave home so when you get there you have a shorter wait"
Logan N.,"Haymarket, VA",50,11,2,4.0,3/9/2014,"BJs is the ""new"" restaurant in Gainesville, VA, with that said, be expecting everybody and their mom going to this place.  If you are okay with waiting for awhile on a Friday or Saturday night for a table then this is the place for you.  Or you can do what I do!  Go hang out at the bar with all the delicious beers they serve, there is a beer for every type of beer lover. Food is plentiful here and the menu looks like the size of Cheesecake Factory's menu.  I haven't ordered much food yet, but I do enjoy their flat bread pizzas and the cookie desserts are pretty addicting.  If you like warm soft cookies with ice cream get the BJs pizzookie (sp?), it will fix your sweet tooth craving!"
Rich M.,"Nokesville, VA",1,8,1,5.0,3/12/2014,"Nice too have a good choice in food and beer in the area.  Craft beers, handmade soda, great food.  A true gem, the waits can be long but that is because it is one of the better places to eat in the area, hardly BJs fault.  Talk to the morons at the planning board..."
Annabel R.,"Magnolia, DE",0,3,,2.0,11/7/2015,"Annoyed. Value your customer 's time and give accurate wait estimates. Was told there was a 30 minute wait. Checked at 40 minutes and was told 5 more minutes. Well, after being told four more times ""5 more minutes, your table is being cleared right now""....total bs - after a 1&1/2 hour wait, It finally took a manager to get us a table. Ridiculous. With that said, our server was very nice and attentive."
gary k.,"Bristow, VA",75,32,45,5.0,3/13/2014,Pizza is really good. The Pizookies are the bomb! Porter beer was really good. If you get there after 5PM be prepared to wait.
Michael M.,"Warrenton, VA",5,105,1,4.0,6/2/2014,"This is my second time here and both times I have had a good experience.  Both times I have gone have been just after the lunch rush so it hasn't been busy so I get a table right away.  The servers have been attentive and alert to my needs.  This visit I tried the deep dish pizza.  I got the small because I wanted dessert and it was small.  It was like a Red Barron Single Serve Deep Dish but it tasted better.  I tried the Pazooki's trio where you pick 3 different Pazooki's.  It's a warm cookie with ice cream smothered in chocolate or caramel, depending on what Pazooki you choose.  They were all good and I would have been happy just eating those."
Kelly J.,"Culpeper, VA",1,9,,1.0,4/4/2016,"First time here and last time here. I've been in the service industry for 12 years and this place really blew my mind. When we first arrived we were hardly greeted by a female hostess who I am also assuming was a manager. The place was dead around 12 in the afternoon last tuesday, and the hostess seemed to be annoyed that anyone was coming. After being seated we were greeted by a friendly server thankfully or I would have just walked out based on the hostess. We ordered a cobb salad, which was ok... and also ordered the new triple decker sandwich, which was absolutely horrible.  The bread it was on was disgusting, the meat seemed like it came out of a package and it completely lacked any flavor including the non existent italian dressing it was supposed have. When the sandwich was dropped which came with fries...there was no ketchup? who doesn't bring ketchup with fries? So I asked the food runner if he could go grab some ketchup for me and that took 4 minutes. SAD. After paying the bill, we headed out only to have the hostess not say ""thank you for coming in"" or "" have a nice day,"" she has awful customer service skills! Incredibly disappointed and will never be coming back or recommending your corporate restaurant to anyone!"
Saraa B.,"Ashburn, VA",58,143,15,4.0,4/15/2014,"Been here 3 times so far. I have ordered the same thing twice; a hand tossed pizza w/ garlic olive oil and pineapple ( so delicious!!).  skip the potato appetizers as they're premade/ frozen= totally gross..  ordered a cheeseburger also ( rarely eat meat but was tasty!) and the skinny fries r fab! The cream soda- yumm! Had a side salad( ok) also the bbq salad w/ salmon( salmon good.altho its probably the farm raised uh, cooked perfect tho) but the salad was just a lil above ok as it was shredded iceberg and not much flavor n dressing. Consistent and above average for the crap Gainesville has. Our go to spot now..."
Ann W.,"Fredericksburg, VA",0,3,,1.0,10/12/2014,"I have visited BJ'S in California, Colorado and Florida. This particular restaurant in Gainesville is a huge disappointment! Service was poor. Little things like providing plates for appetizers and napkins did not seem to be important.  The food was cold. The meat was dry. The lettuce in the salad was wilted and had obviously been made up hours previously.  We will not be back!"
JusSumMom ..,"Washington, DC",0,7,,3.0,10/8/2014,"Best options are the pizza and homemade soda. Service is NOT so good. This is our 5th time here and we wanted to love it. We came when the restaurant was dead hoping service would be better than the last couple of times and it was worse. The server Ashley failed to write everything down, brought us wrong food and then tried to convince us what we had was good. We didn't have time for her to remake food when we had a 4 month old and 3 year old running out of patients. This was not the first time either food came out wrong or just never came at all.  We waited 45 minutes at the curb side window before because of the chaotic service. They need to better manage the restaurant. Not worth a long wait but worth trying it on a slow day for the pizza."
Jim L.,"Warrenton, VA",69,57,9,2.0,3/3/2014,"The 1st trip to BJs was not the most pleasant, but I will give them the benefit of being a new place and working out the kinks in the system.  I will try it again to see if there is any improvement. Food & Drink availability was a game!  We had 6 people at our table and were told no less than 8 times that they didn't have a certain or food.  After completing our dinner, the waitress came back to say 1 of the Beers previously was now available, which our friend gladly ordered and liked (more on this later).  The waitress, Kaitlyn (sp?) was a bubbly and pleasant girl, but very forgetful.  We asked for ice water, lemons and a side of marinara, she returned to the table to check on us 2 times before FINALLY bringing each of the items w/her, that was after reminding her 2 times!!!  Now the checks, oh boy!  6 people at 1 both, all couples, we asked for the checks, she brought 4 checks, 2 checks for 2 couples and 1 individual check each for the other couple!  WTH?  After sorting out the check issue, we moved to the bar area (this is the more from above), 1 person ordered the beer that became available later in our dinner (different server in bar area), who argued with everyone that the type of beer 1 in our party wanted was not available.  After asking the waitress to listen very closely, it was explained to her, we know the beer wasn't available earlier, but they tapped a keg and now it was available, although she continued to argue she agreed to check AND what do you know, she returned with the beer that she said wasn't available! The reason I gave 2 stars was because the food was good! I had the meat lovers deep dish pizza and we shared potato skins, nice portions and very tasty!  Per others at the table, Fish & Chips were OK, small pieces of fish with very think and greasy breading, Fish Tacos were excellent!  The New York style pizza looked like a boxed pizza and didn't appear very appetizing.  I didn't taste it, the couple eating it, didn't finish it and didn't comment GOOD or BAD. Overall I hope BJs gets better, its seems like it could be a great place, but the things that make a place GREAT are lacking in my estimation.  I won't spend $100 for bad service and to be told that the foods and drinks I've ordered are unavailable!"
Natalie K.,"Haymarket, VA",0,27,1,4.0,2/25/2014,"We went to dinner on a Monday night around 7:30. There was no waiting for a table. We were seated immediately. It was a busy night, but our waiter was friendly and attentive the entire time. I ordered a glass of wine and my bf ordered a double of whiskey. Very good pours, no skimping! Points for that. We also ordered the angus beef sliders as an appetizer. They were also very good and came quickly. For our entrees, I ordered the balsamic glazed chicken and he ordered the ribeye. My chicken was awesome! The white cheddar potatoes that it comes with were alright. I would equate them with wedding potatoes, not terrible, but not amazing. The bf is kind of a steak snob, and he said his steak was mediocre at best, but he didn't expect it to be anything close to Ruth's Chris either.  We will be returning, but just not ordering the steak. :)"
Tom C.,"Atlanta, GA",278,7,,4.0,2/8/2014,"Visited first week they've been open and they're already leaps and bounds above Bar Louie. BJ's beers are pretty solid and the price can't be beat. Be sure to get the 8 beer tasting for $12.95. Full 5oz pours. Deep dish pizzas are good and it's great they offer to go. Best of all? They sell growlers to go, good idea for picking up dinner on the way home. Only gripe we had was the amount of time it took to receive our food. First week I'm sure it will improve. We'll definitely be back"
Art P.,"Gainesville, VA",0,9,1,5.0,8/28/2015,Absolutely love this place!! The pizzas are so good as well as the fish and chips and the Parmesan Crusted Chicken. Great atmosphere too! I would recommend the Mediterranean Pizza!
Mike U.,"Gainesville, VA",7,23,,3.0,6/9/2014,"We like the food and the service but we can't get a table other than off hours.   The beers are great, the salads we had were very good and our kids loved the options, and there are lots of options .   They can have the best food in the world but if you can't get to it, does it matter? We have a growing list of restaurants in our area that don't require a two hour wait and some even take reservations, like we wish BJ's would. If we return, it will have to be during the week for a late lunch."
Rachel R.,"Fairfax, VA",25,39,34,4.0,8/14/2014,"I wanted to update my review, initially when they first opened the service at the hostess stand was terrible, but now that they have figured everything out it is much better! I don't think I've waited more than 5 minutes for a table when we've come in. Food is still consistently good and I'm excited to try their outdoor seating once it cools off a bit! I recommend the Jeremiah Red from their beer selection and their yummy small plate tomato and mozzarella app!"
Amanda R.,"Stafford, VA",0,1,,5.0,8/13/2015,Always a great dining experience at BJs! The Caesar salad was delicious and their new tavern cut pizza was excellent. They have so many selections that you can never go wrong.  My kids love to eat here also as they offer many great choices.
Dave S.,"Haymarket, VA",0,24,,2.0,6/1/2015,"As usual, the food was good but the service was sub par. We all argued about coming  here, but in the end we couldn't think of anything better. If the food wasn't good and the happy hour specials great, we wouldn't come back."
