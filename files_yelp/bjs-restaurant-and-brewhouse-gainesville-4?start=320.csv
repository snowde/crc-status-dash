Kaitlyn S.,"Newport News, VA",1,8,2,4.0,8/9/2015,"This place is pretty awesome. The servers are always warm and welcoming. The people cleaning up tables work their butts off to turn those tables around in a snap. It can be a bit overcrowded at times, but the atmosphere is great."
hriday k.,"Reston, VA",10,16,1,5.0,3/15/2014,"I have been there twice now. The deep dish pizza was excellent. I also ordered their beer sampler and found that all their beers were excellent. The second time I went, I had to wait almost 45 mins. The wait staff was friendly. I like this place better than Bar Louie down the street as this place feels a little more down to earth."
Carla D.,"Warrenton, VA",9,13,,3.0,5/23/2014,"We've been here a few times and the pizookies are out of this world. Reason enough to try the place. Service is ok...pretty on par with all the restaurants in the area. The pastas are great and consistent. The salmon with lemon wine sauce is phenomenal. However, the steak is pretty mediocre, the mashed potatoes are cold even when you ask for a warmer serving. Do not try the calamari. Yikes. So as long as you don't mind a long wait and order what you know is good...and end with a cookies and cream pizookies, you're all good."
R S.,"Cornelius, NC",0,4,1,1.0,7/31/2015,We have been to this restaurant multiple times..each time we go we hope to find an improvement.  Service is simply awful..usually takes as long as 30 minutes to be served and if you add a dessert it's another thirty.  One time we went and half the table was done eating before the last two were served.  It might be forgiven if the food was consistently good but that that is never the case.  We have gone and had the best pizza and the worst on the next visit.  Don't ever get the kale Brussels sprout salad...they forgot to roast the Brussels sprouts and put raw ones on it.  At the end of the day we after the last visit have decided it is not worth our time and dining experience to continue to give them a tenth try.
D D.,"Fairfax, VA",1,45,18,4.0,4/3/2015,"Great place- good location.  Craft beer, but still a ""chain.""  Decent food for a reasonable price.  Jeremiah Red is one of my all time favorite Reds.  Good selection to choose from.  Happy Hour is well worth it!  Definitely recommend a visit."
Dan R.,"Warrenton, VA",0,5,,4.0,7/24/2014,"We have been to this BJ's twice for dinner since we moved to this area. Both have been very good experiences and we will continue to go here in the future.  The food is pretty good, the prices aren't bad, and the staff is friendly. BJ's is one of the better restaurants that we have been to in the Gainesville area and it is a place we will continue to frequent."
Ashley G.,"Haymarket, VA",0,7,3,1.0,10/27/2014,"I don't get the hype around this place. I've been here now twice, both times I've been nothing but disappointed.  The first time, got some kind of salad with honey mustard and chicken strips on top. Nothing special bc they were out of romain for Caesar and about 3/4 of their other salads that contained romain. And the menu is pretty huge but nothing on it is interesting or sounds extremely appetizing. Hence why I settled for a salad. Well it was awesome to eat half of my salad, ask for a box, and then as I'm packaging the salad, I find a hair at the bottom. Ick. I will say they took it off the check and were apologetic, which was nice. I get it, you could find a hair in your food anywhere. I don't fault them for this but it was unappetizing.  But when I went back to give it a second try, I was left even more disappointed. The only good part of my experience was my rum and coke, which I tried to explain to the waiter I needed on a separate check because I was on a business dinner and he replied ""yeah alcohol on a separate check. I get it."" Umm okay? I was just making sure you knew, not trying to insult your intelligence...-anyways  I understand I was with a rather large group but my meal came with the wrong sides. I didn't want to tell the waiter bc he has already been being kind of rude and I honestly didn't want to ruffle his little feathers anymore. I ordered my steak medium well, the thing came out trampled to death, dry as all hell. The mashed potatoes tasted like they'd been cooked 4 days ago, out of a box and then frozen. And then I thought id bring a dessert home for my friend and I. Yeah I ordered a salted caramel ""pazookie"" - their version of a big skillet cookie with ice cream. Upon opening it up at home, it was completely burnt and dry and overall not tasty.  Needless to say, I'm done with this place."
Marc B.,"Cedar Park, TX",0,19,,4.0,6/30/2014,"I have been here a few times already. Great beer and excellent pizza; their other food is pretty good too. Outside seating is nice but can get hot due to poor shading. Overall, great value and a lot of fun."
Diane D.,"Centreville, VA",0,56,,4.0,3/3/2015,Loved the chicken pita tacos and my husband gave high marks to the Santa Fe Salad.  Service was great.
Sari V.,"Gainesville, VA",12,31,,4.0,6/21/2014,Amazing food at surprisingly reasonable prices. Their beers are great so definitely order a sampler and try some out.
Melanie G.,"Williamsburg, VA",10,99,,3.0,4/9/2015,"The foot was decent, but overpriced.  Don't be fooled by the picture of the nachos on the appetizer menu.  It is a tiny portion.  Definitely a rip off."
Stacy W.,"Centreville, VA",29,19,12,5.0,2/22/2014,"I was skeptical. We tried Bar Louie when it opened but I wasn't impressed at all.THIS PLACE IS HEAVEN. Food porn all the way; 0 They have everything you could think of.Avacado eggrolls are to die for. They have the best mint mojito ive ever had in my life & Ive put back a few in my 32 years.  (Im a former bartender so im picky with my drinks lol) I could go on for pages about this new spot.  Im already trying to decide what to get tonight. Oh & the prices are great.The Average price is about $10-15. I hate a place that charges 18-20 for tomato sauce/pasta when its mediocre at best. Best part- While you're waiting for your table they pass out samples to keep you tied over.Deep Dish tomato& cheese is amazing.I l lived in Chicago so I know what a pie tastes like. Cool feature they have is call ahead seating we used that & we had enough time to get a blonde ale & a blue moon,  by then our table was ready.  The staff was great too.Ask for Dave as your server. Hes great not to mention tall dark & handsome :-D SN-My date had a bad headache that came out of nowhere so we asked a female server if she had any Tylenol & 5 minutes later we had our pick of ibuprofen & Tylenol. Im starving. .wait what time are they open bc I may go alone for lunch !"
Marc T.,"Bristow, VA",1,3,,1.0,5/26/2014,"Honestly, don't waste your valuable time or hard earned money eating here.  Service is rotten (1.5hr wait time and 55min wait for our order), management couldn't care less.  waitress mislead us (my son ordered a meal, wanted to add a potato and waitress said it would be $0.75 but when the bill came it was $5!).   the manager came by and seriously did not bother to look up at us when speaking to us (notice, not with us) and we could not hear a word he said, when we asked him to speak up and repeat what he said, he left the table.  chops were like shoe leather and the place is incredibly noisy.  I will not be going back to this place to pay for over-priced food and rotten service with management that just does not care."
C L.,"Warrenton, VA",0,22,21,1.0,3/8/2015,"Horrible experience - 3 times in 3 months I have had a bad experience - won't be back - when I brought up the issue with the manager (Brandy), she was arrogant and rude. Front of the house was great and always has been. Carly, our waitress, was awesome and tried to make the situation better.  Back of the house ALWAYS gets my order wrong and I have strict diet restrictions due to health issues.  They are well on their way to killing someone.  If you want your food cooked their way, instead of the way you ordered it, this is the place for you."
Tim J.,"Gainesville, VA",1,21,,5.0,5/11/2015,Good is always great. Beer too. A couple bad things are call ahead seating and overall host staff. Quoted times are always wrong and the host staff always seems lost. Once you get in it is great.
T T.,"Gainesville, VA",0,3,,5.0,3/22/2015,Delicious food! BJ's has many options for entrees and fabulous desserts!
Bert K.,"Vienna, VA",0,1,,2.0,11/15/2014,BJ's staff is so used to being crowded and making their money from volume that when it's not busy they have no idea of what customer service means.  I have been at the bar on three different occasions when they were less than half full and the bartenders completely ignored me. When I finally did get a beer I went ignored for lengthy stretches even after my glass was empty.  To say that customer service is not emphasized is an under statement.
Risa A.,"Gainesville, VA",0,19,,3.0,3/10/2015,"Their house beers are are delicious.  I wasn't impressed by the food or the service.  And it wasn't busy.  I'll likely visit again, but maybe just for brews."
Stacy D.,"Gainesville, VA",33,14,,4.0,2/13/2015,"I have been to BJs seven or eight times and have always had a good experience. Friendly staff, prompt service, and good food. The prices are good, too. Love the call ahead feature!"
Global T.,"Haymarket, VA",0,5,,1.0,7/5/2014,"We waited a couple of months before trying the new establishment. We arrived for a late lunch and were seated in a booth near the bar. The menus were sticky and dirty, the booth had used utensils on the floor under our table. They were out of 3 different beers I asked for. The food was not good and expensive. I can not believe it is rated so high in Yelp. We will not be returning here again. Good Luck!"
