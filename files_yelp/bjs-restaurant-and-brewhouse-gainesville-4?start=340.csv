Phil M.,"Haymarket, VA",0,18,5,2.0,6/12/2014,Just ok... Food was mediocre at best.  Beer was ok but not worth a special trip.  Grafton Street is much better.
Hillary S.,"Sterling, VA",1,17,,5.0,11/1/2014,"Randomly found this place on our way back from a haunted house. Food was amazing!  Beer was amazing! Atmosphere was great especially for being about 9:30 at night, lots of televisions perfect for football! We will 100% be back there were a lot of things on the menu we want to try :)"
Robert T.,"Warrenton, VA",0,2,1,2.0,1/4/2015,The food is average to a little above. I found it to have a lot of flavor and the three times I've come here it's always been hot. But as far as the service from the hostesses to the waiters it's piss poor. Terrible service overall. Waiters are clueless and don't try to say the least to keep beverages filled and to check in with you. Although the food is good I wont be back solely because of the terrible service they offer. But if you care more about food and at a decent price I'd say go ahead and stop in. If you care more about service and it being timely I'd say skip it.

Joe B.,"Gainesville, VA",0,2,,2.0,2/15/2014,"Just had lunch there for Valentines Day and was hoping for better. It all started when I called ahead to see if there was a wait, this was at 12:50PM. I was told there was no wait therefore we did not need to be put on the call ahead list. When we arrived at 1:10 we had to wait 15 minutes for a table. I realize 15 minutes is not a long wait but the should have been placing people on a call ahead list. When we were finally seated our waitress seemed very pleasant although she did not seem to know the menu very well and therefore, could not recommend much other than the pizza. We started with an order of the tortilla soup and corn fritters which both were very good. As for our main course my wife ordered the pork chops and I the jambalaya. My wife's food came out in a reasonable time, but mine took much longer. I told my wife to start without me, as her food was starting to get cold. When the waitress came by to see how we were enjoying our food she asked me where my jambalaya was and I had to look at her cross-eyed and tell her it had not come out yet. She apologized and went back into the kitchen to see where my order was. When my plate finally arrived my wife was done with her meal and I asked for a box for her left overs. As I am halfway through my meal and still eating while my wife is sitting there waiting for me, our waitress comes by and asks me if I wanted a box for my meal as I am still eating. I told her no, because I was going to finish it. This made me feel like I was being rushed out the door to free up the table. At that time we ordered a desert to take home, since we kind of got the feel of how long things would take remember I am only half way through my main course and was already ordering dessert. The next time the waitress came to our table she brought our check and took my empty plate, this was at 2:48pm and our dessert has not come out yet. Next I am overhearing the manager at the table next to us apologizing for the poor service and the patrons advising him that they just arrived and there had no problem at all. Then he realizes he is at the wrong table. When he comes to us and apologizes he had the nerve to say he had wished the waitress hadn't already processed our check because he would have bought our dessert. A little too late if you ask me. Anyways after he left we started to think about taking them up on a free dessert to bring to our neighbors who were nice enough to watch them while we could have a nice Valentines Day lunch together. We asked the waitress and they if this was possible which they had no problem with it and placed the order, it is now 3:00pm. 3:10 no dessert, 3:20 no dessert, 3:30 no dessert. Finally I got up from the table at 3:35 and the waitress was bringing out the dessert. She again apologized and asked that we give them another try in the future. I responded by saying it would be a while before we came back.  So in conclusion: Ambiance: Nice Service: Sucks (hopefully it will get better) Food: Mediocre (A step below Mike's American Grill) Management: Sucked (should have picked up our check and been much more involved)"
Caitlin S.,"Woodbridge, VA",0,11,5,3.0,9/21/2014,"The ""bar food""(mozzarella sticks, south west eggs rolls) are good and what you'd expect. I ordered the blackened chicken pasta. It just tasted like salt and butter. There were no other flavors to be had. management did take it off the bill so I do give them credit for making it right."
Dina K.,"Warrenton, VA",0,39,,2.0,3/4/2014,"Service was TERRIBLE...asked 4 times for water, lemons, etc.  Every time he came to the table I said ""water"".  The food that came out was either cold or the bread was hard as a rock.  Been sitting under the heat lamp too long.  Finally got the bill and just couldn't take the wait anymore.  Went to the hostess stand to see if they could find the waiter to get him to ring me out.  They were not apologetic.  Sounds like it was the norm based on the other reviews."
Laura B.,"Bristow, VA",0,1,,5.0,9/11/2014,Came here for lunch and the atmosphere is great! The food is also really good and they craft their own beer. Our waiter was attentive and offered great suggestions. I will definitely be returning.
Sarah L.,"Gainesville, VA",0,13,1,4.0,11/20/2015,"Went to BJ's last weekend with the fam to attend the fireworks / holiday festivities at Virgina Gateway.  Arrived an hour before the fireworks and every restaurant was PACKED.  Bj's had about a 90 minute wait to be seated in the restaurant, but we were able to snag a table in the bar area within 5 minutes.  I have been to BJ's on numerous occasions and although decent, I haven't had any noteworthy experiences.  But, I felt inclined to write a review after last Saturday, because of the outstanding service.  Every table was full, there wasn't even standing room available at the bar, but you never would have known that from the service.  Not only did our food come out quickly, allowing us to make the fireworks show, our waiter 'Daniel S' was incredibly attentive and patient.  He never seemed flustered or annoyed or short on time, even though his hands were more than full.  So impressed but his exemplary service and the quick service from the kitchen.  I have never been a huge BJ's fan, but after the way they handled the crowd last weekend, I will definitely be back more often."
April B.,"Goldvein, VA",0,5,,2.0,4/27/2014,We called ahead and we were told there was no wait and they put our name on a call ahead list. When we arrived about 15 minutes later we ended up waiting well over 40 minutes to be seated. When asking the hostesses about the wait we were simply ignored. The wait might not be annoying for some but we had an 11 month old so had we of known we would have gone elsewhere. They acted as if we'd be seated shortly. Once we were finally seated we luckily had a great server and the food was good.  But for us we don't plan to return because the food definitely wasn't worth the wait. There are so many other good food choices in the area without having to wait near as long! I'm not sure why they do call ahead because here it is absolutely worthless and will probably just frustrate you even more.
Tonya N.,"Gainesville, VA",0,10,,4.0,11/6/2014,"We went here on Nov. 2nd after my husband's nephew arrived into town unexpectedly. There were seven of us total. We did the call ahead and put our name on the list. We arrived about 20 minutes after calling. When we arrived, the hostess told us we were not on the list. The place was not overcrowded. It was around 2 pm. We only waited about five minutes. We were seated in the back a couple of tables over from the bar area. The heat was blasting. We asked our server to see if she could get it lowered. She did! My husband's nephew and girlfriend ordered three different types of the BJ's beers. They liked them all. My husband had a few beers and they were good as well. They ordered burgers and asked for them medium well and they came out well done. They were good, but cooked a little too long. We ordered the appetizer that has the sampling of cheese sticks to avocado rolls. It was tasty. I ordered the crispy chicken salad. It was good but next time I will ask it to be served without being doused in the dressing. Our server Ashlee was very attentive and kept our drinks refilled and checked on us often. The girl that brought our appetizer was rude though. We asked her for two clean appetizer plates since we were given dirty ones and she had major attitude and eye rolls. We told our server about her. Overall food was good, service was excellent, and we'll be back. I also cashed in on my BJ's rewards which shaved $25 off our bill! Always do the call ahead especially if you are going for dinner."
Mickey B.,"Meyersdale, PA",0,6,,1.0,4/11/2014,Had an awful experience for lunch. What was ordered was not brought out. They took my meal back to kitchen. 35 minutes later my meal was brought back out. Unfortunately my lunch date was done with there meal.   Experienced made worse by floor manager on duty who walked pass table looked back and asked if there was a problem. He didn't understand my not wanting my meal at that time or ever offer a apology. Would like to put his name here but  he never introduced himself. (Had to find out who he was from the manager)
Kathleen H.,"Warrenton, VA",0,8,,2.0,9/22/2014,"Service and atmosphere were good.  My guest's burger was great; the fried calamari was much too floury and dry; and my cobb salad was nearly inedible: iceberg lettuce was chopped so fine, it was like mush and very wet.  The turkey, bacon and cheese were there somewhere, but I had to look for them, and when I found the turkey, they were tiny cubes of gelatinous lunchmeat.  (I ended up taking this ""salad"" home to my two dogs.)  When a menu says turkey and bacon, today's diners are looking for real turkey breast, and pieces of bacon and cheese that can be identified as such.  At $13.50, this salad was nothing short of highway robbery.  Time to enlist the help of Gordon Ramsay.  Having said this, though, I will probably return to try a burger."
D P.,"Haymarket, VA",0,20,,5.0,2/15/2014,My hubby and I have been twice and found the food fabulous and the service excellent. Maybe because they were newly open and still training servers but we didn't want for anything. I had the burger with the skinny fries and my hubby had some sort of chicken sandwich. Both were good. They also have a wide variety of beers. Oh and try their root beer made on site. Fantastic!  I think this might be our new favorite place!
Kenya T.,"Washington, DC",8,22,2,2.0,2/23/2014,"Visited here for a Sunday night dinner.  The place was spacious, atmosphere was nice, the food was pretty decent and the place has one of the most diverse and intriguing alcohol selections I've ever seen.  My beef was with the waitstaff, my waiter in particular... Damon.  We were literally sitting there for fifteen minutes before anyone came to our table.  when our table was finally visited, it was another waiter, not ours that decided to get our drink order.  when he finally came over we gave him all of the orders (appetizer, entrees,,) cause we had no idea when we would see him again.  he put all of orders in at once so, we ended up receiving oir entrees before our appetizer....they took the dinners back to re-cook,...I.e. heat lamp till our appetizer was done.... Damon didnt deliver that either by the way.  he didn't know whether they had guinness on tap, even though he had already served it to my boyfriend. he spent most of the night being social to the other staff.  And we were like one of the two tables that he had, the restaurant was not packed.  we ended up giving half the tip to the other waiter cause he helped more than our own did.  I wanted to like that place, but Damon made it sour for me.  probably will not return to that location....maybe vienna's will be better."
Angela M.,"Gainesville, VA",8,27,1,1.0,11/8/2014,"Predict, Chili's will be next to close, then Nandos, followed by BJ's Brew house, poor customer service & poor quality of food... Firebirds has set the bar high, received excellent customer service all around, nice bar and overall vibe, and clean. Quality of food at Firebirds wasn't horrible, but based on the cost to eat there, there is room for improvement. I paid $17 for a pasta dish, that needed mushrooms and something (sauce, olive oil, etc.) to alleviate the dryness, my 18 year olds pesto chicken pasta dish with, tomatoes & mushrooms is much better. Noticed that the servers in this area and most management think they are above providing a wonderful dining experience. Could be because they aren't cut out to make it in the restaurant business, not willing to go the extra mile to provide all their customers w/ the ultimate dining experience. The best service in this area is going through the drive -thru at Chick Fil A in Gainesville, hint, hint... and now Firebirds. Gainesville definitely is ready for some upscale dining, with the median household income at six figures. I'll just continue to cook at home, or drive to other areas to get the quality of food and service I desire to pay for. Mimi's would have made it if they could have stayed consistent with quality of food & customer service......"
MI R.,"Midlothian, VA",0,46,,4.0,3/26/2014,"Happy hour is packed here. Had a variety of items while there. The drinks at happy hour price are about 40% off - which is a plus, as their drinks are pricy. The pot stickers and stuff mushrooms were really good. Next up was the Kale salad and a veggie pizza. Both were excellent. Staff was engaging and attentive."
Chris R.,"Bristow, VA",0,6,,4.0,3/25/2014,"Great selection of food and beers.  Family friendly, open and spacious layout.  One of the better places in the area to watch a game, get takeout or take out of town guests."
Rebecca B.,"Haymarket, VA",0,9,,5.0,3/21/2014,Minor mistake which the manager took care of. Excellent service pretty decent food.
Rose K.,"Gainesville, VA",0,3,,1.0,4/30/2014,"I wanted to try this place for some time. I came two times before, but left based on the hostess's recommendation (wait time was over an hour). I thought this would be a good sign. We called ahead and arrived before 5 on a Friday and were still told we would have to wait 15 minutes. I'm guessing their strategy is to significantly over-estimate the wait time, because they seated us a couple minutes later. The waitress was fine, but our food tasted terrible. I had the scallops and my husband had a chicken pasta dish. My scallops and his pasta tasted like the main seasoning was black pepper with little else added. Both dishes were too dry to enjoy. I was really hungry, so I ate all the scallops, but the rest of our food was inedible, so we complained to the manager who told us to order something else. Now, I wouldn't otherwise order a burger at a place that is compared to cheesecake factory or sweetwater tavern, but I was too hungry to order another dish that could come out tasting bad, so I did. My husband just ordered dessert. The best thing I can say about the food that came out is that it was edible. The burger was greasy, the dessert tasted like it had been crusted in sugar.  I hate complaining to the manager, but I expect that when I do, he will listen to my complaints and be somewhat generous about the bill. Instead, when the bill came back, I felt that he suspected us of being free-loaders. He charged us for a side order of scallops and for the ceaser salad my husband ordered with his meal as well as the full price of the second items we each ordered. This was quite insulting to me.  My recommendation: go to Chili's. Better food, better manager, friendlier wait-staff."
