Laura Loves Shawn N.,"Haymarket, VA",0,3,,2.0,2/22/2014,"Slow service and average food.. They apologized for the wait but almost 50 minutes to get a burger and flatbread is too long (we did not order an appetizer). Bigger than average bun and burger size, skimpy on bacon (2 slices of thin bacon not adequate for a sizable burger). Ordered steak blue cheese flatbread. Steak pieces were small and dried up. Blue cheese was too overpowering for the dish (I love blue cheese). Also ordered mac and cheese because i have to try it anywhere it is served. Bacon and breadcrumbs make it very greasy - it is kinda creamy but average flavor. I compare every restaurant to Sweetwater because they are affordable, always use fresh high quality meats and ingredients, and are consistent (small menu size makes a huge difference). All in all BJs is an average national chain restaurant. Expect to spend money for something you can make at home better."
