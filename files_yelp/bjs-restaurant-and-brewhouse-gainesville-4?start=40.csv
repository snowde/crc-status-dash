Diana A.,"Rockville, MD",0,7,2,5.0,9/15/2017,"We were in VA for the Nas concert and decided to stop in to get food before heading back to MD. I got the brisket burger and my boyfriend got the pulled pork sandwich. Both meals were delicious!!! Everything was perfectly cooked. What was the most impressive was this restaurant's customer service and attentiveness. If I'm ever back in the Gainesville area, I will definitely stop back in."
Charles B.,"Manassas, VA",35,3,3,2.0,5/22/2016,"After 3 years of dining at this location, had our first bad experience. Our family came out for my birthday. Apps were good. Time for entrees. Everyone's entrees came out expect mine. Melissa the server explained someone took mine mistake. It was a steak and shrimp combo ordered RARE. She said another one would be out in 1 min. After 15-20 mins of waiting still no entree. The ""manager"" brought my food out and said ""well obviously it's off the check."" Cut into the RARE steak mid-well to well. So I told her it was ok I didn't want it. She just walked away. My mom in law said no bring him one Togo. If corporate BJs reads this my account name IPOKHAAN. This was supposed to be my happy 35 birthday dinner but fell way short. Thanks for the salad.... at least yummy.  Later Melissa brought out 3 birthday deserts."
Chris R.,"Alexandria, VA",37,112,40,4.0,2/7/2016,"The food here was really good.  I had the Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos which was really good, my friend had a small 1/2 Pepperoni Extreme and 1/2 Chicken Bacon Ranch Pizza.  The pepperoni was really good, but there was a weird after-taste with the other side, not quite sure what that was all about.  The waitress was awesome too, but one of the food runners took the dessert to the wrong table (the one behind us) and the people at the table took the dessert knowing they didn't order it.  Pretty rude!  When the waitress told them what happened, they said they only took a couple bites of it anyway.  Why take it then?!?  Anyway...I'll definitely be back."
Jennifer J.,"Centreville, VA",2,4,,3.0,8/26/2017,"I'm very generously giving 3 stars because the food has been good when we've visited without children. HOWEVER if dining with children I'd STRONGLY advise you to go elsewhere. They put our name on a list and told us the wait would be 50 minutes, well, 50 minutes came and went and they told us it would be ANOTHER 50 minutes so we had to leave after waiting over an hour with 4 very hungry cranky children."
Devenie G.,"Gainesville, VA",0,10,,1.0,9/17/2017,"We came to watch a particular football game because they have Sunday ticket. We secured a spot at the bar (20 minutes before kick off) in front of the TV that would be playing the game. There were no other customers around. A gentleman came in and while he waited for a hostess to secure him a table he stood at the bar, ordered a sprite, and asked to have that channel changed to a different game. While we were drinking beers and ordered food, we explained that we were watching the game that was originally on and were told that he would not change it back, the other people were here first. Which was inexplicably incorrect. Guess it's time to find another bar with Sunday ticket."
Amber Lynn S.,"Centreville, VA",58,47,6,3.0,2/21/2017,We came with a large group for a birthday. Our server did the best she could taking care of the group of 11 but our food came out at different times and some of the food came cold. Try this place out with a smaller group. The dishes that came out hot were great. Lots of finger food for groups. I'll be back for a smaller table.
Neal E.,"Haymarket, VA",1169,4360,28768,3.0,11/15/2014,I've visited BJ's in other locations. Finally visited the new one in the neighborhood. Ordered a custom flight of Ales to taste - all Pale Ales and IPAs. Was not really impressed with any of their Pale Ale or IPA options. Also ordered their version of Poke - which was not bad. Service was good.
Ryan L.,"Bristow, VA",48,20,15,4.0,2/11/2017,"All around great atmosphere! Decent amount of craft brews available and their burgers are always a go-to for me. They offer awesome deals, so always be on the lookout! So glad to have this restaurant right up the road!"
Tiffany L.,"Gainesville, VA",119,42,55,2.0,10/15/2015,"Gave this place three tries before writing this review. The wait is quite long on the weekend and with such a big restaurant, I don't know why we had to wait around 45 minutes... Anyways, service is typically ok but the food... The food is not.  Everything I tried was either mediocre or bad. The pasta I tried was bland and I couldn't finish half of it. The last time I went, I got the steak, thinking, you can't go wrong with steak, right? I was wrong. BJ Brewhouse showed me that you can go wrong with steak in so many different levels. The meat was tough and hard to cut and it was really, really salty! The only thing I did finish was the cheddar mashed potatoes which was pretty good. I would probably only come here for pizookies... And maybe a beer. But food, never again."
Lauren C.,"Middleburg, VA",22,2,,4.0,4/22/2017,Good food.  Lots of variety.  Good service.  Ahi Tina salad is wonderful!  Burgers are great also with lots of options.  1/2 price pizza on Tuesday's!
Amber C.,"Manassas, VA",48,52,4,3.0,1/21/2017,"From the first time my family and I visited, we all really liked it and now just getting home from our last visit, it's gotten a little stale. The food is average at best and probably is more expensive than it should be for being average. The Classic Burger I had today was super average and wasn't as good as others I've had at other restaurants. The environment is great and service is normally good even on a busy night like tonight, day after the inauguration. People were crowded right at the entrance. Only thing that really keeps me coming back is the Cookies and Cream pizzookie. I love these and they're better than the traditional dessert you find everywhere else. Only other thing is why don't they have grilled cheese available all day? Why only lunch? That's annoying."
Kimberly C.,"Manassas, VA",177,268,112,3.0,9/14/2014,"I have been here several times and love some of the menu items. However. That has changed.  First, the pizookies are amazing. No complaints. Delicious.  The balsamic chicken is also fantastic. I highly recommend. The ahi poke is great; the portion sizes are tremendous and combined with a salad this could be quite filling.  I have ordered the scallops 3-4 times and enjoyed it thoroughly. Tonight was an experience I wish I wasn't paying for. As I sit here at my table and look at my plate, I'm grossed out. The rice was grainy and mushy, the scallops taste entirely different than any time I've had them....they have been doused with pepper and are rendered in edible. The asparagus has been cooked so much it's shriveled and the tips actually fell off like pine needles from a dying Christmas tree. These asparagus probably begged for their lives before being butchered mercilessly.  Not a fan. May not return, because they are inconsistent and why pay for Russian roulette?"
Gleicy A.,"Gainesville, VA",2,14,1,2.0,2/12/2017,Good food. I always get the ahi tuna salad and I love it. The only problem with this place is the service. Last time I came with my family and they messed up my order and I got my salad when everybody was done. Uncomfortable but at least the gave me the salad for free.
Sara M.,"Warrenton, VA",0,8,12,4.0,4/7/2017,"One of my favorite restaurants. Amazing food, the staff is very friendly! The only reason i'm rating it four stars instead of time is the wait time. It used to be very short but has grown to be verrry long, maybe a change in management?"
Kim S.,"Bealeton, VA",5,19,5,5.0,4/29/2017,"We had a wonderful family dinner, my steak arrived under cooked, the manager came over and had another steak brought out promptly and even credited our bill for the inconvenience. The staff was friendly and helpful and they were very quick to rectify the mistake in our order. We will definitely be returning."
Angelique H.,"West Springfield, VA",143,71,95,3.0,8/19/2017,"The floor is insanely slippery. I about took a spill heading to the restroom from the bar, embarrassing and not impressed with that. I had just arrived. So no, it was not alcohol induced lol. The bartender wasn't very nice. Not sure how else to say it other than he wasn't impressionable at all. We are usually very generous tippers, and we tipped exactly 20% this evening. As soon as we sat at the bar the stools had been arranged in groups from previous guests I assume. There were three in our party, and plenty of chairs at the end of the bar. Though the three we sat in were squished together. We proceeded to scoot another chair down beside our three, and the bartender had an immediate attitude stating someone was sitting there. We knew this, and there was about 3 feet worth of room for his one stool. Again, we couldn't even get into ours because they were so tightly grouped at the end, so we simply slid them over a bit so we could sit comfortably. Not in any way disturbing the other Patron's seat. He went about his attitude for some time, we left and the overall experience was poor."
Hayley D.,"Marshall, VA",69,1,,5.0,3/26/2017,I loved the environment and the food. Service very friendly. The pizacookies are drool worthy.
Renee H.,"Chicago, IL",273,320,1098,5.0,10/8/2014,"Great food & great service! BJ's staff has been so friendly for the few times I've been here! If I were to choose between BJs & Bar Louie, it'll be BJs from now on. They have a great selection of food & drinks & craft  beers.  FYI you start earning points with their rewards card AFTER you enroll."
Nick B.,"Manassas, VA",0,50,5,4.0,9/21/2016,Food: 5/5 Service: 3/5 Atmosphere: 5/5 Parking: 4/5 Cleanliness: 5/5 I have been here a few times and like this place. I have always had a good experience. The food is good. I have service a out of 5 because I had one mediocre service experience. The other times I service was pretty good. I like the atmosphere.  I like this place and will continue to come back.
Mona Y.,"Bristow, VA",0,9,1,1.0,2/12/2017,"If I could give this 0 stars I would for customer service.  Be warned do not use their app.  I used it, was charged twice, contacted the restaurant and was told by the management there is nothing that they can do.  Not an apology, not a lets see what happened, simply there is nothing we can do.  We were repeat locals and can tell you now that the amount of time we have exhausted in disputing the charges and humiliation in filling out forms that this company has no care for its guests.  I do not recommend."
