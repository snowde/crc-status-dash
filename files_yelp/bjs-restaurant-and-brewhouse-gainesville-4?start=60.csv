Larry G.,"Haymarket, VA",0,3,,2.0,8/10/2017,"Very disappointed in how much this place has gone down hill in a relatively short time.  The flat bread pizza was good, but the ""new"" prime rib sandwich was awful.  The sandwich was cold & the dipping juice was liquid sodium!"
Mary S.,"Culpeper, VA",44,100,21,5.0,3/9/2017,Food and ambience great. I love the desserts. Nice place to bring your family and friends. Will definitely go again.
Warren C.,"Bristow, VA",0,33,1,2.0,6/28/2016,"Finally decided to try again after a long hiatus.  I'd go 2 1/2 if I could.  Solidly, completely, middle of the road mediocre place.  We had wings, broccoli cheddar soup, a bacon cheeseburger and a cobb salad.  Nice size portions...the salad was huge with tons of toppings, but the dressing was tasteless.  Just didn't have any real definable flavor.  The burger was nothing to jump up and down about. Grafton Street's beats it by a mile.  Wings...meh.  The best thing was probably the broccoli cheddar soup in the bread bowl.  Tasty, and they toast the top of the bread bowl to make it like garlic bread, a nice touch.  Our waiter was very nice, he kept my iced tea filled without asking and was perfectly friendly and pleasant.   We went a little after noon on a Sunday...seems to me this place used to be packed on a Sunday afternoon.  Even when we were leaving, there were plenty of seats available.  Corporations can sometimes ruin kitchens, and I think that's what goes on here.    If this place stepped its food up just a bit, it'd be a destination for us.  But it's so mediocre, nothing says ""hey, let's go to BJ's!""  Although it fits perfectly in the vanilla, cookie cutter area it serves.  Oh well."
Jennifer D.,"Bristow, VA",17,102,29,2.0,6/24/2016,"So, we loveD this place but we got so sick of the slow service. It is sooo slow. The servers in the bar area are inattentive. It's just awful. Sitting at a table that is being waited on and feeling like you need to go to the bar to order more food and drinks is just insane. Sit at the bar or in the dining area or you won't get food or drinks in any kind of reasonable amount of time. Our server had us wait forever and then came back five minutes later to tell us she was sorry but she forgot a drink we ordered...Two stars for the food, less than zero stars for service."
Jon L.,"Manassas, VA",166,1603,1850,4.0,7/19/2014,"Exceeded my expectations on the first visit. I can't go four stars on a first review but it was a solid 4 star experience and I will certainly return for an encore. They have an impressive lineup of draught beers in addition to their own locally brewed craft beers. Interesting to learn they have won brewing awards going back to 1996, check out the photo. I stopped in for lunch and had their chicken tacos which were part of the 'lunch specials'. The menu said they came w/corn tortillas so I was a bit disappointed as I prefer flour. Emily was quick to point out that flour tortillas were an option...done. The two tacos came with a side of black beans and chips which put a nice finish on a light lunch along with a pint of Oasis Amber. The beer was just OK, not quite in the same league as the Revolution Amber Ale @ Heritage which they also have on tap. A nice menu selection; there appears to be something for everyone. They also have an outdoor patio."
Chery T.,"Chantilly, VA",0,23,14,3.0,2/26/2017,"Used to eat at BJ's everyday when out west, today ate at Gainsville location for 1st time, Food was as good as I remembered!  Ate at bar, the bartender Curtis, took forever to greet us, was not attentive, nor could he remember I don't take salt on my Margiritas on my 2nd drink. Won't return (at least to eat at the bar)."
Hap P.,"Gainesville, VA",11,8,,5.0,1/16/2017,Bj's is a great place for some good food.  We eat in and carry out and both are excellent with quick service.  It does get busy yet they seem to have sufficient staff to handle the flow of traffic.
Alexia D.,"Manassas, VA",0,1,1,1.0,2/15/2017,"Worst service I've ever had! We walked in on Valentine's Day a little before 9 p.m, with the understanding that the restaurant would be relatively busy. We only had a fifteen minute wait before being seated, which was nice. My fiancé and I sat down and salted our drink napkins, so that our drinks wouldn't stick to them when they arrived. Our waitress came and FLIPPED the napkins over, getting salt all over the table and some on my lap. She said, ""They were upside down, I hate seeing the logo on the napkins it drives me crazy. You can put the salt now."" Shocked and laughing awkwardly, we let it slide. When it was time to order, I ordered the baked ziti and my fiancé ordered a MEDIUM  steak with fries. The food took almost 45 minutes to get to us, and the facility wasn't even busy at this point. We were about to walk out, when our food finally came. My fiancé's steak was as rare as can be, throughout the whole cut. We requested to get a new one, with a new set of fries as well. When the steak came back, half the fries were MISSING and the waitress said she was going to get it for us. We went the whole meal, never getting the other portion of fries we paid for. I asked for a box and when the waitress brought it over, she didn't even stop at the table. She slightly just tossed it at our table on her way to assist someone else...."
Rhys D.,"Bristow, VA",0,30,2,4.0,6/20/2016,"Food is always good, black cherry and vanilla cream sodas are great. Service is always 'eh', aside from one time I've been there it was either slow to get a server, very slow to get refills or just overall bad attitude. Will always return for the pazookies and pizza, steaks never great however."
Ted M.,"Manassas, VA",81,48,456,2.0,3/15/2016,"Stopped here for lunch and our party of 3 was quickly seated.  The décor and atmosphere were very pleasing to the eye and I had high hopes.  Our server Janett was stellar!  She was efficient and checked on us at all the right times and always had refills in hand.  We started with buffalo boneless wings and it was a little odd that the sauce was not mixed with the wings, instead it was in a container on the side.  Our server realized we did not like that, so she quickly remedied the situation and took the wings back and had the kitchen toss them in the buffalo sauce (the menu does say the wings are tossed in your choice of flavors).  Next, I ordered the classic burger and it was cooked to my liking.  It was just so-so as it was a little too greasy for me and the poor bun didn't have a chance.  It comes with lettuce, tomato and pickles - but 8 pickles, really??  Instead of the fries (which looked great as they have steak and skinny ones) I opted for a side salad.  Unfortunately, this was the best part of my lunch.  It had a good assortment of fresh crisp greens. There are other restaurants in the area I would try over this one next time, however, I will be back at some point to give them another shot as the menu is extensive and sometimes the kitchen is just having a bad day."
Reggie R.,"Baltimore, MD",0,9,4,3.0,6/14/2016,Food is okay. Service is a bit slow. I will give it another shot possibly during happy hour.
Mike S.,"Alexandria, VA",83,109,106,3.0,6/2/2015,"Excellent customer service! We will be back!  Bottom Line Up Front: Great Service (ask for Melissa), delicious foods, lots of choices for your diets and homemade sodas too. I agree with the takeout photos that you get gipped on the veggies. Took an order home. So have them make it and then get a to go box. Bathrooms could be cleaner, hostess sat us at a dirty table and forgot silverware and management never stopped by to say hi or how's everything going on a non-busy Tuesday night. All in all we will go back and back! Customer service - 4 stars: Melissa rocked and we will request her. She's very attentive. Drinks were never empty and we felt like a great guest. The hostess knocked the rating down as she is the very first impression you get of BJs when walking in. Don't look glazed and be prepared with silverware and if the table is messy and brought to your attn, wipe it Quality - 4 stars: The taste was phenomenal. Good use of spices and presentation was excellent. The fried artichoke was not my favorite and the carnita fries didn't come out piping hot. Also if you get the ahi tuna salad I would request cherry tomatoes as the big tomatoes come out well cut big like an Italian restaurant salad. The pizza looked great and you will have leftovers if splitting a large Quantity - 3 stars. If you're dining in you get a lot of food but do not order take out. I agree with other yelpers that it was small. I ordered a to-go Parmesan crusted chicken plate as it looked delish in photos and still looked great when I took the shot. Work on this BJs. Value - 4 stars. I'd normally give 3 stars here as the majority is par with Bar Louie and other upscale applebee restaurants but I like the small menu item prices and the trio dessert and see beaucoup value there so that upped you a star Ambience - 3 1/2 stars. Had the bathrooms been clean I would've went up to 4 stars but the atmosphere outside the bathroom on a Tuesday was great. Not too noisy and still filled with smiling faces. I wouldn't take the fam or first date here on a weekend as it has the potential to be super crowded. Had no issue getting seated and the lighting was perfect temperature as well, no hoodies needed."
Jannie C.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,23,20,1.0,6/30/2017,"No. This place went down the tubes fast. The service isn't great, and the deep dish pizza is very doughy."
Ash D.,"Woodbridge, VA",0,9,19,2.0,8/3/2015,"I went on a Saturday night with my sister and boyfriend. The service was fine, nothing too spectacular or awful. It's just the food that's never up to par. We ordered the carnita fries with chile verde as an appetizer which were pretty tasty! We all really enjoyed them. I ordered the California chicken club which was good but my fries were over cooked, ugh! My boyfriend ordered the fish n chips U G H why send out over cooked food? It was almost burnt so it tastes pretty awful and his fries, seeing as we all probably shared a batch, were over cooked. My sister got the Black and Bleu house burger, she's a little hard to please but still! This burger is suppose to have crumbles of blue cheese but it was more like a dressing dumped on top! She said none of it connected and really didn't enjoy it.  The dessert is why we came! Salted caramel pizookie! Usually pretty great but this one came out hard as a rock!! When we told our server we could see her and, who I presume, was the manager breaking into it to see if what? We were lying? I don't know but the replacement was fine...only fine because the first one should've been great! Also, if you feel the need to dig into something someone sends back, do it privately! I'm not coming back for entrees but maybe for dessert if I'm jonesing for a pizookie!"
Lindy D.,"Gainesville, VA",21,35,,4.0,1/22/2017,Still love this place but for some reason the time it takes to have someone take your order or bring your food has become pretty slow. And other then the flustered (and what I can only assume high waitress) the servers are great and friendly.
Allison N.,"Haymarket, VA",3,11,7,1.0,10/1/2016,"My sister found a SCREW NUT that looked like an olive on her Mediterranean pizza and our waiter had the audacity to insinuate that we planted it there as some kind of scheme. The manager half heartedly apologized and handed us an incident report, but didn't do anything further. Really? Is this the type of service you're proud to provide?"
Ataya P.,"Germantown, MD",183,164,229,4.0,3/8/2015,"Visiting friends in the area, we came here for lunch at their recommendation.  My first question was ""Is this restaurant part of the BJ's Wholesale Club right next to it?"" My friends laughed at me, but I was totally serious lol! Turns out the answer is no. (Duhh, right?)  Wow! This place is definitely pleasing to the eye.  Lots of space. Comfortable lighting. Quick seating.  The impressive bar.  Big screen TVs... everywhere!!   The menu was overwhelming!  Everything looked great!  Had we not spent the entire weekend partying, I just may have gotten an adult beverage, but it was a better idea that I just sipped water.  I recommend the Crispy Fried Artichokes and the Crispy Calamari while you wait. Next time I go back, I want to try Chicken Wings and the Corn Fritters with Bacon Aioli. Oh!  And the Stuffed Spinach Mushrooms! Now, I haven't had a burger in months... I'm usually the one to hunt out a chicken sandwich or turkey burger, never with fries... but for whatever reason, BJ's made me want one!  And now!  Seriously!  So, I ordered the BJs Brewhouse Burger with Applewood Smoked Bacon and Cheese... and fries! Omg! I ate half of this thing before I even remembered to take a photo! Yes, my friends, it was that good. I will say, the waiter was kind of awkward.  Usually I can get servers to loosen up a bit, but this guy was tough as nails! Good news is, he got our orders right. Not so much the checks at the end of the meal, but the food was right... and that's all that matters,  I think.   I recently found out that there's one not too far, right here in MD.  Where the heck have I been?!  Needless to say, I will be returning to BJ's... whether it's VA or MD, I'll be back!"
Kevin R.,"Fairfax, VA",8,15,4,4.0,11/3/2016,This is a nice restaurant.  Not super special but the beer is good and the food is nice too.  We got fried avocado rolls or something for an app and they were fantastic.  And they can mix two beers together to make a really fantastic tasting product which we had several pitchers of.
Hama S.,"Fairfax, VA",0,9,,1.0,9/24/2016,"Two star overall. Very Nice waitress, terrible food and extremely overpriced for the terrible quality. Deep dish pizza was nubz. Jambalaya, everyone's apparent favorite, was nubz. Rib eye was not seasoned. Chicken parm was terrible."
Jon F.,"Hartlepool, United Kingdom",0,18,,2.0,1/17/2017,"Wonderful food. Served hot, good portions & not a bad value for the price. Service = CRAP. ... asked for a table, 7-8 visibly empty and bused, ready to use.... But none of the wait staff was on rotation to serve those tables or they were out of their sections.... what ever it was it was a longggggg wait to be seated... at a table that was not bused (They did wipe it down after seating us) ....Then the wait.  After 15 minutes a waitress from another section asked if we were helped yet as she noted there was no flatware on the table. Waiting... done with menu choices... waiting, got a server that took drink and menu items order and we asked for NO ONIONS. Food arrives like a drive by shooting....does not notice lack of forks and such.   Nothing but our hands to eat with.  ...Flag down another wait staffer to get us utensils...  Onions in the salad & on the main course. Will not be back.      Oh, and its another one of those restaurants that can't afford any acoustic baffling or ceiling. Loud as hell!"
