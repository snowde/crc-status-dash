Kim B.,"Gainesville, VA",34,192,110,2.0,1/19/2016,"I've been to a few other BJ's around the country, and this one is the same concept.  Unfortunately, this one has horrendous service, and the food is forgettable.   I've been to this location twice now, for lunch.  Once with a friend and her daughter and most recently with my husband.    My go-to at BJ's for lunch is the unlimited soup and salad.  The nice thing about their lunch deal, is that you can mix and match soup and salad and change up your choices on a refill, so if you want to taste the tomato soup, but decide to switch to chicken tortilla, all is okay in the world.    On my lunch date with my friend a few months ago, I ordered my soup and salad, with a wedge salad no onions.  The server responded that he was sure the salad didn't come with onions.  I disagreed and responded to him, that either way, I'd like it with no onions, so if it doesn't come with it, great...if it does, please make sure they're not there.   He smiled.   When the food runner brought out my salad, it was loaded with onions.   The server never came back until the end of the meal- no refills or switches to soup or salad for me.  I politely showed him my plate of onions that I picked off my salad and he said ""oh, I'm sorry"".   On Friday, on my lunch date with the husband, the server asked me if I would like my soup or salad first, and I was cold, so responded that I'd like my soup first.   20 minutes goes by, and a food runner brings out my husbands pizza (which he said was just okay...) and my wedge salad.   I asked about the soup that I was supposed to get first, and they were shocked that I never received it.   The runner went back and got me a soup.   I cut my wedge with no onions  (which btw is my favorite salad) and realized that it was teeny.  It seriously had like 4 pieces of lettuce in the wedge.   But, since it's unlimited, I just ordered another when I was ready.   Unfortunately, it took forever to to get the second salad, which was properly sized, and the second cup of soup never arrived, either.   Then both the server and a runner brought my soup, so now there were two on the table.   My husband had a few bites and said it was okay... Here' the thing.  Soup and salad.   How easy is that?  That should absolutely be the quickest thing out of the kitchen, right?!?!   So, it shouldn't be the thing that takes the longest to come out.    All in all, the service leaves something to be desired here, and I'm sure I can find another place to indulge in my soup and salad cravings that puts a smile on my face."
T B.,"Bristow, VA",0,15,,2.0,6/21/2017,Food is very basic but service is always exceptional! The pizookie dessert is the only reason to eat here.
Philip S.,"Fairfax, VA",88,71,10,3.0,8/22/2016,"Decent food and staff, overly large overwhelming menu. We had the beef dip sandwich, which was well cooked, soft fresh bread, but the inside was cold and the au-jus was strangely gluey. The panino flatbread was nice and flaky. We're not big beer folks so we tried the in-house brewed specialty sodas, black cherry & cream soda, they're flavorful but overly sweet, almost cloying. Good atmosphere, but good luck with the parking & seating situation there at the promenade. ;)"
Ken B.,"Fairfax, VA",488,16,19,5.0,1/10/2017,"My family and I have been going to BJ's for about a year and we could not be happier with the service and the food. Today I had a tremendous salad called a Santa Fe. I got it with blackened chicken with balsamic dressing on the side, Oh so good!! I read many of the reviews here on yelp and I'm shocked that so many people complained about the service. We've had many different servers and we have never had any complaints."
Mark P.,"Gainesville, VA",0,14,5,5.0,12/7/2016,Great place.  Wait time gets really bad on fridays and weekend evenings.  Everyone knows they have great food and tons of options no matter what your looking to eat/drink.  Very nice environment.  Just wish lines weren't as long on weekends.
Andrea F.,"Brentwood, TN",3,15,21,5.0,10/10/2016,"I love the pizza!  They definitely have a something for everyone kind of menu.  The service was only so-so when the restaurant first opened, but now it's always excellent.  The loyalty program is also pretty good."
Sally Z.,"Gainesville, VA",62,60,127,1.0,3/2/2015,"Food tastes like it came straight from a box Not great frozen dinner, either. Pretty bad. Service wasn't great either  He had a fried jalapeño cheeseburger Greasy as hell Glistening Greasy. I had a salad with fried chicken   Chicken strips was more like it and Cold. I like my chicken hot.  Jeff wasn't out waiter but he did recommend the stuffed mushrooms. They were tasty. Best thing we had there.    They need a chef"
Allison O.,"Aldie, VA",14,28,23,4.0,3/8/2016,"This place has LOTS of options for food and drinks! My husband and I found this place and decided to give it a try. The beer menu alone is enough to make your head spin! We took about 5 min to try and decide what we wanted to drink. I was REALLY amazed that they had a seasonal pumpkin beer on tap - and a pint was only $3!!! The bar tender said they are still trying to get rid of it from the fall! Are you kidding me?! Who doesn't love a good pumpkin beer??? I had 2 that night! :) For dinner I had the Seared Ahi Salad. It was pretty tasty. I wish they would have given me a few more slices of tuna, but the rice wine vinaigrette was on point and I love the pickled cucumber in the salad. For $15.75, I guess that price wasn't too bad. The bowl of salad is rather large and I only ate about half the greens and definitely finished all my ahi tuna! I would want to try a different dish next time as the menu is HUGE! My husband had the full rack of ribs that came with 2 sides for $22.95. He got the clam chowder soup and thin cut fries. They brought out the soup first is a BIG bowl and once he ate that, he was full! The full rack of ribs was no joke! It was the whole plate and then some! I sampled a small bite and the sauce was delish! He said the ribs were very good and even took half of the rack home for leftovers. Our bartender, Julia, was very nice and friendly. I did use the bathroom which I found to be really clean and the air freshener smelled awesome! We went on a Monday night after 7pm so the place was very quiet.  We will definitely be going back in the future! The only con I can see is that the menu is rather large and you will need several minutes to digest all the food and drink choices. The prices are a bit high, but the portions seem to make up for that (this is where the 4 stars comes into play - if the prices were a bit cheaper, I could give 5 stars). Overall, great experience! Cheers!"
Jennifer S.,"Manassas, VA",28,44,,4.0,12/7/2016,I have been here a few times and I have always had pretty good service. The prices are a little high but not too bad. Most of the time the food has been pretty good. I like the atmosphere of the place. I would recommend giving them.a try.
Anh-Thu N.,"Manassas, VA",11,52,310,5.0,2/17/2016,"The five stars are for the service we received from Valerie!  She provided us with the best service, she comes by by often enough to check on us. She doesn't leave our glasses empty or empty plates on the table. She deserves all the tip. In regards to the food, we had half order of the bulgogi nachos, steak and cheese sub, kids order of chicken quesadilla, and a bowl of tomatoe bisque. Everything tasted great and well seasoned."
Mark T.,"Bristow, VA",1,5,3,5.0,2/28/2016,"Al was an excellent server, attentive, and engaging, he made the experience a great one!  We find BJs to be a consistent experience but Friday's visit was exceptional. Even if you don't like Brussels Sprouts, you must try the Honey Saracha Brussels Sprout, seasoned and flash fried crispy - delicious. And their seasonal Chocolate Ale - superb!"
Tom T.,"Centreville, VA",0,14,,3.0,10/24/2016,"This place is ok, just as long as you don't set your expectations too high you won't be disappointed.  Their deep dish pizzas are good.  Go for mediterranean or their version of a supreme, both are good."
David W.,"Gainesville, VA",3,26,,1.0,12/14/2016,"You would think by now that management would have this restaurant humming. Ate their last night with my wife and on a weekday night with the restaurant only half full, I had to flag done a waitress after 15 minutes of just sitting there and watching all the waiters/waitresses walk by our table without even acknowledging our presence. Upon flagging a waitress down and asking if she was working our table, her response was, ""I guess so."" My wife and I ordered salads and then waited just under 45 minutes before we were served. During that 45 minute wait, our waitress was no where to be found. Our complaints fell on deaf ears as far as management was concerned. Just a lot of, ""yes sirs,"" with no sincerity. So long BJ's. It's back to the GAR restaurant chain where customer service is a priority."
Karen J.,"Gainesville, VA",0,7,,5.0,4/21/2017,"Food was great, prime rib special and the  service was even better. Our Server was friendly and offered suggestion for our first visit. The menu has something for everyone. On a busy Friday night, we only waited 20 minutes."
Vy Nguyen T.,"Bristow, VA",7,53,34,3.0,8/6/2016,"Its a convience place next to everything to hang out with kid and family. But the seat can get dirty and hostess can be rude. The waitress I had today was good, Jessie, other seem a little bit on the edge. The dish I got was ziti deep , which suppose to have a lot of cheese but no, it was dried.."
T B.,"Amissville, VA",0,14,6,2.0,3/10/2016,"Ribs were great. Pizza had too much oregano. The service is probably the worst I have experienced in this area.  Too bad, it is a cool restaurant with inexperienced workers."
Terra P.,"Gainesville, VA",54,10,,5.0,10/13/2016,"Love this place. Was very nice inside and out, and service was great! Would totally go back again and again."
Jaeda M.,"Woodbridge, VA",8,20,19,4.0,2/1/2015,"I came here for the first time today..  in a nutshell the food was good, service was challenged, but I'd come back. I had the Cider which was yummy and sweet, my date had German beer. I ordered clam chowder, it was good. Then we had the calamari, that was ok, but I wasn't a fan of the marinara sauce paired with it. We ordered a ""deep dish fries with cheese and pork"", meal that I can't remember the name of, which was delish (we had them remove the green chilies and onion). Then we had the large deep dish pepperoni extreme pizza which I liked also. I've only been to Chicago once (which I did get Chicago pizza) so I can't say this is ""legit"" but it was yummy.  Apparently the computer system messed up and caused our server to ""fall behind"" which equated to no drinks, no hot sauce we had asked for, and then a list of extras we needed which grew quickly cause he was unseen. Once I made sure he knew I wasn't excited about my food getting cold while I waited for the stuff that I asked for it was quickly fixed (he brought the manager in to help) they made me fresh fries (they sat too long while I waited for catsup). Overall the food was good and the restaurant was nice, and like I said, I'd go back."
Christy W.,"Vienna, VA",52,4,,4.0,4/8/2016,"We end up going here a lot, and we do like it a LOT.  The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is because when the food is cooked right, it is amazing, but it's a toss-up on if it will be cooked right during that visit or not...my guess is that the kitchen staff is new and still working out the kinks with their people.  I hope they get it figured out soon. Food: the dishes are all delicious, I haven't had one yet that I didn't like...except when I went back for it the second time and it was not cooked well.  Some examples are fries that are soaked in grease (the grease was not hot when they cooked the food) or pizzas that are overly toasted on top (burnt veggies) or barely cooked dough. However, I love the atmosphere, both the bar and the main restaurant. It's nice, yet you can feel right at home in shorts.  The beer selection is huge, including their own brews (not made on-site).   BJ's is well known for their pizzas (fresh, thick, think Uno's) and pizzookies (cookie cooked in a small pizza pot with delicious toppings and ice cream).  Also, Monday's are half-off pizzas (!), so we often get a pizza and pizzookies (might be spelling this wrong)."
Chris B.,"Aurora, CO",47,6,10,1.0,11/7/2015,Terrible service! Long waits. Lousy food. They told us it would be 30 min when we arrived but ended waiting  over an hour. This place totally sucks!
