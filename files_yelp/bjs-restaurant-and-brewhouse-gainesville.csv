Diana E.,"Pompano Beach, FL",651,268,275,5.0,1/8/2018,"This is my third visit to this restaurant in the Gainesville area, I usually go to the one down in Coral Springs.  I love this location as much as I do my regular one. The beer is always nice and cold, apps and food on point and this time I had Ivana as a waitress who was wonderful. I even ended up getting a free Pozooki with my BJ loyalty points AND buying two movie tickets at a discount price ask your server for details. Score!  I will definitely come back to this location."
Cierra G.,"Fayetteville, NC",196,119,191,3.0,11/29/2017,"I don't have much of a review for this BJ's location.  I've visited only one other BJ's location, in Tallahassee, FL, and I loved it, but I also went there to celebrate and have drinks.   On this particular visit, in Gainesville, FL, on a super long road trip back to NC, my husband and stopped here because we were hungry and tired.  We happened to come during lunch time, but it was early lunch, 11 am maybe, so the lunch crowd wasn't quite out and about yet. The hostess greeted us as soon as we entered the establishment and we were seated right away.  Our server came soon after and told us about the lunch specials.  She brought our drinks, took our orders and went on here way. The food was good, especially because we got a great lunch deal, however, it seems that she forgot to charge us for the special, she charged us regular price, but was quick to fix it after paying attention to our receipt. There was nothing special about this visit, just ok."
Robert R.,"Gainesville, FL",55,55,85,3.0,10/1/2017,"I have eaten at BJ's many time. But, it's exceptionally average. I enjoy the atmosphere and all the sports. It can be a bit loud sometimes.  I tend to enjoy the food but I have had some disappointments as well. The chicken tends to come over cooked and isn't great to begin with. But the fish tends to be good and not over cooked. The deserts are good. Some of their mixed drink are really good. I enjoy a drink like that. It's pricey but delicious.  Overall, I don't turn down an invite to go here."
Pam S.,"Blountstown, FL",1,3,2,2.0,9/30/2017,"This was our 1st time at BJ'S ever at Gainesville...thought we'd give it a try. Kinda wish we'd never gone there. We went there after a game about 3:30 pm & wanted to grab something to eat before traveling back home for 2.5 hours. We were seated immediately, which was great. However, we waited 10-15 minutes before we finally HAD TO ASK for our waiter/waitress. She came within a few minutes & was friendly enough. It was another 10 minutes or so before we got the drinks. I had a vanilla cream soda float & that was very good. We ordered the stuffed spinach mushrooms with garlic pesto aoili sauce as an appetizer. When we saw them, we were disappointed at the size of them...of course, we didn't know what to expect being new. There were only 6 of them but other restaurants at least give medium to large sized mushrooms. They tasted very good. We had to flag down our waitress AGAIN to order our entrées (deep dish pizza)...THAT took another 10 minutes to locate her. She was flittering all around us, when we actually got a glimpse of her, but she was NEVER attentive to us. We ALWAYS had to ask other waiters/waitresses for what we needed. When she brought some refills on our drinks, she said that she'd bring us some parmesan for our pizza. Did she ever bring it?? NO! So, we flagged down yet someone else. She never even commented or asked (or apologized) for not bringing it. We had already eaten 4 pieces of pizza before we got some. When we were finally ready for the check & a to-go box, my husband finally got up & went to the little area where the waiters/waitresses were to ask for the check & a box. Seconds after the box was brought, she happened to bring the check & she saw that someone had already brought a box. We will NOT be going back to the Gainesville BJ'S again...and we are there often during football season. Maybe in another town.... maybe. The vast menu was somewhat overwhelming to go through & pick just 1 thing (besides an appetizer). It would be better to have maybe 4-5 pages, front & back....not 20. To end on a somewhat high note...we loved the ambience & warehouse feel of the place."
Nan T.,"Gainesville, FL",16,315,2430,4.0,7/4/2017,"After a five year absence, I swore I would never return. But I did. (I was strong-armed.) And was I ever surprised! To our benefit, it was a late dinner & there were few patrons on site. Kudos to waiter Erich K; management should clone him after having him train the entire staff on how to serve professionally & w/ 100% accuracy. Kudos also to the chef for the Avocado Egg Rolls appetizer (see pic), which was one of THE best avocado appetizers we've ever eaten; the crispy golden brown wrapper, fresh abundant avocado, red onion, & soy-based dipping sauce were amazing. (Thanks for the recommendation, Erich!) The flavorful, slightly spicy Double Bone-In Pork Chop dinner (see pic) w/ crisp garlic green beans & cheddar mashed potatoes was both huge & superb! (It was another great recommendation.) The Tomato Bisque soup was very good, as was the Golden Beet Arugula salad. Lots of tasty food, decent prices, phenomenal service, & a pleasant decor. Kudos all around! But, unfortunately, there was one downer-- a 20-page menu (23 if you include specials) that is so extensive I lost interest after the turning of the first five. (Robert Irvine would poo poo that sucker:) Within such a vast & varied menu SHOULD at least be a page labeled, ""The Best of the Best that We Offer"" or something that sounds more creative while catching the attention of customers like I who found the monstrous menu most annoying. (FYI: According to our server, the menu will soon grow by 7 new items-- at least two of those items will be new chicken wing flavors.)  Thank you, BJ's, for redeeming yourself! And thank you Erich K. for being great at your job:)"
Kristyn W.,"Gainesville, FL",271,59,89,3.0,1/24/2017,"Bj's Restaurant is mediocre for its entrees and selection - the only reason I go here is for their chocolate chip pizookie to be quite honest! The ambiance on the inside of the restaurant is quite nice, giving you an upper class type feel however the menu just does not cut it for me. I struggled to find something to order because nothing caught my eye. This was my second time coming to Bj's and I've noticed that they changed the menu. I used to order the cajun chicken pasta, but now that's not available anymore. I was a little stumped because the one dish I liked was now gone!! This time, I ordered the parmesan crusted chicken as my entree which came with roasted broccoli and mashed potatoes, but I mistakenly swapped the mashed potatoes out for a broccoli cheddar soup (HUGE mistake)! The soup was extremely cheesy, so I did not finish it. I was told by a friend after my experience that the mashed potatoes are to die for, so if you are going to choose this dish, then I guess stick with the mashed potatoes. We also ordered a couple appetizers - avocado egg rolls, calamari, artichoke dip and a California chicken flatbread. All of these items were pretty good, but nothing special or different than what you can find at a TGIF or Chili's. The ONLY reason I would be willing to go to BJ's would be for their chocolate chip pizookie!! It is basically a cookie that is baked in a deep dish (like a pizza) and has a couple scoops of vanilla piled on top. The cookie is warm and with the ice cream, you achieve that melt in your mouth chocolatey goodness!!! Plus, if it's your birthday, you receive a free mini pizookie with a candle lit in it! Like I said, not my favorite restaurant to come to because it's really average however the pizookie's are amazing!"
Kim R.,"Gainesville, FL",213,209,444,2.0,12/4/2016,"The restaurant has a nice high-end vibe to it and a good atmosphere for socializing and good interactions. The food left much to be desired. As a matter of fact it was costly below average appetizers (sampler). I got home with my leftovers to share with my husband to show him what he missed out on. I opened my goody box and he said, with a straight face, ""What's that?"" It was avocado rolls and boneless chicken wings and if I return to BJ's, I will not order it again."
Jen S.,"Streetman, TX",2,55,14,2.0,11/7/2017,Ok I am picky. Came to eat for lunch. Did the bar thinking it would be faster and waited by my table for three mins. Then finally a busboy came to clean the table. Almost walked out. The tomato sauce from the previous guest was smashed into the cleaning rag and the chunks came flying toward my tan shade shoes and the tomatos left streaks on the table . He didn't notice it wasn't clean and left chunks on the seat with the smear on the table.  We have the best waitress running full tilt however when the hostess finally arrived with menus she did not send someone to clean again. So my clean silver is resting on the paper napkins. Don't go here unless u don't care about cleanliness. I did ask the hostess to tell the manager but here I sit. I am ordering the prime rib! Holding my breath !
Scott R.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",170,191,1154,2.0,5/17/2017,"Fellow Yelpers, 1.5 stars  BJ's restaurant in itself tries extremely hard to be something it's not. It's begging to be the Cheesecake Factory. It wants to have a little bit of everything. I even think it's to the point where corporate office needs to take a look at the menu and ask themselves what type of restaurant are we?  Nothing on this extensive menu in my opinion is worth ordering to me  pages and pages on items that are all underwhelming. The kitchen staff must have it absolutely insane in there. The menu has 22 chapters. With all area of pizzas. Ordered the flat bread pizza (it was horrible) flat bread was more flat and harder then a saltine cracker. Ok so now we know I clearly am not a fan of the food nor their menu.  The service is hit or miss. Orders are all taken on a mobile device so they are staring at a screen the entire time while placing your order. I can see the menu is too large to remember everything so that's why they must use them.  BJ's brewery?  I never visibly seen anything that shows they are a brewery. No tanks or anything I show the process of making beer. No creativity   Bj's actually has a large space and nice interior and even has potential with a lot of changes  I will not be a customer nor do I recommend this place to anyone."
Crag F.,"Charlotte, NC",0,7,,5.0,10/23/2017,"Been here twice. And I'll be here a lot more. Menu is huge, not sure how they do it. Pizza, great - both flatbread and deep dish. Steaks, killer. Homemade guacamole, also great. Fish and chips, like from the coast. Seriously, not sure how they do so much so well. And their beers? What? Huge selection, all brewed in state, not far. I live in Charlotte, NC, and visit here to Gainesville often, so I'm not a local. There may be better places, but I doubt there's a lot."
Lee L.,"Ocala, FL",19,113,240,4.0,6/8/2017,"My latest trip was about a month ago, during a weekday lunch.  We were a party of five total. The restaurant was not busy at all.  Our server came over and took our drink order and then our server disappeared and while she tended to other tables, she never acknowledged ours. I finally got up and approached the server and politely asked her to come take our order.  The food came out and it was good, as BJ's food usually is.  Even when it came time for asking a simple question to the server, she left and returned 10 minutes later with no answer.  We finally asked for the check and about an hour and a half later, we were finally leaving the restaurant.  My issue was with the amount of time we spent in the restaurant during a weekday lunch, when people need to get back to work, for example.  Those people would be late. There is no way anyone who works would think this is acceptable for a chain restaurant. I know you can do better than this during lunch time."
Brian C.,"Morriston, FL",0,8,,5.0,8/1/2017,"Excellent!!!!   Went there today aug 1st 2017,  waitress was Karen,  she was fantastic A++,  food was terrific just yummy and served great,  love the sweet potatoe  Fries,  I got the steak it was fantastic,  the fresh made cream soda like drinking food of the gods,  I love BJ's. Will always come here when I shop at the mall.  Highly recommend it,  prices are great staff is excellent, atmosphere is perfect.  I'm looking for reasons to come to Gainesville more often.  Just so I can eat at BJ's,  the desert cookie out of this world fantastic!!!!!!"
Shelly S.,"Gainesville, FL",45,1,1,5.0,5/19/2017,"Atmosphere is great! Love the look and feel of the restaurant. The menu is 20 pages, if you can't find something here, that's on you. The food presentation was beautiful and the quality was amazing! Our server, Karen was a delight. They deserve this 5-star review."
Shelley H.,"Alachua, FL",224,219,310,3.0,1/8/2017,"This restaurant is huge! If you're out for an intimate meal, go somewhere else. This warehouse style restaurant is all but that. Don't get me wrong, it's clean, but probably better for a casual gathering than date night. Look to spend around $15 per person for an entree.  They have a large selection of own-brews and their menus is quite extensive, from apps to pizza, pasta, salads, burgers, sandwiches, soups, bar food, and more. I had a severe cold and couldn't taste much, but the chicken tortilla soup still danced off my taste buds, which is saying a lot."
Tobias K.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,4,1,3.0,8/7/2017,Atmosphere is amazing ! I always like to go in here for the appetizers but never order any of their pasta dishes . Shit taste like it comes out of a can . Still with appetizers and drink and your good
Daniela R.,"Miami, FL",0,1,,1.0,9/30/2017,"I LOVE Bj's and I have never been so disappointed. I ordered my food through Bitesquad and the food I got was a letdown. I paid a good amount of money for the food and what I get are the smallest 2 pieces of lettuce and 2 miniature pieces of chicken, it was more of peppers and sauce then Chicken for my CHICKEN lettuce wrap which I have ordered many times previously and I get a lot more then that. I also ordered the mini Pizookie and while I was eating it there was PLASTIC in the Pizookie. I have honestly never written a bad review but I am MORE then pissed."
Rick P.,"Gainesville, FL",0,2,,1.0,10/1/2017,"I have lived in Gainesville for 2 1/2 years and tonight I had the worst meal I have ever had in Gainesville! When the Grilled Chicken Alfredo was delivered to the table I found it so dry that I literally had to pull to separate the fettucini. I was able to find 2 pieces of chicken approx. 2 inches long and 1/4 inch thick. On the plate were 5 pieces of broccoli which were cool and uncooked! I am sooo disappointed! My wife had Spicy Peanut Chicken with noodles which she said was flavorful with an adequate amount of sauce, but once again had only 5 small pieces of chicken 1 inch cubes. Both meals could not have had 1/2 small chicken beast combined.  The last time we dined at BJ's was about a year ago and the food was great and plentiful! What happened? I should have checked their rating before tonight."
Donna J.,"Grand Junction, CO",0,12,,5.0,6/9/2017,Love this place!  New peach martini is light and refreshing- a new favorite.  Had the watermelon feta salad-  Really Good!  As always the Margherita flatbread pizza never disappoints!
Slate C.,"St. Augustine, FL",33,89,122,4.0,3/20/2017,Great pizza . Actually most of the food is really good. And if you download their app you get a free mini pizzookie!!! Which are amazing. They have plenty of seating. It's a great place for the whole family.
Mattias Z.,"Ocala, FL",1,42,,2.0,4/16/2017,"Horrid.  Inconsistent food. Long waits for a disappointment.  I was recently at BJ's with a couple of other critics and we decided to all order the same thing to check consistency.   We all ordered the BBQ Bison Burger with the ""Gourmet"" Mac n Cheese .  The mac n cheese....noodles were rubbery and the cheese was congealed which means was in the oven too long,  as for the burgers, we had a trio of sizes, small, medium and large but skinny.  My bun was crisped to the point of biting harder than normal, one of my friends buns seemed to dissolve away the more he bit into it and the last one was soup.  Inattentive wait staff and uncaring at our polite dismays.  NEXT!"
Richard D.,"Gainesville, FL",8,38,43,2.0,4/4/2016,We dine here very often. The half price appetizer special is very good. The food is generally good. The service is iffy however.  We dined Easter Sunday night. It was relatively quiet there which is unusual. The service was poor at best. We got a pazookie with ice cream as an entree and there was no spoon. Didn't get that until it was nearly finished by eating it with a fork.  Then the grilled sandwich we ordered had soggy cold bread on one side. The other 2 items were hot and fresh. They were obviously made last. The general manager apologized and took half the sandwich off. Anywhere else I've eaten they would comp the entire item.
Caroline J.,"Jacksonville, FL",260,232,74,3.0,11/23/2015,"The good: drinks! Whether you want alcohol or sodas, you can get some amazing concoctions. BJs brews their own sodas and beer in-house! The atmosphere is also pretty fun and welcoming. The ""eh"": The food! I've had some pretty good options here (like a flatbread) and some ""Meh"" options (The portobello sandwich). The food wasn't BAD, it just didn't blow me out of the water. Keep in mind that I'm a vegetarian so there are only 3-4 options for me to choose from.  The ugly: The prices! Goodness, a small alcoholic beverage can run you 12-13 bucks. The entrees are also around $12-30 for what I honestly could probably get at Ruby Tuesday's.  This place is nice to sit at the bar and enjoy an appetizer. It has a friendly atmosphere. Watch your wallet."
Jim W.,"High Springs, FL",118,91,231,3.0,12/27/2014,"We happened into BJ's on Christmas Eve.    The place was about half full.  We were warmly greeted by a hostess and seated promptly.  Our waitress was quick, timely, and didn't forget anything.  She was also very personable. The menu at this place is massive.  Pages and pages of selections.  It goes against every bit of the theory ""stick to what you're good at"".  It's obvious that most of the entrees and sides are frozen then steamed or nuked.  No kitchen can keep that much fresh food on hand.  It shows in the taste and presentation of most of the dinner items.  They do a pretty good job of steam and nuking though. The beers are pretty good and it's fun to try the different creations that they have.  Domestics are available if you have an aversion to microbrews. The best part of BJs menu are the lighter side entrees.   This is one of the few restaurants I can go to and order something that doesn't have a full days worth of calories, salt, and cholesterol in a single meal.  Some entrees are less than 600 calories.  Very nice.  I know some fast food salads that have over 1200! This isn't my first time at this restaurant.  My previous experiences have been the same.  It's middle of the road and solid.   What more can you expect from a chain I guess?  Good luck and thanks for reading my review."
Loren O.,"Manhattan, NY",4,55,17,2.0,7/5/2016,"We came in for lunch and it took an hour and a half before we could escape. The server kept forgetting us. We never got refills on drinks despite finishing them in about ten minutes into our meals (both our meals were super salty.) We even asked our server for more drinks and after 30 minutes he brought ONE water out for a table with two people. It wasn't a busy day. There weren't a lot of people there, but every single step of the meal took ages. We were seated pretty quickly, but it probably took 15-20 minutes for our server to take our order. Our food took at least 30 minutes to come out, and it was another 40 minutes or so before we were able to get a check.  My mom got a burger and the fries were cold by the time it came to the table. Her burger itself was also weird. The lettuce tasted slimy. It was just your normal burger, nothing fancy, but she didn't even eat half of it. I got the fetticine alfredo with grilled chicken and it was super heavy and really greasy. I maybe ate half. We were supposed to get a free pazookie with my reward points, but we told our server not to bother since after our meals we really didn't want to eat anything else. I won't come here again."
Cathy J.,"Hollywood, FL",76,21,7,4.0,7/10/2016,"There's a BJs just down the street from our house but we travelled over 300 miles to finally try it while visiting Gainesville. We started with the honey sriracha Brussels sprouts... amazing! So crunchy yum.  Had to try the deep dish pizza so we got a small to eat as an appetizer. The crust had a good flavor but I would have liked it to be chewier and not so light. The fresh tomatoes on top were a good alternative to sauce. Get the Parmesan Crusted Chicken...it was true to its name, it was crusted and not a soft Parmesan covering. North Beach  Mahi and Shrimp was good but the broth was a little watery. Our son got a chicken sandwich and fries. Well he liked it and ate it... couldn't get much out of him for a reviewkids All in all we enjoyed it and will return to try more. Wish we had room for dessert it looked great!"
Penny T.,"Gainesville, FL",83,6,5,3.0,1/20/2016,"Have been here a few times for lunch with co-workers, dinner with hubby and larger family meals. Everything the atmosphere is open. Sometimes between the music and other groups, it can get difficult to talk with your party. We have had great service. Very pleasant, cordial, and timely with our orders and drinks. The restaurant seemed clean and picked up. Nice variety of foods to choose from along with a big selection of beers. My favorite menu item is the chicken parmigiana-- AWESOME! Various types of people in attendance, business, families, singles/doubles. Outside seating is available but I have never done so."
Janet D.,"Alachua, FL",8,1,,1.0,4/4/2017,"Do NOT order chili for delivery, very small amount maybe 1 cup worth of food. For $6.95 plus tax NOT a good deal. Also NOT helpful when I called to complain."
Jonathan T.,"Gainesville, FL",3,8,,3.0,8/27/2016,"They try to hard...... The good: burgers/sliders, Beer, dumplings, tuna (although low quality frozen its done well FYI: frozen fish isn't necessarily a bad thing) the structure is fine although its a typical chain restaurant. Parking is ok. The staff is friendly and attentive. The bad: Most sauces are mayo based, the ""aoli"" and ""creama"" are not real just mayo with additives. The Deep Dish Pizza is absolutely disgusting, the wrong dough, the wrong sauce, no where near enough sauce, cheese and toppings. The pizza they make is simply puffy dough with pizza stuff......its terrible, its offensive to every legitimate pizza maker on the planet."
Anh S.,"Gainesville, FL",0,1,2,1.0,2/28/2017,I ordered BJs through a delivery service and the Beignet that I ordered came to my house completely uncooked and cold. It was still all dough-like and not editable at all. This experience is horrible and now I am experiencing extreme abdominal pain from consuming raw dough.
Theda B.,"Gainesville, FL",5,3,,1.0,11/11/2016,"The service was very slow...we were there from 12:49-2:00 for lunch.  I tried their new lentil soup.  It tasted okay, but it made me very sick to my stomach about an hour and a half after I ate it."
Michael J.,"Miami Springs, FL",5,2,1,3.0,1/15/2017,Vast menu selection and the food is good. Service is slow and it is your typical chain restaurant.
Ana R.,"Sunrise, FL",10,13,,4.0,1/7/2017,This place is always good and open really late! They always offer coupons if you sign up for them and the food always tastes great. As good as it gets for a chain restaurant here in Gainesville.
Rick C.,"Atlanta, GA",0,3,,1.0,9/30/2016,"Save me from this god forsaken place. I am well into my second hour now waiting for my food, so I thought I'd pass the time by writing this review.  I'd tell you how the food was, but I don't have it."
Boon C.,"Tampa, FL",363,1503,8670,4.0,3/7/2015,"Great American style food. I love to stop by here when I travel north I-75. This is one of my many visits in this restaurant. They are located just outside of the oaks mall. It is a mile off I-75. When I drive from Tampa, this is my 2 hours driving stop. The restaurant customers are the Mall goer, UF student and professional. Very little tourist. Today I have the Classic Rib-Eye for lunch. I have their New York Steak before. But the Rib-Eye is the go to dish if you have to chose between the two. The dish comes with two sides. They have great selection of the sides in the menu. Today, I have chosen the roasted asparagus and the soup of the day - clam chowder. I like the ways they have select the material, the asparagus should be young and thin stem - less than ¼"" diameter. This is the best size that asparagus is not too fiber. The asparagus is grilled and season with spice. The clam chowder is actually comes in a bowl not a cup size. I have crust some black pepper on top. The clam is good chunk size. It is good for the hungry person. My rib-eye is come with good size also. I like it when it comes with a bit of fat that enhance the flavor of the steak. The gilled the steak to my order medium rare. I like the wood fire smell when they have the steak brought to me. This is typical American cuisine to near perfection. The meat material is good for the price that under $20. The restaurant has the handcrafted beer. It include the BJ's Light Switch Lager, Brewhouse Blonde, Piranha Pale Ale, Hop Storm IPA, Berry Burst Cedar and more..... Please try them if you are here."
-B- -.,"Gainesville, FL",12,36,2,4.0,12/15/2016,"We eat at BJs often. It's not that the food knocks your socks off, but the menu is gigantic so you can always find something to eat and the food is good enough to draw you in for the awesome beer (haven't had a bad beer at BJs yet - the Hefeweizen is my favorite)! Service is also typically great! The flatbreads are great, burgers are pretty good and all the appy's are a good size. All meals are pretty good.  You can also pay your bill with the BJs app and there's a great pokestop that is usually lured for the kiddies."
Mallory D.,"Newberry, FL",8,23,1,4.0,4/25/2016,Karen was wonderful and took the initiative to bring my 2 year old a starter plate with berries and a roll while she waited for her lunch. Always much appreciated when servers notice the struggle with children! Love the unlimited soup and salad at lunch during the week.
Kelsey H.,"Fredericksburg, VA",0,7,2,5.0,11/30/2016,Passing through Gainesville and we decided to stop here for dinner. It was amazing ! I got the grilled shrimp tacos and a snickerdoodle pizookie. So yummy! Best place I've eaten at in awhile. The beverage selection is also very diverse. My boyfriend enjoyed the craft beers they had to offer. Cool place with great food and a chill atmosphere.
Kelsey L.,"Fort White, FL",0,16,8,2.0,5/15/2016,"My boyfriend and I ordered food from this place. A appetizer and two meals. We got the calamari and I got the steak with mash potatoes and vegetables and he got the cherry salmon and we also ordered cheddar broccoli soup.  I'll start off with we ended up getting four broccoli soups instead of the Caesar salad my boyfriend also paid extra for. We did call and they took it off.  The calamari was horrible. No favor what's so ever. We threw it away. The steak was chewy, the mash potatoes was good, but the vegetables were disgusting. I ate the carrots out of it.  Let's move on. The cherry salmon my boyfriend said was good but the sauce tasted really weird. The best thing I'll say  was the broccoli soup. That was delicious. But the whole meal came out to $70 and just was not worth it to us. Go to chillis. Or tji Fridays."
Robert B.,"Rochester Hills, MI",113,84,64,4.0,1/14/2015,We stopped in Gainesville on our way home heading north and needed to find a nice place to eat that was open late. BJ's was close to I-75 and had a great atmosphere. Everything we ordered was tasty and enjoyable. I plan to visit again next time I'm in the area.
Pirata D.,"Miami, FL",0,22,30,5.0,12/28/2014,"I ordered the Seared Ahi Salad. I order this dish almost everywhere I go (see my other reviews), and this one ALMOST beats any other Ahi Tuna in town.  Generous portions of salad, and most importantly, the star attraction, the tuna! The dressing is perfection...light and bright.  This is my go-to dish after the gym, when in a time crunch for something healthy to eat.  Great atmosphere and staff. Had this dish twice so far, and will return for more.  FAB! UPDATE: I went back in late 2015, and the same salad now looks like a jumbled mess, nothing like the picture I originally posted. Went back again for same dish in June 2016, and it was no longer a jumbled mess. I'm a happy girl."
