Adam G.,"Gainesville, FL",11,100,3,2.0,5/30/2012,"I really can't say why I keep going back to this place. They do have one of my favorite beers, Smithwicks, on tap. I love microbrews, but am really not a fan of any of their house beers. The Jeremiah Red is alright, though at around $6 a beer, overpriced. On to the more important part, the food.  As best I can tell, BJ's is all about quantity, not quality. They give large portions, but almost every item I've tried has simply sucked. Their entrees seem to be the worst. Chicken Fried Steak, Parmesan Crusted Chicken, etc. Simply awful. As a big fry lover, theirs are awful. The only items I've had there that I don't completely feel I've wasted my money on are the burgers and pizza."
Christopher R.,"Brookline, MA",101,392,2,3.0,2/25/2012,"Food was so so, nothing special that you can not find at any other pub or microbrewery. They are a dime a dozen these days.  Service was horrendous. We sat around forever for drinks, then to order, then for our food to arrive. Once our food arrived due to the ""kitchen being busy and backed up"" it was cold. Mistake me if Im wrong but if your food takes that long to get to your table, it should least arrive hot. It wasnt even room tempature it was cold. Which means while our server was chit chatting with the other servers all standing around doing nothing, our food sat there getting cold. Definitely wont be back."
Coleen D.,"Gainesville, FL",211,13,4,4.0,10/20/2012,"Love coming here for lunch with friends. Their mojitos are tres yummy, and it's fun making a lunch out of shared appetizers. Favorite dishes: chicken potstickers, ahi poke, calamari - just to name a few. And their Chocolate Pazookie (sp?) is melted chocolate HEAVEN. No calories either from what I am told, though I am assuming that last part is a big fat lie. Fun atmosphere -- always crowded -- LOVE BJ's!"
Erica B.,"Gainesville, FL",2,11,1,3.0,6/25/2014,"Been there several times in the past and food has always been great.  Recently, it's been awhile since we had been there but we got a gift card and thought we'd use it for a nice weeknight meal.  We ordered takeout and every component was wrong or had missing ingredients including being sent the wrong soup entirely.  I thought it was just their takeout service since we had never had an issue before so we decided to try them again.  The service was good but the food was of poor quality and just didn't taste that good.  We even sent one dish back and got another sub par dish.  The one exception I will say was my sons mini corn dogs were fantastic."
Val T.,"Ocala, FL",33,103,5,4.0,12/3/2011,"Don't understand the lack luster reviews. Lunched here for the first time and the food was pretty good. Started off with the Avocado rolls.. I LOVE Avocados so it was a win for me. Had the 1/2 salad 1/2 flat bread also yummy ! Split the Tortilla soup with my friend, which was also very flavorful..could have come out a little warmer, but the hand poured ""presentation"" of the soup was nice. Finished with a chocolate dessert that left me in a chocolate haze.... so decadent ! Had the Berry Ice tea.. was a little on the sweeter side for my taste buds.  The house brewed beers didn't seem appealing enough to me to spend the 6.50+ a pop this time around. They do have a sampler though. They do have a MASSIVE menu ! The service was adequate. Our server seemed a little rushed and rushed us a bit with our ordering. Lacking some personality, but I guess what can you expect in a college town? Given the invite to dine here again.. I'd probably go."
Landon E.,"New York, NY",99,112,,4.0,5/23/2014,"BJ's has a lot of food choices so is a great option for picky eaters and just in general for someone who wants to try different things. Their food is probably around the 3 star range but their convenience, waitstaff and ambience push it up to 4. Great option for casual, dates, etc."
Morgan L.,"Orlando, FL",11,69,39,3.0,5/21/2012,"I do really enjoy BJs. They have a good variety and work well with my family's high maintenance eating requirements (which really do throw some restaurants for a loop). I'm not a beer person, but they make a mean mojito too. And shockingly, the chicken fried steak is fabulous.   The last two times I've been there my fries have been cold. Which sucks cause I love them. But I'm giving them another chance. So well see next time!"
Mohannad M.,"Gainesville, FL",0,4,,3.0,8/3/2015,"The first time I was there I had a realy nice dinner. The food was delicious and the dishes were big. unfortunately, the second time was very different. I had a small plates and the food wasn't that good. Maybe lunch differs from dinner."
Delia P.,"Ocala, FL",57,83,2,3.0,4/26/2011,"I'm almost at a loss for what to say.  Our experience was pretty neutral. My meal was really good (Parmesan Chicken with mashed potatoes)... The husband-like-man had Fish N Chips, which he wasn't too impressed with. From the other two people in our party, two were happy with their meals, two were very unhappy.  The wait staff was pleasant, our waitress was nice, helpful and attentive.  We had the 4 beer sampler, with Blond, Hefeweizen, Red, and Brunette. Personally, I prefer dark beers, and the Red was my favorite. I was not impressed with any of the other beers we ordered. The husband-like-man prefers Hefeweizen's and didn't even finish his.  Overall, it was enjoyable. I'm not in a hurry to get back there but wouldn't turn anyone down down inviting me."
Elizabeth R.,"Los Angeles, CA",66,214,34,3.0,11/21/2013,"If I were in a big city, there would be no reason for me to eat at BJ's, but since Gainesville has a limited amount of options we go on occasion. I like their simple grilled fish with Asian style rice. It tastes fresh and the sauce and rice are really good. The fish was also cooked well. My husband likes their burger a lot. For a chain restaurant it's pretty good."
Nolan R.,"Tampa, FL",111,295,94,2.0,2/21/2011,"It's not really anything to write home about. There is a HUGE wall of TV's for game watching and/or ignoring your significant other. I have been here two times. One time I ordered a burger and the other time I had a chicken sandwich. They weren't awful, but there weren't up to par for the area. I mean you could get a better meal across the parking lot at Ruby Tuesday's. Sure, it's not a marbly and woody inside, but you can't eat the marble or the wood, right? I'd go here again with a big group, but I don't plan on going back until I've tried other places around Gainesville first. If I do go back, I would like to try their Root Beer...I have heard it is pretty good."
Christina S.,"Boca Raton, FL",0,82,79,2.0,3/19/2015,"Food was not worth the price you pay at this location. Portions are good size, service was decent but no flavor for the grilled chicken pasta, Parmesan chicken was dry with zero flavor and the baby back ribs were dry and hard as if they were sitting under lamp lights way too long. I've eaten at BJs in other states and it been good, but here, terrible."
Scott L.,"Auburn, AL",7,28,1,4.0,8/26/2013,"Great craft beers.  Good food, a lot of variety.  Good place to watch sports in the bar area."
Cassie R.,"Gainesville, FL",17,56,3,3.0,1/11/2014,"A little overpriced and overrated, but I can't lie, I love BJ's. Usually seated in a timely manner and the service is always friendly. I love the strawberry lemonade and the flatbread pizzas most of all, but when I branch out and try new things here, they never disappoint! The appetizers are enough to satisfy me, but the pasta dishes I've had and the deep dish pizzas are wonderful. The pizookies...oh god, the pizookies...to die for! Ask about the rewards program and even if they're a bit pricey, you'll be able to rack up points for some kind of deal, especially if you go with a crowd. Sometimes it takes way too long for the food to get to the table, but when it does, it's bound to be tasty."
William C.,"Sarasota, FL",2,141,27,4.0,1/14/2014,"I stop here often on my way through Gville.  Great atmosphere and the food is good (considering that it's a chain).  I've had decent meals here and very good ones too.  Never bad.  It's a fun place to grab a bite and the menu offers a huge number of choices.   The staff is ALWAYS friendly.  While it's not Ruths Chris,  it's very good for the price and the upbeat atmosphere.   Think upscale sports bar.   I will be back."
Dennis C.,"Gainesville, FL",13,19,,4.0,5/24/2011,"When it comes to dining, I'm usually hands off when it comes to chain restaurants. So... I have yet to actually eat a full on, sit-down, meal there; my review is strictly based on the bar. Beer. And lots of it. Their quantity of selection is impressive. Their quality of selection is pretty good.  When I first went, prices seemed a touch high, but then I discovered happy hour on my subsequent visit - and that's where it got good. I think it was dollar of all drafts - which brought them down to a reasonable price. And half off all appetizers, including a few other things like flatbreads. All the appetizers I've had, have been great, and provide plenty of food to fill me up. I especially like the chicken dumplings and the ahi poke. The little mini tacos are great as well (love the chipotle flavored salsa). Oh, and another great thing about the bar, is that it's very big and there are also plenty of booths and high tops to sit at as well. All first come first serve. Don't let the big line out in front of the place scare you away!"
Eladio D.,"Orlando, FL",0,8,7,3.0,11/10/2013,"This is the best restaurant for miles. We drive about 45 miles one way to eat in this place . Its a great place from the staff to the manager . Lately I have noticed that the steaks are not like before , the meat is hard and tasteless. There is a very large selection of food . I would have given this place a 5 but because of the hard and tasteless steaks  I give it a 3."
Jim B.,"Tampa, FL",59,599,138,2.0,2/4/2011,"After 3 separate visits to this place since it opened, I have yet to get what the big deal is. The food has been mostly greasy. One meal was so bad I complained, to no avail.... Service ranged from indifferent (yeah, when I say its greasy, that is a hint to ask about replacing it - yo) to average. I don't like beer, so this whole brewhouse thing is lost on me. I'm certain that someone likes the place, since it does tend to be busy at many times. I'm not gonna be back anytime soon. Its not really 'one star' but it only barely rates two."
W M.,"Temple Terrace, Tampa Bay, FL",1,30,4,5.0,12/13/2014,The food is truly delicious and the customer service is amazing! Michael was so attentive and even packed our desert on ice so that the ice cream would not melt. This place is excellent.
Robinskii G.,"West Covina, CA",33,77,430,3.0,7/13/2013,"Been wanting BJs since being in CA.  There isn't a BJs in the panhandle so when I saw it, i made sure we pulled over to dine in.  our server, Michelle was super nice.  She knew the menu and she def knew what sauce goes with the  dishes.  our chicken lettuce wrap came out with the wrong sauce, when i called her over to mention it, she caught it before I even got the chance to say anything.  The food wasn't as I remembered it in CA. but it was still satisfying.  Got:  Chicken lettuce wraps, which is good, if served with the right sauces.  Traditional Wings: normally its lightly drizzled with buffalo and ranch... i like it lightly sauced, so I really like it only drizzled. but it came out a little more wet than I prefer.  Santa Fe rolls were a hit  Artichoke pizza, hubs says it was okay, had chucks of some kind of cream cheese, which was overwhelming.  Ahi poke..... ummm you should just pass on this... its fresh fish... but def not poke tasting."
