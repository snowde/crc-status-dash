John W.,"Gainesville, FL",2,22,,1.0,3/15/2013,"My rating is based on the outrageous beer prices. If it was based on food, it would be 3-4stars. Feels like a chain because it is one."
Matt H.,"Gainesville, FL",1,60,2,4.0,1/18/2014,"I've probably been here a dozen or so times and I love this place.  Never a bad meal.  Of course they can get a little busy on a Friday or Saturday night but the wait is always worth it.  For the last few visits my fiance has been saying ""try the deep dish pizza"" and I've always said no thanks as I didn't see the point of going to BJ's and getting pizza.  Well last week I finally tried her pizza and it was amazing...literally amazing.  Sounds crazy but go to BJ's for the pizza!"
Amanda E.,"Tampa, FL",258,111,50,5.0,3/26/2013,"I think BJ's is great. The service is always enjoyable, there is a great atmosphere, and the food and drink selection is vast and delicious. They have great beers on tap- even a unique Berry Burst Cider of their own brand. I have always enjoyed my experiences and think BJ's is a solid regular in my book."
Derek S.,"Tampa, FL",122,103,18,4.0,3/20/2013,We stopped by here to have a couple of beers and watch the UF basketball game. They had $5.95 lunch specials so I got the Mediterranean flat bread and salad special. Accompanied by a reserve brew that they had which was delicious. The beers are a little pricey but they do offer a good variety of their own beers and some domestic/imports on draft and bottles/cans. We sat at the bar and enjoyed the game on a TV that had to be over 100 inches. The food has always been good at BJs and I enjoy the atmosphere. I will definitely be going back sometime soon.
Patrick N.,"Gainesville, FL",0,1,,1.0,3/17/2015,"Got here before another table and they got served first,  the front desk woman was rude.  She greeted me but didn't ask what she could do for me,  we sat for 15 minutes until we got our drinks.  This is my first time here and it will be my last. I specified my order and it still came wrong.  I refused to pay for it. It's ridiculous"
David N.,"Gainesville, FL",29,11,1,4.0,6/14/2013,Diverse menu & consistent food.  Love their deep dish pizzas and their draft beers.
Coleen T.,"Gainesville, FL",216,255,93,3.0,1/21/2013,"Came here for dinner with the whole family.... the service was good and the food was edible.   There wasn't really anything spectacular about it all, and I'm not sure if we will be going back any time soon... but it's in a pretty convenient location and it seems like their menu has something for everybody."
Travis L.,"Gainesville, FL",22,160,11,2.0,6/26/2012,"BJ's struggles with the basic functions of running a restaurant.  Last last two times I have come here they have brought my food out and I have then had to ask for silverware.  Another issue I had was appetizer came out after my entree.  Needless the say the service is never good here.  That honestly takes away 2 and a half stars in my mind and the overpriced food is where they lose the other half star.  In the food quality section they pick up the two stars here.  The menus is way too big but most of the food is good. They do have a legit happy hour with half of appetizers and mini pizzas and drink discounts.  The beer they make it overrated but they do allow you to taste some so it's worth trying at least one. Overall, good food and bad everything else."
L W.,"Henderson, NV",0,14,,5.0,9/18/2013,"Great Food, Atmosphere and Service We have been here many times in the last year and a half and always had excellent food and service.  Tonight was a different experience with the hostess and starting off on the wrong foot.  I won't go into the details but when we sat down we were still contemplating if we were even going to stay.  Shortly after a Manager by the name of George came up to our table and apologized and better explained the situation.  I was impressed that he was on top of it and even knew about the situation.  Like always the food and service was great and we enjoyed our time.  Again, very impressed when he came back after dinner to see how everything was.  Excellent Experience and highly recommend for good food and great service!"
Aidan A.,"Gainesville, FL",0,10,,5.0,11/4/2013,"This is my favorite place to go for birthdays, promotions, and other celebratory occasions with friends. Incredible food (with great selection), and they brew their own (amazing) beer. Try the taster flight!"
Damion W.,"Gainesville, FL",38,87,4,3.0,8/3/2013,"This place is hit or miss. Some days it deserves five stars, other days just one. Food is always pretty strong. I always order either the jambalaya or the fried chicken. Both are great. The service isn't nearly as consistent. The servers are generally very nice, but often very slow. Not necessarily their faults, but it can be very frustrating."
P B.,"The Villages, FL",2,157,129,4.0,9/11/2012,"My daughter & I had lunch here after a medical appointment.  She had never been to a BJ's. Our server, Ryan, was attentive. We both enjoyed our drinks & lunch. The menu selections are plentiful.  Now that my daughter has experienced a BJ's, she will eat at one again."
Kris T.,"Citrus Springs, FL",28,71,5,5.0,12/18/2013,"LOVE, LOVE this place!  Awesome servers!  Friendly, easy to engage and knowledgeable.  Food runners, they pre bus, the food is reasonable, nice variety, inventive and delicious.  We love going there."
Heather M.,"Athens, GA",51,14,12,5.0,7/27/2012,Fast lunch! We had the Cobb salad & fish tacos. Very tasty & fresh. Great beer too.
Sean B.,"Gainesville, FL",21,8,,4.0,12/25/2012,"This is a great place to grab a drink after work. The burgers are good, the steaks are okay. Don't look to go here on a very small budget but if you want a place for a nice dinner this isn't bad."
April O.,"Gainesville, FL",99,267,56,2.0,11/23/2009,"I've been back enough times to form a more informed opinion about this place.  And I've also gotten to eat a deep-dish pizza that didn't make me want to hurl, so that's gotta count for something! So far, I've had most of the appetizers--the best beginnings (spinach/artichoke dip, Santa Fe spring rolls, avocado egg rolls, mozz sticks), the Piranha Pale Ale nachos, the potato skins, the shrimp lettuce wraps, and the chicken wings.  The only one that we've ordered more than once were the chicken wings.  The other dishes don't stand out for better or worse. We've had all of the flatbread pizzas and enjoyed them thoroughly.  Those actually taste good and come out hot and fresh, which is a problem with some places in town (yo, New Deal!).  I would return for these. Entree-wise, I've stuck with the baked potatoes or the fish tacos.  Both are enjoyable enough to keep me from being picky.  I do observe what other people get when I come, but none of it looks like a must-try. As for the deep-dish pizza, very recently Brice and I tried a create-your-own pizza with ... meatballs, sausage, green peppers, and roasted garlic.  Could it be?  Is that ... an abruzzese pizza?  It is!  So that means we still don't like their signature pizzas. We're currently live right next to this place, but we're about to move, and I'm pretty sure that I won't be driving back over here to eat unless it's 11 p.m. and I happen to be awake and hungry.  The late closing hour is pretty much the only thing that keeps me coming back, but heck, I can make baked potatoes and flatbreads at home.  2.5 stars for the consistently good waitstaff."
Pam F.,"Fernandina Beach, FL",2,85,7,1.0,5/15/2012,"I've been here three times and the service was horrible every time. The restaurant was about 1/4 full and we waited over 35 minutes for our food to arrive after ordering. Plus, a beer costs $6.25. That's outrageous when there isn't much else to compensate. Atmosphere is just average for pub/sports bar. Food is the same as any other pub. I'll choose something else next time."
John O.,"Portland, OR",8,75,,2.0,10/28/2009,"Went to BJ's because a friend told me they had an unusual beer that I like.  The beer was on the menu and I ordered it, but after a long wait, I was told they were out, as was my next choice AND my third choice!  I finally ordered one of their micro-brews and got a beer after I was in the place for at least 45 minutes.  It was OK.   The food was pretty sub-par.  Greasy and bland, but large portions.  Hmm, is a large portion of greasy, bland food a good thing or a bad thing?  The waiter did not return to the table throughout the meal.  I would have ordered another beer, but was not given the opportunity.  I doubt I'll go back."
Michael M.,"Boston, MA",56,145,310,3.0,12/6/2010,It was the run of the mill food spot nothing stood out nothing horrible. If I was in gainesville again would I come here again uh maybe.
Zach W.,"Istanbul, Turkey",64,14,4,4.0,7/18/2012,"When I go to restaurants I typically find a menu item I like and stick with it every time I am there. BJ's, however, is one of the few places I go where I get something different each time. They have great burgers, sandwiches, and pastas, but I think I can say that the category in which they truly excel is their specialty wood-fired pizzas. My favorite is the Buffalo Chicken Pizza that is better than any other similar pizza that I've had in town. I've been probably a dozen times in the last three years and for the most part the service has been good, but there's been a couple times that it seems like it has taken a lot longer than it should, both while waiting (when the restaurant looks empty) and while being served."
