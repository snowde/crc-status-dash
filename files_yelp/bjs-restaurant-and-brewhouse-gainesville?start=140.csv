Diana D.,"Gainesville, FL",0,16,,3.0,7/10/2014,"My husband's parents came up for a brief visit so we all went to BJ's. Wouldn't have gone unless someone else suggested, but it was pretty good. My hubby swears it was the best restaurant burger he's ever had. The pizookie was pretty good but overpriced in my opinion. I had a plethora of the small plates (which I appreciate existing because I tend to prefer stuff like that as compared to entrees that I can rarely finish on my own) and shared them with the fam - the caprese salad (which was really good), bruchetta (which was okay), stuffed mushrooms (not the greatest), and fried artichoke hearts (the dip was good but they were just meh). Overall we had a good time despite the TVs cutting out constantly due to a huge storm that hit, but I doubt we will return."
John L.,"Gainesville, FL",52,141,50,1.0,5/5/2009,"I think they may be putting all their eggs in the ""brewhouse"" basket. In all honesty I have yet to develop a serious palate for beer; so I cannot in good conscience rate their beer selection on other than subjective terms. In short, I liked some and others...not so much. But what about the food? We picked at a sampler type app which consisted of avocado egg rolls, mozzarella sticks, chips and salsa, and a spinach and artichoke dip. In a nutshell: brought-in flash-frozen pre-fab cost-per-unit turn and burn.  Verdict? Have a beer or two (liquor takes forever to arrive for some reason, even when it's just a shot of vodka or tequila), and head to Boston Market for dinner; this place is Gainesville's answer to Houston's."
Tami E.,"Gainesville, FL",48,4,,1.0,7/27/2011,"On our last visit to BJs,  my husband and I stood up and left because the service was so bad. We sat down, waited about 5 minutes to be acknowledged and gave our drink order. They waiter came back with our drinks, but forgot to bring me sweetener.  He promised to come right back to get our food orders. We saw him walk by with food for tables all over the restaurant. He stopped by the table beside us twice, but walked right by us. I was sitting there with a drink that I couldn't drink and we were hungry. I happened to check in on Facebook when we sat down. We had been at our table for 26 minutes and our order hadn't been taken. We left money on the table to pay for the drinks and left. I spoke to the manager, who apologized and offered me gift certificates, but we won't be going back.  This is a pattern for this restaurant. Once, I ordered a special Alpine martini and got an apple martini.  No big deal until the waiter returned with the same drink and told me that the bartender didn't know what I was talking about. I had to show  him the menu to get the drink that I wanted. Another time, I sent food back to the kitchen because it was wrong. The waiter took it back, still came back wrong. Then the MANAGER took it back and it still came back wrong. My husband was finished eating and I hadn't received any food.  I was shocked that I was still billed for the food. Another time the waiter argued with my aunt that they didn't make blonde fish only blonde shrimp.  She had to show him the menu and he didn't apologize for arguing with her. Granted we have been there a few times with no problem, but more often than not the service is terrible. The food isn't good enough to put up with the terrible service. There are too many restaurants in Gainesville to take a chance with BJs."
Tiffany A.,"Gainesville, FL",9,12,14,4.0,7/1/2010,"I go to BJ's a lot, more so when it first opened.  It is where I take my friends out to eat if they've never been.  The reason is, they have a variety of food options to meet everyone's needs.  If you know someone who is picky, then I suggest you take them here.  Prices are decent.  The service is so so...sometimes you get great service, sometimes you don't.   The reason why I think BJ's has gotten only okay reviews is you just have to know the right things to order.  I've found out that although they take pride in their deep dish pizza's, they are mediocre at best.  I've never had a great deep dish pizza there.  I go to Satchel's for that.  Now if you go outside of the pizza facade, appetizer wise...their avocado eggrolls are refreshingly amazing!  Their brushetta is delicious.  And their flatbread appetizers are mouthwatering.  They have great seafood entrees.  But the best part is dessert...the infamous Pizookie.  No lie, the pizookie is the icing on the cake.  Basically, a deep dish cookie/brownie served hot with ice cream scoops on top. This is one of those restaurants that I make sure I save room for dessert!"
Chet L.,"Gainesville, FL",44,65,25,2.0,4/27/2009,"Tried this place out the other night, somewhere new and trendy where we could all feel like we were cool.  We were put outside right underneath the loudest speaker west of the stadium, which gets really annoying when Todd Party Of Seven doesn't respond the first eight times they are called. Won't mention our server's name here, but we had to ask for utensils. And napkins. I wanted a straw but that would have been another trip. If she had tables inside as well as outside, then this is partly the fault of whoever scattered her tables so she couldn't concentrate on one area.  The food was okay. Waited ten minutes to try my chili after it arrived since the server forgot my Tabasco, but the rest of the food was arriving by then. Was told a 'Wedge Salad' was a quarter wedge of iceberg lettuce. It was more like a thin 1/8th of a quarter. So I guess it was actually as she said, a quarter of a wedge of undermined width, and I just assumed that meant a quarter of a head of lettuce. Anyway, it was okay, but goopy since their was much more dressing than lettuce. Since my friend's food was there by this time, I had only a bite of the chili before asking for a container. Having camped out that weekend, I am 92% sure it was Hormel's chili. If not, they did a great job at copying the essence of canned chili. Friends had the meat loaf and chicken parmesan dinners, both looked great with creamy mashed potatoes, but neither cared for theirs. The meat loaf was gelatinous and the chicken was sliced so thin there's no way it couldn't have been dry. Some chains have a policy that the manager is supposed to greet every table at one point during their visit. If BJ's has this policy then it wasn't followed or I would have mentioned this at the time. Wanted to see a pizza but no one near us had gotten one. I didn't have a beer, maybe if I'd just gone to the bar and not eaten it would have been a better experience for me. But  I got to do the 'told ya so' routine and insured that the next outing with be my choice and will be far from the mall. Parking was fine. I am still wondering where Todd Party Of Seven ended up going though."
Angel I.,"Gainesville, FL",14,139,3,2.0,12/11/2011,"Food was good but service was horrible- even management didn't respond appropriately. Went there with my staff to celebrate a bon voyage and did not have good service all the way around. It took forever for us to be greeted by our server, to get our drinks, we were never updated on the status of our food, and received an attitude by our server thinking someone in the group was lying that they were 26 (I understand questioning, but not with an attitude) and some in our party never got refills on their lemonade. When we were leaving I spoke with management and they were just focused on the server questioning about the drinking age and didn't even focus on the poor service overall, which was my main issue. I was not pleased and may never return because service is my biggest pet peeve."
Brice O.,"Gainesville, FL",10,18,1,3.0,5/27/2009,"So after going to BJs a few times, with a few different people, at a few different times, I think I've figured something out: BJ's is a pleasant dining experience hidden in a field of land mines. I've had an overall pleasant experience dining there but I've noticed several things about the place that I knew I should immediately avoid. 1. DON'T GET THE BEER, IT'S A TRAP! I guess since it's a ""Brewhouse"" people feel obligated to at least try the beer. While I'm not a beer drinker, I've been there with casual beer drinkers and some pretty hard-core beer drinkers and the best reaction I've seen to one of their beers is ""meh"" with the more normal reaction being some kind of vague nasuea I will say that the first time I went they were nice enough to bring out samplers for me and my co-wokers (free of charge).  2. Just avoid the alcohol all together. I'm not a beer drinker but liquor is another story. I know that individual bartenders have as much to do with the drinks as anything, but drinks in restaurants are too expensive for me to get another one after getting a bad first drink. And the Manhattan I ordered was easily one of the worst drinks I've had this year. 3. It's worth eating but not necessarily worth the wait. This is a newer restaurant in Gainesville and in a high traffic area. So it's going to be crowded, especially during the times when the slightly older crowds would be eating. I've noticed that going there around 10pm or for lunch the wait is negligible, but during normal dinner time you're probably looking at a 40 minute wait (at least while this is the new place to go). The restaurant really doesn't help itself in this area because (outside of the bar or outdoors) there are no tables for small parties. Each table could easily seat between 2-6 people, which makes you feel a little put off when you've got 6 people and see 2 person parties taking all the tables.  4. The food is good, not outstanding. There's nothing on BJs menu that's going to make me go running back to them, but there's plenty there that I would gladly eat if the opportunity presents itself. I personally like their Fish and Chips (although it's admittedly a little on the bland side), Burger Melt, and the cookie desert. Also, I'm pretty sure my wife hates each one of those things with equal passion, but she's been able to find several things on their menu (like the baked potato) that she likes as well. So there's nothing wrong with the food, and some of it might offer a pleasant surprise, just don't go there expecting anything life changing.  So overall, I do like this place, and I'll be going there again at some point, I just have to make sure I avoid the alcohol, don't go when I know it'll be busy, and keep my expectations at a moderate level. (hmm, I swear that was supposed to sound better than it came out)"
J B.,"Miami, FL",0,11,,4.0,4/1/2013,"We have eaten here numerous times.  The service has always been great, as is the food.  Food prices everywhere are going up, and BJ's is no exception.  I have never been there when there wasn't a lot of people.  This is a good sign the food is good.  I do recommend this restaurant and will continue to visit.  Keep up the good job!"
Kate P.,"Gainesville, FL",0,4,,2.0,10/21/2013,"Went there today to celebrate a co-worker's b-day. Ordered a simple turkey sandwich, added charge for avocado. We got there at 11 when it opened so no crowd yet. The sandwich came with the core of the lettuce on it and less than a slice of avocado. Mentioned this to the waiter. Instead of bringing me a little more avocado, which I requested, he insisted on taking my whole plate back to remake the sandwich. By the time it came back out my lunch hour was up and my party was finished eating. Had to take my sandwich home in a box. I wasn't asking for a free meal but a small adjustment off the bill would have been nice since I paid $11.00+ to sit and drink water and watch my friends eat and take home a sandwich that I didn't have time to eat once I got back to the office."
Stacie W.,"Gainesville, FL",29,43,7,4.0,1/15/2012,"I like that this place is centrally located and their menu is so large that we can go and something different every time. The food is good as well, the santa Fe chicken salad and pot roast are my favorites."
Kate F.,"Boca Raton, FL",6,4,,5.0,11/10/2011,Delicious food! Definitely have to try the parmesan crusted chicken! Definitely will go back!
Gramley A.,"Gainesville, FL",18,68,,4.0,8/24/2011,BJ's is an enjoyable place to go in Gainesville. Good food great beer and they even have gluten-free options. Their gluten-free pizza as actually decent and a comparable price to Pizza Vito
Gator D.,"Gainesville, FL",0,20,,3.0,1/24/2014,Been here more times than warranted given price and food. Most foods are pre-prepared and reheated and cannot be modified. Good beer selection but expensive. Happy hour at the bar is the best value with half-price mini pizzas. Usually always very crowded and calling ahead for a reservation still will not guarantee you seating when you want it. They say they will stay open late however I have been there a few evenings and have been gently given the check when it has been a slow night. I wish my friends did not like coming here as much as they do. Service here is also very hit or miss depending on how crowded the restaurant is and how many people are in your party.
Kevin W.,"Gainesville, FL",13,25,,3.0,5/8/2009,"Ok, so maybe I was a little premature in my original review.  Came with friends for Cinco de Mayo.  The place was relatively busy, but we got a table pretty fast.  The worst part was the wait time for drinks.  10-15 minutes per order.  I felt bad for the server who was actually really good and nice and attentive.  She kept apologizing for the bar.   I ventured away from their pizza and had the chili cheese burger.  It was decent, but nothing incredible.   The next time I go, I will sit at the bar again and order pizza.  Stick with what works, I guess.   I still think the place is decent and worth visiting again.  I enjoy the atmosphere and decor."
Maria D.,"Gainesville, FL",0,5,,5.0,12/16/2013,"Probably my favorite chain restaurant in Gainesville, hands down. They have a fairly large menu, even though I always go for the pizza or burgers (their fries are delicious). I love deep-dish pizzas and theirs never fails. Check out their lunch menu (only on Monday-Friday) for some good deals. Last time I went I got a mini pizza and salad for about $8. If you sign up for their rewards card, they send out free pizookies (cookie with ice cream on top) pretty often. This place is my go-to."
Shirley N.,"Dunnellon, FL",1,18,,3.0,8/8/2012,The kitchen is very slow.  My meal was not prepared as I wanted.  Salads very good.  Beer too expensive.
Belle C.,"Gainesville, FL",10,82,,3.0,12/29/2009,"My fiance and I ended up here for lunch on Christmas Eve after finishing up some last-minute shopping at the mall.  I'd been curious about this place, but also wary of it because it looks like a knockoff Hops, and I never liked Hops.  Also because, although it's not actually in the mall, it's a mall outparcel and I never have good experiences with Mall Restaurants.  But we were hungry, and were already parked right in front of it, so in we went. The spiral-bound menu opens with a list of their specialty beers, which we didn't try.  The rest of the menu is a bit Cheesecake Factory - esque; they have a little bit of everything (soups, salads, sandwiches, pizza, dinner entrees).  We had a hard time deciding, so ordered a few things to try: avocado egg rolls, barbecue chicken chopped salad, chicken club sandwich (typical chicken club with the addition of avocado), and California chicken sandwich (this one had peppers, cheese, and chipotle mayo).  The avocado egg rolls were delicious, but you have to like avocado because that's about the only thing in there.  I enjoyed the salad, too - it was huge, and had a good ratio of toppings to lettuce.  The sanwiches, however, were completely bland.  Sandwiches come with a choice of seasoned wedge fries or crispy thin fries; we got one of each and both liked the crispy ones better.  Service was cheerful, enthusiastic, and quick. Overall, it was a pleasant lunch and I'd go back to try more of the salads and appetizers."
Lois R.,"Blue Bell, PA",2,38,,4.0,11/28/2012,"Went to this with my son and his girlfriend, just for dessert.  We shared a Pizookie Trio and it was awesome.  Menu said fresh-baked cookie, and this was still warm from the oven with ice cream on top.  They thought the chocolate was too rich, but it was my favorite of the three.  TVs in all directions, which was good since we were monitoring multiple football games.  The only negative was that after we were seated, it was quite a while before a server even came by to see she'd be with us shortly."
R. S.,"Gainesville, FL",0,21,,4.0,5/24/2010,"We have eaten here several times recently, both as just my husband and I and also with a large group twice.  I'm not sure why this has received such poor reviews - I consider myself fairly picky and I didn't think it was that bad. They have a huge menu, similar to Cheesecake Factory or TGI Friday's.  So if you don't like restaurants with a chain feel, this may be a strike against it.  I think because they have such a broad menu, they have a lot of variety but not every dish will be top-notch.  My husband really likes their deep dish pizzas.  I was pleased with the roast beef sandwich and cheeseburger, but I was disappointed with the calzone I ordered once - it was really small and honestly I've had better at takeout pizza places.  Overall, I think the prices are very fair but I did notice that they don't bring out any bread or salads for the table. Service has been pretty good and we have always been seated in less than 10 minutes even with a large party.  We received poor service once, when our server also had a large party and pretty much neglected us other than taking our orders, but that seems to have been an exception. My favorite thing about BJ's and what keeps us coming back is the huge selection of beers.  They have at least 2 pages of draft beers, including their own microbrews.  It reminded me of Stubbie's and Steins, but less pricey and more accessible (Stubbie's has more selections of course, but I thought BJ's was impressive considering it's mainly a restaurant and not a bar).   Overall, I think this is a decent restaurant for a casual lunch/dinner."
felicity b.,"Gainesville, FL",0,33,,2.0,6/18/2009,Tried this place twice.  It seems quite overrated to me.  Once I got a burger and the next time a pizza.  You can't really walk out of there without spending quite a bit of money.  Especially if you get a beverage. The atmosphere is very open.  You are literally right on top of the table next to you unless you get a booth. Food is just like eating at an over glorified Chili's that serves pizza.  I will probably only eat here again if someone else pays for the bill.
