Camilo R.,"Gainesville, FL",0,9,,5.0,3/22/2011,"I love BJ's! Its a favorite spot for my family and friends to go when we want to do something special but not too pricey. I always go with their sandwiches, their burgers are great (especially the bacon cheese ones!) and my favorite entree is the balsamic glazed chicken. In one word, amazing. Their fries are delicious, and if you don't want to get their alcoholic beverages, getting their freshly brewed root beer is a must! It is by far the best root beer I have ever tasted, not too fizzy, dark and rich, with a slight toffee note. The best thing to do after a satisfying meal here? Get a pizookie, they are freshly baked deep-dish cookies served a-la-mode and are to die for. I have honestly come here just to order a pizookie and root beer (some say too sweet together, I say its just right!) Service can be a bit slow, but I have yet to experience something I didn't like (anything with their pale-ale chili though is so-so not amazing but not bad)"
