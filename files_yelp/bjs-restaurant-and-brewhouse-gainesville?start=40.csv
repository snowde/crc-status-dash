Lanise A.,"Miami, FL",7,85,98,4.0,2/13/2015,"Decided to try the Deep Dish Lasagna from here, although they may as well just call it Ravioli since it's not really lasagna. Nevertheless, it was the lunch hour so the restaurant was pretty busy. I did manage to be seated and get a drink without waiting quite some time. I thought I would order an appetizer before the big meal, so I opted for Mac n Cheese. Big mistake. Although it looked good, the taste said otherwise. Soon after getting Mac n Cheese my lasagna arrived, and it tasted delicious, but I'm not too fond with all of the sauce. The ravioli was drowning in it! I also wanted to order my pizookie early to save some time, so while I was eating my 2-flavor pizookie (Chocolate Chunk & Cookies and Cream) was served.  Overall, the food wasn't bad, but I know that I can save money by skipping the appetizer and ordering water instead of a soft drink and lemonade which is almost $3. This place is a favorite among my fellow students, so maybe I'll stop by again."
Alex D.,"Liberty Township, OH",4,4,,5.0,7/5/2016,"2 years ago I found out I had a wheat allergy. They have the best gf pizza out there. Service is always great, and their staff does a great job of making sure there is no cross contamination. Definitely recommend, and we look forward to our weekly visits!"
Jenn C.,"Gainesville, FL",20,37,53,2.0,6/20/2016,Have to explain I was very disappointed. We took our daughter to lunch for her birthday. We ordered three salads and a bread bowl soup. One salad came ten minutes before the rest of our food. we didn't see our waiter for a while and I finely had to ask some one to send him out. I told him we only have one salad and we ordered three he told me they bring stuff out as it is ready and they are working on it. I had to explain that when a family comes in to eat a meal together they intend to eat together not one at a time. I was taken back at what was going on it made no scene at all! Lucky it was a salad and was already cold so we could wait on the rest of the food but that is not how you serve meals to a family at a restaurant. Even McDonalds gives you the entire order at once not piece by piece.
Pele W.,"Gainesville, FL",5,41,2,2.0,8/21/2015,"If Chili's and Applebee's and TGIFriday's all got together and had a love child, BJ's would be it. Went there to have a beer and snack on some appetizers. The craft beers overall were decent. The appetizers could've been better; the slider appetizer has four Krystal-sized little burgers with rather tasteless thin little patties of meat and alongside as toppings are precisely four pickle slices with a sprinkling of shredded lettuce and nothing else, some tomato would've been nice. The fried artichoke hearts weren't quite hot on arrival, some of them had disconcertingly cool centers. The calamari was overdone, you don't expect the tentacles to have the texture of toothpicks in your mouth. Overall to me it's a ""big box"" version of the aforementioned ""fresh from the freezer"" trendy restaurants. Would not recommend unless you like beer. A lot."
Ted P.,"Lawrenceville, GA",0,6,1,5.0,9/10/2016,"Stopped in for lunch before the FL/KY football game. Seated quickly and was greeted by Robert.  Beer selection is wonderful and sodas are homemade.  Had the avocado rolls which were very good.  I had the tomato bisque soup and Mediterranean chicken tacos.  Very good again.  My son ordered a hamburger medium rare and came out well done.  Robert put in an order to remake it and unfortunately it was more medium well when it arrived the second time.  Manager stopped by, apologized and comped the burger.  Other than the burger snafu, food and service was excellent! Robert was a very good server."
Stephanie L.,"Bluffton, SC",154,4,1,5.0,3/2/2016,"Such an amazing atmosphere, amazing staff and amazing food! Restaurant was beautiful, welcoming and clean. The server, Victor, was knowledgable and polite and checked back with us just enough but not too much! Food was out of this world! I started with a house salad which was the perfect starter size and dressed beautifully. The entrees came after but enough time to enjoy our salads. I had the crispy jalapeno burger and added some guacamole to it and it was phenomenal! It was not only cooked perfectly, but I haven't seen a presentation that made my mouth water like that in quite some time! I would recommend this place to anyone!"
Michael J.,"Louisville, KY",0,118,9,4.0,5/29/2016,"Very good. Glazed salmon was excellent as was the salad and sides. Service at the bar, prima!"
Gelene D.,"Leesburg, GA",23,8,,5.0,1/20/2017,Great service. Fantastic food. Very accommodating  to special orders. Had fun time with friends.  All persons were so friendly and knowledgeable about such a large menu.
Ed W.,"Gainesville, FL",221,815,1256,2.0,7/6/2015,"Dude, this place is always crowded, but tonight I finally got in. On entry, we were greeted with a funky foot smell ... i mean we nearly turned around and left, but thought what the heck. It's way way noisy, I mean rock concert noisy. Not a place to take a date unless you don't want to talk to your date. Ok, so I got the Pot Stickers as an app. They were soggy, and not crunchy as they are supposed to be around the edges. I also had the fish tacos, but the sauce was funky, and certainly not chipotle sauce as advertised. The fries were also cold. The one good thing was the Orange cream soda ... it really was good, but then the server did not bring me a straw until the main course arrived, so I couldn't even enjoy it with my app. I mean dude! All in all, it was an experience worthy of McDonalds, except it was like four or five times as expensive. I don't think we will be back."
Emily X.,"Gainesville, FL",0,1,,5.0,8/4/2016,"We stopped in at 10pm on a Wednesday night, and were immediately seated by the friendliest waitress ever. We got two ciders (the berry burst cider is amazing), the peppered BBQ boneless wings, a jalapeno burger and a French dip sandwich. Everything was absolutely delicious, and very filling.  This was my first time at a BJ's, and I walked in not particularly expecting anything great, but I was very pleasantly surprised. Christina was the BEST waitress - super attentive and friendly, and gave us recommendations to try for next time and even samples of a peach cider they had on tap. We'll definitely be returning here when we get a chance. Overall a great experience!"
Dylan R.,"Tampa, FL",67,5,,1.0,7/2/2016,"I should start this review by saying, I love BJ's... however I would not recommend this location. My girlfriend and I sat at the bar like we always do. After finally trying to order drinks, we handed the bartender our IDs. She had no problem with my girlfriend's Tennessee license, but mine was a paper license from the state of Tennessee which I had JUST gotten while renewing my license (I'm 23) 2 days earlier. The bartender took it to her manager, who then brought it back to me and told me she couldn't accept it because it wasn't laminated..... I explained to her that it wasn't lamimated because of the counterfeit-proof paper they use, but she wouldn't listen. The paper license is made out of paper similar to a dollar bill.. you hold it to the light, and it has hidden watermarks that couldn't be copied anywhere. Laminating a paper license that you could only verify when held to the light would make it an illegal license.. We left the restaurant immediately extremely disappointed without ordering, and walked to Buffalo Wild Wings across the parking lot who happily accepted my paper license at the sight of the official water markings. After a long day of traveling, all I wanted was a good beer. Extremely disappointed with our experience."
Kimberly G.,"Gainesville, FL",3,3,,5.0,6/21/2016,Our server Karen O. was super knowledgeable and nice . She was very attentive and we would love to have her again! The Monkey Bread Pizookie is AMAZING!
Savannah P.,"Gainesville, FL",279,10,,4.0,7/11/2016,"Pretty good food for a chain restaurant and the pizookies and pizza are great, yet it tends to be slow and things seem to go wrong often; however the management and wait staff are accommodating. I also tend to think the silverware tastes very metallic, but that might just be me."
Tracy D.,"Portland, OR",132,100,50,4.0,6/12/2014,"We ALWAYS sit at the bar. 90% of the time the bartenders are fantastic (there is/was one we don't care for). Food is usually solid and tasty. Drinks are good. Prices are a bit high, but they have a decent happy hour discount. (Not great, but helpful). We return here often due to convenience and service. The Rewards program also sends out good offers for mid-week dining. A buy one get one entree free coupon pulled us in on a Wednesday afternoon. Seriously, of all the BJ's I've been to, I think this is the best. If Cliff is working (bar or waiter) sit with him for superior service."
Matt D.,"Gainesville, FL",16,1,,1.0,12/26/2016,"This is the worste service ive ever had . Not to mention the ""BJ"" ribeye steak was cooked over what i ordered. I ordered medium rear . Steak came medium. Any steakhouse knows the rule of thumb . Under cook a steak to be cautious . If its under then u can fix it. If its over then theres no fixing it. My wife was already done with her dinner by the time the "" server"" , if u can call him that , said they could do a refire. We all know what that means. Spit on it and serve. And the server didnt even bother to offer a comp. The manager came out and said ""i should have been aware of this already"". Good on you ""manager"". Too little too late. Ive had many good experiences there before ,but this was too much. They think their name is good enough to keep people coming back. Yeah , maybe the hipsters who get a drink and pizza. But not me. Even the manager didnt bring the server back to explain why he ran off and dropped our ticket at the table without an ounce of remorse. Horrible cooking, horrible service(by one individual), and a horrible excuse by the ""so called manager"". The really good servers are outweighed by the ones who are just there to get a paycheck. And i gave a 20%tip anyway , giving the server the benefit of the doubt. Not anymore. I even offered to pay for someone else' tab before when they did an eat and run. I am out of words to describe my utter dismay at how my situation was handled."
Toni B.,"Trenton, FL",31,33,21,5.0,5/20/2016,Wonderful experience! Used online ordering for lunch to go. Ordered before the restaurant opened and used curbside pick up! Fast and friendly. Enlightened chicken tacos with bistro grains and triple decker sad which with fries were delicious! Will do that again!
C.P. H.,"Gainesville, FL",120,8,,2.0,11/28/2015,"This was a disappointing visit.  My husband attempted to order the Southern Fried Chicken with something other than the red pepper succotash.  We knew this would be tricky, because, in the past, some servers have refused, but others have happily accommodated his request for a different vegetable.  Last night's server, Liana, refused, and offered the option of removing the red peppers and adding a separate side--for an additional charge, of course.  He ended up ordering something completely different (which came with asparagus that was improperly prepared, but that was the least of the night's problems). During the meal, the manager, Joseph, came to speak with us.  He attempted to pass off the succotash as a ""garnish,"" though it is, in reality, a side (2 ounces of anything is far more than a garnish).  Despite continually saying that he wanted to do what he could to make things right, he never really offered any concessions and, in the process of his ""explanation,"" ended up speaking condescendingly.  (One should never say things like ""I'm trying to help you understand"" or ""make this clear to you""--it implies that the customer is not intelligent.)  Joseph's explanation also implies that the kitchen staff is incompetent:  surely it is not difficult to get a ticket that indicates another vegetable be put in place of the succotash.  Given the enormity of BJ's menu, there are certainly alternatives that could be made.  It's clear that this is about laziness on the part of the server (and perhaps the kitchen, although they cannot be faulted for a decision made by the server).   Another aspect of Joseph's failed explanation dealt with ""consistency.""  We agreed that consistency was a problem, because servers on previous visits have made the substitution with no debate.  Perhaps the consistency the management should be striving for is that the servers consistently do what they can to accommodate what are extremely simple requests from customers; that's the kind of service that makes us want to return to a restaurant.  After last night's visit to BJ's, we're now rethinking if it's worth returning, knowing that simply ordering meals could become an ordeal."
Sofia T.,"Miami, FL",1,20,,2.0,6/10/2015,"The Santa Fe egg rolls are very puny, I don't recommend them. Although, I do recommend the brussel sprouts.  I told the waitress exactly how I wanted my drink. Piña colada with Meyers made regularly. Add a shot of 151 on the bottom, and armaretto on the top. Everything was just mixed in.  I ordered a medium rare cheeseburger, which the manager did take off, but they brought out 3 burgers, only two of which I tried and both were well done. Will I return? Doubtful. I can't imagine a decent restaurant like this having a cook wasting product and not being able to properly cook meat."
Matthew D.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,21,2,5.0,2/22/2016,"Great place, good food and lots of seating. The staff is friendly as well. This is our go-to place when we can't decide where to eat haha. They also have their own brewery which is cool. I like their blonde ale. Definitely come check it out."
Michael r.,"Gainesville, FL",0,11,1,2.0,10/19/2015,"My wife and I stopped in for a quick bite on Monday Night.  It wasn't that crowded even with Football.  We were really only looking for dinner (no apps or dessert).  Right from the get go we felt like the forgotten table.  We asked for water to start with (both big water drinkers) and we didn't see that for almost 10 minutes.  I guess the waitress (our Ticket says her name was Meleah) thought we weren't going to be big spenders so she took her sweet time coming around to take our orders.   We got a large salad, The Asian Chopped Salad (I think) and a garlic Chicken Pesto Tavern Flatbread Pizza.  It took over 35 minutes (I calculated because at this point we really were feeling like the ""throwaway"" table) to get a salad and flatbread pizza.  My salad came out without dressing.  The pizza crust was very ""doughy"".  We couldn't pick it up.  No plates were brought out for the pizza and she never once asked to refill our water.   No manager came around to ask how everything was.  We asked for a box to bring home the rest of our pizza (so we could cook it properly in our oven) and got the smallest take home box after, again, a long wait.  The waitress seemed annoyed that we asked for a bigger box to bring our pizza home in as we would've had to stack it on top of each other to bring it home.  Then, of course, we waited and waited for that.  Sad that service has come to that.   If we ever do try BJ's again we'll be sure to ask for a different wait staff.  To be fair, the salad was delicious after I finally got the dressing.  My wife and I said on our way out to each other....""Just another restaurant in Gainesville we won't be going to anymore""."
