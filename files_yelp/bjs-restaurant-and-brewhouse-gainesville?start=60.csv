Anh D.,"Gainesville, FL",27,119,58,3.0,11/1/2015,"I go to BJ's when I'm craving a Cheesecake Factory-esque restaurant, because there is no Cheesecake Factory in Gainesville. The food is just average. I always get asparagus as a side dish, forgetting that the asparagus is kinda awful- it is way too thick and not good at all. The Pie-zookies are pretty good, and so are their drinks. At times, the wait staff is overwhelmed and it takes a while to get your food."
Coty S.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",1904,1448,3683,3.0,4/27/2011,"DJ's reminds me of a cross between Hop's and a sports bar.  The food is just a little bit better than at most sports bars, but the price is jacked up.  They ask your name and how many are in your party, even if you do not have to wait for a table, which is not needed.  Then, you are escorted to your table in a sea of seating dividers, then surrounded by televisions and handed a 20 page menu.  Most of the menu consists of alcohol and you have to check every page to see all of the food they offer.  Like most places, you are expected to order immediately.  So you basically have to have it memorized. Like Hop's they have house made (company made) root beer, but at least it is free refill.  My main attraction was their new small plates menu which ranged from $3.00-$4.00, which was on a photo menu on the table.  We ordered the Mac and Cheese with bacon (bland and runny), the Caprese style salad (delish!) with balsamic reduction, and the Spinach Stuffed Mushroom caps (will pass next time, lacking in texture and flavor). My Mom loves their Grilled Salmon, which is like $17.99 for a small rib of salmon on a plate of mayo smear.  You can get something much better and classier at Bonefish for a dollar less, if you are into these chain style places.  I had the Chinese Chicken Salad with citrus dressing, omitted the fried wontons, it was very filling covered in grilled chicken and actually worth the $10.50 paid for it.  We had to order a Pizooki, it is a mushy dessert cookie in a small pizza style pan with ice cream on top.  It was squishy and expensive.   Still debating if we should give them another try.  I wanted to take more photos, but it seems pointless because there are so many pictures of the food on their website."
Mel B.,"Atlanta, GA",20,41,148,4.0,5/17/2013,"This is definitely a place you go to for an occasion or to have a good, ""real people"" (e.g. not pizza by the slice or greasy tacos) meal. The food is excellent all around! save, the calzones (but who likes those weird things besides Ben Wyatt from Parks and Rec) Stuffed Mushrooms and the Spicy Chicken Parm deserve shout outs They make alot of their own beer and have a very nice selection on draft and tap. I recommend the Florida Orange Blossom Pilsner myself. One thing that will really stand out is how awesome the service is. Seriously, they take it very seriously and they probably have the best waitstaff in town, if that kind of thing really matters to you."
Gloria S.,"Naples, FL",382,817,2362,3.0,6/4/2013,"Bring your coat! Gotta be like a freezer in there. Friendly staff, reminds me of Cheesecake Factory without the efficient, quick service. My daughter said the Gluten free pizza was better than the regular, but get ready to pay out at least $14 for a small one. Lots of choices in menu and drinks for everyone. Big place, lots of TVs to keep your date busy and ignoring you."
Brad K.,"Gainesville, FL",112,747,1703,2.0,3/4/2011,"I have to chime in on BJ's  We've been there about 6 times. Each time was always below average.  We end up asking..why did we come here ?  Yes it's a nice building. They do have a nice after work bar setup.  But the service is always average. They seem to forget about you. A big issue for me is this..I love blue moon..I love an orange slice with my hefeweizen. When I order their hefeweizen style I always get lectured on putting the orange in their beer. I've gotten ""we won't put it in, you'll have to do that, we'll put it on the side""..I've gotten lectured by the waiter that they don't offer that, and when I insist they do is begrudgingly.  Food is the worst part of BJ's. They are either bland, greasy or saltly. Every time we've dined there we have to send something back to the kitchen.  Wish they were better."
Peter P.,"Orlando, FL",0,19,1,2.0,11/30/2014,"I went to BJ's with some work colleagues because, well, it's Gainesville and there isn't much in the way of anything to eat that isn't corporate low-brow. So, I suppose it fits in. Picture a Ruby Fridays or a TGI Tuesdays with more beer selection and you pretty much got it. Service was spotty, forgetful, uninformed. The place smelled like rancid fry oil, which explains the food. The food offered is almost entirely fried, overly-salty redneck food. Our table sampled a good bit of the menu, I had a ""pizza"" with the hope of it not tasting like everything else that went in the fryer that week (the experience with the sampler appetizer gave us a heads-up on that). It was like the puffy, salty, greasy, flavorless pizzas from WaWa. Even the Pepperoni was junk, below Hormel. I hoped the beers would get me through. After realizing they pretty much only had high-volume mega-brewer pee pee (sorry folks Shock Top is junk and it's Coors anyway), I turned to the bottled beer list. Hooray! They listed several domestic and imported farmhouses, saisons, and some sours. The server was pretty confused and pronunciations were a giggle, but one after another, he returned to tell me they were ""out of that one"". After several tries, he came back with a printed list of what they were out of to make it easier on me: it was pretty much their entire decent bottle selection (see uploaded photo). I settled for a special they had on tap, a poor attempt at a pumpkin ale. Horrid. Two stars for being affordable."
Anonymous ..,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",222,292,55,3.0,11/21/2015,"Large, clean restaurant with an extensive menu.  But the service is slow and very disorganized.  It took 15 minutes and 3 tries to get me more salad dressing.  The salad was good but who cares  if everyone else is done eating.  Food was sporadic.   Drinks were upon request.  And dessert came wrong, 3 times.  By the time the check came we were happy to just get put of there.  If the fix the service issues the menu would be worth 4 stars."
Stefan S.,"Gainesville, FL",0,8,,5.0,1/26/2016,"Went there on 1/23. Service was excellent, food was delicious. Didn't have to wait terribly long even tho it was packed. Not the cheapest place, but I think you get a good value for your money. I had a Chicken Club with skinny fries. The sandwich was sooo good, and the fries were perfect. My GF had the Salmon Salad which she loved. I've heard others put down the Salmon, but I've never gotten a bad one here. In fact, nothing I've tried at BJ's has been so-so. Definitely recommend"
Andrew H.,"San Antonio, TX",91,136,92,3.0,2/14/2015,"BJs brews their own beer and has a welcoming atmosphere but expect a wait for your table on a busy night and be sure to check in with the hostess regularly as they are likely to forget about you. Overall I enjoy their menu, it has a kind of ""Cheesecake Factory"" style where they serve everything. I have found the staff to always be friendly and when the forgot about us for an hour the manager apologized and gave us one meal for free."
Tracy G.,"Ocala, FL",2,24,7,3.0,8/17/2015,Went to Sunday lunch with my sister. We always enjoy the ambience and usually enjoy the food. I ordered the jumbalaya and I was disappointed. It wasn't even close to a proper jumbalaya. The chicken had a weird marinade that totally took away from the dish. Some of the rice was undercooked and some was overlooked.
Richard I.,"Chantilly, VA",46,38,,4.0,8/13/2014,"I barely worked here when it first opened up. So if your a current employee and remember me. SUP! and I hope your making good money! ANYWAYS I tasted a majority of the food here and for the most part, its all good. What I like most about BJ's is the wide variety of DRINKS(alcoholic & soft) along with the food. Some of the appetizers are hits and miss. I'd recommend getting the Sampler. Pasta and Pizza are great. Hamburgers are a little above average. Always packed at nights and the weekends. Thats the only downside, so packed you can't even chill at the bar. Reserve ahead of time."
Josh S.,"High Springs, FL",7,84,,2.0,7/25/2014,"I don't understand how BJ's continues to thrive in Gainesville. I don't know what I was thinking during my last review. Granted, it was three years ago. I guess their success is partially because the location is convenient to the mall, NFRMC, and I-75, but so is the building behind Red Lobster, and a business couldn't succeed there if they gave away free food with unlimited government funds. On the other hand, it seems that BJ's will never die, no matter how many things they get wrong. It's not that the food is that bad... the Pizookie is a tasty dessert, and I always enjoy what I'm eating, even if it's not overly thrilling. They also have a decent beer selection (their branded beers aren't great, but aren't terrible), and they have pretty good lunch specials. In fact, the lunch specials are the only reason worth coming anymore. The space is way too big for its own good. To their credit, they don't have unoccupied tables at peak times, leaving customers scratching their heads wondering why they can't sit in the section with fifteen open tables. But it also creates chaos, because they have too few inexperienced servers assigned to too many tables. A ""quick"" meal will invariably take at least an hour, no matter what you order or how much you try to hurry up the ""check please"" process. Also, the food is extremely overpriced. Aside from the aforementioned lunch specials, you will be hard pressed to get out of here for under $15 per person. So, so, so not worth it. I'm annoyed at myself for writing such a long review for a chain restaurant (an updated review, at that!), but one more thing: this is one of the few places I have ever been that will charge you for infant-sized portions of a side dish. I hate to sound so entitled, but if I ask for a thimble of black beans for a baby, at least tell me that you are going to charge me over $4 for it. Might as well just order her an entree and call it a day. $30 for two beers, a margarita, and a baby black beans. Have fun with that."
Brian R.,"Marietta, GA",4,35,,1.0,7/16/2016,"Let me start with the fact that we frequent BJs. I've been going to BJs for 16+ years and usually get decent service at this location. Not sure what happened today...took maybe 10min before our server even got to the table, but we were told by a trainee that our server would be right with us. When the server finally came we were ready to order. We order drinks, chips and salsa, and lunch. My wife ordered her beer with an orange wedge. Drinks came, wife's beer had no orange wedge so I walked up to the bar to get one. Chips and salsa never came so I had to hunt down our server to cancel that as we wanted them before lunch came, wouldn't have thought we had to say that when ordering, got nothing but an OK, no apology or anything. When our pizza came, our daughters fries didn't. We asked the lady how long it would be for the fries, she rudely said 2-3 minutes and so ""pleasantly"" asked us if we wanted her to serve us our pizza, we declined. Our sever checked on us, we mentioned the fries hadnt come yet, she said she would check and again no apology. The fries did come a few minutes later. The entire time we were seated our server checked on us maybe 2 times while the tables around us had her and the trainees undivided attention, very frustrating. We paid and were leaving, I stopped the manager to let him know about our experience. He apologized and asked if there was anything he could do, he did seem sincere, but at that point it was done; just wanted to share our experience with him so he could address it with his staff. So, I thought this was the end of this bad experience. We were out shopping and realized my daughter had lost her security blanket. We didn't recall seeing it while we were shopping so assumed she had left it at the restaurant. I called to see and was informed it wasn't turned in and they couldn't find it where we were sitting, but she took my number and said she would call me if it came up. Luckily we were close by so 15min later I stopped back in to see if they had found it, and it suddenly appeared on he bottom shelf of the hostess stand. Clearly they weren't going to call me to tell me they ""found"" it. Not sure what that was about but pretty sure it had something to do with leaving our server $0 for a tip and me voicing my concerns to the manager. Needless to say we will be avoiding BJs for the foreseeable future, which is unfortunate based on my history of enjoying their pizza and beer."
Skye M.,"Jacksonville Beach, FL",1,3,,4.0,1/13/2016,"Always a go to. Convenient location, but what sets them apart is definitely they're service. Visited yesterday and had the greatest experience with our server, Karen. She was amazing & welcoming as usual!"
Sai ..,"Edison, NJ",1,10,5,4.0,12/22/2014,Super professional guys at the bar and they sure know what they do! I am here on 12/22 & they do know to keep the holiday spirit alive. Surely recommend the place
Leigh R.,"Gainesville, FL",21,13,1,3.0,4/9/2015,"3 stars was given only because the food was actually pretty good. The place is like an upscale tgi Fridays. It's a little over priced.  Now the service; granted me and my husband walked in at about 9:30 pm. But they don't close until 1.  We were not greeted at all, the host grabbed menus and just said ""follow me"". Took about 8 minutes to get a drink even though there were only about 5 other tables in the place. The waiter was nice but my husband asked for an extra side and when it wasn't given the waiter said he didn't hear him say that and it would be an up charge for the side. I'm not a cheap person by any means. But at that point the waiter should have told him not to worry about the up charge since he ""didn't hear him"". If he was writing the order down he might have remembered. (Im just saying) also we simply wanted lemons for our waters but there were none in our glasses but we didn't bother saying anything about that.  We didn't want there to be another up charge......... If it wasn't for me the waiter wouldn't of gotten a tip at all. My husband was far from satisfied. (him and I both having been in the food service industry)"
Antonio R.,"Ocala, FL",0,31,,1.0,4/5/2015,"I've eaten here quite a bit of times because friends really like it, but it's consistently poor.  I ordered the wings as an appetizer and they were cool and soggy.  Reminded me of frozen hot wings cooked in a microwave.  The shrimp was not much better, kind of rubbery.  I've had other items on the menu and they were not much better.  The menu is huge, it would probably be a good idea for them to cut it in half so they can focus on preparing a few things well."
Scott T.,"Germantown, TN",210,214,374,3.0,2/17/2014,The place is very big and has an extensive menu with pizza sandwiches salads barbecue and it kind of goes on and on. It's nice that they have quite a variety of food but not all of it is great that was a group of 12 of us and we tried and shared each other's food it had some flavor it was nice presentation it was hot but it was really nothing outstanding.  If I had a group of friends who really didn't know what they wanted to eat and had no real sense of what all the food was I would probably bring them here because it is a chain restaurant that does a fair job of making a lot of different products for a lot of tastes. I think if they trim the menu by 25% and focused on a couple of great things they would probably do a little better.  The ambience is very loud a lot of music playing I'm busy nights you a lot of people hanging out at the front door or around the hostess station and it's very crowded.  I took some photos but if you go to website they have plenty of photos they've already taken so this real no issue in showing you what we received. Prices are in the $12-$25 range for entrée.
K C.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,16,1,4.0,4/11/2016,The food is yummie. The inside is clean and dimly lit to set the mood for relaxing evening to dinner. I have not ever had a problem with rude servers or bar staff.
Robin W.,"Honolulu, HI",26,178,12,3.0,12/8/2013,"Thanks, BJ's, for your Gluten Free menu! I had the Gluten Free pizza.  It could have been cooked a bit crisper, especially toward the middle of the pie, with a bit less sauce, but the flavor was good. My companions enjoyed the variety of appetizers and drinks.  I did find it strange that one order of fries for our table was fine, but the other were as if the oil wasn't hot when the fries were cooked.  Cooking in cold oil?  Sounds icky to me, so I didn't taste them to find out. Our server was pretty good and kept our glasses full."
