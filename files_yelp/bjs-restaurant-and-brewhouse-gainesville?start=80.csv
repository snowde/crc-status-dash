Pam D.,"Addison, TX",153,619,1091,2.0,3/8/2011,"My friend wanted a burger and a beer to celebrate, and this is where she picked. I was just along for the ride.  We sat ourselves in the bar area and found out BJs was running a happy hour special: most appetizers, flat breads, and mini pizzas were 1/2 off. Draft beers were also $1 off. Thank goodness for that, because even though their beer list is very large and diverse, the prices were about $2 more than I see at most other places. Speaking of beer, none of their brewhouse beers intrigued me. With so many other unique beers on draft, why would I try one of the house beers? Anyways - if you're a beer lover you will definitely find something on the menu to sip on. I ordered a Bell's Oberon, which didn't really taste like a Bell's Oberon, but maybe I just haven't had it in a while. We started with mozzarella sticks (half off) and they tasted like they were straight out of the freezer. In fact, there is no way a restaurant can maintain this large of a menu without utilizing tons of processed and frozen foods, so this big menu was a huge turn-off for me.  I had the sweet pig mini pizza (also half off). It was the perfect size for me for a normal entree- it's about the size of those pizza hut pizzas you can get in the airport. It was okay. The crust was so deep and doughy that it just felt like a big ball of dough instead of a pizza.  My friend had a burger which she customized with added avocado. She loved it, but I thought it looked pretty gross. The patty was much thinner than most other places. Also on her huge burger, she only got one slice of avocado so we had to ask for more.  Service was spotty. Our beers took about 20 minutes to get to our table; they arrived after our appetizer.  I don't live here, but I think there are probably other places in the area to get a good burger and a great beer."
Matthew B.,"Gainesville, FL",10,7,1,3.0,2/17/2015,"The service is great. The food is good. The environment is nice. One thing is,the internet connection is BAD. I ask one of the servers and they said people have complained for TWO YEARS. BJ's come on. DO you know how many people need a place to catch up on emails and grab lunch, drinks, or a snack while. I find this to be to be a lack of effort. Plus, attracting a crowd like myself who works in restaurants sometimes."
Steven H.,"Lake City, FL",13,24,6,4.0,12/13/2014,Love this restaurant. One of my favorites in Gainesville. They make a killer steak and they brew their own Root Beer & Cream Soda
Bill B.,"Lake City, FL",3,40,12,4.0,2/5/2014,Barbecue bison burger very good. Ginger coleslaw was okay but I would not order it again.
John T.,"Gainesville, FL",41,20,,2.0,4/22/2014,"The decor is pleasant and the restaurant is clean and tidy overall. I had one of their chicken pastas.  The pasta was a little on the dry side for my taste.  The grilled chicken was nicely cooked and seasoned.  (The pasta was nicely seasoned as well and did taste good.) I found the service to be slow and inefficient, especially considering the price.  It took nearly half an hour for our food to come out, and at least two of our orders were missing items (not extra requests, mind you, stuff that was part of the menu listing).  I was more than half way through eating my pasta before the garlic bread came. Also, I frequently had to wait for my glass to be refilled though, to be fair to the waitress, their glasses are on the smaller side of medium and, when filled with ice, don't really hold enough for a thirsty person to drink and still have a lot of liquid left over.   Given the combination of price and service, I probably won't eat here again any time in the near future."
Alpha 1.,"Gainesville, FL",0,125,,4.0,3/1/2016,"You must try their chicken lettuce wrap. It is such a refreshing appetizer on a nice day. Their sliders were good too. The BJ Classic pizza was delicious! Though I would prefer the BJ Favorite pizza. The hostess was polite, but the waitress was only acceptable-not the greatest."
Michelle T.,"Brooksville, FL",0,14,9,5.0,1/21/2015,"We stopped on our way back to Tampa. The service, presentation and food was wonderful. Will be back again sooner then later."
Michael S.,"Albany, NY",9,12,1,1.0,11/16/2014,I ordered a deep dish pizza with sauce. I did not get a deep dish pizza at all. I asked the bartender if there was sauce in it and he said yes. I got home and there was no sauce at all in the pizza. I paid $20 for awful cheesy bread.
Joan S.,"Jacksonville, FL",1,9,6,4.0,2/14/2016,The food is ok but our service was among the best I've ever had by Mika!  She was fantastic with our party of 12 with kids and separate checks. She was extremely pleasant and patient and attentive and just downright awesome. Fabulous  employee. The ladies working the hostess stand were amazing too. So calm on a night that was unbelievably hectic!  The busboys were quick and friendly as well.  Just great front of the house service in general!
Hannah M.,"Clearwater, FL",13,46,2,2.0,11/30/2012,"Growing up with real micro breweries I was excited to learn that BJ's was moving to town. Unfortunately, I cannot find one thing that this restaurant has in common with a micro. With outrageous beer prices, beer brought in (not made on site), mediocre food, and bad service BJ's has found a way to take all the great parts of a micro brew restaurant and turn it into a chain dining experience. Skip the chain and head downtown to taste local brews or beers from around the world with delicious food to accompany. I can think of a handful of places that will out do BJ's and save you money at the same time."
Darshan P.,"West Palm Beach, FL",165,142,104,3.0,11/29/2014,Large selections of beers and drink specials.  A lot of food options. Gotta get the Pizookie which is a desert item they are known for.
Jessica B.,"Pensacola, FL",18,32,25,1.0,11/10/2013,"This was my 1st time at this resturant and it was a huge let down. Everything was done in a timely matter [I.e. seating, drinks, and taking our order], except getting our food to our table. The wait was so long that I lost my appetite. All we ordered was a deep dish pizza. The waitor didn't even attempt to keep us informed nor did he even acknowledge the issue. The pizza was meh. I wish I would have ordered the pull pork instead. But the thai style chicken wontons were good. I would have taken a picture of the pizza, but I was too unhappy to do so and all I wanted to do was eat and leave, which was exactly what we did."
Princess A.,"Augusta, GA",35,53,12,3.0,11/16/2014,"It isn't that I didn't care for BJ's, in fact, I had the shrimp tacos and they were pretty delicious. But I found the whole thing completely overwhelming. We accidentally went on a Game Day, which meant we had a 90min wait. Not a big deal, but definitely should have picked up a menu while I was waiting to have time to really look over everything, instead of just thinking I could pick something when we were seated. There are SO many choices for drinks and for food, that I felt like once I had decided on everything I might like to try, I had a usual restaurant's menu in choices. I am sure this means that some of the items suffer because the kitchen can't possibly keep up a high standard on ALL the items on that menu. Consequently I tried to pick something that wouldn't've been sitting in a pot or under a broiler for a long time waiting for someone to order it. I think that has to be the key to ordering here. Pick something they might have to make to order. I had a pear cider, but that doesn't even begin to cover the drink options here. Basically I am going to declare BJ's impossible to accurately review in one trip. If I return here, I'll have to review again and pronounce a better judgement."
Jeannette B.,"Gainesville, FL",77,3,1,3.0,3/10/2013,"I have visited BJ's for a number of years and love their Santa Fe salad, (romaine lettuce, red onions and fire-roasted red peppers tossed with Santa Fe dressing. Topped with jack and cheddar cheeses, sliced avocado, corn, diced tomatoes, crisp tortilla strips and blackened chicken breast) while I have enjoyed the sliders, pizza and other dishes I always find myself going back to the Santa Fe Salad! Their soups are really good, but consistently cold! I have had several times to send them back. Disappointing.  But on your next visit, do try the fab Santa Fe Salad!"
Canova B.,"Gainesville, FL",0,7,,5.0,1/30/2016,"Never had a bad meal at B.J.'s in Gainesville, FL.  The salmon is outstanding!!!  The coffee is fantastic.  Try it!"
Abby M.,"San Diego, CA",10,23,25,3.0,10/5/2013,"My boyfriend and I love beer so we decided to check out BJ's. We enjoyed a variety of great beer and a margarita pizza. It was a great time but our waitress was not attentive to us. We asked her to sit outside and she gave us a half smirk and said ""I mean if you want to, but that's not in my section so I won't make it out there that often to check on you."" First of all, I've worked in the restaurant industry for 5 years, I know she didn't want us to sit outside! Obviously if she would've been more understanding to what we wanted then we would've tipped her 50% of our bill. Instead she made us feel like we shouldn't sit outside because it would inconvenience her. This is why I'm rating 3 stars. I would recommend this place for good beer and food but not service, because even though we sat inside our service still wasn't great."
Bosslady656 S.,"Ocala, FL",0,35,,1.0,1/3/2016,My husband and I went in after shopping at the mall they were rather busy we did get a table however in the lounge the service after that was good except we got our appetizer which was avocado rolls my husband found a big hair in them after that it was downhill we had already ordered a pizza by the time we got the pizza we ate a couple bites and we were thoroughly grossed out The manager did come over to our table because we told the waitress he didn't seem too concerned he wanted us to tell him right away before we got our pizza however my husband didn't tell me until we got our pizza still all in all they did take the appetizer off but whenever you find hair in your food the whole meal should've been comped don't know if we'll go back we don't live in the area anyway but it will be a long time before we go back and if the managers not concerned about that I can only imagine what else is going on in the kitchen
Kurt L.,"North Little Rock, AR",0,18,24,5.0,11/30/2014,We showed up at 430 and had fast service and delicious food. Absolutely no complaints. I checked into their wifi and got a coupon. The food is really good so they can get really busy during peak hours. I would strongly recommend this place. Pizza is great and pizzookies are decadent. California burger is incredible. You can't go wrong.
Colt S.,"Gainesville, FL",1,8,1,4.0,2/2/2015,Great food at a decent price dessert is to die for! There's always a tv in sight with the biggest games on. I would definitely take a date there it's not to noisy to talk and that's rare in a restaurant with a full bar and tvs.
Nicole B.,"Austin, TX",111,362,176,2.0,8/8/2012,"I had never heard of BJ's before coming here a few months ago and was pleasantly surprised with the menu. However, I was here with 3 other friends and they messed up 2 of our orders, after making us wait for about an hour for food. First, they served my pizza with onions, which I had requested be taken off. Now, if there were just a few here and there I would have made do. But the pie was literally overflowing with sautéed onions, which I just am not a fan of. So I politely asked if I could get one without onions and the waitress was very gracious and apologized. My friends and I had already been waiting for SO long for our food at this point (which the waitress kept coming over and apologizing for, so I assume it was the kitchen's fault) that she said ""do you want to just keep that anyway while I have them make you another one?"" and I said ""yes, that's fine, thank you."" I guess she thought my ""that's fine"" meant ""don't make another pizza, this one is fine"" because I never got the 2nd pizza. My friends, also thinking I was about to get a new one, happily enjoyed this free addition to their meal and ate all but one slice of this already small personal pizza. So in total, I had one piece of pizza, stripped of most of the toppings. It was my fault for not saying anything when she came back, but at this point it was nearly 10pm and my friends had eaten their food, so it just wasn't worth it.   The second order mess up came when my friend just never got her food. They served 2 of my friends and me (with the onion pizza), but my 3rd friend never got her food--they hadn't put the order in and she had to wait for them to make hers. The manager gave us a free cookie dessert as an apology, though, which was considerate. Sadly, the dessert (a ""half baked"" red velvet chocolate chip cookie called a Pizookie) was insanely sweet and rich and I did not enjoy it, though my friends did, so a personal preference.   The bit of pizza that I did have was good, though I thought it was overpriced for the portion size. That, combined with the wait time for the food (over an hour, and the place wasn't crowded!) were enough for me to give this 2 stars in good conscience, despite the mishap with the pizza that I would usually brush off as a miscommunication and misunderstanding."
