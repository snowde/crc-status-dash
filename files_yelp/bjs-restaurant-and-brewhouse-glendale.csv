Jack H.,"Los Angeles, CA",756,493,2422,5.0,10/24/2017,I Love BJs...  How you interpret that is up to you...  Hahahaha hahahaha!!!  I'm sure those that have tried it love it as well...  How you interpret THAT is also up to you...  Hahahhahaha
Daren C.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,24,8,1.0,12/18/2017,"Definitely not one of my favorite visits at this BJ's location.  We arrived here at 10:01p (see the attached photo of our parking validation) which means we were in the actual restaurant by 10:05p or so. We sat in the bar area where a server and a manager passed us every 5 minutes or so. After being here for about 20 minutes, someone approached us and asked if we needed menus. We said yes. 10min later someone came back to take our order. Fast forward to another 10min from there and we finally got our drinks. In total, that's 40min from the time we sat down to the time we got our drinks. At one point, the manager walked past and we grabbed his attention in hopes of expediting the experience, but that yielded no positive results. He said he'd have someone ""take care of us"". We still have not received an apology... No discounts are being requested and we don't want anything for free; a simple apology would've been awesome though."
Sara M.,"Atlanta, GA",192,302,59,3.0,11/30/2017,"My dining experience here was a bit of a roller coaster but overall, our sever was such a sweetheart that he brings my rating up a star all on his own.  Here were the hiccups:  1) I understand it was game five of the World Series in which the Dodgers were playing, but they did tell me they could tune one TV on the patio to the Steelers prime time game. Unfortunately, it took them 20-30 minutes to finally get the TV to which they directed us to the right channel. They originally set a different TV to that game to accommodate the other Steeler Nation party on the patio. I wouldn't have minded moving if it hadn't been for the fact that we were seated way before they even showed up. So once they finally tuned the correct TV, they had the other party move to our TV area. 2) We ordered an appetizer sampler platter that came out after our entrees.  3) My steak was raw. Not rare. Raw. And worse, this was a ribeye, so the fat hadn't rendered out. I hate sending food back but I had to in this case. My other gripe regarding this was then being asked if I wanted a new steak or my old one cooked longer. Ehhh I think a new steak should have been the default action. But I just asked for the latter because I'm a chickenshit and didn't want to seem fussy. I guess I deserved the charred piece of meat that was brought back out to me. Now, as I said, our server was a total sweetheart. He handled all of the above-referenced hiccups in a friendly and professional matter. Even when I was starting to get antsy about the football game still not being on.  I'm not sure if they were understaffed (but really, during a Dodgers World Series game??) or just disorganized but this isn't the slam dunk sports-watching joint I was hoping it'd be. The food was mostly fine, though, so I'd be willing to give them another chance."
Tuan V.,"Westminster, CA",0,9,1,3.0,11/10/2017,"-Waiting service was slow to say the least.  I could write more about the attitude, but I'd like to give the benefit of the doubt.  Seems like our waitress had a long day.  The service overall including the second person who waited on our table was very, very slow.  I grew impatient because I put enough money for 1h 45m in the meter, and the whole dining experience was pushing that time limit.  -Food was pretty good.  They got my order wrong, but I kinda enjoyed the order I didn't want.  My girlfriend enjoyed her clam chowder.  The bread bowl was excellent.  Dessert (monkey bread) was excellent and made up for some of staff's shortcomings. If anyone from the establishment is reading this, nobody likes waiting 10-15 minutes for the check to come out, and another 10 minutes to get it back."
Sarni N.,"Los Angeles, CA",1725,40,361,5.0,12/14/2017,"BJ's is always a good place to eat and drink. We come here often. All the servers have been super nice. Food has always been good. Portions were just right - we were able to finish everything without feeling overly full and had room for dessert. And of course, the Pizookie (a soft cookie, baked like a pizza with ice cream on top -- it is sinfully delicious!) They have a good selection of craft beer! They have a great bar area with lots of screens. But overall, its a cool place to eat, watch games, and unwind after work."
Em H.,"Sun Valley, CA",203,386,151,4.0,1/2/2018,"BJ's has really grown on me over the years.  I've come to various occasions at this particular BJ's, and also just for a random lunch or dinner with friends, and I really like it.  The ambiance is pretty chill and modern-ish with their high ceilings and dim-ish lights.  Also, the staff has honestly always been very friendly and efficient, which I really appreciate.  The food is fairly well priced, especially when you add the coupons they send (through email or the mail), the rewards app points/deals, happy hour stuff, etc.  Their pizookie is obviously to die for, and their deep dish pizza is a killerrr.. I prefer this BJ's to the one in Burbank for the ambiance alone, although the one in Burbank has more convenient parking (this one has either street parking on Brand, or the lot behind the restaurant, which is free).  Definitely recommend it if you're in the area or have never been."
Bryan M.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",329,11,,1.0,12/17/2017,"So my review is still the same, only the manager replied to this on yelp saying to reach out to him.  So I did, then a week later shot a follow up email to see why he wanted me to reach out. Still nothing and it's at least been a month. So Point is, just don't eat here, fake service and fake customer service."
Shelia D.,"Glendale, CA",905,193,919,5.0,10/5/2017,"Our waiter was Jonathan and honestly he was fantastic. So happy and positive and very helpful. He told us that they had a promotion going on that offers $4 beers and $3 pazookie. Say wahhhhh?!? Of course we took advantage of that deal, especially since we found out it's for limited time only. I also ordered the Tuscan Tomato Bisque, the Spinach & Artichoke Dip and the Avocado Eggrolls. They all came out so fast and the tomato soup was so delicious. It came in a bread bowl and it was so delicious! I'm not a big eggroll fan big the avocado eggrolls were great. And so was the Artichoke dip.  The only sucky part about this BJs Restaurant is their parking. It is an underground parking structure behind the restraints built for the entire building which includes other businesses and restaurants. But I rather walk a little and have fantasy service and great food than the other way around. Plus we needed the ""exercise"" after all that delicious food. Now to think of it, maybe that's why they designed the parking that way, hmmmmmm?  Anyway, loved our service, loved our food, and can't wait to go back."
Alexa R.,"Granada Hills, CA",517,96,252,2.0,10/12/2017,"Unfortunately I did not have the greatest experience here. I love BJ's but not this location. I am about to go walk out of this restaurant. My friends and I came here for pizookies but Waiting one hour for one pizookie is pretty unfair to me. Our server sounded like she did not want to be there. On top of that, our order was forgotten so we had to wait longer than expected. I also was bummed that they didn't have a happy hour menu with food (at least we didn't receive one).  Plus side: $3 pizookies until 10/15!"
Cyl J.,"Glendale, CA",314,296,736,4.0,7/18/2017,"The food is awesome here, but the service was lacking as usual. My friend and I decided to meet here yesterday for dinner. Parking is right around the corner by Islands and could potentially be free depending how long you stay and if you remember to get your parking validated. It wasn't crowded, so we were given a table right away. We asked the server for a few more minutes, but we didn't get our order in until maybe 10 minutes later and after this family behind us got their order in before us. Our food finally got to our table and I was quite pleased with the Peruvian Quino Bowl with Shrimp that I got. It was a good sized portion and very filling. Our server didn't check up on us often, so it took a while to get a water refill and to put our order of pizookie in for dessert. We eventually got our order in for a white chocolate macadamia pizookie to share and I was excited when it came to our table. It was a warm delicious cookie with two scoops of ice cream on top. BJs just needs to learn how to step up their service, especially when dinner service isn't that busy."
Jessica K.,"Burbank, CA",346,174,292,1.0,4/29/2017,"Jeeeeez no wonder I have never come here before. Well to this location. I decided to go because of the bogo meal deal.. but as soon as we sat down -- regrets. Took about 15 minutes for the waiter to even introduce himself and get our drink orders. Strike 1. Then we start waiting some more.. 30 more minutes go by then finally the food. THAT IS INCORRECT. I said no wontons on my Ahi Tuna Salad and of course the dish has a heaping amount.  They took it back and told me they accidentally brought the wrong one. and yes it looked like it had been sitting there for a while because the greens were wilted and soggy from the dressing.  GAH. It's a $16 salad I need it to be amazing. like really amazing. But no of course BJ's gotta mess it up.  OMGOMG almost forgot- this salad is supposed to have avocado and my salad had a whomping 3 pieces, 3mm in diameter. LOL gotta get technical when you skimp out on my avocado gg. $16 worth of greens basically.....  Plus the waiter was awks and barely checked up on the table. My bf's drink was empty 70% of the meal because it was so difficult finding the waiter to even try to wave him down. Never coming back to this location. So many better choices in the area. REGRATS"
Christopher P.,"Los Angeles, CA",531,53,8,1.0,9/5/2017,"If I could give 0 stars, I would. It has now been 4 months since the incident, and no one has yet to respond. The GM is pretty much useless, even though he comments on customer's reviews."
Ravi R.,"Glendale, CA",0,21,7,3.0,1/5/2018,"BJs has a decent happy hour menu. Pay 1/2 for mini pizzas is a steal. However, I was not pleased with the service. The drinks took forever to refill, the food took a long patient wait to come in. Our server didnt even have a courtesy to say things are delayed. The happy hour was over with our server not even being available for the last 15 min. Might not be a repeat visitor in happy hours."
Darien C.,"Los Angeles, CA",3012,223,141,5.0,8/27/2017,"Finally at my 200th Yelp review!! YAY!! It only seems right to review this BJ's location because the service we received last night was definitely five star worthy!  I usually go to BJ's because I love their pizza and pizookies. I've only been to this particular location once though and it was a few years ago. Yesterday I happened to be in the area because I wanted Porto's. Its literally right down the street from this restaurant and when deciding where to eat for dinner it came down to BJ's. Perfect! I put our party on the waiting list through the BJ's app and we set off in their direction.  One great thing about this restaurant is that there is a big parking garbage literally a few feet away from the entrance. You get two hours free WITH validation from the restaurant. So that makes it pretty convenient. You don't have to worry about circling around looking for parking since there is plenty of space in the parking garage.  So when we entered the restaurant I was actually shocked to see the waiting area empty! On a Saturday night?! It may have something to do with the fact that the Mayweather Vs McGregor fight was on this particular night and BJ's so happened to not be showing it so maybe people opted for the Buffalo wild wings down the street or maybe a bar in the area that was showing the fight. Nonetheless, there was hardly a wait for us.  We did wait for maybe 5 minutes or less but they gave us a nice booth for a party of three so that was pleasant.  We sat down and started looking over the menu. Even though i already knew what I wanted. Our waitress came around and introduced herself, I feel bad I don't remember her name! But she was attentive during our entire visit. She gave a long intro on the restaurant's most popular and most recent additions to the menu.  This particular location offers a child's ""appetizer"" consisting of a side of fresh fruit and I believe it was a garlic knot. Super cute and I'm surprised to see that they are the only location doing this! I've gone to quite a few other locations scattered across SoCal and none of them did this for my son. So I am glad to say that this location definitely has an advantage for this with little ones! It's nice that they added this feature with the kids meals. Now on to our appetizer. We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip. The waitress put in the order quickly and we were pleasantly surprised to see it come out very VERY quickly. However, upon eating it we discovered it had a very liquid texture and the dip was COLD!! We flagged down one of the other waitresses walking around and let her know the situation. She quickly took it back and said they would make a new one for us.  A few minutes passed and our waitress showed up going asking about our appetizer. We confirmed with her it was cold and she apologized right away, mentioning that she brought it to her manager and the cooks were making us a fresh one. Imagine our surprise when the manager, Demetri, came by our table and PERSONALLY apologized for the mishap with our appetizer. He mentioned to us that he suspected there was a step in the cooking process that was skipped.  He was kind enough to take the item off our bill. And even brought the new dish to our table himself. He was very kind to us and made sure our visit was nothing less than five star. Definitely the main reason I think so highly of this location now!  The rest of the visit was great! Our food was good. The service was prompt and I definitely look forward to coming back in the future should we be in the area. Demetri is a wonderful manager and he really does care about the experience his customers receive! Five stars all the way!!"
Cedric C.,"Cerritos, CA",179,68,209,4.0,5/23/2017,"Originally was going to put 3 stars because of the dirty silverware (almost ruined my appetite), but the burger was too godamn good and the service was so kind I'm giving 4 stars! Came here with my coworkers, generously spacious inside, parking structure next door, great location to walk around after or before,  my burger was super delicious. Got the 1610 calorie hickory brisket and bacon burger!!  Hooo, Decided to treat myself out from all the gym workouts and this burger does not disappoint.  Juicy sweet and tangy BBQ sauce, tender smoked brisket, applewood smoked bacon on top, all with melted jack and cheddar cheese, red onions and mayo.   And those fries... I don't know how they do it, but they are so crispy and delicious! I think I need to come back again to eat that burger with some beers next time. :)"
Steve B.,"San Fernando Valley, CA",208,10,4,1.0,11/11/2017,"My wife and I went to BJ's in Glendale and were extremely disappointed!!! Mainly with the food!! We ordered New York steak medium rare and both of our steaks were rare. We also ordered baked potatoes and they ran out. We also ordered asparagus and by the time we got it, it was cold and undercooked. Very disappointing!!! The Manager did apologize and get my wife another steak, but we had to wait about 25-30 minutes to get it. Plus, after all that our Dinner was on the house.         On the plus side, was the waitress was pretty good, and the Manager giving us Dinner in the house, but we were extremely disappointed and won't be returning."
Marine K.,"Glendale, CA",0,3,2,1.0,1/1/2018,"Management of this place is awful. Many simple tasks get misunderstood, had to send order back 3 times just cause I said no broccoli can you believe that! Major shake up is needed for this place. Awful, awful service and wait times to be seated order taken and hopefully one day youll get your meal! Walked straight out no one noticed."
Bruce M.,"Northridge, Los Angeles, CA",212,92,171,2.0,3/9/2017,"Unfortunately, we did not have a great experience here. A group of 12 of us came here for lunch today during our lunch break. Now, we understand that with a group that size, our orders would take some time. However, we ended up waiting over an hour for our food and the restaurant was not overly busy. We ended up having to speak to 2 waitresses and the manager as we couldn't wait around forever. I will say that when the food did arrive, it was delicious. I got the soba noodles with shrimp and while the sauce was a bit too tangy, it was still scrumptious and filling for a meal.  I must also commend the manager who came by and apologized to each one of us, comped or beverages, and decided to cut our bill in half as an apology. While the initial experience was low and I have to grade it on that, the manager ended up bending over backwards to try and accommodate us."
Harry S.,"Glendale, CA",19,48,,1.0,12/14/2017,"Family and I had an utter nightmare dining experience here a month ago. I figured I would let the anger subside so I might approach a review with objectivity over sheer animus and rage. The rage and animus persist. It was that bad.  My 12-year-old insisted on eating here for his birthday. The host assured us we would have heat lamps if we sat outside, or would have to wait an hour to sit inside, even though it was empty. He couldn't explain why.  It was a cold night. Wife, three small kids, and I kept pleading, but the heat lamps did not arrive as promised. Instead, they put one about 10 feet form out table with a dim flame that gave no heat. We were freezing.  To make matters worse, we had a horrible waiter. Neglected the table, got our order wrong four separate times, brought us cold food, and a plate of food that looked like it had fallen on the floor and molded back together by someone with filthy hands.  We decided to leave mid-way through the meal. But, our waiter disappeared. I roamed the restaurant in search of the waiter or manager. Eventually found a manager that was dressed like a slob and completely useless and unapologetic.  We should have just walked out, but waited patiently for the check. When it arrived, it had a series of items we ordered, but which never came. We reminded our waiter these items never arrived and he repeated over and over, ""I will check on it.""' We couldn't wait out in the cold any longer. Paid the full amount, including about $35 of food that never arrived.  There was not one redeeming thing about this place. The food and service were awful. The restroom was filthy. Management was useless.  This now takes first spot for worst dining experience I have EVER had. Sadly, this will be the most memorable part of my kid's birthday.  My contribution today to the world: NEVER EAT HERE. IT IS HORRIBLE. I hope this review saves those reading it from a similar experience."
Elina A.,"Glendale, CA",10,22,12,1.0,10/22/2017,"This review is NOT for our server Kayla... she deserves five stars for her excellent customer service.  This review IS however for management to properly hire and train competent kitchen staff.  You are not preparing your servers for success at your restaurant if you do not have cooks who are preparing meals as they should be. There's only so much customer service   You can provide at some point the quality of the food is just as important if not more. The quality of the food that was served to me tonight with the most disgusting presentation of food I have ever tasted.  After a long and stressful day I decided to stop by for a very late dinner.... Order was simple enough, the Santa Fe salad and requested that the chicken be warmed up, I have this aversion with eating cold chicken. The waitress Kayla did her job, she put in the order and even showed it to my husband and I, ""Santa Fe Salad with fresh grilled hot chicken"" also ordered chicken wings with sauce on the side... food shows up, chicken is ice cold, and wings had sauce smothered.  To the kitchen manager, it is not that difficult to read, the instructions were there, customers make requests because they want to eat food that they enjoy. We don't have $$$ to just throw at some chain restaurant because are feeling generous.  So frustrating to ruin someone's appetite with incompetence. Get your act together retrain your kitchen staff or run the risk of losing customers."
Rose M.,"Northeast Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",19,3,2,4.0,12/5/2017,"We decided to have Dinner at this branch in Glendale..other than the shortage of servers, making for a slow response to diners...we totally enjoyed our order of Pork Chop w/c my hubby & I split...it was so huge, we took a lot of it home...we loved the big bowl of Clam Chowder that accompanied it & savored every spoonful oozing with clams....Best chowder ever- this deserved my stars!!!"
Steve N.,"Roswell, GA",0,1,,1.0,12/31/2017,"Only go here if you enjoy a maddening wait and cold, poorly prepared food. BTW, don't order anchovies on your Cesar salad, they charge for them."
Mj J.,"Los Angeles, CA",407,20,1,1.0,12/12/2017,"The manager, Mr. Fish, replied back to my original post and said to e-mail him which I did. I never received a response back. Very unprofessional and only replied to me on Yelp to appear as if he is taking action. He hasn't. So therefore he is just like the employees he manages. No surprise why this BJ's is a disaster!"
Nicole W.,"Sacramento, CA",1,54,37,3.0,11/13/2017,"Since my expectations on chain restaurants are really low in terms of quality of food, the only thing that saved this place was our waitress. I can't  remeber her name but she was patient and had an energetic positive vibe and provided 5 star service. Why even go then? Because some people in the party were craving BJ desserts, which was ok. Our food came out really slow, good thing we weren't in a hurry. The food was mediocre too."
Nancy D.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,,3.0,12/27/2017,The place was half empty at 5pm on Saturday night. However I was told there is 20 minutes wait. Once I was called the service was fast  The deep dish pizza the crust was not crispy? The dessert chocolate cookies was burned with 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream not worth the price.
Pina P.,"Los Angeles, CA",24,73,32,5.0,10/15/2017,"Parking: I've never had a problem  Food: only had their lobby pizza while I wait for beer but it's pretty good.  BEER: Yes, please. I love all their beer for different reasons. I'm usually a porter girl but lately Jeremiah Red been doing me good."
Bryttni J.,"Los Angeles, CA",131,6,1,1.0,12/23/2017,"Horrible service. Had to flag a waiter after 15 minutes just to get some waters. The waiter was very nice and took our order while he told the waitress in the section we hadn't been helped yet. Apparently she didn't know we were her table? The helpful waiter went on break and we still didn't receive our waters until 25 minutes after being seated. Amanda G. (The waitress) never apologized or explained her lack of service until offering us chips 5 minutes before our food arrived. Still no ""sorry."" Our food was alright, and the manager checked on us and offered us free dessert. We ordered the cookie trio which took another 20-25 minutes to arrive (after we paid our bill, which honestly should have been severely discounted and wasn't.)  Absolutely ridiculous because she still had to take the desserts off the original bill so is there any communication between management and servers? Never again BJ's. Fucking disgrace."
Rip K.,"Los Angeles, CA",31,140,62,5.0,10/20/2017,"I love BJs the restaurant. I hadn't been here in a long time so my friend and I decided to meet here. I honestly don't remember what I ordered but it's must've be good because I'm not complaining  Of course, the service is always exceptional at BJs. We definitely did order the Pzookie, it's still called that right? Haha! Good place, good food, great selection of beer, great selection of food."
Carlos D.,"Glendale, CA",58,3,11,5.0,7/16/2017,The food is always just right. Finding out there's a true local Lager craft beer on tap. Makes this guy hella happy.  It doesn't sit heavy or makes you feel dang full where you can't eat or have another round. It makes you wanna enjoy another round without recking your taste buds.
Malcolm X.,"Central LA, Los Angeles, CA",0,7,,5.0,12/21/2017,I stop by here for a beer and I got to say this was black always a very pleasant experience this is just my first time seriously starting to use Yelp to review places that I like and I dislike now I guess I should be a less biased and that but I am just going to go on by saying that BJ's here was very very clean and the beer was fresh.
Daniel L.,"Torrance, CA",471,134,74,1.0,5/2/2017,ARE YOU KIDDING ME? This place is lucky to even get a tip from me. I came in here and it took forever for the waiter to come and take our order and drinks (14min) got our drinks in (10min) food additional (25-30min) ....with the wrong food!!!! (additional 7min)  The waiter didn't even offer to refill my drink until the end. I didn't want to tip at all. what a joke. I'm definitely not coming to this location ever again. Corporate needs to put this place in check.
Kris J.,"Sylmar, CA",396,228,944,5.0,10/2/2017,"We had a group of 60 on the patio with a reservation. The service was super! It was pretty easy ordering, getting our food and getting drink refills.  I ordered deep dish pizza because you come to BJ's for pizza! We also had the calamari, crispy and delish, and the spinach artichoke dip was yummy. We also ordered 3 types of pizookie at our table.  Cookies and cream, you can't go wrong! Churros, it was very satisfying! Monkeybread, it was like a cinnamon bun with ice cream, drool! Parking was in the same building. We were there about 3 hours and with validation from BJ's it came to $6. Good job BJ's for making our friends bday run so smoothly and for the yummy food!"
Nikki B.,"Glendale, CA",1,66,102,3.0,7/15/2017,"Service: our server was very nice, however, she was clearly in the weeds. Getting refills took a really long time and getting her attention took a while since she was always gone. I would give her 3 stars. Peruvian Quinoa Bowl: tasted good. The only thing I would change is how tart it is. All the textures worked really well and everything was cooked just right. Like I said, there was a tartness to the dish I wish was not so tart.  Churros: AMAZING! Great idea! It's basically a plate full of tiny churros and ice cream on top. The churros were cooked fresh and perfectly crisp. Define a great change from the -sometimes , too sweet, pizzookie! Price: I thought the price was slightly overpriced, but it's what I expected from a chain/ corporate restaurant. However, the food was acceptable, so no major complaints.  I took two stars away because for the price they charge and being a corporate restaurant, I think they should have servers who can actually attend to their guest. Our server, like I said was a nice person, but she was just never around. Although food would have been 4.5/5 stars, service makes a huge impact especially when your family comes to celebrate a birthday and is paying $350+."
Wendy L.,"San Gabriel, CA",376,7,1,1.0,12/13/2017,"Dishonest service from the waiter!! Be aware of how you split the bill. Our bill was $284, so we gave the waiter $275 in cash and told him to put the rest on the card. Well what we got back was a credit card charge of $50, which made no sense. We thought he included the tip as well, but we asked him and he said no. It was extremely sketchy, and we asked him to count it in front us, but he only counted $225. However we were certain we gave him $275, because we counted it beforehand. Be cautious of how you pay at this particular BJ's, either pay the exact amount in cash or put it all on the card. Don't split like we did or else you might get scammed! Never coming to this particular branch again. I can't believe this happened on my sister's birthday!!"
Ed D.,"Pomona, CA",6,121,43,1.0,9/7/2017,Been coming here for a while.Last couple of times service wasn't good.Today it was really bad.Waited too long for the food.Poor quality food and our waiter never came by to check on us . Had to chase someone for our check.And they didn't bring our dessert out but l didn't want to wait any longer so we left.
Gem T.,"North Las Vegas, NV",13,147,218,2.0,9/1/2017,"Food was good, service from Julio and Tara was exceptional but we almost walked out of there before we even got to our table. So, here's my story. We got there at about 7:45 tonight, there was only one lady ahead of us so we waited patiently for our turn.While she was being led by the male host to her table, a couple ladies walked in and stood inline behind us. To our surprise, the blond hostess completely ignored us who were standing directly in front of her and proceeded to ask the ladies behind us how many were in their party. We got her attention and told her we were not with the earlier lady. She proceeded to tell us that the ladies behind us came before us. SERIOUSLY! When we told her we were there before them, she had the nerve to ask the ladies behind us if that was true and they both agreed we were there before them. Instead of apologizing for her mistake, she grudgingly picked up the menus, told us to follow her, stopped at a table and said your waiter will be with you shorty and that was that. I was left perplexed and fuming mad. If we didn't have a starving child, I would have walked out of there. I told our server what happened and she in turn mentioned it to the manager who came and apologized and said he will take care of it.  I appreciate that everyone was very apologetic but she totally ruined our night. I hope that this will serve as a learning experience for this young lady. I love BJ's but we won't be coming back to this location."
Chuck D.,"Los Angeles, CA",654,1172,8489,3.0,8/23/2016,"I was craving a pizookie HEAVY... I havent had one, in literally DECADES. I dont know why but I was on a mission one recent Friday night and I just had to make my way to BJ's to have one. Good thing it closes late because we got there around 9/930pm. The place was busy as you would expect on a Friday night. We waited about 5 minutes before we were seated. We were given one of the elevated big booths which in retrospect didnt make sense, as we passed several open tables for 2 on the way to the booth. Oh well, we went with it.  Since we were on a mission for a pizookie we only ordered a couple of appetizers so we wouldnt get too full to enjoy dessert. We ordered the calamari appetizer that came with tartar sauce and cocktail sauce for dipping. I prefer cocktail sauce when eating calamari but sadly theirs was bland. It really lacked flavor. I didnt know why. The calamari was just ok. It wasnt the worst calamari I had but it certainly wasnt the best. I think the calamari could have been fresher. We also ordered the burger sliders app with crispy french fries. This was tasty as the sliders (2 with cheese; 2 without) were really good even though the burger patties were on the thin side. It was still real tasty though and the bread was good. The crispy french fries were great and went perfect with a little bit of ketchup. I would def order that again. The pizookie was GLORIOUS. It was better than I remembered it to be. We got the OG chocolate chunk with 2 scoops of vanilla bean ice cream on top. It was so good. The cookie still warm and soft went so well with a dollop of that delicious vanilla ice cream. Such a perfect dessert. Definitely needs to be shared by 2-3 people... Craving satisfied. Expectations exceeded. Service was ok. My empty water glass was sitting there for a while. I even put it at the end of the table which is usually the universal sign of ""fill me please"". We had to flag our waiter down to finally fill it. Another complaint I have was we used a Yelp check-in offer for a free pizookie with $10 spent on food. When we orginally got the check, the pizookie was on the bill. We had to remind our waiter about the supposed free pizookie and he made the adjustment to the bill and removed it. Glad he did but it should have been noted from the start that we had a free one that night. Anyway, those are the only things that come to mind service wise. Our waiter was friendly but just not as attentive as we would expect or prefer. Parking is in a pay parking structure. I think they validate."
Samantha F.,"Ontario, CA",80,1,,1.0,12/3/2017,Had a horrible experience here. Decided to sit in the bar area with my date and the server completely ignored us and attended other tables. We waited nearly 15 min to finally get our menu's.  We decided to get up and wait for a different table out side of the bar area to have a different server. When we finally sat down the server had a snotty attitude and wasn't very friendly at all seemed like we were a bother to her.  Won't ever recommend coming here or would ever come here again until they they get better service and better attitude servers.

You will not forgive yourself if you go there and not try these rolls!! I go to this place at least once a month! They have some great pizza combinations but there is a chicken plate with mash potatoes and broccolis that can feed two people easily! Their prices are also fairly good compare to some other places that are as nice and fancy. I'm not a beer person BUT the awesome collection of beer that they offer always make me wanna try some and believe you me!!!! If tastes great with that chicken and mash potato! Plenty of free parking as long as you get your ticket validated at the front desk. There are huge TVs everywhere which you can follow any type of sport you are interested in!"

Super friendly, accommodating and always had us laughing! I took my girls here for my birthday dinner last night and she had the whole table rollin!"
