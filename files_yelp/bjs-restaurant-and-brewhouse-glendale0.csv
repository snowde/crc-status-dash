Mikel Nicolo R.,"Glendale, CA",19,17,4,5.0,4/10/2016,"Alright, this is not a true review, but I have to give props to the BJ's crew! Their generosity really helped out in feeding our LifeTeen youth at Holy Family Catholic Church! Thanks for the salad, pasta, and pizza! Bless! P.S. The pizza was pretty yummy!"
Armen K.,"Glendale, CA",18,19,7,4.0,4/10/2016,"Some great ""go-to's"" for me here are: Spinach artichoke dip, Grilled chicken Alfredo, and the California chicken club."
George E.,"Camarillo, CA",0,3,,2.0,4/21/2017,Service is slow and waiters don't bother to assist you if they are not assigned to our area. Won't come back here again. Valencia has way better service.
Laurie D.,"LAKE VIEW TER, CA",0,4,,1.0,4/20/2017,Went here for sons birthday party of 15   Did not take order for 1 hour did not get good for 1 hr 45 minutes   Will never go back
Tu-Anh N.,"Oakland, CA",918,460,3552,5.0,1/1/2014,"Hands down the best BJ's experience I had!  And I owe I all to Latanya (Tanya).   Her service was over the top stellar and this was on a super busy new year eve night!although she was swamped she had such a positive and enthusiastic energy!   As soon as we sat down she immediately told us she will get to us.  When she did as promised she told us all her recommendations on beer, appetizer, pizza and entree.  It's always nice to hear those. I ordered some water with no ice.  Tanya came back with my water with no ice AND a bowl of lemon wedges, something I forgot to ask!  She also came back with a sampling of soups: clam chowder, tomato bisque, and chicken tortilla.  Sweet! I wanted to have a drink since it was new year eve!  Tanya gave us her recommendations and brought me out 3 samples of beer...woot! Unfortunately I had already planned on a cocktail and decided to get a: WHITE PEACH MARGARITA - $9.25 This drink was very sweet but since it was served over ice in a tall glass, I figure I can take my time on the drink and let the ice dilute it a but.  The sugar rim was nice but unnecessary since the drink was already so sweet.  I appreciated the peach garnish and then noticed more sliced on the bottom!  When I took a bite into though I instantly got a brain freeze, forgetting that this peach slice has been sitting in a pool of ice! Haha!  I ended up not finishing this drink because even about 2 hours my margarita was still too sweet and I was not in a mood for a sugar headache later. We decided to go for the holiday special where we get 2 appetizers (salad or soup), 2 entrees from a selected list, and a pizzookie for $35.  Here's what we chose: HOUSE SALAD it's one of those dishes that will make you feel less guilty when you main entree that is a burger comes out. In reality, this salad holds no nutrients.  Maybe there are some in the shredded carrots, but all this plate hold was lettuce and purple cabbage and ranch sauce...which is quite unhealthy, haha.  Oh there are tomatoes, too.  Yeah don't get a house salad.  Cesar salad is probably no better. TOMATO BASIL BISQUE Because of that soup sampling we had I chose this and it delightful! It was tangy enough, salty enough with that nice sweetness of tomatoes and that richness taste we know from creamy tomato soup! I loved it!  I should have gotten 2 of these instead of that house salad. BALSAMIC-GLAZED CHICKEN Our marinated chicken breast grilled and served over baby field greens, caramelized onions and white cheddar mashed potatoes and drizzled with sweet balsamic glaze. I went straight to the mashed potatoes!  I loved how the white cheddar made it rich an creamy!  It complimented the balsamic glazed chicken so well!  The onions was like the icing on the cake!  I'm not usually a fan of grilled chicken breast because it always comes out dry to me.  But the glaze and mashed potatoes helped.  Oh and the greens was way better than the house salad haha. FRESH ATLANTIC SALMON - Blackened Flavorful fresh salmon fillet either flame-broiled or blackened. Served with rice pilaf and vegetables. Tanya gave us 2 options on how wed like this to be cooked: blackened, New Orleans style with spices but not spicy, or just grilled, which she says is still good.  After elaborately explaining to us how blackened is and that she is from New Orleans, we went with that one! We were so pleased we did!  The fish was amazing!  The butter sauce complimented it well and I love sauces.  The fish was NOT dry and that's a common reason why I never order fish at a western restaurant, but I am glad I did this time! PIZOOKIE - CHOCOLATE CHIP I Requested the vanilla bean ice cream be served on the side instead of on top, that way I can take home the rest of the cookie I don't finish!  The cookie is always perfect to me: warm, GOOEY, and half raw!  Always plenty if chocolate chips!  The ice cream was yummy too but I was too full to finish it. I enjoyed the dinner for the most part but the reason why I am giving my 5 stars was because Tanya!  She made me laugh so much!  She clearly hardworking, enthusiastic, I love how friendly she is and is  so charming!  I've been to various BJs many times and this was my favorite visit! Thank you BJ and big BIG thanks to Tanya!  I am definitely coming back! :)"
Puzant C.,"Los Angeles, CA",214,559,460,2.0,12/15/2014,"2014 YELP 365 CHALLENGE - 251/365 Stopped by for dinner with a friend and I have to say that this was the worst experience I have had at a BJ's restaurant. It wasn't terrible, but it was definitely sub-par compared to the other BJ's i've visited. Firstly, our waiter never came back to ask how the food was or to refill our drinks. And we couldn't even track him down the entire meal to ask for refills. Finally he showed up after everything was done, nice to see you again buddy. That was pretty lame customer service if you ask me. Secondly, our food was just not that good. I tried the new lasagna which didn't look like the photo AT ALL. For the sake of this review, I counted how many sausages were in my lasagna... 3. Absolutely ridiculous. The cheese was pretty tasteless and the tomato sauce was really overwhelming.... pretty much the only thing you could taste. My friend's crusted chicken was reallllly chewy as well. Very underwhelming experience at this BJ's, I definitely won't be back if i'm in the area. There are better options on Brand Blvd."
Aracely P.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,2.0,10/16/2016,"I have been to many BJ restaurants and this is by far the worse.  At first we thought it was our waiter but I think the entire service here is non existing.   My son asked for orange soda the server even explained how it was sweeter than your typical orange soda and we got orange juice. When our food finally came out it was served cold.  The refills that we were supposed to get, came as we were done eating.  Still, we dared to order dessert, we went for the trio pizookie.  He got the flavors wrong AND surprise surprise, the cookie was cold!! Not the normal blazing hot ice cream melting cookie how they are usually served. Terrible never coming here again."
Carlos V.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,3,4.0,10/30/2016,The staff is cool the burgers are bomb and the ambient lighting sets the mood....restrooms though are in need of up keep im very big on good food clean restrooms model. Other than that not bad Bj's
Pedram S.,"Los Angeles, CA",66,5,1,3.0,10/30/2016,"What I realized, dumb people work at front desck and curbside, by the way I been there at noon"
Steve K.,"Los Angeles, CA",65,25,92,4.0,3/6/2016,"We went for the first time, for our anniversary, and we were very satisfied! The food tasted great, and the kids meal (in quality and quantity) was above the other restaurants.  We had the Mahi Salad, Balsomic Chicken, and Baby Back Ribs. They were all tasty. We took our own cake, and they put the cake in the fridge for us, without any charge as some places have.  There were some moments when the waiter didn't come by for a while, but the service was great overall.  We'll definitely come back."
Michelle C.,"Sydney, Australia",0,7,8,3.0,11/24/2014,"Eh. It was good. We were seated quickly, excited by the booths. The menu was concise and easy to understand, the waitress was extremely (slightly overly) attentive.  I got the black and brie burger with wedges. My meal came out a little warm, while another person on the table who got the lasagna said their meal was way too hot. The burger itself was nice enough, nothing special. A little dry, but the bacon was really crispy. I liked the wedges, they were well cooked.  We also got a pizookie, of course. I had the salted caramel pizookie, which was delicious! It did taste a little bit like metal, maybe from the tin.. I'm hoping that's normal. But it was the perfect amount of chewy and crispy outside bits, warm cookie and cold ice-cream. The ghiradelli chocolate was unnecessary, and detracted from the dish slightly.. But it was the highlight of the night :)"
Jessi M.,"San Gabriel, CA",114,10,,3.0,10/9/2016,"I'm giving this location 3 stars solely for the service/ cleanliness. 1. Our table wasn't set up as well as another couples table. 2. One of the waitresses, not the one we had, was very rude to a group sitting near us and her bad attitude was noticeable the whole night. 3. The bathrooms both male and female bathrooms were not clean. My husband said there was water all over the counter with towels sitting on part of the mess and overflowing trash. In the women's bathroom both trash bins were overflowing and one of the toilets had a tampon floating and the seat was covered in water and trash on the floor. Whomever is the manager for this place needs to put order in with the staff and cleanliness and make sure the waiters and waitresses have their manners in at all times. The food is good but with the, un-setup table, rude waitress and dirty bathrooms I think that'll be the last time I go here unless the handle all of the out points."
Adam J.,"Los Angeles, CA",1194,250,291,2.0,10/2/2015,"Mehh. Just barely under average. Service was great. However, the food was what you'd expect. The thin crust pizza was the most disappointing. It was half Hawaiian (they call it something else) and half tomato/basil. The outer crust was nice but anything under the cheese/topping and it was just droopy/saggy/floppy. Just sad! The thick crust pizza was one with a bunch of toppings. Dough was also disappointing. The saving grace was the jambalaya and fries. The jambalaya was only good because it was loaded with chicken/shrimp/sausage. Other than that the flavoring was just okay, as was the rice pilaf under it all. Price is fair and free 2 hour parking with validation! Not exactly sure why we ended up coming here since there are tons of other good options within walking distance. Next time I'll put my foot down (in the other direction) :)"
Em W.,"Simi Valley, CA",1,39,8,2.0,3/8/2017,"Ugh. Super bummed out by the bad service, OK food, and excess of mix-ups. I went with a group to celebrate two birthdays and the service could have been better. First, refills were slow to come, so we sat for most of the time with empty waters and sodas before having to ask for more. Then there was a mix-up with the sandwiches when a friend who ordered no bacon still got some, and then had to ask that the kitchen remake it when they just brought back the same sandwich with the bacon peeled off. Another friend didn't even eat her jambalaya because it was incredibly salty. Then, I tried to arrange with our server to get the free birthday pizookies as a surprise, and for the flavors to correspond to whatever the birthday people picked off the menu. We ended up getting too many pizookies? Rather than just bringing the birthday flavors based on what flavors were ordered, they brought the birthday pizookies PLUS two additional regular pizookies that we had to pay for. Oh well. This wouldn't have been so bad if the restaurant was crowded, but it was lunchtime and there were few tables besides us. You're better off trying a smaller restaurant somewhere else along Brand."
Christina K.,"Glendale, CA",285,6,3,2.0,6/2/2016,"5 stars for food, and 0 for service.  Our waiter, Jason, was very inconsiderate and slow. We come here often for family outing. We are usually understanding about our waiter/waitress having a bad day because we have worked at restaurants for years. I don't even think he was having a bad day because he was rather communicative and friendly with other tables. It started with him forgetting to bring us a diet pepsi. Then, my sister spilled her drink, it definitely made loud enough noise for everyone to hear; however, he was too busy chatting with his co-workers to notice it. Her napkin was completely wet, and he doesn't offer to give her a new one. He did bring her a new drink, though. He never checked to see how we were doing (we were there for an hour and a half) when my brother's 1/4 left diet pepsi looked like iced tea because he needed a refill 25 minutes ago. When we finally asked for a refill, he took 11 minutes to bring him a diet pepsi after we were done eating everything. He brougnt us our check even before we asked for our check or refill for my brother's diet coke. He never smiled when he had no problem laughing with his co workers, he unnecessarily circled the suggested tip amounts, as if my brother didn't know how much to tip. I have never even thought about leaving a complaint review before. We are truly disappointed with this lack of service. We do not know his reason for the lack of service, but this is unacceptable."
Chris G.,"Los Angeles, CA",97,155,26,4.0,1/29/2016,"This is a chain so not much originality. This location has garage that gets validated for 2 hours. Fairly spacious venue near glendale galleria.  The waiter was cool. Kept checking in on us, but not to the point of annoyance.  The venue was pretty clean as well. Food didn't talk too long to arrive. As we were in a party of 4 during lunch time. Would definitely come back if in area. Only neg was the Long Island I order. There's a reason why I order a Long Island, it comes with a punch. The Long Island they made was like a ouch from a 2 year old. Ehh"
Thuyvi M.,"Hayward, CA",713,853,632,4.0,1/19/2015,This review is only for the bar. Came here during happy hour on a Monday. Bartender let me sample the blonde ale on tap. It was super smooth so i got a glass! $3.50 during happy hour. Place is clean and the bartender was super friendly. Minus one star for them still using 2014 glasses lol.
Anna C.,"Northridge, Los Angeles, CA",1,22,7,5.0,2/27/2016,"By far one of the best restaurants in Glendale! I always try to make it here at least twice a week. Guilty!!  Really, the food is great, the drinks are amazing, and the service is excellent.  I always try to catch Armand because he's so awesome. Very hospitable, and knows how to deliver. Seriously, I never have to ask for a refill. Drown meeee! I love it. Lol! And did I say welcome back LA RAMs! Armand is the best, but I'm sure y'all know that already!  Oh and one day I cried that they took my favorite pasta off the menu :( ... Lo and behold, always going above and beyond to help, Mr favorite server to the rescue (Armand) told me about the ""Off menu"" items!! Wala! Favorite dish Cajun pasta is still the amazingness on the plate! Thank you Armand! You're the real MVP! Catch you again!"
Katie L.,"Covina, CA",741,256,638,4.0,1/16/2015,Love their food but service is lacking a bit. Servers need to be more attentive even on non-busy days!!
Alice H.,"Alhambra, CA",54,428,662,4.0,1/7/2015,"Came on Wednesday afternoon. Really quiet. Took advantage of happy hour(4-7). Ordered a couple of beers, the BJ deep dish pizza, the Santa Fe fried spring roll and hot wings appetizers. The rolls were very good! Didn't try the wings, there didn't seem like many pieces... The pizza was very good too! I really wanted to try their peanut butter smore pizookie but we ran out of time... Had to return to work. Wanted a take away box for my pizza but our waiter was out of sight, saw another but she was busy talking to the bartender. Service was ok, food was good, price was only decent due to the happy hour on the beers and appetizers. Will return for that pizookie."
