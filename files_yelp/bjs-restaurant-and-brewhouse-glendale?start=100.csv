Nkechi M.,"Los Angeles, CA",141,51,13,2.0,6/8/2017,"Soooo looks like I'm gonna have to give up eating at BJs. I recently moved to northeast LA so my husband and I visited the Glendale location. We had previous ok experiences at the location in Woodland Hills but even at that location, food quality was declining over time as well as service. I have been coming to BJs for over 10 years but that time is over.  I would have given one star but the waiter was really friendly. I have to give this location 2 stars because the food was just NOT good at all. I would compare it to maybe Applebees or Chilis quality to be honest. I ordered the shrimp penne pasta. When the food got to our table, at first glance I could tell the food was reheated maybe or not prepared fresh but I was hungry so I dug in. I look through the pasta to see how much shrimp is in it and no lie there were literally 5 pieces of shrimp. I wish I took a picture. And not to mention, it tasted like Stouffers. I sent the pasta back and got a baked potato. Nothing else looked appealing on the menu except for the pizza. My husband ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken which it too tasted low quality, and had no flavor. The texture was just off and it was not fresh. The broccoli that came with it tasted like they opened a bag and threw it in a microwave. We also ordered calamari which was really good, thank God. I happened to look at the website while eating and saw a free appetizer deal which of course the waiter didn't mention. I was also able to use my Bjs rewards and for another $10 off. So saved about $25 that night.  In summary, food was garbage. Save your money and go to Chilis because that's the quality you will get."
Ryan S.,"Pasadena, CA",146,423,7,4.0,6/26/2016,"We usually go to the BJ's in Pasadena; however, on 06/26/2016 this was my third visit to the BJ's in Glendale.   We go to this location about three times a year, after the Gay Mens' Chorus of Los Angeles wraps up a concert at the Alex Theater.  They reserve a portion of the restaurant for us, for our official after party. We have had two occasions with good service and one not so much.  However, today (06/26) was really great.   They were well prepared for us today with an appropriate number of servers and the service to at least our table was very good, pleasant and we felt well taken care of.  The restaurant was to capacity with our large group (about 200+) along with the public as well.  A soccer game was going on, and this place was very busy.   I think considering all that was going on, they were well organized for the day.   I have been a BJ's customer for quite a while and will continue to be a customer.  However, I was pleased with the overall experience at the Glendale location today."
Adena M.,"Glendale, CA",72,58,11,5.0,12/3/2016,Amazing food with amazing customer service !!! Love love love their stuffed mushrooms for appetizer.  Very reasonably priced with good food.
Em I.,"Los Angeles, CA",42,40,47,1.0,12/15/2016,"My group of friends and I where craving a pazooki around 10:00 pm, it is now 11:30pm and we still don't have our pazooki. The waiter is soooooo slow and we can barely even catch him to ask him a question or ask for the check. As well as our appetizer had a hair cooked into it. I am so upset and disgusted. The service was slow, the food is taking forever to come out, and after all of this there was a HAIR in my food. The pazooki came out and the order was completely wrong. Never coming here again."
Sarah A.,"Los Angeles, CA",377,2,,1.0,8/2/2017,"The one star is for the manager who helped us out, but if it weren't for him, this place would definitely not get any stars. I've heard service is very slow at this one, but me and a group of 6 came in and gave it a shot. Normally I get the Great White pizza, but this time I wanted wings! We ordered, server was awesome and everything was great.  45 minutes in and we asked about our food and someone comes and hands only 2 of the hamburgers down (4 meals still not there). One is fine, and one is completely cold. Like clearly very old. So we politely asked to get it warmed up or remade and thought it was no problem. About 5 minutes later, the burger that was sent back came out and was COLD AGAIN and my boneless wings came and as per usual, I always use a knife and fork. I know, I'm weird.... but thank God I did. When I cut into it, it was completely RAW. Like not a little raw, I mean it hadn't even touched the fryer - RAW. It looked like it was tossed in batter and coated with sauce and plated, no sign of being cooked whatsoever.  I have never been so shocked at a restaurant. We couldn't believe it! I didn't even think to take a picture as I was just staring at a raw piece of chicken. What's even worse is I thought maybe it was just one of the wings.... but no... EVERY SINGLE piece was raw!!!! We got the manager and he was so shocked, apologetic, and comped the meal and offered something else. But with that, my appetite was shot. The kitchen crew needs to be reprimanded and taught food handling safety.  I will never come back again. I Felt for the poor manager who had to deal with this. He did all he could, but kitchen staff really needs to be fired and rehired."
Lenore B.,"Carson, CA",313,129,548,4.0,6/27/2015,"Came here last night after watching a musical. We parked at the lot behind BJs. We got our ticket validated and didn't have to pay for parking!  I go to a lot of BJs and I really liked the service at this one! (Wait...That doesn't sound right...lol) but yes, our server was Tanya and she was just on it! Very happy and upbeat personality, loved it. Our drinks were never empty and food was quick! We ordered the appetizer combo.. Comes with mozzarella, avocado egg rolls, spring rolls, spinach and artichoke dip! For our entree we all shared a flatbread pizza, the basil pesto chicken, and of course who leave BJs without getting pizookie?! Not I!! I ordered the white choco macadamia nut pizookie, yum yum yum! Overall we just had a pleasant time eating at BJs. If im ever in the area again I will be coming back forsure!"
Menua D.,"Camarillo, CA",52,3,2,5.0,1/28/2017,"I have been to BJ's several times before but never with a big group. My group and I (consisting of 12 people) were celebrating our friends 21 birthday. I had orders the bacon avocado burger, which was phenomenal. It was spicy from the jalapeños but not so much where it over powered the burgers other flavors and the avocado definitely was very complementary to the enhancement of the burger. As for dessert i shared a regular sized pazooki  which was a good combination of soft cookie and ice cream. The only problem I found is because one of our friends order was late to come out because the kitchen forgot about it. But they made sure it was ready within 5 min which shocked me. But overall a good experience with a larger group the service was great. Thanks again Bjs"
Jigs P.,"Mirrormont, WA",0,2,,1.0,11/18/2016,"I'm never coming here again. I came in at 9:20 pm with all of my friends and asked for a table for 8 people. The girl who was there told us that the wait time is around 30 mins and I said okay. 30 minutes have passed and all the people who were ahead of us got all their tables. Most of them were parties of 2 and 3 people so it was understandable that they would get their seats first. A few minutes after, a surge of people came in with parties of 5 and 6. What was surprising is they both got their tables within 15 minutes of getting there and while we were stuck waiting for about an hour already. I talked to the the server and she said the tables are being prepared. I waited a few more minutes then I got back to her. She said the same thing so I gave her 5 more minutes and then we just left around 10:30 pm. We waited about an hour and 10 minutes. I personally think it has a lot to do with how our group looked. We were a group of Chinese speaking exchange students who were in gym clothes because we just got out of the gym. I guess the server thought we weren't much of a priority. This is the last time I'm going to this place. I'll take my money to cheesecake factory instead."
Vern N.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,22,2,1.0,1/11/2017,"I have eaten several times at BJ'S in Glendale, and have always enjoyed the service and the food. I always order their delicious potato skins, and did so again during my visit yesterday. They were good, as usual, but during my trip home I became violently ill with dysentery.  Those potato skins were the only solid food I had eaten all day, so I am sure they were the cause of my illness. I don't know what's going on in BJ's kitchen, but I, as a customer should not be getting sick after eating there. A major turnoff!"
Marlena K.,"Glendale, CA",14,34,,2.0,6/23/2017,Damn I remember why I don't come here anymore. They really need to put a notification on the website that they don't do curbside pick ups after 8pm. It's completely inconvenient picking up from this location on Fridays / weekends. Thankfully they at least validate for your efforts.
Curtis T.,"North Hollywood, CA",2,21,2,2.0,5/6/2017,"I really like B. J.'s food, and this location is no different. However, I have never been to this location without having some sort of problem. We ate there tonight, and we had another problem. I ordered the spicy pig pizza, which is always good. However, when it FINALLY arrive (about forty minutes after I placed the order) the pizza was not even slightly warm. I'm not exaggerating. There was NO warmth to the pizza, not even in the center. I don't know how long it had sat out, but the pizza was stone-cold. I started to just eat it...after all, there are worse things in life than cold pizza. For whatever reason, I decided to complain (which is not something I normally do. I could count on one hand the number of times I've sent food back to the kitchen). Once I finally got the server's attention, he carried the pizza back to the kitchen and ran it through the oven again. When he brought the pizza back, the edges and bottom were burned...and the pizza was only lukewarm.  He offered to have a new pizza made, but by this time the rest of my party had finished their entrees. I just ate what I could, and left. It wasn't fair to expect my date to sit there waiting for another pizza to cook.  I probably wouldn't be making a big deal about this if it was the first time it has happened to me there. People can, and do, screw up. Since I can remember at least four times something similar has happened in the last two years decided to say something about it.  The kitchen really needs to learn how to time their food preparation."
Brigette B.,"Orlando, FL",0,12,33,3.0,7/13/2017,"Food was fine but the service was not. Waited at least ten minutes after we were finished eating to receive the check. The server brought the wrong salad to our table, and when told it was not correct, the server argued with us that we were wrong. Will not return. So many others good restaurants in Glendale to eat."
MARS G.,"Los Angeles, CA",19,10,1,1.0,1/8/2017,"It's been 2 years since my last visit to BJ's in Glendale. It was the spot  to watch  Sunday football . But, the place has dropped in service simnifically.  Short on staff.  It took me 10 minutes to get service and 5 minutes to get  my drink.   Dirty tables everywhere . The manager Dimitri is absent . To add insult to injury . Everyone I'd asked for service . They'd replied I'm Off  for the day .   Poor customer service.        I don't recommend this place.  I would Give no stars if I had the option"
Crystal K.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,7,,2.0,2/14/2017,"We were seated pretty quickly so I was pleased with that. But the waitress with the brown hair and blonde streak in her hair was horrible! No customer service whatsoever.  We were sat at a booth and the waitress would literally drop off everything at the edge of the table. We ordered a medium pizza and she didn't bother to ask if we wanted any extra seasoning.. We had to stop her every time for something that was common sense. She didn't even bring us plates for our pizza until we complained about it.  When we tried to get her attention for the check another waiter heard us but she didnt.  Even the random waiter that walked by and made a corny remark about how the cheese stringing from the pizza looks just like the commercial had better customer service than she did.  If anything, he deserved her tip!"
Talia A.,"Anaheim, CA",0,2,,3.0,7/7/2017,Service was VERY slow even though we got here before dinner time. Took almost 10 minutes to bring out refills. Food was decent for the price. Love this restaurant chain just not this specific location.
Gayaneh A.,"Glendale, CA",229,161,190,5.0,3/22/2017,"I love Bj's. We used to almost every weekend during college - Westwood and Burbank. Now, with this restaurant in Glendale, I love it. We have gone numerous times. Their menu is great, their kid options are good too. I love their service. Expect to wait on weekends. There is plenty of seating so it goes by quickly if you need to wait. The salmon, avocado egg rolls, starter salad and of course the pizookie are all highly recommended. I prefer Bj's over Cheescake any day."
Elina T.,"Glendale, CA",0,51,66,5.0,12/30/2016,I don't know how this place has 3 starts. I have been here numerous times and the food has been amazing every time. Service is good most of the time. This review is based on my recent two visits here... Last time I got their spicy peanut chicken with sobs noodles without the chicken and asked for extra broccoli. I can't describe the taste of this but it's so different from what I've tried before and it tasted delicious. My boyfriend got the jambalaya but with noodles and he said that was amazing. Two weeks ago when I came here I got their ahi tuna salad and I gotta say this and the Santa Fey salad are the best salads I tried here.
Heidi G.,"Glendale, CA",0,14,4,1.0,10/2/2017,Horrible staff and restaurant! Avoid this location at all costs! Mistake after mistake due too short staff. They need to hire more waiters and SEATING HOSTS!!! I waited forever after repeated my name like 3 times because she just couldn't get it down right. I witnessed at least 5 people complain while waiting because it was all out of order. The food was just undercooked and watery. I waited for my coke refill for about 20 mins. I was just very disappointed and my dinner and Sunday night was ruined.
Barclay W.,"Saint Paul, MN",354,900,4,2.0,4/12/2016,"I have a love hate with BJ's restaurant. The nice part about BJ's is that, much like every other big chain restaurant, the food is fairly consistent wherever you go. No matter where you are you know what to expect from the food at BJ's.  That isn't to say the food is amazing. The food is what you would also expect of a large chain. Good, but not as great. Their menu is too large to ensure that they can produce every meal at the highest quality. Still the quality isn't bad and you always know what you are going to get from them. In that sense I kind of love this place because when I am in doubt I know I can grab something decent here.  What I HATE about this place is the service. The service at this location is a joke, both for takeout and dine in. I've done many takeout orders from here because my work is right above here, so it is a favorite lunch meeting spot. Almost consistently I know that there won't be anyone at the to go counter to help me. I've waited 5+ minutes for someone to come out and help me. Other waiters and the host(ess) have seen me waiting and do not say anything. There is also a good chance that the food won't be ready or the order will be wrong somehow. It does not reflect well on me when I am late with the lunch because they couldn't get their service together.  When I have eaten here for lunch the service has been just as bad. This place is basically empty when I've come for lunch, yet the service moves as though they are slammed. This place is right below where I work, so it is quick to get here. Still it can take over an hour to eat and leave because the service is just that bad. Thankfully there is a way to pay with their app now, so you don't have to wait the 15 minutes for your server to get your check.  I know I'll keep coming back while I'm here because this place is convenient and the food is passable. For anyone looking for a quick bite, there is much better and faster options around.  33/100"
Bryan A.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,29,253,4.0,1/11/2017,Good resteraunt. Great location. Large drink menus. Came here for lunch. Food was good. It came out fairly quickly. The pizzas here are a house favorite. They offer a Chicago style Deep dish that is one of a kind. The Burgers I ordered was huge and cooked just as I ordered it. The calamari was breaded just right. Definitely would come here again.
