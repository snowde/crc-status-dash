Jo S.,"Beverly Hills, CA",6,16,9,5.0,6/23/2016,"Good place with a good funny and cool staff ! The thick pizza was terribly good, it was my first pizza like this one but it was awsome I will always take it if I 'll go there again!!!! And for the dessert it was CHOCOLATE & MACADAMIA NUTS PIZOOKIE !  That was so bomb i really enjoyed it"
J. C.,"Los Angeles, CA",32,13,3,2.0,6/5/2017,"Do not go to this restaurant if you have very hungry kids in your party! Slow service, just like last time.  We were a party of 9, a mixture of kids and adults, going out for dinner after a show at the Alex Theater down the street. There was no one at the hostess station when we came in. We stood around for long enough that one person was walking into the dining room to get someone's (anyone's!) attention.  When the hostess did make her way over she was not particularly friendly. The wait for a table was reasonable but the service left much to be desired. Our server was friendly but it took a ridiculous amount time to get our meal. Even the grown ups were getting hangry. There didn't seem to be any sense of urgency, just one mumbled apology for the delay.  One of the desserts was wrong and the server assured us the correct one would be out in ""2 minutes."" Well, the correct one didn't come out until everyone had finished and we had already paid the bill. The correct dessert arrived literally one minute before we stood up to leave. Poor kid barely got to take a bite. Want a quick bite pre or post theater? Go somewhere else!"
Denise S.,"La Crescenta-Montrose, CA",141,6,4,5.0,6/18/2017,Awesome service Alex!! She was prompt and accurate with our order with such a positive attitude on such a busy day!
Arman D.,"North Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",0,4,1,1.0,10/8/2017,I wish i could've gave this place 0 stars. the service there was awful. i won't recommend anyone to go there if u dont like waiting 20 minutes for your check or if u want something from the waitress. I will never go back to that place again. They gave our food without fork so we had to wait another 20 minutes for the fork.
Larry H.,"Los Angeles, CA",119,352,32,1.0,3/1/2015,"Well, BJ's changed their cut of meat for their steaks last year and it was a positive change.  However, something has changed terribly.  I had the bone in New York steak and it was utterly gross!!!  Overcooked mess and tasteless.  I have attached pictures.   I even told our waiter ahead of time to make sure he speaks to the cooks to make sure they properly cook the meat as BJ's really has a hard time being consistent in their Steaks QC.  Needless to say it was a complete mess.   Tough as leather and it tasted like the previous versions of meat.  I truly appreciate my food as I try to do nothing but made to order and when you get something that is totally the opposite, it truly ruins your day.  Lastly, the salad was specifically asked for extra tomatoes and extra cucumbers with no croutons.  Guess what came, just lettuce.  What the heck!?  The CEO of BJ's needs to do an undercover boss as the hit and miss of the inconsistency of the food is the only consistent part of this experience."
Lianna N.,"Santa Barbara, CA",577,72,488,4.0,2/26/2017,"Reasonable prices, fast and friendly service, great portions, good variety, and overall atmosphere."
Harry A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,16,,1.0,9/30/2017,"You know something's wrong when u walk into a restaurant that's 80% empty and they still make u wait for 15 + minutes without an explanation. Yes u guessed it, we walked out."
Kory J.,"Lancaster, CA",3,3,1,5.0,12/17/2016,It was 930 when we arrived me my wife and 2 kids under 3yo. We were seated in 20 minutes. Melanie U was our server she was great very nice and attentive. She made good suggestions and checked frequrntly. Kept the drinks fresh. The food was deliciouse and service great.  Grear job melanie U
Chris W.,"Alexandria, VA",62,8,,5.0,6/18/2017,We just had a wonderful meal and a great experience at BJ's. I has the prime rib and everything was wonderful. My wife had tacos and really loved those too.  Our server (Hunter) was great and made us feel really welcome.  He did a great job taking care of us even though we could see he was very busy. It is Father's Day so the place was really busy.  We will definitely eat here again this week.
Meri K.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,4.0,9/27/2017,"They have the best veggie pasta, their food is great in general, and customer service is a plus. Drinks are always made well and they are careful with coming up to check up on you. Love this place"
Cathy M.,"Los Angeles, CA",37,9,2,5.0,5/7/2017,Julio Julio! Is the best server I have ever had! He was on top of everything even if he was busy! He literally knew what we wanted and got it for us right away! My last visit was horrible because we waited for someone to greet us for 20min and nothin but Julio greeted us right after we sat down and took out order LOVED IT
Michael R.,"Pasadena, CA",0,5,,1.0,9/21/2017,"I just endured one of the worse experiences from a restaurant. I met a friend for lunch and the service was slow and riddled with mistakes. I had to leave to get back to work, after an hour, without finishing meal. Afterwards, my friend told me we were charged for food we didn't order. I spoke with manager & never got rerun call. Obviously, they either are incompetent or don't care. Neither is acceptable."
Katy R.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,17,,1.0,12/13/2015,"So how come when a server who has to leave for the day, asks the check be transferred or closed out, I chose to close out so I can tip both servers accordingly, I get the worst service... actually none... afterwards?  Is it because the last server got a bad tip?  (Note: 20%)  Or is it because the next server doesn't think I'll keep ordering more and so will not get a tip? Either way dont you you think I should at least get service?"
Laura B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,55,11,5.0,1/15/2017,JULIO is the best server!!! He's hilarious and provides such fast service. Came here after a long day of work with the coworkers and he totally made our day with his great attitude! Definitely coming back for such stellar service
Jacklyn T.,"TUJUNGA, CA",263,13,,5.0,9/1/2017,"I went there after a long last few days of work and being a server myself, my expectations for other servers is different. Our server was great, our drinks were never empty, our table was constantly bussed, and she was just super friendly and helped us relax. I will definitely be going again."
Dana T.,"Burbank, CA",81,6,1,1.0,5/23/2017,"Dont go there late at night after a show. Poor service. The appetizer ordered was so bad. The server said he knew the kitchen was bad, had it removed from our bill so we could leave and get some real food worth money."
Ange B.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,7,,1.0,5/8/2017,"Bad customer service given by manager that works on Sundays at this location, went in with family for dinner and on one of their brochure it says if you download our app you will either get $5 off or $10 off on order more then $35 so i downloaded the app knowing that for sure our bill would be way more than that, so when the bill was given to us i showed the coupon i had for $10 off and the waiter being really nice said sure let me apply it and after few seconds a manager comes back he said may i take a look at the coupon you have so i showed it to him and he came up with oh that's not from our app its a different app when it clearly says $10 off coupon BJ's mobile app and he said no we can give it to you this is not our app, very very bad customer service given by a manager who should know better or should be trained better on how to treat his customers i don't know his name i didn't ask and he did not introduce himself i asked him if he was the manager and he said yes he works on Sundays and this was around 8;00 pm pacific time, as a manager he could of handled it in a much professional way"
Kelly M.,"Burbank, Los Angeles, CA",112,9,,2.0,3/5/2017,"Our server was great, but the food didn't come out correctly. She had them fix the problem, but got charged for the fix, I work in restaurants and I've never had a guest pay for the plate being re-made correctly. Then they double charged my card and my friends card, can't get ahold of a manager to try to fix the double charges. Not sure I would recommend this location, I've never had any issues at other locations like I'm having at this one. Hopefully I will be able to eventually get ahold of someone who will be able to refund the second charge they did. Not a thrilled customer."
Honest T.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,14,,3.0,9/7/2017,You know what you're getting when you come here. I'm not a fan of their pizza. When I was in high school and didn't know any better I thought this was the epitome of epic food...lol silly child! I still red their pizookies but everything else is like what you get at a food chain.
Katie P.,"West Covina, CA",52,46,13,2.0,9/8/2016,"5 STARS  for our server, not the rest of the staff. I came in around 5pm on a Tuesday. The place was empty. I wanted happy hour so the host said to seat myself. So I did, it took 29 mins for someone to come. I could see the bartender in a deep conversation with a female employee flirting away.  Our server was a sweet Burnette, that just started her shift.....thank goodness! My pizza took 45 minutes to come out, when it finally came it was very doughy and very cold, 1 star. 5 STARS for the beer too, my hubby was a happy camper. Potato skins are 5 STARS."
