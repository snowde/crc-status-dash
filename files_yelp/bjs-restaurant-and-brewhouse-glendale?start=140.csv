Moises A.,"Northeast Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",0,25,13,1.0,4/5/2017,"I have came here on several occasions, due to work and meetings. And I have always received bad service. The cooks have incorrectly cooked my food several times. I'm never coming here again."
Alex N.,"Glendale, CA",6,43,1,1.0,12/28/2016,"I've been to the Glendale BJs several times already, since they opened for the first time, up till last night.  First time I went there, it was so unorganized as I noticed it was employed by a lot of high school kids (at least it appeared to be). Food wasn't as consistent or delicious as the one in Burbank, the one I used to visit before the Glendale one opened.  Many years later, things haven't changed.  It's still super unorganized and I probably will drive to Burbank to continue to eat at BJs, even though I live in Glendale. Last night, my wife and friend came to the Glendale BJs and ordered the Xmas special (with shrimp, ribeye, cesar salad and tortilla soup), balsamic chicken, and the late night burger.   The cesar salad and soup came out 20 minutes AFTER we ordered it.  The waitress (i forgot what her name is but she was very friendly) said the soup ran out and they had to make a new  batch.  But when my appetizers arrived, the soup wasn't even warm..it was almost cold! The balsamic chicken was super dry and tough and we really needed to knife at it to break it up.  The burger was ordered medium and came well done.  It took 15 more minutes until after we finished our meal to get our pizookie, which the cookie came super hard and the metal round dish it came in was almost cold as well.  The cookie so so hard that it broke in pieces when we dug in it, instead of being able to use a spoon and grab it like butter.  They were trying to deliver other pizookies and food to us that we did not order, or already had, so we saw how disorganized they are.  We overheard another party complain about how long their food took as well and they complained to the general manager.   This was unacceptable service and the only good thing about the dinner was the waitress who was friendly throughout the night.  I will continue to go to the Burbank one as this branch has not changed since my bad first experience."
Crystal M.,"Henderson, NV",210,260,371,3.0,9/10/2015,"I've got mixed feelings about BJ's. I've only had one experience and it was today's visit.  I honestly never expected to eat here but I made a new acquaintance in the neighborhood and she suggested going here.  The service here is kind of strange. I don't want to say it was bad because my server offered advice and suggested the happy hour menu which saves us both money.  We moved to the bar to take advantage of the reduced pricing. At that point it got weird because he didn't give us a happy hour menu. He returned to see what I wanted and I asked what the heck was on the menu. He said he didn't have  one but could tell me. How do you NOT have the menu. Weird. He showed me the beers that are discounted but that was of no use to me. I had already ordered a lemonade. I thought, why did I move over to the bar?  So with the minimal info he gave I got the pepperoni flat bread and bbq wings. The food was great. This the 3 stars. But, why didn't we get any napkins or silverware? So he came by to see how we were doing and I asked for napkins and utensils. He returned with a stack of tiny, square bar napkins. It was like I was at a food truck. Unexpected for a restaurant I had never visited.  Anyway, I'll probably return and just skip the bar."
Carol J.,"La Crescenta-Montrose, CA",263,3,,4.0,8/18/2017,I loved my experience at this place. I've been here plenty of times but Kelly helped my family and I out soooo much. He was polite he made us laugh and he was so respectful. Very pleased with my experience
Darylynn D.,"Los Angeles, CA",132,1705,7771,4.0,9/12/2014,"I haven't been to BJ's in a long time and I forgot how I really enjoy the food.  They're known for their beers, deep dish pizzas, and pizooke but really whatever else I've gotten I've always enjoyed.  My favorite pizooke is the White Chocolate Macadamia and the new Salted Caramel.  =)  The servers are always pleasant and the food always comes out in a timely manner.  I have no complaints from BJ's."
Valerie G.,"Malibu, CA",0,5,8,5.0,6/25/2017,karlton has the best customer service. he filled my drink before it was even empty!!! thank you for the best service. my  boyfriend and i  will be back for you
Mitz S.,"Los Angeles, CA",45,61,22,2.0,5/6/2016,"The service is okay, my waitress messed up on my order but hey it happens... She was a sweetheart tho. BUT The food is TERRIBLE I'm sorry, I tried to like this place but it's so gross. This place tastes like theme park food and it's extremely greasy and within minutes of consuming my pulled pork sandwich I got the worst stomachache. I usually love chain restaurants but I will never eat at another Bjs.  It's low quality food for expensive prices. Do not eat here."
Natalie M.,"Glendale, Los Angeles, CA",0,4,,5.0,3/19/2017,Service was excellent we were a large party and the waiter definitely kept up with checking in on if we needed anything and was also glade he kept the drink refills coming had the shrimp pita tacos the portion looks small (well to me cause I'm a fat kid when it comes to my food) but it was actually very filling with a lot of great flavors didn't get dessert but everything else was great definitely wouldn't mind coming back
Vahagn D.,"Van Nuys, Los Angeles, CA",60,15,1,1.0,4/22/2017,"This shit was bullshit. We waited for a long ass time to get our food then when we finally did she forgot the forks and napkins and we had to wait another 20 minutes to get forks and napkins.  She kept forgetting everything bro. It took a long ass time to get anything we requested. We ordered a pazooki and waited 35 minutes for it and when we asked when it will be ready they said ""it's coming out right now""but we waited another 15 minutes. Ridiculous af Gordon Ramsey would be pissed at this service bruh."
Sofi S.,"Glendale, CA",43,12,,5.0,11/8/2016,"Just a 5 star for their soup in bread, that is my favorite, I always go there to eat that soup. Try you won't regret... The place overall isn't bad, prices are very affordable."
TC K.,"Glendale, CA",85,5,1,1.0,9/30/2017,"Omg, we are from Chicago and moved here 5 years ago. Masa Of Echo Park has the recipe from our best deep dish pizza from Chicago. It's the best you'll ever have. That being said, we had a taste for deep dish and wanted something closer. We new it wouldn't be close to what we are use to, but expected some kind of decent from here. We just picked up our deep dish. We ate it because we were starving. It was unbelievably sad. It reminded me of my Grammer schools pizza. My husband and I literally said that Little Caesars is better. What a joke? I'm so pissed that we paid $16 for 8 inches of dough. It was just a thick piece of dough with what seemed like a bit of cheese and absolutely no sauce. Thank god I asked for tomatos, mushrooms and olive or there would be nothing but dough. Truly crap. They should be embarrassed to put that out. I'm embarrassed for them. My husband picked it up curb side and had to talk to three different people just to get it. Also, when I ordered it over the phone, the girl repeated everything I asked to other people because she couldn't answer my questions, including asking a co-worker if she spelled tomatos right..  yes, I could hear her ask. I asked if they have more cheese than sauce so I could know wether to ask for more sauce, she had no clue what I was asking of her. Omg.. never again. What a joke. End of my rant. BJ'S At Your Own Risk."
fufu f.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,33,,2.0,8/8/2016,"Was here the other night. Second time visiting this location. I thought BJ's used to be good. Pretty sure I enjoyed one location I've visited. The food was comparable to like Applebee's or TGI Fridays. Not too memorable.  Ordered the mini pizza and it reminded me of the pizza from skateland back in 1975. It tasted like they used half a hamburger bun and tossed some toppings on it, and put it under the broiler. When the wife tastes one of their beers and says it tastes watered down, you know there is a problem. Heck, she drinks blue moon. Three house beers, a mini pizza, and a burger was $50 with tip. OUCH! My suggestion, stick to their guest beers and eat at in-n-out. Two stars because ""I think"" I have enjoyed some of their other locations. I do believe prices have raised significantly though."
Steven J.,"Vineyard, Glendale, CA",4,4,,1.0,3/27/2017,"This was a very disappointing experience. My fiance had calamari and it was served cold. I had a bacon avocado burger it and the fries were cold. I have gotten a beer meal at Denny's. The only thing colder than the food was the service. I asked for tobacco to sprinkle on my ketchup and fries, she was so slow I was finished by the time she brought it out. We will not be going back and I would not recommend this place to me enemy. It was a terrible experience! This place does not rate a star.  UT since I have to give it so thing I give it one star. SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
Alisha Angelina Belladonna L.,"Glendale, CA",122,14,3,5.0,7/4/2016,"It's the 4th of July, only 3 servers and over 20 tables...... Julio L. is on it! He truly is a shinning star. TEAM JULIO L."
Amy C.,"Glendale, CA",0,4,,5.0,2/15/2017,"Considering how rare it is to run across employees that make you feel like they genuinely care about your experience, it was a great pleasure to have Christine as our server! She greeted us with a warm smile and walked us through the whole menu. She was also kind enough to bring us the validation we forgot at the table  The hosts were also incredible and introduced us to the bjs rewards program! This restaurant has a great staff and is a real money saver!!! I definitely will be back soon"
Rochelle A.,"Los Angeles, CA",420,98,302,4.0,9/14/2015,"This is the go to spot for late happy hour in Glendale. I always sit in the bar area and the bar servers are great although it may take a while to get greeted. A guy named Joseph is one of the main bar servers in the evening. He's very personable and delivers great service. The only problem is that the bar area could get really busy at times so the servers may not get to you right away. The other evening a friend and I ordered the trio of mini pizookies. They turned out delicious but the cookie to ice cream ratio was 50/50! The ice cream scoops were so big that the cookies were cooling down too quick and getting hard. It still tasted delicious because we devoured it before the cookies got too hard, but only ate half of the ice cream. I'll stick to the regular sized pizookies from now on."
John B.,"Glendale, CA",0,13,,1.0,8/12/2017,"Came here to grab some lunch after shopping at the Americana. The place was pretty empty, but they still made us wait about 20 minutes because .  They finally seated us in 2 booths because it was going to be another 20 minutes for a table for 8. (kids in 1, adults in another). The waitress was curt and seemed annoyed by us because we ordered a grilled cheese and then cancelled (she hadn't even left the table btw). She brought our appetizers with the meal even though we specifically asked her to bring them before. The cauliflower was horrible (overlooked and way too much tumeric), the Mac & cheese had no cheese and the flatbread was too salty. We only sent back the cauliflower bcoz it was really inedible. The manager came up to us to see how we were doing. We politely told him our grievances and he acknowledged them but did not even buy us dessert.  At the end of the meal, she asked us if we wanted 2 separate checks (remember they sat us in 2 separate booths side by side - 4 of our kids ranging from ages 9-13- were together and 4 adults in the other booth). I thought she was joking and I pointed at the little 9 year old boy and said ""it's on him today!"" Sure enough, she brings us 2 separate checks and hands 1 to the 9 year old boy! I was flabbergasted and could not believe she didn't realize we were joking!  Anyways it is what it is. Next time I go there, I'll be only ordering a simple pizza and hope this airhead of a waitress doesn't serve me again!"
Geronimo Carlo R.,"San Francisco, CA",835,64,70,3.0,6/29/2016,"I remember when I would frequent BJ's back in high school. Pazookies were the ish. This time I came for my nephew's 14th birthday, reliving the teenage days. I don't miss the food from here at all. Service was 4/5. Our Server Julio was very kind and amiable. Made jokes about what we could call him: Pedro, Paco, Juan. Super accommodating when we thought the calamari was lacking in volume, so he gave us extra for free!  Food calamari: pretty good. fried food, how can you possibly get this wrong. Nice and crispy.  mozzarella sticks: cheesy and nicely spiced. underwhelming though and can't justify it's price tag for damn cheese sticks. portobello strips: delicious and crispy. of course nowhere as good as Bottega Louie's but I'd definitely order this again. chicken lettuce wraps: garbage. I wouldn't eat this again. it's the white man's version of chinese lettuce wraps with large, nasty chunks of chicken breast. strange, strange mix-ins like celery and wasabi dressing. far from a culinary feat.  However, they looked like they had some awesome happy hours! would definitely come back for that."
George C.,"Los Angeles, CA",110,1,,1.0,11/2/2016,"Got a deep dish pizza last night and was extra disappointed. BJ's Deep dish is not deep it just has a really thick high crust. The pizza is 80% crust and the rest is sad cheap toppings that are the same as pizza hut. A restaurant from Chicago should have at least passable deep dish pizza not a crappy rip off. However, the reason I am writing this review is because I have been throwing up all day and the pizza was all I had last night. First time eating at BJs, just writing this review to let people know that they should be careful before eating at this location."
Kyle D.,"Glendale, CA",253,9,7,5.0,4/26/2016,"I've literally been to this exact BJ's location more than 20 times, but tonight I was graced with a server by the name of Tanya! I got two words for Tanya: YAS QUEEN! She was so energetic and friendly... If you ever go here ask to be in her section lol. Oh, and she brought us this FREE GARLIC BREAD (which I've never been offered before) and it was to die for! Even left us with a to go box of MORE FREE GARLIC BREAD"
