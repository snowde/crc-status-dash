Jay G.,"Glendale, CA",15,6,1,5.0,1/26/2017,"The bartender, James, is the best ever! Has a variety of custom drinks that you can't get made anywhere else. I will come back here only for the ""James Manhattan"", best drink ever! Best service and great personality. Thank you James! Also, Achara is the BEST waitress! Always taking care of us when we come by, always polite, professional, and very caring! We're never disappointed when I come to BJ's! We'll be back again Achara :)"
Tiffany T.,"Monterey Park, CA",288,220,152,5.0,12/20/2016,"I don't come to this location as often as I live in Monterey Park, but today we came after dinner for pizookies! The server was very nice and polite and our pizookies were hot and delicious. We didn't tip much because we only got dessert."
Tamara K.,"Glendale, CA",153,85,17,3.0,5/20/2016,"I usually enjoy BJ's, but my experience on Tuesday was just ""okay"".  Sadly, the service wasn't the issue, as our waiter was great but it was the food.  I ordered the boneless wings, and they arrived cold, as did the other foods that our group ordered. I'm not sure if this was because we were a large group, but hot entrees should be served hot, not cold."
David K.,"Long Beach, CA",327,27,12,1.0,11/1/2017,"If only yelp would let you give negative stars! First I love BJs pumpkin ale beer. I know it sells out fast, so that's why I called and asked if they had any. I was told yes we do. I asked again and said are you sure I know it sells out fast. Again I'm told yes we do. So I drive a long ways to come here sit down the server comes over and we order our drinks. 1 pumpkin ale beer 1 soda and 2 waters. 5 mins later server comes back tells me we are all out of pumpkin beer. I said I called I was told you did that's why I came here. We went ahead with our order 3 appetites and 2 meals. 15 mins we get 1 appetizer we ask about the others and told coming out now. 10 more mins nothing! We asked 3 different times about our food plus trying to get silverware and our waters we've yet to get. After 45 mins and getting only 1 appetizer and 1 soda we give up. I tell the server we are tired of waiting for nothing I just want to pay for my 1 appetizer and go. That took another 10 mins to do. I even sent there HQ an email and nothing. I'll never go to BJs again!!!"
Jeanny K.,"Baldwin Park, CA",11,81,188,2.0,11/19/2016,"Decided to try BJs for the first time...my husband experience BJs before. Well the wait time is great...not bad at all. However our waitress, Pamela C. is nice. But nice does not help if not attentive. For one we waited soOoo long for out food. Our salads and appetizers came fast but after slowly eating our salads and appetizer. ...we was still waiting for our food for a long time. By the time we received the food it was warm where it already cooled down. We ordered the holiday favorite pick which is the 14oz ribeye steak...supposedly its marbled steak...i do t think so...i know my steak. Marbled steak is not suppose to be very chewy. My ahi tuna had an after taste. Sigh* i really hated our food including the kids food. The deep dish pizza was terrible...thick dough with thin layered of sauce with very little chees...hamburger wasnt a hamburger. ..it was 2 mini sliders with hand made patties...so small!"
Shannon M.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,3,,3.0,8/2/2017,The food is defintelb 5 starts! But the customer service is horrible. came in on Tuesday for pazookies and the waitress got mad My friends and I only ordered desert! She was very rude and the food took forever
Ray B.,"Glendale, CA",67,85,44,1.0,3/25/2016,"Based on the replied message from the restaurant, you can tell that they don't even read the reviews before responding. It's irrelevant."
Jaddis H.,"Los Angeles, CA",973,299,362,4.0,5/26/2014,"I've honestly never had a disappointing experience at Glendale's BJ's. I've tried a variety of their dishes and was satisfied with all of them. From pastas to burgers, they're absolutely scrumptious! Their pizzas of course, are a must try- ask the server for recommendations Service is always top notch. My favorite is Brennan! He's always full of life and happy to make us happy Their dessert? My absolutely favorite part! Their pizookie is to die for! I daydream about that platter of goodness :) Although red velvet is gone(?) they added salted caramel which is a fair replacement."
Jenifer N.,"Santa Clarita, CA",57,161,286,5.0,11/17/2015,This Bj's is great. The only my thing I would have to complain about is parking but there is plenty to choose from in the structures. I participated in happy hour which is 3-7p during the week and 10p-close Saturday and Sunday. Half off mini pizzas and $1 off alcohol.  At the time of my visit they had the limited edition Grand Cru beer which is fabulous and a monkey bread pazookie- to die for! All thumbs up!
Giri M.,"Fairfax, VA",97,9,2,3.0,7/30/2017,Food was okay. Been here for lunch a couple of times. Their lunch specials are definitely worth a shot.
Andrew D.,"Glendale, CA",0,17,,5.0,7/6/2016,"This review is long overdue.  I've been coming here with my GF for years now.  In this time I have developed a huge liking for David Sauerwald.  He is by far one of the best servers I've ever encountered, and I always ask for him.  At a very close 2nd place (if not 1st place also), is Latanya.  She is an excellent server.  These are my go-to people. They are both very-very courteous, they care about you and your order, they want to be sure your experience is the best, they make sure your order is cooked properly, and the list goes on. I love the food here. I get the sirloin and my GF gets the ribs and then we share our plates in this carnivorous shmorgazborg.  Sometimes we're in the mood for pizza and get that.  Of course a pitcher of their finest craft is standard on our table (Their Harvest Heff).  It's the only beer we get in a pitcher because firstly it's a delicious beer, and secondly, it's the only way I can get my girl to drink with me.  We both leave there feeling great about our meal, our drinks, and our service.  It keeps me coming back every time.  Thanks David and Latanya for everything that you do, and keep up the great work!"
Patrick P.,"Los Angeles, CA",122,7,19,1.0,7/27/2015,"WAITED FOR OUR ORDERS FOR ALMOST 30 MINUTES. We finished our drinks before the food.  The Scampi is fine, but I really hate their ribs. It's the worst Ribs I'd ever had. So dry, lack of flavor and a rip off! Wouldn't recommend it."
Elizabeth T.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,1,5.0,2/3/2017,"So I went here today for lunch and I first of all want to thank my waiter. He was super awesome I didn't get his name so bad part about that. For appetizers we ordered best beginnings and always in love with it, everything was pretty fresh and could see that the oil they're cooking with is clean. Then I ordered the BBQ burger and wow soooo good made everything about the meal awesome!!! I always come here so no doubt that I'll ever stop coming here."
Matt T.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,12,1,2.0,6/3/2017,"Cool.  After reading the other reviews, I'm glad to see I'm not the only one that thinks the service here is rude and slow.  For a large chain restaurant, I'd expect them to be a bit more competent at handling a Friday night that, to be honest, wasn't even that crowded.  My son and I came in for a dessert out of convenience, and because I wasn't spending big money I felt like I was basically ignored.  I wasn't expecting VIP service, but it literally  took 30 minutes after ordering to get a scoop of ice cream and a cookie.  I finally had to ask about it after watching others who came in after me getting served actual drinks and meals.  Then, when it was all said and done, the waitress brought the check and disappeared.  Fast forward 15 minutes later, and she was yet to return.  I had to track down a totally different server to find her so she could charge me, and then she was nothing but attitude, throwing the check on table, grunting, and 180ing herself away.  Honestly, I feel pretty safe in saying she is the second rudest server I've ever encountered.  If you wish to work in the service industry, then drop the attitude and serve.  Otherwise do something that compliments your skill set......might I recommend becoming a meter maid, perhaps."
B. A.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,54,5,4.0,4/24/2016,"Usually I have pretty good service from the wait staff here and the food is also very good for a chain restaurant. Another thing that is terrific about them is their contributions to charitable organizations. One thing that is always, always disappointing is the hostess / host  in the front. Either they are not there, or if they are it seems like they are sleepwalking.  When we came in yesterday we asked: ""What can you tell us about your brunch?""  Her response was: ""Breakfast ends at one."" That was it that was all she had to say.  Did not answer the question I asked and also did not seem to care.   Since there was some confusion (because the website indicated that they serve breakfast until 2 PM) the manager kindly offered to let us order from the breakfast menu.   Again, the waiter was extremely nice. But then the kitchen got the order wrong!  Waiter was apologetic but did not offer to fix, and manager never came back to the table to see how our visit was. So this visit was not a highlight of our experience here. Although most of the time it has been very good.  Please BJ's hire people at the front who seem to care about their jobs! After all, they are the face of your business."
Nellie W.,"Los Angeles, CA",79,235,162,2.0,10/4/2016,"Visited after a failed night and this location made it worse. Everything we ordered came out wrong except for our ribs and pizookie. We had no silverware. Salad came out with the wrong dressing then when it finally came out with the right dressing, it came out 3 minutes before our main course came...I ordered my steak well-done but came to the table in a puddle of blood...Ok???? My boyfriend ordered an Alabama Sunset but he got a Strawberry Mojito instead.... I was like really? Can you guys get anything right? I will pass on this location."
Jorge M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,8,6,2.0,1/24/2017,"The food is always good here they have lots of variety & as we know they are legendary for there pazookie. However down side, our waiter Thomas G, some tall white slender man looking moron, least attentive waiter in the world, not once did he come & ask if we needed a refill. That's just amongst his many short comings as a waiter, he's spend 80% of the time I'd been here talking by the bar. Though I recommend Bj's restaurants, I'll ask to be moved if he's ever my waiter again."
Harry D.,"Glendale, CA",145,188,23,4.0,8/25/2015,"The food is okay, nothing special. Good place for families with children as the place is loud.  Strangely we waited 10 minutes to be seated when I could clearly see at least 10 open tables. No one else was waiting to be seated.... The bazookee is a must!!!"
Tee D.,"Glendale, CA",104,10,46,3.0,10/22/2015,The service is absolutely terrible!  Family dinner for 10 with prior reservations and we waited forever for our beverages and food and even had to stop waiters whizzing by to get them to get our server.    My dad ordered a steak and had to use catsup because the waitress didn't come back to ask if we needed anything else.... Like steak sauce!!!  The salad was very tasty but poor service overshadowed the feast.    We're going to dinner elsewhere as a family and not here ever again.
Firetruck M.,"Los Angeles, CA",148,226,,4.0,8/23/2016,Great place for lunch. They have pretty decent lunch specials for around $10 that'll fill you up. And you can get loaded then go back to work and do something stupid while drunk and get fired. Perfect for if you hate your job and want to get fired then go pursue your TRUE passion.
