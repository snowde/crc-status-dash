Vanessa L.,"San Diego, CA",109,98,165,5.0,4/19/2016,"Exactly what you expect from a BJs! Service was great, food was yum! I left my iPhone on the table when I left and a staff member ran after me to return it."
Paulette V.,"Los Angeles, CA",11,1,42,5.0,5/20/2016,Went for a beerEnded up having the Classic Rib eye with clam chowder !! Loved it !! Our Server Ricky  was Great and very knowledgeable !!! Everything he recommend was spot on .  Great time ...
Tanee M.,"Woodland Hills, CA",25,12,1,5.0,5/5/2016,"Thank you to Julio for making this the best dining experience I have had EVER!!! You were so attentive, kind, and on top of all the needs of me and everyone at our table.  Whoever is running this BJ's, please know what an incredible staff member you have on your team. He's a gem!!!"
Brandy S.,"Lake Balboa, CA",40,45,25,4.0,3/13/2015,Great lunch today! Upping their rating by one star because I tried two new dishes and they were really good. the Maui glazed center-cut pork chop with red potatoes and green beans. Deeeeeelish! My friend had the lemon-thyme chicken and I tried some and it was also yummy!!
Annie T.,"Central LA, Los Angeles, CA",0,9,1,1.0,5/22/2017,"Wow... coming here with my fiancé was the biggest regret of my life. We walked in and were told that it would be a 10 min wait but it turned out to be 30. Once we got seated, no waiter approached for 20 mins. We were so mad we left looking for a manager to complain. Worst place ever. I wish I got the servers name she clearly needs to learn how to do her job right."
Adis Z.,"Burbank, CA",2,20,11,5.0,11/18/2016,"Today I got late lunch with my kids in this restaurant which was not my first time but today's service was mor than excellent. On my receipt says DANIEL M was just perfect. Such a nice server, polite,helpful in one word excellent. I love BJ's. Thank you Daniel"
Marissa M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,2.0,12/22/2016,"Was at this location last Saturday. Service was great. ( the only reason I'm leaving 2 stars) What gets me is the fact that my boyfriend and I both ordered a $23 ribeye, and were not given steak knives. How am I supposed to cut through a fatty ribeye without a steak knife?? Apparently, they have 3 steak knives  for the whole restaurant??? No wonder the bar was completely empty at 9pm on the Saturday before Christmas! Management doesn't seem to care about their guests is what I gathered from that. I still can't believe we spent over $100 dollars after tip. Get it together Glendale BJs.  I should also mention the disgusting state of the restrooms. No toilet paper in any of the stalls, paper towels and other debris all over the restroom floors. Makes you wonder what the kitchen looks like.....  I am not one to complain while I'm out, but this still bothered me days later which is why I am leaving the review."
Samantha M.,"Glendale, CA",60,23,20,5.0,4/10/2016,I always have a positive experience when going here! Friendly staff and delicious food. They also sponsored an event for us consisting of 150 teens (not including the adults!) and the food they provided was more than enough! Many people even got seconds. Thank you BJ's for your generosity!
Betty A.,"Huntington Beach, CA",23,3,,1.0,12/16/2016,The service was poor . My drink was  not refilled .Our group met at noon . We got our food at 1 hour and 50 minutes later . Definitely will not hold our Christmas lunch here again
Edd S.,"Glendale, CA",0,49,6,2.0,6/18/2017,"Man oh man, talk about waiting just to get an appetizer on the table. Usually the service is okay, but in game days when it gets a little busy, this is by far the slowest place I have ever been to. Every now and then I go to watch a sporting event here with friends, and every time it gets worse. Went in, ordered chips and guacamole as an app, and it literally took them 1 hour and 15 minutes to bring it out. On top of that, the food we had ordered was completely cold and digesting by the time it got to our table. I asked the waitress what he reason was and she said we wanted to bring it all out at once. Luckily, the manager is a nice guy and did a good job of helping us out and getting some fresh food on the table. Only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because the manager was great, other than that horrible service."
Geghard A.,"Granada Hills, CA",1,5,,5.0,5/25/2016,"Seriously enjoyed our meal at BJ's today! The beer battered Asperger and Root beer glazed wings are winners, please don't ever take them off the menu! Brittney was so polite and professional, she is an incredible server. We noticed how busy she was yet she managed to check in with us consistently with a smile, made sure we enjoyed our food and had enough drinks. We hope to see her again next time we come in. We will be coming back soon!"
Nicholas W.,"Las Vegas, NV",169,226,195,4.0,1/5/2015,"I like this particular BJs Restaurant.  Sure it is very busy and very loud every time I come here, but it kind of adds to the experience for me.  The Food at this location doesn't disappoint.  The service is dicey, but I'll give them a pass because they are very nice people. Beer:  The Red Ale they have here is very good, I also enjoy the hefeweizen they offer on tap.  BUT... The absolute best tasting (and high potent) beer I have ever enjoyed in my life is the winter seasonal beer they offer ""Grand Cru"", simple excellent.  I refer to it as the ""Nectar of the Gods"", it is similar to Chimay but without the bitterness, and it has a sweet aftertaste. Pizza:  I love the sweet pig, one of my favorite Hawaiian style pizzas.  Got to go deep dish."
Melanie D.,"Los Angeles, CA",306,946,1535,3.0,2/7/2014,"This is a casual place for food and drinks.  Nothing really special food wise but portions are large and filling.  They make a handful of brews, light and dark, and have a decent beer list overall.  For those who prefer cider and things on the sweeter side, their berry cider is delicious! Happy hour is M-F from 3-7PM. The bar area is expansive.  Overall, prices are reasonable.  I think this location is better than Burbank for service. parking - metered or free 90 minute garage /residential street parking"
Justin L.,"Ontario, CA",0,1,,1.0,5/20/2017,The shittiest dinner I have had the service was horrible took an hr to get out bill. No trying from the servers. I would rather have eaten at McDonald's
Ed A.,"Sunland, CA",38,52,,3.0,2/17/2016,"Foods always pretty good. A little pricey. The service is usually average at best, but there are times where they are all over you.  The half flatbread pizza and salaad is really good for lunch"
Jamie C.,"Los Angeles, CA",707,289,679,4.0,12/15/2015,"this is a great place to watch a sports game, have a birthday dinner, date night, or any type or celebration. it is a dark atmosphere with indoor and outdoor seating. there is a sports bar and plenty of televisions to watch games. there is a parking structure where you get i think 90 minutes or two hours free with a parking validation from bj's or you can park in the mall and walk over! if it's your birthday, you get  a free pazookie and they will sing to you haha. the food is pretty good. i like the avocado spring rolls, pizzas, and pazookie. i also like the parmesan crusted chicken! definitely a good place to go to for celebrations and big groups."
Sevak F.,"Tujunga, CA",42,3,6,1.0,12/4/2016,I working in resturant abute 7 years .i try bjs for first time yestrday i cant believe that resturant w\ amazing decoration and really nice place for hang out w\ friends and family if you wana find place in down town Glendale.but i wana talking about food quality i gave theme one star because pizza waz frozen and like reheat and teast like pizza pan baby back rib like from 2 days ago and stubid salad for 9 dollars 80$ only for food thats idiot....i dont wana see that resturann no more
Jillian A.,"Glendale, CA",62,79,33,2.0,1/5/2015,"Ok. They get two stars because i liked the eggroll app, though my boyfriend said it was alright (this coming from the human vacuum that inhales food). The service has gone pretty far downhill here though.  I ordered the Cajun pasta. The garlic bread that came with it was hard enough to hit someone over the head with and knock them out, the pasta was not spicy and honestly it was bland and undercooked.  My boyfriend ordered the maji maji which was dry and overcooked on top of a bed of mushy rice.  Best of all was their membership which the waiter kept shamelessly pushing on us... he even left it on our table for the entire meal once we voiced having no interest in it. Honestly even if tge Neal were prepared correctly the membership cards and pamphlets would have ruined the experience. Slow claps for BJs. Not making this mistake again.  A $50 meal should be better."
Astgik A.,"Glendale, CA",105,58,85,4.0,1/14/2015,"They have great food, it lacks in quality though at times. Due to poor time management by staff iIt takes a while to get your old food whether they are busy or not, and that is why the food is cold or doesn't seem well cooked. The tabbouleh for the middle eastern tacos is HORRIBLE, but regular tacks are good, but not very filling. Drink always seem to taste like water, especially alcoholic beverages. Best advice, just go easy on the ice.  The pazookie a are amazing, and I just love it."
Elise L.,"Huntington Beach, CA",2,16,3,5.0,10/26/2016,"I had dinner last night, 10/25/2016 at around 9PM. The food is pretty good and came in a timely manner, our server was also fine. The reason why I'm giving 5 stars is because I was searching for the restroom when a kind server tried to help me find the way. While helping me, he accidentally dropped his plates because I distracted him but he was so nice about it and tried to make me not feel as guilty. I still feel bad about but that guy was so nice. I never got his name, but thank you to that guy! He was genuinely very nice and made me feel better about myself. I don't know if he'll ever read this, but thank you for being so nice!!"
