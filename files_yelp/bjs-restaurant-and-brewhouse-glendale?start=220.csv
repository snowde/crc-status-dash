Christina M.,"Desert Hot Springs, CA",0,48,17,5.0,6/23/2016,"Our server, can't remember his name.. But he was African American with dred locks, he was an amazing server!! We felt so comfortable, he gave us good food suggestions.. And even when he accidentally messed up our order his apology felt so sincere that we where not mad at all. Our experience here wil definantly bring us back in the future!"
Abel T.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,14,5,2.0,5/25/2016,"Well... it used to be good. Went there about a week ago and boy was it underwhelming. The drinks were solid and they have a great selection of beers. The service mmmmm not so great. The waiter wasn't very attentive, he got our drink orders mixed up as well as our food orders... not sure who to blame there, the waiter or the cook, just little things were off, oh and the food was kinda cold, mainly our burgers. At least they didn't charge us for one of the burgers. I'll probably never go back unless it's just for beers and drinks."
Kiki C.,"Glendale, CA",133,56,30,1.0,7/27/2015,"If I could give negative stars, I would. This is not just a review on less than subpar service, but also a case of prejudice.  The hostess, Karina, (if that's even her name), sat us down as soon as we entered and began to hand us our menus. I was shocked to see that she couldn't even pass me my menu because she was so absorbed in staring at my friend, a Muslim woman wearing her traditional hijab, nothing special. It was incredibly obvious, and Karina knew it. I was clearly sitting there waiting to receive my menu, watching her demeanor.  Our server, Corinth G (goes by Coco), came over about 5 minutes after being seated and asked for our drink orders.  10 minutes to receive waters.  Another 15 minutes and she takes our orders. We ordered two MINI pizookies.  About 20 minutes later, TWO servers (both young women, one a tall caucasian and the another a short Filipina) came out to bring two MINI pizookies. I have never seen TWO servers waste their time to carry out two small bread plates.  No nearby tables needed two servers to deliver dinner meals, something was clearly off.  This prejudice was so apparent, nobody else was getting treated the way we were. Seconds after we received our pizookies, Corinth placed the check on our table. SECONDS LATER. We didn't even begin to eat. As she was walking away with her back turned towards us, we hear a ""no rush"".  As we were leaving, I was asking the hostess what her name was and she chuckled. She clearly and connivingly chuckled, smiled, and said ""Karina"". I have never felt so disrespected by not just one, but FOUR workers.  Last time I will EVER be returning to this BJ's."
Richard K.,"East Bay, CA",465,404,3711,2.0,1/15/2013,"I normally like BJ's such as the former Chicago Bulls player BJ Armstrong, the music of Bon Jovi and sometimes Billy Joel depending on my mood, and of course the real reason why all guys ""get up"" in the morning.  Sadly, unlike the ""awesome BJs"" mentioned above, I can't say that I like BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse because every time I go to their chain restaurants I get the same shitty service. It appears that BJ's has a universal policy for ""suckage"" and it's obvious that they must not share tips because none of the waiting staff look out for one another. I mean why is it ""so hard"" to get some damn water? I really wish they had those buttons that Korean restaurants have because having to flag someone down for water while ""choking"" on pizza is not fun.  Also, I don't like how Happy Hour (HH) at BJ's only applies to the bar area and not the regular booths and tables. ""Deep inside"" I wished that we had gone to Yardhouse instead because at least at Yardhouse, HH extends to the entire restaurant and they have a much better beer selection with a more professional staff that actually knows what the hell the beer they are serving tastes like. For example, when we were seated at our booth I asked our server what the guest tap Magic Hat tasted like since there was no flavor profile summary on the menu. This was met by ummm let me just get you a sample instead of any attempt at a description. When I did taste the sample, Magic Hat reminded me of nasty ass cough syrup. Thank god I settled for Bear Republic's Racer 5 IPA ($6-something).  Food-wise the wife and I ended up ordering the avocado eggroll thing and a medium-sized chicken bacon pizza. The avocado egg roll ($10- something) was ""way too thick"" because it consisted of a blend of avocados and cream cheese that was so heavy that it felt like it was getting stuck ""deep in the back of my throat"". The chicken bacon ranch pizza ($20- something) consisted of chicken with bacon, cheese, red onions, diced tomatoes, and ""globs of white stuff"" that I believed to be ranch that looked nothing like the picture on the menu. Taste-wise it was okay, but it was nothing ""orgasmic"". In fact, I think that for the price, the new handmade pan pizzas at Domino's taste lightyears better for a fraction of the cost. I hate restaurants where plates are not washed properly like the plates that were brought to our table, since finding other people's particles (OPP) of food on plates is disgusting. Also, it's exasperating when I need to look specifically for my server to get a glass of water because other servers are not in charge of our booth. And lastly, I especially get irked when it becomes an ordeal just to pay and get the fuck out.  In the end it's obvious that the BJ in BJ's must stand for Bad Job because their food and service quite frankly ""blows"". That could be why there is always someone training someone because of the high turnover. And I guess I'm not down with ""OPP""! Oh yea, and despite the 2-hour free validated parking, the parking structure has blind turns and it doesn't help that it's filled with speeding assholes.   -------------------- Pictures: Avocado Egg Roll Chicken Bacon Ranch Pizza -------------------- * There is a purpose to the words in ""quotations"" in my review, after all I am reviewing ""BJ's""."
Bryan N.,"Arcadia, CA",245,419,94,2.0,11/29/2015,"The pizza wasn't good at all, prob one of the worst I've ever had. I wasn't very impressed with this restaurant. The wings were decent and the service behind the bar was great, other than that I probably wouldn't come back unless it was for drinks and I was in the area. I'm glad I didn't have to wait for a seat like the rest of the line."
David B.,"Calabasas, CA",0,382,14,1.0,9/18/2016,"I came to this location again and I was once again so disappointed! We got sat without silverware.  The server took forever to come and greet herself,  my food came out wrong TWICE, and no one came to check on us. We had to get up from the table to ask to order a pizooki. Btw, the silverwear had dried food on it.  Im sorry Roy, but this was worse than the first time."
Alyssa V.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,14,,1.0,9/18/2016,So I was there tonight with a party of 19...I'm 9 months pregnant and still serving at my restaurant and I would just like to say the service here is just HORRIBLE!! Our server was Corinth. For one it should not take 20 min for a server to come and take your order without checking on you or offering bread which I saw other servers doing. Also we did not get the 2 glasses of ice we asked for until we asked for the check. We will not be returning! And apparently I was to receive a gift card for this horrible service but the manager is just as forgetful as the server
Helen D.,"Santa Barbara, CA",459,1111,27612,3.0,9/5/2014,"Excellent dining atmosphere. The stuffed mushrooms appetizer was good. Hmmm. That's pretty much all the positives. Now negatives: Our waiter seemed pissed and repressed for some odd reason. My lemon chicken pasta dish sucked because the chicken tasted wayyyyy old. My friend's fish dish turned out well.  Ah, I only care about my dish. It sucked."
Tiffany R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,1,1.0,6/8/2016,"Yesterday I had the worst BJ's experience and I just wanted to share. I ordered a caesar salad and the lettuce was wilted and dark and looked awful. Even the chicken had blood spots and fat coming off of the pieces. When the waiter came back I had moved all the gross-looking salad pieces to the top so he could see why I was unhappy with my salad. I then asked for a different salad instead. He made a fuss and seemed very annoyed. When he brought me my new salad, I noticed that they simply put other salad ingredients on top of my old salad rather than bringing me a new one. At this point though, I was very hungry and preferred not to make a fuss by speaking to the manager or getting further involved in the matter. It doesn't stop there, however. After our less-than-great meal, we ordered a pizooki to-go. After we got to our car and opened the pizooki box, I was extremely disappointed to see that our pizooki looked like someone had eaten half of it before giving it to us. It was very flat and did not even fill out the circular box. It was not even in the shape of a circle! It looked like someone ate it before us. I have attached a picture of the pizooki we received for reference. This picture was taken before we even started eating the cookie. I am very disappointed with the service we received, and also pretty surprised. I've never before had a bad experience with BJ's but after last night's dinner I'm not sure how often I'll be coming back."
Chloe H.,"Burbank, Los Angeles, CA",157,378,101,5.0,6/3/2016,"I'm surprised this BJ's has a such a low rating. Every time I have been here, especially with large parties, we have received great service. Food is good and the servers are all very friendly. If you are looking for a casual lunch or dinner, this BJ's is the place to go."
italia s.,"Los Angeles, CA",183,44,63,1.0,12/25/2015,The food sucks. Servers are usually good... just the food is always hit or miss and the last 5x were a miss.  We come here to watch the Raiders game.. I need a new game spot. It's too bad since this place is walking distance from my place.
Michelle M.,"Glendale, CA",105,1,,5.0,3/14/2016,"BJs is awesome! The food is great, beer is amazing, and service is always incredible. Wendy is the best server ever!!! We've had her twice now and each time she was so friendly and accommodating. We will definitely be going back."
Icee P.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,47,111,1.0,12/20/2015,"This review is just for curbside pickup. Lazy Sunday night I order online for curbside pick up at 9 pm. Followed instructions to park in designated curbside pick up parking spot. Then: 1. The curbside parking spots are filled with cars who obviously were not waiting for orders.  Ok so this is really not within BJs control but just wanted to mention. 2. Called the curbside pickup number. Lady who picked up said they dont do curbside pickup after 9. I said my order was scheduled for 9, not after 9. i said when I ordered online it did not inform me that this service was no longer available and my confirmation email did not either. (It actually said curbside pickup at 9 pm) I told her if she really wanted me to go into the restaurant in my pajamas. She said she will ask her manager. 3. Manager confirmed what she said and they werent going to do any thing about it. They actually had the nerve to say that the pick up area is right by the parking lot (aka minimizing your time of pajama and bad hair shame). So I left without taking my order. Hey, it wasn't what was promised."
Jillian R.,"Chatsworth, CA",42,145,67,3.0,8/28/2015,"This place is a typical BJs. This review is not about the food. The food is the same at all of them that I have been too. It's good, not great. It fits the bill when it's in the area and you are not feeling adventurous.  This particular time, I was less than pleased with my super weak Long Island drink I ordered.  It was like 10 dollars, but for juice with a splash of alcohol. That wasn't my main issue though. I'm kicking myself because can't remember the name of the woman who waited on us, but then again how could I?? We only saw her a couple of times during our stop here. She was not attentive in the least. Everytime we wanted something, we had to flag her down and the stuff we ordered seemed to take longer than necessary to get to our table. I'd blame it on a busy restaurant,  but it was after the dinner rush since we were only there for desserts and drinks. So, there was no excuse.  The food we ordered was good. As I said we were there for pazookies which never really disappoint. All in all, don't think I would come to this location again if I can help it."
Cassie V.,"Pasadena, CA",0,3,4,1.0,1/25/2017,Super slow service. Waiter walked by about 7 times without asking if we needed anything with empty drinks on the table. Took forever to grab the check. Terrible. Never again
John M.,"Mechanicsville, VA",175,22,7,4.0,1/9/2016,"The food was great tasting and the portions were generous. The lighting was perfect 10 p.m. at night, low brownish color tone lighting but still very well lit.  Friendly waiters and sheik atmosphere given the decorations and clientele. Soft angular pieces on the wall, brown tan and beige interior, with a colorfully lit alcohol display at the bar. Awesome food again.  (There are not many vegan options listed or specifically defined, however the food combinations allow for it very easily)."
Josiah C.,"Covina, CA",149,11,2,5.0,9/5/2015,"If you eat here do yourself a favor and ask to be served by Tanya. Not only does she go above and beyond a regular server's expected duties, but also she has a great sense of humor.  She gave us some free samples of soup and the different sodas. Thank you Tanya for a great experience! You earned this bj's 5 stars."
Michael D.,"Santa Clarita, CA",2152,1759,2038,5.0,5/29/2015,"Many thanks to BJs for making our fundraising event a success! There were about 30 of us that came here after a play at the Glendale Centere Theater. BJs printed us flyers that were then presented to the servers so our organization could get 15% of the check total. On top of that, the service was great and fast. I never had to ask for a refill as they kept coming until I asked them to stop. We got our fill of that amazing deep dish pizza and the kids really loved the food too. Hats off to you!"
Tee N.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,10,4,1.0,1/22/2017,Came out on a Saturday night to have our belated Christmas dinner. It was 8 of us. I'm not going to go on and on about how horrible it was because in reality the company we were in mattered more than the disastrous dinner. I will just mention the highlights. Service was ok but things were forgotten and we had to wait. Food was brought without utensils. Upon arrival of the burgers my heart sank. I have NeVER seen a less appetizing burger in my life. No juice at all just dry and stale pieces of meAt. My friends burger looked like someone had taken a bite out of the meat so before the guy who brought it out left she asked if the burger was supposed to look like that. In shock he said no and took it back to the kitchen but by then the damage was done. She didn't want the burger anymore and cancelled it. My husband ordered his with cheese and it came with none. The appetizers we paid a WHOPPING $18 for were so ridiculous.  We all work in the food industry so we were just in shock at the shit you can put out there and call it food. The list goes on and on but I'm not a book writer. I just wanted to say my peace about it. The positives were the drinks and pizzokie. Like I said the company we were in made up for everything. And we genuinely enjoyed ourselves. We were just disappointed that we had to pay for such poor food and service. Next year we won't make the same mistake. Thank you for showing your true colors BJ's.
Roger S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,1,,1.0,2/27/2017,"Food was good, service STARTED good and ended terrible. Grabbed and appetizer and desert with some friends and had Paul O. As our server. After eating we were left waiting over half an hour just to pay our damn bill, eventually walked to the front and asked the hostess, she walked it over to the server (I don't know why if he wasn't doing it in the first place) ten minutes later we finally had bill paid. 40 minutes to pay a damn bill. It took less time to eat the damn food. TERRIBLE service, we most definitely didn't tip and he's lucky we didn't just dine and dash since he ignored us the whole time and helped EVERY other table around us. Paul your service sucks, next time SERVE your tables, your title does say ""server"""
