Zach Q.,"Los Angeles, CA",112,257,152,3.0,6/26/2014,"Being relatively new to CA, I had never been to a BJ's before. I heard good things about the beer selection so I had been meaning to check it out.  The place looked pretty nice and was well kept. The server started out by telling me he was gonna turn my good night into an excellent night. (Fail) I was surprised at first by the beer selection cause I had expected a lot of taps from different breweries. I just didn't realize their main focus was on their own beers, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  My wife ordered a flight of BJ's beers, I ordered a Sierra Nevada seasonal IPA bottle.  The flight that my wife received was well priced, but the servers messed up the order of which beer was which when they brought them out. They don't bring them out on a paddle, so there's no organization. They were out of the beer I ordered, and also the second beer I ordered, so I ended up getting a foreign beer, which I really enjoyed. They do have a good selection if Belgians in bottles. The BJ's beers were just ok, nothing to write home about. The food menu had some good options. We got a pizza which was really good but pricey for a 15 dollar small. We also got two apps which were cheap, and tasty.  When my server brought out my bill, they had charged me for both the beers they were out of, which just added to the frustration.  Overall it wasn't a bad visit, but I don't think there was anything that will keep me coming back."
Cydney M.,"La Cañada Flintridge, CA",82,670,3555,4.0,8/17/2012,"This BJ's Restaurant across the street from The Glendale Galleria is pretty good! O.K. so Drake, our server, gave me a hard time because I forgot his name and called him Dwayne.  My bad.  And the dishes look like they need to be thrown in the nearest recycling bin.  I still like it compared to their restaurant in Burbank which is dark and dreary or Rancho Cucamonga where you freeze to death before you get your food. FOOD: 4 stars.  Great lunch specials with flatbread pizzas and salads.  Everything has the calorie count.   This is a great place to bring kids because pizza is one of their major food groups, but then again pizza is my favorite too.  They have a Kids' Menu, Gluten-Free Menu, Curbside Take-out, handcrafted beer, cocktails and wine and many other items on the menu.  My son and I both had the following: Half Margherita Flatbread Pizza and Salad lunch special combo.  It wasn't the best pizza in the world, but I ate the whole thing so that's a good sign.   The salad was really good.  This was one of the lower calorie lunch special options. My son's friend had one of the individual deep dish pizzas and he really liked that.  My friend had the mahi-mahi tacos and she really liked those. There is a photo of the lunch menu next: Win win in my book.  Pizookie - Holy cow are those good!   I just had one bite of my son's.  Bottomless sodas and ice tea not too shabby.  Full bar, but none of us were partaking of mid-day.  Come on!  We're moms, not lushes. SERVICE: 3/5 stars.   The jury is out on Drake our server.  I needed him to replace our dirty looking plates and he was flirting with the hostess.  Dude, you can do that later!   AMBIANCE FACTOR: 3/5 stars.  It is a chain restaurant, but they have some interesting artwork on the walls.  Romantic: I will say a BIG NO.  Good for lunch with the co-workers or the family a BIG YES.  See my photo. PRICES ARE MODERATE: 3/5  stars.  Specials are pretty good at no more than $10.00.  The menu is huge and of course they have beer and other drinks.  Once again, it was lunch and our kids were with us.  Just say no and all that.  Set a good example for the next generation.  Next Monday when my son is on a Missle Cruiser, USS Wayne E. Meyer, in Santa Monica Bay headed toward Catalina all bets are off, but we'll be visiting an actual brewery instead. PARKING IN STRUCTURE: 3/5 Stars.  2 hours free with validation, but you will lose at least a half hour driving up to the roof when you arrive and back down when you leave.  Yes, you may see a couple spots, but they're only big enough for a motorcycle. LOCATION: 5/5 Stars.  Northwest corner of Broadway and Brand Blvd. in the middle of  Downtown Glendale, California, not to be confused with Glendale, Arizona.   It is across the street from  The Glendale Galleria, so for us shopaholics that is a really good thing.  In addition, Bloomingdales will be opening right across the street in a few months.  Yay!!!!  The Americana at Brand is just a couple blocks south on Brand Boulevard. In conclusion, this is a chain and while it is not unique it is still pretty good as far as food goes.   Definitely come here instead of eating in the stinky Food Park at the Galleria.   P.S.  A newer BJ's Restaurant will be opening in Old Town Pasadena in the next year in this really historic looking building.  I can just tell this new one is going to blow the rest out of the water."
George B.,"Glendale, CA",80,51,,1.0,7/12/2015,Didn't even have to wait it out before giving a review. I'm sitting here right now (seated immediately after following up for the third time) and that was just to shut me up. Haven't seen the waiter for 10 mins.  SERVICE blows! Wow.  Bunch of empty booths and not enough servers on a weekend! Never coming back.
Daniela D.,"Glendale, CA",14,43,20,3.0,10/31/2015,"The first time I came here I had a great experience. My server, the food and the drinks were all amazing.  Fast forward to a week later, my boyfriend and I just wanted to go to a bar and have a drink. Were new to the area and this is in walking distance. From the moment we sat down the bartender acted like he didn't want to be there and when we asked him questions about the food and drinks he wasn't helpful. I'm convinced our drinks had no alcohol in them. Im a lightweight and didn't feel a thing. The wings we ordered were the nastiest wings I ever had. Mind you everything we ordered was because he recommended it to us.  Now were annoyed and ready to go. Two women come to sit at the bar and his demeanor completely changes. He's being very helpful, smiling and laughing. Now it gets worse, a lady comes to tap us out because he completely ignored us for 10 minutes even though were right in front of him. Were waiting and signaling them down asking for our card back and they lose our card.  He had glasses and long hair. I would stay clear from the bar if you see him."
Toney C.,"San Clemente, CA",10,29,,4.0,6/2/2015,"Pizza is really good. Definitely a place I don't visit often as it's rather expensive for deep dish pizza. It hits the spot when I crave that type of pizza. Though, I got super curious over their thin-crust pizza. I'd probably come back to try their thin crust pizza.  Solid place for sure."
Harold G.,"Temecula, CA",41,120,,2.0,7/6/2016,Good part of a serviceable chain. The one thing I don't need to do anymore is to look at the menu. Ok service. Difficult parking. But I won't be back. Was trying to remember what I had but it's always the same - chicken Caesar salad.
Nicole M.,"Glendale, CA",386,194,1266,1.0,4/17/2015,"So I went to BJ's last week and the week before and had issues with the staff during both visits.  Saturday- April 4th, 2015 around 7pm My waitress Elisa H. had the worst attitude for no apparent reason. The minute we took our seats she took a really nasty demeanor with us. When we sat down my friend was ready to order her salad, as an appetizer, and I wasn't ready to order, but I didn't care if her salad came out first, but to Elisa it was a big deal. I let her attitude slide thinking maybe I was making something out of nothing, but as our dinner proceeded I could no longer stand her attitude. I get that maybe she was having a bad day or maybe she was upset about having to work on a Saturday night, but there's no need to treat your customers poorly because of it. It's like she wanted us to leave the restaurant. My friend and I wanted dessert after dinner but she didn't even ask us and instead tossed the check on the table while we were still eating. Usually waiters ask if you want to see the dessert menu, good thing we both knew we wanted pizzokies so we let her know, but you could tell that she was annoyed because we weren't leaving. Isn't the staff supposed to want you to order more? That means you'll get a bigger tip!!  Sunday- April 12th around 12am So my friends and I came to get pizookies (yes, I love them), and we were glad that BJ's closes late. We ordered a trio and when we got our pizookies they were extremely undercooked. At first we thought it was because we had ordered one gluten free cookie, but nope all of our pizookies were grainy. It was like we were eating melted cookie dough (food poisoning alert!) We let our waitress Karla M. know about our issue and she didn't seem to like what we were telling her, so she went to get her manager. The manager (unfortunately, I didn't get his name) walks in and immediately takes an attitude with us saying that we're wrong and that pizookies are supposed to taste like that. We asked him if he wanted to take a bite but he declined as he is a diabetic. I repeatedly let him know that I'm a pizookie expert, and had just had one the week before, but he wasn't buying it. After going back and forth about our pizookie problem he reluctantly took them back and put in a new order for us. I really don't know why it was so hard for them to just take it back and bring us a new one without any rude questions or unnecessary remarks. It's like they thought we wanted a free pizookie or something. The thing cost around $9, and we only had one bite of each cookie, it's not like we had consumed the entire dessert! We called our waitress pretty quickly and addressed the problem, but they acted like we were thugs. I also don't know why we didn't get an apology. Aren't you supposed to make your customers happy, why make them feel like they're doing something wrong for speaking up.  I'm just really surprised by the nasty attitude that a majority of the staff has at this BJ's. I was even more shocked to see how rude and condescending the manager was. I guess the problem stems from management. I'm never stepping foot at this BJ's again. If it's not a problem with the staff, it's a problem with the food. Can't I just enjoy my pizookie in peace!"
Cheryl P.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,23,3,5.0,11/16/2015,"Just wanted one of their amazing burgers and a Jeremiah red, but got a tasting of their new seasonal wheat beer and a wonderfully comforting, kind and warm experience from my bartender, Jade. He not only knew his menu and bar inside out but was really friendly, helpful, smart and funny. I may become one of his regulars!!"
Jill M.,"West Hills, CA",110,22,32,5.0,7/15/2016,It has been a long time since I have eaten at BJ's and we went for a family dinner and had the best service ever. Our waitresses name was Latanya and boy did she have energy. She made our experience worth going back. Her suggestions for drinks and food was right up our alley we so enjoyed everything. Thank you!
Samantha B.,"Gilbert, AZ",197,1,,5.0,7/12/2016,"Guys, it's good food and beer. I know its corporate and we're all trying to stay ~kewl~ and fight the 1% but the broccoli cheddar breadbowl is giving me life rn. Also, our server was funny and attentive. Her name is Brianna and she rules so give her alllllll your money. Ok bye xoxoxoxo gossip girl."
Vanessa M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1210,765,2683,3.0,4/29/2014,"3 1/2 stars. I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants like Bj's, Cheesecake or those other ones. It's just my personal taste. Although the food is decent I'd never pick to go unless my friends insisted or I'm held hostage :) Paying for a salad that's over 1,000 calories or a sandwich that's more than 1,500 calories or so is not really ideal for me but hey that's just me. They are great though for happy hours and drinks. And of course...  drum rolls please... their PAZOOKIES! If you have not had this or know what it is you are missing out on life. A giant warm baked cookie with 2 scoops of ice cream. It's every fat person in ourselves dream along with the smokers with their munchies or anyone who loves dessert!! I recommend half chocolate chip and oreo or peanut butter! And you get a free one if it's your birthday (although I believe it's a smaller size). _Chicken  Lettuce Wraps. This was good and somewhat on the healthier side. But nothing special. I just got this because it was one of the lightest on their menu and my friend said it was good so I tried it out. Pretty tasty and refreshing a nice appetizer to share. _Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms. This was pretty good. Comes in 6 bite sized mushrooms, filled with spinach, feta cheese, chopped mushrooms, herb bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese, then sprinkled with crispy bread crumbs and drizzled with lemon pesto sauce. The mushroom was moist and warm, a great appetizer to share! _California Club Flatbread. This was great! The flat bread was thin crusted, which I love. Grilled chicken, crisp Applewood smoked bacon, tomatoes and mozzarella cheese. Drizzled with roasted garlic aioli and topped with fresh diced avocado. Very light and not too cheesy or heavy. A little on the salty side. Great to share as well or have as your main dish.  _Barbecued Bison Burger. Lean, ground buffalo, topped with chipotle BBQ sauce, a seared green chili and pico de gallo and served on a toasted bun with Baja sauce, red onions and lettuce. Served with tangy slaw tossed with Baja vinaigrette and topped with green onions. This was just okay. Although Bison drew my attention the food was quite an opposite reaction. Was not a big fan of the bison patty seasoning. It was a bit bland. The slaw was boring and had barely any dressing.  Overall the food is decent and they offer a huge selection of pizzas, sandwiches, appetizers etc to fit anyone's need. I would come here again just for the California Club flatbread and pazookie  :)"
Chelsey P.,"Long Beach, CA",48,4,1,2.0,11/6/2015,"Food was decent, bar service was lacking. We had to go up to the bar and ask for someone to take our order. Then the wrong pizza was delivered to our table without any silverware, plates, or napkins. We were so hungry, we didn't even notice. Then the CORRECT pizza was delivered, but we were almost finished with the first. We received our drinks about 10 min after we got our pizza.  Originally we wanted to order a Pazooki, but with this service we decided just to ask for our check and get out of there.  I'm surprised, usually BJs has better service."
Myrna G.,"Los Angeles, CA",168,34,9,3.0,9/24/2015,"Fun vibe for sure! Won't give it a higher rating because there isn't anything very special to this place.  The food is tasty, drinks are pretty good, what I live the most is the vibe. Great for large groups that are celebrating and might get kinda rowdy!"
Ellie Z.,"Glendale, CA",17,36,43,4.0,4/27/2015,"I love the veggie patty (avocado) , I don't know how they make it, it's so different.  :) Avocado rolls are another must try! :)"
Nora C.,"Pasadena, CA",0,3,1,2.0,7/20/2015,"I usually don't write reviews, but unfortunately after yesterday's disappointment, I am writing a bad review about one of my favorite restaurants.  At the beginning we had to wait, not because they were busy, but because our buzzer was not working. Then we placed an order (only 1 pasta and 1 french fries) and it took an exact half an hour for them to bring only the fries. After waiting another 10 minutes they brought the wrong pasta. So we had to wait another 15 minutes to get the correct one. Luckily the waitress was nice and she apologized for taking too long, saying that they have a big order and they were working on it. I understand the wait because they had an unusual situation, but that wasn't the only problem. The thin fries, which I usually order and love, looked and tasted really bad as if they fried it twice using rancid oil. When I told the waitress, she looked at it and said ""that looks nasty"". It really did. So they replaced it. Also the dishes were dirty (see picture). Plus we already ordered a piazookie (which we are addicted to), but by the time we had the correct pasta and the normal fries we realized that we were there for more than 2 hours so we had to cancel the piazookie order. When we got the bill they didn't charge for the piazookie but then they brought one anyway. I asked them to take it back since I'm not charged for that. What a disorder. As if all this wasn't enough, at the end we ended up paying for the parking, even after validation, because we parked there for more than 2.5 hours. Such a disappointing experience. Never going to this place again."
Jessica G.,"Los Angeles, CA",137,290,726,5.0,4/10/2014,"I can't lie. I do love BJ's. Never thought I would say that.  (My fiancé is laughing right now if he's reading this, since I'm anti-chain, typically, and root for the little guys) I love the BJ's favorite pizza (deep-dish, please!) and their new Salted Caramel Pretzel Pizookie is my new favorite. I love it so much, I was secretly waiting for my fiancé to tap out, and it never happened. Apparently, he was waiting for the same from me. Ha. We had great service and although it's always busy when we go, the wait is never too long and it's always pleasant. Yes, BJ, you're my secret pleasure. Now all of yelp knows. :)"
Rebekah C.,"Pasadena, CA",51,4,,1.0,6/21/2015,"Our school staff came to this restaurant after calling ahead and letting them know we would likely be a big group-- probably 20. It ended up being 10 and from then on our waitress seemed as if she were done with us. I understand that figuring out how many checks, who is ordering appetizers and who isn't, etc., can be frustrating for the waitstaff, but our service proceeded to be horrible. It took about 50 minutes to get our drinks and appetizers, two or three of our orders were incorrect, we had to ask for refills, sugar, plates, enough pizza stands, and we saw and heard our waitress complaining to other waitstaff about us. The manager came over and addressed a burger that had been sent back as incorrect by sending out a new burger, but he left our waitress on service at our table which made a very awkward atmosphere. She did still bring out a birthday pizookie we had ordered before the whole fiasco, but overall it was an extremely anxiety-producing experience. What a sad way to celebrate graduation and a birthday. I hope never to go back."
CRIS A.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,2,,5.0,5/27/2016,"Me and my friend sat at the bar today and our bartender was JAMES. Although the bar side of the restaurant was busy, JAMES served us in a timely manner and was always attentive to our needs. We left with two big smiles on our faces. Best service at BJ's in quite some time."
Mary H.,"Alameda, CA",1,18,,3.0,12/24/2016,"Turning out not to be the best stay in LA from a service perspective. The food here was classic BJs. Our group had ribs, clam chowder soup, jalapeño burger and salads. The food was good. The service not so much. I was seated first, while the other two members of my group were parking the car.  Although the restaurant was nearly empty at 5:30pm, I waited 20 minutes to be seated. No big deal. It took our server a while to get to the table, but when he did, I ordered our drinks and told him the rest of the group would be there shortly and we knew what we wanted. It took him another half hour to get back us. By then, the three of us had been sitting there with empty drinks for about 25 minutes. He placed our order and then that's the last we saw of him until it was time to order dessert. In contrast, the guy who brought us our meal from the kitchen was superb. He asked us how our food was, refreshed our drinks twice and brought us needed condiments. Where was our waiter? Catering to the table next to us who ordered tons of drinks, appetizers and dessert. He killed them with good service and kindness., while ignoring us completely. I should mention that I reluctantly complain about servers because I know what a tough job this is and what they have to put up with. In fact, we try to be as polite and flexible as possible to try and make up for rude patrons we have seen. This time the service couldn't be overlooked."
Bennett T.,"Glendale, CA",100,4,,1.0,1/7/2017,"If I could give this place no stars I would but that does not happen to be an option. First and foremost, BJ's Pizza has seen a severe decline in the way it does business. I went there tonight to have a nice, warm meal and what I received was a Luke warm atrocity. I ordered the ribeye steak with a side of chili and pilaf. The entire meal, and I mean the entire meal, was like warm at best. When the chili was brought out, it was getting close to being a gazpacho. I asked the server to please reheat the chili and I never saw that bowl of chili again.  Almost sounds like a song. Then came the main course and that was not even quite like warm. I ordered a ribeye medium well and it was almost rare. The rice pilaf was awful and not even warm either. Never going back there again, girlfriend was mortified. Also, to make matters worse, I had to get out of my chair just to let them know that the dish was cold.  Awful place, awful experience, done with BJ's forever. Awful, just awful."
