Travis S.,"Seattle, WA",140,37,28,4.0,10/16/2015,Food was good. Had the Asian Salad. Restaurant was very busy due to MLB playoff game. Good location for watching sports. Service was somewhat slow but not terrible. I would come back.
Mike G.,"Yorktown, VA",0,5,,1.0,12/12/2016,Very poor.  Slow. Bad service.  Don't bother there are many better places in this area.
Jonathan L.,"Glendale, CA",171,23,9,5.0,11/14/2015,"So we came here in a party of 4!  Our experience was AMAZING!!!  Our host, Marina, is so beautiful! She provided such comforting and happy vibe which began our amazing experience! Then, our server, Nick, is extremely friendly and handsome! ;) He checked up on us frequently and served perfectly! I have no complaints!  Definitely coming back and hopefully, seeing them again soon!  10/10"
Ivan M.,"Los Angeles, CA",17,89,25,4.0,7/13/2015,"Well the customer service was garbage when we sat down and we're basically ignored. Fortunately the manager noticed that we had waited an incredibly long time to be waited on and he came over, apologized and got an extra server to is to expedite our drink and food order. Then he took care of the bill and once again apologized for the service.  Good job rebounding BJs. I was ready to picket the place. Now I'm ready for another round."
Ticha B.,"Los Angeles, CA",1102,1623,7645,4.0,6/22/2012,"Happy Hours? 4-7pm / 1000pm - Closing Monday-Friday and I think Sunday. Sit in the bar area.  I've been to this location quite a few times already. Last night after a big softball win, my buddy and I went in for Happy Hours. I thought I'd give a ""shout out"" to Leilani, our waitress. She was AWESOME. She's down to earth, she's very understanding and she's cool.  Go to BJ's HH for $5 off mini pizzas, $1 beers and I think $2 off appetizers. Do go for their Pizookies also! Good for all their TVs and make sure you get your parking ticket validated."
Daniel D.,"Fresno, CA",251,2,2,5.0,5/20/2016,Traveling and made it my First time at this location. Went in for dessert but ended up with a whole meal.  Had great service and pleasant experience. Didn't think I'd be the one to feel appreciated.  Thanks Ricky! See you again next week.
jeff M.,"Valencia, CA",9,61,17,2.0,3/18/2016,"Extremely rude.  Be prepared to feel like you are a burden.  Specifically went to watch the basketball game   Sat down within view of the game and ordered.  I felt immediately like i was bothering them, no worries. Game was on.  1/4 of the way into the game j. The bartender who changed the channel. When i asked if he could change it back  he told me tough luck.  I had to get the rest of the bar to help me have him change it back.  Bad vibes the rest of the night.  Last time i will be at bjs.  Next time order in. Cheaper and easier. Was told management could care less. Gave it 2 stars because my team won :-)"
Adam O.,"Long Beach, CA",332,146,13,5.0,4/10/2016,"I love this location! Not only are they delicious with great service, but they're philanthropic and give back to the community! Thank you, BJs from everyone at Holy Family Lifeteen in Glendale! We love you!!!"
Angela T.,"Pasadena, CA",180,26,8,1.0,4/24/2016,"Food is fine, service is fine, but every time I come here the women's bathroom is nasty.  Not a toilet seat I would put my bum down on.  Literally chose to hold it.  I had to review because 6 stalls...all nasty."
Rosa A.,"Glendale, CA",548,4,,5.0,5/22/2016,Another one of my favorites for date night! Can't beat great customer service and delicious food.
Nora G.,"Sun Valley, CA",1,2,,2.0,5/19/2017,"I went to this BJ's with my niece and her son, on Mother's Day, as a second choice because we couldn't do the 2-21/2 hour wait at a busy restaurant at the Americana. We got to BJ's at around 8:45pm, there was no wait, and we were seated at a table with no silverware or napkins. We didn't think much of this, but about 45 minutes later when the food finally arrived (we were occupied with conversation), we realized that we had nothing to eat it with. It took a few mins to get our waitress's attention, and then another 10 minutes for her to come back with a refill of a drink, but with no place settings. When I reminded her, she said ""they're rolling them right now"", which drew laughter from us but also frustration, because we realized that there were no table settings on any of the empty tables around us. Oh and also my niece's soup in a bread bowl came lukewarm and had to be sent back, and the wait for food & service was way too long, and the floor was being ignored--paper napkins lying next to our table, along with a fork and various ""scraps"" just left under & around the tables. The two stars are for the food because it was tasty once we finally got it, and the waitress was pleasant, although too scarce, throughout the experience."
Blanca V. S.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,39,82,5.0,1/11/2015,"Came to BJ's for their breakfast this morning and to watch the football game @ 10 AM. The food was delicious, the service was great and the environment was nice. If you haven't tried their breakfast, do yourself a Favor and try the BJ's California scramble and the fluffy pancakes!"
Mary A.,"Los Angeles, CA",186,685,10817,4.0,12/11/2014,"BJ's is a very convenient place to dine. Tons of options galore for even the pickiest of the picky. Concept is cheesecake factory style, with better dink options in my opinion. We really come here for their amazing pizookie. Oh how sinful that warm chocolate chip baked cookie topped with vanilla ice cream slightly melting away tastes. I haven't found a place that comes close to the perfectness of this combo. I really love their staple Blonde Ale fish and chips with the crispy thin fries. The fish is always fresh, nicely battered & crisp. The thin fries are delicious & addicting here. The service is really a hit or miss here. you could be forgotten or remembered. Be forewarned do not come here on peak hours & on weekends if your looking to get in n out it just isn't going to happen."
Ellen O.,"Las Vegas, NV",663,835,35,4.0,1/19/2014,"We had a great lunchtime birthday celebration for my dear friend's son today. We had good seats and Jeong our server was wonderful. After devouring a Thai mango chicken salad, and 2 grilled chicken sandwiches, we dove into pzookie trio and a beignet with pleasure. BJshas afun atmosphere and great diverse menu. The excitement of FL playoffs was in the air. It was the best central place to meet up and celebrate!"
Scarlet B.,"Los Angeles, CA",117,6,,5.0,4/10/2016,"Love this BJ's! Christian is the best. We go here all the time but I was especially moved because we had an event for 150 teens tonight and through their immense generosity we were able to fee all of them a delicious and hearty meal. Thank you, BJ's and thank you Christian! You have a faithful and loyal customer!!"
Joseph Y.,"Chatsworth, CA",4999,701,684,4.0,10/29/2013,"BJ's is a solid place for lunch, dinner and drinks. It's a well rounded place to go for business lunch, birthday celebration or to watch your favorite sports game. The quality of food is above average and prices are on par with equivalent restaurants such as Cheesecake factory.  Service is great, but during busy times can have you waiting for up to 30 minutes. They have a seating area for people waiting for a table, so that's a nice plus. Their beer is excellent! I love all of their in house brews. Too bad I stopped drinking because their sampler (small amount of all their beer lines) is great for beer lovers."
Annie T.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,13,,1.0,10/8/2016,Came here for brunch with my friends. We ordered simple pancakes with fruit topping which took about an hour to be served.. It wasn't as if it was packed with a lot of customers. There were only 2 other tables occupied and it seemed their food took a while to come in too.. and when the food came  we were disappointed that the so-called topping was just a slice of strawberry and some maple syrup.
Linda W.,"Atwater Village, Los Angeles, CA",784,400,784,1.0,11/26/2013,"Horrible, horrible service. Andddd they get your order wrong. We had company lunch today so I called BJs to order a take out. The first call, they hung up on me after putting me on hold. Second call and I was on hold for 5+ minutes. I hung up, called a third time and let the person who picked up the phone know that I was having a hard time placing an order, and could he please just take down my order. The guy responded, ""Sorry I am the host so I cannot take your order for you."" So finally, a woman picked up after I was on hold for a good 3 minutes. When she asked me what type of fries I wanted, I turned to my coworker and asked him what he wanted, and she was extremely rude and said ""HELLOOO?"" Uh... If it takes me 3 calls and countless minutes to get ahold of you, I'm sure you can wait 5 seconds for me to get back to you on what fries I want to order.  My coworker picked up the order and came back. My coworker's order was completely wrong. We asked for the Grilled Chicken Club Sandwich with a cup of broccoli cheddar soup, and they didn't even give us the soup. I also specified TWICE for no bacon, and they still put bacon in the sandwich.They also did not provide any ketchup for our fries.  My order, the New Orleans Jambalaya entree, was super greasy. The entire bottom of the plate was covered in a thick layer of grease.  Am definitely not coming back to this location again. This is the worst location I've ever been to-- I've been to many different locations and they've all been fantastic in the past. Food: 1 star Service: 1 star"
Christine L.,"Los Angeles, CA",43,67,56,3.0,2/14/2015,"My boyfriend and I came here for Valentine's Day for dinner. The wait was about 50 minutes long. Our waitress was very kind and checked up on us. However, when we asked another waiter for ketchup and A1 sauce, we left plates on the side for him to pick up & he didn't. So we had to ask our waitress to take the plates we were done with. That's my only complaint in terms of customer service.  For food, we started off with an appetizer of chicken wings. They were crispy and delicious! I got the sirloin steak, and I was a bit disappointed. The meat was very crumbly when I took my first bite. My boyfriend got the jalapeño burger and he said that it was pretty good. 3/5 stars. In his opinion, it was just ""ok.""  Overall, customer service 3/5 Food 3/5 as well. There are other places you can find that has the same food, but maybe tastes better? :)"
Erika S.,"Pasadena, CA",339,218,170,3.0,2/10/2015,"I'm glad this place stays open late but beware of the severe lack of service during those hours. The problem seems to be that the place is understaffed during that time. Every time I've gone the servers were forgetful and would disappear for long periods of time. It's hard to get what you need or ask for. This is not to say anything bad about the servers because they're all pleasant and have good attitudes but I feel sorry for them. They're in over their heads since the guest to worker ratio is so bad. Besides the slow service, the food is pretty consistent and this is a good place to enjoy a couple beers. The hot wings and tuna poke are delicious!"
