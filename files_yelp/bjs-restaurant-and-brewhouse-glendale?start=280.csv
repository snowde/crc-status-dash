Danny M.,"Los Angeles, CA",64,176,12,1.0,11/18/2014,"Just got back from lunch at BJ's. We left the office at 11:30 and its a five minute walk to BJ's. We got seated and it took 10 minutes for our server to come over and take our drink order. We ordered our food and waited and waited and waited. We have one hour for lunch. We could hear some commotion in the kitchen, people yelling at each other. At 12:15 we asked our server to make our order to go as we only had one hour for lunch. I don't know what has happened to this locations service has been getting slower and slower. Other tables were waiting for a long time as well. We paid our bill and did not even get an apology for the wait. I am sitting here at my desk and have had two bites of my now cold hamburger and fries and it's going into the trash.  I don't think I will be back to this BJ's. To be fair it was not the servers fault that the kitchen was taking forever. But at the very least an apology for the wait would have been nice."
Ian C.,"Pasadena, Los Angeles, CA",117,23,7,3.0,2/6/2015,"I've come here many times, but every single time I don't think the BJ's management has ever thought about making the decision to hire more people to take care of more of their guest. Just came in today, had to wait 10 minutes for someone to take our order when all we really wanted was the huge pizookie.  Very dim lighting, not a huge fan of that. Sometimes they even lower it even more for whatever bizarre reason. I really like to see the people I'm around and what I'm eating, thank you very much. They do serve some great food, but that doesn't ignore the fact that your customers should have to wait so long just to order. Being attentive to your guest should be your number one priority at a restaurant. P.S they under cook their pizookies, they always have that mushy feel when you try them. Prefer my cookies a bit sturdy and chewy."
Dro E.,"Glendale, CA",0,24,2,1.0,1/6/2016,"If I could give a No star,I would!!!! Every Time when my friends and i go there, because its located so close to us, we face this problem!! Servers dont pay enough attention to us. On the contrary, they walk around talk to each other! Last time i was trying to grab any waiters attention to ask for a refill!i got tired from waving my hands in the air, so i ate my dinner with no drink!!!at the end I didn't tip him and he was kind of mad at me and making faces like you have to or why you did not tip me !!!he actually came back and asked me did I forget or I didn't want to....!why would he be mad at me?!i dont have to tip him for his shitty service!!!he made me and my friends feel so bad! This is for you, the black waiter, if you reading this!!!!if you dont serve us right we are not going to tip you and if we dont tip you you cant be mad at us or raise your voice or try to tell us something by changing your voice tone! Thats just so disrespecting!!!!i hope you get fired!"
Irene Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",167,320,127,4.0,12/11/2013,"My husband used to go to BJ's all the time when he was a college student. He keeps trying to take me but I keep balking because I tell him that nothing that tasted good when we were that age tastes the same now. But he persisted so we found ourselves here at 3:00 pm on a Sunday after doing some Christmas shopping in Glendale. We split the barbecue chicken salad and one of their deep dish pizzas. I tried hard not to look at the calorie counts next to the pizza. I have to say that everything was delicious, although I don't know if a salad that has that much ranch dressing can really count as a salad!  As if it wasn't enough, we ended the meal with a chocolate chip pizookie, which was everything that my husband said it would be. If we were there later in the day I would have gotten one of their home-brewed pumpkin ales too.  I'm glad I finally gave in and tried it out!  By the way, this place is very kids friendly! Nearly every table around us had young children there. Something that I'll have to tell my friends with kids!"
Ingrid P.,"Los Angeles, CA",100,1,1,3.0,9/20/2015,Usually this place is great but today we orders steaks and asked for medium cooked and it was totally raw :/   we had a great service by Tanya .
Esmeralda A.,"Glendale, Los Angeles, CA",8,12,2,5.0,4/10/2016,Thank you to BJs for giving us the time to provide food for our church event at holy family Glendale ! They are amazing and have such great servers and managers !
Joanna M.,"Glendale, CA",2,3,2,4.0,9/5/2015,I went there yesterday and had steak and red wine was so good . Recomended. We had wait to have us seat that's why I take one star from them.
Annalynn A.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,91,2,3.0,4/1/2016,"I've been here a few times and have tried very hard to like the food here but I have not been very satisfied.  I mean, it's good food don't get me wrong, but I guess I just prefer something different.  It sounds good on the menu but hasn't come out that way, for me.  Service is just ok, sometimes they serve you right away then seem to forget about you.  If you order drinks the first one is very good, then any after that gets more and more watery."
Bogard C.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,95,9,1.0,11/25/2014,"Really slow and bad service.  Waited more than 5 mins still no water refills. Our waitress is MIA all the time. She forgot my sriracha and I never got it. When my friend kindly reminded her of my hot sauce, she just turned around and walked away. So I decided to leave her no tips and told the hostess about.  The hostess asked if I want to speak to the manager but I felt no need because we won't return there. Been to other bjs, such as Pasadena and West Covina got much better service."
Ashim A.,"Pasadena, CA",10,10,,1.0,5/19/2015,Food poisoning. Deep dish bjs classic pizza. Tasted exactly like crappy pizza hut from back in the day. Oily greasy tasteless bread. No sauce. Salty as hell. Vegetables tasted weird - definitely out of a can or some pre-packaged old bag. Cheese burnt on the bottom.  Not a deepdish..just a hand tossed. Made me feel sick. Writing this as I want to throw up.  Friend had terrible acid reflux. Her mom ate leftovers that night and felt sick.  Ive been throwing up all night.  Stay away get Domino's instead.   Staff very friendly though.
Jennifer D.,"Los Angeles, CA",57,26,2,4.0,12/17/2014,LOVE their BBQ pizza and balsamic chicken plate! Good quality food a little pricey but satisfying... It can get pretty busy and may be a wait on weekends.
Linda A.,"Glendale, CA",1,7,4,3.0,4/8/2016,"The only reason I'm giving this place 3 stars instead of 1 is because my server Jason was outstanding. Our food was shitty I wouldn't eat here again or recommend it to anybody but the customer service was great. He was very quick about refilling our drinks and checking up on us. And he was being nice the whole time even though I was being kind of annoying by making him stop and asking him for more food or to change something. Over all, customer service was great, food was horrible. Only one of the people with us enjoyed the pizza. The fries were bomb tho, get them thin if you do decide to go!!"
Sheik Abu Yacoub B.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",135,47,121,2.0,6/21/2015,Went there today got my free Father's Day mug ‍‍ Food was dry The pizza was not cut up properly Waiter was exactly what I expected so no tip provided 26 dollar meal for 2 Met my expectations for franchise food
Mike S.,"Thomasville, GA",93,3,,1.0,4/21/2016,"Seriously.... I felt like I paid 65 dollars for McDonald's, I ordered a few appetizers and got got a bunch of fast food type of shit. I didn't event order any drinks or anything and it was so expensive for some fast food quality food. Worst place I have ever been and I downloaded this app just to make this comment. Normally I don't care and am happy with everything. DONT GO HERE!!!!!"
Lois E.,"Los Angeles, CA",19,39,21,2.0,6/10/2015,"I got the pepperoni deep dish pizza but there was hardly any pepperoni on it. The bread was waaaaaaayyy too thick, it almost tasted like it was just cheesy bread :/ I've had this before, at other locations and it's always been good, idk what happened today.  On the upside, some reviews say how lousy the service is but our waitress did pretty good and we're a big group."
Bobb D.,"Georgetown, CA",50,5,6,1.0,2/25/2016,Horrible service.... Was discriminated cause of my ethnicity and beliefs. It took the server 3xs to be asked about the beers me and my table ordered as soon as we sat down. I don't reccomended going here ever. 2 servers for a 2000 square ft establishment. ITS ALL IN THE NAME
Jeannette G.,"Los Angeles, CA",510,808,612,4.0,1/11/2015,"Good lunch experience under 1 hour.  Seating was prompt and server was quite patient while I took my time looking at the menu.  After much ado, I ended up with the chicken taco lunch plate at $5.95.  Although my tacos were cold when I got them, they were quite good."
Michelle R.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,17,,1.0,11/25/2015,"This review is for the horrible service we received. At first our waiter seemed okay basic service, but then we realized after we ordered drinks and appetizers he never came back to take our dinner order or ask if we wanted alcoholic drinks which we did! We had to sit there looking around and then flag him down, when we ordered he seemed like he was in rush, yet just minutes later we watch him at the adjacent table chatting for 5 minutes like he doesn't have any customers to attend to. Then he forgot drinks we ordered and we had to flag him down again, not once did he ask if we needed anything, not once did he check up on us, we would have liked certain condiments and more drinks but he was always busy talking at the same table, honestly would have just liked some basic service and assistance but being ignored!"
Sung Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,77,,2.0,9/22/2016,"Ordered a personal size pizza and it came tore up like someone beat it. When the food was brought out, I asked the lady who brought it for place setting and she never came back. Sat there waiting while the food was getting cold. Also ordered a burger and it was so dry. Couldn't wait to get out of there after a disappointing meal but of course they made a mistake on the bill and had to wait 10mins for the manager to fix it. I'll just come back for drinks."
Leslie S.,"Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",62,83,437,5.0,3/12/2014,This is my 2nd time here.the hostess was very friendly and we were seated right away Our waiter was nice we went during lunch hour.
