Susy M.,"Azusa, CA",97,4,,1.0,3/21/2016,"My coworkers and usually go there for lunch and the service is great but today the service was horrible. We called in to reserve a table since we had a large party, we arrive and our table wasn't ready n we still had to wait another 10 mins. Mind you we only have an hour for lunch. We then proceed to sit at the bar and another 10mins go by and no one comes to us, so we ask the bartender for menus, finally 30 mins into being there we finally get a server after we spoke to the head chef. Very disappointed with our experience"
Edrina A.,"Glendale, Los Angeles, CA",1,19,,3.0,7/3/2016,I've been to this bjs location a lot of times but lately when I went I always found hair in my food.
G M.,"Glendale, CA",43,8,1,5.0,4/9/2016,Latanya was totally amazing. Thank you very much for the epic service. Such a beautiful person. I love. Love love the BJ's in Glendale the whole staff is pretty much great.  Good job management
Dan G.,"Los Angeles, CA",400,47,96,2.0,2/17/2016,The food is priced reasonably but that doesn't make it good! I am a big pizza fan and this stuff tastes cheap and processed. A friend told me that they have great pizza and I'd never know it was a chain restaurant. Quite the opposite! The pizza was mediocre at best and it was run by kids that looked like they'd rather be anywhere but there. I'm giving it a pass!
Rita W.,"Rockville, MD",528,337,1552,3.0,3/29/2011,"BJs can be a yey, a nay, or a meh, it's just alright. Yeah, it kind of hits the whole spectrum, depending on luck. The food has a lot of potential to be ZOMGWTFSOEFFINGGOOD, but hey, that's why there's alcohol, right?  Anyways, I usually get some appetizers, a burger or pizza, or whatever here, since it's a pretty standard place. I've also had some drinks and their cider, which was good. Can't go wrong with some ethanol content unless you're allergic or pregnant and whatnot.  The food I've had seemed rather consistent. Their avocado eggrolls are good if you like your avocado eggrolls pure avocado (I uploaded a picture for you awesome yelpers and lurkers to see). They are a bit more avocado-y than the Cheesecake Factory avocado eggrolls, but they are nothing compared (not in a bad way; in fact, I do prefer the avocado to the non-avocado) to the CPK eggrolls because the CPK ones are filled with a bit of avocado and a bunch of non-avocado, such as bacon. But yes, the name avocado eggroll doesn't lie at BJs.  One buddy once ordered one of BJs burgers, but he had to send it back because apparently it was super gross and inedible, but I'm not to judge, since I didn't take a bite of his food.  The prices are pretty standard - more pricey than fast food, cheaper than Olive Garden for the most part.  Service can be either good, okay, or bad. I've had all three. It's a good place to go with friends to grab some drinks and share a bunch of appetizers."
Jennifer H.,"Los Angeles, CA",202,18,10,5.0,9/7/2015,"Danny was our server, he was awesome! I came I ate and I was happy to leave just as fast as I came :) Thank you BJ's! Love the artichoke dip, Spinach chicken and fruity light Ale's  #Delicioso"
Sonia L.,"Pasadena, CA",129,107,12,5.0,10/22/2015,"Great service, good food and great vibe.  I love their happy hour especially during football season. My favorite server is  Achara because she always takes care of us."
Joseph L.,"Orange County, CA",447,182,805,1.0,2/13/2013,"Sorry to report that the BJ's in Glendale is a 1 Star -  Very slow service.  The place was empty and our server was MIA -  Ordered small salad and small pizza.  Shame on you BJ's for the food you served.    Salad had a large proton of the lettuce core and the pizza looked like it came out of the box. Shame, Shame, Shame"
Cyn D.,"Long Beach, CA",1,9,20,1.0,3/27/2016,"AHH! The service is not bad, but the food is where they really get their stinky, single star.  My husband and I have avoided this place for many years, but thought maybe it was time to give it another chance.  They served us an extremely undercooked buffalo burger. I cut it in half and it was COMPLETELY red/raw/bleh. The waitress apologetically took it back to the kitchen. She returned with what she claimed was a second burger, she said she cut this burger herself to make sure it was cooked in the center. Turns out it was the same burger I cut, because I cut it again, and it was just as raw as before, lol. ""cut it yourself"", gimme a break. Plus, in the time the plate had visited the kitchen for a second time, the salad was completely wilted, perhaps it was sitting under a heat lamp? They did take the burger off the bill.  So...thanks for that!"
Harut Y.,"Burbank, CA",179,228,208,4.0,9/16/2013,"I have always been satisfied from this place.  I always order a Jalapeno burger, with thin fries, and the house Root Beer!  Service is always amazing! Only once, I have been dissapointed from my waiter.  He left our table for a good 40 minutes, and gave us no attention. I contacted the manager, and she took care of our bill! Free of charge!  Carefull when you come on a game day!  I want to say, come an HOUR before the actual game starts, so you can try to beat the crowds!"
Willie F.,"Edmonds, WA",126,52,34,4.0,12/28/2014,"I'm from San Francisco Bay Area and we have BJs there too. Came here during football Sunday to watch the 49ers play. PROS:  - can't go wrong with BJs food - since LA doesn't have a football team, you get a good mix of football fans here - clean bathrooms - located across the street to a pretty good mall with lots of different stores and restaurants  - good happy hour CONS: - wish the calamari was a happy hour item - the happy hour chicken wings come with only 5 wings? Pfftttt! Overall the place is okay. Bartenders were nice and attentive, kept on refilling my nephews Pepsi all the time. I think what made it good for a San Franciscan like me was the variety of football fans. There were other 49ers fans (yaayyyy!), Seahawks (booo!) fans, Cowboys fans, Steelers fans, Raider fans, Chargers fans, and some Rams (blehhh!) fans."
Heather F.,"Los Angeles, CA",49,129,386,3.0,10/22/2014,"Located on corner of Brand & Broadway. Parked in the garage of the building. Pretty cramped garage - not large car friendly at all. I can see how it would get full on a Fri/Sat night but I was there on Tues night so parking was easy. BJ's validates 2 hours free for that garage. No wait for a table for 4 (again, on a Tues 6:30pm). I ordered my usual small deep dish buffalo chicken pizza and it never fails to be delicious! We split a pizookie trio with cookies & crème, peanut butter, white chocolate macadamia. Trio is great if you all want something different. Favorite was cookies & crème. Service was decent, but we felt a bit rushed by our waitress. Before we were halfway through meal, she was asking us if we were going to order dessert and then came back twice while we were still eating to inquire. Then before we got the dessert, she dropped off our bill. Uhhhh in a rush to get out of there? It was well before 7:30pm! Otherwise, it was a typical experience for me. No better or no worse than other locations."
Cassandra M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,,5.0,3/26/2016,"I just ordered a dish To Go and a little embarrassed to say I did not have enough. Carina S. Is the most kind hearted angels working there, she helped me pay our of her own tips. I am very thankful, so much I wanted to cry because that was very kind of her to help me. Bjs is very fortunate to have such a wonderful associate working there, I very much enjoyed my food thank you to the cooks and staff and most of all Thank You Carina.  :-)"
Melissa N.,"Los Angeles, CA",123,143,61,5.0,7/31/2014,"I'm pretty much a regular at this location and I've been coming here for years. BJ's never disappoints. You can never go wrong with having one of their brewed beers or a pizookie at the end of your meal. And if you're like me, you'll get both!  Food wise, for appetizers my favorites are avocado egg rolls or spinach artichoke dip. For entrees me favorites include any type of deep dish pizza, Mediterranean chicken pita tacos (absolutely delicious, light and fills you up), mahi-mahi tacos and parmesan crusted chicken.  As you can tell, this is my favorite restaurant. Staff is friendly and I always feel like I'm getting more bang for my buck. Again, never disappointed!"
Arvin P.,"Los Angeles, CA",66,193,9,5.0,1/13/2015,"My wife and I love this place. There are so many things on the menu that are good that it's always hard to choose just one thing. We always start with an order of buffalo wings with the xxx sauce. It really isn't over the top hot or anything, but we enjoy the flavor.  We're also a big fan of the bar here. Our favorite drink? ""A drink like that."" Tasty and strong, just the way we like them. I don't think there's really anything bad on the menu here. We've had everything from sandwiches to steaks to seafood here and every single time the food is awesome."
Romio S.,"Glendale, CA",5,3,,5.0,2/13/2016,"Amazing restaurant. Amazing food from the appetizers to the main dishes, everything was delicious. Our waitress Shatora was very kind and was quick to assist us. The manager even came to our table to ask us how everything was. Very friendly staff. Don't forget to order the die for Avocado Egg Rolls (my favorite). Thanks BJ's for the great customer service and exquisite food."
Marine K.,"Glendale, CA",35,29,4,1.0,10/26/2015,"The service is hit and miss here. The waitress forgot my husbands beer, took them over ten minutes to bring our beverages. I ordered grilled chicken plate for my 3 year old and the food looked like it was reheated and cooked days ago. I ordered turkey sandwich and got a hot ham sandwich instead , lol. This location needs a reality check. I won't be returning  the service is horrible!!"
Jessyca C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,8,21,4.0,3/20/2016,"This is my family's go to restaurant. Food is great, service is awesome except for today's visit. As we all arrived, no one was there to greet us or check us in. Hostess was no where to be found and after waiting for about 10mins. she arrives and asks, ""Can I help you?"". Idk if that's best best way to greet a guest after having them wait. Anyways we were escorted to a booth table that was too small for our party. The restaurant was not busy as it usually is so our wait time seemed longer than it should have been. When the waiter finally asked us for our drinks he returned with all but 1 he had forgotten. As he later took our meals, he didn't right it down and ""memorized"" all our orders. My Cesar salad arrived first and the bowl was half way full. The lettuce was so old with black spots and croutons where stale. I asked for a fresher salad and the waiter was really nice about getting me a fresh salad. We also ordered the queso and salsa verde dip with chips which was amazing except for the chips included more chip crumbs than chips. The waiter again was nice enough to bring extra chips. First, someone came to drop a guacamole burger which none of us had order. The person was so angry when none of us claimed it because none of us had ordered that.  When the meals we actually ordered arrived, try were wrong either we ordered wedge cut fries or thin cut fries and all were wrong. Again this was brought to the waiters attention and he was nice enough to bring the correct type. Food ended up being really good but experience wasn't as pleasant as its always been. Idk if the really manager wasn't there or if something was just off but usually everything is always perfect at this BJ's."
Jack M.,"Glendale, CA",3,11,,1.0,5/28/2015,BJ's him self has a good food and good name in Cali. But this one in Glendale is awful!!!! Not even a normal service experience :(
Vagreg T.,"Glendale, CA",0,11,,1.0,9/19/2016,Whenever I came to the Glendale one something went off. The food took a long time to arrive almost an hour. The worker had an attitude. I was not treated well. I'm not a happy customer. Overall the food that took so long it was good.
