Vagreg T.,"Glendale, CA",0,11,,1.0,9/19/2016,Whenever I came to the Glendale one something went off. The food took a long time to arrive almost an hour. The worker had an attitude. I was not treated well. I'm not a happy customer. Overall the food that took so long it was good.
Lisa L.,"Princeton, NJ",0,32,,4.0,8/28/2016,Love the pzookie here! The mini size pzookie sampler is a good choice to share with people when you can't decide which toppings.?
Kevin J.,"Mira Loma, CA",27,262,1051,2.0,10/22/2014,"Ouch this isn't a good one. Clue one, sunday during NFL football and it's EMPTY You  can ask anyone and theyl tell you I love bjs. But this was in particular was bad. Ordered chicken a pizza  with no onions and nnothing else and chicken roll with ranch. Of course they forgot the ranch and they gave me the wrong pizza.... man come on. Then when they gave another one it came with onions which I asked to have off hahah.  Asked for the correct one and I got a rushed pizza with the cheese UNMELTED. WTF?  It tasted bad. Looked like this place is lazy. Didn't know what was going on and unorganized. Won't come back."
Mary M.,"Pasadena, CA",275,129,99,4.0,9/3/2014,"My cousin and I went to happy hour today and it was pretty good! $5 mojitos... Yes please!!! They also had sliders, chicken wings, and a few other items for $5 each. It's a good spot if you're looking for happy hour. The staff was very friendly as well! Make sure to park in the structure and validate!  On a side note, i love the pazooki!!!! Especially the red velvet one. So sweet but so good. Make sure you order it!"
Jennifer M.,"Sylmar, CA",0,8,,5.0,9/12/2016,Awesome service!  Just had a birthday dinner with 25 adults and 5 kids.  The service was on point!  Food came out all together.  They were on top of drinks! Can't thank them enough for making it a great and smooth experience for me!
Richi K.,"Los Angeles, CA",22,212,188,4.0,11/30/2015,"Arrived at 8pm, told as long as there is a game, there is happy hour at the bar. My friends and I sat at the bar ordered pints of beer ($1 off), 3 mini pizzas (half off the small price), calamari  (half off), avocado roll (half off). Everything was delicious and well priced."
Erik M.,"Van Nuys, Los Angeles, CA",17,13,3,1.0,5/20/2016,"Very bad service, waited for one hour straight, still didn't approach waited for a refil also never recieved mine."
Bernard L.,"Los Angeles, CA",35,48,11,4.0,9/27/2015,After 4 years I decided to give the Glendale location another try. You can't stay mad forever right?  To say things are slow at the Glendale BJ's location would be putting it mildly. There are maybe 20 people in the whole restaurant watching various football games.  The waiter (who was handling all the tables) was nice and courteous. He got my order promptly and checked up on me frequently.  I think I will start making the Glendale location a regular stop during football season. I hate crowds and this place is definitely NOT crowded.  I have always enjoyed BJ's during football season for their beer but I tended to favor the Burbank location for their service. In the past I have been disappointed with the Glendale spot but hey have turned me around.
David C.,"Los Angeles, CA",33,52,1,5.0,12/1/2014,I like this Bj's location. It is central to the city of Glendale and the food/service is up to par with other locations. There may be a wait time but that is typical for dinner service but you do get attended and the food comes within a reasonable time frame. Parking is provided for free with validation up to two hours if not then park at the Glendale mall for free and walk to the restaurant.
Alex S.,"Glendale, CA",0,16,,2.0,2/8/2016,This place has great avocado rolls but weird employees. This waitress is always there and she always ends up serving us. This woman does not let us speak and made us feel very uncomfortable. She put in our order literally 40 minutes after she wrote our meals down. I don't know how she still works there. We go to the Burbank location just to avoid her. (African American lady with her hair in a pony tail).
Michael C.,"Los Angeles, CA",179,15,,5.0,1/20/2016,"Great vibe. Friendly staff. Manager, Roy, is nice...takes the time to check in on each patron."
Kay K.,"Jersey City, NJ",3,57,23,2.0,1/19/2016,"Horrible service, very slow. Parking is horrible and it took forever for the food to come out. It was cold and it wasn't even busy"
Emmi N.,"Los Angeles, CA",90,130,286,3.0,7/22/2013,"Could be a fun place to catch a few drinks and socialize with friends.  But food is just ok.  Had the Stuffed Mushrooms and the Black & Blue Flatbread to share with a friend.  Mushrooms weren't too bad.  Kinda inconsistent with the sizes.  The Flatbread was disappointing.  Just very minimal on the toppings and cheese, mostly just bread - not filling at all. I do like that they brew their own beer.  I've tried a couple, and they were good. If it was just for this latest visit, I would've given it 2 stars for the disappointing food.  But I've been to BJs a few times at other locations, and they haven't been as bad.  So I give them 3."
Yes F.,"Eagle Rock, Los Angeles, CA",0,10,3,5.0,6/14/2015,Bj's has great food and they brew their own beer. I've had the pleasure of having been sat in Tanya's section twice.. I recognized her as my waitress from the last time.. And she is just amazing. She is an asset to this restaurant and she made my meal more pleasurable. Ask to be sat in her section and you'll see what I mean
Jane H.,"Oak Harbor, WA",7,52,64,4.0,10/24/2015,"Rex was a great server. My only complaint was that it was a birthday pazookie and the food runner came out and was about to drop the pazookie without even lighting the candle for the pazookie and the ice cream was almost melted and my cookies n cream pazookie didn't have the cream. I'm just being over critical because I used to work at bjs and know the protocol. Other than that, my service was amazing and I definitely recommend asking for Rex."
Casa De Aurum ..,"San Fernando Valley, CA",0,95,132,3.0,11/11/2014,"I normally enjoy eating at BJ's in Glendale,  Ca; especially during my lunch time with the ordering ahead online option.  I always have great service & if ever there's an issue,  it is always taken care of.   A few weeks ago, we (6 co-workers) went there for lunch and had a perfect example of poor and in adequate service.  We were seated immediately as there was very few tables in use.  We have a 1 hour lunch breae & we showed up at work 2 1/2 hours later!   It took 45 minutes to get our food and still some orders were incorrect & incomplete.  When the servers brought out our food and we brought the errors to their attention,  their responses were always let me get your waitress.  Our waitress wouls always come....about 10 minutes later.  When we told her what was wrong, she would just acknowledge by saying okay.  Eventually the items came out.   This was not the end of it.  When the bill came, we all looked at the price of our individual meals and pitched in an extra $ 2 for tax and tip (cash & credit card). The waitress came back saying that she did not charge anything yet because we were still approximately $60 short.  We were astonished and could not understand why but just for the sake of getting out, a few of us put additional money in to cover the cost difference.  At that point, we really started to review the bill we noticed there was additional items that did not belong to us. We informed the waitress of this discovery and her response was:  oh I see what I did.  I'll get that corrected.  She came back with a new receipt & removed our drinks for the error.  She came back with the corrected bill, the credit card receipts and then questioned the additional $27.  She actually had the nerve to ask if the remaining balance was her tip.  At that point we were just waiting for a simple apology on her part and it never came. I can only hope that this waitress was new & did not know what she was doing. However, that was not the case.  She was so unenthusiastic, looked like she really did not want to be there and did not care about the service she provided.   I hope that if management of the BJ's of this location - Glendale, CA & on Brand Blvd. reads this review they will have a serious conversation to their staff and in particular this waitress whose name is Andrea.  If you are seated in the section of waitress Andrea, I would highly suggest us to sit somewhere else."
Steve I.,"Pasadena, CA",112,108,20,5.0,7/12/2015,"For what it is it's tough to beat...great late night food, classy atmosphere, and good service. I ordered the Thai mango salad I give it a 7. My friend got the BBQ chopped salad, I gave that an 8. The chicken lettuce wraps get a 5."
Robert G.,"Glendale, CA",0,6,,2.0,8/20/2014,"I've been here several times, so the two stars are more of a holistic rating.   Usually, my experience has been pleasant, nothing above and beyond. Would have been a 3-star rating, but my most recent dinner there earned them 2.     I came here with my coworkers for one of their birthdays. Bigger crowd, but nonetheless, they were able to accommodate us. The waitress was sweet at the beginning, but she began to develop some major attitude as the dinner progressed.    Sure, we were a bit loud, but last time I checked I wasn't at the public library. She also brought the check when we were nowhere ready to leave. Cool.    One of my friends asked if she could split the bill, and homegirl grunted SO loud that we all paused for a second.    Sorry - did you not want to do your job?    Ironically enough, we all work in customer service so, we get it, needy customers aren't fun, hence, we were being as un-needy as possible.   But really, sh*t service. I don't want to hear her grunting."
Ryan C.,"Buena Park, CA",29,63,32,5.0,7/3/2015,"I love this place! Their pizza is the best! Also love their Mac and cheese and chicken Alfredo. I always come during happy hour to get some good deals on the food. Service is pretty good and quick even when it's pretty busy, waiters are always nice so that's a plus. I would definitely recommend this place to my friends!"
Joy Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",296,56,183,2.0,11/1/2014,"Wanted to try this place after hearing how popular it is but my family probably won't be going back.  Granted it would be crowded on a night that ucla football and lakers bball have games showing but the wait wasn't worth the experience we had. The screens were smaller than we expected and from our table we couldn't get a good view. The free lot parking and nice servers were good but service itself was extremely slow. We had to ask for silverware after our food came, which came after an incredibly long wait and after everyone around us who had been seated after us had already started eating their food. The calamari we ordered as an appetizer came at the same time as our main dishes and was also plated really sloppily.. They also forgot to give my dad garlic bread which came with his spaghetti.  We also tried the pizookie but it was too sweet and gooey for our tastes.."
