Hovik T.,"Glendale, CA",0,4,,2.0,9/1/2016,I've been going to BJs for a long time however I had a bad experience the last time I was there.i ordered a steak and asked for some A1 sauce and they didn't have it.I got 2 bottles both of them empty.When I asked the waitress for another A1 sauce again I was told they ran out.Even though it's not the waitresses fault it's a shame.
Jeff C.,"San Diego, CA",34,158,,4.0,7/1/2015,"Very nice building, patio and location. Service is very good. Huge menu. Food is equal to price. Selection of beer, including their own is excellent."
Michael M.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,69,25,2.0,1/7/2015,Happy hour food was ok and our waiter was actually really chill and nice. He even gave us a free dessert because was my buddy was celebrating something.  It was empty and the service was fast. The reason for 2 stars? The drinks basically contained no alcohol had one on an empty stomach and didn't feel anything. Know it's happy hour but pour stronger drinks if you want people to come back for that.
Nannette K.,"Glendale, CA",18,1,,1.0,2/15/2016,"Cold/wrong food after the second time returning it to the kitchen on my birthday! Used to like the place, but not anymore!"
Erika K.,"Glendale, CA",9,29,5,5.0,7/9/2015,Adrian was our server and he was awesome! Usually I come here and the waiters/waitresses check up maybe once or twice but he literally came every 5-10 mins and I really appreciated that. Loved his personality and his overall service!
Marty L.,"Honolulu, HI",1,27,1,4.0,2/2/2014,"I rate this place 4 stars.   +1:  Good food.  Good service.  Good ambiance. Friendly service.   I went in to watch the game on Superbowl Sunday.  I sat at the bar.  I like the food, the service, and ambiance.  I would return again.  The ambiance is more upscale than Islands but lower than Granville's.  This would be a good place for happy hour, drinks, food, and watching the game."
Alyson P.,"North Hollywood, CA",68,54,18,5.0,6/15/2015,"I give the restaurant 4 stars but our server, Kelly, gets 5. He is the best server I've ever met and I used to be a server so that says a lot. He's absolutely hilarious and just a cool guy. he was nice enough to let me and my guest enjoy my going away party and play CAH even though when I booked the reservation they said we couldn't, but the restaurant wasn't busy and Kelly didn't have a problem with it. I had so much fun and I'm so glad we set in his section."
Casey M.,"Visalia, CA",127,18,8,5.0,11/22/2015,From out of town and wanted a place to watch the game with lunch. The service was quick and food was brought out promptly. Our server had great suggestions and the pizzas was hot.:-)
Ezekiel T.,"Sunland-Tujunga, CA",1,1,,5.0,8/7/2016,I went to the bjs in glendale and asked the bartender to set me up proper. I just wanna say to my bartender/server jade well done! For being bjs.... he made it a 5 star dine.
Anush K.,"Glendale, CA",2,5,,5.0,6/9/2015,Their food is very delicious. The workers are very responsible and try everything to be amazing. We had a party at the office today and ordered different kind of food. Their vegetarian pizza is amazing.
Melani K.,"Valencia, CA",0,10,19,5.0,1/6/2015,"I really like this location. Great location, friendly staff, delicious food. Thats  all i need to have a great time :)"
Andre K.,"La Cañada Flintridge, CA",19,44,2,3.0,10/15/2014,"This BJ's location used to be my go-to spot whenever I felt like grabing a brew with a few friends and catch whatever sports game is on.  If you're here just to get a beer or two it's definitely not worth the trip or the money for that matter. Happy hours fall on such ridiculous times especially if you're working so you can expect to pay full price pretty much everytime you're there. However, if you're here for a party or the food they've got some bomb options you can choose from. I used to always get the Avocado Egg Rolls as an appetize, grab a meal like the BJ's Jalapeno Burger and wash it all down with a Porter. It's rather pricey here too so you can expect to drop around $30-$40 for a full stomache. Portions are big but honestly it's worth it. Service here is below average... even on less busier nights I'd find myself waiting for a simple glass of Blue Moon or even water for up to 30-45 minutes. The servers are friendly but the service itself is not worth the trip or tip for that matter. BJ's was always a fave place of mine, and they have always served me with a smile on their face so it has earned 3 stars in my book."
Gurgen S.,"Glendale, CA",0,11,,2.0,7/10/2016,"Brewhouse? More like house of mediocrity... I've been to a few different BJs and this one is by far the worst of the bunch. Average food, average service, average ambience. Today I went to watch the Euro League finals and the TVs crashed around the 35th minute. They came back around the 45th minute without audio and the main TV never came back on. The TVs kept crashing and we were forced to wait 5-10 minutes at a time before the TVs would come back on. I missed at least a quarter of the game because of that. When I complained to the waiter, he and management did absolutely nothing to compensate for the issue. My sole purpose in coming to BJs today was the watch the game with friends but that didn't even successfully happen. I would have been better off watching the game at home on ESPN. Today, I'm a disappointed customer and I would like all Yelpers to know about this atrocious experience. I think it's blasphemous that no one cared about the poor customer service that was provided today by the restaurant as a whole."
Chris W.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,54,41,5.0,5/24/2015,Had a large event with some coworkers. About 30 of us. BJs was very accommodating and they had some great deals for large groups. We had a super time.
Cherie W.,"Evanston, IL",3,120,75,3.0,10/9/2015,Had dinner here. Good service and the salads were huge and tasty. Three of us had different salads and all very happy with them. It's a wide open environment but wasn't noisy. Nice bar and fully stocked with good brands. The menu was ridiculously thick so I can't imagine one couldn't find something to have. I'd return again.
Wendi V.,"Glendale, CA",0,3,4,5.0,1/26/2016,"BJ's in Glendale, CA is literally one of my favorite after work spots to frequent.  The food is really delicious and creative.  I hadn't been to BJ's much after having to swear off starches and sugars some years back. My favorite dish used to be the BBQ chicken pizza, but now I'm LOVING the ahi poke, Brussels sprouts, soups, kale salad and stuffed mushrooms! !  However, what keeps me coming back again and again is the stellar customer service at the bar. I simply can't say enough about them! Jade, Kevin, Kelley, Jessie, and Erin are some names that come to mind for sure. They always give me super star treatment like knowing my order and where I prefer to sit. This is truly my cheers!"
Bob D.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,,1.0,7/27/2016,"Went there yesterday, a Tuesday night. Not very busy, got sat right away. Server was a nice enough guy. We'll call him M. We ordered a couple of drinks that were TERRIBLE! My girl got a bloody mary that was weak, bland and thin. I got an Alabama something that had no discernible  alcohol at all. Then we wait half an hour for our food, flag down the waiter who says that my girl's side salad has been ready but he's waiting to deliver it with the rest of our food! She says she wants it NOW and he says he'll go get it. 10 minutes later we up and leave and they have the nerve to charge us $18 for the CRAPPY drinks including a coke that never even got touched. Never got our food. NEVER GOING BACK. Probably never going to BJ's again even though we've never had a bad experience at any other location."
Diana K.,"Glendale, CA",0,15,2,5.0,1/24/2016,"This place has it all! Amazing appetizers, delicious entrées, and mouth watering desserts! Great service too! Love going here with my friends and family and I would definitely recommend it to others!"
Kristina F.,"Los Angeles, CA",13,24,3,1.0,6/20/2014,"Worst lunch ever. Arrived at 12. Ordered at 12:20 only. Got our food at 1:25. He forgot to place the order somehow. When we got the food, it was not what we ordered. When we got the check, it was someone else's. The manager came our to say that ""his grill is too small, so there is a delay"". Everyone aroumd us arrived after we did and left before we even got our food. Managers don't need to be a Douche... if you screwed up, acknowledge it AND apologize... don't tell me your grill is small."
Nayeli C.,"Costa Mesa, CA",5,15,5,4.0,12/21/2014,"Fettuccini Alfredo hit the spot with a side of pink lemonade, yum !! Came here with a couple of friends to celebrate my friends anniversary with her husband . Lots of laughs & memories we build together. It gets packed but worth the wait . Ended my dinner with a chocolate chip pazzuci. The service was great, clean location. Once your done you can walk over to the mall & do some shopping . Enjoyed my day today!"
