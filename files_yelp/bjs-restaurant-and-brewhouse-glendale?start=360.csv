S T.,"Glendale, CA",0,1,,1.0,7/17/2015,Have always loved BJ'S and their food ...so for dinner decided to go to the BJ'S in glendale ...for some reason their service lately has just become so crappy...takes over an hour and a half to get the food only to get it cold ..undercooked and was missing 2 orders.....this place needs new staff...specially cooks and waiters and a manager who can make sure the staff is working. I will never go to this bjs again.
Paul K.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,148,8,3.0,5/20/2016,Giving them an extra star because the manager here was receptive to my problems.  Thank you for reaching out to me.  I appreciate this.
Ninfa Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,12,,1.0,7/13/2015,"Never again going back! There was a hair on my food. The waitress never apologize, she barely stop by to see if we were ok. When I complain to the manager, she just snatch the receipt of his hands in front of me and my party. My friends order the pasta, it had no flavor and super watery. Horrible experience"
Mel A.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,20,1,5.0,10/11/2015,I came to eat with my friend and the waitress Tania was amazing with a great energy she knew what exactly we wanted and was very helpful
Andre W.,"Chicago, IL",419,1624,226,4.0,6/11/2012,"This seems to be a chain, but I'm not mad at it though. They make their own beer which I am always a fan of Very sporty with TVs everywhere...good stuff!"
Ferre P.,"Glendale, CA",6,31,,4.0,8/31/2014,"Great and delicious pizzas!  It's like eating a deep dish pizza! Their pizzas are crispy and freshly made! His location is spacious and has many televisions to watch most sports games. Their pizookies are too sweet but addicting. Waiters are always pleasant.  Cons: Just like many popular food chains, this may get busy at certain times of the day such as dinner.  Overall, great place to eat especially with a sporty significant other."
Gordon W.,"Glendale, CA",0,6,,2.0,11/21/2015,"This place is just so consistent in disappointing me. They have ok customer service; however, they serve low quality food.  This location in particular is the problem. I have been to a 5 star BJs and it was great.  One experience in particular was when I ordered the Chicken Alfredo. Everything was fine except the two very stale breadsticks. I kindly asked for some fresh breadsticks, and I kid you not, they brought back two bricks for breadsticks. Sadly, no one on my table had the jaw strength to eat these burnt one week old bread.  I didn't mention anything to my waitress instead laughed at my buddies trying to bit into rock hard bread.  I'll avoid this place as much as possible."
Jaz B.,"Glendale, CA",7,35,7,5.0,9/19/2015,"Last night we went out to Bj with my husband and children. Food was amazing, service was incredible thanx to a young lady name Jacklyn. She made sure all of the orders where perfect and very attentive. I was extremely appreciative of her awesome attitude and her customer service skills. Thank u for making our visit even more awesome."
Jeffrey L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,22,6,4.0,4/23/2015,"The service that Joe in the Bar gives is the best you'll find out there. He always remembers my drink order and is always quick, courteous, and friendly."
Arin B.,"Glendale, CA",12,13,,5.0,11/15/2015,"I am writing this review specifically for the service I was provided by Katie Earle. Hard work and genuine service needs to be recognized. We left very happy with the service We got, especially at such a busy time! Thank you Katie for the great service."
Allison E.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,23,11,5.0,8/24/2015,"I've been to a BJ's once before and it was fine. Just fine. Today my boyfriend and I stopped by the Glendale location because he was craving wings. We sat at the bar- the bartender Kat was AMAZING. She made the most perfect mojito (seriously I had to take a pic) we got 2 orders of HH wings and 1 of avocado egg rolls . Everything was delicious (plus with 2 HH orders 10 wings total for $8 can't beat that in LA) the wings were crispy and meaty. The avocado egg roll was yummy I don't love the sauce that comes with them I wish it was spicier and less sweet but that might just be me. Boyfriend had the pale ale it was great, Kat gave him a sample of their new IPA which they made in partnership with stone (I love stone) anyways it was an unexpectedly fantastic experience and all thanks to Kat . I would come back just to have her again! You just don't get amazing service like that in this city. Thanks Kat for being awesome !!!"
Jiana J.,"San Rafael, CA",0,7,,5.0,3/17/2016,"Stopped in for some appetizers and mid day lunch, and the service couldn't have been better. Everyone was constantly making sure all was great, our server Wendy kept a smile on her face and was very attentive and paid attention to details. The food came out in a great timely manner and was at the perfect temperature. Definitely no complaints here, recommend this place to everyone!"
Wellington C.,"Irvine, CA",459,549,69,4.0,3/13/2014,"Who would have thought that the night life in Glendale was so happening on a Saturday night.  Came here for a friends bday last week.  We did buffet style so it came out to 25 bucks a person.  Not a bad price for ayce pizza, pasta, and salad.  BJ validates parking too so you can park in the adjacent lot or you can find free parking across the street at the Glendale Galleria.  Even with a big group our service was excellent and since it was nice out last weekend, sitting out on the patio area with the heaters wasnt too bad."
Kiley Rose H.,"Los Angeles, CA",28,30,13,5.0,8/10/2015,We love sitting at the bar. Bartenders (Jesse!!) are always working hard and friendly! Honey Sriracha Brussel sprouts are craaaazy good ;)
Cheryl H.,"Burbank, Los Angeles, CA",52,49,84,2.0,6/26/2014,"Food is tasty and there are lots of choices but the service is terrible. Appetizers were delivered without plates, 5 wait staff came by multiple times, empty handed for at least 10 minutes before we were finally given plates to eat our now cold appetizer. Meal then took forever and came out in stages. Very disappointed."
jeff n.,"Los Angeles, CA",37,35,2,3.0,4/14/2015,"was ok.  the food was good. and the beer was fine.   service was very slow during a very uncrowded time of day.  waiter was distracted by any female in the place, and socializing with coworkers.  had to flag him down to get order in and another round ordered."
Karina D.,"Glendale, CA",0,2,,5.0,6/25/2016,"So enjoyed our dinner last night, Latanya, our server, was on point!  Very accommodating and so friendly.  We were a group of eight and the wait for food did take a bit but she made the wait bearable! I see many others have also left great comments for her as well.  BJ's in Glendale just needed to let you know Latanya provided exceptional service!"
Dion A.,"Glendale, CA",0,1,,5.0,5/30/2016,wow this is by far the best service I've had in a long time. my server britney was so great she was so patient and helpful. we couldn't have it any better. It was so busy and she made our dinner wonderful I will definely return and ask for her she's exactly what every busy restaurant needs to make it a happy stay!!
Linda G.,"La Cañada Flintridge, CA",0,9,,2.0,6/20/2016,"We used to eat here all the time.  We really do not enjoy waiting 1 hour+ for a table.  Yesterday we discovered that they have call ahead waiting!  Problem solved..or so we thought.  We put our name on the list and were told to come in 45 minutes.  When we showed up 45 minutes later we were told that we were number 14 on the list.  There could not have been more than 13 parties there waiting to be seated.  What's the point?  We waited for quite awhile and then left.  We went to CPK upstairs, which never has much of a wait.  Sorry BJs, you'll need to do better to get us back."
