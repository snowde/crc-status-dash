Karina G.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,6,1,3.0,4/11/2015,"The food is good, as well as their beers. What makes this a 3 star restaurant instead of a 4 for me is the service. I had to wait like 15 minutes after I was seated for my order to be taken."
Arpi G.,"Glendale, CA",2,12,1,4.0,10/9/2015,"It's a very good Resturant with high quality foods very friendly customer service,but very noisy place."
Kat S.,"Highland Park, Los Angeles, CA",139,7,,5.0,7/15/2014,So this is my first review on yelp ever and I had to do so because out bartender Cameron is by far the best!! I asked him to make a drink I love and he perfected it with flying colors!! Watermelon mint gin and tonic :) Thanks Cameron!!!  P.s that hair tho!!
Stefani C.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,10,3,5.0,9/27/2015,Armand A was a fantastic server! I would request him every time. He was very helpful in every question we asked. We never have been here for brunch and the food was good. The bloody Marys were really yummy. The best will will always be Armand.
Hailey Z.,"Glendale, CA",301,626,508,2.0,3/25/2012,"I got a nasty ""compliment"" from someone that I know is friends with the waitress that I am referring to in my review below. I have taken this waitresses name off my review just to appease her, but I think it's lame that someone that I'm sure works at this BJs that knows this waitress to write someone regarding my review. Regardless if someone is a single mom or had a bad day, you need to leave your drama at home and work your hardest to get through it. Yelp is a public forum for people to write about their good and bad experiences. If I have to mention an employees name to steer consumers away from that person so they can have a better experience than I did, then I will do that. Here is my redone review: Would have given this place more stars had we had a better waitress. To all who dine here, stay away from _______(name withheld because someone was upset that a name was mentioned). She is the worst waitress alive, would disappear, lacked major communication skills and just flat out had the stink eye the entire time and her attitude sucked. Never saw one smile come to her face, she never wrote anything down and anytime we'd ask for something she wouldn't even acknowledge us. Asking for refills was the worst, we'd ask and she wouldn't even acknowledge that we asked, she'd just come back 10 minutes later and would just fill up our glasses, without even smiling, no your welcome, nothing.  I'm not a fan of the Burbank location and now I'm really not a fan of this place. The parking here sucks just as bad as Burbank too. Free 90 minutes. At the rate our waitress was going, we were just 15 minutes over 90 minutes. For some reason we owed $5.50 in parking for those extra 15 minutes. I'm done coming to this area in Glendale. ****I would also like to add that this review was not powered by the fact that I didn't get a smile with my refill like the angry complimenter had stated, it was because she was a rude person that day that didn't take the time to see if we needed anything else after she dumped the food on our table. Everything she did was done with attitude. What makes you think I would want to go back there and have her as a waitress after that experience?"
Dhiraj P.,"Glendale, CA",0,2,13,5.0,9/20/2015,I always have a nice experience. Their top shelf margarita is bomb..martini oh.. wings to Pizookie Trio that makes any day very special..
Chris F.,"San Fernando Valley, CA",120,54,11,2.0,1/7/2015,At least they are consistent with the other locations I've been to. The service here sucks also. Took forever to get my water refilled and for our pizookie to come out  (32 minutes) on a Tuesday night.
Ren L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,,4.0,6/6/2016,"Had a great time at BJs. My friends and i thoroughly enjoyed our meals and appetizers. The avocado eggrolls were scrumptious with a nice tangy complementary dipping sauce. My friends had huge burgers that they loved, and i had the deep dish pizza, which was over the moon! The beers on tap were also a great complement to our food.  Our server was really nice to. Anyone who cards me deserves a gold star!  But the downside, and major downer it was, were the desserts. The monkey bread was good, but tasted something similar i made with Pillsbury crescent rolls! The beignets are New Orleans, French style donuts. Deep fried, tasty goodness.. usually. These were not even donuts, but a sourdough dinner roll dipped in sugar!! I was appalled! How can they call it something it's not! It's wasn't even a donut! I would've been happy with just a glazed donut, if they wanted to pass it off for a beignet, but seriously that was the worse excuse for a dessert, let alone the wrong definition of something it's trying to be!"
Keely G.,"Los Angeles, CA",797,262,55,2.0,6/14/2012,"Been here a few times (it's close to the office) and it's been pretty good -- decent lunch specials, etc., however I'm going to have a helluva time convincing my co-workers to ever step foot in there again after yesterday. So, we walk in and it's not busy at all (except for the bar where a soccer game is on). Our waiter comes right over and asks if we are ready to order our drinks and food. Whoa buddy, although I appreciate the enthusiasm, we literally just sat down, can you give us a minute to view the menu? Here's where it all went downhill. FRY-GATE. We ordered our entrees, along with a side of thin fries. Impossible to screw that up right? Wrong. Their first attempt came out cold and NOTE TO BJ's: shoestring fries should be somewhat crispy, not like soggy actual shoe stings. Next attempt: Still not hot and still soggy as hell. So fed up, we ask to try the thick fries. Next attempt: As I type this I'm still waiting, because they never came. Our food arrives... Mine was the chicken quesadilla which was ok -- stingy on the chicken and cheese and was not really filling at all. We tell our waiter that the fries never came and he goes to check on them... Instead of coming back with the fries, he asks us if the manager came by... All 3 of us say in disgusted unison: ""No"". Off he goes to get the manager.... The manager never comes... Instead our waiter asks if we'd like a pizookie. Since we are still eating and since we are pissed and waiting on a manager who would never come, we assumed that the manager didn't want to deal with the situation, so he authorized this peace offering, which we accepted. Lo and behold when the bill comes, we are charged for the pizookie!! Wtf! We see the manager across the room and try to wave him down. He ignores us. Meanwhile, we just want our check so we can get the hell out of there, but now our waiter is M.I.A... Naturally! After about 10 minutes we see him with his only other table and flag him down...10 more minutes for him to charge the cards and bring them back.  We left hungry, feeling ripped off, annoyed and were late for our meeting. No bueno BJ's. P.S. I'd probably give only 1 star, but that Pizookie was damn good."
Maryet A.,"Glendale, CA",1,8,3,5.0,1/29/2015,We had a great family time on Wednesday noon. Jiana was so friendly and nice. She makes our kids happy. Thanks Jiana.
Sophia C.,"Los Angeles, CA",306,756,83,3.0,2/17/2012,"Came here for a late Friday afternoon lunch with a friend. Place again was mellow and we weren't  surprised that it was only a handful of people. Our waitress Tania (spelling?) was absolutely perfect, always checking on us if we needed anything from lemons for our waters to asking if our food was ok every 10-15 minutes.  Their lunch menu selection is fair, and the prices start at $5.95 and up. I ordered the half chicken baked potato with a ceasar salad. The salad was huge portion for lunch, and the 1/2 baked potato wasn't anything small. I was genuinely full from my meal, while my friend enjoyed a turkey burger and he enjoyed it.  And what, beers during lunch time start at $3.50? That would have came in very handy at a stressful job I had down the street back in the hey days if BJ's existed that long ago."
Chandler P.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,38,39,2.0,7/5/2014,Food is just okay never good and always like blah. Blah I'm eating subpar good..the beer saves the experience.. Had the enlightened turkey sandwich low quality but the price was right at 8.95 but I'm not totally sold on the quality. My friend had the bbq not interesting was informed..the service again was dicey..if your giving more than two/three stars your crazy..
Kimberly F.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,,2.0,7/25/2015,The food was great and came to my table fast but the service was horrible! The waiter hasn't checked on our table asking if we wanted a check or a refill. He didn't even acknowledge us and we are right by the kitchen. Even though it was a busy Saturday night the waiters should check up on their tables at least once!
Daniele G. L.,"Tampa Bay, FL",65,28,4,4.0,5/16/2014,"Went to BJ's Restaurant & Brehouse last week - and I have to say that I always enjoy to go to them!! While it was packed but the service was fast paced so we did not had a long wait.. 20 min... We got a booth that we needed so that our little one can play!! We got a nice entrance, which was very good as usual and then a nice juicy burger! - Off course we had to end with their specialty dessert!! In all we had great time!!"
Grace E.,"Marina del Rey, CA",27,79,34,2.0,6/5/2015,We (friends and family) used to frequent this joint quite a bit...in my book this place is ideal for any sports event! Although the service is rather quick I say that because your food will come out right away but the staff are NOT friendly at all. I guess the guys in the kitchen deserve the tip not the servers.
Kevin W.,"Glendale, CA",0,5,,5.0,9/26/2015,"Service is usually 99% always good. Food can range from ""ok"" to ""wow!"", depending on the day and which chefs are working. Many different dishes to choose from (Mexican, Italian, Southern, Mediterranean, Thai, etc.). Decent prices."
Steve J.,"Glendale, Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,1.0,2/19/2014,The pizookie is the only good thing out of this place.   Service was absolutely horrible. This is the 2nd time i have gone to this one and i will not go back. The one in Burbank is no better.  They messed up my girlfriends order not once but twice and when i spoke to the manager they said they were sorry and will address it. Hey how about comping her food since ahe waited 35 mins. She just didn't want the sauce on her item but they continued to do it so ended up ordering something completely different. Bad service.
Karen A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,1,5.0,5/19/2016,"I came in for dinner on Sunday night and we had such great service! Our waiter was Adrian and he was so kind, attentive, and answered all of our questions regarding the food with no hesitation. I definitely recommend him. Thank you once again, we will definitely come back!"
Alex G.,"Burbank, CA",1,17,1,1.0,5/19/2016,"This location is seriously in need of some help. Horrible service, horrible food quality. It wasn't this bad before. The food quality has gone to ground level. Service was horrible, the hostess there was texting, the food was bad, the beer taps were out, I don't even know how they're open to be honest. Complete waste of time and money.  I WILL NEVER EVER STEP FOOT IN HERE AGAIN. There's so many other mom and pop places that serve amazing food and provide excellent service."
Nancy T.,"Los Angeles, CA",47,44,55,3.0,8/30/2013,"Started off with four stars, ended dinner with four stars, but left the parking structure with a two star experience... It's a Friday night so I understand that they were busy (plus the Dodgers were kicking serious ass).. Our waitress Geray was a sweetheart, even under pressure. She even hooked us up with two free mini pizookies (yum). I ended up giving her a little more for tip because she was obviously trying her best despite the back up in the kitchen. So thank you Geray!!  Here's where it took a turn.. My husband and are walked to our car, which was parked in the structure on Broadway. When we had arrived there was a Honda Accord parked kind of funny, totally out of the marked space and DIAGONAL and the people were just chillin!! Well, when we returned to our car after dinner, the people who were inside the car were standing outside, smoking and drinking.. I looked over quickly and it turned out to be a cook and waitress from BJ's!! The pair both proceeded to return to work, finishing their cigarettes, and the waitress had a glass of BJ's beer in one hand!! I know it's none of my business if they were doing it in the car during their break but geesh!! Drinking during your shift? Don't forget to button up your shirt honey!!"
