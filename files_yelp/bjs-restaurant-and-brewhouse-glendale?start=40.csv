Lynn V.,"Irvine, CA",30,223,197,5.0,11/14/2017,"We came here for Veteran's Day. Mark was our server. Great guy, awesome service. This place really takes care of it's Veterans. I was treated ""thee best"" by far from all the other restaurants and their promotions or no Veteran's Day promotion restaurants. I ordered a steak and potatoes meal with a cold beer and dessert and paid $4 total, $7 with tip. I highly recommend this location for anyday. They treat you like they want to be treated. Thanks guys, you rock!"
Armine K.,"San Diego, CA",15,2,3,1.0,11/25/2017,"Checked in at 7:30 and they said the wait time is 30 min, however we had to wait 48 min to be seated. After waiting all that time, waiter was. It very polite and was not even paying attention when we were ordering. We had to ask for a water twice  so frustrating. Next table was seated 10 min after us, they are eating already and we still don't have even our appetizers.  We have been here before and we were happy, I guess they have to do a better job training the waiters. Bdw it's 9:02 still waiting for our food."
Kevin M.,"Los Angeles, CA",211,13,,5.0,9/24/2017,I've never gone to a BJ's until I moved to California and since my first visit it has become one of my favorite restaurants.  I am a huge fan of hard ciders and their Berry Burst cider is top of the line. I also highly recommend their Brussel sprouts appetizer and the guacamole deluxe burger. When my family visited in October I brought them here and we all had a wonderful time. Every visit is a pleasure.
David B.,"Sunland-Tujunga, CA",1,13,9,5.0,12/5/2017,"Watching Lear of champions, chicken tortilla and half of flat bread just got the spot"
Esther T.,"Glendale, CA",0,2,,3.0,1/8/2018,jambalaya is a plate of chili powder over rice yuck...chicken potstickers were delish
Garry N.,"Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",1,8,,5.0,12/3/2017,"This is one and of the best restaurants in glendale, I really like their  baby back ribs. They also have great selection of draft beer. We go there with my family and we always get great service with smile. The parking there is not  very convenient but that's probably one and only disadvantage. They also do take  out and on Thursday they have specials. Cozy patio outside, sports  bar with large screen tvs, great food and drinks,and great atmosphe.I recommend this restaurant to everyone."
Adam F.,"Glendale, CA",99,50,157,4.0,11/15/2017,"BJ's is great! I've only had one somewhat poor experience, and it was largely due to a friendly (but very unattentive) server. He forgot about us more than once, but overall he was a friendly guy. The atmosphere is fun, the menu is extensive, and everything I've ever ordered has been delicious, not to mention their craft beers are absolutely fantastic!"
Vahan G.,"Glendale, CA",634,37,101,4.0,12/21/2016,Wasnt bad at all. Food was goood Nice friendly environment but was kind of slow Over all good experience  Will be back soon
Diego L.,"Burbank, CA",0,7,,5.0,12/27/2017,great atmosphere awesome crew really good food  is super busy so make sure to order a drink while you wait for the food!
Victoria O.,"Van Nuys, CA",38,132,164,3.0,6/21/2016,"Today was free pizookie day when you spend $10 so we just randomly decided to go. It wasn't too packed and our food came at a pretty normal time, yeah we did wait but not long enough to complain.  Our server was pretty nice, he gave us 2 free pizookies instead of one, not really going to give out a name incase a manager reads this and fires him or whatever since it was only 1 pizookie per table.  The food was pretty ok, not too bad and not too good. It's just like a whatever place. The prices are pretty good too."
Alaina V.,"Los Angeles, CA",31,27,1,1.0,12/26/2017,"I waited for the manager to follow through before I posted  this review of our horrible visit last week. While I can understand that the night we visited was very busy that does not excuse the lack of quality of the food, lack of cleanliness and unfortunate lack of service. Our table of 8 was sat fairly quickly and then for two plus hours we endured a fair number of just ridiculous errors. Food and soups were served cold (not even warm); wine glass served with lipstick marks then brought back with obvious marks where those lipstick marks were wiped away. The calamari appetizer was brought out - with the waitress explaining that the portion was much smaller than usual but we could keep it if we wanted to.  One of the kid meals was missing fries and I kid you not - they brought out a plate of fries in record time - and upon inspection by the child - there was ""stuff"" on the fries like it was from someone's else's meal or order - god forbid from someone's plate after they were done! The pace of service was unfortunate - and our waitress was very nice and apologetic. The only good parts of the night were the adult entrees - thank goodness!  Had the manager followed up by now I would have been satisfied, but unfortunately he did not. I would not recommend this BJs location."
Olympia L.,"Hayward, CA",240,9,,2.0,11/9/2017,"Just had lunch here. Thank you Pamela and Luke (front desk) for being so helpful. I have visited a few times before today and felt that although they were not busy at the time, my previous waiters were not very attentive. They actually almost made me late getting back to work from my lunch break, which was pretty annoying. My 2 star rating is solely based upon those previous experiences. The Snickerdoodle pizookie is available again though (seasonal), so I guess I have a reason to continue visiting... for now lol."
Matthew P.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,9,,2.0,12/19/2017,"The service was good, but the food was quite zezveli. Ive eaten zibil that tasted better than the kaki ktor pasta I've had. I can see why this restaurant attracts lots of chobans from the gyux."
Love G.,"Henderson, NV",78,55,64,3.0,1/5/2017,"I've been to this BJ's location quite a few times since I live near the area and it wasn't too busy/packed at all tonight. Of course the service was a bit slacking, we weren't greeted by our server until 10-15 minutes later, another 10 to get water, etc.. I mean, I get it if it's extremely busy and I understand that they have other customers to attend to.  Food was great - I had the chicken Cobb salad and also got a chocolate chunk pizookie which was yummy."
Oscar M.,"Mid-City, Los Angeles, CA",0,10,6,1.0,3/5/2017,"Came here for my bday with family. I'm going to spare you from how I really feel with explicit words, instead I'll just keep it PG. It took a bit over 2 hours from the time we were seated to us getting our food. They blamed it one one of the plates being cooked ""well done"" ..what?!  After complaining to the manager she disappeared (I'm guessing to the kitchen to help them cook it) because 20 mins later our food came out. I noticed the people that were waiting at the lobby with us were also getting up talking to the manager about their crappy service. Food was warm and very dry, heat lamp dry.  Anyway we got some of the food comped and we left . A bit over 3 hours was our experience at this establishment . I'm sticking to the olive garden. Sorry BJ'S you blew it."
Luther D.,"Pasadena, CA",4,13,,1.0,5/31/2017,"Other than being in a great location, I think this was the first BJ's experience that made me say ""Not this one."" Maybe because its all the same company, no one will care, but I will go on record for those who actually spend their money to expect more from what I this particular location offers.  Let me paint the picture if I may: Its a Tuesday (yesterday) and I walk in behind a 3 people in a group. Behind my party of 2 is 2 other parties. One party of 2 and another party of 1.  We all stand in the lobby waiting for someone to come greet us.  No one around. We all stood there for several minutes before one guy behind me proceeded to the table area to find someone who could seat the parties.  The young lady comes to the front with a look on her face like WE were bothering her. Like she was just there to get a check and did not feel like seating anyone. With no eye contact, she proceeds to tell each party that the wait would be five minutes. Now I must add that from a human perspective, its hard to believe that its going to take ANY time to seat these parties because you could see approximately 12 tables with no one seated. I mean, it looked empty.  But whatever. Now mind you, the couple behind me was a party of 2, but for some reason, whatever it may be, the young lady sat them before us. Why? I dont know, but I felt like that was kinda rude considering we were first. But whatever. Our server did his job....The first time. Not the second...or third. What do I mean? I mean he literally took our order and we never saw him again. Someone else brought our food and he never stopped by to check on our table. NOT ONCE. No water refills. No ""Is the food ok?"" Nothing. But again, for some reason, he made it a point to stop at the table behind us twice during their meal. Did I stink? Because I swore I was clean.  The ribeye was prepared properly. The broccoli looked like baby broccoli. The creamed corn was probably the best of the meal next to the one glass of strawberry lemonade that I had.  As I went to the bathroom, I overheard one guy at another table say ""he had been waiting over 10 mins and no service...WTF?"" But what was interesting was as I continued my walk to the bathroom, I saw 3 servers standing near a POS machine talking and laughing and another server in awe of the NBA highlights on the screen. yea...4 people, not doing their job.  Im very big on service. Food is a close 2nd but service first. The people working here dont seem like bad people. Just people that should not be in the service industry."
Rusann I.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,22,11,3.0,2/6/2017,"Service was great, the wings were bland, a bit cold, and too breaded. I wish I ordered something different. Our desert took too long to come out and it was a little undercook( raw dough )"
Clarence V.,"Los Angeles, CA",191,58,50,4.0,10/18/2017,I love their pazookies and their mushroom burgers. My friends always come here to get drinks and they always enjoy the atmosphere here when watching games and hanging out. It's a pretty good spot to just hang outa and get some good grub to eat and rink.
Thomas D.,"Los Angeles, CA",350,113,495,4.0,11/3/2016,"BJs in Glendale is one of my favorites stops for food and drink. The drink menu has a varying degree of choices from hearty & filling to healthy & vegan. The have an amazing Hickory BBQ burger that's one of my top burgers in LA. If you're a meat fan you have to get it! It's packed with ground beef, bacon and brisket.  This is also a cool spot to come check out a game at the bar. On my latest visit, Andrea was the bartender and did a great job with my drinks. The pazookie is another reason to come here! Nothing tops the warm cookie with a scoop of ice cream on top.  BJs is a great spot for your large events. We held a wedding rehearsal dinner here for around 30 people and it came out to around $500. They price you at about $15/person and the deal includes unlimited pizza, pasta and salad. What a steal!"
Hemang S.,"Los Angeles, CA",1346,577,433,5.0,12/4/2016,"This location is huge, even for a BJ's in Glendale. We came here with a group of around 25+ people or so about 30 minutes before closing time and were able to have a fantastic night! Outside of a little longer than normal kitchen times (due to the above, unique group and timing), the experience was a great one. They even let us do a lot of separate checks!"
