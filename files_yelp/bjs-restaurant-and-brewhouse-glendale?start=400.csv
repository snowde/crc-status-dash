Leslie C.,"North Hollywood, CA",0,28,3,5.0,9/6/2015,"This is my all time favorite restaurant ! The pizza and the deserts here are to die for. The service is very good to , the waiter that attended me was very polite and patient when I was ordering. He also mentioned different types of foods off the menu that were currently popular. Great experience coming here ! I definitely recommend to anyone that is looking to eat out !!"
Nick T.,"Glendale, CA",136,310,116,2.0,4/13/2014,"How this place remains in business baffles me with Cheesecake Factory down the street. We placed a take out order using their mobile app. because we felt like having their nachos, barbecue ranch salad, and avocado egg-rolls.  We discovered the nachos had recently been canned from the menu so when we called to cancel, the guy said he will do the nachos. Fast forward $40: Nachos: Portion size was RIDICULOUSLY small. There was hardly any cheese, no sour cream or guacamole, just a few pieces of chicken, a few beans and chopped tomatoes, some weird sauce, and that's pretty much it folks. Now that I recall, I got better nachos at Taco Bell for god's sake.  Salad: Again portion size was RIDICULOUSLY small to the point that it looked like a $5 side salad. Straw that broke the camels back was that they used iceberg lettuce....WOW. Charging more than $12 for a side salad and you couldn't use Romaine.  Avocado Rolls: They were pretty good considering the other stuff hence the reason they get an extra star.  Overall, I hadn't been to BJ's since Cheesecake Factory opened in Glendale and now I know why. Cheesecake charges about the same for the above items but you get better qualify food coupled with larger portions. Corporate needs to take a long and hard look at their food and come up with drastic changes if they want to survive."
Scott G.,"Pasadena, CA",26,129,2,2.0,4/8/2014,"Maybe I'm just getting older, or maybe this place is just getting worse.  I cannot decide.  Food is not nearly as flavorful or satisfying as I remember, staff was fairly unattentive and it was really loud in here (even for a bar setting).  I feel like I'm yelling at someone to get off my grass right now... but I feel like this chain has really gone downhill the last 5-6 years."
Ragnar The Viking C.,"Glendale, CA",3,81,,2.0,6/11/2015,"BJ's is so bland and boring, I just don't get why people even go there. Food is so mediocre, feels like you're eating manufactured corporate franchise food. OH WAIT! haha. It is a corporate manufactured franchise restaurant. The only thing they got going for them is that pazooki and bazooka or whatever they call that chocolate chip and ice cream thing. Ya that's good, but I can make that at home with some nestle cookie dough and vanilla ice cream. No biggy. The beer, wow, super overrated. It isn't that good at all. Gorden Birsch kicks it in the sacker real hard. Gorden Birsch is like the way better version of BJ's on all fronts. Bj's needs a few good sack kickings to get going here. But then again, mindless drones continue to support these boring manufactured corporate restaurants."
Jenny Y.,"CA, CA",194,508,255,4.0,3/21/2012,"Their ayce soup and salad lunch special is my fave thing to order here =))) Don't think you're limited to the salads that you see on the list, you can get a wedge or a the mozzarella tomtato salad too =d  My 2 fave salads!  And the latter is mostly cheese anyways =D!"
Talmadge M.,"Pasadena, CA",210,208,55,2.0,3/31/2015,"I wanted to be impressed but sadly I was not.  I was hoping for a deep dish veggie pizza experience, seeing that this qualified as cheat meal in my mind.  Appetizer, cool drink selection, nice.  However, I believe our server may have been abit overwhelm seeing that my guest never received her ordered drink.  No biggie, we'll let it slide.  Then the pizza came, broke my spirit...  See ya..."
Catrina T.,"Pasadena, CA",134,33,7,3.0,12/13/2013,"The food?  It was okay.  I ordered the chicken parm and I did like it.  The chicken wasn't dry and the sauce was good.  I liked the cocktail I ordered and the selection of beers was lovely. The service staff?  Eh.  I guess they were busy and understaffed on the night we went, I don't know.  Our server gave us our drink but didn't take our order right away... didn't even ask if we were ready.  She didn't come back until 20 minutes later.  We didn't even see her walking around or else we would've flagged her down already.  But at least she knew her beers well enough. The wait?  Oh my god.  Awful.  To be seated, we had to wait 45 minutes even with a reservation.  Ordering, uh read above.  And once we placed our order, I think my hunger pangs went away by the time the food finally came to us. Overall, I might come back if I'm not ""starving"" and if me and my group will be watching a game and have dinner at the same time."
Carolyn C.,"Torrance, CA",395,116,1434,1.0,6/4/2013,"If I could give this place 0 stars, I would.  First off, today's visit has pushed me to write my first ever yelp review because it was so bad.  Coworker and I decided to come here to this branch for happy hour after a long shitty day of work. Stoked, we plan out our meal on the way there, beer included. Oh, and possibly a pizookie if we weren't too full.  Our excitement ended far too quickly when we:  1.) didn't get greeted. A ""hello, how are you?"" Would've been sufficient.  2.) our table didn't get cleaned, we had to flag someone down to clean off the table and ask for menus.  3.) took forever to take our order. 4.) food took forever to come and finally when it did...  5.) we had to ask for utensils and plates.  6.) no one came to ""check up"" on us or ask if we needed anything.  At this point, coworker and I are beginning to feel like they're probably not paying attention to us became we're minorities. Mind you, the bar area is not crowded and other tables were getting served. The food was decent, but the service really messed up my mood and appetite.  All in all, this visit to this branch was whack. I've been to other bj's locations and their service is stellar compared to these knuckleheads. We spoke to Danny, the manager during that shift, we came around 6pm-720pm. I felt sorry for the guy. His wait staff sucks. Danny did however, knock off some appetizers which brought our bill down from $32 to $22. And Lee, who I overheard was supposed to be our waiter should probably look for another job. One he's much happier with and enjoys because his work ethics in customer service sucked major balls."
Mick S.,"Glendale, CA",20,85,85,1.0,4/4/2012,"one think good i have to say about this place is probably beer. Please take look at the picture I have, there is no cheese in the Nacho and I asked for extra cheese . on top of that they charged my credit car tow times. I will give feed back when i go tomorrow talk to kristine the manager about it the charges..."
Kay K.,"Glendale, AZ",23,320,6,4.0,2/6/2014,4 stars because of their fantastic drink menu. One of the best in town.  Everyone loves the Pizooki. The rest is mediocre. Steak underperforms. Serving is bad. They don't pay attention to detail and will mess up your order. Wait times are usually 15-25 on weekends.
Jan Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",282,465,1,3.0,2/27/2012,"theres this server here that is always SUPER enthusiastic. and she's great. VERY knowledgeable, and good upseller. def an asset to the company, and the parties that are assigned to her section are lucky. HOWEVER, on other occasions, i find that i have to wait too long for soup refills (when i get the soup/salad combo), or the check takes like 30 years to come out, which is unacceptable regardless, but esp bad when you're on a time restraint (uhh like your lunch break?).  no complaints about the free pizookie that comes out on your bday though :) and their mini pizzas are good. actually so is their mac n cheese. and their tomato mozzarella salad. ok fine, im a pig and everything here is good."
Heather Alyse B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,5,5.0,4/22/2016,"Lataya B was an absolute doll!! My friend and I ordered the pizookie trio. It took longer than expected, but Lataya was very accommodating and reassuring. Very grateful we sat in her section. Thank you, Lataya!!"
Kenya A.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,16,4,1.0,11/8/2015,"The service here is bad, and the food isn't so great either. They mixed up 3 of my orders. Also, the meat didn't taste so fresh. Wouldn't recommend going to this location."
Mag M.,"Pasadena, CA",1,40,1,4.0,3/6/2015,"Love this BJ, perfect for couple, almost no wait every time when we come on a Friday night! Taylor is the best server in here as he make us feel super comfortable and enjoyable for our meal. Just enough attention to get everything you need but not overwhelming. Foods are at a consistent level. Will definitely come back again."
Nate J.,"Los Angeles, CA",56,35,4,1.0,5/11/2013,"I have been to many B.J's before but have never made it to this one until today.  We arrived at around 3:30pm and, not surprisingly, the place was rather empty.  We get seated quickly, met with a waitress quickly and order quickly.  Everything is off to a great start.  Sad thing is is went all downhill from there. We ordered an appetizer, took about 10 minutes to come.  Not bad.  We ordered 2 pasta entree's, that took another 20 minutes.  Kind of long, but I will forgive them because I was watching the game.  Girlfriend bites into her pasta, stone cold.  I bite into mine, pipping hot.  Basically this means they made hers immediately after ordering and it sat there for a good amount of time.  We grab out waitress and ask them to reheat it.  I finish my entire meal before it comes back.   At this point we have been in the restaurant about an hour and we, regrettably, order a Pazzookie.  For those who don't know what that is, its this ungodly amazing dessert where they serve an under cooked cookie in a pan covered in melting Ice Cream.  This is where something very peculiar happens.  Earlier a different waiter than the one we ordered from brought our food to the wrong table.  I note this because 10 minutes after our dessert order the same waiter brings a single small Pazzokie to the table behind us and they say they didn't order it.  He acts surprised and says you must have gotten a free dessert.  They said thank you and he went on his way.   15, 20, 25 minutes go by, no dessert.  Then all of a sudden a third person comes to our table and says he was sent over to see if we needed anything else.  He acted like we had been sitting their too long and we were an annoyance to him.  Let me note the place was still only about half full.   To stop this review from becoming a book, the service was horrible.  Other than our actual waitress, every one was rather rude.  It took us over an hour and a half to have our meal in a place that was half empty and pumps out mainly pre made food. I would suggest NO ONE to go to this B.J.'s.  Go a few more miles to the one in Burbank."
Angel F.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,58,19,3.0,4/11/2015,"Food is really good! But the service here is kind of slow. Yeah, there are some good servers but only a few. I had to wait more than 15 minutes for the server to take my order. The place is not even packed, if that was the case, then I would understand."
Arsen A.,"Glendale, CA",23,10,1,2.0,11/1/2013,"Both service and food were mediocre.    We went there Friday evening,  place wasn't that busy, yet it took 15 minutes for us to get our drinks. The appetizer arrived before waiter had a chance to bring the plates. By the time plates arrived food got cold. Overall food quality was low. It seemed that our food was heated, rather than cooked."
Selene C.,"Los Angeles, CA",146,15,10,5.0,2/26/2015,My husband and I love coming to this place and today the service was better than other days. Our server today was Tania and she had excellent customer service. Thanks.
Zareen A.,"Glendale, CA",5,16,2,4.0,8/28/2015,"I would've given this place 5 stars cause I love coming here but last night this bartender/associate named JAMES was being extremely rude and had a nasty attitude towards me and my date for no reason, letting his ""rough day"" and personal emotions affect the way he acts in his work environment. We also witnessed him being rude to another co worker of his named Pam. Upon saying thank you kindly & exiting the restaurant, he mumbled under his breath ""never come back"" even though we did absolutely nothing to him and minded our own business just enjoying our date with a light conversation. JAMES was a total jerk and when I asked him to repeat what he said, he threatened to call GPD lol as if they would have a reason to detain me. He was such a defensive liar and rude bar tender. He even wanted to get his day over with so bad that he served us a second round of our drink when we didn't even ask for it yet and he ended up having to pour it out because we told him we didn't ask for it. On the other hand, SAMANTHA/SAMMY is the sweetest and always has a smile on her face at work, she's the best! (: So go find her, and AVOID JAMES THE GRUMP."
Edgar M.,"Glendale, CA",159,34,35,1.0,11/20/2014,"I should say that the food and mixed drink quality went down. Yesterday I had grilled Atlantic Salmon, now we all know that salmon is fish and should Tate like it. Duh! For some reason my fish tasted like steak and hamburger. Which brings me to the second conclusion, whoever is in the kitchen either they don't clean their grill or don't have separate grills for steak, burger, and fish or poultry, which many of big size restaurants like BJ's do or suppose to have."
