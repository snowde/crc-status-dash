Mimi A.,"Glendale, CA",313,70,25,5.0,1/30/2014,"Honestly...I've been here way too many times to count and I will continue to come here until they close down or something.  First of all they have almost anything anyone could want from burgers to pasta to the most delicious sandwiches and pizzas.  The beers are awesome, especially the darker ones, and they have excellent service. We'll the service is almost always better at dinner time than for lunch.  I've only had a bad experience with the food and it not being what I ordered but they quickly took care of it and there I was happy again.. Haha  Do not leave without the pizookie!"
Jasmine G.,"Glendale, CA",53,8,11,5.0,10/6/2013,Lord help me the fettuccine Alfredo is amazing with the cheesebread I couldn't stop eating it the portions are huge and the bread is just to perfect bjs also has a very big selection my all time favorite thing about it is the pizookie which they're famous for if you haven't tried it you are missing out big time well done bjs *tyga voice*
Violy M.,"Los Angeles, CA",973,258,1740,4.0,3/12/2009,"I'm giving this place props...don't get it twisted and feel the need to dine at a bj's near your hood...only the one in GLENDALE. I've gone to the one in burbank & woodland hills but they can't step. Everyone is nice here, the deep dish pizza is bomb, I always take it with ranch on the side. You can get full off the soup n salad combo they have. Oh! save room for the  pizookie and worry about how you're gonna ""work it off"" later...  I give it: 4 stars Your Homegirl, Violy"
Candice M.,"Los Angeles, CA",33,49,27,5.0,2/2/2014,"Great atmosphere!!!  Too big of a menu to choose from, though.... Love the staff!!  Love their pizzooki !!  Do ask the staff for the specials..."
Hannah U.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,3,1,3.0,4/12/2015,"The food was good, the service was not. Went with a group of six a couple nights ago and waited almost 30 minutes for 2 main dishes and one appetizer to come out. The waiters barely came to our table and was a struggle to call their attention. Other than that the food was very tasty."
Sue M.,"Glendale, CA",9,32,9,3.0,3/14/2015,"Okay, so I really wished I could give this place 5 stars but in all honesty it really is just average. Their service isn't outstanding nor is it bad. Nothing about this place really ""wows"" me. It simply is they don't do anything to piss me off. Things come out in a decent amount of time and it simply is a hit or miss with certain orders but never to the point where I want to throw this back at the chef and tell him I'd rather eat dog food. This place is mainly my ""safe bet"" when I just want to go out to somewhere decent to sit and have some french fries with a nice drink and not have any drama. The price is good, the service is good, and the food is good...just none of these are great. Still I will always come here when I just want a bite to eat that isn't Mcdonalds."
Veronica B.,"Shadow Hills, CA",22,14,2,3.0,4/8/2014,The food would be 5 stars because its delicious. But the service was awful. I went for lunch time. We wanted to sit outside because the weather is so beautiful. The waiter took a long while to come out. We ordered drinks and food at the same time. I got my food before my beverage!  Our waiter kept disappearing and kept forgetting to bring stuff.  I love BJs food but the service at this location especially during lunch time is horrible.
Kimberly S.,"Glendale, CA",0,4,,1.0,6/16/2015,"Dropped into my local BJ's to have a BBQ chopped chicken salad and a beer. Service was fantastic, and the food tasted good. I asked for a box to take half of my salad home. And.........the plate was cracked in three places. Looked like a peace sign. Not a chip from the side, but dark cracks across the entire white plate. Dark enough to tell me that this was not the first time this cracked and bacteria ridden plate had gone from the kitchen to a customer. I thought I would be sick at the table. The manager, Roger, offered to make me a new salad to go. I declined, as that was not the point I was trying to make. I'm a trained chef, and a private caterer. I've been in the food industry for over 30 years. I've taken all the classes on serving safe food. I'm questioning whether the BJ's kitchen crew has been trained in safe food service."
Varduhi N.,"Glendale, CA",1,81,3,1.0,2/20/2016,"Service- BAD. Even the manager's service was not good. We came here with 4 ppl and sat outside. The waiter barely showed up at all to check on us. 40 minutes after ordering our food, we had to walk out to try to find him to ask for our food. Even when we got the manager envolved, it stil took over 15 minutes to get our apetizers.  It was already over an hour we were there and still no sign of our refills of our drinks. We told the manager and it took him 20 minutes to bring the beverage. He brought it when we were paying the bill. We were in a rush so we didnt even get to finsh the second round of drinks that we ended up paying for.  Both the manager and the server did not even apologize. The manager was acting upset at his server, but his manners and service was just as bad and they made us feel like we were rude for complaining.  It was a very unpleasant dinner experience... Probably I will not be going back there anytime soon."
Philip C.,"Antioch, CA",0,30,1,1.0,6/10/2015,The waitress that served me was rude and did not provide me good customer service. The avocados also were rotten and I did not complete my meal. I called the general manager and asked if he can accommodate me for my displeasure and he told me no. I find this unacceptable considering I am apart of a large cohort of business professionals and we generally are not treated this way. I am a good paying customer and tip well. Here is a tip for any wealthy people: do not go here.
Arina O.,"Burbank, CA",186,101,38,3.0,12/11/2013,"The food never tastes bad. No matter what I get, whether it is the chicken parmesan sandwich or the pasta or the green beans, it all tasted delicious, but their service is slow. it takes forever to be seated most nights, and the food is usually 20 minutes or 30 minutes late. The waiters are most of the time great to have conversations with, but it takes forever to get food"
Yanelly H.,"Glendale, CA",0,7,,4.0,6/4/2015,I love this place totally going to this place for my birthday. Try the pazoki it is so good hot cookie with cold vanilla ice cream on top.
Sahand F.,"Bellevue, WA",52,36,9,4.0,4/19/2015,"I frequent this location quite often on my lunch breaks. Bar service is always quick and friendly. Pablo is the man! Food is good, I usually order the same few items. I just wish the food was a little more consistent. Sometimes it's on point, other times it leaves more to be desired. Love me some Hopstorm IPA. Pizookies are a great way to intake 2000 calories in 5 minutes."
Susanna A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,2,1.0,9/22/2015,So this being one of my favorite place to go to with kids not anymore. I ordered the only thing on the menu without onions and they brought it out 2 times with onions in it. Horrible
Briana G.,"Glendale, CA",1,20,,2.0,5/26/2014,"The quality of the food doesn't seem fresh. It just seems Meh.  Every time that I decide to dine here, I always end up waiting for at least 15 minutes before a waiter/waitress decides to come to the table and take my order. They also have a loyalty program now and the waiters seem to push you into signing up for it, which is uncomfortable."
Karina A.,"Gardena, CA",0,2,2,5.0,2/26/2016,I went with my boyfriend and we got sat imidietely. Our food came extremely quick and it was delicious! The managers were super nice and the macadamia pozookie was the best!
Sharon S.,"Cypress Park, Los Angeles, CA",6,10,5,5.0,3/8/2014,"I've been here a couple of times. I usually get the chicken fries steak which is always delicious, it's only $10 and it's a BIG portion. The last time I got the jumbalaya was okay. The service at this location is also great. My favorite dessert, hands down is the Pizooki"
Barbara F.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,18,,5.0,3/4/2015,This is the best food. I always want to go here on date night and order the honey crisp chicken salad! It is delicious. It has a great variety and everything u try is good. It can get a lil loud on nights where a good game is on. But the environment can also be very fun. Great for group outings too!
Michael S.,"Glendale, CA",0,1,,4.0,5/16/2015,"Since I created this account to report another separate issue elsewhere, I wanted to add some positivity. I have an exquisite experience here every single time I come through. The service is quick and friendly. The food is always fresh and delicious.  Keep up the good work, people!"
Jack S.,"Glendale, CA",0,3,,2.0,5/16/2015,"I came here with my family and girlfriend last weekend. We ordered bread and the rolls with guacamole as an appetizer. We ordered sauces for our guacamole rolls and it took about 20 minutes just for sauce! That's unbelievable. By the time the sauces came, our rolls were cold. But the food was really good. I definitely prefer the Islands next door."
