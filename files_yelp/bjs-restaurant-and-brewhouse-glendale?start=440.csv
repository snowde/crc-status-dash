Allen F.,"Burbank, CA",0,8,1,1.0,6/11/2015,"I ordered a half pound burger, they brought me a quarter Pound ""brewhouse"" burger (much smaller) when I told them to bring me the correct burger they did but they had an attitude about it, when my correct burger arrived the meat was burned and had a burned/bitter taste.. I was there to celebrate my birthday but ended with a bad experience, food was OK at best. First time at BJs never going back."
Rod D.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,234,7,4.0,12/19/2014,Great location. Standard BJ quality. Love their pan style pizzas -- the tomatoes they use are amazing.  Spinach dip is always a favorite. Service was quick and friendly.
Vince N.,"Los Angeles, CA",793,14,,5.0,11/15/2014,I came here with my daughter and nephew. And the waitress Tanya our time here beyond wonderful!! My kids love her. And she is truly amazing.  Bj's needs more people like her.  I will always ask for her whenever I come here and I advice everyone to do the same. Thank you Tanya!!!
Randy B.,"Westlake Village, CA",4983,2338,4473,4.0,10/20/2012,"Went last night with a long-time bud, Tony M., who's also a new Yelper -- and I had 2 items worth noting: Pumpkin Ale and the BBQ Chicken Chop Salad.  OMG on both.  BJ's features of course, great pizza and brews...but I love, love, love their BBQ Chicken Chop salad...even more than CPK! I hadn't been to a BJ's for a very long time, and the first time at this location.  I liked it!  It was buzzing on a Friday night at 9pm and quite loud.  They offer validation for up to 2 hours of free parking in the structure (located just behind the restaurant, and shared with CPK and Islands).  They sat our party of 2 right away, yay, because I was starvin' Marvin. Nice thing, it's a couple of blocks away from the Americana, so you don't have to deal with that craziness (unless you like that sort of thing).  It has a nice outdoor patio area along Brand, with TV's and heat lamps. Nick, the server, was very nice, attentive, and funny.  As Arnold says, ""I'll be back."""
Ano M.,"La Crescenta-Montrose, CA",29,84,71,3.0,8/1/2015,"Our waiter was really nice and polite; he kept coming by our table every 5-10 minutes to make sure everything was okay. The BBQ chicken salad was really soggy and watery. The lettuce was stuck together and looked brown and slimy. There was very little of the other ingredients, it was practically a giant ball of lettuce that looked like it was glued together. The chicken in the salad was bland and had no taste. My friend got the BJ's Brewhouse burger and she's lactose intolerant so she asked our waiter if there's any cheese in the burger and our waiter said no. Her burger comes and she eats half of it before she realizes something tastes off. We took her burger apart and saw that there was shredded melted cheese melted onto both of the buns. We specifically asked if there was any cheese in the burger and our waiter said no, it wasn't written on the menu either that there was shredded melted cheese on the bun. We tell our waiter that her burger had cheese in it and he said there isn't supposed to be any cheese in there. He was apologetic and offered to bring her a new burger but by then we were all done with our food and weren't going to wait another 20 minutes for them to remake her burger. We thought that he would take it off our bill since she didn't eat half of it and they put cheese in it when there wasn't supposed to be any in there. But he didn't take it off the bill. The food was mediocre but the service was really good."
John P.,"Glendale, Los Angeles, CA",0,11,16,4.0,3/8/2014,There is a reason they call Appetizers Appetizers.. 15minutes in and still no App... Lets see.. Ok app comes in right after I posted review... Tastes good... This place is definitely need some management... I would say pretty average place for the size of this restaurant.
Prashant L.,"Glendale, CA",0,37,1,5.0,3/8/2015,So far so good. Ordered pizza and pasta for family and its tasting good. No issues with service so far.
Debra O.,"Whittier, CA",75,39,10,5.0,9/13/2014,This review is strictly for Tonya. Unfortunately she only helped us while our server was on break. SHE WAS GREAT!!! She was nice and it felt as if we were guests at her house. Thank you!! I miss you already!
Neil G.,"Los Angeles, CA",1011,552,1147,2.0,10/6/2010,"The place looked excellent, the ambiance is sports bar chic, however, the service sucks, waiting for a server longer than 10 minutes is not my thing.  Aside from getting good food, We go to places like this to relax, enjoy and get the service we expect but the BJ's serving crew seem to have better things to do rather than what they were supposed to do...The food was great but first impressions last.  Disappointing."
Pm M.,"Sacramento, CA",0,2,,1.0,4/14/2015,"I am really dissatisfied with the rib eye. It was extremely dry, wasn't cooked correctly,  and overall just didn't taste good.  The service was slow especially for it being not very crowded.  I guess basing my experience on other BJs I would have expected better.  My strawberry lemonade made this review worth the one star."
Martin D.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",2,5,,4.0,4/14/2015,It was couple months ago when we (7 of us) stopped by BJ's to watch Super Bowl as it is one of the bars that was closest to the hotel we were staying while we were traveling for work. The bar is actually quite spacious and there were big TV screens that really allowed you to watch the game quite well.
Travis G.,"Los Angeles, CA",36,10,,2.0,6/6/2013,"Took about an hour or so for our food to come-   the server could have at least explained what happened. I called BJs the next day, and the guy offered me the BJookie or whatever it is.....really????   I felt insulted-   you had a bad experience, but here's a cookie for ya. I'm worth a 'cookie' to you???"
Jim S.,"Westlake, Los Angeles, CA",2,6,,5.0,3/2/2015,"Just went to BJ's for the first time. The girlfriend and I normally go to Cheesecake Factory when in Glendale, but decided to switch it up tonight. Glad we made the switch. Our server Adrian was super friendly and made awesome suggestions. The house beers I had were quality craft brews and the food was amazing. May have been one of the better pizzas I've had in LA actually. I'll totally be back to try more dishes/beers."
JoKes O.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,,1.0,9/6/2014,"Worse customer service. Has happend twice to me and my wife here alrdy. We get seated, not extremely busy and a waiter doesnt approach us to take drink orders for 15mins. What could u possibly be doing? He is no where to be found. Im.not shocked with the medicore 3/5 stars this place has..and the food doesnt make up for the poor service.. I blame upper mgmt.."
jackie a.,"Murrieta, CA",0,31,11,1.0,1/25/2015,We got there at 2:10 in the afternoon beautiful day outside. We wanted to sit outside they said no longer seating outside strike one... My husband and I sat down 15 min before server came to order our drinks we ordered our meal when she showed up to take our drink order....25 min to get our apps they must have been sitting in the back ready for a while because they were both mildly warm strike 2...server came by to see how our food was when we were almost done eating she never made eye contact with us at anytime not even when she brought us the bill oh I forgot when we unrolled our silverware there was dried food on it strike 3!!! I've never been so dissatisfied at a BJs before.... This manager should go to the BJs in Temecula and learn how to run a restaurant right.... Oh and just so u know I give good reviews too when they are deserved ...
Lexie C.,"Pasadena, CA",63,72,66,5.0,8/4/2015,"spinach dip $5 sante de spring rolls $6 for happy hour, a good deal! achara we loved her very much, she was overloaded at the bar and she still smiled and ensured great service!  we will definitely come back to visit her! thanks!"
Christine H.,"Pasadena, CA",252,773,409,3.0,6/6/2011,The servers suck and usually get the order wrong. This place isn't as good as the other ones esp when compared to the Laguna one.   We usually get a pizza and skip the pastas and salads. Beer is a must but tell them to bring it out with the pizza cause the pizza can take a long time.
Nazeli S.,"Glendale, CA",43,120,4,2.0,2/20/2013,"I love BJ's but not this location.  The service was great.  The mahi mahi tacos were good, the pizza was bad.  It tasted good, but I had heartburn all night and the rest of the day next day and I had half of a mini pizza!  In the past when I have gotten their salads to go they give you a much smaller portion than other locations I have been to.  They're being a little too cheap.  Go to the Burbank location, it's usually better or OC."
Yousef E.,"Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",2,6,1,2.0,1/9/2014,Food is horrible. Got the salmon and it tasted like a microwave meal. My girl got pasta and it tasted old and gross. Lemonade was good tho. Not coming back
Rashmi V.,"Porter Ranch, Los Angeles, CA",1113,904,3333,4.0,12/3/2010,This has been a regular spot for my co workers and I for lunch..they got some awesome lunch specials all under $10 even less...and it's a lotttt of fooood...you can start off with a salad than get a half of a sandwich and a baked potato..and the baked potato is one hugeee suckerrrr..
