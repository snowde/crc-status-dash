Armando B.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,39,2,4.0,7/3/2015,"BJs is always a great go to place.  I usually have their Santa Fe salad, which is great.  Today I had their lunch special with a mini pizza and a Cesar salad.  Great deal for the price.  Paired with a Hefeweizen on tap and it was all good.  Service was prompt and friendly."
C. Erin B.,"Glendale, CA",14,16,12,2.0,9/14/2013,Ok my waiter was good...but the FOOD came out slow...and our mini pizza had BURNT CHEESE....
Cindy R.,"Victorville, CA",0,37,14,4.0,4/12/2015,"For the love of god never eat the lasagna here, its the worst. Like raw cheese with the tiniest amount of sauce. We always get pizza or steak which is always great. The seafood is also awesome. The bathrooms could be cleaner. Drinks are good but expensive, the Very Cider and Sangria is so good."
Claudia R.,"Milford, CT",93,677,2,2.0,5/6/2013,"I wanted happy hour on a day I got off work early so this is where we ended up.  I was totally disappointed by the nachos (where was the cheese?!?!) but the boy liked the sliders and the beer selection is pretty good. Oh wait, I just remembered that we sat at a table in the bar ano one ever came up to us.  I had to walk up to the bar for a menu...still no one...walked over to 2 people talking that looked like managers and asked if they could take my order...we had great service after that. Most likely won't be back."
Davis P.,"Glendale, CA",5,53,12,4.0,8/25/2013,"Great place to watch sporting events. They have a full bar Their pizookie is to die for I would personally recommend their pizza, especially the buffalo chicken pizza. It's spicy and really appeals to people's taste buds. Their buffalo wings are on the expensive side, ten for ten dollars (thats ridiculous) For appetizer, I would reccomend the Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps. You can have a full meal for less than twenty dollars, its a good value. Must visit! PS (Their soft drinks are a little watered down)"
Arsine K.,"Glendale, CA",29,38,11,4.0,11/2/2014,"The food here is always great. The service depends on who your waiter or waitress is. Most of them are fast and pleasant. There's a few (not naming any names lol) that don't pay attention to us after our food gets to the table or they just get really aggressive when you ask for something extra...like lemons...or ketchup. And it'll take them a good 10 minutes to bring it out. We like to sit at the bar area because there is usually no wait and you still get to order off the full menu + happy hour! They recently took some stuff off the menu and added some. One of my favorite entrees was one that didn't make the cut but every time I ask them for it, they make it. I give them 4 stars for the food, some of the service, location and cleanliness."
Devin W.,"La Crescenta-Montrose, CA",14,8,,1.0,11/23/2014,The waiters and bartenders are great here. So I'm not just some person who likes to write bad reviews. But the manager and restaurant management here is terrible. The food is sub par and the one advantage the restaurant has is the Sunday ticket. However  I literally every week have to give them instructions on how to put the game on. Very little care. I've seen managers constantly come and go and there is no consistency. Again the waiters and bartenders are great. Management is bad
Jackie H.,"Milpitas, CA",276,232,57,5.0,4/19/2013,"This has been my favorite BJ's to date.  I have to say what made it amazing was the staff that worked there. I always made relationships with them and they went the extra effort to make sure my dining experience was pleasant. HOWEVER, the service is a hit or miss and dependent on the shifts and times that you attend at BJ's.  I love this one though compared to all the others I have been to."
Michelle H.,"Los Angeles, CA",766,219,325,1.0,10/17/2012,"Um, talk about DISGUSTING and RUDE. I ordered a pasta and after a few bites in, I DISCOVERED PUBIC HAIR. *barf* My waiter came and asked me what was wrong and I showed him. And he dismissed it as EYELASH hair and it couldnt possibly be pubic hair. And i told him, FIRST OF ALL, it is like almost 2 inches long and its curly. So gross. So he called his manager over and he proposed ""would you like a new dish or a free pizookie?"" Uh.. why would I want any other dish from that kitchen that put PUBIC hair in my food? Hell no, I don't want anything else from your kitchen. So after about 5 minutes of telling him NO, he finally just took the dish off my bill....  Disgusting. Never going back. Worst manager ever."
Frances B.,"New York, NY",218,214,4,5.0,3/19/2013,"Admittedly, it's been years since I've been to BJ's. I'm not sure what has changed and what hasn't. What I do know, is that the pizza and Caesar Chicken sandwich are amazing, and the pazookies are to die for. That is all I know."
Chris K.,"Burbank, CA",0,5,,2.0,7/16/2014,"I ordered online today for my lunch break at work (7/16/2014). I ordered the enlightened turkey burger but wanted to change the side from mixed greens to a baked potato. Did it online without a problem. Set the time for pick up at 12:30. Seems simple enough... then I arrive at the place. I arrive at 12:30 as I indicated the pick up time would be. It took 10 minutes for anyone to even come help and there were servers everywhere, many of them not doing anything. Finally, when I was helped I told the person the order I had and they brought out the turkey burger with mixed greens. I told them I ordered it with a baked potato. The guy proceeded to tell me I didn't because it wasn't on the receipt or in the system when he looked it up. Funny because I still have the e-mail copy of the receipt and it clearly says baked potato. Oh and on top of the to-go container, it said ""side: potato."" When I continued to say I ordered it online and made the side a baked potato, he acted as though it was an inconvenience and told me he'd have to get his manager because it costs more. No where when I was ordering it online did it say it would cost extra to switch that. Poor service, poor online ordering system. Would not recommend this place."
Njde M.,"Glendale, CA",16,45,16,5.0,2/16/2016,5 star just for their PAZOOKIS! wow those things are so good! hot brownie with bomb ice cream - pazookiiiiii
M K.,"Canyon Country, CA",3,17,5,5.0,8/1/2015,My husband and I were so pleased with the service we received tonight! Jeremy was our waiter and he was super nice and a great server with a big smile on his face while speaking to us! Very attentive and social. We also let his manager know because he truly deserves to be recognized! Keep smiling Jeremy and thanks for a wonderful evening!
Michael G.,"Vancouver, WA",1,10,3,5.0,2/16/2014,Service is great. Love the avocado rolls with dipping sauce. Can't wait to go again! The food is good and atmosphere is welcoming.
Lani P.,"Glendale, CA",9,116,160,2.0,7/3/2013,"I had visited this branch a few times, I had good experience before with the service and the food. Unfortunately my recent experience is not so great. It is the day before 4th of July, so they should expect that the place can get packed. The receptionist was great. But the server Hector was not as friendly. It seems we felt rushed with ordering our food. I guess because he had a lot of tables to take care of.  It took ages for the food to arrive Food was inconsistent. We ordered the BJ Blue Ribbon BBQ - the ribs tasted good, but it was COLD!, the chicken was ok. We ordered the macaroni and cheese for my daughter, and i think it was undercooked, tasted bland too. We got the Pomegranate Sunset, but it was bland too, it was full of ice, did not even understand how it tasted. Hope this place shape up soon..."
Leona S.,"Los Angeles, CA",407,622,664,4.0,7/6/2012,"BJ's is a consistent chain. Whatever you get, it mostly like to be good. Like Cheesecake Factory.  The baked potatoes are always great, BBQ pizza is awesome, 5 Meats pizza is loaded with tons of goodies, crust is soft and chewy, French Dip is great too, oh and the salads....yum! BBQ Chicken salad....my favorite. And don't forget the poozoki. Chocolate chip and maybe oreos are my favorite."
Lisa F.,"TARZANA, CA",0,87,,3.0,10/20/2014,"Great lunch specials, salad particularly. This location is best out of L.A. county, its bigger, better bar area and in a great part of Glendale next to everything fabulous! Customer service is satisfactory, fast and courteous."
Elina Y.,"Jacksonville, FL",40,64,77,1.0,6/10/2014,"TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!! This  place is so not worth to spend even a dollar on it. We ordered a California burger and it tasted bad,no flavor at all,very greasy on a soggy bread and way overpriced.Then corn fritters,which supposed to have bacon(more like 3 bacon crumbs) tasted like they were just microwaved.The only thing that tasted OK was pizza.Overall,the quality and price of the food makes me wonder how does this place still in business."
Shradha A.,"Chicago, IL",683,2108,181,5.0,10/4/2010,"Absolutely amazing everything! We walked down the streets of Pasadena for a while trying to decide on a place to dine at. While several were interesting, none that fully captivated us. Then one of my friends mentioned the avocado egg rolls at BJ's and given we were going to Target anyway, we decided to eat here in Glendale.  The avocado egg rolls most certainly lived up to its recommendation! They were probably the best I've ever had! And special mention of the fact that they weren't super-oily! We also tried their bruschetta on focaccia, which I also liked a lot! But the ""liked a lot"" and ""amazing"" doesn't stop with the appetizers.  Their calzone and angel-hair pasta were just so perfect too! It was one of those days you wish you had a bigger stomach so you can put more food into it and let your tongue and other senses enjoy the meal a little longer! The service was friendly and the place was not too loud or dark."
Rhonda Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,21,1,5.0,12/9/2015,"I know I'm a tad bit late, but I wanna just say how great Nicholas is! He accommodated my fiancée and I! He was very polite, easy going, and overall awesome! I'd like to say my fiancée and I have not received such great service up until Nicholas served us! He makes you wanna go back not just only for the pazooki but for the top notch service he provides! I would definitely give him more stars if I could."
