Jiji G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,,5.0,6/13/2014,"One of my favorite restaurants. If you go here, you cannot leave without having some Pizoukie. My personal favorite is the white chocolate macadamia nut cookie with vanilla, or Oreo's with vanilla. For food, I always get the Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo but with grilled shrimp instead (eat half, take the rest to go). Their midori sour is AS GOOD AS IT GETS!"
Nichomachus P.,"San Francisco, CA",0,39,9,3.0,12/6/2015,Good place for family. Average kids menus. Mac and cheese for kids okay. Salad consisted of shredded lettuce. The chocolate milk is too large for kids. Pizza is nasty. Plz don't order.chicken wings are four out of five. Decent selection of beer.
Katherine K.,"Los Angeles, CA",74,253,66,2.0,9/26/2012,"I went here for a going away dinner. They had a decent beer selection. I was happy when I saw that they had Allagash for $5.  As with any BJ's Restaurant the food is mediocre but the pizzas are especially disgusting, namely the new portobello one with a balsamic glaze. Seriously? I didn't think anyplace could screw up portobello and balsamic. Their pizza dough is greasy, doughy, too chewy.  The pizookie choices are their saving grace although its best just to stick with the classic chocolate chip pizookie or the white chocolate macadamia. All the others are too sickly sweet. If you check in, you can get a deal for a party of two: $19.95 for a medium pizza and pizookie. It's great because at only $10/person, it's more than enough for what you should pay for food here. Blech."
Holly R.,"Glendale, CA",0,9,1,3.0,12/13/2012,"I've been to this location many times, and while I like the food options, the service is consistently slow. Sometimes painfully slow. The BJ's in Burbank seems to be better on service time.  So glad they have gluten free options, but I wish they had more dairy free choices too. Allergies are tricky! The root beer is great!"
Vineet S.,"San Francisco, CA",583,21,,5.0,5/1/2012,"I've been thinking of reasons to not like BJ's of Glendale. I haven't any. So I read some other 1-star reviews, just to see what my fellow humans had to say. 1. Some 17 year old: ""I decided to get a cheeseless mini vegetarian pizza"". Why would you go to a comfort food/beer garden and order an amputated pizza? With a vegan crust? Why don't you just swallow the Sierra Club's website? No carbs there. Go hug a Yeti.  2. Half naked wannabe in front of an $8000 corvette (Kelly Blue Book Value): ""Go down the street to OUTBACK STEAKHOUSE..half the price..great service and almost half the price"".  Also, is it ""half the price"" or ""almost half the price""? I suppose being naked in front of a 4-figure car complicates decision making.  Seriously, I can imagine a conversation with this specimen to go like: ""Oh my GAWDI just HATE Seattle!"" ""You're in San Francisco"" ""Whatever... Same longitude"" ""That's.. Surprisingly accurate! Do you even know what a longitude is?"" ""Duh... It's the opposite of shortitude."" These two aside, it would seem that most complaints come from not-so-stellar service found on Friday and Saturday nights. Because everyone comes here. All the time.  However, I frequent this establishment every 8-10 weeks, and I've ALWAYS had a great time. Every time. We've had two birthdays here of parties of 12 and 6; been here during happy hour and regular hours; sampled nearly half the menu in some form of the other; service has been great but not stellar; and we never had trouble with parking. I won't get into details about the menu - just don't order random weird stuff. Their pizzas and appetizers won't disappoint.  Entrees are fine, too. Desserts are worth saving some real estate in the tummy for.  I'm not a beer aficionado, but my bros order for me and their draughts are always crisp and aptly chilled. I haven't any complaints.  I've never tried their soup and salad special here, come to think of it. But that's probably because I have better things to digest . Literally."
Jose E.,"Los Angeles, CA",29,6,1,5.0,2/4/2014,The food was great we got the mozzarella appetizer and the mediterranean pizza  The service was very good the waiter was  attentive to us and brought everything we requested very quickly For drinks we just got some  beer of which they have many choices
Ant P.,"Costa Mesa, CA",1,364,180,3.0,6/10/2013,Food is blah. I was introduced to a drink at bjs called a Miami tea. Was damn good.
BF S.,"Glendale, CA",0,1,,5.0,11/23/2014,"I feel obligated to post an outstanding review today. Just watched the management of the restaurant request two patrons to leave after continually smoking after being asked more than twice to stop.  You can ignore the recent negative review - this is what it was about. In terms of food and service, both were outstanding. The Moroccan spiced salmon was perfectly prepared, cooked through but still very moist. The gluten-free pizza is one of the best in the city for my celiac daughter.  The wait staff also volunteered that a side dish wasn't recommended and offered an alternative without prompting. All-in-all a very pleasant experience led by a management staff that obviously understands the needs of all their patrons."
Robert V.,"Los Angeles, CA",29,6,7,4.0,9/29/2013,The food is good and Tanya is the best server they have. The enlightened Maui pork chop is great. Just the right size for me and under 600 calories.
Khaleese B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,1,2.0,12/27/2014,"The overall restaurant is very nice but they need to work on either hiring more qualified staff, or training their staff better. We went in a large group, and to avoid receipt issues, we asked for separate checks in advance. Once William (our server) informed us that this wasn't possible, we decided to work around it. Not only did he end up charging the wrong card $50 extra, he wasn't really accommodating at all. He made us separate the checks ourselves because he said it couldn't be done, when I know for a fact that it can because we've been here before. Work harder William."
Henan J.,"Los Angeles, CA",377,406,1169,4.0,8/11/2010,"Great spot after a long day at work with no chance to grab a bite. Service was great, TVs everywhere on the local sports channels. Server was really helpful and we got seated right by the bar area. Got the Cajun Pasta with Shrimp & Brewhouse Blonde. Great pair and I left with a smile on my face. This visit was totally a leg up from the last time I came around."
Alex F.,"Glendale, CA",6,18,1,2.0,8/22/2014,"I like to come to see the games, today I came with my brother who is visiting from our of the country and they couldn't show the game because they don't pay for the ESPN deportes channel. .. how disappointed!"
Mary S.,"Windsor, CA",0,9,,2.0,12/22/2015,Perfect place to eat if you love staff that doesn't acknowledge you for 15 minutes and talks in the corner with their buddies instead and it takes 45 minutes to get over fried luke warm appetizers out. Best!!
Denisse R.,"Pico Rivera, CA",4,9,2,5.0,4/13/2014,"First time at this bjs and I had amazing customer service! Our host was dressed a little sluty but she was nice. Our server, Latanya was AMAZING!!! She went above and beyond what I expected. She was really friendly and knew the menu like the back of her hand. Right after I ordered she brought us some soup to sample. I didn't even know they did that! She also brought me some ranch, BBQ sauce, and buffalo sauce for my burger. She was the best server ever!"
Geraldine S.,"Los Angeles, CA",203,66,131,1.0,4/23/2012,"No exaggerations whatsoever. No effort will be exerted for this review. Honey Badger don't give a shi- Seated almost immediately. Wait 15 minutes to place our order. Wait 35 minutes to get our appetizer, which was sent to a neighboring table, brought to the kitchen, and brought back to our table 2 minutes later. Wait an additional 15 minutes to get our large pizza. Waitress offered to bring back ranch. Never did. 50 minutes after we place our order? what.the.fuc- Waitress nowhere to be seen.  Every other worker seems not to pass by our section. Wait 20 more minutes to get check. Wait 10 more minutes for waitress to pick up said check. Worst dinner experience ever. This BJ's blows."
Roy M.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,15,,3.0,9/7/2013,"I'd like to say that the food at BJ's is good, well, it better be for the prices they charge for it.  I really hate what modern-day restaurants do to their waiters, they pay them horrible wages and have them come begging to us for a large tip. I can't blame the waiters, but I can only blame the restaurant.  BJ's is one of those restaurants.  This one waitress kept asking us every 2 minutes if we were ready to order, obviously to get a large tip in the end. By the 5th time, I asked her if she could give us a little extra time. I must of offended her somehow because she completely ignored me the whole day and charged my card TWICE.  The bank would have taken me behind the building to violate me if my balance went negative, lucky me, I kept a little extra. Now, if in addition to the prices, I have to deal with vengeful waitresses, no thank you BJ's! Don't recommend this place for regular everyday eating."
Cynthia S.,"Granada Hills, Los Angeles, CA",382,284,61,5.0,3/23/2012,"Came in for Happy Hour.... 10PM (Bar area only) Our waiter was fantastic, he didn't neglect us but he wasn't overly clingy either...  Got Avocado egg rolls, it was as fantastic as always except the sauce seemed more watery then usual, but I love them so much I ignored it....  Got the sliders and Fries... 4 mini burgers and they tasted great... it wasn't like over the top fantastic burger that you cant get enough off but it was tasty...  The waiter asked us to get our drink orders, and he was so good  at what he was doing I forgot I wanted to get a fruity drink and ended up with a great beer instead. when he walked away it was like ""what just happened?""  Overall it was all good! =]"
Steven R.,"Los Angeles, CA",41,232,220,3.0,8/11/2014,The beer is a 8 of 10 (I drink IPA) the food is a 5 of 10. Just like every other BJs.
Divya G.,"Los Angeles, CA",13,189,26,3.0,12/2/2012,"Slow service, but good food. The pizza is fluffy and delicious. Calamari is deliciously crunchy and the potato skins are really cheesy and great. The pizookie was the best part! Warm and cold at the same time. The waiter brought my friend a special mini birthday pizookie as a surprise :D. The environment is casual, but the lights are a little too dim. If the service was faster this place would have gotten four stars from me."
Aaron B.,"San Fernando, CA",0,6,,2.0,12/1/2015,Food is average.  For the amount of money I would rather walk down the street to Outback Steakhouse and get better food. Bartenders are great and knowledgeable. Take-out is a joke. To transfer a call and for the take-out employee to actually answer the call it will take a few minutes. Also PLEASE DOUBLE CHECK YOUR ORDER before you leave. I will not be a BJ's customer any longer.
