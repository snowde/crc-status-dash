Charlene F.,"Glendale, CA",248,97,139,3.0,1/2/2015,"food is always good but service takes fooooooooooooorever. it's really not the place to be when you're very hungry and want a quick bite. it's nowhere near quick any time of the day. you wait to be seated, you wait for the server, wait for the food, wait to get your check, wait to get parking validation ESPECIALLY at night. our server was nowhere to be found. also, what was up with the hostesses last night? they were all young and quite unprofessional. Pizookies are so darn good though.."
Jasmine W.,"Irvine, CA",11,4,,5.0,12/12/2013,I had to meet a client here the other day and I will say for a chain restaurant they are good. Being Asian and trying hard to adapt to American food  this place is above the top. Very nice good looking crowd. Definitely not a lower income crowd like some spots in Los Angeles.  I will be going to this place more in the future with all of my girlfriends. They will thank me for my presence.
Jennifer C.,"San Fernando, CA",3,37,19,4.0,11/24/2014,"Our server was named Jennifer and she was the best waitress anyone could have had! she was knowledgeable with the food and the beer and she was also very kind. Now with the food, i do have to say that BJ's lunch has to be the best and most affordable out there. I ordered the chicken strips and they were delicious. I will definitely be making BJ's my lunch destination from now on"
J.P. B.,"Torrance, CA",276,225,566,2.0,2/12/2012,"Came here to meet up with some friends and I am sadly disappointed with the service.  We went up to the hostess and got a table put on the wait list and received a pager.  Found out that its a 30 minute wait, so we headed to the bar to have a few drinks and appetizers as we waited for the table to be prepared.  Nearly an hour has passed and there was still no call, went up to the hostess and was notified that we were next.  Waited another 15 minutes and found out that they had called out the reservation, without using the pager.  So we had lost our table and had to wait to get our table prepared.  What's the point of handing out a pager if they weren't going to use it?!   We finally get seated, food orders came out pretty late, and towards the end our server was nowhere to be found.  It wasn't until we got hold of a manager that we got some service.  It was nice that the dessert was complimentary due to the lack of service, but I doubt I'll be returning to this BJs anytime soon. On the upside, the food was good.  Irish root beer and the avocado wraps were both good.  A good pizza and their Pizookie are always welcome :)"
Mia A.,"Glendale, CA",137,42,2,4.0,3/10/2014,They finally got around to changing the menus! The new plastic smell is still there! I waited 45 minutes on a very busy Sunday night for the cheapest burger on the menu and the manager came by and told me my meal was on the house. Woohoo! My waiter seemed very busy. Still very friendly!
Allyson E.,"Los Angeles, CA",962,418,2162,4.0,7/15/2010,"I prefer this location than the one in Burbank. I feel like the burbank location is more family oriented, this one is open and more of a sports bar. thats prob why i love coming to this one. Theyre always very nice and friendly here, food is always Excellent (esp the lettuce, the stuffed potatoes, PIRANHA PALE ALE NACHOS!, and the chicken club) they have handcrafted beers as well ;q MmmMMm good chet."
Varant C.,"La Crescenta-Montrose, CA",284,160,43,4.0,2/21/2013,"BJ's is great - both the place and the food. Love the fun Decor at this joint. A lot of TV's and LOADS of seating. Always has a line - which shows it's good. Wow, I must say there's too much to choose from which I hate.  I need a bookmark when I am going through the menu. I love their sandwiches, salads, and chicken entrees. The pizzas are not as good though. Great lunch deals. Amazing for dinner. Ideal for large groups, small groups, friends, dates. They have a great bar too!"
Arbi B.,"Glendale, CA",25,63,33,2.0,10/20/2010,Horrible service. It's raining outside and the AC is on. Manager is running all over the place. Save your money and go elsewhere. This place is more suitable for appetizers and beer. Don't expect fresh food as the avocado egg rolls they brought out were still a bit frozen. Don't forget to validate.
May P.,"Los Angeles, CA",102,226,2,1.0,1/9/2012,"After careful review of their allergen menu, I decided to get a cheeseless mini vegetarian pizza, as the dough is vegan, and a salad. The salad was great, but the pizza was the most pathetic piece of crap I've ever seen. They're not kidding about it being mini. And you would think that with a cheeseless pizza, they'd naturally put more marinara sauce on it or olive oil to retain the moisture. That's pretty intuitive, right? Nope. They basically just baked some bread, put some tomato sauce in the center and tossed in about a quarter of a handful of olives, bell peppers and onions on top. I'm not joking. They were so stingy with the toppings that I had to complain to our server that this was the most pathetic piece of crap I'd ever seen. $10 for a piece of crusty bread with some crap on it. C'mon man, I got nothing else on this pizza, and you're gonna give me this stupid excuse for a meal? I'm never going back here. It wasn't even comped. They offered to have them do it again, but honestly, by the time it came back out, my friends would have already finished the meal and would be stuck waiting for me to finish. Bull$hit. Get it right the first time. THIS ISN'T HARD."
Chloé M.,"LAKE VIEW TER, CA",326,372,173,2.0,6/21/2012,"I love BJ's seriously who doesn't love beer and a pizookie but it's all about which one you go; Burbank location A+, this one not so much. This is like my second or third time coming here and something funky always happens. Last visit my poor brother had to wait like an hour for his burger because they made a mistake the first time.  This most recent visit was just as iffy as the last. My mom and I took a seat around 3pm on a Saturday. It took about 20 minutes for a waitress to decide to take our drink order, by that time we already looked over the menu and placed our order at the same. We started off with a tomato and mozzarella cheese balls salad type thing ($2.97) that wasn't too bad. Then, came the chicken wantons and to my lovely surprise there was a strand of HAIR in it, the manager deducted that from our bill but still really!! A PIECE OF HAIR WAS IN MY FOOD!!!! Anyways, came the Maui Maui with fried rice and veggies, that I will say was pretty tasty and would get it again (at another location of course). So I say to you, eat with caution at this location."
Karla G.,"Los Angeles, CA",562,261,361,2.0,2/3/2012,"I am a huge fan of BJ's. I love their salads, pizza and beer. The BJ's we frequent the most is the one in Woodland Hills. Anyhow, I chose to have a dinner party at this particular location this week because it was closer for the people in my party. We got there and the hosts were very pleasant. We went in, sat down, and waited... and waited... and waited some more... By the time I was done reading the menu for the 100th time, I decided to get up and ask someone to please send our server over because we were starving. The host tried to chase the server down and was ignored. The server finally came over, took our order and... we waited.... and waited... and waited some more for our drinks & appetizers. Oh boy. ""This isn't going to end well"", I thought, so I calmly walked over to the hosts and asked to speak to the manager. Kate (the mgr) came over, was extremely apologetic and immediately took action. She took our orders, checked on our appetizers and drinks and slowly but surely things started to turn around. I explained to Kate that this was not a good time for our server to provide crappy service because I had guests there and it was a very important occasion, so I wanted everything to go smoothly. She totally understood and REALLY made our experience great from that point forward. She took the wrong appetizer back & brought us the right one, got us our drinks, got us chips & salsa and even gave us a couple of extra pizookies for the kids to make up for the frustrating first half of our dinner. She went above and beyond any manager I've ever dealt with at any restaurant and for that, I am extremely grateful. Thank you BJ's for having an exceptional employee like Kate, she REALLY, REALLY, REALLY turned a potentially awful situation into a positive one!  Kate also gave me a $25 gift card to compensate for all that went wrong, so I will definitely give this BJ's another shot and hopefully give them a better review as well. :)"
Ceez N.,"Los Angeles, CA",23,149,14,5.0,4/12/2014,Been coming here for a long time since back in the day the customer service is excellent I don't know what these fake yelpers are talking about- the avocado Rolls were and still are amazing- I love bjs (giggles) -
Kaila S.,"Los Angeles, CA",17,37,3,5.0,6/29/2014,"Great place to eat, as the food and staff are good. I went here with my boyfriend, and he had actually bit into a piece of chipped plate. The plate chip must have mixed into his food by accident. After telling our server what had happened, he replaced my boyfriend's meal and alerted the store manager. The manager was upset to hear of the chip, so she comped the plate, and added a free dessert. The staff handled the situation very well, and we would recommend this restaurant to others."
X. O.,"Altadena, CA",2,110,4,4.0,7/20/2014,"We ended up going to BJs because it was getting pretty late, and we couldn't really decide on what to eat. At first I was slightly worried about how long the wait would be and how long it would take to receive our food because the place was busy. Luckily we had a waitress that managed to keep up with it all.  Tonya not only kept us updated on our food and and checked up on us, she made recommendations of what sides were the best to get. And we even managed to get our pazooki in a timely manner and it steaming hot. I would definitely like to go back there."
Kathrin P.,"Alameda, CA",28,116,61,5.0,3/5/2014,I love coming here with friends for happy hour. Love their sliders and fries. They have great happy hour specials on food and drinks. I'm a dark-beer kinda girl ;). IPA's are also my favorite. Fun to come here to watch sports too. I have not had a problem finding seats in the bar. (Knock on wood) The servers here are uber friendly and sociable. Try their mac n' cheese and deep dish pizzas. Noms!
Mike G.,"Yuma, AZ",53,10,,4.0,11/11/2014,"Food was on par with the chain, and beer was as well.  The server, Kelsey M. (0140) made our visit wonderful!  She is new to the position and to southern California, and my family and I wish her all the best.  She was prompt, accurate, attentive and all that I can ask from a server.  The parking situation isn't optimal (does not seem to be any handicapped spots in the adjacent garage) but I do not fault BJ's, just fair warning."
Michael L.,"Buena Park, CA",21,93,58,1.0,4/28/2010,Well just got over food poisoning! I'm not saying that someone here did it but I only ate once that day at it was around  2pm at this BJ's Put 2 and 2 together and you can guess where my illness originated from.
Brian C.,"Glendale, CA",95,235,262,2.0,4/29/2012,"This BJ's is.. well.. a Big Joke. I would give it a 1 rating, but they have a bar which I haven't been to yet, so there's still hope. The service, food, and atmosphere is just kinda of dead. I feel like this place will be the epicenter of the zombie apocalypse when it happens. Save yourself and eat at some other chain restaurant."
Iffy B.,"Atlanta, GA",95,474,29,4.0,2/14/2010,"My friends and I went here for dessert and got the Pizookie Trio with the chocolate chunk, the triple chocolate, and the white chocolate macadamia nut. And the triple chocolate was far superior to the other two.  I would recommend getting the triple chocolate one! It's so yummy!"
leslie D.,"Glendale, CA",162,36,3,3.0,8/21/2012,You get what you expect at this BJ's. The food and service is okay. Love their brews.  Hate their floors. I slip every time i come here. Please tell me it's not just me. The floors are evil! lol
