Barbie P.,"San Rafael, CA",0,27,6,5.0,8/8/2015,"Called with a lunch reservation for an 18 person office party with one hour notice. No problem! They got us in and out in the allotted 90 minutes, food was hot and tasty, and they kept our drinks refilled. You can't beat that!"
Odaliz R.,"Los Angeles, CA",93,237,884,4.0,4/7/2012,"I gotta give BJ's props! I was truly expecting the Denny's dining experience, but lo and behold....the service and food was strikingly fantastic! Our waiter was attentive and courteous from the moment we arrived. I fully enjoyed my Classic Burger with wedge cut seasoned fries....sooooo delicious! I'll assume my buddy's food was also good, busta' couldn't stop licking his fingers....LOL!  We were so full there was no room for dessert.  I can't wait to see you again BJ's......no pun intended (haha)!"
Linda N.,"Los Angeles, CA",18,32,,4.0,10/10/2014,Me and 5 of my friends went to this BJ's location last Saturday noon. They were pretty busy. Our service was great. I had the grilled chicken pesto sandwich. It was really good. Definitely recommended
Rose S.,"Los Angeles, CA",136,215,430,3.0,6/17/2012,"My BFF asked me while I was eating my entree from 1-10 on how I should rate my food. I told her a 5. Why? Well lets see from the picture they offered in their menu (I do understand it is in the low calorie area - but come on) it rarely looked anything like it. Plus I was still indecisive but I did want the mahi mahi, I just didn't like what was in the rice. And I was craving something seafood since lame Vegas Seafood Buffet had one heck of a super duper long wait. So I sucked it up and got. Once we got our main entree I was like yay and than I saw it. I was very disappointed. The mahi mahi was a bit fine a lil unflavored but it was passable. Below that contained more of red peppers, onions, I think its cabbage,  as for peas - it said it had snow peas which I didn't see any, few pineapple and like a dash of rice. I posted up a picture but I forgot to take it before I ate it lol but anyway thats how my food was. I also drop the rate of it being a 4 because it wasn't so flavorful. As for appetizers - no calamari this time so we got spinach & artichoke dip and boneless wings. The boneless wings were good I guess because it had bbq sauce but tasted something you would like at a fast food joint. I love the spinach and artichoke but they don't give enough spinach and artichoke to consume that many tortilla chips.  Our waitress was great though, she was very friendly and patient with us which I give (5 stars)."
Melissa D.,"San Diego, CA",5,85,2,2.0,10/27/2011,"I've never understood some people's obsession with BJs. I always thought it was overrated and overpriced. However, this location on Brand is pretty bad. In general, all restaurants on Brand get pretty busy at night and on the weekends. However, this place is extra bad. The service is here is emabarassingly slow. Everytime I've been here, the server disappears for about half an hour and then suddenly else some other server shows up as if they've always been taking care of you. Let's just say, I've had to wait nearly 20 minutes and ask 3 times just to get a glass of water. And once your food arrives, you better make sure you have everything you need because you won't see that server again for quite awhile. In fact, he/she just seems to disappear. You can't flag her down because she's no where to be found.  If you've never been to a BJs, definitely avoid this one, or at least bring a good book and a jacket (the A/C is always on full blast). If you're still interested in trying it, go to another location but don't expect much from their food; it's just okay. However, I do love their shoestring fries because I hate thick cut ones."
Dee A.,"Glendale, CA",130,289,44,3.0,3/30/2014,"I visited BJ's today for lunch, and have to say that I was not very happy with my food.  I ordered blackened chicken pasta and soup off the lunch menu, and was not impressed.  The pasta was bland, with little sauce over the top, the chicken was on the side, dry and not much of it. I ordered the broccoli cheddar soup, and it was more of a thick dip, than a soup.  The cocktails I ordered were way too sweet and syrupy, ugh! I am not sure if I will visit this restaurant again."
Stevie K.,"San Bruno, CA",148,50,65,4.0,1/11/2012,"Glendale.  Saturday Night.  I'm in town for a seminar and all I can think about is where am I'm going for beer, food and place to watch the playoff games. BJ's naturally (especially since it's walking distance from the hotel).  Well I'm no stranger to BJ's so I knew what to expect. Delicious beer, decent food and a good atmosphere with good service. I've got to say that the place was fairly busy but I was able to snag a tall table next to the bar with my friends. Since I'm still sticking to my new year's resolutions I scan the menu for some healthy options and what do you know, they have a section just for this. It's called Lighter Fare or something like that. Well I'm debating between the Tilapia with rice and a chicken something or other. I ask the waitress which is better and of course she tells me both are great. I go with fish and a Lightswitch Lager which also happens to be low calorie, for beer at least.  Food comes out and it looked, smelled and tasted delicious. I pretty much wolfed the whole thing down in fifteen minutes while chasing it with two of those light switches. The only complaint about the food was with the rice pilaf. There were a couple of hard balls of rice, kinda like when you leave the rice cooker on and a ball forms at the bottom, but's that my only complaint. The fish tasted good, was tender and flakey and didn't stink.  All in all it goes like this:  Food- 3.5 stars Beer- 4.5 stars Service- 4.5 stars Atmosphere- 4.0 stars"
Athenart H.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,70,6,1.0,12/2/2012,"I wish I had read all the Yelp reviews before going here. The service at this location was INDEED terrible.  First waited at the hostess area for a while, because no one was there. A small crowd grew during the time we were waiting. Once seated, we sat at our table for 20 minutes before finally getting up to leave.  I counted at least FIVE waitstaff look at us, see that we were obviously needing service, and then ignore us. FOR TWENTY MINUTES. There were several tables in our section that also had people sitting around with menus provided by the hostess, never acknowledged by the wait staff. So it wasn't just us."
Edrick D.,"Los Angeles, CA",65,19,7,4.0,4/8/2015,i love there secret menu they may say they don't have a lot of items from the previous years but they still do :)
Peter D.,"Los Angeles, CA",99,24,2,3.0,4/8/2014,"Food almost meets the price you pay for, almost. Service could use some improvement. Full bar is nice but I would only come here for their happy hour which is quite pleasant."
Sona K.,"Glendale, CA",4,16,,4.0,6/18/2013,"You can never go wrong with their pizzas and, ofcourse, the pizzoukie!  I've been going here for so many years. When my friends visit, I tell them, ""everything is good here"". Almost each time I visit, the manager passes by to check and make sure the customers are satisfied.  So in short,  Good food, great ambiance, validated parking. I am a fan."
Johnny T.,"Fresno, CA",254,208,826,4.0,11/13/2011,"Not bad food , service was a lil slow but nwe also had a big party with us. Ambiance was good ,drinks were cold and food was acceptable being that im a big Bj fan ( funny sounding),overall a good place for a good place"
gilbert m.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,1.0,8/25/2015,It was my dads birthday and he never is the type to do anything so it's a big deal when he comes out.  However I didn't think bjs would mess up this time.  After we sat down we told the waitress it was my dads bday and at the end of the meal when the check comes if they could bring him out a pazookie we'd pay for it or if it's free that's cool too.  When. We got the bill it was 200+ and the tip was supposed to be $37.  Really a 37 tip that you think you deserve and let's not mention that you never came to fill our drinks or ask us how our food is.  Really?  Bjs is fucking up!!!! Never again my dad is worth better!!!!
Travis H.,"Pasadena, CA",868,435,609,3.0,11/27/2011,"Being a chain place I have to give some credit to BJ's. The pizza is not half bad and they have there own beers on tap. Over time I have worked my way through the whole beer list and would say the Brown is the best they have. This location is not my favorite, i would take the the one over by UCLA. The Covina spot is cold and not comfortable. Maybe it is a college working crowd but the staff is just.. staff... never been WOWed by any of them. Parking is fairly easy in the lot next door.\"
Charis D.,"Pasadena, CA",183,56,4,3.0,5/12/2014,Pizza was Not good but waiter and drinks were good.  Avocado egg rolls were tasty but overpriced at roughly $10 and no chicken inside like other chain restaurants offer.
Jen L.,"Oakland, CA",132,192,59,3.0,4/2/2012,"5 stars for excellent service! I know BJ's is a chain restaurant, and most chains don't have fantastic service just because they are a chain and will constantly have customers no matter what. But our entire table was thrilled by our server's (I wish I could remember her name) pleasant attitude on a BUSY Clippers' game Saturday night. Our large party (15+) had just come from our friends' wedding at the Methodist church a couple blocks away, and on a Saturday night, we were pretty sure everywhere would be packed and wouldn't let us in. However, to our pleasant, pleasant surprise, BJ's said they could accommodate some of us outside and some of us at the bar, which worked out perfectly since some were going to get drinks and others weren't. BTW, the entire lobby area was full of people waiting for a table, but they didn't want to sit outside. Even on a rainy night, the heat lamps offered plenty of heat, so sit outside to skip the wait! Inside at the bar, seating is open, so we were able to snag good tables and booths. Like I said earlier, our server was so fun - she gave us recommendations on apps and beers and had fun with us when we ordered our round of shots. The atmosphere was lively and fun in the bar area and lent to an excellent end to a Saturday full of memories! My big gripe (which is why I minused two stars) is that the drinks were unbelievably weaksauce; we even had to ask if there was any alcohol put into the drink. The mojito tasted like sugar water, the gin and tonic like water, and the cranberry vodkas like watered down cranberry juice. Sad since we're paying so much for the ALCOHOL, not the ice. I hope they fix this soon!"
Daniel T.,"Fontana, CA",51,216,10,4.0,3/25/2014,"Food is really good...the pizookies are the shizz!  Five stars?  They have beer!  Five stars?  I work in the building and find myself going here more than I would like to admit, mostly because it's convenient and better than the Olive Garden and CPK...but to tell you the truth, I am kind of tired of their beer selection, it's time to get some new brews on tap!!!  For that, I am deducting one star."
Charles W.,"Monrovia, CA",7,68,,2.0,6/5/2012,"The food was actually OK (I would probably give it 3 stars overall).  I really liked the shrimp tacos and the pizookie (they would probably get 4 stars).  The pizza and the beer was decent, but I wouldn't say it was really unique.  I was disappointed in the mango salad (which I believe had less than 1/2 of a mango in it). The staff themselves were also OK - everybody was very polite.  However, this place has a serious problem with organization: 1) True wait times were 2-3 times longer than projected for seating, food, etc. 2) After waiting 20-30 minutes to get a seat, I noticed that there were still a large number of unoccupied table.  This implied to me that they were severely understaffed, and this was why they were not utilizing all of their seating at ~7 PM on a Friday 3) I probably had to wait about 10 minutes to get a beer after ordering it.  I was told this was because it was so busy, but I don't see why it should take that long to pour a drink. 4) Our pizza was delivered to the wrong table, so we had to wait for another one to be made from scratch."
Nancy Q.,"Porter Ranch, CA",263,108,148,3.0,4/8/2012,"Good place for happy hour and drinking.  When you get the munchies, the pizza is good.  They have thin and thick crusted pizza.  Their pizza's come in a variety of toppings and are very delicious.    For birthdays, they give free pazookie :) During evenings and weekends, this place gets crowded and it seems there aren't enough waiters.  During lunch time, they are very attentive.  Almost too attentive.  Our waitress kept coming to our table to take away plates and kept asking us if we need a to-go box, but we weren't done eating yet!  Then she would give us the bill and kept checking if we paid yet.  Overall, I don't like their service."
Matthew S.,"Long Beach, CA",17,36,1,3.0,4/22/2014,"I ordered the backend chicken and broccoli pasta in cream sauce. The chicken was dry but flavored well. The pasta was great, cooked perfectly. It hardly had any broccoli and the broccoli was a little over cooked. It had garlic bread but it was hard and flavorless. I would had put a little more alfredo sauce. I liked the meal overall."
