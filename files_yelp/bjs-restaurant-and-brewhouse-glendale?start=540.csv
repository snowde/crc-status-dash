Priti R.,"Los Angeles, CA",120,27,,4.0,10/18/2011,"Over the past two years, I have come to this specific BJs for several birthdays and several casual dinners. The food has always been great and the service: decent. It's only because of my recent visit about 2 weeks ago that I am tempted to write this review. Our service was amazing! - I have been going to BJs all over southern Cali for about 7 years now.- Never have I received such great service at a BJs franchise before this evening. Sad to say, I cannot remember the name of my server- however to describe her, she was about 5'3' - tanned- long dark hair- most likely of Latin decent- middle aged- very thin. I was there on  a Saturday evening about 8PM. To begin with, we never had to flag her down for any requests. She made sure to check-in with us frequently without ever disturbing us. As part of the Dinner For Two deal, we ordered the Tomato Bisque Soup, which we were happily able to enjoy with side Garlic Bread on the house! (Never have I been given that when ordering this soup.) Did you also know that you can incorporate 2 of your favorite Pazookie choices into 1!? Yes, you can request it to be 1/2 and 1/2. Something our server offered us which enabled us to try two of the Pazookies we were keenly eyeing. I recommend ordering 1/2 Chocolate and 1/2 White Chocolate-  No doubt, it will hit the spot! I sure hope to get this server again.... Great Food+Great Server = Awesome Experience!"
Steph T.,"Glendale, CA",0,11,1,5.0,7/23/2015,"I love coming here for a good dessert.. Pizookie's always hit the spot ! It's A Warm cookie , topped with vanilla ice cream. There's different flavored cookies as well that you can choose from but you can't go wrong with the original chocolate chip cookie !"
Jully L.,"Glendale, CA",178,20,7,2.0,5/1/2011,"I used to frequent the Burbank location - that BJ's is awesome.  the Glendale one SUCKS.  i've now been here twice (once in a group of 10 and tonight in a group of 6), and both experiences have been about the same.  (though the experience tonight may have been slightly suckier.) this may seem a tad unfair, but i'm just going to conflate the two experiences in this one review:  it took forever to order food.  drinks came out about 20 minutes after they were ordered, and they came out staggered.  like 3 drinks every five minutes.  (wtf?)  one guy ordered a pitcher, and he was given a glass of beer.  two people ordered the BJ's mojito.  they got two mango mojitos.  one martini was 2/3 the way full, and one guy didn't even get his drink until we asked for it again - AFTER everyone else had already received their drinks.  (this is about 30 minutes into the night, mind you.) food:  salad was drenched in dressing, calamari was thin and the batter was overwhelmingly thick and overfried.  only half the order could be eaten and the rest couldn't even be speared with a fork.  the pizza had a funny taste, and the crust seemed real stringy - like, hard to cut and chewy.  stale?  the tacos were pretty good, and the BBQ pulled pork sliders were good.  they brought out the thick cut fries instead of the thin cut fries we ordered, and we were promised a replacement order that never came - but the thick cut fries were actually really good, so i didn't mind so much.  someone ordered the poke - which came out about 15 minutes AFTER everyone else got their food. (so about 90 minutes into the night.)  another friend got a soup and salad.  the soup was the first thing to come out after the drinks.  and the salad came out 40 minutes later. (about 15 minutes before the poke.) all in all, the food is uneven, ranging from friggin delicious (thick cut fries), to practically unedible (calamari, pizza, ETC.)  the cocktails are kinda gross.  seriously.  we sent back the mango mojitos (bc we never ordered them), and the mojitos we got in exchange were seriously disgusting.  i'd normally send back drinks that tasted that shitty - but if they got two shots at getting it right, figured the third shot would just be futile and a waste of time.  (the other cocktails, they tasted like juice.)   the beer is pretty much fantastic across the board.  the service is... well, they're really nice.  but they got half the orders wrong half the time - AND THEY TOOK FOREVER.  (you know... real sweet, but kinda incompetent.) i was hoping this could be a new hang out place since it's so close to where i live - and i seriously used to go to the Burbank location like 3 times a week for happy hour.  but after these two visits, too many people left unhappy and unsatisfied.  i give this place 2 stars since the service was nice and some of the food was good.  otherwise, THIS PLACE IS CRAP"
J. P.,"Los Angeles, CA",27,407,85,3.0,4/11/2010,"I normally don't like big chain places like this, but for some reason I've been here a couple of times and it's been pretty good. Stopped in for lunch today after running some errands in Glendale. The beer on tap -- Piranha Pale Ale - hit the spot and the veggie burger with skinny fries was better than I expected. My dad was really happy with his fish & chips and the Brewhouse Blonde ale.  There was quite a basketball crowd gathered to watch the Lakers game, which gave the place a lively but not obnoxious atmosphere. Service was good and fast. Wouldn't seek this place out - but if you happen to be around Brand Ave and in need of quick place to eat, this is a pretty good option."
Melanie O.,"Glendale, CA",340,661,63,3.0,6/28/2011,"Once upon a very new BJ's, they had horrendous service.  Why we ever repeatedly going will be a wonder, but well, it's Glendale and although our options are growing for latenight food runs, this will have to be a staple. The food here is no different from other BJ's we've eaten at.  Service is what really makes/breaks this place.  We've had fantastic service and we've had service that we swore would make us never return (although we did). Make sure you get your parking validated.  This is not one of the public Glendale places with free 90-min parking.  They do have cheaper options now (Barbacoa tacos = love!) and their bar has never been too shabby with how they make their cocktails. Sometimes though, the wait is long.  Loooooong.  And just on our last visit, the hostess seated a couple before us, even though she told us that she'd be seating us next.  And gave no excuse.  Customer service like that really drives me through the roof.  But well, that is Glendale BJ's for you. Game is always on here, during Laker season, which is why we often gather here.  That, and post-game munchies so everyone can get everything from a salad, pizookie to full-on meal.  Just be patient, and complain if you must.  When we have the managers on site have usually been pretty swift in responding.  And again, validate your parking."
Jennifer M.,"South Pasadena, CA",8,34,21,4.0,4/2/2012,"I liked this place, and went on a first date with someone I met 2 years ago here.  I was in the mood for pizza, and he was in the mood for some soup, so this place seemed like a good option out of the other areas near the Americana and galleria.   The ambiance was very lovely, and the dim lighting made it somewhat romantic, but still casual.  Sadly, it made me REALLY relaxed, so sometimes I would yawn.  Not really something you want to do on a first date!  But we laughed it off :).  The waitress was really nice, and fun to talk to.  We talked about things we gave up for Lent, and even talked about the glucose-free pizza they offered on the menu.  She was funny, and very friendly.  I would not mind asking her to be my server again (if only i could remember her name!).  Anyway, the food took a while to get to us, but when it did, it was very yummy.  I got the glucose free cheese pizza with extra toppings of black olives and mushrooms. It was a small pizza but very very filling.  My date had the cheese broccoli soup in a bread bowl.   Pricing was pretty fair, too.   I would recommend people to go here.  Food was good, people very friendly, was able to be seated quickly without a reservation, and other customers around us looked like they were having a good time.  I would recommend a little less on the dim lighting, mainly because it made me too relaxed.  But hey, that is my problem, and otherwise I would say the lighting is just perfect.  :)"
Genesis C.,"Valley Glen, Los Angeles, CA",41,72,30,5.0,1/28/2012,"Im just going to start off By saying, I LOVE BJ'S!!! (I Know it sounds wrong but Don't think that way Dirty Birdie!) Ok Well where to begin! Well when we arrived it was like 9:30pm and there was a clippers game going on so it was a full house! We arrived at 9:30 and Sat by 9:40 so we got seated really fast which was a plus and we got a booth the looked over the whole restaurant which was awesome!  So Now on to the Food! Well Let me start of by saying that this was my 2nd time going to this place and The first time I came here I was, for lack of a better word, Drunk! So I don't remember my first time lol But this time I was Sober and Starving. So I decided to go with The BJ's Bacon Cheeseburger and Can I just say that it was AMAZING! the Meat was delicious and The thin cut Fries were Delicious!! My Friends ordered different things One of them ordered a Deep Dish Pepperoni Pizza and My other friend ordered a Regular burger. We all ordered Pepsi so No Alcoholic beverages for this dinner lol but I hear the beers are Really good! Maybe Next time!  Overall my experience was Great, our waitress was super nice and the food was sooo good! So I definitely recommend this place!!"
Rose B.,"La Crescenta-Montrose, CA",167,13,,1.0,10/19/2013,Worst service and the food isnt even that good. Honestly if the service wasnt so bad I would have disregarded the bland taste of the food. But it is so annoying when you spend 60$ and leave unhappy.
Christina C.,"Los Angeles, CA",240,140,2,1.0,6/18/2013,"Manager called to get a more detailed description of our sad first experience, a few days after we went. Apologized and was understand of the situation and offered to send a gift certificate to invite us back for another try. Never sent the gift certificate, but it doesn't really matter at this point. This BJ's left such a terrible impression, I doubt that I would ever set foot in this establishment ever again :("
Dave A.,"Pasadena, CA",63,50,15,2.0,5/24/2011,"I've tried Bj's Restaurants a few times and because I don't plan on going to any one again, this review will be for all of them. I think on one occasion I cane for a birthday. The items on their menu looked very appetizing so I ordered a few (including a spinach & artichoke pizza) and some American ale. What I got was flat beer and a large cracker with a ton of cheese on it. All I was eating when I bit into the pizza was a large cheese cracker with very little toppings. I didn't finish my beer or my beer. Then when the bill came I ended up paying $25 for some gross food. I was still hungry so I went to In & Out near by. I didn't have a completely horrible time because the waitress was pretty nice. But too expensive for really bad quality food."
Dale L.,"La Crescenta-Montrose, CA",2,12,,2.0,7/5/2014,I've been going to BJs since they first open.  Food is good beer is great. But this last weekend service sucked. We had to keep asking our waiter for everything. Plus he forgot items and never came back to take items off the table so stuff just kept piling up..
Olga A.,"Santa Clara, CA",98,82,6,2.0,5/7/2013,The service was so terrible I literally wanted to walk to the back and do the whole thing myself.
John J.,"Beverly Hills, CA",1,74,2,5.0,7/11/2012,Great place you just need to know what to get. I remember the first time me and my friends came to Bjs and after we ate we swore we will NEVER step foot in that place again (because the food we got was absolutely disgusting)       A year later someone convinced to go there again and i had the same exact experience (I couldn't believe i broke my promise of not going there)      My whole experience changed when i actually went there AGAIN and this time decided to try their Jalapeno Burger which i fell in love with. Than on my next visit i tried their California burger which was also amazing. service is great and the environment is pretty good too.   +also quick tip+ Bjs is famous for their Pizzas (which i personally dont like)
Kevin P.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,121,3,5.0,3/8/2014,Avocado eggrolls for appetizer. Deep dish pizza + pasta as main. Good night. You get what you expect from BJs.
Keila N.,"Beverly Hills, CA",5000,2051,11264,4.0,2/5/2011,"I was here for dinner a couple of nights ago, and I was really impressed.  My daughter ordered the New York steak and Mac & Cheese.  I ordered the stuffed mushrooms and tomato salad. The mac & cheese rivaled that of Yard House, which i always thought was the best.  The New York came out just perfect. The salads (Caesar and tomato mozzarella)  weren't as impressive, but the Caesar came with NY Steak and the tomato mozzarella was about $4. Two managers came to our table to check on us on different occasions .  The server was prompt.  My water glass was always full. The NY steak was about $20.  The stuffed mushrooms were under $5."
Meg P.,"Glendale, CA",65,45,9,2.0,6/20/2013,"I reserved a table for 15 5 days before my reservation. I arrived at Bjs and my table wasn't ready and had to wait 15 minutes. We go seated and our server took out drink order right away. Then we wanted to order food  and it took 40 minutes to get out server to come server us. I would flag him down several times and even told other servers to please get him. Nothing was done. I finally got the manager and told her the situation, she kindly took out food order right then and there and she got another server to server are table. Which turned out great. But mean time as the manager was helping us out original server came back and was helping others at our table.  We had a party of 15 plus and one server is not enough for that size party. Once the other server came everything was good, she was a great server. Its frustrating when you have a party over 15 people buying drinks and buying food and you have service for the 1st half hour and dont have any service for the next hour and a half. All I have to say Is you need to make service a priority or you wont have anyone back."
Daxx H.,"Pasadena, CA",5,88,7,3.0,12/11/2013,"The food is alright and the beer is good too, but the place has turned into a Cheesecake Factory concept. I used to work for the company in the early 2000's and it's really changed since then. I liked it the way it was before."
Saina K.,"Santa Clarita, CA",255,182,121,2.0,3/10/2011,"I got a seat quickly so that was good. With that said: My wedge salad was SOAKED in dressing. I mean, it was taking a bath, not a shower. Absolutely gross. My waitress seemed to hate her job and was super slow and bored, if not irritated. My mojito had little alcohol and I should've just ordered some juice, with the drink tasting it as it did. The little pizza appetizer I had was A-OK."
DD G.,"Burbank, CA",116,35,12,4.0,6/30/2013,"Once upon a time I was a regular at this joint. Then I went through this ""economical"" phase and started eating and drinking at home. After months of that, I return to familiar faces and it's like I never left. I'm referring to the ""Cheer's"" mentality, folks. This place has it. Great food, great drinks, great times."
Nile E.,"Sierra Madre, CA",1118,70,22,1.0,4/12/2013,i wish there was a negative five star rating on yelp for this place!! i have never in my life been to a chain restaurant that has consistently horrible service!!!  this is my third time at 3 different restaurants and they honestly need to shut down!! i'd rather eat cafeteria food..... this last time i got tricked into going...the server brought my meal 20minutes before the appetizer came...and waaay before my son's meal. he's a kid...you bring his first!!   we didnt get any water until i had to ask again way after all the food had arrived.  never got the bread she promised and the items were so bad that we had to make them take at least two things off the bill. you guys suck terribly and i hope you wake up soon and change your ways!!  call john taffer or somebody!!! nile evans....out!
