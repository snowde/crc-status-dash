S S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,12,,1.0,4/11/2015,"This particular establishment is a miss at all times.  Their qc is a joke and inconsistent every time I have come here, so I have decided to give my business to an establishment that knows how to run a restaurant.  Service is spotty and food is mediocre. There is a lot of competition in vicinity and better choices."
Rony M.,"Glendale, CA",134,122,39,4.0,11/4/2011,Great service.  Food is OK nothing to right home about but hey its a chain and the kids enjoyed it. They do have great beer though
Anthony T.,"San Diego, CA",1,20,,2.0,5/1/2012,"Food was decent enough. I should have trusted my instincts on the steak though. Ordering steak from a pizza place is just asking for trouble. I ordered it medium and it was pretty much well done. Fried artichokes tasted fried. Not bad. The big flaw was the way they calculated our bill. We had a large group and the bill included tip. When we received our payment slip after giving our credit cards, there was an additional tip added onto it putting the total at a 35% tip. The waiter claimed it was how tips were calculated in the computer and that tip amounts with individual bills(which we had done) was different than doing it all at once. Anyone with basic knowledge of how percentages work can tell you that's just BS.  If you come here expecting a great dining experience, you're gonna have a bad time."
Judith R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,16,1,1.0,5/16/2014,This place it only good for happy hour..other than that the food has no flavor and its over priced not worth it..Thats why go during happy hr for aptzers and Beer...
Audrey H.,"NORTH HOLLYWOOD, CA",10,22,2,2.0,1/25/2014,"I came with my niece and nephew.They sat us at a table right by the outside seating area,and we were blasted by cold air every time the door opened,which was a lot. My niece ordered the classic burger,with cheese,lettuce,mayo,mustard,ketchup,and added onion straws.I do not understand why they charge $9.50 for that,but $2.00 less for the black and blue burger I had.I do not like well done..I asked for medium rare.Got well done.There was barely any toppings,almost no blue cheese.And the fries were not hot.Why cant kitchens time their plate components properly.I really would have loved a beer,but I am diabetic.Giant beer menu,and..they carry a gluten free menu..yet no gluten free beer...nor one of the new low carb beers..for those who would like. My nephew ordered the gluten free pizza..with 3 toppings,it was $11.50.have had same at other places cheaper.They did like the pizooki..gluten free version. I might give it another shot...."
Cynthia M.,"Los Angeles, CA",80,6,28,1.0,5/27/2013,"Sincerely the worst wait ever to be seated, the hostess was nowhere to be found and two different servers asked if we had been helped and when we said no, instead of helping us they each said they'd go find us help. Once seated it took an additional 5-10 minutes for our server to attend us. Which gave us enough time to decide on our entrees. I've never been disappointed in BJ's as a chain, but this specific location will lose a set of customers.... we'll see how long it takes for our food to arrive..."
Mark L.,"Glendale, CA",115,23,,1.0,2/9/2011,"Sucks. My coworkers always insist on going and everytime we go and I hate it more and more everytime we go.  The food is trash, if you have to eat here and have money, the only good thing is the steak.  My coworkers get upset that I hate this place and I always beg to go elsewhere but I think they're partially retarded and like crappy food .The atmosphere sucks and puts me in a bad mood when I go. Thanks for the memories BJ's, you really suck."
Anz L.,"Long Beach, CA",1642,447,723,1.0,11/10/2012,"Why....Why did I come back here? I gave this place up like 3 years ago because they served me WARM wine  (two different visits) and the service is always supremely shitty. THE ORDER: Cookies and Cream Pizookie: 4 stars. I ordered this with  a side of strawberry sauce (the stuff they use for the beignets). Obviously, this is ooey gooey deliciousness. But, oh, wait! I didn't receive that exact order! UGH. THE SERVICE: 1 star; What started out as great and friendly service, turned into a total bitch move on our server's part. When the Pizookie arrived, it had the side of strawberries, but no strawberry syrup. We asked for it again 3 times. So,  as the ice cream is melting, we waited and waited for the sauce. It never came, so I decided to just eat the damn melted pizookie. THEN...I am like, ""WTF, this is chocolate chip. Or is it? Maybe the C&C just looks exactly like the chocolate chip one.""  I never, ever eat chocolate chip anything bc it's elfin boring, so I know I didn't order that shit. When we alerted our server, he said, ""Yes, that's the chocolate chunk that you ordered, I have it written down right here."" I had to get a little stern, bc don't tell me that I ordered my last choice of something. I wouldn't have even ordered it! I told him, ""Yes, that's what you wrote down, but thats not what I ordered. Trust me, I would never order that, nor has the word 'chunk' left my lips in years."" He copped a 'tude...it went on for like 2 minutes (ridiculous),...we asked if we could get the one we wanted. The correct one took forever, had no strawberries or sauce, but it was still MFing good. When the bill came, both pizookies were on the bill. And, no we didn't eat even a third of the wrong order. Basically, I won't go on further, because this is so stupid, but he had to get the manager to comp it off of our check, it was ridiculous.  OVERALL: Seriously, eff this place. I'm completely over it....not even a delicious pizoookie will get me back into this poorly-staffed hell hole. Worst location, ever. The Long Beach one on 2nd St is still legit and in Seal Beach, too. I DO NOT RECOMMEND TO ANY YELPER, EVER!! xo- andrea"
Mizz D.,"Los Angeles, CA",67,23,7,1.0,5/2/2014,"Worst food I had a coworker bring me a hamburger for lunch. The bread was dry, it did not even have cheese. All it had was buns and some meat. Had I known this was what I was gonna pay for I would had even order mcdonalds at least the burgers have cheese and some dressing. Worst hamburgers I have had"
Brian K.,"La Crescenta-Montrose, CA",262,244,28,2.0,4/25/2011,"I give it a 2.5 round down. I remember BJ's used to be good (food&service). Well, at least better than the average. Was never a fan of their pastas and sandwiches, just their pizzas and beer. Pizza is just alright now. Nothing special. Same with the service. I think it is lacking."
Alma M.,"South Pasadena, CA",179,122,437,4.0,11/4/2011,The food is delicious and personnelis very helpful and alwaysknow what great deals to get you into:) I always come back!!!!
Cody V.,"Glendale, CA",1,3,,1.0,7/26/2014,Bj's has far the worst customer service ever. Our server was very slow took a long time with everything food check and drinks we were there for 3* hours 1 hour eating the rest waiting and she couldn't separate the check between 5 people and when we finally got it she messed up the payment so we had to pay for our other friend because she messed his payment worst service ever but good was good
Bonnie L.,"Los Angeles, CA",221,22,,1.0,2/25/2011,"I want to give this a -5 star. This restaurant has the worst service i've ever gotten. It was never good. but this time pushed me over the edge.  we arrived with 3 people and then we had more people joinning us so we switched table. and this is before we ordered, so there was really no work, just give us another table.  we got our drinks,  and then we waited 10- 15 min, n i finally couldn't take it anymore and i stopped someone, they had no idea we didnt have a server. it was then we finally could get our orders in.  the food did not all come at once, only 2 orders came, and they were both the unlimited soup and salad order. I was almost finisehd with my food and my friends stuff hadnt arrive yet still. I had to get the manager to go get the rest of the food. he went in to the kitchen and came out immediately with the food. so that means they were just sitting on the counter just no1 was smart enough to take them out.  oh and all this time no1 at all came to our table to ask for any refills. we had no refills on our soup n salad (its the unlimited order) and no refills on our drinks! of course we had to wait for our bill too. the bill came and itw as wrong. i asked for a new bill and change, she came back with just change.  WTF??!??!  NEVER EVER Going back there again EVER! food wasnt even that great, just microwavable premade soup and a bunch of lettuces."
Janett A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,1.0,2/7/2015,I eat BJs pretty often but this time i am really disappointed with their service... i placed a takeout order.. asked for extra sauce on the chicken instead they gave me no sauce. Chicken was so dry it wasnt good at all so i didnt eat it. Aside from that im allergic to brocoli specifically asked for no brocalli and guess what my plate had brocalli. Aside from that i ordered a poozkie and i got an orginal size and honestly it was half the sizr of the orginall.. it wasnt well spead.. im so disappointed with the service.
Miko S.,"La Palma, CA",13,71,24,3.0,10/12/2011,"The service is slow.  Heck, even some of the waiters acknowledge the fact.   The place tends to be busy and with large parties.  It is a high noise place with large groups and sports on every tv around the dining area. BUT... like any BJS, the food is good and there's a great selection of drinks.  They can accommodate groups well enough and the atmosphere is warm. Just don't go here if you are in a hurry, and never be afraid to flag someone down if you need your check."
Kimmy T.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,9,,2.0,4/12/2015,"bad customer service, the waitress was so rude and never bother to come and check if we needed anything."
Kim N.,"Burbank, CA",1,36,1,2.0,12/19/2013,"I'll give them 2 stars because I like their food but service here is horrible whether you dine in, pick up or have it delivered. Was here with a friend about a week ago for lunch, there was one holiday party or some kind of party and the rest of the restaurant wasn't full. Our waiter was some guy with gold sparkly glasses and who did not wear an undershirt under his thin white dress shirt. He was by far the worst waiter I've had in a while, we waited 45 mins and no food came out, we couldn't find him anywhere so we had to flag down a different waitress. She found him and he came with some lame excuse about not knowing what happened to our food. Funny thing is that there was a table behind us that was seated after us and they got their food way before us. After his lame excuse our food came out 20 mins later, like a though he just put it in. Every time I gone to this BJ's I have had crap service, I'm not sure whats going on here but their service sucks and I don't think management cares because I have never seen a manager walking around."
Nicole G.,"Austin, TX",473,72,1,4.0,5/3/2011,"My Sesame Salad was yummy as always!  It's a big salad though...like it was endless.  After 30 minutes of working on it, I still had a ton left!   My waiter was fun...an Irish man!  Had a lot of great drink recommendations!"
Marina G.,"Glendale, CA",9,128,,4.0,9/22/2013,"Why the bad reviews?  Every time I have come here, I have had good food with exceptional service. Oh and of course the famous pazooki ( BJ's would not be as successful as it is if it weren't for the pazookis').  I love Pazooki's so much that I could eat a whole one by myself twice a week. Unfortunately, I have to stop this habit because my pants  are getting a bit snug on me.  Regardless of my obsession for Pazooki's,  BJ's is a great consistent place to eat- worth your money and your time."
Loretta B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,,1.0,4/7/2015,"Horrible service and horrible food.  Waited 55 minutes after ordering a hot lunch and it was served room temperature, not fully cooked and appeared to be right out of a can.  Complained but  it was evident they really didnt care. Horrible."
