kristina s.,"Panorama City, CA",48,12,,1.0,12/10/2013,I have been waiting here for close to an hour waiting for my takeout santa fe salad. Wow! I need my money back!!! SERVICE SUCKS!!!
Erin T.,"Glendale, CA",439,15,,3.0,3/25/2011,"I went to BJ's for lunch today. I normally don't go here despite the fact that I live rather close because for the price, I always feel like I can get better. That doesn't seem to change. I really enjoy their service. They are very friendly and tentative to your needs!  Today, I tried their deep dish BBQ pizza. It was quite delicious. I mean, the crust and bread is so fluffy and very savory and their BBQ sauce is amazing! They don't overuse their sauce on the pizza and the toppings complement it nicely. The waitress recommended it to me and she definitely made a good choice. The best part is is that it is very filling and still tastes good later (especially if you are a fan of cold pizza and left overs like I am!) Their strawberry lemonade is also really good!  My only problem is that I hate their price! I feel like it makes a great date, birthday, or business lunch/dinner place, but for an everyday lunch with my friends, it is just too much! Definitely a little over $20 per person. However, if you're in the mood to splurge, then it is a great place to go!"
Art M.,"Glendale, CA",69,207,38,4.0,7/28/2011,"Summer is here. Time to put away the pizzas, ease up on the beers and polish up the ol' six pack for the beach. To that end, BJ's offers some seriously tasty dishes that fit snugly into a nutrient rich lower calorie diet. It hurt not ordering my usual deep dish, but the ""Chicken A La Fresca"" was surprisingly tasty, fresh and flavorful. Memorably good! One of those rare instances a restaurant chain offers a healthy option that's a homerun. The great service and upscale atmosphere you enjoy at BJ's are always a plus. I'm actually puzzled by the reviews claiming poor service. I've been coming here for years and have never experienced anything but fast and friendly service."
Maria M.,"Fresno, CA",19,14,,5.0,2/16/2014,"Ate here Valentine's Weekend 2014. Loved it, great food and prices. Both of the waiters we had were amazing. Enjoyed the Black and Blue Burger and then for dinner had the Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo."
Beth R.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,73,26,4.0,10/10/2013,I am a fan. This is a great place to hit when you want a night out with the family. It's great for kids and parties.  It loud and energetic.  Their Mediteranean deep dish pizza is the wonderful and a must.   Go and enjoy an easy night.
Lowell H.,"Sylmar, CA",229,387,3,1.0,6/14/2013,"We went there for a quick dinner before going to the Greek Theater.  The lady in front made a strong pitch for us to sit in the bar area because it was happy hour with food and drink specials.  It took about 7 minutes for a waitress to come and tell us that she would be back soon.  8 minutes after that we saw her waiting on tables way at the other side of restaurant.  15 minutes and no service, so we left.  It's not a happy hour if you cannot get food or drinks!  We left and went to CPK."
Karin A.,"Glendale, CA",187,242,17,4.0,11/4/2008,"Bj's is a great place. The food is great and the service is nice.  The Outdoor seating is great, I do not like the indoor seating though, its too crowded and tightly packed. There is this one waiter there who was very nice, and gave wonderful service. I totally forgot his name, but he was a great guy :) totally recommend BJ'S!"
Alyssa P.,"West Hollywood, CA",655,161,227,3.0,4/19/2011,"You wanna go where everybody knowssss your name.... Ok so it's not Cheers status there, but I mean it's definitely the neighborhood spot where I go with the buddies.  Too long for a one-hour lunch break, but perfect for happy hour.  Their happy hour deals are pretty good, and I like their beer selection a lot.  The brunette, the blond, and their hef are my faves.  Chicken wings with celery and ranch, the Laker game on the giant screen, and you are good to go.  Deep dish pizzas can't be beat.  And of course, the pizookie.   Make sure you get there early if you wanna catch a big game.  It gets pretty lively and the fellow fans and ""enemies"" are fun to mess around with.   The bartenders are really cool, service is always good.  You can park in the structure behind it entering on Broadway for 2 hours free when you validate with them."
Natalya C.,"Glendale, CA",0,14,3,5.0,1/5/2015,"love the happy hour! awesome items, decent prices. nice atmosphere. already been a few times and they won't be the last."
Mari A.,"Glendale, Los Angeles, CA",6,19,30,2.0,9/15/2013,There food was good once or twice in the beginning but now it's just blahhhh! I wanted to love this place because it's close by and not pricey. However they get two stars for their pazooki which is a must try!
Beau R.,"Sammamish, WA",151,326,29,4.0,10/27/2010,"I've eaten at other BJ's and remembered that they had good beer.  I saw this restaurant when I was running in the morning, so I decided that I'd walk down Brand Blvd from my hotel to here for dinner.   The hostess recommended seating so I could see the TV, since I was dining alone this night.  The Giants were playing, but so was women's volleyball (score!) on the multiplexed TV over the bar. There were plenty of choices in beer and you'll be able to find something that fits your taste no matter what it is.  I felt it was bold of server to tell me her favorites, because beer is a personal thing.  A young lady from Southern California and a guy from the Pacific Northwest are poured from different beer bottles. The menu has lots of choices - mostly burgers and pizza, but I chose the Balsamic Glazed Chicken.  Its probably best thing for you on the menu, served with mashed potatoes and spring greens. By the time I had finished my dinner, enjoyed two beers and the women's volleyball, I had no room for dessert.  BJ's serves a scoop of ice cream on a warm cookie.  It sounds really, really good, but I had no room what so ever."
David M.,"Los Angeles, CA",278,44,25,3.0,9/23/2012,"Great costumer service from the greeter and out waiter. Our waiter even told us about a deal they had going on (2 for $20 2salads, 1 Pizza, and a pazooki) which we had no idea about. We got the deal since we both wanted to order pizza. Ordered a feta cheese and watermelon salad, which blew me away. The negative part of this review and the whole reason I came was the pizza. The problem was there was too much bread and absolutely no sauce, which is the exact opposite of the perfect deep dish pizza in my opinion. Anyway, the pazooki was great and I also ordered on of their hand brewed beers which was surprisingly delicious. I do believe I ordered the Hefeweizen (its the third selection from the top of the list). I would return again but not order the pizza."
Melanie K.,"Glendale, CA",20,86,3,5.0,5/21/2013,"I must say the biggest plus for this place is the beer! It's amazing and cheap! I wish I could have room for more than 1 glass :( The food is pretty good too, especially their burgers ..YUM. Normal prices I would say.. not too cheap not too expensive. And the staff is also very nice, very attentive unless they are busy or your sitting at the bar area and there is a game on. So if your one of those Yelpers that doesn't understand that when it's busy service will be slower, try to avoid lunch time and game time. Overall great place :)"
Amaris M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,17,9,1.0,1/10/2015,"Rate this place 1 star only because I have to be nice I wouldn't give them a star at all ! Worse service ever period hostess was rude it's not my fault you work there , I called in to make reservations and when we got there they canceled them and said we had to wait 40 min ?! Even tho we made reservations get out of here no way never coming back"
Rafael C.,"Glendale, CA",69,13,6,1.0,9/5/2013,"Horrible from the beginning, had people walk right in front of us had them seated before us while we were waiting the entire time, couldn't have dinner there after that felt disrespected and not cared for, decided on a different alternative"
Melody V.,"Los Angeles, CA",109,305,354,4.0,3/16/2011,"I was introduced to BJs Pizza during college back in 2000. I always enjoyed their food, pizza and all. I can always appreciate their pizookie. And, it was pointed out to me that they don't use sauce on their pizza, just large chucks of tomatoe. Still, I never noticed, it was good pizza to me. I always had good service here, then again, I go on the least busiest days, usually a Sunday evening. The beer selection is wonderful. As soon as I walked in I told the waiter I wanted the beer sampler, little did I know he went ahead and order me the 8oz. samplers. I was expecting the smaller samplers, but hey, I can go ahead and enjoy 64oz. of beer! And I did... And I did not know they brewed their own root beer soda! The waiter pointed this out to me, so that was something new. This location is located on a busy corner of Brand Boulevard. Lots of businesses around here so I wouldn't be surprised if the afternoons are filled with men and women in their business attire. It's a relaxing place, a large bar area. There's a parking structure right behind this place, so be sure to get validated."
Jose M.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,7,1,1.0,10/12/2013,"I have gone here 3 times every time it's because someone in the group want to go here but I really dislike this place so much. The reasons are the following the customer service is so horrible the servers just don't care about providing good customer service, one of the times I went with a group of friends we waited about an hour to get asked what we wanted to drink and a person dropped a glass from the table next to us and it took them half an hour to get someone to pick it up. In the time the glass was on the floor someone could have gotten hurt badly. A person that used to work there told me that the employees think that they will not get fired because they are understaffed and they are needed so that is why they don't try to give any good customer service. Do not know if it is true but sure seems like it."
Andrea S.,"Eagle Rock, Los Angeles, CA",86,28,,5.0,8/14/2013,Thank you Kaitlyn! You definitely redeemed this place for me! She was great from the start with a funny introduction for herself. She was always attentive to our table and even stayed to have small conversations and truly made us feel welcome. Our orders were correct and brought us everything in a timely matter. She was amazing! I advise anyone that wants a good experience to ask for her as your server!
Ara G.,"Glendale, CA",90,84,1,3.0,6/2/2011,"Food is good. Vibe is good. I've had one of their beers (which was good). But, the wait for the food is always young and I two different occasions one of the entrees wasn't brought out until everyone else was practically done eating.  Cool part is that the manager was nice and made that meal on the house. He even through in a dessert.  For the scale of restaurant that BJs is, 3 stars feels right."
Harry Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,1,1.0,10/30/2013,Had a terrible experience we orderd two beinges and the waiter forgot one of them and we watited 40 min for the other one and on top of that we waited an hour and a half just for the check
