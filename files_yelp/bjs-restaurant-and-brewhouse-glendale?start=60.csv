Shervin Y.,"Glendale, CA",423,106,162,3.0,4/14/2017,"We have been in the downtown Glendale area for 7 years now and rarely have we gone to BJ's on our lunch break. Last Thursday, we had a business meeting and couldn't agree on a spot so we all opted for BJ's as the safest bet. The two hosts were friendly enough and sat us at a booth near the bar. From what I remembered, there used to be a lot more TV screens everywhere but I've never been a fan of that unless it's a sports bar and you don't mind being distracted  from every angle while you're trying to focus on your food. Our waitress was nice enough. We ordered a mini Spicy Chicken Hawaian Pizza, Root Beer Ribs and Chicken Tacos. The Spicy Chicken Hawaian Pizza was prepared to perfection, it was warm and fluffy and had a fine balance of flavors. The Ribs barely had any meat on them and left an extra sweet aftertaste that made me feel a bit nauseous. Do not expect to be full after these ribs. I didn't have the chicken taco, but my friend was raving about them. Again, they didn't look like they would fill you up. That point was proven when  my buddy said he was starving just a few hours later. PROS - Validated parking - Friendly staff CONS - Inconsistencies in new foods on the menu. It's generally a good idea to stick with their classics. TIP - Try their Pizzas - Try their Clam Chowder inside the loaf of bread - Try the Avocado Rolls - Thank me later!"
Malisa R.,"Los Angeles, CA",167,186,340,3.0,10/13/2016,"Can you expect more from a large chain restaurant? Our party was seated on the patio. I did inquire if we could receive happy hour on the patio and the manager did accommodate us. The only downside about being on the patio was service wasn't that great. On the inside, they weren't too busy, so didn't make sense. However, we had a large party and the patio was nice and spacious.  We ordered most of the shareables and the mini deep dish pizzas. The shareables was your typical bar food. The pizza is always great! The best part of the meal was the sea salt caramel pizookie. Wow. I've had pizookies... this one by far was my favorite. I highly recommend the sangria. It's different since it comes with fireball, but man is it good."
Charles G.,"Pasadena, CA",522,257,1103,5.0,4/3/2017,THANK YOU BJ'S!!!! For your donations to our Life Nights and Oneights Nights. I've been a guest at your restaurant many times and always leave satisfied with the amazing food and service.
Paulina H.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,,1.0,12/16/2017,"WORST Bj's experience ever!!! My boyfriend and I came to eat on a Friday night, and I didn't expect to be sitting next to a dog. I love dogs. But it's one thing to have a dog at home, and another to have a dog at a restaurant. It wasn't even a service dog! I was honestly super uncomfortable just because the dog was barking the whole time, AND especially because the people with the dog, were served and got their food before we did. And we got there first!! Even the people around us were bothered, but no staff did anything about it. Everything else was great though, we love Bj's!"
Monica S.,"Altadena, CA",3,15,7,5.0,9/27/2017,"I have no idea why this place has such bad reviews from all the BJ's Restaurant around our area this one was by far the best one. Our experience was beyond amazing and all thanks to Tanya!!!! She's beyond top notch customer service. She was so attentive, polite, patient, and gave us some great recommendations!! Definitely coming back. Thank you Tanya and keep up the good job. Management someone needs a well deserve raise!!!"
Andrea M.,"San Diego, CA",0,3,,2.0,10/22/2017,"Poor house management.  -We ordered 2 large pizzas (simple, straight off the menu) and a salad.  -Food didn't come out for close to 45min later and pizza was cold, cheese had solidified and pan it came in wasn't even slightly warm. -Likely it was made within a reasonable time but had been sitting in the kitchen for a while before being served. Delivery pizza would arrive warmer than this. It tasted dry and like store bought frozen pizza.  -For a place that was originally founded in pizza, it was extremely disappointing to get such bad pizza. Not to mention the service, which was slow and rather inattentive. We had to ask for our check several times. We had validated 2 hour parking, and didn't even make it out in time.  -I've eaten at other BJs before years ago, and remember the pizza being great and served hot. Not sure if it's this location in particular or a change in their business model but definitely not the same anymore.  -Restaurant was fairly full as it's in a high traffic area, but having a continual flow of customers is no excuse for poor food and service. I noticed many tables full of people waiting for a while for food like us, without anyone coming by to check on them or apologize for the wait.  -It's pretty simple, pay attention to your customers and your product. There's plenty better places to eat around this area, not worth your time or money here."
Andrea K.,"Auburndale, MA",101,123,30,2.0,3/19/2017,"Came here at 330 on a Sunday afternoon, not too crowded, sat at the bar. I waited a few mins to be greeted, then  I helped myself to a menu. The bartender was sooo stressed out. She took my order but walked away while I was ordering. I wondered if she heard me, but didn't want to ask for confirmation, it felt awkward like I'd be poking a stick at someone already annoyed.  The food was slow, when it came out, it was the wrong order. I told her that it wasn't correct, she said, ""I'll help you in a few minutes. I'm too busy now"". One of her colleagues said, ""I'll do it"" and took my order accurately. She did apologize and said it was her mistake. If this bartender is this overwhelmed for the Sunday after-lunch  before dinner times I'd hate to see her on a weekend night. **Update** The new food came out correctly & tasted good. I thought they would have comped me something though!"
Phillip J.,"Glendale, CA",0,3,1,4.0,2/1/2017,"Great place, great food, very nice atmosphere.  Would definately refer friends and family."
Jeanna M.,"Glendale, CA",0,2,,1.0,10/17/2017,"I have had the worse experience ""ever"" with my visit to your Glendale BJs Restaurant. I am extremely upset.  For the first time and last, I ordered two pizzas online for take-out at 4:39pm... the pizzas were to be ready at 7pm. I ordered the pizzas for a special occasion... I had people waiting for me. I arrived at the restaurant at 6:50. I spoke to the worker, Katherine. I showed her my order information on my cellphone. She stated that the kitchen was still working on my pizzas and they would be ready soon. I sat there in front of them and periodically asked if my order was ready. At least six people came and went with their take-out orders. People were going in-and-out of the dining areas.  Kathrine offered to have me pay while I waited, it took at least 20 minutes to get that correct. The manager, Armando Gonzalez, needed to come assist twice because it was done incorrectly (his fault). He came once and discounted only one pizza, then he needed to come back to discount the other. He should've got it correct the first time. The staff was running around like chickens with their heads cut off... disorganized, unprofessional, inappropriate, rude. The manager was just as bad as his staff, who he obviously does not supervise.  I waited in the restaurant for an entire hour (6:50pm to 7:50pm). There was one young male employee there, who looked at my husband and I (in the eye) and sang loudly... ""hit the road Jack, and don't come back here no more"". I should've got his name, not that it matters to me anymore... I will not be returning. Your restaurant is getting a very bad review from me and my entire family (who waited so long with horrible service). Additionally, I received my two pizzas after an hour of waiting... they were two, cold, uncooked pizzas. I live a block away. I walked a block to get home and open the pizza boxes to COLD, UNCOOKED, doughy pizzas. On my order, I specified that I wanted the pizzas ""cook well done"". After waiting in the restaurant for a full hour, you would think at least they would freshly and thoroughly cook them... but NO.  I literally feel sick. I am dissatisfied with the entire experience from beginning to at this moment. It is not over for me. I will continue to complain.. Again, it was by far the worst experience in my many years of life.  Dissatisfied"
Jared W.,"Glendale, CA",1,11,1,1.0,4/22/2017,Me and my group of 8 friends decided to eat here for my friends birthday. The service we experienced was horrendous. When we got our food we didn't get any napkins or utensils . We waited 20 min for the waitress to give us napkins and utensils. Fucking bullshit.  Also while we were eating the waitresses didn't even take the menus off the table. Like come on. I get better service at McDonald's.
Vero C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,9,4,1.0,7/8/2017,I'm sitting here very upset with my server and my food. My shrimp and asparagus is the worst I have ever gotten. I've ordered this dish many times before and today it is a joke!! The asparagus is so old and dried up I can't eat it. Our waiter took our order then we had to ask him 3 times to bring us utensils. He has not once come back to check on us or our orders. And the restaurant is not even that busy... this is not acceptable.
Ryan H.,"Lake View Terrace, Los Angeles, CA",1,4,1,1.0,7/20/2017,"Last night was the last time I go to the Glendale location. When my wife and I arrived on a Wednesday night for dinner we were told the wait was 20 minutes.  After waiting 30 minutes and noticing multiple open tables and multiple parties leaving, we asked why we hadn't been seated yet? We were then told 10 more minutes.  Once we sat down it took about 10 minutes for our server to come and ask for drinks. By this time we knew what we wanted to eat. Keep in mind the restaurant was not busy as there were 10-12 available tables just in our section.  I asked for cheese on my burger and got it without cheese, so the wait to eat was extended. At this rate we had been there for an hour.  A different server brought our food out, didn't ask if we wanted any condiments and just left. I tried to make eye contact with our server from a distance, once she saw our food had come out she turned in a different direction and didn't even bother to come and see if all was ok.  Our server approached the table next to us. At this point I was able to get her attention and ask for ketchup and ranch. We asked for two ranch sauces and got one. We asked for the second one and got it 10 minutes later.  After requesting for the check and providing my debt card we sat there for 10 minutes before our server took care of the bill.  While waiting for our server to take care of the bill  a party sitting next to us began to complain about the service. One person in a sarcastic voice said we got out napkins I'm sure it will take 30 minutes before we get out drinks. Overall it took us over 2 hours to eat and leave on a Wednesday night. I've gotten faster service on a weekend at different restaurants. What a joke.  NEVER AGAIN WILL I EAT AT THE GLENDALE LOCATION. TERRIBLE SERVICE. SAVE YOURSELF THE TIME, MONEY, and FRUSTRATION AND EAT SOMEWHERE ELSE."
Andrew P.,"Glendale, CA",100,4,,5.0,6/4/2017,"So I came in for a late night pizooki, I came through the take out side because I was getting it to go, I waited for nearly 10 min before I was helped, I guess the person the was supposed to be there  was out somewhere else. Needless to say Eddie Williams (waiter) helped me out right away asked what kind I wanted he said it would be out shortly, while I waited he came back and offered anything to drink since I had been waiting so long, I just asked for  water, shortly after my pizooki came out, I just wanted to say thank you to Eddie for the great service and that it was really appreciated!"
Jay J.,"Glendale, CA",15,14,,5.0,10/14/2017,Ordered through doordash delivery and everything was prepared and cooked just like we ordered (even with some of my special instructions). I will definitely order again because their menu has a lot that I want to try and they impressed me with the great taste and just getting the order perfect! That is a rare thing in this town and they have it! Looking forward to visiting on Brand blvd. in the future too. Thank you!
Cara H.,"Glendale, CA",537,780,464,4.0,2/1/2016,"Very reasonably priced, good food. I had the lemon pepper wings and they were dry rub and crispy like them, but a little on the salty side. The brussel sprouts were very flavorful, but again a little on the salty side.  The pizookie is so good! I liked the white chocolate mac nut cookie and the cookies and cream. I will be back for more! The committed double ipa did the job!!  I loved the garlic knots! I ate three!  The chicken alfredo was pretty good.  I remember liking the deep dish pizza on my first visit.  Tonya was an amazing server! She made us feel like she was hooking us up. I got to try a couple beers and the clam chowder and tomato soup. I definitely will order some soup next time."
Jennifer R.,"Downtown, Glendale, CA",145,3,,5.0,10/5/2017,"The best sevice and food was so satisfying, live in burbank and come to thia location specifically , really good time !"
Coyote B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,9,14,5.0,5/23/2017,"Had lunch here. Ordered Brewhouse burger with bacon and cheese. Man, you know you in trouble when you get a knife with your burger. A very tasty burger, the knife was very helpful. If you're s stout fan order the Tananka Stout.... it really rocks with an 8% alcohol content (I came for lunch and it was only $3+ a pint regularly $6+). Got a great buzz going after a few. Worth looking into!"
Criselda E.,"Glendale, CA",257,47,19,1.0,10/10/2016,"I love BJ's. I have the rewards card and I always feel like I get great value. HOWEVER, this BJ's is by far the worst! First of all our drinks took 30 mins to come to our table. We got our food before we got our drink orders, and it was the first thing they asked us.  I felt like our server was rushed even though the place was pretty empty. He barely checked on our drinks as they were getting empty. We came with two other couples and when we received the check it took them 15 mins to figure out how to divide it. I've never had problems dividing checks anywhere! Even other BJ's!  Lastly they used a coupon from my rewards program but they had the coupon on promotion. I'm upset they used out earned rewards instead of using the promotion they were already running.  This is the 5th time I've been here, and it's always so slow in service and I feel like they just don't take care of you."
Adam Neil Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",47,56,41,1.0,3/23/2017,"Man, BJ's was the go-to. Good food, awesome desserts - you couldn't go wrong... Then I came to the BJ's in Glendale and it kinda all went out the window. Check-in was quick. We were initially told 30-40 minutes but we were seated in about 15. When the hostess called our name, she grabbed 2 menus, and led us to our table. She put the menus on the table and walked away. No words the whole time...I don't expect a full conversation but not even a, ""Welcome!"", ""How are you today?"", ""Enjoy your meal!"", or even better, ""Your server will be right with you."" She just walked away. And it was awkward.  We sat for about 10 minutes before our server came over. There was a game on and so I understand it's busy, but just like the hostess, this guy was not great with words. Very dry and expressionless. The food was just okay. Didn't really have too much flavor...seems like it's all a re-heat job in the back and it made me sad because I don't remember BJ's being like this. Our server never asked if the food came out okay, didn't offer any extra condiments - nothing. Even when ordering desserts, he started to walk away before we were finished telling him what we wanted.  Never again."
Amy K.,"Los Angeles, CA",1131,794,711,1.0,7/23/2016,"I had my rehearsal dinner here because we wanted a quick and easy place that could accommodate a large group and bottom line is that it was freaking 50 degrees which is pretty much a death sentence in LA, and for 20 people they had only 2 working heat lamps. What is this the hunger games of trying to get warm? I was the bride, so I supposed to make a decision on who gets to be near a heat lamp and who gets to freeze?  The food was OK, reservation process was OK and service was OK but honestly when you're dressed for summer and stuck here for a meal for like 2 hours because it's a stupid rehearsal dinner you're going to have a bad time.  I ended up getting up in the middle of dinner to go purchase a jacket because I couldn't stand it anymore. They've known about this reservation for weeks, and still did nothing about the pitiful state of their heat lamps.  Also, parking sucks here, you have to park in another structure and walk a significant distance, not good for my 90 year old grampy."
