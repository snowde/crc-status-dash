Stephy S.,"San Francisco, CA",4998,2603,1054,3.0,3/22/2010,"Being who I am and having been where I've been, when a friend informed me that her Bday Bar Crawl was happening on Brand Blvd in Glendale and starting at the very corporate chain restaurant/bar called BJ's, well, my first thought was ""ugh."" I ain't gonna lie.  However, since I missed her dearly and hadn't seen her in many many moons, I pushed that ugh under the rug and decided I was going to go where ever we were going so I could see her.  Well that, and I was told Damon's was a stop on the crawl and that is one of my fave places around, sooo, hehe, that helped. And so I scuddled on down to Glendale, parked in the mighty structure and made my way into corporate happy hour. I ordered a Greyhound and when it arrived and I was told it was only $4.50 for a gigantic glass of it, well, my tune changed. This may not be so bad after all. As I caught up with friends at the bar and eyeballed the food it looked like what I would expect from a chain called BJ's. Most of it was colorful and had zig zaggy sauce stripes across the plates of nachos or bruschetta. There was the resident cheese dip of some sort that almost tempted me, but knowing there was a Damon's cheeseburger in my future, I stood strong. The crowd seemed to be a nice bunch of after work folks. Some dressed in ties, some perhaps coworkers sneaking off for a date/drink after work and definitely a few first dates. I love people watching and am pretty good at it and definitely heard a few, ""soo, what kind of movies do you like!"" Aha, first date 101. There was also a nice pair of gentlemen sitting at a table with a number of free seats who kindly offered them up to us girls standing around the bar. And here I read that chivalry was dead! Very cool indeed. Overall, BJ's is what it is. It's a chain and if you don't mind chains, then this will suit ya just fine. I however still and will most likely always prefer the mom and pops, but hey, that's just me. Enjoy your festive nachos platter and bday cookie plates ;)"
Gevo Z.,"Tujunga, CA",344,24,,4.0,7/24/2013,"I like this BJ's because its a layed back place, and its fun to relax and hang out with friends and family. The service is good most of the times, and if your having a bad time just talk to the manager and they always take care of the situation. The food is good to. the whole place with food service and environment overall is good."
Phoebe M.,"Los Angeles, CA",97,33,54,2.0,4/14/2013,"Since I'm not a native to California, I just discovered BJ's within the last year or so, but have always visited the Huntington Beach location.  And I must say, this one is not as good.  I became addicted to their mozzarella sticks when I used to hang out in Huntington a lot, but now that Glendale is closer by (and this location is right down the street from the Americana), it only made sense that I should go there instead.  The food was all decent, but not as good as what I've experienced at the Huntington location, and the chicken fried steak I tried as an entrée definitely was not for me.  Our server was not the friendliest of folks, although she did her job of keeping our glasses full and getting our meal out in a timely manner.  She just didn't seem very happy to be there and honestly seemed pretty robotic, which for me can really ruin an experience in a restaurant.  I don't get a chance to go out very much, but I can definitely say that when I go to the Americana area from now on, BJ's will not be in my agenda."
Alexis R.,"Los Angeles, CA",65,107,,3.0,2/27/2013,"So, I like this location better than Burbank in a way. Maybe I just had more of a fun time on this particular occasion. Anyway, their happy hour is great! And they have a huge selection of beer from their own brewery which is really good! Also, tried a couple of their mixed drinks which were great. I really liked one called ""The Blue Eyed Blonde"". That was very tasty!  I also enjoyed their avocado rolls, the sauce to dip them in is really good. Their lettuce wraps were just alright; And the buffalo chicken pizza was really not my thing. Don't get me wrong, my bf absolutely loved it, but as for me I can pass on that one for sure. I would come here for happy hour to watch a game & have some appetizers, but that's pretty much it."
Raymond M.,"Los Angeles, CA",152,244,40,3.0,1/11/2011,"I've been to plenty of BJ's in my day, and I stopped by this location in Glendale after meeting my bro at work. For starters, the parking situation for this whole plaza is kinda whack. There's little to no street parking and the structure you're supposed to park in is always super backed up because most people in Glendale don't know how to drive!! As for the restaurant, I didnt' really have any complaints. We got there around 6pm, just before the large dinner rush and we didn't even have to wait for a table. We wanted to sit at the bar but it was full (it was the day of the BCS Championship game...so understood). Waitress was nice. She explained the different types of beer (I already know them all by heart) and I ordered the Hef.  I really like their burgers here. I always get the Grilled Sourdough burger with cheese and bacon!! Damn good. Not really of the fries (the wedge or the shoestring) which is unfortunate because I LOVE ME SOME FRIES!!! Pizzas are usually pretty darn good as well, but they can be a little pricey and ""over the top"" for some people."
Jessica M.,"Los Angeles, CA",23,12,7,4.0,5/9/2013,"Beer, pizza, pizookie. Yeah. Always good times at BJ's   :P"
Toni R.,"Placentia, CA",68,108,116,1.0,7/9/2014,slowest service! the place was practically empty and yet it took too long to get some water and food to be ordered.
Miki O.,"West Los Angeles, CA",74,67,,3.0,1/5/2011,"BJs will always be overpriced. . . so just need to remember that when ur going in to one. . . anywho, thursday night around 7:30pm ish, decided to wait the hour for a table b/c my 2 friends n i hopped around other restaurants n were told the same thing, if not longer... what wasss good though is that while we waited, they passed around free bite sized pizza for the people who were waiting for tables. yums. all the food ordered: flatbread california club pizza flatbread grilled chicken pesto chocolate chunk pizookie flatbread pizzas were good. i wish they put more pesto sauce on the grilled chicken pesto cuz it was kinda bland without it. . .  i will nevr really be a fan of the pizookies cuz the cookie is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay way way to sweet for me. but i had a teeny tiny bite of it to confirm the sweetness. yep. not for me. their beers are always good. service was good too."
Fred C.,"Los Angeles, CA",48,24,5,2.0,8/6/2010,"BJ's is your standard American food.  Nothing fancy and nothing spectacular.  Nice beer menu though.  Overall, a decent three star place to eat. What throws it down to two though is the craptacular service.  I'm talking about the Glendale one though, this may not apply to the Burbank one.  I haven't eaten there in a while.  Anyways, I went here to eat with my girlfriend (this was a while ago).  Once the waitress served us our food, we proceeded to get ignored while: (pick one) A.  waiting for refills B.  waiting to get our check  C.  waiting to pay for our check D.  waiting for our ordered desserts E.  WTF all of the above This didn't need to be a list... We asked for a manager and got the kitchen chef.  We were supposed to get a refund for dessert for the time we spent waiting but no, they messed that up to and again, we had to wait while they fixed it.  ZOMG.  This is getting ridiculous.  The manager eventually comes out of his hiding place to talk to us and tries to put on a jester act.  Lol, it was laughable.  Pathetic attempt at customer service, and no one wanted to speak up for it.  Except for the kitchen chef guy.  Hats off to you, sir.  You have my respect. We haven't gone back since.  I don't know if the manager is still there or what but the experience has killed any thought of going back.  If you're thinking of going here, just keep in mind that it'll be hit or miss. It's not going to get one star because the food is decent.  Hopefully no one else gets treated like we did."
Yakshita D.,"Los Angeles, CA",15,27,,4.0,3/15/2011,"In general, BJ's are pretty good, but this is my favorite one near USC.  The service is great, and the food is quite delicious.  The spinach and artichoke deep dish pizza is quite good (but if you're looking for real Chicago style deep dish, you've got the wrong place).  Don't leave without their Pizookie - freshly baked cookies with ice cream on top.  Simple though it may be, the chocolate chip with vanilla ice cream is definitely their best!"
John S.,"La Cañada Flintridge, CA",163,224,11,1.0,12/17/2012,"I used to go to BJs back in college, but BJs no longer tastes good. It's like eating fast food delivery pizza now."
Janet N.,"Los Angeles, CA",241,197,46,4.0,3/16/2010,"Went straight to the bar and had myself a Long Island. No complaints. Service was the usual - our waiter, Joe, was always reliable and on his feet. And the food here is better than the usual, probably because we were pretty buzzed throughout the 4 hours we were there. Besides my buzz givin' them a 4, on the way out of the lot, we happened to catch Joe giving pizza to the parking booth guy. My drunk friend asked if she can have the rest of the pizza  and he gave her the whole box containing 3/4 of the whole pie. He's fucking awesome. So my sober-self gives them a four, as well."
Ti M.,"Jacksonville, FL",741,628,125,4.0,12/5/2007,"Where to start a Glendale Bar Crawl...hmm.........let's see...??!!  Oh yes, BJ's...great. So me and my lovely partner in crime walked to BJs...enjoyed a bottle of wine and some apps.  The service was busy, fun, inviting, and all the bartenders were dudes.  Not such a bad thing for us two taken ladies.  ;)   We had the mini burgers which were DELIGHTFUL!   Overall 4 stars.... So where else did the night take us?  Well, vodka shots at Bar FN with Francisco, a cab to Big Foot Lodge for more vodka, and the the Griffin for more vodka.  Let's just say it wasn't an easy morning. We both crawled out of bed and aimless headed for our front doors for some huge brunch at the Alcove.....looking like butt and nasty morning breath we enjoyed some delicious rosemary potatoes and bacon. Priceless times with the ladies!"
Elizabeth C.,"Los Angeles, CA",932,443,848,5.0,3/5/2010,"BJs are awesome. So is this restaurant. Endless soup and salad is something like $7.99, which is excellent. So is the fact that they will let you switch which soup and/or salad you get from serving  to serving--PLUS FREE BREAD! You can start with the tomato basil soup and house salad (my favorite order) and then, after you finish, bam! switch it up and get the broccoli cream and Caesar salad, then bam! skip the salad entirely and just get chili. I don't know any other restaurant that allows such switchery, but it is something that should be done by every restaurant, cost efficiency be damned. Then there's the fact that service is consistently fast, and that, this being the middle of Glendale, people watching is pretty primo. So: Lunch for two for under twenty bucks, including ~20% tip + Bread + VARIETY! VARIETY! VARIETY! + A lot of weirdos = Five Stars!"
Anna J.,"Glendale, CA",0,4,,5.0,10/17/2013,Bjs has always been my number one restaurant. Talk about their chicken pasta best pasta in this area!   Their pizzokis are also great and always freshly cooked . Love it !
Javier J.,"Los Angeles, CA",1656,1996,248,2.0,2/8/2010,"As someone who has experienced a great number of BJ experiences, and enjoyed many of them without much complaints. I mean, who's going to complain about a BJ's experience? You can't complain about eating out... But when it came to this BJ experience, I have to say.. this one sort of sucked.  If you've read that paragraph in any way other than it was intended.. well then, you have a dirty mind my friend. And that's more than likely why I will call you friend. Besides, you can't blame me for making those easy jokes. The pizza place named BJ's will get mocked by me like the Costco like whole salers store chain in the South called BJ's Whole Sale which also sales BJ's Gas. Believe me, that's gas you'd want when you're getting serviced to fill you up with BJ's....  On to the review. First off, for as many times as I have been on Brand, I haven't ever really bothered coming tot his BJ's. I saw no need with a better one that felt more at home in Burbank. Not to mention that with Porto's just a stones throw away, I'd rather have myself some Porto's sandwich. So when I decided to come to this one it was a brand new BJ's experience...(I'm really not this immature.. I swear) There's something I love about BJ's (I'm not even going to try.. that one says it all itself) I love the beer. Their beer is really good and there's a variety of flavors that one can try.. So when I saw an ad for the 10th Anniversary ale, I just had to try it. So when I sat down It was the first thing I ordered. The waiter, in a rare BJ's situation let me completely down. Told me  ""Oh, sorry, we just ran out of that yesterday""  and to and insult to injury followed it up with  ""Oh it was really good.""  Dick move.. Dick move. Rub it in more how I'm not going to chug some delicious fluid down in this BJ outing.  Got to ordering pizza and the waiting game began. Now I know full well how long it normally will take for a Pizza order to get put out.. and I'm a pretty patient person, but it did feel like the pizzas took their sweet time to get out there. So when that happened we decided to order the pizookie at that point so that we can make sure we're not waiting too long after the pizza is done to get it... bad move. You could even say it was a bit of a... Boner (Ooooooooh!)  Most places would wait a while to put the order in, they were really quick to the punch and the pizookie came out while we were still working through the pizza. What the hell, timing should be a major sticking point. A good server doesn't bring out desert so quickly. It's sort of premature at that point. And really, the last thing you want is all your stuff to come out quickly..   Pizookie was good, but how could they not be considering what it's made out of. It was the happy ending to an otherwise lack luster BJ's experience.  The management would like to apologize for any crude language and lame puns in this review."
Lea N.,"Duarte, CA",155,171,146,2.0,11/15/2010,"BJ's...it's a bitter sweet relationship with this franchise and I. I like the food but hate the service! We came here on Friday with a group of 15 (WAIT TIME WAS 1 HOUR)-granted we were a large group and the waitress was already guaranteed her 18% gratuity, but seriously, you couldn't do one simple task? My fiancé and I clearly asked her to separate our check from the rest of the group to avoid financial confusion at the end-needless to say, she couldn't even manage that! The food finally came out after 40 starving minutes-still tasty, but at this point I could've eaten anything! Our Order: 2 sodas 1 cocktail BBQ pulled pork sliders w/ thin fries Classic BJ's cheeseburger Avocado Eggrolls **Very good** Our total: appx $60.00 The food is pretty good, but definitely not my first choice of restaurants due to the lack of service and listening skills."
Jessica A.,"North Hollywood, CA",261,166,769,5.0,1/2/2010,"When you combine an already busy night + a family of 17 coming in to a restaurant, what do you expect usually? Poor slow service or rushed food? Not at this BJ's. I think i fell in love with our waitor from the get go but that has nothing to do with my 5 stars ;) I've never been to a restaurant with more than 10 people so when I saw how fast they seated us and how fast our waitresses/waitors were attentive to us I was very pleased. Right away they introduced themselves to us, took our drinks, and placed our appetizers. As our drinks came, we had 3 waitors and I could hear the small conversations each one stirred up with my family members. How cute? Their menu is grand, I couldn't select just one thing so I just went with the Crispy Chicken Sandwich. I recommended the desserts to my family since everyone was asking me what dish they should order. Thankfully each section of the table ordered different appetizers AND main courses. I'm not sure on B.J's policies when it comes to parties larger than 7 but they gave us 24 free beer shots! It was the most nicest gesture. I'm not a beer drinker BUT i had two shots! (forcefully shugged by my brother and uncles)   Kids ordered chicken tenders and burgers. The women ordered pasta and sandwiches, the men ordered steak and chicken.  We never ran out of our drinks, our service was super attentive and even the manager came out and asked each of us how we were doing and asked with a smile!  This B.J's sits right on the corner of grand avenue before The Americana Mall. Its structured fairly big but makes you feel adequately comfortable. The inside lounge had a fireplace and looked cozy as the outside was more spacious but very New York-like.   Service Great! Food Delicious! Atmosphere Comfortable! Three things you should look for while dining out and BJ's at grand avenue offers."
Wenders B.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,137,19,2.0,12/16/2012,"There was no one to seat us, when we finally got seated we ordered our food,  I ordered some sort of sandwich which  I thought was good. My friend ordered some fish which she said didn't look like the picture and wasn't that great. The waitress only came to get our order and to give us our check and never once came back in between to see if we needed anything else and she forgot to bring us the plates for the appetizers, so I left her a tip that matched the service she provided. Needless to say, their service needs improvement."
Chris G.,"London, United Kingdom",132,393,68,3.0,3/10/2010,"Once again, my girlfriend suggested BJ's, and with the experience that she showed me last time... I was NOT going to refuse. Except, this time, she was INSISTING that I ate something.  Even worse... she was INSISTING that I had to PAY for BJs. Nonetheless, the food there was actually very, so much so, that I did not mind to pay. The service at BJ's was very friendly and I truly enjoyed chatting to the staff. Now, I want BJ's more than ever, now that I know really love it and can't live without it!"
