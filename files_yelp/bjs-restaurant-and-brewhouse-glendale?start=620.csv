Benjamin S.,"Los Angeles, CA",460,460,191,4.0,9/11/2012,"I've been going to BJ's for roughly 15 years (started at the one in Balboa while attending college) and even worked at the one in Burbank right after graduating from college for a few months.  Love their food, and when the Glendale location opened, I was excited that they followed me from Newport Beach to Burbank and then to Glendale.  I come here fairly often (and plan on going on Sunday, actually) as the pizza is very addictive.  I like where the Glendale location is though now that I've moved out of downtown Glendale, I'll have to find parking instead of just walking, but I hear that's not too bad.  The look of the place is awesome except for one thing.  I HATE all the TVs.  Either go with a classy look, or go with a sports bar look.  Combining the two looks silly.  Keep the TV's in the bar area, I know from working at BJs that they get good crowds to watch the game and in the Burbank location that made sense as the restaurant is more sports-bar looking.  This location could be more of a classy look to it without TV's every 3 feet apart.  Favorite pizzas?  All of them.  LOVE the pizzookie.  Probably my all-time favorite dessert.  All but the Red Velvet one.  Keep that for cupcakes and cakes, not for cookies.  Beef Dip sandwhich is also great and I'm a huge fan of the crispy chicken salad.  Servers are okay depending on who you get."
Mary S.,"Van Nuys, CA",31,43,4,1.0,4/5/2012,"I do not understand why Yelp does not allow you to give a place no stars. This BJ's does not even deserve half a star. One of the worst BJ's Restaurants I have been to and one of the worst services received from a restaurant. The whole place reeked of bad service. The bad funk started right when we walked in. The girl handling the front desk was so incompetent and had no professionalism. I get that it was packed but you need to keep your cool and do your job. I could have slapped her and that would not have helped. We finally get seated and had to wait several minutes (well over 15) to get a menu just to look at. We actually had to get up and ask another waiter to bring over a menu. When our waiter finally comes around she introduces herself and this man she was training. Before I continue with the rest of the bad funk..... Why would you have the MOST incompetent employee training new staff.....WHYYYYYY????? We were starving when we arrived here and we probably lost about five pounds waiting for our food to come out after we finally ordered it. When they finally did bring the food out my Asian Chicken salad had NOOOO dressing....none what so ever. Really if I needed to cut down on calories I would have told you. My cousins California Chkn sandwich did not have mayo and it was requested and my friends order was actually okay. My cousin did not make it a big deal and decided to eat it anyway UNTIL she realized the chicken was bloody and raw. We then had to hunt down our server because she disappeared again. We did not find her but found the man that was in training. He apologized and took the plate away and said he will have the server come by. My cousin waited over 10 minutes for the server to come by. The whole time we thought they were bringing out a new plate but instead she just came over to ask if my cousin wanted a new sandwich and that the manager would be over to speak with us shortly after. My cousin asked for another COOKED sandwich.  When the manager came over (which we had not requested) he was not apologetic at all. He had the nerve to tell my cousin that they were not trying to kill her or anything.....and not even in a sarcastic way...So then he got a mouthful from us. We waited several minutes after and still no new sandwich for my cousin. You would think these people would make it a priority after they ""tried to kill her"" by feeding her raw chicken. We once again went on a hunt for our server (who was not apologetic at all) and told her we were leaving and wanted the check. We told her we do not want the sandwich or to be here for another second.  The trainee apologized and tried to be as accommodating as he could but what can a trainee do for us.  You would think our server would try to get us out of there fast since we were not so friendly at this point. Instead we had to ask another waiter to hunt her down so we can pay our bill (minus the sandwich) and get the heck out of there. My friend actually tried to tip our waiter but we had to stop her. Tip her for what....the horrible service and her attitude. Never going back to this place again and I hope others wont after reading this review."
Danny L.,"Burbank, CA",0,43,,5.0,6/22/2013,The times when Tonya was my server she always remembered what I wanted.  We both have been stuck in an elevator & she told me not to get stuck in any more elevators & I told her I''ll try not to.
Wes S.,"Ventura, CA",1351,866,624,4.0,3/10/2008,"I love BJ's. Particularly this location. They have a HUGE, HUGE, HUGE theater like screen in the middle of the bar and numerous LCD's scattered throughout the restaurant. My friend B and I were invited to a all-you-can-eat Birthday dinner for our friend Walter.  We decided to come earlier than the original dinner time because it happened to be NBA All-Star weekend and we were able to catch the 3-point shoot out and dunk competition. On the to the food! We were graced with a salad, potato skins, chicken wings, and pizza for the all-you-can-eat festivities. Everything was really good and worth the price we paid ($17/person). My only gripe was the staff was a bit slow on refilling the food for our little banquet. Didn't they know they were feeding about 30 people (mostly college students and Yelpers)? What were they thinking? Overall, the staff was attentive, except for the speed of the food. Of course to end the night, Mama Goose decided to order a HUGE pizooki and it was a perfect ending to the evening."
Ruben N.,"Alhambra, CA",230,138,46,3.0,7/22/2010,"Something about it's BREWMASTER aura and black-wearing wait staff screams DINNER DATE. And I'm talking like you're better than sizzler but you're not cute enough for P.F. Changs. (I kid I Love both). ** I really think it's trying to yell ""I'm TRYING TOO HARD!!!"" ** Don't get me wrong, I'm fine with the MASSIVE selection of everything  (even though I couldn't find my way from desserts to appetizers). I'm cool with fact that all of your 4 person tables can turn into a 100 person banquet hall with a couple of snaps.  The menu doesn't have to be written like a Oil drilling moratorium. Just give the people SIMPLE. Simple as in ""I'll have the BURGER and FRIES"" not sophisticated like ""Gimme the low carb-fat free-diet distilled water with a side of B.S on a plate"" I can see right through BJs and I can just tell they are trying their damnedest to please everyone. But as you've probably heard in the past, if you try to do everything, you will never do any ONE thing WELL.  Sure, the waiter might have been background actor #5 in the latest action flick, but instead of mastering his scene dialogue, I'd prefer he'd get my order right PLEASE (the first time!). (SIDE NOTE) Must respect to the BULLS but Chicago makes a horrible pizza style. Pizza has SAUCE....not whole tomatoes. (/SIDE NOTE) But enough of my trash talking -- I'm here to talk about MY EXPERIENCE. It' was OK. I enjoyed the new york strip steak -- could have used garlic bread with that dish (now I'm just being petty). I was impressed the manager made it a point to correct the annoying, yet minor mishaps of the evening. I'm not jonesin' to come a-running back for more, but I'd probably go back. Will there be a 2nd Dinner date? Don't call me... I'll call you fin."
Lester C.,"San Francisco, CA",8,21,,4.0,2/16/2013,Great place to have a beer and watch sports. Sitting outside on the patio is nice during the summer but no TVs out there.
Cherlyn E.,"Scottsdale, AZ",8,136,4,3.0,5/23/2012,Very slow and in reliable service at bar. 2nd visit in two weeks. So this is real.
Erica R.,"Oxnard, CA",15,95,1,3.0,9/19/2010,"BJ's is a good place to go if you want a beer.  If you want food, however, maybe you should go somewhere else. This BJ's has a great selection of beer and even beer flights, but the food is just okay.  It's just your typical American fare.  The pizookie, of course, is delicious, but I've only ordered it once since I've been too full (and too cheap) to order it again.   I've found that this BJ's is lacking in customer service.  I have to ask for my water to be refilled and once, I asked for water and didn't get it.  It also takes awhile for the check to come.  This is one of those places in which every time you need the waiter, he's never around and whenever you don't need him, he seems to pop up.   With standard food and no extraordinary service, this is one of those places you should stop by if you're super hungry and want a good beer, but not if there's a much better restaurant around (which in Glendale, there are plenty of other places). And in case you're wondering, I've been trying to figure out what the ""BJ"" in BJ""s Restaurant and Brewhouse stands for.  It's apparently some great mystery because so far, I can't find the information online or the official website....it can't really stand for the obvious, can it??? Update: I emailed BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse to ask what the BJ in the restaurant stood for and the director of operations emailed me back with the following response: ""As far as what BJ's stands for it is just a name no meaning behind it.  The original owners picked BJ's as the name it does not stand for anything.  I hope that helps.""   So either the original owners were smart - or geniuses!!!"
Bill E.,"Orange, CA",98,166,21,3.0,11/21/2010,I brought a potential client here for lunch last week. I like the part of town as there are tons of restaurant choices. I had a salad and it was good.. it was a bit noisy but not too bad. It wasnt too busy when we were here and the service was good.
Donny F.,"Glendale, Los Angeles, CA",286,32,4,5.0,12/12/2012,The happy hour deals are awesome. Mini pizzas are half off. The beers are really good.
Frank D.,"South Pasadena, CA",14,111,1,4.0,10/29/2010,Went here for my bday. Food is pretty good. Service is slow depending on who's helping you. Staff is generally accommodating. Prices on food are not too bad but the portions are adequate. Avocado rolls are a must. People are amazed. We ended up with a sampler and more avocado rolls. They are definitely worth it.  The Manager is a cool guy. He was alright about changing thr channel. They had Tennis on the big screen. Nice to see blondes running around but we wanted to watch the football game. I know typical guy thing right? I'd recommended this place and for sure I'll be back.
Maggie A.,"Los Angeles, CA",213,192,1,2.0,1/14/2011,"Average.  Not great, not bad. My friend and I both had the unlimited soup and salad.  We each had one of each, incidentally; their soups are quite filling. The tomaaahto bisque, which is what I had, was seasoned well, as thick as it should have been and brought piping hot.  I dug it.  Oh, but the croutons were way too salty; I had to take them out.   The salad was just very basic.  Hard to screw up (although I suppose you could put wilted lettuce, and they didn't) when you think about it.   We also shared a chocolate chunk PIZZOOKIE.  Vanilla bean ice cream on top of a brownie.  Can't go wrong there either. Like I said, not terrible, not great.  Solid two stars."
Daisy C.,"Los Angeles, CA",317,193,540,3.0,2/5/2008,"This place is beautiful! Come here when you want to watch a game, their big flat HD screens will fill your fancy for you sport lovers. For their foods, I tried their steak, chicken sandwich (which tasted like the chicken sandwich from jack in the box :[   ) ribs, chicken, garden salad, their combo appetizer platter pizookiii and potato skins. O and also their blackened chicken pasta which was nooo good! I wouldn't get their steak again. It was flavorless and I am a huge steak fan... The ribs and chicken were very charred.  I think the die for foods their is their potato skins which is sooooooooo delicious!! and their artichoke dip isn't bad at all. Their side garden salad is goood too! lol. but everything else, *struggggsss* Their oriental salad is pretty good. And of course their famous pizooookkii! Go to drink, and potato skins! that should do it! I will upload some photos of the food. ps. Pasta is no goood! -daisy"
Rob V.,"Verdugo City, CA",0,99,,1.0,7/28/2013,"I went with my wife for the Happy Hour and we were very disappointed. When we entered the bar area, there were a lot of dirty tables. The waiters and waitresses didn't seem to care much, they were too busy talking with each other. The bartender was sweet and we ordered some food and drinks. The martinis were ok but the food was mediocre at best. We couldn't finish the flatbread and the potstickers. What was the manager doing? And the chef? He definetely needs to go back to culinary school."
Fred B.,"Glendale, CA",507,122,,2.0,9/19/2011,"One of the few places open late in Glendale where you can watch sports-center and have a beer.   The customer service is terrible at best.  You might sit at the bar-top tables for a good while before anyone acknowledges your presence. They do have happy hour at the bar at night, which means half off all mini-pizzas and pizookies - and a few bucks off beers. My beer was warm, my food was cold.  If the circumstances were flipped around, I would be a happy camper!"
Ieb G.,"Irvine, CA",0,23,1,3.0,7/6/2013,"The GOOD: The food was pretty good. Had the NY steak. It was cooked properly, but just slightly on the tough side. (I ate it all...was not too tough to give up). However, while cutting into the steak, it took enough force to operate the knife, that my plate kept sliding on the table. The Chili side was pretty good; a little bland, but hints of chili flavor existed. Chili is a personal thing; others can rave about BJ's chili while some will not like it. Calamari: overcooked, dry, rubbery. Table across the aisle ordered calamari as well, and quickly abandoned it. The BAD: Defective management roll call: Server not aware of facebook special. Implied my coupon was bogus. ""Let me check with the manager- I would sure hate for you to order and find out it won't be accepted"". (You BETTER accept it, it's a legitimate coupon issued by BJ's, b#@C$). Delivery: Slammed with the 2 sides (chili and salad), followed by the steak a few minutes later. I was able to finish the chili and just started on the salad when the steak was delivered, which started cooling down right in front of me. Food runner should make a pre-run,,,,,,is the customer ready yet? have old plates been cleared to make room yet? OVERALL: Maybe will be back. They are not on my no-fly list."
James K.,"Glendale, CA",105,37,125,3.0,2/26/2008,"If you want decent service and a knowledgeable staff...well then go to a different BJ's. Food is fine, tastes like all the other BJ's.   But the staff...bring my experience down.  They seem like they are all new to the restaurant industry so their steps of service makes my dining experience flow awkwardly.  They have been open for a couple months and it still seems like they dont know what they are doing.   I go there for the bar.  I agree with andrea when she says you get faster, better service...only because the bar tender cant forget about you cuz he's right there."
Liz S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,1.0,8/21/2011,"I have been coming to this location because it is near my job but after last night I will longer bother to come here. Our waitress Emily took a really long time to take our orders and took even longer to bring us our check. when we were ready to pay, she informed my friend and I that our cards were not going through.  We asked to speak to the manager Chris and he was completely rude and unprofessional.    I'll stick to paying top dollar for great food and service"
Cris Z.,"Glendale, Los Angeles, CA",2,10,1,1.0,11/26/2012,"Gave this place 4 chances every time I had very bad service. Don't ask for much just fill my cup and  ask what I want to eat.. Nothing I waited for 15 mins just for some one to get my order. After I'm served no one asks me anything. Had to go to the myself to get a refill. It's a sit in place I expect someone to ask if I'm ok or if I need anything. Two thumbs down. I don't expect much from any place I go to eat but if Im tipping, I expect some kind of service."
Armine K.,"Glendale, CA",1,8,,5.0,7/18/2014,Pizookie party platter! Great service and staff. Love the Irish Root Beer.
