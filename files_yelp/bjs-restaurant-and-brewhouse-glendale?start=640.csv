C N.,"Pasadena, CA",4,13,,1.0,5/3/2012,"Wow!!! What a terrible meal! Probably our fault for going during a LA Kings game but really - A 5 cheese pizza that did not have cheese covering the pizza. So A thick crust pizza that was simply a bread pizza with coverage not even considered moderate. Will take me a long time to forgive and forget this disaster! Hell, there are plenty of good places to go spend 45 w tip not to feel screwed over! Not me again for a long time. The gf was warned after this one."
Morgan M.,"Los Angeles, CA",29,139,19,1.0,11/24/2012,"Super slow service, probably because we were here for a birthday and the tip automatically came on the bill. No fun anything for our friend, no free dessert, very little flexibility with moving tables."
Sandyy E.,"Glendale, CA",65,15,2,2.0,1/17/2013,Always end up coming here when I'm with a group of friends and are indecisive about where to eat. The service isn't great. The food is alright. They're open pretty late and their drinks are good. That's it.
Linh T.,"San Gabriel, CA",26,95,14,3.0,8/17/2012,"Came here early Sat for lunch with some friends. Food is okay, it was just a good time seeing friends after a long time. We had two pizzas, chips & salsa, and fried calamari. I like the fried calamari, had a lot of it i guess because I only had one slice of pizza when they came out lol. But, I think i'm just biased on their pizza from my very first bad experience at BJ's years ago. Maybe someday I will learn to like the pizza. The waiter brought out the wrong check to use TWICE. How is that possible? I'm not really sure. But we were tempted to pay and go because it would have been cheaper lol. But we told her it was the wrong one because we didn't want to get her in trouble."
Jackie D.,"Los Angeles, CA",637,340,83,3.0,9/10/2009,"Standard. Cant expect much. I really wanted to write and just say I had their Turkey Cobb sandwhich on sourdough yesterday and its extremely juicy, tasty and yummy with skinny fries. It really hit the spot. Of course I had one of their classic, famous Pazookis. Chocolate chip with a HUGE scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Service was slow and the beer was good."
Homer J.,"San Diego, CA",127,69,5,4.0,7/7/2010,"Best Happy Hour around Huge Bar, Ton's of t.v.'s  Staff is cool and friendly, managers are old and never say a word... I love the Blonde, but not so fond of the other beers.  that about sums it up...    Hey, 4 stars is a good review !!!"
Jonathan D.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,104,3,3.0,12/18/2010,"Typical BJs. same pizza, same beer, which is all pretty good, for a little higher than average prices.  However, the one in Glendale (and maybe it was because I went there on a non-weekend night) had prompt service and we were seated right away.  Other BJs (Westwood, Culver City) are flooded with people and you can never get a seat in good time, even if you make a reservation."
Kim H.,"Orange County, CA",25,7,4,1.0,8/11/2013,"Ya seriously worst BJs I've ever been to! RUDE ASS STAFF. The chick that showed us the table look like she just came out of a trash can and had a stank ass look on her face the whole time. she just threw us at a table and gave us the menus and told us to pass them out ourselves then left.  Did not feel welcomed at all. Takes forever to do ANYTHING...food was cold when it FINALLY came out, and they messed up one of our orders and it never came out and they didn't even bother to check up on us about it, which it didn't even come out until after everyone had finished eating. I had to ask three different people for more sauce. Then the waitress had a fit about us splitting the bill because it wasn't ""easy on her"". I swear we were there for at least 4 hours. It was so bad I was sober by the time we were leaving...need I say more?"
Adija R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,3.0,9/7/2014,Our sever was great his name was drake. However my food was horrible. My boyfriends burger was great but they just couldn't get my food right
Patrick K.,"Glendale, CA",1,19,4,1.0,5/3/2013,"I like BJ's for their beers. I used to like their food, but the quality of their food has drastically declined. My 1-start rating is for this *specific* (Glendale) location because they have the absolute *worst* service! I kid-you-not. On multiple occasions, my party and I have had to ask for utensils numerous times before getting them. If you sit at the outside patio area and need their torches lit, good luck with that! The employees are also very disgruntled and seem to not like one another, which explains the poor service. I avoid this location even though it is almost walking distance from my place and I go to an alternate BJ's location where the staff is much happier with their work environment and so are much more pleasant when they are serving you. Still, food quality, not what it used to be."
Joe M.,"Encino, CA",74,12,,1.0,2/7/2013,"I ordered 3 entree's from this location, online. I waited almost 40 minutes to drive to the location when it was supposed to be time to pick it up. When I got there I waited an additional 12 minutes until it was ready. When I got back to my office I realized they forgot one of the entree's. They had almost an hour to get my online order of 3 entree's ready, and they THEN forgot one of the entrees on top of that. Wack service. Make dinner at home, you'll save time."
Mark A.,"Los Angeles, CA",374,435,670,3.0,4/18/2008,"Came to this particular location because my buddy's dad works for the CO and they let us know of grand openings to get in on free food. At least they didn't screw up our orders! It was a tad sluggish, but people being new and all, it went ok. They've got some cuties working here. You can't say no to a pizookie!"
Michelle S.,"Los Angeles, CA",32,96,13,1.0,10/10/2009,Horrible service..... They brought the pizza with no plates The beer with no cups Waiter dropped glass several times  Charged extra for items we didn't even order Now for the food it was cold when we got it
Jeanette N.,"Glendale, CA",2,16,6,1.0,11/22/2012,"Came to this place with my boyfriend and a friend on a Friday night. It wasn't crazy busy, we were seated upon arriving.. Our waitress was awful! As soon as she got to our table she was rushing to take our order, we hadn't even ordered drinks yet!! A few minutes later she returns, pushy yet again! We get our food and not ONCE did she check on us, we needed napkins and refills on our drinks!! We asked the hostess for our check, she then told us our waitress was the one who had to give it to us.. Yes we know that, but we haven't seen her since we got our food! Finally she shows up, couldn't even look us in the eye! Needless to say her tip reflected her behavior! My boyfriends has gone to same place a few more times since with co-workers and he has gotten crappy service every time!! Skip this location!!"
Michelle Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",350,575,17,1.0,8/1/2011,"so this entire experience was exhausting. we showed up on a friday night in hopes to feed our pizza cravings. we should've gone elsewhere. i mean the pizza is good, but the service makes you double think the whole process. we ordered a medium pizza with pepperoni and bacon. the pizza was good. it costs $16.95. we also ordered a beer. our waiters changed mid-meal because of a break period. our waitress kept forgetting everything she would say she would be doing. she would walk around after telling us she would bring us some waters...walk by our table a few times. and then look at us and go, oh wait i was supposed to bring you water right?  so we got our bill, i didn't want to wait another 30 minutes so i just gave her the card without looking. mistake. they charged us for other items so i had to ask her to change the transaction. oof. the old charge is still on my card but we shall see... theres free 2 hour parking in the garage so that's good."
Me H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,30,1,5.0,7/5/2014,"Very nice and professional service. The wait was a bit long (about 20 minutes) but they were busy and we had a large order, so they did pretty well. The food was delicious (especially the mashed potatoes). The restaurant itself was aesthetically pleasing and in a great location. Overall, I would recommend BJs."
Marisa B.,"Los Angeles, CA",523,12,4,4.0,11/19/2013,"I actually used to work at this location, so of course there's that part of me that wants to forever hate the place haha but I've honestly got to say that I think this location has gotten some nice upgrades pretty recently! Several new booths, new dividers, and overall, the look of the restaurant just feels a lot more clean and put together these days. I came here for late-night Happy Hour, and while I'm still a tad sad about the newish ""4-5-6"" Happy Hour Menu (namely that the Mini Deep Dish Pizzas are no longer 50% off but instead $6, eliminating the steal of the century $3.50 Cheese Pizza option) my friend and I ordered Wings and Angus Beef Sliders with thin cut seasoned fries to a resounding bill of *drumroll* ... $9.81! Pretty great. I would definitely recommend coming here when Joe and/or Kat are working at the bar. We came to sit about 20 minutes early, expecting to have to just kill time until Happy Hour with a small bite or something, but Joe let us order early! And unlike many other restaurants, we didn't have to fix the bill later. It was actually sadly refreshing to have a server/bartender follow up with something like that haha 4 stars for Happy Hour but I'll update the next time I have a true meal here :)"
Roy A.,"Glendale, CA",0,11,,1.0,12/5/2013,The worst restaurant ever. Do yourself a favor and don't even think about coming here. Bad in every aspect
Pilar B.,"West LA, CA",48,314,569,3.0,6/11/2009,"There are only three words that come to mind whenever I say, ""BJ's""  1. This restaurant 2. Bartles and James 3. ________________ For all of 2007 and through the beginning of 2008, I used to come to this exact location every friggin weekend. A friend would call me up and wanted to kick it, hmmm, where to go...""Oh I know...lets go to BJ's"". ""Ok."" Off we went. The following weekend...""Let's grab a drink""...where to get a quickie...""Ummm, same spot?""...""BJ's!"" Following weekend after, ""Lets stay local""...fine...""Lets roll out to BJ's."" See the damn picture? I was beginning to feel like a darn groupie. I'd be here with someone new each time and at one point, ran into my ex. That's how small this world is...or that Glendale has to offer! I had a BJ buddy who used to roll with me here all the time; we'd sit and have a few drinks, chat it up, chill out, people watch, played with his I-phone. We even watched the Laker game :) and I lost my glasses *ahem* as a matter of fact, I lost a lot of things with this friend. Keep it clean people.I started to get bored and ventured off to another spot for drinks. I think I outlived my BJ experiences.   This place is cool to chill, have dinner and drinks. It does get crowded. The pizza, wings, and appetizers are good.  I still have to try that big ass potato with the works. Oh and I still haven't tried the Pazookie...I know, sad eh...I'm not a big fan of ice cream scoop on top of a cookie, maybe un dia! I just prefer to get at the bar for drinkee drinks. Well, if I decide to have another BJ experience, I'll drag someone with me again."
Tony Y. Jr. Y.,"Glendale, CA",63,490,1443,3.0,5/25/2009,"We came here last night for dessert and tea.  Surprisingly, there wasn't a very good selection of desserts and there was only one hot tea, Lipton.  I couldn't seem upset or didn't want to leave because my date recommended this place.  She opted to order a mojito but I don't drink alcohol, so I kept my first choice of drink, the ever so boring flavor of original black tea, at an ever so high price of $2.45 per tea bag.  Well, something is better than nothing.  In addition, we shared a dessert called the white chocolate macadamia nut pizrookie, which is simply a hot cookie in a pan with two scoops of vanilla ice cream on top.  This cookie was rather thin and quite frankly, ""nothing to write home about"".  My date had a taste for some fresh fruit but the waitress stated they only serve fruit during lunch.  So, after a smile and some convincing, I was able to get her to make an exception.  She brought a small, very small, bowl of (minced) fruit which seemed to be more appropriate for a child, at a staggering price of $3.00.  This waitress was nice but was quite sporadic in being attentive to our table.  There are tv screens throughout this restaurant and this place is very spacious.  All in all, I'll just say that I can now tell people I've been to BJ's Brewery."
