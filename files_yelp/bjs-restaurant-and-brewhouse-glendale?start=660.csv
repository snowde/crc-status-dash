Leah M.,"Glendale, CA",435,6,5,4.0,7/29/2010,"I come to BJ's often, since it's walking distance from my house. I am a huge fan of the following items on the menu: Avocado Eggrolls Spinach and Artichoke Pizza Pizookie and Jeremiah Red (beer) This combination of food will immediately release endorphins!"
G. Wilfred B.,"Glendale, CA",0,84,,3.0,9/22/2012,This is a good place. I had a bacon and blue burger which I enjoyed very much. Everything else was satisfactory. Nice for drinks and friends to watch sports on many flat screens and a huge projector screen in front of the bar. The pizzookie as usual was sweet and satisfying.
Felipe J.,"Glendale, CA",1,4,,5.0,11/16/2012,This place is just perfect. On the main strip of glendale next to everything. The bar staff are great. Havent had any issues with them at all. The food selection is large and plentiful! I plan on trying them all one day. Drinks are mixed and made to perfection. Come here once a week to catch up on my sports! Great place
Maricela H.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,18,,1.0,7/24/2014,"I am sadden by the lack of customer I continue to receive at this, and only this location. The food to always good, but the servers don't seem to know the menu. I ordered a mock tail, that clearly stated ""free refills"". Only to be told by the server I would be charged. This has he opened previously, so in my opinion I will go to Burbank on elsewhere."
O N.,"Glendale, CA",19,35,,5.0,7/9/2012,I was surprised to see that this restaurant has has a 3 star rating. Their food is soo delicious! Love their pizza. I like the interior. There is nothing what I don't like about this place :)
T Z.,"Glendale, CA",0,6,,2.0,7/18/2014,"I had gone to this place several times, but recently have noticed that the quality of the food is decreasing! So, kinda frustrating..."
Kim F.,"Pasadena, CA",87,85,7,1.0,4/5/2010,"Usually BJs is just good food. I have been to many others in the area. I am not picky at all when it comes to my food, if I am going to BJs, I expect chain restaurant qulity food (meaning adequate, but mass produced - basically edible). Unfortunately this restaurant has not been this quality for a while. I gave them three strikes before I crossed them off of my list of lunch/dinner spots to hit in the area.  The first strike was lunch one day: we were seated immediately (plus!) but then we were not visited by a wait staff for over 20 minutes. you might be thinking, hey, they were probably busy - well no, that's not the case. There were 6 tables full. We couldnt even get a wait staff to make eye contact. they have all mastered the look off into the distance without being available... Strike two: On another trip, that part of the visit went fine, we were seated and helped immediately, but our food took over 40 minutes to get to us. And by the time it finally made it to us, it was wrong. there were 6 of us and they got 2 orders mixed up, 2 orders were completely wrong and they forgot my boss' order completely - as in, they forgot to make it/place it for those 40 minutes. Strike three: Again, I am not a picky eater. However, the food I ordered was so bland and tasteless and wilted/sad looking that I barely picked at it. It was so unmemorable I cannot even remember what it was I ordered to report it here.  Like I said, other BJs are great - I love their beer and their ""buffalo style"" pizza is to die for! However, this one needs work on wait service and in food quality..."
Brito M.,"Los Angeles, CA",188,60,26,2.0,8/26/2011,"ehhh don't waste your time. I went to BJs for my first time with some coworkers, and I wouldn't really recommend this place for any event... really.   Firstly, I seriously dislike menu overload. With every cuisine option imaginable, BJ's has no focused speciality resulting in mediocre food. Too much quantity equals low quality. To help me select one of BJ's best items, I asked my waitress what is good, and she replied, ""I eat everything."" (Although it seems impossible with their 2000 items, she really did look like she ate everything).  She also appeared slightly disturbed that I wasn't completely ready to order, and that I was taking her time away from something else. I'm sorry maym, the reason you're employed over a computer is so you can adequately attend to patrons, so LIE TO ME and tell me any item on the menu! She might have had too many tables than she could handle. Throughout the dinner she rarely visited our table, and was very short when she was present.  Anyways, I decide to order the avocado roll for appetizer, caesar salad, bacon cheeseburger(highlighted on the menu) with shoe string fries, and the pizookie. Avocado Roll - surprisingly good, but not restaurant quality (I do believe I could have preheated that from a box, and it would have tasted the same) Casear Salad - Average Burger - Average Fries - Sad. Very Sad. They were just not vivacious or anything to enjoy. Plate fillers really.  Pizookie - REALLY delicious! We ordered a half peanut butter, half chocolate chip combination, and it was GONE in 3 seconds. This is remarkably similar to UNO's deep dish cookie.  The food was just too bland, and the food coming out of the kitchen was slow and sporadic! The appetizer took forever, and then our salads all arrived to the table individually. (This isn't that big of a deal, but why couldn't you just wait until the salads were prepared?) After finishing the food we had, we waited patiently for the main course. We were then told by the manager that one of the dishes was taken out and given to another table, so we were to wait longer for our entree. Fine. Things happen, but what REALLY turned me away was the 12 minute dessert! By this time, my stomach enzymes are telling me I'm full ! I strategically eat everything possible before I'll feel that I'm full so I can eat more! This was RUINED. Bottom Line: don't waste your time."
Mel D.,"Los Angeles, CA",71,167,559,1.0,9/17/2011,"POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE! TO EVERYONE PLANNING TO CELEBRATE THEIR SPECIAL OCCASION AT BJ'S PLEASE READ: We reserved seats for 30 people and ended up adding 5 more people in our group over the phone, they said they can do it. Some of my friends ended up standing next to the people already seated since they cannot give them a table. The Manager told us that we have to wait for the customers eating on the table next to us so they can seat our friends.  To top it off there's a server from another table who was VERY RUDE (she's black lady). She told us to not get a chair from another table with an attitude. After awhile she came back and brought another chair, didn't even say a word. If you are grumpy, you shouldnt be a waitress. Get another job! She even smirked when we asked for parking validation. Our actual servers were nice in the beginning. When more people came in our party, no one asked for their orders. I had to find a server just so they can order. My friend even complained that they got the pasta before they got the water that they asked for. When we received the bill the manager was very rude in asking did you settle the bill. Seriously??!! One more thing they didn't give us pizookie...it's our b-day remember? BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE IS JUST LIKE FINDING A HAIR IN YOUR FOOD! I WISHED I READ ALL THE REVIEWS FROM YELPERS BEFORE WE BOOKED OUR EVENT HERE! LET THIS NOT HAPPEN TO YOU! Lesson Learned: DO NOT CELEBRATE SPECIAL OCCASIONS AT BJ'S!!! CUSTOMER SERVICE SUCKS!!!"
Faith C.,"West Covina, CA",19,8,1,2.0,5/31/2014,"We took out of town friends to this place and first, the food took long to arrive. A salad came first for one person and the rest of the dishes came after this salad was half finished. Our main guest requested for well done steak and it was rare. He sent it back to cook it some more and it never came back. When we asked for the manager she was kind enough to give us deserts and a gift certificate for our guest but still, the place was half full so there was no excuse for the lousy service."
Carlos L.,"Los Angeles, CA",42,30,10,5.0,3/14/2012,It's BJ's... Don't expect too much. C'mon !!! Sandwich drinks and maybe dessert. I would never order a filet mignon here if they offered it.
Brad b.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,5,2.0,7/21/2011,"I've never written a yelp review before but the decline of service at my regular hang out has caused me to write one. Ive been coming to this location for 3 years now, eating and having drinks at the bar. I loved this place. The bartenders were all friendly, the servers would come by and say hi. But somewhere along the line the corporate world took over and laid down the hammer on how the employees should speak to customers. I don't mean with kindness and respect, but verbatim responses. I feel like I am dealing with robots. I no longer feel comfortable or able to feel at home. It is sad to have a favorite place that you visit daily and then feel like no one knows you because they are still required to tell you their name for the 40th time and follow with a ""have you made your selection?"" as you've heard it echo down the bar to each patron moments prior.  Bring back Sam, Reggie, Marissa, Nichole, Frankie, even Dave. Anyone.  They all were personable. You felt like you were welcome there. Or at least adjust the business model slightly to allow for a steady following to build at individual locations."
Jonathan P.,"Los Angeles, CA",455,184,91,4.0,12/27/2011,BJ's is pretty much BJ's anywhere you go. The food here isn't better or worse than any of the others. Good service too. The bartenders there are very friendly and attentive. Keep it up cause I love me some Happy Hour!
Ella B.,"Long Beach, CA",3,32,,2.0,2/17/2010,"Just tried this place for the first time last week. I wasn't very impressed. I guess I shouldn't have expected too much from a brewery in terms of great food.  I ordered the veggie burger on wheat bread and wedge cut fries. I was surprised to see that the bread was buttered and grilled which I wasn't expecting and the wedge cut fries were breaded and then fried. The flavors were ok but just not very healthy at all. The rest of my party seemed to enjoy their food.  The server was very friendly and nice but the actual quality of the service was lacking. We had to ask for ketchup and mustard 3 different times and they were very slow in clearing our plates from the appetizers. They brought my brother the thin cut fries even though he ordered wedge. The server brought out a new order of wedge fries and we got to keep the thin fries too which I suppose is a good deal unless you're watching your fat intake.  It was my brother's birthday so they brought out a free pizookie. Everyone seemed to enjoy having a little taste of this. I had two spoonfuls and that was more than enough, very sweet.  I might come back on a night that I'm craving deep dish pizza and don't care about the fat and calories, as those looked pretty good."
Jennifer C.,"Burbank, CA",152,110,4,1.0,4/19/2009,"I really really need to rant about the dinner I just came back from.  Tonight has produced a laundry list of irks that has gotten this BJ's blacklisted. At the end of our meal, our waitress asked if we wanted Pizzokie, and we decided to go for it.  While we waited, we paid for the bill, and she returned the change with a ""Thank you, have a great night.""  We thought that was a bit odd, and wondered about the state of our beloved Pizzokie.  We figured maybe someone else would bring it.  So, we waited.   Our waitress was really great at avoiding eye contact, and walking in the opposite direction, btw.  After 28 minutes, our patience dwindled.  We had to catch another waitress in passing, to ask for the pizzokie.  She sent the request to the kitchen, and said she informed our waitress and the manager. Again, waiting.  Ten minutes later, the waitress and the chef came to apologize for the kitchen's mistake (...no manager...hm, interesting.)  The waitress said the pizzokie is on its way, and it'd be refunded in cash.   Ok.   Waiting, and in another five minutes, PIZZOKIE!  Yay!  We ate it in under five minutes, but had yet to receive the refund we were promised.  All the while wondered where the hell the manager was.  Another 25 minutes passed.  And so did our patience. We had to call yet another waitress in passing to specifically request to speak with the manager.  He finally showed his face, and when he got to our table, all he did was cut us off and speak over us.  He wouldn't fully hear us out, and assumed he knew all our grievances, so he went through the same old crap we already heard, cash refund, yada-yada... and after all that he had the nerve to ask me to smile. Mr. Manager you're a jerk. To top it all off, the whole mishap caused us to go over the 2-hour limit for parking, so we were charged to exit the structure.  I'm still fuming.   Fumes!"
Stephanie S.,"San Fernando, CA",17,37,,5.0,4/15/2010,"Even if you don't read the rest of my review, at least read this: GET THE HEFEWEIZEN / BERRY CIDER MIX.  My boyfriend & I ordered a pitcher and it was absolutely phenomenol.  Even if the food & service sucked, I still would've given 5 stars simply based on that.  I wish I could've brought a keg of it home. Fortunately, the food & service was excellent as well.  He ordered a burger; I got a turkey burger.  Quite possibly the best one I've ever had.  It came with avocado, and you can't go wrong with avocado. Our server was friendly and attentive.  He admitted halfway through the meal that it was his first night working there, but I wouldn't have known.  He was great! To be honest, this review is only based on one experience -- but because it was so wonderful, I'll be back again & again.  I hope you enjoy BJ's as much as I did!"
Ed C.,"Los Angeles, CA",176,256,36,3.0,1/30/2009,"So Edgar was walking down the street thinking of mischief and mayhem when this person walks up to Edgar and says ""Hey want free bjs?"" and Edgar was all ""Sure who doesn't like free bjs?""  But the kind of pie Edgar thought Edgar was about to receive wasn't the kind of pie this person was giving out. It was a slice of pizza that BJs was handing out as a form of street marketing around the neighborhood. At first Edgar was crestfallen but then Edgar ate some of the 'za and it was good. The dough was soft like the nape of a nubile young woman. The sauce and toppings were the perfect combination of salty and savory like the perspiration off her brow. The... um... anyway. Edgar likes BJs.  They also have really good beer and for the record Edgar likes his beers like he likes his women (insert your own jokes here) and it's a pretty good place to watch sports after work. That is all."
Kyle S.,"Burbank, CA",369,350,99,3.0,1/8/2012,"I like this place way better than the Burbank location. Its nicer and the staff is friendlier. However, the staff could be more attentive. I had to ask our server like 4 times to put on the Clipper game until i gave up waiting and  had to ask another server walking by. When she came to refill our drinks, she kept reaching over me to refill my boyfriends glass while i was eating. She almost smacked me in the face with her arm a few times. The bathrooms are usually neglected. Last night i noticed the trash cans were overflowing with used paper towels and the sink counters were soaked. kinda gross. Make sure you get your parking validated!"
Chris D.,"Irvine, CA",2115,313,52,3.0,8/26/2009,"Glendale Bjs I really enjoy going with a party of 3 or 4 max.Anything more then that sucks, its tight spaces! The service is a hit or miss. No homo but the guys work much better. Food was good, its BJ'S cmon, BBQ chicken pizza is awesome and just to save money get one giant pizookie(not on the menu)  and a couple of spoons don't let the waiter run your bill up! be smart, thank me later! TFR!"
ja f.,"Los Angeles, CA",16,16,,1.0,5/30/2013,"The only reason i am giving this place a star is cause I have to. I  only go here when friends want to meet her or come. The food is always gross, at room temp. or cold. My waitress only checked on us maybe twice? and they took forever bringing us our food, by the time they brought it I was not even hungry anymore :o ! point is dont come here, maybe you'll have better luck with the Burbank location ( which in my opinion has gone down the drain)."
