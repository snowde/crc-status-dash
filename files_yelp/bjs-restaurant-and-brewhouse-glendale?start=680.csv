Johnny T.,"Los Angeles, CA",102,43,9,3.0,12/29/2011,Wow.  This place was very busy when I first visited this place.  It took a very long time for them to bring out my food order...30 minutes or so.  The pizza I have to admit was very good.  The sauce was light and the crust was bubbly and delicious.  I recommend that if you are ordering for two people that you consider the small size pizza as the portions are huge.  The pizza is very filling in my opinion.
Gino P.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,,4.0,5/6/2012,Pretty good food. Not the best but it was a good experience. Our server was on top of things. Great service by Kayce H. Will return if she's our server
Melanie R.,"San Luis Obispo, CA",1,12,,4.0,6/25/2012,We have gone to BJ's before at different locations  Went here on a sunday night after driving in from AZ we wanted someplace casual where we could relax have good food and not be rushed out. . We were sat right away although we asked for a booth and was taken to what the hostess called a half booth but no it's a table so we opted for a booth in the bar area. Our waiter Joe was very attentive to us. He recommended a margarita I can't remember the name of it but it was real good!  Our food came very timely we have no complaints on the food. Joe also recommended a good beer that we really enjoyed also. The ONLY time our service wasn't 100% was when Joe went on a break and another covered his area we never saw her. But as soon as Joe was off his break again our service was great. Thanks Joe!
A. R.,"Los Angeles, CA",323,230,,1.0,4/22/2012,"Food is good. Service is not. My mother and I were seated outside and we got the worst waiter we've ever had. His name is Jeremy (Jerome maybe? His name isn't worth remembering anyways....). He never brought our drinks....our meals came really late....when we asked for the dessert menu he also never brought us that either. He came up with a bullsh**** excuse saying he got caught up in the back....We didn't even tip him. Anyways, if anybody gets this water --- RUN!"
Darlene P.,"Glendale, CA",56,69,1,4.0,3/26/2009,"Before they had opened this BJ's here in Glendale, I used to go to the one in Burbank.  I think I prefer the Glendale one more just because of convenience and I feel that the decor and ambiance of this one is more cozy than the other. I absolutely love their pizzas.  They're just great!  I also love the fact that they will tweak orders.  I was craving steak nachos one night (and It wasn't listed on their menu), and the waiter made it happen for me. Their beers are great.  I love the fact that they have seasonal beers that are fitting to the times.  Because I've tried all the beers that BJ's particularly brews, I've started getting the beers that they have in season, which I might add are just as good. Desserts - the pizookie is my friend!  I know, I know - it's just a bigger cookie with ice cream, but it's sooo good and you can share it.  I think it's just a great dessert. I do enjoy coming here once in awhile, and it is one of my go-to spots."
Janan B.,"Lancaster, CA",0,2,,1.0,8/10/2013,"Today i went to this restaurant and was very displeased. Our waiter did not serve us and was not friendly. The food was horrible. I have stomach pain from it and the bill was large for food that was not great. Also, my soda was very watered down and when we asked to get new drinks the guy came back with even more watered down drinks. I would not recommend this place to anyone unless you enjoy stomach pain and diarrhea."
Shawn R.,"Glendale, CA",82,12,10,4.0,4/9/2012,"Love the pizza here!  The thick crust/pan style comes with ample toppings.  If you like a saucy pizza, be sure to ask for extra sauce!  A bit more expensive than the pizza chains, but definitely worth it.  They have online ordering and a take out counter that makes it easy to pick up and go."
Keita M.,"Los Angeles, CA",27,8,,4.0,2/11/2012,"I was looking for a place to a watch the Laker game have drinks and boy was BJ' s in Glendale just the place. They had the game on many t.v.'s throughout the restaurant. The menu was great they had food recommendations with the beer, which they brew right there. Being that it was my friend's birthday the waitress was nice enough to bring us a chocolate chip cookie with ice cream and one candle. Then as a side bonus the waitress gave us two free drinks which were ordered and perhaps they screwed up the order so we benefit much, and the best part was I didn't have to break the bank the check was reasonable and so the  tip just flowed off the pen like sweet words spoken from a poet's tongue."
Jeannie Y.,"Glendale, CA",14,74,4,3.0,1/21/2010,"When youre craving some deep dish pizza, this does the job. Fun ambiance, filling food. Theyve mixed up my order once, but overall service good. You can never go wrong with the combo ((BJs Favorite)) ((Great White)) pretty good too. Pizza with tapatio to seal the deal. Pro: validates parking, sports bar."
Paul M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,7,3,1.0,10/5/2012,Service is unacceptable!!!we ordered sodas and a appetizer.15-20 Minutes later we got our appetizer and still no drinks In sight.we were eating our tizer and eventually got drinks.food got there which was decent but never got refills till i had to flag the server down(not cool) and they werent even busy..will not be eating here again.
thi t.,"North Hollywood, CA",6,64,,2.0,12/5/2009,"The food was fine, the problem was the service.  Takes way too long. I haven't been here for like a few years cause that was the problem I had before everything just takes forever.  After a few years pass, I have it another chance and the same things happen.  Service was bad and it took over an hour to get our pizza. That's all I order was Pizza. True, we had a big table, but our friend at the same table had their pizza way before us and we only ordered a SMALL size pizza which is only 4 slices.  Drinks took forever too. Overall, experience not so good. It's not just the food that will bring people back, you have to have at least an okay service too."
jose H.,"Long Beach, CA",184,126,20,3.0,12/5/2008,"So I went to the see the Raider game last night at BJ's.....yes the RAIDERS.  Well we decided there cause I like the beers that they have their and love going up and down the list of beers.  Food was ok.  But I have a big pet peeve and that waiter not only did it once, but twice. I hate it when Waiters bring your bill before you even ask for it. I was still drinking my beer and so was my friend and they bring us our bill.  Then I ordered a dessert and once again they bring you a bill.  I ordered another round of beer for myself and once again another bill.  Then I ordered one last round and once again they bring me another bill.. Are we all trying to go GREEN here.  Stupid business killing trees by trying to get my money and bring me bill after bill after bill.  I will go back again cause I like the pizza and beer, but next time I will say bring me my food and bring me six rounds of beer with a dessert now so you don't kill tress ASSHOLES!!!!!!"
Ani B.,"Griffith Park/Los Feliz, Los Angeles, CA",39,187,159,3.0,8/5/2011,Its all right. I mean the service is good. The food is decent. Its a boring atmosphere at the Brand location. The Burbank location is a much funner environment.
Michelle R.,"Bell, CA",230,11,,1.0,4/22/2012,Bad service. My Parmesan chicken was HORRIBLE. Mediterranean Pizza was sooooo SALTY. Bad experience altogether. Will not be back ever! A whole 60$ I will never get back!
Elias A.,"Fresno, CA",27,43,17,1.0,11/8/2011,Really deserves a 0 star rating.  Terrible service.
Duana M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",151,158,37,1.0,1/8/2011,"Thursday night and I am STARVING! I walked into this place....my mistake. When you walk in its kind of like a Cheesecake Factory (as far as the dim lighting) mixed with a Chilis/TGI Fridays/Applebees. Big screens everywhere. This place should just die and become a regular sports bar and just serve ""bar food""  :-). The wait staff is okay. No personalities here. I ate the Jambalaya. Now, I am not going to be the person that says ""I am from New Orleans and I KNOW Jambalaya and THIS is NOT it!"" BUT!! I will say I know this isn't what it is supposed to be. At all. Its an insult on a plate. My plate was rushed----clearly. The peppers tasted as if they were throw into the pot after being sauteed for about 2 minutes. It was just spicy and NOT at all flavorful. Lets not forget the salt content. It was spicy and salty. I will give credit to the Andouille sausage. Its flavor was unfortunately the compensator for the crap dish.  Yes I meant crap and NOT crab. My boyfriend was unfortunate. He had a nice white salad with stale croutons. I tried a crouton..every eaten a dried baked potato? That was the crouton. His main dish was a steak which was sub-par at best and then it came with a giant baked potato. No one can fcuk up a baked potato which is why this place gets one star. Lets not mention you don't get an extra side with your steak. No veggies? Lame.  *****DO NOT COME HERE IF YOU WANT QUALITY FOOD !*****"
Thenameisfood T.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",408,27,36,4.0,5/7/2013,"Came here w/ my girlfriend at about 9ish on a Tues night, place was half full seemed slow, just came to catch end of OKC vs Memphis game we started w/ chicken pot stickers were good, sauce was salty i am sure for most people but for myslef i loved it, she got the mini veggie pizza and a house salad i got the scampi pasta, all of it was really good. i enjoyed the time i was there. our Server Joesph was very helpful with suggestions and food came out quick and we had a pazzokie to end our meal. my girlfriend and i our both servers and i thought we were taken care of quite well for the amount of tables and people our serve was responsible for. there must have been maybe 6-8 other tables in his section and i felt he was very attentive.  on another note it really gets under my skin when people complain about food taking to long or server might take a while to get back, food taking a long time isnt the servers fault remember they arent the cooks  look around the resturant that server most likely has 6-9 other table beside yourself that 24-36 people that have to look out as well i hate people who try to a make a big deal about that, it wouldnt kill you to wait 4 minutes. and people also think that servers purposely ignore a table or they wont check on you for whatever reason, of course they care about you, in a servers eyes your tips, its not peronsal why would they do it on purpose if they live on your money. being a server i can understand, if a place is busy ill tell my server that you can come back in 5 minutes or finish whatever you have to do i dont mind waiting. i just hate people who feel like they deserve the world and should be served then and there, took 6 days to make world and 7th day he rested so why is such a big deal you need a glass of water ASAP."
Maxwell C.,"Glendale, CA",0,14,,2.0,5/24/2011,"It's great getting drunk in GlenDALE, but there's usually a lot of douchebags here when the Laker games are on, and the girls aren't very hot."
Roxanne C.,"Los Angeles, CA",30,57,18,4.0,9/2/2009,"Since I go to BJ's every other week, it's only right that I do a review...  I usually go during their late-night happy hour. Appetizers aren't their strong suit, but if your hungry for finger foods, stick with wedge cut fries and ranch dressing.  Beer is served cold... and for the recession-hit majority, you can also order by the pitcher ($15?).   My husband loves their meatloaf sandwiches and stuffed potatoes, and I usually eat their flat-bread pizzas. All in all, it's a descent spot to grab late-night brew and grub."
Jeff L.,"Woodland Hills, CA",40,235,,2.0,8/17/2011,"Had to see a client in Glendale so went with the kids here. Food was not bad, kids meal for the spaghetti was worth it, the Barbeque Chicken Salad was awesome from my son's perspective and I had the spiciest Chicken Parmesan which because of the sauce was too hot to enjoy. The reason for the rating? Horrible service, waited 10 minutes at our table before somebody stopped by and took the order. Next time waitress came by, it was to give us the check. It wasn't even crowded. I'll give the BJ's a try in Woodland Hills but won't be stopping at this one again."
