Kirsten A.,"Buena Park, CA",176,21,,2.0,4/12/2009,"This was my first time visiting the Glendale BJ's. Maybe it was an off night or something, but the service was ridiculous. Usually when I go to any BJ's, I get decent or good service, but today was no good.  It started off okay, but then it was downhill after the drink orders. She brought the drinks, but never really came back to check on us again for a long time. We got our food at an okay time. The waitress always took a super long time to come back and check on us. When she came back, my friend ordered a Hef and she didn't bring it out for like 15 minutes or something. She was really forgetful.  I give it  2.5 stars, because the food is never SPECTACULAR or anything, but you gotta love the pizookie."
Lydia C.,"Burbank, CA",191,74,194,3.0,8/15/2008,"Five words: ROOT BEER ON TAP, BRO. All crisp and chilly and bitey in a frosty mug. The best thing there.  Everything else is misted down with butter and grease. Even looking at the salad makes me gain a chin."
Austin S.,"Kansas City, MO",503,732,94,4.0,8/17/2008,"BJ's in my opinion is one of the consistent places in terms of their food, service, and overall dining experience. But at least at this one, there is a cute blonde waitress that my friend and I saw last time we were here a few months ago.  We asked our server what her story was and he said she has a big ""brotha"" for a boyfriend.  I backed down once he said that, hahaha She was there last night, so eye candy is eye candy.... I got a pizza with sauasage and mushroom.  We all shared a pazookie.... apparently they can split the cookie.  We got half oreo and half white chocolate macadamia nut"
B. Y.,"San Gabriel, CA",23,236,14,3.0,6/18/2011,"If you want a quick lunch, DO NOT come here.  Oh my goodness, every time I come for lunch on a weekday, it takes FOREVER. Long wait notwithstanding, the food is pretty good.  I like to get their lunch specials of a half sandwich, fries, and soup/chili for about $7?  Not sure if they still have it, but I'd definitely recommend that.  Their chili is good--it has beer in it and you can definitely taste it.  In addition to brewing their own beers, they also brew their own root beer!  The root beer float is yummy. Ooh, for appetizers, I love their avocado egg rolls.  Can't remember where I had them first--BJ's or Cheesecake Factory?  I like both versions.  Well, I love anything with avocado.  Their flatbread pizza appetizers are also good, and the gluten-free one is surprisingly tasty."
Amy C.,"Rosemead, CA",268,242,75,3.0,5/12/2011,"The Clam Chowder to my surprise is pleasantly tasty! The waiter messed  up on my order and brought me 2! :) 1 on the house.. :D Thank you! Pazookies are yummy! Happy Hour is Awesome. Parking is validated. Come 1, come all! :D"
Scott B.,"Sunnyvale, CA",8,64,,3.0,6/3/2009,"The prices off the lunch menu are very reasonable. The food itself is pretty good. The tomato bisque in particular was very tasty. As it was lunch time, I didn't have a beer, but I tried their custom root beer, and found it to be below average quality.  The food was quite good for what the place is, and if you want to watch lots of different sports at once, this is a great place to do so. The downside for us was that service was pretty slow, which is a big no-no for lunch service."
Maria R.,"Glendale, CA",27,24,6,2.0,7/28/2012,"So I'm just going to go out and say it.... I HATE BJ's. Go ahead, bring on the dirty jokes. I can take them. I really don't get this place. Sure it's a fun place to go drink and watch the Dodgers game, but places like that are plentiful in Glendale and LA. This place really has no redeeming qualities. Ok, I lied. Those diabetes inducing pizookies are delicious. They're something from the gods. However the food is mediocre at best. It gets a ""Meh"". No entree that I've tried has left me so particularly impressed  that I try it again the next time I come here. Which is why I have tried quite  a few dishes here at BJs. Now you might be asking, ""Maria, if you hate BJ's so much why do you keep coming back?"" Let me tell you fellow Yelpers, it is simply because my friends love it for some ungodly reason( subliminal advertising that I'm immune to?). It seems to be a popular birthday venue for them and I can't exactly say much. So BJ's as long as my friends have birthdays, I guess I will continue to have to swallow your creations like a champ. That's what she said."
Tai T.,"Lincoln Heights, Los Angeles, CA",17,214,33,2.0,8/11/2009,"I didn't like the BJ's in this particular location. I'd much prefer the West Covina location. This place seemed understaffed especially at the bar. There were only two bartenders behind the counter there when I went with a couple of friends. It was one tall black dude and one shortish, white gal. All the seats at the counter were filled up with people so ordering over people was a bit annoying especially when you're trying to speak over that corporate jerk talking about his ""company goals.""  When the black dude finally came around to us, he asked for our ID's. We gave it to him and then turned around and ignored us for a good 5 minutes while he was filling up beers and cocktails for other patrons that were on the counter. When he finally came back, he gave our ID's back and then asked us what we wanted. I asked for a Stella and my friends asked for Hefens. He turns around and ignores us for another 5 minutes. At that point, I was like ""wtf??"" He and his partner was apparently making a large order for a group on the other side of the restaurant/bar. When they finished making that big order and placed it on the server board to have it whisked away by a waiter, he finally came back around and got our beers. He whisked away my credit card and didn't return it until another 5 minutes later. Notice a pattern?  I don't blame the bartenders though. If anything, I feel sorry for the bartenders there. If only the managers there would lend them two more guys or gals to help them out, the bar would be an excellent place to chill after work in Downtown Glendale. It's conveniently located at the heart of Downtown Glendale where the Galleria is right across the street and plenty of restaurants, coffee shops, juice shops, and froyo's are within walking distance."
Kathleen B.,"San Diego, CA",128,463,83,3.0,4/14/2009,I love chicago deep dish pizza...  this review is for our mmkay service and the parking :(  If you go to this structure and stay past 12 be prepared to pay the full $6 even if you are 'validated' No wonder the place was near empty at 11:45 (BJ's typically closes around 1)
Mike S.,"North Hollywood, CA",10,8,,4.0,1/19/2010,"3 words. Try. The. Pizzookie. Good food. Good service. Lively (albeit a little sterile) atmosphere. Decent prices. Again, the excellent beer selection jumps this place above some others. I've never gone during a mad rush so a night like that may change my opinion, but not yet. If you're near the Americana or Galleria (and don't feel like In-n-Out) check this place out for the beer alone. I'm a sports buff, so I love that the plethora of screens are devoted to that most of the time. So remember, get a beer you've never had while eating something you most likely have had and don't forget the Pizzookie."
Marie r.,"Los Angeles, CA",19,369,26,3.0,5/17/2011,"came here for a friends bday  had the salsa and chips - pretty good i had the tilapia with rice pilaf and my husband had the fresh basil and italian sausage flatbread, and it really lacked the italian sausage, maybe because it was in the diet portion of the menu  service was okay also, they forgot my fish so i got my food last overall it's decent here for american food"
Bruce K.,"Studio City, CA",49,188,,4.0,12/21/2010,"I've now been back a few more times - I've had the pulled pork sandwich twice and I can recommend that without reservation.  Really good.  And their wedge is still yummilicious.  I've read others talk about slow service, but that has never been the case with me - great service all around.  So there."
mike M.,"Bakersfield, CA",10,23,1,4.0,2/23/2011,Went here for dinner and the food was not amazing like it was the first time i ate BJ's 10 years ago but was the best i have had in a year.  The dining room was lively and almost full the waiter was attentive but a little cocky.
Robert W.,"Burbank, CA",33,22,1,1.0,11/5/2011,"Usually BJ's have excellent food and service, but this particular location is a waste of time. On Nov 4, 2011 I and a coworker dropped in for a lunch special - it took us nearly 40 mins to get a bowl of soup, we never got the drinks we ordered (beer for the love of God!), and when we asked for an additional bowl of soup (we got the unlimited soup and salad combo) we were told the kitchen was swamped it may be an hour or more for soup or salad.  The manager on duty told us, this is just how it is on a Friday at lunch. Oddly enough there many open tables, the bar was empty, and there was no wait to get a seat. Hopefully this was an unusual occurrence for this location, but what a waste of my time."
Suzanne L.,"Covina, CA",65,162,78,3.0,7/23/2008,"BJ's is BJ's. The food is the same at all of them. If you've never been, you're probably from another planet, but I suggest you get a Great White pizza and a Pizookie. The Pizookie is free if you tell them it's your birthday.  The set up here is slightly different than the one I usually go to in West Covina. I think it's smaller, but has a large outdoor patio which I've never seen at a BJ's before. It also appears to be a bit dimmer, which is good. I like dark places.  I drove here for a co-workers birthday, and what should have been a 30 minute drive ended up being closer to an hour because my stupid azz got lost. I hate you google maps."
Jordan T.,"Glendale, CA",109,7,6,3.0,3/20/2012,"Out of the options for food in Glendale, BJ's is a safe option for good food.  However, the service is a craps shoot--I've had helpful and friendly service, indifferent service, and the occasional waiter/waitress that doesn't seem to know up from down, who runs around like a chicken with their head cut off.  Luckily a manager is always there to take care of any misplaced orders..."
Trisha A.,"Glendale, CA",100,22,13,2.0,6/2/2011,"i like the sandwiches and pastas that they deserve..  but seriously, the ONLY reason why i like coming to this place is because of their PIZOOOOKIE . YUMMY. FRESH BAKED COOKIE !! SERVE WITH VANILLA ICE CREAM ON TOP :)"
Justin G.,"La Canada Flintridge, CA",60,13,,2.0,5/29/2008,"Bjs is pretty much a disappointment.   I used to love BJs back in high school.  It seems like at least once per week I'd be driving my girlfriend and some of our mutual friends out to Burbank to get pizza and pizzookie, and it was fun, if a bit expensive (f-*k you Carl for always ripping the toppings off the pizza so you could ""eat the saucy bread"" and never picking up the tab. . .)  Anyway, those days are gone, and are replaced by the days of BJs Glendale. Days of infamy. When BJs first came to Glendale, I was stoked. Not stroked. Stoked. Why? Because Glendale sucks. Glendale has very little in the way of variety when it comes to lunch fare. Glendale perpetually smells like garlic and onions, and not in the good way. Glendale's trash trucks drive around with signs saying ""Don't trash Glendale. Don't litter"" and you wonder ""What does it matter? This city kinda sucks anyway"". But BJs offered that brief ray of hope. Sure, it's a really similar concept to CPK which is just up the escalator from it, and there's an Olive Garden in the same building. Sure, I can't take advantage of the beer selection at lunch. But there was hope nonetheless, in the form of their salads, and their deep dish pizza, and their lunch specials. Hope that was in vain, it turns out. Why? Because the food just doesn't do it for me anymore. It's over priced for one, which was excusable when I liked it. But lately it just feels like eating anything from there is akin to trying to use Crisco as an exfoliant. It's greasy, it's over priced, it just doesn't cut it. It's hard to really attack the food of a chain restaurant. It's all the same, and BJs seems to be pretty consistent. Not bad, but not thrilling anymore. It is what it is. But I will say a few words about the staff: they're nice, but incompetent.  Of the 6 or so times I've been there since it opened, I would say that 4 times involved a complete screwup on the order. Once it actually worked out to my benefit, because they ""had forgotten to make enough small pizzas"" that morning, so we got a medium instead.  But the rest of the time it's been kind of annoying. Worse, I can't use this restaurant as a lunch spot. IT'S TOO DAMN SLOW.  Every time. Without fail.  I don't know if it is because the restaurant is short staffed (though I doubt it, since people have stopped eating there during lunch as they realized it is slow and it's remained slow even with the decreased customer load), or because of some inefficiency in the kitchen, or what. But it's a problem and it hasn't been addressed properly by the restaurant's management.  If I order a salad, it will take 20 minutes minimum to get it. Usually it's more. Nobody comes around to refill drinks. God help you if you need to get the bill quickly. It's not even like I'm ordering pizza or chicago style deep dish pizza. Everything takes at least 1.5 times as long as it should.  As a consequence of all this, they don't get much of my business. I do like their beers though."
Bonnie L.,"San Diego, CA",303,240,12,4.0,2/17/2009,"I actually came here for Valentine's day, because you know what there is nothing more romantic than sitting at a tall bar table, watching a humongous projection of the All-Star 3-point contest and downing a couple of 10% alcohol Grand Cru beers!!  It wasn't exactly planned, but our options sort of ran out an hour and a half before a show we were planning to see.  And it actually turned out to be super fun and very efficient, as our waitress was SPEED-TALKING through the entire menu and their specials.  AND she brought out an entire beer sampler because, as she said, ""why not?""  AND she brought out a little soup sampler, that I have no explanation for.  But I didn't want to argue with her.   So after the beer sampler and the Grand Cru, I was feeling VERY happy (read: drunk) and didn't eat very much of my food.  But what I did eat of my Cajun pasta was pretty good!  It had shrimp, wasn't very spicy, but had a good kick.  Big portions.  I will say that, however, I am the type of person who loves these kind of restaurants because you get decent food at a good price.  Oh, and their clam chowder was GREAT.  It came as one of three little baby soup samplers.  I don't know if that is a normal thing that BJ's does, but maybe if you sit in the bar and ham it up with the hyper waitress, she'll give you all this free stuff.   So the bill came out to $38 for the 2 beers, which is their specialty brew I think, and 2 entrees.  Not bad!!  I have never in my life been to Glendale (I don't know, it's far from the Westside OK!) and it's pretty cool.  This area reminds me a little of downtown Pasadena, just a bunch of restaurants and shops all within walking distance. We parked at the mall, which was probably the most inefficient part of our night, because we couldn't for the life of us figure out that parking structure!  We could NOT, even if it was a do or die situation, figure out how to go up a level.  Are we retarded or have others had similar experiences?"
Tatiana D.,"Palmdale, CA",24,85,4,4.0,1/29/2009,"I would liek to start by saying that Glendale, CA does not suck. I love Glendale, I miss Glendale. I would still be living in Glendale if I didn't think I could give my kids a better upbringing where I am.  Second, I would like to state that BJ's is a great. I miss going to a place to get tasty food, an awesome beer and watch my game of choice(basketball, btw, Let's go, Lakers, Let's go ::clap, clap clap::).  This being said, has anyone notice the gigantic screens everywhere? You have? How about that the screens show nothing but sports? You have? Why do you think then that people go to this establishment at night on which there are sports  going on? Oh, it's a sports bar? Duh. If there is a big game on and you want to dine here, check the game time and come before or after that particular game because it will be packed.  The ambiance is different that CCF because whereas the point of the ambiance there is a crowded chich dining experience, the ambience point of BJ's is sports.  I liked the ""Chicago style"" pizza, the sandwhiches... just about all of it."
