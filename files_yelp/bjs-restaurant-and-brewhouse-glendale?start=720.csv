Deborah Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,1.0,1/2/2012,"Sitting here waiting for some service.... I had to get up and order a beer at the bar because nobody has passed to ask us if we.are doing ok....well they pass.. I'll get up again and order from the bar because I'm watching a hokey game with my man.... But seriously??? Maybe I should apply.. Without any experience I'll be far better than anyone here next to the bar!!! Fyi talked to the manager... I've never done this before in my life.... All he said was..... ""SORRRRYYYY"" OK.... YA I'M SORRY TOO.."
Dony P.,"Los Angeles, CA",38,73,5,3.0,4/7/2009,"I've always enjoyed BJ's for what it is.  A good place to sit down and have some greasy foods, beers, or that piezookie thingamabob.  But I wanted to give props to this one in Glendale.  I thought the service was very friendly and attentive.  They had cooked our deep dish pizza wrong in the kitchen, so the manager came out and told us they had to start another one.  This was good, because he did not want us to sit and wonder what was taking so long.  I appreciated the honestly in telling us they needed to start over.  In the interest of getting our food to us as quickly as possible they brought it out, when it could have been cooked a little bit longer.  Normally I would send it back, but it was good enough to eat, and my girlfriend and I had a show that we were attending, so we didn't have time to wait.   So instead we contently ate it.  The manager came back out, to ask how it was, and I thought I would answer honestly and said the pizza could have been longer to fully melt the cheese.  I could have lied and said everything was perfect, but I figured he wanted to know, so I told him.  He apologized and we were surprised to later find out that they charged us nothing for the pizza.  Now normally this sounds like a less than ideal dining experience, but I really do appreciate everything they tried to do for us that evening.  They start our order over just to make sure we got what we wanted, and that it was good.  They tried to serve us in a timely manner, and made the effort to follow up on the food.  When they discovered it wasn't fully melted, they made it complimentary, because I'm sure they want us to come back.   Normally, I find that the food is good and consistently what you expect from a sit down chain restaurant, but I just wanted to highlight the particular care we received at BJ's in Glendale.  These people will treat you well.  I want to give 3 and a half stars, but maybe I can give it 4 after a few more visits."
Gaurav G.,"Union City, CA",7,12,,2.0,5/19/2011,I have been to several BJs and this one is my least favorite. They always manage to mess up my order some way or the other making my experience terrible. The only reason I go here is because the olive garden next door always seems to have a 1 hour waiting time. Avoid if possible
Rob C.,"Long Beach, CA",0,1,,1.0,12/4/2013,"Horrible service by ""Denise M"" (that's the name on the receipt).. She brought the check out and we weren't even done with our food!!! Really?? Bad! All bad!"
John P.,"Northridge, CA",75,95,190,4.0,3/31/2011,I love going here for happy hour. I love their sliders and their micro brews. I love their deep dish style pizzas and their appetizer sampler is outstanding. I love a place that has happy hour from 3pm-7pm and 10pm- closing.
Missi S.,"San Francisco, CA",67,110,,4.0,6/13/2008,"I ordered take out for my office. I faxed my order around 10am and informed Jessica that I will pick it up at 11:30am. I arrived at around 11:25am to find that my order was not ready yet. Jessica came out, immediately apologized, and decided to throw in a pizookie and ice cream at no charge. I was pleased with their customer service. She knew the order was late but took it upon herself to please the customer. Vanessa, who worked at the counter, even offered bread and butter while I waited. Jessica also offered a tall glass of water. Of course, I accepted graciously.  My order was ready before noon. They even provided full sandwiches, when we ordered half sandwiches, at no charge."
Gergana B.,"Redondo Beach, CA",101,84,2,3.0,1/7/2011,"I rarely write review for chain places (because really, what's the point?) but this BJ's was among the better of the locations I've visited.  I have to start by saying I am a fan of the type of food they serve--most of the time I will be happy choosing from a wide variety of plain, American-style food: salads, soups, big ole sandwiches with a pile of fries, pastas, and of course their deep dish pizza.  I usually order off the sandwich menu and have yet to find something I don't like. Their soups are hearty and the pizzas are rich, although I've had friends complain about the chunkiness of the sauce. Food always gets a solid 4 stars.  This particular location is actually quite a bit better than the others I frequent. It beats the Westwood location as far as wait times, layout (the Westwood one is impossible to navigate), more grown-up clientelle, and parking! The Burbank location seems a bit more family-oriented, and the fact that they have valet only sucks! Parking and crowdedness also knock off point for the Culver City and Belmont Shore/Long Beach locations. In relation, this BJ's has a lot more going for it than the other locations I frequent.  My only gripe with this chain is their beer--for ""hand-crafted, silver award winning"" brews, they are hit-or-miss and pretty mediocre. The pale ale is the only one I remember being special, and I even remember being so disappointed in their brown ale I shudder when I see it on their menu.  Oh well--I will keep visiting you for your tasty sandwiches and pizzas and just forget the beer, BJ's-- if you bring the bruschetta and ""Together at Last"" appetizer combo back, you might become a regular place again. For now I'll stick to the Yardhouse for stellar beer and above-average American bar food.  Wish I could give 3 1/2 stars--this BJs is better than most!"
Ashley G.,"Burbank, CA",16,35,2,4.0,7/1/2011,Their food is delicious but you should just save up the calories for a pizookie... this scrumptious dessert is the only reason to go!! mmmm
melissa m.,"Fremont, CA",11,70,11,5.0,9/27/2008,"LOVELOVELOVE this place. their sausage pizza is delicious. their pizzas in general are delicious. its the perfect crust and dough and everything. their potato wedges are really good too!! too much to eat both the potato wedges and pizza... trust me, i tried.  PIZOOKIES! yummmm! great way to end a dinner. But often I feel that after finishing my pizza I am too full to eat pizookie! Soooo... maybe limit yourself to a slice or two of pizza, instead of eating the WHOLE pizza.. so you can fit in that pizookie. melts in your mouth goodness!"
Chris W.,"Santa Rosa, CA",3,48,1,3.0,12/5/2010,"Food is fair it is nice to watch a game there on sunday morning.  The chili is weak, but the morning Italian Omelet was pretty good and a great price.  The staff seems boared but the manager did his most to get me the game I wanted to see.  Coffee is weak, better salads and beer.  The free appetizers were good though."
James S.,"Los Angeles, CA",561,1194,627,3.0,8/19/2008,i have drank plenty at this place pretty much a place where i would catch a game and drink a plenty the staff is quite friendly and not so old very professional the food is the same with all bj's there isnt any item that stands out from the rest white chocolate pizookie(cookie baked like a pizza with ice cream ontop)
Geneva Y.,"La Crescenta, CA",0,10,2,2.0,7/11/2013,"This is a nice looking restaurant in a good location not far from the Americana and Glendale Galleria. Service was OK. Parking garage is small and crowded. Food was really bad. The chicken I ordered was tough - almost like it came out of the microwave. We ordered pasta with tomato sauce for my daughter, and it was extremely bland. I won't be back. There are far better choices in the area."
Jason Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",170,213,8,4.0,10/16/2010,"BJ's is a bar that sells their own beer, and it's actually not half bad.  Try the Jeremiah Red.  It's a strong and tasty beer.  I actually like the food here a lot, especially the shrimp lettuce wraps.  If you're health conscious, they have nutritional info on everything on the menu.  It's a great place to go to watch the game, hang out with the guys on a weeknight, and to have a few drinks for happy hour.  Happy hour during the week starts at 10PM, and it's like $1 off beers and $2 off appetizers."
Toni M.,"Glendale, CA",0,5,,5.0,9/23/2013,"I love this place, food is excellent , beer is fresh and the staff and waiters are super friendly. Specially when you are at the bar the girls are friendly. Evelin is the manager and she is super friendly love her."
Walter W.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,25,1,1.0,6/29/2010,Awful service!!! Our party of 3 got seated and given ONE menu to SHARE!!!! Waitress took more than 15min to come to our table! Drinks took even longer to show up! Our appetizer order was mixed up and then fixed only to arrive with our main course! I ordered the BJs classic cheese burger.... They forgot the cheese! When I was finally able to find the waitress she brought me a plate of cold cheese to put on what was left of my burger! Service at this location is HORRIBLE!!!! AVOID AVOID AVOID!!!
J S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,7,,1.0,6/22/2012,"the service was slow and the waiters were generally unpleasant... the food was below average, which would be understandable at a bar chain like this... but the real kicker was the manager... what a completely self-entitled and unpleasant person - when he came to see how we were doing and we very kindly voiced our opinions, his attitude was nothing short of snarky or completely oblivious/uncaring. we've never been to a corporate eating establishment with such unbelievable lack of manners and knowledge of the word 'service.'  we are not picky people. DO NOT SUPPORT THIS BUSINESS - ESPECIALLY considering the MANAGEMENT is so poor!!! we will be going to their corporate offices to voice our complaints"
Craig T.,"Shadow Hills, CA",6,18,2,4.0,2/12/2011,"It's all about the BEER here. Excellent Imperial Stout (Tataonka), lovely Irish style Strong Ale (Jeremiah Red)...The food is OK, but the beer is outstanding. Some nice soups, salads, decent pizza. I love this place...."
Linda L.,"Glendale, CA",71,157,11,4.0,10/23/2007,"BJ's in Glendale is officially open, and judging by the bustling crowd there tonight, lots of people already know! The food was pretty standard American fare (pizza, burgers, pastas) and although it wasn't anything fancy - it was tasty and pretty inexpensive to boot! I was a little nervous about eating there a day after they opened,but although the servers were new, they did an awesome job - very attentive and super nice.   They did a great job remodling the place, there are no remnants of the old Chevy's.  It's very open, with a modern casual feel and plenty of flat screen TV's to watch sports. This place is bringing some life to downtown Glendale which is always good!"
David Y.,"Glendale, CA",7,18,,4.0,2/22/2012,"I go to this place at least 1 or 3 time a month on the weekends, The food has always been great and the service: decent. It gets busy on the weekends, so the wait time sucks."
Anastacia S.,"Glendale, CA",0,19,3,1.0,12/22/2012,"Terrible service each time I have been there, not going back.  Seated quickly but waited atleast 10 min. for someone to take my order.  Wait staff seems to disappear after they bring the food.  Wrong amount charged to my credit card, I signed and have a receipt for the correct amount but was charged more, called manager and he corrected it and all he said was ""sorry for the inconvenience"".  There are plenty of other choices for restaurants in the area, don't waste your time with this place."
