Marianna D.,"Glendale, CA",49,12,,4.0,2/3/2011,"Very fun restaurant! The food is pretty good. I usually get the Santa Fe salad which is amazing, and they have a thin crust pizza which is excellent.  If you save enough room for dessert, their pizookies are out of this world!! You must try their pizookie.   Service can be slow, but it's worth it."
CJ J.,"Irvine, CA",1367,1047,570,3.0,3/23/2008,"Big Patio. Bar area is kind of small. Main dining area is huge. BJ's is BJ's. Nothing really different from the rest of the locations, except that they were strict about not putting a chair at the end of our booth. Apparently it's ok if you're the first or last booth in the bar area, but the middle tables are NOT allowed to have a chair at the end of the booth. WHACKNESS! They need to put more high bar tables or something to compensate for not allowing a chair to be brought to the table. The tv's attract many people to the bar so it should be allowed! They let us sit a bit squished at the booth which was WHACKNESS DUDE! Bad customer service. Anywhoo... I had the Great White mini pizza which was $5 during happy hour and the raspberry frambois. Frambois is so good! The thin pesto pizza is yummy too along with the pazooki. Thanks DIane for letting me have a taste. It's too addicting for me to order my own whole one. No way! :) Good times."
Javier M.,"Los Angeles, CA",63,9,,1.0,11/25/2012,"Bad service. Waited 10 minutes for menus. Once our food came out, no silverware. Tried to get a refill and I had to walk to the bar to ask for a refill. Not coming back."
Ninkasi D.,"Pasadena, CA",32,121,4,4.0,11/7/2007,"Updated Again: 2/14/08 - The GM sat down with my friend and I, listened to ALL of our concerns, and was SUPER responsive, rather than being defensive about the things outlined here. There's been a major turnover in staff and things are improving. Updated 1/27/08 -It didn't take long for this BJs to loose two stars - and believe me, those are only for the beer, which is sometimes far from being spot-on. But the reason why I've reduced my rating from four stars to two is because, with the exception of my first visit there, there hasn't been ONE time that I have eaten here when there wasn't an issue with the quality of service received.  For example: during a recent visit on a Sunday afternoon. I wanted the fish sans chips - in other words, fish n chips w/o the chips.  Our waitress was polite and helpful, took our order quickly, repeated it back to us, and brought our drinks to us without much of a wait. However, things went from good to awful when a server came with our food, slammed it down on the table and walked away. Problem was, she brought fish and chips - exactly what I didn't want - and there was no sign of my salad.  After about five or so minutes, I managed to get her attention and explained to her that I'd ordered fish only, no chips and wanted a substitute salad instead.  Without a word, she stomped away, and came back a few minutes later and SHOVED - literally SHOVED - the salad across the table at me. I said - politely - ""Excuse me, but ...."" and before I could finish she said, ""You wanted a salad. Well there it is."" And she stomped away again. Rather than make a scene, I quietly asked another server for a manager. We explained the situation to her and she apologized profusely for the behavior of this person and gave us a complementary pizookie.  Other weird stuff has happened since then, including being brought our bill WITH our meal and being told that it was a company policy.  There were two occasions where our party had to wait 20 minutes for our drinks, and then had them served in plastic cups because they ran out of clean glasses. C'mon folks - it's a BREWERY with a full bar, for goodness sake! People WILL order drinks, and plenty of them! The food quality has gone down rapidly, as has the service, which is sad because when this place first opened, it wasn't unusual for me to come here two or three times a week. I work on the opposite end of Brand, and the place was a favorite among our sizable group. Sadly, we will have to find another place to frequent. +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ There's a new BJ's Brewhouse in town, and from what I've experienced so far, it's good - really good!  I've been a long time frequenter of the Arcadia location, and have been to Burbank several times as well. The food in Arcadia is sub-par compared to what it used to be about 5 years ago, and we always get spotty, if not weird service in Burbank. I love the decor at this location, which is less sports-bar-esque and more restaurant trendy for the office crowd on North Brand. There are still a number of televisions scattered about, but this place seems to be more about enjoying a good session beer or two (of which they have a few), or a night out with a special someone, or just to hang with friends. But I don't go to BJ's for the decor, I go for the brews. And considering that this place is brand new (just over two weeks old at the time of this writing) - and given that a lot of things can go wrong with house brews,  these guys mostly got it right the first time. My favorite BJ's brew, the Piranha Pale Ale, was a bit flat the first night I visited. Not quite enough CO2 in the mix for my taste, and not quite the level of signature hoppy bitterness I prefer. But the Nutty Brewnette (not me - the beer) was spot on, and was smooth like butta.  On subsequent visits - and there have been a few because I work just up the street - every beer I've had has been fresh and tasty, just like momma likes 'em. As for the food...I've found BJ's to be sorely lacking in the grub department as of late, but the folks in the Glendale kitchen have it goin' on. From pasta to fish and chips, the food I've sampled here has been well prepared, served hot, and is quite tasty. And last but not least - service. I know these folks are new, but on one occasion, we were seated at a table near the bar, and while nearly eight different servers passed us by, not one stopped to see if we'd been helped.  Finally, after having his back to us and serving the table immediately next to us, I caught the eye of one guy who rather reluctantly asked, ""Has anyone helped you?"" We said no, to which he replied, ""Well, I don't know where the guy is who is supposed to be here, but I guess I can help you. "" Gee, thanks? Other than that, I've been quite happy with my overall experience here, and I'll definitely be going back again."
Jeff K.,"La Crescenta, CA",92,485,27,4.0,2/25/2008,"Welcome to BJ's. yea stop laughing at the dumb acronym.  Full. Rack. Ribs. mmmm. now for the beer choice... if you're indecisive on which beer you want to kill your liver with, try out the sampler. it consists of 7 sample sized beers you can try out. I believe they're a quarter pint each or something like that. You could also mix and match the beers into a glass like my friend, aka Jack Brewer, lol. sorry i was watching ""24"" a lot at the time.  The parking can be tough to find despite the 2 story parking structure so you might wanna consider valet so you can get your beer on ASAP.  nice place to hit up before/after a movie since it's close from AMC."
M T.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,193,3,2.0,8/28/2010,"Decent food, horrible service.  I went here a couple months ago with friends and got there about 30 minutes before closing.  We rushed in, knowing we had to order quickly before the kitchen closed.  Here is what happened: - Got there and there wasn't a host/hostess.  Waited there.  A few waiters/waitresses saw us, but did nothing...fair enough, it isn't their job.   - After 15 minutes of just standing there, we flagged down a waiter and asked to be seated.  He told us to got to a specific table and he'd be there.  Never came. - After 5 minutes at that table, we had to wander around the dining area for 5 more minutes to flag down another person.   - The second waiter we flagged down seated us and said he'd be back.  He came back in about 5 minutes and said, ""You need to order quickly because the kitchen is about to close!""  No crap.  Too bad we wasted 25 minutes just trying to be seated. - The 2nd waiter was nice, but even he didn't give the best service.  Once he served us, he rarely came to check on us for refills, etc.  We always had to wait and flag him down. I know that we got there late, but that is no excuse.  If they don't want to serve people after a certain time, I have an idea....don't stay open late!!!  Instead, I guess they figure they'll just ingore anyone who comes in at a certain time.  Not cool! As for the food, it was decent.  On par with other establishments like this.  But, I will be hard-pressed to return after the horrid service at this place."
Azniv B.,"Los Angeles, CA",43,35,534,4.0,8/15/2012,"its hopping on weekends, chill place to go on a date or with family, lively atmosphere great drink options!"
Nez P.,"Eagle Rock, CA",99,107,,3.0,1/25/2010,"My friend and I wanted to have dinner + drinks last night, and decided on BJ's because it was close to our area. There was a 30-45 minute wait, but I couldn't blame them because there was a football game on and no one was leaving. When we were finally seated, we started off with the avocado egg rolls which I found to be surprisingly good. It had a sweet dip on the side that complemented the avocado really well. As for drinks, I had a Pomegranate Sunset, which I liked. It wasn't strong, I didn't get a buzz, but it was refreshing. My friend got the Raspberry Lemon Drop, and it was way too sweet. In fact it tasted like liquid candy. Between the two of us, we couldn't even finish it, but I could say that it was stronger than the one I had.  For the main course, I had the fish tacos. I did not enjoy them AT ALL. I don't even know what possessed me and made me think that a place like this would have good fish tacos. They were super dry, even with the dips and chips on the side. I finished one and had to force-feed myself the other one. That definitely killed my experience there. Then we both had Strawberry Splashes, which turned out to be an all-time favorite. It had the consistency of a smoothie and had a slight pineapple aftertaste. Again, it didn't give me a buzz, but oh well, we both enjoyed it. Service was a little slow. We started off with a female server who went MIA on us. Then about half an hour later, a male server approached us and said that our previous server had gotten cut and was sent home and that he would be our server for the rest of the night. I thought that because we had a new server that we would get better service, but it took forever to flag the dude down. Whatever. So its minus a star for the slow service, and minus a star for the waste of 9.75 fish tacos. Oh and for dessert, my friend and I shared a White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Pizookie. It was good, but I'm glad I split it with her because it was too big for just myself. Recommend - Avocado Egg Rolls, Pomegranate Sunset, Strawberry Splash, and White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Pizookie."
Pizza S.,"Burbank, CA",2,28,,1.0,3/29/2008,"It's bizarre reading the reviews for the Glendale location-- not because they had odd experiences, but because I had one with a lot of similarities to theirs as well. The scenario - Birthday party (not mine, but thanks for asking)  on a Friday night-- 15 of us. We booked in advance the day before to ensure a table. We get there-- sorry, no reservation. Strike one. Strike two came when we ordered appetizers, which, while tasty, apparently don't come with serving plates, silverware or napkins for the patrons that order unless you have to ask for them.  When our individual orders were placed, I and one other friend ordered individual pizzas.  45 minutes later (and most of our glasses nearly empty), the both of us were brought little stands for the pizzas to rest on... only to have the food brought another 20 minutes after that.  If they implied our food was ready with the stands, they ultimately decided it was probably best to have it all brought out at once and tease the both of us-- and the staff had no concept as to who's dish was who's.    Strike three. We (and by that I mean the whole lot of us) felt that the percentage included in bill for tip for large parties was too much for the poor service and inconvenience we experienced there, but rather than being poor sports, paid it anyway, happy to be getting out of there. I know now what BJ's stands for: Big Joke."
Samantha J.,"Simi Valley, CA",7,53,15,3.0,1/16/2011,"LOVE the beers...... would give it 4 stars because of that, but i do have to mention that the food is pretty mediocre.  lots of fattening selections, the salads/sandwiches don't really seem all that appetizing (or healthy for that matter)..... used to love the blackened chicken pizza but they took that off the menu, which was highly disappointing.  would recommend for happy hour maybe, but not for lunch or dinner."
Debbie W.,"Orange County, CA",512,490,35,5.0,9/17/2009,"Came here for happy hour with a friend, we found a great booth, very nice ambience and the menu was extensive!  We both got personal pizzas and some beer, also tried this spicy shrimp appetizer.  Everything was delicious and our server was really attentive which is sometimes rare for a bar environment.  We skipped on the dessert but right now they have a 2 person menu for $19.99 which includes the pizookie at the end, so can't wait to use that, it expires 9/30/09."
See L.,"San Gabriel, CA",196,193,177,3.0,4/3/2012,park downstairs for valet :) right around the corner and it's pretty big! similar to every single BJ out there.
Jordan K.,"Glendale, CA",460,5,1,3.0,6/3/2013,pretty great. came for the drinks. stayed for the pazookie. i could eat a truck full of those things.
Annie S.,"Glendale, CA",9,9,,4.0,5/11/2013,"I went there with my freind's last week. Nice staff. I liked they'r pizza but It took  30 min to serve it. If you are craving something sweet,you should try their pazooki !!"
Mike W.,"Washington, DC",12,127,194,1.0,4/15/2008,"HORRIBLE SERVICE! Waited waaayy to long for some salads.  Emailed to complain and  got a reply asking for a number to call, gave it to them - they never callled.  Followed up with another email.  Still have not heard from them and its been months. STAY AWAY!"
Heather N.,"Los Angeles, CA",19,63,2,2.0,11/12/2007,Glendale BJ's you suck!   I understand everyone's new and that there still working out the kinks but come on people 45 min for a roast beef dip sandwich WTH! They did comp us free desserts I'll give them that but that's it.  Food was mediocre and not as good as Burbank's. Oh not to mention the wait.  Very long... 40 min on a Sunday night.  I will not be returning anytime soon that's for sure!
Marine A.,"Glendale, CA",1,7,,1.0,2/15/2013,"Last. Couple of times service has been lacking.  Today, Friday night, was by far the worst restaurant experience we've had in years.  We go out regularly so its pretty telling that it's never been this bad.  Mgr said they've had other issues w/ this server 1st day.  Who starts new person on busy Friday?! We had to ask for utensils.  One of our 3meals arrived 20minutes after others.  We ordered a long island ice tea and she brought them in kid cups!  Server blamed kitchen, didn't apologize for mistakes.  After complaining mgr comp'd & said she'd send over couple of to-go boxes, never happened but that's nothing given everything else tonight.  We didn't eat our food & we will not be going back.  Horrible service!  Whatever is going on @ glendale BJ's it's not good."
Angel D.,"Long Beach, CA",578,683,82,3.0,3/11/2012,great place for big groups or grabbing a pizza and some appetizers while watching a big game on the tons of flat screen TVs... and a must dessert is always the pizzoki .. just watch out if your lactose intolerant .. haha
Joey M.,"Norwalk, CA",0,4,1,1.0,1/22/2011,One star only because I had to put something. Very rude service. Seemed like they just didn't care for our business. Will never be back!
Vonda H.,"Glendale, CA",0,10,,1.0,10/16/2012,"They shouldn't even get one star. They have the SLOWEST service and it can only be about 15 people in the whole place. I went twice back to back it was Sunday breakfast and 10 people in the whole place it took us almost an hour just to get sandwhiches. Then we spoke to the manager who acted like he was completely bewildered and didn't know why the service was slow. Ok so I returned Monday for their $5 martinis & Mojito's around 4:00 and there were like 20 peopl in the whole place again. The drinks were horrible I returned the Cosmo and the mojito and just had the beer. However, again the service was super slow.."
