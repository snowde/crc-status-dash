Paulette F.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,71,2,2.0,1/22/2008,"I've never been a fan of BJ's.  But my best friend loves it, and now that there's one in Glendale, she is in heaven.  Which is why I agreed to go there tonight. This is the LOUDEST restaurant in Glendale.  So loud you can't think.  Forget about talking to your friend across the table.  Especially if you're sitting next to one of the numerous groups of 12+ people OR the obnoxiously drunk girl who has nothing better to do on a Tuesday night than blow out everyone's eardrums because she mistakenly thinks it's cute for her to slam her drinks on the table every time she shrieks her high-pitched laugh. It's not.  Don't sit next to that girl.  Especially if she and her boyfriend keep getting up to go to the bathroom together... I don't give this place much credit.  First, BJ's is an awful name.  Not because I have the mentality of a 13 year old boy but...well, I have the mentality of a 13 year old boy.  Second, the family atmosphere doesn't really do much for the ""micro brewery"" image.  I can't reconcile families sharing a pint while the little ones scream in their high chairs.  I'm sure it happens, but I don't want it to while I'm trying to enjoy a beer.  Especially the screaming kids part.  So really, I just come away feeling like I spent the evening at TGIFridays or some other chain I've never set foot in.  At least Gordon Biersch has its machinery on display.  And doesn't cater to the family crowd! That said, I have to give our server credit.  Apparently they've been trying to work on their slow customer service, because she made a remark about how quickly the food made it to our table.  Even my friend said she'd never gotten her order so quickly.  And my sandwich was pretty good too (had the turkey cobb, without the bleu cheese dressing--ick!).  The drinks, on the other hand, took forever.  Like they had to go to the liquor store to buy more soda.  Soda!  It wasn't even a mixed drink that I could understand taking a while to get.  Oh, and another weird thing is the super slippery floors.  From the faux stone entrance to the hardwood with the tongue n' groove design...it's like asking to fall on your ass.  Be careful if you're in heels! Food was decent, service was fine, but on the whole, the place kinda sucks."
J C.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,12,3,2.0,9/13/2010,"Beer: Good, Service: Good, Food: *barf sound* except for the chowdah, oddly enough.  I ordered the ribs 'n' chicken plate and I had to pour half a bottle of A-1 sauce on my plate just to choke em down. The potato was effing TERRIBLE.  I will say that the only redeeming thing about BJ's is the beer and the clam chowdah.  Honestly, how do you get Clam Chowder completely right and fail  m i s e r a b l y  on the ribs, potato and chicken?? Anyway, service was good also."
Irene L.,"Los Angeles, CA",10,15,23,5.0,5/9/2010,This place is GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!The food is delish especially the HUGE potatoes.. The mojitos and sangria is verry good...
Joolie T.,"Brooklyn, NY",1067,1296,1004,2.0,2/10/2009,"eh. i want to give a BJ.... not go to BJ. j/k. sort of. the selection of beers is nice. i'm not a beer person, though. give me some cider and/or hard liquor, please! the location of BJ's is in the busy part of Glendale. the wait for a table isn't too horrible on a Saturday night. the layout of the place is quite reminiscent of Outback Steakhouse... very open and not private. the service here is spotty and on the slow side. our server never checked up on us, messed up our orders and forgot essential condiments or special requests we kept reminding her (and him... we had TWO people to our table) over and over. these reminders never worked. i was miffed.  the menu is basic Applebee's/Cheesecake Factory/Outback/TGIF standard. everything they offered made me snicker and scoff. i couldn't find a light entree to eat. i ended up ordering some basic salad. i was not dazzled. the large plasma tv's distracted me from the boring food, anyway. a little TOO MUCH distraction, though. there were too many different games playing on the screens... i was getting severely dizzy! we ordered a birthday cookie pizza for our friend- he seemed to love it. i didn't even touch the thing. again, something about BJ's food made me want to gag."
Jonathon S.,"Ridgecrest, CA",102,122,30,4.0,5/12/2009,"The pot roast I had was tasty, albeit real fatty.  The Nit Wit wheat beer our server recommended was excellent.  Our server was also very friendly, and she even participated in the geeky convo my film school friends and I were having about TV shows.  Over all, I had a fun time at BJ's."
John S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,12,,1.0,11/3/2012,"I went on a Saturday night with my family for dinner at BJ's about a week before Halloween.  The last time I was here was about several years ago so I could not recall if the food was good or not.   When we got there, the place was not overly full so we were seated promptly.  Our server was friendly and took our orders.  We started off with three appetizers which were shrimp in lettuce wrap, flat bread pizza, and fried calamari.  For drinks it was orange juice, pumpkin beer, and cola.  The cola was flat and had no fizz.  The pumpkin beer tasted awful.  Orange juice tasted watered down.  We complained about the cola and orange juice to our server..  The cola was replaced and it was better.  As for the orange juice, our server told us that other customers had complained about the same thing.  Our server told us that the orange juice they use is for mixing cocktails and not for drinking straight.  This made no sense to us.  If you know this, why would you keep serving people watered-down orange juice?  I was given a choice of a substitute or a refund so I chose cranberry juice.  I asked our server if the cranberry juice was going to be the real thing and she kind of rolled her eyes and told us yes.  She brought the cranberry juice.  I tasted it and it was the genuine thing. I would rate our appetizers as being poor to good.  The good was shrimp in lettuce wrap.  In fact, this was the best of all the food that night.  The fried calamari tasted like cardboard.  The flatbread pizza was only decent because it had too much oil.causing the bread to be soggy.   We also ordered two entrees which were shrimp and sausage jumbalaya and shrimp scampi.  The shrimp scampi was not that good.  There was too much breading or what seemed like it.  Maybe the breading was actually parmesan cheese.  Whatever the case, it did not taste good.  The jumbalaya was actually pretty OK except it was too salty and the sausage were too thin. The final price was $87 which did not include tip.  Final summation:  the place was not worth the price."
Ryan H.,"Milwaukee, WI",760,203,57,3.0,10/29/2009,"this is one of those places that i think suffers because of how large it has gotten... the food is excellent... the service is hurting a little bit though... anything these people do with a potato is golden... they have giant heart attack baked potato filled with 10,000 worth of goodies, enough for a meal, but here in america a baked potato is only a side so this is tricky... their potato wedges are excellent as well, like excellent.... they also have amazing mashed potatoes, some cheese flavor they add to them makes them in the top five i've ever had... also probably the worst for you... their pizza's are good but nothing to write home about, also nothing to mention first in my review obviously... they also have the pazuki's the fresh cookie desserts with ice cream on top... this is the only time i will probably ever say this, but skip the starter just to make it to the dessert... its worth it... they have numerous flavors of cookies, and the ice cream itself must be made from the utter of a holy cow because it is just that good..."
Carlos R.,"North Hollywood, CA",74,335,35,4.0,8/17/2009,"they got rid of the mini basil appetizer pizza thing =( that was enough to drop a star.  but the great service and quality of food, stepped it up a notch. mind you, this was rush hour friday night stomach traffic.  this was this one awkward moment, i loved it. i ordered one of them sangrias. the dude bringing it over, stopped at our table, thought to himself, ""where's the girl?"" walked past us, then looked again towards our table and asked my cousin and friend luis if we'd ordered the sangria. i raised my hand up. that was funny."
John F.,"Milpitas, CA",51,57,5,3.0,5/30/2009,"i came here to catch up with some old high school buddies. the place is big and has big screen tvs near the bar. Food was ok and service is good. They messed up on my friend's order, but the manager took it off the bill! If you have enough room, I recommend the pizookie for dessert."
Roger C.,"Rosemead, CA",129,91,3,1.0,2/12/2009,"Ive been to other BJ's and i like it, but this particular one...SUCKS!!!!! 1 hour AND 45 minutes to get our food AND it was cold!!!!! DUB TEE EF!!! Can i give this place ZERO stars?"
Robert B.,"La Canada Flintridge, CA",0,1,,4.0,9/10/2010,"2 recent visits,  good food at fair prices.  Service needs work but the food is special.  Had many menu items including the healthest item on the menu chicken lettice wrap. Another observation is that the restrooms need to be checked every 7 to 12 minutes. There was a shortage of toilet paper and paper towels on the floor.  I would hope the openings could be in the 15% increase per year.  Good luck and keep improving the product.  Robert Bender"
Erika E.,"Glendale, CA",424,901,741,3.0,9/8/2009,"You know BJ's? I guess Glendale needed something like this, familiar name brand, familiar food, slow (painful at times) service, measured pours and lots of flat screen TV's. All good right? Good for the after-work -and-a-game-is -on-crowd."
Gabriel A.,"Chino, CA",5,13,3,1.0,11/26/2009,"This Bjs has the worst service. I have been here 5 times and every single time their service is slow, orders get screwed up, and the waiter starts throwing the check at you before she even bothered asking if you need something else. We have had two experiences with the female manager when we have complained and all she does is back her employees up and apologize. If you want good pizza and beer just go to Mario's and then stop at Daves next door for great drinks."
joseph s.,"Los Angeles, CA",16,170,1,3.0,11/22/2009,"The food here is not overly spectacular, but their drinks are pretty top notch, specifically the Jeremiah Red. Oh how I have gotten drunk here so many times, whether it was early morning, midday, or late night. Usually I leave with a happy face and pretty good memories..."
Sarah W.,"Glendale, CA",10,37,,4.0,2/15/2010,"Great beer, good pizza, usually very good service, parking garage with validation, fun atmosphere."
Rosa L.,"Los Angeles, CA",28,103,19,4.0,7/4/2009,"My favorite place to watch basketball game and eat! The food portions are huge, because I always get too full to finish pazookie! Strawberry Daiquiri is amazing! I love everything on the menu! it fascinates me everytime..but the service is slow at times, because there's too many people..but it's okay, no need to rush!"
Sophie D.,"Corona, CA",106,85,6,3.0,11/1/2008,"I can't decide whether to do 3 or 4 stars - I'm going with 3 for this location. OK - parking - in the garage - very far away from the restaurant so that sucketh. Secondly, the noise level in this place is off the charts - at lunch, at dinner, in the room with all the TV's or the ""dining"" area. You can barely hear yourself think, let alone the person dining along with you.  The food is pretty decent, but it usually arrives tepid. It's also difficult to get a waitresses attention at this location. They seem to be focusing their boobs, I mean attention, on the male customers who more assuredly tip them more. If you don't order alcohol with your meal here you apparently don't exist. They push alcohol more than the food. The only redeeming part of this location is that it is near the best part of Glendale so if you are shopping you can stop in for a bite. (Chicken salad pretty darn great!) Maybe they will hire some male, non alcohol pushing, waiters and my next experience will be better and my food might be warmer."
Brooks B.,"Lakeville, CT",1,4,,4.0,4/13/2012,"Definitely a late night sports type scene so a good place for happy hour, drinking, and partying with your friends.  The food is real good too, but the fact that you cant make reservations unless its a party of 10 or more is kind of a bummer since most of the time the wait is 30+ minutes.  They also give you a buzzer to let you know your up but mine didnt ever go off and we were literally sitting 5 feet away from the front desk and after 45 to an hour of waiting we walked up and asked how much longer and they said they had called our names.  Well being 5 feet away we didnt hear them and whats the point of a buzzer if you dont use it.  Besides the unorganized mess of a front waiting area, the food was good.  Pizza and steak were both delicious as well as their root beer floats.  The waitress was also very attentive even with the amount of people in her area, continually coming to see how we were doing and if we needed anything else.  It is a nice place to come once in a while but I dont want so long to get a spot."
Dave L.,"New York, NY",112,130,13,2.0,1/1/2009,"BJ's really needs to get their acts together.   I came here with a group of people.  Now, let me ask this question.  What are the odds where two of our orders came out wrong? We had ordered two small size pizzas and to our surprise, two mini's were severed.  Upon complaint, they immediately rushed for two new small pizzas (Mediterranean and Mushroom).  Even these came out mediocre.  One of the pizzas was supposed to be served with mushrooms and yet, BJ managed to forget this.   What made the experience that much worse was the fact that our waitress was suppose to bring the mini pizzas back out for us to snack on, but instead, she returned claiming that it was thrown out. So in all, I gave BJ's a 2 star."
Eric M.,"Los Angeles, CA",10,51,,4.0,7/11/2008,I have to say one of the better Bj's i have been to. The staff was very nice and friendly and the manager was very attentative. The food was excellent and it was an all around good experience. Plus the location is ideal if you want to do any shopping afterwards. On a sidenote there drinks are pretty stiff tooo!!!
