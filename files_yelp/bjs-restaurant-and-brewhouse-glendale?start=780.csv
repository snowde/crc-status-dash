Jesse L.,"Glendale, CA",2,28,,2.0,8/25/2008,"If it wasn't for tasting BJ's food at other locations, I surely would have given this location one star based on my sole experience at the Glendale location.   I went to BJ's with a group of friends late on Friday night.  We were seated on the patio.  It took a LONG time for us to be acknowledged by our server.  My mealtime companions and I were happily chatting away, however and barely noticed the delay.  When the server finally arrived with our beers, she announced that she was going on her break and that another server would be looking after us in the meantime.  This other server that was allegedly supposed to be watching over us never appeared.  After another VERY, VERY LONG while a third server brought out our salads.  Our entrees arrived less than two minutes after the salads, dropped off by yet another server.  I must emphasize the ridiculously long amount of time between the time that our food was ordered and it arrived.  Our food was cold.  All of it.  We would have complained, but no one ever checked back on us.  Several of us had fries with our meals, yet there was nary a a bottle of ketchup to be found on the patio-- and no server to ask to bring us one.   Eventually, we got tired of waiting and ate our cold, condiment-less food anyway.  As I mentioned at the beginning of this review, I've eaten at other locations.  I've always found BJ's food to be above average, if uninspired chain restaurant fare.  As it turns out, though, it really sucks when it's cold.  Long after we had finished eating, our original server reappeared.  She asked us if everything was okay (it wasn't) and dropped off the check. Luckily, the evening wasn't entirely ruined.  My party still had a great time talking and we enjoyed our beers.  There was also some entertainment provided by other members of the BJ's staff.  We watched (in horror) as a hostess seated a couple at a nearby table that still had dirty dishes from the previous guests.  The best part was, she walked past several other clean, unoccupied tables to do so.  We also watched with amusement as another server (actually the one who was supposed to be watching us while our first server was on break) poured a glass of beer out of a pitcher for the table next to us.  Apparently no one ever told him that the standard procedure when pouring a beer is to go slowly and tilt the glass-- he failed to do this, filled quickly filled it to the brim, then seemed surprised when beer foam exploded out of the glass and all over the table and its occupants.   All of this leads me to believe that ours was not an isolated incident, and there is some incredibly poor training going on at this restaurant.  I will gladly drive to other locations rather than returning here."
Kathy P.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,18,3,5.0,7/21/2008,"this place gets five stars for it passes and exceeds expectations that i have when dining/drinking for the first time at a restaurant: quality, ambiance, service. the quality of food is perfectly proportionate for its price.  their food is served in good portions and are well seasoned.  i love their pizzas, their deep dish doesnt dissappoint with the hefty toppings, soft bread with the right amount of crust.  their basil/itallian sausage thin crust pizza is also a great accompaniment to their brews.  ive heard so much about their pizookie, rave reviews, but i haven't yet tried it, definitely next time.  great selection of brews, and if you're feeling adventurous, start your night off with some beer tasting (8.95 for 7 5oz. beers,  definitely a great introduction to BJ's brews).  i am not much into beers but i did like the blonde, the jeremiah red and the berry cider. the place is pretty cozy, with low lighting and rich dark wood furniture and creamy warm walls.  its manly enough to take a bunch of guys with you to see the game, cozy enough to bring your family and friends to for lunch or dinner, and romantic enough to take your date to (hey, i think thats a great plus, you get your sports and date in the same place, you get more points here than dragging her to a hooters, haha). i am impressed with the service.  the servers are very friendly and attentive.  we came on a friday night and it was pretty busy, but our server still made sure that we werent rushed through ordering, and our food came on time and well prepared.  he also was very informative and knowledgeable about their brews and was very honest when asked about preferences (which means he eats the food there... definitely a good sign of a good restaurant.  never eat at a place where their servers choose to eat somewhere else, or hasnt tasted their food at all :P). this is definitely a nice place to hang out at, and i will definitely be back...many more times!"
Michael K.,"Pasadena, CA",34,47,7,2.0,7/18/2008,"Well, the service here has evened-out; they stopped asking me how rad my pizzuky is all the time.  Now it's just a bit slow-- nothing big, but just as somebody at the table says ""Dude, is this taking, like, a real long time?"" the food comes.  The food is exactly what you deserve going into a place like this, or Red Robin, or Outback, so I wont complain.  The music made me angry, though.  Really, I'm just mad a myself for thinking their beers will make everything okay."
Sara S.,"La Cañada Flintridge, CA",0,9,,4.0,11/9/2011,"I go hear all the time when im craving their deserts but this last time i went we had a bad server in the corner booth.. honestly i wasnt even sure who our server was, there were 3 people checking up on us and it was freeeezzzinggg! make sure to take a sweater with u we changed are table and we were still good. but other than this last time its a great place and the servers are always really nice!"
drew d.,"Los Angeles, CA",18,42,11,1.0,8/26/2008,John Tesh brought out my pizookie!  His service is worse than his music!  So that means its worse than a barrel of poo-zookie!
Ivory B.,"Los Angeles, CA",118,37,,2.0,2/19/2008,"Nice Ambiance for a large group of people (lot of TV Screens) but that about all. The food was very bland, the chicken had no taste what so ever. The pizza is very breaded with not enough sauce. I was there for a B-Day party and we had an all you could eat for one price menu but it took so long in between servings that when the food did come out you had to race each other up to the buffet table to get it, because it would be gone in a few minutes. I think this place is more set up for kids who want a cheap place to hangout and eat and don't care about how the food taste."
Mirian M.,"Glendale, CA",0,1,,1.0,8/24/2013,"Worst service and BJ's ever! Ordered a hand tossed pizza received an extremely thin crust pizza informed the manager who then came and apologized and said to us that ""this is not how it's supposed to be we are very sorry and thank you for letting us know we spoke to the cook and we will fix the issue"" we waited for another 25min then brought us a deep dish pizza. The first check we received had a wrong charge. We informed our waiter who said she gave us discount but he is going to double check. when the check came she charged us for the deep dish pizza in full!!!!! Also food was brought to our table that we had not ordered sat at our table for a little while until we informed the waiter who then took the food that we had touched and took it to the right table. how do you charge patrons for something that you admitted you did wrong? Bad manager at least the waiter apologized for everything!"
Michael J.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,14,,5.0,8/11/2009,"All of the BJ's are packed with great food ! I enjoy visiting the Westwood location the most. I always have a great experience there, thanks to the great staff and management ! Thanks"
Ann G.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,73,72,3.0,9/11/2010,my first time here all i tried was the poozokie cause my freind said it was the best thing in the world. im a baker so i didnt find it amazing .  the waiter and hostess were pretty nice she sat us outside cause it was busy but  we didnt mind cause all we were having was dessert
Olivia J.,"Montebello, CA",74,364,73,3.0,9/7/2008,"We came to this location for the first time a couple weeks ago.  This location is probably one of the best BJ's I've seen.  We sat outside and it was nice to people watch and enjoy the nice LA weather.  I like BJ's because of their pizookie so that is all I ordered here.  My friend Drew D down below ordered a pizookie as well.  I must say the waiter that brought out our pizookies was a little rude to him.  Damn, can't remeber if he really looked like John Tesh or not - but yes, his attitude was uncalled for."
Armen B.,"CA, CA",87,209,42,3.0,2/3/2008,"Great location and ambiance.  I like the TVs all around the place.  Seems like a great place to watch major sporting events.  Food was good, service was ok, friendly staff.  The first 3 pages of the menu are for beers, house drinks and appetizers.  I'll go back."
perry k.,"Burbank, CA",2,22,,3.0,2/16/2009,"We went there tonight to celebrate our friends' birthdays and watch the all-star game.  It's a sports bar type of atmosphere with good beer.  That's the cool part.  The not-so-cool part is that I used to love this place, mainly the one in Burbank.  But ever since we've been coming to the one in Glendale (closer to our friend's house), it seems like a coin flip.  Sometimes, it's the screwing up of orders or the inconsistent food.  I mean, how can you mess up nachos?  I love the nachos there so we even ordered 2.  Some of the chips were stale instead of light and crunchy.  I don't know anymore.  I can't say it's bad because we love going there, but we're never sure what we're going to get.  Btw, the pizza's great!"
Andrew R.,"Los Angeles, CA",477,341,9,3.0,12/28/2007,"I'm going 3 stars here, because I've been here twice, time #1 was a disaster and I ended up sick for a week, time #2 was awesome and I had the best breadbowl soup I've ever had in my life.  To be honest, I think the place is slightly overpriced and the service was not great either time I was there... the other problem I have with BJ's is that it took over my favorite texmex restaurant around, Chevy's, and now I have to drive to Burbank to get the Chevy's fix.  However, it's a pretty good place, while also being nothing special at all.  3 stars."
Cindy T.,"Los Angeles, CA",190,127,55,2.0,10/28/2007,"..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Oh, hi. you been waiting long? Um, yeah. Don't sit in the bar if you want service. And if you're going to drink, pay attention to your bill. Magic drinks will suddenly appear out of  nowhere even though you didn't order them."
Liza B.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,79,,3.0,12/3/2007,"I give the atmosphere 4 stars. But I give the food 3 stars. The BJs in Glendale was huge and new/clean and my cousin was super impressed by all the flatscreen TVs mounted all over the walls (there were at least 6!) showing various football games. But like most standard American fare type places, the food is nothing to write home about. I ordered one of my all time fave dishes, pot roast, and it was mediocre. In fact, I was disappointed by how they cut up the meat into little bite-size portions. Why did they do that? That makes me nervous. Anyway, I would recommend the place as a bar/brewery/happy hour kind of place but not really for a truly culinary experience!"
Susan A.,"Little Falls, MN",0,14,,4.0,6/18/2011,Great service....great food....nice atmosphere....easy parking! Out server was delightful and the manager on duty was very attentive to our needs. We appreciated the great service and will be back for more! Good job!
Frank C.,"Los Angeles, CA",66,87,6,4.0,8/22/2008,"Good beers, good deep dish pizza, and PAZOOKIE! white chocolate macadamia nut cookie with vanilla ice cream."
Jackie F.,"Los Angeles, CA",289,201,10,3.0,5/27/2008,"All BJ's I've been to seem to be pretty much the same in terms of food quality.  A newer location opened not to long ago near my work so given it was Friday, we decided to head on down and check it out.  All of us ordered the lunch combos which consisted of half sandwich with soup or salad(seasoned fries on the side); or the pasta with soup or salad.  I got the Cobb sandwich with clam chowder.  I wasn't impressed at all with the half sandwich.  The clam chowder was hot and decent while the seasoned fries were pretty good as well.  Tried some of my co-worker's pasta which was not bad.  Next time I will most likely not order the sandwiches and stick with the pizza and pizookie."
Christy C.,"Los Angeles, CA",31,79,46,3.0,6/19/2008,clean and decent-decor family restaurant. of course i like its chicago pizza even though it's somewhat oily. but you gotta be careful when it comes to the beer selection cause i can warn you that they have few beers that are undrinkable. i'm serious.
A S.,"Pasadena, CA",0,26,,5.0,4/27/2011,Good food especially their Pizza! Good Beer! Nice appeizers! Good ambience and good service!
