Tatianna D.,"Burbank, CA",2,36,3,5.0,2/3/2017,"JULIO!  JULIO JULIO!   this gentleman made our experience absolutely perfect!  he went out of his way with every little detail of our meal and made sure we had everything we asked for and more.  So polite, so nice, such a fun friendly guy.    We can not say enough about him.  he was on top of EVERYTHING.  5 starts for julio. and the food was great too."
John Q.,"Burbank, CA",0,19,,1.0,9/25/2017,"We've consistently had bad service here but tonight was an all time low.  Never asked my wife if she'd like something to drink after I told the waiter I wanted to keep the menu for when she arrives in case she wanted a drink.  We've had long waits for food even when the place is empty like it was tonight.  Told the waiter to put an order in for the kid's pizookie in 5 minutes since the waiter said it can take 5-15 minutes for them to make it.  It took a half hour.   They never put my rewards number for the check like they usually do when I give the number to the hostess.   And the usual: took forever to get the check. Waiter never asked how our food was.  Never asked if we wanted anything else until I was signing the check.  Also, the waiter twice forgot to take the Monday night discount off the pizza.   We're never going back."
Stephanie G.,"Glendale, CA",652,204,355,5.0,1/5/2017,Bj 'a is always delicious. I came here yesterday ( by myself ) lol... and came for a drink obviously  the skinny margarita always hits the spot... BUT  my absolutely favorite appetizer is the BRUSSEL SPROUTS WITH BACON  & that honey Siracha Sauce is very very good!! The service is always pretty good... i mean everyone knows Bj's is bomb
Shane M.,"Lakewood, CA",186,10,1,2.0,9/13/2017,Just got back from here. Food was good as usual. Typical BJ's good experience. Came with a friend. The entire time the waitress was ignoring me. She wouldn't look at me or talk to me. She only every responded or talked to my friend and would actually look at her. Not sure if it's because I'm a man? Maybe she thought I was someone else? Maybe she didn't like that I had some tattoos & piercings. I don't know. I just do know that this was the worst service I've had since I've been in high school. Food would have 5 stars. Service would be 0.
Aashrey K.,"Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",9,2,,4.0,9/21/2017,I had a lovely dinner with family and the ambience was just perfect for everyone. I had the alfredo pasta and the bacon guacamole burger with a well done patty. Both dishes were served on time and were delicious. We also ordered the Guacamole egg rolls which weren't to my taste. The service was satisfactory. Overall very satisfactory experience!
Carmik T.,"Gilbert, AZ",67,382,737,3.0,2/26/2017,"Came in about 3:30 yesterday afternoon.  Parking is somewhat complicated, parking garage closest it's $1 every 15 minutes! We decided to park a little further away ( a few blocks) set the meter for 1:45 mins. We arrived at Bj's; I had to use the restroom prior to sitting. Both sinks faucets were on & one of the sinks was almost over-flowing! I tried turning them both off ( after I washed up of course) neither one would completely shut off. As I left the restroom, I approached one of the servers ( sitting on a bar stool @ the bar) & told her about the issue!  The restaurant didn't seem to busy, but our server Racheal; we noticed had quite a few tables in her area. However, ""all in all"" the restaurant during that time wasn't crowded by any means. In fact, we also noticed one of the chefs was either on his lunch break or off work as he was seating in a booth on the computer while we dined. Ordered our drinks when Racheal came to greet us. My daughter & myself got the Mango Lemongrass tea, my husband got the Sunset Peach Fusion $2.95 each. Neither seemed to be that ""spectacular in flavor"" for the price. We got our drinks fairly quick, although when asking for sugar that took a bit! We ordered a Large Caesar salad to split & a bowl of clam chowder. Our main Entree was a large pizza. In looking at the receipt (after), it also stated that the soup was a main entree? Ok!! Anyway, the food took some time to arrive.  The salad was presented first, that was good. The soup arrived with the pizza & was less than luke warm & less than satisfactory! The serving size very disappointing for $6.75 ! No complaints on the pizza!  Our daughter had the kids meal & for the price /portion, the best deal of the day! $6.25 that was less than what they charged ($6.75) for that lousy soup.. LOL Our girl really enjoyed the honey mustard dip that came along with the chicken strips!  Over all disappointed with the service & the cost. Our daughter had to use the restroom after we ate and I accompanied her. The sink issue was still a problem. The faucet my daughter used was HOT & slightly burnt her skin when she put her hands under the sink. Urrgg!! Fix it!!  BTW- By the time we returned to our vehicle the meter time had almost expired. Glad we fed it all those coins for that full amount of time we spent dinning..LOL"
Christina S.,"Nashville, TN",164,2,,1.0,9/2/2017,"I figured I would give this restaurant/company one more try. Recently moving from Florida where those were terrible I figured why not. Boy was I wrong. Don't even waste your time and money. Service was terrible, the waiter got my order wrong and then messed up again, ordered an alcoholic drink that was very warm, ordered a different alcoholic drink that tastes like straight juice. The Mahi tacos were more cabbage than fish and the Caesar salad had barely any dressing. Let's just say the whole company as a whole cross country is just terrible. Never again. Although thank you to the manager for taking care of us. Only plus!"
Lisa S.,"Long Beach, CA",1309,1836,312,4.0,12/19/2016,"Even though we had a really large party, the food came out quickly and there wasn't one snafu. I've been indulging too much lately, so I ordered the seared ahi salad, and I have to say that it was very refreshing! I was tempted to get a pizookie, maybe to share, but I was good and kept that for another time."
Kayane J.,"Agoura Hills, CA",49,40,141,3.0,8/6/2016,"It's great for late night munching and a good variety of beer, they're open until 1am on Saturdays and the kitchen is open until 12:45 so it's pretty good if you're in Glendale and there's nothing much around at this time.  However, we got seated at our table and it was pretty dirty with multiple visible food particles. The waitress was very nice and friendly but then the water cups and plates came and they had dirty stains as well. We let them know about the table and they apologized and cleaned it but it was still dirty. I guess we just gotta let them know, maybe they were really busy. I kind of wish they can take some clorox wipes every morning and wipe all the  pages of their menus down. The menus were so sticky and gross. When I first opened mine, it literally made me lose my appetite. I saw pieces of some greens, like lettuce and parsley, stuck on some of the pages and it was such a turn off. My friends and I were really hungry and it was pretty late, so we sucked it up and stayed. I just wish they can read this and learn something from it. The vegetarian deep dish pizza was very salty but still delicious so we did finish it haha!  They have a big bar and the restaurant is spacious so it can handle big groups of people. The location is great, right on brand boulevard in Glendale, next to the Americana mall."
Joanna C.,"Sun Valley, CA",125,7,,5.0,5/22/2017,"Take Out and curb side service is the best! They always double check my large orders to make sure I'm not missing anything. Whenever we ask for anything extra, they go above and beyond getting that for us.  While waiting for my order, they'll offer something to drink while I wait.  Super friendly and accommodating staff. Thanks for the great service!"
Ruben G.,"South El Monte, CA",0,32,20,1.0,2/4/2017,"After finding a day that worked for all of us, my friends and I decided to go to BJs to celebrate my bday because another buddy had never had BJs before. I am saddened that my friend had such a disappointed experience and I had a disappointing bday. After waiting an hour to be seated, we waited another hour and a half before our food came out. One of my friends ordered a pizza and they made a mistake, so they made a new one which was great. What wasn't great is that they brought out all the food together, so everyone else's food was cold. When it came time for dessert, everyone else's pizooki but mine was brought out.  Horrible experience.  Update: after speaking with the manager, they didn't charge us for the two pizzas and the late pizooki. Update 2: the new receipt charged us for additional things we didn't even order.  Update 3: the pen they gave us to sign the receipt didn't even work lol."
Aaron A.,"Rosemead, CA",0,8,,5.0,7/9/2017,"My girlfriend and I come here for the great selection of beer, but we mostly come back for Michelle! She knows our order right when we sit down. And is very knowledgeable of the menu. Thank you for great service."
Monica G.,"Los Angeles, CA",116,129,156,3.0,2/1/2017,"We went for a work happy hour.   Our waitress was Breanna.   She was very attentive to our large group.   The manager also was very attentive,  he assisted us in fixing our table which was very unstable.  The food orders came our fast and consistent with what we ordered."
Natalie P.,"Sacramento, CA",2,27,32,5.0,9/15/2016,"I never imagined I would be giving a chain restaurant like BJs a 5 star, but damn the service here is awesome. My boyfriend and I have come a few times before, and we typically have Tanya as our server. (Who is absolutely amazing) This time around our server was Joe, or Joseph, and he was fantastic! He was very quick and attentive, and also charming and kind! Overall great service from him!  Food was delicious, like always. We ordered the calamari and a California club sandwich, both delicious. Especially the calamari, so so so good!  I usually have at least one thing I believe a restaurant can improve on, but honestly I can't think of one for this BJs. I will be coming back:)"
Marianna K.,"Glendale, CA",12,24,5,1.0,11/5/2017,"This is our favorite place to go with kids. Nice food, affordable, quick service. Not today! We sat at the bar with my son because it appeared to be busy. We took a booth of people who just left and I asked a waitress to clean it. 10 minutes later she passed by and I asked her to clean it and she gave an attitude and cussed. My ten year old son even made a comment saying Mom I think she is annoyed with us. Few minutes later someone else came and cleaned the table. Another 10 minutes after that I waived again asking for a menu. Another waiter came by and apologized for wait and took our order. He didn't write anything down. I said aren't you going to write it? He said no I will remember. I was pretty impressed. Five minutes later he comes back asking to repeat the order really? Then the waitress comes back saying they didn't have one of the dips and if I wanted something else. I ordered something else. Well of course that never arrived either.. Anyhow the food was terrible! The chicken tenders were cold almost like frozen inside, we left them untouched. My Mac and cheese was cold.. it was just the worst experience ever!"
Alyssa R.,"Los Angeles, CA",31,58,2,1.0,10/22/2017,"So my husband and I frequent BJ's quite often at the Brea and Burbank locations.. however, this location is by far THE WORST one.  We walked in with my 19 month old and the host decides to sit us down at a two person table so we were forced to shove the table next to us ourselves for more space. Talk about lack of common sense. Next, we ordered our food. My husband ordered the Ahi salad and I had the guacamole burger. When the food came out, my fries were super cold.. I sent them back.. I guess they just tossed the burger that was also cold back on the plate with hot fries. When I got my food with hot fries.. my burger was cold. I sent it back. They returned it back hot and the fries were cold again! Lol! Then the waitress brings us cosmos that taste like shit. The manager came over.. who was very nice and didn't charge us for the drinks or the burger. I asked one of the other managers for a box and she never showed up so we we ended up leaving the food there untouched.. drinks untouched.. needless to say.. we will NOT be returning to this location. It was just horrible."
Roxanne A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,14,,5.0,8/27/2017,TANYA!!!!!!! Is a true asset to the company! She provided over the top amazing service!!!! Thank You again for making my family's dinner a good one
Helen P.,"Los Angeles, CA",180,217,164,3.0,6/8/2016,"I've been to this location a few times and I have to say as much as I love their pizza, I don't really like their service. I came here yesterday with my coworker for lunch around 2pm. The restaurant was not that busy, there were a few tables here and there but the restaurant definitely wasn't crowded. We got seated by this guy at the front who kept mumbling- we could not understand what he was saying.  Our server was this girl who had a nervous giggle. Whenever we wanted to order something or ask for water she would giggle- it was odd (because really, nothing was that funny). My friend got the California Club lunch and I got the Unlimited soup and salad combo. I got the chili because I wanted something hearty and the mozzarella and tomato salad. In about 10 minutes my friend got his sandwich special first. I saw there and stared at him for a few minutes while he ate his fries, since he's a gentleman he was waiting for me to get my food so he can devour his. Several more minutes pass by and now we are wondering why ladling premade chili and a cold salad would take longer than a hot sandwich?  Finally several minutes later our server appears with my food. I was tempted to order my next round at the moment since it obviously takes forever for them to get it out but I resisted. She never returned to check up on us after we started eating. I finally caught her again and asked for the Caesar salad, they actually did give a decent portion of the chili so I didn't bother trying another soup.  My friend wanted to order dessert- he got the caramel and sea salt pizookie and I got my Caesar salad (which most of it was limp romaine by the way). We were on a bit of a time crunch because we were on our lunch break so we started getting worried when his cookie didn't come out. We also couldn't find our server anywhere and mind you the restaurant WAS STILL NOT BUSY. We had to flag down a different server so we could ask them to tell our server for our check- she finally brought it out and we immediately gave her our cards to pay. We also scarfed down the cookie because we were running pretty late at that point. I gotta say, I would not recommend this place if you are looking for a quick lunch, they seem to take their sweet time and can't really say the service was all that great....too bad because I still love their pizzas!"
Claudia Y.,"Glendale, CA",0,13,6,1.0,11/1/2017,"Poor service started at the door and extended itself to the table. We were seated after more than 30 minutes waiting  yet there were tables available but the staff did not want to sit 2 in a table of 4. We ordered food but it did not arrive within 40 or so minutes so we ended up cancelling the order and leaving. Oh, and the bill took at least 10 minutes to make it to the table."
Dan D.,"Valencia, CA",0,17,2,1.0,6/28/2017,"Visited Sat afternoon with family. This location lacked energy and played horrible music. With only a few tables taken, we got seated in the bar area, hello we have our kids with us ! Upon seating, given dirty, sticky menus. We left after 15 minutes, never to return. Other locations much better."
