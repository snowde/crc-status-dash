Tiffany T.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",31,109,57,5.0,6/19/2008,"I've always heard about BJ's cause my friends go all the time, but I've never had the chance to go until recently. My group and I were looking for a late meal, and thankfully BJ's was still open at 10pm. I ordered the Jambalaya which I must say is the BEST most amazing jambalaya I have ever had. The portion was huge and extremely flavorful. I also tried a bite of my friend's pizza, which I'm not sure which one, but it was also really good. I'd love to go back, if only there was one closer to my home.."
Michael T.,"Los Angeles, CA",72,65,,3.0,6/4/2008,"Bj's pretty much same as all the others, but the hand drafted root beers here are better than the others, for some reason this one makes the entire mug frozen and icy, the ones i've been to has never done that. Awesome..."
Miguel M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,10,,2.0,10/22/2011,"A horrid and awkward dinning experience that I would like to soon forget. The customer service of the restaurant is in more dire need than the current economic status of the country. We first ask for a booth and are almost given a table, fine that's a small mistake. Then comes the bitter waiter who tries to be funny. First, he tries to push beer down our throats like we are alcoholics. Then, water is spilled and he does not come and clean it up, I begin to clean it and then another employee sees the mess and comes and helps. Then he says no beer here after trying to push for beer. Well no tip here loser. The service was slow we waited for a long time for our appetizers and we were the first ones in there. We ordered the pizza and it was not great. You could get a better pizza if you ordered delivery and it would have been cheaper. We flag down any waiter since he is no longer coming by the table to ask for drinks and also when we wanted the check. Then he finally comes and picks up the bill with the payment. I feel bad not leaving tip after all and ask for change so I can leave tip. This masterful illusionist makes my ten turn into 5 singles. I ask him for the other 5 dollars and he was like you gave me a 10? Yes, I guess he took it for his tip since he knew he was a neglectful waiter. After all this I finally did tip, but I will not be soon returning to this BJ's. Maybe after I forget this experience I might."
Tasha H.,"Portland, OR",223,243,9,5.0,2/28/2008,"it is the most Amazing thing to find a place in Glendale that i like. i decided to do my 22nd bday here; they were very helpful when i made a reservation for 20 people. when we all got there, it was packed so we decided to mingle at the bar until our table was ready. the bartender gave me a free shot (happy bday to me!), and by the time our table was ready i was already tippin with the drinks that i had. its funny cause it took a whole 7 mins for my named to be called to seat us. everything was brought out quickly, we had our appetizers, beers, and whatever else we were ordering on the table before i could start another drink. and the waiters we so damn nice... i was really so effing happy that we had nice people that actually didnt hate their lives waiting our table. yea, they got a generous tip. stupidest thing: i had to haggle the guy at the ticketbooth because he was demanding that i pay a dollar to get out... when i clearly didnt have a dollar on me (i use debit card!) so he finally let me go after i kept giving him my nice drunk-girl smile. go me."
Kdu b.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,58,4,1.0,9/30/2008,"Where do I begin with my comments?  I never write reviews....usually just read them.  But, my experience was so bad that I felt it necessary to share. I have only been to BJs in Burbank before going to the Glendale  location. I love their berry cider, avocado eggrolls, and the pazookie.  So when it opened up here I decided to go there for my b-day with hubby, daughter ,sister, and mother.  I like the decor of the place ,,, however ...since I guess they are going for an upscale sports bar kind of thing...it's like being at the game in one giant space.  Since there are no partitions, the noise level in incredibly loud.  I don't think designers today consider this factor.  In Burbank, although there are room separations, the back room ceiling is high, and you can literally not hear one word the person sitting across from you says.  Huh?  Huh?  How many times can you ask someone to repeat something without looking like an idiot?  Or deaf?  Ha...  Just nod and say 'yeah' alot politely like you understand, and if someone gives you a really funny face...you know you shouldn't have said yeah that time!   ;o) Anyway, G-dale is super loud and obnoxious.  Except it's EVERY seat.  I got up and crusied around to check out the whole place...it's all loud.  Our waiter was a cute little fellow who was super enthusiastic - maybe a little too much so with no real skills to back it up with.  I immediately ordered my cider when he 1st came by.  The appetizers came, I asked about it ... he replied with 'it's on its way!"" ... the meal arrived, I asked about it ... he replied ""it's on its way""... I started eating and I asked a busboy about who brings the drinks...he said he would check.  I was about 1/2 way done before waiter-guy came by and told me that they had run out.  Run out?  And he didn't know this a 1/2 hour before?  This was only one problem ... and kind of a major one since you want a drink...especially when it's your birthday...and dweeb-boy knew that.  In fact, my sister was paying for the event and she specifically asked for the check when we were done, and he promptly handed it to my hubby.   These are just a few of the overall problems we had.  Sure, it was newer then, but their system sucks.  Either they have too many tables per server, or the areas are too big, or something's wrong.  We could never find our guy in the vastness and noise and my elderly mother was having a fit about the whole thing.  One thing I do know is this ... I haven't been back since, and probably won't go again.  Just left a bad taste in my mouth, even though the eggrolls taste great!  If our work group has a lunch, I'll go.  But to pay for it myself...HIGHLY doubtful."
Robo J.,"San Gabriel, CA",6,40,6,3.0,2/7/2010,"my boyfriend and i came here for dinner on a friday night. the wait wasn't too bad. like a 25 minute wait. we were contemplating between the spinach dip (my favorite) or the spinach and artichoke pizza (never had it before). our server told us that we should try the pizza so we did. blah. i wish we got the spinach dip instead. you can barely even tell it's a spinach & artichoke pizza. boo hoo hoo. anyways, our server was nice though. the pizookie was okay. maybe i have a weak throat because i had a sore throat the next day after eating that. -_-"
Richard C.,"Hollywood, CA",59,18,,4.0,5/15/2010,"For a ginormous snack for two, order the nachos and cheese on a large platter with rainbow chips, melted cheese and a surprise treasure of beans at the bottom.  Wash this down with a beer sampler and you won't have room for a pizookie.  The calzones are nice, too.  But their pizzas look too thick for me.  I've found the service good.  You'd better like sports on TV, though; that's all you get."
Audge H.,"Glendale, CA",126,9,,1.0,3/8/2012,"ate at bjs last night . service was alright but mainly, after a late dinner i wokeup at 4 am not able to go to class. this place needs to cleanup. thanks for the stomach flu..."
Derek Z.,"Tujunga, Los Angeles, CA",293,328,210,1.0,8/7/2008,"To be honest, i really don't know why we stayed and finished our meal after the SNAFU that went down at BJ's. We were here to celebrate a friends bday. The service was a bit slow all around, we had to ask a few times to refill water and to get new drinks. Now, here is where it all went to hell. I was eating a side caesar salad before my main course arrived and right before i finished the salad i took a bite out of an already chewed piece of gum that was mixed in the salad. I felt like puking and i was disgusted with the whole experience. I had the manager come over to see the secret surprise item that was added to my salad. He was extremely apologetic and wanted to comp some of the items we were eating. I made it a point to tell him that i or we didn't want anything comped because i didn't want him to think we did this on purpose or to try to get something for free. He came back with a gift card as a gesture, but i asked him to donate it to charity. I just wanna make sure something like this doesn't happen to someone else. I've eaten or tried weirder things but chewing gum? hell no. I don't think i would ever come back here again to eat or drink."
Cynthia G.,"Glendale, CA",4,52,4,3.0,8/3/2011,this place is definitely smaller than the one in burbank but it'll still do. their food is great and the atmosphere is fun. i always go there when theres good games to watch.
Jeremy M.,"Pasadena, CA",0,10,,2.0,9/20/2009,"Came here a little past noon on a Saturday to watch a USC game. Service is TURTLE SLOW even though the place barely had anyone there. Our beyond-retarded waiter, David, forgot our fish tacos. We asked another waitress what happened to our tacos and she didn't even bother passing on our inquiry. We got hold of another waitress later on and finally got told that David never knew about an order of fish tacos. David never knew because he's got the IQ of an aborted fetus."
Caitlin B.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,5,,5.0,6/12/2009,BJ's just started serving these new Flatbread Appetizer Pizza's I had them at westwood first. I tried the margerita which I loved but now I had the california chicken club which is out of this world. They are the best appetizer by far im addicted!!!!
Amy L.,"Los Angeles, CA",189,259,69,3.0,2/21/2008,"kindly take your brewhouse nachos and slap it on my thighs. and that creamy santa fe salad that i always order...on my ass please. oh, oh, let's not forget the stuffed potatoes...go ahead and strap those on my arms. make sure it's one on each arm ok. omg, i almost forgot, that darn pizookie...just drop it on my stomach. right there, right in the middle. that's where all this unhealthy food will end up going anyways."
min k.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,57,20,1.0,1/25/2012,"came here today for lunch with two others. we ordered the cajun pasta, fettucini alfredo. both with chicken. we also had some tacos. all were lunch specials and the pastas came along with soups. the soups were chilli and clam chowder. first off, the servers were friendly and nice. when i came to the food, yuk. the soups came out later than the pastas. the chilli soup had a strong smell and taste of hard liquor. the clam chowder tasted exactly the same as the progresso chowder except much more salty. the pastas came along with two pieces of garlic bread as well. i've never had nasty garlic bread, and this is the one. omg.. the fettucini.. wow... it tasted sooooooooooooooooooooooooooo bland. the sauce wasn't there and omgomgomg wtf?! seriously?! i was jst eating cuz i felt bad for the person who treated me out for lunch. and even that person said dat dish was a ripoff. and my pasta had no chicken when it came out. but later the server brough me the chicken. i would've forgotten lols. anyways. if you want to get some food, i would recommend microwaving frozen meals."
