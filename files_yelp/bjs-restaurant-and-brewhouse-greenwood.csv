Eric U.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,2,,4.0,9/4/2017,My favorite late night place for an awesome  Pizza . Last Saturday night we decided to have a pizza so my first choice has always  been BJ's.  We placed our order for beer and waited for the pizza . We noticed It was taking longer than normal for our pizza when the Manager came up and notified us that the pizza was sitting in the window and someone else took it to another table for another customer so we waited for another one to be made and delivered. I know this was no fault of our waitress but when we finally got ours delivered it was cold . I didn't say anything about it being cold but I wanted to .  I feel sorry for the waitress since she told me this had been happening all night to her orders.  We will keep visiting BJ 's since we love the bar and home brewed beer. The pork chop dinner is the best one around Indy
Lisa B.,"Carmel, IN",4,43,2,1.0,11/6/2017,"The service was horrible, 10 minutes for our server just to greet us.  Our appetizer came out before our drinks, good luck ever getting a refill.  The food was ok, the only really good food on the menu was the mash potatoes.  I think this location needs better managers and employees."
Sanford R.,"Bloomingdale, IL",6,349,2,3.0,11/2/2017,"My experience here was ordering take-out. It was a decent dinner, but I think I was expecting a little more. Perhaps it was due to me ordering pizza here though, because my wife really loved her steak. The signature deep dish pepperoni was OK, but not quite amazing. However, both my wife and I loved the pizookie we had for dessert.  I think I would give them a second chance if I ever am near one again. It looked like a nice place to sit down for a meal."
Nick S.,"Columbus, IN",136,25,5,5.0,12/31/2017,"This place is fun. I first discovered BJ's Brewhouse in Ohio near my college. Then I happened to run into the original California location on a college spring break trip. This chain has certainly evolved from that original pizza shack. The Greenwood location is a huge TV-equipped restaurant with an even larger menu. The deep dish pizza is still a highlight, but if you are like me, you will probably be looking for a lighter meal after filling up on craft beer and appetizers. They have great burgers, Mediterranean Pita sandwiches, and surprisingly salads. Of course they have the Pizzookie, too--essentially a cookie cake baked in a deep dish pizza pan--that is always tempting. Service is quick, and they have a cool app for their loyalty program and to-go."
B B.,"Indianapolis, IN",15,115,36,5.0,12/30/2017,OK my faith in BJ's has been restored the last to visits have been 5 .  I did receive an email from the region ops person requesting a second chance in Indiana with a promise the issues would be fixed.  Job well done thanks for walking the walk.
Taylor T.,"Greenwood, IN",6,11,16,4.0,12/22/2017,"Solid experiences each time I have gone so far :) Good drink selection, friendly staff, and yummy food!"
Jane T.,"San Francisco, CA",0,3,,4.0,11/12/2017,"I love BJ's.  I usually go by myself.  It seems like the waiters are extra attentive, but they have all been very friendly and helpful.  I like all their food, but especially their clam chowder.  It rivals any I have had in Indiana   My friends and I stayed about 3 hours one day catching up.  We were made to feel welcome and not rushed out even though we had stopped ordering.  They even kept offering to refill our ice tea."
Michell M.,"Zionsville, IN",61,70,40,4.0,11/16/2017,"Really lovely decor - wood, large curved booths and chandeliers!  A must order are the artichoke hearts BUT ask them for a side of horseradish sauce for them (trust me - will make them SMACK YOUR MAMA GOOD)!!!  Salads are visually stunning and the flavors are incredible - give a try to their pizza type sandwiches - it is like a thin crust pizza wrapped and grilled - DELICIOUS!   Some of the best fries I've had - this is a win win and can't wait to go back!   Wait staff and hostesses are incredible friendly and helpful and take your glasses because the menu is HUGE!!!    Think Scotty's Brewhouse meets Cheesecake Factory and their menu had a baby - it is THAT good!!!"
Ashley J.,"Greenwood, IN",64,63,13,4.0,9/10/2017,"We love BJs Brewhouse! Their appetizers are really good. The deep dish pizza is great. I love the parmesan crusted chicken with mashed potatoes and broccoli. They bring out little garlic bread knots for the kids right after you order, which helps keep them occupied. You should definitely end dinner with a pazookie... a large, fresh baked cookie with ice cream on top! Big enough to share!"
Jason A.,"Indianapolis, IN",18,213,2,3.0,5/4/2017,"Not a bad place, I ate here a couple of yrs ago and didn't think good or bad, it's moved up a spot since then. Got in after a day of errands, was tired and it was the closest thing. Place was busy, got seated immediately, waitress was attentive in and out at just the right times. Split the kale/roasted brussel sprout salad, really good, got a small veggie pizza, not bad either drank water as I wasn't feeling the beer thing so late. Got in and out for a little over $30, can't complain. I know it's a chain but this place is a little less sysco-ish than it's neighbors, price point is slightly higher but food quality is better imo. I wouldn't run right to this place again but I wouldn't object either."
Shawn S.,"Shelbyville, IN",34,142,32,5.0,9/5/2017,The girlfriend and I stopped in for some desert. Salted carmal pazooki was amazing. The girlfriend probably needs a wet wipe after licking the pan clean.
Ginger M.,"Whiteland, IN",5,5,,1.0,12/10/2017,"This was a bad bad experience that started w a fork w old food stuck to it in my napkin roll, my husband ordered a burger WELL WELL done that was raw in the middle that he wouldn't eat but was charged for anyway, the server said the manager took half off but the manager never bothered to say a word to us. Server would walk off while i was talking to her. They were crazy busy but understaffed. It was just a bad time.  BJs is awsome in texas, i was excited to show my husband but wow they blew it."
Belinda R.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,7,,5.0,1/1/2018,Great Ladies Night with pizza special on Monday's..Good service with great food choices...
Jeremy M.,"Indianapolis, IN",254,320,132,3.0,8/25/2017,"Grabbed a quick dinner here with a friend before seeing a movie. They have a lot of beers to choose from and I rather enjoyed the two I tried. I also enjoyed the burger I ordered. Really, the worst thing here was the service. We were one of maybe four tables at the time and our waiter was still MIA whenever we needed more to drink, checks, or anything else. He also didn't have a great grasp of the menu when we asked questions and then blamed it on corporate changing things all the time. So overall it was a fine meal, but staff that know what they're talking about and are around to talk about it would really help."
David M.,"Indianapolis, IN",29,89,57,5.0,10/2/2016,"I love this place , the food is great, even better is the beer selection. I come here for a good burger , I really enjoyed the smoke house burger. Also if you want a burger you can feel good about , the bison burger is 700 calories and is delicious.  Wings are hot and crisp and awesome . But here's the best, the staff are top notch when it comes to service . They always are very nice. But here's where it Gets good, so my wife was looking at our bill and was complaining to me about how much it was. Little did she know the waiter was behind her and proceeded to take our bill and said he was gonna take care of it. Came back with 10 bucks off. Like for no reason! Well that's what I call really awesome people . I'm coming back for sure"
Mike B.,"Great Falls, VA",17,38,82,1.0,9/23/2017,Not your typical BJ restaurant.  I go to the BJs in Virginia and Pittsburgh on a regular basis.   We were a group of five.  Four of the meals came out and my dinner didn't come out.  We had to ask as we weren't told what happened.   I had ordered shrimp tacos. - not a long prep time item.  Every other member in our party had finished their food before the manager took the time to come over to apologize. My food arrived at same time as our check arrived.  The manager said they thought other manager  had handled the situation or moved the miss order up in the process - neither of which happened.  Very disappointing.
Jalee L.,"Indianapolis, IN",124,122,244,5.0,5/15/2016,"I am very comfortable with the statement that BJ's is in fact my favorite Pizza in the Indy area. It's a lot of commitment, I know, but I have been through the gamete of local pizza joints and chains alike and nothing can rival the perfection. It's thick (more than hand-tossed, less than true chicagoan) with a blended crust (not rimmed) that is buttery, but never greasy. It's pepperoni is more than just circular, its cubed, sliced and chunks covering every inch. As the name implies- it's Pepperoni Extreme.  It pairs perfectly with BJ's Pizookie (Yes, a cookie made in a pizza tin) served with ice-cream. Cookies & Cream, Triple Chocolate Chunk, Peanut Butter, Macadamia nut, etc etc. Go all the way and do 1/2 & 1/2 on the pizooki flavors. Peanut Butter and Chocolate paired will never lead you wrong.  Since you are at a brewhouse- give the Jerry Burst a try. It's a mixture of Jeremiah Red and a Berry Burst Cider. It lightens the beer and balances the cider's sweetness. If non-alcoholic is your preference their homemade cream soda will hit the spot.  Needless to say, with a meal like this, I wish yelp would let me give 10 stars."
Kim H.,"Greenwood, IN",0,4,,1.0,12/12/2017,Never again! My last two meals were atrocious!!! First meal we were a party of five. Three of the orders were okay but the other two YUCK! The stuffed mushrooms had to be sent back and we finally received them at the end of the meal. My salad had the wrong dressing and my husband's steak was so rare ( ordered medium) he had to send it back. Second attempt at the steak was just as bad- overdone and he couldn't even chew it. Tonight we tried carry out - deep dish pizza. I called and was told I'd have to wait another 5-10 minutes because it wasn't finished. No problem. It was cold and dried out. Not what I'm expecting for a fresh pizza that I had to wait longer for. BJ's is just too much money for very subpar food.
Brent B.,"Zionsville, IN",7,15,1,1.0,9/26/2017,Sat for 10 minutes or so on the patio with three or four other tables. Over the course of those 10 minutes four servers walked past without acknowledging us. They couldn't be bothered. But don't fret! There is this great place next door where you are greeted with a smile and cold beer as soon as you get settled. It's called Bar Louie. Go there instead!!
Sahithya S.,"Columbus, IN",26,42,13,4.0,3/3/2017,"Nice ambience! Good service and the food was tasty. We ordered the Peruvian rice bowl and vegetarian pita taco. Light in calories and heavy in flavour.  The rice bowl was a little salty for me, but overall it was a tasty entree The pull apart monkey bread with vanilla bean ice cream is a must try."
Keshia C.,"Indianapolis, IN",79,96,186,4.0,12/4/2016,This place is a jewel.  Every time we head to the south side of town we make time to stop and eat at BJ's.  The restaurant is located just south of the mall in the same parking lot.  We have enjoyed both lunch and dinner.  We always have  a wonderful experience and the food is more than awesome.  This visit I decided to have the vegetable lentil soup and my husband had the wings and fries.  My soup was very flavorful and the bowl was plenty enough.  My husband said the wings were tasty and fries crisp.  The atmosphere is casual and very comfortable.  Every visit we have been  seated right away but it is a very busy restaurant with a fair amount of foot traffic.
Rob B.,"Madison Heights, MI",2,95,,4.0,10/31/2017,I was at BJ's October 7th - Good food - Had the double bone in pork chop. It was one of the best pieces of meat in a restaurant that I ever had. It was a wonderful meal. the others in my group had consistently good food. Its a favorite when in town. The call ahead seating is very helpful.
Emily G.,"Indian Shores, FL",0,15,,3.0,8/11/2017,"Food was great, but service was not. Waitress was sweet, but was very slow, she did not refill drinks often or check on us very often."
John D.,"Clayton, NC",5,2,,5.0,7/24/2017,"Great lunch location.  The food was excellent and the service was outstanding.  This was my first time here, and I wasn't sure what to expect.  I ordered a lunch combo, mini-pizza and soup. Considering how big the servings were, the price was great, only $8.25. The soup was very good. The pizza was a personal deep dish. It was wonderful. I really enjoyed the crust and the fresh toppings. Our waitress was very nice and helpful. I would recommend this restaurant enthusiastically."
Ted M.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,136,96,5.0,6/19/2016,"I was looking to eat healthy with my family. Salad with some protein. It was my last meal before going back to LA, so they let me choose a place to eat. Upon my research on Yelp, I saw BJ had seared Ahi Salad so I have this place a try.  I ordered clam chowder in a sourdough bread bowl, and it was delicious. Bread was nice and warm. Fresh tasting.  Then Ahi salad was good. Salad was fresh and Ahi tasted ok. Except it tasted like it was just defrosted, perhaps defrosted in microwave. The flavor of fish usually goes away if frozen. it takes more flavor if microwaved. And that Ahi tasted like that.  I ordered west coast IPA on tap. So delicious. Good stuff Everything else was good. I particularly satisfied with the server. She was a top notch. Speed, consistency to fill water, demeanor and language. She can probably work at five star hotel with no problem. Perhaps that was just Midwestern standard. Great work!"
Grove R.,"Greenwood, IN",0,139,,5.0,10/9/2016,"This is an update to my original review which I include here. Update-10.09.16-This restaurant continues to be first-class. They never say no. Service is always great and the food is really good. I also like the decor. One of the best places on the south side. Original review from May 2014-This was a lunch visit. They have great lunch specials. My wife had one that included a tomato and mozzarella salad and personal size pizza. She thought it was good, and at $6.75, it is a bargain.. I had the avocado egg rolls. Delicious!, just a little pricey at $10.25 for six.and too many for one person. They are meant to share. The space is very large and well decorated, with TV screens scattered around. Our server, Nicole C., was efficient and friendly. Will pay a return visit."
Stephanie B.,"Columbus, IN",46,75,44,5.0,11/5/2016,"Our waiter was Caleb. He was very nice and helped us right away! We got the Italian Market pizza and it was fabulous! Pepperoni, peppercionis, meatballs, cheese. Thin crust too! We shared it and were both full after dinner! Great deal :) I always love coming here. Its a nice place to hang with family or friends! Great music, great atmosphere! We will be back soon :)"
Julie G.,"Greenwood, IN",0,7,,1.0,10/14/2017,"Was very disappointed with our visit on a Saturday afternoon.  Server was slow to attend to us.  When we finally received our food, it was cold.  Not to mention they ran out of sweet potato fries so instead of giving a substitute they gave us a very small portion.  The entire meal was a bad experience."
Kinsey C.,"Indianapolis, IN",225,495,172,4.0,2/5/2016,"I usually tend to stay away from chains, but when in Greenwood do as the Greenwooders do! I will say this, is I have to choose a chain is be happy to come back here again. There is something for everyone, a low cal menu, unique brews, nice cocktail list and a delicious cookie cake type dessert. I enjoyed the Mediterranean chicken pita tacos which come highly recommended. The Brussels sprouts were unique, you gotta try 'em. The pizza had less than stellar reviews, so check out the expansive menu for something else that appeals to you! Despite being there on a busy Saturday afternoon for lunch, our service was quick and friendly. If you need a lunch break while at the mall, scoot on over to BJ's!"
Ryan F.,"Greenwood, IN",0,11,,1.0,6/10/2017,"Unfortunately, my experiences here continue to get worse each time I dine here.  Tonight I decided to do three (3) appetizers instead of a main entree.  The brussell sprouts were burnt and over crispy (e.g. the kitchen and/or the runner should not even have allowed this to leave the kitchen) the stuffed mushrooms were soggy and very small, and the ahi poke was missing two (2), poki sauce and avocado, of the six (6) basic ingredients.  A complete disaster of a meal.  The couple sitting next to me received the wrong entree because the waitress pushed the wrong button on the new automated ordering system they are using.  When even appetizers are a disaster it is time to move on to other dining options."
Shelia M.,"Greenwood, IN",0,14,12,5.0,6/9/2017,Lunch is my favorite time to eat here at this greenwood BJ's. Why? Because they have fabulous lunch specials!!! I pretty much always get the half California Chicken Club (yuuummm) then you get to pick a salad or soup.  Tortilla soup is awesome!! Then u can pick a side. It says it comes with fries but you can get a baked potato or veggies if u want instead. (No extra charge)!!! Definitely download the app!! They have offers on there all the time like a free appetizer with a food purchase. Plus I like to rack up points for money off my next visit.  This location is def 5 star in my opinion.
Ian B.,"Indianapolis, IN",247,271,803,4.0,12/22/2015,"Nice little pub in the heart of Effingham. Staff was very nice, courteous and always checking in. Building is older and outdated but that's just the kind of place this is. It's definitely not a fancy place but that's why the locals like it. Parking can get a little scarce when it gets busy so you might have to park on the street The food is mostly your standard pub food with Pizza, burgers and sandwiches. Not much for the health conscious here. Good flavor and quality but like I said just pub food and that's ok. Booze, decent selection. Better than most pubs in the area. Bottles and taps with some good specials through the week. Nice spot for groups, a ""let's grab a drink"" after work or the weekend hag out. I'm sure I'll be back."
Katie R.,"Indianapolis, IN",118,20,,5.0,1/15/2017,"I really didn't expect the menu to be as awesome as it was. The home made sodas were great, I got wild cherry. Our waiter was uncomfortably weird but that's more of a personality thing then general staffing. This is way more then just a burger place! Lettuce wraps, and Vietnamese like dishes! And they had a bunch of cider options! Definitely will come back!"
Mary K.,"Lebanon, IN",0,1,,3.0,5/18/2017,Do not get the prime rib sandwich. Very over priced and not good. Little to no meat and mostly bun. Truly awful.
Jeff L.,"Bloomington, IN",105,174,649,4.0,12/29/2015,"What do you want for dinner? I don't care.  What do you want? I don't care.  How about _____? No, that doesn't sound good.  Sound familiar? Welcome to my life.  The nice thing about BJ's is that, next to Cheesecake Factory, it has the biggest darn menu I've ever seen.  Steak, burger, pasta, pizza, chicken, vegetarian, soup, salad, you name it and BJ's has is.  The food, whatever you choose, is consistently good.  Sometimes the service is a bit slow, but it's mostly because it is a HUGE place and always crowded.  A few items of note: Pizza - deep dish - amazing.  From individual to large, it takes a bit longer but worth the wait.   Burgers - very very good. Lemon Chicken - delish Bread bowl soups - fantastic. If you're into the beer scene (think brewpub, not Budweiser) they have a full menu of in house brews.  And for the kids (or people like me who prefer the soda to the beer) they have their own root beer and cream soda on tap - both amazing, and as a bonus both come with free refills! For dessert, be sure to try the Pizooki which is a fancy name for cookie in a cup with ice cream on top.  But they sure are good!"
Tracy A.,"Indianapolis, IN",75,504,2717,4.0,11/2/2015,"This is a busy place in the hubub of Greenwood Mall.  Parking can be a pain depending on when you go. The decor and surroundings of the place are nice, and the menu is big offering a lot of choices whether it be beverages or food.  We were there on a Friday night.  Our server was friendly and efficient and patient with our group not being ready.  All of our food was good.  We had a roasted portobello and asparagus salad that I thought was delicious.  We also had the fish and chips which were ok.  Not the best I've had in the city but average.  For dessert, we tried BJ's Baked Beignet.  It was a generous dessert with strawberry topping, ice cream, and a mountain of whipped topping.  It was good for an option that was something fruity sweet as opposed to ooey gooey chocolate or caramel sweet.  I would definitely go again, as there are too many options we left untried."
Janet D.,"Indianapolis, IN",16,14,16,1.0,6/30/2017,"I had dinner there last night with a friend. I have to say this is the worst food I've had in a long time and I was genuinely shocked.  I've had appetizers there before but never a meal. The steak was shameful, barely lukewarm and completely devoid of any flavor - tasteless and unseasoned.  The ginger creamed corn sounded like a good idea but the ginger was way over the top, this dish still has some potential if they aren't so heavy-handed on the spice. It looked like a baked potato but a loaded baked potato is a far exaggeration.  The bacon was burned and the potato overcooked, no sour cream, chives or butter was on it and it appeared to be re-heated.  I requested butter, sour cream, etc after my meal came without it. If it's actually possible, the potato had no flavor & the cheese on it was quite waxy.  I had a cocktail, the Pink cadillac...also rather bland and nothing to write home about. Service was mediocre at best.  My waitress was pleasant but dry, not overly attentive and appeared to not be thrilled to be there.On a positive note, the ambiance is perfect!"
Sigrid W.,"Indianapolis, IN",107,285,3789,3.0,1/18/2015,"Seems to be a popular place with lots of folks waiting to get in. The interior is quite charming, the service is good, but i found the food and drinks to look fabulous and unfortunately taste only average. I ordered the strawberry splash which seems to be the signature drink here. It looked very pretty and taste pretty good, but i was either served a virgin drink or the whole thing was watered down quite a bit. I had the crispy chicken salad and while it looked great, it was more of a bland chop salad with some overly crisp chopped up chicken fingers on top. you can get that caliber in any fast food joint."
Mike S.,"Indianapolis, IN",59,119,40,4.0,12/30/2016,This place is growing on us.  Getting better each time we go.  The huge menu is tough to choose from.  We haven't had anything we didn't like yet.  Beer selection is adequate.
Mary Jane B.,"Indianapolis, IN",93,12,,5.0,2/25/2017,One of my favorite places to eat! All the food tastes amazing and they have awesome Service. Never a long wait for food. Last time I sat at the bar near the kitchen and it's obvious how efficient all of the servers and food Runners are
