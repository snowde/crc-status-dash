Iva H.,"Greenwood, IN",16,67,126,3.0,12/8/2013,Great stuffed mushroom appetizer. Burger were good and so was service. Beer was great-bloody Mary was so-so-not very flavorful.
Anita G.,"Indianapolis, IN",2,26,5,4.0,7/2/2014,"5 months ago I came here with people from work for the fist time and wrote a review, because of Shannon, our amazing server. I am happy Management read it, that means they are using this system which totally replaces stupid cards at the table that you can fill out, but never will. So I came back to this place for lunch the other day and we got seated again in Shannon's area, because I knew I would get great service again. Shannon isn't the kind of server though who greets you with a high pitch voice and gets all excited about it. She is professional, who most of the servers with high pitch voices aren't, and again, she is knowledgeable. She knows the food she sells, she can give you honest advice about certain meals and is just a professional, friendly, highly efficient server.  We ordered a salad with roasted brussel sprouts and they weren't really roasted. Tip for the kitchen: check out how the Barefoot Contessa does ""Roasted brussel sprouts"". Ever since I make them her way, my entire family eats brussel sprouts. Overall the salad was very good. The Moroccan inspired Salmon was good, but the Couscous wasn't real Couscous. They didn't use granules of durum wheat, which is the main ingredient in couscous, instead they used something different. Anyhow, the taste was good. As long as I get seated in Shannon's area again, I will be back for some more great service (hard to find these days) and good food."
Anne R.,"Eugene, OR",0,60,5,3.0,12/14/2015,"Our service was okay, waitress was very sweet and professional.  Food was okay, but nothing special.  Restaurant atmosphere was inviting.  Menu quite extensive, but not sure we'll be back to further explore.  Quality for the price wasn't much of a selling point.  Parking was a bit crowded, but it is connected to the mall so understandable."
Emma S.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,2,,4.0,11/25/2014,"Great food, reasonable prices, extensive menu, and friendly staff! We had fresh side salads (with mixed greens and fresh parmesan - yum), great flatbread pizza, and DELICIOUS greek chicken pita tacos. The house IPA was really impressive. $40 for two great meals and beers, including tip. My ONLY complaint and reason I did not give it 5 stars: they claim to be handicap accessible (which my dad needs), but do not have automatic/handicap doors. When I am pushing his wheelchair and there is nobody right nearby to hold the door for us, this presents a problem. Please add this amenity to your otherwise great restaurant!"
Matthew P.,"Indianapolis, IN",46,172,416,4.0,4/20/2013,"Since there is not much to choose from on the south side of Indy, this place gets a four.  Should I award points simply due to the lack of superior restaurants in the area?  Yes, I should.  Location, location, location.  BJ's has strategically placed themselves for success.   I don't normally support chain breweries, but I am making an exception for BJ's.  There beer is not bad, definitely above the average macro out there.  They also have several other micros on tap like Arrogant Bastard and Three Floyds to choose from.   The food is good...standard American mixed menu with classics such as country-fried steak, chicken parm., pizza's, etc.  The service, particularly at the bar, has always been decent."
Kara P.,"Greenwood, IN",31,142,34,4.0,9/12/2012,"Went to BJ's for date night with the hubs. Pretty positive experience overall. Despite being a 'brewhouse' the only thing they brew on site is their sodas. We were a little bummed to hear this, but the offerings on their beer list were enough to make a couple of microbrew lovers happy. So that's not a huge deal. We were informed that they were running a special that night, soup or salad for two, a pizza (large I think), and a desert for like $20 or $25. We were all over that. The pizza was pretty damn good. And the crazy Oreo desert was pretty delicious too, and I don't even like Oreos.  Service was great and the vibe inside this place is pretty cool too. Since it's at Greenwood Mall the parking situation is kind of a nightmare, but not enough to make me stay away."
Erin L.,"Columbus, IN",0,6,1,4.0,12/20/2014,"Food was excellent, staff was excellent, price was totally reasonable. I can't wait to take my husband! I think my only complaint is about the atmosphere... I can't quite put my finger on it... But it's certainly nothing that would keep me away. I wish I lived closer!"
Jeremy C.,"Chicago, IL",63,336,1,5.0,3/29/2012,"As a kid I'd watch cartoons and see characters stumble upon an oasis in the middle of the desert and most the time it was just an illusion.  While I was venturing though s&*#tiest state in the union, Indiana  I saw that oasis of BJ's reminding me of sunny beautiful socal. Turns out it was actually for real..  These midwestern idiots will line up their cars for blocks when a Sonic or Jack in a Box opens up. If you are from the west... you know those places are garbage that only homeless people eat at. BJ's on the other hand is the spot. Yea it's a chain... but they are all busy in California... all the time... the food is solid..  If you live near here... before you go to bed each night make sure you say a thank you prayer to god for delivering you a BJ's in your god forsaken state.  Sure the quality here wasn't as nice as say... BJ's on main street in HB... but hey... you're in Indiana for christ sake.  Eat here, update your resume, and get on career builder with ""90210"" in the search box.. You're welcome"
Brittany M.,"Greenwood, IN",1,1,,2.0,9/7/2015,"The food was actually fairly decent. Yesterday was our first visit,  and the service was so horrible that we will never be back. It took 20 minutes from the time we were seated to place our order, and it wasnt even busy. When the waiter brought our food, he slid it across the table, while he was nearly jogging past.  He never slowed or came back to check on us. I was very aggravated by the the meal was over. I was never asked if I wanted catsup for my fries, which by the way, I did. I also had an empty water glass, when he brought the sandwich,  which had jalapeños.  Water would have been appreciated. ...There was nobody nearby to flag down to retrieve our waiter.... He miraculously appeared to present the check. I didnt feel bad leaving a minimal  tip, normally I have a 5.00 minimum tip standard,  this guy should be grateful he got anything."
Jay S.,"Indianapolis, IN",20,37,14,5.0,7/4/2014,"Good food, prices and nice atmosphere! Good spot for night out! Had pork chops, 4of5...lacked seasoning. May want to call ahead...waited 10min for a table. Wouldn't mine another one in town..."
Scotty Z.,"Indianapolis, IN",23,124,2,2.0,11/19/2011,"Capitalist economies have a middle class; restaurants do too. Somebody's gotta be average. This place is somewhat analogous to a politician: you want to like them, they seem pretty decent, but when push comes to shove, there really isn't a whole lot of substance. I reeeeeally wanted to like this place....but even ""like"" would be too strong a word. My girlfriend and I each sampled some delicious beers...but they weren't extraordinary...nor cheap. We each split two dishes plus an appetizer. All of which were good...but again, very conservative flavors, dabbling on the dull side here and again. Nothing really stands out -- sort of like that politician, who doesn't want to take a chance on doing anything bold enough to jeopardize their chance come next November. I almost gave BJ's a third star, except for their beer sampler, which pissed me off. They have ~8 beers, ranging from dark to light. Their sampler is such that one may only sample the top 4, or the bottom 4. When I asked if an exception could be made (as, I was curious how they did both a lager and a red ale), our apathetic, bimbo server gave me some canned answer about ""that's just our policy."" And...not coming back again is just my policy. Policies are great...if you're the IRS. I will say -- the restaurant itself was gorgeous. Upscale, warm, classy, and inviting, it'd be a great place to kick back after work. The bar has plenty of room, and you won't be claustrophobic in the dining room either. All in all -- I'd like to recommend this place...I would... but down the street is both a Bravo and a Cheesecake Factory (one of my favorites), both of whom seem to work a little harder (both in the kitchen and the front of the house) for my money. If this adds any perspective...there's a Chili's across the parking lot...and I'd rather go there."
Becca B.,"Hope, IN",5,11,,5.0,7/18/2014,The food was super awesome! The chicken club was juicy and my dates steak was full of flavor.
Trena R.,"Indianapolis, IN",308,142,110,2.0,8/31/2011,"The beer is fabulous. Definitely the best part of the experience.  The setting is classy and beautiful.  I think we drew the short straw when it came to waitresses - she was a robot, but the others around us seemed warm and engaging. The pizza appetizer was the highlight of the meal (besides the beer) - a must-have! My chicken sandwich was surprisingly moist, although very mellow in taste compared to the ""green chilis and chipotle mayo"" description. The burger was among the worst ever. Cooked medium, it was so dry that it fell apart. The bun felt stale and rock hard.  But the beer was good!"
Nic J.,"Indianapolis, IN",69,175,61,3.0,9/29/2013,"Average. Food is average upscale-bar fare. Decent beer selection. I guess I would say their beers and selection are, well, average. I had a French dip sandwich and chili. Average. Wife had chicken ceasar salad. Average. Not bad, but many places I'd rather go."
Nat H.,"Indianapolis, IN",110,26,5,3.0,9/30/2014,"I am giving 3 stars because I have had better experiences here before, but let's talk about the last birthday we had.  It started out with me struggling to squeeze into the cramp space (and I'm pretty small person.) I usually sit at the bar which is more spacious, and as I learned, provides a higher level of service. I suppose the mood didn't start out so well when the waitress spilt water all over my sister and me. She didn't offer us towel; we were on our own to collect napkins around the table to dry our seats up. I guess she felt that calling us all 'sweetie' continually would make up for it. So we're waiting for the food, the kids trying to color but the crayons kept breaking. No big deal. Some had salads. The wrong salads were given to the wrong people which became complicated when it not was realized until after bites were taken. My aunt ordered rice and found a white piece of plastic like maybe part of a lid in it.  Good thing she's a nurse; she can give herself the Heimlich. Sadly, the food was just bad this night.  Ribeyes were tough and rubbery; not edible. Carrots had brown spots on them. Very thin asparagus and very stingy on the broccoli. One thing they were very generous with was lemons. Everything seemed to be garnished with lemons. My sister ordered the Maui Maui tacos, she couldn't find the Maui on it; lots of lettuce though. So it wasn't all bad - everyone who ordered a chicken dish seemed to be happy. I had the pesto mushrooms and fried artichoke which was pretty interesting.  I could have used a breath mint afterwards though. The desserts were unimpressive; the sundaes were mostly whipped cream.  It was okay; I've had worse, but I've had much better.  In the end though, the server literally stood over my chair until I paid the bill and then gave me one last condescending 'sweetie' for good measure."
Emily H.,"Greenwood, IN",5,6,1,4.0,11/17/2013,My favorite once a week hangout after work! Great apps and the best lemon drop I've ever had! Love the bar staff!!
Bruce H.,"Indianapolis, IN",5,46,52,2.0,8/14/2013,"This was my 3rd visit here. The food this time was well below par. 3 of 4 of us ordered a personal pizza and a wedge salad. The wedge salad was very small, as if they was running out of lettuce, all 3 salads would have made 1 salad at any other restaurant. Our pizzas were just as skimpy, they had bare minimum toppings. Seemed like they made a decision to cut back on portions. Very disappointed this trip. The others were from out of town and was not impressed either."
Kristy R.,"Indianapolis, IN",39,98,17,1.0,8/30/2013,Horrible service sat outside for a half hr and this older couple were sitting out there longer than us... No drinks no no nothing. And when told about the issue they didn't even care...
Jason O.,"Greenwood, IN",101,411,454,2.0,1/21/2013,"We stopped here for a Monday night dinner.  The place has nice high ceilings and looks nice.  It was pretty slow which makes sense cause it's a Monday.  But the service was also very slow which was unexpected and unwelcome.  Man it took a long time to get our food....  I asked the waiter what was going on ""Short on staff tonight"" I asked, and he replied with a shrug of the shoulders as he walked by.  Finally the manager brought the food and apologized for the delay and admitted it was way too long.  A quick sorry and he was gone.  The food was good, not great, and the variety is very great.  But service and timely delivery of food is very important."
Holly G.,"Greenwood, IN",2,7,,4.0,6/13/2013,Great place for dinner after a long day of shopping. Relax in the outdoor sitting area and sip on a beer. You can also sit inside at the large bar and watch a ball game! Great pizza and flat bread!
