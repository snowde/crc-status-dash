Chris D.,"Spokane, WA",29,166,31,4.0,10/3/2013,"I know this is a chain restaurant, but with specials like $3.50 micros, $6 delicious mini deep dish pizzas, and amazing service how can you give it any less than 4 stars. They went above and beyond so i gave them above average chain scores."
Matt S.,"Indianapolis, IN",3,32,,2.0,10/12/2010,"With each visit to BJ's I'm less impressed. I've been three times now and have been disappointed by the complete lack of healthy options. I wouldn't normally promote salads but BJ's has a Mexican inspired salad that is pretty good if you order it without the onions (if you forget to go sans onions, they put nearly an entire onion on the salad). Really, I keep ordering the salad because nothing is good enough to get me to eat that many calories. And believe me, I'm not afraid to eat an unhealthy meal if it is going to be worth it. I will say that the service is very good, but I've always experienced a long weight. Do yourself a favor and skip BJ's, it is really just a slightly better version of the standard cookie cutter Applebees type restaurants."
Kelli W.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,3,,1.0,9/12/2014,"I'll start with the good news. The food was decent. The bad news: service was awful. We saw our server a total of three times. It took us a half hour to get our order in and then ANOTHER HOUR to get our food. We got in the restaurant early tonight when it wasn't busy and more than ten tables who came in after us got their food before us. We had a 2 year old and a 6 month old with us and they were at their wits end when we asked about our food. The excuse we heard was that ""the sandwich line is backed up"". We talked to a manager, and all they offered was free desert. We had two fussy kids and were not about to wait another hour for dessert. We had two bills and they took the appetizer off of one and did not adjust the other one at all. This was unacceptable and we will not be going back."
Rachael S.,"Greenwood, IN",0,18,,1.0,8/31/2014,"The food  here is typically way overpriced for the quality you receive. i think the fact that this place has so many options makes it difficult for the cooks to know how to prepare everything properly. Every time I've gone it's been extremely hit or miss, with the last handful of times being definite misses. I went once when it was somewhat busy, and I had to send my steak back because it wasn't cooked properly. When the waiter brought me a new one (after everyone else at my table had finished their meals, of course), he sat it in front of me and without saying a word, walked away. The steak still wasn't cooked right but I just wanted to leave at that point. Then last night while being seated the hostess had her phone in her hand/was using her phone the entire time she was working, and our waitress seemed to care less about us as soon as we got our meals. This place desperately needs a management overhaul. I've never seen so many employees doing so little at once. If you want to pay this much money for your food, do yourself a favor and go somewhere actually nice that isn't attached to the mall."
Geoff W.,"Greenwood, IN",1,1,,5.0,3/3/2014,This is a great place to eat!! Great atmosphere and friendly staff! Not much of a beer drinker but my friends that I have gone with say they have excellent in house brews!
Tristan S.,"Indianapolis, IN",324,173,58,5.0,8/7/2010,"I don't give chains 5 stars. Unless the food and service are extremely reliable. My family and I have been to this location numerous times and haven't yet had a negative experience. Sure, some of the servers seem to be getting their sea legs. Sure, the place is huge and filled with mall people. But the food - especially the avocado rolls, shrimp wraps and pizza - is spot-on every time. And the beer ain't too shabby, either. They have their own brews, and also Stone IPA on draft. That's an immediate positive bump of one star. For being so big, the place is actually quite comfortable and appealing. It's not too loud. And even though it's attached to one of the most soul-sucking shopping centers on earth, we still visit regularly to feast upon greasy, delicious pub food."
D W.,"Greenwood, IN",8,65,1,1.0,6/25/2011,"I would give it 0 stars if I could... I'm thoroughly appalled that the website is worthless.  It alone has completely ruined my experience with the establishment.  I will not be returning anytime soon, nor will I ever waste my time using their website.   First the grilled chicken pasta dish, is listed for $12.75, yet when one attempts to add it to their cart, you are forced to add the chicken for another $3.00?!?  Please explain that wonderful gem.   Next it is NEVER listed ANYWHERE, that the burgers INCLUDE lettuce, tomato, and pickle.  Sorry, SHREDDED LETTUCE, who the hell uses that?  Let me tell you, the fast-food industry use shredded lettuce, not reputable restaurants, because when it wilts it smells like rotting garbage.  I was able to scrape all of the crap from my burger to make it edible, but sadly it did not leave it palatable. Please save yourself any potential misery and avoid BJ's Brewhouse."
Elise L.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,5,4,5.0,10/20/2013,"We had a GREAT first experience at BJ's this weekend. We were told by friends that it was a great place for some deep dish pizza. We decided to give it a shot and it was WONDERFUL!!! Service was awesome even though it was a busy night. We had their 2 for $20 deal with a each of us getting soup/salad, a medium gourmet meat deep dish pizza, and then a shared dessert of the the pizooki (sp?... basically a pizza cookie that may possibly have been one of the best desserts I've ever had). Needless to say, we had MORE than enough to eat and only at half the pizza there, so we got some awesome leftovers. Definitely should check this place out! Their menu is beyond giant with something to please everyone - everything from italian to salads to burgers. We will definitely be back!"
Libbie V.,"Indianapolis, IN",207,179,327,3.0,3/19/2013,"BJ's is just ok. Decent food. Huge menu. Their own brewery draft beer selections are ok but definitely not great. Their ""guest"" draft beer selections are better. The prices for their beers and food items are way too high - I think everything could be lowered $2+. But, the place is nice inside, for a chain, and it's huge and the service is nothing to complain about. We did have a pizza there one night that was really good. The rest of the menu that we've sampled has been ehhh, ok. Probably the only reason we've been here more than once is because it's right by the Greenwood Mall and its accommodating for larger parties."
James B.,"Mooresville, IN",0,16,4,3.0,1/15/2015,"Normally awesome. Hair in son's pizza. Some foreign object in the mayonnaise. Changed mayonnaise,  I think to Kraft or off name brand. Funky taste to it. Hamburger was flavorless and dry.  Manager was great."
Carrie D.,"Boggstown, IN",0,2,1,1.0,10/31/2013,Stopped in to try something new and was sorry to say I was unimpressed and dissapointed. I had the chicken tuscan limone and Ron had the jambalaya. The portions were generous but the flavor was unremarkable.  We had a glass of house wine and a margaretta and our bar tab was $17. A bit over priced for the product received. We probably will not be back.
B F.,"Indianapolis, IN",138,13,2,5.0,6/27/2013,"Love the service, atmosphere, pizza, avocado egg roles, Santa Fe appetizer, and Santa Fe salad. I come here whenever I'm in the area."
Carl S.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,39,,1.0,3/29/2015,"visited 29 March 2015, Party of 7. on a Sunday. was told party would have to wait 40 minutes with a height chair would be at the mercy of more tables opening, 40 minutes later 15 leaving and à different 7 party in front of us that that wasn't there when we got there. left hungry and ended up going to Burger King. will never go again."
allison s.,"Greenwood, IN",129,326,158,3.0,9/15/2008,"Decent place if you are in the mall and don't want any of the other 20 places to eat at... The food is usually good, the service has been slow the last 3 times we have been there.  They have home brewed root beer and black cherry soda along with a full beer selection"
Chris B.,"Fort Mill, SC",39,71,11,4.0,8/25/2010,"Decided to visit this place while in Indy visiting family. The place kinda has a chain restaurant feel, but not nearly as annoying as some. The place is big and open, with lots of TV's adorning the walls. Seems very family friendly The service was pretty good, the waiter we had was right on top of everything. He definately made sure that when our beers started getting low, he was there to ask if we wanted another. Quick, timely, friendly service. It helps that we were there with my brother who appears to be a regular, or at least he knows this particular waiter. The food was actually pretty good, we got the deep dish pizza, and it was much better than I expected. We also got the pazooki for dessert, and it was terrific. The variety of menu items was very nice too, lots of options for everyone. The beer was much better than I expected, my wife got a sampler of all 7 of thier offerings (excluding the IPA), so I got to try each of them. Good stuff, The Pirhanna Pale Ale is particularly good. I got a pint of the Kolsch (really good), the IPA (Very good, but not quite as good as the Pale Ale), and the Imperial Stout (Pretty good).I was fairly impressed overall. The only let down is that they don't brew thier beers on site. That kind of made this more like a visit to any other chain restaurant, rather than a brew pub."
Carrie B.,"Valparaiso, IN",20,11,,3.0,6/28/2010,"I was doing some shopping at Greenwood mall and BJ's was a convenient option for dinner.   I had the California Burger.  The burger was tasty, however, it was served on sourdough bread which made it very messy to eat.   The service was fine.  I was dining alone and I find that you either get a server who ignores you or is in your face.  This particular night, the server was in my face.  The best part was the fresh to go cup of iced tea she brought me when I was getting ready to leave."
Molly W.,"Brownsburg, IN",9,85,,3.0,1/3/2012,"Let's be honest. BJ's isn't one of those places you visit to get the most amazing meal ever. But it is a nice stand-by when you want some basic American food or pizza. And if you do end up there and want a non-alcoholic drink, make sure to try their strawberry lemonade (and then ask for a to-go cup at the end of your meal)."
Kjirsten K.,"Indianapolis, IN",129,215,21,3.0,11/19/2011,"Mediocre over-priced food.  Beer selection is good, but also over-priced.   I enjoyed BJ's own Piranha pale ale.  It's nicely hopped and actually better than the IPA.  They had some good guest taps, but be prepared to dish out the dough.  A pint of Stone is  $6.50.   This restaurant feels very similar to the Cheesecake Factory and although I didn't see anything about the restaurants being owned by the same company on their website, I wouldn't be surprised to learn there is a connection between the two restaurant chains.  The large spiral bound menus and decor are so similar, you can switch out the glass case of cheesecakes for a bar serving BJ beer and basically have the same restaurant.   This place has something for everyone, but I wasn't blown away by the food.  The pizza is good, but I like more sauce.  It was kind of dry in my opinion.  I did appreciate the whole grain pizza crust, making one of my favorite dishes slightly more healthy.  A deep dish, mini veggie pizza is on their ""light"" menu.  I can get behind that."
Joel F.,"Indianapolis, IN",102,274,19,1.0,12/21/2013,"What's sad is that this place is usually great, but tonight it was far from what I've come to expect. We arrived around 11:10pm, and after about a 1 minute wait, we were greeted and seated by what appeared to be the manager. We were told to sit anywhere we would like in the bar area and he would follow with menus. When we were seated he said that our server would be right over. He then proceeded to sit at the table right behind us to hang out with what appeared to be his friends. 10 minutes later we still had not seen or heard from our server and the manager who was STILL sitting at the table behind us never said or did anything. We waited another minute and then left. As we were walking out surprisingly our server appeared and said hi to us. We responded that we waited 10 minutes and were leaving. Her response was ""my apologies"". Again, the manager never said or did anything. Usually I've had great service from this location in the past, but apparently if you go in after 11pm (they close at 12am) you're not a valued customer and they'll get to you when they feel like it."
Rob S.,"Monrovia, IN",6,6,,5.0,8/8/2014,"Huge menu selection that fits everyone's appetite.  Service was great, portions huge, and price was great.  A great place to take out of town guests since the menu has everything."
