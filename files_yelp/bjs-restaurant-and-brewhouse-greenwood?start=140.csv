Matt S.,"Seymour, IN",3,2,,4.0,8/6/2012,Good beer. Good food. A little pricey but not enough to stay away. Awesome menu selection and the staff was prompt and spot on. Schveet.
Beth W.,"Huntington, IN",47,34,1,4.0,5/22/2012,"First time at BJ's - was a little shocked at the prices. Salad's were 11 bucks...but they are worth it! The BJ's Cobb Salad is awesome! I love how they have the option or all ready came with avocado which is super yummy! The atmosphere is very interesting, and the wait staff was decent. I would go back!"
Glenn W.,"Dayton, OH",26,76,21,4.0,1/9/2012,"I know that BJ's is a national chain, but that doesn't mean it isn't good. Their beers are pretty solid and they have a great selection of draft beer. Their pizza is great. I was really surprised how light the crust was. Great place to grab a beer and pizza."
Andrew M.,"Bargersville, IN",7,26,,2.0,5/3/2011,"This place has really gone down hill.  The food was mediocre, the portions have shrunk, and the prices have been jacked up.  If it wasn't for a great waitress I would give one star."
Randy B.,"Bargersville, IN",20,359,6,5.0,11/14/2011,"Love this place, good beer, floats, and great pot roast. I never get dessert, but the pizzuki's are amazing.  Everyone in my family loves this place."
Brenda H.,"Fremont, CA",45,543,13,4.0,9/20/2010,"i never had their mediterrean pizza.  we ordered it to go on a nice saturday night.  i did request that they put no chicken and no cheese on 1/2 of the pizza.   we got it and the crust was thick and fluffy.  wow, it was yummy.   you do get less one star because i know how (not) healthy you are.  but yes, if you have a pizza craving and you want to satisfy it... i have a new found respect for BJ's... the pizza not the #*($_(@.  :)"
Mark J.,"Indianapolis, IN",6,35,,4.0,7/25/2008,"The unfortunately-named BJs is actually a really nice family restaurant.  Its location right next to the mall makes it the perfect place to stop when you're out shopping and want something nicer than the Chinese place in the food court.  It's also fairly inexpensive for how nice it is, a plate of food and drink clocking in at under $15 a person.  If you can get everyone to agree and share a pizza, you can get away with less than $10 each.   It's a microbrewery, and they have a spectrum-covering selection ranging from a cloy wheat beer to an imperial stout that drinks like cement.  Their brown ale is particularly interesting, being extra hoppy; a separation from the usual, English style of that type of beer. The bathrooms are clean, the service is entirely dependant on who you get.  The place is new (May 2008) and feels new.  It's a classy and relatively inexpensive place.  The collection of stores around the mall are really going up in scale, and this place helps that atmosphere nicely."
T. J.,"Greenwood, IN",8,94,528,4.0,4/17/2011,"Good beer! Good Service! Good Food! This resturant brews its own beers, very good! They have very good salads, appetizers. The dishes are also good but a little pricey for the meal you get. I would recommend trying this resturant."
Jeff F.,"Greenwood, IN",0,5,5,4.0,9/2/2011,"This ia a great place for people looking for a good beer...  There are many to choose from.  BJs is always first on my list for good casual dining with a family ambience infused with a sport bar atmosphere.  The food is really good with many options in the menu.  They have incredible pizza and calzones.  Being a vegitarian I am particularly fond of their giant veggie burger.  If you are looking for a great place to dine, or a mellow bar like atmosphere, this is the place to come."
Ryan B.,"Bloomington, IN",3,77,1,5.0,1/24/2011,"II used to go to BJ's in California all the time, and was bummed when I first moved back here because there wasn't one. Now there is, and it is so awesome!!! Yes it's a big chain restaurant, but they have amazing food and some great beer. They have some of the best pizza I have ever eaten, and I've eaten alot of pizza!!! Deep dish, and great quality ingredients. They also have some great beer! The Tatonka stout is my favorite! Also the Piranha pale ale. Tastes like a slightly more hoppy version of Sierra Nevada. The nutty brewnette is good also. Didn't care for the Irish Red."
Carey D.,"Greenville, OH",89,316,429,3.0,10/20/2008,"Eh, this is alright, but not at the top of my list of places to go when I'm in Greenwood -- there are other better dining options right at the mall.  The atmosphere was nice enough, but the service was so-so and I didn't really care for my meal. I had a vegetarian pasta dish -- it had lots of great ingredients listed in the description, and you would think if it was simply pasta tossed with a little olive oil, veggies and cheese that they would put enough veggies and cheese on it to make it worth your while, right? Well they didn't -- it was a very boring, bland dish. Not satisfying at all. I will probably go back, but I won't order any of the pasta selections. My boyfriend had one of their pizzas and liked it much better. The beer wasn't bad, but wasn't that memorable either.  BJ's is a chain with locations in 15 states, and in this case, I think it shows -- seems pretty generic to me. It's not terrible, just doesn't offer anything too distinctive."
Chris H.,"Brownsburg, IN",13,34,7,4.0,2/25/2011,"Good lunch specials, they have small individual appetizers for 2.95 that are great, pizza is awesome! Huge menu lots of good stuff for a chain restaurant. I can't wait to come back for more deep dish pizza.  Had a lite beer, it was good although I'm not a fan of microbrew I am always willing to give it a shot!"
Scott M.,"Denver, CO",2,36,,1.0,6/24/2010,This looks and feels like a cardboard chain. It is a great example of how lots of money can make a really dull restaurant.  Sickeningly average. You can make better food at home and you can buy much better beer for the same price.  Don't waste your time.
Jennifer L.,"San Antonio, TX",54,300,178,3.0,8/17/2008,"This place brews its own beer, but it's more like Miller Lite than the craft beer you can get at a lot of places in Indy. My porter was a bit flat and flavorless. Rock Bottom brews stronger, more full-bodied and flavorful beer. The food isn't too bad--we had an appetizer pizza that boasted basil, tomatoes and sausage, but the latter was M.I.A. The chicken lettuce wraps could have benefited from more finely chopped chicken.  This place isn't all bad; the hefeweizen is pretty good. So are the big screens above the bar, if you're going to watch a game."
Andrew S.,"Deerfield, IL",58,223,16,3.0,7/14/2010,I went here with a friend because of a $50 gift card. The food was good. I got the home brewed root beer which was pretty good. The service was average. Nothing to brag or complain about. It's at the Greenwood Park Mall on the outside of the North side of the mall.
Byron J.,"Denver, CO",26,147,108,3.0,7/29/2008,"Here is a rare occurrence, me dining on the south side...perhaps this will have to change? We went to BJ's more out of convenience than anything. We were at the mall in Greenwood and BJ's was close by. Never one to pass the opportunity to try a new restaurant we put our name on the list. We were quoted an hour, speaking of rare occurrences, me waiting an hour for a table is a gasper, at any rate, we got our table as quoted, an hour later. Interestingly the hostess marked us down as a party of nine, since there were only two of us the manager accommodated us with a complementary appetizer since he figured we waited 25 minutes longer than we needed to. Cool deal! We got our table and decided that we like the atmosphere, it is rather unique, not really a sports bar, not really high class, but certainly not a dive, it was nice...relaxing really. Our server was very nice, her name was Ashleigh, very good at her job, not pushy or overbearing and not aloof and inattentive, just right. I decided to try the featured bear, the ""Nit Wit"" a Wit beer, which I really did not care for, it was a little...sour, I guess is the word I would use, not really the style wheat beer I am used to. I switched to the Hefeweizen which was passable, but forgettable. Next time I will probably go for something heavier. We enjoyed the food, though certainly not multi-star material. It was acceptable. We were hoping to get the ""Together at Last"" appetizer a combo of bruschetta and spinach dip, two of our favorites on one plate, but regrettably they were out of the bruschetta so we opted for the spinach dip singled out. It was good, I particularly liked the toasted Parmesan cheese on top, though again, not the best I have ever had. For dinner my companion ordered fish and chips, which is a staple for her. It was one of the best fish and chips dishes we have sampled in recent memory, though I only had a bite or two, I think I would consider ordering it again. My dinner was a turkey burger ""classic style"" (1,000 island dressing, Lettuce, Tomato, on a toasted Brioche) the patty was kinda thin which left me wanting more turkey burger flavor, but over all it was OK. I doubt I will ever order a burger there again, and I look forward to going back for some of the signature pizza. Over all I was pleased with this restaurant. It does not get any awards from me, other than maybe service and hospitality, but I'll go back, after a try a little bit more of what Greenwood has to offer. Though it took me six years to have dinner in Greenwood, I hope to get back much quicker the next time."
Dan R.,"Greenwood, IN",0,5,,4.0,3/5/2010,"This place should have a higher rating in my opinion. They have a huge menu with a ton of options. Their pizza is really good. And they have a good assortment of beers to offer. If you get their weakest beer on the menu you won't be impressed, you will need to select one that is stronger. My only complaint is the prices seems a little on the high side. I think the prices have to be set a little high to pay for the massive amount of staff they have working there. Always seems like you see 5 to 8 workers just standing around. Overall it is one of the better places to dine on the south side."
Monty D.,"Greenwood, IN",1,13,,4.0,5/29/2011,"Went to lunch on a Saturday afternoon. We had the lettuce wraps for an appetiser, very good. The server was very friendly and polite. They have a nice deck, but unfortunatly it was raining. The meal was very tasty and we will be back soon."
Kathy H.,"Indianapolis, IN",1,4,1,5.0,5/24/2010,My husband and I love this place.  Our meals have always been good and we love the atmosphere.  If you have room or just feel like dessert the brownie ala mode is worth the trip in itself.
