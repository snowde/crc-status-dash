Ross H.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,21,10,3.0,8/13/2016,AvOcado egg roll and their signature orange cream soda best egg roll ever.   Best restaurant ever.  Come down and see bartender Jobi
Chris P.,"Stockton, CA",72,112,149,5.0,7/30/2015,Handcrafted Rootbeer is awesome! We love the thin crust pizzas here. Service is always fast and friendly. The menu has something for everyone and even has Gluten-Free options. ;-)  We ordered the fried calamari for an appetizer. It was cooked perfectly.  I highly recommend this location!
Jason V.,"Indianapolis, IN",8,2,,5.0,7/9/2016,"An amazing experience.  Great service from all staff members.  I went to BJs with my wife, my seven year old son, and my two year old son.  It is very nice, yet very rare to go restaurant and have an enjoyable time due to having young children. On this visit our children behaved wonderfully due in part to our waitress, Brandi B. As far as the food goes, it was great.  My son and I enjoyed the house salad.  Baby back ribs were meaty and the taste was top notch."
Radha T.,"Greenwood, IN",18,32,41,3.0,8/1/2016,"This place has a nice interior and vibe to it. Great beer selection including local craft beers. The place boasted about their deep dish pizza. Being a Chicago native I had low expectations, but this pizza was just terrible! I'm not sure why they call it deep dish as it's nothing like real deep dish pizza. If anything it is more like a pan pizza. Go for the beer but not the pizza"
T M.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,15,,3.0,1/22/2017,"Nothing wrong here, except it was overpriced. Food was fine, as was the service, but nothing was amazing or special. The Hefeweizen was alright, not great. Root beer wasn't bad. If you want a nice experience, you could go elsewhere, but this was safe, average overpriced fare."
Nancy D.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,12,,3.0,6/28/2017,Food is good.  Pop (cola) is terrible.  I don't order pop there.  Root beer is good.
Janie J.,"Greenwood, IN",0,18,,2.0,5/5/2017,"Bj's could be good, they have a good menu however the cooks they employ are not consistent and just don't put forth an effort to do a decent job.  You might get a dish one time that is ok, but don't expect it twice in a row.  Wanted to really enjoy this place, but it just keeps getting worse"
paul s.,"Columbus, IN",31,31,25,4.0,1/27/2016,Hickory Brisket & Bacon ... wait for it .......... Bison Burger! I had never been so happy to be a meatasaurus again this way. My whole body applauded my choice. Fried Artichokes for apps! Great night with me and my squeeze!
Unhappy G.,"Bloomington, IN",37,3,,1.0,6/12/2017,Tourist trap for people who want the feel of craft beer but actually want Budweiser. Food made me queasy. Much better places to eat. Basically applebees with a slightly better beer selection.
Aj H.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,1,,5.0,5/26/2017,Jus had ah wonderful meal with my wife and it was amazing definitely will be recommending this to everyone i know
Nicole H.,"Indianapolis, IN",203,264,2047,4.0,4/5/2015,"It's rather pricey, but what else can you expect from a mall restaurant. However, the dishes are quite tasty. I got a lunch item off the low calorie menu - a chicken pesto sandwich with four cheese mashed potatoes and it was good! The potatoes were very cheesy and actually kinda intense, but I liked them. The sandwich was...it was good! But probably not worth the cost. It was about $9 and the bread had been oiled and grilled so it was flavorful but all I could think was how unhealthy it was. Could have used more pesto. Overall tasty. My dining partner really enjoyed his sandwich and apparently their pizzas are great."
Jyoti B.,"Fullerton, CA",1,3,,4.0,4/5/2016,"Often go there for lunches and dinners with family , friends or just myself.  Huge menu Decent food Great service Kids friendly Tortilla soup rocks I don't particularly enjoy their pizzas But salads are amazing! Must try the Santa fee chicken salad Mushroom app is amazing The framboise is a delicious yet fruity beer to try Love the fact that I can get something based on my mood here."
Jeremy S.,"Greenwood, IN",0,10,18,4.0,4/30/2017,"Great food. Bad design for seating in both in bar and restaurant. Plan to have great food and drinks, but get bumped around do to cramped quarters."
Jake A.,"Carmel, IN",248,2,,4.0,10/10/2016,"Hannah was ALL. OVER. IT. Broad selection of light, fresh, forward-thinking dishes. Maybe just a TAD on the pricey side, but - overall - definitely worth a try."
Gunny C.,"Nineveh, IN",22,6,2,5.0,3/29/2016,"Huge Menu  Great food, Great Service! Greeted Immediately  Drinks 6min Appitizer 20min Food 41 min Food was hot, fresh & delicious! Great tea selections! David H. was our server & was exceptional, professional & offered different types of wines & alcohol. Definitely worth the time to dine here. Great atmosphere... music wasn't too loud! Will definitely come back again!"
Amanda B.,"Greenwood, IN",44,125,10,3.0,12/16/2015,"meh. The food can be good, but it all depends on if you're lucky or not. My husband ordered fish tacos and said they tasted like cheap fish sticks.  Aside from the questionable choice of fish tacos, I've had some hit or miss meals there too. For example, the chopped barbecue salad doesn't suck.  The service is also hit or miss...so basically, it's a crap shoot on if it will be a good night or not. Best to avoid if it's busy, as luck and service will NOT be on your side. But on a slow day or an off time, you could probably eat a decent meal and not hate yourself for giving them money."
Anastasia H.,"San Antonio, TX",179,287,165,5.0,12/27/2015,Thank you thank you for being open later on Christmas Eve. Mackenzie was very kind and chipper even after a long day. I tried the clan chowder in the bread bowl and it was Delish- only downside is the price doesn't include the bread bowl( bowl of soup for $8?!?). My hubs tried a salad that was full of goodies :) with a menu as big as theirs and being a chain it won't be my first place to go back to but would be willing if someone invited
D C.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,12,,2.0,3/24/2017,"Frequented this location several times and usually decent service. Last visit however was terrible. I was there with my fiance - we both state our orders at the same time along with ordering an appetizer to split. Appetizer comes out fairly quickly, but then a good 30-40 minute wait before the server shows up with the fiance's entree. We inquire about the second entree and was told it would be right out. A good 15 minutes later, the second entree comes out....COLD! Server basically disappears for a good 10 minutes (he had literally only two tables filled in his section) - when he returns, I mention that I would like my meal remade since it was brought to me cold. He said it would be fixed and a few minutes later the manager walks over. All he would offer is to basically microwave my dish - no option for it to be remade or something else. After expressing interest in wanting it remade and the manager failing to see my point, I finally agree. My dish is brought out about five minutes later - biting into it, the pasta is now dried out and there's little sauce left from the microwave. Server disappears until he drops off the check and essentially shrugs after I state that I was unhappy with my meal."
Ken M.,"Morgantown, IN",0,4,,1.0,8/14/2016,Worst experience in a long time.   After an overpriced underwhelming meal we waited 30 minutes for dessert. My only hope is that our friendly and apologetic  server can get a job at whatever replaces this dump when it's out of business.
Ron S.,"Greenwood, IN",86,52,9,4.0,4/24/2016,BJ'S Greenwood is a beautiful setting. We went there a couple of weeks ago. It was a regular night and the place was not too crowded. We got sat down right away. I ordered Hefeweizen and it was really good. We tried the crispy calamari in appetizers and it was good as well. The Entree was OK but they have a huge menu and i will go there some other time and order something else. Overall its a nice place go try it.
