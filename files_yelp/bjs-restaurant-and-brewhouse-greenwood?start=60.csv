Laurel R.,"Indianapolis, IN",3,54,1,4.0,4/30/2016,"Wonderful food, but a bit chilly.  As always, the food and service at the location near the Greenwood Mall were very good, but apparently the outside patio heaters had not been repaired and it was a bit chilly last evening.  The server asked to have them turned on, assuming they worked as one ""out front"" did, and the manager came over to inform that he had sent out asking for bids to repair.  It is odd that all three would not be functioning and we were not offered indoor seating.  I had to ask the waitress for extra cloth napkins to keep my ankles warm!   Sooooo - patrons should be alerted if equipment does not work and there is no excuse for all three heaters not working -- it is not as though chilly evenings were an unexpected occurrence this time of year. Hubby had a burger and I had the salmon - both very good and service was great....we just ate in hurry and left as we were shivering."
Courtney T.,"Greenwood, IN",180,259,104,4.0,6/19/2015,"This place is always busy and I've never really been a fan. I have renewed interest in this place.  The menu is overwhelming.   Seemingly, they've updated it and it's still overwhelming...to many pages..to many options.   They do have something for everyone.   The have lighter options and well deep dish pizza and everything in between.  I was here on a Friday night recently with some friends.  Our waiter was ok on attentiveness...I did go a while without a drink in front of me.  The food was better than I remembered.  The appetizers were shareable with a group of 5 and were delish.  We got a flat bread of some kind(i didn't order) but it had bacon on it...who doesn't love bacon?!!?  I got a chicken, black bean bowl that was super tender and flavorful.   No room for dessert but it looked like it could be trouble."
Chad M.,"Apollo Beach, Tampa Bay, FL",4029,809,10634,3.0,4/20/2015,"As expected from a restaurant and pub, food was good, kind of expensive, but you pay for the atmosphere i suppose, good place to hang out with friends, drink, eat, and be merry, especially after a long day on walking the mall that its attached too."
Zach Z.,"Oswego, IL",150,168,5,4.0,6/13/2015,Check this place out!  The interior is well decorated and it is good for lunch or dinner.  It would be fun to take the family here or just come for some adult beverages with your honey or some friends.   I had the pizza and it was awwwesome.  Reasonably priced and a good ambiance.   Seriously worth a look!
Amanda H.,"Indianapolis, IN",76,38,29,3.0,2/5/2016,Visited BJ's last weekend on a rare trip to Greenwood with some friends. I will say the environment and service were great. They have an expansive menu and plenty of drink choices. My friends enjoyed what they choose for lunch. I gave a mini deep dish pizza a try because it was too hard to choose from the menu. The pizza was good but honestly not much better than a pan pizza from Pizza Hut. They also put tomatoes on their pizzas standard. I didn't enjoy the fact that they were large and didn't have a  good taste. If I ever make it back down I will give BJs and a different meal another try.
Ayla W.,"Indianapolis, IN",22,121,106,4.0,2/14/2015,Came to BJ's for an employee lunch and it makes my second time here. The first time at BJs I did not have a great experience. However they redeemed themselves by giving me my meal free. This second time the roast beef dip sandwich was wonderful. I'm a spice person and my only thing was I wish there was a little spicy hint to it. But BJs atmosphere is very nice and I enjoy it. If you go for your bday they give you free ice cream and a cookie. But they don't sing happy birthday. You should try it. I do not recommend the pizza.
Donna H.,"San Antonio, TX",126,200,33,4.0,1/6/2015,"Love BJ's! We went to the one in Indianapolis recently. I had and loved both of these items: Ahi Poke* Chopped sashimi-grade ahi and green and yellow onions are marinated in our signature poke sauce. Topped with diced avocados and served with crispy wonton chips. Golden Beet and Arugula Diced golden beets, arugula and red onions tossed in strawberry goat cheese vinaigrette and topped with goat cheese, toasted almonds and dried cranberries. The service was outstanding!"
Heather B.,"Indy Metro, Indianapolis, IN",9,29,11,3.0,3/4/2015,"Not impressed. My boyfriend had the deep dish lasagna, he only ate 3 bites. He said it should've been called baked ravioli, way too much cheese.  I had the chicken, supposedly the most ordered item on the menu. My biggest complaint about the dish was the chicken nugget type chicken they used. Why do restaurants that charge these prices for their food try to get away with serving subpar quality. I would expect this type of Applebee's type chicken crap if the dish was under $10. But for over $13, I expect real chicken breast. Screw me, right? I gave 3 stars for the corn fritters and the tomato mozzarella salad. Both very tasty."
Brayden C.,"Columbus, IN",0,6,13,5.0,7/24/2015,"Not once have I come into bj's and had bad service, bad food or a bad experience. Every waiter and waitress provides prompt and courteous service. I am very pleased every time I leave, which is why I keep coming back."
Aja B.,"Indianapolis, IN",56,16,1,2.0,10/21/2016,"Came in after work to grab a growler of cider to take home. When you walk in, there is an area where you can place and pick up to go orders. The chalkboard in this area shows the growler choices and prices, thus making it seem to someone that this is where you might order such a  thing.  This is actually not the case. So I made my way to the bar where I stood for over 5 minutes before someone acknowledged me (it was 4pm...nowhere near a dinner rush). While I stood waiting for someone to wait on me, there were about 6 staff members standing around and taking.  Finally, I was able to place my order after the first bartender  told another bartender that I was there and needed to be waited on.  I ordered my growler and while I stood waiting for it, I was greeted by a pretty awful sour smell. Not sure if this was from the bar, or perhaps an area that was unclean near where I was standing, or what. Either way, the smell was pungent and highly off putting.  Overall, I used to be able to quickly stop here for growler and feel welcomed and wanted as a customer. This was not the case today. I realize this was in between typical shift changes, but it felt like I was more of a nuisance than anything else."
Reed N.,"Kansas City, MO",116,1642,121,4.0,8/8/2013,"This place gets 4 stars for avocado egg rolls alone. If you like texture contrast and flavor, these bites of heaven will give it to you. They had a reasonable amount of beer on tap to select from as well... always a nice thing. They were way understaffed when I was here, and our large table had some issues... but at least the food was decent.  You may find some hits like the above and the pizzas... and misses like the boneless chicken wings if you come here enough. The menu is just too big, and they can't possible get all of it right. That would be my main critique."
Julie R.,"Greenwood, IN",1,14,,5.0,4/8/2016,"Delicious food, beautiful decor and friendly, attentive staff. Great beer! Love this place!"
Robyn P.,"Bloomington, IN",51,35,20,1.0,10/26/2015,"Eating here was an all around huge mistake and waste of time/money.  A group of us headed to Greenwood for an event and BJs was suggested.  I never eat at mall restaurants but decided to go for it. Once we were seated, it took about fifteen minutes before we even got our drink order taken.  It was about ten more minutes before we got those drinks and our food order taken.  It was then about thirty minutes before our food came out.  We weren't checked on once during that half hour which meant all of our drinks were completely empty. When the food was brought out by someone who was not our server, it became clear that the server had completely forgotten the three salads we had ordered.  About five minutes later, our server pops by to see if we still wanted those salads.  I had chosen a salad instead of fries, so yeah, I still wanted the salad I had ordered. Fifteen...FIFTEEN more minutes go by and salads are brought out and, get this, they aren't the right friggin salads!  At this point. We ask for our check, inform the server that we no longer want salads and that she needs to remove them from the bill.  More time goes by and we finally get our checks and not even a single lemonade was comped after such a terrible experience.  That's poor customer service, folks.   The food we did get was mediocre at best and not hot.   Ugh.  You guys, this place is really awful.  Generic and awful."
Amber E.,"Indianapolis, IN",37,167,236,5.0,12/30/2014,"You just can't go wrong with anything you get here. My favorite is the deep dish pizza. Wow it's amazing! I've never been to Chicago for the deep dish but I imagine this is it!  BJ's doesn't just have a few dishes they do well and the rest are mediocre no, no everything is done really well. I've never had less that excellent service and food here is awesome too."
Susan S.,"Whiteland, IN",3,39,21,5.0,2/15/2015,"Great service, great meal. They do have a HUgE menu, in my opinion it could be cut down a bit.  Don't forget to try the beer & root beer for the kiddos!"
Chris Y.,"Greenwood, IN",72,186,192,4.0,4/30/2013,"Pizookie. It's that good - save room for dessert. What's a pizookie? It's a cookie baked in a deep dish pizza pan. It's served warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Share it with a friend.  The beer is all good and true to style. There's nothing adventurous or overly creative.  The menu is big and comparable to TGIFriday's.  The chain was started by guys from Chicago to bring deep dish pizza to California. I stick with the pizza as that seems to be the speciality. My favorite is the classic combo - sausage, pepperoni, and mushrooms. Also enjoy the BBQ Chicken and the Mediterranean. When you're hitting a mall restaurant - you'll do better at BJ's."
Paul P.,"Indianapolis, IN",3,46,14,5.0,1/13/2015,"I love the fact that they have so many vegetarian options in their menu. I start with spinach and artichoke dip, simply loved it. Also I order spinach stuffed mushrooms which is always my favorite dish here... Both dishes were tasty. Then I order vegetarian deep dish pizza, oh I love the pizza as well.. Overall great food, I wanted to try some desserts but I was so full. I will definitely come back again. Also their service is super..."
Kelsey C.,"Milwaukee, WI",53,36,,5.0,6/23/2015,"I don't know how they keep up with such a huge menu - lots of options for whatever you're in the mood for. It's too bad we were just traveling through, I'd love to try more! We got the app sampler and a pizza - everything was delicious. I really liked their amber and cider beers."
T R.,"Greenwood, IN",0,3,2,1.0,8/21/2016,"Approached entrance just now and found elderly woman struggling with a walker to get in.  There were THREE people at your service/reception desk who did NOTHING to help her get in!  My husband and I helped her get in and left.  The plan was to eat there, but I was too mad and disgusted.  PATHETIC customer service."
Mayra D.,"Indianapolis, IN",1,9,,3.0,9/1/2015,The beer was very good & the avocado rolls & the grilled artichoke hearts were excellent. The carnita fries were not worth it; the meat was very tasty but almost none existent. The service was mediocre to say  the least.
