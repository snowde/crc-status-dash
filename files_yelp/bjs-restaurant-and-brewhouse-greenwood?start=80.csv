Mike M.,"Greenwood, IN",1,25,34,3.0,5/26/2014,"I had the Cajun chicken pasta.  It was good - not great.  Worth the $12.  Salad was ok, but I expected better. The menu has too many options.  My wife asked about sides and the waitress had to dig through the menu to show her the sides.  I HATE having to read through 7 or 8+ pages to make a selection. Just tell me what your best dishes are and then let me choose.   This is a chain restaurant so they have to do what corporate tells then to do.   I'd go back, but not next week."
Madelyn A.,"Indianapolis, IN",109,5,,3.0,12/29/2015,"The food is wonderful- variety, execution, all of it. The atmosphere can't figure out what it's trying to be, and the teenage staffers could use a pep talk in ""you'll be doing this the rest of your life if you don't pull it together."""
Rebecca S.,"Indianapolis, IN",124,132,145,3.0,10/2/2014,"I do love their beer, but one really bad experience there has, sadly, but a bad taste in my mouth for this place.  Our food on said occasion was absolutely terrible and should never have been sent out to be served.  I do, however, love the pazookies and shall bestow the 3 stars for the delicious dessert. I also recommend the cream soda... it is something to relish!"
Dan L.,"Trafalgar, IN",2,15,2,4.0,2/2/2016,"My girlfriend and I went for lunch a few Sundays ago, had a great time. The meal was awesome and well priced. Our server was very attentive and helpful. We will for sure be visiting again."
Cory S.,"Indianapolis, IN",89,501,18,3.0,5/4/2013,"I've been to a handful of other BJ's Brewhouses.. The atmosphere is good with a handful of tvs in the bar area and a clean modern look elsewhere.   The food was average.. i had a couple small plates, Chicken Won tons and Mac n Cheese.  The won tons were lacking flavor and didn't seemed like they were cooked right.  the mac and cheese was a bit soupy, but had decent taste.  The pissookie or whatever for dessert was great.  Its a personal cookie with a scroop of ice cream on top.  It was cooked great and was yummy! Their housemade beer is pretty good.. I had the new signature Blonde Lager.  It has great a taste, but is only a 12 ounce glass. At $5+ thats a bit steep, but good none the less.  The service... was pathetic.  Our server was a bit of jerk.  I don't know.. maybe our $100+ table bill was a turn off because we also had a kid with us? He was less than patient with any questions we had relating to the food and flat out left the table when my wife realized her ID was sitting in the car.   The negatives outweigh the positives here and with so many other great options in the area I'm sure our visits will be few and far between."
Mikey H.,"Greenwood, IN",4,1,16,3.0,11/6/2015,Came here for my Dads birthday hoping to have an awesome dinner with the family. Was somewhat disappointed in our food and service. The server was nice and all but she did not take care of us that well. She said she was going to bring a little cake for my dad but did not at the end (we were her only table). Overall did not have a pleasant visit.
Brice S.,"Noblesville, IN",0,63,170,4.0,10/14/2015,I ate here with a large party. The service was good for the amount of people they had to service. There was a large selection of brews. I small sweet bbq pizza. The pizza was excellent. This place is well worth your time if you are in the area looking to grab a bite to eat.
Peter P.,"Indianapolis, IN",167,1140,660,3.0,1/28/2013,"The first time I went to BJ's I was not impressed.  It could have been what I ordered (open-face chili burger).   It was pretty tasteless and not well-thought out (a burger doused with a pint of chili).   Also, the beer was pretty bland and a little flat. The second time I went, I left with a much better impression.  I was there for a casual wedding reception and they had a pizza buffet set out for us.   The pizzas were really good with a nice thick, yet not too chewy, crust and a zesty sauce.  Even the beers tasted a little more flavorful than my previous visit. The next time I come and sit in the main dining room, I will definitely order a pizza."
Laura O.,"Indianapolis, IN",129,32,,5.0,6/26/2015,"We're from the north side and don't make it down south much, but when we do, we go to BJ's!  Excellent beers, menu is huge, and we have never had anything bad. Our favorites include the clam chowder and the jambalaya!"
Katie L.,"Indianapolis, IN",11,7,1,5.0,9/21/2014,"Love this place. Great atmosphere, great prices. Best salad I've ever had is the BBQ Chicken Salad! They also have Gluten Free food and the BEST gluten free desert ever!"
Steve 'Moose' H.,"Louisville, KY",16,2,,5.0,8/5/2015,"Ryan behind the bar is Awesome. Who doesn't want someone to be greeted by someone with an explosive personality after a rough day like that? He asked for my name and got on a personal level, taking my order with no problems! Nice job Sir!"
Sarah G.,"Indianapolis, IN",2,3,,2.0,4/3/2015,"It's almost a shame that BJ's food is so good ....:: because the service is SO bad!  It starts as you enter and 9 times out of 10 the hostess has her back to the door as you come in - rather than making you feel welcome.  And then the service is slow and for some respond I keep getting servers that seem very  ""high strung""."
Just H.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,33,3,5.0,5/28/2016,"Great pizza,great drinks, great conversation. Time on the patio, so nice,never disappoints, keep up the good work. Great service, thanks Joe B,we'll try the flat bread next time!"
Lisa J.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,2,,5.0,9/19/2015,"Great food, great service, great atmosphere! My sister and I love having quiet and leisurely lunches here. The staff are accommodating without making us feel rushed.  The prices are right and the food is really good!"
Pete F.,"Greenwood, IN",59,97,2,3.0,11/5/2015,My family really likes this place.  I think it is ok.  They like the cookie ice cream desert.  They have some cool beers but I am a scotch drinker.  They don't have any premium scotches.  But since the family loves it we find ourselves there quite often.
Tansy F.,"Bloomington, IN",16,16,67,5.0,5/26/2014,The food here is fantastic! I recommend getting the house made root beer! It's fantastically delicious!
Tricia H.,"Greenwood, IN",0,16,2,5.0,6/18/2015,Happy hour prices are amazing... and the food is excellent. Had the California Club Flatbread for $4 and my spouse had chicken lettuce wraps for $6. Food was fresh... We'll be back for another date night!
Jolene S.,"Indianapolis, IN",26,9,,4.0,5/3/2014,"Since BJ's has extended their Enlightened Menu, my family have been regular diners at the restaurant.  There are several options for my kids to choose from and they always eat well  when we dine there.  My husband and I are both watching our calories and appreciate the number of dishes that you offer that are lower in calories and for listing the calorie counts.  Between the two of us, we have tried the Asian Chicken Salad, Bison Burger, Scallops and Grilled Fish Tacos.  The Bison Burger is my absolute favorite but so far, everything has been very good and very filling.  I hope you will add a few more Enlightened alcohol drinks to the menu since I really enjoy the cosmo on that list. Bottom line, please keep the Enlightened Menu in your restaurants since you've made this one of our regular family dinner spots ."
Matt H.,"Greenwood, IN",56,239,331,4.0,9/13/2014,"Went here for dinner for only the second time last night, I'm not sure why my family and I haven't been back more than that?! We liked our meals we got and the service is excellent here! Enjoyed the visit! They make their own root beer which is freakin good! I'm sure we will be back a lot sooner the next time!"
Patricia N.,"Indianapolis, IN",142,573,281,5.0,12/8/2010,"Came here on a late Tuesday night, since it's one of the few restaurants open til 11pm instead of 10.  We were offered to sit at the bar area, which was fine since the basketball game was on.  Since we got there around 10:15pm, only appetizers were available.  But we were not disappointed because the shareable appetizers were $2 off each and the mini pizzas were half off.   Service as fabulous as we weren't even rushed into finishing our meal.  Here's the breakdown of what we had:   1)  Piranha Pale Ale 2)  Big Fish IPA  (I preferred Piranha, so did my bf.) 3)  Potato Skins (Best ever!!  These were super hot and crispy.  Awesome that it was served with ranch and sour cream.) 4)  Chicken Tenders (So good!  The honey mustard was amazing, so was the bbq sauce.) 5)  BJ's Bacon Cheeseburger Mini Deep Dish Pizza (As other yelpers have attested, great crust!  Best of all it tasted like a great burger on a pizza crust.) Obviously, these was a very unhealthy meal.  But it was worth every calorie!"
