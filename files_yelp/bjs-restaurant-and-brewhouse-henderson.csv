Loren R.,"Anchorage, AK",10,242,262,5.0,12/17/2017,This place is like the girlfriend you wish you kept from high school.  It is so comfortable It is consistently good. High value. No surprises.  I'm happy with every experience.  ( been to 3 locations)
Sam S.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,14,,1.0,1/3/2018,Yuk!  My beer glass smelled like someone's lips with bad breath touched its rim.  YUK!!! I ordered Pizza and its crust was like Nabisco biscuit crackers. Super crispy and dry. My gum had a cut when I finished eating.   Disgusting!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Katherine S.,"Reno, NV",157,1,,2.0,12/28/2017,"I love coming into BJ's, and I came in tonight with my family for my birthday. I work in the restaurant industry, and I was seriously unimpressed with their service and waitstaff. We weren't greeted with a ""welcome"" or ""hello"" by the hostess up front, just her chewing gum with an open mouth. I don't think I saw her smile once. It was a busy night, I understand. But it continued with our server, Lauren. I remembered her name because I was embarrassed for her in regards to her hospitality. Not warm, not friendly, maybe spent 90 seconds total with our table the entire night. She made no effort to be warm or welcoming, and she seemed to be in such a rush that us asking for service was an inconvenience to her.  The food was good! That's what those two stars are for. However, when we ordered a dessert (we were so excited for the pizookies), there was a long black hair in one of them. Mind you, all of the women in our group are very blonde - we knew in no way could it be ours. We let Lauren know, and she took the dessert trio off our tab. She didn't apologize, she wasn't apologetic or accommodating whatsoever besides doing the bare minimum of taking the dessert off our tab.  The manager was friendly and apologetic, but the impression had been made. I work in a restaurant that gets busier than most, easily as busy as BJ's was tonight. Our waitstaff is still warm, friendly, collected, and accommodating. The lack of professionalism at this establishment was impossible to ignore, and the quality of our service had me feeling mortified on Lauren's (and that hostess's, and frankly the entire restaurant's) behalf. I truly hope Lauren was having a really, really bad night, and that she doesn't regularly give this quality of service to other customers."
Andrew N.,"Henderson, NV",90,27,92,3.0,12/20/2017,"Bj's catered my hospital ambassador meeting. They were about 40-45 minutes later than the scheduled delivery time. - Chicken breast was tender and charcoal flavor was not overbearing like some charcoal grilled chicken breast can be from other places. - pizza was warm still, with a crust resembling pizza hut. Less marinara than I prefer, only a thin layer under the toppings. - toppings are plentyful, and of average quality. Crust was soft, not crunchy, probably due to having sat in a warming bag for a while. - ribs were ok, a bit on the dry side. - salad was very basic, with the majority of the lettuce being iceberg (see pic). - meatballs were very soft, mainly due to the large amount of dough rolled into them, resulting in a diluted meat flavor that leaves them fairly bland. - pasta was just boiled pasta, marinara was not very flavorful either. - chicken nuggets could have come from the frozen section of the grocery store. - sausage was just your average sausage with spices. Overall, the best parts of the meal were the pizza and chicken breast in my opinion. I don't intend to go eat there in the future, as there was no food item that I had that was more unique than something you could find at a grocery store."
Komatsu O.,"Las Vegas, NV",143,52,66,5.0,11/10/2017,"I'm sorry hands down 5 star! We went to BJs up north Las Vegas and absolutely loved it! The servers and managers were so helpful and friendly and the food was on point! Henderson location is the same! Our server was so attentive and we were in the bar area! Even the guy that gave us our food was so happy and excited.  They never rushed us and they made sure that were attended to. My fish and chips was very crispy and flavorful. The veggie (vegan) was tasty and garnished perfectly! My wife had to have the Poke Salad again and it was just as perfect as before.  We signed up for the app, got a free dessert And started earning points! Check them out!"
Dione R.,"Henderson, NV",230,77,114,4.0,12/31/2017,"Came here on a weekday for late happy hour around 11pm since I didn't work till the afternoon the next day. I sat at the bar only ordered beer. The bartender Matt was extremely friendly and offered a few samples of some of the beer I mentioned I was interested in. The Jeremiah Red is my favorite, and will come back here for happy hour to order food and drinks next time."
Poco P.,"Las Vegas, NV",1616,372,2558,5.0,9/21/2017,"Taylor, our server is taylor-made for excellent customer service, knowledge over beers/beverages, the menu & overall is the perfect person you'd want to get when taking your parents out for dinner.   Mom only likes thin crust pizza & dad loves beer, neither have been to BJ's cause where they used to live doesn't have one so trusted me to order for them.  Taylor helped w/ the beer & since it's Oktoberfest, brought us a sample.  Mom & I decided on the four-beer tasting & dad got the Oktoberfest Lager.  Paired perfectly w/ our pizza & the Cardinal's baseball game as we sat in a large lounge booth.   (Mom & I's ratings of our Four-Beer Tasting .. Harvest Hef & Oktoberfest were our fav!  Jeremiah Red was Tangy & the Brewette was heavy.) I ordered them my fav's & the best of both worlds, savory & sweet!  The BJ's Classic Combo 9' Deep Dish Pizza & the mini Salted Caramel Pizookie to share!  They loved it & mom said it wa the best deep dish ever!   I ordered off the salad & pizza off of the lunch menu.  The seasonal Watermelon & Feta Salad, was lite, delish & the watermelon was sweet!  Also a 6' Deep Dish Pepperoni Pizza.  We arrived earlier than the happy hour, which starts at 3pm, but they have an excellent lunch menu & portion size is filling!   Overall, an A+ experience & I have dined at this BJ's about five times before.  I have sat twice in the dining area & the rest at the bar/lounge area.  I love the beers & food, but mostly Taylor stood out enough for me to want to leave a five star review.  Thank you!"
Brad D.,"Las Vegas, NV",24,103,10,4.0,12/6/2017,"Pretty decent foods. I love the seared ahi tuna salad. Beers are tasty. Wait times have been reasonable and have had pleasant waitresses. My wife likes the pizokies or whatever they are called, I think they are overrated."
Lori R.,"Las Vegas, NV",132,67,541,4.0,9/16/2017,"The last few times I've come, its been nothing but good. Today I ordered the Barbacoa Chicken and I was very much pleased.  Looking for something healthy this is a good choice.  The chicken was cooked to perfection.  Juicy and not dried.  And the barbacoa-spiced flavor was just ... mmmm.... good.  Chicken was tooped with the fire roasted tomato salsa which complemented well with the chicken and brown rice.   I couldn't stop raving on how good this chicken was.  I omitted the black beans.  The brown rice was topped with feta cheese, cilantro, and crema.  I honestly didn't care for the crema.  But other than that, awesome.  If I could make my chicken like this everyday, I could eat this everyday.   Staff is friendly and service was great.  In the past I've tried their lunch Spaghetti with meatballs and that too was really good.  Although the menu is big with a variety of choices (which I hate only because there is sooooo much good stuff to choose from), everything so far has been delish and this is definitly a place to go too for your picky eaters in your group."
Ryan F.,"Las Vegas, NV",83,31,133,4.0,10/29/2017,"Ok first of all any and all dog friendly restaurants get 4 stars. Bjs also happens to have a wide variety of tasty eats and they brew there own beer...big bonus  and a wide variety of other brews and cocktails.   I mostly get veggie burgers,you can substitute veggie or portobello on any of the burger selections. They also offer vegan friendly apps etc.   My wife gets mini deep dish pizza and says it's fantastic.   Today I had Bjs Jeremiah Red house beer and then tried the Jerry Burst, that is berry burst cider mixed with Jeremiah Red. Pretty tasty it turns the beer into more of a sweet treat.   That wraps today's visit."
Love G.,"Henderson, NV",78,55,64,5.0,7/28/2017,"Came here a while ago and never got the chance to leave a review!  We waited about 5-10 minutes for our party of three and were seated in a booth. While waiting, they had posters of different specials they had each day, and I believe their burgers were 50% off one day and they also had $3 pizookies on Tuesdays!  I decided to try their Long Island Ice Tea, and let me tell you - the strongest I've had it so far! Also worth it. Ordered the avocado bacon burger well done and got some fries with it. My mom ordered the chicken alfredo pasta and my uncle ordered a different pasta with shrimp in it but I can't remember the exact name. Service was a little slow but it's understandable because it during a dinner rush!  My uncle had never been to a BJ's restaurant so we ordered the trio pizookie option and got peanut butter, salted caramel, and white chocolate macadamia nut. And for about $9, that's a GREAT price considering you can try THREE different pizookies!"
Nicole P.,"Las Vegas, NV",458,127,1313,4.0,9/24/2017,"It was my first time eating at BJ's so I didn't know what to expect. A client took me to eat here with her family and we were on a time crunch, but the service was fast and the food was great. This location is far from me, but if I happen to find one closer, I might try out the rest of their menu!  Sorry this one is short & sweet. :P"
Joshua W.,"Henderson, NV",224,387,524,5.0,12/5/2017,"We recently visited this location and had the best experience and most amazing food ever. To start, I thought I'd try the Ahi Poke. What an excellent decision. The Ahi Tuna was a great portion and had soy sauce lightly drizzled on top (you didn't notice it - you only tasted it). It came with about seven cheesy chips and avocado as well as cabbage. I highly recommend this for a quickly-delivered bite to eat while you're trying to find your main course in the menu. For my main course, I had a pizza called ""The Italian Market."" It was amazing. Tasted like pizza from Italy itself. Very little sauce - but you could definitely taste it. Very thin crust - but perfectly cooked so as to not dump your toppings on your lap (and it tasted of a great toasted element). To drink I had BJ's own Root Beer and it was perfect. I'm not a big fan of black licorice and most root beer's leave a black licorice taste in your mouth. This one did not. It left a sweet root taste in your mouth that worked well with the food choices for the evening. Matt served us and he was a great waiter. We were able to download the brand-new BJ's app, pay with it (using Apple Pay) and got a free mini pizookie on our next visit! Needless to say, we'll be back to claim our free mini pizookie and I might just order the exact same thing. If it ain't broke, don't fix it, right?!"
Gina T.,"San Jose, CA",54,114,480,5.0,10/12/2017,"I went to different BJ's over the years and hardly have any bad experience with them. Their food are exceptional and always received excellent service, especially at this location. The server that helped us were super friendly and constantly checked on us. We didn't even have to ask for the refill with our drinks. We ordered the following items Appetizers: Chicken wings $11.50 - ask them to split in half buffalo and root beer glaze. Very crunchy and little oil. 4.8/5 Avocado egg rolls $11.50 - still prefer the one from Cheesecake but their tamarind sauce is good though 3.5/5 Crispy calamari $11. 50 - pretty much similar to other restaurants but not that oily. 4.2/5 Entrees: -full back pork ribs Thursday promo $17.95 it came with two items and a mini pizookie - worth getting this deal if you happen to come here on Thursday. The sauce amount of sauce was perfectly applied to the ribs and the meat was super tender 4.8/5 -seared ahi salad - $15.95 - my brother ate the meat and I ate the salad. Their rice vinaigrette sauce wasn't that sour 4.4/5 -seafood tacos $10.75 - my brother said the seafood was well marinated and he would give it 4/5 :-).  -steak top sirloin - $16.50 nothing special about this dish 3.8/5 -Shrimp & asparagus pasta - $16.95 - too salty and somehow the flavor wasn't there 3/5 - tavern cut flatbread brew house classic with pineapple - $17.25 must eat it while it still hot but very crunchy. They burned it a little though 3.5/5 - Tavern cut garlic chicken pesto $15.95 - too dry would be better if they have little bit more sauce 3.5/5 -Spaghetti with meatballs $9.99 - my daughter regret that she she ordered this dish. The dish was too dried and nothing special with the sauce. 2.5/5 I opted not to order my dish so I could try out all the dishes :-). Anyhow, I love their root beer drink."
Deborah S.,"Las Vegas, NV",54,5,,1.0,12/31/2017,"I ordered two pizzas from BJ's and they were not delivered. BJ's won't give me a refund and DoorDash, their delivery partner won't give me a refund either. I don't recommend you have anything delivered."
Linda S.,"Las Vegas, NV",280,50,214,5.0,8/12/2017,"Yummy in my tummy!! I love how many options they have. All of them sounded so good at the time and I had a really hard time choosing my entree. I decided on the ahi salad and loved every bit of it. My brother and cousin also enjoyed their plates. Our waitress was pretty cool, checked up on us fairly often and made sure our waters were filled. Now that I think about it, I only reason I went was to use my gift card. I forgot to apply it so yes, will definitely be back soon for a happy hour. Also, their pizookies are  !! If you sign up for their free rewards program, you get a free mini pizookie. ;) You're welcome!"
Karen W.,"North Las Vegas, NV",9,74,81,4.0,11/8/2017,"Whenever in doubt, I can always trust BJ's!  Always Have my blonde beer, and appetizers!  Had the sliders, and glazed ribs..excellent!"
Loreal G.,"Las Vegas, NV",335,159,323,4.0,8/14/2017,"Today was the standard 1st day of school dinner for my son and I. As usual most of the food was great (mahi/shrimp tacos, and stuffed mushroom appetizer) but my sons chicken tenders and fries were just ok. They literally came out 3 minutes after I ordered them but they weren't up to typical BJs standard. Shame on me for ordering from the kids menu. The berry cider was decent but I sure do miss the pear cider, I'll live. Amy was our server and she was great, she was fast, friendly and anyone would be lucky to have her as their server. Oh and unless the food is horrendous I don't complain I just don't order it next time or I don't go back. I'm not a ""talk to the manager"" kinda gal. I've been here a ton of times and I've just about filtered out what's good and what's not. Just remember that you can't go wrong on Mondays when a large pizza is half off!"
Keegan H.,"Henderson, NV",0,24,13,3.0,1/1/2018,"Well, thank goodness for Paul.  We walked in and wanted to sit at one of the 8 empty tables that had access to see the LSU game today.  The hostesses were completely confused as this was not her plan.  We stayed and eventually after managers involvement the staff was able to figure out how we could possibly be seated in the section.  ( Mind you there were tables all along the side that were filled.). Paul stepped up, dedicated himself to our table and was the best waiter we have ever had at this restaurant.  HE deserves 5 stars.  The management- ugh- figure it out."
Eddie B.,"Enterprise, NV",2,15,24,4.0,11/12/2017,"First time trying this BJ's , honestly over all it was pretty good. We got a salad which was delicious and a fried chicken burger with a spinach dip. Let me start by saying the service was amazing, but ... the fried chicken as funny as that sounds is a beef patty, but that's not the issue, my issue was the patty smelled and tasted funny. We let the waiter know and he jumped to take it out of the bill for us ... which is fine, but honestly I would have much appreciated if he had asked what the issue with it was so it doesn't happen again than just taking it of the bill. It didn't make me feel good to have him not ask what the issue was and follow up on it.  Other than that, the rest of the food and the ambiance was pretty good."
LP P.,"Henderson, NV",0,17,6,4.0,12/21/2017,This is not our first time at Bj's but it was still good. I had the vanilla cream soda that comes in a beer mug which was delicious. For dinner I ordered the grilled chicken pasta which was pretty good. My husband ordered the barbecue pulled pork burger which he loved. He said the sauce was complimented by the bacon and cheese. He also had the Grand Cru beer instead of the usual Stella. He said it was very smooth and the rye was perfect. My mom had the classic chicken sandwich which was hot and fresh the chicken was crunchy but tender and juicy inside. A great basic chicken sandwich. The spaghetti was devoured by our 12 year old so it must have been good.
CJ H.,"Las Vegas, NV",1440,171,21,4.0,12/13/2017,"BJ's is consistent. The food is always good. No matter how crowded they are, the orders are delivered in a timely manner. The servers are always very attentive. 4 start instead of 5 stars because we had to track the server down a few times like the 5 minutes I had to wait for a silverware setup. I finally went to an unoccupied table to fetch it for myself."
Ayanna J.,"Southeast, Las Vegas, NV",22,13,35,1.0,9/17/2017,The food at BJs is just  ok. Definitely not a place for dinner. I recommend you go here for beer  and finger foods
Richard S.,"Henderson, NV",0,65,45,3.0,6/27/2017,Been here before but disappointed this time. I had the Lemon Thyme Chicken. The chicken was very tender but the roasted Brussel sprouts and brown rice were swimming in the liquid. Very sloppy. The flavors weren't that distinctive. Just a mish mash. The chicken tasted more poached than grilled.  One of our diners ordered her entree when the rest of us ordered our appetizers. When she ordered her enter the server said it was put in with the appetizers and couldn't be changed. Wrong answer!  The server was rather surely. Even seemed bothered that my wife asked flor extra ranch dressing.  We'll be back but we hope our experience and will be back up to our previous times.
Stephan C.,"Burbank, CA",130,60,3,2.0,9/10/2017,"My friend and I went to the Henderson, NV restaurant on July 20, 2017.  I ordered a chicken club sandwich with sweet potato fries and coleslaw. My friend had the bison burger.  First the sandwich. I come from NY. A club sandwich, aka Triple-Decker has FRESH turkey, bacon, lettuce/tomato with 3 slices of bread and mayo. THAT is a REAL club sandwich. A sliced chicken sandwich from processed chicken as you'd get in a deli on 2 slices of bread is NOT a club sandwich, not now, not ever. I didn't eat it and turned it back, then didn't order anything else. The fries were sparse. The coleslaw.... large chunks of cabbage in a tiny bowl. I make awesome coleslaw at home and have had some of the best coleslaw outside. But this... surely needs to be changed. NEVER use large pieces of cabbage... just as you wouldn't put a thick piece of tomato on a sandwich. This was about the worst I've had. My friend's burger... dried, nothing special.  The waitress was great. Personally, I should have known better than to go to a chain restaurant, where everything is tasteless and way over-salted. My fault. We are very disappointed and will not return.  America... Chain restaurants, ala Red Lobster and Olive Garden, use loads of sodium. We all know that no matter how old we are, salt is bad for your heart. If not as a teen, then when you get older. It's a fact. Why chains do this is beyond me. Red Lobster packs their fish in frozen ice salt. Their sauces are way oversalted. This is what they told me. Same for Olive Garden. Salt does not bring out the taste... it eventually hurts your organs. Better to find a mom 'n pop shop, not a corporate chain restaurant. There is no shortage of restaurants. Be wise when you choose. I do not suggest BJ's as your place of choice to eat.. 2 times there and I'm done."
Aubry C.,"South Holland, IL",1,15,2,5.0,12/9/2017,"Visiting a friend in Vegas and they suggested that we go to BJ's for a drink and a bite to eat. I was a little skeptical since I prefer a less commercial environment. We arrived during happy hour and Roy, my bartender for the evening made this a very pleasurable experience. There was really good energy and we even met some cool people that I'm sure we'll hang out with again. Good food too. Avocado rolls, Santa Fe salad and salmon we're all good choices!"
Shay C.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",324,27,11,3.0,12/6/2017,"I love the soup, wine, pizzas, appetizers! The prices aren't too bad. Love the wine and beer. Happy hour prices are good so is the dessert!"
Ivy K.,"Paradise, NV",118,19,60,4.0,10/25/2017,"Online order review: I placed my order around 3:45pm for a 5:15pm pick up. Traffic was in my favorite that day and was parked curbside at BJ's at 5pm. I followed the directions and called letting them know that I'm here to pick up. The nice gentleman said that my order just came thought and should be out in 10 tens. Sure enough, ten minutes later a nice lady came out with all my food.  I received my food and she ran my card and I was on my way. The food was hot and delicious! For my first curbside experience I know to be on time next time around!"
Caitlin B.,"Las Vegas, NV",201,142,135,4.0,5/27/2017,"Came here on Tuesday around 7pm. There was no wait to be seated but it was pretty busy in general. They had a lot of specials going on including half off bottle wine, happy hour and 3$ pizookies. They are also doing buy one entree get one entree free with purchase of two beverages. We ended up with two entrees, an appetizer, and two glasses of wine for 42$! Our server was great too. Portion sizes are good and there is a good variety on the menu."
Katrina P.,"Las Vegas, NV",923,276,186,4.0,5/21/2017,"We always end up at BJs at one time or another because it's such an easy and casual place to grab a bite to eat and drink to drank!  If you're looking for a wide range of food choices, great drinks and beer, a casual atmosphere and friendly service, BJs is a great place for lunch or dinner.  We've come with family, friends, and our little one and it never disappoints. The food is a-okay and nothing to write home about but filling for what you're craving.  I love the roasted brussel sprouts, salads, and sandwich combos!"
Joseph A.,"Henderson, NV",2,33,41,1.0,4/20/2017,"Hosts were rude and short upon arrival.   We were dismissed at first then given instructions to stand and wait. Hostess that seated us sprinted to the table and seemed irritated we were behind.  Zero engagement.  Dining room was empty as well as the bar area. Dining room was dark, even my 14 yr old needed a flashlight to see the menu. Server was prompt and got our order accurately but again there was zero engagement.  No suggestions just took our order. Food was ok nothing exciting. If you are just looking to run in and run out maybe this is the place to you. We've been a few times and it has progressively gotten worse, although the hostess seem to be consistently rude. Won't be back for a while if at all, I can get good food at home, I go out for the whole experience."
Urian B.,"Las Vegas, NV",301,87,150,4.0,4/8/2017,"This location is pretty solid on service and food quality, so no real complaints. I really like BJ's for what it is: a chain restaurant with a thousand options that's open kinda late. Happy hour could be a little happier on the pricing I think. Pizzas are good, but not grand. Tomato bisque here is the god, though. Get the bisque! Monkey bread pizookie is also a winner in my book. Glad to see that option has stuck around on the menu for a while now. Love their fries, too. Totally worth it to sign up for their emails. Free pizookies and decent dollar amount off promotions all the time!"
Danbee T.,"Las Vegas, NV",184,58,91,5.0,8/27/2017,"great spot to come for a bite with friends with a wide range of beers and drink specials.  i've tried multiple things on the menu, but usually stick to the chicken mediterranean tacos. tried the new salmon pita tacos which were also awesome! grilled salmon with a creamy aioli, crispy green apples and a slaw with toasted, candied walnuts! pita is soft and the side quinoa/couscous is a refreshing palate cleanser between bites.  the root beer glazed chicken wings were great. right amount of crispy bite without drying out the inside and the glaze is not overly sweet. my boyfriend loved the crispy chicken salad with the honey mustard style dressing and my bestie loved the wings.  we come here once in a blue moon, but overall, for the beer selection & consistency with food quality, i would definitely recommend this spot if you want a little contemporary american cuisine variety.  service can be a hit or miss when dining, but i have noticed that the bar seating area with RACHEL is always a win. having had different servers there, i would definitely say she is the friendliest & best at her job. hard to find servers that actually care nowadays about the service quality, so if you're picky about service, find her!  definitely worth a shoutout BJ's!"
Keisha C.,"Henderson, NV",10,18,15,3.0,7/25/2017,"$3 PizookieTuesdayssss, whaaaat?!@!! And half off wine It has been over 5 years since I've eaten here and honestly it wasn't too bad.  We had a party of 7 lol. Family dinner night! Our table ordered... Mahi Mahi tacos. You can choose between fried or grilled topped with some cabbage, pico de gallo and i think it's some kind of aioli. De-lish! My love got fish & chips and the couscous macncheese. Fish was pretty good. Batter just a hair too much for him BUT that couscous was really good! Who would of thunk?? Couscous mac. Garlic chicken pesto pizza. G-double O-D-GOOD! Sisters got boneless Siracha chicken wings and a guac burger (bleh, b/c I'm *cough* allergic to avacado.  And the little cousin got a kids cheese pizza which by the way looked really good and he said, it was delicious  And for desert, pizookie of course. Peanut butter, salted caramel, chocolate chunk, monkey bread pizookie. All were delicious and only $3 on Tuesday for a normal size As for our server, she was awesome. I feel horrible bc I don't remember her name BUT she kept our drinks filled, was knowledgeable on the menu, and  was fun!  I definitely will come back to try other dishes on the menu and will be back for $3 Tuesday pizookies."
Patty M.,"Henderson, NV",159,52,7,2.0,11/1/2017,"This was our second visit to BJ's.  We dined at a time when the sun setting and the shades they have are not sufficient to block it out. We were all seeing spots in our eyes for quite a while  from the brightness. We asked to change our table, and the second one was a little better but there was still too much sun filtering through the shades. they have what looks like wooden blinds in the front of the restaurant that they should also put on the side windows.  Our server was very friendly, but severely lacking in being observant and listening. She took drink orders for my husband and son, but didn't ask me if I wanted anything.  I ordered a dinner salad with chicken. Son had a steak and husband had a quinoa bowl. I am a rather slow eater, and my family finished before me. The server came over and asked if we were ready for dessert. I was shocked, as I was clearly still eating. I told her I was still enjoying my salad and she said the pizzookie takes a while, so we should order it even though I was still eating. Well, here I am eating my dinner and less than 5 minutes later the food runner brings this hot cookie topped with ice cream over to our table. I called our server over and told her I was still eating. She asked me if I wanted a box for my salad. I said no, and SHE TOOK IT RIGHT OUT FROM IN FRONT OF ME! MY FORK WAS STILL IN MY HAND!  She also left the check and told us to have a good evening.  When she came back for the check, I told her I was shocked that she insisted we order dessert while I was still eating and that she also took my meal before I was finished. She smiled, asked if I enjoyed it and made no apologies. When I asked for a manager, she said she was new and would get in trouble, left the check for me to sign and we didn't see her again.  My son said while the steak was good, he felt a little queazy after the meal. I enjoyed the salad, but would have enjoyed it more if I had been able to finish it. I hope a manager reads this and responds appropriately."
Colin C.,"Las Vegas, NV",121,183,168,5.0,7/13/2016,"I seriously love this place. I had never been to a BJ's until I moved to Vegas last year and now I realize that they are not only on the west coast but spreading back east. Everything I've tried in the 6 or so visits has been delicious. From the deep dish pizza to the jambalaya, to the ribs, Pazookies... All very tasty!  In the past, Cheesecake Factory would be my go to place for a large menu with a lot of great choices but BJ's has certainly replaced CF for me. Every time I leave, I cannot wait to go again.  During my last visit, I was introduced to their mobile app which I can use to pay and earn rewards. I love user friendly tech additions so BJ's really won me over with this one.  If you're looking for a great meal at a reasonable price, definitely give this place a shot."
Luis F.,"Henderson, NV",2,36,132,5.0,12/5/2016,"This is a great BJ's, our waitress has been awesome.  The service here is and has been . We've landed the same waitress twice and we're so happy. The food has also been good and definitely recommend coming here for lunch.  We got seated pretty fast, so that's pretty good."
Mary R.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,10,,3.0,12/17/2017,"This place is our go-to place when I'm too lazy/busy to make dinner.  We used to go once or twice a week either eating in the restaurant or to-go, but we recently stopped going because the service isn't so great anymore.  We love the variety of food and most specially the pizookies that they offer.  Maybe we just need a little break from BJs and hopefully we regain back our love for the place soon."
Sam O.,"Las Vegas, NV",118,97,213,4.0,1/11/2017,Had a really great experience here recently! The waiter was very nice and prompt ! I had the triple decker and it was very tasty ! My wife had the pepperoni flat bread and unfortunately was a little on the greasy side !! We love eating here because of all the choices and atmosphere is nice !!
Spero D.,"Henderson, NV",33,12,,1.0,6/7/2017,"What a zero establishment. When I got the check, they inserted a business card for Mr. Uphoff, the manager. This implies that he is concerned about your opinion. Not even close.  If you are unfortunate enough to get the waitress Jeramie, run. Cold, uninterested, useless and doesn't care about the customer or her job.  I wrote Mr. Uphoff a detailed email detailing our experience commenting on positives and negatives. No Response. Not even an auto reply. Zip. After 4 days I forwarded it to corporate. No Response. They are disinterested.  Go elsewhere. They food is marginal, service is weak and I spent $65 for lunch for 3 people. No drinks at all. Seriously. Any place is better."
