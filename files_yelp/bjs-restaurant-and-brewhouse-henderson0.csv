LaShonda G.,"Henderson, NV",0,9,1,2.0,6/15/2016,"Absolutely not impressed this time around. I've been to many other BJ'S locations, however this one...uh...not great. We both ordered the jambalaya. Huge mistake. Both plates came out really cold. We sent them back (they microwaved them....); came back extra salty (I kid you not). We left. Probably won't be back. :("
Bonnie P.,"Henderson, NV",217,599,120,4.0,12/29/2013,"Update time!   I love most of, if not all, of the food I've tried here!  It's such a huge menu to choose from.  For dinner, my favorite meal is the balsamic glazed chicken.   I absolutely the adore the sodas on tap.  Black cherry and orange cream are my fav's.  And the pizookie... well, I just can't pass up a pizookie.  I can't find anything wrong with a warm cookie topped with ice cream, except maybe for how long it takes them to make it (so order early) and how bad it is for you lol. The downsides for me: dinner, drinks, and dessert at this chain restaurant really add up.  It's not the cheapest.  Also, the service can be pretty slow and the place gets packed.  You can call ahead to put your name on the list so I recommend this if you're going on the weekend.   I'm so pleased with the food here that I'm sure I'll keep on coming back.  I've had worse service for way less delicious food so I can overlook it..."
Jason R.,"Brooklin Paulista, Brazil",187,171,236,3.0,5/20/2015,"My vote for best late-night beer in Henderson. Great atmosphere and super-friendly service, extensive bar selection.  The sticking point is the menu. Food here is over-engineered and ok quality.  I'd love to see BJ's throw out the menu and do fewer traditional bar & grill items better."
Kush B.,"Henderson, NV",193,52,33,3.0,2/14/2015,Decent food. Great for bar food and the self made beer was good to try but honestly not the best service.  The value was good for the price and that is the best I can say about BJs
Stephanie P.,"Henderson, NV",89,133,55,3.0,1/3/2015,"My Dad recently moved into a new place.  After a full day of my sister and I helping to get him settled in, we decided a nice warm meal was needed on this very, very cold day (last weekend). I decided to go ""old school"" with the chicken tenders served with skinny fries and a strawberry lemonade.  Dad had the roast beef with au jus, and my sister went for a burger. The chicken tenders were tender with a generous amount of breading.  The strawberry lemonade was unfortunately just too sweet.  The fries were cooked perfectly!  All in all, not bad."
Trace R.,"Las Vegas, NV",781,118,154,5.0,4/2/2015,Love the Henderson location.  Always friendly staff and great food! Lots of choices! One of our favorite places for lunch :)
Elaina C.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,15,,3.0,11/24/2016,We ordered the ahi salad which I thought was always great but yesterday  it wasn't the best.  I wonder if they have changed the recipe.  But my friend had the steak  and it was good. The service was ok but it seemed like he was in a hurry for us to leave so he could go.
Ron E.,"Las Vegas, NV",58,3,17,4.0,10/10/2015,"I stopped in for a beer after work. The service was fast, the atmosphere just right! I'll be back later for more beer!"
Brenda L.,"Las Vegas, NV",327,436,1240,4.0,1/19/2012,"This is for their chicken tortilla soup ONLY! YUMMMMMMMMMMMM is all I can say. I love how they come out with the bowl filled with the tortilla chips, avocado, lime and chicken and then they pour the broth in your bowl at the table. That way the tortilla chips are never soggy and it's just cool to see.  I ended up ordering the half potato (grilled chicken) and soup. It definitely filled me up for $8.00-$9.00? There was a lunch rush, but everything seemed to come out quickly. Overall, I have always been a fan of BJ's and now that its walking distance from work I will be here more often."
Jason S.,"Valencia, CA",6,37,2,5.0,10/29/2016,"Excellent service from takeout! My order was accurate and hot, and Savannah did everything above and beyond to help me out! Without her it would be just another chain pizza place! Stop by and have a pazookie!"
Kristin M.,"Las Vegas, NV",60,69,50,5.0,3/4/2016,Everything was AMAZING. Rachael was so great made sure we kept having drinks. Very busy but great. Didn't miss a thing. She was very nice friendly and welcoming. I told the manager how great our service was and how delicious the food was. Can't wait to come back again great job everyone
Olga R.,"Grand Prairie, TX",0,34,8,3.0,11/6/2016,"Ok food. My steak came way overcooked, dry and rough, but the manager fixed it. Our server was a bit too chatty, to a point where she'd interrupt a conversation to try upselling alcohol and dessert, and then hung out around the table behind us taking loudly. Delicious brussel sprouts. The menu looked extensive, probably will be back to try other things"
Jay A.,"Las Vegas, NV",269,439,652,4.0,11/17/2014,"A chain restaurant,but a very good chain restaurant. I often have to explain when I give this restaurant 4 stars, I am comparing it to other joints in their space, not to a fine dining or even a fast food place. Ok so now that we got that out of the way (until the next time I have to explain :)). Great burgers, great pizza, very great beer! Not so great french fries, yes I have had both kinds. They have the think cut, more like potato wedges, and thin, more like match sticks. Other than that everything is great and so is the service. Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"
Barney A.,"Henderson, NV",29,88,178,4.0,12/18/2015,Great place. Lots of choices. Always good service. Great for large groups. Huge bar area. Lots of TVs to watch the games. Two thumbs up.
Stamone R.,"Charlotte, NC",34,169,52,3.0,12/17/2014,"The staff here is too nice, too good at their job, they should all be fired for being too good and then be hired by Gordon Ramsay. The food quality is...above Applebee's, barely. The drink selection is solid, and the place is attractive and clean. Thanks place. Also , heads up to management, it says on Google that this location is open 24/7.  I ordered the : Avocado Egg Roll - 9/10        Chicken Bacon Ranch Pizza - 7/10                             Fried Calamari -  4/10                                    Pizookies - 11/10 ;)"
Chris V.,"Henderson, NV",771,896,4936,4.0,2/21/2014,"I didn't see myself coming back here and trying the pizza again. However, with a group dinner scheduled for this place, I had no choice in the matter. It took a while after our reservation time, but we were finally seated in the dining area on the street-facing side of the restaurant. I found out that the food was presented buffet-style for us, and it was right up by the wall for us to access. I guess no enterprising neighbors bothered to try to filch some extra food, but we ended up with extra food at the end. Our menu included a house salad, with an Italian dressing and a ranch dressing, a grilled chicken pasta with creamy white sauce and broccoli (and apparently not enough chicken at all), and various pizzas. The pizzas were way better than last time, mainly because the crust was not soggy. I guess they know how to cook the smaller pizzas than whatever gigantic monstrosity I experienced in my last review. I didn't get to try the combo, but the pepperoni and the chicken (with mushrooms and tomatoes) were both very solid. Most of us also ended up ordering mini pizzokies. My choice of the triple chocolate was a super sweet potentially-diabetes-inducing assault, and I enjoyed it aside from quickly gobbling up the Ghirardelli chocolate square because it wasn't going to be easy to break into small and even pieces. The one thing I didn't appreciate was that we didn't get refills on water until long after dessert. I didn't find any of the foods particularly salty, but I had a problem when I simultaneously craved and lacked water at the end of my meal. Thankfully, we got additional water refills even while we were just lounging and chatting after dessert, which made the night less uncomfortable in the end. Owing to the improvement in pizza, I'm comfortable in bumping my rating up to four stars. Although my first choice on Eastern Avenue wouldn't be a chain, I wouldn't mind coming back here at all."
Tushar J.,"Las Vegas, NV",89,7,4,5.0,5/5/2015,"So this is just a drink review. Bjs has an amazing selection of crafted beer. I tried the Nit Wit, Jeremiah Red and the Harvest hefeweizen. They were excellent! If you are a beer drinker, put bjs on your map and check it out for a fun time!"
Micah L.,"Henderson, NV",44,232,1926,4.0,1/18/2015,"I first discovered Bj's when I lived in Orange County. I was stoked when I moved here and found out that there was one fairly close by. This place gets very packed on a weekend or Friday night but I have no problems with it. The staff is very friendly, fast and delivers great service. Love the huge menu they have with tons to choose from. My personal favorite is the Buffalo chicken pizza paired with my favorite beer a Jeremiah Red. If you got room left in your stomach  there's the pazookie which is a bit of heaven baked into a cookie topped with icecream."
Mike F.,"Las Vegas, NV",214,619,4077,3.0,5/28/2013,"It was okay. I mean the place was very nice and clean. The food was okay. I had the wings and a friend of mine had the double cheeseburger and it was actually pretty good. Plus I do have to say that the house brew was good as well.  My only problem was with the prices and the service. The prices were a bit pricey. For 3 people who had 1)wings 2)burger and 3) spaghetti w./no meatballs..the bill came too 50.00! The food was good, but not THAT good! ...and on top of that the service moved pretty slow. It wasn't that busy and yet there was a great lag in service. Honestly, the food was good enough that we will come back and try it again one day...but if the service isn't improved, it will most likely be the last time.. Update to come...but for now... 3 stars."
Darren H.,"Springfield, MO",0,22,,5.0,12/19/2015,We really enjoyed this place. The ale was nice and they served up one of the best burgers that we have found in this town. We were seated promptly even on a very busy night and our waiter was on the spot with everything we needed. They without question exceeded our expectations going in to a chain. Well done guys!!!!
