Justin C.,"Las Vegas, NV",29,20,19,3.0,5/19/2017,3 stars is only cause we went on Friday night. Now why does Friday nights suck...well happy hour does not come back at 10 pm like Sunday thru Thursday and Friday night has no dinner specials. So skip Friday nights unless you just love full price drinks and dinner.
Dennis D.,"Henderson, NV",297,256,1640,3.0,12/21/2014,"BTW, for those who care, this is my 100th review!!! Woot woot!  Anyways, I Went here for dinner with some friends because one of them never had a pizookie and I just couldn't let that go on for any longer.  Nothing too special about this place, but it is known for their pizzas. I ended up ordering the chicken limon pasta which was really good, but that could be because I was super hungry at that time. The pasta was filling, but it was also really buttery and oily. I don't eat that heathy, but it'd be nice if the fatty stuff wasn't just straight up obvious because it can be off putting at times. On the bright side, the two sticks of garlic bread they gave was pretty good and was a nice compliment to the dish. My friends and I got the strawberry beignet and the pizookie trio (white chocolate macadamia, Oreo, and chocolate chip) for dessert. The beignet was pretty crispy which is a big plus and the scoop of vanilla ice cream and strawberry pieces made it even better.   I also discovered my newfound appreciation of the Oreo pizookie. If you haven't yet, you have to try it out when you get the chance. Just be aware that the portion sizes for each of the trio is pretty small so it would be a nice small dessert for 3 people to split.  This place is a little overpriced in terms of the food and portion size, so just be aware of that."
Naomi N.,"Las Vegas, NV",543,244,1691,4.0,1/29/2015,"LOVE THE BLONDE BEER Had to grab a quick pazookie trio here after dinner. The place was packed for a thursday night there seemed to be a little wait. We sat at the bar & we were greeted very quickly by the bartender .... we knew what we wanted & ordered right away.  I personally can't drink very much & they had a little 5oz. Beer that they sell too! It's so cute and the perfect amount for me. Got the blonde beer & it was delish. Had to give a 4 star on this review because the pazookie cookie was not hot. Maybe they changed it or something but it used to come out hot to the point where u can't really touch the silver tin part, but the tin wasn't even very warm. That was the only thing a little disappointing since I took a friend to try the restaurant for the first time. Other than that great service! =]"
Tania S.,"Albuquerque, NM",218,624,1495,4.0,4/20/2015,"Nick did a great job getting our orders and drinks quickly. We had an eventful night on the Strip and wanted to chill out for a late dinner out in Henderson. BJ's was a great choice! All the food was so good! Between three of us gals, we ordered some beverages followed by a Pulled Pork sandwich, Hamburger with Wedge fries, then my (pictured) Swiss Cheeseburger with Skinny fries. With room for dessert, we ordered the Chocolate Chip Pizookie, which is a must if you eat here! Over a nice dinner and cool conversation, I can't think of a better place to hang after a typical Vegas night. Great drinks, even better atmosphere, and awesome server! When I'm back in town, I'll be sure to check it out again (aka more Pizookies). :-)"
Jeff F.,"Henderson, NV",0,50,14,4.0,11/2/2016,I had a brew house blonde beer and it was very good.  It was very tasty yet still on the lighter side. I also had the seared Tuna salad and it was VERY good.  The food was very good and served very quickly. This is a great place
Marlyn V.,"Las Vegas, NV",178,29,196,5.0,2/9/2017,Came here after 230p and was seated by the best server ever Davena and she went above and beyond our expectations. It's because of her that I will be back. She only works during the day so come here for lunch on Thursdays for their Baby Back Rib Thursdays. It's totally worth it.  And their clam chowder is one of the most tastiest I've ever had.
Samantha C.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,5,5,5.0,5/18/2017,"Great service, Bill the bartender makes a mean drink and is friendly, but not annoying, while we sat for a couple of hours. Good beer too!"
Miber J.,"Henderson, NV",35,73,30,3.0,9/5/2016,"My iced coffee was weird, it was like watered down regular coffee over ice. I would never order it again. For a sports bar there were an awfull lot of children there! Although our food was quite delicious tho mmm especially dessert. Our server was attentive and friendly, the menu was so vast, it takes a while to decide. Our overall experience was good its just that at the end of the day, its just over priced bar food in a noisy environment."
Cindy W.,"Las Vegas, NV",16,312,2,3.0,3/5/2017,BJs is an average chain restaurant. My spaghetti & meatballs were fairly good although a bit pricey ($15). It was dark in there & I really couldn't read the menu or see the pictures well. It looked like it said $11 for the spaghetti. My friend's spinach salad looked good.
Brittany N.,"Las Vegas, NV",142,120,268,5.0,10/6/2015,"Goodness I love this place. It's a chain, but that doesn't mean it doesn't hold a special place in my heart. I can't get enough of the mocktails . They have a berry limeade cocktail that satisfies my need to have a unique refreshing drink. This drink has unlimited refills with fresh fruit in every glass.  Bjs staff is always happy to serve you and never lets your glass stay empty. The food is always fresh and I'm currently craving their guacamole as I write this review. I have probably been to this establishment 10 different times, so I don't speak based on an antidote experience. My favorite dishes so far include the tomato soup in bread bowl, Cajon chicken pasta, and their golden beat salad. I'll be back during happy hour for their nut brown ale and discounted appetizers. :)"
Chad F.,"Southeast, Las Vegas, NV",1,4,,5.0,4/5/2017,Thank you BJ's for keeping your entire restaurant open during the hours posted on your door.  Your neighbors (twin nasty peaks) closes their kitchen an hour before they close the actual restaurant.  Makes no sense...but thank you for the great food and service at 11:30pm.
Bob S.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,1,,1.0,11/14/2017,"Kevin Morrison - Manager of BJ's in Henderson is a moron.  I have eaten at the this restaurant about 150 times in three years.  It's a fast fix to mediocre food at cheap corporate prices  when you have a busy business schedule like myself-a step above Burger King, McDonalds and other fast food chains.  Basically this is corporate America - hiring idiots who can't deliver simple requests like a decent salad that doesn't look like a small Hamster portion with shredded and soggy lettuce and chopped tomato!  Looks like one of those prepackaged salads at McDonalds.  Sorry, I requested actual sliced tomato, avocado and red onion and real lettuce but the dumb server screwed it up.  Let alone I order a charbroiled steak (not fried) and they only charbroiled one side with that facing up (as if I would'nt notice).  When I sent back the salad without eating it this manager - a little ""piss ant"" bald jerk comes running out and tells me to leave the restaurant and not come back!  About a month before that the lot was entirely full without one space so I parked my car in the take out area and this little creep Morrison comes running up to the bar threatening to tow me!  When I complained to Corporate Management they actually defended him!  It must be difficult to find decent employees with the crappy wages they pay.  So much for getting repeat business - they could care less.  Better to hire twenty bad employees and pay them crap than hire five good ones and pay them fairly.  That's why their turnover is so high.  Steer clear of this place is my advice."
Kashaundra W.,"Henderson, NV",0,12,13,3.0,4/22/2017,"Let me start with I was on a much needed date night with my hubby while the kids greyed grandmas hair for the weekend. We were seated at a greasy table top and the seat cushions had grease and food particles on it. Not good and I'm wearing all white! I only rate with three stars because of the lack of cleanliness of the restaurant. The food,drinks and service was great! But back to my issue, I don't know how well they clean and sanitize their cloth napkins that the silverware is wrapped in and we use on our face (the corner of your mouth) but for the sake of the community's health, I hope very well! I found five cloth napkins in total on the floor under my table and the surrounding tables ( I counted on my way to the restroom).... I noticed a little extra cushion under my stiletto and my husband stepped on something that poked the bottom of his shoe and that's when he noticed a couple of forks under our table as well. This is when I began to look around and noticed more than I wanted to. Upon picking up the napkins I saw silverware and trash at all of the surrounding booths! We brought it to our waiters  attention and he was highly disappointed. As we finished our meal a bus boy came by to ""clean"" the booth next to ours and we understood! He spent five seconds (literally) wiping down the table with a dirty damp cloth and did a quick swiffer wipe on one seat cushion and neglected the other! He didn't bother to look under the table or properly wipe down the entire seating area... it was a total hit and miss. All in all the food, drinks and service are always great but the cleanliness gets worse with each visit...."
Stan P.,"Las Vegas, NV",16,95,18,4.0,2/15/2017,New to Vegas recommended by a local friend was pleasantly surprised! We will definitely come back to  this place as a repeat customer.
Sheila M.,"Henderson, NV",85,24,3,5.0,3/6/2017,Great service and great food! Gotta love a server who continues to refill your glass when you've ordered a pitcher. Have never had a bad experience coming here.
Zachary A.,"Las Vegas, NV",69,725,,3.0,1/9/2016,"This review is for 3.5 stars. Overall, I enjoyed my trip to BJ's.  I came for the brew but also tried some food which was solid.  Their beer is surprisingly unique and flavorful for a chain microbrewery.  I had the 4 beer sampler for a little under $7 and also was able to sample other brews because the bartender was gracious.  All of the ales (pale, IPA, DIPA) were nice and a less hoppy variant of the style.  The Porter had a solid chocolate taste and the imperial stout was very smooth for the 8+ ABV.  As far as food, I had a quinoa salad which was not overly memorable, but was good enough for a meal.   There are 3 BJ's within the Las Vegas area, so wherever you are in town, you are bound to be near one.  If you are looking for a solid, not macro brew, come here.  They also offer very good guest taps and bottles for very reasonable prices ($5-6.50) when it comes to Las Vegas.  The Happy Hour for beer is $1.00 off draft and there are also some food deals.  I recommend you give BJ's a try."
J. R. S.,"San Diego, CA",7,27,6,5.0,3/14/2017,Good selection of food. There was something for everyone. All of our food was well prepared and great tasting. Our server was Amy C. and she was one of the best servers I've ever had. Very friendly and attentive. She constantly asked if we needed something before I ever had a chance to flag her down. We will come back!
Allison M.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,24,11,3.0,2/22/2017,"Bjs has always been one of my favorite places. On valentine's day my husband and i came here for a quick bite to eat because he had to work. We were notified they no longer had the crispy thin fries. Appalled, but decided to give the new ones a chance. I HATED THEM. lacking flavor and to be honest i'd rather have their cold thin fries over these any day. They definitely will be losing our weekly or even bi weekly visits. Up the price if you're losing money, but don't change something so good."
Alissa S.,"Mission Viejo, CA",3,22,7,5.0,5/16/2016,"Food was good, service was great! Brandon has a big booty  PHAT if y'all know what I mean. No but really.. This location is slightly off the strip in a great location. Happy hour is murder! It took everything I had to reject one of their amazing looking cocktails. I will be back to try each margarita on that cocktail list! Mark my words =] Brandon was adorable, helpful, patient and very attentive. Even with a full row of bar booths.  From one industry person to another. Well done Hun."
Nick C.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,2,2,5.0,9/17/2016,At bj's really good service our server was really will definitely recommended my wife a drink that she just got and we'll see how the drinks are and so far so good
