Rose P.,"North Las Vegas, NV",20,71,27,5.0,4/30/2016,"Been here a handful of times and this review is way overdue! This place can get pretty crowded and busy at times. But you can't ding a restaurant just because of that... It means they're doing their job and running this place as it should!  I have never had a complaint about getting greeted every time I walk into BJ's. When it's busy, they give us an honest estimate as to how long we will wait. None of that ""10 minutes"" when they really mean 45 minutes!  Once we get seated our drink orders are taken almost instantly. We have quite some time to look over the menu, we never feel rushed. When you have no idea what to order waiters/waitresses are always recommending and suggesting things.  Food comes out hot and fresh. You never have to wait too long for your food. Approximately between 30-45 minutes, max! I appreciate the waiters tending to our needs and frequently checking up on us.  I never have complaints on cleanliness here. The waiting area, seating area, and bathrooms are always so clean! HUGE plus for me! Excellent customer service! Welcoming and accommodating staff. I would highly recommend this place!  Side note, if you don't know what to order I would suggest:  Appetizers- avocado egg rolls, stuffed mushrooms Main Dish- Cajun chicken pasta, (any flavor) deep dish pizza, or broccoli cheddar soup and/or clam chowder with a bread bowl Dessert- you can never go wrong with a pizookie! But definitely try the beignet!  Hope this helps!"
N M.,"Henderson, NV",24,12,4,1.0,12/3/2016,"Hostesses did not put our name on the list after doing the preferred VIP Checkin.  Kenneth was great in his service but the hostesses are worthless  pieces of human organisms.  Does a disservice to the waitstaff.   Food was consistent and good as usual.  Unfortunately for the waitstaff, this is the last time we are dining at this chain."
Vegas N.,"Henderson, NV",1,41,7,4.0,1/27/2017,"I go here when the wife is out of town.  She goes with me many times, especially when a big game is one that we want to see.  We always sit at the bar.  The service is very good, sometimes it might take longer to get our food, but nothing outrageous.  The beers are very good, the home make sodas are tasty.   The cherry chipoltle salmon is exceptional.  A nice sized salmon filet sitting on a field of cous cous and grilled asparagus.  The calories and fat are very low.   We love the happy hour pizzas.  Nice price and very good quality.   We are usually not fans of national chains such as B.J.'s.  But, the menu is extremely broad with multiple healthy choices and the prices are reasonable for what they deliver. And, in other B.J.'s across the nation that we have visited, the quality is surprisingly similar."
Kirsten M.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,24,3,5.0,2/28/2017,"I love BJ's there is so much on the menu to pick from. I have been to two of their locations and every time, the staff is so friendly, the portions are big and the price is right. The honey sriracha brussel sprouts are AMAZING! Great place to go with your significant other or even a big group!"
Elena L.,"Las Vegas, NV",65,33,17,3.0,6/15/2016,"Clam chowder is kinda salty, service was alright but the hostesses seemed off, boyfriend thought the chicken alfredo was good but I thought it was pretty average.  Eh?"
Sandra M.,"Fisherman's Wharf, San Francisco, CA",0,13,,2.0,1/12/2017,The chicken tastes like rubber. It's not just this location. Their food aside from the pizza has just really gone down hill. My husband and I shared the Santa Fe salad and the Alfredo chicken pasta. Both plates had gross chicken. The salad was bearable at best. The pasta I sent back because I asked for the chicken well done and it wasn't at all. It was rubbery and veiny. When they brought it back they chopped up the same chicken and tossed more sauce on it. Annoying but not worth the battle obviously. I ate around it. The service was good. I just won't be back because of the food. I haven't had good food here in a while.
Melody W.,"Las Vegas, NV",4,22,1,5.0,4/20/2016,"Nice neighborhood restaurant /bar. Like an upscale version of Applebee's / Benigans. Food is great my family's favorites are the jambalaya, fried chicken breast, barbecue ranch chopped salad.  I haven't tried the pizza yet but they sure look yummy.  My favorite soup is chicken tortilla soup.  Crafted beer and soda are also wonderful."
Jonathan W.,"Las Vegas, NV",244,41,25,5.0,3/2/2017,"I used to work here and I have to say, for that year that I was employed.. I could've turned into an avocado egg roll I ate SK many of them!! So good! Really awesome spot for a date, which is what I was doing the first time I ever went there, or a big family dinner. The food is some of the best I've had in Vegas!! Get the root beer! I promise it'll change your life. =P"
Ralph P.,"Las Vegas, NV",6,51,97,4.0,8/2/2016,"Bjs in Henderson is right near the 215. The Santa fe salad is awesome. The chips add a crunch to the old that makes it super good. I had to take a break from shoveling the entire thing in my face. It's huge, so be prepared."
Emily P.,"Las Vegas, NV",145,70,24,5.0,3/14/2016,"I must say... BJ's has turned it around! There was a time where we couldn't seem to get the correct food or something yummy looking. However, we started seeing a different group of guys working the bar and times have times!! Yummy food, happy and friendly service, and always great beer choices. PS.. Happy hour goes until 7!!!!"
Aurora D.,"Las Vegas, NV",311,275,253,4.0,8/4/2015,"Went here for lunch and was impressed with how they kept everything moving during this busy hour.  I had the Salmon Quinoa bowl (lunch menu) and it was the perfect size. I asked for the [Ginger Soy] sauce on the side and I'm glad I did, otherwise I think it may have been too salty.  The service was great for us as well. Next time I want to try one of their many pizookies!! I don't know that it stands out too much (beside the pizookies) from other bar-restaurant chains but if you need a good solid place to go for different palates, this Eastern location can do the trick."
Candice S.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,120,71,2.0,7/7/2015,"I try not to go to chain restaurants as much as possible for a reason! BJ's reminded me of exactly why. We walked in and were seated right away because it was empty, however, waited 15 minutes for a server to ask us what we wanted to drink. Waited another 10 for our waters and to order... Waited another 30 for our dinners... Our server seemed over worked and unapologetic.  The food was average. Deep dish ravioli was good,pepperoni pizza was ok the roast beef dip was dry, chicken Alfredo was dry... Just overall a bad experience...so THANK YOU BJ's for reminding me of why we don't do chain restaurants."
Kurt S.,"Las Vegas, NV",3,18,3,3.0,12/5/2016,"Just doesn't seem as good as it used to.  Menu has gotten smaller, starchier, and less interesting.  The cooking seems sporadic -- Just not as well prepared and consistent as a few years ago.  Things often come out undercooked, burnt, and sloppy.  The ingredients don't seem as fresh.  They no longer seem to carry the seasonal Goliath and Imperial IPA beers we liked.  We still go here now and then, but a lot less often.  I hope they will turn this around and return to the consistency and quality they had a few years ago."
Tamara S.,"Henderson, NV",38,51,9,5.0,11/21/2016,"Fiancé and I come here often. We each order something often. Let's start off with the food, the avocado egg rolls are superior , stuffed mushrooms are delicious, chicken tortilla soup looks small but is actually really filling, &parmesan garlic wings are a must. The waiters/ waitresses are extremely accommodating. And the plus is the food isn't that expensive, nor the drinks :)"
Ashley C.,"Henderson, NV",59,282,167,5.0,4/25/2016,"First time ever going to this place, honestly never heard of them. We decided to go for brunch which is on the weekend (Saturday's and Sunday's) I was excited to see breakfast menu. I got me OJ, French toast with eggs and bacon. Really good! My husband had the classic burger with their secrecy sauce and potato wedges. He even said the lemonade was delicious.  We liked this place we ate it again in CA. Great food and our waitress and hostess were really nice :)"
Denise M.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,3,,1.0,7/3/2017,"After dining in many times and ordering the kale and Brussels sprouts salad, I ordered the allegedly same salad, 'to go.' It was terrible...barely filled the container and was missing some of the usual ingredients. I think I found two blueberries and three pecans. Terrible!"
Stan C.,"Henderson, NV",135,379,201,4.0,6/18/2015,"I have eaten at BJ's many times. Mostly I've been here for dinner and once for brunch. This was the first time I came here for lunch. I chose the seared ahi salad off of their lunch menu. The salad was listed as having only 540 calories which made it very attractive in regards to being diet compliant. The salad was quite large in size. It had a lot of what I would call ""foo foo"" lettuce. But it also had avocado, tomato, and other tasty add ins ( including a small dollop of wasabi on each side of the plate). In addition there was a fairly generous amount ahi tuna. Overall, a relatively healthy, fairly dietetic, enjoyable luncheon salad. Combine that with pleasant ambience and excellent service (kudos to Shenna). A good choice for a midweek lunch."
Jim T.,"Las Vegas, NV",87,270,149,5.0,5/4/2016,"Their pizzas are amazing, love the deep dish pizza. They also have thin and flatbread. They have a good selection of their own craft beers but the Pazooky is the bomb.   Thank you BJ's for appreciating teachers, truly appreciate it!!!!!"
Mollie E.,"Las Vegas, NV",56,34,1,4.0,10/21/2016,Fantastic service from Felicia. Went during the weekday at lunch and was in and out quickly. She was the perfect amount of helpful without being overbearing. I love BJs
Joann B.,"Henderson, NV",36,5,1,5.0,12/16/2016,"Mediterranean tacos are to die for!! Great service, exceptional food. Server Christina was awesome!"
