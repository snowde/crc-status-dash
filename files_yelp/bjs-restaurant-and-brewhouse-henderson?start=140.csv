Danielle M.,"Escondido, CA",3,51,9,5.0,11/2/2016,"We had our rehearsal dinner here, and it was perfect! The staff were very attentive, and quickly got our drinks and food just kept coming. Also, Joe the manager that took care of us was AWESOME! He was very professional and took really good care of us from start to finish."
Blake K.,"Henderson, NV",65,65,7,4.0,9/7/2016,"I had a deep dish Ravioli and it was excellent. Service was decent except for the hostesses who were a bit rude. Other than that, I had a very enjoyable dinner. Very nice restaurant in an upscale area."
Alisa P.,"Miami, FL",0,14,5,5.0,6/5/2017,Gianna had great service and served us with extreme happiness. Glad to have her bring us our food each time(:
mark k.,"Lakewood, CA",1,19,,4.0,4/28/2017,"BJs is usually a weekly stop for me. Enjoy the atmosphere and the food is always good. I am a beer guy and I love their beers, but at $6 a pop the bill stacks up quick. They currently have specials for each day of the work week  minus Friday. Monday is 1/2 off pizza, which if you like deep dish pizza is a fabulous deal, and Wednesday is $4 beer day another good deal. All in all this place is consistent and I will continue to frequent it."
Beth C.,"Henderson, NV",9,9,,3.0,11/10/2016,Food is nothing to write home about and the service was horrible. With all the great places to eat here in Vegas and Henderson you would think they would be better. Will not go back.
Ronald M.,"Henderson, NV",31,35,80,5.0,6/16/2016,Wait staff is always pleasant and the food is consistently great. Full bar and reasonable prices.
Cecellia M.,"North Las Vegas, NV",179,5,1,5.0,11/27/2016,"Been coming here for 3 years now and the food is always amazing, service is great, and I leave feeling fat and happy. Never fails to satisfy."
Judge X.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,31,2,5.0,4/19/2016,"This bj's has become a late night stop for us, and Rachel in the bar area always makes our experience here great. She remembers everything we drink and eat, and even the modifications. She's very attentive, always asks how we are doing,  and takes great care of us...it's nice to feel like you are welcome and wanted. So I only feel right giving her a 5star review.  However be warned, on Sunday night there is a snarky older lady with short hair,  in the bar area that makes you feel unwanted and like you are wasting her time, she walks away while you are talking to her as if she cutting you off and interrupts you as if she needs you to hurry up, on everything. We have tried to give her the benefit of the doubt a couple times but now   we just avoid going on Sunday nights."
Nicholas D.,"Las Vegas, NV",285,29,,5.0,11/23/2016,"I will usually go here on my lunch break and they staff never fail to get me out in perfect timing. I usually just sit at the bar and I have to say the lady bartender is without a doubt the best server/bartender that you could ask for. She is friendly, cheerful and just has the perfect personality. I have never had an issue with the food nor the service at this locations, so I recommend BJ's to most of my friends."
Kellene M.,"Henderson, NV",2,12,9,5.0,10/16/2016,Great place to relax and watch football. The Bloody Mary's are super delicious! Roy is a great bartender and goes the extra mile to remember orders of the regulars. He makes our dining experience very pleasant.
Mary R.,"Las Vegas, NV",213,90,73,5.0,1/28/2016,"Wow! Came here on a Thursday evening around 6:30pm. Place was full but no waiting! Our waitress was friendly and kind.  I ordered the Atlantic Salmon and my friend ordered Jambalaya. Food   our table in less than 10 minutes.  Everything was delicious and perfectly cooked.  Although we were full, we couldn't leave without trying the baked beignet."
Mark H.,"Honolulu, HI",1178,312,191,4.0,9/27/2013,"I came here following the recommendation of the sales rep at the Bells outlet mall.  It was a good distance away from the Strip, out in Henderson--possibly a 15 - 20 minute drive. We sat on the bar for quicker service.  We had the pleasure of having Emily serve us.  Emily was fantastic--very helpful, outgoing, and offering valuable recommendations.  Not to mention she is a cutie! =D Of course when in Vegas, I am always drinking.  And dinner here was no different.  My buddy chose the 4 beer sampler while I opted for the 8 beer version.  The 8 beer sampler totaled 40oz.  Not bad for a sampler!  And only about $12.xx to boot!  Beers were of your more obscure, microbrewery variety and all sooo good.  Got a diverse range of flavors and colors of beer. Not knowing what to eat (menu is quite extensive), we chose the thai chicken wonton based on its picture in the menu.  Tapa sized portions which worked out fine since I didn't want to get stuffed off an appetizer.  The wonton texture was crispy and flaky.  The accompanying thai sauce was a bit strong on the fish sauce--use in moderation.  Good consistency of sauce--don't like watery sauce softening the wrappings of my wontons...  It was good, but I wouldn't make a strong recommendation on it.  If you are in the mood for this, then order; otherwise, not a must have. My buddy ordered the deep dish pizza.  Not sure what was the name of the specialty pizza but he ordered the meaty version.  He liked it, but I'm a pickier eater.  I thought the pizza lacked flavor as if it needed salt which is quite surprising since meat on pizza is usually salty by nature.  Not so with this pizza.  was the meat boiled prior and the saltiness leached off?  idk....  Lots of cheese but nary of tomato sauce.  Need a better balance with sauce and cheese...   Bartender Emily's favorite dish at BJ's is their jambalaya.  With so many attractive entrees in their picture menu, I had a difficult time selecting my entree.  Warily, I went with Emily's recommendation and got the jambalaya.  Thank you, Emily, for your suggestion!  I rarely eat jambalaya so don't have a frame of reference to compare against, but this passed the taste test.  Unless you have an aversion to cajun spice, I think you will enjoy this dish. Tried the Pizookie for dessert.  Hot, large & thick cookie topped a la mode with ice cream.  The contrast of the cold ice cream on the freshly baked cookie is a winning combo! To recap, mixed reviews on their deep dish pizza, but the jambalaya, 8 beer sampler, and pizookie are winners!  Ohh, and Emily is a hottie!  With dozen's of locations throughout the US, BJ's could be a good spot to fall back on for a cheap-to-moderately priced meal.."
Mel D.,"Henderson, NV",10,12,8,4.0,4/7/2016,"Best food and service!!!! I sat at the bar and at a Deep Dish Favorite (mini) and got another once to go to eat the next day for lunch. The trio Pizzokie was super yummy as well. Because I started with the mozzarella and tomato salad (ate it all), then ate favorite mini pizza and ended with trio Pizzokie, I was more than full. I washed it all down with a Blonde. Incredible food, prompt and courteous service, definitely worth it."
Emily R.,"Las Vegas, NV",1770,1649,10800,2.0,8/14/2013,"I have to admit BJ's is probably one of my least favorite chain restaurants, so I'm never too excited to go to any location. I was meeting my OG Ryan B for lunch and I remember seeing a coupon for a large any style pizza so we couldn't resist.  We came around 12:45 and it was packed. We were seated in the bar area on a high top table and were greeted relatively quickly by our server and gave her our coupon and put our order in for a large five meat deep dish. They were a little slow getting our drinks and refills were a little hard to come by at first, as we had to remind her a few times for drinks. We also had to remind them that we needed silverware, sugar for my tea as well as red pepper flakes for our pizza. Service was friendly however and I cut them slack for being so busy.  As far as our pizza goes, it wasn't great. Not as hot and cheesy as I was hoping. Maybe a few more minutes in the oven would have added a crispiness that was needed. I definitely wouldn't have been happy about paying full price for the meal, but at half off it was ok. They took our coupon without problem and even gave us a free mini pizookie with our offer. This was my first time trying a pizookie and I wasn't blown away, but for free I was quite happy with it nonetheless.  I won't be back without a coupon, but at a discount this place will do in a pinch and I do enjoy their beer selection quite a bit."
Amy R.,"Depew, NY",155,44,19,3.0,9/11/2016,Went here for the first time Friday night for drinks and appetizers.  Our server was great.  I ordered a glass of Chianti and choked on the first sip.  It had turned; restaurants need to do a better job of keeping track of when their red wine bottles are open. I ordered a porter instead and that was much better.  We had 2 apps and the srirachi honey glazed Brussels sprouts were awesome!  The ambience was good for a larger restaurant.  I would come back again.
Veronà S.,"San Diego, CA",116,21,4,1.0,10/5/2016,Place an order of rib eye dinner & salmon dinner came up to about $50 . The meats where under cooked & I complain to the manager Kevin he gave me the run around then says I can only give you a $25 gift card . Horrible customer service & serves people under cooked nasty food . They don't care !!!
Kurt G.,"Denver, CO",198,227,110,2.0,11/24/2014,"So I'm not one to call anyone out so I won't. .. But the two star review is due to service I had both times here from the same server. Not horrible,  just unfriendly and not very attentive (at one point we went to the bar to get refills). Maybe it's because we were sitting on the patio.  Food here is good, nice selection, and i enjoy the in house made beers, but just kind of got the impression my being there was an inconvenience to the server. Solid three stars if not for the service. Womp womp."
Linda C.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,5,,5.0,11/6/2016,"I wanted to take my elderly aunt out for lunch today.  Since she requires a wheelchair, I need help with that.  We decided to call BJ'S and ask if they would assist us if we came by.  They couldn't have been more helpful.  The manager had a young man named Carlos come out and assist with the wheelchair.  We had a wonderful lunch.  My aunt had the chicken Alfredo pasta and I had the half California club flatbread pizza and salad.  All were tasty and enough to bring home extra!  Oh, we had the yummy appetizer, fried artichoke too!  Thanks BJ'S  You made my aunt happy and that makes me happy!  We will be back."
Cindy W.,"Royse City, TX",8,203,59,4.0,2/3/2016,"I came here with the family to support a school fundraiser.  I had never been here so I was looking forward to it.  We were seated right away and our server was pleasant.  Food was better than Applebee's, and the portions were huge!  For a family of 5, it was around $50, and that included the very affordable kid sized sundaes for my boys.  Love that they made the desert affordable since my kids are usually still hungry after meals and ask for desert but then take two bites.  Such a waste of money!  Great atmosphere, nice and spacious.  We will be back!"
Jennel G.,"Las Vegas, NV",316,85,7,3.0,3/22/2016,"Kiddos to me server Kris, she made this experience bearable!  Came in starving, only to find out Bjs has changed their portions on the salmon. Lunch is now, an appetizer :-(.  It was Dry and salty  Next time I want to leave hungry, I'll come for lunch"
