Tanya B.,"Henderson, NV",0,4,11,1.0,10/4/2015,A picture is worth a lot- Due to the contamination by poorly handled meat products in the kitchen others could be at risk.  Didn't have much concern for me- so likely didn't take much action behind the scene either.  Meat that raw is truly a danger. Oh but took off that meal and  1/2 off the pizza  and 1 root beer  -I was so nauseated we needed to get up and leave-but had to wait for card to be returned.  If I get sick there is proof in pics
Heidi M.,"Henderson, NV",9,165,78,3.0,11/8/2015,Clean and friendly service.  Food was okay-lacked seasoning.   Menu closely reflects the same items as the cheesecake factory.
Jane D.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,29,1,5.0,4/22/2017,We come here atleast once a week. Rachel at the bar is the best! She's quite the busy bee too. We love her.  We walk-in she already knows what we want. She has our drinks right as we sit. We came yesterday and Rachel was off another employee Justin took care of us. He was really worried about meeting our expectations which he successfully did. He knew we were regulars of Rachel and wanted to take good care of us. We order a somewhat confusing dish but Rachel and now Justin  always seem to get it right. There's another bartender that has taken care of us and i can't remember her name but she is just as good. Her smile is contagious. Thanks guys for always treating us like were VIP!
Mark J.,"Reno, NV",895,432,241,5.0,11/17/2014,The best Jalapeño burger in town!  Deep fried Jalapeños a half pound burger that is cooked to perfection! I have had it three times and each time it was awesome!
Kara H.,"Las Vegas, NV",22,29,6,1.0,11/23/2015,"Came for dinner with my husband. It was busy because of football, but we were seated right away. The server took 15 minutes to get our drink order. We were annoyed, but I try to cut servers some slack, especially on busy nights. When he finally showed up, he took our full order, which came really fast. He never checked in with us, and my husband had to chase him down for refills. Meanwhile, our waiter is actually sitting down at the table behind us, giving them his Facebook info so they can add him. This stuff is annoying, but had he pulled it together for the bill, we'd have given three stars. Clearly, that's not what happened. Instead he took 30 minutes to get our bill from us. At the 20 minute mark, my husband walked up to the waiter at a station and tried to hand him a card. Without looking up, he told my husband he needed to sit down and wait. We weren't trying to be pushy, but 20 minutes is a long time to wait for a bill, and we needed to leave. At that point I went up front and asked for the manager, who couldn't have cared less about what her employees were doing. Total waste of money and time."
Heather H.,"Las Vegas, NV",44,8,6,5.0,6/8/2015,Bry is awesome server!!  Greeted us right away and even letbus move to a booth! (:  Ordered our beers right off the bat and menu knowledge was strong. They got here quick and mmmmm berry cider brewed in house is to die for!! Ordered stuffed mushrooms and they were the best stuffed mushrooms I'd ever eaten EVER!!!  NEXT the tomato salad with yummi mozzarella balls and fresh tomatoes!!  And to finish the ahi ahi salad was so great!! Only.problem was I some how managed to get the whole glob of wasabi in one bite and just about died hahah. Next time no wasabi!! Over all bry was awesome and Justin another server also checked in on us(; they both rock. Thanks for an awesome time guys!!
Vivi F.,"Las Vegas, NV",58,53,295,3.0,10/29/2015,"Nothing amazing just another chain restaurant. OK drinks and OK, food. We sat at the bar and waited for our bar tender, I'll say we waiting to long. She only checked on us a couple of times, we were here over 2 hours talking and only got 2 drinks."
Bethany E.,"Henderson, NV",915,947,3691,4.0,4/11/2013,We planned a girls lunch and here I'm so glad we did!  I had the enLightened Thai Chicken Salad.  It was really good and under 575 calories!   Courtney was our waitress and she was excellent!  Our drinks never went empty even during the busy lunch hour!  Thank you for a great lunch! Tip: Sign up for BJ's Premier Rewards Membership before you go.  You get seated much faster and they immediately email you a coupon for a free mini Pazooki!
Victor J.,"Las Vegas, NV",86,16,,5.0,3/22/2016,"This place is off the chi-zang!!!!!!!!! We had Brandon as our server. He said we should try the Root Beer glazed ribs which were amazing by the way. This place was clean, the energy was good, the wait to be seated was not long at all. I can't wait to go back to try some more of the mouth watering food."
Mike B.,"Las Vegas, NV",678,242,796,4.0,7/29/2014,"Let's be honest, we come here for the Pizookie!   Ice cream layered on top of a giant cookie.  Mmmm. However this time around we also had regular food and beer.  Loved their ""blonde"" beer.   It paired well with my Cajun Pasta w/ chicken, a dish I highly recommend getting here.  We also tried their calimari which was standard.  My friend had the southern style fried chicken.  She said it was cooked and seasoned well and not greasy at all!  Great. There is a separate bar area, plenty of seating in a nicely dim room.  The ambiance was perfect for my group.  Our only small irk was that our server was sometimes not present when we needed him.  Trying to find him for the check after we were already full and ready to go was one thing.  Putting in my debit card with the bill and trying to find him AGAIN just to pay for the darn thing is enough to drop 1 star from this place.   Come for the great selection of beers and the food, keep an eye for your server or he might just get lost for some time."
Paulina M.,"North Las Vegas, NV",1,5,6,3.0,2/8/2017,I enjoy eating at BJ'S but this time the food was different compared to other times we've ate there.. but service is very good!
Jenny D.,"Las Vegas, NV",881,393,2599,3.0,3/31/2013,"After waiting in line for over an hour to see the Easter Bunny Mandi L. and I decided we needed a bloody mary! Hunnie Bunnie wanted ice cream, so BJ's it is!  First Mandi grabbed a booth inside but I thought we should sit outside to enjoy the beautiful weather. They set us up with a table but there was no umbrella shading it so it kind of sucked, but we decided to stay outside anyway. Another table said they were leaving soon so as soon as they did we grabbed their table and it was perfect.  Hunnie Bunnie had a scoop of ice cream and we enjoyed some spicy bloodies. They garnish these with a big ol' celery stick, a pickled green bean, an olive and a picked pepper. Not bad. Could have used some MORE garnish like a pickle, a beef stick, a piece of cheese... LOL but that's just how I personally like them: mini salad in my bloody glass!"
Katie B.,"Waikiki, Honolulu, HI",21,26,15,4.0,4/29/2016,"There desserts are the best!!!! Never have I ever had a bad experience. I recommend the bj's favorite pizza. Its  a deep dish pizza. The staff is awesome, they are pretty fast for always being busy. Which is a good sign :)"
Kalynn W.,"Henderson, NV",84,15,5,4.0,7/28/2015,"A group of my friends and I come here almost weekly. The service is always great, the food is usually delicious, and it's a nice restaurant for any occasion, really. The other night my boyfriend and I went around 11pm, and the host left a lot to be desired, she wasn't very friendly at all, but out waitress Michell was phenomenal. Not only did she give us her honest opinion on selections, she kept the refills coming and we never felt like we had to hunt someone down for something. Honestly, I want to start coming and asking for one of her tables, because she made us feel welcome even if it was rather late in the night and she had another huge table she was serving. I'd definitely recommend asking for her as your waitress."
Jasper h.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,17,,2.0,8/22/2015,"I have been here quite a few times and added a star because the service is great and the beer is solid, however the food is very weak. I first ate a BJs in Southern California about 10 years ago. The deep dish pizza was amazing; hot and fresh and very delicious, as was everything else. Now, the food at this location or perhaps at all locations is extremely subpar compared to what they used to serve. It almost always comes out room temperature and has obviously been pre-prepped and then slightly heated before being served. A deep dish pizza that comes out at room temperature is probably one of the most disappointing experiences a man can go through. However, if you can get the food made fresh, it is still great, but that's the problem. A couple visits back I had a dish that was as stated above, room temp and old. I let them know and they brought me a fresh dish; it was great. This is not how a restaurant should operate; especially not BJs, when the food can be great. I am pretty sure they keep this up because most people just accept it; sad. If you guys get your stuff together and start making the food fresh; let me know and I will give you another shot. Until then, no mas BJs for me. Why are people so accepting of this and still flock to this joint?!?!"
Jay S.,"Henderson, NV",0,7,,5.0,8/30/2015,Get RYAN as your waiter. Friendly knowledgable waiter. When u get a waiter like him it nakes my dining experience much more enjoyable. Food was enjoyable. Everyone is happy.
Roger E.,"Henderson, NV",0,88,1,4.0,1/20/2016,"Always been my favorite place to get something good. Casual, great service, eclectic menu, and priced right."
Chrystee Y.,"Las Vegas, NV",283,190,134,5.0,3/29/2016,One of my favorite restaurants of all time!! The people are fantastic! Customers and staff are so friendly!!! Food is out of this world amazing! I'd give 10 stars if I could!!!
Perry P.,"Las Vegas, NV",14,112,22,4.0,12/6/2016,"overall, this was great!  the food menu is starting to get bigger and bigger, similar to cheesecake factory.  hopefully it doesn't get too big, gets overwhelming.  the food was good.  we started with the avocado egg rolls and they came out very fast, which was nice.  the main concern was the service with our waitress.  to start, the entire lunch took less than 2 hrs, about 1 hr 45 min.  I think the biggest problem was our server...just slow and never around.  for example, one of us ordered unlimited soup and salad and the waitress never came around to refill the soup or salad.  when she did finally come by, we asked about a certain soup and she said she didn't know so she will bring a sample of it.  that alone took 10 min to bring a sample.  my friend liked the sample so he requested it and that took another 10 min.  we even had to tell her that we were in a hurry, but still no change in service style, she was never around.   on a plus note, the pazookie got more flavors/options (I think) and its still as good as I remember first having it.  definitely end with a  pazookie!"
Makena M.,"Las Vegas, NV",106,3,1,5.0,8/8/2016,"I love love love this place so much. the servers are always very understanding & nice. from the 100 something times I've been here, they've only gotten my order messed up 2 or 3 times. they always make the food amazing and the pizookies are so good!! I highly recommend everyone come here :)"
