Kelsey S.,"Henderson, NV",78,64,94,5.0,5/10/2016,"They recently updated their lunch menu only available Monday through Friday and it's so good! I ordered the chicken bacon ranch and meat lovers piadina and it's literally the best thing I've ever had here. It's like the fancy version of a hot pocket. I was pleasantly surprised by how good it was and I will definitely order it again. For drinks, we ordered the hand crafted margarita and the harvest peach margarita. The bar tender was not shy when pouring the margaritas, which made very happy. The peach margarita is seasonal and was my favorite of the two. If you're old enough, I recommend sitting at the bar - you're right in front of the TVs playing a variety if sports channels and have easy access to alcohol!"
A S.,"Palm Desert, CA",67,15,23,5.0,12/19/2015,"Came here last weekend with my boyfriend and sister. We got seated just before the dinner rush. This place is huge and can house plenty of people. Our order of cheese sticks were great and very tasty. We also shared an order of tomato, basil and mozzarella salad. It was extremely fresh.  Their club sandwich and fries that I got was just what I was craving. Really happy with our choice of going to BJ's. We'll be back next time we're in town."
Billy L.,"Monroe, MI",0,247,2,4.0,11/17/2015,"The beer here isn't too bad, but nothing spectacular. They have about ten or so house varieties to choose from. My hickory brisket and bacon sandwich was excellent.  Service was excellent and everything was clean and in good order."
Leslie M.,"Phoenix, AZ",376,605,376,3.0,9/1/2014,"Me and some friends strolled in on a Sunday afternoon.  They were serving brunch and the regular menu.  Oh-my, brunch, you say?  So I take a look at their brunch menu, but nothing I saw looked inviting so I decided to order the gluten free pizza with pepperoni, jalapenos, brussel sprouts, and mushrooms along with the beet arugula salad side.  The pizza was tasty and better than some gluten free pizzas I have had, but it was a little small and they were a little too greedy on the toppings - there was even one slice that had looked like it had nothing but cheese on it.   The beet arugula salad side was really just that - a side, but for $4.95, you'd think it would be more than 5 bites, right or is it just me thinking that it should be more like 10 bites?  It's just arugula, beets, some kind of nut, and dressing - so I would think they would be more generous.   All in all, it's a brewery - with ""ok"" food, but I did expect that."
Geselle R.,"Henderson, NV",907,392,4626,2.0,8/30/2014,Called to make a reservation and they told me to hold and they hung up on me. Called again and they didn't care that they hung up on me and gave me more attitude. Went in and they decided to give us even more awkward and not appealing attitude. Not coming back. Learn some manners. Looks are nice but that can only take you so far. Learn from the north town bjs. Not the first time I've had bad service here.
Mark N.,"Henderson, NV",430,45,32,3.0,6/9/2016,"Had the calamari and it was super greasy and did not taste good at all, had to send it back. Ordered the mahi-mahi with a shrimp. The server Kenneth is awesome"
Patsy S.,"Littlerock, CA",3,12,,5.0,7/8/2016,"Love BJ'S we are regulars and have dined in and picked up multiple times. Food is reasonably priced, Thier membership gives awesome discounts and promotional items. Stay is amazing expecially Tam or Nick they are amazing waiters. They always take great care of us!!! We have also sat at the bar and the bartender was great very attentive, he also made me a special drink based on my pallet. Sad they got rid of the thier greenbeans but they let us substitute. Again if u want great service ask for Tam or Nick!!!!"
Isaac O.,"Henderson, NV",3,20,7,2.0,5/6/2015,"Well, for those that don't want to read a novel I'll break it down: The food is really good.  The service SUCKS.  It was seriously dreadful.   Unfortunately we won't be coming back. I had dinner there last night with my parents.  We were all excited to go, cuz someone told us it was really good.  I really don't like leaving a negative review for places, but It was that bad. We came in about 7pm, and we went to the hostess stand.  She just kind of stared at us, and never greeted us.  Not a hello, nothing.  Ok, whatever, maybe shes having a bad night or something.  So we tell her that we'd like a table for 3.  The other hostess came over to seat us, and kind of dropped menus in front of us on the table and just left.  No ""hi"" or anything.  It was weird. The restaurant was a little busy, but there were still many open tables and a lot of FOH employees on the floor.  It was a normal dinner time type of busy.  Not anything extreme.  Our server comes over and gets our drink order, and right off the bat he seems to really not want to be there.  OhhhhKay.... do we like have the plague or something and not know??  We'd really like to know if we are contagious or something. The food DID come out quickly, and we really enjoyed our appetizer.  But, we would have enjoyed it even more IF WE HAD SILVERWARE AND NAPKINS.  Like we tried to get ANYONE'S attention to get silverware, but employes passed our table and glanced at us, then pretended not to see us!  omg!  So we used our 3 beverage napkins.  We seriously tried to obtain some utensils.  It was super lame.   A runner came out and delivered our meals, and then she tried to bounce out all quick!  So, we flagged her down as she was leaving and asked for silverware.  And I hate flagging down an employee because I think it's rude and tacky, but we couldn't get ANYONE'S attention any other polite way. Our server did keep our drinks topped off, but I would have loved to get another beer - but I couldn't!!!  I was never asked if I wanted another, and I could not get him to stay at the table for more than like 3 seconds.  By the end of our dinner, we actually laughed amongst ourselves because the service was unbelievably bad.  We actually felt uncomfortable there.  What sucks is we went there to enjoy ourselves, and the food was good.  But wow... we made contact with 4 employees there and they all seemed standoffish, unfriendly, and we got the feeling that they all hated their job.  Like they really hated it.  I'd go as far to say they despised working there.  I mean, is there like a horrible manager there that they all hate??  We felt like we entered the twilight zone.  As I stared longingly at my empty beer glass we got the 68 dollar check, paid and left.  At least, at this very point we got a ""thank you""!  That was nice, however too late to retain us as customers.  What's sad is we really enjoyed the food, but we felt very uncomfortable.  We were kind of annoyed that we felt obligated to tip, but we felt like it's just not right to not tip someone. So yeah... AKWARD!!!"
Candy R.,"Westside, Las Vegas, NV",478,92,797,4.0,4/8/2015,I love there late night happy hour. Really good food and drinks. Mojitos and wine are only 5 bucks and well drinks are 4 can't beat that and very fast service too. I'll be coming back for sure
Robert L.,"Henderson, NV",91,13,3,2.0,8/10/2016,"So I go to Bj's to have lunch with my Family on my day off, I get greeted and asked if I am a rewards Member I said yes! The Waitress come over and asked the same thing I said yes. I place my order she states I have ZERO POINTS before I get my food! I never asked for a discount so totally messed up my day already! Things should end in a positive at the end of your meal, thank you so much you have earned 1 point towards your future rewards card! is that hard. Plus the fact that her long hair was all over my food  I went to have a real meal friends sorry Bj's not cool."
Linda K.,"Lake Saint Louis, MO",0,6,6,5.0,1/21/2017,"Great food, wonderful server and atmosphere. Will be back when I'm here again from St Louis."
Jennifer D.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,5,,5.0,4/7/2016,"My husband and I came in for dinner with our two kids and my youngest was not happy. She was super hungry and cranky (9 months old).  I put in the kids order as soon as our waitress, Shennah (not sure if I spelt that right), came over. She came back with our drinks AND a starter for my kids. It was just a little kids starter but it was so appreciative and we've never had that given to us before. It made my daughter happy, and she devoured the fruit within a minute or two. We actually ended up ordering her an additional side because she loved it. Our food was good, but our waitress really made our experience enjoyable!  She went above what we have ever experienced there before and we will definitely be back. If you stop in ask for her section. You'll be in great hands!"
Paulina M.,"Henderson, NV",8,112,1,4.0,6/15/2016,BJ' restaurant is such a fun place to go for a casual lunch or dinner. I really do love the location as well and my children can not get enough of their pizzookies if I being honest neither can I! it is a diffident item to get!
Matthew H.,"Las Vegas, NV",10,16,2,1.0,2/27/2016,"Today put the icing on the pizookie. Over the past several years we have been eating here.  Our usual bill is almost $100 every time. For that kind of money I expect the food to taste better than fast food but not better than fine dining. I would have to say over the past six months that the quality in food and especially in service has hit rock bottom.  It seems to rank even below Applebee's or Chilis. I have vowed not eat eat there any longer and urge you to find somewhere else, maybe a locally owed restaurant to support."
Hayley P.,"Las Vegas, NV",54,13,14,5.0,11/18/2016,"Great service! My mom took my boyfriend and I here the other night to celebrate his birthday. We sat in a booth at the bar. Venue was very clean and had a cool industrial look to it. William ""bill"" was our server. He was very cool and professional. He took our drink orders first. I ordered the blood orange sangria, which was very tart until I put the cinnamon stick garnish into it, after that it tasted great! It was happy hour at the bar, so we ordered the California flatbread as an appetizer, which was delicious and portioned big enough for us to share! For dinner I ordered the ""super salad"" with flame broiled salmon which was AMAZING! The salmon had wonderful flavor and I loved all the different fruits and veggies in my salad. My boyfriend ordered a burger and my mom had the roasted Brussels and kale salad. They both enjoyed their meals as well! For dessert, my boyfriend had a mini chocolate chip pazookie, free for his birthday. Came with a birthday candle and smile from our server, thanks bill! And my mom and I shared half macadamia nut, half chocolate chip pazookie which was delicious! I would definitely come here again."
Marc R.,"Henderson, NV",0,9,,5.0,1/4/2017,"Always great food and service here!  The rewards program is awesome.  Kitchen a little slow when they're slammed but worth the wait.  Don't go to a big national chain for average fare, head in here and eat like a king!  Nancy is my favorite server, always takes great care of us!!"
J C.,"Las Vegas, NV",24,323,701,4.0,8/18/2015,Nice ambience. .. friendly service I was there few Days ago I wasn't too hungry but my wife was and she doesn't need too much unfortunately I forgot the name of the server she was very patient I'll explain the menu very well even helping me switching to another beer after I order one. I'll  be back!
J M.,"West Hollywood, CA",0,1,,1.0,4/19/2015,"Mediocre food. Mediocre service. I have tried othet BJs locations in the US which have been consistently good. Unfortunately I chose to have dinner last  night at the Eastern Ave location in Las Vegas with a friend. Wait for table was short as stated. Nicholas, our server, was dismissive and blamed the long wait for our food on inexperienced kitchen staff . When food finally came, IT WAS COLD. As it probably stood in the kitchen for at least 10 minutes. Requested onion rings instead of fries. Greasy and cold. Will NOT recommended and will NEVER eat at this BJs again. Do yourself a favor and go to In-n-Out Burger instead. Better tasting burgers and much better service because at least there you get what you pay for. Not at this BJs"
Jennifer M.,"Henderson, NV",201,33,79,3.0,2/6/2014,"I love the physical location. The revolving door, the huge wall of alcohol and beers -- its lovely :)  But the food is o-k. I have had mixed experiences with staff so that's why it gets a 3. There was twice where we had 2-3 different servers( people training i think)  then there was mass confusion.. And then there was a time where our server was on point.  Overall - its a safe place to go to get variety on American food - and the Pazookie (my fave is the red velvet) is the business!"
Emmalynn R.,"Henderson, NV",10,38,63,4.0,3/27/2015,I am upgrading my rating because of BJ's new menu which includes now more vegan dishes.
