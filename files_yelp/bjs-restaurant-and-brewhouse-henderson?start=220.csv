River H.,"Las Vegas, NV",139,165,126,3.0,5/14/2013,"It was Mother's Day, and after being dumped at the crepe shop, our group was feeling stood up and a touch angry- but were able to get a table at BJ's with a bearable wait time.  I was surprised with how good the service was on such a busy day. The service was slow, but everything made it's way out within 40 minutes of when our food order was placed, and amazingly there was not a single thing wrong with any of our food. Is it sad that I expect something to go wrong with someone's order in a large group?  This is a generic BJs, and the food is rarely ever anything that wows me so I was slightly disappointed that we had driven from NoLaVe to Hendertucky to get a pizza at BJs (huh.. hello.. we live around the corner from Old School Pizzeria!) but what really was outstanding was the service provided my the manager on duty. He was great in making sure our large group had enough room to dine comfortably, and even came back around to check up on us again. BRAVO! Finally, after a dry spell of awful service we have a day of good service, I had even started to feel like I was jaded about service. Will I be back? Probably not to this one since it's so far, but I have no problems visiting another BJs- we probably frequent the chain twice a year when I'm feeling too lazy to cook and we can't decide on anything."
April D.,"Las Vegas, NV",856,818,981,3.0,5/19/2013,"So this wasn't our first choice, or our second choice, or even our third choice. But it was lunch time on Mother's Day (I know...good timing), so we took what we could get without having to drive around town. They were really busy (I know, big surprise!), but they took really good care of our large party, the manager was our savior that day! The food was typical BJ's, I've eaten here before, Fridays/Chili's chain type food, it's average but not at all what any of us wanted (it's not their fault).  I was in dire need of a cocktail at this point, I got the Tickled Pick, a bit sweet but good. We all shared some of the Children's Captain Crunch French Toast, it was good but you couldn't tell it had Captain Crunch on it:( I ordered the Shrimp Tacos for lunch, they were surprisingly better than expected. South Eastern Avenue has such a wide array of food choices I doubt I'll be back anytime soon, but it works when your stuck between a crepe and a closed place. (Inside joke)"
Martin H.,"Raleigh, NC",48,84,34,4.0,1/21/2014,"I have been back a couple of times, to a couple of different locations, and I love this place. Busy - for a reason!  But I never have to wait very long.  The service has been very good, the food consistent and the quality very good. Very happy with the beer selection, I don't remember the name of the ""Red"" but it was awesome... 4.5 stars.  Recommended."
M K.,"Henderson, NV",2,9,1,4.0,4/5/2015,"Stopped in for dinner on our way from Town Square. The staff is always warm and welcoming :) Their mozzarella sticks are absolutely the best ones I've ever had - hands down. We tried the Tavern-Cut pizza. It was pretty good with great food textures including chicken, peperoncinis, basil, onions and more.  Overall, our meal was delish!"
Melissa C.,"Las Vegas, NV",54,22,8,4.0,3/24/2016,Always busy.  Too much spice this time on our regular entrees.  Service a bit slow. Would have liked prompt drink refills to take the edge off the food. Prefer West Charleston location.
Tiffany M.,"Lake Mary, FL",282,148,79,5.0,9/28/2014,I really love this place! It's always my go to... They have awesome low calorie options!! Like 20! Which is so rare! Also a good happy hour :)  Kale salad is really great for like 410 calories. I was surprised at how good it is... Prob is my fav thing I've gotten on the low calorie meal list so far
Janice L.,"Henderson, NV",340,185,16,4.0,12/17/2014,"BBQ Chicken Pizza! Root Beer crafted in-house? Berry spritzer?  I love love love their pizza and usually get the BBQ Chicken pizza (i'm a sucker for bbq)  The location is large and has ample amount of parking being in the Eastern plaza.  Great, friendly service!"
Winnie S.,"Southeast, Las Vegas, NV",15,50,80,2.0,1/5/2015,"I'm not sure if it was just today. They were really busy when we came in on a Sunday night. The last time I came here the portions were HUGE! Now it was a lot smaller. We ordered an asparagus and spinach dip, clam chowder, California Burger, and a bunch of other stuff those are just ones I really remembered.  The server looked nervous and rushed when he greeted us. We asked for a refill three times on our drinks and never got it.  Our appetizers, asparagus and spinach dip, came after 10 minutes after our main dishes. It tasted bland. And my brother who eats anything even said it wasn't good. There was no taste. My moms clam chowder was way too salty. My burger was not a burger but rather a sandwich. The vegetables along with the avocados was slipping out."
Bridget J.,"San Diego, CA",11,49,52,5.0,12/22/2014,BJ'S Brewery has always been a favorite.   I first discovered them in Tucson AZ.  Today in Nevada.  Great beer Grand Gru
Lea G.,"Las Vegas, NV",1503,455,323,4.0,3/7/2013,"It's BJ's!  They are the same everywhere.  Good service and good food.  My kids enjoy BJ's and talk me into it once in awhile.   I love their Avocado rolls and Lettuce wraps!!  Of course, how can you leave without eating a deliciously warm, melt in your mouth pizookie!!!"
Kennedy N.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,15,,5.0,1/17/2015,"Just went here for the first time. Service was VERY prompt and attentive, despite it being quite busy. Was in a party of 3, and everyone was happy with their meals. Drinks were refilled with perfect timing. Extensive menu options. Very nice portions for the price and good quality. Have not read any other reviews so I don't know if others have had complaints or not, but I have none whatsoever.  The only tiny mistake they made was that our appetizer came very shortly before our entrées. I will not let that take away a star however, because that too was delicious, and I simply used it to complement my main dish. Very satisfied experience overall. :) Thank you. - Ken"
Paul W.,"Miami, FL",876,1200,548,4.0,10/24/2012,"A business associate who works in Vegas invited me to dinner on a Thursday night.  Since he lives and works in this city, he didn't want to go anywhere particularly touristy, so he brought me here to this restaurant, which is about 5 miles away from the strip. BJ's is a national chain restaurant and microbrewery which is a bit like Gordon Biersch, but BJ's features a few more comfort foods on their menu and it has more of a family restaurant feel to it.  This restaurant is located in a strip mall-type location where there are several storefronts with bars and restaurants, and I get the feeling this must be mecca for many locals, as the parking lot of the entire complex was packed on this night, and we had to wait 20 - 25 minutes for a table for 2 at 7:30 on a Thursday. I tried their Pumpkin Ale (one of my favorite fall beverages) and was a fan.  For our meal we shared an order of their Ahi Poke which was delicious and really hit the spot since I was very hungry.  For dinner, my friend had the chicken fried steak, and on his suggestion I had the old fashioned pot roast which was served with white cheddar mashed potatoes, mushroom gravy and veggies. Everything I had was excellent, service on this night was very good aside from one slip up (they only gave us one set of cutlery and it was difficult to find a service staff to get a second set).  I'd like to return to one of their locations at some point to try more of their other microwbrews."
Terri A.,"Las Vegas, NV",76,33,16,2.0,12/5/2014,Server could've been more attentive.  Sat in dining area instead of bar.  My steak too done.
Jamie B.,"Southeast, Las Vegas, NV",471,75,290,5.0,10/11/2015,"awesome food, excellent service... every. single. time. consistency is very important to us and this place is probably #1 on the list! whether we do delivery, curb-side pick up or dine-in we love us some bj's"
James W.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",1,7,,1.0,9/19/2014,I like BJS but this location sucks takes for every to get any thing. Servers got their nose in the air. Food gets messed up.. I've been to this location three times same story.. Good luck to all that go to this location you'll be there for awhile..
Jay J.,"Las Vegas, NV",175,539,427,4.0,3/13/2011,"We really liked it, it was our first time there.   We really liked the beer, lots to choose from.   We ordered the Itialian Salad, and the pulled pork sandwich with skinny fries.  The salad was good, the salad dressing that came with it was very light. But the pulled pork......ummmm, ummmm, ummmm, ummmm ummm!  there was so much that I wanted to try, so I know i will be back.  Very nice place to go, you can go wih jeans or a suit.....I even saw a girl in sweats. Deserts looked awsome.....I will be going back one day soon, just to try the desert."
Mazlina P.,"Los Alamitos, CA",10,14,17,5.0,1/4/2015,Wonderful experience tonight.  Pizza was extraordinarily delicious. Good-looking staff in smart outfits were efficient & attentive service. Deco & ambience were outstanding.    Will come again for family outings & staff happy hours.
John Z.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,5,,1.0,6/18/2014,"If I could put zero stars I would. Terrible EVERYTHING.I would rather have eaten rocks from a homeless persons shopping cart. California apparently means bread + burnt party. On the upside it was precut making its terribleness much more apparent. After numerous terrible talks with the waitress I finally obtained items which were listed on the menu.  It was rewarding to build my burger to my taste as I felt a sense of accomplishment but I digress. Luckilly planes fly over constantly and it gave me hope one might by chance crash into the restaurant and end my dinner early, proper."
Gracie S.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,10,,5.0,8/24/2016,"Went to BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse last night, as usual their food is excellent, but what seriously stood out was our waiter, Nick.  He's outstanding - he ran his backside off for everyone he waited on.  He even noticed when the server delivered the wrong order to the table, he made it right even though we told him it wasn't necessary.  WOW!!  When I complimented him on his EXCELLENT service, he told us we could ask for him the next time we come in.  I recommend everyone do the same, you will NOT be disappointed.  That said, tip him well, all waiters/waitresses depend on it!!!"
Art M.,"Las Vegas, NV",127,18,2,5.0,8/21/2015,Great food and spirits I usually sit at the bar and always a+ service Emily is the best bartender in this place.
