Erin Q.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,27,1,2.0,8/17/2014,They will not fill any growler that is not from BJs. They want you to buy a BJs growler first. This was disappointing because if you walk into ANY other brewery and hand them any growler... They will fill it.  I'm trying to give you my money. Why won't you take it?
Jenna W.,"Henderson, NV",0,13,2,4.0,8/15/2016,"We are new to town and received a gift card from friends. They easily and quickly sat our large family (and saw lots of large groups). The menu is huge with lots of options suit your mood. You can also select a couple small plates, soups, and salads. We had the avocado egg rolls which were great. The kids menu is great. Lots of healthy choices for all and very vegetarian/vegan friendly options. My husband liked the beer choices and ordered a tasting flight. Overall affordable with generous portions."
Rob R.,"Henderson, NV",0,15,4,1.0,12/10/2015,This place is not great during dinner time. I came here today and asked for a booth for 5. After a 20min wait we are seated at a table. We asked for a booth then we were told we can wait for a booth to open up. It's would of not been a big deal but I have had this happen 3 times in the past week so this made me finally give up on this place. I'll still come for lunch but not for dinner.
Michael C.,"Henderson, NV",0,28,,1.0,8/16/2015,"Unbelievably horrible service, ordered grilled chicken with all topping when I repeated three times what I exactly wanted only and second time they sent it on a hamburger bun not even cooked when it says it comes on sourdough.  Jaime the manager then blamed me for the mistake cause she said I repeated it to you like I'm the idiot. Avoid this place at all costs like I will in the future. Their are too many good restaurants on Eastern avenue to choose from to spend your hard earned money. I wish I could leave zero stars because they failed tonight 8/16/15."
Denise T.,"Las Vegas, NV",12,35,19,5.0,10/18/2014,"I love the pizookie!!!! The cookies and cream is my favorite.  I've been so sick and at midnight I start getting some appetite back, I really wanted a soup but where can I get one at midnight?  Luckily I don't live too far from this lovely restaurante and it was open till 1 am to order. I always have to have their tortilla soup. So I was glad I was able to get to go at 1am. What isn't there to love about this place?"
Kerry J.,"Henderson, NV",1,51,33,4.0,7/5/2016,"We went with Family on Friday night for a Birthday dinner and Happy Hour. We had a wonderful server named Paula. Paula was the BEST server I have seen in a long time. She made us feel like we were family and anticipated our every need. The food was good, but the Happy Hour needs help. Happy hour is only good on Mondays for the 1/2 price pizzas, otherwise they need to work on better pricing for expensive beer, and very few choices for food."
Carly J.,"Las Vegas, NV",6,67,12,4.0,3/11/2015,"Although wait time can be a little long, They always have amazing service! I have tried numerous things on the menu, but somehow always resort back to their famous cheese and tomato pizza! Love it and will continue to come here. Always gotta have their pazookie!!! You're missing out if you haven't had one"
Karole R.,"Henderson, NV",486,148,1836,4.0,6/1/2014,Food was worth the money- larger sizes. Menu is wayyyy to large and could be downsized or split in an AM PM vs having 10 pages of food chooses. The interior was well thought out w wide range of art. We had 4 different burgers all were great. Love the different French fry options
daniel g.,"Las Vegas, NV",5,11,2,3.0,8/1/2015,"I am a local. That is I was born here. Since BJ's open I've been here a lot and by that I mean weekly. I would say 2 out of 5 times it goes wonderfully, but 2 out of 5 is why I don't come here as often is why I don't come here as often  but it is convenient  and most people are satisfied. And rightly so they do have some excellent things before they change the jambalaya it was my very favorite. And the Jeremiah red is the best micro brew available in a restaurant chain. I am @ at BJ's today with my mother in law and enjoyed a mushroom Portobello swiss burger rare the first time it came out was not correct however the server rectify the situation quickly and I had a wonderful meal. But he insisted to call the manager over which seemed rather unconcerned  with  problem with the food. Despite the lack of managerial assistance the meal went great."
Lawrence H.,"Henderson, NV",0,3,,5.0,8/28/2015,"BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE I have received in a long time.  The menu is to die for, everything on it is exceptional, they will be seeing a lot more of me and my family.  They went above and beyond with their service. They forgot we were outside on the patio and extended every possible  courtesy to make our visit worth while.  Paula was our server and she was PHENOMENAL if anyone goes there please make sure you ask for her section you won't regret it."
Derek F.,"Pompano Beach, FL",393,246,45,5.0,7/12/2015,Solid place I always love BJ's... Either get the balsamic chicken or the Parmesan crusted chicken always a good choice don't forget the Brussels sprouts!!
Cissy B.,"Henderson, NV",0,8,,3.0,8/2/2016,"We have been having dinner at BJ's a couple of times a month for the past couple of years. The food and service are always good and we enjoy the vibe of the restaurant. So dinner last night was delicious as usual. We got the bill and paid cash, expecting change back. The server returned $0.50 of the $6.47 we expected. Granted, a 20% tip was going to be $6.20 and we normally tip well, but we didn't tell her to keep the change. And she gave us back 2 quarters! I don't know what to think except that we decided we wouldn't plan to go back again...ever. It should have been up to us to leave the tip."
Fred U.,"Henderson, NV",1,25,1,5.0,7/24/2015,I have been to several other BJ Brewery around the country and they all mainly behave like typical chain restaurant where the servers don't care and food is horribly prepared.  This restaurant is different. The servers are friendly and professional. Food is not too salty or greasy. I recommend this restaurant because they care that customers are happy. They show that they want customers to return.
Marissa V.,"Henderson, NV",7,13,8,1.0,5/31/2015,"Used to love this place but it has just ran completely downhill, and I will not return. Yesterday (Saturday) I went to lunch around 4 o'clock and was so disappointed. First, upon walking in we were greeted warmly, which was nice. Then, when I requested a booth the hostess seemed put out, but we were seated at a booth regardless. We waited 7 minutes to be greeted by a server. Once we were finally greeted, we were informed we didn't get greeted because the hostess put us in a section that didn't have a server and failed to inform someone to pick our table up. Ok, I guess. At least it wasn't the servers fault. When we finally order, I ordered their enlightened turkey burger, and asked for our sever (I believe his name was Steve or Steven) to ring it in just as a turkey burger with lettuce, onion, and avocado. My guest ordered the California club. When our food finally arrived, we both take a bite out of it, as we were starving. To our dismay, both of our orders are wrong. My turkey burger is not a turkey burger at all, but a veggie burger. (Granted, this veggie burger was tasty. I definitely recommend for vegetarians.) My guest takes a bite out of her sandwich, which doesn't have the bacon or tomatoes on it it is supposed to have (and that is pictured.) I send my not-turkey burger back and her sandwich. The server apologizes, and we wait. My burger finally arrives, and it is still wrong. The toppings that are supposed to be on the burger, are not. My server goes and gets the toppings that are supposed to be on it and returns a few minutes later. Situation rectified. My guests sandwich finally arrives, with the bacon and tomato, but they didn't replace the sandwich? They bring back the same sandwich with her bite still taken out of it? I'm not sure how sanitary that is that the cooks are touching foods that have been partially eaten and sending it back out!  Although all three mistakes were remedied, I'm severely disappointed a manager did not stop by the table to at least apologize or table tough at all. Our server was not bad, as I'm sure these were errors in the kitchen. Ultimately though, I'm disappointed and will not be returning to BJs due to the consistent errors."
Addy L.,"Las Vegas, NV",134,118,80,3.0,4/7/2013,"BJ's makes due when you're with a group of people who are all craving something different. Although the food is mediocre, there's something for everyone. I've been here several times, but my most recent visit was Saturday after the Spartan Race. We were a group of 6. We started with nachos, potato skins, and wings. Potato skins and wings were pretty good. The nachos were okay.. I was craving pizza so I got an individual 5 cheese pizza with pepperoni. Half of the pizza was good. The reason I say that is because the whole inner half was soggy. A complete mush, so I was only able to eat half. Had a chocolate chip pazookie for dinner. Yum! Service was really good."
Scott D.,"Henderson, NV",50,10,,1.0,4/27/2014,"There is a reason this place is called BJ's. Once you've had it in your mouth, you won't want to swallow! For some unknown reason, when my coworkers want to go out for lunch, they always want BJ's. Every time we have gone there, the service was atrocious. We wait forever for our food and some of us get served 10 minutes before others. The food is mediocre and generic at best. One time I ordered baby back ribs and they were literally the worst ribs I have ever had. They were undercooked and tough (ribs should fall off of the bone) and had absolutely no flavor. There was very little barbecue sauce on them and I ended up leaving hungry. My wife ordered a pasta dish (how hard is it to ruin a pasta dish?!) and it had no flavor. She had to dump a large quantity of salt on it just to make it palatable. On top of that, the waitress was very rude and inattentive.  Another thing I hate about the place is the TVs everywhere. When I go out with friends, I want to spend time talking with them, not watching TV. TVs in restaurants are very distracting and you find yourself looking at them even if you have absolutely no interest in what is being shown (our brains are actually wired to focus attention on movement).  My advice is to avoid BJ's (at least this particular location) and go to McDonald's. At least it will be fast and you know what you are getting!"
Louisa M.,"Las Vegas, NV",890,1080,6699,2.0,3/29/2013,"I decided to give this place a try last week and I may or may not ever go back. The food was good (I ordered my food low carb: a double cheeseburger without a bun and a side of broccoli instead of fries). The kitchen was very accommodating and didn't give me a hassle about the substitution. The burger was really good and had a nice chargrilled taste to it. My problem was with the portion size of the broccoli. I know veggies are more expensive than potatoes, but COME ON! I was served 5 little florets of broccoli; one was cut in half to try to fill the empty space more. (See the photo I uploaded). I took a picture of my plate the minute it was served to me. Was there a broccoli shortage or something? I thought that was ridiculous.  The menu isn't too varied but they seem to have lots of pizza options. The ""brewhouse"" element of the place is really played down. They have a few beer tanks in the far back corner that are hidden out of view.  The food was good, the ambiance was fine, but the service was absolutely horrendous! We weren't greeting when we walked in the place for about 10 minutes -- on a Saturday afternoon around 1:30 pm! This is a busy time and restaurants need to have on their ""game face."" When we finally were greeting, we got a nice table but then we had to wait and wait and wait for a server to greet us. Finally, after 15 minutes, we were approached. We ordered drinks...and then had to wait and wait and wait to get them! Finally we ordered our food, which took over 30 minutes to arrive. People at adjacent tables were all complaining (loudly) about how bad the service was. Our waiter disappeared for the entire meal, and we finally had to get up to go find somebody to ask for our check. It was abysmal. There were plenty of employees around, but our waiter was HORRIBLE. I don't know if I'll ever go back because the service was just so bad."
Paul W.,"Las Vegas, NV",340,898,440,4.0,6/6/2012,BJ's has an extensive menu with something for everyone.  When you can't decide where to dine it will always work in a pinch.
S P.,"Henderson, NV",41,48,20,5.0,7/22/2015,"Every time I go the food is great and the wait staff is always amazing and so patient and attentive. The shrimp tacos, French dip sandwich and deep dish pizzas are so good!"
Alana F.,"Round Rock, TX",295,109,62,4.0,5/23/2012,"Ok so I went here with my bf and our lil man for dinner one night, I hadn't been their in like 10 yrs so it was pretty much all new to me.  We were sat immediately.  Our waiter who was super nice took our drink orders and we also decided to order an appetizer.  We ordered pot stickers for the appetizer.  The pot stickers were very tasty.  As for my main course, I decided to order the baby back ribs.  The ribs were very flavorful, and very meaty.  I had a baked potato (loaded) as a side which was also tasty.  My son ordered mini kids corn dogs, which he enjoyed.  My bf ordered a steak which he devoured quickly so I guess he liked it.  Than again he devours everything quickly.   Overall this place exceeded my expectations.  I would come back again.  The food was delicious, good quality, with huge portions, and our server was awesome."
