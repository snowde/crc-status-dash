Jessica M.,"Henderson, NV",20,35,11,4.0,10/13/2014,"Love! Love! Love!  The pazookis are ridiculously amazing. Seriously a must have. Yummy pizza :)  I always end up getting beer, appetizers and of course the pazookis. Excellent customer service no matter what time. I usually end up here with the girls around 11pm and they are always super friendly!"
Jason R.,"Henderson, NV",3,111,12,4.0,12/27/2015,The pizza is outstanding! Their berrs selections are great. Too bad they haven't built a location near the Galleria Mall
Chris M.,"Henderson, NV",0,8,1,5.0,3/24/2016,"I visited BJ's two nights ago solo with my two small kids. We had to wait a bit as it was a busy spring break night, but upon seating we were immediately greeted by our server, Dan. Dan was speedy and courteous and kind, and our food came out really quickly! Everything was delicious but what made the experience over-the-top great was Dan's professionalism, patience and kindness during our meal. Mid-dessert, my youngest needed to use the restroom so we asked Dan to make sure no one cleared the table while we were away. When we returned, we saw that Dan had made a fort of napkins and empty metal pitchers with a handwritten sign ""DO NOT TOUCH"" over the half-eaten pizookie plate. We laughed so much. The best customer service we've received anywhere in recent memory! Thank you, Dan!"
David W.,"Henderson, NV",12,3,,2.0,6/29/2016,"Non-priced mix drink menu, said it was a corporate decision to leave off prices. But the server thought they went up from 6.95 to 11.00. I don't buy any product with an unknown price until you see the bill. Warm Root Beer in a chilled glass doesn't make for a cold Root Beer on a hot day, it's still warm. Pizza was good, but can do much better food for less price elsewhere. Lots of wait staff running around, not busy, but not very good attention to us at the tables. Slow to acknowledge the table and in a hurry to leave it when you try to order. Never mentioned any specials that I hear they always have. Another typical young crowd hangout who don't care about experience and quality. Too many other choices around to frequent this place. No more for me."
Vinny P.,"Henderson, NV",0,10,1,3.0,12/18/2015,"We meet at BJ's a lot after work. Food is good and their selection of draft beers is huge.  I belong to their points club, just got a free dinner. Nice perk. The bartenders are well educated which helps when wanting to try a new pour."
Rockne H.,"San Francisco, CA",765,639,2595,5.0,11/18/2012,"Man, I totally made a mess of the evening before, so I had to meet a friend to work out a situation.  We wanted to go to a place that had great food and a great vibe...that I've never been to.  Ok, so I can't lie and say that although we had to talk about something important, a small part of my decision to go to BJs was because A.) I haven't been there, B.) I heard it was really good and C.) It would give me the opportunity to make a review on Yelp :) This place has a huge buzz, well at least from what I experiences.  True it was on a Saturday night but the place was packed with people, the lighting was hip and the overall vibe made me excited to be there!  They have their own signature brews and offered many menu options?  Uh, yes please!  Our server was quite but didn't a good job.   For my first visit, here's what I got: Drinks: A couple of glasses of the Piranha Pale Ale.  It's a hoppy ale and had a snappy flavor.  Apparently this beer took Silver in some American beer festival in the past, so I had to try it.   Appetizer: For the table, we got the Thai Shrimp Lettuce Wraps.  Grilled shrimp glazed with spicy Thai sauce, served on a bed of Napa cabbage, cilantro, carrots and red onion, all tossed with a fresh, minty mango salsa and sprinkled with toasted coconut. Served in butter lettuce cups with a spicy Thai sauce for dipping.  The shrimp to everything else ratio was great and the sauce really pulled all the components together.  Sooo good!  A little messy but I definitely looked passed that! Meal: For my meal, I got the New enLIGHTened Thai chicken mango salad.  Grilled, marinated chicken breast, chili spiced jicama and mango strips, red bell peppers and red onions on a bed of mixed baby greens, bibb lettuce and arugula tossed in a sweet citrus-chili dressing and topped with fresh sliced avocado, mint, green onions and sesame wonton crisps.  Trust me, that description was taken from BJs' website, I'm not that good at descriptions, however, I am good at giving my take on it.  Probably one of the best salads I've ever had.  The spiced jicama complimented the sweet mango and the bell peppers gave a crisp texture.  This salad was packed with seemingly clashing components but it all worked well together.   So for all of you who want to know, yes, we worked out our differences and made a possible bad situation into a completely better one.  I definitely think the food had something to do with it.  The place had a great buzz and I can't wait to come back!  Thanks guys!!"
L J.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,222,20,5.0,8/25/2014,"This location is just down the road from me and I'm usually there on a Sunday evening for our date-night. We sit at the bar because honestly the 2 bar tenders that usually serve us are great. I feel so bad that I can't remember their names (considering I go at least 4 times a month!) but I'll be sure to ask next time!  The girl makes great margaritas and the guy is really good with food recommendations. They just have a great energy and are very amusing, just as bar tenders should be. We'll see you soon for pizza and pizookie...try the salted caramel one, it's the best (and I usually fight my man til the last bite)."
Dru S.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,9,,5.0,6/21/2016,"BJ's is a nice bar. They have no video poker and are completely non smoking, which is nice in Vegas because most bars have video poker and smoking. The food is pretty good for bar food and the beer is definitely above average for brewpubs."
Danny R.,"Oakland, CA",66,19,8,1.0,4/16/2014,I'm writing this as I wait. Its approaching 30 minutes that I have been waiting (no exaggeration) for the $5 Mac and cheese. The couple next to me has had a drink and then ordered and then got their food before me. I'm not really sure why I haven't asked for a refund yet.. Its sad because the food is really good. But I feel like the biggest sucker every time I come here. They are consistently slow with the service and food delivery. Its to the point where I have made friends with other people eating here because we start joking about how sad this wait for our food is. I've given them the benefit of the doubt a few too many times.  This location seriously needs to get it together.
Tesha K.,"Las Vegas, NV",16,68,38,5.0,7/15/2015,Quality customer service. I really enjoyed the kindness and conversation from Justin at the bar and the enlightened salmon bowl was the perfect healthy dinner. Keep up the wonderful work!
Jennifer P.,"Las Vegas, NV",176,282,212,3.0,7/13/2014,"It's BJ's Brewery, a huge chain establishment, but the food is always good and they have a huge variety of items! The service is consistent- staff is friendly and attentive. The parking lot is always a lil chaotic- this whole shopping center can be a mess...."
Brian B.,"Anaheim Hills, CA",426,698,43,4.0,6/5/2014,"It's BJs, what I would expect, not like I haven't eaten there before.  Only 4 stars because of the problems with the bill. We, a very large group, were at a conference and BJs was there hyping their restaurants.  I can eat a BJs at home, why would I want to go to Vegas to eat at a hometown chain? Well, very large group and they offered us a 20% discount...  Still, I would rather have spent the same 4 figures at restaurants on or near the strip.  When the bill came, they did not want to honor the discount promised. In the end they finally gave in, but still it was more than a half hour fighting with the manager."
Jessica P.,"Beaverton, OR",66,300,,4.0,4/30/2012,"BJ's has to be one of my favorite chain restaurants in Vegas! They have incredible lunch specials and literally everything on the menu is good. My husband and I eat here at least once a month. We usually share a small pizza, which is plenty. They serve deep dish style pizza, while not exactly reminiscent of Chicago it is no doubt delicious. There isn't really sauce on the pizza, but there are tomatoes which I tend to push aside. The pizza is best complimented with a delicious Cobb salad. This salad is fantastic with a creamy garlic dressing, croutons, turkey, avocado, and cheese. I also enjoy their sandwiches and you really can't go wrong with their wedge or shoestring fries. I haven't tried anything that I didn't like and they have quite an extensive menu. It is seriously delicious American style food. If you find yourself here you really must get a Pizookie for dessert, it is required and I often come here just for a Pizookie! Who doesn't want a warm chocolate chunk cookie with vanilla bean ice cream? So unbelievably yummy.  I have received spotty service at times, but overall BJ's is a fantastic go-to restaurant if you want quality, affordable, and delicious food that everyone will love."
Ashley C.,"Sparks, NV",0,14,1,5.0,11/23/2016,"This was our first time eating out as a family after discovering our 6 year old has all sorts of food restrictions.  It was a little nerve wrecking but it turned out great.  When we arrived I asked for an allergy menu.  It was super easy to use.  We ordered a gluten free pizza with mozzarella cheese (not the normal 5 cheese blend because my son can't have aged cheeses like cheddar).  The manager, Joe, came out shortly after to let us know they didn't have shredded mozzarella but 'pearl mozzarella balls' and asked if that would be alright.  We were just so happy they could accommodate us we didn't care.  Pizza came out and my tiny eater ate almost the entire thing!  Joe came back to check on us to make sure everything turned out ok.  We were so appreciative of the personalized treatment.  Our server was also fantastic as she was peppered with questions by us about everything.  I'm so sorry I forgot your name to give you proper credit.  Of course, the rest of our food was great and my other two boys devoured all their food as well.  Thank you so much BJs!!!"
Tyler H.,"Southeast, Las Vegas, NV",326,32,7,4.0,8/13/2015,Had the unlimited soup and salad which was awesome! I could only make it through 3 salads and 3 soups. Best being the tomato mozzarella salad and the tortilla soup. I was a bit disappointed they were out of their home made root beer!!
Jennifer J.,"San Francisco, CA",303,159,208,3.0,3/15/2014,"It's BJ's.. A giant chain so the food is going to be generic and nothing amazing. Even though I only gave them 3 stars this is a positive  review.  I can't say i like the food but i don't hate it. In large establishments, I expect consistency and quick service which they seem to have. I've been a few times and the service seems good. I would recommend it if you have a picky eater because most chain places are made to please the masses.  I didn't mind the happy hour. Good options for good prices but it's nothing to rave about.  The parking is decent but a little chaotic. This whole shopping center can be a mess."
Tida C.,"Las Vegas, NV",1186,157,875,5.0,1/30/2012,"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE BJ'S!  Food: I love the Cajun Pasta, Usually when I go out to eat I'm not very adventurous. I like to stick to what I know but for some odd reason I decided to try something new. Cajun pasta, hmm first off I wasn't to sure how I would like this because I love Cajun spices of on my seafood but I wasn't to sure how I'd like it on my pasta. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT. The creamy tomato sauce with the roasted blacken chicken breast YUMMMM. The portions are even great, once me and my boyfriend went and we actually just ordered 1 Cajun pasta and when asked them for an extra plate because we were sharing they offered to just put it together in the kitchen for us & it was perfect for two!  Desert: If you haven't tried Bj's famous Pizookie your missing out. A cookie that's freshly baked right out of the oven warm topped with Vanilla ice cream is to die for. Even when I'm stuffed from my entree i'll still find room for a Pizookie. Some how! lol Drinks: I love their wide range of beers on tap, unfortunately they didn't have the blue moon pumpkin beer because it's only a seasonal beer. Tap beer is always better then bottle or canned Just saying... Service: I  usually go pretty late like 9:30-10ish? & I'm usually 1 out of 5 tables there. So its not busy during those hours but the waitress that we got was super nice. The hostess seated me and my boyfriend at a table that was just way to big for us and it made it difficult for us to kind of talk and dine together so the waitress noticed this and asked if we wanted to change tables. Other than that and when ordering she offered to tell the cooks in the back to split my Cajun pasta into two plates because I was sharing. I've never been to a restaurant where they offered to split it in the back for me. Usually they just hand me my extra plate so I really appreciated the extra effort to help :)"
Melanie S.,"Henderson, NV",12,2,,1.0,2/26/2015,Was there recently and usually when I go everything is fine but this time I ordered chicken wings my usual fave and got the worst food poisioning from them  staff need to retake their health card quiz and know how to handle chicken properly so people don't become deathly ill!!
Kim M.,"Las Vegas, NV",8,8,3,2.0,3/22/2015,Food is so good. It's a shame they can't figure out how to provide the ultimate customer experience. Empty coffee and no silverware is not acceptable for that warm fuzzy feeling !
Sandra F.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,22,15,5.0,8/17/2014,"Love the food here and huge selection of beers.  Its hard to find a bar/restaurant with good food but u will definitely find both at BJs. I recommend their flatbreads, burgers,  and for an appetizer I would go with bruchetta... so good!"
