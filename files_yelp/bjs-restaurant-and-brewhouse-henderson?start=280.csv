Ruth And David R.,"Las Vegas, NV",17,23,1,5.0,12/13/2014,"Went there only once so far and we had a very good lunch. Prices aren't bad and the food and service was very good. Wanted to try the hard cider but didn't want to get a glass full, so the server brought me a sample, (Ugh!) Not for me. Ill just stay with the cold beer, Thank you. Will be back soon."
Jason W.,"Las Vegas, NV",91,93,173,4.0,5/14/2014,"BJ's is great for happy hour in the bar area. Great prices during this time. They have a few drink specials and food menu items. order a mini pizza, lettuce wraps, flat bread something with avocado,  and mini sliders.  it was filling for three people that we had and it was a little disappointing with the lettuce wraps and there was only three pieces of lettuce and to me lettuce is the cheapest thing as it was just head lettuce or ice burg as they are called. I had a glass of there root beer from tap and a glass of the black cheery from tap as they make there own.  They had some kind d of santa fe spring rolls and avocado roll also on the menu and some kind of parmesan boneless chicken.  If you go at four pm it is just the right time as they are not busy, but the service was kind of slow, but if you are there with people great chance to chat and catch up without being rushed, as the service is just the right speed at this time of day before the dinner rush.  Will need to go back to try the other happy hour specials that I haven't tried yet. tried the full dinner menu items as well and they have a lot of choices to chose from. menu is quick large, and plenty items to chose from. pizza is alway yummy and there salad are good too. Enjoy!"
Kara C.,"Las Vegas, NV",126,15,14,3.0,10/27/2013,"If I had written a review 6 months ago I'm sure I would have given BJ's 5 stars, however, my last few visits have left somewhat of a bitter taste in my mouth. The food and drinks here are always more than great, but the service which used to be just as good no longer lives up to my expectations. Both of my last visits were on slow nights where we were one of only a handful of tables in the restaurant.  Now I work in the service industry so I can understand certain situations but being that our server only had a couple other tables I cannot grasp the fact that he kept disappearing for lengthy periods at a time. When we first arrived he greeted us in a timely manner and brought us our waters. We then ordered an appetizer to share while deciding on our entrees. Almost 20 minutes went by before we saw our appetizer or our server again. He dropped off the appetizer in a hurry, didn't ask if we were ready to order (which we were) and proceeded to disappear again. We were done with our appetizer for 5 minutes before he finally reappeared and took our order. The food was great but we just couldn't understand where he kept disappearing off to. We even had to flag down other servers to get things we needed, like refills for our constantly empty waters (biggest pet peeve).    This experience won't necessarily stop me from returning because as I've mentioned I love the food, but I certainly hope they do something to improve their lacking service."
Carla R.,"San Diego, CA",0,5,,5.0,5/24/2016,"We have been to this particular restaurant 3 times this year.  Food is great,  Stevie is friendly and knowledgeable and process reasonable (don't tell them,  they msy raise them! ). Love that jambalaya!"
Stephen K.,"Las Vegas, NV",175,11,2,5.0,6/26/2015,"It was friday night at 5:30pm and the house was packed. Dan the man was our server. His attitude, table awareness and overall service was AWESOME! He very efficient with a packed house and extremely courteous.  Besides providing our group of 5 adults and 1 infant with absolute amazing service, he made us feel comfortable and as if we were family. I will definitely be back because of his service. Amazing job Dan,  keep up the excellent work!"
Jaime W.,"Henderson, NV",532,195,1005,2.0,11/22/2011,"The B in BJ's stands for: Boring, Bad, Boo-boo, Bland and BLAH. I can't decide.  The service we had is clearly a 3 star. Our waiter was extra friendly to me which I always welcome. But he also forgot to put in our appetizer order. His saving grace was the fact he kept the drinks coming.  Drinks- Cherry Cola Throwbacks. Hot damn those are De-licious! Packed with booze and large amounts of sugar, but it just tastes like a soda fountain Cherry Cola. What an intoxicating treat.  Pizza- Margherita Deep Dish add Mushrooms. This pizza wasn't any better than a Red Baron pizza you microwave at home. Nothing about it was memorable or delicious.  Dessert- Chocolate Chip/Peanut Butter Pazookie. It is what it is. Hot cookie with ice cream. Nothing more, nothing less. Enjoyed by all.  Overall BJ's is not remarkable to me and I will not go out of my way to return. I will gladly pay higher prices for MUCH better food elsewhere."
Christopher B.,"Chinatown, Las Vegas, NV",42,37,17,4.0,5/11/2014,"Great brunch. Took the family out for Mother's Day and was not disappointed. Planned in another place but line was longer than the unemployment office. Worked out because the food at BJs was awesome. Mimosa was great and actually had champaign in it, usually you get more juice. Anyway kids pancakes where the right portions and fluffy. Only negative and why I only rated four stars is my scramble needed more veggies and bacon, but hey I'm a hard ass! All in all we will be back and I highly recommend the Green Valley BJs."
Girl W.,"Las Vegas, NV",13,245,185,3.0,1/7/2014,"Eh Its ok. I have been here a few times and barley remember what I ate here. Its a beautiful bar and dining room, but the food just lacks unfortunately.  Nothing memorable, savory, or satisfying. My mom got the steak once. Was not cooked how she asked for. Like I said I have been here more than 3 times but nothing really stood out. Its good for groups and taking a girl on a 1st date."
Raven-Joie R.,"Las Vegas, NV",463,291,157,5.0,10/27/2013,"I just love BJ's. It might be the food, the drinks, and the entire atmosphere, but I adore it. The restaurant is usually full at every location, so it doesn't hurt to make a reservation.  The Ahi Poke dish is my favorite and that Cheeseburger Pizza really tastes like a burger! The pizookie is super good, I suggest the macadamia one if you like sweets that are not -too- sugary!  If you're on a budget, try their lunch menu M-F @ 12-3 pm. I think you'll find that BJ's is better than your average restaurant :)"
Jill D.,"Las Vegas, NV",706,305,959,2.0,3/14/2014,"Oh my gosh disappointed.  I gave an extra star for service.  They aren't really lacking there.  I would frequent a BJ's in the Bay Area, excellent!   I can't eat the food here.  There is nothing good about it.  Avocado egg rolls, very bland and could use a better sauce maybe?  He ordered a steak salad took a bite then did not eat it.  The only thing half edible was the margarita pizza, which was super small even. It is not even fun to hang out in there. There is just no flavor in the food.  I usually order the pazookie which is my favorite.  My food was so disappointing I decided to skip the dessert to go somewhere else. When you joke around about going to the closest fast food joint after dinner... It can't be good?  Try the restaurant most adjacent that place even is better than this."
Camilla W.,"Henderson, NV",0,14,,5.0,3/27/2016,We had a super wonderful dining experience on Easter Sunday 2016 when our party was given impeccable service by Nicole B. Can't thank you enough. It was Great!
George M.,"Henderson, NV",0,29,2,4.0,7/10/2015,We like to go to BJs but don't go often enough. The food is always good and the portions are exceptional. The staff is always pleasant in the restaurant is very clean it does get busy and you have to wait but what do you expect when you go to a restaurant this good. Prices are reasonable and the desserts are to die for!
Barry M.,"Long Beach, CA",2,5,7,1.0,4/7/2016,"We had a large group dining here tonight. Service was mediocre. What really went bad was the bill. We had 23 diners and were charged for 31. The manager (Jamie) insisted that we had contracted for 30. That would have been fine--adjust us down to 30 and we are good right? Well, Jamie insisted on accusing our guests that had dined separately on their own checks of potentially eating at the buffet we were paying for. Not only that but she became unbelievably rude. I would avoid this place at all costs. It's located in a center with many restaurants that are happy to have your business. Go to them instead of this BJ's. At least they are named correctly--because this place blows!"
Brian M.,"Henderson, NV",257,100,110,5.0,5/10/2015,This place is awesome!  We have been here a few different times and have always been satisfied with the food and service!  They are great for kids and parties!
Benjamin S.,"Anaheim, CA",77,14,17,3.0,6/6/2014,Okay so to start things off I ordered the avocado egg rolls which were very good.. It's served with a sweet soy sauce based sauce .. Surprisingly sweet but it really worked well with the egg rolls.. Now about the service .... Employees seem happy and on top of things for the most part.. Our server I believe was relatively new.. She seemed uncomfortable in social interactions.. Our entrees took a good 35 minutes to reach the table .. Which is unacceptable from a chain like Bjs. I get it.. It's Saturday .. But Christ.. Anyway.. I'll come back ..maybe on a Tuesday afternoon though .
Hazem N.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,3,3,5.0,8/18/2014,"Excellent environment,  and excellent service. Food is great and they have a good value for money."
Alejandra L.,"Henderson, NV",71,15,1,2.0,12/13/2014,"So I decided to come here with some friends to celebrate my birthday. I wish I would have gotten the name of our waiter but it seems like this location has had it's share of bad service anyways, Which is really sad due to how satisfied I was with the portions and flavor of the food. Everything was cooked to perfection and not to mention the amazing variety of foods and drinks. Anyways on to the main point: Our waiter was just...weird in the way of how he talked to us and did everything. Its almost as if he felt uncomfortable serving us as he didnt want to look us in the eye and did everything half-assed and handled everything passive-aggressively. I understand that being a waiter is hard especually attending to many people however this particular night was not busy at all.  It was my 21st birthday so my friend wanted to buy me a drink, & obviously we had to show I.D., I knew it was a long shot since I had just gotten my I.D. renewed (i brought the old one and a new temporary one). With that I was declined my drink, which was no big deal, untill it came time to ask the waiter if they did anything for birthdays. In a very mocking and sarcastic tone he said ""Point and laugh at you."". After 15 min he brought out a cookie with ice cream and a candle on top and just handed it to me...no ""Happy Birthday"" or anything else that other places do for your birthday.  I'm not asking for a parade, rather a little enthusiasm.  This experience left a bad taste and honestly I'm very dissapointed.  It's not that hard to engage your customers and to be nice, like really, it won't kill you I promise!"
Jessica S.,"Henderson, NV",0,7,5,1.0,7/5/2015,"Fish n chips was extremely overcooked, also extremely spicy. I don't mind spicy but on this dish just wasn't good. Manager said the cook probably put it in the wrong fryer.  jambalaya had a powder loaded on top of it which ruined it. Broccoli cheddar soup was cold and clumpy. Server was Shanna and she was very nice trying to help me out. Manager definitely should have compensated more for the inconvenience. All she did was take off our dishes (no shit, we didn't eat them.) HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE. Done with this location."
Chad M.,"Beatty, NV",0,7,5,4.0,8/15/2015,We enjoy coming here in on Fridays. They have s very large menu to order from. The staff is nice and the food is pretty good. Their beer is very good and the bar is a great place to watch a game and drink a cold one.
Jessica E.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,3,,5.0,6/26/2015,"Came in with my Husband and Daughter for the first time after she received a achievement certificate from her school for a free kids meal.  Tam was our server and had a great experience! He was efficient, knowledgeable, and friendly.  Cost was a concern when we came here, because, like most, we are on a budget, but  I was pleasantly surprised how reasonable the menu was.  Food was tasty and good proportions. Not over the top.  Good craft beer selection on menu with accurate descriptions of what they taste like and food pairings to go with.  Very impressed that the manager came over at the end to congratulate my Daughter for her achievement at school and gave her a pin. It shows they care about the community and not just doing the certificate to get more business. Although it worked, because we probably wouldn't have gone there.  We will be back! Thank you for the good experience."
