Patrick P.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,4,,5.0,8/8/2015,Came here after walking out of Twin Peaks due to a lack of service. Once seated it was about two minutes between getting our drink ordered taken and our drinks being brought to us. Our server Rachel was really attentive and anticipated our needs. We ordered the five meat pizza and it came out very fast for a pizza and tasted great. Overall a great place especially with their happy hour beer prices. Will be back for sure.
Amber H.,"Las Vegas, NV",281,314,1079,4.0,2/8/2014,"Good food, awesome pazookis. Fireballshots are a bit expensive at like $8 a pop but it is a restaraunt and not a bar. I got the Pink Cadalliac martini and it tasted like no booze was in it. Overall though, the bar has a nice large TV in it which I was able to glance at. Service was pretty good. About a 20 min wait on weekend nights to get sat unless you can find an open spot at the bar."
Nathan B.,"North Las Vegas, NV",42,61,27,4.0,8/2/2015,BJ's is a good choice for craft brews as well as having a large menu to chose from if u are indecisive. The small BBQ chicken pizza is excellent along with the watermelon salad!! Great spot for a business lunch!
Allison J.,"Henderson, NV",492,644,422,5.0,7/10/2013,"Sweet Pig Pizza and Chicken Bacon Ranch are two of our favorite items on the menu here. But what I like too is there are occasional specials like during the summer they have an additional BBQ menu. The spinach, arugula and berries salad and the corn fritters are really yummy.  As far as family restaurants go, I love this place. My 7 year old adores the pizookies and we always get a booth so she can spread out if necessary. Service has always been good when we've come and as far as chain restaurants go, this and Sammy's Wood Fired Pizza is as good as it gets for us in Las Vegas."
Matt W.,"Las Vegas, NV",13,10,,2.0,6/14/2015,Caution! Servers autograt parties of 6 or more and don't display the gratuity on your signed copy. We were a party of 6 with 2 kids so we were in a bit of a hurry and didn't look until we got home. We intended to tip 30 percent and our slick server walked with 48! Bad taste by the management.
Cheri M.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,4,2,4.0,1/9/2015,"Went to BJ's on Eastern in Henderson,   was great food nice atmosphere.  The Atlantic Salmon was amazing.  I would recommend BJ's for all to try.  Not overly priced either."
Jason H.,"Las Vegas, NV",24,67,30,1.0,9/14/2014,"To me this is one of the worst places to go. The beer is good and that's about it.  I've gone to this location several times and it gets worse every time. First off we were seated handed menus and the server was talking to another and I guess they switched tables. He comes up before we even open our menus and says can I get you guys some drinks, beer or anything. I say sorry we just sat down can you come back in just a minute or two. Well, that turned into 15 minutes.  He comes back and we figure ok we should probably place our entire order just in case. About 15 minutes later he brings our drinks. Then 10-15 minutes from then he brings one of our appetizers. Avocado egg rolls. The avocado was almost brown. Not from being cooked, but from sitting. He says that the station that makes the other appetizer is backed up, but he didn't want us to get hungry. After a fee minutes another guy shows up with our ahi crisp, and another avocado egg roll. I say we already have our avocado egg roll, and he says oh ok kind of confused. The ahi was cut into cubes that were Huge, no sesame seeds or any hint of seasoning basically huge chunks of ahi that smelled like warm raw fish. We finished what we could.  Dinner wasn't really any better. I really don't want to write any more. Just know that I will never be going here again. The food isn't good. The service isn't good. This place is really not good."
Pete C.,"Henderson, NV",0,11,,5.0,4/10/2016,"Our server was Fernando. I highly recommend you try to sit in his section. He is 5 stars. The food was awesome also. 5 stars. Great beer choices also. I had the tuna poke - very fresh-, and the 4 beer sampler. We eat there about once a month and each time has been great."
Dave P.,"Henderson, NV",1,9,1,4.0,5/31/2015,If you have been to Hooters then you'll enjoy Twin Peaks. This place is what shooters is suppose to be.
Natalie P.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,2,,1.0,10/26/2014,"We walked in hoping to find the nascar race, out of six Tvs in the whole restaurant the manager Jamie came over to the front and said ""we can't accommodate you."" And that was it, when asking why? She replied ""we only have six satellites and eight games on.."" And that was it. When there were barely any people in the restaurant and the same game was on three Tvs!, we walked over to twin peaks where they changed a TV for us! Now we're enjoying our time there watching the race"
Brooke B.,"Henderson, NV",9,52,15,5.0,3/1/2015,"Pizookie, pizookie, pizookie! Oh, and barbeque chicken salad and California chicken sandwich. Love to meet my husband here for a quick bite and dessert!"
David A.,"Henderson, NV",158,118,63,2.0,1/27/2015,"The food tastes good, but the portions turn out small and I swear I've gotten sick after every time I've eaten here. Not just me, but my mom and my friend both have gotten sick from eating here. The pazookie is amazing but I get nauseous and the runs after I have one every time too. It's disappointing after great tasting food to get sick, but the portions are disappointing enough as well to not bother returning. There's better out there..."
Norman K.,"Henderson, NV",1,17,3,4.0,6/25/2015,I had a salad wedge and a basic burger. Both were okay. Bun was large. I only ate half.
Lizzy P.,"Salt Lake City, Salt Lake City, UT",192,159,18,4.0,8/9/2014,"We took the family out for dinner here, because they are close, and we can all get something we can eat (gluten free pizza for me, vegan spaghetti for my vegan kid, beer for the hubby, etc). They were having issues with their pizza oven on the night we came, which resulted in a long, long wait and impatient kids. However, the manager was super nice, and because he realized how difficult waiting for food with hungry kids can be, comped our entire meal, drinks, dessert and all. We were very, very pleased with the service, and will return for sure. Hopefully there won't be any oven issues next time."
Ryan M.,"Henderson, NV",4,34,,1.0,2/28/2013,"Ok so I think i have about had it with this place. Other bj's are sooo much better but the service at this one sucks! They have failed miserably like 5 times in a row. The thing is the foods always pretty good and the beer is great. But having to wait 30 minutes for a pitcher of beer or to even see your server is unacceptable. The sweet pig pizza and j. Red beer is great and keep is coming back but maybe not worth it in the end with grimaldis acrossnthe street .... So i went back again (dont ask) and was the same old story....terrible service and people angry all around us. Manager took forever to get to tables who had issues and was a disaster. I flat out asked the server "" why is the service always so bad here""' it cant be a server issue if its always bad... It has to be a management issue with payroll or terrible training! She only had 5 tables and was not double sat so i really have no clue other than the service always sucks and the food/beer is always good"
Gemini M.,"Las Vegas, NV",123,107,209,4.0,7/21/2011,"We were shopping in the area and wanted something cool to drink, also realizing we probably could handle a snack as well. Rather than hop in the car and head somewhere else, we popped in here to check it out. Three words: Small bites menu.  The spinach stuffed mushrooms were plentiful and really tasty, with just a hint of spice. The caps were large and generously stuffed. The caprese (mozzarella salad) was OK. Not bad, but just OK. There was something odd about it and I didn't care for the parmesan cheese. Let the tomatoes and mozzarella do their thing; something about the extra cheese and the way it was dressed just made it... well, OK. The fried artichokes were a bit heavy for me, but that's just personal preference talking. They were crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, and really, really tasty. My guests dug into them with abandon and didn't leave a crumb untouched. Very well done. The seared ahi was absolutely perfect. This was really the only dish that was small - four pieces? - but at the price they offer it, it's a fabulous little snack and exactly what they portray it to be. The dipping sauce was flavorful, didn't seem laden with salt (a very good thing) and had a great little kick to it. Standout little dish. We also had a couple of salads that were really fresh; the flavors of the vegetables and toppings were bright and clean.  The ""spicy"" bloody mary wasn't; the waitress admitted it was from a mix and that they couldn't really do much to it for me. She brought some Tabasco sauce which helped, but as it wasn't fresh, it was really just a mix with some vodka and Tabasco. Not horrible (of course I drank it!) but not a good, hand-crafted bloody mary. And, all this for less than $30.  It's a 3-star (A-OK) place, for sure. The service is what made it a 4 for us. It's a chain and it's a bit cookie-cutter, but that works here. Definitely a respectable, repeatable dining experience."
Melyssa B.,"Las Vegas, NV",96,57,47,2.0,12/30/2013,Ehh..... Defiantly not the greatest food.. Our wait was a little over 40 min and the food was not that great. I got the California Chicken it was so bland. Seriously no flavor. The green chilis had no kick to them or flavor. I was highly disappointed. The husband got a steak and steamed veggies. He ordered medium rare and It came out well done....  This place was just not that great overall. Not a place I plan to come back to when I visit Henderson again.
K M.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,30,,2.0,4/28/2015,"Average food, average service, average atmosphere. Yep, that's about it - the place is average. Just another average big chain restaurant with an Olive Garden personality.....Keep searching."
Michael P.,"Las Vegas, NV",40,79,2,1.0,6/6/2015,"I have been here at least 5 times and have never had good service. Sorry, but the food isn't good enough to keep me coming back. Tonight was the last straw when I was seated in the patio and sat there for 15 minutes without even being acknowledged by a waiter. I ended up walking out. I was with a party of 3. No waters, nothing."
Mandi L.,"Las Vegas, NV",414,342,195,3.0,4/1/2013,"Unfortunately, my review of this place is a combination of 2 visits: 1 being a 4-star, and the other being a 2-star, hence a 3-star total. I came here last week and met a friend for dinner.  We sat in the bar area were immediately greeted by a server.  She was friendly and helpful.  We ordered burgers, both of which were amazing.  I got the Bacon Cheeseburger with a Chipotle mayo and he got the California burger.  They were huge and I could barely finish mine. It always seems busy there, but we didn't have to wait on the server.  I actually really like the busy atmosphere. I came here again with my best friend and goddaughter yesterday.  We were craving bloodies and my goddaughter wanted ice cream so this seemed like the perfect spot.  Right off the bat, the hostesses seemed completely uninterested and in a simple word, LAME.  Their attitude screamed ""It's Easter, I don't want to be here.""  They were just so blah and unfriendly.  Anyway, after asking if the outside patio area was shaded, she said yes and that there was a table.  She seated us out there at the one table that didn't have an umbrella.  Luckily another table was just finishing up so we moved over as soon as they left.   We got our bloodies and ice cream and were pretty happy then.  Our server was nice enough and to our surprise, we were on happy hour the entire time so our bloodies were $1 off.  The other thing that would contribute to the 2 stars is that several other tables left as we sat there and no one ever bussed the tables.  It just looked sloppy and gross."
