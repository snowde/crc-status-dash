Robert Y.,"Henderson, NV",900,36,4,5.0,2/16/2015,"Chicken sandwich,  BJ's pizza, and a double burger hit the spot eveytime. We gotta love us some BJ''s."
Heather H.,"Las Vegas, NV",53,21,18,5.0,1/23/2015,"I walked in to BJs expecting mediocre service as usual. After a long week at work, I just wanted decent food and a good beer. I have to say I was blown away for the first time here. Paula, our cocktail waitress made my day! Her suggestions were spot on, she was welcoming, and I felt like she cared about our experience. Honestly, I will make sure I sit in her section every time I dine there again. I will be back soon!!!!"
Mikey T.,"Oxnard, CA",63,11,1,1.0,10/14/2014,"I've had a lot of BJs. This by far was the worst BJ I have ever received. The service was slow and not in a good of way. If your going for a birthday dinner, you might be there to see their next birthday. Never again."
Chuck H.,"Las Vegas, NV",301,396,270,5.0,8/21/2011,"BJ's seriously doesn't need another review but ill give it a shot anyway.  I got a flyer in the mail that said they were doing a special dinner and a date promotion. For $20 bucks you get 2 soups or salads, one medium pizza, and a shared poozkie (thats a desert).  Then you pay $15 and get 2 movie tickets to a regal cinema.    I thought there had to be a catch but nope it was totally legit. The medium pizza is seriously HUGE. We couldn't finish the thing and i had to bring the rest home because it was just that good. We ordered the sweet pig pizza. It has real ham and chucks of pineapple on it. AWESOMEEEEEEE The clam chowder was crazy. This is the first place that served me clam chowder that i didn't have to doctor up with a little salt and pepper. My wife ordered the tomato soup and that was pretty decent as well.  The servers are always really nice here and don't allow us to run dry on drinks or feel neglected. The only thing stopping a five star rating is well, actually nothing. Im changing this sucker to 5 stars."
S B.,"Vallejo, CA",103,144,41,1.0,10/1/2015,"Truely hurts my feelings to do this to one of my favorite eateries since claimjumpers but it is what it is ..... My lady friend and i went here especially for pizookie day .ordered appetizers stuff mushrooms calamari and some kind of new hot wings she ordered ... She says her wings were bland and didnt have enough rub on them they brought more rub thee calamari was bland as well even drizzles of lemon juice did not help or assist . No problem mushrooms were fine ..... So now we're awaiting our main course which we both decided on jambalaya , to our surprise both our meals came mines with extra chicken but missing shrimps on both . So waiter gets manager which i believe his name was ,kevin, !he comes out and tries to sooth us and to make things better , i guess he had thee kitchen prepare our shrimp which came out 5 minutes  later on the side so now we have to toss our shrimp in our meal . At tht time we were kinda done with this establishment so we ask for to go boxes and our dessert  , where the waiter informed us we could only get one pizookie per table which prompts me to look at the flyer ..... Which states with a purchase of 9.95 u get a pizookie no where on it does it state one per table i mean did yawl want us to split our party up and sit at the bar to make more of a mess to clean i suppose .at the ens of the day we got 2 but the experience at this location is not worth me coming back all bjs are already miles away from me but i think ill stick with thee one on charleston instead i mean on a 70 dollar bill didnt get  a appetizer taken off are anything like seriously bring my shrimp on the side and think that would make thee issue better i seriously doubt it"
Vanessa A.,"Las Vegas, NV",259,670,174,3.0,5/23/2013,"Cap'n Crunch French Toast = YES PLEASE!!!!!!!! It sounded so fantastic that we ordered 3 for the table. There were 13 of us who met up for brunch......on Mothers Day!  We tried and failed at Crepe Expectations, we tried and failed at Blue Island (it was going to be their last day of business as owners had bailed on business the waiter/host advised). I called Republic and they couldn't seat us til 4. I called here and they said it would be about 40 minutes. We got there about 25 minutes later and they told us it would be about 25-35 minutes. Mothers Day is quite the day for brunch/breakfast/lunch. It was slow to start, the drink order took a while. Then we had to order our food, then wait for it. But, once one meal came out, they all came out pretty quick after that.  Back to those Cap'n Crunch french toast.......they came out first. They were OK. I think we all dreamed of TASTING Cap'n Crunch in the french toast. But you dont. You want to, you know it's there, but it doesnt taste like it one bit. It doesnt taste bad, not at all, but it doesnt taste like you imagine it will.  The table ordered a ton of food: Breakfast pizza, Surf n Turf, french toast, shrimp taco's, pulled pork sandwich, ahi tuna salad, breakfast sandwich and a few others I'm forgetting. The portions are nice size. The potatoes with the breakfast pizza weren't seasoned well. There was way to much omelette on the pizza. The cheese could have melted more too. I think everyone was so hungry, and the food was OK, we ate. But I dont think anyone had anything spectacular that I'd rush back for. Although, I did hear they have a dessert that's a cookie in a cast iron skillet that they bake fresh with ice cream on top. That sounded so good. But maybe it's like the Cap'n Crunch french toast. Disappointing :("
Olivia R.,"Las Vegas, NV",211,41,24,2.0,12/21/2014,"My friend is visiting town from Germany so we decided to try this place out, my roommate is quite a fan of bj's and it was my first time. As soon as we sit down the waitress brings our menu's, and my friend promptly asks for the beer menu when the server replies with an, ""Are you even old enough?"" I didn't pick up on any sarcastic humor there, and to me that is offensive to just assume that he is not of age. It is one thing to ask for id but to blatantly state that she does not think he is of age is another. He then provides for her his german identification card which she has to go approve with the manager.  We proceed to order a bowl of soup and a few appetizers to start out with, both were very delicious. Actually one of the better bowls of clam chowder i've had in a while. We then place our order for our food I ordered a small 11"" hand tossed pizza, which i said exactly like that, my roommate orders a chicken club, and our friend orders just some shrimp tacos. 2 out of 3 of the orders come out wrong. My roommate has a very sensitive stomach and her sandwich (chicken club) some how has green chiles on it. Which is not noted on the menu so she promptly asks them to take it off. My order came out as a 9"" DEEP DISH pizza. Which was completely the wrong style of pizza i ordered. Our waitress comes out and says that ""I ordered a small and hand tossed doesn't come in small"" so she gave me a deep dish...? The hand tossed does come in an 11in size which is what I said when I ordered so I do not appreciate her trying to blame me for her mistake in the order. I told her I don't want it i'm no longer hungry at this point when she urges me to box the pizza up. The manager comes to the table, and In my experience managers are usually apologetic. However the first thing she says when she comes to our table is ""So whats the problem"". We explained our problem and she ""fixed it"" by taking our orders off the bill. Whatever. Probably won't be trying this place again anytime soon."
Casey M.,"Henderson, NV",0,17,1,3.0,3/1/2015,"I usually really like BJs..it's not my favorite but they do have a few really good items on the menu. One of my favorite things is the tomato bisque. It's to die for! This time, I decided to pick up a pizza from there with my friends. We ordered a pep deep dish pizza online and picked up curbside. Once we got home and started eating, there were different veggies throughout and a piece of pineapple?!? They were sloppy making it. Next time I will just go to Pizza Hut for half the price."
Michael A.,"Amarillo, TX",2,66,113,1.0,2/23/2014,Have to say I was very disappointed overall. The place was very noisy; so much so that it was difficult to have a conversation at your own table. Our server was good once she got to us. We waited about ten minutes for her to come by our table.  We ordered a large pizza and several sides. The pizza came out about 30 minutes later. It was LUKEWARM at best. The crust on one side was so soggy it was pathetic. The manager was called over. He asked if we wanted another pizza (another 30 minute wait?? Not likely!!) He then left the table with no other comment. The waitress came by and said she would take off the cost of the pizza. It took two tries to get the ticket adjusted.  Too many other good pizza places around to give this place another chance. Life is too short!
Melissa G.,"Las Vegas, NV",3,9,,5.0,3/22/2015,I love this place! I could eat here at least once a week. They have such a vast menu and I feel that is still haven't tried everything. Love it!
Raymond B.,"Las Vegas, NV",537,229,200,3.0,12/16/2010,"Just last night we left the Yuletide and headed out to grab a bite before heading home and BJ's is a good place to grab a bite and maybe a great drink. We walked in and were seated right away but sat for quite some time before ordering. The waitress brought our drinks and then disappeared until our food came out. We ordered the chicken club and an order of potato skins.  The potato skins were done well and came with all the necessary fixins.. Cheese, bacon, scallions and a sour cream like sauce.  The Chicken Club was perfect, Lightly toasted Garlic Sourdough with chicken breast, bacon, avocado, tomato and lettuce.  I really feel bad about this review only being 3 stars because the food was great as usual but the service was far less then lacking.. My water went empty and stayed empty throughout the entire meal, and we had to wait for quite some time for our check to come. With a small meal at BJ's taking an hour and a half I would say there was some sort of hang up or issue with the service."
Darla A.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,13,2,5.0,4/24/2015,"Came in around 5pm and sat at the bar. Greeted by Courtney, the bartender. She was super friendly. She made sure to point out the happy hour specials, and brought our drinks right away. Ordered a shot, which was very generous in size, and food. My husband and I split the California burger and the avocado egg rolls. Both were delicious!! Courtney kept checking on us the entire time and was quick with anything we asked for. We, most definitely, will be back bc of her service."
Jeanette M.,"Medina, OH",0,15,,4.0,9/13/2015,"Been here a few times. Service was great, my waitress, not sure her name, bc they don't wear name tags or say there name. I'm ok with that. She was nice, honest about her favorites. The restaurant was steady, my drink was refilled regularly without having to ask. Food was good just has potato skins.  Sitting by yourself at a restaurant is not always fun. But my waitress was friendly and I felt comfortable."
Steve K.,"Las Vegas, NV",690,45,40,2.0,9/18/2013,"Went to Bj's, had wine, drinks, salad and dinner. My bill had a mistake which I caught later.  Was charged for two wines instead of one.   After waiting on hold for a very long time, manager said she would call me back with a resolution.  No call back."
Natalie K.,"Las Vegas, NV",341,295,1379,4.0,7/29/2013,"Yes please! The ambiance, service and food are all up to par. Deep dish pizza was great, fried artichoke and the mahi mahi were all delish. Service is very personal and managers walk around and ensure quality. Not to mention the extensive beer menu."
Vicki D.,"Southeast, Las Vegas, NV",59,102,42,4.0,6/26/2014,"We went here for happy hour. It was pretty busy. We sat in the bar area. There was 5 of is and we squeezed into a table, We ordered drinks. I ordered a Mojito. Some of the other people in my party ordered lemon drop martinis , apple martini and the Irish root beer . That was by far my favorite even though it wasn't on the happy hour menu. It tasted like a root beer float! So good! For appetizers we ordered the flat bread pizza, spinach appetizer dip and pot stickers. Everything was good. Portions were a bit for 5 people to share but they were tasty. Service was good  and it wasn't too loud. I will come back again."
Christine R.,"Las Vegas, NV",116,31,,4.0,9/2/2014,"I have usually gone here for dinner for pizza and beer but this time went during lunch.  They have some really good lunch deals and the lunch choices were many.  I enjoyed the half flatbread pizza and salad.  However, my companions had the pasta lunch special, chicken fingers and fish & chips and all was good.  We started off with the Fritos nachos which were surprisingly good.  Prices were very reasonable for lunch and will be added to my places to choose from."
Shannon N.,"Las Vegas, NV",102,11,,1.0,6/18/2014,"We went that for lunch around 2pm.  The place was pretty empty, but it still took our waitress 10 minutes to come over and acknowledge us.  That is ok, sometimes a waitress has other stuff going on.  However, ordered a bison burger and it came out rare.  Asked for it to be cooked more and after 40 minutes of waiting, the new burger again came out rare and the salad that comes with it sat under a heat lamp for the 40 minutes.  The manager and waitress were unapologetic.  Will not eat at this location ever again."
Justin R.,"San Diego, CA",252,59,8,4.0,12/31/2012,"Great place with good employees. Although a chain restaurant, their beer selection is nice, their own brews are not bad at all (Jeremiah Red and Abbey are awesome) and their bartenders are really solid (Tyler and Ashley stand out amongst the team).  Plus their happy hour from 4-7pm with half off pizzas (awesome pizzas.....) is a great deal. NOTE: Does NOT brew on site. Everything is shipped in."
Brittany S.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,2,8,2.0,3/17/2015,"Ill admit it we continue to eat here every now and then.. the food is okay but mostly because they are open late. The customer service here is just so god awful. That being said not all the servers are bad w4eve maybe had 2 that were awesome. But the hosts are rude and dont seem to care when you walk in the door. The plates, silverware,  and glassware is DISGUSTING.  I once found some nasty gooey something in my water and when we told the server her response was ill come back for it later, so my advice to you bring your own water/ drink. Check your silverware before eating with it. And lastly make sure you dont have hair in your food because i found a nice long one in the caprese app. Proceed with caution."
