Justin G.,"Las Vegas, NV",581,255,234,2.0,8/9/2012,"They really do try hard at BJ's and I feel like they get that extra star for effort. When it comes to family friendly chain restaurants, BJs is one of the few that I like. Their food, while not of remarkable. is consistent and some dishes don't substitute in fat to make up for flavor. BJ's has been able to really define itself in what is a competitive market segment. Having it's own selection of micro-brewed beers, deep-dish pizzas, and of-course the pazookie set it apart from the likes of Claim Jumper and others.  I usually end up coming here almost once a week. The sandwiches and the deep-dish pizza (the Great White and the Mediterranean are awesome) never fail. But what really brings me in is of course the pazookie. It's their signature dessert, just like the cheesecakes at the cheesecake factory.  Service is often hit or miss, but unfortunately my last experience was a miss. I came in during happy hour with a couple friends to catch the game. The bar area was pretty barren, no wait at all. We got our seat an the server took our order. Unlike most happy hour patrons, our group ordered pretty much everything. Beers, appetizers, pizza, pazookies, everything. The food was good, but for whatever reason, our server kept rushing. Maybe she was about to get off and wanted this the tip before she clocked out, I don't know. But considering the place was totally empty, I don't get why they would want to turn this table over so fast. Feeling rushed really does ruin the dining experience, especially at a place I go to so often. She brought our check out before the pazookie arrived which is highly unusual. After dessert had arrived the server stopped by to see if we had paid, seeing we that we had not, she stood nearby waiting for us to do so. This made the whole dining experience really AWKWARD. I don't really expect every experience here to be like this, but it was really uncomfortable."
Gary W.,"Maui, HI",34,53,1,5.0,12/24/2015,"Great restuarant!  Always had good service, meals delivered timely and hot!   The blackened salmon is great!  Always a hit for us!"
Stefanie B.,"Henderson, NV",156,1,,3.0,3/8/2015,"I'm in the service industry so I was disappointed with the server that took care of us.  It was a Sunday night, and although it seemed slightly busy, I didn't like how she rushed us. The server didn't write mine or my sister's order down.  Our drinks were empty for a good 15 min and we waited on our food for a good 30 min. Got the food and it was just okay. We didn't get the extra sides of ranch and marina we had asked for either (we probably would have if our server had written down our order). She seemed annoyed of us, I don't know why but she probably felt bad after we tipped 20% (even if she didn't deserve it) and left."
Janelle M.,"Las Vegas, NV",177,40,73,4.0,6/29/2014,"We like taking the fam here because there's something for everyone. Recently had visitors in town who've never been to a BJ's.   Someone wanted chicken wings, someone wanted pasta, someone wanted to drink, someone wanted a good steak.  BJ's came through for everyone.  My go-to meal is the rib eye--cooked perfectly. And the pizookies are always a crowd pleaser. Not to mention their beers as well as cocktails and mocktails are delish!"
Sandee W.,"Henderson, NV",0,41,,5.0,7/29/2015,Went for early dinner...Had wonderful service from Athena....She has waited on us before...Evertime the service is so great....Other waiters should learn from her.....this is why we like to come back.....
Jason r.,"Henderson, NV",521,116,186,1.0,9/20/2012,This used to be a great place now mediocre. Tonight went there and dined outside. Was seated at a dirty table and server named rick cleaned table with a napkin and was filthy and we made him get a rag. He finally did. We ordered and never was asked if we wanted a drink. Pizza came and was terrible and had to be sent back. Service from Rick was awful and food was terrible. This place has gone down.
Clara V.,"Henderson, NV",0,13,,3.0,1/9/2015,"The food is always very good. Each time I have been to this location our orders were right and cooked well. However service is lacking, which seems to be the theme of their reviews. Waiters just don't seem happy to be there or too service oriented. Like they're all robots just going through the motions. On one occasion I did ask my server for a red sangria. I was told they only serve specialty sangrias and that the bartender just couldn't make that drink for me. Only the drinks on the menu. What? Any bartender with a proper license and training should know how to throw together a simple sangria. If I could do it myself at home, how could a ""professional"" in a well stocked bar not be able to? I will try this location again but it won't be first on my list, that's for sure."
Matthew B.,"Henderson, NV",7,24,6,5.0,1/9/2015,"I have been here twice, each time was very satisfying. They have a good list of brews that are made in house, and are very tasty. The food is nicely presented and tastes great. Nice portion sizes as well. This is a good place to bring a business client/friend. Not expensive but a step up from Applebee's etc."
Mandy A.,"Grand Rapids, MI",20,58,10,2.0,9/21/2014,"I ended up in the emergency room within an hour of eating here with a terrible allergic reaction to something.  I'm deathly allergic to shellfish and didn't order anything with shellfish in it which scares me that there is cross contamination with the shrimp in the kitchen. I will more than likely not be back, in fear that could happen again."
Cerise B.,"Las Vegas, NV",47,93,106,5.0,11/6/2014,I ordered a sirloin steak which was a little too overdone but still very good. Our server insisted that I take another one with me because I was already quite full from the delicious artichoke appetizer I had. My husband loved his corn fritters & pizza and our server was top notch! Ask for Athena at the Henderson location.
Brandon C.,"Littleton, CO",0,33,12,4.0,2/14/2015,"As always the pizookie is delicious! We had the s'mores pb one was awesome!the salmon dish I had on the lighter menu was yum but the faux couscous was over salted and the newer waitress shorted me in change that night but , overall things got worked out and the food and atmosphere are wonderful! We brought two girls under 9 which I would not do again til they are a bit less bouncy! Better for a date night than family dinner- just my opinion!"
John V.,"Cypress, CA",0,44,25,5.0,12/29/2013,"Our waiter Aaron was excellent, one of the best waiters I have ever had. The food and beer is good as expected. I recommend this BJ's as it is not too far front the strip and is a nice break from the strip crazy..."
Matthew L.,"Baltimore, MD",990,726,161,3.0,8/14/2012,"Interesting brew house in Vegas suburbs.  It has a chainy type of feel, but usually has quite a following.  There is indoor and outdoor seating.  The food is American comfort food.  They are tasty, but predictable.  The star are the beers.  There are too many to count.  The place is great for a large group of people."
Stephanie T.,"Henderson, NV",0,9,,4.0,2/8/2015,We went here to celebrate some bdays for my family members. my sis is trying to be healthier and I made her a beautiful fruit and yogurt bday cake. our server was awesome and he put in their fridge for us. great food and prices
love lv f.,"Henderson, NV",8,166,,2.0,11/30/2012,"I come here often with my family for a quick meal that offers something for everyone.  Although they do offer something for everyone,like all chains, its not always good. Same with the service. Most times its slow, especially if you sit at the stations in the far back.  Ordered the lettuce wraps, the filling was all cold and there was little flavor. Even with the sauce added, now I only tasted salt.  My husbands salad looked as though the lettuce had been out for sometime, and somehow the chicken fingers did not pass my daughter's tastebuds.  Typically I have gotten a decent meal here. It could have been the night, but they were not that crowded. We were immediately seated.However I was surprised though that our server never asked if everything came out ok. I would have probably said something.  I'm sure I'll go back and try something different!"
D B.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,2,,1.0,7/6/2015,"Have gone several times. Today was the final visit. Advised the server that I have some dietary needs. He assured me it would be find. Ordered the Sirloin Steak med, it came out rare and cold, ordered a baked potato that came out the color of a brown paper bag, it had to be several days old, it was replaced with another one only a day old (Yuk), ordered the Roasted Brussel sprouts with no seasoning, they came out with some nasty seasoning and undercooked. Service was mediocre, the food was terrible. Will not be back."
Teri W.,"Henderson, NV",134,833,390,4.0,3/13/2011,"The food here is amazing, as is the beer.  My favorite is during the fall when they have the Pumpkin Ale.  I love that you can buy growlers of the beer to take home, and the root beer is really good as well.  It is great to take home and make your own root beer floats.  The service is usually really friendly, but at times it's been kind of slow.  I prefer to go and sit in the bar area during happy hour, where they have great drink and food specials.  There is something on the menu for everyone.  I love the small bites and the pizzas, especially during happy hour when they are half off (in the bar area)."
Cameron S.,"Las Vegas, NV",118,244,5,4.0,4/1/2013,"I always receive a very consistent meal here, whether if I'm in the mood for a salad, pizza or turkey burger.  BJ's always is pretty busy so don't be surprised if you have to wait.   Hands down my favorite item on the menu is the Pizookie, which is a giant pie lie chocolate chip cookie fresh from the oven with a big scoop of vanilla ice cream on top, that in itself is a meal! If you are looking for a more up-scale bar scene but want to escape the slightly higher prices of Yard House, I would recommend BJ's."
Bigg G.,"Henderson, NV",0,14,10,5.0,10/13/2013,"Always a good time watching football, having a couple craft beers... Pumpkin Spice Ale and Octoberfest!! A very tasteful mix of weather changing aromas and warm flavors. Happy hour - with mini pizzas and other specials going as we watch the morning games. You can never go wrong with the triple chocolate ghirradelli pizookie!!"
Allyson M.,"Newbury, NH",38,30,9,5.0,5/5/2014,If you love avocado .. The avocado egg rolls are yummy. The lunch specials are also worth it - flatbread with salad or deep dish with salad! Top off with the crazy dessert that you just can't believe it pizzi- something awesome!
