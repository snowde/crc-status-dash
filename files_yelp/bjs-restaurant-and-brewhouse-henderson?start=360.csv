Cynnie N Christopher C.,"Henderson, NV",15,12,,5.0,11/12/2014,"Always find myself wanting to order the jambalaya, its uber good. Turkey burger is good, pasta bowls are awesome, and the beers are always delish."
Kyla G.,"San Diego, CA",49,139,16,4.0,3/24/2012,"BJ's is a date-night staple for the boyfriend and I. The food is very consistent (I tend to order the same thing every time!). Not gourmet by any means, but tasty. Their new ""Small Plate"" appetizers are awesome and cheap! They also have a low-cal menu section, which is nice, but needs to be expanded. The menu is huge...like Cheesecake Factory huge. Their house brews are great. And the Pizookie is to.die.for. Two people can eat (drinks + entrees) for about $40. Only 4 stars because of the service. It's hit-or-miss. Generally, food takes quite a while to arrive. The place can get pretty crowded on weekend nights, but the bar area is open seating with full menu."
Matthew M.,"Henderson, NV",10,64,2,3.0,6/25/2012,"Pros *The food was really delicious.  Everything we tasted was amazing. *Their beer is pretty decent *Their signature dessert is a giant cookie with ice cream.  And the cookie is still hot *The staff was extremely friendly Cons *My entree was 1600 calories.  Even taking half of it home still resulted in a mega-portion of fat and sodium (I obviously didn't order from the skinny menu) *The Pizookie (dessert cookie) had less fat and calories than my entree.  Since when is dessert the 'healthy' portion of the meal *The timing of our meal was off completely - our appetizer came out just seconds before our entrees and our dessert took another 20 minutes after ordering We went for a late dinner on a Sunday.  The place was busy but not swamped.  Our waitress was a trainee and she had her trusty ""pro"" shadowing her.  We've all been a trainee before, and I think she did pretty well for a newbie.  The issue here is that at a few points during the evening the ""pro"" came over by himself and spoke with us.  I think it would be beneficial for the trainee to handle all situations instead of confusing the diners with multiple servers. Somewhere along the way our meal timing got messed up.  The appetizer (poke - absolutely delicious) came out less than a minute before our entrees.  This led to that awkward situation where you try and eat the app as fast as possible so your meal doesn't get cold.  The poke was amazing, so not an issue. While we were shoveling tuna into our faces, the manager came over.  He profusely apologized for the timing issue and said if we wanted to have a dessert he would pick up the tab on that.  Very nice, we thought, but not needed.  The timing thing wasn't really an issue for us, but it was a really nice gesture on the manager's part. Please be warned that it's really tough to pick an entree at BJ's.  Their menu is extensive and everything sounds delicious.  The entrees we picked were both fantastic (Chicken Marsala and Tuscan Chicken Limone).  If ever there was a restaurant to not be a fat American, BJ's is it.  Take half home.  Their portions are large and should definitely not be consumed in one sitting. Since the manager went out of his way to offer us the dessert, we opted for the peanut butter pizookie.  It's a warm peanut butter cookie, about 8"" across, with ice cream on top.  Everyone has an inner fat girl, and she's drooling at the sound of this.  And yes, it's that good.  Ignore the diet, forget about the bathing suit body, just eat the pizookie and enjoy it. Overall, we had a decent experience at BJ's.  The food is really good, the staff is really friendly, and they seem to genuinely care about making guests happy.  The portions are pretty big, and there was definitely some awkward moments created by the staff, but I think we'll likely return."
Sarah P.,"Las Vegas, NV",10,58,1,5.0,7/21/2012,"It was the bf's birthday celebration... My friend William suggested that we go here. The homemade root beer is DELICIOUS! They have potato skins and really good ranch... But their bacon is not very good... The place was packed... Usually a good sign... The menu is HUGE... The food that is presented is beautiful to the eyes and the stomach...  I ordered the calzone... It had artichokes and mushrooms and cheese... They need to use just the heart I kept running into the ""leaves"" of the artichoke and they were pithy.. but it was soo good I ate around them... The marinara sauce that goes with the calzone is mmmmm good!   The bf ordered the jambalaya... We were told by at least 3 different servers and a manager that it was ""spicy"" and that made the bf happy!  It had chicken...shrimp...and andouille sausage... He loved it! I thought it was too spicy!  PORTIONS ARE HUGE! Definitely share meals..."
Breanna G.,"Southwest, Las Vegas, NV",7,81,4,5.0,5/12/2014,"I order take out from here frequently and Jake is the waiter who works takeout during the day; he is the best! He has to be the best employee for customer service and thoroughness I have ran across in a long time. Go here! Order from their low calorie portion of the menu too! The ahi salad and Chinese chicken salads are amazing. And takeout is also one of the best in the city. The presentation is phenomenal, quality amazing, and service top notch."
Sara Q.,"Henderson, NV",2,18,,3.0,7/9/2013,I liked the pale ale. It was exactly what you would expect for a micro brewery. Full of flavor. The appetizers were pretty good to. I would recommend the egg rolls. Overall the food was a bit pricey. The service was pretty slow though. It wasn't very busy but it still took really long to get our food.
Randy M.,"Honolulu, HI",4,73,12,3.0,8/6/2014,"Service just ok.  Food was only 3 star, I could have made the California Burger much better myself at home.  Had to ask for my beer twice but it was good."
Crocodile Dundee D.,"Tonopah, NV",70,40,3,5.0,8/5/2014,"Love this place, always busy, if u wanna come eat at night you should come early because you wont find parking anywhere. I ordered the grilled chicken pasta it was very tasty. It came with pasta, grilled chicken, with breadsticks, so good. Always love coming to this place, especially with friends. They also brew their own beer. Better leave some space for the pizookie. They have different ice cream flavors, with baked cookie topped with ice-cream and cherry on top."
Lydia N.,"Las Vegas, NV",214,209,535,4.0,2/23/2012,"I only gave it four stars because of the chocolate chunk pizookie.  Sometimes I go to BJs at least two to three times a week just to order the pizookie. I LOVE IT.  Other than that, BJs service and food is mediocre."
David J.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,6,1,1.0,6/8/2013,"We arrived at 11:00 a.m. and we were greeted immediately, a hostess started to take us to our table in the bar section so we asked to be seated in the dining section instead.  The hostess rolled her eyes and rushed us to a booth in the dining section dropping the menus on the table and giving us the 5 second spiel on the drinks and walked off.  We immediately complained to the manager who apologized.  It would have been a nice gesture if the manager to came check to us to see if the experience had improved...needless to say the whole mood was ruined. This used to be our favorite spot and the first time we ever received such a crappy attitude from a BJ's Brewhouse employee.  Glad we used our points on prior visits because we will not be going back...ever."
Maria A.,"The Strip, Las Vegas, NV",13,19,17,3.0,7/20/2014,"Good food. Staff is attentive and always telling me about new items and specials. The bar is fully stocked and but I especially love the speciality beers. Bartender was great at letting me sample a couple before I made up my mind. Only downside is the place is jammed packed, tables are close to each other. Sometimes I felt like I was shouting at my dinner date."
Jill B.,"Las Vegas, NV",10,12,1,4.0,7/17/2014,"Service is always slow at every BJ's I've been to, but this one seemed a little better. Food is always amazing though. Try the eggroll appetizer and crispy jalapeño burger."
Greg K.,"Henderson, NV",493,520,688,3.0,8/17/2010,"Good news is the huge portions and familiar American cuisine that is easy on the palate and friendly to all food tastes.  However, why would anyone want to wait in line for this food is beyond me. Sometimes the lines can be 45 minutes. Do not go there with hungry kids at 5:00 on a Fri/Sat night. You will be distraught over the wait... Otherwise, I enjoyed it overall, but don't plan to go out of my to head back there soon."
Bernadette T.,"Henderson, NV",279,28,75,4.0,6/15/2014,Good family restaurant! Celebrated Father's Day here with the family and had a nice meal. They even gave all the fathers a souvenir beer glass.
Rosa R.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,16,,5.0,10/15/2014,"I love love this place... food and service is always great! The trio pazoooookie ""YUM"" always hits the spot for a sweet craving.."
Kat D.,"Miami, FL",242,218,171,3.0,11/15/2014,"My boyfriend likes the split screen TV at the bar otherwise we wouldn't come here. Service is always bad, but I'm hesitant on writing terrible reviews.  Today however, all 3 bartenders had never heard of Campari.  I'm still not sure if they have it, but most bartenders at the very least have heard about it."
Paveh A.,"Chinatown, Las Vegas, NV",255,25,5,2.0,9/29/2013,"I was very disappointed in BJ's food. I ordered the French dip sandwich  and the runner who brought out the food didn't even notice  that she had a empty sauce dish on the plate that the horseradish sauce should have been in. She then tells me to be careful as the plate is hot, which it was not hot at all. The roast beef on my sandwich was very cold like it just came out of the fridge and the cheese was not even melted. I told my server about my sandwich being very cold ( not even room temp) and he took it back. Ten minutes later he brought me another sandwich which wasn't even warm, crazy how bad the preparation and food quality has gotten here. I don't think I will be back as the last few trips to BJ's I have been really unimpressed with the food."
Kristal R.,"Las Vegas, NV",127,42,5,2.0,12/12/2011,"A group of us decided to dine at BJs on Dec. 3rd.  We get the little buzzer for when your table is ready, and we sit down.  First, there was another diner that was sitting on the bench in the ""waiting"" area breastfeeding her baby.  Why the restaurant would allow this - I have no idea.  But anyhow, we wait for our buzzer to buzz, and low and behold after 15 minutes it's buzzing.  We go up to the front, they get our menus ready and ask us to stand off to the side.  We stand off to the side... for 30 minutes.  The hostess tells us literally about 10 times that our table is being cleaned.  So why ring the buzzer if it wasn't ready the first time?  Finally, the hostess takes us out back to our table, and the table is still dirty!  What in the world??  So we stand there as she grabs a busser to clean the table.  Then we get seated on a wet table. Our waitress comes after a few minutes, and she has this matter-of-fact attitude and doesn't even apologize for the mishap which she clearly knew about because she was talking to the hostess who was telling her about it.  But anyway, we order our drinks.  She comes back and gives everyone the wrong drinks.  Everyone on the table just starts handing out the appropriate drinks to the appropriate people on the table.   We order our food and wait almost another half an hour for our entrees.  The chili was absurdly salty, and it had an alcohol taste to it.  Completely inedible.  We tell this to the waitress, and she apologizes but does nothing about it.  At this point, we conduct ourselves by the dining golden rule to not anger your waitress.  We say nothing further.   I ordered a 12oz steak - medium.  This was the smallest most overcooked steak I have ever had.  It was 6oz at the most.  It was unbelievable.  Underseasoned and lacking from any flavor.  I ask the waitress for steak sauce, and she brings it by and just drops it on the table without even looking my way.   When we were done with our meal, she comes by and tells us ""if you want desert, you can have red velvet pazookie. It's good.""  That's it?  No menu, no other choices?  We pay our bill and leave.  The quality and service was abysmal at this BJs. You're better off going to the one in Centennial or Summerlin."
Kitty R.,"Henderson, NV",0,11,,2.0,5/19/2016,"It's been awhile since I've been to BJ's on Eastern. So I decided to have lunch Saturday with my little girl. I told the waitress my daughter has food allergies and she should alert the cook. I also asked if there was going to be a problem? She said no. Then 20 mins passed, wasn't sure how much longer it was going to be? The waitress said it shouldn't be long. Our food finally arrived. They didn't modify my daughter's order like they should...I was heated. It took forever and my daughter was hungry. The runner told me there wasn't a allergy alert on the ticket. I asked for a manager. She came and apologized and told me there was a allergy alert on the ticket. Idk who's lying here. The waitress already lied to me about not having a problem. The manager came back 10mins later with the correct order. By then my lunch was cold. I had the chicken with rice pilaf and it didn't taste good. Had a few bites and I was done. Not going back again. Not a place for people with food allergies, the wait time is long, and the food was meh."
Candace R.,"Westside, Las Vegas, NV",27,59,303,5.0,11/27/2012,Chain restaurant but tasty and lots of variety.
