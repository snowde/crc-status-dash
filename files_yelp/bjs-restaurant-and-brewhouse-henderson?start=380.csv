Paolo D.,"Las Vegas, NV",811,977,80,3.0,6/10/2010,"Good chain restaurant with good brews. I had their house brand Tempest IPA (not on the menu) and I enjoyed it. Everything we ate was tasty and the service was great. I'd probably rate this place 3.5 stars, but since I have to choose, I'm leaning towards ""A-OK"" rather than the 4-star ""I'm a fan"" option."
Nicholas W.,"Las Vegas, NV",169,226,195,2.0,9/26/2013,"I love the BJ's chain but this restaurant is very hit and miss.  I have had some of the worst service in my life at this place.  Last winter a group of seven sat down for lunch and it took 30 minutes for the drinks and then another 20 minutes to order.  So 50 minutes before we ordered our food.  The pizza at this particular BJs is terrible, they put almost no sauce on the bread and over cook it."
breyna c.,"Wilmot, NH",3,21,1,4.0,1/14/2014,Yes it's a chain restaurant but the food quality is great I love coming here never disappointed they have the best wings and amazing avocado egg rolls I love the pozzikies (I think that's how you spell it) this place is def my guilty pleasure and the service is great
Julie R.,"Westside, Las Vegas, NV",414,22,52,5.0,4/16/2014,I always enjoy eating here. Highly recommend eating their Parmesan crusted chicken & white chocolate macadamia pizooki!
Dan N.,"Pittsburgh, PA",86,113,48,2.0,1/5/2014,"Generally, I like BJ's,  however during our last visit our beers were warm, service was slow and when we said something to our server she didn't offer to correct any of the issues and we ended up leaving to get dessert elsewhere as we were aggravated with the experience.  Not the first time we have had issues with our servers here."
Danielle R.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",1210,879,2797,4.0,6/5/2012,"I like this place. They have a HUGE menu, lots of TV's, and the service is fast and friendly. They also have a 'skinny menu' where everything is under 550 calories. PERFECT. I got a grilled chicken and mango salad and it was amazing, been craving it since.  They also have a large selection of ice teas if you are into flavored tea! I have now been twice and plan to go again. It's casual like a Chili's or Fridays but with better food."
Stefan C.,"San Francisco, CA",167,28,4,5.0,1/12/2014,"For the price, competitors cannot beat the food and atmosphere of this place. I eat at this location with a group of friends regularly. The staff is ALWAYS friendly and plays along with the stupid things that are sometimes said by our group. I'm not proud of this, but we sometimes stay here for three or four hours until closing time. The staff never seems to have a problem with this either. Kudos to them. The menu is surprisingly extensive, and the food quality is great for the price. I enjoy the salads, and the deep dish pizzas are incredibly tasty. Also, get the Pizookie Party Platter with a small group! At the end of the day, the food is good, but the staff is what makes me give this location five stars. Keep up the good work!"
Tony A.,"Las Vegas, NV",3,4,,5.0,5/18/2014,"Great appetizers and even better beers.  If you like pale ales, try the Piranha (It could become your favorite).  They have a patio which is key for those of us from California."
Aimee L.,"Las Vegas, NV",54,9,1,5.0,7/14/2014,"GREAT DINNER! GOOD SERVICE! Consistent.  My boyfriend and I came in for dinner the other night and sat at the bar. The bartender was so nice and so accommodating. We hope they will add ""sweet potato fries"" to the menu soon just because we think it would make a great addition! Who doesn't love sweet potato fries? Anyhow, the beers were good and the Black and Bleu Burgers were to die for! Happy with our choice to go to BJ's on Eastern. It was a great dinner.  PS. Add Sweet Potato Fries to the menu pleasssssse! :)"
Carissa P.,"Reno, NV",4,41,22,2.0,6/6/2014,"Food is cold, over rated, not fresh and service isn't friendly. Waiters are always rushing you to order. This BJ's on this side of town is awful! Please get better management."
Monica W.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,18,,1.0,4/2/2013,FOOD= horrible STAFF= Server was nice & management horrible PRICE= $$ Management here really needs a clean up at this location. BEWARE!!!!!!!!  My husband and I were sharing the spinach dip and he cracked his tooth on something he spit out everything his tooth shattered and there was chunks of glass in our spinach dip!!!!! We got the manager and he said he would take care of the dip (well I certainly hope so) but we wanted to know how our dip had crushed glass in there!!!  Couldn't even finish our dinner since my husbands tooth was shattered and the manager gave the number to their HR department. Basically the manager and the HR lady never got back to us for paying this horrible incident. Never going back to this location.
Gordon K.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,2,,1.0,8/17/2014,"Ordered a medium rare burger. Came out well done, sent it back and was told the ""chef"" would be recooking it himself. It then came out around medium well and not a drop of seasoning. My server, Aaron, was terrible. Ran out of soda twice, he never checked to see how things were, we got more service from the hostess. After he finally dropped our bill off it took 10 minutes for him to pick them back up.  I used to love this place, looks like they must  have a new FOH manager and or new chef.  Stay away from this place until they fix the issues.   TERRIBLE"
Caroline J.,"Henderson, NV",182,119,42,4.0,8/1/2011,"Sometimes it is difficult being gluten-free. I'm not talking about being gluten free to jump on the new diet fad bandwagon; I'm talking about having to eat gluten free or suffering the nauseous, gut wrenching pain of gluten poisoning. So when I had to leave Chicago, which has a plethora of gluten free establishments, to live in Las Vegas I was nervous that I wouldn't have many options that didn't completely empty my wallet and bank account each week. Thankfully, I have found BJ's.  I don't know about the rest of their menu, but I've eaten off their gluten free menu and I will continue to do so for a very long time.  Do I eat healthy? Sure. Do I workout? Absolutely, 6 times a week or more. Does a girl have to start off the meal with a bowl of luscious, cream filled tomato bisque that makes my veins fight to keep unblocked? Yes. Does a girl have to eat some pizza with melty, oozy mozzarella cheese, Italian Sausage, garlic and fresh basil once a month? Darn tootin'. Does a girl have to finish the above meal with a GLUTEN FREE CHOCOLATE CHIP PIZOOKIE?!? ABSO-FREAKING-LUTELY!!! Oh that tomato bisque. You creamy souptastic gluten free deliciousness. Your high fat and calorie content would normally make a health nut like me cringe and hide under a table. However, when you come to the table, lightly garnished with parsley, smelling like Mom's tomato soup when I was a kid, I must devour every last bite. I did today. I almost stabbed my fiance with a spoon to get the last drop. You have to understand that there are some restaurants (*cough* Aurelio's *cough*) that seem to think that gluten free means that either we don't really like food or that we don't know what real food should taste like. Some gluten free pizzas have this bland, eerily flaky, bulky pizza crust that can barely brown when cooked let alone withstand pizza sauce, cheese and other ingredients (see above coughing spasm). BJ's makes this amazing thin crust pizza that is perfectly thin, crispy and has garlic and herbs infused in the crust to make me remember why pizza makes my heart sing every time I ate it back in Chicago. The Italian sausage was not as good as Chicago, but it still hit the spot, especially when they drowned the pizza with deliciously melted mozzarella cheese with roasted garlic. As I ate it I forgot that I was gluten free and simply enjoyed my food. Pure comfort. I could go on for pages about that freaking pizookie. You guys, it is a deep dish chocolate chip cookie with ice cream on top. When I say ice cream I really should clarify one thing. By the time it gets to the table it isn't completely ice cream anymore because that warm, gooey, rich and downright sinful gluten free cookie melts that simple ice cream and makes dessert something that will haunt me whenever I go to the gym (which is right down the street). One thing: I can't wait for their gluten free menu to grow. Right now they have some soups, salads, pizza and giant stuffed baked potatoes. Don't forget that pizookie too! Maybe some flatbread, hamburgers and a couple other entrees other than a balsamic chicken would be FANTASTIC!!! Service was great. Water never went empty for more than one second, very friendly, patient and knew his gluten free items. His service was flawless, and I could not have felt more comfortable eating there as someone with a major allergy. If I wasn't suffering from a food coma I would go find his name off the receipt, but right now laying in bed with a round, full tummy seems like the perfect way to enjoy the rest of this meal."
Darcy D.,"Henderson, NV",46,21,18,3.0,3/11/2014,"Consistent and easy for everyone to find something they like... If you're looking to avoid waiting for a table, open sitting in the bar doesn't seem to be much different with regard to service speed or atmosphere..."
Bennett L.,"San Diego, CA",31,213,240,4.0,9/4/2009,"I've been to BJ's restaurants in Eugene and San Diego and this is far and away the best.  It's casual dining but in a very nice setting.  This BJ's is new to the area (border of Vegas and Henderson in Silverado Ranch) and has a split level dining hall.  The upper level has the bar which has a bitchin' hd video screen tuned to all kinds of sports including the glorious MLB Network. Service is friendly and the staff is well educated on the huge menu.  Seriously, you'll really find just about anything when it comes to standard American food.  There's also a huge beer list of domestics, imports and special brews exclusive to BJ's. Here's my gluttonous rundown: Oktoberfest beer: I was talked into starting off with the limited edition house beer called Oktoberfest.  Good choice. Tomato basil soup: fresh and warm topped with bread pieces.  Tasty and simple. Fettucini Alfredo with Blackened Chicken: This entrée off the lunch menu was the low point.  The pasta was undercooked and a little tough.  Garlic bread was too hard.  At least the chicken was cooked well. Peanut Butter Piezookie:  Im not a religious man but if there's a heaven, this must be what they serve.  Freshly baked peanut butter cookie topped with two big scoops of vanilla ice cream.  Death row inmates should request this for a last meal.  Go to BJ's for this item alone and you'll leave happy. The service was very good.  Maybe a little too good.  There could have been a few less ""how is everything?"" moments in mid-bite.  Maybe they thought I was a critic or something since I took pics of everything. I will hand it to my server who followed me to the parking lot with the keys I forgot at my table. I will definitely be back.  This review would be five stars if not for the issues with my entrée."
Shannon S.,"Henderson, NV",178,146,44,4.0,1/24/2014,"Who doesn't like beer, pizza, and of course giant chocolate chip cookies? No one. BJ's brewery is awesome. It has a nice atmosphere and it is very family-friendly. The food in general is good. I really have never had a horrible meal there. The restaurant is always clean and inviting and they always play the best sports matches. It's loud enough in there to be fun but quite enough to have business meetings and talk with a friend or coworker over a nice meal. To be honest, the only thing I don't like is that there is barely anything on the menu lesson 700 cal. And that does not include the side dishes."
Michele M.,"Henderson, NV",92,251,403,3.0,3/22/2012,Service was decent but the place was super busy so it's understandable that the waiter wasn't better. Spinach dip was yummy!
Josh M.,"Las Vegas, NV",83,63,,4.0,10/2/2011,"The deep dish pizza here is always amazing.  I get the BBQ chicken and bacon with extra cilantro on top.....THE BEST!!!! The service is usually sub-par but it's Vegas.  Unless you're at a high-end restaurant, you can't expect much."
Oana S.,"Las Vegas, NV",209,81,10,2.0,7/19/2014,"The food was average, and the service was lacking.  I had the salmon and a salad.  The salad was good, the salmon was average, and the asparagus was bitter and burned.  My friend ordered the beet salad only and the server didn't trouble herself to let me friend know that they were out of the beet salad until my entree arrived.  Not cool."
Sham M.,"Henderson, NV",85,23,1,4.0,4/2/2013,This restaurant has the friendliest of service. Food is of consistent high quality. The only draw back is the noise because of several high volume TVs making conversation difficult.
