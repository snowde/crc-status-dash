Terry M.,"Las Vegas, NV",39,39,1,4.0,1/29/2017,"Our first and second time here was an awesome experience!       The food was on par, the service was excellent and we even got the manager to come to our table and take a pic with us and a friend we had brought in with us to try their famous Pazookie dessert. I tried the deep dish Pepperoni and 5 cheese pizza and my ex had a BBQ Brisket sandwich.  We practice Dicing 2 eat so the die each made us try a different drink, I had a Black cherry handcrafted soda which I didnt think was that great and he had a soda.     Super crowded but that is usually a good sign and wait time was very minimal.   oh and they have a revolving door to get in and out which I love! The second time we came here, I tried the Paella.   Delicious, not as spicy as they claim it to be but most of the food that people say is spicy doesnt really seem so much so to me, I am so used to eating really spicy food I guess  :/       My friend had a steak which was excellent of course. Our Third experience here which was tonight was not that great as far as service goes.   It started off alright and of course the food was excellent as always, The die made me try a flatbread pizza which for me was new as I usually prefer deep dish when we come here, I have had a mini deep dish in the past which was awesome!      My ex who was with me had to try a cocktail called The Strawberry Smash which he said he liked.    And he ordered the bbq Brisket sandwich again which was just as good as the first time he ordered it.    Great thing about Bj's seems to be the food is always consistantly good! When we finished eating though, service became slow and they werent that busy, our waiter disappeared and we waited a full 15 minutes before we finally asked a random server if he could bring us to go boxes for the leftover pizza, some for me, some for him to take.    We waited another 10 mins and never saw our server again, we asked if someone else could take the check for us so we could get going and the man told us that our server was in the back and he would make sure he was told we were ready to go.    Another 10 mins and we were still waiting so we asked a 3rd server if we could pay and he took the credit card and came back a few minutes later. We never saw our server again, no goodbye, sayonara, adios, nothing!    No worries though, we are 20%++ tippers when we are happy and we just were not this time, next time we will ask for a different server."
Billie B.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,24,6,5.0,7/20/2017,"Stopped in here for a late lunch. Sat at the bar and Bill was our server/bartender. Bill was dope and super helpful. I love when people seem to actually enjoy their job, makes for a good reason to come back and ask for them by name. He's a great bartender and when I asked him to make me a surprise cocktail he didn't hesitate and made a great drink. Keep it up Bill.  Pizza came out perfect as usual. I've never had a bad bjs pizza though.  Good pizza. Great service. We'll be back to this location soon."
Destinee P.,"Las Vegas, NV",53,86,39,5.0,6/9/2017,"I have came to this place a few times. It's very spacious and seems like a nice place to hang out. The food is amazing. The menu is very big which gives you so many options. I like to try different things every time I come here. My favorite drink is the pink Cadillac. It's so good, not too fruity but still pretty awesome. I live pretty close so if I ever want to grab a quick meal and hang out this is the place. I recommend this restaurant to anyone who like a great meal, a great drink and able to just relax and be at a place where you can just be yourself and not have to over dress."
Shawn C.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,39,,3.0,10/24/2017,"I've been to this location a few times, but this review is based upon my experience today: Positives:  Waitress was outstanding - right amount of checking and staying away, a true pro Sat promptly once both in our party arrived for lunch Everything was very clean Negatives: Only one - if you are putting a sandwich on the ""lunch menu"" at a ""reduced price"", I still expect it to be a decent sandwich.  2 thin slices of ham on a ham and grilled cheese does not cut it, especially at the low, low price of $9.50, c'mon. Sorry, but I go out to eat for the food, so this significantly drags down my overall experience (flavor was ok). I would still recommend this restaurant, but avoid this paltry sandwich."
Ricardo M.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,13,,3.0,5/15/2017,"Only getting 3 stars because of the food !!!  Horrible service , took about atleast 10 minutes to be greeted. Server looked like they didnt care much. Ordered my sons food, waited a bit to order mine thinking i would get his quick so he can eat first. funny to say my food STILL came out before his. What a joke!! Awesome food but man get some new staff!"
Gabriel S.,"Las Vegas, NV",111,114,858,5.0,12/4/2016,"Came to this location at 10:30pm on a Sunday night with a friend for a night cap. We got a booth right next to a TV so I could watch sports center while women ramble as usual. Any who.. I got dry rub wings and she got a portobello mushrooms salad, along with a ""Strawberry Splash"" with a little extra vodka inside ;-)  Our server Brandon was great, he even took a few bucks off the meal simply because he's cool like that! Only other BJ's I've been towas in California. I didn't know they were a national franchise company. I'm sure I'll return soon. Now that I know about this location. I recommend this place for a nice dinner. Prices not too bad either. Bring 40- 70 bucks with you for 2 people."
Jonathan Z.,"Henderson, NV",25,28,9,4.0,9/26/2017,Great variety on menu.  Beer list is varied as well.   They sometimes have good beer from their own brewer.  The sound is loud. I like their bar and bartenders.  The Great White is my favorite white pizza and I usually don't like white pizzas but almost always at least order the mini here even if I am ordering other foods.   Their soups are all greAt!
Roo B.,"Las Vegas, NV",4,42,4,5.0,8/6/2017,"First time at a BJ's...don't know why I waited so long!  Great menu options, but opted for the cherry chipotle salmon dish.  WOW!  Very nice flavors, perfectly cooked.  Nice and healthy too.  Our server was amazing!  Never let our jack and cokes get empty  :)  Most definitely coming back for the salmon!"
Gabe S.,"Las Vegas, NV",13,34,53,4.0,6/9/2017,"I went there in a Friday afternoon and was sat right away even though the place looked really busy. The waitress was really friendly. Food was good. I had the mozzarella sticks which could be served with more marinara sauce. I also had the BBQ salad which as awesome. I asked for Tabasco from a passing waitress who forgot to bring it but the main waitress brought I right away when I asked. Also had some drinks that I thought were on happy hour but we were not sitting in the bar area, so happy hour didn't apply. It would have been nice to know that beforehand. Overall it was a really nice and I enjoyed it."
Presley W.,"Henderson, NV",147,7,,5.0,9/28/2017,Bjs is definitely underrated!! I honestly forgot it even exists till recently i've been addicted! definitely fresh delicious food!!! the lunch & dinner options vary my favorite is the santa fe chick salad ahhhhh it is so bomb!!! of course i please myself to a monkey bread pizookie just to make sure i'm extra full & satisfied so i have a difficult time walking to the car lol.. ALSO they have curbside pick up!! or take out orders & the service is always great!
David V.,"Las Vegas, NV",281,30,11,5.0,9/13/2017,Definitely a better experience this time.  I had a RibEye Steak w Spinach Dip for an appetizer and enjoyed both of them.  They were pretty busy but my food came quick and the waiter Dan was very attentive.
Trixie N.,"Las Vegas, NV",888,306,3128,4.0,1/17/2016,"BJs is a favorite for our family. There is always something for everyone when it comes to food and beer selection. Depending on the time of day you arrive, you will probably wait and have to park in the adjacent lot. One trick we used to do growing up that we still do, is drop one person off at the door to put our name down while the other parks. It saves time!  At BJs, they have a skinny menu that tells you the calories for the items. For those who don't care, there plenty of higher calorie tasty menu items as well- Burgers, Pizza flatbreads, etc BJs has also jumped on the Sriracha band wagon, a favorite hot sauce to us Asians. They have created a Mac and cheese with Sriracha sauce... Amazing! My daughter likes this dish and I have taken several bites off her plate, I do like it. If you want something spicy or have kids that have jumped on the Sriracha bandwagon, this is a GoTo. I really enjoy their lower calorie items like the seared Ahi tuna salad or their quinoa bowls. The ahi tuna salad is just fantastic. A large bowl of greens, with dabs of wasabi sauce on the sides of the dish. The ahi tuna is nicely seared and adds a fab protein. Highly recommend!"
Jason C.,"Henderson, NV",1,25,1,3.0,9/12/2017,"The atmosphere is very welcoming. I ordered a oasis amber beer that was perfect. I also ordered the top sirloin. The steak was just okay, I had to drown it in steak sauce to finish it. The one thing I found to be off putting was the tablet each waitress carries. I felt like I was giving my order to a fast food worker with no personality. I would return, but with lower expectations."
Brian F.,"Las Vegas, NV",19,117,261,4.0,3/29/2016,"This place has decent food, variety of everything, big menu, full bar, open late.  This review is mainly for their Pizzokie's! My go to place to get these wonderful things. Half cooked melty gooey cookie with cold ice cream on top. Hard to beat. Recently came here - I order the Pizzokie trio and the new monkey bread Pizzokie. I ordered the classic (Chocolate Chip Cookie with Vanilla ice cream), cookies and cream cookie with vanilla ice cream, salted caramel cookie with vanilla ice cream. All were fantastic - the salted caramel with pretzel was my favorite The new monkey Bread had great flavor and was delicious! It isn't true monkey bread - but for what it was it was really good!"
Anthony M.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,5,,5.0,9/27/2017,Love this place. I have been eating here for the last couple of years. Everything on the menu is great. I really like the pizza as well. Service has always been very good. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone.
Shawn J.,"Henderson, NV",450,792,202,4.0,2/12/2016,"I've been a fan of BJ's since I moved to Vegas, and the Henderson location in particular. There are a couple of things that keep me coming back. 1: Fast curbside pickup. Pull in, call the number on the sign, and they bring your food right to you. 2: Santa Fe Spring Rolls...YUM! 3: Avocado Egg Rolls are ordered every time, and are always good. 4: Mediterranean Pizza. It's a taste that's not for everyone but if you love Kalamata olives like I do, you know what you want and this is a good place to get it.  Inside service can be hit or miss so we just order it to go so we can sit at home and watch Netflix without having to put up with a lot of extra noise, or watch a good game without sound which I don't like doing. 4 Stars...yeah, it's been awhile since I did my last review but 4 years later I'm still going back, and it's still good."
Shannon W.,"Rogue River, OR",0,5,14,5.0,9/16/2017,"We love the casual atmosphere and consistency of this place, but the stars go to our server, Rachel. It is quite difficult to dine out with a severe lily allergy. With that being said, she and the rest of staff took extraordinary measures to protect me from a reaction. They created a dish that was so perfect, I actually cleaned the plate. Thank you so very much, I know where I can eat without suffering afterwards! Xx"
Jill M.,"Las Vegas, NV",4,52,83,5.0,1/28/2017,"Great atmosphere!  The restaurant always keeps busy and has delicious food!  I have never been disappointed with the food, service, or drinks.  Ask for Dan!  He is fun, friendly, and always good for a smile!  Your whole family will love it.  Don't forget to try the pizookie.  My son's favorite is Oreo."
Ellen A.,"Las Vegas, NV",11,13,1,2.0,9/1/2017,"On 8/31/17, friends we hadn't seen in over 3 years wanted to take us out. We chose BJ's because even though they are a little pricey, the food has always been good. Not sure what happened but the experience was not what we anticipated. I ordered chicken cobb salad (how can salad get screwed up?). Not sure if it was the dressing, lettuce or cucumber but tasted like it had been doused with bad cologne. My gut still wrenches at the thought. Didn't complain because didn't want to embarrass friends, and they were buying. Just packed up what was left, took it home and threw it out. Husband ordered spaghetti which he said was extremely dry. He didn't want to complain for same reason as me. If I was paying that salad would've been sent back! I'll give you one more chance BJ's. Don't disappoint me."
Kevin H.,"Las Vegas, NV",25,16,30,3.0,3/17/2017,"My family and I decided to visit Bj's instead of Cheese Cake factory. The server was amazing and on point. They've installed a new system that does not allow servers to create meals. In the past I've ordered a Patty melt with no problem. Today due to the new system it was not an option. I've ordered regular nachos as well...again not so able. My sister complained to the manager who was able to by pass the new computer system. While waiting for the food, runners came to the table with the wrong food. The runner apologized stating he read the ticket wrong. The waitresses seemed frustrated because the system is sub par. The food came with sides that were not requested. My wife ordered Chicken Parm with broccoli but instead got mash potatoes. The main meal came prior to the appetizer. The food tasted fair! Aside from the system and few hic-ups...not bad"
