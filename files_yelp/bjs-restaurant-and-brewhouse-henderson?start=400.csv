Kevin H.,"Las Vegas, NV",88,126,6,4.0,3/1/2012,"They have their own microbrews which is pretty cool.  I've only tried a couple, but I really really enjoy the harvest hefeweizen. I really only go to this place for beers and clam chowder.  There's lots of other stuff on the menu, but I haven't bothered with it too much.  I like the clam chowder so much I feel like I'm missing out if I try anything else.  With that said, I have tried a burger and a pizza here.  Both were pretty good if my memory serves me. The clam chowder in a sourdough bowl.   Its good clam chowder; thick without being too thick.  The best part is the bread bowl though.  They butter the hell out of the ""lid"" and toast it.  It's amazing.  The bread is flakey on the outside and soft on the inside. The service is about average but they do seem to get overwhelmed during happy hour times."
Heather S.,"Henderson, NV",0,1,,1.0,7/13/2014,"Worst service ever!  They are slow for everything drinks, food, etc.  When you do finally get your food it is cold! Need new servers and new management.  NEVER going again. Poor poor poor."
Marie B.,"Henderson, NV",27,110,250,4.0,2/11/2014,"Stopped by to have a quick lunch. We ordered chicken quesadilla and pizza. Both were lunch specials. They were both delicious. Yeah, we'll be back. Perhaps for dinner next time."
Ed R.,"Reno, NV",12,138,,2.0,1/25/2012,"Just finished one of the lunch specials called Baracoa Taco's. The tag-line for these was low calories. There was a picture of the plate on a table tent, looked good, went for it. And then, it was served...and luckily I have good vision, or I am afraid I would not have seen them. Tere are three tiny tacos and a bowl of black beens. The tacos were maybe 3 or 4 inches in diameter, and the beans in the picture number likely  around 200, and I got maybe 30, covered in bean sauce. They should have placed a quarter on the plate in the picture to give some sense of scale. They could have served an eighth of a hamburger and got away with the same lo-cal claim. Anything reduced to micro size will be lo-cal. As for taste, OK, no better. Ate there a week ago with a friend and had a burger, Average at best."
Keith P.,"Henderson, NV",0,8,,5.0,7/8/2015,"I've not been to BJ's in a while, and I'm not sure why I stayed away. I just had the Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos and loved them.  I'm going back."
Jodi J.,"Las Vegas, NV",21,28,,4.0,3/1/2014,"Great beer and pizza, Chicago style. The Cajun pasta is also really good. And don't forget to order a Pizookie. Proceeds support cystic fibrosis so you don't even have to feel bad about ordering dessert."
Kevin D.,"Henderson, NV",164,125,14,2.0,8/20/2013,"What the heck happened?  This place used to deliver great value.  Our pizza was served cold, the wait staff was either over-taxed or out-to-lunch.  Regardless of the promotional discount, I may return, if only for a beer.  The pizza is a big miss."
Tyler B.,"Henderson, NV",7,62,5,1.0,2/9/2012,"It hurts me to even write this review but I feel like I should at least give a little heads up to someone who might be trying their lunch menu. I had the barbacoa tacos which consist of three super small tacos filled very conservatively and a side of black beans. Flavor was moderate. My GF had the fish tacos which looked normal size and pretty delicious. Sadly the appearance didn't match the taste. When I had a bite it tasted like a frozen fish stick stuck inside of a bland tortilla. Our other friend had the dinner jambalaya and they thought it was really tasty. We had the pizookie trio for dessert and it as always was awesome.  As for the service, started off ok but ended pretty bad. We were waiting for our refills and thought it was taking a bit long when we noticed that our waiter was standing back in the servers holding a conversation with his friend. Luckily another waitress came by and pretty much took over our table until he finished his conversation.  From what I can tell this is the type of place where it's best just to eat off their dinner menu no matter what. I thought lunch menu meant same quality smaller portions but apparently it means smaller portions and no quality. As for the service I still think there will always be a few bad apples no matter where you go and it seems that I just have bud luck at this location.  Probably going to drive across town next time and see if I can better service and order my delicious buffalo chicken pizza and rootbeer."
Gregory A.,"Las Vegas, NV",45,187,64,4.0,1/30/2012,"Good Food, Usually good service...I love the Seared Ahi  on the Small bites menu, and the California Club Flatbread pizza."
Rajesh M.,"Las Vegas, NV",106,27,5,3.0,2/13/2014,The Food is good. The waiter we had on this particular day wasnt the best they have. We were hungry and the food arrived late. The overall experience isnt something i  would want when i go out to eat.
Aaron V.,"Anaheim, CA",164,3,,5.0,5/1/2014,The BBQ lunch platter is perfect!  Just enough to get my BBQ fix without putting myself into a protein coma.  Always get the best service at BJ's- what a great place! The waiter and manager made us feel welcome.
M W.,"Henderson, NV",3,54,39,5.0,2/4/2014,"Food is delicious. Great place to take anyone. Family friendly, has a full bar, tv's all over and just about a little bit of everything as far as food. This is one of my favorite spots!"
Anabel B.,"Henderson, NV",40,72,20,1.0,2/14/2013,"Sorry BJ'S, our last visit has made me decide that we can no longer be friends. Although you do normally serve delicious food, our last visit here during the early evening hours left us wanting more. Our server ignored us for our entire meal, we had to get her attention for more napkins and water (even after she said she'd be back with more water), and she seemed entirely pre-occupied. We had our 2 year old with us and that, unfortunately, sometimes seems to scare our servers off. Our child was very well-behaved and we ALWAYS clean up after ourselves. Although you are normally an awesome place for happy hour or a dinner for two, please do not ignore your paying customers (and good tippers I might add) just because they have a little one."
Sharon M.,"Henderson, NV",693,13,,5.0,6/9/2012,"Fabulous. Extremely reasonable. Great culinary selections. Their Pizookies will set you FREE!!! If you ever have a question about what 'service/ should be, BJ's defines it. Anyone I've every escorted here has demanded to return the very next day.  Go figure."
Kayla W.,"Las Vegas, NV",79,151,100,4.0,12/20/2011,"We had a group of 17 people when I came to BJ's for the first time ever! We did put in a reservation and they accommodated us very well. I felt like we were at one of those huge tables you see in mansions where only like 1-3 people normally eat at, but we took up all the space ! Our waitress was very tentative and there was never really a drink empty too long before she had a new one. She was super funny too.  My food was pretty great. I have a flatbread with bacon and ranch, super good. Everyone else in the group seemed to really enjoy their food. Those next to me had these massive burgers that they scarfed down.  I will have to come back when I can get a drink or two because I heard their selection was pretty great, but I was not allowed to cocktail with this group.  Overall, I really enjoyed my first time here and will try to be back soon!"
Lara M.,"Austin, TX",207,140,1,4.0,4/5/2011,"Went here for a family dinner with the monkeys and friend. BJ's has always been a random craving of mine...when its met...I don't need it again for quite sometime. This was one of those nights that I needed it and might have traded my kids for it (just maybe). We roll in and there was a small wait...no biggie. I situate the kids with their DVD players and my friend grabs two beers from the bar (I had girly cider...I thought I was ordering their homemade berry beer...I guess they don't make it anymore...bummer) and my friend got some sort of IPA...quite good. BZZZZZ...our pager goes off (much to the delight of my kids) and my daughter rips it out of my hand to give it to the hostess (she's a tenacious little bugger). We were sat at a lovely booth (perfect for kids) and decided to get the Ahi Poke to start. It was yummy with wonton chips that kind of reminded me of Sun Chips, big chunks of yellowfin tuna, avocado, cabbage and vinaigrette. All of it was good except for the avocado which could have been a bit more ripe but it was certainly edible. The pizza was next and it was good but it didn't knock my socks off (pepperoni, mushroom, extra cheese and sausage). The stewed tomatoes were excellent but the crust was a bit gooey-er than I remember....nothing a side of ranch couldn't fix. I downed two pieces (no one could ever accuse me of having an eating disorder). Lastly, we were all full but we couldn't leave without trying one of their famous Pizzoki and Creme. They have expanded their pazzoki selection and now offer a trio so you can sample more of what they have to offer. We went for the chocolate chip, Oreo and oatmeal raisin. Holy cow was that tasty. My son very much liked the chocolate chip and Oreo however my daughter just went for the ice cream.  All in all I was a very happy camper. The service is fine but nothing to write home about. Will be back when the next craving hits or maybe sooner because they have a gluten-free pizza that my mom can enjoy as well."
Dan P.,"Las Vegas, NV",281,162,102,4.0,4/25/2011,"Great food, great beer selection, mediocre brewery.  Well, to be fair, we came here after a beer sampling session at Khoury's.  We had just finished drinking some of the finest beers available in Vegas (and some not available in Vegas).   To drink I had the house brown ale.  It was sweet, dark, and very malty.  There was a strange chemical taste to it as well, perhaps.  I tried some of my friend's stout, and it was also pretty mediocre.  His description of this stout is classic, ""It reminds me of Pirates of the Caribbean.""  What a great description, ha!  However bad the brewery is here, the guest beer selection is amazingly great, and completely makes up for it.   If you aren't a beer drinker, the food here is worth having too.  I had the shrimp pasta, and loved it entirely.  It was more dry than typical restaurant pastas, which I loved because the sauces these places use usually get gross after a while.  I could eat this pasta all day.  It might have been a little over priced, but I didn't mind at all.  My friend had a big deep dish pizza.  I didn't try any, but it looked delicious (and he confirmed this for me).  We also had the potato skins as an appetizer, and again a huge hit.  These were big thick potato chunks with skin, along with bacon and cheese.  Yummy.  They came with ranch and sour cream sauces. A little expensive, and the house brewery didn't impress me (as a craft beer drinker), but the guest beer selection was great.  The food was definitely top notch for a hipster type restaurant.  I'd go again!"
Jennie C.,"Hercules, CA",16,155,162,5.0,11/18/2013,I've been to a bunch of BJ's in California...and I like consistency. I was looking forward to a gluten free pizza and a gluten free pizzookie and that's exactly what I got...the best part was the service with a smile from Jennifer. I would definitely return to this location. Great gluten free pizza and dessert...yum yum...oh and the house-made root beer is not to be missed.
Jimmy W.,"North Las Vegas, NV",10,109,109,4.0,12/3/2013,"Lunch crowd was very busy but the bar has open tables and booths. Nice menu selection and good weekday deals. I had lunch special half California chicken sandwich, soup, and fries for $7.99. Tuesdays is half off all wine by the glass and bottle so I also took advantage of that! Nothing really special but over all good service, good atmosphere and make sure to take a look at their daily specials."
Melissa R.,"Las Vegas, NV",530,99,78,4.0,12/20/2010,"Hmm, I can't say too much about this place because I came in a bit tipsy ;P Other than the good atmosphere and good seating area, this place is great for watching the games. I've tried a sip of black velvet from a friend, and I must say, it's the best I've tried by far..."
