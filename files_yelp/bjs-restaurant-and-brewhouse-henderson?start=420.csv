Kim F.,"Henderson, NV",48,11,1,2.0,7/14/2013,"I ordered the top sirloin medium rare. When I cut into it I discovered it was well done! A server did not come around until 15 minutes later. By then I had decided to try it. Dry and tough!!!! The server ask if I wanted another, but my friends were almost done with their meal. So I just told her I was very disappointed and did not finish the steak. No compensation was made. I guess BJ's us just not a place for steak. Very disappointing."
Michell M.,"Irvine, CA",58,16,9,4.0,1/22/2011,"I love their deep dish pizzas and pizookies - their signatures! This place can get busy, but wait times aren't too long. Also, the servers and whole staff are very friendly. I did order take-out last week and my order was wrong. I'm a vegetarian, so part of my order was a vegetarian mini; however, we got 2 BJ's Favorite minis. It was a hassle that we had to go back to get my vegetarian pizza, but at least they upgraded it to a small without charging. My friend got to keep the second BJ's Favorite mini, too. My only disappointment was that the hostess/cashier claimed that she checked the pizzas to make sure they were the correct ones, but the meat was quite OBVIOUS and couldn't be mistaken. We are human and everyone makes mistakes, but please do not lie to me. Especially to my face. Well... I do not hold grudges, so 4 stars!  :)"
Gregory B.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,1,,1.0,5/10/2014,"Let me start off by saying that we have come to this location for many years, but this time was our last. The experience here has slowly declined over time. Our previous two visits were an insult to the restaurant business. I, myself, am a server and therefore understand when certain circumstances arise that problems may happen. That being said, our last two visits made me never want to return.  We had the same server, Jennifer S., both times. Her initial approach to the table took exceedingly long both times ( over 15 minutes). Once we got out drink and appetizer order in the waiting only further continued. Drinks took another 15 minutes to come out (soft drinks) and the appetizers never came out at all. Spoke with the manger, he apologized, and said he would make sure everything went more smoothly.  He could only compensate so much for the lack of abilities from the server. Once our food came out, she, along with anyone else, besides the manager once, never checked on us again for the remainder of our visit.  We decided to give them another chance today, assuming that maybe it was a fluke. However, once we were seated and again started waiting, we knew there was a reason why we didn't want to come back. We had the same server as last time. This time, she greater us and it only took ten minutes. Drinks and appetizers came out in another ten, but we were without silverware. Our food came out in another half and hour, but we were still without silver because nobody had checked on us since we received our drinks and appetizers. So now, with salads, appetizers, both untouched because of no silverware, we had more food. Silverware came out when it decided it wanted to apparently. After speaking to the manager again, and explaining the events on this occasion and the last, he apologized and we received silverware. Our server came back once more before the end of the meal, and that was to drop off the bill. We had no refills or boxes until right when we were going to walk out.  This being said, the food here is excellent and has always been.  Our service, and our server, were the worst I have ever experienced. Every time we would ask for something, which surprisingly wasn't that often since she rarely made an appearance at the table, she would say ""thank you"".  Even when she forgot something, there was no apology, only a ""thank you"". She obviously doesn't care about returning customers or customer service at all for that matter. She is bringing the restaurant down single handedly. I can, in no way, speak for others who she served, but I did hear other tables around us complaining at the same time.  We would love to have a reason to come back here, but due to the lack of service quality, follow through from management, and overall poor dining experience, I don't know if I will be returning.  If you must eat at BJ's restaurants, please choose another location at the very least. You will be disappointed if you cone here expecting a nice experience. ""Thank you"""
David S.,"Las Vegas, NV",570,1050,274,3.0,3/25/2011,"It has been a while since I have been here. I remember fond memories of this place, but this time around, I am beginning to wonder why. On several occasions I was told to go for the happy hour because they are suppose to be one of the best.  With a dollar discount off of appetizers, I cannot say I am too impressed. Alcohol is not that cheap either; beers range around five dollars, dollar off of certain mixed drinks, and $4.25 for well drinks. I can think of many places that offer  better deals.  We started with a platter of potato skins, which were made perfectly. They were golden brown and remand crunchy even as we slowly ate them throughout the two hours we sat there. The sampler seared ahi is just that, a small taste, so do not expect a lot.   The real savings is if you decide to do the individual pizzas because they are half off. The pleasant memories of this deep dish pie is nothing close to the past. I got the BBQ chicken pizza. The crust was mediocre. It had a crisp edge, but the center was too doughy.  I usually can tolerate Chicago style. but the lack of sauce and dryness of the chicken made everything difficult to get down.  My friends ordered the mac & cheese, a bacon cheeseburger, and a chili cheeseburger. They were all satisfied with their orders. The chili cheeseburger took ten minutes longer than everything else. We were shocked by how many people apologized for the delay and the manager even stopped by to tell us that the burger would be comp. Even though we didn't think too much about it, this gesture was really impressive. As one friend recounted her disappointment with the pizza the last time she came, I should have took it as a hint to not order it and go with something else.  We ended our dining experience with a chocolate chip pazookie. The cookie was a bit on the raw side, but I didn't mind it. Eating cookie dough was always a bad habit I had as a child. With two heaping scoops of ice cream, it disappeared fast."
Robert W.,"Pleasant Grove, UT",40,20,,4.0,1/4/2012,"BJ's Henderson has really very good food, lots of variety, well trained staff and is apparently well run.  Many Yelp reviews indicate a successful dining experience is very likely here. Somebody may have had a less quality experience, but ours was VERY GOOD! Those less than good results may be ""an off night"" or just bad luck, I can't say, what we saw and experienced was all positive.   Judy was our server, perfectly attentive,with sound recommendations. I would, and will come back without any hesitation."
Melissa C.,"Henderson, NV",6,7,,4.0,8/1/2013,"Extensive menu, above average food, decent beer selection."
Jen S.,"Las Vegas, NV",156,404,225,3.0,12/17/2010,"Stopped after the Black and White Elite event for the after party and some dinner. This is another brewery restaurant chain, similar to Gordon Biersch or even Yard House.  They have a large selection of house beers from very light to very dark.  There is also a very large selection of non-house beers on tap and in bottles.  I didn't drink any beer that night so this review is just for the food and service. Again since this is a chain, so I feel there is nothing special about the food.  It is your typical brewpub items such as artichoke dip, potato skins, buffalo wings, pizza, etc.  The food wasn't bad by any means, but nothing really stood out.  The staff was nice enought to let us partake in late night happy hour specials (2200 to close) 15 minutes early.  The specials were $2 off all apps and 1/2 off all the mini sized pizzas. The service was efficient and friendly.  My ice tea was refilled frequently even though I wasn't sitting at the bar.  Total bill for my mini pizza and chicken fingers was $18 with tax and tip."
Aaron F.,"Reno, NV",129,141,37,3.0,8/27/2013,"Ok. If you come here, make sure you order the brewed sodas! Delicious and frosty cream soda and root beer for starters makes this a nice hang out. Feeling like some booze? Try a delicious beer from their brewery. My personal favorites? Try the stout and the Jeremiah Red. All these with a pizza is a great way to spend an evening. For dessert make It easy on yourselves and go straight for the Pizookie. Its a giant chocolate chip cookie! Cant go wrong."
Tien N.,"Las Vegas, NV",25,307,26,4.0,12/16/2010,"Went here after an Elite event via the recommendation of Ken M.  Wow Beers and Booze took up most of the menu. Great happy hour prices, half of on mini sized pizzas both in the deep dish and flat bread types. Quite impressed with their buffalo pizza, had large chunks of chicken, enough heat to be satisfying but not too much to leave your mouth blazing.  The Mediterranean pizza was equally as satisfying.  Wide selection of beers. Lots of beers. Beers everywhere. Enough of a selection to shame myself as i have almost no knowledge of these other brews and stick to main stream replicas. For shame i know..."
Alyssa H.,"Las Vegas, NV",154,40,25,2.0,6/17/2014,"Food is okay, staff is nice, the ambiance is nice, wait time for the food is NOT acceptable. My boyfriend and I were running errands in the area and have passed by this restaurant multiple times and always talked about wanting to try it out. We figured it was happy hour, so why not. We decided to sit in the bar area and to my surprise there were children running in between the tables and chairs! First off, I don't see how some parents let their children run around like crazy in a restaurant. Second off, are they even allowed in the bar area? Anyway, we put our food and drink orders in. We ordered the crispy calamari, avocado egg rolls, chicken lettuce wraps, and boneless wings. We watched the soccer game while we waited (Russia vs Korea). They have a nice huge tv screen right above the bar, so seems like a good place to watch sports. We were both really hungry and ended up waiting OVER 30 minutes for anything to come to our table. Really? Over half an hour for food that are considered appetizers? Thank goodness we didn't order any entrees because who knows how long that would've taken. Of the four dishes we ordered, the avocado egg rolls were the only thing that really stuck to me. Everything else was okay. We moved onto dessert, my favorite part of any meal. We decided to go with the peach and candied pecan cobbler, which was very delicious, but ended up waiting another 20 minutes. Overall, it was just okay. Will I come back? Probably only for the avocado egg rolls and cobbler."
Ursula U.,"Las Vegas, NV",118,257,3298,2.0,1/2/2011,"Now I normally like this place but my last visit here was in a word - Yuck!! We went around 8:30pm- we noramlly eat lunch here so I don't know if at dinnertime the cooks are just too tired or what? Anyways, Our appetizer was Fried Calamari and it was not good at all and oh so cold. This should have been hot but we were so hungry that we dug in and we shouldn't have our tummies paid the price later...That was another thing there wasn't many people in here(Thursday night)  but the service was so slow.  Fish Tacos- Horrible, the BF took one bite and it was cold inside the fried fish- the guacamole was sour- so this dish was sent back and Tomato Soup was ordered.... Chili in Bread Bowl- Chili had a bitter taste to it, almost like Raid. Now I have gotten this before and enjoyed it so I know how this dish should taste here when it's good. Clam Chowder in Bread Bowl- My daughter enjoyed this dish and actually the rest of us ate this too as we were waiting for our meal replacements.... My Orange Cream Soda was good as usual but I was just so surprised at the outcome of the rest of the food, very disappointed to say the least!! I must say that even though the food sucked and the service was hella slow our waitress when around was very nice and accomodating. I am not going to say that I'm never coming back here but I'll just count this evening as an off visit for whatever reason and hopfully I'll never have to experience that again or anyone else for that matter...."
Crystal S.,"Albuquerque, NM",4,5,,2.0,4/16/2014,The food was okay at best.  Service was not very good.  The only gluten free option was a pizza.
Tarence F.,"Southeast, Las Vegas, NV",91,8,,4.0,12/26/2013,"I love the customer here, it's kind of slow but overall it's great. Terry the handle an issue I had with an take out order that really made my day."
Jennifer D.,"Ocoee, FL",29,23,2,4.0,11/13/2013,We sat at the bar. Service was  good and  food was excellent! The light beer on tap actually had some flavor.
Khatherine G.,"Las Vegas, NV",281,146,597,5.0,10/23/2010,"I am actually very fond of this place. My best friend and I come in to dine as often as we can. BJ's definitely has that very loud and social environment. We were seated very quickly and the first thing I noticed on the menu was definitely that half of it was about alcohol. I was not looking there so I cannot review on that part! Haha. There menu is quite extensive with a wide variety so anyone will find something they are looking for. We started off with mozzarella sticks which very great but I wish they would include more dipping sauce. We decided to split a classic angus burger which turned out fantastic and it was very juicy. We also opted for the thin sliced fries and they were crunchy and fantastic. Our drinks were refilled very quickly since she gave them a little hint by putting her empty glass near the edge of the table. Our server was very nice and kept coming back to check up on us. The dessert! Order the pizookie xD They are AMAZING! One of the times I went with my boyfriend, I ordered the fettuccine alfredo and that came out positively delightful. I could not finish it so I had to ask for a to-go box, haha. He had the miso salmon which tasted amazing but he did wish there was more rice for it.  This place will definitely stay in my favorites."
Lori H.,"Las Vegas, NV",58,26,2,2.0,11/8/2010,"I'm giving BJ's 2 stars because the food is pretty darn good when they get the order right. I've been to this BJ's about 7 times and each time (except once) they have failed to give me what I ordered on the first try. I always come in with a group of people from work and we fax our order in before we get there. The kitchen has our order, in writing, right in front of them and still can't execute it properly. I know a veggie pizza with no cheese is a terribly complicated concept but come on! EVERY TIME! I've gotten it delivered with cheese and I've even gotten it delivered without the cheese but with sausage added! Sausage?! The wait staff is always apologetic but the kitchen here seems to be inept."
Ernesto R.,"Albuquerque, NM",131,193,178,4.0,1/23/2011,"We have been to BJ's twice since this place has been open on Eastern.  I know it's been open for a while.  Every time we want to go to this place we try to just walk in but there is always a wait on the weekends.  not just a little wait, a good 40 minute wait.  so we end up going somewhere else.  This time I thought to call ahead and put our name on the list.  I highly recommend doing this if you are going to go on the weekend.   I ordered the buffalo chicken pizza.  There are different sizes.  I asked the waitress what difference between the mini and small pizza was.  She said the mini was more individual and the small was about a little bigger. She recommended ordering the small because I said I was hungry.  The buffalo chicken pizza was great.  It is a deep dish pizza that includes two of my favorite foods (Buffalo chicken wings & Pizza.)  I also ordered a nutty brewnette pint because this is a brew house.  It was ok, not great.  It is a brown ale similar to new castle.  New castle is a lot tastier.  If you like hand crafted brews and pizza this is a cool place to go."
Blair B.,"Tyler, TX",357,772,10,5.0,9/13/2010,"I wish there was a fabulous locals bar in Henderson with consistent affordable food for me to show some love for, but honestly I have yet to find one as good as BJ's !  Some updated reasons why I love this place: *Happy Hour pricing during all football games *They make a light (135 calorie/pint) beer in house that doesn't suck *Ahi Tuna poke. No it's not as good as Poke express, but this is a bar and it's $5.55 during HH and is served with lots of beautiful green avocado ! Shockingly fresh and tasty for a chain. *They now offer brunch! They open at 10 AM for the early games and have a lengthy brunch menu including breakfast pizza and captain crunch french toast .  *Great football viewing in the bar area. 6 games on at once, perfect visibility, HUGE screen. PT's can't touch this place for football watching. *No gaming, no smoking *Huge menu  Sadly, it's just a corporate chain, but they are consistent, cheap, and great for football watching. Hard to beat that combination !"
Christie B.,"Southeast, Las Vegas, NV",24,72,3,5.0,3/1/2013,"Even with all the other places to chose from, when I want a good draft beer and good food, I go to BJ's.  Tonight I had the belgian Grand Cru draft and the Parmesan crusted chicken.  Their beer prices are some of the best in town, especially if you make it during lunch or happy hour.  The Parmesan crusted chicken came ($13.95)with excitement and accolades from the bartender, so I decided to give it a try.  It was wonderful and comparable quality to many high-end restaurants.  This meal was seriously amazing and I would order it again tomorrow.  The bartenders are great, the beer is great, and the food is great!  We always have friendly service and get our money's worth every time we visit."
Sun M.,"Las Vegas, NV",23,26,15,4.0,12/16/2010,"Lots of Beer selections...hard to pick one... They're pizza was good and happy hour deal was pretty good, too. You can create your own pizza.  The Mediterranean pizza was good. It looks like chicago deep pan pizza but taste much better. Appetizer was good....potsticker and spinich & artichoke dip with chips was yum..."
