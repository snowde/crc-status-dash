Christine N.,"Las Vegas, NV",163,138,3,3.0,10/27/2010,"I really dig this bar. But I am not about expensive. So I usually only come here for happy hour or for special ocassions. I want to re-phrase the expensive comment. It isnt expensive per-se. But I wouldnt pay their regular bar prices. My favorite dish is their grilled chicken pasta. I am not a HUGE pasta fan, but I love this. I also really like their Pazookies (specifically the oreo) The place is a good size, good amount of TVs (for the sports fans), and a good place for birthday parties and such.  I havent had a problem with staff, and they are usually pretty nice. Nothing really that separates them from other bars I have been to (other than the pazookie), but I wouldnt drive out of my way for it"
Rachel C.,"Las Vegas, NV",4,24,5,3.0,1/14/2013,I think this is place is SO SO DARK. well the food is ok. Though it is little pricy compare to the quality. I would go back to try different menu. Maybe i will find something i love. =)
Odie O.,"San Diego, CA",2,1003,63,4.0,5/13/2011,"This BJ's is awesome as its huge and modern like a vegas hotel, bar is all lit up like THE HOTEL and garage roll up doors are cool. Service was fabulous and their food pretty good. Tasty mac and cheese, good ceasar salad, calamari was crisp and their orange juice was freshly squeezed and sweet. Their avacado rolls had too much eggroll wrap though so they were chewy and skin uncooked instead of crispy like they make them at cheesecake factory so we didnt bother to finish them."
Melissa F.,"Henderson, NV",9,8,10,4.0,11/30/2010,"BJ's is a large scale brewhouse and has the usual bar menu.  The one dish that sets it apart and keeps me coming back has got to be, Avocado Spring Rolls!  Delicious, warm, a joy to eat.  I swear to god, the 2nd time I had these was better then the first.   The reason for 4 stars instead of 5??  Well, the first time I went with a friend, we tried one of the microbrews.  It was so flavorless and tasted as if it had been tapped a years before completion.  Anyway, I stick to the beers I know and love, same with the food :-)"
Crystal M.,"Las Vegas, NV",28,25,1,5.0,8/19/2013,"Had an amazing lunch! We had the best waitress, Jennifer gets 5 stars!"
Joann D.,"Las Vegas, NV",362,4,18,5.0,1/8/2014,I am always surprised at how good the food is at this restaurant. They also will give you a baked chocolate chip cookie with ice cream on top for a birthday celebration. You can watch your favorite football games while you enjoy your food. The place is clean and the people are friendly !!!!!
A C.,"La Quinta, CA",181,143,249,2.0,6/4/2013,"Food wasn't amazing, service was very slow and inattentive. Staff is very young, they should do a bit more training to get to reach better professionalism."
rickilane b.,"New Orleans, LA",120,58,24,4.0,7/29/2010,"I hate myself for loving you! Once again a chain has stolen my heart and  kept me coming back. They don't do anything remarkable they just do it remarkably well. The staff is always great and fun, even when it's busy they are on point and always make it look easy. The food is never getting a James Beard award but it's really solid every trip. I am such a chain whore when did this happen?????"
ERIC H.,"Las Vegas, NV",203,8,12,3.0,8/17/2013,I love this restaurant and the food is great.  But the SERVICE is terrible.  You guys are a busy place hire more employees.   It's terrible you get your appetizers before your drinks. After our meal all of our dirty plates are still on the table.  Bad bad bad
Walter S.,"Henderson, NV",5,32,5,3.0,10/4/2010,"BJ's has a nice open layout and a good atmosphere, especially if you like sports. There's many TV's around and a bar area where there's a big variety of beers and drinks.  As I don't drink, smoke or like sports I won't comment on these. I decided to try BJ's for their deep dish pizza which is advertised as Chicago style and has received positive praise so far. The appetizers were quite good and not very heavy. The pizza reminded me of Uno's, though not quite as good: It wasn't real Chicago style in that the crust was relatively thick. It was more Pizza Hut pan pizza than Chicago style.  The sauce was not on top as per Chicago tradition but it tasted great, as tangy as it should be. The other ingredients tasted fresh also. The crust was relatively generic, it was baked pretty good and was crispy on the outside but didn't much taste and was too thick to be true Chicago style. Greasiness factor was slightly above average. A small pizza can easily feed 1 person with a big appetite. So for the pizza,  As Chicago style: 2/5. As ""generic deep dish pan pizza"" Pizza Hut style: 5/5   (much better than Pizza Hut's) Service was just adequate. Servers weren't really attentive, they catered mostly to the people at the bar and only visited my table once after they served our order. When I went to BJ's I wasn't aware of any big game on the TV but the people at the table next to me were shouting and cursing when they got excited (as did 2 other tables plus plenty of people in the bar area) every 3 minutes or so. I'm not a sports fan so I don't care about sports events but it appears this place is more of sports bar than a restaurant. Prepare to be annoyed by noises and shouting. Overall I'd give this 2.5/5 (rounded to 3 because the pizza was good, not Chicago style though)."
Paul H.,"Las Vegas, NV",329,548,656,2.0,11/2/2012,Had a deep dish cheese and chicken pizza that was great. Service was horrible from the seating to the server.
Dee P.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,12,,5.0,1/27/2015,"I find this restaurant to have delicious food and a good ambiance. The service has never disappointed me throughout the many times I have eaten at the establishment. I find that the menu has many options, yet anything I have ever ordered comes out in perfect order and taste. The Parmesan crusted chicken is a family favorite. The portions are good-sized and no one has ever left hungry. The prices are a bit high in some cases, but the overall experience and good food make it worth spending a few extra dollars."
David C.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,1,,5.0,1/23/2015,Paula from Staten Island was our server and took care of us . She was a pleasure to talk to and made the night more enjoyable.
George V.,"Lake Forest, CA",7,3,,5.0,10/9/2014,"So no complaints here my mini pizza came out quickly, my beer is cold, and the bartender is pretty friendly.  I can't ask for much more.  I'm  glad I drove over here cause it's just like being at the one back home.  This is the fourth or fifth one I have gone to away from home and each time I'm glad I searched for one it is really nice that it's consistent.  Elizabeth has taken great care of me so far thanks for making me feel like I'm back home in California."
Kacy T.,"Henderson, NV",91,20,,3.0,6/17/2012,Just had fathers day lunch and everything was great. Kids meals came quick to keep them occupied and the server gave my husband a BJs pint glass as a fathers day gift. Great food and a nice family atmosphere.
Michelle K.,"Henderson, NV",1,5,,1.0,1/14/2015,"Bad!  Bad service, bad food.  Sucked up hair through the straw of my water! Ordered a beer with the Mediterranean chicken pita tacos.  Waiter disappeared and brought the warm draft beer 30 minutes later and still charged me for it!  The yogurt sauce in the pita tacos was curdled and sour!  Had the waiter take it off the bill.  Manager asked if I wanted another order?  ARE YOU KIDDING?!  Shove it in your Pizookie!!"
Sherita S.,"Henderson, NV",42,43,5,4.0,12/1/2010,"WHAT A NAME FOR A RESTERAUNT! anywho BJ'S(lol) has the best selection of soups! the TOMATO BISQUE is awesome, although today @ lunch we ordered brocolli/cheese & clam chowder! My friend Sandy & I filled up on the ROTINI chicken pasta & italian chopped salad!  we couldnt believe the bill was only 22 bucks.  BJ'S is my kind of place, minus the dirty title!"
B M.,"Eastside, Las Vegas, NV",57,161,28,4.0,4/9/2013,Buffalo Chicken Pizza is a must and the poke salad is a great surprise!
Mark B.,"Henderson, NV",6,12,,4.0,10/29/2012,"This is a good spot if you are in to having a lot of options when you order.  I am a fan of the pizza and burgers.  Those that know me, know that isn't much of a stretch.  I am not generally an adventurous eater, but if you are, this is well worth it.  There are enough pizza options to make you think you're eating at a pizza joint, and enough burger options to make you feel like they hate chick fil a.  Either way, its a good call.  If you enjoy an adult beverage, their beer selection is large, and if you cannot decide they will offer shot glass samplers to whet your palate.  The service was efficient and friendly.  On a side note they also make their own root beer which you can view in a large vat in the back of the restaurant.  Just a little fun fact.  Give this place a shot, I don't think you'll be disappointed."
Devin S.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,2,,2.0,12/14/2013,"Had to wait 25 minutes to eat, which isn't a big deal, but my girlfriend and I were forgot about and skipped multiple times. Also the hostess had an attitude about it... We were sat with no silver wear. How am I supposed to eat my food, man? Good pizza, but a D- for the customer service. I'm sure there's a BJs somewhere else in town that can do you better."
