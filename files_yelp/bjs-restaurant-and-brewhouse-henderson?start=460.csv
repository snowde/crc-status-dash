Alfonso P.,"South San Francisco, CA",35,50,40,5.0,3/31/2013,Have went to the one in San Bruno a lot an now over here in Las Vegas during my spring. Better than what I had Saturday with a badly cooked steak. But anyways the dish that I love the most is the Tuscan chicken loume (sorry for any typos) it's is a citrus lemony light delight. I love the balance of flavor although I'd recommend that you don't feed it to some kids as there taste buds are still developing which might make them not like but yet it's a good why for them to try something new. I'd give these Resturant's a 5 star rating because of their great attention to detail and nice customer service. Definitely coming back as usual.
Cousin B.,"Henderson, NV",1,10,,2.0,6/24/2013,"Seemed like a fun place, cool decor and great beer selection, but a few minutes into the enormous menu and the chain restaurant feel took over. The deep dish pizza tasted a bit like Pizza Hut which was disappointing, and they ""ran out"" of tomatoes for my wife's pizza, (no tomatoes at a pizza place, huh?) Consider it a classy Applebee's and check your expectations at the door.  There are better Pizza options in Henderson and drinking around a bunch of kids isn't cool.  Doubtful I'll return."
Mike U.,"Akron, OH",8,15,,3.0,6/24/2013,If Cheesecake Factory and TGIFridays mated and had a baby...this place is it.  But some eclectic menu choices (watermelon and arugula salad) some great looking deep dish pizzas and a huge liquor selection make this a viable option for families w a wide variety of tastes.
Adam A.,"Las Vegas, NV",39,8,1,5.0,8/15/2013,"Excellent atmosphere. Restaurant is tidy and welcoming. Server was knowledgeable and helped with every selection along the way. The Mediterranean Pizza was exquisite and had ingredients that are lacking in most other imitators. Many craft beers and the Brewhouse Blond fit my palate perfectly, as I tend to favor the lighter varieties. No complaints whatsoever, and I look forward to visiting this location again."
Bob L.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,41,2,1.0,8/5/2012,"Handicapped unfriendly .  The non-bar eating areas are all down several steps from the entrance level. This typically wouldn't be a problem except at BJ's.  The ADA required ramp is at the BACK of the building and the only way to get there is through the long, crowded and furniture-filled bar.  Impossible to navigate with a wheelchair or walker most of the time. If you can't handle stairs, stay away from this place."
John H.,"Las Vegas, NV",6,80,7,1.0,8/17/2014,I went there today for brunch.  There was a crowd of people in the lobby and all the tables were still empty. I ordered pancakes short stack it came out with three  little pancakes that look more like they were a side order then an actual order. It literally came with a half a teaspoon of butter and about 2 tablespoons of syrup. My first bite of the pancakes the bottom one was burn so I figured I would eat the top 2 and just not complain. My next bike I got a mouth full of onion flavored pancakes obviously no one cleaned the grill it was disgusting. The manager came over and offered to remake them. I said no thank you as my friends were done eating and wanted to leave. She removed it from the bill but still charged me for my iced tea.. This is a very nice looking restaurant with awful food I will never ever eat at BJs again it's disgusting I wouldn't spend my money here. I  have had their pizza in the past... Go to Pizza Hut it's better and much cheaper
Carla C.,"Washington, DC",123,53,46,3.0,9/2/2012,"I like coming here for free pizookies on peoples' birthdays.  Other than that...this place isn't extra special or anything.  It's just kind of one of those places you go to because you can.  I like their broccoli cheddar soup too though.  Its consistency isn't too thick and not too watery.  This place is actually really nice during lunch time hours because their lunch menu is reasonably priced and there are a ton of selections.  When I was in high school, we used to go here before games and stuff and it was a good go-to because of all the selections.  The atmosphere is comfortable and the staff at both west side and henderson locations are always really helpful.  Food-wise, it's kind of like better than Denny's?? I like it, but it's not like OMGARSH WE HAS TO GO HERE. Sometimes I crave it, or it's just a place my friends and I can hang."
Jessica H.,"Las Vegas, NV",103,89,35,4.0,12/11/2012,Love this place and the location always great food and I have never had a complaint!
jo j.,"Carlsbad, CA",11,76,,3.0,4/11/2010,"Went for dinner on a Sunday night.  Friend had gift certificate, or I probably would not really go out of my way to visit a fun 90's style ""brewpub/eatery"". We were seated promptly and the interior was cavernous, nice, and not overly loud, despite being nearly full. Appetizers:  Our party ordered chicken wings for an appetizer.  Sauces were excellent and wings had good flavor.  The wings themselves were somehow undercooked.  The meat was done, but the skin wasn't crispy and the insides had too much fat. Meals: 1 BJ's burger ordered rare & delivered... rare - good job.  Flavor was good but the burger could have used some additional toppings (or at least ask me ""do you need anything to adorn that plain-looking burger?"")  2 fish tacos - these were pretty good per the diners.  1 club sandwich - also good.   Drinks: Great selection of drinks and our party sampled the porter, a crisp apple cider, and the BJ's-brewed root beer, among other beverages. Dessert: Pozzati.  Chocolate ice cream on a brownie-cookie served in a little pan warm.  Very good.  Not what we ordered, but tasty. Service: got a trainee+trainer combo who did make some mistakes that were not caught by the trainer.  Drinks sat empty for long stretches of time while these two talked earnestly about 20 feet away, never glancing at their tables.  Also, wrong dessert was brought by rookie - o well, it was good! I don't love the genre, so reviewer bias is admittedly costing this place part of a star just because it's another brewpub with an unfortunate name.  A full star is deducted because service should be twice as good with 2 servers.  Instead, it was only about half as good as it should have been. Overall, not bad."
Derek F.,"Las Vegas, NV",10,11,,4.0,9/2/2014,"So lunch time rolls around, and I get told, ""Hey, we are going to BJ's."" So at first I thought they were talking about a buddy of mine named BJ lol. Turned out it was this place :) All in all this place was pretty dang good. I got the fish and chips. Nothing super special but they were just how fish and chips should be. Had a go at the Octoberfest brew and I liked it; nice full flavored beer. So I would have to say, I am a fan."
Valerie P.,"San Antonio, TX",1,57,2,3.0,10/1/2014,"I love their food and I've gone to quite a few BJ's around Las Vegas and this was my first time here and wow our service was so slow, i mean the waiter just brings the food so the kitchen was probably behind but we waited over 30 min for our food, although our server Maggie was amazing, she was friendly and was nice to update on the food status. Overall not bad."
Lauren H.,"Henderson, NV",0,18,1,5.0,9/17/2013,"This a local favorite for good food and drinks, a great atmosphere and the service is awesome. Norris and Emily are our favorite bartenders because they are always so welcoming and nice with huge smiles on their faces. It's always nice to stop in after a hard days work and enjoy good company over great drinks :)"
Ken Y.,"Las Vegas, NV",13,78,25,3.0,1/13/2013,"New stuffed mushroom appetizer! The food is always fantastic, but their is always a wait and the servers are stretched to the max. If you want something like say a drink refill, you will have to wait for your server to come back around which always seems to take longer than it should.  We will be back because the food is soo good, we have lowered our expectations for the service."
Natasha G.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,3,1,3.0,11/8/2014,"Okay, so my rating may say A-OK but that is only because I'm giving it an average rating of all of my combined experiences.  Honestly, I haven't been to this BJ's location since my birthday 2 1/2 years ago, which was an absolutely horrific experience.  This evening I decided to give it another go, since it's so close to home, well thankfully, this experience was like night and day, in comparison to 2 years ago.  Vicki was my server; she was friendly, my order was correct, and has ensured I will return to this location sooner rather than later (but only if I get to sit in her service section.)"
Rick B.,"Las Vegas, NV",10,5,,5.0,2/18/2013,"Having moved here from So. Cal about 3 years ago, I needed a new local hang and this is it. Good food. Good service. Fun regulars. Great bartenders! Special shout out to Ben, Tyler, and Kevin. These guys are fun to hang with and take care of business. Norris, Kayla and Aubrey are all great too, just not so sports minded which with that awesome TV is well....... Okay. Just not as entertaining. I give it five stars because its my new comfortable home away from home."
Chris M.,"Henderson, NV",0,4,,1.0,11/6/2014,"My husband and I stopped at BJ's on Eastern for what we thought would be a nice dinner. I have eaten at the one in Summerlin and really liked it. I was so disappointed at the customer service. We were seated after about 10 minutes. Then 20 minutes passed and we were never even acknowledged by anyone! 3 sets of customers sat in our aisle after us and all had their drinks and orders in. I have no idea how they could ignore a table.The wait staff was congregated at the restroom entrance, no sense of customer service. I spoke with the Manager and all he did was apologize. We walked out. THE WORST service ever!!!"
Megan A.,"Las Vegas, NV",58,75,,4.0,8/1/2010,"I love their ""adult"" homemade rootbeer is very tasty and delicious! It is pretty strong since they put jameson in it too.  The thai shrimp lettuce wraps are full of flavor and spicy! The buffalo chicken deep dish pizza is so good! It is topped with buffalo chicken peices, celery, and ranch dressing. mmmM!! The grilled chicken stuffed potato was HUGE! It was topped with chicken and alfredo sauce.  Don't get me started on their pizookies! The white chocolate macadamia topped with vanilla ice cream is my favorite! Service is usually hit or miss here. The last time I went, our server SUCKED. It took her forever to take our orders. My friend accidentally dropped a piece of food in his water and when he asked her for a new water, she just filled it up. It took us about 5 more mins to wave her down to tell her that he wanted a new water due to him dropping food in it. Then she just brings us our check without even asking if we wanted dessert. And of course we wanted dessert!  The food is great, but the service is just okay."
Herb N.,"Las Vegas, NV",3,35,,3.0,3/30/2012,Nothing here to get real excided about. The prices are ok. The food also is ok
Marvin T.,"Henderson, NV",41,4,,4.0,4/8/2013,"This place is awesome! I love it. They have their own brew house and the selections are great. I enjoy myself everytime at this place, the service is quality and the food is tasty. No matter what i order i always make sure I have those shrimp lettuce wraps as an appetizer. Also on Tuesdays their wines by the glass are half off. For improvements I would say to make sure that there are no water marks on the silverware and plates, minor details matter. But overall, I love this place. It is my favorite in the area."
Henry H.,"Las Vegas, NV",11,16,,2.0,11/20/2010,"Well, if you like mediocre food and lackluster service, then you'll love BJ's! The food is on par with what you would expect from a chain restaurant. Decent but nothing really exciting.  Service was pretty slow. Our friend ordered a piña colada. After she tried it, my wife and I both tried a sip. It tasted of a little alcohol and blended ice. She returned it for a pepsi.  Then my wife had ordered an appetizer salad. Our entrees were delivered, and no salad. The server realized she forgot the salad and told us she would bring it out and have the manager take it off our bill.  Then the server offered a refill on our friend's pepsi, and brought a diet pepsi.  Now I know why it's been almost a year since I've been to a BJ's, and why I'll most likely never go back."
