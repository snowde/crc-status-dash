Patricia P.,"Henderson, NV",0,4,,3.0,10/26/2014,The food is good and there are plenty of choices. The staff are attentive and knowledgeable about the menu items.  I will definitely return again and again.
Willie B.,"Westminster, CO",118,345,395,3.0,8/17/2010,"So I'm in Vegas trying to figure out where to eat with my brothers. So my brother Tim suggest BJ'S. I said sure we've never been there before let's try it out.  We drove to the place and low and behold we have one in Westminster but I've never been.    There menu is huge with a very wide variety.  My family tried the clam chowder bread bowl and the bowl was the best one I've ever eaten. Next we tried the baked Mac n cheese. Again so good, super cheesy packed with bacon bits. For our entree we had deep dish pizza which my wife like but I did not care for. Pretty much enjoyed the whole experience and the food. Had a good time hanging out with family.  If you get a chance check out Bj's I think you'll enjoy it very much.   much. It's not the best but its not the worst. i cant wait to try the one in westminster,co after my trip."
R P.,"Spokane, WA",85,81,56,4.0,10/28/2012,Awesome pizza! Samplers of beer are fun to try and their specialty/seasonal stuff is very good
William M.,"Henderson, NV",37,24,1,3.0,1/9/2013,Food has gone down a bit the last few months. If it weren't for the bartender that we typically go see we probably wouldn't bother as often as we do but I know that a place this well known shouldn't run out of main items on the menu that often. Seems like every time I go they are out of something that I want.
Jean B.,"Knoxville, TN",6,5,2,4.0,4/29/2013,Sit at the bar....bartenders are great! Mahi tacos perfect.
Jesse C.,"Henderson, NV",50,162,5,4.0,11/13/2012,"This was the 2nd time I have been here.  This time I tried some new Garlic Chicken, Bacon Ranch pizza.  The pizza was fabulous.  You can get it deep dish or hand tossed.  Everything about the pizza was good, no complaints on the food whatsoever.  I did think the server was a bit slow.  We had an older lady and she took a long time to come around to get our orders.  Also, the prices can be a bit high for some but it's for good quality foods.  This place also has some of the best desserts too, but again you have to pay a pretty penny for any of the desserts.  I wish I could do 1/2 stars because I would probably go 3.5 on this one just because the prices and service weren't good enough, but the food is great and that's reason enough for me to stick with 4 stars here."
Anthony G.,"Las Vegas, NV",7,13,2,4.0,6/7/2012,"Get the potato skins, or the giant baked potatoes cause they are bomb. Also they really good pizza, and this thing called pazookie for desert. Staff is always friendly.  I got the jambalaya and it was very tasty and spicy too."
Sonny A.,"Henderson, NV",130,22,1,4.0,9/7/2013,Good food and great atmosphere. Love all the tv's especially on weekends to watch sports. Recommend the deep dish pizza.....fantastic.
Mike J.,"San Francisco, CA",144,112,6,1.0,9/18/2010,"Sometimes it's amazing how bad service can be at places.  I'm not sure if it's management/staffing or if it's the bartenders / size of the bar at this place but the service is ridiculously bad/slow. For example, dropped in to catch the SF/LAD game on the nice TV's they have in the bar area.  Took 10+ minutes to put an order in for a beer, asked if they could put the game on and by the time we'd finished our beer they still didn't make an effort to put the game on.  Never mind, we'll watch somewhere else donks. The kicker is it was a Tuesday and the place was like half full.  LOL. All in all it's a chain that operates like a chain.  Go to PT's where the service is better...I will!!!"
Erin M.,"Henderson, NV",0,4,,1.0,6/10/2013,"I wish Yelp had negative reviews. Last week, I was in a party of 8 including my husband and 2 year old. BJ's was running busy and we had to wait a good while for our table-about 30-40 min but it is what it is, I didn't mind that. We finally got to our table and waited about 20 minutes before a waiter showed up.  We placed drink orders and about 20 minutes later, someone comes and delivers drinks to 7 of the 8 people.  We finally track down someone to tell them we are missing a drink.  OK fine whatever.  So we place our food orders.We get the food for everyone but the pregnant lady (me) and the 2 year old. Just as with the drinks, NO ONE stops and even checks to see if we all have our food, it's literally dump and run with the waiters.  So I'm thinking surely it will come soon, and wait, and wait, along with a toddler who is getting ticked because he has no food.  Because I haven't seen our waiter in forever, I get up and go track him down where of course, he's clueless.  I tell him to cancel my order and I take my son and leave because at this point, everyone else has pretty much finished their food.  I understand busy, but at least check and make sure everyone at the table has their order!   I told a manager on the way out what had happened and he told me that how we were treated was unacceptable.  Well, duh.  So I took my hungry, grumpy 2 year old and left.  I have been here before and the service has always been so-so, but they just took a nosedive off a cliff for me here."
Devin E.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,1,,5.0,2/19/2013,We came here after work for beer and pizza and the staff was very friendly. We ordered a bacon ranch chicken pizza with no onion... When our pizza came it did in fact have onion but it wasn't a big deal to pick it off. Our waitress offered to get us a new pizza without onion right away but we declined. Before our check came the manager came to us with a fresh pizza in a to go box without onion free of charge just to be sure we left completely satisfied. We were all very impressed with the excellent service!
Tiffini D.,"Smyrna, TN",17,78,5,5.0,1/3/2012,"Everyone is always so nice here and even better....THEY HAVE GLUTEN FREE PIZZA!  It's so delicious, I may or may not have eaten it twice in one week.  No judging.  They have a great drink menu and Tuesdays wine is 1/2 off at the bar.  I ordered food to go recently and the host on the phone was SO nice and had great manners.  I think his name was Dylan.  If I had a company, I would steal him away!  Bartenders, hostesses and waiters are always friendly and helpful.  Love this neighborhood spot!!!"
Carmen M.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,8,1,2.0,11/18/2010,"Been here a couple times and only a couple times for a reason. Last time I was here I had the parmesan crusted chicken. The crust was too hard and the chicken was dry and hard to cut through. The mashed potatoes had that cardboard box taste and they were cheap with the broccoli. The other times I've been here the food wasn't impressive either. Baked mac and cheese was bland as was the salad.  Getting the order right is also another challenge for this place. My brother had ordered salmon teriyaki, and they came out with shrimp teriyaki instead. Service was lacking. The waiter I had barely ever came to our table. When my mother came to meet up for dinner once i had finished taking a bite of my dry chicken, she asked me what specialties they had.. i believe i told her ""nothing."" So for someone like me who isn't really a picky eater, this says something about the place. I will take my money and enjoy it somewhere else."
Frank V.,"Las Vegas, NV",6,21,,1.0,3/4/2012,"When a local bar charges you $9.75 for a Framboise Lambic on tap (12oz), I don't even want to give it 1 star. They have great food, but this is a travesty. This is not the Strip. I am a local! Beers on tap should never cost more than $5 in my opinion. Guess Ellis Island will see me more often now as they care more about their locals with $1.75 beers. The owners of BJ's sure don't care!"
Rena L.,"Henderson, NV",408,24,,4.0,10/14/2012,Love going there fir lunch. Fast service and good food! Love their appetizers .
Savannah Q.,"Las Vegas, NV",19,27,,3.0,5/4/2010,"...I remember going to BJ's a few years back (Summerlin location) and that I ordered a baked potato, not sure which one, but I remember enjoying it... This time around I went because I was craving fish and chips, we saw BJs and decided to give them a try. Service: We were seated in a timely matter, but after reading over the menu a few times and finally deciding, we still hadn't seen a person to take our drink orders.  Finally a young lady takes our drink and food orders and tell us she will find our server for us. What?? She wasn't our server?? Where the heck is our chick at?  Anyways, after a little bit more time our server comes out and asks, shyly, if we would like malt vinegar with our fish and chips....I say yes, and she goes.  With the way she spoke, I figured she was new and decided not to get worked up about it. She was a sweet girl and so was the other lady who helped us. I'm taking a star off for her not being around much after, and watching other people at her tables have to get up and grab silverware off of other tables and what not... Food: I ordered a strawberry lemonade...and I think something went wrong...it didn't taste like anything...usually strawberry lemonades....have flavor. I think I may have made a mistake by asking if their lemonades are ""home made.""   (..i hate being picky about lemonade....) Fish and chips: Good. Not great. But I ate them. My fries were cold, but I still ate them... and even if I wanted to complain, my server wasn't around. My friend ordered the pulled pork sandwich and he enjoyed it. I took a tiny bite and it tasted good. Not old enough to drink so I can't review on the beers. Sorry kiddos. I probably wouldn't go here again. It has a huge selection of good food, and could please a lot of people. Its not terrible, but not my cup of tea."
Michele B.,"Westside, Las Vegas, NV",159,43,36,1.0,12/5/2012,"Service slow, messed up the order twice.  One of our party did not get their food til after the rest of us were done.  No apology.... Just excuses."
Bob L.,"Henderson, NV",117,12,1,5.0,1/29/2012,Just signed up for the new BJs rewards card. Try their own beers and the Lunch specials are bar none amazing! Had an amazing server and everything about the place was very good!
Megan M.,"Las Vegas, NV",62,165,24,5.0,10/5/2011,"I love BJ's!  I had been to the Summerlin location a couple times but hadn't been to the newer Eastern location.  An old co-worker suggested we meet for dinner here.  I fell in love!  I had the Tomato and Mozzarella salad with a Chicken and Pesto flat bread pizza.  I raved about it so much that my mom and I went the next day and split the same salad and pizza.  Then I continued to rave about it so my mom, husband and I went the day after that and tried the appetizer sampler....so good!  Then my mom raved to my dad so my parents, husband and I went to dinner there!  We all ordered separated dinner entrees.  Everyone really enjoyed their meal!  We've all been back for lunch and happy hour.  Their tomato bisque is to die for!  I haven't had anything bad here.  The beer is great and the servers are pleasant! I've never had to wait more than 10 minutes to get a table. It's a great ""go-to"" place if you're looking for an easy place to eat with tons of options.  I'm excited to try their brunch! Without a doubt, I will be back!"
Shawna M.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,26,,4.0,6/8/2014,"This place is great. The food and customer service has always been great. I have taken my young daughter there several times and it is always pleasant, even when she makes a huge mess. Come here as often as I can."
