Bridgett M.,"Henderson, NV",7,14,,4.0,6/27/2012,So I went here again with my kids this time on father's day very busy which was fine ....the bad is my order got lost some how so one hour later I  had to find the host  the manager came over and offer the whole meal free
Stan M.,"Denver, CO",18,301,,4.0,3/6/2010,"BJ's is a really good place.  I went there after a round of golf and had a great meal.  The fish tacos are very good, Good beer (had the Porter) and even better mixed drinks.  The BJ's Rootbeer float drink (Rootbeer, Schnapps, Bailys, Jameson's) is absolutely delicious.  I dare you to just have one, just be sure to have a designated driver!"
Bryan C.,"Las Vegas, NV",44,53,22,4.0,4/30/2012,"One of my favorite places to eat. I have been here many times, ordered many things. But the thing you gotta try more than once is the pizza, so good! They have their own microbrews which they make in house, I really enjoy the Blonde ale the most but the seasonal ones are very good as well. Appetizers are good, so many to choose from but I tend to get these artichoke bites that you can just pop right into your mouth. Come for lunch, it ranges from $6-10."
Dodie K.,"Wahiawa, HI",1,2,,1.0,5/21/2014,"I'm writing this as I wait....we arrived at 10:30pm, got seated by the manager who came from the bar area because hostess was busy talking story.  After 20 minutes at our little booth for 6 people, we were about to leave but a server finally comes to take our drink order. When we mentioned to server that we were about to leave, she apologized and gave an excuse of a server got ""cut"", so she will be starting our drink order. Decided to stay. Another server came 10 minutes after our drinks arrived to take our food order. Finally at 11:30pm, we are eating...yay! Food is good. Our table had a couple burgers, rib eye steak, chicken alfredo, and a salmon salad. Looking around our table, there are no complaints about the food. Server had no name tag, so I had to ask for his name. His name is Eric. There is only around table and another table of people right now, so I don't understand why service is so BAD! So long story, short...food is good but service is HORRIBLE! PEOPLE BEWARE!!!!!"
German C.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,1,,1.0,6/30/2014,I came to watch a world cup game at the bar ... I used to have lunch at Bjs like 4 times a week... I see before during football season audio is way louder... During world cup game i ask 3 times and i barely can hear ... Angela is a manager and she never take care of the situation and to be honest that makes me to not come back at Bjs anymore.... Service and food is great... Manager is poor
Laine G.,"Las Vegas, NV",124,87,59,3.0,3/19/2012,"On a bit of a ""healthy"" food kick these days... so I love that they have an ""Under 575 Calories"" menu.  The Hawaiian Mahi-Mahi was surprisingly tasty.  The stir-fry veggie-pineapple fried rice was yummy and filling.  Sooo... I couldn't help but cheat just a little... but how can you go to BJ's and resist the Avocado Egg Rolls?!  I suppose you could if you didn't like avocados.. but if you're a fan and you haven't tried them, definitely give them a go on your next visit! :)"
Marlyn M.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,5,,2.0,5/13/2014,WE went around 7 pm on a mMonday eve.  All was going well when the food took 45 min. to get to table and it was only egg rolls and hamburger.  The server was ok but never the less the food took forever.  I can usually wait about 25 min but this was outrageous.  Sorry BJ's we won't be back!
claire p.,"Las Vegas, NV",19,46,3,4.0,8/22/2011,"Food is decently priced.  Good atmosphere.  I like to come here for lunch on occasion, their soup combo is fabulous.  Right amount of food for a good price, plus their drinks arnt too shabby!"
Alyssa V.,"Sunrise, Las Vegas, NV",9,30,9,1.0,10/7/2014,"Couldn't wait to try this location for the last several months since we moved over here. We won't be back. Walked into the restaurant around 9 PM (they don't close until midnight) to nobody on stand. After a few minutes, a host grabbed 2 menus & just sat us without saying anything. Our waitress seemed nice, took our order & the food came out about 20 min later. I didn't get the side of ranch I ordered, so I had to flag her down & didn't get it until my fries were cold. We also didn't get any silverware/napkins, so we had to flag her down again & then she brought ONE. She then came back about a minute later (after I took about 2 bites of my meal) & asked if we wanted dessert. I told her that we weren't sure since we just got our food. We didn't see her the rest of the time. Another waitress had to fill up my husbands water after he didn't have anything to drink for his whole meal. The different waitress then asked what we wanted for dessert & she seemed annoyed when I asked for a menu because we didn't know what there was. I'm shocked that the service was this horrible. The summerlin restaurant was PACKED (there was maybe 2-3 tables per waitress/waiter at this henderson one) & our service was way better at Summerlin. We were kind & didn't ask for much, so one star is all I can muster up for a $35 pasta & burger with all we dealt with. One star goes to the food that was actually really good. It's a shame that this is only a few minutes away, but we will go the distance so we don't leave angry again. It's not that hard to just be at least kind of nice & actually service basic needs when that's your job. Not sure what everyone's deal is here...they're all snoody or annoyed & it makes a horrible experience."
Joey P.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,48,,3.0,2/10/2012,"Excruciatingly sloooowwwww service.  I've never witnessed such inefficient serving.  Bring drinks, don't take food order; bring order, but don't bring the meals for the kids because you can't carry everything.  How about just get the kids first, then the rest?  Drop off to go boxes after meal and not the check, too.  Lost 10-15 minutes of time waiting for huge gaps in service. Food was fine, but I as a patron should not have to ask ""could you take my order"" or ""could I have my check"" when clearly I was ready for both at those times.   Our server was either new or just not ready for work that day because she was operating in slow motion compared to her coworkers."
Annie D.,"Boulder City, NV",40,3,2,4.0,3/30/2015,had a chance to go and try the pazooki that iver been hearing about and it was crazy good
Sheri Y.,"Las Vegas, NV",191,97,23,3.0,3/9/2011,"pretty ah-ite place for american grub. bj's is never my first choice, but when friends want to go i'm down.  i've had the pizzas, pastas, and pretty much everything pan asian and they are all do-able, but i never finished a meal and looked forward to my next visit.  sorry bj lovers, i more of a cheese fac. fan!"
Tricia M.,"Santa Clara, CA",123,391,322,3.0,4/2/2010,"This is my first time eating at this location, but I've been to many many other locations over the last 15 or so years in California and Washington.  I always liked it, but for some reason over the last few years I don't think the quality of the food has been good. My husband and I went here a few weeks ago for a quick meal because it was so close to our home and we hadn't eaten all day, since I was testing for my PMP exam that day (I passed, yay).  I probably should have dragged him someplace better to celebrate, but I was so exhausted from not sleeping and stressing over this exam to the point where I was sick, that I just wanted to go somewhere and get food and unwind with a few beers. I had the grilled shrimp tacos because I wasn't in the mood for pizza with a side salad, and my husband got a medium pepperoni pizza.  The pizza is the same here as the other locations, has the big chunks of tomato with little sauce (unless you ask for extra like he does).  The shrimp tacos were pretty mediocre, but being that it was a deep dish pizza joint and not a mexican restaurant, I didn't expect them to be wonderful.  But I also didn't expect them to be so ""blah,"" either and I wouldn't order them again. I wouldn't go out of my way to go here, and I think the beer at Ellis Island is much much better.  However, being that it was down the street from where I live, I'll probably go here again."
Mary S.,"Las Vegas, NV",146,23,14,4.0,12/2/2011,It was our first time here last night and I really liked the food and service. We ordered the Calamari for an appetizer and my boys loved it. It wasn't over cooked so the texture was just perfect. We tried the Bj's deluxe burger and it was so big! My husband and I barely ate half of it. My kids also liked their kids meal and received it pretty quick considering it was a full house there. For dessert they tried the mini pizookie with chocolate chunk ice cream. It was so cute and perfect for their appetites. I would say the strawberry lemonade was my favorite :) I would definitely go back and try other stuff there...
Ashley S.,"Spring Creek, NV",63,103,29,2.0,11/29/2011,Great food as usual. SLOW service. The one bar waitress to all the tables is ridiculous. They have other servers for the resuraunt portions just standing around watching as the one bar area server runs around like crazy. Management should step in and get that girl some help and not let her get overwhelmed and customers become irritated at the lack of service. Our waitress still did an ok job for all the tables she had to handle. Poor management though.
Mariana C.,"Las Vegas, NV",128,38,9,5.0,9/28/2011,"This is my and my friends' favorite place to eat! No matter how late, the people are always nice and recommending the best on the menu (as well as the little secrets not on the menu).  This is definitely a place to go with two or more people."
Sophia B.,"Henderson, NV",2,26,,4.0,4/13/2009,"Finally!  A BJ's in Henderson!  This location opened about a month ago, and from the business it was doing this past Friday night, it's going to be around for a long time. The food is as good as I remember from my few visits to the Summerlin location.  The pizzas are fantastic (try the BJ's favorite or the Great White).  The loaded baked potatoes are gigantic and filled to the brim with your choice of toppings (the garden veggie and chili cheese are delicious).  And the salads, especially the field greens and the bbq chopped, are enormous and really tasty. I went with a group of 8 people and our food came out relatively quickly (especially considering how busy it was).  The staff was friendly and accommodating.  I'd recommend a visit! Just a word of advice: if you're planning on visiting this location on a friday night or over the weekend, I'd recommend calling ahead and getting yourself on the wait list (it gets really busy!).  The restaurant only takes reservations for groups larger than 10, but if you call ahead about an hour before you want to eat, the greeter will put your name on the wait list and you'll get a table pretty quickly."
Melinda S.,"Las Vegas, NV",53,6,2,4.0,7/23/2012,"We eat here at least least once a week....great place for kids or meeting the girls for a drink. Large selection on the menu and beer selection is AMAZING! Nice selection for kids as well, lots to chose from. Ask for Rachel if you go, she always give great service!"
John D.,"Henderson, NV",58,12,3,5.0,2/14/2012,"Best of the Best. Never had a bad experience, recommend this restaurant to anyone and everyone! I have a lot of items on there menu and must say i have never had a bad meal. Great Kids menu as well. Always a line out the door, but never have a problem getting a table"
Sara W.,"Minneapolis, MN",11,6,18,4.0,5/1/2011,"I love BJS! The bartenders are awesome and the beer is the best! I highly recommend the Lightswitch.  Their mini pizzas are just the perfect size for happy hour.  If you're at the bar and have a game you'd like to watch, the bartenders are great about getting it on one of the TVs for you."
