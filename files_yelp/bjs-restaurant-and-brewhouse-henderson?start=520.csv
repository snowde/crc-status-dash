Nancy S.,"Westmont, IL",15,34,5,3.0,11/5/2011,Quick friendly seating.  Enjoyed tropical tea.  Waited about 20 min for sandwich and a salad.  Huge tasty BBQ chicken salad and they split it for me to take half with me.  Husband liked club sandwich.  Fries were cold though.  Salad was great.
Courtney M.,"Southeast, Las Vegas, NV",0,1,,5.0,3/9/2014,"The food here is wonderful and the service is even better! We had Maggie as a server, and she was so attentive, fun, and amazing!"
Rafi M.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,39,,4.0,10/29/2013,I like the gluten free pizza here the best. It's delicious and has a variety of toppings available. The service is friendly and the crowds are good. It's a good place to go for a casual dinner.
Kelly G.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,8,2,5.0,2/12/2014,Had an amazing seared ahi salad with a Jeremiah red. I will be asking for my server Justin P. again. I came in by myself and he made my time there awesome. Felt like royalty. Think I found my new favorite beer too.
Zachary S.,"Henderson, NV",6,46,,4.0,5/17/2009,"I've been here twice and I'm sure I will be going back several more times over the coming months.  I've only had a couple of appetizers and a small pizza, and I was fairly pleased.  The avocado egg rolls weren't my cup of tea, but the Bacon Cheeseburger Pizza was terrific.  Not what I usually want when I am in the mood for pizza, but I was impressed by the meaty chunks of ground beef and the sauce that is drizzled over the deep dish pie. But enough about the food. I came here for the beer.  My first time I tried their 7-beer flight.  The Porter and the Tatonka Stout were a little heavy for me, but the red and brown ales were right up my alley.  Some of their brews are STRONG in the alcohol department.  I'll just leave it at that.  What I was most surprised by was the selection of other beers on tap.  Most brewpub-type places only serve their own concoctions, but this place offers options from a wide variety of American microbreweries and foreign brewers.  The selection of tap beers that aren't made on the premises is impressive enough that I would likely want to return to BJ's even if they didn't make their own delicious booze."
J - R e c c a.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,11,,4.0,1/15/2010,"Nice Place.  Hope it sticks around. BJ's is a great place.  Sorta like if The Cheesecake Factory had a child with a Gordon Biersch and that child ended up graduating from a reputable collage.  Its both and yet better than either one. Beer:  Drink some.  the Hefe, the Stout, Pumpkin. Drink them all! Apps: SPINACH & ARTICHOKE DIP. No Joke, may be the best i ever had. Food: Parmesan Crusted Chicken, ask for extra cheesy goodness! P.S. Get a White Chocolate Macadamia Nut POOZOKIE"
Mark A.,"Henderson, NV",7,43,,3.0,3/28/2011,"I want to like this place more...I really do.  Unfortunately, the execution just isn't there. BJ's has an excellent variety of food and beverages.  The food ranges from average to good, with everything leaning on the expensive side.  If I were to review based solely on food and beverage, they would probably get a 3.5- to 4-star rating.   The problem starts and stops with the service.  I understand the place is popular, busy during non-peak times and a downright unbearable wait during prime time, but the fact that they have such a constant stream of patrons makes the lack of execution in the kitchen even more unfathomable.  I am yet to have a meal here with over two entrees ordered where all the entrees came out at the same time.  I have waited as long as fifteen minutes between the first entree and last entree being served.  To me, that's unacceptable.  In addition, the wait staff seems to be rather hit or miss as to their general level of competency.  Nonetheless, I'm sure that I'll continue to wind up here every month or two. Sigh."
Tiffany S.,"Las Vegas, NV",67,127,,3.0,6/9/2010,"I went to BJ's on Friday with my husband to celebrate our anniversary. We wanted a casual dinner and this place was ok for that. It was loud and really busy, but we were seated within 15 minutes. Our serve was nice, but you could tell she was a bit overwhelmed as there was a large party next to us.  To get drink refills, I had to push my empty glass towards the end of the table, etc I got a tropical tea to drink, which was nice as it wasn't sugar sweetened, the only downside is they brewed it very weak.  My husband had a steak and a HUGE baked potato. He said it was pretty good. I had the French dip with fries. It was ok, but I requested the thin fries as you have a choice of thin or seasoned. I think that was a mistake, they were on the plate, under the sandwich and were pretty limp and greasy. I asked for Ranch to eat them with but the ranch was just eh as well. The sandwich itself was pretty good. For dessert I really wanted a pzookie, but didn't want a large one, so my serve requested a mini one, for 3.00 it was quite large actually and pretty good! The woman next to us got nachos and they looked huge and good! So that might be an item to try in the future. All in all, it was alright. The bill was a little over 50 dollars w/ tip and I thought that was a bit high as there was no alcohol in the tab, but hubby ordered a steak, so not totally out of line."
jillian p.,"Las Vegas, NV",123,86,142,2.0,4/1/2010,"This morning we had intended to go to Vintner Grill for brunch, however, their website hadn't been updated showing their reduced hours so we ended up going to BJ's Brew House nearby. Although we prefer to patronize independent restaurants since chains aren't usually too exciting, we find you can get decent food at reasonable prices and the food is always consistent. Obviously everyone else must feel the same because you don't see too many of them closing once they've opened, and well, just look at every street corner in urban areas. I ordered the ""French Toast Combo"" ($7.95) but subbed the adult french toast for the children's Cap'n Crunch coated and fried french toast. I don't know why you'd order sugar-coated and deep fried food for your child but it sounded pretty good so I though I'd give it a whirl. The eggs came out nice and hot and the apple-smoked bacon was of decent quality, but not crispy enough for my taste. The french toast was especially crispy but did not fall into the category of ""lightly fried"" as the description on the menu suggested. At first I thought it was alright but then I pressed down with my fork and saw oil starting to pool. Yuck. I reluctantly cut into the other piece which was astonishingly better. The Cap'n Crunch taste was nowhere to be found but it was much lighter and a fun version of french toast. Ian had the grilled chicken and cheese stuffed baked potato ($8.95). The Alfredo sauce that accompanied it tasted like it was straight out of a bag of Bertolli's frozen pasta (really bad) and the potato was unexciting. It was definitely a GMO potato if I'd ever seen one. What is America coming to..."
Mark E.,"Las Vegas, NV",75,29,3,4.0,6/1/2011,"Great All American Food.  I am a fan of the pizza, the pizookie dessert, and the chicken dishes.  Very tasty"
Michelle S.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,12,39,3.0,5/19/2010,"This restaurant was suggested by several people so I thought we would finally give it a try.  We went to the one located on Eastern and I-215.  We were seated within 5 minutes after arriving.  We ordered Avocado Eggs Rolls and Thai Shrimp Lettuce Wraps.  I really liked the Avocado Eggs Rolls and the others loved the Thai Shrimp Lettuce Wraps.  The Entrée's that were ordered were Parmesan Crusted Chicken, Fish Tacos and an Angus Burger. The Fish Taco plate came with (2) Fish Taco's.  I only ate (1) taco and I couldn't taste the fish.  My husband ate the other Taco and loved it. The Parmesan Crusted Chicken was good but could have been better if there was more of the special sauce over the whole meal instead of on just a portion of it.  The Angus Burger was a little dry and the menu said it came with Thousand Island Sauce, but that sauce was missing from the Burger.  The Pomegranate Margarita's were delicious.  I will try this restaurant one more time to check out the Pizza.  Our toal bill was $71.00."
Jeff K.,"Henderson, NV",118,209,64,2.0,9/9/2010,"Well, the place has been open for nearly 2 years now and we've never tried it so we thought we would give it a go. The parking lot is usually full so it had me thinking they are doing something right. Anyways we get seated and take a look at the menu, we selected our choices and drinks. We were asked, ""WOULD YOU LIKE SOME CHIPS & SALSA?"" well like at most Mexican restaurants that is the way dinner usually starts (yes, I realize this isn't a Mexican restaurant), so we said sure. Jumping ahead to get the message across to you, I get home and take a look at the receipt, well what do you know?! $5.50 charge on the check for Chips & Salsa. What really got me was that wasn't suggested as an appetizer, it was suggested as if was ""Would you like a glass of water?"" They didn't say, ""Would you like to start off with some potato skins or blah blah blah.."" Get my point? Well I called the manager on the phone about this and during one point of my complaint, she actually giggled at me!! She tried to make good and asked who my server was, but I said that I didn't blame the server I blame management for trying to ""up sell"" in a round about way. The ""manager"" then tried to make good and take if off my bill, I just said, ""I don't care about the $5.50, I am concerned about the way it got on to my bill in the first place"". What a unprofessional way to respond to a customer concern! Pros: Food wasn't horrible, but nothing outstanding about it. Cons: My 1/2 pound burger was kind of skimpy and makes me wonder what weighs 1/2 pounds? The entire burger weight? Also my burger patty  was crumbly and was in 3 sections, all holding together for the most part but in sections. The french fries? I really dislike this micro threads of shoestring potatos.  Wife had Fettucini Alfredo with chicken. The chicken breast was sliced thin and was very very tiny, looked like 1/3 of a breast cut up as a garnish. The pasta was good, but the noodles had  what seemed to be heat lamp dryness to it. It was probably sitting and waiting to be presented together with my cooking hamburger. The Alfredo sauce was so thin it looked like it was non existent, but if you mix it up the sauce comes back up to the top and is present again. Overall we won't be coming back and really do not know what all the commotion is all about. My local neighborhood bars like Timbers or PTs can do better."
Andy G.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,13,3,5.0,5/10/2009,"I really enjoyed this place. They offer a wide variety on their menu, but are mainly known for the pizza and brew. I went with a friend, we ordered onion strings to start off with and they were ridiculously tasty. For the main course my friend had the small barbecue pizza, and I ordered the California sandwich (think thats what it was called). Anyways the pizza was kinda deep dish style and cooked perfectly. The sandwich consist of grilled chicken, avocado, chipotle sauce, mayo, and peppers on garlic bread, and it was fantastic.  We were stuffed, big portions, and top notch customer service, I couldn't walk by one employee without them greeting me. I will come back here again and again. Oh and are bill with generous tip came to $40"
Louis L.,"Tuckerton, NJ",4,145,,4.0,3/12/2013,"We were visiting Las vegas from out of town and try to venture off strip. This was so enjoyable to us, we went twice in 6 days. We found the service very good on 1st trip, and adequate on 2nd trip,but the 2nd trip was very busy for them so I assume service level is dictated by how much the staff has to handle. Wife loved the free refills of house made sodas and I ejoyed the house porter & stout. Food quality above avg for a chain and we truly enjoyed the calif chicken sandwhiches and side salad upgrade was a nice feature. Surprisingly alot around us ordered Pizza- in a town full of pizza. I should think stick to bar style foods here. I would return if I`m in the area or find a BJs elsewhere would gladly stop"
Martin T.,"Las Vegas, NV",161,138,3,3.0,11/29/2010,"Good Bar food  good crowd, the home brews are good, service is good."
Daniel A.,"Dyer, NV",38,16,,4.0,5/15/2011,Always tasty food at BJ's. Can be at bit slow but overall a great place for a meal.
Emily B.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,5,,2.0,7/11/2011,"Ok...so I waited for 4 visits to this place before finally giving it this bad review...what can I say, I WANTED so badly to give this place a chance, but they've failed with each and every visit. Why did I keep going back? Reading their menu, I get enticed (although I usually end up let down) AND it is literally located about a block away from my home...so convenience. ANYWAY...its the service mainly that gave is making me give this place 2 stars...horriblly horribly SLOW, and just plain terrible. EVERY time I've been here...so I give up on this place.  Also, with tthis most recent visit...the first time I can say the food was just plain BAD. I ordered a  ""honey cripy chicken salad"" or something...okay, there was NOTHING honey about the chicken (breading or what not)...it was just some plain old chicken tenders...and the salad was really watery, so when they mixed in the dressing for the chopped salad...it had no flavor whatsoever....of course when I asked for a side of dressing after experiencing that I had to WAIT (see above)....ugh, I just plain give up on this place!!!"
Neetu C.,"The Strip, Las Vegas, NV",3,10,,4.0,2/9/2013,"busy friday night, was seated in 15 minutes at a nice table. great service. food was delicious. ate family style with shrimp scampi (excellent) and bj favorite deep dish pizza. prices are reasonable, food is great, we love this place!"
Kathi J.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,59,2,2.0,1/29/2013,"We have eaten here before and enjoyed everything, but we never had such horrible service as we experienced tonight for dinner. I had mentioned to the hostess and the manager that we were celebrating my Dad's 83rd birthday and that we would be ordering desert for him, (hoping they would at least put a candle on it). My father ordered coffee with cream and sugar, the waitress (Patricia) bought the coffee and cream but said she would be back with the sugar?? She bought him extra coffee in a little stainless steel teapot which did not keep the coffee hot. When he was ready for more coffee she bought him a cup but forgot the cream and said she would be back with the cream?? He sat for at least 5 minutes waiting for cream before someone else finally bought it. We wanted to order desert before we were done eating but she never came back. So when she finally took our dinner plates away we ordered desert and waited. She gave us our check before the desert even arrived and when another server brought the desert out--no candle--no have a happy birthday--nothing. The food was very good, especially the Barbecue chicken salad, but the service was not acceptable. And bring a flashlight to see the menu, some of the tables are so dark you can't read the menu. We watched other tables struggle to find some light to read the menu also."
Aaron T.,"Las Vegas, NV",14,21,,4.0,3/30/2011,"Been here a couple times, food has always been good, service has always been decent or better and they have some good beers. I'd definitely never complain about going back."
