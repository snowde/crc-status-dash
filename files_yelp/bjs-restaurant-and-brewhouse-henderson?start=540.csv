Aaron M.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,15,,5.0,3/19/2010,Happy Hour: M-F 3pm -7pm Sun-Thurs 10pm - Close $1 off all Draft Beer and Cocktails 1/2 off Mini Pizzas $2 off all appetizers It's BJ's.. it's a chain.. anyone from California knows what they're about.  The Happy Hour prices make me happy.  I like the Buffalo Chicken Pizza as well.
T L.,"Las Vegas, NV",4,95,11,1.0,5/16/2010,"If you want horrible service and want to be treated like you are an inconvenience to the wait staff, then bj's is for you. This place just flat out sucks!!! I won't be back. I'll use my federal reserve notes somewhere else."
Taylor S.,"Henderson, NV",148,21,2,3.0,3/7/2012,"Me and my family (party of 6) went there for dinner a few nights ago. There was a 45 minute wait. No big deal. 55 mins pass and our buzzer finally buzzes. The hostesses then tell us to stand by the stairs and wait.  Another 15 minutes of waiting we had to do..and people kept walking by us so we felt VERY in the way. I asked a hostess why we had to stand and wait here and she said ""so youre ready"". uhm okay? I was perfectly ready in my spot on the seat thankyouverymuch. Anyway, we ended up being crammed into a booth. Oh well, at least we all love each other in my family. Then the server was very blah..Not bad but not good. It was busy so im sure he was in the weeds a bit. I had the santa fe salad and about died..YUM! The rest was good but those hostesses need to get it together. I AM a hostess and have been for years so I know how things go and I would NEVER make a party stand in the middle of a walk way for 15 minutes to ""be prepared""."
Mike S.,"Chino Hills, CA",4,51,2,3.0,7/26/2012,"As a whole I like BJ's Brewhouse.  I just didn't much care for my experience at this one.  My daughter and I (She's the LV resident) went in for lunch and took a booth in the bar.  Since I am somewhat a regular at my local BJs I already knew what I wanted.  The California Burger and a Blue Moon.  Our server tries to talk me out of my beer choice because he thought down selling was going to be a wise choice.  When I told him he could not get me to change my mind, he kept trying to do it.  This marks the first time he irritated me.  We place orders and it took almost 15 minutes for the appetizer to come out and this only after my daughter looked at her watch then looked at him (no, they were not busy.) This was our second irritation. The whole time we are waiting for our food, our tool of a server was standing at the end of the bar talking with the bartender.  This guy did not care about appearances and to me it was disrespectful to just be seen hanging out. Now I am getting pissed.  Fast forward now...food comes out, granted they are still not busy, us and maybe one other table in the bar.  My sandwich and fries come out, the fries are barely warm and bottom of my sandwich is soggy.  Probably because our server left it sitting too long while he was yapping with the bartender.  I am giving the restaurant 3 stars because I do still like the place.  Our server, in my opinion deserves negative stars.  I will not name our server, but the management should start watching what goes on in the restaurant."
Elizabeth D.,"Corona, CA",38,107,,5.0,5/25/2010,"My husband and I are big fans of our local BJ's in Corona, so while in Vegas we decided to meet up with his uncle here while his uncle was in vegas on business.  We like BJ's because of their gluten free options.  Although this location didn't have the gluten free crust, they still had the menu and the manager even came out and personally addressed my allergy and indicated he would oversee the preparation to make sure everything went well.  I thought that was above and beyond and the first time a manager had done that for me.  Service was great and food was great as usual!"
John L.,"Dover, DE",0,19,,1.0,3/17/2013,"We ordered a pomegranate margarita and porter beer.  The margarita came in a water glass, was extremely sour and tasted like pink grapefruit juice.  We requested a well done burger that was at most medium and the blackened salmon looked as if it had hit a frying pan with some butter and finished in the salamander.  Definitely not blackened.  The sauce on the plate tasted like water downed ranch dressing.  The clam chowder was over salted which took away from any taste it might have had.  They did comp us for the food and we paid for the drinks but in hindsight, should have also sent back the $10 margarita also.  We did tip the waitress appropriately since it was not her fault the food was lacking but we had to ask for silverware and napkins after the main course arrived."
Kim K.,"New Brunswick, NJ",13,18,,4.0,10/15/2012,"I attended a friend's birthday party two weeks ago and I ordered a calzone...it had onions and cheese.  It is so good.  A waiter and host knows little bit sign language.  It is cool. BJ offers tons of menu.  It is my first and last..I have not tried other food unfortunately.  A really fast service, seriously."
Mj A.,"Las Vegas, NV",58,11,,3.0,3/6/2011,Bjs rule...get ur mind out of the gutter beavis. But they do:) muhaaahhah
Kat G.,"Beverly Hills, CA",4,118,43,3.0,3/4/2012,"Tried the gluten-free pizza. Crust was way better than Sammie's Woodfired, but needed to ask for a side of sauce. They don't carry vegan cheese so without the cheese the gf pizza is just a crust with 1 tablespoon? of sauce spread on it. First time the sauce the server brought was fresh out of the fridge- really? To put on a hot pizza? Then she came back with some warm sauce per our request- in the bowls they probably serve ketchup in but I only had 1 piece of pizza left after waiting for the sauce.  Luckily we had ordered 3 toppings ($1 each) or it would have been extremely sad. They really should have all their signature pizzas available to order & just charge extra for the gluten-free crust. It was still good but I can make this at home buying the gf crust from Whole Foods deli (tastes & looks the same). Not sure we'll be back again. This is not a real gf pizza like Picazzo's in Arizona or Fresh Brothers in LA. So still looking for a good vegan gluten-free pizza in Vegas."
Jae G.,"Las Vegas, NV",430,117,247,4.0,12/13/2009,"Pizza is yum! So far, the service has been great and accommodating for large parties. . Checked out other BJ's in S.F. And So. Cal and it's always crackin!"
Mur T.,"Henderson, NV",31,204,54,3.0,8/16/2009,"Like every other brew house chain. Been to Gorden Bierch, Hops or the Yard House? Then you've been here. Constant food quality, $1 off happy hour drinks 3-7pm Monday to Friday and late night happy hour 10:30 pm to close. Nicely executed chain food."
Ross H.,"Las Vegas, NV",5,12,,4.0,3/25/2010,"What a great place!  Love their burgers and the pazookie is to die for.  Wish the wait was shorter, but I am definitely come back again, again."
Pam T.,"Henderson, NV",19,32,2,1.0,3/26/2014,"So sick of going back to the Henderson, NV location.. Everytime we go service is AWFUL.. Tonight we went at 3:30 thinking service wouldn't be as bad and they seated us in the bar area (hehem with our 18 yr old daughter) and I ordered salmon, my husband ordered, pizza, and my daughter got an appetizer.. I actually walked out because my salmon took until 5:00 for some reason and the waiter was so dumb he said our order was taking longer because of the salmon.. How stupid is he to offend a customer, really?  I wouldn't have cared so much had not ALL of the booths around us filled up and they were all leaving or having dessert when our food finally came and the table in front of us had all steaks!  When he used the salmon excuse I told him it was easier than steak and he ran off like a baby and I wasn't even loud.. So weird.. Not going back to this B.J.'s and always ask myself if these people interviewed for a job being as negligent as they are as waiters.. Oh, to defend this place I could tell his co-workers were thinking, ""Oh God, he sucks.. """
Emily C.,"Las Vegas, NV",57,39,8,5.0,8/17/2011,"Love this place!! I usually order the flat bread pizza with half a salad, and my husband likes the calzone. They have a drink called the lime in the coconut. . its tasty!"
Joie A.,"Anthem, Las Vegas, NV",18,1,,4.0,2/18/2012,"My boyfriend and I decided we wanted to treat ourselves to a nice lunch date together instead of the usual fast food run so we went to BJ's. BJ's isn't a fancy restaurant but it is a little more on the pricier side, but definitely worth it. We usually don't eat so heavily for lunch but we couldn't help ourselves once we saw the menu. We decided on the stuffed mushrooms for our appetizer because we heard a lot of good things about them and they were 100% right. The stuffed mushrooms were so delicious, perfect for an appetizer because the small portions definitely boosted up my appetite because I know for sure that I wanted more. Soon after our appetizer we received our soup of choice, I got the clam chowder and my boyfriend got their chili. The clam chowder was pretty good, nothing too special about it but there was nothing wrong with it either. The chili on the other hand needed an acquired taste I guess because I wasn't very fond of it because of the beer flavor. Since BJ's is a brewery I'm not surprised but it just didn't taste right to me. My boyfriend ate it because he ordered it but he wasn't the biggest fan of their chili either. (on a side note: a different time I went, I had their tomato soup and it was incredibly delicious...since we're on the soup subject.) after we finished our soup we noticed we weren't getting very good service because our server hadn't taken away our appetizer platter and we were done with our soups already, and our glasses were empty. Usually Im not picky and I don't mind but it wasn't busy at the time we went and our table was extremely tiny because it was just the two of us. I felt cluttered and a bit forgotten by our server. We ended up having to ask another server if they could take our plates and refill our drinks because our server was no where to be found. Anyways, when we finally got our main dishes, all was forgotten because the food was literally to die for. I ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken in lemon cream sauce. The portion was huge but I can't complain because I ordered from the dinner section, but I'm not complaining because leftovers was fine with me. I order an extra side of the lemon cream sauce because it was too delicious not to, and the chicken to sauce ratio was not sitting right with me with the extra sauce. Every bite was dreamy and delicious. The dish came with creamy garlic mashed potatoes and steamed green beans. The two sides went magnificently with the lemon cream sauce. If I could have, I most definitely would have finished but my stomach wouldn't allow it. My boyfriend ordered the jambalaya they serve there. I'm not a big fan of jambalaya in the first place so I don't want to comment on it since its already not my cup of tea. We knew about they're famous pizookies but we were way too full from our meal so we got our check, left a little less than decent tip for our ghost server and left. All in all the lunch was incredible. I definitely love this place."
robert m.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,24,,3.0,1/21/2010,"been to this location about 5 times now.  and it is consistently DECENT.  service is always very robotic and lacks personality, and beer refills take forever unless your at the bar/lounge. they have a good selection of beers, but i stick my boddingtons pub ale!! last nite had a small pizza and wedge salad, the others had grilled shrimp tacos and a classic turkey club. all were good, but not stellar. was there at 6:30, and the place was half full and staff standing around everywhere. i give 3 stars because its so consistent, and what else ya gonna get in henderson if your not in the mood for one particualr thing,  they have a big menu so everyone can find something. 3 of us for dinner with a few beers was 60 bucks"
A O.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,3,,4.0,5/31/2012,"I've been to this location several times and each time I've received excellent service from the moment I walk in to the time I exit.  Whether its dine in or carry-out, their staff is friendly, knowledgeable, and fast.  The food is always delicious, served hot  fresh from the oven and they toast the chips when you order chips & salsa!!!  My favorite items are the spinach and artichoke pizza followed by a white choc/macadamia or oreo pizookie.  If you go to the Eastern Ave location, you are better off parking  behind the restaurant, it is not only easier to find parking but also easier to exit."
Darlene L.,"Chicago, IL",0,195,,4.0,8/13/2009,"Very good casual restaurant with a huge menu. Salads were large with fresh ingredients and good dark rolls. The stuffed potatoes are a fine and filling meal as a non meat option. Sandwichesvare generously dressed with meat, and our grilled fish was decent. Pleasant service and inviting drink menu. French fries were cold but quickly replaced."
Mike H.,"Las Vegas, NV",6,1,,4.0,5/31/2009,Great service. Great food not just pizza but that was great too. Beer was good too and they even had drinks even if don't drink beer. Someone was always asking if we needed anything. Worth the wait
Chastine V.,"Brooklyn, NY",147,129,87,4.0,11/29/2010,"went here the saturday evening with a group of 11. (2 kids and 1 baby.) had to wait half an hour for a table but that was expected. we had a really nice server but i forgot his name. he was from hawaii and made conversation with us. was funny and joked around. the place was busy but he kept checking on us. got all of our food and drink orders right. i had a bite of the calamari and it was pretty good. shared the medium deep dish sausage and pepperoni pizza. had a few pieces to take home with the boyfriend. had a slice of BJ's favorite pizza and i loved that. (sadly my boyfriend doesn't dig veggies like i do so i had to sample from his grandparents plate.) so much green peppers and olives. all the colors on it made me love it even more. i say if you don't want to wait for a table go on a week night when i would assume them to be less busy, but their deep dish pizza is really worth trying out with a glass of red wine."
