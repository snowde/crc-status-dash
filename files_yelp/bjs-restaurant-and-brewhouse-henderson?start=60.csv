Abigail T.,"Henderson, NV",194,6,,5.0,9/9/2017,BJ's is one of my favorite restaurants! The staff is always very nice and the food is amazing. I usually get the boneless wings (1 LB. of boneless wings for like $12!) and the two best flavors are the dry rub Sriracha or the garlic Parmesan. You can also ask them to do half of the Sriracha and half of the garlic Parmesan. My other favorite thing to order is the guacamole bacon burger. It's amazing and so tasty!
Adelita A.,"Henderson, NV",0,9,2,5.0,8/21/2017,We eat here at least once a month. Pazookies are hands down my favorite dessert item. It's worth coming to BJ'S just for the Pazookies. Pizza is also great deep dish.
Scott K.,"Henderson, NV",0,7,,2.0,11/13/2017,Excellent food and service and atmosphere. Problem is extremely expensive food prices. Two lunches with just water should not cost $50. Please lower your prices. We will not be back until prices are lowered.
Kali F.,"Henderson, NV",124,23,4,5.0,9/3/2017,"Delicious pazzokies, definitely recommend getting the sampler of 3 of them. Our server Julian was excellent and I will definitely be back!"
Danielle G.,"Henderson, NV",334,630,1691,3.0,11/10/2015,"Not super impressed. I mean, it's a chain and a busy mix of families after soccer practice or a oddball mix of guys watching sports on TV.  After about 15 minutes of waiting, our blinking remote went off and we were seated at a booth. About 5 minutes later our server arrives and takes drink orders, and returns 5 minutes later. We place our orders and about 15 minutes later the food arrives. Ordered; 2 kids sliders with fries, BBQ chicken salad, Dijon mustard chicken salad. Dessert was chocolate chip pizookie and Oreo pizookie. It was all okay, but just okay. Nothing wowed us. Our server was nice. Noise level was really high, but it's a sports bar place, so that's to be expected."
Moses H.,"Las Vegas, NV",205,352,366,3.0,1/27/2017,"I had the black and blue burger with potatoe wedges. The wedges were crisp but void of seasoning. The burger was pretty standard and was kind of bland in regards to the Patty, but the bacon and cheese gave it some taste. Had the Brussel sprouts as an app which saved the meal as they were crisp and charred up perfectly. I had the house made root beer and that was super tasty as well so make sure and order one if your a soda fan. Service was great as was the ambiance of this joint. I will come back if just in the mood for apps and drinks."
Jacqui C.,"Henderson, NV",53,170,116,5.0,3/19/2017,"I've been to this place several times and would come back in the future. On one occasion, I celebrated my birthday here and they give you a cookie pie with a lit candle on top! The pie was delicious at best. Also, their burgers are huge but are very good! Sometimes, I had to take half of it home with me because it was too big for me to finish. The fries are pretty good too."
Sarah P.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,63,73,3.0,3/25/2017,"Very nice atmosphere and usually consistent food service. I ordered the New Orleans jambalaya and some mimosas. The first mimosa tastes more orange juice than champagne​, but the second one was more equal parts, so a bit better. Its a good place to take friends and family because it's upscale casual and food and service is ok,  but I don't go out of my way to have dinner there if I'm by myself."
Lisa N.,"Las Vegas, NV",283,101,1798,3.0,10/15/2015,"Who loves BJ's ?? ok kids get your mind out of the gutter.   Let's talk about the food.   They have a variety of food from burgers, pastas, salads  and pizzas.  I know they are popular for their pizzas, but it's too ""doughy"" for me.  I guess similar to like a deep dish pizza, so when friends want to share a pizza I suggest the flatbread.  I've tried various dishes on their menu, even visited during happy hour, but the only dish that I enjoyed is their ahi tuna salad.       ok ... the REAL reason why I come to BJ's is when you have that craving for a warm cookie topped off with ice cream ... pizookie yuuummmm!! White macadamia used to be my favorite, but now they have salted caramel and I definitely won't choose any other.     Oh and if this place becomes a place you enjoy don't forget to ask for a BJ's card. COME to BJ's ... earn points  (once again mind out of the gutter).  This is cool because they send you offers periodically, and the points accumulate to free entrees or desserts."
Edgar A.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,19,1,2.0,11/21/2016,"And to think I'm a large shareholder of this company.   California and Texas locations are perfect, but this particular one needs to get their 'ish' together.   My waiter was cool, but my Mediterranean deep dish pizza was not cut properly and it was overcooked.   There were advertising on TV screens and on my table of a free pizookie if a mobile app was used,  and my waiter was clueless when I asked.  When it finally arrived, it was a very small size and burned!   Not going here again."
Melissa S.,"Las Vegas, NV",33,74,4,3.0,8/1/2017,Booooo went here today for a lunch meeting and my salad was gross! It was water logged and brown.. besides I asked for NO honey mustard on my salad and ranch instead... well when i started eating my salad they did the mistake of adding honey mustard and instead of making a new salad to correct their mistake they dosed it in ranch which made it even more soggy.. disappointed for sure!
Michelle M.,"Henderson, NV",96,38,,5.0,7/25/2017,"Always great food here. Sat at the bar a random afternoon to have a pizookie. The bartender woman Chris is awesome. Hard worker and great personality! She runs circles around the other girl! ...Love BJ's, it's always a great option when we are indecisive where to go!"
Ajay C.,"Las Vegas, NV",69,54,65,5.0,6/1/2016,"BJs restaurant and brewery puts a twist in your traditional bars and brewery's. They have specials and discounts on certain days of the week so make sure to ask or do your research. For Tuesday's, they have half off on wines and deep dish mini size pizzas.  They also have their own crafted beers that can only be found at the restaurant. They have quite a few to choose from so it is sure to find one to your liking. They also have different entrees such as burgers, pastas, and more. They have an enlightened healthy menu for those who are on the healthy side. I strongly recommend trying some of their seasonal crafted beers. The athmosphere of place is very moderate, not too loud but not too quiet. There are televisions in about every corner for those who are here for sports. They also have an outside seating area which is perfect when the sun starts to set and the weather gets cool. They also have a dessert menu, try the pizzookie, a fresh baked cookie topped off with ice cream, it's delicious. They have a rewards program where you can earn points and use it on future eats.  Enjoy!"
Melissa M.,"Las Vegas, NV",456,229,99,3.0,7/5/2016,"Came here for lunch on a Thursday and it's busy as hell. Not my first choice for lunch given the number of options around here. We came as a large group (20) for lunch. Given the number of us, service was decent, albeit food came slow. Food is mediocre. My tomato soups seemed more like spaghetti sauce. My pizza was okay and I enjoyed it again for dinner. The one thing I've found with BJs to be both its advantage and downfall is its large variety of a menu. Two things I can always count on are the beer and their pizookies. Also, their raspberry lemonade was pretty good too. My only other issue is the YELP check in coupon. The servers don't seem to know the details of this BOGO lunch. I was told I needed to sign up with their rewards program or something to get it. The fine print doesn't say anything of that sort on the coupon. Unfortunately I came into the restaurant ready to split costs with a coworker but they didn't honor it."
Kari G.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,16,7,2.0,6/6/2017,"I've usually had good experiences w/BJ's - but recently each visit has been worse and worse. Last night was the topper making me log on and write this 2 star review.  We ordered curbside to go b/c we wanted just an easy dinner. The curbside process was easy and fast which is the only reason for the extra star. However, the food last night was awful, and had I been dining in 2 of my 3 items ordered would have been sent back.  We started with the potato crisp appetizer (basically potato skins). These aren't hard to mess up, but they were so burnt they were not even edible. Literally, fried to a crisp and I couldn't even eat it. Trash, $10.15 out the door - overpriced to begin with now that I'm thinking of it.  My wife ordered sliders with cheese which we were charged $1.25 or something for cheese, which didn't get put on the burger. Since we paid already, nothing we can do. Stupid - I'm sure they do that on purpose to get more $ on to-go orders. Who's going to check for cheese in the car?  I had some shrimp taco thing which was bland as can be. Literally no flavor...so I mean it was the only non-messed up item in our order but yuck. I had asked for sauce on the side, they put it right on the tacos, so actually 3/3 items messed up. I should be giving a 1-star but the gal who helped w/curbside was very nice.  So many other places to eat - I said to my wife last night: OKAY - we're DONE with BJ's."
Mandisa B.,"North Las Vegas, NV",129,34,54,5.0,10/18/2016,"Great comfort food with a lot of healthy options as well. This establishment takes pride in having the best craft beer, make sure to sit at the bar to get the best service!"
Walter M.,"Henderson, NV",0,9,,3.0,8/9/2017,"Excellent selection of beer. Fresh salmon is winner but, the menu is so extensive that it's average at everything else"
Jessica M.,"Las Vegas, NV",115,1,,1.0,8/8/2017,Bjs management sucks completely! Every location I have been to treat their staff poorly and it shows. I will NEVER be back at a Bjs location. EVER!
Andrew I.,"Southeast, Las Vegas, NV",9,49,18,5.0,12/7/2016,"Comfortable and stress-free bar to sit at for a quick bite and watch sports. Attentive service staff. Love the ambiance, low key and conversational."
Denise W.,"Santa Clara, CA",29,17,,1.0,7/17/2017,"My son and I just arrived in town to visit family...daughter and grandsons. Went to BJs for an early dinner. I did not receive my dinner as ordered, strike one. My daughter tells me that this happens to her meals everytime they go to BJs. My dinner comes back,the sauce was left off and minimal veggies are served, strike 2! Grandsons order a dessert each, the pizookie came before the rootbeer float. The pizookie was completely cooled and consumed and I had to ask about the float before it was served, STRIKE 3 and you are out. So would I go back to this BJs...not too sure about that..."
