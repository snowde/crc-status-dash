Ryan C.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,3,2,1.0,5/12/2017,"Took a group of people there for lunch.  One of the wedge salads came out frozen, not sure how that is even possible if it is fresh and had just been plated.  Ordered the Avacado Egg Rolls as an appetizer and found a ""Grown in California"" sticker in one of them. I guess we know where they get the Avacodos from...  I know there were 11 people so a lot to coordinate, but the meals did not come out together and some were cold so I think there was a bit of mis-timing in preparing them."
John F.,"Anthem, Las Vegas, NV",8,45,7,5.0,7/1/2017,Went in there a couple days ago with my wife and 2 boys. Nick was our server. This guy was OUTSTANDING very attentive and his suggestion were spot on.  We go here about once a month but this is the first review I write for BJs because of Nick being a good guy and great server! Thank you for taking care of us we will be back. BBQ pizza is the best and Kids love the bazooka.
Linda M.,"Henderson, NV",22,477,670,5.0,10/8/2016,"From calling in the order, the packaging of the food to the quality of food our overall experience was excellent. We ordered fried chicken breast with mashed potatoes and corn, chicken tortilla soup and santa fe salad. Everything was delicious. The packaging was done right with tight lids and cold food separated in another bag from the hot food. I can't tell you what a pleasure it was to get our food home without worrying about any spills! The bags of food could have been tipped over and nothing would have spilled. I order a lot of takeout and this restaurant is now on the top of my list."
Mazlina B.,"Las Vegas, NV",67,16,34,5.0,10/29/2016,"My fav place with family & friends, dates with my husband, & happy hour with teacher colleagues. Always fun, clean, pleasant, courteous, & enjoyable."
Coco R.,"Henderson, NV",328,10,2,5.0,3/3/2017,"An amazing restaurant for any occasion!!! So many food options (all great, but I have my favorites!), many drink options, and comfortable atmosphere!  I've been here many times for birthdays, celebrations, meetings, and just for lunch! Prices vary, you can spend a lot or can find something for cheap! ($15-)  Tonight I was there with my best friend for her birthday and our waiter, Brandon, took so much care of us! Birthday pizookie (specialty cookie/brownie desert) & free drink  Brandon, you rock!"
Melony S.,"Lake Forest, CA",107,10,5,4.0,4/28/2017,"This is my go-to place to order curbside pickup on nights when I want good food, but don't want to cook. Good pricing and the convenience of pickup."
Arthur M.,"Henderson, NV",103,451,1748,4.0,8/27/2015,"BJ's is one of our options when the whole family goes out for dinner. They have the seating and are usually staffed to handle larger parties. The restaurant is spacious with plenty of televisions so you can take a peek at your favorite game. Their menu is huge and everyone can find something to eat. But there's only a handful of items that I personally would consistently order though. For me, of course I'm a fan of their craft beer. They have a nice selection that runs the spectrum of flavors with the Jeremiah Red and PM Porter being my favorites. You can order a flight if you're having trouble deciding or want to try multiple beers. Their deep dish pizza with the thick, crunchy, and slightly greasy crust has always been pretty consistent. The Pizookies are a must order. A warm cookie with ice cream is a slam dunk. On our most recent visit, I decided to go with the 14 oz. ribeye ($21.50) with brussel sprouts and asparagus. I wouldn't order this again, nor would I recommend it. It wasn't terrible, but for the price, I can get a better, larger steak from the butcher. The brussel sprouts were mush and I couldn't finish them. We finished with the salted caramel pizookie which was delicious and completely annihilated. I made the mistake this visit by going away from one of my staples, but I wouldn't think twice about coming back for drinks at the bar or bringing the group for a meal."
Tomica B.,"Powder Springs, GA",7,21,,1.0,6/25/2017,"Nope, not a fan of this pizza at all. It was not only expensive, but VERY disappointing. I live out of town, so I'm pretty certain that I will never eat here again."
Brent L.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,15,4,5.0,7/19/2017,"This was our first time at this location but second time at a BJ's Brewhouse. We went for an early supper, around 4pm so it wasn't busy. Our server was very polite and professional. Our food was great and the beer is superb. I ordered the Chicken Alfredo and my garlic knot didn't come with it. Server said they were waiting on them. No big deal. A few minutes later, the manager comes over and apologized for the wait. Then instead of the one that comes with the meal, they give me three. Our second trip to a Brewhouse, our second great experience!!"
Diane M.,"Las Vegas, NV",208,184,1468,3.0,4/9/2015,"First of all the BJ's Mobile App is a good tool to have if you plan on dining here.  You can add yourself to the waitlist, order ahead for dine in or take out, see your rewards points, and actually pay on the app.  Being able to add yourself to the waitlist before you get there comes in handy since there seems to be a perpetual wait at the Eastern location.    This review is for our last two visits because they were so close together.  Both times we were seated within a couple of minutes because we used the app waitlist and on both occasions we had good service and flavorful food and libations.  However the comfort level of their seating varies greatly depending on where you are seated.  The larger booths are roomy, but the smaller 2 person booths don't have enough space, especially if you order a pizza that takes up most of the table.  I wish they would only use these tables if they don't have any other open spaces. Beverages: LightSwitch Lager (4/5) & Top Shelf Margarita (3/5) Appetizer: Crispy Fried Artichokes with lemon garlic aioli (4/5) and House Salad (3/5) Pizza: Vegetarian Signature Deep Dish (mushrooms, green peppers, black olives, onions, seasoned tomatoes) 4/5 Sandwich: Roast Beef Dip (5/5) Burger: Crispy Jalapeno (4/4)"
Liz S.,"Henderson, NV",13,12,1,4.0,7/26/2017,"Thanks for the fast, friendly service - clean and my table was bussed promptly. You're not sitting there having coffee after your meal staring at your lunch dishes on your table. Otherwise, it's your typical BJs."
Alex N.,"Las Vegas, NV",100,119,120,5.0,2/13/2016,"The fact that I'm here all the time makes it a shame that I had it at four stars. This is my favorite place to be. The food and the beer are always great. All the bartenders are awesome. They're personable, engaging, and don't make you wait for a beer.  My tastes have changed in that I pretty much always get the barbacoa chicken, double chicken, now. The seasonal beers always keep the selection fresh. Sweet sin chocolate ale?! This place is amazing to me."
Nicole F.,"Las Vegas, NV",117,341,1446,4.0,10/31/2016,"Ordered the soup an salad for lunch and wow it was good. Haven't been to Bj's in forever, guess I'll be coming back. So surprised how cheap our total was plus the server was amazing !"
Mr Photo Mtb F.,"Las Vegas, NV",6,94,33,4.0,7/12/2017,Today I had the kale salad it was excellent that's probably the best salad that they have and get it with the blackened shrimp good stuff and great service
Alice C.,"Las Vegas, NV",823,189,1604,3.0,2/27/2015,"I came to BJ's for a beer tasting dinner. I like the ambiance here; clean, dimly lit, gorgeous big booths for seating and high ceilings.  I had a blast at the beer tasting and enjoyed trying a variety of IPAs! The experience was awesome... the host walked us through the history and type of each beer we tasted and we also were served a course of several small dishes. They poured generous samples of each beer and filled us back up if we requested. I was a little buzzed by the end, but that was expected, right? I've been here a few times since then for drinks and have tried their pizzas and some appetizers. The food isn't anything to rave about and they are known for their pizzas but I've tried much better. The service is always good, can't complain there. I don't come back too often but I would definitely sign up for their next beer tasting dinner!"
Laura O.,"Las Vegas, NV",109,31,40,3.0,7/31/2016,"Even though the fine print on my coupon says I get a free appetizer if my check is $9.95 or higher my waiter stated that my personal total needed to be that high, not me and my boyfriends together. Which is insane. Obviously we are going to share the appetizer - just like we are going to share the check.  He went in the back to check with the manager and came out less then a minute later with the same answer.  Funny how the management/the waiter contradict the fine print in the coupon that Yelp puts out (that's right, I got the coupon from Yelp!) So whatever, we will have some happy hour and go home. Really the only person that suffers is the waiter. We tip on what the bill would have been BEFORE discounts. Duh."
Josephine L.,"Fowler, CA",0,4,,5.0,6/24/2017,"Try the spinach stuffed mushrooms! They are to die for. Even better, Roy was an amazing bartender. I'll definitely be coming back again soon!"
Susan S.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,13,,2.0,6/19/2017,"The waiter (Carlos) was hovering over my table with a check, pressuring me to leave so he could seat more people. He was very flirty and made me feel a little uncomfortable. You are there to WORK, not use BJ's as a dating service. I will probably not be back. I said something to a female hostess and she acted like it was normal and didnt seem to care. Very disappointed. The food was good, service poor."
Rachel B.,"Las Vegas, NV",503,144,557,1.0,1/7/2015,"We came to BJs this evening for happy hour and we unfortunately had to sit next to an inebriated man.  We asked the bartender Scott at what point they stop serving him and the bartender said ""when he's drunk"" and I said ""you don't think he's drunk?""  We got the manager involved as this guy was touching me and making a scene and i felt it was handled very poorly.  The manager just made him slide down and kept saying ""I have to slide down for the fat and ugly girl.""  This guy was clearly over served and they let him remain at the bar and continued to make a scene. I absolutely will not be back to this location due to the way this situation has been handled. I am expecting a response and would look into your bartenders over serving your guests as that is definitely a liability."
Kat K.,"Las Vegas, NV",4,37,29,1.0,3/5/2017,"Party of 2, seated right away (not packed or busy). Server wasn't very helpful while ordering however our order was placed fairly quickly. Crispy fried shrimp and a ribeye dinner. Waited 20 minutes for a side salad and another 10 for dressing. Waited about 45 minutes for our food. The food was extremely hot from sitting under the heat lamps for so long which made the ""crispy fried shrimp"" taste rubbery. Asked for a refill on drinks when the food arrived (45 minute wait for a refill). Sent the shrimp back, took a box to go for the steak. Ended up paying $40 to watch my husband eat his dinner. Server didn't seem to care about the service or customer satisfaction and experience. Will never visit this location again. Waste of money."
