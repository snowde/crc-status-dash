Latrice R.,"Richmond, VA",17,130,380,4.0,12/11/2017,"The good: This was wwaaaaayyyy better than I expected. Even though it's like a sports bar kinda atmosphere. It has this nice restaurant thing going on for it as well.  We were met by two waitresses that were extremely nice.  Hubby ordered the spaghetti and meatballs. (I know kinda odd to order at a Brewhouse lol.) I ordered the double bone in pork chops with white cheddar mashed potatoes and broccoli and we got a pzooki!  All I can say is WOW. Their food was flavorful, and tasted better than any Brewhouse I've ever went to.  They have TVs everywhere. So don't worry guys you can watch the game anywhere in the restaurant. Oh the pzooki is this cookie that comes out fresh out the oven with ice cream on top. Yum!  The bad:  The menu is overwhelming. It's nice to have choices but it's toooooo many choices. The menu is as thick as a mini book and it's not just the pages that are thick. Lol. You feel like you don't know what to choose and pressured to order. Other than that, it was good.  The ugly: No ugly at this time."
Courtney Y.,"Spotsylvania Courthouse, VA",112,3,,1.0,11/11/2017,"Probably the worse service I have ever received. I went to dinner with 2 friends (one of which has been here before & loves it, the other has never been here like myself) & long story short, we waited for a table for over 20 min (when we were told it was a 10-15 min wait) then we were told that they ""skipped us on accident"" & we had to wait even more. One of my friends ordered a soup with her entree & we all order entrees. My friend received her soup & that was it - none of us received any entrees. We were told the systems in the kitchen went down but our food would be out shortly regardless. THEN we were told that they were waiting to cook my friend's wings & that they would be out ""in 2 min."" After much more than 2 min (and 1 hr & 40 min of being there total) we asked for a manager. The manager brought out the wings as if that would make everything okay. She said that she was told that we had already eaten & were simply waiting for my friends wings! My poor friends & I worked all day & none of us had eaten so we were really looking forward to this meal. The manager brought us all comp cards (as if we'll ever go back) & did not make us pay for anything (what would we have paid for in the first place? No food & one soup?) we were not the only customers that left or asked for a manager either.  I wish I could review the food for you, but all I could tell you about is their ice water - since that's all I had."
Celeena S.,"Glen Allen, Richmond, VA",6,60,211,2.0,6/12/2017,"The times were much better when the place first opened. These last two times I had came for lunch and I was disappointed. I ordered the chicken tenders and fries and the quality was not great .  The fries were soggy/oily and the tenders just..dry and looked sad. The food also took it's time coming out and for such a basic dish(30 mins or so) and non -busy day , I was surprised. The second time for lunch, there were perhaps 12 tables of 2-4 guests and I felt terrible for our waitress. It seemed she was the only one covering all the tables. She was polite and sweet but this puts a strain on her and the timeliness of the service. On the second visit, I opted for the unlimited soup and salad which seems to maintain it's taste and deliciousness. I also really like there daily specials from mom through Thursdays.  Overall, I believe the main factors of what made this a 2 star was the quality of wait staff and the questionable quality of the dishes I've had. In addition to that, waiting for the check took a solid 15 minutes. Our waiter was very busy but was clearing empty tables before handing us the check... At this point, i just wanted to leave and find anyone to just pay my bill.  (What bugged me most was that I believed there was some form of a work meeting occurring in the dining space behind me. Although I do not know the content of this meeting or anything at all about it, I don't believe it was fair for it to occur while the staff struggles. I believe it demonstrates poor acknowledgement/consideration for staff) There was only one other worker the entire time who seemed to be the spirit of the place for that afternoon as she greeted people kindly and offered her presence to customers that helped out my waiter.  Nevertheless, I recommend trying this place out already once for the food but I do hope the help improves."
Kyle P.,"Fort Lee, VA",271,33,241,5.0,3/4/2017,"Let me tell you about David, he served my friends and I tonight. David is a fine wholesome young man. I hope he gets everything he wants in life. I asked dearest David who would win in a three way fight between Thor, Goku, and Superman- he answered Goku correctly. David is a young Joe Biden and has the intellect of Justin Trudeau. He is a true gentleman and a scholar. If my son turns out just half as cool as David, I'll be slightly upset because my son's clearly not setting his goals high enough. BJs is always pretty poppin', they only take reservations of parties of 6 or more so be prepared for a wait after 6pm. Go ahead and wait at the the bar though, BJs Irish Whiskey  The wait is slightly off putting but they always win me back with their food and service. Wyder's Pear Cider. Calamari. Parmesan Crusted Chicken. Cookies and cream pizookie. Remember to ask for David, he'll take care of you. You're welcome. I apologize for the not-top-tier food pictures, I was busy absorbing the deliciousness."
Tina R.,"Glen Allen, VA",0,4,1,1.0,1/5/2018,"Decided to go out to lunch on a snow day. Server came after about 5 minutes. My son ordered the nachos appetizers. The server informed us that the truck did not come and they were out. She was very unclear as to exactly what they had. She brought our drinks, left again for approximately 5 minutes. When she returned and my son asked for the chicken sandwich, she left again to ""check if they had any."" When she finally came back she informed us that they only had ""pizza, ribs, and salad."" I'm not sure how their supplies got so low during a one day snow storm. We then decided to leave. The server was not apologetic, only brought us a bill for our drinks."
Bob H.,"Richmond, VA",0,9,,5.0,11/22/2017,"Go for the beers, and enjoy the food.  We enjoyed the ribs and salmon. They get really busy for dinner. We beat the crowds  and went around 4 in the afternoon. Still great service."
Parris W.,"Norfolk, VA",2,17,7,1.0,12/16/2017,The dessert was amazing but the service and experience will probably have me to NEVER return. We arrived at 7:15 and left at 11:00pm because of food complications and basic miscommunication. Shoutout to the kitchen manager Derrico for being amazing! He really helped us in a time of need.
Muhammad R.,"Glen Allen, VA",68,86,60,2.0,10/2/2016,"Stopped in for late lunch/early dinner after some shopping. We were pretty hungry. Ordered the calamari which was just average - definitely nothing to write home about. It was a bit burnt and over cooked. Would not order again.  I ordered the Jalapeño burger. Medium well, no tomatoes. Presentation was poor. The burger was carelessly put together and was very difficult to eat.  Everything fell out. Also mine had no lettuce on it. Lame. The meat was fresh and the Jalapeños were fried and thrown on top of the patty - it wasn't good. Fresh jalapeños are way better. I'd pass on ordering this one.  The wife had the ham and cheese grilled cheese and swapped the ham for turkey. It looked good and she said it tasted good as well. How hard can a grilled cheese be though, am I right?  Also ordered the cucumber water which I thought was going to be a lot more refreshing but it wasn't. It tasted off - not a fan and wouldn't order again.  Service was prompt and the server was really friendly and checked in often. Overall, the only reason I gave it two stars and not one was because the menu is extensive and I'd like to try some other stuff at some point. But for now I think we'll stay away for a bit."
Kici C.,"Richmond, VA",416,143,166,3.0,8/10/2016,"I don't like chains. I really don't. I try to veer as much as possible...but I've never tried BJs so I made the exception. After leaving Wegmans (OMG) I decided to stop and grab dinner with my family.  The place is huge! It's a sports bar so there's tvs everywhere and the booths are super comfy. Our server was really fun..can't think of his name..Josh? Idk. He was a good server though. We started off with the stuffed mushrooms and guacamole. Followed up with traditional wings, chicken Cobb salad, and a turkey burger. I wanted to try it all. Don't look at me with those judgey eyes.  The stuffed mushrooms were AMAZINNGGGGGG.. They deserve 8 stars lol. I want to say they were stuffed with spinach and cheese...idek I was scarfing it down like chocolate cake dude in Matilda. Super good. My wings were delicious. The salad was delicious....but the burger... I'm giving the major side eye to the burger.  It's advertised as it being topped with cheese, Carmelized onions and dried cranberries ..so why was none of that on it when it came out of the kitchen?  the server sent it back twice and twice they still managed to forget something.  Whoever is in the kitchen, if you're reading this, get it together dude/dudette. Get your head in the game like the kid from High School Musical. It was delicious though."
Yvonne M.,"Richmond, VA",223,625,785,2.0,1/2/2017,"Ive been to this restaurant 4 times and its usually on point but this time time not so much.  I took my friend here for a bday dinner, we were seated instantly which was nice, and our server Tony came right over to greet us pretty quickly. We soon found out how busy he was, he was working a bunch of tables and doing the best he could. We appreciated the effort, he was great and kept us happy under the circumstances. The food... well it was the only reason for the 2 stars.. I decided to try something new... the jambalaya.. and it was horrible! It was over-seasoned and so spicey we couldnt enjoy it at all. I couldnt finish it because it was not just good at all. My friend had to order a side salad to try to calm down the heat in his mouth (didnt help) I was so disappointed because everything else was on point.  The drinks, service... all were good but that dish was a thumbs down. You could see the spice all over the plate, it looked like someone sprinkled it on like grated cheese before bringing it out.  Next time Im there, I will order what I know is good, the salmon or deep dish pizza."
Dana B.,"Henrico, VA",32,166,1636,2.0,12/9/2016,"I wanted to like BJ'S but the food just didn't do anything for me. I had heard that the pizza is awesome,  but what I experienced was very underwhelming.  The deep dish personal pizza has a nice pan crust, but the body  was light and fluffy compared to a more dense deep dish that I am used to. The pulled pork sandwich had heaps of onion ring strings on an oversized buttered roll, but not much pork, and there was no smokey flavor. The thin sliced fries are very good, as was the Snickerdoodle dessert,  but overall we left feeling dissapointed.  They have a few lunch items that look good, but honesty I don't think I would go back. Cost for 2 cocktails,  personal size (6 inch) pepperoni pizze, salad, and the bbq, was almost $60, not worth it at all."
Amber R.,"Richmond, VA",18,52,86,5.0,7/12/2017,"Bjs is great! I love the atmosphere the whole restaurant has, the beer selection is wonderful, they have the best avocado rolls and wings with so many flavors. The pizza is AMAZING, the mini is sort of like a personal pizza so I wouldn't plan on sharing that. And the best part was the pizookie the salted caramel is to die for! Amazing, restaurant. Amazing food. Amazing drinks!!"
Monica O.,"Richmond, VA",4,100,148,4.0,6/20/2017,"So delicious! I love this restaurant and I can't wait to return! The menu is a bit weird because there are some things that can only be ordered during lunch time. That's why the restaurant loses one star because all the meals I wanted to order was from the lunch menu! Thankfully the waiter I had allowed me to order because I would have just left because there was absolutely nothing I wanted from the full menu! However, I enjoyed my chicken tenders and fries! There honey mustard and ranch dipping sauce was absolutely delicious. I had there wings for an appetizer and really enjoyed it!"
Timmy T.,"Virginia Beach, VA",272,559,,3.0,10/3/2016,"I wanted to eat a new place in the Short Pump area and my friend recommended this place. He stated he has been numerous times and has only had good experiences so I wanted to give this place a try.  As the name suggests, it's both a restaurant and a craft brew house. The restaurant itself is fairly large and is split into two different dining areas, one for the bar/smaller tables and the other side for bigger parties/families. The menu here is way too extensive. I understand that having all inclusive menu reaches a wider audience and attracts more business but some times I feel that is counter productive. The long menu made it very difficult for me to choose something I wanted. It also doesn't allow the restaurant to focus on several small specialty dishes and execute them exceedingly well instead of just average. I finally decided on the spaghetti and meatballs and my friend got the steak and fries. The food came out in about 10 minutes. The size of my entrée could definitely feed two people and I actually took half home. The pasta itself was okay but nothing great and the same could be said for the meatballs. I liked my dish but there wasn't anything special about it. The pizza looked really delicious from the pictures on the menu and I would probably get that the next time I come (if I do).  Our server was nice and attentive. Although we may have gotten a less than desirable reaction when we asked her what our total was since we had a 10$ off coupon in you spend $35 or more. She didn't even address what we just said and just kind of took off with a look like oh one of those patrons trying to see if they can get something free by using that coupon. In order to get that coupon, check in on the YELP app!"
Laura R.,"Nashville, TN",0,3,,1.0,10/8/2017,We stopped coming here for a while because the service wasn't great and the food was inconsistent. Tried it again today. We got our meals quickly and the food was average. We explained we were in a hurry and ordered dessert and our check at the same time. 25 minutes later we were still waiting. I got up to go look for our waitress and found her chatting with manager sitting in a booth. She stopped again to chat with another employee even once I explained we were in a rush. There was confusion with our check and we never did get to eat our dessert because we were running so late. This place has so much potential but never lives up to it & the management is not tuned in. Nobody noticed that while we were waiting for a check a party of six came and sat down where ignored and were very unhappy (same waitress).  I think we are done!
Theresa M.,"Richmond, VA",4,8,,1.0,9/18/2017,Went for the first time for dessert. The restaurant was almost empty and the hostess told us it would be a 5-10 minute wait for a table. Once we got a table it took the server 20 mins to get to the table. We ordered water and dessert. The water came 15-20 minutes later with the water. I couldn't understand what was taking so long to get water. While waiting I did see a lot of workers standing around the bar talking. We only ordered dessert and that seemed to take forever. We spend 1.5 hours in the restaurant and only went in for dessert.  That was the first and last time I'll step foot in that place. Seems like the staff could care less about the customers.
Becky N.,"Henrico, VA",50,67,85,1.0,4/25/2017,"Let me first say, I have been to this restaurant since they opened. I have seen it really good and watch it go down hill in the short time BJ's has been open. I also don't like giving poor ratings, but when I'm birthday lunch is ruined...I think it is well deserved! My co-worker and I both ordered our lunches via their website/app. We couldn't pay online, which was weird but we just walked over (literally the restaurant is in the next parking lot behind my office) to pick up our lunch. She actually headed over about 10 minutes before I did and hadn't returned which was very odd. When I walked in, she was still waiting and so was another lady who had come in before me. So apparently, their sites were down and orders weren't coming through to the check out system but according to management the kitchen had them and were making our orders. We quickly realized that was a lie. We heard the manager ask about my coworker's order and they clearly responded with ""I don't have a ticket for that!"" So she waited another 15 minutes for her order. They gave her her meal for free which I thought was acceptable.  As I waited, I had to verify with the server that my order was being made. He told me it was but wanted to make sure it was entered correctly so I told him I ordered the Santa Fe chicken salad with balsamic dressing instead of the ranch it came with. And I waited....and waited...and waited. So my food was finally brought out to me and the same server who was at the register when I walked in, the who who verified my order and reentered it in the computer, had the nerve to ask me to pay for this meal!!! I had order before noon and the food was not ready until after 1230pm.i had been waiting over 20 minutes in the restaurant alone! Are you flipping kidding me!?!?!? I laughed and clearly stated I was not going to pay. The manager heard me and was at the ready to respond but I cut him off. Oh...side note if you missed it...this was my birthday...my actual birthday. And I was wearing a sash that said I was a birthday princess!!! So my statement to the manager was simple...I understand there was a technical problem with your website, I can sympathize, but I had a salad and waited over 20 minutes for them to make this salad after I walked in the door. It's my birthday and I'm not paying for something that isn't my fault and I was inconvenienced. He didn't argue, and I didn't pay.  Now for the cherry on my birthday cake... As I'm walking back to the office, face red from the irritating encounter, I notice my salad doesn't look quite right. I sit down at the lunch table in my break room and am ready to flip my lid! I have a salad with no chicken, no corn salsa and no corn tortilla chips! And you all had the nerve to ask me to pay $15 for this!! I guess I would have had to wait another 20 minutes for the chicken. I called and the main manager on duty has given me a credit for another meal but I don't think I want to chance another visit here."
Trey N.,"Richmond, VA",139,49,137,2.0,4/20/2017,"The two star rating is solely for the excellently made pizza.  I had not been here in a couple years because the food had slid downhill so much, I decided not to come anymore, however the deep dish extreme pepperoni pizza was awesome.  I grabbed the size just above the smallest they had, which after tip ended up being $20!  To me, that price is outrageous for basically a slightly larger than a personal size pizza.  I don't remember paying nearly that much a few years ago.  The waitress was very kind and polite, however, the service she offered was not what I would consider adequate.  It was still lunch time, and there were not many people sitting down to eat.  My second drink refill came after I finished eating, kind of needed that ten minutes before, but the waitress had not come around since my pizza was brought to me except to place the check on the table, completely forgetting my water.  I can say that the food I received was good, and possibly I may order to-go, but considering the expense for the little I got and the lack of service, I won't be coming back anytime soon."
Rahul K.,"Henrico, VA",0,2,2,4.0,11/14/2016,"I usually like dining here but today's take away was awful. Tweeted and am waiting for response-   Luke, Appreciate your response, I am delighted the sincerity you have towards building a better business client relationship. Way to go BJ's."
Laura S.,"Harrison, TN",47,227,130,4.0,9/13/2016,We aren't big on chains but BJs is the exception We know we will have good solid food and beer    If it's lunch time and we can't find a local brewery with food we look for a BJs   May not seem like a big deal but for work we are on the road traveling  150+ days a year. So we try to find good and unusual spot but sometimes we just want consistent  Flatbread is good   Lunch special is nice  Thalia was out bartender and gave good service   Bonus for the non beer drinker they have great wine and cocktails  Update your electronic board.  No ginger IPA :( on draft but you are still advertising it  Upgrade to real salt and pepper grinders as well  All in all a good but not fab spot
Wael D.,"Conway, SC",43,14,3,1.0,7/3/2017,"My dad is obsessed over this place so I've been here plenty of times due to him. The food tastes decent, nothing life changing or anything, but it's good. My problem with this restaurant is the service. I've worked in the restaurant business for years and I've never seen a group of hosts/hostesses, waiters/waitresses, and even a kitchen staff so clueless and terrible at their jobs.  I've never walked in through the doors of this restaurant to be greeted by a host. The two desks for the hosts (which are placed one in front of the other instead of next to one another, what's up with that?) are always abandoned and you'll have to wait for minutes just untill a host or hostess comes to help you. I went yesterday for dinner and the restaurant was not busy at all and my dad still had to ask one of the waitresses if there were any hostesses working.  As for waiting staff, they aren't too terrible to be honest. They are nice people but they take forever to come greet you at your table and take drink orders which is annoying. Also, they will forget any small thing you change to your order. I always order a sweet tea with an extra cup of ice and I've never gotten that extra cup of ice with my drink, which isn't a big deal, I just ask them again. If you change anything on your order though, you are basically rolling the dice on whether it comes out right or not.   And now the kitchen staff. The kitchen does put out some good tasting dishes but they are notorious for being slow apparently. When I first came to BJ's with my dad and sister, my sister warned me that if you come here get ready for bad service wether it was a hostess, a waiter, or slow ticket times from the kitchen. She was definitely right.  I most likely will be dragged to BJ's by my dad again, but I wouldn't recommend coming here for dinner or anything, not because this place is terrible, but because there are much better places to eat in the area that won't have you leaving with a headache."
Sean F.,"Richmond, VA",103,239,1526,4.0,11/23/2016,"The restaurant is very nice and kind of upscale. It has a great ambiance and the staff is always extremely friendly. Most of all, their beer selection is quite impressive, especially for a chain restaurant. They have a great amount to choose from on tap and even more choices in bottles. Their website says over 160 beers! Aside from that, they're also known for their pizza. The pizza is great, but it's a little pricey. One pizza that I ordered came to $28.00, after taxes. Smh... All the other food seems to be reasonably priced and is quite good. Definitely a step above places like Fridays and Ruby Tuesday. Lastly, I would like to mention that on my last visit there, I ordered a pizza without chicken because my girlfriend is vegetarian. Unfortunately, when I picked up my order, there was chicken on it. I understand mistakes occasionally happen and I told them that it was no big deal. Even though I was very understanding about the mistake, the manager, George went way above and beyond to make up for the inconvenience. It really wasn't necessary, but I greatly appreciate it and it's instances like that, that show how great a business really is."
Karen R.,"Richmond, VA",72,130,383,5.0,12/1/2015,"So, BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse has become one of my favorite places to dine!  I was actually exposed to the restaurant in California a few years ago, but I didn't really get the full effect then. I've been here with friends, for events, and solo, and all of them have ended up the same way... extremely pleased!  Whether its the beer selection, great pizza, or tasty appetizers, I always leave full and happy.  I haven't dived into their menu fully because I keep wanting to eat the dishes I've already tried again.  Unfortunately, I can get stuck get the same dishes at particular places! But, I can attest that their pizza - deep dish & flatbread - are both delicious.  I also had the Sante Fe Spring Rolls and they were perfectly seasoned!   A must-have when you visit is a Pizookie!  These desserts come in full and mini sizes, well most do.  My personal favorite is the Peanut Butter Smore's Pizookie!  I also love the Salted Caramel! For beers, I like more of the pale ales, like the Brewhouse Blonde, which is always on tap. The hostess and servers are very inviting and friendly.  I always enjoy the service I receive with each visit. Highly recommend this place!"
Erica T.,"Charlottesville, VA",6,86,5,3.0,7/16/2016,"This was ok.  My husband, children and I ate there and we're happy with our meals. The kids meals had a good variety of options and both of mine enjoyed what they selected (corn dogs and spaghetti).  They also got the kids' pazookies which looked delicious!!  A value! My husband enjoyed his Mediterranean tacos and the 2 beers he tried. My salad (ahi tuna) was good but I had throbbing in my jaw afterward (my reaction to msg) so that was disappointing.  Skinny margarita was good. Our server was ok.  She seemed hurried (probably because it was a bust lunch time) and a couple of times I tried to order a 2nd drink but she walked away too quickly.  She also tried to take my salad away before I was done.   All in all, the kids liked it and they are far pickier than I!"
Phillip B.,"Richmond, VA",0,39,5,5.0,8/20/2017,Wanted the mahi mahi but I wanted to have a few different ingredients. Not a fan of peppers and onions. So they allowed me to pick different choices from the pizza ingredient menu. It's was awesome.  I told the server I had some mahi in the fridge at home and after the meal the cook came to my table and told me how she cooked the fish so I could try it.  I will keep coming back.  I also love the European beer choices
Haley B.,"Richmond, VA",0,1,,2.0,11/4/2017,"I had never been to a BJ's previously and I have to say i'm disappointed. My friend ordered a sirloin with asparagus and it was WAY too salty. I ordered a chicken sandwich with a caesar salad and it was ok. not the best. then i got a free dessert for joining their premier rewards, took 25 mins to get a small cookie and some ice cream. the service is poor and would not recommend. the only thing good about this place is the managers."
Krystle E.,"Glen Allen, VA",52,66,36,4.0,5/18/2017,"Never can go wrong at this spot. Every time I visit, the service and food are exceptional. With this visit there were about 15 of us. Although there were many of us, the service never lacked. The 2 servers we had were on top of it. We had many different entrees, and the kitchen made sure we all got them at the same time. Our cups were never empty and table stayed clean. I'll keep coming here as long as the service stays excellent. Oh, and they keep serving those pizookies! The salted caramel one to be exact ;)"
Tara H.,"Henrico, VA",94,168,393,5.0,6/12/2016,Thomas was great!! I tried the Mediterranean chicken tacos and the pizookie. Both were delicious. I usually get the same thing but glad I tried something different.
Leisa L.,"Pickerington, OH",55,2,3,5.0,8/11/2017,"Luke the manager was AMAZING. We had a minor hiccup with our call ahead seating. Luke bent over backwards to accommodate us. My main reason for going tonight was for my Mother's birthday and we chose this place because of one main dish, which was no longer on the menu. Luke had the kitchen make this dish anyway. Our waitress was equally amazing. I've only eaten at BJ's a handful of times but I will make this a regular spot now simply for the way Luke made us all feel!!! Thanks for my mom's bday dinner beinf awesome!!!!"
Jon B.,"Richmond, VA",184,220,192,4.0,4/1/2016,"On last Sunday I was on a mission to have lunch at a restaurant that I had not been to before. While on this mission, I came across BJ's Restaurant. I never even heard of the restaurant until about a week ago. But how did my experience go? To find out, read below.  The Good: Menu- From the looks of things, this restaurant is like Applebees on Steroids. Their menu focuses on sandwiches, burgers, chicken, ribs and pasta. The difference in a BJ's menu and an Applebees menu is the variety that BJ's offers. The menu itself has to be over 4 pages long. Those that are indecisive might take some time to make a selection but those looking for a specific taste in food will have a better chance finding it here than other restaurants that specialize in ""American Food"".  Price/Portion- I ordered the lunch special Chicken Tenders and Fries. Yes it was a safe choice in food, but the chicken tenders were around $7.50. This is a bargain considering that at other restaurants, their chicken tender meal is sold for around $10. The portion of the food was also pretty filling for the price paid.  Taste of My Meal- As stated before, I ordered the chicken tenders meal. The food was very good. The food came out hot and I did not need to add any seasoning to my fries. I could say that I was satisfied.  On the Fence: Service- The server was friendly and more than willing to accommodate any need of the table, but there were times when she disappeared for long periods and the food took longer than I thought it would take given the small number of people inside the restaurant.  Taste of the Root Beer Ribs- I had the chance to sample a rib from someone else that ordered the meal. The meat was a little tough and the seasoning was more of an acquired taste to me. It is definitely a dish that I would not order. Overall: If you are looking for a restaurant that has the Applebees on Steroids theme then this is it. The ambiance is great, food is affordable, portions are great and my group had overall positive reflections on how the food tasted. I could surely see myself coming back to this restaurant and I would be more than happy to sample other dishes on the menu aside from my favorite Chicken Tenders meal. FOUR STARS."
Myra Z.,"Rockwall, TX",0,7,,2.0,9/15/2017,"Food is fine , service not fine. Our waitress gave us attitude from the second we sat down. We asked if we could move to another table and she gave us a look and replied ""I don't know where you would even go "" (with more than half he restaurant empty, including the table right next to us which we chose). She rolled her eyes and seemed very impatient with us ordering. We got some dessert and that took forever coming out , that all the ice cream and whip was melted into soup, we didn't even touch it . When we asked about why it was sitting outside for so long she just mumbled something and walked away. But the manager did say we didn't have to pay for it."
Rodney M.,"Williamsburg, VA",28,8,1,1.0,3/9/2017,"First and last time. Wanted to try, because I heard some good things about this place. Glad ribs were on special, 2 of the six bones had no meat on them, but damn those bones were seasoned!  Clam chowder soup was below average with rubbery  chucks of clam, ( imitation clam maybe ). Salmon looked good when it came to the table until we compared the serving size to the menu picture, menu picture was larger. I'll always try anything once. This falls under that category. Sorry, first impression!"
Nur O.,"Alexandria, VA",52,1,,5.0,6/15/2017,"There's this one server, and let me tell you: he is the MOST attentive, polite, passionate, and hilarious server I've ever met. He takes pride in his work & it shows. He's definitely going places in life but in the meantime he's bringing smiles to those he serves. If you eat here, be on the look out for Holden. And if you have the honor of getting him, tip him well to show your gratitude. Plus, he's pretty easy on the eyes..."
B B.,"Indianapolis, IN",15,115,36,4.0,3/4/2017,"We have been coming here for several years I have always been very happy with overall quality, service, cleanliness and value so I haven't updated the review from one of my first visits.  I am dropping it a star based on my last 2 visits and if I based it on those alone I would only give it three stars and that may be a gift you a half a star.  The last 2 visits the food was average at best and the service was no more than 2 stars.  It seems that they have new employees all the time and the training for customer service has clearly dropped off as has the overall quality.  Last nights quality was a 2 at best service was longer than I am used to and the food temperature quality was poor.  The food wasn't hot it was warm deep dish pizza and baked ziti were just that warm which means it had been setting.  My quests is about 10 minutes just sad to see an above average to excellent place fall so short."
Iris M.,"Marietta, GA",14,44,60,4.0,3/29/2017,"Came to grab a late night bite to eat. Had the Santa Fe Salad, and it was really good. We haven't been dissatisfied when visiting BJ."
Tony C.,"Irvine, CA",242,366,763,5.0,10/1/2014,Harvest Hefeweizen.  Mediterranean Tacos.  Pumpkin Pizookie.  Done. So done. Hands down bomb dot com.  What an awesome place!
Alissa H.,"Collinsville, VA",8,2,,4.0,4/7/2017,Seating and services were prompt on a Thursday night. We sampled delicious beers on tap an enjoyed our burgers. The food arrived quickly and we followed with a dessert to share! The pizookie was amazing- so rich we didn't finish but it was very good. Our server was able to help splitting checks as I was traveling for business and need multiple receipts. She didn't hesitate to help with that. Payment was fast and easy.
Kitteesha S.,"Richmond, VA",35,7,30,4.0,4/20/2017,"If you're looking for a nice selection of appetizers, small plates, entrées, and the wonderful desert Pizookie at a moderate price this is the place you should try. My husband and I wanted an early dinner so we walked right inside where a not so polite server/waiter/host was on the phone. I thought he would acknowledge us however that didn't happen. Finally we were seated and thats when we Rebecca Y came along and sweetend the sour taste in our mouths. Not only was Rebecca bubbly and hosptalitable she recommended dishes and was attentive. We settle on the Garlic Parmesan one of Rebeccas favorites and they didnt disappoint. For our entrees we both got the Full Rack of Ribs special. That came with two sides, I had White Cheddar Potatoes and Roasted Brussel Sprouts. Husband enjoyed Asparagus & White Cheddar Potatoes. The special also included a house/cesar salad which complemented the wings perfectly. Our food came out in enough time so we wouldnt be forced to push food down our throat. We fined it out with the mini Pizookie. I had the Ghirardelli & husband enjoyed the White Macadamia Nut. The pizookie was warm and fresh. The ice cream was heavenly."
Christina R.,"Richmond, VA",23,86,72,4.0,12/15/2015,"I must admit, I hadn't heard of BJs until my fellow co workers recommended it as a place to have lunch. We were a group of 10 and were very quickly accommodated even tho we had not made reservations.  We ordered a plethora of food- everything from thin crust and deep pan pizzas, sandwiches, pastas and my favorite- ribs!  Everything was delicious. I'm giving this review 4 starts only because it took a loooong time to get our food- but nonetheless will be back again."
Charles B.,"Richmond, VA",64,103,240,4.0,9/20/2015,"Very nice atmosphere third time and have never been disappointed.  The service is great, plenty of seating so wait time is short even on a Saturday night.  The pizza and draft beer is what BJ'S is know for but there menu is huge, not quite Cheesecake factory huge but lots to choose from.  Plenty of beer and drink options. I had the BJ'S classic pizza and the medium and two salads filled us up."
