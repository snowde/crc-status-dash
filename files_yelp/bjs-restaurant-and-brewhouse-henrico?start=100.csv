Nicole B.,"Sacramento, CA",1,17,1,5.0,6/26/2015,"Great food, decent selection for a gluten intolerant individual, and wonderful service. Kyle, I believe was his name, was an excellent and attentive server."
Marc G.,"Richmond, VA",3,23,15,5.0,1/10/2016,"If you're a beer nut this place is for you. They have a large selection of brews on tap and a nice atmosphere. The food has always been good nothing over the top except their fries, they have some of the best fries I've ever had! The one thing you need to do though is save room for desert! The have something they call a salted caramel pazookie and it is FREAKIN UNBELIEVABLE!"
Yelp Y.,"Hazel Park, MI",0,7,2,2.0,9/12/2016,"Angus burger was small, wifes SOUP was cold, even with the presentation. service was great for member's?(not), since we were asked at the door. not bad flavor, small and cold."
Ronli B.,"Henrico, VA",3,37,4,5.0,12/30/2015,Sooo good! The the root beer bbq wings are so bomb. I've been here at least 7 times and my experience has always been good
Christina K.,"Richmond, VA",32,52,3,5.0,12/13/2015,"I absolutely love this place.  I think is better than rock bottom and all the brewery around the short pump area. The service is awesome, the food is on point every time and the beer is sooooooo much better than rock bottom. The beers are so good especially the pumpkin beer( although the I think the last time I was there I might have gotten the bottom) but one time out of all the times I have been there is not bad. The food is very well priced and their new wing selection are to die for. !!! Drive 100 yards down from the short pump mall and ample parking"
Gabrielle S.,"Keswick, VA",0,3,2,1.0,7/30/2016,"took over an hour to get our food, the steak and asparagus were so seasoned you couldn't tell what food you were tasting. veggie burger tasted like nothing. the other two plates of food were cold. go somewhere else to eat."
Kelli H.,"West Palm Beach, FL",58,18,5,5.0,9/13/2015,Went here for a work outing. Great food and drinks  at reasonable prices. Definitely coming back.
Matthew B.,"Henrico, VA",0,15,,1.0,8/25/2016,"Just came back from  my first experience at BJ's. It's not worth the AmounT of money we paid!!  It's WAY too expensive for the same bar food you can get anywhere else. I was extremely disappointed when they ran out of my favorite bourbon. Bullet Bourbon is not rare. There is no excuse for a bar to run out of any standard bourbon. Three of us went to dinner and had drinks and their flat pizza and our bill was $120! If you want overpriced spinach and artichoke dip, look no further. Unfortunately I, like the rest of us live on a budget and don't have money to throw away. Needless to say I will never go there again to eat or drink. Personally,  my prediction is they won't last a year."
David W.,"Mechanicsville, VA",11,9,,4.0,12/16/2015,Good beer and the deserts are good.  Food is ok and service was standard.  Pizzas at lunch were very good.
Jessica L.,"Virginia Beach, VA",55,4,,1.0,1/12/2016,Probably the worst place I have ever been. Only reason I'm giving it one star is because our server Amber was sweet. Not enough servers and the kitchen was sooooo slow. We were on our lunch break and we were there for 2 hours. I ordered a burger well done and it was raw! Will not go back.
Eric V.,"Manakin-Sabot, VA",0,210,32,3.0,1/2/2016,Good pizza and burgers. Italian marker is my fav. House beers are solid. Bar staff excellent. They carry some local brews too but not enough.
Courtney T.,"Decatur, GA",165,91,104,3.0,10/18/2014,"Cool vibe, nice staff and great pumpkin cookie dessert. The pizza was cool and the drink I had was good, but the price was kind of high for a frozen cocktail."
Nick P.,"Henrico, VA",75,20,8,4.0,11/20/2015,"Pan Pizza is good, lemon herb wings are great.  Service could be a bit better.  Fun place to watch a football game too!"
Nick R.,"New York, NY",2,20,,3.0,2/24/2016,"Great beers and a nice vibe inside. However, the food left me questioning why we had gone there for dinner. Skip the deep dish pizza and fried calamari. The French fries were the best part of the meal. Subpar service. Probably won't return."
Ashley W.,"Amelia Court House, VA",1,2,,1.0,6/14/2016,"I rarely get my husband out of the house, but he agreed to come out for dinner and beer at BJ'S. He ordered a Dos Equis on tap, our server came back a few minutes later and said they're changing the keg and it would be right out. The beer came...and was completely flat. He asked her and she said well there is still some left and they don't want to tap a new keg, he could get something else or have another flat one. Couldn't believe it, you really expect your customers to drink flat beer at a brewhouse?! So he ordered a different beer and at the end of the meal asked if he could chat with the manager. He explained what happened (and noted the server and the food were great). The manager told him that he didn't taste the beer so he doesn't know if it was flat (so we are liars now?!), and said we had too much information and they don't serve flat beer. My husband walked out and as I was paying the bill  (including asking them to remove the flat beer we sent back), the manager came back and said he did go check and the keg was empty, that they should have given him a new beer and to apologize on his behalf. Too late now, won't be back here EVER."
Quyen D.,"Colonial Heights, VA",9,15,22,4.0,11/8/2014,The service was okay.. I went for lunch and had the chilli in the sourdough loaf.. Chilli was okay!!  Nothing to brag about!! Ordered the crispy calamari for appetizer!! That's was great!! And the BBQ lunch platter. The chicken and pulled pork was good but the bun for the pulled pork was hard!! Love the shoe lace fries!! I love the atmosphere overall it was pretty good experience. Give it a try!!
Robbie L.,"Glen Allen, Richmond, VA",0,3,,2.0,11/7/2015,"Over priced for the quality of food and service.  My date had sirloin, fries , and broccoli cheese soup, steak was over cooked,  the soup eh.  I had the New Orleans Jambalaya was ok large portion of shrimp, chicken and sausage , ok spicy, would have been better if I didn't have to wait on refill of tea 10 minutes to eat dinner.  Had a calamari appetizer was good not great.  Dinner was ready as we were finishing appetizer  Then took 5 minutes to receive  Bill was $55. No alcohol   Left a 10 dollar tip any way. I won't go back."
Frank P.,"Richmond, VA",54,35,45,1.0,1/7/2016,"Unfortunately I will not be returning the ""deep dish"" pizza I ordered was not up to par I was not satisfied I ate one slice and my girlfriend ate one slice and we left the rest didn't even want to take it with us. The apple ale was good so we did enjoy some part of the experience but it was not the food, the atmosphere was pretty decent but I was not a fan of the food I received."
Kristen M.,"Midlothian, VA",101,3,,5.0,6/20/2015,I love all the food and beer ive ever gotten there. Everyone that works there has been super nice and friendly. Its great! I highly recommend it!
A P.,"Radford, VA",0,6,,5.0,6/29/2015,Went here this past weekend. The service was excellent and so was most the food. The avocado egg rolls sucked even the waitress said they weren't made correctly. But the rest of our food was delicious. I had the mediterranean chicken tacos SO good. I got the salad as my side. My boyfriend had the buffalo chicken pizza which was also fantastic!
