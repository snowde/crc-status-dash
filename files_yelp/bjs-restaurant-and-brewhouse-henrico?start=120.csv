Jackie C.,"Henrico, VA",47,4,2,5.0,12/19/2015,"First timers here. Waitress was poor but the food is fantastic. We started with a flight, had the deep dish favorite -delish. Santa Fe rolls we will probably pass next time but we're very tasty. House salad was great and finished with a salted caramel pizookie to die for. Awesome shareable also. Manager came by to say hello - nice guy. We paid the tab and sat at the bar. Micah and Winston are awesome and probably one of the best long islands. We will definitely be back for the atmosphere, staff, and obviously the food. There are so many items on the menu you have to come back!"
Kelly B.,"Newport News, VA",44,14,,4.0,3/18/2015,This place was really close to our hotel and I am a huge fan of trying new beers so when we saw this place we had to try it. First of all I loved all the beers available! I was able to try their home brewed brown ale and i thought it was delicious. The other members of my party stuck to beers they already know and love I wish more of us had been adventurous so I could have tasted more. The service was great there were 7 of us and it was relatively busy we were seated with no trouble. We all ordered various things every one really liked their food the Chicken Parm WAS HUGE and not drowning in sauce. The food came out in a timely manner. All in all I would come back again if I was in the area.
Lee W.,"Glen Allen, VA",0,20,1,2.0,2/11/2015,"Service was good. However, the beer and food was meh. We tried a few beers at $5.95 a glass. I would rather buy a local beer; much better. The food was meh too. We tried the potato skins, Tune Poke, Frito nachos, wings, and the chicken lettuce wraps. The poke and potato skins were bland. The Frito nachos were soggy, but ok. The lettuce wraps were WAY to salty. The wings actually pretty good, but the place is not worth returning to just for wings. We probably will not be back...too many other good places in Richmond."
Rva M.,"Henrico, VA",1,48,,1.0,2/26/2016,"We had come in early Short Pump before 6pm. Slow service. Watermelon margarita was like water and tequila over a lot of ice for the price. Big deal $1 off for happy hour. Then had Shrimp tacos that the shrimp was a little questionable squishy. Not seasoned at all. We can in after joining their rewards program that offered some free dessert. Well it was not showing up on rewards. A man came over who didn't introduce himself as a manager and stated ""Well if its on there it will come off when the check is rung up, but if it was used that is why its not showing up"" I laughed well this is our first time here so its not used we want the dessert so it never came off. No worries we won't come back. This is typical mismanagement of a restaurant in Short Pump, Get your act together or become another failed restaurant."
Ross M.,"Henrico, VA",0,5,2,4.0,3/21/2015,Had a good dinner. Service was good and the food was hot. Ordered the deep dish pizza and it was really good. Would get it again. Nutty Brewnette was tasty.
Mandi V.,"Norfolk, VA",3,8,,1.0,3/5/2015,"Tiffany S I emailed you and was really hoping you might try and make the situation better but I never heard back from you. Cooper's Hawk Winery opened around he same time as you and I visited that restaurant recent and had the most wonderful experience, I unfortunately will probably not give you another chance especially with such a wonderful competitor so close. Good luck"
David H.,"Washington, DC",111,774,769,2.0,12/4/2014,just your average chain brewery/restaurant with no focus (too many menu options = none are great). if there are pictures on your menu i wont take you seriously
Arnold G.,"Midlothian, VA",9,69,85,2.0,2/13/2015,The food was OK for our second visit but the Waitress was totally disconnect. She brought the food before bringing the drinks then charged us for drinks we didn't have. Isn't she the one that keys that stuff in?
Tim L.,"Bumpass, VA",39,75,36,5.0,12/22/2014,The food and beer are amazing. Just writing this review makes me want to go back NOW!!
Carol M.,"Glen Allen, VA",0,11,,2.0,9/12/2015,"First time visit. Ordered calamari app.  When the waiter put it down it was fairly obvious to both me and my husband that it was burnt. Despite the burnt smell and appearance, we did each try to eat one of the least burnt-looking pieces.  It was terrible.  They took it back and off the bill, but how could quality control be that bad?  I also didn't like the pizza, but that may just be a matter of taste.  Other than the waiter not noticing condition of the calamari, the service was fine and everyone was friendly."
Tara B.,"Richmond, VA",17,142,14,3.0,4/10/2015,"I think this place is okay but I don't get people's fascination with it. They have good pizzas and a large menu but having been there twice, I don't see why the place is packed - aside from the fact that it is new."
Darlene M.,"Henrico, VA",0,1,,1.0,10/21/2015,"The meal was served by a waitress who altered two family's checks, food served cold, buns burned and poorly delivered. Do yourself a favor, stay home. The rectification of the two family's checks of over $100 was less than stellar. Receiving a $50 gift receipt for an altered tip on two separate checks, which is illegal, really doesn't seem to balance the scale. Disappointed in Short Pump and Mechanicsville"
David B.,"Henrico, VA",0,4,,1.0,11/5/2016,"Was great when it first opened, but food and service have gone downhill.  Wasn't please with the food or service about six months ago.  Went last night, and unfortunately, had the same result.  Our meal took over twenty minutes and there was no wait when we got there.  Got my wife's order completely wrong.  They forgot my fries.  When I asked about the fries she said they bring it right out.  They did, but the fries were burned.  Not crispy mind you . . . burned.  They even tasted burned.  No biggie, since the BBQ sandwich was enough in itself.  The manager did come over and ask my wife if she wanted a free appetizer while she waited for her meal.  We declined.  However, had we known that it would take another fifteen minutes, we might have taken her up on the offer.  When they finally brought the entree, they forgot to bring it with the rice pilaf.  They brought that out five minutes later.  The manager came over and apologized again and did remove my wife's meal from the tab.  Still, way too many mistakes to be going back.  Kind of sad since we loved going there when it first opened."
Tiffany N.,"Charlotte, NC",1,5,13,1.0,11/15/2014,"Tonight I made my first trip into Bjs Brewhouse, I was let down a few times during my visit that I feel should be brought to your attention. Prior to my arriving at the restaurant I placed a reservation through your Preferred Waitlist, the confirmation said that I had a 40 minute wait.  Immediately after placing the reservation I received a text saying my table was ready, please proceed to the host stand to be seated.  I went up to the hostess stand and was told that they had clicked me in on accident and that my table wasn't ready, that I still had the original 40 minutes to wait.  This was fine and I had a seat.  The waiting room began to clear out to the point we had to stand when we came in and were seated by ourselves (6 of us) when we started to wonder when our table would be ready.  My friends also made a reservation when they arrived and they were told 1 hour to 1 hour 15 minutes at 6:45. They were told at 8 that it would be an additional 30 minutes to an hour.  At 8:00pm my husband went up to the hostess to check on our table which included two 4 year old children and was told that we would have an additional 30 minutes-hour wait and that I was quoted the incorrect time in the beginning.  Finally we were seated at 8:28 (through my friends reservation on the wait list) and we sat down and ordered, our waitress Tony was very friendly and apologized for our wait.  I received my text after we had been seated. When our food arrived 5 of our 6 guests received their meals, I assumed that they couldn't carry mine as well and that they would be back.  We continued to wait for more time as my friends ate their food and I snacked on some of my husbands dinner.  When Tony came around she checked to make sure everything was okay and that is when I told her that I never received my dinner, she apologized and went to find out where it was.  She returned with my dinner and I thanked her and began to eat.  After a few bites a manager named Luke came over and asked how our visit was going and I couldn't be quiet any longer, I expressed to him how disappointed I was with the wait, service, and that my food hadn't arrived; also that I was hungry and sharing food with my friends until my plate had arrived.  He replied saying jokingly that I had wanted to do that anyway with trying everyone else food, I laughed it off but was not in the mood after this visit.  He told us to let him know if there was anything he could do and hoped we had a good rest of our meal.   We received our check, paid and left; I was very disappointed with my first visit to Bjs and don't know that I would return or recommend it to any of my family or friends."
Mitchell S.,"Mechanicsville, VA",3,11,,1.0,10/22/2014,Seems like just another place just trying to cash in on the craft brew popularity. Piss poor management running around like the world was ending when a large party showed up to be seated. With so many selections of places to spend money in the Short Pump area this should be your last...right behind Taco Bell.
Josh A.,"Midlothian, VA",0,3,,2.0,12/8/2014,"Went here as a date night with my girlfriend. Waited 45 minutes before we were seated. Took 20 minutes just to get drinks and about another 15 before we were able to order our meal. The pizza we got was below average at best. Not worth the money, Go elsewhere if you want good food and service"
Amy L.,"Leesburg, VA",54,176,8,2.0,11/8/2014,"Overall, I'd rate this chain restaurant as Inconsistent. As another Yelper mentioned, the menu had food residue on it. I got a wedge salad that was mostly delicious but marred by a slimy leaf that should have been removed by the kitchen.   I ordered a pizza since that seemed to be a specialty.  About 20 minutes later, a waitress (not our server) comes by holding a large pizza pan with the handle-type thing they use.  [I wonder at the time if I ordered the individual size I had planned, but assume I had ordered incorrectly.]  She sees that there's no pizza ""stand"" so she leaves with the pizza.  Several minutes pass.  She comes back with the stand and the pizza.  I ask her for a plate.  Several minutes go by and still no plate.  Now our waiter stops by and says ""this isn't your pizza"".  Then he goes off to serve another table.  So I have a pizza that's apparently not mine and still no plate.  Finally the waiter comes back to say that they ran out of small pans so they upgraded my pizza for free.  I now ask him for a plate, which he brings after several more minutes.  So I finally have a plate to go with my now-lukewarm pizza.  It's pretty tasteless anyway, but I can't take a chance on ordering something else for fear of how long it will take. In the meantime, I've finished my iced tea and would like a refill.  Our waiter isn't around and no one else is paying attention.  I go as far as to hold my glass up, somewhat out of the table & into the aisle, in the hopes that someone who works there will see.  Several servers swerve to avoid my empty glass. My son ordered a cookie for dessert - the pizookie thing without the ice cream.  The waiter sets in front of him and the next thing my son is crying because he burnt his hands on the pan.  I rush him to the bathroom to run cold water on his hands, but the water is quite warm.  Normally I would enjoy this temperature, but of course it doesn't help me for a burn. We return to the table so my son can put his hand on the drink glass with ice in it.   The waiter comes by and I tell him that he really needs to tell kids that the pan is hot.  He says he did say that.  I don't recall hearing him, but even if he did it's clear my son hadn't paid attention. The manager comes over, very apologetic.  He comps our pizza and dessert.  So at least we didn't spend a lot of money...  During our visit, I saw managers visiting other tables too so perhaps they had an off nite?  Anyway, we were just visiting Richmond so wouldn't have much opportunity to visit BJ's again.  But I think I'd be more likely to go to another basic chain (TGIFridays, Red Robin, etc.) instead of BJs."
Jessica Y.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,10,,5.0,1/4/2015,Went to the Orlando location on our last vacation; we just moved to the Richmond area and I realized there is a location here! Went tonight with my fiancé and it was great! Awesome beer selection! Great menus and both of our meals were good. Also had great service! Nice atmosphere. Will probably be one of our regular places..especially with all the happy hour specials!
William M.,"Henrico, VA",166,85,,4.0,10/21/2014,"Well first of all, this is one of the only places that I know of in the greater Richmond area that serves deep-dish pizza. And its good. Really good. A lot of their food, in terms of concept, is very run-of-the-mill, such as grilled mahi-mahi. However, some of the other options I have never heard of and sound delicious (pepperoni pizza DIP). The beer is impeccable. Really good. Also, our wonderful server introduced me to the idea of putting a few drops of tobasco into a fireball shot. Don't knock it until you try it. This place is so great, my only complaint is that there isn't any outside dining areas."
Matt R.,"Glen Allen, VA",22,1,3,1.0,9/3/2015,"Done the take out option twice now, first time had 2 of the lunch specials, the fries were soggy, the chicken was rubbery. The southern fried chicken didn't even have the gravy it was supposed to have on it. Gave em one more chance and the second time, tried their ""signature"" deep dish pizza, it barely had any sauce and was barely warm. There are too many good restaurants around to waste your time here."
