Liberty W.,"Richmond, VA",0,4,1,1.0,4/10/2016,"The food is ok but the service is absolutely terrible. We arrived at 12 this Saturday and were told we would need to wait 25 mins. We were seated at 12:40. By the time we ordered, received food, and paid it was 3pm!!   Example is we had asked for ketchup, waited for ~10mins at which point someone in our party walked around to get ketchup from another table across the floor."
Scott N.,"Glen Allen, VA",0,4,,4.0,12/10/2014,Have been several times and have not been disappointed. The food has been excellent each time and the beer selection is great. Much more impressed with the food in comparison to Rock Bottom. Quickly becoming our go to restaurant.
Food C.,"York, SC",0,68,9,1.0,11/10/2015,Never got served was seated and looked at watch to ask what time happy hour ended when waitress came. 15 minutes later still sitting there no one ever came by. Place was not crowed as there was a booth behind us getting things. Sever employees just hanging around the hostess stand talking and texting. After 15 minutes we left and on the way out confronted the manager. He apologized but at that point we went elsewhere. This is a no return for us.
Dave C.,"Henrico, VA",4,41,2,3.0,10/30/2014,Just another chain restaurant in Short Pump.  Food tastes same as any other restaurant on strip. Fries were shoe lace style which I liked. Menu had food on one page and a black hair on another.  Not a good start.  Server brought out flight of 4 beers for wife and me but forgot which ones were which.  So much for sampling new beers.  I did like the pumpkin ale and red ale once figured out.  Server was very attentive though.  BJ's has a lot of tightening up to do.  (Start with wiping menus) We're in no rush to head back. Blah.
Shelby J.,"Henrico, VA",0,27,,5.0,7/15/2015,"I ordered the BJ's Favorite deep dish pizza and hot wings. The small pizza is enough for two people to share. The pizza and the hot wings were delicious.  I will never order pizza from anywhere else. For dessert our table shared the pizooke trio, you choose 3 warm cookies from 7 different flavors and top it off with a scoop of  ice cream. The kids loved and so did the adults, not to sweet just right. They also offer gluten free cookie too. Our server was named Cassie and she was GREAT took the time to explain items on the menu and handcrafted beers that they serve. I will definitely go back and I will ask for Cassie. Excellent food and service!!"
Michelle J.,"Hilton Head Island, SC",0,17,4,5.0,11/27/2014,"Once again, AMAZING!!! I have been back almost every week since they have opened and I love this place! Always excellent service and wonderful food & beer. I've been there for both lunch & dinner and I haven't been disappointed. (These negative reviews from others on here must be employees from the competitor restaurants!) BJs IS GREAT!!!! Go try it!!!!!!"
Barbara S.,"Henrico, VA",0,12,1,5.0,1/14/2016,Loved this place! Awesome food and beer options. The  honey siracha Brussel sprouts are to die for and the fried chicken was great too. Their ipa was delicious and so was their pale ale. You can't go wrong here!
Michelle C.,"Henrico, VA",0,24,,3.0,12/31/2015,"While to food was decent and the prices are reasonable, the service was lacking.  We had to ask several times for the same drink refill.  The last beer we ordered never arrived.  The appetizers came out after the meal.  Even if the food had been exceptional, that kind of service is enough to turn me off."
Kevern S.,"Herndon, VA",0,2,,3.0,6/18/2016,"BJ's was moderately busy in a Saturday night; we were a party of five so seating time was a few minutes as supply is limited. We looked at menus and were pretty decided upon seating. Soda and waters to drink and a quick fried artichoke appetizer. The drinks and app came and we quickly decided that the oil was dirty, as well as the dish having a few fries, Brussels sprout leaves and a tortilla chip included. It went back; nothing but graciousness from the server with an offer from a management visit. The soup, chicken tortilla, was brought, with a table side pour presentation. Hotter soup would have been better, but it was tasty. Cafe Rio is superior, for what that's worth. The table ordered two enlightened dishes, a kids burger, French dip, and sirloin. The Mahi and shrimp came out as a Jambalaya and was also returned. The penne shrimp and asparagus was tasty enough, the Mahi and shrimp was delivered; meager on the couscous and the Mahi a bit firm on the cooked side. Ok, it was dry and kind of flavorless. The shrimp had no real flair either. The spinach was more in the volume of maybe... 4 leaves worth... Further consideration led me to conclude the Mahi sauce was heavily salted. The bread for the French dip was soggy before it was even dipped."
Wc H.,"Manakin-Sabot, VA",1,41,,4.0,1/6/2016,"Been here several times now and it's fast becoming a family favorite.  The food has always been awesome and service very good.  House beers are drinkable, but nothing to write home about it.  That said, there are always great alternative choices to go with the excellent food."
Steve J.,"Spotsylvania, VA",1,78,2,2.0,8/9/2015,The food and service here has really fallen off. It used to be my favorite place to eat at but I won't ever go back. The last few times the food has been horrible and the servers don't seem to care. It's pretty typical for a place to be good when it's new and then fall off and BJ's is no exception .
Robert S.,"Henrico, VA",0,2,,4.0,10/13/2015,went to this location atmosphere was entoxicating. food was fantastic a little slow on getting served but the hot food and taste made up for the wait. ive noticed that there are no employees over 30 makes me wonder if I applied would I be hired based on my resume or passed  over due to my age. just a thought.
Phil G.,"Henrico, VA",0,2,,4.0,10/12/2014,"Stopped by BJ's, the new brewpub in Short Pump. Food was surprisingly good and the service was outstanding. But, I know you are here for the beer! Octoberfest-skip, Pumpkin-tasty and reminded me of the fireballs we used to eat as a kid. Sample size was plenty, not sure I could drink a whole glass. IPA and Red-spot on for style, but not spectacular. The porter and stout-very solid, enjoyed the porter just a little more, Nutty Brewnette (Brown)- my favorite of the meal. Some of the others you could drink the sample and that would be plenty. The Brown, I could have enjoyed several. Overall, good solid beers with some worthy of having again... but shouldn't impact the local breweries in anything but a positive way... gateway craft beers!"
Kathy W.,"Richmond, VA",0,17,10,1.0,1/9/2015,"There were tons of tables open. I toldthe hostess two people & she looked at me confused & then said someone else seat us... waited while she sat new people that came in... waited 10 mins then that same hostess seated us. Again, tons if teo tops open. Very odd. The service was awful. Our waitress spent most of her time at the computer. We sat for 18 minutes before our waitress made her first appearance to get our drink order (water). We ordered our food then too. Another table near ys w said waitress had the same thing happen to them. All the food came out (soup, salad, apps, entrees at same time & we had no room on the tiny table. She forgot my ranch for my salad & never came ti check on us so my friend finished her meal before I got to take a bite of my salad. Again, never had worse service. This place did not live up to the hype & food was not that great. It was an annoying experience overall. I wanted to ask her for a bix but every time i tried to talk to her she ran away in a rush. No boxes. Wasted food."
Bryan F.,"Henrico, VA",0,1,,1.0,9/20/2015,"Avoid, avoid, avoid.  Enter facility and provide name for table (wife did this while I was 3 yards from her).  They ask for cell phone and state will page us.  Wait 10 minutes while looking at empty tables.  Some people seated. Wait 10 minutes and watch.  Wait another 10 minutes and finally ask.  They look and cannot locate name or cell phone while multiple people enter after us being seated.  Entire time the guy is standing 8 yards from us and never said a word  as to why we're waiting to be seated.  He spent his time talking while staring right at us.  Finally they seat us after me asking (male).  Place orders and wait for food.   Food arrives and is almost worst have ever seen.  Horrible taste..  Burnt pizza. Seems like from cardboard box of processed junk. Not sure there is any incredient that is even real food.  They did not even get the orders correct and brought our guests the wrong food.   Eat and pay bill with regular 20% tip as generally provide.  Doing accounting next and find the restaurant has falsley charged the wrong amount twice in the card.   Unfortunately, they'll probably stay in business b/c of all the beer and drink options.  That said, best scenario is to close forever. Scale of 1-5 would be negative 1.  Avoid.  Have to pick a 1 star to post."
Lisa A.,"MANAKIN SABOT, VA",0,42,,1.0,11/22/2014,"Long wait even after calling ahead for preferred seating. Very disorganized and inefficient staff starting with Manager. He never smiles, or speaks to customers, just walks in circles all night. Flatbread pizza was cold and average at best. Deep dish pizza was only slightly better. French fries were cold and had to replaced. Waited FOREVER for food. Slow service + subpar food + poor management= customers who don't return. Get it together starting with new managers."
Peter R.,"Henrico, VA",0,6,,2.0,1/2/2015,I have had lunch here twice. Both times had Pizza/Salad lunch deal. First time was pretty good. Second time they left my salad on the pizza plate under the heating lamp. Salad was inedible it was so hot. Don't think I will be making it back here anytime soon.
F.R. N.,"Chester, VA",34,17,1,2.0,6/11/2015,"Food wasn't bad but was a disappointment. I ordered a ""deep dish"" which really wasn't. Don't expect anything even remotely like a Chicago style pizza or even any other pizza you would think of as ""Deep Dish"". The pizza wasn't bad but the extreme pepperoni was anything but with very little cheese, very little sauce, & very few toppings. I expected a better pie than a typical pizza place since it was something the restauratant was known for. Potato skins were small and while not bad they weren't up to par with any potato skins I've had at other restaurants though there were enough for everyone to share which was a plus. Again not bad but if you are coming for the food you probably should go elsewhere."
Z T.,"Henrico, VA",0,10,,2.0,11/15/2014,"Decent food, subpar service. We went in with a decent size party of seven.  There was a little wait  to be seated, but no problem. When we sat down, we ordered drinks and food for the kids right away. We also mentioned we had a birthday. It took almost 20 mins for our drinks to come out. From that point on it was a chase to get anything else. At one point, one of the kids spilled a drink bc the top just would not stay on. The juice went all over the table and floor. We had to hound a bus person to get napkins for clean up. No one offered to refill the drink. We never heard another word from our server about the birthday. Our food was decent, but I will think twice before giving them another try. Bad service is just not worth it."
Bob C.,"Glen Allen, VA",0,31,,5.0,12/25/2014,"Excellent place! A lot of menu options, great for family's. Friendly and attentive wait staff! Great dining experience on a Christmas Eve!"
