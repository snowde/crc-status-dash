Karoline B.,"Henrico, VA",68,21,,2.0,4/12/2015,"My boyfriend and I have been here several times and have had only one good experience and 3 bad ones. I loved the lemon thyme chicken the first time we came. The sauce was delicious. However the next two times I ordered it they left off the sauce and I tried waiting for it but my boyfriend finished eating before I got it both times.     One of the visits my Togo order was ordered wrong and 40 minutes after I initially ordered them, I finally received my potato skins with the tiny bit of cheese on them burnt off. I had to retop them at home for my brother. Their curbside stops at like 9 I think, though they didn't bother to tell me that when I ordered. They took my car details and everything.     And to top it off, in all of these visits I have never had a table visit by a manager. Not for one of the mistakes nor a general stop and check. It has the bones of a decent place if they could get the consistency in place. Unfortunately they won't be getting my money for quite a while."
Paige W.,"Henrico, VA",0,1,,5.0,10/24/2014,"I had the greatest experience last night. We where sat quickly and had the sweetest server. It's was our first time in the and we are now regulars. Appetizers came out fast and where delicious. Definitely say try the Avocado egg rolls, they are fantastic. Food was great, nice and hot. But the best part of our experience was our server Devon. GREAT serves and a awesome personality. Thanks for a great experience."
Doug M.,"Glen Allen, VA",0,21,,1.0,5/25/2015,"My wife, son and I visited BJ's Brewhouse two weeks ago for dinner. It was not very busy at all and we were seated right away. We have eaten at this location previously and have always had a three - four star experience. Unfortunately, this time was a complete disaster. App arrived well after meal was received and the meals were inedible. We insisted on paying for our drinks, but left without eating any food. Manager did take care of the bill, which was appropriate considering nothing was edible."
Julie G.,"Chesapeake, VA",0,35,2,3.0,12/3/2014,"I am  being kind when I say it was ok. Went there last night , not busy , was offering 1/2 price wine,  ran out of wine glasses so I drank my 6 oz wine out of a 20 oz beer glass. . Why offer  1/2 price wine and not have enough wine glasses!!! Why would you market something and not be prepared for the marketing to work.!!! My last two visits were good so I brought my boss and co workers for a holiday celebration . I won't be back in fact tonight I went to Longhorn because I was embarrassed about last night . We had a great experience at L H."
Brian C.,"Glen Allen, VA",49,5,4,1.0,2/6/2015,Don't waste your hard earned dollars going here.  Coolest part is pre-ordering and telling them when you are showing up.  Food was terrible.  Shrimp lettuce wraps had wilted lettuce and cold inners.  They got my order wrong even though I pre-ordered and the pita chicken tacos tasted like bad fish with a horrible sauce.  I asked for the side order they didn't include and they brought it and then tried charging me.  The beers are average at best and don't hold a candle to Rock Bottom Brewery beers.  Go somewhere else!
Jodie B.,"Richmond, VA",0,2,,1.0,11/11/2015,Well let's hope the food wins us over because the service sure hasnt.  Took 15 mins to get my tea. Almost 20 mins for my husbands beer.  The calamari was just ok. Didn't come out hot and it was over fried. Dinner - I ordered fried chicken without the gravy  and my husband order chicken Barbados with black beans and rice. Apparently my chicken was prepared with gravy and needed tonbe re-prepared but during that tume my husband's dish sat under the heat lamp and when the food arrived the beans on his plate were dried out and unedible - definite heat lamp fatality. We called the manager and asked for the check for what we ate but didnt want the dinner. He said there were computer problems last night. Well that would account for the extremely long waits but not the quality of the food. - obviously there is no quality control at this restaurant.  The manager did cover the entire check which was appreciated but I doubt we will make the trek to Short Pump again for this particular restaurant.  It's a shame because the food on the website did look tasty.
Naveen C.,"Henrico, VA",16,3,,1.0,7/19/2015,"We had horrible dining experience here ,We never experienced this kind of  rude receiving from  a waitress ,her name is Mariya.We 4 people went for Bjs today at 7 pm that is 07/19/2015.We were showed our seating from the reception staff,it was fine till there,then this waitress Mariya comes and showing so much attitude.She was rude ,arrogant ,impolite,mannerless and need so much training in customer service.Because we mentioned about her rude behavior with manager she was angry and threw bill on our table,I have never seen in my entire life this kind of insulting behavior from a waitress then other manager comes and says he will talk to her ,I doubt about  his abilities as well,when I was explaining he didn t show any concern he just has to listen so he listened ,thats all.for chain restaurants like this they should train their employees how to behave with customers.I will give 0 starts for their customer service and I will never go this place and I ll share my experience with my friends also."
Lauren K.,"Maidens, VA",0,5,1,3.0,12/14/2014,"Went on a Sunday night after dinner service, just to catch the late game and some drinks and apps. Bartender was  attentive, advised us of specials, and drinks and food were received in a timely manner. On a whim, we decided to get coffee drinks and dessert, a rarity to us. The coffee drinks were made specifically, and while we drank them we patiently waited on dessert. Dessert never came, we asked about it, the order hadn't been placed, and it was rushed to us, placed in front of us, then we expressed that we had expected to enjoy it with our after dinner drinks. Dessert was promptly taken away from us and removed from the bill with an apology, and nothing else. Being familiar with the industry, guest satisfaction is a first, and to ensure return visit, management should have provided dessert or at least made a visit to apologize about the lengthy wait. The bartender was fantastic, but the management have acknowledged the experience."
