Jerome J.,"Goochland, VA",49,28,26,4.0,10/31/2015,"I crave the food here all the time. I was a little confused about this place at first but now I really like it. The restaurant is open and there is great seating. The atmosphere is inviting and comfortable. I've been here a few times and you will not leave hungry. They give generous portions and have a great selection of meals to choose from. I personally enjoy the pulled pork BBQ sandwich which I can nearly taste just thinking about it. Their pizza also looked very tasty and ,again, portions are excellent.  The beer is also great. I like the fact that they do have their own craft beer and it is very tasty. I like that you can come in and have your growler filled inside. I would recommend this place to beer enthusiast and those looking for a great meal with large portions."
Erica G.,"Richmond, VA",64,140,826,5.0,12/6/2015,"If you are wanting a great deep dish pizza complimented with a great libation then head over to BJ's Brewhouse. BJ's is a beer lovers haven. They have a vast amount of beers, ales, ciders and signature cocktails to choose from. They definitely give Capital Ale House a run for their money with their IPA choices. Some of my personal favorite adult beverage selections here are the Blonde Ale and the Berry Cider.  On my most recent visit they had some seasonal berry themed cocktails in lue of the impending holidays. I decided to indulge on the blood orange pom sangria. It was full of flavor but the sweetness of the wine was mellowed and balanced with a cinnamon stick that gave the drink a hint of spice. It was delicious! There are so many unique pizza selections at BJ's. From traditional pepperoni to the sweet pig, there is a pizza for everyone. My friend and I chose the BBQ Chicken Pizza, which was absolutely amazing. This deep dish creation includes juicy chicken accented with fresh tomatoes, cilantro and savory bbq sauce. We definitely enjoyed our pie!  Make sure you leave room for dessert so you can try out their pizookie. A hybrid of a cookie and a pizza, the pizookie is a great ending to any meal. They are served hot, and sweet topped with a scoop of ice cream. My mouth is watering reminiscing about this sweet treat. We couldn't decide on just one flavor, so we got the trio of peanut butter, cookies and cream and salted caramel. Every bite was worth the delicious calories. I am already looking forward to my next visit to BJ's to try a different pizza and pizookie!"
Ernesto G.,"Lorton, VA",22,26,19,5.0,7/9/2016,"Great staff, outstanding atmosphere, excellent food!! The deep dish pizza is fantastic, the beer selection is diverse even for this Guinness drinker. If in the neighborhood stop by, you won't be unhappy. Our waiter Thomas was phenomenal he truly made it a good evening."
Nancy K.,"Manakin-Sabot, VA",0,3,,1.0,2/21/2017,"I had good things about the pizza at BJ's, so I ordered a specialty pizza for take out. While the crust was deep-dish, there was not even a hint of a yeast taste so prevalent in good NY pizza. The crust, in fact, was very rubbery and unsatisfying. The toppings were unremarkable. They certainly did not taste fresh. For the price I certainly expected so much more. Very disappointed. Won't go back."
Anna V.,"Henrico, VA",0,15,,3.0,7/14/2017,"I like the look on the interior. Very extensive menu, food and drinks were pretty good.  Have been 3 times so far. Great for late night. I would go back."
Elaine L.,"Chesterfield, VA",78,2,,2.0,7/8/2017,"The food is good, but the service is absolutely terrible. It took us an hour to get half of our tables food and another 20 minutes to get the rest of the tables food. And it wasn't busy at all! The food was good but half of it was cold by the time it got to our table. Everyone always complained about the horrible service and now I see what they were talking about"
Kay L.,"Richmond, VA",0,13,2,4.0,1/1/2017,"Went here for New Years the server Marcus was great! He was really knowledgeable, friendly, and really cute :-)...I will be back!"
Chris L.,"Midlothian, VA",67,458,18,4.0,9/22/2015,Been here several times and always good.   Not the largest beer selection in Richmond but one of the best varieties.  Their BJ's house beers are very good but they also have on draft many other selections (including light beers for those that aren't into craft beers - something many craft beer restaurants bypass). Food has been very good including the burgers.  I took off one star because we have never been overly impressed with the pizzas (which they have a large selection).  Everything else has been first rate. They kinda don't take reservations.  For up to 6 people you actually can get the BJs phone app and do the call ahead function to put you on the list.  There is also an order ahead option which you could in theory use for a reservation.  You can place a Dine In order for a specific time - so I have in past ordered appetizers dine in for a specific time (thus reserving our table). Not normally a long line except weekends between about 6-8 can be up to 30 minutes from walking in.
Grace L.,"Las Vegas, NV",150,58,160,4.0,6/30/2015,"I first learned about BJs while out in Vegas and was excited to discover that there was one here! This location did not disappoint.  Wide selection of beer and solid food offerings. On this visit we got the spicy Hawaiian deep dish pizza and a lunch portion of the Cajun chicken pasta which came with the option of a wedge salad.  Portions are pretty good, I could have gotten two meals out of the lunch portion of pasta. However the ""Cajun"" flavor left more to be desired. For me it was more of just a chicken and tomato pasta, didn't really seem Cajun to me.  Deep dish pizza is definitely the way to go, and get yourself a salad to go with! I'm pretty picky about my salad and the wedge was satisfying to me.  To top things off we ordered a sampler of three pizzookies, which is always a hit!"
Alisha A.,"Richmond, VA",0,7,,5.0,7/17/2016,"I've been to two locations, the one here and in Daytona Florida. Both equally as amazing!  The meat lovers pizza is a good portion, has a ton of meat, and always makes you drool. The burgers are cooked to your liking and has the best selections of toppings. Their burger sauces are unique and a perfect addition. The pazookie is a must have if you're ordering dessert but something you could easily make at home.  The atmosphere is not loud but can be if there's an important game playing at the bar.  Service is fast and very attentive."
Kimberly L.,"Chester, VA",12,16,4,2.0,1/9/2017,We ordered a large pizza and baked ziti a couple days ago for take out and it was disappointing. The pizza and baked ziti was very over cooked and dry. I asked for extra sauce and it appeared not to have any at all. My first experience was better.
Fred L.,"San Jose, CA",1,84,277,4.0,11/9/2016,"On a recent business trip to Richmond I had dinner at the BJs which was walking distance from my hotel.  I had the ribs, asparagus and a side of the Brussel sprouts.  Their Brussel sprouts are really great and their ribs are consistently good.  The wait staff was very friendly and attentive.  Over all I had a great experience and I would recommend this BJ's location."
Ralston W.,"Chesterfield, VA",43,76,323,4.0,4/26/2016,"I came in earlier with a guest and it as around 11am. I like off peek hours as I can enjoy myself. It quickly got packed and my tranquil experience was bombarded with noise and happy conversation. The way a good place should be. Our server was very nice but the guy who brought out the food. My guess pointed out how sad he looked. I hope everything was alright but he was almost killing my noon day joy buzz. Place is clean, large. Great choices and did I say my weight staff was amazing. I can't remember her name but she was blonde, 5 6 or so tiny very polite. Thank you"
Helen G.,"Richmond, VA",0,22,1,3.0,5/21/2016,"Good food, really extensive menu, average beers, good ambiance, sub-par on cleanliness--silverware all dirty and lazy on the table wiping.... Go here instead of Friday's, but that's about all."
Dave W.,"Glen Allen, VA",0,17,,1.0,10/22/2016,Ok 2nd visit was worse than the first If you want beer and pizza I guess it's mediocre at best. All food cooked in pizza oven so never order anything but pizza  Fish in a pizza oven????  But even worse this time when they brought our appetizer they brought us DIRTY side plates!  Told manager who did nothing! Employee who brought dirty dishes to any table should have been terminated or at the very least reprimanded! So I question the whole management team and philosophy!   AND CLEANLINESS! This was my last visit!
Sara F.,"Mechanicsville, VA",29,9,55,3.0,5/25/2015,"I went here for lunch in the middle of a marathon shopping spree with my mother. I had the Crispy Jalapeno Burger and it was excellent. The burger was cooked medium as I asked, and the shoestring french fries were crispy. The burger had just enough of a kick to make it a touch spicy, but may be too spicy for people who don't like hot food, What troubles me was the way the beer was served. I ordered the porter, and the staff did not know how to pour it correctly. It was served to me with six inches of head on it and in the wrong type of glass. It baffles me to be a brewery when the staff doesn't understand the beer. After waiting for it to settle, the porter was good."
Grace K.,"Glen Allen, VA",0,6,3,4.0,11/15/2015,"My boyfriend and I decided to try this place out after hearing really good things about it. I didn't realize what type of restaurant it was; I thought it was just another Kickback Jacks/Applebee's type of place. I was very wrong.  BJs has a very diverse menu and offers quite different things from a typical American restaurant. It made it very unique. Their menu was like a novel. So much to try and it all looked delicious.  We went on a Friday Night so it was very very busy. We waited about 20 minutes for a table. They ask for your phone number so they can text you when your table is ready. Downside to this is there is not much wait space, but I mean most restaurants don't offer a big waiting area.  Got our table ordered drinks, all good. Our waitress was very very nice and fun to talk to. The kitchen was pretty backed up so we did have to wait around 30 minutes after we placed our order.  I got the chicken pita tacos, which are similar to a Greek gyro. They were awesome, but I believe that they forgot to put the sauce on. I was so hungry I scarfed them down before I made the connection there was no sauce.  My boyfriend got a pulled pork burger. He was unhappy with the small amount of pork on it, but he still said it was very good. The French fries were good, but very small and difficult to eat. They almost tasted like onion rings to me.  We then got a chocolate chip pizookie. Only complaint there is they did not put em out Pam spray on the tin; it was very difficult to scrap the bottom of the cookie off. Other than that it was delicious.  We were there for a little over an hour between waiting for food and our dessert. Prices are reasonable for what they offer. Will definitely be back."
Gladwin G.,"Mineola, NY",84,92,108,4.0,2/25/2015,Went here just for dessert. It was the cookie and ice cream on a skillet. It came out quick. The cookie was warm and the ice cream wasn't drippy. It was perfect.
Scottessa H.,"Richmond, VA",3,14,9,2.0,2/9/2017,"I brought some friends from out of town and we waited over an hour for the food. When my food arrived, it was luke warm at best. The waiter was wonderful and that is the only reason I am giving them 2 stars."
MaraLee L.,"Petersburg, VA",0,41,31,5.0,10/4/2015,"First time trying BJ's and it won't be the last! This place it great! Delicious food, great drinks, and friendly wait staff! We came in to try the Party for Two deal. So glad we did. The atmosphere in BJ's is great, very relaxing even when the big game is up. The happy hour deals and time is awesome. We got there right after the lunch crowd while the game was on and was surprised and happy to hear about the happy hour deals. Whilst we were enjoying our salad appetizers, Luke, the manager(?), came over to ask about our experience. After hearing it was our first time, he was happy to see what our tastes were in drinks and chose custom drinks to try. I tried the Berry Cider and it's my new favorite. My mom tried a drink recommended by Luke that mixed a light beer with the Berry cider, it was awesome. Now to the important aspect, the food. We each got a salad, which was a niiiice salad for a starter. Then the pizza came, a delicious deep dish ""Sweet Pig."" I can't believe how light and flavorful this pizza was. So good. But then dessert happened, and it only got better. We shared the Peanut Butter S'mores Pizookie. Om nom delicious!! All that said, I cannot wait to come back. I immediately joined the rewards club, so I can start getting some points. :D"
