Ruth R.,"Glen Allen, Richmond, VA",0,2,,1.0,1/27/2017,"TERRIBLE service the food took over 40 minutes and all I got from the manager was...she will talk to the kitchen staff..,not to mention the waitress disappeared and didn't see her while we waited or even after."
Hector R.,"Henrico, VA",8,65,62,2.0,1/10/2016,"We decided to give it a try again hoping the service changed. It didn't!  It was the same blah experience.  The wait staff looked like zombies walling around waiting to go home.  It took forever to get a beer.  But the reason they get a 2 star review is because the beer was cold and good.  The menu is the size of a bible and their food is not all that great.  It's over board!  Everything is to foofoo. Make beer, cut down the menu, give good service and create a better environment that makes people want to hangout"
Judy E.,"Virginia Beach, VA",0,10,,5.0,3/31/2017,Delicious!!! I have been here twice and I don't understand the 3 average. Got the flat bread nachos and the Brussels sprouts apps- amazing!! Blonde beer on tap - great! All entrees were salads and they were huge and delicious!  Service was great and THE PIZOOKIES WERE WONDERFUL!!! Great meal!
Rich G.,"Glen Allen, VA",5,226,5,4.0,12/30/2014,"We checked out the online menu and were lured in by the kids ribs selection for one of my kids.  When we arrived, we didn't see kids ribs on the menu so we inquired about it.  It turns out, they recently removed it from the menu. Luckily, the manager accommodated us anyway.  That was a good call. Great service.  Decent pub-style food.  Great beer selection.  Fun ambiance.  We'll be back. Update:  we've been back 4 or 5 times since the last review.  Food is around 3 stars, but I'm keeping the 4-star rating to reward the manager who made a good decision to accomodate us on our first dining experience there (see above)."
Eric G.,"Ashland, VA",5,13,62,4.0,10/19/2014,"New brew pub in Shortpump, pretty nice inside and good wait staff. Lots burgers and pizza to go with their long list of beer styles. They also have lots of other craft beers if you don't find one of theirs you like. The pumpkin, stout, and red are pretty solid. Try a Jerry Berry for a mix of their red ale and berry cider. Food is good as well here. Excellent burgers and lots of other dishes as well that I'm still trying. They have big dessert cookie pizzas too. Will be coming back here many times. Good lunch specials too."
Shauna H.,"Ellicott City, MD",218,14,4,5.0,6/29/2016,"My experience here was amazing. I find the staff to be caring, attentive, and accomodating. From the moment I entered the restaurant I was greeted with care (and a gluten-free menu which helps) and felt right at home even in a chain restaurant. I do not order salmon often while out because most people (especially in a more casual dining environment) over cook it, but not here! The salmon was cooked to perfection! The vegetables were fresh and the menu choices overall were plentiful. Definitely a place to satisfy a group of people. If you have a gluten sensitivity, you will be pleased with the selection they offer. Oh and dessert! You must get a pizookie! It is their version of a cookie sunday. They feature a seasonal flavor (when I was there it was lemon blueberry. It was AMAZING!) And they also have regular chocolate chip and a gluten free chocolate chip version as well. Since I was visiting another city - and I wanted to spread the love - I did not get to go back to BJ's but that was a hard decision every day. To the staff: Well done guys from beginning to end. To the readers: If you are in the Short Pump area, make sure you stop by. Bon Appétit!"
Judith A.,"Henrico, VA",0,9,,1.0,4/7/2017,"Just had their brisket burger with bison. The bison was a small patty seemed like it was a frozen patty and I only got three tiny pieces of brisket. Not worth the money. Oh did I say there was an upcharge for the bison. The waitress did not tell me that there would be a "" large"" upcharge. I could have purchased a whole separate burger for that price. This is my third time dining at this restaurant. I have not had one decent meal here. Three times their out! I would not recommend this restaurant."
Jonathan B.,"Walterboro, SC",55,3,1,1.0,8/4/2016,My chicken wings were raw and service was terrible. They didn't even take it off my bill. We will never go back.
Kayleigh V.,"Henrico, VA",0,9,,1.0,6/4/2016,"Gross.  The chicken is prepackaged and not cooked to order.  The majority of items on the menu come straight from the freezer.  Do yourself a favor and find a local restaurant with real, fresh food."
Danielle J.,"Chesterfield, VA",47,38,59,2.0,7/23/2016,"If you like beer this may be a good place but don't go for the service or the food. Went on Friday afternoon with two girlfriends. The place was not busy at all yet we barely saw our server. My friend finally got her to come by and asked for another beer and we waited at least 10 minutes for it to come. Calamari was what I expect from a chain restaurant and was so disappointed in my unseasoned and half cold fries. Sriracha Queso was pretty good when it was hot. My girlfriend did like her tavern pizza. If the service was good I may give it another try, but I won't be going back."
Joann R.,"Glen Allen, VA",1,41,,2.0,7/6/2016,"This was a mixed visit.  The seasonal salad was delish - loved the combination of flavors!  The calamari - which I chose to make as my entrée - not so good.  It was overcooked and some pieces burned.  I returned it because it was terrible.  The next batch was better than the first but overall flavorless and some pieces still overcooked, mostly the tenacle pieces.  The cocktail sauce had barely a hint of horseradish so I used the garlic aioli that was served with it.   On the plus side, I went when it wasn't busy so there was plenty of available parking.  The server was very friendly and checked in on me.  After you've returned a dish one time though, forget it, it's time to move on."
Jan M.,"Manhattan, NY",25,43,391,3.0,12/31/2015,"I would have given this 4 stars, but they took all of the good drinks off of the menu.  They used to have strawberry martinis like the Cheesecake Factory and an amazing lemon drop martini, but they have since been taken off the menu.  The stuffed mushrooms appetizer is really bland but must be a good dietary option.  The croutons tastes sweet like cookies...not a good match for a salad.  It's a decent spot for beers and they have a lot of TV's."
Lil D.,"Glen Allen, VA",6,29,63,5.0,10/13/2015,"We went to the bar after a Yelp event to try the pumpkin ale with Fireball whiskey - it's strong. The cinnamon on the rim was a delicious touch but be prepared for the sweet punch of the pumpkin ale/Fireball mix!  My DH tried the Pilsner Urquell on draft and thought it was okay.  I was a bit hungry so I ordered the BJ's signature deep dish, small, Mediterranean pizza (without chicken and peperoncini's since I'm vegetarian).  The combo of toppings was delicious and the deep dish crust is satisfying.  However, I don't care to bite into garlic so I wound up taking those out.  I would just order without them next time.  I would definitely try different pizzas when I return, since I'd been here several times before and had never tried them."
Ryan K.,"Baton Rouge, LA",3,21,,4.0,6/25/2016,"Nikki was wonderful.  She was very friendly and informative.  I love the Jeremiah Red.  It's one of my favorite brews.  Seemed a little off, but not bad.  Pizza was hot, fresh, and tasty.  Great visit to one of my favorite concepts."
SHERYL T.,"Mechanicsville, VA",1,4,,2.0,7/30/2016,"Went for dinner on Saturday, slow service,  hamburger burnt on the outside, Cobb salad no taste, good beer, would not go back."
Duy N.,"Richmond, VA",41,149,73,4.0,4/6/2015,"I'm going to be honest here.  I'm a huge fan of Pizza Hut.  Don't hate.  But I can't get enough of the crispy pan crust. With that out of the way, when we went to BJ's, I immediately went with BJ's Favorite deep dish pizza.  It is similar to Pizza Hut's supreme pizza. I have to say, BJ's crust is delicious! It has the same Pizza Hut style crisp but the toppings, especially the vegetables, were super fresh and tasty.  We also ordered the Santa Fe salad.  It was a big portion and plenty of chicken.  I loved both items and I can't wait to go back."
Lynda C.,"Richmond, VA",115,96,168,4.0,7/8/2015,"great place to hang out with friends!  big screen tvs, great theme going on! Food is really good!"
Alexis S.,"Richmond, VA",167,29,16,3.0,4/25/2016,I ordered the jambalaya but wasn't crazy about it. I really like the atmosphere and will return to try the burgers and drinks.
Christina O.,"Midlothian, VA",143,194,25,3.0,4/10/2015,"Nice restaurant.  Food was good. I ordered something...and the bf ordered something else (I really can't remember).  I know this doesn't help, but I will say that whatever we ordered was not great enough to remember but okay for the taste on that day.  I do remember the place and meal had a franchise feel and taste.  That's not a bad thing because I go to franchises, but if you'r looking for an RVA locale feel this may not be the best place to visit. Just saying. :)"
Victor F.,"Mineral, VA",26,2,3,4.0,12/12/2015,"Had a good experience. I got the Atlantic salmon and it was very good, they also do a beer sampler where you can try 4 different beers for a decent price. Great place for any occasion!"
