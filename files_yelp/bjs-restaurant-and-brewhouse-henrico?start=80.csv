Sandra F.,"Midlothian, VA",15,4,2,3.0,4/20/2016,"I saw pics of the deep dish pizza online & immediately had to try this spot! The ambience was really nice and cozy. The hostess greeted us right away & found us a comfy booth. The waitress came with menus right away & got us drinks! So far so good.. I order the deep dish pepperoni/spinach, cut into 6 slices vs 4 (I was told they were big) and an order of French fries with a side of ranch.. The food didn't take too long, I'll say 20 mins or so.. I was so hyped to try this & super hungry! My pizza was not hot/fresh, like at all.. I'm thinking a fresh pizza would have sizzling cheese, I would have to wait a minute for it to cool but no I was able to hold the slices as I attempted to cut them.. (Attempted, bc I only had a butter knife & it wasn't cut into 6 slices like I asked) finally took a bite & it was as if the pizza was made a bit ago, only luke warm. The French fries were the same but really taste old.. I asked for a fresh batch & a side of ranch that she forgot.. When the new order of fries got to me, I could tell they were fresh.. The grease was an obvious sign & I could feel the steam as I reached for them.. Unfortunately, they weren't all that good.. They taste like crispy air (over cooked).. No potato, just fried, crunchiness with no real taste without the ranch.. Very disappointing to say the least.. I didn't eat all of my food so I order dessert, which looked promising! I ordered the salted caramel pazookie (I believe that's how u spell it) it's basically a big cookie, with 2 scoops of ice cream, Carmel drizzle, chocolate chips sprinkles on top & a hand full of strawberries (I order those separately to add a little extra flavor) Let me tell you this was by far the best dessert.. I've had in a while! It was the right amount of crunch and softness.. It was delicious!! Presentation was great as well.. The dessert made up for everything else that wasn't right! It was so good & I was obviously enjoying it so much that the guys across from me, said they had to order the same! Lol My friend & I both order one, co spidering how sweet it was we really needed water! Our waitress seem to disappear after we got our food.. We needed refills before the dessert even got there but got distracted by the pazookie's that we didn't get to ask her before she slipped away.. I will definitely give this place another try to let them redeem themselves.. For now I will leave the 3 stars bc the dessert was yummy!"
Cade Y.,"Henrico, VA",0,11,,5.0,12/19/2016,"My girlfriend and I had never been here before and we had gotten an early Christmas gift card to go here so we figured why not? We headed in early Sunday afternoon and were greeted by a super cheerful bartender named Cassie. She gave us a run down on the history, food they are known for and offered suggestions. Already loved the place based off of her alone. The second bartender for the night was Maggie and when she came over she gave us an awesome description of the beers and let us try a few. I hate beer, I have literally never liked it, but somehow Maggie found an amazing beer that BJ""s actually makes themselves. (Golden something or another, wheat beer) We had such an awesome Sunday dinner and will definitely be back to see Cassie and Maggie again soon, probably next weekend!"
Kathleen M.,"Glen Allen, Richmond, VA",17,1,,3.0,6/19/2016,"Waited for 20 to 30 minutes which was fine as we got here right at 6:30.  Server was prompt and courteous.  Husband ordered a burger which he really enjoyed and was huge.  My Ahi Tuna salad was disappointing.  Salad seemed like it had been sitting in dressing for a while, there was a random piece of mozzarella in my salad and tuna was not presented neatly (I.e. It looked more mangled than not)."
Shari S.,"Capitola, CA",62,148,64,2.0,1/19/2015,"First of all, my review was originally a one star, but I'm giving it a second star, since after I responded to their post-dining survey, I was promptly contacted by a manager, asking how they could improve. Hopefully that desire to do better will mean that they're just experiencing growing pains. A few key points that made our experience less than enjoyable: *We utilized the Preferred Waitlist option, but that was a total fail. The hostess really couldn't provide an explanation. *We utilized the Order Ahead option so we'd have appetizers waiting for us. Unfortunately, this was a fail as well -- and our server didn't even seem to know what it was about. *My husband ordered a beer as soon as we sat down. After quite some time, he was told that the beer had ""just run out"" and they were too busy to tap a new keg. *While the avocado egg rolls were great, the dipping sauce with them tasted horrible -- as if it had been boiled so long that the pot burned. We advised our waitress that it tasted so off that they might want to address it in the kitchen before they served it to anyone else, and she said she'd have a manager come out, but that didn't happen. *While the fried appetizers & entrees, as well as the pizza, were tasty, the Santa Fe Salad was jsut blah. And I requested more dressing, in case they accidentally used ranch rather than Santa Fe dressing... but that never came either. Overall, the decor is very appealing, and some of the food was tasty, but in an area like Richmond, and especially with the large variety of restaurants in Short Pump, you must do a lot better than just good in order to succeed. Hopefully these are just new restaurant growing pains that will improve with time."
Emme P.,"Mechanicsville, VA",2,10,,4.0,6/10/2016,"Had really tasty guacamole and beer. A bit pricey, but good. Would have scored higher if it wasn't for the piece of avocado skin we found in our 2nd bowl of guacamole. Nice and clean and good service overall."
Rob C.,"Virginia Beach, VA",0,33,1,4.0,7/1/2015,My wife and I love this place. We drive from Charlottesville and the food is great. I wish they had a little bit more training for the staff but it is really hard to find people that want to work. If the service is real good I will tip 30 to 40 percent. The restaurant is clean and has an open floor plan.
Tara S.,"Richmond, VA",81,173,18,2.0,1/19/2015,"Food is still great but the service still blows.   We came in around 2ish on Saturday and got seated at a handicapped table.  There were other tables around so I really don't understand this.  and of course, while we were sitting there, a family with a member in a wheel chair came in, and had to wait for a different table to open up.   So while we were seated, it took 10 minuets for a server to come over.  Seriously the couple that came in after us had drinks and already made their entree order before we were acknowledged.   We were able to make our drink and entree order by the time our server came.  Once that happened, everything was ok.  We decided to try their sodas.  I had the rootbeer and the hubs had the cream soda.  Both were amazing.  For lunch, he had the brewhouse burger and I had the grilled mahi taco.  we both enjoyed our entrees.  I just do not understand how I get the short end of the stick when it comes to service at this place!"
A T.,"Williamsburg, VA",0,66,3,3.0,11/25/2016,I love the specially beers that they make at BJ's. They have about nine different varieties all which are high-quality. The food is definitely good and the menu is quite large. Price point is also very good. This is a great place for family get together's.
Foodierva F.,"Chester, VA",0,18,,1.0,5/27/2016,"First time & last time too. Service was below average just like their food. Only good thing was the beer, but there are better places with a nicer atmosphere for that. It is also way too expensive for what you get. Should have read prior reviews before trying this place."
Rosetta D.,"Henrico, VA",127,16,9,4.0,10/12/2015,"First Time at BJ's and I had a excellent time. The meal was excellent, the customer service was excellent and  most of all the food was great. Ask for Amanda I promise  she will make your service worth wild!"
Beckey R.,"Henrico, VA",25,5,,2.0,12/1/2014,We ate here on Wednesday the 26th.  It was the day before Thanksgiving but at 1 pm they were not all that busy.   The food was so-so.  I ordered the lemon thyme chicken.   The chicken was cooked well but the roasted vegetables just tasted burnt and over salted.  My brother ordered the bbq platter.  For the price it was a disappointment.   My daughter had the mini corn dogs but when she asked for fruit and fries I had to convince the waiter I'd pay the extra.  Now for service. .. we made the mistake of saying we needed a few minutes to look at the menu.   Took forever for the waiter to come back.   After we finally got our order in it was close to 30 min before we got our food and it was luke warm.   We had coffee to drink as it was lunch but our neighbors with beer and wine got much more attention than we did. With so much competition in the area we won't be back.
Citizen J.,"Mesa, AZ",0,19,5,4.0,5/23/2016,Fantastic tuna lunch dish with quinoa.  The waiter was pleasant and accommodating.  Excellent beer as well. Great decor and professional staff. Food preparation was adequate and accurate.
Raymond B.,"Richmond, VA",71,7,,4.0,1/9/2015,"I love the BJ's in Northern Virginia. This new location in Short Pump appears to be working out their service kinks. Food is great (as long as you order the right menu items as their vast menu which is 70% delicious, 20% so-so, 10% should be omitted altogether). Their pizza is pretty good as long as your like bready thick crusts/dough, but I prefer their tacos. Their wings are great (not breaded whew!) and we like to finish dinner with their pizzookie desserts which are simple, sweet, hot, and a la mode! I think they need a few months of service staff turnover to weed out the bad servers and as long as their service managers properly walk the tables, check-in with tables, expedite the food properly in the window, and stay on top of order/wait times per table after seating. Cross your fingers - we can all hope that the service gets to where it should be so Richmond can truly experience this restaurant at it's best!"
Bbq S.,"Scottsville, VA",524,166,347,2.0,11/19/2014,"Ok , another brew house in Richmond . I get it ! It's the new trendy thing. So I guess I give it a try! The day I showed up must have been the soft opening day . It was a bit over whelming ! I had literally 20 people asking me could they help me and four people trying to get my plate! Omg!  Now for the food ! French fries were good , but the $12.00 for the 5 oz horrible hamburger was a little too much . Cmon , a 5 oz burger, I could have gotten at least 5 burgers from mcdees for less ! And much better ! I asked for medium rare and it came well done ! This place is a bar not a restaurant .  Ok for the beer! It's ok ! I had the light beer and it was ok !  Again , bar not restauraunt! Very over priced !  The two stars are for the beer and great fries !"
Rudy C.,"Glen Allen, VA",0,5,,5.0,3/28/2016,Excellent service. Great food.Great prices. Roasted Brussel Sprouts out of this world. Awesome atmosphere. My family and I come frequently and we have never had a bad experience. We have never had any bad meals. The beer selection is awesome and on Tuesday's is wine night.
Taylor S.,"Richmond, VA",51,120,3,4.0,10/14/2014,"This place is brand new and I'm excited I stopped in. They specialize in pizza and beer, so pretty much guy heaven or if you're like me and love pizza. My brother got their stout and I got a glass of their berry cider. Their cider was amazing! I will definitely go back just for that. The good thing is, that you can try any of their beers before you commit to a full glass.  I came here with my family and we ordered some of their bbq wings and a pepperoni pizza. Their pizzas are all dip dish style. The pizza was eh. My dad and I wished it had more sauce just to try and be a little more deep dish style."
Steve K.,"Richmond, VA",0,11,10,4.0,2/23/2016,The chicken Mediterranean tacos were outstanding! I had a Stout  / Jeremiah Red mix ....fantastic ! Our server was professional and really knew his beers. Great night. I will definitely be back.
Pablo W.,"Henrico, VA",0,4,1,1.0,11/8/2015,"English   I will never return to this place.  I really DO NOT reccomend it.  I had a horrible experience this Saturday 11/7 at 9:30 pm and it was the first time I had ever been there.  I asked for a beer without foam and when the bartender served it the beer had a lot of foam.  It settled and was filled to about an inch below the rim of the glass. When I ask the girl who ran the beer to my table if they could fill it up a little more she walked off with a horrible attitude and and the bartender whose name was ""Christian""  just let the glass sit there for a minute and then stuck a straw in it and stirred it around to create a foam that reached up to the rim of the glass. They brought it to the table with a rather horrible attitude.  Our waitress came back after this ordeal and asked if everything was ok, I commented what had happened and that I had seen everything unfold and that the problem was still not fixed.  She went to go talk to the bertender ""christian"" and he served me another glass with the same problem.  I accepted the glass even though I wasn't satisfied but the waitress insisted on resolving the problem and went to talk to the bartender.  He just ignored her and turned around to look at me with a nasty attitude while he and a different waitress ( a tall girl with black hair who was working in the bar area that night) laughed about the situation.  I thought that the bartender would have just fixed that problem seeing that all he had to do was put a little more beer in the glass but instead he chose to ignore his coworker, who was trying to fix the problem.  It really bothered me how he treated and ignored our waitress and his attitude he got with me looking at me as if he was challenging me. The beer cost 6.50$ for a pint and that's not cheap.  I asked for it without a lot of foam and  don't feel like that is an unreasonable request.  The bartender just didn't feel like pouring a decent glass of beer and chose to treat his coworkers and clients badly instead.  As for the food, the hamburger cost 12 dollars. The french fries reminded me of Burger King and the jalapeño burger was not spicy or anything as the menu said it would be. But these are personal tastes and maybe another person would like the food.   The attitude of the bartender CHRISTIAN makes me NEVER want to go back.  I do not recommend going to a place where they can't even serve a decent beer and they ignore your waitress when she tries to fix the problem and then laugh at you with the other waitresses. Our witress who was a blond was very nice and helpful, she was tryign to fix my problem with my drink and I appreciate that. The bartender and the other waitress who was working the tables near her were the ones that ruined the whole experience at BJ's.   I will never go back because of that bartender.   Instead of just topping off a beer he decided to let his pride get the best of him and he lost a customer and I will never recommend this place to anyone. I saw the whole situation happen right before my eyes and it really bothered me how he treated our waitress and his customers. SPANISH  No voy a volver nunca mas a este lugar. Realmente no lo recomiendo. Tuve una mala experiencia ayer sabado 7/11 a las 9:30,  y era la primera vez que iba. Pedí cerveza sin espuma pero me la sirvieron con espuma y bastante, pero cuando la espuma se fue quedaba como un dedo y medio sin cerveza, cuando le dije esto a la mesera se la llevo al  bartender llamado ""Chris"" y este dejo que el vaso se quedara allí y luego metió una pajita y la revolvió para ponerle espuma, lo sé porque lo estaba mirando. Pero mi pedido era sin espuma a vaso lleno. Cuando la mesera me pregunto si estaba todo bien , le conté lo que habia visto y que el problema no estaba resuelto. Ella fue a hablar con el bar tender, me sirvieron otro vaso y estaba el mismo problema, yo no estuve muy satisfecho pero habia aceptado tomar el vaso así pero  la mesera  insistió en resolver el problema entonces fue a hablar con el bartender y este  la ignoro dejo el vaso allí y luego el bar tender me miraba con actitud desafiante mientras se reía con otra mesera de pelo negro y alta, yo pensé que el bartender iba a resolver el inconveniente pero no lo hizo sino que ignoro a su compañera.  Me molesto mucho como él trato a la mesera ya que ella trato de resolver el incoveniente y su actitud desafiante al mirarme. El vaso costaba 6,50 USD, no era nada barato, entonces pedí lo que era justo.  Me dejaron con el vaso que me habian traido que no cumplia con lo que pedí  y NO lograron resolver el problema por que el bartender NO tuvo las ganas de hacerlo.        En cuanto a la comida, pedí una hamburguesa . Me costo 12 USD, la verdad que las papas parecian de Burger King, y no era nada picante la hamburgesa, como decia. Pero estos son gustos y seguro tendran otra experiencia. Pero la actitud del bartender hacen que NO me den ganas de volver nunca mas a este lugar ,y no recomendar este lugar, el tuvo orgullo.."
Hannah E.,"Sterling, VA",353,143,1343,2.0,11/11/2014,"First time at BJ's with my bestie from Northern VA. She goes frequently with her work friends, and suggested we try the Short Pump location. The atmosphere is not bad, pretty  busy for a Monday night around 9. The stuffed mushrooms were ok, they seemed a little undercooked. I then ordered the Fried Chicken with no gravy or succotash and subbed in roasted asparagus instead. The chicken was mediocre at best, not horrible, not delicious. The mashed potatoes-white cheddar -were the best part.Both me and my best friend ordered the roasted asparagus, but it was so bad, we  requested subs-I got the seasonal vegetables-overly blanched and a little strange smelling mix of cauliflower, carrots, broccoli and snap peas.My friend got the fries, which were pretty tasty.Overall, I can see myself returning but ordering completely different. Afterall the waitress did tell us ""We're known for our Pizza , burgers and beer"" which I failed to order any of those."
Viveca W.,"Midlothian, VA",0,37,33,4.0,3/7/2016,Food was really good.  Both the deep dish pizza and the thin crust tavern pizzas are very good.  Very big menu of many dinner entrées.  Thought prices were a little expensive.  Basic burgers starts at $10 and medium deep dish pizzas $20+.
