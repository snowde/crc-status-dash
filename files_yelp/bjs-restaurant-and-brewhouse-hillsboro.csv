Alex B.,"Portland, OR",12,143,331,4.0,11/3/2017,"Clam chowder: horrid!! Less than 1 star. Chicken tortilla soup: I hear it was much better.  Bone in wings I hear are much better than boneless. Got half BBQ and half Buffalo. BBQ was so much better!! 4.5 stars for them.  Tumeric cauliflower: good! But oily Pizookie trio: freshly baked warm cookie with heaping scoop of cold ice cream. Great combo but sugar overload!  Salted caramel - it's OK. Not the greatest. Not too much salty flavor and tastes like there's nuts in the cookie  Triple chocolate (ghirardelli) - super rich but good!  White chocolate macadamia nut - nope nope nope! Tastes like lemon  Wish they had a snicker doodle flavor.  Staff was extremely friendly, attentive and helpful! Overall I'd give this place 3.75-4/5"
Jose I.,"Dixon, CA",1,29,2,1.0,9/18/2017,"Well, I guess I was a BJs fan until last Friday night.  I took my family for a late dinner, the waitress greeted us, brought four utensil sets, and for our unpleasant surprise two forks were completely disgusting. One of the forks had food stains on over 50% of its surface.  The second had a 1/2-inch piece of onion stuck on it.  As you can imagine, I talked to the waitress right away (I think his name is Lance).  I asked to talk to the manager and kitchen staff.  However, more unpleasant was the fact we didn't get an apology from the waitress, neither the manager came to talk to us as we were expecting.  I said to myself, at least there is going to be a ""one dessert on the house"".  Guess what?  Not even that. As for me and my family, BJ's was on the top until last Friday night.  not anymore.  Still today (2 days later) my wife feels sick every time she remembers those shitty utensils. Knowing that BJ's doesn't care about hygiene and customer care, my advise to you is to take a good look to your utensils before taking them into your mouth."
Jessica B.,"Hillsboro, OR",135,132,116,4.0,8/20/2017,"Excellent customer service. Our hostess was so kind and apologized for keeping us waiting even though our wait wasn't bad at all.  Our server, Jeff, was a superstar! Management, if you are reading this, please give Jeff the recognition he deserves! The ticket for our two pizooki trio orders got lost and Jeff well made up for the delay. Thank you!! I had to take a star off because they changed their French fries. They used to have these delightfully delectable skinny fries and now they're bigger and don't taste as good."
Lisa B.,"Hillsboro, OR",25,20,3,3.0,1/6/2018,"The restaurant redeemed themselves by giving me a full refund and a bit extra. I gave them another try and my son's burger was done this time but still greasy. I ordered a wedge salad and that was thrown in a container, breadsticks were good, but my favorite was the couscous Mac n cheese. I don't think I will eat there again though because it's just to expensive for average food."
Swepna M.,"Portland, OR",50,59,111,4.0,4/23/2017,"I'm a big fan of BJ's and go there frequently for good food and desserts !  We went to BJ's with a group of 4 people for a dinner to hang out for birthday celebrations. Surprisingly, we were seated immediately with no wait time during peak time around 7pm.  The waiter for some reason was very hostile and unfriendly which we were really unhappy about.  Ordered these dishes: Entrees: * Crispy jalapeno burger - Pretty awesome, this is one of my all time favorite veggie dish at BJ's. I pretty much order this on all my visits here. I enjoyed the burger which came with crispy jalapenos and black bean patty which was simply delicious as always. Even my other friends liked it over their food. * Italiano vegetable penne - Decent, my friend like it.. Tried it for the first time. * Italiano vegetable penne with alfredo sauce - Decent, my friend like it.. Tried it for the first time with alfredo sauce.. Someone with love for cheesy sauce may like it i guess.  * Classic burger with chicken patty - Good, though my friend preferred the crispy jalapeno version. Dessert: * White chocolate macadamia nut pizookie - Awesome, mouth watering as usual. It was gone in no time - warm cookie with ok vanilla icecream on top. Wish they had served thicker cookie to go with the icecream.  Overall we had good experience, consistent taste except for the service. I wish waiter hadn't treated us in an unpleasant manner."
Pamela B.,"Hillsboro, OR",31,14,6,3.0,11/22/2017,Brown celery served with Memphis wings.  This restaurant is unpredictable in its food quality.  My last visit I was served something different than what I ordered.   The staff is wonderful.  The beer is enjoyable.  The venue is nice.  I am cheering you on to improve the food standards.
Elizabeth D.,"Portland, OR",21,106,29,1.0,12/15/2016,"BJ's was always a guilty pleasure of mine. Sure, it's a modern version of Applebee's, but their enlightened menu is tasty and great for when I'm on a diet fad. This weekend, my husband and I decided to grab curbside take-out because it was too cold to bother getting dressed. They got our order correct and it was out timely, but it went horribly awry half way though the meal. The major issue with my meal is that we received a rather unexpected Surf N' Turf entree. To clarify, we ordered their crispy jalapeño burger. It included some awesome fixins' like fried jalapeños, Chipotle mayo, and pepper jack. Halfway through the burger, and my husband spit out a goopy pink shrimp. It was inside one of the jalapeño bites. Shrimp makes us both completely sick to our stomach, so meal ruined right there. That's not the big problem though. The problem is in their food prep; I cannot fathom how that shrimp got inside the jalapeño popper in the first place. Either they are storing their food terribly or just not paying attention at all during prep. As someone with food allergies, the concern for cross-contamination is too great to continue eating here."
Anthony K.,"Portland, OR",135,413,32,5.0,12/10/2017,"My review has 5 stars because of our server Stephanie.  The menu was huge, the food was good, but the service was outstanding.  She was by far the best server we have experienced in a long time.  This was our first time and we would come back and absolutely request to sit in her section.  My wife had the yakisoba dish which was good. I had the jalapeno burger.  The kids ordered some stuff from the kids menu, which had tons of options.  For starters we had the cheese sticks and sprouts.  The cheese sticks were so-so, but I would recommend the sprouts."
Ranjana S.,"Portland, OR",28,67,64,3.0,12/29/2016,"We go to bj's  when there is bogo offer( buy one entree get one free) , pretty good deal. My hubby ordered jambalaya and I got chicken sandwich . Both tasted good but not so awesome . Their tortilla soup was very very salty. Will go again when they offer bogo again. Sign up to get one."
Gunner J.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,39,21,1.0,12/8/2017,Hostess was completely unwilling to accommodate our group. There were several open tables that could have worked for us to sit at.... she wasn't very nice and tried to tell us we would have to sit separately or wait over an hour. We were never told why we couldn't easily merge two center tables when the people next to them had done it. Terrible terrible customer experience! I love BJ's but I will NOT be returning to this location.
Christina B.,"Hillsboro, OR",0,16,8,5.0,10/8/2017,"Went for brunch this morning! It was so quiet and empty, staff was attentive and food was absolutely delicious. Definitely a new favorite for brunch, affordable as well, and you can't beat $4.00 mimosas!"
Cara B.,"Hillsboro, OR",3,63,13,3.0,11/19/2017,"Just over a year later from a bad experience I finally felt ready to give this place a try. I am happy to report that this time the host desk was staffed. We were greeted and seated in a timely fashion.  The place had a very nice laid back feel. Lighting was low and plenty of football games were spattered around the edges of the restaurant. The menu was pretty large, and I ended up ordering the chicken club sandwich with fries.  The food was average chain food. I wouldn't order that item again. The fries were crispy and hot. The service was good. There isn't really anything about the place making me want to run back and eat there again, but it's handy to have a generic place to go when you don't want to decide."
Ivy L.,"Hillsboro, OR",24,11,8,1.0,9/12/2017,"Service was superslow, order got mixed up, the bill got mixed up. The tues pizookie special is a scam, it was thebmini pizookie, not the regular pizookie, i felt cheated..."
Mark S.,"Kirkland, WA",0,2,,4.0,12/9/2017,Friendly service and food was better then I expected.  I sat at the bar and it was slightly slower then I expected so I docked the place 1 star but over all it was great.  I recommend the flatbread pizzas!
Kelly M.,"Hillsboro, OR",2,26,2,4.0,12/29/2017,"Food is really good, the menu is quite large but we haven't found anything that hasn't been fresh & delicious. A few of our favorites: the deep dish pizza, any of the burgers (so juicy!), and the pazookie. My personal faves are the monkey bread and the white chocolate macadamia."
Matt V.,"Beaverton, OR",0,14,,3.0,11/30/2017,We stopped by BJ's for a quick dinner.  My wife had the prime rib dip and it really wasn't that great.  The meat didn't really look or taste like prime rib.  It was very overcooked and salty.  I had the chicken melt sandwich and it was really good.  The bread was grilled crispy and the avocado was fresh.  I also enjoyed my peach infused iced tea.  This isn't the first time we've been here and we will be back.  My wife just probably won't order the prime rib dip sandwich again.
Dharminder S.,"Happy Valley, OR",107,80,106,4.0,3/5/2017,I love this place when I comes to pizza. I haven't had their happy hour food or drink so I can't say much about that. The one thing that I wish they would fix is their pizzas are slightly greasy. But it's worth it at the end because it taste amazing. Customer service is good and parking is good in overall atmosphere is pretty good.
Brittany H.,"Newberg, OR",4,222,5,2.0,1/4/2017,"My mom took here for lunch one day. The place had a nice feel inside and was really clean. However I needed a flash light to read the menu. Where we were had no light above us and what lighting was around was further away and dimmed a lot.  The menu has a vareity of soups, salads, pizza, sandwiches, steaks and a ton more. Honestly TO MANY CHOICES. The menu was extremely thick and took us about 10-15 minutes to get through. Side note they offer carbonated water with a hint of flavor which was neat and they were bottomless.  I ordered a salad which was like $12.50.. I think it was a little spendy for a salad. When I got the salad the size was fine and they had put a fair amount of chicken on it. Other then that the salad was disappointing. They use iceberg lettuce is a little hint of romaine... I was hoping it would be mostly romaine or something. I didn't really feel like the salad was worth $12.50. Our service was great though. Our waitress made sure our drinks were never empty and check on us multiple times.   Overall this isn't a place I would choose to go to dinner. If I was invited I would attend and just try something other then the salads."
Sharon N.,"Hillsboro, OR",4,45,18,5.0,7/1/2017,"If you want a truly spectacular pizza, order the BJ's Favorite,  extra sauce, extra cheese & if you like a little kick, order it with jalapeños.     Don't forget to sprinkle with parmesan & red pepper flakes.  My favorite beer is the Jeremiah Red, the two go great together."
J G.,"Norfolk, MA",85,37,15,4.0,7/10/2017,"The staff were professional & personable, the deep dish pizza was delicious, they have a great selection of draught beers. The entrance wasn't obvious, but no big deal. If I could give a 4.5 rating, I would. My only issues we're that the pizza could use a bit more toppings and their house beer was kinda meh but, as I wrote, the selection did not leave me wanting."
Angela M.,"Hillsboro, OR",239,35,39,2.0,9/27/2017,"Happy hour not anything to write home about, I mean if your in the area and it's happy hour go next store to Copper River"
Elle H.,"Beaverton, OR",0,17,,1.0,10/30/2017,Ordered online for delivery.   Everything was heavily salted to the point where I had to RINSE MY STEAK Off!!  Artichokes also very salty.   Whoever they have cooking has a very heavy hand with the salt shaker.  Had I been dining in and received this order it would have been sent back.  There is no excuse for over salting.   We all are able to add additional salt if our taste buds desire it.   I actually salt home cooked food I prepare but never like this.  Complete waste of my money.
Morissa P.,"Hillsboro, OR",53,122,22,2.0,6/28/2017,"So they switched from their awesome shoestring fries to these greasy, salty, tasteless, limp fake potatoes. GROSS!! If they don't bring back the old fries I'm reluctant to go back."
Dawn N.,"Hillsboro, OR",0,2,3,1.0,10/15/2017,"Have been here 2 times- the first time when I asked for a med rare I got almost raw. The second time I went was last 10-14-2017 at around midnight.  Worst cook probably I've ever had. My husband and I ordered the same thing and steaks cooked the same way, Medium. Our steaks came and his was perfect and mine was like a leather shoe that was so salty I took two bites and left the rest. Also a huge huge no no you do not do when serving fresh green beans is leave on the stems. So yes the stems were left on the green beans to take off my self, disgusting. The sides of couscous Mac and his potatoes where ok. We also ordered the siracha Brussels and they were so over chard we only ate a few. So disipointed and will find a new steak house in the area or drive to Portland for a good steak. They need to get some better cooks in this place and start from scratch. Almost forgot, when I asked about the stems on the green beans, I was told that is the new norm there. All I could do was laugh.  I can say the server was polite and did take one meal off . I tipped the price of the meal."
Satinderjit H.,"Beaverton, OR",0,3,,2.0,12/9/2017,"Its my favorite place to drink and dine since many years. Though i like the food, the beer selection and the ambiance but since few months the customer service really got bad,when you go  no body care to ask you what you need or water even.I tried telling the mangers but its in vain, it happened 5-6   now i stopped going there."
Joey C.,"Vancouver, WA",64,4,2,4.0,10/13/2017,Awesome place to hang out to have a beer and enjoy great food with awesome customer service.
Jessie H.,"Hillsboro, OR",111,14,,5.0,6/14/2017,"K... Another 3 star restaurant that I think deserves a 5 star. How BJs got 3 stars I will never understand. I just got back from a lunch I took my suppliers (visiting from Hong Kong) to, and they had nothing but good things to say about BJs.  I LOVE this restaurant. I love everything about it, especially the gluten free options. I have tried every pizza option they have (with gluten free crust), and it is the best - seriously the best gluten free pizza I have ever had. Which is saying a lot, because I am very picky with gluten free foods. I will not spend $15.00 on a pizza if I am unsure about the gluten free crust.  ALSO, they have a gluten free pizookie...... They are literally to die for. They only offer gluten free for the chocolate chip cookie option, but it is way way WAY better than anything you have ever tasted. I mean seriously, a gluten free (definitely does NOT taste like gluten free), warm cookie platter topped with a few scoops of vanilla bean ice cream. It is heaven on a plate. Trust me, visit BJs - you will NOT be disappointed."
Michael H.,"Hillsboro, OR",0,3,5,2.0,1/29/2017,"We decided to dine in for lunch on our visit.   It was around 1pm on a Friday. Not surprisingly they were quite busy.  There was no wait for a table. We did notice quite a large party in their side room.  Our server was very pleasant. She was knowledgeable and even did her due diligence when it came to ""upselling"" and guiding us through the menu. With over 100+ menu items on the menu it can be overwhelming. If not slightly on the ridiculous side. To some people that many items can be overwhelming. Our order was placed quickly and with the new tablets that the servers carry around, it seemed efficiently. She even offered to sign us up for the rewards program.  Our appetisers were delivered by a woman who we assume was a good runner and not a server. She dropped our salsa verde ""queso"" dip on the table with enough force that some of the chips fell off of the plate. I tried to grab her attention and say thank you. But she ignored us and walked away.  We informed the server of our displeasure of the food runners attitude and service. She followed most industry standard protocol. She apologised and asked to rectify it. The food runner did not drop of our entrees.  The food was okay. The bread bowl for the soup was slightly under done.  The roasted chicken and quinoa was made fantastically.  The server did have an issue that was NOT her fault. She had a party of what was ~12 people. Then that same party turned into ~18. I felt sorry that this party now started to consume her. Our drinks laid empty for quite sometime due to this party. Instead of her co-workers helping her out, they walked blindly past and were only concerned with checking their cellphones they tried to keep hidden from management.  When the server finally came back by she apologised for the long interval between checking back. She mad us another round of beverages, and offered the check.  She did offer dessert, none by name.  We waited nearly 10 minutes for the check to be brought to us.  And yes we did time it just to see.  With the tablets that the server was carrying the payment was processed almost instantly. That was a positive since most guests at lunch are in a hurry.  All in all I give it 2 out of 5 stars. The server was great, but was put into a bad position with the party that expanded without notice. The other team members were definitely less than stellar. The food was average. The queso dip was grainy and not very good. It was seemed as if there was a stepped skipped during preparation that made the cheese not melt properly.  Best wishes to you in the future."
Toni B.,"Beaverton, OR",1,23,,4.0,9/30/2017,"Our ongoing saga of having no kitchen has us going to restaurants we don't normally go to, we decided to try BJ's.  The first thing I noticed is ladies be careful, the wooden floor is lethal, it is so slippery.  Our server, Angel, was really nice, so friendly and helpful.  We got a little carried away with our order, mozzarella sticks, wings and potato skins (why don't more places do skins, I love skins?). All were really good, it tasted like real home made food.  The boys ordered ribs, I ordered Sirloin and the adult child ordered Alfredo.  The ribs were pretty good, the Alfredo was excellent and the steak was not good, way too much flavour rub and over cooked so it ended up being way too chewy.  We were so full it was kind of ridiculous.  On the whole it was a good experience, next time I will order something else."
Chelsea C.,"Portland, OR",9,2,3,5.0,6/11/2017,My fiancé and I decided to go out instead of cooking tonight. We both work a lot so we wanted the night off. Our server (KAREN G) was awesome!!! Nicest server we have had in a long time. We will come back and be sure to ask for her. Management should be likely to have such a great employee  KAREN G: Thanks girl for helping us out and even though your tired you took great care of us!! We totally appreciate it. We will be back to see you soon.  -Chelsea + Nic
Devinnie F.,"Portland, OR",6,31,7,4.0,9/9/2017,"Food is pretty good,service is always great in this place..the pizza is delicious!!Also if you like alcoholic beverages they have some of the best I've had!"
Andrew M.,"Beaverton, OR",146,53,81,1.0,3/4/2017,"Frustrated and Embarrassed! Had family from out of town and called ahead for seating. Was told ""there is no wait but i put your name on the list so you will be at the top."" Person even asked about children's seats and said everything would be ""ready."" After trucking through the rain with a newborn and two year old we were told at the desk that we have 30 minute wait!! After explaining to them about call ahead they were not compassionate basically said we would be waiting. We left! We love BJs but if they can't accommodate I would appreciate honesty or at least someone's apology. Mostly embarrassed that our family had a bad experience at the restaurant we talked up so much. Had to eat at a pizza place near by."
Betsy R.,"West Salem, Salem, OR",0,3,1,5.0,5/19/2017,"Excellent service and excellent cosmo! Friendly and quick but only had a hundred dollar bill and got change back in all 5's. It doesn't fit in my little purse so I had to put sundry in pocket. Oh well, bigger purse next time just in case."
Kim H.,"Portland, OR",0,3,,1.0,11/5/2017,"The worst breakfast! Cold food, uncooked bacon and dirty silverware. Don't go there for breakfast!! The waitstaff was nice!"
Kassandra A.,"Hillsboro, OR",307,211,576,4.0,7/11/2016,"Soooo I haven't been to a BJ's restaurant in a while, and I'm so glad I came here with family.  It was a usual semi busy kind of weekday night.  We were greeted immediately upon entering and seating immediately thereafter.  Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu items and was very patient.  So I decided to try the Portabelo burger and wow! A full burger, with a full big cap of Portabelo mushroom, arugula, Swiss, tomato, and grilled onion! O could barely even keep it together, lol.  I had to use a knife and fork to eat this in sections.  I also had their verso. Of a cap rear salad.  It was so, so.  Loved their potato wedges in comparison to their strong crispy fries.  But I had a great experience overall."
S C.,"Beaverton, OR",0,8,2,1.0,11/5/2017,"I used to come here all the time for the convenience (open late, close to my workplace, decent variety of menu items), but after our last encounter, I don't think I'll be back to this location.  My boyfriend and I arrived late in the evening and the place was pretty empty - we asked for a booth and the host said, ""how about at the bar instead?"".  No thank you, a booth please - just a little more personal and not as bright lighting.  He says, ""well why not the bar? You don't have to drink or anything, you just have to sit there.""  We said again, ""no, a booth, please."" The host then waves his arms around and says ""okay, whatever, I'm not going to argue with you""  and proceeds to seat us at the most unnecessarily large booth ever, when there were plenty of little booths open and other couples sitting at them.  Our server later came over and asked us why we were seated there, because the section was supposed to be closed.  We told him that the host seated us here and we felt like he did it just to be a jerk, to be honest (oh, you want a booth so bad? I'll show you a booth! Here's a booth to fit 10 people!).  He apologized profusely and said he would speak to our host.  Normal dinner after that, but honestly absolutely the worst encounter I've ever had at a restaurant - so blatantly rude."
Blnde842 L.,"Lake Oswego, OR",11,215,28,4.0,1/4/2017,"I love this location. I've come here enough times to finally have a solid review. I've had quite a few things off this menu, queso, bread bowls(broc ched is my go to) few wings/sauce, flat bread pizza(gf) and the street tacos and I can honestly say for a chain restaurant you get a little more than you pay for which is AWESOME! A girl friend and I come in every couple of weeks and always get a few things to try. The service is pretty great, Craig in the bar is our fav when we come in at night after a long day. This location I enjoy more than the jantzen beach location primarily because of the set up and how much larger this location is(service and food is still great at jantzen beach location as well)  Thank you !!!!!!"
Alex G.,"San Jose, CA",0,16,2,3.0,8/17/2017,I've been here a couple of times while on vacation. i walk in and there's some people in their but not busy at all. I've had to wait 20 mins for a table. then the service is just OK.
Josh B.,"Eatontown, NJ",74,1,,2.0,7/25/2017,"I've been here three times now. I sat at the bar, so I can't really comment on the service. The food however is another story. It can only be described as mediocre at best. I had a deep dish pizza that could have easily been mistaken for something out of a supermarket freezer aisle. I also once had a fried chicken sandwich which was supposed to come with a honey mustard sauce, but was served to me completely dry. I don't doubt that the beer is okay, but the food leaves a lot to be desired."
Abigail M.,"Hillsboro, OR",33,24,2,1.0,10/8/2016,"We have been coming to BJ's since it opened and the service and quality of food has gone consistently downhill. I didn't feel compelled to write a review prior to tonight but the service and food was exceptionally bad tonight.  First off, the movie ""Quarantine"" was playing on the big TVs at 7:30 on a Saturday night, which is a particularly gory rated R horror film that beyond not being particularly appetizing, is also not a film that I would want my children to see in a family friendly restaurant. No one seemed to notice this for at least 45 minutes, long past the bloody scene with full frontal nudity.  Moreover, 3 of our 4 dishes came out around 40 minutes after we ordered them, only lukewarm. By the time that the other person in our party got their food we were done eating, which wouldn't have been such a big deal if it was even remotely similar to what she had ordered. They did take her order off the check which we appreciated. Our waitress was incredibly rude about this though, and unprofessionally blamed the kitchen staff even after admitting that she had misheard her order. We also had to ask for silverware three times before we received it, and when we asked for napkins intermittently she pointed us to the cocktail napkins under our beverages instead of providing us with table settings.  Finally, she seemed very put out by the fact that we wanted to split our check and that I had a coupon to use. I will not be back, Copper River directly across the parking lot is a much better way to spend your money."
