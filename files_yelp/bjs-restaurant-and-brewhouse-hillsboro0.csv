Forrest N.,"Beaverton, OR",0,2,,4.0,12/4/2012,"Took my wife and 4-month old to BJ's last night - Monday - which was our first visit to this or any BJ's Brewhouse.  I was a bit worried that we would have to wait for a table as it was crowded, but after being told it would be 15 minutes, a second hostess came up and sat us down in the bar area immediately.   First impressions:  Outstanding layout and design.  The bar area is sleek and I really like the way the lighting hits off the bottles.  The flat panel TVs are visible to all and are really sharp, making this an excellent alternative to watch games over other restaurants.  Despite the fact that there were very few empty tables, the crowd noise was not over bearing and I was able to have a conversation with my wife without having to yell.   Service:  Eliza came to our table right away and walked us through their extensive menu, which she jokingly referred to as 'enormous'.  It is, but I enjoyed her sense of humor about it.  Since we were in the bar area and it was happy hour, she made sure to point out all the deals and specials they had going on, including half off their mini-pizzas.  She was also very knowledgeable about their beer selections and when I asked about their hefeweizen, told me it has a 'heavy hint of banana' and allowed me to taste it before ordering one.  I opted for an IPA which was much better.  Eliza was spot on all night long, let us take our time looking over the menu, answered all questions quickly and well and was very complimentary towards our little daughter, putting as at ease and earning every penny of her tip. Food:  We ordered fried mozzarella to start since apps were $2 off.  They were devoured quickly.  My wife ordered a blackened salmon Caesar and left nothing on the plate.  She is very picky when it comes to salmon (and salads) so when I see an empty platter, I know she enjoyed her meal.  She also had a glass of Malbec, which she said was excellent.  Eliza encouraged me to get their jalapeno burger and I'm glad she did.  It was delicious.  Shoe-string fries were served with it and they were okay, nothing terrific.  I probably would go for wedge fries or a salad next time.  We were presented with a dessert menu and Eliza let us know about their house specialty.  Sadly, we were full and will have to consider another time. Conclusion:  Four stars with ease as the west side of Portland is absent many great options for dinner.  We live in Beaverton, so this is a bit of a hike in the evening, but well worth it.  I would love to try some other beer selections - perhaps a sampler - as well as their pizzas, so we will be back.  The atmosphere and ambiance are both tremendous, our service was impeccable and the food was outstanding."
Rebecca W.,"San Diego, CA",20,249,42,4.0,1/1/2013,"I was excited to see another new restaurant open in Hillsboro. I had never been to a BJ's before but the hubby said he had and liked it. Then my mother-in-law describes this scrumptious dessert to me that she got here and I was sold.  Tuesday, mid-day, we arrive. No crowds, though a lot of tables filled. We are sat quickly, kind hostess, clean establishment, nice comfy booth. Then, uh-oh, this big heavy marble table slides all too easily and we spend the rest of our time accidentally shoving the table into each other's laps with barely so much as a slight nudge. Not good. Our waitress arrives quickly, very friendly and patient. She even helps us make some wise choices from the menu, which she seemed to be very knowledgeable about despite this being a new restaurant.  Our food comes in an expected amount of time, not real fast, but not too long. Everything looked great. Everything tasted fantastic. We all got pizzas and they were yum! The crust was perfect and they were not soggy what-so-ever. Crispy and filled with flavor. The personal size was perfect for one person. Drinks were refilled quickly. We were checked on enough. All was going well, so we went for dessert. We all tried a different flavor of Pazooki (SP?). A warm cookie right out of the oven with a big scoop of ice cream on top. I recommend the red velvet. It was so good! Ambiance at this local is pleasant, noise level is average, staff seems very efficient, food was good, prices decent. All in all, a very good dining experience and we will return. If I could I would give this place 4 1/2 stars."
Debbie G.,"Hillsboro, OR",0,7,,4.0,2/23/2016,"I go here a lot with friends and family, and have never had a bad meal. The service has been on the slow side at times so that is why I gave it 4 stars. Lots of menu items to choose from so it keeps everyone happy"
Michael S.,"Hillsboro, OR",1,2,,5.0,4/5/2015,What can I say about BJ's large environment happy friendly host great selection of beer on tap large Bar friendly staff a place you can feel like you're really relaxing at a place that wants to have your patronage.  A place with real staff of people who know how to make you feel welcome.  Anthony was our bartender recommended great beers was friendly and accommodating and made our experience top notch. We will be back because of the warm staff.
Mike G.,"Forest Grove, OR",0,11,1,2.0,1/21/2013,"Very crowded and noisy restaurant.  Menu is so big it's hard to look through.  Prices are a little high for the type of food.  The main problem with the place is the service.  It took so long to get our food my son was starving and crying.  Then he cried more when his Kraft macaroni and cheese arrived.  It was lumpy, stuck together and horrible. My wife's pork chops were overlooked, wooden and dry.  The jambalaya was ok, but didn't have much flavor, just hot spices. We won't be going back."
PortlandTwoWheels ..,"Portland, OR",0,10,,4.0,3/28/2015,"Went here about a month ago. Had excellent service, their food has really big proportions and the beer menu was great! I think I got the jalapeno burger (bison, maybe?) and it was really good!"
Matthew A.,"Hillsboro, OR",38,101,,4.0,11/14/2012,"Pretty solid. First off, gotta be honest - BJ's has my favorite roast beef dip around and has for year. Anytime I order it elsewhere my girlfriend asks how it was - and I always say ""meh, it's all right."" But I come here and yeah, it's always good.  Otherwise, they have a huge menu that's kind of overwhelming. While I'm sure they don't do everything great  - as previously mentioned - I like the roast beef and the pizzas are deep dish delicious.  I've only tried the IPA - good - and they have a lot of local brews on tap. Happy hour has half price pizzas, $2 off appetizers and drink specials as well. Thank God,a  full happy hour which seems less common these days.  Service is very corporate - can I get you a (specific appetizer)? A (specific BJ brew)? A Pizookie? But it works for me because, well, I don't need much.  Speaking of the pizookie. Just say yes."
Jo R.,"Las Vegas, NV",13,149,,3.0,10/17/2015,"BJs was so stellar last time we were here. Tonight was a last minute panicked decision that came with great service, and marginal food.   Actually, the food wasn't bad per se, it just wasn't at all what we ordered. Late night at work for all of us combined with a long commute home past BJs (for me anyway) meant a to-go order was on the to -do list. Since I was driving by, I just went inside to order. The hostess was MIA (almost SOP here) so I went straight to the take out window. Great customer service there, easy order, sat down to wait. The food came relatively fast, and another sweet server brought it to me where I was sitting at the bar. So far, so good. The food smelled amazing. I was so excited to open the bag, which is exactly what I did as soon as I got home. What I ordered: California Chicken Sandwich with wedge fries, hold the aioli, add red onion, Margarita Flatbread, add bacon and pepperoni, and the Bacon Cheeseburger with wedge fries and sauteed mushrooms. Here's what we got: Cali Chicken Sandwich with shoestring fries, double aioli, no onions/tomato/lettuce; Margarita Flatbread with pepperoni but no tomatoes or bacon, and the burger came with shoestring fries, no mushrooms, and no cheese. Huh? There was frustration and annoyance, but it was late and there was also fatigue, so we ate quietly an begrudgingly and let it go."
Tiffany S.,"Bend, OR",0,6,,5.0,2/14/2016,"I love BJ's in Orenco Station.  I have not had a single dish that was not delicious.  We have gone on a few Saturday nights and had to wait, but the bar is right there and you can have a yummy white peach margarita while you wait!  Absolutely have the pizookie no matter what dinner entree you choose, they are so scrumptious!  Totally recommend BJ's."
Melina H.,"The Colony, TX",78,310,15,4.0,10/13/2012,"I am NOT a fan of chain restaurants, but I was really impressed by BJ's (although, and i know it's totally wrong, the name makes me snicker every time - just sayin').  The hubs and I sat at the bar and were quickly greeted by a peppy lil' blond gal who was more than happy to help explain some of their house brews to us. Once we settled in with our choices (I chose a seasonal brew - delish - and the hubs ordered a blond - he liked mine better), we began to study the absolutely MASSIVE menu. Now, big menus normally scare me because it's extremely difficult to perfect a menu this large, however all the food that passed by us looked scrumptious. I ordered a tapa sized wonton appetizer with thai inspired chicken filling and one of their lunch sized specials with a flatbread and salad while the hubs ordered a personal deep dish pizza. The lunch specials are very inexpensive - under $10 and they are ""right sized"" for a light lunch. Hubs ordered the spicy meatball pizza and loved it. I've travelled a lot to Chicago for work and found the pizza ""just ok"".  Service was wonderful. The manager came out a few minutes after we ordered and apologized for being out of the thai filling so I made a second choice but was pleasantly surprised to receive the thai chicken anyway - he was covering his bases, which I really appreciated. The bartenders was attentive withough being pushy. HH specials are pretty amazing as well and are posted. Prices for pizza are good - we are looking forward to taking the kiderinos in here, ordering a pizza with some homemade soda and watching a game together as a family...there is not a bad view in the place. Highly recommend!"
Gabe E.,"Cle Elum, WA",20,37,4,4.0,11/12/2013,As a business traveler it can be a challenge to find flavorful food that is well presented but that isn't a problem here. I've now eaten here 3 times and not been disappointed with the food or the cleanliness of the restaurant. Their pizza is especially good (I had the Mediterranean twice it's so good) I had the Black and Blue Burger and the Cobb Salad. The selection of beers is fantastic and Happy hour is awesome! The reason I couldn't give 5 stars is because of the slow service every time I've been there. It hasn't been a problem as I've always been stating over close by and when on the road and having dinner I'm not usually in a hurry but if I were under a time constraint the slow service could definitely be a problem. I will be back.
Ashley G.,"Portland, OR",0,3,,2.0,9/13/2015,"Are you familiar with Nicolas Cage? A two start actor at best. Well, this is him in restaurant form. Very poor, slow service and terrible customer service. They refused to change one of their many tv's to the football game we requested for whatever reason they could come up with. We will not be coming back to this location. The second star is because the food was good."
Kellie K.,"Hillsboro, OR",2,25,1,4.0,8/26/2014,"I have been to BJ's several times now.  The service pretty much always sucks, but the Santa Fe Salad and their house stout are always on point.  I would go here more often if I could count on the service being anything beyond mediocre.  They always seem under staffed even at the slow times.  Heaven forbid you show up during happy hour.  I am being generous with 4 stars, but it because there is something I love about this place that I can't quite put my finger on."
M M.,"Sun City, AZ",19,25,,3.0,11/16/2012,"Just home on a Friday night after stopping to meet a friend here. Ugh. Had to flag down the hostess to get us a server after we waited 30 mins to get in a drink order. One waitress came by, got our drink AND food order; then ""our"" waitress came by, apologized, confirmed our order, and left. My friend ordered a Manhattan, which was made with DRY vermouth! She returned it to the bar herself and the bartender said, 'Oh, I totally spaced how to make a Manhattan.' (Um, it has TWO ingredients!!) Note to servers- always ask if its a Manhattan on the rocks, or neat. Anyway, she finally got the right drink and our food came. The food was good, but by that time we were so hungry anything would have.  It's a big box chain restaurant.  It's noisy, and tonight it was packed. Why, I dunno. Here in Portland we have LOTS of local breweries that cater to hipsters and families. That said, I'm sure this place will even out after a few weeks. But I can get a black & tan elsewhere in town for less than $7 and Manhattans for less than $9 during Happy Hour!"
Christopher W.,"Hillsboro, OR",4,34,10,4.0,10/29/2012,"Never been to a BJ's before. If anyone is like me in the Hillsboro area, imagine a Cheesecake Factory only less cheesecake and more decent pizza. Pretty blown away by the quality of the food, I had thought this was just a big brewery with food as well. Not so. We tried the chicken lettuce wraps, a cheese pizza, and the New York steak. The cheese pizza and chicken wraps were phenomenal. Way better than we were expecting (then again we're not hard to please). The steak on the other hand was bad. No seasoning, no flavor. It seems they just unwrapped the meat and cooked it plain, and the same goes for the veggies that came with it. Not a big deal, but if you're going to charge $15 I would hope you do something a little bit beyond letting it sit on the grill for a few minutes. Maybe some salt? I dunno. You're better off getting an awesome pizza for the price. The prices are actually pretty good for a place like this. $30 for the steak, chicken wraps, and a meal for the kid. Portions are decently sized and my wife and I had no trouble sharing a single meal with an appetizer. Beyond the bland steak everything else was cool. The staff is all very nice, the joint is super clean, and hell even the bathrooms were impressive to look at. We'll be back eventually for pizza and drinks."
R Z.,"Beaverton, OR",10,45,1,2.0,6/16/2013,"I had the Porter, which was OK but nothing spectacular. I tasted a couple of different pizzas: pepperoni and whatever they call their meat lovers. They were both adequate but not special. I also had the avocado egg rolls which, again, were good but not fantastic. One strange thing happened. I was with a group of 8 or so. A waiter brought out our two pizzas and put them on the little rack, then went to serve them up. He asked who wanted the meat pizza and when we all didn't raise our hands immediately he shrugged his shoulders, said something under his breath and walked off. We all laughed it off but it would have been embarrassing under other circumstances. Overall slightly better than meh. A good place for an after work gathering where you can find something innocuous for everyone to eat and drink. I would give it 2.5 stars if possible."
Steven S.,"Beaverton, OR",7,32,,5.0,6/27/2014,Just ate here the bar is beautiful Eliza is super nice she's one of the bartenders. She was very helpful
AnneBri I.,"Hillsboro, OR",0,6,,5.0,11/9/2015,"Go see Miss Monique in the bar area. She is THE BEST. She totally made our girls night -- we wanted her to sit with us, she was so much fun. Hardworking, kind people who bring us delicious drinks like Miss Monique make BJ's WORTH IT."
Scott P.,"Hillsboro, OR",67,18,1,5.0,5/6/2013,"This place is always fun to go to. They have great beer and a good atmosphere, in addition to good food.   The pizza, burgers, crispy fries, and appetizers I've had have all been very tasty. Some people have complained about the service, but it has been really good in my experience. I'll try to remember to update this review if that's ever not the case."
Brett L.,"Portland, OR",35,113,18,4.0,10/13/2012,"I was hesitant to visit this new spot after looking over the spotty reviews but my experience here was a good one. Roy was my bartender and he did a fantastic job. He sold me on the Pumpkin Ale. Yum! That alone was worth the visit. I ordered some food to go (which was packaged perfectly) and enjoyed my brew while I waited.  The restaurant itself is gorgeous. The staff looked good and seemed to be having a good time as well. Lots of smiles and energy. The layout and atmosphere in the bar is perfect if you like to ""see and be seen"" and it seems to be going well as they were still fairly busy after midnight. This is probably the only ""happening"" place in Hillsboro after 10pm. The dining area looked a little more intimate and cozy with lots of very comfortable looking booths. My dissapointments from my experience: They were out of the Nutty Brunette and the IPA (the two best brews they have). Also there was no apparant posting for happy hour specials, though I looked for them in the menu. I was given the information, however, when I asked my bartender if they host a happy hour. Roy informed me that in addition to the 4-7pm happy hour they run a special happy hour during primetime NFL slots. I'll be seeing you folks for some cold brews and NFL action soon."
