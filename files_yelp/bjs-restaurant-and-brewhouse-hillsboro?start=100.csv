R B.,"Portland, OR",0,23,,1.0,7/18/2015,"7/18/2015: I thought after a year things would improve I was wrong.  I got in around 8:15 pm and was promptly  seated.   8:30 pm  no server to take my drink and food order, two other groups seated at table adjacent  to me  seated and served. still no server to my table. 8:40 pm still no server! I finally left. Do I suppose they don't like single Black diners? Never again."
Bruce L.,"Hillsboro, OR",0,2,,1.0,8/1/2017,"Today went to BJ's ordered the chicken fried steak burger what was brought to me was a fried chicken sandwich. Called a server over and explained that this is not what i ordered, she said she would get me my correct order. After awhile (along while) my server came and said he was sorry that my order was under cooked and they were preparing me a new order i said that my order wasnt under cooked but that i ordered the chicken fried steak burger and he said he would get me the correct order by this time my wife had finished her dinner. Called the original server over to tell her (the one i told that i hd the wrong order) that the had said they were trying to say they made me another order because mine was under cooked. She said let me take this away i dont want you to eat something under cooked.  Finall i was able to find someone to get me another beer since i had fi ished mine long ago. This could go on but im tired I f this as much as im tired of bj"
Brittney D.,"Prescott Valley, AZ",0,4,,5.0,2/20/2017,Chelsea was a fantastic bartender and very knowledgeable of the menu and beers. We will definitely be returning to see her.
Chelle T.,"Beaverton, OR",15,22,19,4.0,1/20/2016,"This place was awesome. The service was a bit slow, but I think that was because we came at a shift change. Once our server came by, the service was fantastic. Food was really good. I had a burger with bbq sauce, onion strings and brisket. I was so full, but I kept eating it was sooooo tasty. My husband had the Rib eye steak and garlic mashed. We were at Outback Steak house the week before and my husband said the Rib eye here was FAR better than Outbacks.  We will be back!! ps - try the root beer. Amaz-ing."
Proma C.,"Portland, OR",36,52,2,5.0,7/2/2016,Child friendly & with two babies...this is vital for me. The waiter for very friendly & took good care of us. The food was great too! Had the fried calamari for starters & the garlic aioli with it was to die for. I had the spicy pig pizza..highly recommend it to pizza lovers. And the mother of all...the white chocolate macadamia pizzoki l...phew calories bomb but one of the best things ever ur taste buds can explore...do not miss this one!
Julie M.,"Beaverton, OR",0,5,,2.0,2/17/2017,"Food was super good, healthy and nice portions size. Presentation was really nice. Everything was good except our waiter. He took our order and we never saw him again until food came, we sat there visiting for 2 hrs and he never even filled up our water glasses. It was last Saturday and there were not that many people in there. We sat close to the front of the restaurant so it wasn't like we were out of sight. We got there right after it opened, no excuse for Bad service. I asked him for a slice of lemon for my water, never got it. My daughter paid so I am not sure if she tipped him but I would not have given a dime in a tip,Food AWESOME, Servuice LOUSY!"
Samuel F.,"Beaverton, OR",36,14,3,5.0,6/3/2016,Went there one night with the girlfriend despite the reviews we saw. They were wrong. It was a nice and very cozy atmosphere. Service was excellent and the food was amazing. I ordered a Cobb salad with a grilled chicken breast and my sweetheart ordered a small Caesar salad and Margarita pizza. We also had some adult drinks which weren't bad either.
Rudrajit D.,"Portland, OR",115,154,375,3.0,8/23/2015,"Don't go in unless forced to by other people. Last time couldn't finished the burger. It was just not palatable enough. An extra star for their beer menu. Don't go in for the food, although not too many late night options in the area."
Mike C.,"Beaverton, OR",19,69,57,3.0,5/26/2015,No hostess to greet my party.  Was about to walk out and go to Del Taco when the polite bartender noticed we weren't being helped and got us seated and took drink and appetizer orders.  Server never intro'd herself but she was nice and attentive.  Asian chop salad and balsamic chicken for dinner.  Good food.  Just a note to management - people don't enjoy being ignored when they arrive at your establishment.
Rachel C.,"Vancouver, WA",42,28,42,4.0,9/5/2014,"Very quick service. We sat outside, because they would allow me to have my small dog with me.  Service was quick, a little too quick for my taste. We barely had time to think about our order.  Food came quick, was amazing. But the waitress forgot my drink and took a long time to come back with it. Got the check fast, were very accommodating, considering how busy they were. Nice place."
Deja A.,"Beaverton, OR",12,189,506,1.0,2/19/2014,"We went during happy hour today. It was my first time, thought it was a nice looking restaurant. After my experience I won't be back.  We went to the bar area. Our waiter at first was very attentive. Came by quite a bit, but we weren't ready.  After awhile he finally came back. My friend and I ordered cheeseburger with bacon and my boyfriend ordered bluecheese bacon cheeseburger. It took over 20 minutes for our meal to come and when it did they forgot to put the bacon on mine and my friends' burgers. So, they then brought two slices each out on one plate. Wasn't satisfied with the service in general, the wait, the simple mistake.  Their happy hour deals really aren't anything special. Small selection!! After we left we (my boyfriend and I) got food poisoning. We were sick for 2 days straight.  It went from being excited to eat somewhere new for dinner to a nightmare. Thanks a lot!!!"
Michael C.,"Beaverton, OR",1,11,,1.0,5/6/2015,"Been avoiding this place for a long time but I decided to take a gamble. Ordered the green chili fries as an app. Gross. Nothing else on the menu jumped out so I ordered a bacon cheese burger with seasoned potato wedges (jo-Jo), first bite the the jojo was terrible. The burger has a good tasting patty but the lettuce and tomato falls off in two bites. Bacon was gross.  Should I stay for the famed pizookie or leave this dump?  Only plus was the honey mustard lol.  Stay away from this overpriced crap."
Richfam996 T.,"Hillsboro, OR",0,4,1,1.0,5/6/2015,"This restaurant flipping sucks! Managers that yell at there employees, food that taste like it came out of the garbage. And shitty ass service!  Will not dine back in this restaurant!"
Laura C.,"Portland, OR",0,7,,2.0,4/29/2016,"We would come here almost weekly for the happy hour but it changed and is no longer promoted like it used to. The last 3 times we have been there the service is terrible. It's just going downhill. The server looks like he is having a bad day or can care less to smile (3 different times)if you don't like people don't work in the service industry. We still like the beer, but won't return until they fix the service issues."
Marina E.,"Hillsboro, OR",2,2,2,1.0,1/1/2015,"HORRIBLE. My husband and I sat down to grab a drink and they wouldn't accept his military ID as an acceptable form of ID (he's 25). The fact that they won't accept that alone, after five years of service to protect this country, means I will never go to this restaurant again. Also, Oregon State allows four forms of ID: Drivers License,  identification card, MILITARY ID and Passport. Thank you for showing your appreciation to our soldiers. (I only gave them one star because Yelp wouldn't let me post this without it.)"
Tiff R.,"Banks, OR",19,17,,3.0,2/7/2016,Our waitress was very nice and friendly tried to accommodate us. We ordered appetizers the fryer oil needs to be changed everything came out brown or dark. The artichoke dip was ice cold. I ordered a wedge salad and it had so much dressing I couldn't eat it. The mashed potatoes were kind of crusty. We did get some of the bill taken off. If it had not been for our waitress I would completely forget this place.
Christ F.,"Portland, OR",77,88,95,5.0,3/4/2014,"We really enjoy these events, the trivia games. We get to have a night out, we get to have lots of different beer tastings paired with small portions of really good food. The service at the events are really energetic, friendly and fun.  It's a must go!!"
J N.,"Chico, CA",11,133,19,3.0,4/10/2015,"Typical Bjs, I come for a relaxed environment and decent food.  First time to this location.  I asked for one of their 'craft' beers I have had but was insisted on getting some samples of others.  They were fine but I kept my first choice.  But the beer never came.  I wasn't upset or anything to remind the staff but just didn't want to be charged. Which I wasn't when the bill came.  Sometimes service doesn't need to go too above and beyond. . . because you'll forget the simple original request.  The table behind me got their order screwed up as well, oddly about beer or something. .  . This location seems to be the only one that doesn't do happy hour prices when a game is on. . . odd as well, my question wasn't answered by staff, I only realized it on the bill.  Never ordered bjs pizza until this visit, was just typical deep dish pizza.  After all this I was too sober for a pancoozie or whatever those tasty desserts are."
Wendy H.,"Corvallis, OR",0,2,,1.0,11/11/2015,"A horrible experience! Not very busy 10 minutes deciding where to put us, 10 minutes getting drinks and water. We asked if we could order and they said they would be right back 8 mins later. 45 for food. Then some food was cold other things burnt to the point of not being able to eat it. This is my second slow experience- we won't go back.  I emailed the manager after her response to email her but no response back."
