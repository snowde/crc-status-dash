Chris A.,"Scappoose, OR",42,12,,5.0,4/17/2016,The food was awesome the service was incredible and deserves more than 5 Stars! Had a great time out on their patio. Highly recommended! Great place to spend the night warm day on their patio :-)
Fred R.,"Beaverton, OR",14,12,8,5.0,10/9/2014,"My wife and I had an incredible experience at BJ's, yesterday.  We had had lunch here once before and had been impressed with the food and service. Expecting the same we were seated at about 11:15am all by ourselves in the dining room. After looking over the menu and talking for about 15 minutes, we realized we had not been greeted or asked for a drink order. As a matter of fact, no one was even paying attention to us at all. Having had this type of experience before at other restaurants, we decided to leave and go somewhere else. As we left the receptionist said ""Thank you"" and we remarked, ""Thank you for what? No one ever took our order."" As we started walking toward our car a server(later we learned her name was Denise) came after us and begged us to come back inside. She apologized, profusely, and said she wanted to pay for our lunch to show us that the restaurant really wanted our business. After some discussion we came back inside. She then became our server and everything went great. The manager came over(Josh, I believe) and again apologized and reassured us that we would get exemplar service and food whenever we returned. Denise also brought us a free dessert to share. I told Denise that we really didn't expect them to pay for our meal but she insisted. I had a burger and my wife had shrimp tacos. They were both delicious. I tried their home made root beer and it was amazing! We will definitely patronize this restaurant! They can teach many others about what ""customer service"" really means!!"
Courtney T.,"Beaverton, OR",233,18,1,5.0,4/15/2016,"Took my family here for the first time and they LOVED it! We are usually picky about how good our service is, but Geo (spelling?) was our waiter and was easily one of the best I've ever had-ever! Made jokes, double checked our food was right and catered to all of us. I hope you guys know how lucky you are to have him. Along with your food, Geo makes this restaurant great! Will definitely be back."
Karena S.,"Hillsboro, OR",0,88,7,3.0,5/9/2015,"We went back to BJs on Thursday night to try it again after our first HORRIBLE experience there with customer service.  They have definitely improved since. It was less busy so I think that helped. The server was friendly and gave us food suggestions. He was quick getting our order and our food. I had the fish and crispy thin fries. It was delicious. My husband had the fish tacos, which we thought were bland and not anywhere near filling. Our friends got the deep dish pizza and said it was delicious.  We probably wouldn't pick to go there again but it definitely wasn't bad this time."
Kayla M.,"Beaverton, OR",0,16,,5.0,4/6/2016,"This is always my boyfriend and I's go to spot for dinner. They stay very busy, but for good reason! And no matter how crowded it is, they still somehow are very speedy! The food is amazing and the staff is kind :)"
Jimenez P.,"Hillsboro, OR",0,11,2,5.0,4/2/2016,"Awesome experience. We were sat quickly and the server was nice. The food was good, I usually get a burger, which are great there. This time I got a chicken & quinoa, it was very filling."
Jesy B.,"Portland, OR",168,572,29,2.0,3/17/2013,"Yup, I'm doing it. BJ's, your service here sucks monkey balls and there goes 2 stars. Donkey balls even. Pick your pleasure, the one thing I can consistently expect is crap service.  I still like the food, don't get me wrong, but did I mention the SERVICE IS AWFUL? After our first visit...it's just been baffling.  1. Sat at the bar - waitress takes for ever to meander over and take our drink order. Comes back with our beer & takes our menu but forgets one BIG thing - taking our food order. We had to grab the bartender because chick went MIA.  2. Sat in the bar again - waiter was okay, checking on us almost too much. We made it clear we wanted to order dessert in a few minutes - and dude disappears for 25 minutes, ghost drops our check and poofs. THE HELL.  3. Get seated fairly fast. Waiter ignores us for 10 minutes except to say hello and put what appears to be a dirty napkin on our table. Doesn't take our drink order for 15 minutes and the service went downhill from there. The dirty napkin bit should have clued us in.  Like I said, our last 3 visits have been so perplexing service wise. Really BJ's? I like the food, love the pizookies but the best service we ever get is straight from the bar. Shape up, mmmmkay?"
Jen P.,"Hillsboro, OR",0,10,,4.0,11/21/2014,"We've found our new favorite restaurant! Hubby loved the two beers he'd ordered (a red and a porter) and the bartender made my drink (a custom order) perfectly.  After seeing the extensive menu I was a little concerned that the food would be bland and boring, but I was nicely surprised at how delicious everything was.  We almost never order dessert, but the salted caramel pizookie was amazing!  The servers were attentive and quick and timed our food well. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because we were seated in the corner near one of the emergency exits, and people kept going out that side door, causing us to get a blast of cold, rainy air.  We will definitely be back, we'll just make sure to ask not to be seated at that table again."
David W.,"Santa Clara, CA",601,1208,866,5.0,7/11/2013,The wait time was crazy for a weekday dinner at 8PM.  They messed up our orders and brought out the entrees before the appetizer plate came out...we were waiting for a good 20 minutes. Manager came by and apologized personally.  Appetizer plate was on the house. That's what I call SERVICE!
Cheryl A.,"Scappoose, OR",92,36,4,5.0,4/17/2016,"Awesome food and drinks at BJ's every time!! We have a favorite server at Jantzen Beach and a favorite server at the Hillsboro locations! Very friendly & great service!!! My favorite dishes are the Santa Fe Spring Rolls, calamari, lemon pepper rub boneless wings, and the honey crisp chicken salad :-) GREAT selection of local microbrews and plenty of choices at the bar as well :-) Nick W. (in Hillsboro) is the BEST server ever!! He's Very attentive, friendly, knowledgeable & fun!! We will be back FOR SURE!!"
Brendan W.,"Strawberry, AZ",6,321,348,4.0,8/10/2014,"I can always count on BJS.   Two separate visits during our stay in Oregon. Servers were polite, attentive, and smile. Turkey burger gets high marks from the wife. Classic deep dish (sasuage, mushroom, peperoni) is amazing.   Stewed tomatoes are great.  Side Caesar salad add chicken is good for a lunch. Pulled pork sandwich ordered by a relative,  to each their own. A new burger topped with fried jalapeños, eh I might skip next time. Wedge fries always beat skinny fries. Kids menu has a side of ribs.  BJS has variety.   I'll give that. Take out order has 4 to go parking spaces.  It says curbside service.   Some places this means they come out to you.  This place has a separate to go cashier area.  Yet don't expect curbside,  you got to go get it.  That's fine.  I am not that lazy.  Yet the sign is confusing."
Shawn G.,"Portland, OR",25,35,57,4.0,11/1/2015,"Great beer selection, food is great. Price is okay, service is always excellent. I like this place."
Abbie P.,"Portland, OR",177,71,57,4.0,9/14/2015,"I absolutely love BJ's; it's one of my favorite restaurants to go to not only for lunch or dinner, but definitely for happy hour as well! I have never had a bad experience here (knock on wood) and always leave happy, full, and a little liquored up. My all time favorite menu item to order is the Parmesan crusted chicken with white cheddar mashed potatoes and broccoli..... DIE from happiness after you eat this, cause you'll never find a better version. For Happy Hour I always order either the sliders and fries, the artichoke dip (the best) or the pot stickers. These happy hour items at the HH price are literally amazing: $4-$5 you gotta be kiddin' me. To drink I always ALWAYS order the Pink Cadillac martini because it is so good I could probably drink at least 6 and pass out in bliss. For dessert, you just have to have a Pizookie.... a cookie turned into a Pizza with ice cream on top. You can't beat it. My favorite it the white chocolate macadamia nut one, but the original and cookies and cream one is just as amazing.  If you've never been to BJ's, you definitely gotta go!"
Lexuana R.,"Walla Walla, WA",0,1,1,5.0,2/7/2016,"I am from a small town from Washington and this was the first time I ever came to A BJs restaurant And I loved it! I had nick as my server he came to refill my drink without me asking I had just came from a concert so I was sure thirsty and he recommended a chicken plate that came with black beans and white rice it was well seasoned and came with a tomato sauce it was all great and they have such a great menu from steaks to pastas,hamburgers pizza and salads I couldn't decide on what to get because of what a great menu they have and sure will come back anytime I visit Hillsboro."
Janet M.,"Portland, OR",294,901,2974,3.0,1/12/2013,"Princess had a yearning for artichoke spinach dip that I knew could be fulfilled by coming here.  Her last experience at Bugatti's with spinach artichoke dip was a bust.  We owed her.  Spinach artichoke dip, here we come.  Our server was sweet and attentive. She did a great job.  The menu is enormous.  Robert Irvine would have a fit. There is no way some of that stuff isn't frozen. They have everything from pizza to pork chops to soup to salads to burgers to fish to pasta. It was like a book. Too much to take in.  Hubby had a club sandwich, said it was not special, it cost more than $10 which he was surprised by.  It came on parmesan grilled bread with lettuce, tomato and bacon, no cheese, no ham, with mustard. He liked the mustard. Also he did  like the crispy perfect skinny fries.He had iced tea and it was fine. Princess had her desired dip.It arrived in a little bowl with a big plate of tortilla chips. There were a couple fries mixed in with her chips. She was happy and called it ""my precious"", clutching the bowl with her little mitts,  when we tried to swipe some. It also cost about $10. She had a kid's root beer. They make their own, and it was decent.  She eschewed the kid's menu, but I noticed they had a nice one with lots of choices between $5-6.  I decided on a turkey burger. It arrived on a wheaty bun with avocado, swiss cheese, a few mushrooms,  lettuce and tomato and a sauce of some kind  on the side in a little bowl. I got the wedge fries, they were seasoned nicely and crispy also ( I think they had a batter on them). My burger was really pretty tasty, also about $10. I had iced tea, too. Really this was not a bad experience in any way, and I think it's especially good for people who are non adventurous and need American food. We skipped dessert but saw plenty of  people with the inevitable ""pizookie"" that is the BJ's trademark.  Of note, a guy next to us had a beer sampler with four beers in good sized glasses, twice the size of a usual sampler glass. Hubby thought that looked good. They do have lots of beer choices and a nice cocktail menu as well. They also have ""snacks"" priced around $3-5 to have with drinks. I'd totally do that.  So, for a chain... well, I give it an ok, without the A probably. Only because I'm one of those stuck up Portland people who like to frequent  genuine family restaurants without the glitz and glamor of a place like this."
Brittany K.,"Hillsboro, OR",0,4,,1.0,9/5/2016,"Worst service I have ever had at BJs, on top of that it was like everything was sprayed with extra oil/fat, the greasiest we have seen here. We were constantly waiting for our waitress to bring silverware, napkins, refills, and our sauce for our fries kept getting forgotten and wasn't delivered until we were already done with our burgers (isn't ketchup a burger necessity?). Came here for a nice dinner for our first wedding anniversary. What a waste of $50, train your employees better. Such a disappointing meal for such a special event."
Lauren H.,"Washougal, WA",88,391,55,3.0,8/13/2014,This place is good for three things: 1. pre Cinetopia eating/drinking 2.  Deschutes Fresh Squeezed 3.  Hummus platter.  it's great. service can be questionable.  Clientele can be douchy.  but did I mention the Fresh Squeeze on tap?
Tiffany M.,"Portland, OR",71,184,71,1.0,6/15/2014,"I wish I can give no stars. Everything was gross.   My husband got the jalapeño burger with bison,  and it was small and super dry. I got the bison and if I wasn't starving I wouldn't have eaten it.   The kids sliders and garlic cheese bread looked like it was frozen. Everything was just sad looking and tasteless.  The manager took our food off the bill,  but still we won't be back.  So many better non chain places."
Jon K.,"Portland, OR",1,11,1,2.0,9/14/2015,Food is mediocre.  The real issue is service.  Bartender is a space cadet.  More interested in talking to other waitstaff.  Drinks are weak.  Get a beer.
Kristen M.,"Hillsboro, OR",948,916,922,3.0,10/5/2012,"They started construction in May and finished in October!!!! Yes, its one of my favorite chains.  Yes, they just opened (on 10/01/2012). Yes, this place looks a bit cookie-cutter (reminds me of the Torrance, Del Amo location) Yes, they are quite busy since they just opened. Yes, they are working out the kinks and are still in training (so expect delays) Yes, I ordered BJ's favorite deep dish pizza to-go (*my fave*) Yes, I also ordered a pizookie to-go (*my fave*)  The waiter asked how many utensils I wanted for my pizookie and I said two because I was embarrassed that to admit the whole thing was for me =X  He didn't listen to me anyways and ended up giving me four utensils LOL...... Parking can be a bit chaotic as well since they just opened. But if you're ordering to-go, they also have parking spots near the handicapped section for your convenience! And yes I'll come back, hoping that service will run smoothly and probably go during their ""off"" hours so I can get lighting, speedy service....."
