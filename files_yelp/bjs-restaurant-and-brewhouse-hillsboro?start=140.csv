Connie V.,"Cornelius, OR",1,2,,2.0,8/22/2016,We had roast beef dips. Looked like they were thrown together. Took 1/2 hr. to get our meal. For a $13 sandwich it was a joke. Last time we were there our food was cold. Lots of people just standing around while our waiter was trying to keep up.
Suzy Q.,"San Martin, CA",8,309,18,2.0,11/8/2015,"The roasted salmon quinoa bowl is a healthier choice but the salmon was overcooked and there was no soy ginger sauce. The quinoa was very acidic, tasted as if it was cooked in lemon juice. My friend liked the North Beach Mahi Mahi with shrimp dish alot."
Raja S.,"Hillsboro, OR",99,310,12,5.0,10/21/2012,"[Tried both the Hillsboro, Eugene locations: very consistent taste, service: Both 5-stars] Pretty good food. We tried these: Beer sampler: Good way to try most of their beers:      Berry Cider with some alcohol: pretty good, my wife liked it.      Blonde Ale: Pretty good (hoppy).      BJs Lightswitch Lager: their lightest beer, Not for me but my wife liked it.      Harvest hefeweizen: Prefer the Widmer Brother's Hefeweizen.      Tatonka Stout: pretty good (has a coffee taste): Liked on multiple occasions. Appetizers: Chicken Wontons (Buffalo style): Awesome, must try (though unhealthy)... however, this menu item has been discontinued. Chicken wings (i think we went with XXXtra Hot - 5 Pepper buffalo): though not too hot for us, it was quite good. Crispy Calamari: Quite good. Thai Shrimp Lettuce Wraps: Decent, I could have had it without the mango, which gives it a sweet taste... to me no restaurant has matched the P.F.Changs Lettuce Wraps. Avocado Egg Rolls: Loved them... not my wife's favorite Spinach & Artichoke Dip: Pretty good, my wife liked it even more than I did. Santa Fe Spring Rolls: Great taste. Basically everything in the Best Beginnings Appetizer Combo was good... highly recommended if you go as a group. Entrees: Jambalaya (with chicken, shrimp) was just awesome.  [I prefer the shrimp or chicken over the sausage].  Tried this dish multiple times (recommended to everyone of my friends & all of them loved it). The way they cooked the shrimp in both of the above dishes was just awesome... succulent and right flavor. California Chicken sandwich: Pretty good. Lobster dish with Salmon (seems seasonal/local dish): Was just okay... could avoid it. Moroccan Spice Salmon: This is not a spicy dish (though it looks spicy) as Moroccan spice is different... decent... considering that they have other great items, this might not be a repeat dish for me. Wedge cut fries were just okay... should go with crispy thin fries. Dessert: BJs Brownie: Awesome... the cookie was just warm enough and hot fudge. BJs famous Pizookie: Wasn't great... the vanilla was quite ordinary and it did not go well with the warm cookie underneath.  Large  portion. Nice atmosphere, nice service.  Only wished, they had bigger sized TVs."
Stephanie S.,"Banks, OR",13,3,,1.0,2/5/2016,"Do not eat here.  If I could give a zero star rating I would.  My husband and son got food poisoning after eating uncooked chicken at this restaurant.  They were very sick.  I called to let them know, spoke to the manager, had to insist he follow-up with the kitchen staff.  The manager was not responsive to this complaint and took no action.  I will never go back!"
Pooja B.,"Portland, OR",36,99,82,4.0,6/5/2013,Tried the pizookie once and craving for it the next day!! Don't forget to try it.. Yumm Drinks are okay and a bit expensive otherwise.. have'nt tried the food yet.
Ryan D.,"Hillsboro, OR",0,77,,3.0,7/3/2016,"Had the guacamole bacon burger. It was kinda sloppy and ended up falling apart on my fries. The thin cut fries were average, i prefer having them slightly thicker. If you had to pick each fry at a time it would take you forever the eat all of it :D. The service was good. The strawberry lemonade was just about ok. For dessert had the pizookie, the cookie was kinda extra sweet. The atmosphere is good. They have plenty of screens with pretty much all of the sports televised."
Courtney C.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,3,,2.0,3/21/2016,"Mediocre food, overpriced drinks, HORRIBLE service. After being seated, no one came to our table for nearly 20minutes. Hostess had a pissy look on her face. Yelp says this review isn't long enough yet so here is some useless filler. The end message is don't bother going here."
Marna G.,"Warren, OR",405,258,577,2.0,4/8/2013,"Years ago we went to BJ's restaurant and brewhouse in Vancouver- I remember it being really good back then. There's a new location in Hillsboro that we checked out a couple weeks ago- I have to say the service --  Well she tried really hard I'll leave it at that. So here's the deal regarding the food- Wow it went down okay I'll three of us burped it up all afternoon. And folks that's gross. I don't want to taste my food three or four hours later ick. I understand if one of us has a stomach issue in regards to food but all three of us - that seems kind of weird. And we didn't over eat either. But like I said the server she tried really hard but she didn't really make the mark, she forgot a lot of stuff - but she tried:) And yes we tip on trying!"
Megan G.,"Portland, OR",3,46,11,5.0,10/24/2014,"Went here tonight for dinner. I walked in and was given a 20 minute wait time and a buzzer. I was called up 3 minutes later (AWESOME) and seated at a booth. Our server promptly got to our table, took our drink and appetizer orders. Another drink waiter brought us our water and sodas right away. I loved that method. Our server wasn't always filling drinks- he had a runner for help. We had the spinach artichoke stuffed mushrooms and omg were they amazing!! So good! The salad was great too. We all had steak, fries, rice, and the white cheddar mashed potatoes. Everything turned out great. One bad thing was that the cocktail my partner ordered was $10. Woah. But anyhow, our waiter, Evan was great. He did an awesome job taking care of us. The atmosphere was awesome. They had the games on the multiple flat screens, full open bar and a good set up. Loved this place!!"
Amy L.,"Beaverton, OR",145,590,178,4.0,3/2/2013,"Only tried their pazookie here when with a friend when our sweet tooth addiction hit us. Place was large and not over crowded. We sat in the bar area and service was great the server came by almost immediately and checked up on us.  We got the pazookie trio. Loved the raspberry almond cookie it was the least sweet of the trio.  Chocolate chocolate cookie -  tasted like a overly sweet brownie, the chocolate that comes with it is less sweet than the ice cream and cookie.  Red velvet cookie - tastes like raw cake batter with white chocolate chip which was a bit weird to me. It was the sweetest of the three Their small appetizers and beer sampler interest me. I would come back again to try their savory offerings."
Julie T.,"San Jose, CA",138,286,1131,3.0,8/7/2014,"The food, decor, and service is just like any other BJ's.  I had the southern fried chicken and cajun pasta.  Both are a delicious choice.  The Southern fried chicken was juicy and came on a bed of mash potatoes with white gravy and corn kernels.  My cajun pasta had some spice to it.  Some of the noodles clumped together, so that's something they could improve on."
Michaela B.,"Portland, OR",0,1,,1.0,3/29/2016,"Literally waited 30 minutes to order, counted over 20 times a waiter walked in and out of the building where we were sitting. We weren't served any water or anything. Wasn't sure if there was something wrong with the way I looked, I mean I can't even rate the food because I wasn't served! I literally left in tears because of how I was treated here. Don't plan on ever coming back. Please take your money to any other restaurant around here."
John S.,"Beaumont - Wilshire, Portland, OR",0,3,,1.0,6/13/2016,"There's no reason food should be this bad. My salmon was old, overcooked, over-seasoned--actually, extremely over-seasoned--and overpriced. My wife's dish, chicken Alfredo, was refrigerator cold. All of the food just tasted old. BJ's should be ashamed for charging money for such filth."
Matt R.,"Hillsboro, OR",27,102,46,5.0,10/4/2015,"Always solid service and consistently good food. Went to a couple charity events here too and they are active in the community. Brunch was a bit weak, but it's not really a breakfast place. Big menu with lots of vegetarian and healthy options."
Bryce R.,"Gilbert, AZ",14,21,21,3.0,4/23/2015,"Good food, nice environment, wrong place to buy a whiskey. $15.50 a little steep for a double shot crown on rocks with splash of sprite."
Eric K.,"Honolulu, HI",0,7,3,4.0,5/22/2016,"Entered allow, gave a good seat to watch TV, changed to Golf Channel.  Relaxing atmosphere.  Sever was great, gave some suggestions, but known fir burger, ribs & beers, alot of them.  Ate ceasar salad was ok, Rrot Beer Steak was great & tender (med-rare) with mash potatoea & asperagus, then Root Beer, was smooth, thick and not too sweet.  Was better then expected.  Would go again, but prepared for more food."
Tina T.,"Los Angeles, CA",21,15,3,4.0,1/6/2013,"To be honest, I wasn't expecting much from this restaurant. However, seeing how busy and packed it was tonight, I can see why people came back. The restaurant is clean and had friendly service. The waitress was very attentive and polite. I can't categorize what BJs is... but it reminded me of Cheesecake Factory, but slightly more casual, and with more selections of beer. The menu was just as extensive with TONS of options. I ordered a deluxe burger with thin-cut fries (SO GOOD!) and a 3'' red velvet pizzokie (NOMS). I really liked the thick cut versus thin cut fries option, and I am a huge fan of shoestring fries... so BJs -- hats off. Also, pizookies are $5.95 where some proceeds go to charity. How sweet! The burger was $11.50. I think the prices were decent for the portion size. I would definitely come back."
Steven B.,"Hillsboro, OR",9,6,,1.0,1/7/2017,"Had my 62nd Birthday last night 1-2-2017 and wanted BBQ ribs. i have only been to this location once before and ribs were great,and so was the service.went their last night to enjoy my dinner,and had the worse service and food ever..3 people in my party,and all of us got cold food..we walked in and were seated,and waited 30 minutes and not a person came to our table to say hi welcome to BJ's or would you like a drink..nothing,so i went up front and asked for a manager,waited 10 minutes,and no manager showed,then another hostess asked me if she could me and i said im waiting for a manager,she went into the back came out and said managers to busy to come out and speak to you,where are you seated,told her,and she said a manager would come out,we ordered our food,and still no manager,25 min later my soup came out and served to me cold,again asked for a manager,and waited 15 minutes for fresh soup,then all 3-dinners came inc my ribs,all 3- dinners,cold and had been sitting,and my ribs looked like they had been cooked 3-days ago and reheated several times,and ea time more BBQ sauce then cooked again and burnt...i was hungry started to eat my ribs and had a bad taste,so i waited for our server,and my 2-other guests didn't eat their food..one had fish chips,both real cold..asked for a manager again,and never saw one,paid my bill and left,and later that night,i got very sick with food poison....and have paid for this,and did not go to work today..i call and ask for the General Manager today 1-3-2017 and get told she's not in,and they have no idea when she might be there,and asked do you wish to speak to another manager,said yes,waited on hold 10 minutes only to be told our managers are busy now do you wish to leave your name and number and they will call you back,and i said no.but i was up all night sick,throwing up my cold worse food or dinner i have ever eaten.and it showed how BJ's managers never in 2-hrs plus came out to look at our food,or to look into why we sat for 30 minutes,why we got cold food that sat for a long time and NO SERVICE AT ALL..i have lived in Hillsboro for 40 years now..ate a a lot of local places,and never wrote a review,never got sick,and always got service.got none of this from BJ's restaurant last night.and to come to find out they used to be a member of our local Chamber of Commerce and support them,and they never re-newed their membership..so they are no part or a member of them,like most local merchants here in Hillsboro,that alone says something,they no longer support our local Chamber.but i am writing this review because this is how people know whether to come and eat good food and get great service,or a place that serves cold food,no service at all,and it shows from top down,2-managers working,yet not one came out to see what i was served,and what it looked like,sitting in kitchen for 30 min plus then served to you,so at this location,and this location only,stay away,managers don't care,no General Manager next day to speak to,and no one knows when she will be in and her name is MELISSA FERRIS,and i got very sick on their food i ate on my birthday...so don't waste your money to eat their,their is a restaurant that shares same parking lot that has much better food and service by far,so when your in that parking lot,go to Copper River,fresh food,great service,owner works the floor,and checks with every table to make sure your service and food are right,and say thank-you..this does not come from this location at BJ's in   service,bad cold food,and the pork ribs i got sick off of them..so stay away...i hope this helps anyone who is thinking about eating at this location..there are other locations of BJs in other states,and their service,and food all were good,but this location is horrible....stay away....JUST FOUND OUT!! READ.. This location has no one working there..they have right away openings..16 positions opened...they have no prep cooks..no line cooks..no dish washers,hostess, take out,servers,and more..the woman who runs this..read her yelps,everyone they all say same thing...cold food,wrong order,sit for 30 min and no service,wait 40 min for food only to be cold,burnt,over season,and more,and it hasn't changed in a year..it just keeps going down hill.but 16 positions opened now...reason why..NO ONE WILL WORK FOR BJS HERE IN HILLSBORO,REASON..GENERAL MANAGER WHO DOES NOT CARE..AND HAS EVERY EXCUSE POSSIBLE,BUT THE TRUTH.

TS E.,"Portland, OR",0,6,1,1.0,4/5/2015,"This place is CRAP!  The service in the bar area is HORRENDOUS!  Matt served us and all he did was made us feel like we were taking time away from himself. Very poor customer service by him and another heavier set 5'-9"" Caucasian man w a 5 o'clock  shadow and bald.  I forgot his name. They both roll their eyes and shake their heads when they serve you.  I will never go back there.  Let's see if GM Melissa Ferris will do anything to correct this.  I hope Copper River is better."
Brenda B.,"Hillsboro, OR",16,14,,5.0,9/9/2015,"Very good food and very comfortable environment.  We have only been here once, but it was a great experience with great friends.  The service was good and we look forward to returning and trying more menu offerings.  I would recommend this for both a ""date night"" and also a fun place to go with a group."
