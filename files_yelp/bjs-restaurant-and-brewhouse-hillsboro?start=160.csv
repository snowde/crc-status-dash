Brandon T.,"Portland, OR",157,400,348,3.0,10/3/2012,"This review stems from a late night visit just one day after the grand opening, so please take any praise or criticism with a grain of salt. Also, despite this chain's propensity to receive innuendo filled comments, I will hold back for the time being. I feel that I should take it easy on them seeing as when it comes to getting reviewed it is this location's very first time.  I am giving BJ's a solid three star rating because they are getting off to a good start and I will definitely be coming back.  Now, this shop purports to be a brewhouse and they easily stand up to the test with about a dozen and half of their own brews on tap. They also feature a respectable list of 'guest beers', so you'll have an easy time finding something that you like. I tried the Jeremiah Red and I'd get it again on my next visit if I weren't so intrigued about their other flavors. Three drinks in particular caught my eye: the Berry Burst Cider (not a brew), P.M. Porter (nitro), and the Tatonka Imperial Stout.  We also tried one of their famed Pizookies, a warm cookie topped with ice cream. Specifically we got the red velvet Pizookie but I have a feeling that they all provide that same experience, one of deliciously guilty indulgence.  I wish I could comment more on the food but I didn't even see anything else besides the two excellent looking mini pizzas that a waitress mistakenly brought to our table. Now this brings me to the service, which I'm inclined to be kind about simply because this place is brand spanking new. However, I'd be lying if I said that I wasn't perturbed by how long it took for them to verify my apparently cryptic out of state ID (10+ min). To add confusion to annoyance it took at least five additional minutes to deliver my drink even though I was no more than ten feet from the bar and there were about twice as many waiters as patrons.  Overall though, the service was cordial and I'm sure their efficiency will improve with practice.  Again, I will be back especially since I want to check this place out during a big game (monster screen over the bar) and there is a long list of beer that I've yet to try."
Tashia R.,"Hillsboro, OR",0,16,2,4.0,7/20/2015,"Good food, friendly staff, very clean, lots of beers on tap, nice outside seating area. Never a bad experience at BJs."
Justin K.,"Hillsboro, OR",0,10,9,4.0,10/26/2015,"Good beer selection gotten growlers from them, the food is good. I have eaten there two times and the service has always been great! So far the half rack ribs and pepperoni pizza tasted OK."
Amber M.,"Hillsboro, OR",27,11,7,4.0,8/20/2015,"We love BJ's but they have recently raised their prices, and also, changed the noodles on their kids' grilled chicken pasta (that was a while back actually). We used to dine here about once a week, sometimes more, but now we go about once a month. Their rewards program is a nice perk, and most of the time, we have a nice enough waiter. We have had several issues in the past, and nearly every single time, they made it right without making us feel like jerks for bringing it to their attention."
Brian O.,"Hillsboro, OR",2,7,,4.0,2/7/2015,For a chain restaurant I liked this place a lot. The inside is huge and was greeted and sat very quickly. Beer was good and the food was as well.
Chase L.,"Manhattan, NY",81,27,36,4.0,7/1/2015,"Trendy, clean, good food. This is a nice large location with outside seating. Love the craft sodas (root beer, orange cream, black cherry and cream soda) the pizza is good...but I really like there pasta and chicken dinners best. Good service...will be back again."
Margaret L.,"Portland, OR",0,43,26,4.0,6/30/2014,"BJ's has an extensive menu and beer list, and although decent, I wouldn't write home about most of it ... with a recent exception:  they currently have an all you can eat soup and salad lunch special for $7.50 which lets you eat through as many of their 4 menu salads (blue cheese & bacon wedge, Caesar, green, ...) and 4 menu soups (tomato basil, chicken tortilla, chili, ...) as you can get through during your lunch hour. For $2 more, you can add another 4 signature salads (watermelon, feta & mint amongst other fru fru options) to the lineup!   You're dependent upon your server to bring you each round (they'll only do 1 soup + 1 salad at a time) -- so plan to take that long lunch to get your full money's worth. Our server was cheerfully accommodating and left us virtually no downtime between rounds."
Miwako T.,"Tokyo, Japan",14,215,10,4.0,2/11/2014,"We went for a weekday dinner and the place was packed (15-minute wait). I love their deep-dish pizza!!  Their kid's menu (and coloring) is more brainy than any other I have seen. It actually got (simple one-digit but involves a negative number) addition/subtraction on the first page  (yeap, it also got regular stuff like crosswords.) The box of crayons that come with it is cool as well. crayons are triangle and have 4 colors. We also ordered kids' Pizookie (white chocolate macademia nuts) and it was nice as well."
Bettey S.,"Hillsboro, OR",6,33,24,5.0,5/21/2016,We have been here twice and  both times  the food we ordered was very hot and tasty.  We were seated right away. The interior and staff are inviting. Our service was great. We will be going back for sure.
Cicely C.,"Hillsboro, OR",10,3,3,3.0,5/24/2015,Food and drinks are good. ..always love the tickled pink but then got hooked on the pomegranate sunset. ..love love the salads the Brussels sprout and kale salad is my fav...the service takes for ever so they have a great app so you don't have to wait in line or wait long for your order.
Tom S.,"Hillsboro, OR",9,465,164,3.0,3/26/2014,"Went here with the family for dinner, before the main evening rush.  Service was pretty good and the food was pretty decent.  Desserts are delicious, but can add to the bill very quickly."
Danny R.,"Hillsboro, OR",11,29,23,3.0,6/3/2014,"I've been there a few times now and it's usually been about the same.. The service isn't the greatest and neither is the food. The food is good the service is decent. I've never gone as a preference usually it's because I meet friends/family who picked bj's to go eat. My favorite thing would have to be the panookies, you can never go wrong with those. Overall yes I would go again but not as my first choice of restaurant."
Scott P.,"Beaverton, OR",24,29,1,4.0,5/30/2016,not bad onlt been there once. everything  was good food and drinks.
Mickie A.,"Hillsboro, OR",93,35,3,5.0,11/3/2013,"I have recently become intolerant to wheat products.  Wouldn't call myself gluten free, but I am trying. When we first started looking at the menu, choices looked grim.  I asked the waiter for a gluten free menu, and guess what, they had one! We had a wedge salad, loaded pizza (no meatballs) on a gluten free crust, a berry hard cider and a gluten free pazookie to top it all off. My husband has really been supportive, and it was his choice on the pizza.   An awesome experience and the food was amazing. Must say I am really excited that they not only have gotten gluten free choices, but that they have taken the time to make sure they actually tasted good and had a nice consistency.  Bravo!"
Andrea M.,"Hillsboro, OR",103,58,36,4.0,3/18/2015,"We've visited about a half dozen times for burgers and beer.  Great beer, *great burgers - the kind where the meat tastes good and fresh and not frozen/dried out or overwhelmed with bun and sauce*, and most of the time, great service."
Marianne S.,"Portland, OR",74,269,112,4.0,3/11/2014,"BJ's has an enormous menu! It's like a book and it might take you a long time to decide what to order. So far I have not made a wrong choice. Their pizzas are great!  And so are their pastas. I didn't have their fish and chips, but my dad said they were really greasy. The only bad thing I've heard, though. They also have happy hour, which is pretty good. A dollar off beers and discounts on certain food items. I ordered their flatbread pizza off the happy hour menu, it's only $4 and a little smaller than the normal size, but with an appetizer we shared and that I was stuffed!   They have good beer too! There service is great.  I will definitely be back!"
Jessica P.,"Scappoose, OR",5,21,,4.0,5/6/2015,"The menu here is extensive, including the kids' menu, which is a plus with two picky eaters. The service has been great both times we've visited, particularly this week, our server was Norm. He was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menus, made several recommendations, and overall took great care of us. We've been increasingly disappointed lately in another restaurant in the area we used to visit semi-frequently, and I believe BJ's will be a more than suitable replacement. The food and service are both good. Their draft sodas are fantastic. The only reason it gets 4 rather than 5 stars is because we've only visited twice so far."
Nancy B.,"Beaverton, OR",47,94,216,4.0,2/11/2014,"BJs is a restaurant and brew house somewhat like McMenamins, only their food is leaps and bounds better than McMenamins.  And there is more of a variety of food, too.  Food is fresh and tasty - most of the time. One time I ordered their Southern fried chicken (having had it before and it was so tender I didn't need a knife) and it came out very tough and chewy. I think cook must have had a bad day.  Either way, I haven't ordered it since. My favorite dish is the (now I can't remember the name) angel hair pasta with pine nuts, sun-dried tomatoes, red peppers, and you can add chicken which is very tender and tasty.  Also, one time I ordered a pizza (which is also VERY good) and got a hair in it.  Boy, did they make everything right!  The manager was at the table apologizing profusely and gave me another pizza (which they didn't charge and also didn't charge for the first pizza). They also gave me a bowl of soup and that didn't even appear on the bill. All in all we've had pretty good experiences with BJs.  Definitely, our favorite restaurant would have given it 5 stars but for the 2 mishaps..."
Holy-foo' X.,"Portland, OR",66,1078,1,4.0,7/19/2013,"I didn't realize until having lunch here recently that BJ's is a chain, and apparently is particularly big down in Cali. For all that, I really enjoyed their salads, and find them far superior to other chains, such as Red Robin, or Shari's or McGrath's, whose salads I enjoyed for many years but have all slipped considerably in recent years. Too many places, in the never-ending quest to keep costs down, cut corners precisely where they shouldn't, when it comes to quality control! Back to BJ's: their calamari sampler was particularly good---- nearly made me completely forget about the horrid faux squid experience over @ Bugatti's, recently. We haven't even had tried any of the magnificent looking--and smelling!--- pizzas @ BJs, and look forward to returning there soon, to be able to do so w/o further ado!"
Jaci S.,"Hillsboro, OR",1,47,5,1.0,6/17/2013,"Arrived at 6:15, seated at 6:30, ordered rather quickly, dinner served at 7:30, waitress never once asked how the meal was and refilled water only once (after that we had to flag someone down). Ordered dessert after having to ask for a dessert menu and then they brought ONE for a table of six!  Didn't leave until about 8:30. The flatbread pizza appetizer is awful, the Mediterranean Salmon was good but very small and the side was awful. Of course the Pizookie was yummy!  Not sure I am in any rush to go back!! On a side note the parking situation is miserable."
