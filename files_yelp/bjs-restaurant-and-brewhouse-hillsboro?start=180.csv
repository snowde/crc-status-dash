C. A.,"Beaverton, OR",0,11,1,3.0,8/4/2013,"Tonight was my third visit to BJ's. Each time, the food has been good -- a step up from pub grub at McMenamin's. Service has always been kind of slow.  Tonight, four of us were dining. As usual, the greeters and all the staff are very nice and friendly. They're just sort of. . . scattered. Two of our party had arrived early and already had drinks. We remaining two ordered beers -- and the wait began. It really can't take 15 minutes to draw a beer, can it? Still, it was okay, because we were enjoying the conversation. Server came back with the beers and asked if we were ready to order. One lady in the party ordered and he then turned to the gentleman opposite here (we were at a 4-top) to take his order. He politely indicated that the server should take my order next (ladies first still applies in restaurant service, folks!). All apps and main courses ordered, we enjoyed our drinks and conversation -- for a long time. Oh, and when he left after taking our order, he did not pick up the menus. I know that's a small thing, but really, those menus are BIG and take up a lot of room. It was awkward to have them there. He came back at one point to bring us waters (we had to ask for those twice) and still didn't take the menus. We finally flagged down another server and asked him to take them away, which he did. Finally another server appeared with one salad. The other three apps were nowhere in sight. She set it down in front of the gentleman and left. We proceeded to wait some more. Had to have been at least five minutes before the other three apps arrived. Is it really that hard? Make the three hot apps and THEN make the salad and take it all out together. Hmmm... Apps happily consumed, we waited some more. Someone came by and took two of the four app plates away -- and disappeared. The other two were left on the table until our meals came out. Awkward #2. When our meals did arrive, one in our party discovered that her Thai Chicken Salad was missing the chicken. Hmm... Server came back to ask if all was well, and she pointed it out. To his credit, he immediately went to the kitchen and returned fairly promptly with a nice plate of sliced chicken for her salad. Seems whoever is doing quality control in the kitchen messed up on that one! At the end of the meal, two of us decided to share a Pizookie as we had never had one. The guys were too stuffed, so we got to enjoy it on our own. When the server took the order, he again took two plates away and left the remaining two, which weren't whisked off the table until the dessert arrived. BTW, the Pizookie is good, but splitting it was absolutely the right thing to do. Very rich! All in all, the food is very good -- probably no Michelin stars or anything, but better than most pub food. I perused the menu online so that helped -- the thing is huge! It could take a long time to decide what to order if you'd never seen it before.  Service and expediting and quality control have issues. Everyone is nice, which makes up for a lot, but the inconsistencies are glaring. There are lots of servers running around -- there were four clustered around a computer terminal for quite a while -- but they just don't seem very organized in how they do things. Does the main server bus tables, too? I don't know. If there are designated bus persons, they need to do a better job. If the server is supposed to do that, then some further training needs to happen. And timing and quality checks in the kitchen need to be addressed, too. It's just awkward to have one person get a salad and then stare at it and the other three dinner companions for five minutes or more before the rest of the appetizers arrive. I'll be back, but only when I know I have time to relax and not stress about how much time I'm taking for a meal. :)"
Ashley M.,"McMinnville, OR",166,54,2,4.0,5/8/2015,"Odd service in the bar, & the food was OK. The first time I came in, I got the soup and salad. The soup had ~ twice as much salt as it should have, but aside from that, it was good."
Steve A.,"Portland, OR",39,85,,2.0,9/23/2013,"I was hopeful for this place but after our visit, its seems like just like another overpriced sports bar. The wine is ridiculously over priced (good selection but) as well as the food. Speaking of, my burger left a rock in my belly which was pleasant the next morning, ugh...My kids were happy but too young to know any better, :) ...Grandma who was with us also had an upset stomach after having the grilled chicken ceasar salad. The chicken was not grilled (had black marks on it but defintely was not grilled).  Sorry, will not be returning..."
Anna B.,"Lake Oswego, OR",2,24,32,3.0,2/27/2015,"I had the wings and the carnitas fries with chili verde... The sauce on the wings tasted like Frank's hot sauce, I think they could go with something a little less generic. The fries we really yummy but lacked in the carnitas area, it was mostly cheese and beans. The service was okay. Its a loud restaurant but that's to be expected at any brewhouse."
Mike B.,"Hillsboro, OR",0,3,1,2.0,10/17/2014,"Don't bother coming here with a group bigger than 4 unless you've allotted enough time for Christ-the-Carpenter to return and build you a table to sit at. While the menus were already at the table when we were finally sat, they failed to leave the flare gun apparently required to signal that you're ready to start your dining experience."
James L.,"Hillsboro, OR",4,62,3,3.0,5/30/2013,"Yelp has this place at a solid 3 stars and that is what it is - a chain pizza joint, with decent food and service. You know what you are going to get here - it's going to be a packed house, full of good ol' fashioned Americans, eating too much food and paying a bit too much for what they get.  All in the name of the one thing we American's seem to hold dearest to heart - safety and familiarity. The menu is ridiculously huge, but I'll be surprised if you don't find something to enjoy. The wine prices are way, way to high - $10 for a glass of Mondavi Cabernet is just dumb in Oregon...drive down the road to a wine shop and get a locally made Oregon Pinot for $9. So, if you like to know what you are going to get, and want a place with enough menu options to keep the rug-rats happy (and maybe have a few drinks while you are at it), then this place is for you."
Morganann P.,"Hillsboro, OR",0,4,,4.0,6/12/2015,"The food is good, I love their pizza, but the service isn't that great. I always have to ask for refills and every time we go our appetizer takes forever so they end up bringing our entrées out immediately after. They need to work on their timing."
Holly S.,"Lincoln City, OR",2,24,4,3.0,10/13/2013,"To start the drive- way/parking  and front entry is all wrong. Went in for lunch @ 12:30, ordered quickly cause we were hungery.  Fairly busy inside but seemed as though most were already eating. It took over 45min to get 2 turkey sandwiches! Which was ridiculous. But our waitress was very kind, didn't even charge us for our lunch.  So I think this place has some kinks to work out in there kitchen but there service was great their food was good.."
Danielle K.,"Portland, OR",0,25,1,3.0,10/12/2013,"When BJ's first opened I avoided it just on principle. I don't like the big boxy, commercial look of it. Eventually though, circumstances came about that brought me here. First impression is that it is very open and grand, high ceilings, big bright bar and lots of seating. I'd almost compare it to the interior of The Cheesecake Factory. The menu too actually, similar in the sheer vastness and variety of it.  I was impressed though, with the beer selection. One of the only places on the west side where you can find Delirium Tremens, Duvel, Piraat, Orval, etc. The food is good. I enjoyed their ahi poke appetizer, though its quite spendy."
Singaravelan V.,"Beaverton, OR",35,176,96,4.0,4/12/2013,"I have been to this BJ's a couple of times now and have had consistently good food and service. The only issue is the long wait times during the evenings for dinner.  I got to sample quite a few items from their menu as we were a big group and we shared many dishes among my friends.  -- Buffalo Chicken Wontons - Good but you just get 3 pieces per plate which is not good for sharing -- Chicken Wings -- Decent but have had better wings at Buffalo Wild wings --Avocado Egg rolls -- I am not a big fan of Avocados but many of my friends liked this -- Santa fe spring rolls - pretty good (Cant go wrong with fried stuff, can we?) -- Spinach & Artichoke Dip -- Pretty good Entrees -- Jambalaya -- I liked their Jambalaya a lot and esp. the blackened chicken pieces were well done and the rice was quite flavorful -- Crispy Jalapeno burger -- Very good -- California chicken sandwich -- I liked this one.  I tried their Pizookie for Dessert which was delectable and hard to resist. Its basically a scoop of icecream served on a Warm freshly baked cookie. This is a must try if you like desserts like Hot fudge sundae."
Trisha H.,"Beaverton, OR",0,10,,1.0,2/18/2013,"The customer service at this establishment is abysmal.  We ordered our meals and got our salads in a timely manner.  However, 50 minutes after ordering and several assurances by the waiter that our meals were coming out, we still did not have our entrees.  I finally told the waiter to forget it and that we would pay for the salads and leave.  The waiter talked to the manager, who told us coldly that he had comped the salads -- and gave no apology.  As we were leaving, my wife asked to speak to the manager.  After informing him that her birthday dinner had been ruined, she asked how long it should have taken for our meals to be brought to us.  He said simply ""17 minutes.""   Again, no apology or offer to make it right.  His attitude indicated that our concern was more of a nuisance to him than anything.  He seemed to think that just comping our salads was enough and that we should go away. We had been to this establishment twice before and the food was enjoyable.  But we will never go back after such atrocious customer service."
Dan A.,"Lake Grove, OR",0,58,2,4.0,2/11/2015,"It's a great restaurant--several choices of beer and meals. Wonderful service. Emphasis on pizza, sandwiches, hamburgers, and alike.  Great service.  The only thing wrong is the iced tea.  It's always stale.  Went there 4 times over the past year and it's always stale.  Other BJs in other locations don't have this problem."
Brian W.,"Beaverton, OR",2,88,30,2.0,8/1/2015,"I doubt I'll be back. I know this is a popular place to go so I was really looking forward to my first visit. We were expecting it to be busy so my father-in-law called ahead and got a 5 pm reservation for 5 adults and 2 kids. We got there at 5 sharp. It wasn't busy but we still waited for 10 minutes as the hostess couldn't seem to figure out how to do anything. She never greeted us or even acknowledged us. But she did figure out how to seat a few smaller groups that came in after us. Then she comes up and says we can go back and seat ourselves. Ok that's not very professional. We walked back and there wasn't a table set up at all. She was so confused. We were too. She asked us to go back up to the waiting area. After 5 more minutes she said it would be a few minutes. Geez. So the hostess who was working on 08/01/15 at 5pm needs to be severely retrained. Our server was great on the other hand. He was very attentive. Our food was ok except for the $22 rib eye steaks that 3 of us ordered. My father-in-law ordered his medium-well, his was half medium rare and half rare. Still bleeding is a good sign it's not cooked medium-well. I ordered mine medium. One end was rare, it went to medium in the middle and the other end was medium-well. Just weird. Most of the steak was fat so at $22 I felt ripped off. The third steak was also cooked unevenly but not as bad. I will say my clam chowder was excellent and the handcrafted root beer and cream sodas were really good. But that's just not enough to bring me back."
Rustie D.,"Hillsboro, OR",14,111,9,1.0,7/21/2014,"Anyone who knows me, knows I prefer the off the beaten path restaurants; the one in a million restaurants rather than these chain things that have no individuality; no taste of their own.  Well, I've been here four times now and each time it has gotten worse for me.  The one thing I will say is the first two times the service was very good.  This time, the service was below mediocre. The items on the menu are like the items that appear in your side mirror on your car; larger than they really are.  The beet salad was over $5; but only had $2.00 worth of food on it.  Yeah, it came on a long white plate, very fancy, but the amount of food for what they charged was just stupid.  Then the main course came and everything, and I do mean everything had a ton of pepper on it!  Oh yeah, I am a pepper fan, but if I wanted my food blackened, I'd have ordered it that way.  The steak was so tough and peppery, I didn't finish it and I didn't take it home.  The side veggies I chose were asparagus and the horseradish potatoes.  The asparagus came so over cooked as to be black...black asparagus...dried out...with pepper covering every centimeter.  I couldn't even eat it.  My sister ordered the brussel sprouts and they were so over cooked and nasty, she just pushed them to the side.  Now, I grew up eating good food; my mom was a superior cook - studied at the French cooking school in New York...we know good food.  This wasn't it. We called the waitress over and told her the veggies were nasty and she asked if she could bring us out new veggies.  I said, ""why aren't they going to be just like these?""  [Yes, I tend to be sarcastic when you mess with my money...this food costs plenty of money.]  She brought the manager over, who immediately started to defend the way they cook things.  The brussel sprouts are made in the morning, because they only have one oven.  [What?  Yeah, he said one oven.]  So they sit under heat lamps all day long...same with the asparagus.  That's great!  So tasty!  For those of you who don't eat either veggie; they only take about 5-7 minutes to cook and you can do that while you're burning your steak with pepper!  You don't need to make a bunch in the morning; you can, if you know how, cook them to order when the food is ordered.  Even if your kitchen staff is small.   The manager did offer to get us ""naked"" asparagus without seasoning and he told us we could have ordered it that way.  Really?  How come the waitress didn't tell us that?  She didn't tell us because as she admitted later, she didn't know we could do that...there's no button on the machine that tells her we can order naked anything.  The only reason we left her any tip at all was because my sister felt sorry for her.  It was obvious she was out of her league; had no imagination herself, and had absolutely no individual authority to create a decent dining experience for her customer. So, the steak was pepper burned; the ribs my sister ordered were over cooked; [go to the Albertsons on 25th in Hillsboro for really good ribs.  The guy there knows what he's cooking!]  we left disappointed with yet another chain restaurant; and won't be going back there!"
Ron T.,"Portland, OR",167,623,295,2.0,12/19/2012,"At first I got hot and bothered when I learned that we are getting BJ's for lunch.  Two minutes after getting seated, I feel like you'll be on a Food Network tv show soon in a not so good way. Why? Your menu is all over the place. The quality is as generic as Applebee's. While one pizza is decent, the other looks like it was microwaved. Uhm, consistency, hello? The appetizer- sampler platter is mediocre.  I guess this is prime location for a suburbanite who haven't been to town. Or as they say, a step above Buffalo Wild Wings, Red Robin's, Rock Pizza, Golden Valley Brewery and whatnot.  And what is up with the two hour limit if you're a huge group? That is a major turn off. If you want business, you will not put it on your immediate clause.  Mediocre at best."
Astra N.,"Hillsboro, OR",3,43,,2.0,1/27/2013,"BJ's is a bit of an institution elsewhere in the West, so seeing one spring full-grown like Athena from the head of Zeus here in humble Hillsboro was a bit of a shock. They're out on Cornell Road just east of Intel, so it was a bit of a process to see the place built.   If you've never seen one of these, it's a veritable palace; a house of worship to what boils down to homemade beer.  (I'm told the beer is good.  I don't drink beer, so I'll cheerfully admit that this part is lost on me). I'll talk instead about the food. On entry, you notice how *big* this place really is - several thousand square feet; stone floors and high ceilings - and loud, loud music. We showed up, my customer and I, at opening-time on a Friday.  Even though there was no one in the bar and the place looked like an empty cavern, it took about ten minutes for the staff to get around to finding us (I'll give 'em this; the place is new, and they're likely all still getting used to working in something that reminded me of a converted aircraft-hangar). My customer ordered the club sandwich; I ordered their 'California Chicken Sandwich'.  We both had iced tea to drink, which didn't seem to make the waitperson happy.  I learned why when the food arrived. Both sandwiches had oil-grilled bread, which gave them an overall greasy-feel; the fries were pre-frozen (not fresh), and I'm convinced that no one in the kitchen had ever heard of salt or pepper (no seasoning or flavor to either sandwich (in retrospect, I'm glad I ordered the extra bacon for my 'California Chicken', or it would have tasted like something my Grandmother would've made in the early '60's).  My friend's sandwich had far too much bread - and was big enough to feed two people.   It was, also, equally greasy and flavorless. Then it hit me.   This place is a brew-pub-of-sorts.  Their main product is BEER.  The food is intended to be a vehicle for BEER.  It's intended to buffer the stomach with plenty of grease and bread-products; they're low on seasoning to prevent the upset of same (or, in the worst-case, to prevent it from tasting bad when it all comes back up in the parking-lot after drinking too much - wait for it - BEER). I'm giving them two stars because I'm being charitable - they've been open less than a month, and the service might get better. They only get one star for the food, though, and that won't change. Recommendation:   If you're only looking for something to stuff down your gullet as a buffer for copious amounts of their beer, go ahead on.  Don't go there if you want decent FOOD, however - there are other places for that."
Chris M.,"Beaverton, OR",13,2,,2.0,1/10/2013,"Overall not great. Pizza was under-sauced (admittedly I do like a lot of sauce on my pizza, but my wife thought it was a little dry too). Our server was very slow, and seldom checked in on us. Plus, he forgot a couple of things from our order. He did bring them right away, but still annoying. One of my kids spilled some water and at least three or four severs walked by my wife cleaning it up and didn't offer to help or get more napkins. Finally she asked someone but instead of helping they went and got someone else. All the while there was a pool of water on our table and the floor.  Random note, they have the smallest high chairs I had ever seen. Our 14 month old didn't fit so we had to use a booster seat instead.  Doubtful that I will return."
Isabella L.,"Berkeley, CA",191,259,815,4.0,3/6/2013,"My family and I were driving into Portland from San Francisco really late at night, and we met my uncle/aunt here for a really late-night dinner (11:30pm). The server was extremely attentive and helpful and we were seated in the dining area. At this point as you can imagine, there were not that many there.  We ordered a spaghetti and meatballs, a classic beef burger, pizza, and chicken marsala. We also ordered side salads and a soup with our meals. All the dishes were done extremely well and everything was delicious. One of the problems is that everything was a little too salty for me. The food here is delicious but its not that cheap and most of the entrees were around $15. I highly recommend the pizza and the pasta. The chicken marsala was so good but it was really salty so they could improve on that."
Tim D.,"Beaverton, OR",16,25,1,2.0,12/27/2012,"Food was mediocre as well as the service.  Maybe we just had bad luck with our server.  The server for the table next to us was at that table 3 times for every one time our server was at our table.  We kept having to remind him when we asked for things like water and boxes for our leftovers.   We had the deep dish pizza and I was unimpressed.  But again, this may be because of how long it took for our food to get to us.  The crust was soggy like it had been sitting for a while before the server came to pick it up.   Overall I was unimpressed, the place was huge and loud.  I couldn't hear people at my own table that were sitting two spots down from me.  For the price there are a lot of other options around town I would rather spend my money."
chelby c.,"Beaverton, OR",36,5,,5.0,2/25/2016,Top notch place to eat. The ribeye is succulant and tender. The roasted brussel sprouts are to die for! Thier food is outstanding! The wait staff is superb!! Well priced for the amount and quality of food!
