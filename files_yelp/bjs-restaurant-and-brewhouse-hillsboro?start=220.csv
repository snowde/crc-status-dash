Kim D.,"Rockaway Beach, OR",2,3,,5.0,10/5/2015,"We went to BJ's for the first time on Saturday night and had a wonderful experience! Our waiter, Michael, was just excellent. He was probably the best waiter I've ever had. Very attentive, his suggestions were spot on and he even brought out my 2 year olds dinner first so he didn't have to wait too long. And then my dad gave him a generous tip (I think in the 30% range) and he rushed back to thank my dad for his generosity. I've never had that happen and I thought it was just the nicest gesture. Anyway, great food, wonderful atmosphere, and amazing staff!"
Perla S.,"Hillsboro, OR",0,6,1,1.0,12/22/2012,"Worse service Ive had in a while!! Got there and sat at the bar to wait. We waited for 10 minutes before any of the 3 bartenders paid any attention to us because WE  called. 25 minutes later two ladies walk in and sat next to us.The bartender was very quick to tend to them introducing himself and everybody behind the bar. For 45 minutes we had to get the bartenders attention to order drinks while the gals next to us kept getting rounds of drinks.  Even though they got there half an hour later than we did they ordered their food first and when we ASKED him to take our order he said, ""Hold on"" and continued flirting with the girls.....IT WAS HORRIFIC AND I WILL NEVER GO BACK THERE AGAIN. I have never been treated so rudely in my life.  Dont waste your time or money here!!!"
Sean A.,"Portland, OR",58,155,61,4.0,8/2/2014,"A pleasant surprise indeed.  We hated going to our local one in our old city simply because it was so popular the wait times for dinners rarely were less than 45 minutes.   Here we didn't wait at all.  Greeted promptly, sat immediately, even with a rather busy floor.  Server was at our table within a short time to greet and get drinks going (as well as an app).  My wife and I were VERY happy to see a starter salad that was on a trial a year ago had made it to full time status.  The Mixed greens with watermelon, mint, honey vinaigrette, and feta.  If you enjoy a light salad with lots of flavor, you really should try it.  I have duplicated this at home because we enjoyed it so much (and didn't want to ever deal with the ludicrous wait).   We also had calamari, which wasnt bad, but several larger pieces were not separated making it more like eating a while deep fried squid.  I didnt mind ripping it apart a little, but this is a higher end restaurant folks. My wife ordered a parmesan crusted chicken with a fantastic lemon butter sauce (the other ingredient escapes me but it was well paired), sun dried tomatoes, and white cheddar mashed potatoes.  Well executed and awesome flavors.  this is a winner for sure. I had a balsamic glazed grilled chicken breast with fried onion straws, and carmelized onions (why 2 onions I have no idea) paired with white cheddar mashed as well.  The chicken was great.  The balsamic reduction with the onion straws and mashed were an amazing combo.  Notice I haven't mentioned the caramelized onions.  Well.  Sadly, myne were hardly caramelized.  More like lightly sautéed/steamed in a large batch to prepare for service.  They were soggy (i know caramelized should be on the soggy side, but see the steamed comment and you get what i mean) and didnt taste right at all.  So they didnt get eaten.  Maybe if those were done properly they might have added something to the dish, but in my case, they were a waste of product and cooks time. The whole family had their signature Pazookies, each of us had something different.  My wife and i each tried their new creations.  A peanut butter smore  cookie creation, and a salted caramel cookie creation.  I ate my salted caramel totally.  Awesome pick, i hope they keep this one.  The PB smore.  While good.  It was super rich, and some may like it, but i think a person would have to split it to keep from going into a diabetic coma.  It was very good as well, wife and kids loved it, but a bit too rich for me LOL. All in all, we had a great experience with little problems, great food, good service.  We will return when the mood strikes.  =)"
Andy Z.,"Beaverton, OR",0,6,,4.0,11/14/2013,"This is a huge restaurant located on Cornell Rd near Intel Ronler Acres Campus. I've been here a few times (mostly for company outings). Depending on the waiter, the service can be mediocre to excellent. I've been waited on by what appeared to be a seemingly nervous person to a very professional gentleman. They've definitely had some wait issues early on, but now the food comes out decently fast, even if it is packed. My favorites dishes are the Ahi tuna salad, ahi tuna appetizer, shrimp jambalaya, and the pizookie dessert. They do have a large menu of relatively diverse dishes, usually with an Americana taste. Their lunch specials, although cheap, can leave people wanting more. I've had better luck ordering the entrees (although they can be a bit expensive). One of the most professional experiences I've had dining was when I was with family, and they got the order wrong. They let us eat the incorrect dish and gave us the correct one. The waiter and (what seemed like a manager) came to apologize and gifted us the order."
Chris J.,"Beaverton, OR",7,92,5,5.0,4/27/2013,"I have to say that this place is one of my favorite places to eat! Everything on the menu is good, the deserts are amazing, and the service is a step above. I go here all the time and recently when I was here a waiter named Jaye asked me if I wanted more Chili (I finished my original bowl). I said sure, is it free (in a joking tone)? He said no, but I'll hook you up! Wow, how cool is that? He gave it to me for free for no other reason than just being a nice guy!  I have nothing but good things to say about BJs and if I were you I wouldn't listen to a single negative review on here!"
Sean T.,"Hillsboro, OR",0,12,,5.0,11/3/2013,"If you are a fan of huge selection of great beers, this place is for you.  Went in for dinner last week (fantastic parmesan crusted chicken), and immediately ordered a sampler of 8 beers (5oz each).  They were all good, but 5 of them were absolutely great: Pumpkin Ale, Blonde, Hefeweizen, Stout and Porter.   The atmosphere was nice, especially if you're a football fan like me.  Plenty of large TV's showing all live games... but not like many dive bars in town that are pretty run down.  This place was just recently built, so it's still new and very nice.  GREAT patio out front, including TV's and heat lamps. Staff was friendly, knowledgeable and prompt.  I give it high marks all around."
Tiffany M.,"Portland, OR",101,258,14,3.0,11/26/2012,"I've always liked BJ's (and am quite pleased they opened one close to home), and what was once a 4 star has been bumped down to a 3 based on the last visit's service. The service is just as important in the dining experience, and when this place gets packed the service gets pretty awful. Our server wasn't a bad guy, just overworked. But when it takes 20 minutes to get the drinks, another 10 for them to say they are out of the app we ordered, and another 10 for the food... not cool. I'm hoping they'll work out the kinks as they get used to the volume of guests. On to the better stuff. I'm not a deep dish fan (my husband however orders the great white every time), and I was pleased to see ""regular"" crust pizzas and flatbreads. I'm on the veggie flatbread with goat cheese right now, which is $2 off at HH because it's technically an appetizer. I like their pasta, but it can be a little low on flavor sometimes, ordering it with blackened chicken helps though. The sandwiches I've tried are also pretty good. The beers are good: the blonde, hef, berry burst cider (really sweet if you're into that kind of thing), jeremiah red are all good. Usually the seasonal ale is a winner as well.  Don't leave without getting a pizookie!! The classic chocolate chip is still my favorite."
Dan N.,"Forest Grove, OR",53,238,131,3.0,12/1/2012,"Wife N and I went on a Thursday night,  6:50pm. Wow.   This place is jammed.  Checked in and got my special pager doohickey. We were seated by 7:15 amongst a row of small ""for two"" tables with one long communal booth seat and chairs on the aisle side.  Our first impression: We feel crammed in like sardines, and man, is it loud in here.  My elbows on each side were perhaps eighteen inches from neighbors.  Being not-terribly-into close crowds, we ALMOST left without eating but decided to stick it out.   Thankfully, the ambient noise level was so loud that with the exception of a highly curious 10 year old just off my left shoulder most of our conversation remained private.  But I could still easily make out most of the conversations of the two neighboring guests.  Eventually the 10 year old and her family vacated, only to be replaced with a 6 year old who insisted on bouncing on the (one very long) booth seat while playing his pocket-sized video game console. Wife N. started with a salad wedge, a quarter head of iceberg lettuce with a substantial helping of blue cheese dressing and crumbles, bacon, and (normally)  tomatoes and onions which she opted against.  Frankly it was pretty good--I mean good for an otherwise nondescript wedge of iceberg.  The bacon was mapl-y sweet and married quite well with the tang of the bleu cheese and dressing.  Honestly, really good as far as wedge salads go. I ordered the Chicken Marsala and Wife N. ordered the French Dip.  Along with the meal, we ordered an 8-beer sampler (eight 5-oz pours).  You can pick from a selection of about 11 brews and a berry-apple cider. About 15 minutes later, the meal arrived.  Beer was nowhere in sight.  It arrived about 5 minutes after the food.  Okay, no big deal.   The food was quite good.  The chicken was ""food safety police"" done (which I maintain is about 10-15 degrees more cooked than necessary) but it still was tender, flavorful and relatively juicy.  The sauce was as good as we make at home.  The chicken was accompanied by mushrooms, steamed green beans and served atop fettuccini pasta.  The veggies were hot, but still crisp.  Nicely done.  The French Dip was very flavorful--the beef was tasty and the garlicky bread it was served on gave it a lovely kick.  On the side was creamy horseradish which Wife N doesn't eat but I gladly applied to the bite or two I consumed. The beers were honestly a nice surprise.  I realize BJ's is a pretty big ""chain"", but for a chain, their beers were pretty good.  Their ruby-tinged cider had a berry twist to it and for those that like lighter-alcohol fizzy drinks on the sweeter side, this one was VERY nice.  Their hefeweizen had an oddly-floral nose to it that initially was a bit weird but we wound up liking it by the second sip.  Other beers we tried included their Porter, their Stout, a Red, and a Nut Brown.  All were pretty good--some were better than competitors'.   This restaurant has been open around a month.  So it's understandable that the service is still a little scattered.  On the whole, I'd say ""A-Ok"".  If it was just about the food and price/value, I'd be saying 4*s.  But the service was 3*s, and with getting crammed in like a sardine, 2*s, we have an averaged 3*'s rating, good enough to return in perhaps a month or two once they get the kinks ironed out."
Dan Karen D.,"Hillsboro, OR",1,36,12,3.0,3/31/2013,"I have been to BJs twice now. Once on a very busy Thursday night and most recently for an early Saturday supper. Both times the service was excellent and the food is fine. The menu is very large with many options. The first time, my hubby enjoyed the veggie mini pizza and the burgers my kids ordered were humongous. I ordered off the 540 menu which is the light fare and had the Thai chicken salad which was okay but I decided not to have it again as it was just kind of bland. The second time I tried a Southwestern salad which was made to my specifications (no cheese or tortilla strips) and was fresh and delicious. I got the dressing on the side so it was just right for me. My friend had the Mahi and really enjoyed that. The burgers were great although my gluten free daughter would have liked more lettuce for her lettuce wrap.  The low rating is more because the food is just okay, but there is nothing really great here. So if you have a hard to feed crowd who is not very adventurous this is a good choice."
Nate R.,"Hillsboro, OR",0,9,1,3.0,9/11/2014,"Food is ok. Service is ok. They would benefit from a thermometer in the kitchen. I've come here many times, every time the food comes out raw. Food gets comped-but it's just annoying. Get that guy a thermometer in the back-it'll save the company some money."
Carly M.,"Colorado Springs, CO",19,102,11,5.0,6/15/2014,"We love this chain! Every time we have gone here I try something new and it is always so incredibly good.  They have really great drinks and I love their Tickled Pink! We have had their corn fritters and the chicken flatbread appetizers and both are super good! The burgers are so great! The fish and chips is really good, their beer batter is really amazing! Their sandwiches are insanely good! Especially the grilled chicken club! The pizza is also, yep you guessed it, great! i love the thick crust and they are always very accommodating when I ask for light sauce. Their menu is enormous which to some can be a downside but it means you can come here with a lot of people and everyone can have what they are craving! I personally cannot think of a better dessert than a giant cookie, freshly baked, with ice cream on top so their Pizzookies are my favorite dessert when we go out. they also have so many different kinds of Pizzookies that they have one for anyone! They do have other desserts but we have not tried them. My one downside is that their kid's macaroni and cheese is Kraft, which I feel like is  cop out for restaurants but so many of them do that now. The service here is usually pretty good, they do get pretty packed so sometimes it can be not as good as we would like but the servers are always very friendly here. Some places the servers will be rude to us with our daughter but here they always seem to try and please her first, they always bring her food out as soon as it is ready and keep her drink full."
Lee H.,"Hillsboro, OR",0,4,,2.0,4/8/2014,"I come here for their baked beignet but in two lunchtime experiences, they didn't have it and blamed the night manager. The meals themselves are very tasty, however it takes a long time for them to arrive. This place would be great under better management."
Cristi N.,"Hillsboro, OR",3,34,7,1.0,8/17/2014,"Not impressed. Tried this place a few times and have ordered something different each time, and still have yet to find anything that's all that good. Bland at best, I could make it myself at home. Very slow service.. even though it appeared my server only had like 3 tables at best."
Troy D.,"Hillsboro, OR",1,37,15,4.0,7/4/2014,"We love BJ's. It's a great place for some good pizza, better burgers, and by far the best root beer on the planet. I have yet to taste another root beer to rival it. The pazookies are amazing as well. A must have."
Lee W.,"Hillsboro, OR",0,22,19,4.0,2/17/2013,"Pretty darn good!  Showed up on a Friday night - no reservation.  There was open seating at the bar available, took only 12 minutes to wait for a table with 4 parties ahead of our twosome.  Service was decent and friendly, beer selection rocks.  I tried the jumbalaya....huge portion in a big bowl,  holy shnikes, that was so good!!!!   I will go back again, just not that often... my Jumbalaya and beer was a $20 bill, not too bad for price, but not something I can afford to do everyday.   You do need to try this place, at least once... clean, nice staff, decent atmosphere...great food, good beer - i'm a fan."
Lindsay H.,"Beaverton, OR",0,61,33,5.0,7/17/2014,"Ashton was our server, super friendly, great service. The food was delicious as always, we both had pizza- the hubbs had a mini 5 meat, I had a club flatbread. Both fabulous. Then came dessert and my word. We had the peanut butter s'mores pizookie and it was amaaaaaazing! Definitely get it! It's probably 3600 calories per person but worth every stinking calorie! :-)"
Srikanth V.,"Hillsboro, OR",0,4,1,5.0,10/19/2012,"Nice ambience with full bar!! Thin cut fries, beer, deep dish pizza and pizzookie - Signature BJs."
Allison B.,"Hillsboro, OR",72,67,1,5.0,5/28/2014,"Not bad, BJ's. Went here on Friday with a friend for a lunch outing. We were seated right away and our food was delivered super fast. Got in and out in under an hour which works for me."
Tom L.,"Zeeland, MI",1,66,4,4.0,4/21/2014,Stopped for lunch and service was prompt/personable. Worth the value and plenty of selections. I did the soup salad combo and was pleased with my meal.
Sweet P.,"Beaverton, OR",0,11,,5.0,8/25/2015,"I have visited this place few times and been in my favoutite list so far. Always had prompt & coreous customer service and did not have any bad experiences like few other reviews. I really like their salad and couple entries. The best part is the cookie & icecream combo - my god - it was like Heaven on earth. Just for the dessert I go here often :) The ambiance, seatings, food - everything works out good for me!"
