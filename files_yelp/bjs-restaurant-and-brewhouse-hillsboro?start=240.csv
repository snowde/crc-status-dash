Lilly R.,"Portland, OR",20,9,1,1.0,4/25/2016,"Let me start by saying that the food is good, it's the customer service that is getting 2 stars. I went in for dinner with my boyfriend as we had done a few times there, customer service hasn't always been the best but this time it really ticked me off..after waiting forever during a slow mid week late evening we finally got out VERY weak margaritas (literally tasted like a virgin margarita..ick) I ordered the bacon cheese burger with fries and my boyfriend got the same. They didn't ask how I wanted it cooked like most places do and I didn't think to make sure to say well done (never had to before anywhere else) when I got my burger it was very very pink. Now if it was just a little pink I would have been fine but this was REALLY pink, his was not. So I had to send it back and get it cooked again. They didnt make a new burger or fries, they threw my cut in half burger on the grill and brought me back a soggy bun, cold fries, greasy plate. By this time my boyfriend was done eating as it had been around 20 min before I got my good back. So instead of sending it back AGAIN I ate some of it because I was frustrated, hungry and ready to go. I didn't ask for my money back (which I should have that night) but like I said, I was flustered and just wanted to go. So they next day I called to speak with a manager and tell him about my experience and ask for a compensated burger on my next visit. He basically made me feel like a liar and complainer, and told me I should have done something about it that night. I explained how I felt that night and how I just wanted to leave out of frustration. He still did nothing. So, paying 50 dollars for 2 burgers and 2 margaritas you would think I would have had something done about this. End of story, I haven't been back and won't be going back."
Stacey S.,"Hillsboro, OR",0,17,,2.0,11/13/2014,"Very hard to get anyone's attention. You have to ask for everything you want before the waiter/waitress leaves your table because you never see them again.  The food is just regular brew house food - nothing special or extraordinary.  That is where they should score with service but they don't get it.  Staff seems bored and uninterested in you as a customer.  When going out with friends and someone wants to try BJ's, we discourage them.  No excuse for poor service - that is their job!"
Mike _.,"Portland, OR",1,43,,1.0,5/25/2014,"I am a big fan of BJ's,  but my last visit was terrible. It was not a busy time of day and the place was more than half empty. The service seemed fast until the pizzas arrived. Mine was cold so they offered to cook it longer. No offer to remake it or an apology. My pizza came back much hotter and stayed hotter than the first time for about 10 minutes, which makes me think my pizza sat for at least 10 minutes after it was cooked the first time. At this point we realized one of our drunks had never arrived. I asked and it came towards the end of the meal. Lastly,  I asked how the other pizza at our table was and they said cold, but no need to complain.  The check arrived and at that point I asked for the manager. The beer was great as always. However, l will not visit this location again."
Matt C.,"San Jose, CA",5,16,2,1.0,3/3/2014,"Four servers standing around doing nothing at 9pm on a Monday, but apparently no one can seat us. Eventually walked out."
Cyndi J.,"Hillsboro, OR",23,13,30,1.0,7/2/2013,"I've been to BJ's 3x and don't understand all the hype. The service is fake and the food is chain restaurant boring. The last visit the server got my order wrong and everyone in our party was more than half way through their meal before we could get the server's attention. Poor service, bland food and a long wait... 3 strikes BJ's and you're out!"
Allen M.,"Vancouver, WA",59,78,210,4.0,3/29/2013,"Let me start and say I picked this place because I was coming back from the beach and nothing else was open at 11pm.  Once I got inside I did like the dark lights witch they had in the bar area, nothing to bright in your eyes witch makes it much better for me.  The waiter was great and gave me a free meal because it took so long. Food was great some thing I will be coming back and trying again soon. I will give it 4 stars because I think this place is Great, Great menu and the food was super fresh."
David S.,"Beaverton, OR",0,2,,2.0,6/6/2014,Food was quite mediocre. 15$ entrees for something you could whip up at home. Broccoli was so raw it was hard to chew. Pasta dish literally was like a noodle roni or something. beer is good. Not worth the money.
Zach S.,"Southwest Portland, Portland, OR",0,35,1,1.0,10/24/2014,"Horrible service. Not sure what happened to this place but it has gone downhill fast. Wife ordered Alfredo and it was sent out with no sauce, no meat, just pasta. I ordered a pizza, which they came and told me they forgot about TWICE. The table next to me, also ordered pizza......gluten free and they couldn't bring out a gluten free pizza, they blamed the ""cooks"" who had ""gone home"", an hour and a half before closing time. Avoid this place, at all costs. It looks like a nice establishment but it's an unmanaged dump."
Ed J.,"Hillsboro, OR",0,63,5,1.0,2/12/2013,"Unimpressed.  After hearing all the hype and excitement while waiting for this place to open, I have to ask everyone....  Why?   I have been here 3 times now and came away disappointed each time.    My first experience was at lunch.  We had at least 3 different people waiting on us and none of them were fast, attentive, or even knew much about the menu.  They did, however, know a lot about their rewards program and proceeded to pitch it to us every 5 minutes throughout our meal.  I had the cajun pasta and immediately wished I had eaten in my work cafeteria instead.  The pasta was luke warm and consisted of sauce and chicken poured over a ball of pasta..which, at some point in it's life, had probably been a pile of individual noodles before hardening into the lump I was served. Trip number 2 was for appetizers, dinner, and beer (more on the beer later) while we watched the USC football game.  As a hot wing fanatic I was immediately drawn to their EXXXXXXXXtra Hot wings.  When I asked the server about them he went on to say that they were pretty hot and if I didn't like spicy food I should stick to the traditional or BBQ style.  Right On!!  Challenge accepted!   They must have gotten the order wrong because the wings I ate I would have had no problem serving to my 6 year old daughter.  Of all the adjectives I could use to describe them, ""hot"" isn't one of them.  The wings themselves were fairly poor quality pieces and I think I left roughly half of them uneaten.  Coming from a guy that has no problem packing away 20 plus wings during a football game, that's saying something.  Oh yeah.  Football.  They didn't have the game on.  In fact, they were unable to get ANY PAC-12 football games that weren't shown on national TV.   An Oregon sports bar that doesn't get PAC-12 football.  Good thinking. Trip 3 was just the other day.  I ordered the chicken fried steak.  Now, I have lived in or visited a lot of places across the US.  I have had chicken fried steak in the North, West, South, and Eastern parts of the US.  In every instance, gravy covering the breaded meat is a common theme.  Heck, even Denny's covers theirs with gravy.   Not BJ's.  Apparently country style gravy is a hard to come by commodity within the BJ's universe.  I got 2 large and heavily breaded pieces of shoe leather..i mean ""steaks"", with roughly a tablespoon of gravy  dribbled on the top.  I asked the waiter if I could get an additional side of gravy and was brought roughly another tablespoon.  Well, at least there was enough gravy to use for my small dollop of mashed potatoes. Now about Da Beers.   BJ's ""brew house"" is a name.  What it should be called is,"" BJ's massed produced mediocre beers"".  A place like this may be a marvel of sorts to the beer drinkers of places like Pawhuska, Oklahoma or similar podunk areas where anything other than Budweiser is a rare treat, but  In the PNW where we have such a large variety of GOOD craft beer makers and brew pubs,  it is an insult to everyone else that makes beer around here to call this place a ""brew house"".  We had a 6 beer sampler of which 3 were undrinkable.  Mind you my only criteria for beer is that it is cold....and yet, i let those 3 sit.  Of the beers that actually taste decent, I can't say anything remarkable about them or find a compelling reason why someone should make a trip specifically to taste them. I'm pretty patient and willing to give most places the benefit of the doubt before just writing them off completely.  I think I have a pretty good idea of what to expect from BJ's after 3 trips in their resturant and don't see myself ever stepping foot in their door again."
Randy F.,"Las Vegas, NV",61,13,,5.0,8/21/2013,"Best service and great food!  Our server, Ryan, was personable and genuinely friendly.  He was knowledgeable of the menu.  I had the Parmesan Crusted Chicken and a Tatonka Stout.  It is by far one of the best meals I've ever had."
Erin C.,"Portland, OR",6,30,2,2.0,6/1/2013,Don't bother going for lunch - 90 minutes is barely enough time to get your food to go.
Steve A.,"Beaverton, OR",10,22,1,2.0,6/27/2014,Very disappointed with the baby back ribs. They were grainy and fatty and had no flavor at all. On the bright side the beer was cold and the salad was fresh.. Second time trying the ribs and the last time for me. Front Row is just down the street and has way better quality .
Brandy T.,"Salem, OR",1,10,1,4.0,1/18/2014,Pretty good food. Store made rootbeer wasn't all it was made out to be. Portions adequate for price. Busy night so wait time was a bit long.
Kathy C.,"Bedford, MA",20,15,4,2.0,12/26/2012,The service is slow and not treating us respectfully. We have waited almost 1hr after ordering. Drinks are not satisfying.
Denea Y.,"Seattle, WA",12,232,4,3.0,4/30/2013,"Two things saved this review: my mom declaring the jambalaya to be the best she ever had (if you like a spicy kick, you'll agree) and our server was sweet and attentive. I disliked all the beers in our sampler and the berry cider tasted like a bad wine cooler. The Thai lettuce wraps were better than I expected but their famed Mahi Mahi was bland and overcooked. I don't plan on revisiting."
Richtpt U.,"Portland, OR",23,24,14,1.0,4/19/2013,"The service was bad, we rarely saw her.  The food was not great.  Thankfully the manager took it off our bill, but we won't be going back anytime soon.  My wife and I ordered burgers.  I asked for no pickles, tomato's, onions, but everything else.  It came with no sauce, totally dry, and pickles, and tasted like pickles.  My wife ordered hers well done and it came so charcoaled that's all she could taste.  Their beer is really not that good, very blah.  The only good thing was the manager taking our food off the bill.  If I were 20-something with a bunch of friends just munching on appetizers and drinking I might go back, but not with my family.  Oh, and the parking sucked big time!!"
Mark B.,"Portland, OR",63,26,8,4.0,11/11/2013,Great service even when they are packed.  Less wait for your order if you sit up by the bar area.
Alison P.,"Portland, OR",115,34,,2.0,11/6/2012,"This was my first time at BJ's and there is a strong possibility it will be my last. Here's the thing: The food was fine. Our server was incredibly nice. The biggest issue? They smother the hell out of you the second you walk through the door. I went with my Mom, and were greeted by the hostess, who seemed to be counting down the hours until her shift was finished. She sat us, and then proceeded to ramble a speech at us, telling us about some sort of seasonal beer. Honestly, I felt bad for her. I've had to do the awkward ""I had to memorize this shpeal even though I really have no idea what I'm saying"" thing before, but at least make it personable. Don't talk at me like a robot then say ""anyquestionsnokenjoy"" in one breath and walk away. Anywho, there was that. Literally not a minute later, our server comes up. And guess what. There's another shpeal. Luckily, he had some pep to his step and didn't drag it out, so that was good. He leaves. Maybe two minutes later...he's back. Takes our drink order. Finally, I get a minute to breathe and take a look at the menu. He delivers our drinks, and gives us  little more time. We order, everything is grand. Server brings us our food. Not even a full bite into the meal, he comes and asks how everything is. I awkwardly, nod, with my mouth full of salad, and give a thumbs up. About 10 minutes later...HE'S BACK. Asking if we want dessert. My mom and I give him a weird look, and he explains that their signature dessert takes about 20 minutes to make, and they like to ask mid-meal so you don't ask for it afterwards and have to wait for it. We politely decline, and get back to our meal. I get it. It's not really their fault. BJ's is training them to do this...whatever. Our waiter was very nice, and just doing his job. But it drove me batty to have to stop, mid conversation 4 or 5 times, to get rambled at about some shitty pumpkin beer that I'm not going to try. Unless my folks want to give that place another shot, I'm fine with never going back there again."
Food H.,"Hillsboro, OR",11,97,124,4.0,9/8/2013,"Been here several times for late night drinks and snacks. Specially on weekend. I usually try the beer sampler? amber oasis beer. In desserts, try to hot fudge brownie with vanilla icecream. I have tried cajun style pasta and it was  quite good."
April F.,"Forest Grove, OR",75,6,,3.0,11/1/2014,"Went this past Saturday night for my husbands birthday. The entrance is in the back of the building, facing the road-- by the time you get to it, youre soaked. Loved the exuberant greeting from the gentleman who seated us! Our waitress was efficient and very polite. My drink was so-so, but my husband loved both his beer choices. We were WAY unimpressed with the boneless ""wings""- very bland Parmesan garlic sauce, and 5 of the 10 pieces were the size of a quarter- high cost of $10.25. My husband liked the jambalaya, and I enjoyed my honey lime scallops, although the portion was small for the price. Fair peach cobbler , the cornmeal tasted strange. Hubby enjoyed his bday cookies & cream dessert. I don't know if we'd choose it for a nice dinner alone again. It was very loud, and where we were seated was almost cafeteria style seating- hard to chat,etc. We might try again."
