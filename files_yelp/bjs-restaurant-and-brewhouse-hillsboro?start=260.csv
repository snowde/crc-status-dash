Megan R.,"Hillsboro, OR",9,21,7,2.0,8/27/2013,"We were super excited to have a new restaurant in town, and went there the day they opened. With the trainers there, everything we exceptional. Unfortunately a couple weeks later and my experience fell flat. Service is mediocre and food was not good (raw chicken). The restaurant is very noisy, which is great if you have kids. The only thing I really enjoyed was the pizza, everything else was just ok. However it is nice to have some place to go that's open late and can accommodate large parties. We just wish it was better..."
Adam L.,"Hillsboro, OR",0,28,,1.0,11/25/2013,Sorry but I have been to BJ twice now for happy hour and both time I have had poor service. Slow food time and they seem to always be out of coors and bud. I know they make their own beer but if you always out of regular beer maybe its time to realize your own beer sucks.
Rashmi K.,"San Jose, CA",1,67,1,3.0,7/1/2013,The cocktails were good and food decent. However this place seems pricey for what we get
Andrew B.,"Freedom, WI",47,45,,4.0,5/22/2013,"Good Brew. Great Food. We will be back. Atmosphere is fun. Kind of like a BWW but with pizza, and the pizza is great."
Jeffrey J.,"Gaston, OR",15,14,,4.0,10/5/2013,"We tried the place on a whim and were pleasantly surprised at the results. The food was very tasty and the staff was very friendly. The only real negative was that the service was fairly slow, but it was also a busy Friday night when we visited so that may well have had an impact. The brewed sodas are actually better than the Weinhardt ones we have loved in the past, and they actually sell them in growlers like with their regular beer selection. I think I can safely say that we will be returning in the future."
Trina S.,"Portland, OR",0,14,,2.0,11/29/2012,Food is good....If you have an hour and half to wait for it! Worst service i've ever had. 15 mins before your server even comes to the table to get your drink order. Multiple time's had to ask for sweetener for my tea. Another 15-20 mins to get our check off the table so we could leave...server disappeared!  First time was okay...second time was just like the last time. 3 times your out of my go to restaurant list.  Won't be back!
Erica Z.,"Forest Grove, OR",3,39,,4.0,4/3/2013,"Very friendly and helpful staff.  The food was ok for the price, but what really impressed me was the beer.  I was with a group and we all tried different beers.  Each one was surprisingly good. I would go back again for appetizers and drinks."
J S.,"Salem, OR",0,3,,3.0,12/3/2012,"Went for the first time last night. Service was okay, not great. Took quite a long time to be able to place our food orders...no problem getting anyone to take drink orders though. Waiter was lukewarn on hospitality.  Personally I had the grilled turkey burger with wedge fries. The burger was wonderful...very moist. My father had the roast beef dip which he said was very salty. Both my brother and father's skinny fries were cold and since our waiter was next to impossible to get they didn't complain because who knew how long it would be for replacements.  Overall, it is a run of the mill brew pub. And FYI, since it is new, the floors are slippery."
Xochitl V.,"Portland, OR",6,79,60,4.0,3/19/2013,"The food here is delicious but the service is very slow.  The food is very good here and very nice presentation.  We always start off with the avocado eggrolls that are so delicious!  I love the flatbread pizza and the chicken quesadilla, very tasty!  If we make room for desert we'll have a Pazooki.  A warm and freshly baked cookie with ice cream on the top, very yummy!  The My husband and I usually come here for lunch and it always takes a long time to get our food.  Whenever my husband suggest coming here for lunch, I usually tell him I want to go elsewhere.  It takes at least 30 minutes to get our food.  Sometimes we get our appetizer for desert :(.  There was one time we did and experiment with my husband.  We usually order water because it's the healthiest.  And please note that just because we order water, we are not cheap.  My husband is a very good tipper.  This one time we ordered drinks just to see if we would get our food faster and it worked!  either that or we got a good waiter.  The following time we ordered water and it took forever to get our food again.  3 Star, food is great for service is super slow, so if you in to eat during lunch time, just be prepared to have a long wait.  One last note, they play good music.  They play 80's new wave as well as 90's alternative."
Scott A.,"Forest Grove, OR",0,3,,4.0,1/2/2014,"BJ brewed beers all suck.  But they have a very good top sirloin, 1.5"" thick and cooked to a perfect medium rare for $16. They have other beers on tap which are good."
Clay D.,"Vancouver, WA",6,19,1,2.0,4/21/2013,"Menu is too big. This is my first time going to BJ's and I was confused to what they are known for. They have pizza, pasta, burgers, and etc... Waiter told me they started as a pizza business, but he recommended their burgers. So I started off with some hot wings. The chicken was brought out to me and the hot sauce was on the side. It was like eating fried chicken wings, not good. For my main course I had a regular cheeseburger. The slice of cheese was super thin, and the burger lacked flavor. The beer is not good enough to keep me coming back here and drown out the taste of food."
M S.,"Beaverton, OR",0,21,7,5.0,8/18/2013,"Took the family here on a Friday evening. We only had to wait 15 mins to be seated.  I was bit taken back by the size of the menu when it was placed in front of me but was able to get some recommendations from the very friendly helpful server. They had a great beer selection too. I had a the California burger and thought it was great. I really liked that it is a very kid friendly restaurant. I was however a little disappointed with the red velvet pizookie, after reading all of the great reviews on it.  I just didn't think it was all that great. We will definitely be going back for the food and beer though."
Brian I.,"West Linn, OR",62,256,33,3.0,1/3/2013,"So... BJ's.  I was ambivalent when I saw the building going up and signs announcing their impending arrival.  My thought was... ""this chain is still around?"".  There was one at like... 9th & Weidler in NE that we used to visit semi-frequently when we lived nearby.  It was A-OK in Yelp terms.  I've been to this BJ's, and guess what? A-OK. The place is big.  Seriously big.  It's almost a remnant from a time that has seen it's heyday expire: giant footprint (and corresponding overhead) that packs 'em in and gets 'em out efficiently in order to maximize revenue.  The entrance houses a desk and host types along with a foyer for waiting.  Trust me, if you go during prime dinner hours you're gonna wait.  The place is busy.  To the left (facing inside standing in the foyer) is the bar, straight ahead and to the right is the restaurant.  Lots of activity.  The interior is tastefully done and not intrusive.  No ""flair"" like trinkets on the wall that you'll see at Chili's (R.I.P.) or Friday's (also R.I.P.).  Just subtle lighting and subdued colors.  I like this.  The bar area is fine.  The (non-booth) seating looks a bit cramped, but I can't confirm or deny this, because it was completely full while we were there.  So, we stood.  No biggie.  I had a pint of BJ's brown ale, and it wasn't shabby!  One difference (improvement) between this iteration of BJ's and the store that we frequented on Weidler: the new version doesn't limit themselves to BJ's beers only.  They have a wide, wide selection of beer, including Mac & Jack's (always a bonus). Eventually our buzzer went off and we were seated in the dining room.  Small 2 person booth (which was perfectly fine).  The servers are all bright eyed and bushy tailed and obviously freshly trained up through BJ's corporate procedures.  Our server was friendly and attentive.  We had some chips and salsa (A-OK), wife had some kinda salad (A-OK) and I had a basic burger (A-OK).  I'm reading that their pizza is better than average, so I will commit to trying that next.  Yes, there will be a next time.  We had intended to use a gift card that we received, but there was nothing on the card when we attempted to redeem it.  Our server admitted there had been a ""glitch"" with the gift cards when they initially opened, and several cards went out with no $ amounts on them.  Be warned.  They're good about getting the proper amount loaded, provided you can show some kinda proof that you purchased it initially. I had a pizookie.  Once.  No need to have another.  If you're HUGE into dessert, then sure, go ahead and splurge.  I'm not, and don't need it again.  I will check out BJ's again sometime though, for sure.  Gotta see how the pizza is."
Scott W.,"Albany, OR",0,11,,5.0,11/21/2013,"The beer is fantastic, I love the Blonde Ale. The other day I had a steak that was cooked to perfection. The hamburgers are very good but the french fries are blah. The service is top notch even when it is a packed house. It does get very loud when its full so expect to almost yell to hold a conversation. One last thing, they need to update the desert menu, Pizookie's get boring after awhile."
Tammy D.,"Beaverton, OR",0,32,,3.0,11/20/2013,"Always a long wait and its very noisy, good for parties not anything romantic or if you want to talk to tablemates. Its a bit overpriced for what you get but most everything we have tried was tasty and they make a nice drink."
Arun R.,"Vancouver, Canada",2,105,93,4.0,3/6/2013,"For a chain, I think BJs is pretty good. I've gone there multiple times. My favorite food here is the crispy jalapeno burger. Their bruschetta is delicious too."
Colleen B.,"Pipersville, PA",4,41,,4.0,10/30/2012,I agree with some of the other reviews...I was blown away by the food!!! We had the fish tacos very tasty!!! Our bartender was so friendly we had a great night...I think his name was Gwanye!!!!
J Z.,"Wellington, FL",3,84,27,5.0,10/8/2012,"First time and loved it...ask for the best servers.... Nicole, Tiffany and Hollie. They made sure that we had the best experience at this new place. Huge ribs and great pizza!"
Jason E.,"Tanasbourne, OR",6,4,,2.0,10/1/2013,The last two time we have come to bj's we have had good service but they have managed to mess up one of our dishes every time. Not sure about a return trip I don't want to wonder if I'm going to get a good meal
Sharon M.,"Portland, OR",24,175,3,3.0,10/10/2012,"I always liked BJ's when I ate there in Southern California, and sometimes I would go out of my way to eat at the one in Jantzen Beach.  I really am happy they opened one in Hillsboro.  Considering they opened the beginning of the month, it seems like they are already in the swing of things.  here were 5 of us in the group, and we got seated right away.  The waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu, an service was quite good.  For a chain restaurant, everything was good.  I had a new item - a quesadilla, and I was surprised it had so much flavor.  My husband's pasta was a little over cooked, and they were out of their homemade cream soda.  Maybe next time.  Overall, it was a fine experience."
