Natalie T.,"Hillsboro, OR",42,13,10,2.0,11/26/2012,"Stick with pizza, it's what they do best. The pazookie is awesome. But order it early because it takes a while."
Cami M.,"Hillsboro, OR",48,2,,1.0,8/7/2013,"My first time at BJ's was an incredible slow experience.  The food was fair, but waiting 20 minutes from the time they dropped off our check to actually picking them up to run our cards was a little long.  Despite that I decided to return again and give them a second shot. I arrived with a group of 6 friends, was seated quickly and given our drinks.  Unfortunately that's when the problems began.  When they brought out our entrees everyone was given theirs except me.  I was told mine would be out shortly, but as a few minutes dragged into 10 minutes I was starting to get annoyed.  I saw awkwardly watching half of my friends eating their food and the other half letting their food get cold because they didn't want to eat until everyone was served.  One friend ordered a salad that was missing the chicken and got her chicken replaced way quicker than my entree was brought out.  A decent thing to do would have been to offer me something to eat while I waited for my meal, but at BJ's I really think they just don't care. Despite all the problems we decided to order dessert.  Our waiter took our orders than walked away before our final person got a chance to order hers.  We didn't see him again for a while so my friend didn't even bother trying to order her dessert at that point.  When they brought the desserts out yet again, he brought everyone's dessert except mine.  I only had a to wait a couple minutes this time, but I was perturbed that it happened not once but twice in the same trip.  Our waiter did nothing to try and better the situation. I went home and wrote a letter to the manager letting him know how our meal went and that it was unacceptable.  I had hoped I would get some sort or response or apology, but that would be asking too much of them.  If you care at all about good service and having an enjoyable experience, then stay away from here."
Harvey B.,"Beaverton, OR",2,36,,5.0,3/10/2014,"BJ's Might just be some letters to some people but to me BJ's equals A+.  Besides their menu beinf=g the size of Webster's dictionary & the food being really good, the customer service is as good as it gets.  Last week I was in there for a business lunch.  When I reached into my back pocket to get my wallet & show them Premier rewards card I realized that I had left my wallet home.  Her I was, expecting a client to join me for lunch at any minute, having no wallet & very little cash in my pocket.  I asked the Hostess if I could run a tab, I would then go home, right after lunch & return with my wallet to pay.  She said that they don't really have any way to do that, but, she would check with the Manager.  When Melissa, thje Manager came out I explained my situation & told her that I eat here all the time.   server, who happened to be standing nearby said, Hi, to me, & told Melissa that yes I did eat here pretty regularly.  Melissa told the hostess that it was OK to do what I suggested.  Well, after a very enjoyable lunch, I got the check & much to my surprise Melissa had ""comp'd"" the whole meal.  Now, I don't know about anyone else, I conseder that customer service to rate an A+ in my book.  It also guarantees BJ's that I will be a customer for a VERY LONG TIME."
Adriana R.,"Hillsboro, OR",1,46,7,2.0,5/22/2014,Food is good but service sucks! Servers take forever to attend and food takes over 20 minutes to get to the table. Plus either the waiters or the cooks mess up on my order or friend's order each time we go there.
Daman O.,"Hillsboro, OR",2,9,,2.0,1/8/2013,"I've been to this restaurant a couple of times now. I first went the week it opened. They were still training their staff and were really busy, so I gave them a pass for a very ho-hum experience.  But there's no excuse this second time around. We had one person come over and tell us she'd be our waitress. Then another person came by and started taking drink orders. We told her we were ready to order food too, so she started taking those orders. Then the original person came over and helped out with taking food orders (we had a party of 9). A third person delivered all of our drinks and didn't know who ordered what. A fourth person delivered the soup, and he didn't know who ordered them and in which sizes. He also didn't bring soup spoons. The salads came out and we had to wait a bit for the dressing to be delivered. No one came by the whole time we were eating to see how the food was. Water was refilled once across the hour plus we were there. I had unlimited soup and salad. I knew that it would take them a while to bring out refills, so I ordered more soup and salad while I was still finishing my first batch. It still took them 10 minutes after I finished to bring out the refills.  Basically, the service was pretty pathetic. The food was fine. I would go here again just because it's close to work and the lunch prices are pretty decent, but I'll know to expect poor service. I won't look forward to going here again like I did the first time, but it's not a terrible restaurant for people to try out."
Mike C.,"Hillsboro, OR",0,4,,1.0,10/4/2014,"Been here 4 times with the family.  The first time was fine but it's been downhill ever since.  The food is fine, the problem is the service.  One time the order was just messed up and two other times the wait time was lllooonnnggg.  I'm not sure why as I see servers on the move and others working briskly. So it must be the kitchen, some hold up in there.  If the food didn't get good scores I wouldn't see a reason to go."
Kristen P.,"Hillsboro, OR",0,1,,1.0,6/11/2013,"I downloaded the Yelp app just to write a review about BJ's in Hillsboro. This is the second time we've eaten here; we came back after last time to see if the service had gotten better... It hasn't.  Our waitress was nice, but had to apologize multiple times for forgetting things. We arrived at 9:35 and were immediately seated (it was a Tuesday night and there weren't more than 15 tables occupied). At 9:50, our waitress finally came over to take our drink order. She brought our drinks and took our food order at 10:00 (10 minutes to get two sodas?!).  I ordered a side salad to go with my pasta dish- the salad came out relatively quickly, but we were never given silverware, so I had to flag the waitress down and ask for it. She said, ""Yes, that would help! I'll bring it right out."" 10 minutes later, as she walked past our table, she exclaimed ""Oh!"" when she saw that I was now eating the croutons with my fingers. She brought the silverware out 4 minutes later.  By this time, we were out of drinks, and had to ask the waiter who brought out our food for a refill. He told our waitress that we needed a refill and she said, ""They're on their way out!"". Our refills arrived 5 minutes later. Between the extremely slow service, constant forgetfulness, and overall frustration we felt here, we will not be returning. It's too bad, too, since they have a nice atmosphere and decent food."
Thomas N.,"Tempe, AZ",0,1,,5.0,4/25/2013,Great customer service! Mike D. and his staff went above and beyond from start to finish.  They were more than accommodating during the initial large party reservation process and got me out of a bind on short notice. The wait staff and kitchen did a fabulous job serving a 30 person party over a 4 hour period during peak dinner hours.  No one was missed or ignored and everyone got their drinks and food...not an easy task without a fixed menu. Mike D. even bailed me out again by sending a copy of the lost receipt with just a simple phone call...truly exceptional customer service. Thanks to Mike D and staff!
JP S.,"Hillsboro, OR",0,4,1,1.0,4/15/2013,"Warning: This will be a long one! I have never been soooo disappointed in a restaurant in a great while, but BJ's Hillsboro takes the cake! We were there last night and I can honestly say it was THE WORST dining experience I've had in recent history. My husband and I arrived there at 6:55 and only had to wait to be seated for a couple of minutes. We were still waiting for 3 people so we didn't mind the wait. A waiter appeared appeared after 5 minutes and asked us for drinks and appetizers so we ordered a diet coke and the house brewed root beer with the lettuce wraps and calamari. This was around 7:05, the rest of our party came at around 7:20, none of our drinks nor the appetizers have made an appearance yet. We waited for the waiter to appear to take our friend's drink orders but he didn't approach our table until it was 7:30- 7:35 with mine and my husband's drinks, by that time we all knew what we wanted so we made our orders. My husband ordered the 12 oz. rib eye medium rare, I ordered the grilled pork chops, our friends ordered miso salmon, chicken salad and the BJ cheeseburger without pickles and tomatoes. The waiter took our order and then began the longest wait EVER!!! Our friends drinks came at around 8:00, but still no sign of our appetizers. The glass that the orange cream soda came in was filthy, we had to ask for another. Oh and the cutlery had sooo much spots that I was tempted to ask for replacement but we just wiped them with our serviettes. By 8:15 the appetizers finally came. By this time, the whole table were pretty much pissed off. It took an hour for the appetizers to come, I mean seriously did they have to catch the squid themselves??? By 830 our orders still have not come and when we asked the waiter what was taking so long he responded by saying that he too, was wondering why our table was still empty! Really??? We wanted to walk out already. My friend ordered a salad, how long does it take to make it? He came back a few minutes later with our orders, the 12 oz rib eye was supposed to be medium rare but it looked like it had been sitting on the warmer for too long as the steam veggies and rice looked like they've seen better days and the steak was definitely NOT medium rare, the mashed potato on my grilled pork chops was so dry and the knife was so hot like it was placed on a warmer. The chicken salad's lettuce were all WILTED like it was made first and then just left sitting out. The cheese burger had 5 pieces of pickles when it was specifically requested to be taken out. The miso salmon was still not there and the waiter said it was delivered to the wrong table. it was already 9pm at this time. We were seriously annoyed already and we were about to cancel his miso salmon when the manager came and said there had been a mix-up in the back and that the order will be comped because of the delay. Like it would cover up the fact that we have been there for two hours already! WORST service EVER!!! Will definitely NOT be coming back for so-so food that I can get at other places where I don't have to wait for hours for my food to come!!! AWFUL! AWFUL! AWFUL service!!!"
Dwight P.,"Albuquerque, NM",2,32,,3.0,3/30/2014,"Kind of an upscale Applebees, but the food is better, service exceptional.  Try the avocado-bacon, etc. appetizer.  Different and really good taste.  Burgers are huge, and cooked to order, fries are just standard in my opinion.  Had the fish and chips, which were very good.  Five moderate sized pieces with a decent coating, and piping hot.  They have a pretty decent root beer, also.  Not some place I would frequent a lot, but good enough for an occasional night out."
Amy K.,"Portland, OR",24,6,7,2.0,1/26/2013,"BEWARE!  They told us there was a 20-25 minute wait to be seated.  It took AN HOUR to be seated.  With two little kids it was rough.  The food was so-so, the server was nice but rushed."
Jeff P.,"Portland, OR",2,9,,1.0,5/7/2013,Probably the worst and slowest service I have experienced in Portland.  I complained to the Manager who basically shrugged his shoulders.  I won't be back.  Food was average to below-average.
Stacey A.,"Beaverton, OR",0,6,,3.0,11/14/2012,"We love BJ's and have been to many around the country. I have however been pretty disappointed with this location in particular. We have been in three times now and I have just thought the slow service was a result of a recent opening, but at this point I feel like they should have more kinks worked out. We always wait a long time for food and drinks and tonight we even had to ask if we could order.  On the positive side, the food is good and I still have hope that they can improve."
Frank A.,"Hillsboro, OR",15,3,,1.0,2/17/2013,"Supposedly, this chain was started by two guys who had a great recipe for deep dish pizza. Having lived around Chicago and having had decent deep dish pizza, all I can surmise is that somewhere along the line, this ""great"" recipe has been lost. Chintzy on the ingredients and short on flavor, the food here was obviously designed for profit margin, not for taste. Bland, boring, and unchallenging, it's no wonder this place is close to Intel - it's as close to an engineered environment and menu you can get without having the food made out of silicon. And you pay top dollar for what they serve. Bad value, insipid food, and I see no reason why this place is as packed as it always seems to be. Simply dreadful. Avoid, avoid, avoid..."
Steve B.,"Thompson-Nicola Regional District, Canada",0,41,,3.0,10/5/2012,Just opened and was excited to go this week while on business. Service was abit chaotic as it was busy and many staff around. Good food though. Would definately go again.
loyalty d.,"Sacramento, CA",15,7,3,2.0,1/24/2014,"Me and my husband came in tonight round 9:30 service and food wasn't good,food was cold we had to ask for water half way through our dinner,"
Carrie W.,"Portland, OR",35,8,,1.0,3/8/2014,"Came here for lunch - 1st time.  Ordered the cobb salad.....was super disappointed.  It was chopped up iceberg and that's about it.  There was about 5 little pieces of tomato, two little...little pieces of bacon and nothing else!  I had to ask for more bacon.  I'm not sure what this was, but they charged me almost $10 for it."
Alyessa D.,"Goodyear, AZ",69,26,6,4.0,11/8/2012,"So BJ's in new in our area. It was alright. The wait was about 25 minutes for a family of 4, which can be hard to do when you have a little one that wants to run all over the place. So by the time we were finally seated she was pretty much over it. Although, I did hear people say that they had reservations and they were seated right away. And some of them were just partys of 2. So I think if we go back we will just do that! This was a spontaneous trip, so there wasn't time for a reservation. The food was good, the beer was ok. The atmosphere was nice. The wood floors were terribly dangerous with the highchairs though. Our daughter is onyl 9 months old and was able to scoot her high chair all over the place on the slippery wood floor. You could see all of the parents were having problems with that too. Obviously they need to buy dinfferent high chairs or put non skid pads on the bottom or something. VERY DANGEROUS. Don't buy the wings, they are a waste of money. Go to BWW or something for wings, dont go here."
Bryan R.,"Beaverton, OR",41,13,,2.0,4/14/2013,"How did they mess up a chicken tender salad?  Not sure, but I'm waiting for the waitress to come back so I can get the hell out of here..."
Qianna Q.,"Hillsboro, OR",0,1,,5.0,12/24/2013,"Salad... It is not something I ever order in ANY restaurant. Why? Because most restaurants have either a ""wedge"" salad (which is I-am-a-lazy-chef-type-of-salad), or a skimpy lettuce, a piece of tomato, a ring of onion, and a choice of dressing. Not BJ's! Being a carnivore, I was surprised to see a wonderful selections of salads, especially a seared Ahi salad. It was chopped perfectly, where it was enjoyable to pick up a fork-full with most of ingredients in the same bite... and... the dressing was done perfectly!!! THIS is the salad I would come back for again!"
