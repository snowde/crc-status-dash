Walnut N.,"Meridian, ID",0,22,,2.0,12/21/2012,I liked this place when it first opened but it quickly has went downhill. Bad service. Takes forever to get food. Dishes come out missing ingredients. They are also spendy. Would not recommend this place anymore.
Anu G.,"Hillsboro, OR",0,28,,3.0,5/2/2013,They have some really good cocktails and their food is good too. I am not too impressed with their pizzas though.
Jessica F.,"Hillsboro, OR",6,7,,2.0,10/15/2012,"Went in on a Tuesday night, the place was pretty busy had to wait about 20 minutes for our table. Once seated our server came over right away, she was very pleasant and attentive. She brought our drinks and appetizers in a  timley manner. The appetizers were ""okay"". We ordered the crispy artichoke hearts and stuffed mushrooms. The artichoke hearts were pretty good and came with an aioli dip, I would probably order these again. The mushrooms weren't hot when they arrived and were really just ok We did end up waiting a very long time for our entrees...Once they arrived my fiances burger was over cooked and  mine was cold. We don't usually send food back but we did...They brought out my fiances burger again within about 10-15 minutes and it was perfect, I had to wait close to another 10 minutes after his dish arrived for the second time to get my food. It came out hot, but it wasn't an amazing dish. The manager was very apologetic and did not want to make any excuses and really wanted to make us happy. All in all the people they have working there are really great, at least on the floor. The food was really just not anything special, If we go back we will probably just order the pizza which actually looked really good."
Kristina N.,"Hillsboro, OR",0,2,,5.0,10/26/2012,"It was my first time here and I decided to be lazy and get curbside carryout. The service was prompt and friendly even when the place seemed pretty busy, judging by the packed parking lot. The avocado egg rolls were tasty and loaded with avocado. The Fried artichoke were good as well and came with an awesome dipping sauce. The Husband got a pot roast sandwich that was the favorite even though it was a bit heavy on the mash and light on the roast.I got the mahi mahi tacos which tasted as i expected.. All around it was a very pleasant and fast experience,"

Sam T.,"Portland, OR",0,15,,3.0,2/12/2013,Came in for dinner the other night..foods okay... Just the music is alittle loud.
Jake J.,"Beaverton, OR",0,39,,3.0,11/8/2012,Good gathering place for drinks after work.  Appetizers are above average and reasonably priced but - unless you want pizza - the meals are ho hum.
Jeremy r.,"Beaverton, OR",2,3,,1.0,7/13/2013,"The only reason they get one star is because I cant give them no stars.  Tonight I took my girlfriend out to dinner and we decided to stop at BJ's.  We were promptly seated which was contrary to what I had read on Yelp about the wait times for a table.  That is where the good portion of the experience ended.  We sat at the table for 30 minutes and were completely ignored.  We never received even a glass of water.  We tried to get the attention of several servers to see if we could get a water or drink order at least.  After our attempts to flag down a server were ignored we finally walked out without ever having any of the servers stopping despite our attempts to flag them down.  We went next door to On The Border and were promptly seated, drink orders were at our table within the first 5 minutes.  We expressed our thanks and explained our experience at BJ's and the server stated they get a lot of foot traffic from people who get frustrated at BJ's and leave.  If this is the kind of service they are providing they really need to fire the staff and start fresh.  It is completely unacceptable."
Leslie M.,"Hillsboro, OR",0,4,,2.0,6/22/2013,"This is my first time posting a review, and this restaurant made me post.  I was so not impressed...everything on their huge menu is NOT good.  Granted, I've only been here the one time, but unless someone wants to go there who I'm with, I won't be going again. Their pizzas looked good from what I saw, and I should have just gotten one, but wanted something different.  I got a side salad, which was just a bagged iceberg mix; that in itself is so cheap and un-classy.  How hard is it to chop some romaine and leafy green lettuce for a salad, or actually chop fresh carrots, etc?  I ordered the open face pot roast sandwich.  The description sounded really good; it had their white cheddar mashed potatoes on top of garlic bread with the meat and all slathered with gravy.  The flavor of the gravy and whatnot was good...but, the bread was super dry and tasted like it was two weeks old.  The potatoes were nicely flavored, but a bit gummy, so had obviously been left in the mixer much too long.  And the meat, what there was of it, was at least half fat that I had to spit out.  The meat I tasted was very tender and flavorful, but there was like, maybe 3 oz of it, tops.  The waitress felt bad and said she would have brought me something else if I'd said something; I would have said something had she come by our table even once after we were served to ask how it was.  But once I was done, what's the point?  I'm not the type to make a big stink.  She was nice, but once we were served, as I said, we didn't see her at all until I moved my plate to the corner of the table and was obviously done.  Even then she asked if we wanted a box, didn't ask how it was.  Oy.  Go to the Border's next door instead.  The rootbeer was the best part of the meal, which isn't saying much."
Erica H.,"Beaverton, OR",74,15,1,3.0,6/15/2013,"I have been a fan of BJ's for years. I have been to several other locations in a couple different states. There used to be a location in Lloyd Center area, and I have also been to the one in Jantzen Beach several times.  I would drive across town from Beaverton for their pizza and pizzookie.  But unfortunately, they have changed their pizza crust.  It used to be one of the best deep dish pizzas you could eat (spoken as an Oregonian who has never actually had Chicago style pizza in Chicago) from a chain restaurant.  However, now the pizza, which used to come in the pan and was thick, buttery, and delicious, now comes on a plate and should not really be considered Chicago-style or deep dish at all.  So disappointing.  I know it's not the fault of this location specifically, since it's a chain, but I was so excited there was going to be one close by, and now I am more prone to go to Old Chicago right down the road, which was there all along, if I want good deep dish pizza."
