Kurt A.,"Hillsboro, OR",0,8,,5.0,6/23/2017,My favorite local hang out. Bartenders are Kewl and very friendly. Love the barbacoa chicken is my favorite at the moment. Great food and atmosphere.
Broc O.,"Ridgefield, WA",4,7,6,3.0,7/7/2017,"Went here while on a trip to Hillsboro, the place itself looked really nice. I ordered the Nashville chicken sandwich, nothing special. The waiters didn't seem too happy to be there but what waiter does I guess. The appetizer of mozzarella sticks came and you could tell they were frozen. Dried parsley on top and parmesan, it wasn't very good. Main food came and it was just okay. Wasn't bad, wasn't great, and the fries were sub-par. One thing I will say is that the restaurant itself was BEAUTIFUL. Outdoor seating was awesome and the bathroom were super cool. Cool hangout place, not the greatest food."
Katie F.,"Hillsboro, OR",0,5,,2.0,10/12/2017,"If you can get past the rude, unprofessional absolute horrible hostesses at the front door, you'll have a great meal! We have been several times for dinner, food is great and so are the servers. The girls who seat you however could give two shits about your dining experience! They roll their eyes, no smile, barely acknowledge you and tonight slammed our menus down on a dirty table. Count us out!!"
Kristin F.,"Portland, OR",66,11,,1.0,6/1/2017,"We ordered nachos and got a cup of marinara, plain chips, and some guacamole. It's advertised to be cheese, jalapeño, chicken, sour cream, and guacamole. This place is bad."
Lexi L.,"Hillsboro, OR",0,3,,5.0,10/11/2017,"Angel is outstanding! She's our server nearly every time we come, and is always wonderful at managing all of her tables' requests as well as making her guests feel taken care of. The food is always good and their specials are always something to look forward to."
Cc A.,"Hillsboro, OR",2,68,11,1.0,4/23/2016,"Brunchers beware. Their staff apparently does not want to be up so early (11am) because they are extremely grumpy. We were greeted by no one, mind you there were 4servers standing and chit chatting at the bar, so we sat ourselves. Had plenty to choose from as the place was near empty. When finally someone comes over he brings us the menus and rushes us into ordering. He brings my coffee and slams the sugar on the table. Bad service, maybe good food? Nope. Take a look at this disgusting greasy plate of eggs.  Nothing about the bad service and overpriced food is worth this waste of time and money."
Sylvia V.,"North Plains, OR",20,6,1,5.0,1/6/2017,This always hits the spot  amazing food! The service is great also! We ordered the potato skins and avocado egg rolls. Huge fan of the potato skins not so much on the avocado rules my husband still ate half of them! But the waiter took them off the bill when he didn't have to :] wish I remembered his name!
Ralph C.,"Hillsboro, OR",0,4,,1.0,6/28/2017,This is supposed to be great local place. I can not believe the low standard and unprofessionalism. That BJ brewery stupa to. They will physically chase you out side and yell and shout at you. For there error. An incident between there  BJ  waiters. Not the patron. As for BJ  Management . A male did not want to give his name. But just passed the buck to Melissa Ferris. There gm. I would suggest that you go some where else. Take your time and money to Micky D's. At least there they treat you like a person.
Bethany S.,"Denver, CO",77,387,211,4.0,8/19/2016,"Since I knew I was going to get a bigger dessert, I went healthy for my entree and got a baby kale/olive/cranberry salad. Honestly, the salad wasn't great. The flavors were strange together and there wasn't nearly enough dressing.  However, the Pizookie alone earns BJ's four stars for me, as I would go back literally just for that. My friend and I split a s'mores one, and my mind and tongue exploded with happiness. Perfect. I want to go back and try the other flavors!  Also, my friends and I had way too much fun with innuendos about having BJ's, so there's that plus. The service and decor were fantastic as well!"
Sean M.,"Hillsboro, OR",0,239,,3.0,9/11/2016,"Ordered curbside takeout from here. The food was brought out a few minutes late, but I wasn't in a hurry. When the food did arrive, I thought it was missing something, but the girl said it was all there. I trusted her, which was my mistake. I get home 2.5 miles later and they call me as I am parking to say they forgot something in my bag. How convenient? I went back and got the food. Now we are 35 minutes past when my food should have been ready. It was my first time having their food. The food was fine, but nothing blew me away. It felt like a less commercialized applebees or chillis."
Captain C. Branagain G.,"Astoria, OR",47,575,8,3.0,9/7/2016,"Most chain eateries like this bore me.  Uninspired bar food attempting to be flashy and hip that is priced too high, served by perky co-eds trying to make ends meet.  While BJ's gets lumped in this genre of chains, it does a pretty damn good job at rising above the sea of mediocrity. The menu takes a few weeks to read all of the way through. So many choices that even your picky pain in the ass mates can find culinary satisfaction. We arrived around 9 to find a slightly frustrated and stressed staff left holding down the fort after some were sent home after the dinner rush. We had dined at another BJ's location the night before, so that speaks well for their appeal.  Service didn't really suffer, as we had a great server who was polite and attentive.  Mixed drink prices were pretty high, but food prices were in line with the quality. My steak was perfectly prepared and bursting with flavour. Clam chowder was thick and rich. Steamed broccoli was perfect as a side option.  Bottomless chips and salsa was the perfect starter.  Others raved about their ribs, pasta dishes, and salads.  The ladies devoured their salted caramel cookie creations as afters."
Blayake L.,"Salem, OR",95,7,,1.0,4/23/2017,My food was so salty that I was concerned for my health afterwards I couldn't even finish my food.  I've been to other BJSs before and have never had this problem so I definitely don't recommend this location!
Tiff K.,"Santa Barbara, CA",163,15,,2.0,8/7/2016,"I went there for the first time today. I have heard nothing but good things about this restaurant, but all of those things were wrong. The food was mediocre at best.  We ordered the queso and I am pretty sure it was poured from a Tostitos jar. The chips were soggy with grease and literally chewy in my mouth. The pizza was bland, even with the multiple toppings. For the price of the food, quality ingredients should be expected.  The beer list looked good even though we didn't drink. The atmosphere was fine and the service was great, the only reason for a second star.  My first experience will easily be my last."
Erick B.,"Beaverton, OR",37,152,59,4.0,1/14/2017,"Stopped in for dinner on New Year's before the big night and we pleasantly surprised. The Rib Eye was cooked well, as was the chicken breasts. When I order a slab of dead cow, I want it seared and bleeding and they met the mark. The beer was cold and frosty, and the shrimp was delicious. We didn't have room for dessert because the meal stuffed the hell out of me (even had to pop the top button on my pants). Anyways, this is a great place to chill and grab a bite and has a very casual atmosphere. I've been here with my employees for work gatherings and they've never failed to impress."
Tiffany L.,"Hillsboro, OR",44,60,,2.0,5/26/2017,"I went here last weekend with my mother and let's jus say we didn't have a good experience. We were seated at our table fast but then the waiter/waitress took forever to come. We had to grab the hostess that walked by us. Then after someone came to take our drink orders there were two waiters arguing about whose section is who and then no one came to help us after that for about 10 mins. Finally we just ordered with someone who hasn't helped us yet and he got our orders. All in all it was a terrible experience and very unprofessional that two waiters were arguing by our table about whose table it is. The food industry sucks. Also, our tableware was dirty and hd dried food on it. Bleach.!"
Kimberly C.,"Portland, OR",48,10,,4.0,2/8/2017,"Went to Bj's last night for the first time and was pleasantly surprised with the atmosphere upon entering. We were drinking, laughing and eating for around 3 hours  (talk about losing track of time) and the waitress (I believe her name was Lindsay) was incredibly pleasant, patient and consistent in her service the entire time. The drinks were wonderful and the food was delicious.  I'll definitely be returning!"
Ron D.,"St. Helens, OR",4,13,,2.0,4/15/2017,"While food was good, the service leaves a lot to be desired. Our server was friendly yet there was no coordination with the timing of deliver of our starter and soup/salad. Then the main meal was delayed which did allow it to cool down substantially."
patrick s.,"Portland, OR",39,26,11,3.0,1/25/2017,No more than 3 stars max. Service is excellent. Food even on happy hour is overpriced vs quantity and quality. Poke was borderline bad. But again the service was outstanding. Tried the mixed appetizer plate. Portions need to be bigger. Service trumps all.
Arun P.,"Portland, OR",0,12,2,4.0,4/28/2017,"Great menu! That's what I love about BJ's. The reward program is one of its kind. This restaurant, in particular, has an excellent bunch of servers, but some of the managers are rude. Food is served quickly (10-15 mins) and you have the convenience of paying with the app and $10 off for every $100 you spend. Did I say I love their pizookie? Oreo pizookie is my personal favourite!"
Anna L.,"København, Denmark",320,2,,1.0,4/14/2017,"I went to get pizookies because BJ's are super tasty! Instead of waiting 20 minutes to get a table, my sister and I decided to get them to go. Worst idea ever. When the order was finished, they called my name but we didn't hear it (given that it was quite noisy). But instead of calling my name again, the person went back to her work and didn't call my name again awhile. Finally when she asked my sister and I if we ordered the pizookies, the ice cream was already partially melted and the cookie was cold. My sister and I were literally the ONLY people in the take out area and all of the three staff members at the take out area just it there. It would have been faster & tastier if we just waited for a table because the take out BJ's workers apparently can't even call out someone's name twice or simply give a take out order to the only people in the waiting area."
