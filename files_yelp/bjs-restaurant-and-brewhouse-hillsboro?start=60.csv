Allison W.,"San Jose, CA",45,36,14,4.0,7/2/2016,"Want to give a huge shout out to Monique for great service in the bar area! She was attentive and went above and beyond by bringing us beer samples without asking, frequently checking in, and her upbeat attitude. Made for a really great experience!! I had the Santa Fe Salad and it was great! Very yummy!  For a Saturday night it was pretty slow. Maybe because it was a holiday weekend. Not sure but great place to grab good food and a drink!"
Genna C.,"Beaverton, OR",49,266,,3.0,8/27/2015,"BJ's is a great example of what I call ""business trip restaurants."" (See also: Ruby Tuesday.) If you're on a business trip and you're looking for something solid and reliable but tasty and not too stressing on the ol' per diem, you go to the dark wood-floored restaurant across the parking lot from your Marriott/Hyatt for dinner. Pretty good food with a great selection for a reasonable price, on the higher end of your Applebee's/TGI Friday's-type of something-for-everyone restaurant, where you and your co-workers can discuss tomorrow morning's presentation over a ribeye or a club sandwich and fries. (By the way, I'm not on a business trip. I've been on a few in my day, so I know the kind of place.) I would come here again, for sure. I've had the lunch special stuffed baked potato and salad a few times now, delicious and filling and certainly reasonable at $8.50. The menu is, as others have mentioned, a bit too voluminous and not well-organized, honestly. The first time, I came in at 12:30 pm and it took me a few minutes to find the lunch section. But service is pretty good (much improved from when it first opened a few years ago, for sure) and it's an all-around solid choice. A-OK.  P.S. there's a Marriott SpringHill Suites across the parking lot. Told you so."
Amy A.,"San Jose, CA",0,22,11,4.0,3/30/2017,"Have visited this location of BJ's several times. Always found the food to be consistently good. The generic BJ's menu is super versatile, and we have tried different things every time. Although, burgers are always the best part of the meal, avocado rolls are exceptional."
Anni K.,"Anaheim, CA",0,6,1,1.0,7/25/2017,"My family and I go to BJs regularly and the service is always hit and miss. Today was a complete miss. We placed our order and I had requested the side avocados that were suppose to be for my child to be brought out first. The sides for my meal had come out first and still no utensils on the table or the avocados. We waited for out server to walk by so we could ask for some. I had also asked to sample 2 wines when we ordered our food, brought that out promptly but did not come back to ask if I had a preference till after the appetizers were out.  When our meals came out my husband's burger was dry ,which he ate anyway because he was starving. I took one bite of my steak and the flavor was so over powering as though it were doused with cracked pepper. and only soon after our mains came out the side of avocados were brought to the table. I am normally not one to  send food back but that was inedible. By this point the child wasn't having it anymore and our nice family outting has turned sour for me. My child and i left to wait in the car and let my husband wait till the new steak was brought out and had the server bring out a box. Which he seemed surprised at according to my husband. When the bill came we were charged for 2 steaks which my husband pointed out since we would not be paying for that. But overall hardly apologetic for the subpar service/food."
Bridget O.,"Hillsboro, OR",13,4,4,4.0,2/19/2017,"My family and I came in for lunch today. There was little bit of a weird smell when we walked in the door but nothing major or overpowering. We had a party of 5 so 2 adults 2 older kids and a 7 month old, they put us on a raised booth which would have been fine without the baby. The booth was a little awkward with the car seat. The service was good and quick. She was always on top of our drinks and requests for napkins etc. I am giving the 4 stars for the food. I had a chicken club, it was extremely greasy, it came with a small amount of fries which were tasty. My kids and husband all had bacon cheeseburgers which they all enjoyed very much. We will be back but I won't be having the chicken club again. Good thing there are many things to choose from."
Penny D.,"Beaverton, OR",14,5,,2.0,8/14/2017,"It was an ok restaurant, but I didn't think it was worth the money. My chicken salad was good, but my husband's steak was not cooked the way he ordered it. It was barely medium rare when he ordered medium well! He didn't finish it! I will not go back!"
Rebecca J.,"Torrance, CA",0,11,,2.0,7/20/2017,"The food is ok, service is as one would expect in a busy restaurant. Not great, not terrible. We tried to go last night, after doing a search on Yelp for dog friendly restaurants. Just to be safe, we called to confirm dogs were allowed on the patio. We were assured they are and put on a call ahead list. We arrived and I was informed dogs were not allowed (service animals welcome, of course) and we were not on a list. It was only a 10 minute drive, but still, there was a serious disconnect there between staff and a waste of our time. Yelp should also remove BJ's from the dog friendly search result as this is definitely not the case."
Jake M.,"Vancouver, WA",2,26,2,3.0,9/17/2015,"Food is not as good as other BJs. You're fine if you order a pizza, but the apps, salmon and jambalaya were poorly cooked.  Beers great and drinks were good."
Kimberly C.,"Beaverton, OR",70,7,,1.0,7/22/2017,"Beer tastes salty and soapy. I thought it was just the glass so they poured another  ""Jeremiah Red."" Tasted the same! So I asked for a Mac & Jacks, which I always get. To my surprise, this tasted the same way...so nasty I didn't want to drink it, but I did anyway. Maybe they do not rinse out the beer lines properly after cleaning them? Or do not rinse the glasses right?! Never had this problem anywhere. Needless to say, this is the first and last time I'll visit here!"
Amber K.,"Beaverton, OR",13,127,9,4.0,10/12/2015,"I have been to this BJ's location multiple times with friends/family and I absolutely love it!  They're always quick to seat and serve you. I've had nothing but good experiences with their servers and food here. The food tastes a lot better than their competition in the Hillsboro/Tanasbourne area; always warm and a lot fresher than I've tasted in other chain restaurants.  I brought my best friend here for her birthday and we had a nice time. Unfortunately the food we ordered around 2:50 didn't count towards the happy hour, which is the only reason I'm deducting a star. Their happy hour menu is pretty good, and I enjoy their mojitos! One of their servers, Gio, is a brilliant and friendly fellow, he represents the stellar experience that all BJ's restaurants should offer.  I will definitely be back!"
Dontworry A.,"Vancouver, WA",0,35,13,4.0,12/7/2016,"I came here with my girlfriends family I got the spaghetti and meatballs with a budlight. I liked it but the meatballs were a little squishy, they all got something different and they all enjoyed their food. The waiter was nice and very respectful."
Kellie L.,"Salem, OR",125,33,29,5.0,11/21/2016,We just moved in down the street from this BJ'S and have already made it one of our go to spots. They have happy hour during every NFL game which is hard to beat. Chelsea is our favorite bartender... our second time there she remembered our drinks which I thought was pretty cool. Every time we go we are greeted kindly and served quickly.
Shikha C.,"Portland, OR",108,164,1450,4.0,6/2/2014,"BJs is one of the best diner chain in Hillsboro. Fav hangout for any birthday party's / meeting friends / or for a late night drink.  For  vegetarians, I recommend: Avacado Egg Roll( there is no egg in this starter) Flat bread vegetarian pizza Chicago crust veggie pizza with pineapples:)  pizookie What I like about them: Beer Samplers Drinks Open till late What I don't like: I have waited almost for an hour once. Service level keeps changing. Same is the case with food flavors. I Wish they add more veggie options.  This is one of the good places in Hillsboro to chill, watch matches or for any other mood you are in. I will go again mainly for their Chicago style pizzas and beer samplers."
Mo G.,"Beaverton, OR",2,71,16,3.0,12/16/2016,Expensive restaurant One Step Above an Applebees. a pretty nice bar & beer on tap. Not very many vegan options. It's a little pricey so go during happy hour.
An S.,"Hillsboro, OR",6,23,,1.0,5/1/2016,This place gets worse with time. The service is horrendous. The waiters don't seem to wait for someone to complete placing an order and they are quick to take away a half eaten meal without consulting you! And dont expect to receive the right order either. I ve seen beef and chicken served to people who requested vegetarian versions and substitutes are never honored.
Dustin C.,"Portland, OR",5,32,,1.0,2/5/2016,"This is probably the first time I've wanted to vote a restaurant less than one star. Restaurant is pushing it...brewery is really pushing it. Admittedly this is the McDonalds of brew pubs and we knew that upon entering, but hey, Hillsboro isn't loaded with options on this side of town. Atmosphere was loud and uninviting. Faux-opulence but everything is just out of place like poorly assembled IKEA furniture. Service was terrible. In a party of 12, 4 people didn't get their meals on time because ""the kitchen was taking a lot longer than normal."" At least that's what our server stammered out, though he took their full orders again: kind of suspicious. Drinks were brought extremely slowly. A couple beer samples  were requested and he stopped the entire ordering process each time to retrieve them, also checking on his other tables en route. The food was ghastly. Applebees is higher quality. And so expensive for what was brought to the table! The appetizers weren't even warm by the time we got them. My wife's meal was some type of Mac and Cheese variant, though gritty and unpleasant. When the server came around each time and asked how everything was, she remarked how poorly it tasted. He nodded his head, then turned around and walked away. No replacement offer. Didn't take it off the bill even though the plate remained untouched. Cocktails were made from crappy mixes, though priced as if they were fresh. We had to move to these after trying all the lackluster beers. In summary, if you hate yourself, your friends/family and money: please visit BJ's Craphouse. To our server: perhaps you could take up another occupation like doorstop or whipping boy."
Judith H.,"Chicago, IL",0,7,,1.0,3/25/2017,"A buddy and I stopped at BJ's at 3pm on Friday December 30 and had both poor service and bad food. We weren't greeted or seated, so we took a booth in the very empty bar. No waiter visited our table although several staff were on the floor. After 10 minutes my friend went to the bar to place a drink order (which she brought back to our table) and the bartender said he'd call for a waiter.  The waiter delivered water and disappeared. 15 minutes later we placed our order after asking a passing staff person to send our waiter back. The ""tomato bisque"" delivered to the table was the final straw. It was oily and red and seemed completely free of the cream or milk needed for a bisque. We tried flagging a server but no one acknowledged us so we went again to the bar to inform the bartender that we were leaving. The bartender called the manager and we related our concerns and we offered to pay for our drinks. The manager acknowledged that neither the service nor the food was up to snuff. You might think the manager would comp the drinks as an apology. Nope. Two customers upset about bad service and bad food apparently didn't concern the manager enough to think about trying to rebuild loyalty. I hope he enjoyed the profit from those two glasses of wine because I'll never spend another dollar in a BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse!"
Misty F.,"Portland, OR",43,7,2,1.0,8/12/2016,Terrible visit! To many employees standing around well you wait for service. I ordered  food for table sitting and a to go order. My to go order got there on a plate instead of a box. So the hostess put it in a warmer. So we sit there waiting on dessert. When our dessert came out so did the food in a Bag! I'm done with this place for awhile!!!!
Gary L.,"Honolulu, HI",0,1,,2.0,10/19/2016,"ordered an appetizer (calamari) which was all stuck together and a bit salty.  Also ordered a couple of steaks medium rare and the bbq chicken salad.  forgot to mentioned this was dinner was for two people.  the 2 steaks and salad was brought out at the same time, one steak was cooked beyond well done. 15 minutes later when they brought the replacement steak it was done medium rare but the asparagus was saturated with salt and pepper.  the waitress went an placed a new order of asparagus relating that she would tell them not to put any seasoning on.  When that finally came out it had more salt and pepper that the first order.  I don't believe the waitress was at fault but maybe the cook! its going to be very difficult for me go back there to dine!"
Cody C.,"Paradise, CA",0,5,,2.0,12/7/2016,Not a fan. The service was decent but the food tasted like generic suburb eatery. I was unimpressed because my overpriced salad was super lame. Tasted like any regular salad but like $10 more.
