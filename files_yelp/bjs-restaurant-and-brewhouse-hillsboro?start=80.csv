Melissa H.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,7,,2.0,10/17/2016,"I just moved here from California where I have been to BJs frequently. This experience was not good. It was around 5 pm and not very busy. I ordered the BBQ chicken salad which come out with no dressing, just BBQ sauce and tasted strange. I told the waiter and he was nice to offer something else. I then got the honey mustard chicken salad. The salad came out very soggy, drenched in dressing and with brown lettuce. I could not eat that salad either. My son ordered the grilled cheese with happy face potatoes which he said were gross. The waiter we had was alright. Overall, I was disappointed with the food at this location."
H B.,"Puyallup, WA",0,9,4,2.0,7/30/2016,"Pros: -Piadinas had good flavor -Pizookies are always good Cons: -Female host that was working the front door on 7/28/16 (around 10pm), had horrible customer service. Brought us to a table that had spilled water on the table and seats and didnt even make an effort to clean up the spills. Then proceeded to put a menu on top of a water spill to try and cover it up before we could see. Lazy.  -Some of the food items were cold."
Ilana F.,"San Ramon, CA",80,25,35,4.0,11/22/2015,"The atmosphere is very modern. Eventhough it's a chain, I think it is one of the better ones. They make many of their sodas in house--my friends ordered a rootbeer and a black cherry soda. I ordered a sparkling rasperry lemonade. For our entrees I ordered the roast beef dip--it was pretty yummy! Topped with Caramelized onion and melted cheese with shoe string fries on the side. My roommate got clam chowder in a bread bowl, no complaints there. For dessert we ordered a pizookie with peanut butter and melted marshmallow topped with vanilla ice cream, it was delicious but SUPER rich. Our waiter was nice! He was on top of refills which is always a good sign. All in all I was definitely pleased with my experience and would go back in a heart beat!"
Kruti P.,"Portland, OR",14,20,1,4.0,4/12/2017,"Its great to see that BJ's have healthy options. We tried the beet root salad and cauliflower tacos. The salad was delicious. The tacos were tasty too but bit dry. It comes with a side of quinoa salad. It would be nice to have a side of  sauce, alioli  or guac to go with the tacos. The person who served us 'Nick' was super friendly and helped us feel comfortable when our toddler had a melt down !"
Joel H.,"Beaverton, OR",17,21,6,4.0,8/24/2016,"Always has space to accommodate big groups for birthday's, or going away party's and the menu is extensive enough to cover a wide range of appetites. That is actually my only critique is that the menu is too big! If you don't have something in mind you may end up flipping pages indecisively. Their selection of beer is delicious, as well as their handcrafted soda! And for desert? You gotta try the Pizookie, they are great."
Prerna B.,"Surrey, Canada",0,4,2,5.0,5/3/2017,Love it. Love their soup in sourdough bun and desserts  everytime I am in US I always go to BJs. Best place
Christina M.,"Hillsboro, OR",22,393,745,4.0,2/3/2016,I went to BJ's pretty frequently with my family prior to moving to Oregon so I was really excited to see BJ's opening a restaurant in Hillsboro. I've been here quite a few times and the pizza is consistently good. The happy hour tends to get pretty crowded for good reason - they have a good variety of beers (although you can find better in Portland) and the discounted food prices are enticing. 4 stars.
Laura H.,"Bend, OR",21,2,1,1.0,7/22/2016,"Been going to BJ's pizza in Newport Beach  over the last 40 years.  Every time we come to Portland we always try to stop in. Went to the one in Hillsboro today and was so disappointed not the same meal. So sad, drinks were all sugar and pizza did not taste like the real thing:("
Betsy L.,"Easton, PA",5,13,,3.0,3/8/2017,"The happy hour specials were great, the bartender was attentive and polite. I ordered the penne with shrimp and asparagus and the asparagus was undercooked making my the dish less then appetizing."
Scott F.,"Hillsboro, OR",63,9,2,2.0,11/17/2015,"We were seated rather promptly for a busy Friday night, so that was a plus. It went kind of downhill from there. My wife ordered a steak, and it was not very good. Tough and full of fat and gristle, and not cooked the way she ordered it. The brussel sprouts were brown and drowning in a vinegary glaze. The bartender gave her the wrong drink. I ordered the brisket burger, and it was good, The wedge cut fries, however, were obviously pre-frozen, and had no real flavor to it. DO get the Jeremiah Red ale, however. That was very tasty. I will give a thumbs-up to our server. I do not remember his name, sadly, but he was pretty good at replacing the drink error, and was overall very courteous and on-point. I'm glad I got the coupon ($10 off of $35 or more) but even then for what we got I felt it was not worth the price. Do yourself a favor and hit up Copper River instead. They share a parking lot with BJ's. The food and overall experience is much better."
Charmaine L.,"Beaverton, OR",0,5,,1.0,1/4/2017,"If you want to sit and talk with friends, be ignored by staff, finally get your food, (one friend had to send it back as it was cold) look at it and see it doesn't even resemble the picture in the menu, (I had the chicken soba noodle dish that looked like it had been scraped from a prior customers dish and reheated) then again, talk with your friends about how weird the food tastes, then come home and within the hour, throw it all up, continue all next day being extremely sick, then by all means, go to BJ's! I have never given one star to anywhere and hate to do it here, however, despite repeated attempts to ask to speak to a manager, no one ever came to talk with us. I have been here once before for lunch and it was ok, but this horrible experience will be my last."
Denise B.,"Portland, OR",13,3,,1.0,7/5/2016,"This is the 2nd time I've been here and still disappointed. 1st time they screwed up our order no big deal.   This time lunch, pretty empty looking.  Lead to a booth with dirty seats and got huffed when asked if had a towel to wipe it down.  Came back with a tissue and wiped it off in the floor.  The floor under the table was greasy slick.  The wedge fries were good. My BBQ pork sandwich was bizzare. The pork was good and juicy but had some wierd juice on it but not BBQ. The BBQ was in a cup next to the sandwich.  When you bit into the sandwich it dripped juice but not BBQ and soaked in the bun and made it uneatable.  The drink refills took extremely long to get.  A table next to us remarked their drinks too for ever but the server sure had time to go smoke."
Lana P.,"Hillsboro, OR",1,13,1,4.0,10/10/2016,The portions are huge. My friend and I shared a bacon cheeseburger which had a wonderful flavor to it. We also ordered calamari which was a little leathery.
Bill C.,"Eureka, CA",0,7,2,4.0,3/3/2017,"We were visiting Hillsboro on a business trip and looking for a restaurant with brews near our hotel. This fit the bill. The food was good, fairly typical chain fare, but the portions were huge. The fried artichoke appetizer was filling.  We took as much of the parmesan crusted chicken back to the hotel as I ate at the table. The beer selection was very extensive, with both BJ's own and other craft brews on tap. The only negative was the service was slow, but we were not in a rush so it was tolerable."
Ryan B.,"Burlington, VT",15,72,1,5.0,6/9/2016,"I get a little excited when I see BJ's Brewhouse pop up in my Yelp search. Love the food, and drinks. Love the atmosphere. Keep doing what you do!"
Timothy P.,"Beaverton, OR",0,10,,4.0,3/10/2017,"I've enjoyed Bj's ever since I walked into the one that was downtown Portland near the Lloyd center and had their BJs'f favorite pizza. The other menu items are very tasty as well, and this is one of the first places I think about when taking someone out. The ambiance, food, and service are usually excellent. I say usually because I've had to slow the waiters down when it comes to bringing the food to the table. I don't like my main course coming out with my appetizers. I've actually had to place my drink and appetizer order [the potato skins are great]  wait, for them to come out and then place my food order, just so the table wasn't crammed with dishes. There is supposed to be a certain flow to supper and all at once is not it. That being said, I've never had a bad meal here. Everything I've tried is good beit, drinks, pizza, sandwiches, pasta, chops, steaks, chicken, other supper items or desserts, they have all been delicious.  I especially like the samples when a seasonal beer comes into season. I may have to get a BJ's Favorite Pizza soon, add a little BBQ sauce, ... it sounds delicious."
Andy S.,"Beaverton, OR",1,33,14,5.0,2/4/2016,"Our server Chelsea made our family night out awesome! Thank you for your kind and professional demeanor. You will succeed at what ever in life you persue as your attention to detail will guide you there. Food was hot and delicious, Thank you."
Jaben C.,"Beaverton, OR",7,334,150,3.0,8/16/2015,"We go here for lots of lunches from work.  This is close to where work and seems to always have space.  They have tons of parking, tons of menu options, and endless ice tea, what more can you want at lunch. This seems to be the place we say goodbye to all of our interns at the end of their time with my team."
Brittany S.,"Portland, OR",26,3,,1.0,4/25/2016,"This place is the restaurant in the movie ""Waiting"". Gross. Do yourself a favor and go to Red Robin."
Liz C.,"Austin, TX",6,20,,5.0,7/11/2015,"I have always had great service and food food here. But I really want to recognize this restaurant for helping us out and providing amazing customer service in one particular instance.  We had the unfortunate experience of my toddler son choking on his spaghetti and throwing up right in his dinner plate.  If this hasn't happened to you yet and you have kids, it will. Trust me.  Back to the point, we helped our son and started to clean him up as best we could when our awesome waitress (Oh how I wish I knew her name) came by. She quickly took his (disgusting) plate away, with a smile, not acting in the least bit grossed out. Then she brought him an entirely new plate of spaghetti (which we were not charged for). The manager came by and asked if we needed anything, etc, and even heated our food up since it had gotten a bit cold while we dealt with the vomit eruption.  This happened about a year ago and I regret not writing this review sooner because this was an awesome experience and we were able to have a nice dinner despite the circumstances.  This is a great place for kids, and I'm very thankful for such nice people working there."
