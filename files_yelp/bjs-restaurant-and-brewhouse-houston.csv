Jeff S.,"Houston, TX",230,615,212,4.0,12/3/2017,"Knowing that BJ's offers ample TV's and a lively atmosphere in their bar area, my wife and I visited twice during the World Series to cheer on our Astros with other local fans. We were thankful to snag a 4-seat high-top in the bar on both visits. With TV's positioned throughout the establishment, there was no shortage of good viewing angles. On both visits, the service was very good with everybody in the Astros frenzied spirit. During our first visit we enjoyed a variety of appetizers including buffalo wings and calamari. Our second visit was Halloween night - stay home and dole out treats or go out and cheer on the Astros? No dilemma here! On this night my wife enjoyed wings again (they were quite good first visit and she's been on a bit of a wings kick lately). I noticed that BJ's offers prime rib (a favorite of mine) but only on weekends. Bummer. So I opted for the ribeye steak with mashed potatoes and asparagus. My steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare and was quite flavorful. We topped off our meal by sharing a chocolate chunk pizcookie topped with vanilla ice cream. Yum! BJ's offered drink specials during both games. We enjoyed both visits and agreed that venturing out to enjoy our favorite team is well worth the effort."
Kirbi S.,"Houston, TX",18,120,27,2.0,12/3/2017,GNATS!! So many gnats at the bar. The bartender came up to take my order and disturbed the colony of gnats and they started swarming the entire bar area. It must be something that happens often because the bartender didn't flinch or even apologize.  I've been to this location before but never the bar. The food was okay when I came in the past but I won't be eating here again.
Crystal C.,"Houston, TX",144,132,183,3.0,11/25/2017,"Decided to venture back to BJ's for a late lunch, early dinner today after a wonderful day of shopping and spending time with great friends.  Since we have not frequented this location in over a year, it was nice to see the place was still an option in such a busy area. I'm a very friendly and outgoing person...in other words, I don't need a reason to be nice to ANYONE. My dining partner and I decided to sit at the bar.  We often do this so we can chat and get great service/attention from attentive bartenders.  NOT TODAY. I ordered a Bloody Mary at 2:45pm...our drinks came right away...we both ordered an appetizer & a main entree. There is no need to complain or provide any negative feedback about anything MEAL RELATED.  THE FOOD WAS PHENOMENAL.   The SERVICE, however, was questionable.  To be fair, only one person contributed to this lack of service.  Hopefully, this review will shed a flicker of light on her unbecoming conduct, which was CLEARLY DIRECTED at my friend and me.  Maybe she will take a moment to consider treating deserving and paying customers with a certain professional level of service despite her personal hangup.  I tried to overlook her rude behavior, but, after she blatantly ignored us for over 25+ mins, I decided to simply enjoy my meal and not allow her to ruin my great mood. **Shift change** I was FINALLY offered a refill from the new bartender SINCE MY EFFORT TO GET HER ATTENTION FROM THE OPPOSITE END OF THE BAR WAS MOOT...  #ThanksForNothing #NotEvenWater"
Rex C.,"Houston, TX",75,424,842,2.0,11/3/2017,Wish I could give a higher rating but the times we have eaten there and gotten food to go it was just average.  ***MANAGERS**** DO NO PUT CELERY IN THE BOX WITH THE WINGS FOR TO ORDERS!!!! THE OTHER DAY I HAD SOME WINGS THAT TASTED LIKE CELERY BECAUSE OF THIS.  ALSO ON THE RIBS DO NOT PUT THE COLE SLAW IN THE BOX LOOK HOW OURS LOOKED WHEN WE GOT HOME. THANKS  the wings used to be really good. Now they are just average at best.  The ribs are actually really good but the ones we got had hardly any meat.  Lastly the deep dish pizza is alright.  Maybe I'll go back and give them some more shots but as of right now this place is a 2 Star. Good is just average at best and the people cramming everything into one box for to go orders is super annoying.  Thanks.
Tanisha K.,"Houston, TX",186,13,42,5.0,1/1/2018,I'm really not a pizza person but this right here... magnificent.. I went on happy hour and got the personal pizza for 5.00. I have been back since for the fettuccine Alfredo and it was good! Definitely numerous items to try and come get on different occasions.
Art D.,"Houston, TX",107,259,118,4.0,10/15/2017,"This spot was cool We arrived about dinner time and was able to get a seat right away. Not much to say here. The service was good I had a burger and it was very good and my guest also had a burger which they said was good. I did not have to ask for any refills and was not rushed either. Overall good experience. When it comes to eye candy. I did see some candy in the bar area, it looks like there was some potential to find some sweets."
Be S.,"Jersey Village, TX",8,3,1,1.0,11/1/2017,"Our food was lukewarm after they made the world tour of traveling all over the restaurant. The dude who was carrying the plates had no idea which table was the right table. I watched him stopping at three different tables, one by one,  S T R I K E Service was quite bad and we were less than thrilled. They were not even that busy. Bottom line: cold food + poor service = BJ Brewhouse"
Paul F.,"Lady Lake, FL",64,14,28,4.0,12/11/2017,Deep dish pepperoni deluxe is excellent. Christ is sick light intensity. Ample pepperoni but pretty salty. I would definitely get this again
Bjc T.,"Houston, TX",0,3,,4.0,1/9/2018,"The Rib-Eye steak was just fine.  I enjoyed it along with Mashed potatoes.  I didn't care for the macaroni and cheese, a bit greasy but that didn't spoil my meal.  Atmosphere is fantastic.  It has a nice cozy feel."
Kristin A.,"Spring, TX",3,71,6,2.0,11/10/2017,"My wife and I went to BJ's today for the first time. She is a veteran and was going for the free entree offer for vets (up to $12.95 value). We opened the menu and were surprised to discover that despite the fact that my wife was supposed to get a free entree, we would still have to pay something for hers, because practically none of the entrees cost less than $13. The food was overpriced for glorified bar food at what is basically a gastropub. I think we saw two salads under that amount, and since she isn't a rabbit, she ordered a $13.75 burger. I ordered the supposedly deep dish ziti for $14.95.  The food arrived after a long time, and we received another rude surprise: the small food quantities, particularly that of my pasta. I have never gotten so little pasta and paid so much for it. My ""deep dish"" ziti was only half full in a dish the width of a salad plate. I'm a small woman with only a modest appetite, and the portion was so small I ate the whole thing! I have never ordered pasta at a restaurant and not brought home at least half of it. My wife ordered a buffalo brisket burger and the patty was small compared to the bun and the cheese was pretty skimpy as well.  I will credit BJ's for friendly prompt service when we went (4PM on a Friday,) and the food was quite good. But it was still very overpriced and with the small portions, we won't be returning."
Darrell F.,"Friendswood, TX",464,157,647,5.0,11/8/2017,"The food was recommended by our server Tyesha.  The food was served very fast, very tasty and didn't have to ask for anything .  Top notch service and great food this time around"
Macy B.,"Houston, TX",49,64,8,1.0,6/16/2017,"BJ's is one of those classic places where dining should be easy and relaxed and great service is expected, considering it's a chain with a good reputation. Tonight, however, defied all good impressions I once had on this restaurant.  When we put our name down for a table we were told it'd be a 15-20 minute wait. 25 minutes passed so I went to the counter to check on the status of the table. 3 people were behind the computer talking amongst themselves, obviously not caring if I heard because one of them said ""she's only been waiting 25 minutes"" (only??). Then I said we were told 15-20 minutes and the server argued back and said ""actually we told you 30-45 minutes and it's only been 25 minutes"".  Good management is to never talk back to a customer and to make everyone feel welcome (neither happened).  Finally, we get seated. The waiter made the whole experience so much worse for us. We were a party of 9 and he was constantly forgetting things, like to take someone's order at the other end of the table or to bring our drinks. We'd ask for a fork or an extra plate and never get them, so we'd have to share forks or seek another waiter to get plates. He brought out my fiance's meal before our appetizers, and before everyone else's meals/appetizer so it was awkward for him to eat alone. Then, he spilled water all over my fiancé and cleaned it up so poorly that I had to take the towel from him and clean it myself. We heard a loud thump a few minutes later and it was our waiter who dropped all our pizookies on the ground! It's time for the check and we realize ours was very cheap, and we were thinking ""wow, he comped our meal for us!"" But no, he just accidentally placed them on someone else's tab.  All in all it was a pretty disappointing night. I hope management reads this because I don't want anyone else to experience this kind of service again."
Tish P.,"Houston, TX",907,408,1021,3.0,10/23/2016,"Disclaimer:  This review solely represents my experience with this business on one or more occasions.  It is not my intent to encourage nor discourage anyone from patronizing this establishment but rather, to offer my opinion of the facts that occurred during my visit(s).   I wouldn't pretend to be the biggest fan of the BJ's chain.  I have visited this location a couple of times prior and it was ok. The time before last they served me burnt brussel sprouts with the sriracha sauce. I had this in the Katy location and loved them.  Mad disappointed at this one.    This last time though, had a meal that's return worthy.  The roasted salmon quinoa bowl gave me so much life! The fish was cooked just right, moist and flaky.  I'm no stranger to quinoa but I had never actually tried it before.  Delicious compliment with the tomatoes, mushrooms and asparagus.  Ate the whole thing..scrapped the bowl...no shame in my game!  I did get the dinner portion since I love salmon and its half the amount on the lunch.   I've visited BJ's chain, easy 10 times between Katy, Pearland Willowbrook and tried different dishes each time considering how their menu is almost as extensive as Cheesecake Factory.  Finally found my BJ's dish that I don't have to take a chance on...yeah!"
Rina M.,"Los Angeles, CA",57,63,57,5.0,10/5/2017,"I came here for my bday lunch yesterday and received the best service from Stephanie! I think that's her name, curly hair with green tips and upbeat attitude . She was very attentive to our needs and when we had a slight issue with a salad having to much dressing, she took care of it right away even though we told her it didn't matter. As for the food i was vey pleasantly surprised at how good it was. I was craving spaghetti and meatballs and typically its just OK when i order it from restaurants that aren't Italian. The spaghetti here exceeded my expectations. The pasta was cooked perfectly aldente and the sauce was beautifully seasoned and thick enough to coat every pasta noodle perfectly! Definitely a thumbs up all the way around from service to food."
Sylvia N.,"Houston, TX",2,29,53,3.0,6/2/2017,"I came here after being familiar with the BJ's location in Fort Collins, CO. I had dinner on a Wednesday night, I was surprised to see that this restaurant only had 3 stars but it was packed. Definitely a lot of people were dining here. Upon entering, the place had a slightly stinky smell to it.. maybe dirty mop water? Anyway, it didn't deter us from leaving yet lol. We ordered a chicken bacon ranch mini pizza, creamy mac n cheese couscous, Peruvian shrimp quinoa bowl, and honey crisp chicken salad. I was disappointed in the Mac and cheese. It was completely different than how I had it in Fort Collins and that was because it was crisply baked in the oven. It tasted just a bit under cooked. The quinoa bowl was mushy due to the tomatoes in the quinoa. The shrimp had good flavor though. The pizza was really good and the salad was good also.  I also ordered the gluten free mini pizookie, so good. Hopefully I don't get salmonella because it was slightly under baked.. just slightly but was still good. I'm not sick yet so I think I'll be ok, haha."
Marty S.,"Houston, TX",27,28,84,1.0,12/10/2017,Service lacking waitress not very good at all. Crusted chicken delivered Luke warm not very tasty mashed potato's no taste dried out. Waitress big time attitudes when asking for Check. These young kids have a lot to learn.
Devon C.,"New York, NY",172,151,109,5.0,4/14/2017,"Had such a great time here today for lunch! Came in with my friend for lunch and a couple of beers....wow...Stephanie was a great server! Great service, great personality! We had a blast! Thank you, Stephanie for a truly fun afternoon! Xoxo"
Ngoc K.,"Houston, TX",122,51,67,5.0,1/16/2017,"When in doubt go to BJs. I'm a regular here, got me a card and place in line all the time. Because I'm such a regular my points add up very quickly and I'm always looking to try new things on their menu.  If you aren't a big alcohol drinker but don't want water, I recommend the raspberry tea. It come in a cup with a sugar rim. Love the sweetness of it, you can also ask for them to make it more sweet or less sweet since it's regular tea with raspberry syrup.  Appetizers i recommend is the southwest rolls or if you are looking for simple you can't go wrong with the calamari or cheese sticks. My usuals are Atlantic salmon with extra butter sauce, clam chowder, or pasta. The salmon is amazing with the rice and butter sauce. It's a great compliment to the meal and is super filling. The clam chowder can be a bit salty, but it's still very yummy for a sick day. You can never go wrong with pasta.  Some sides I like are the thin cut fries if you are looking to eat a burger. Mash potatoes are great as well, amazingly seasoned to compliment my taste buds.  They're known for great dessert as well, so just give them a try if you are still hungry after the meal. Pazookis are as good as they are hyped. I recommend salted caramel."
Jordyn W.,"Cypress, TX",85,2,,5.0,12/3/2017,"There pizookies are amazing! Every time I have gone to BJ's, I never have to ask for a refill. They bring the food out really fast! They have a lot of food and drinks on their menu so haven't been able to try everything but so far everything I have had has been cooked well and taste great!"
Style W.,"Katy, TX",0,8,2,5.0,9/23/2017,All I can say is the chicken wings appetizers were so damn good....season and cooked well.
D S.,"Waller, TX",20,18,8,3.0,9/10/2017,"This place is always a fun atmosphere but last night it was disappointing when we opened up our silverware both mine and my friends and they had food stuck on it ,our waiter Daniel which was awesome, immediately looked embarrassed and replaced it for us and apologized.  the small things like this can ruin a place I suggest that the person that puts the silverware in the napkins please make sure and check  I don't think you want your family to use dirty utensils because if a child would have gotten those silverware they would have just used it."
Erin P.,"Houston, TX",26,71,47,4.0,12/11/2016,"I have never had a bad meal at BJ's. They have many options to choose from on the menu and everyone should be able to find something to eat here. They used to have amazing pork chops, but they took them off the menu :(  The deep dish pizza is amazing and so is the clam chowder! I'm not a drinker but they do have a full bar with everything from beer to cocktails.  The restaurant is clean and comfortable and I generally enjoy my visit here."
Anh L.,"Houston, TX",548,728,1541,1.0,5/3/2016,"Service here is always a hit-or-miss and so is the food. One day my dish would come out amazing and I would crave for it only to get something inedible, which is why I don't dine here anymore. I'd rather spend my money where the food and service is consistent. The last few times I went have all been really bad. The food is just not worth the price. Save your time and money and dine elsewhere. SHRIMP SCAMPI- shrimp tossed with delicate angel hair pasta in a light blend of olive oil, butter, garlic, lemon juice and roma tomatoes, topped with parmesan cheese, seasoned bread crumbs, and parsley The pasta is so soggy and clumped together that it was so hard to pick up pieces of it without the whole dish lifting into the air. It wasn't a light blend of olive oil.. more like drenched in oil, but ironically the pasta was bland and tasteless. I remember when it used to be so flavorful, but the past few times, it's been consistently bad and oily. The bread crumbs aren't even crispy. They soaked up the oil and so you'll be getting oil residue everywhere! What happened to the old BJ's? Food used to taste good around here. This is not cutting it."
Jeremi B.,"Creekwood Acres, Spring, TX",53,11,,5.0,12/17/2017,"I have gone here numerous times I absolutely love this restaurant it has wonderful food wonderful service . I have not had bad food nor bad service since I've gone here and that's rare there are a couple things that I've had that are hard to steer away from and if you have these meals you will leave with a full belly and lots of satisfaction first off it's going to be the RIBS they are  so darn good oh they touch my heart when I eat them I leave with so much joy (ps.. ask them to give you extra sauce cause the sauce is slammin !!!!! next is the HICKORY BEEF BURGER  it's a great burger ask them to cut it down the middle for you it's a big burger make sure you roll your sleeves back cause it's gonna get messy but it's awesome next are the SIRRACHA BRUSSELS SPROUTS this is a appetizer and I tell you ,you will want to eat every little crumb this is so good has so much flavor and is a great bite and last but not least if you still have place in your belly for desert  get the pizookie Idk if I'm spelling it right but any flavor you get is amazing it comes with ice cream it is awesome!!!!"
Joshua A.,"Cypress, TX",131,1,9,1.0,8/13/2017,I honestly went in here after a long day of work and I was looking to have a cold brew. But apparently due to the fact that I'm an illegal alien and the only reason I say this is because this was the only reason I gave them a Mexican passport and I was denied a drink. In other words I felt so discriminated I would never come back to this place ever horrible service.
Cecilia B.,"Houston, TX",1,17,3,3.0,6/18/2017,"We tried BJ's for the first time Friday evening. I ordered the potato skins for an appetizer, the broccoli/cheese soup in the bread bowl, and the prime rib and French fries for the main course. He had the spaghetti with meatballs. My potato skins were good, but they brought the soup out so soon after I really hardly had any; the same thing with the soup - although what I did have of the soup was delicious! My prime rib was very good and the fries were a perfect side. His spaghetti? Not so much....WHO PUTS JALAPEÑOS IN SPAGHETTI?? He was sick the remainder of the night...I also had the pazookie free dessert - monkey bread with ice cream. The monkey bread was to die for, but the ice cream tasted old. I would love to go back and try to eat there again, but I don't think he will be willing; with a few corrections (and no spaghetti), I think it could work out much better than the first time..."
Leah G.,"San Diego, CA",61,54,4,1.0,2/12/2017,"Since my 82 year old mom is not an active Yelper, I will act as her proxy.  This is a long review, so be forewarned.   My 82 year old mom and 7 of her 80+ year old friends from Sunday School decided to have their regular Sunday lunch at BJ's on 1960 today.  She was happy to tell me how kind the young gentleman was that waited on them, but how upset she was at the end of the meal.   The young waiter had allowed 4 of the elderly women to order off the children's menu.  Either they asked, or he offered, but none the less, he allowed them to order from that list.  Meal came, meal was enjoyed, and the bill came.  The bill was delivered by Sarah, the manager.  As she gave the bill to the women, she announced that from now on they could not come in there and order from the children's menu.  She first announced it from one end of the table, and just in case they missed it, she proceeded to the other end and REannounced it again.  Not only did the ladies hear it the first time, so did the other patrons in the crowded restaurant. (Some of which they knew from church) This not only embarrassed the ladies, but insulted them greatly.  In front of a crowded restaurant on a Sunday afternoon, the ladies were horrified at the encounter. My mother,  a STRONG Texas lady, was tempted to set Sarah straight, but trying to not add anymore anxiety to the event, held her tongue and left.  She did, however, do what consumers of her generation do and fired off snail mail letters to the local restaurant and one to the CEO and CMO at the Huntington Beach, CA headquarters.  (She may not use social media, but she does know how to Google!) So BJ's may not care about losing the business of 8 elderly women, but those women have kids and grandkids, with more discretionary income, that live all over the US.  And for this San Diego Yelper, who lives down the street from BJ's and eats out about 20 times a month, I will not be going back unless my mom or I get a response on how this situation and future situations like this have been addressed.  (May I suggest a customer service for Seniors training course!) In this age of the ""Graying of America"", consumer focused, hospitality businesses need to realize that our senior community cannot be treated like second class citizens.  They have the money and the time to enjoy these amenities and will frequent those that are gracious to them.  They are a loyal demographic and should be welcomed, not chastised.  There are plenty of competitors of yours that offer seniors special deals or menus, the least you can do is be kind. And lastly BJ's I am borrowing this quote: ""Good Lord willing, you too will be a senior one day; whatever age that may be. And you too will want to be treated with patience, understanding and, most of all, respect.""   I am sure that Greg Trojan, Kevin Mayer and Lon Ledwith will agree. UPDATED 2/13/17 After the kind and thoughtful reply from BJ's Management (which came Sunday evening, I was impressed) I am hopeful that BJ's is taking this situation seriously and will do all they can to resolve the customer service situation quickly and professionally. Thank you BJ's, I hope after some follow up, I will be able to be back and positively reviewing your food and nothing negative!"
Caron L.,"Houston, TX",0,2,,1.0,8/8/2017,"We tried eating here on a Tuesday night and was told by the greeter that it would be an hour wait. We had no problems waiting but after a two hour wait we still had no table. There were tables on the side but the Dinning Room Manager Richard Blosser insisted that since they had no waiter in that area he could not sit us there. We were waiting for a party that had eaten and were just sitting there talking for over an hour. This makes absolutely no sense, we decided to eat somewhere due to terrible service!!!! If you have a big party I would recommend choosing another establishment."
Rena G.,"Houston, TX",206,166,266,3.0,8/29/2016,"This past Saturday we made the drive over to 1960 to celebrate a birthday and tried BJ's Brewhouse for the first time...long story short, we were not blown away. Like all restaurants on Saturday, the place was packed and we had a party of 7 meeting. Three of our family members were already there when we walked in and were waiting. The hostess told us that they could not sit us until the whole party showed up, no big deal since I'm familiar with other places that have this policy. Then another snooty waiter guy told me that they could sit us if half of our party was there. Um, there were 5 people there out of 7! and they still did not seat us. (And yet larger parties than us were seated before we were, even though their entire party wasn't there-we noticed more people arriving after they were seated)  I did not want to get upset since it was a special occasion, so when that snarky waiter guy told us that and yet still did not seat us even though more than half of the party was there, I was just like ""Jesus, take the wheel!!"" We were just waiting on 2 others which were a few minutes away. Finally, our remaining party guests showed up and then a good 10 minutes later, they finally sat us down. Not a good first impression already.  When we were finally seated, the evening seemed to be turning up. Our waitress was really nice and on top of her game, and brought out our drinks super fast. I noticed that they have a large menu with typical items that you'd find in other chain restaurants, ribs, burgers, salads, pizzas, etc. During this visit, I wasn't feeling a beer, so I opted for a strawberry mojito, which for almost $10, was not strong at all. For our entrees, I ordered the Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos $9.95 (comes with mixed grains bowl) the bf ordered the mushroom burger with french fries. The rest of the family ordered, a southern fried chicken plate, vegetable penne, New Orleans Jambalaya and the Parmesan crusted chicken.  To be fair, my food was good, no complaints and the other dishes at the table looked very tasty but to me, the food wasn't  OHMYGODTHISISSOGOOD!! It was just ok. Nothing that will make me drive all the way back. Some of our family members ordered a few of their brewed beers and they all said they were really good but I did not try them during my visit. At the end of our meal, they were accommodating and brought out a special dessert that were ordered discreetly for the birthday boy. As I mentioned, our waitress was a doll. For the life of me, I can't remember her name but she was awesome, stayed on top of our drinks and checked up on us regularly. For me and the bf, our total was $59 (excluding tip for our awesome waitress) but to me, that's overpriced for 2 entrees a few drinks and one birthday dessert. Not worth it to me. Overall, I can say that I've tried BJ's Brewhouse but it's not somewhere that I can see myself making the drive to try again."
Kat R.,"Houston, TX",22,289,37,2.0,3/2/2017,We've been here a few times late at night and usually because it's kinda a last resort lol Food has been ok service isn't consistent at all BJs in the west coast for some reason is better than here in Texas. I think we're done
Justin P.,"Houston, TX",0,10,3,4.0,7/14/2017,"We had to wait for a little while, my food came out cold but they made the situation correct. so all in all good night."
Tom G.,"Spring, TX",26,18,,4.0,5/29/2017,"I wish it were a little cheaper because the food is good...but not THAT good, and I do love their beers (but not sure I love them at $8 per bottle). The menu's pretty expansive so you're pretty sure to find something for everyone and then you get a pizookie and you could just die of joy.  A little cheaper and it'd be 5 stars and I'd go often."
Rich A.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",0,1,,2.0,9/22/2017,"Great service, food was decent, and everyone friendly.... 2 stars because my luggage (along with luggage from 3 other cars nearby) was stolen from BJ's parking lot in clear view of restaurant. My advice - Bring EVERYTHING you have in with you .... especially if you have a known rental car. Bummer to the end of a good trip and otherwise good experience!"
Kathleen R.,"Tomball, TX",15,113,300,4.0,3/16/2017,"I have been here at least five times. Sometimes it's crazy busy and sometimes we get a nice quiet dining experience. All of our servers have been fantastic, but there is one hostess that bears this attitude that she either doesn't want to be bothered or seating folks is inconvenient. Here lies the minus one star rating for FOH service or lack thereof. If really busy the hostesses will text you when your table is ready. You can also join a rewards program, ask your server for details! Despite that unfortunate hostess greeting, I think the food is pretty fantastic. The Wednesday Burger Special ($10, any burger) is completely worth it. I ordered mine medium and it came out perfect and pink! Fries are double fried and crispy, not greasy. The chicken lettuce wraps are a great appetizer or nice for a light meal. If you like beer, there's a plethora on tap and you can get a flight (4-sampler) for under $10.  I really liked the Tatonka (dark beer). There's a large menu with something for everyone and it feels more upscale than some of the surrounding eateries. My only other frustration is the narrow parking. We ARE in Texas folks! I would definitely recommend a visit. Be aware this is a brewery so evenings may be louder and busier, especially during game nights, as there are TVs surrounding the dining room."
Tim Z.,"Cleveland, OH",0,1,3,4.0,10/5/2017,"Great beers and fantastic food good specials. Would highly recommend...if the ""manager"" wouldn't have turned off a playoff baseball game in the 7th inning due to ""everyone asking to change the channel"" it was on one lonely TV while all others were on week 5 Thursday night football ( who cares )and South Carolina vs Louisville college football( really ). Oh and the 32"" TV in the corner on a hockey wrap up show. The servers were great and staff was very apologetic while ""manager"" hid in the back."
Krystle J.,"Houston, TX",17,20,7,5.0,5/25/2017,"Always great food and great service.  I love having membership rewards, it's great to save money or get some free food!  Menu is always changing so there is always something new to try too!"
Emma M.,"San Diego, CA",6,13,5,1.0,8/1/2017,"Was extremely disappointed with the terrible customer service that I received when trying to make a reservation at this BJs for my birthday dinner. When I called, a gentleman told me that they could not make a reservation because they have to be made 24 hrs in advance (I called at 2/3pm).  Knowing you have a possible 8-9 people coming for dinner, you would think they would be more accommodating and make an exception since a party this size means a solid bill. When I asked the gentleman for more help, he put me on hold to ""talk to his manager"", came back and said that they could only do a call ahead for us. He stated the call ahead wouldn't guarantee us a table. I declined the offer and took my business elsewhere to another restaurant that was much more accommodating. Too bad BJs, you missed out on a nice bill."
Jahlik B.,"Hockley, TX",0,6,,1.0,7/20/2017,My co-workers went ordered from BJ's last week. The food smelled so good I knew I had to try it. We decided to have them deliver to the office today for lunch. I ordered chicken Alfredo with broccoli. My first issue with the website is that it kept requesting we change out delivery time. We waited an hour and a half for a delivery from a place that is 3 miles aways. I received my food and my chicken Alfredo was missing the most important ingredient. There is no sauce on my pasta. None at all. It did come on side. It was not in another bag. How am I supposed to eat The pasta without any sauce. This was very disappointing. I don't plan to ever try this Bj's again.  What a waste.

My other favorite is the parmesan crusted chicken with garlic mashed potatoes,Yummy.  They have an interesting selection of appetizers of which my favorite is the asparagus.  Of course this is BJ's so they have good beers and sessional selections. Now for the best..... Desert, Baked Beignet!!!!!!! Service has never been bad and on the occasion where there was a mistake on the order the manager and waiter took care of it and did not charge for it."

Plenty of tables available but they weren't sitting people because ""the waiters needed to catch up"" we were only a party of 3. The food took a while to come out & they took forever to bring us our check. The waiter was very polite & apologetic but the problem is we only had an hour.  Definitely will try again when not pressed for time."
