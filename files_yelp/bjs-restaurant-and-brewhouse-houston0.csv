Jordan W.,"Houston, TX",167,216,12,5.0,5/16/2014,When I ate there I experienced great service and nice drinks when I tried a strawberry lemonade. I then tried a shrimp pasta entree and it was a great entree with the shrimp and flavors infused in it. Another drink I tried was a soda that reminded me of Kool-Aid. Overall this was a great restaurant and I would recommend this place to anyone who is in interest of great and tasty food.
Chris S.,"Houston, TX",210,227,107,4.0,4/19/2010,"Being that it's closer to my side of town i dont visit here too often b/c it's just that good. Expect it to be crowded here on the weekends and sometimes during the week.  Reading the menu will give you too much to choose from, an aid to  picky eaters. A selection of salads, pasta, burgers, pizza any way you desire to devour, and great grilled chicken dishes. BJ's has everything from bar snacks to filling entree's proven to satisfy. I've been here well over ten times and have never had a bad experience. Attentiveness of the staff gives a welcoming vibe every time. Haven't been to the other location, but in Willowbrook size matters. It can host large groups comfertably.   Hard enough to decide what to eat. I've had nachos for an app, shrimp alfredo pasta, and that eruptive cookie mountain ice-cream dessert dish that smothered everything i've already put down. My stumoch wasn't as happy as my taste buds, but the taste buds always win. Then there's the drink menu. Ya know it's a big menu when they have a separate book to look thru. Cocktails, wine, mojitos, and beer brewed in-house and imported. Drink enough and all of those big screen tv's will go from HD to blurry in a hurry. One of my favorite restuarants in the city, n'joy."
Cassie C.,"Katy, TX",214,59,18,4.0,7/26/2014,Definitely enjoyed this restaurant. It was my first visit. Our waiter was very good and attentive and gave us his best work. The beer selection is AMAZING!! I am a beer fanatic and this has a full bar which makes this place that much better. (: I will recommend this place to others in the future.
Rate T.,"Houston, TX",0,17,1,1.0,10/20/2014,"I tried to give this place another chance a year later. Still such slow service. I won't be giving it another chance.  Also as a weird side note, the waiter was REALLY dirty and was sweating like crazy. We were his only table so I'm not sure what was going on? Gross."
Tom N.,"Houston, TX",0,148,18,4.0,1/2/2016,I was invited to eat here. The food selection was not that bad. My server was friendly and attentive.
Richard B.,"Fort Worth, TX",4,9,13,4.0,11/18/2014,A solid late night food choice and good selection specialty craft beers.
Nate G.,"Magnolia, TX",63,3,,5.0,12/10/2013,"I love this place! Food is delicious, service is wonderful and the in house beer to choose from is so good.  Me my wife and my son are dinner there a couple nights ago, my son was getting a little uneasy being a 2 year old. The server on his own walked up and have him a little snack bag of gold fish. PERFECT held him over till the meal got there! We will most definitely be returning."
Melissa A.,"Atlanta, GA",0,53,,2.0,12/16/2014,"Food wasnt that good but they have a huge variety of foods. Lots of beer on tap but really that was about it. Its always packed too, not really worth the wait."
Pamela H.,"Houston, TX",56,65,156,4.0,10/26/2012,There is a wide selection on food. The enlighten dishes are really good. Santa Fe salad is one of my favs as well as the tapas dishes. Yum. Pizza is amazing. They have a great selection of beers many are there. They are a micro brewery. They do have St Aronlds brewery making most of them now since they do not have enough tanks to supply all their restaurants. They have a happy hour but its only in the bar area. Service is great and some times is horrible depending on who your waiting on you. It is loud with all the people plus the music is too loud. There is no outdoor seating like the one down by Bay Area.
Mishel F.,"Houston, TX",3,17,38,4.0,3/18/2014,"I searched salads and this place was one of the options. I found a few things I may have wanted for dinner on their online menu. When I got there, I had to park in the back because there was no available parking. I walked in and the greet was awkward. Almost like they were forced to greet me. Mannerisms speak loudly. The place was packed. I was seated in a dining area in the two seater booth. My waitress came about ten minutes later to take my order. It was a fair wait because the menu was huge. When the waitress greeted me, I told her it was my first time there. I told her I was interested in the Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos. She said it was great. So I paired it with a Chardonnay and a house salad. I asked for no cheese on the salad and it came immediately with no cheese (the little victories). Perfect size before meal-not too much and not too little. I should've asked for dressing on the side, because it was a bit much. It didn't matter so much because I was hungry. In the midst of my salad, my entree arrived by a new server who was just as nice as the waitress. She asked if I had everything I needed. I mentioned I was waiting on my glass of Chardonnay to be delivered. She went to to check on it. Within the minute, my beautiful glass of wine arrived. Served was two pita tacos and a relish type looking side with beans, corn, seeds, quinoa, oil and spices, cucumber, green peppers, cilantro and barley. There was also a yogurt based sauce for the tacos. The tacos included grilled chicken, feta cheese, cilantro and maybe some veggies. The pairing of Chardonnay was perfect! With a packed restaurant, that has been the best service and food I have had since moving here four weeks ago. Outstanding service was provided to a complete single stranger in town for business. I didn't feel judged or ignored.  I will definitely be returning because the service was excellent."
Nicole H.,"Dallas, TX",325,534,237,4.0,8/28/2012,"BJ's is always a good bet for solid food and good drinks.  I've been to this one a few times now, mostly for lunch, and the service is also solid and even when crowded, we haven't had to wait long for a table.  I consider BJ's a step above a place like Chili's, with better food and atmosphere, but still with decent prices."
Suneel C.,"Houston, TX",51,71,30,4.0,2/9/2013,Typical chain restaurant... I don't know what the reviewers here expect!  Lunch specials are great... beer is good... service is the roll of the dice.  Nothing more that really needs to be said.
Scott M.,"Houston, TX",116,118,32,3.0,1/9/2012,"Yogi said it best.  ""Nobody goes there anymore...it's too crowded"".  I've never been here when there wasn't a wait and the bar wasn't  elbows and asses jammed. I always wonder why that is too. They seem to have a great staff.  Service has always been good.  There is nothing particularly memorable about the food, although their skinny fries are very solid. This last trip I had the baby back ribs.  Tender yes, flavorful no.  A little on the dry side too. Good beers, decent wine list, cool bar, and food that is average.  BJ's is like a watered down gastropub.  If they were really good the crowd would be impossible.  Must be a location thing."
Jenna D.,"Fleming Island, FL",29,97,50,3.0,4/1/2014,Good place to eat.  Nothing is very memorable here though besides the bruschetta appetizer.  Kinda has the sports bar feel to it.  Still trying out their menu and nothing has become my favorite yet so I'll update later.
Jason S.,"Houston, TX",1,75,,4.0,3/11/2014,"This place is one of my favorite places to eat.  They have a very diverse menu, and most things range from good to excellent.  The pizza is fantastic.  The pulled pork sandwich is divine. Fish and chips used to be a go to dish as well.  I've had the angus beef sandwich which is very tasty too. My wife loves their pastas and lately has been eating the chicken tortilla soup.  The kids really love the boneless wings and all the sauces. They have an amazing selection of beer on tap (including one from Stone Brewery which I love to death, St. Arnold's Endeavor and Karbach's Hoppadilla).  They also have a huge selection of Belgian bottled beer.  The BJ beers are all excellent as well as the brewed root beer, cream soda, etc. As for service, they tend to be top notch. The one complaint I have is, everyone else seems to like it too ... it gets very busy at peak hours."
Paisley A.,"Houston, TX",0,5,,5.0,11/10/2015,"Seriously, what is not to love about this place?! The food is always amazing and service is great. I can never resist ordering the Oreo pizookie for dessert... My favorite!"
Peter C.,"Dallas, TX",728,167,1375,4.0,1/17/2010,"I came here to watch the Cowboys/Vikings Game. This place is the BOMB BEEZY!! As the waitress took us to our table, I couldn't help but look at other people's food. It got me really anxious to sit down and order. This place kind of reminds me of Cheesecake Factory for some reason. If you look at my pictures, you can see what I ordered and don't make the same mistake I did and get the deep dish. The small was $10 and I thought to myself ""I could have just ordered from Pizza Hut and got a large deep dish for the same price!"" Don't get me wrong, the pizza was delicious, the price was just a little too much for me.  Overall, I plan to come back again to sample other dishes. Reason for the 4 star is the pricing."
Britni G.,"Austin, TX",111,40,7,4.0,10/12/2012,"If you are a root beer lover... You have to try theirs. They make it in house and it's amazing. The beers they brew are also very good. I particularly like the hefe.  Appetizers are all very good. The spinach artichoke dip, wings, flat bread... All wonderful.  If you are a salad person... Which I am... They have awesome salads. But if you like the heavier stuff... Which I also like... Wonderful pizzas.  And lastly....if you like sweets .... Bazookie! A warm gooey cookie in a pizza pan served fresh from the oven. With ice cream."
Christy P.,"Houston, TX",180,705,22,4.0,9/29/2009,"I really love this place.  What I do not love, is the insane wait to get a table.  I would love to just sit at the bar sometimes, but that too, is way too packed.  Last time I called ahead to put my name on the reservation list and they told me 30 mins.  I show up 30 mins later, and they tell me that people answering the phone were quoting incorrect times and that it'd be 30 more mins.  I left. :(   .  As someone else also mentioned, the seating is kinda awkward, especially if you go there with 1 other person.  Usually end up with a big circular booth to yourselves, so you have to huddle up next to each other to talk, which could be a good or bad thing, depending on your date. ;) Anyway, on to what I do LOVE about this place is the FOOOOD!  Obviously.  The have so many great appetizers to pick from that I almost prefer those over the main courses.  The thin crust appetizer margherita fresca pizza or the one with sausage are really tasty.  They've revamped these appetizer pizzas lately, too, so instead of a small little circle of pizza you get a long rectangular plate of crispy cheese tastiness.  I also tried their new thai shrimp lettuce wraps and they were GREAT!  Good sauce, good shrimp, nice leaves of butter lettuce...they just fell apart when I tried to eat them.  These are appetizers though, mind you. Also really love their california grilled chicken sandwich.  Green chilies, avocado, melted pepper jack, what's not to love?  I won't review every food I've eaten there, but I can honestly say that everything I've eaten there has been delicious.  And you should try a pizookie (picture a big warm, fresh cookie in a tin with a generous scoop of ice cream) and a beer or the berry cider (for the ladies who don't like beer) if you go.  I have never met a pizookie I didn't greatly enjoy...even the ones I initially turned up my nose at ended up being good.  Ok, enough said. :D"
Jennifer D.,"McKinney, TX",0,37,2,1.0,7/7/2015,"I received a reply toy first review of BJ's from a Tiffany a supposedly a representative . After two calls to her per her request , I have received No  Redponce. Wow not really surprised after my experience at the Resturant."
