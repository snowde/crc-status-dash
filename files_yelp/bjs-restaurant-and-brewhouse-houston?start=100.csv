Dee T.,"Kaneohe, HI",0,35,8,4.0,2/7/2017,I don't know if we were just hungry or if the food was that good! We had the beer sampler chicken quesadilla deep dish pizza stuffed mushrooms and the asparagus. .  .all of it was delicious!!!! Very clean and friendly service!!!!!  Would definitely go back!!!
Amber C.,"Houston, TX",24,91,10,5.0,6/9/2016,I have NEVER had a bad experience at the place. The service is always GREAT! The food is always DELICIOUS! And there are MANY BEERS ON TAP. I love coming to the place.
jason j.,"Pearland, TX",2,77,10,1.0,8/2/2016,"Came here to meet family for lunch.  Bad service, super long wait. Food was mediocre at best.   1. Sampler platter.  Had a cheese stick that had no cheese in the center.  Just a hull. The chips for the dip were supper greasy.  The wings and eggroll was ok. 2. Ordered a Dr . pepper. It was fine. But the refill came out flat.  Told that I would need to wait on the mix to get changed out.  Switched to sweet tea.  Never got a refill and was never offered one.   3. Fries that came with my meal were overcooked.  Must have had a fryer issue.  Was not given or offered ketchup for them.  Did not see my waiter again, so could not ask. 4. Tried the chicken bacon ranch piadinas was ok, but seemed a bit overcooked. 5. Did not see our waiter much.  Other people brought our food out.  I did not get refills or condiments.  I will not go back.  This was a very poor dinning experience."
Becky P.,"Murfreesboro, TN",0,20,16,4.0,7/29/2016,Love BJ's. Best place for call ahead seating. No have never had one of their steaks and it was awesome.   Treated my friends to the white macadamia pazookie.   They loved it.
Todd W.,"Buda, TX",81,29,,4.0,8/11/2015,"I really like all of the different beers they have to offer here. I had the Hefeweizen and the PM Porter and they were both great. There is a wide variety of options here so it is a good choice  for almost anyone. I think their prices are a little high for the quality of food(~$14 a meal), but I still enjoyed it.  If you like cookies then get the Pizookie. It's delicious! Overall if you like craft beer or are looking for something a step above Chili's, Applebees, and all of the other casual restaurants, then this is the place to go."
Shardool S.,"Houston, TX",56,20,9,2.0,12/19/2015,Dusty counters and ants all over the booth!  I witnessed them seat 3 couples at the same table that had to move because of the ants !  Not coming back to this place
Leslie T.,"Houston, TX",170,588,263,3.0,5/14/2014,"It's your basic Applebee's, Chili's, Ruby Tuesday clone with some specialty brews. My review should just end there. Anyone who knows those places knows there will be burgers and some fancy overpriced salads and some fried apps. And that's what the menu consists of once you get past the hundred pages of specialty drinks in the front of the menu. I had the basic margarita and it was very sour. I think they need to adjust their mix a bit. Margaritas should be limey tart goodness...but not too puckery. I have tried their brews at another location. If you like craft beers these are pretty decent. You know what you like so sit at the bar and ask for a taste. They'll give you a small glass before you order a pint. The little sliders were your basic tiny buns and tiny meat with some really good pickles. The French Dip was a basic Sammy, nothing to write here about. The thing that really made this place feel pedestrian was my salad. They had what looked like a tasty new salad on the menu: Kale and Brussels sprouts.  Here's the outline: Baby kale, herb-roasted brussels sprouts, romaine, blueberries, red grapes, dried cranberries, goat cheese, cucumber, candied pecans, toasted pepitas and red onions tossed in strawberry vinaigrette.  The waitress brought it to me. I love Brussels sprouts and couldn't wait. I dug around in the thing and there were no Brussels sprouts anywhere. I don't remember seeing blueberries or cranberries either. I told her there were missing parts and she took it away. She came back and said she was sorry they were ""out of Brussels sprouts. But they would be happy to make me something else"". Most of my party was halfway done with their meals and I just told her to take it off our bill. She did.  But really? You brought me a specialty salad with Brussels sprouts in the main description on the menu and the kitchen said nothing about not adding them? It wasn't her fault. It was the kitchen managers fault. Kinda like ordering a bacon cheeseburger and having it come out without the bacon and yet they still charge you for the bacon cheeseburger. Not cool. The place is really loud. If you come in with a large party of 5 or 6 and they steer you toward a horseshoe booth ask if they have a table. Hearing across one of those big things is almost impossible."
Pablo H.,"Houston, TX",78,2,1,5.0,8/7/2016,Great food! They literally have everything. I always use there curbside service on days I want to eat good but don't feel like getting off.
Nikki S.,"Houston, TX",5,438,975,3.0,5/31/2016,My most recent visit was disappointing. It took over an hour to get a deep dish pizza and the pizza had next to no toppings. The pizookies made up for it but I hope it was only a one time thing
Twana C.,"Houston, TX",108,81,264,4.0,5/19/2015,"Pizza, Pizza, Pizza and drinks.  Well the service was sketchy could it been that we had just come from  a Color Run and was not appropriately dressed but I have to say it was not under the NO SHOES, NO SHIRT, NO SERVICE sign.   I go here for the pizza and drinks mostly.  Great place to hang out with your favorite people and have a good time.  The other food is good, too.  For the craft beer lovers there is a slue of beers to choose from.  Never heard of most of them try the beer sampler."
Lauren G.,"Houston, TX",386,74,21,4.0,9/26/2015,"I love coming here! The service is so-so and if you come on the weekend, expect a wait. It's also kinda loud on the weekends because it's connected to a country bar/club and the Parking lot can get pretty packed.  They do have a cool app that you can download and earn rewards. And they have the option to call ahead and get put on the waiting list.  My favorite things from here are the wings, the Parmesan crusted chicken, and of course, the double chocolate pizzookie!! Other really yummy menu items include the chicken lettuce wraps and the pizzas. They also have a nice happy hour."
Kenneth J.,"Houston, TX",52,53,41,3.0,5/18/2015,"This place is better than a lot of other similar restaurants/sports bars in the area with the same sort of menu. Clean, usually friendly staff, huge bar with lots of selections, curb-side carry out, and decent food.  I've mostly come here over the years to get pizzas to-go with the Mediterranean being my families favorite.  It's better than your average take out pizza from other fast food chains. I've also come here a few times for things like graduation dinners and overall everyone enjoyed the experience. Just a solid overall place of your looking to grab a quick bite to eat and a beer. They're open pretty late if your looking for a late dinner."
Misty S.,"Houston, TX",1,34,23,5.0,12/20/2015,"Decided to eat here with my boyfriend and 3yr old son. They provided my son with colors. The waitress was super nice and patient as I always ask a million questions before ordering. She suggested drinks to us. My boyfriend had like four glasses of two different beers (forgot the names) that he enjoyed. I had the Alabama fruity alcoholic beverage and all I needed was one! Very good and strong.  We ordered the lemon pepper wings! Hot and fresh! Didn't take long to come out! Definitely a favorite! Then we had the pepperoni and sausage pizza.. Deep dish. Also very good. My son had their French fries and spaghetti. He enjoyed that. And lastly we had the chocolate chip and macadamia nut cookie with ice cream. They even made the cookie half and half for us cause my bf doesn't like chocolate. Sooo good.  Overall, great experience and we will definitely be back!"
Jessie L.,"Cypress, TX",0,6,1,2.0,3/12/2016,"I was told by my co-workers, that the pizza here is the best. Well... It's far from it. Luke warm when it arrived to our table after 24 minutes, and tasted like typical frozen pizza I could buy at the store. Not impressed. Our server Brandon was attentive, and apologized for the pizza being below sub par. I asked to speak to the manager but no one ever came. I'll just call dominos next time."
Jessica B.,"Houston, TX",3,49,48,3.0,4/11/2016,Has a pretty good beer selection. The only problem was the staff knew nothing about it. Even the house brews
Warren C.,"Austin, TX",1204,99,1077,1.0,12/22/2015,"Lipstick on coffee mug, second one the coffee mug was stuck to the napkin. Server mentioned coffee comes in a bladder type pouch (probably not the most appetizing thing you wanna hear) management really doesn't care - was looking over me as i talked - the last reviewer most likely had a pleasant lunch experience by himself - if it's busy at alllllllllllll - good luck- the staff doesn't have it together."
Kori Y.,"Grand Rapids, MI",50,362,31,4.0,6/14/2014,"Great brewhouse. Had a great choice of beers. And better yet they had a beer flight so you could sample a varity. The Pizza was very good, and what goes better with good beer other than good pizza. I'll be back!"
Don C.,"Jersey Village, TX",124,547,278,4.0,8/26/2012,"First time in- GREAT beers- I tried 3 different ones they brew.  They had chicago style pizza- I was stuck between two choices the waitress suggested ""get half and half if you want"".  Cool. 10 minute wait on a Friday at 9 PM not bad- great place.  A little pricey for pizza but it really was good-  I went for the 2nd smallest for myself and a friend ate a piece- I was pretty full with just that."
Lauren S.,"Houston, TX",5,20,1,5.0,1/28/2015,"I usually would not amply promote any sort of salt-laden chain restaurant, but this is my go-to place to get gluten pizza, if I'm not making it myself.  Huge place, always busy for dinner, but you'll never find yourself screaming at others for them to hear you.  Seating is comfortable, waiters are friendly, but sort of absent when it gets busier.  Full bar, they offer beer flights, decent lunch specials, and have a HUGE dinner menu. I don't think anyone could NOT find something to eat here. When I don't feel like anything greasy, I get a salad. Their salads are delicious here people. Delicious and huge, but definitely not calorie friendly if that's what you're going for. However I do believe they have a list of low-cal items on the menu, which is some sort of grilled (frozen) protein and a heaping serving of (frozen) steamed veggies.  Come on, it's BJ's, it's not going to knock your socks off, but you're certainly not going to be disappointed that you came. I've never had a bad experience personally.  Gluten Freers: Rejoice! This is the best, readily available, casual restaurant gluten free pizza out there (the upper scale pizza award goes to Coal Vines). Did I also mention it is a giant pie, and reheats (baked) well? I t's probably not better than what you make, but when you're feeling lazy, this is the place. They now even offer a gluten free 'pazookie' (sp?)."
Von C.,"Houston, TX",76,57,58,5.0,1/8/2014,"I usually hit up the Chilli's location right next door, but I was looking for a change of pace when I found BJ's. The menu is extensive, and they have great lunch specials.  I got a personal sized pizza and a large Cesar salad for about 7 bucks. I sat at the bar where the bartender was friendly and attentive even though the lunch crowd had her busy.  The BJ's craft beers are only $3.50 at lunch so I tried both the Light Switch and Blond and I was very impressed by both.  They give you samples of the beers to try if you are indecisive like yours truly.  I found my new chill spot."
