Elsa E.,"Houston, TX",147,9,10,4.0,7/16/2015,"They have an extensive menu. Prepare to be undecided. Lol our waitress was very pleasant,helpful, and patient. (Her name is Jackie). The drinks are absolutely delicious! I had the Tickled pink and my bff had A Drink Like That. You have got to try them. They have probably the biggest drink menu I have ever seen!"
Jill S.,"Charlotte, NC",4,12,3,5.0,4/28/2016,Excellent pizza!!! I had the buffalo chicken pizza and it was delicious! It has great flavor with a little bit of spice! I loved it! The service and prices are good too! Would definitely recommend!!!
Allison G.,"Tomball, TX",4,1,,5.0,4/25/2016,"Our server was by far the best server we have ever had at BJ's. She was warm, funny, eager but not pushy, gave us suggestions and she's a definite asset to your staff. My boyfriend & I go to BJ's quite a bit & we can't say enough about our server."
Harrison L.,"Caldwell, TX",5,115,121,4.0,2/6/2015,Always a great place to get dinner late cuz they don't close till midnight! Spring rolls are a great appetizer. I usually get the pork chops or salmon. Food is usually pretty good and it's always nice and clean inside. All the waiters I've had have been quite good. Prices are roughy $15 per person without drink.
Margaret M.,"Spring, TX",32,6,6,1.0,5/12/2016,"Not the best, had better. My steak was to dry, the asparagus was way over cooked, broccoli was terrible. Just was not satisfied with my meal. We ordered the calamari as a appetizer and it was just burned. Not good all. Server was not very well either"
Tom M.,"Spring, TX",0,9,8,2.0,5/12/2016,"All sides of the Spectrum represented here: Service was sub-par.....fried calamari was pretty frikkin fried, too burnt. My wife's sirloin was rough n tuff, the veggies were dry n bland. My cobb salad was good, and gi-normous!. My son's burger was cooked to perfection. The beer was good, but there was no need for a second.... Utter than that, atmosphere was nice...Tables are placed too close to one another My salad and my son's food saved this 2-star rating"
Mike W.,"League City, TX",1,19,16,5.0,2/9/2015,They have a great double IPA.  Great service and the new spicy pig tavern pizza is perfect. The waitstaff are great.
John G.,"El Paso, TX",8,3,,1.0,2/11/2015,"New Tavern cut pizzas are super thin & way overpriced!!! If your looking for an expensive snack for yourself, then this is for you!  Not sure what going on with the menu? Everything good has disappeared, Derek's meatloaf, grilled chicken pasta & now the hand tossed pizzas!"
Mark W.,"Houston, TX",0,3,,1.0,11/26/2016,"The manager was very rude. The food was greasy. The service was terrible. I've been to this  BJ's before, it wasn't this bad. It was a big group, and I know that's a lot to handle, but they couldn't handle it. Manager stared me down as I ate. They didn't deserve my money so I left no tip but here's one for you, don't come to THIS BJ's"
V L.,"Houston, TX",1,61,55,1.0,12/18/2015,"I've been to a Bj's in other states and the food was delicious there. However at this location, it was a completely different story. The food tasted terrible. The service was average, she didn't check back on us.  Let me get back to the food it was a waste of money -- I could've spent less and went to a decent fast food place. It is seriously not worth it. I got the deep dish ravioli & Lemon pepper dry rub wings. They both tasted like TV dinners and the ravioli tasted like canned food. Flavorless and disgusting. My partner got the Sriracha Mac and Cheese. The cheese tasted so fake and you couldn't even taste Sriracha in the sauce. Moral of the story, I was paying double the price for nasty school lunch  food. Will never be back here again. I will only trust the Bj's in other states."
Matthew R.,"Spring, TX",73,15,76,5.0,4/15/2016,"Love this restaurant, great place, great service, great food, & great waiter!  My wife, my child, and I were taken care of and then some.  I wanted to personally thank Ayodeji F. for his awesome service!  I will try to sit in his section again.  Thanks again!!!"
Lucy L.,"Houston, TX",4,89,24,4.0,1/5/2015,"Bjs is pretty consistent with their food and service, I think bad service was one out of 10 for me. Every time I come at least I get one or two Hi meaning I exist and walking among living humans. That usually makes my minute    Since a day sounds too long or exaggerated. It's a jungle out there.  I usually get their blue cheese burger because I know it won't disappoint me, and I usually do not like burgers so that says a lot, or to me t does. Their thin cut fried is awesome, blonde beer tall glass can be enjoyed over the meal and gives me the classy feeling not the chuck chuck chuck feeling hurry up eat your food and get out that I have at some other bar-serves-food places. I have been here more than 10 in the past 6 months and it still is my place to go for burgers. Pretty decent price also for a nice sit down restaurant to enjoy life with family and friends."
Tenia O.,"Houston, TX",376,231,322,3.0,8/27/2013,"I've pass by this place millions of times. Was bored this past Sat. & decided why not give it a try...ended up being a good choice! The set up is like a bigger, better, tad more upscale version of Chilli's. The bar is gorgeous & huge! I dropped in around 11ish, so there were no children there, but this seems to be a place that you can bring the kiddos w/ no problems.  Their special thing is their own craft beers. I tried the blonde ale which was pretty good. Food wise, I went for the fried wontons Thai style & the Corn & Bacon fritters...YUMMY!!! And for $3 each it was a steal. The dipping sauses for both were really good.  Bartender was really sweet. They let you have a taste of the specialty drafts before you order which is a plus. Chatted it up w/ a couple of folks that seem to be regulars. Very nice vibe to the place. Noticed they hustled to keep the place clean & in order even w/ the busy Saturday crowd.  The menu here is HUGE!! In fact, I think this is the only negative thing I can think of from my 1st run. There's sooo much stuff on the menu, it's almost overwhelming. Perhaps if it was designed better it would be a little more eye catching. You open it & there's just words/food everywhere.  I will be going back to try some other things I saw on the menu. The guy next to me ordered the pulled pork & basically drooled on himself eating it. Besides, $20 for 2 apps, a couple beers & tip based on great service...not a bad deal!!"
Raul M.,"Houston, TX",96,178,202,5.0,11/21/2013,"Finally there's a place where I can go enjoy a good cold beer with an tasty burger. The atmosphere here is wonderful here.  We came here on a Friday night so it was pretty packed when we got there and we ended up having to wait. We waited around 25 minutes for a table for 4 including two kids.    Nit long after sitting down, we were fretted by our friendly waitress which offered drink and food suggestions. Of corse I ordered a beer, however I'm not sure what it was but it was good. The waitress said it was brewed locally.  I ordered a burger which was huge and delicious. My wife and kids were also happy with their orders.  Great place  Great service  Great food  :)"
Karina P.,"Spring, TX",263,155,114,4.0,1/31/2014,"After a long while since dining at BJ's, I finally came back this afternoon and I am so glad I did!  I walked in at about 4 p.m., so the place wasn't packed by any means. The service was quick and friendly, and our food was on the table about 20 minutes after placing our order. Since I no longer struggle with a gluten or dairy sensitivity, I deviated from my usual gluten-free pizza order (great selection here for gluten free folks!!) and settled on the Original Roast Beef Dip sandwich with their wedge-cut seasoned fries. After witnessing my mom's bad experience with the French Dip at La Madeleine, I was nervous to try the French Dip sandwich at BJ's, which isn't a ""French cafe"", but it turns out that I had nothing to be nervous about. BJ's does a way better French Dip than La Madeleine! The roast beef inside the sandwich is juicy and tender, and the French roll is doughy and soft-- a great contrast to the savory beef and caramelized onions that are fun to rip apart with your teeth. The au jus has just the right amount of flavor too. I was really impressed. I had a bite of my grandma's avocado egg rolls, which have always been and STILL are delicious.  BJ's is back on my list of favorite chain restaurants. It's accommodating and delicious enough for everyone in my picky family of five to find something to eat."
Brandy M.,"Houston, TX",214,3,,5.0,3/21/2016,"Our waitress was awesome! We had two families with two babies and she,was very attentive and patient. I recommended this place to the friends we had out of town and they loved it. We sincerely enjoyed our dining experience. Please let our server we had, thank you! ( from the families that didn't want mayo on their brisket bacon burgers)"
Ambrianna F.,"Tomball, TX",15,18,9,4.0,7/31/2015,"My date and I enjoyed our experience here! It was a little loud, but we managed just fine. The food was excellent and the waiter was unobtrusive. We ordered the calamari as an appetizer; the breading was a little bland but overall it was good. I had the Roast Beef Dip as an entree. The bread was soggy but the meat was delicious! The crispy fries are amazing. For dessert we split a strawberry beignet, which was really just a mini cake, but it was the perfect ending. Everything was very fresh. I will certainly be returning! The one criticism was that the menu was quite large. It took us quite a long time to decide what to order!"
Carlisa B.,"Houston, TX",92,63,63,4.0,11/2/2013,"Omg that Oreo Pizzokie is fantabulous!!! It's warm with ice cream and Oreo whipped cream! We used the Google Offer  for 2 for $19.95, which includes 2 salads, any Medium pizza (we got the 5 meat pizza...yummo) and the Pizzokie!! Good food...good service!"
Miladie D.,"Houston, TX",10,15,1,5.0,3/9/2016,Our server Alexandrea was great. She was very attentive but didn't make us feel rushed. The food was delicious!
C G.,"Austin, TX",22,129,49,5.0,1/29/2016,I've never had a bad experience here. The food is always good. The pazookies are THE BEST. The Moscow mules are delicious as well as the margaritas.
