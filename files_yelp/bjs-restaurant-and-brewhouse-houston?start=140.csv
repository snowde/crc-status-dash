Suzy C.,"Houston, TX",224,52,171,1.0,9/5/2015,"2 words- HORRIBLE service! Won't even comment on the food. what's the point of dining in for horrible service. Poor management. Atmosphere is sluggish just like the servers. Take your money somewhere else. I used to go here for lunch all the time until something changed and now the food is just fair and the service is just ridiculous- long wait, no service with a smile! Swear we waited 20 min after being seated just to get our drinks, salads took another 40 minutes, when food came out 1 hr later the steaks were overcooked and soup horrible! Waiting for server to bring back our change and close out tickets...Never coming back EVER!"
Tony A.,"Cypresswood Forest, Spring, TX",66,89,39,4.0,1/24/2016,"Bjs is a well known and established place. They have their own brand of beer and each of which are very delicious. (I haven't tried them all) but they brew all varieties (light beer, blondes, dark, wiezen etc). The buffalo chicken deep dish pizza is a MUST try. I order this every time that I go. Service is okay, but it takes more than just doing your job to impress me."
Rob S.,"Spring, TX",2,13,,5.0,2/24/2016,"First time trying the jalapeno burger, won't be the last! Also, there pizza is hard to beat... awesome food there and good benefits if you're a member!"
Trisha P.,"Houston, TX",43,56,8,4.0,12/23/2015,Came here the other night to see what all the buzz was about.  The food was pretty good.  I had the parmesan crusted chicken with broccoli and white cheddar mash potatoes. I was a bit disappointed that i only got 2 semi big pieces of broccoli but it was still delicious.  What really intrigued me was the Brussel sprouts. I would've just ordered that add a meal.  I'm a veggie lover so don't judge me.  Lol everybody else with me lived their food as well.  The sting fries were surprisingly flavorful and my nephew who doesn't like broccoli enjoyed the broccoli in his pasta.  Besides the lack of broccoli on my plate and the waitress Taylor providing just ok services.  Everything was great.  Would definitely come back.
Rebecca B.,"Humble, TX",2,65,3,3.0,1/23/2016,"Fish and chips bland, and bland. Menu so big, but half are beers and drinks. Been to BJs near the woodlands and it was good. This one needs to do better in the cooking department. Service was good, place clean."
Natalie V.,"Huntsville, TX",21,68,88,4.0,12/29/2013,Pretty good. Was our first time. So we ordered the avocado egg rolls (recommended by a friend of ours) they weren't too bad. Got the Jeremiah red beer (Irish red).  And settled with the lunch specials the mauhi mauhi tacos with chips and salsa. Delicious. First time and will probably go again.
Keith B.,"Pompano Beach, FL",138,444,2,4.0,5/23/2013,"Out of town on business, we were looking for a place that had a variety.   We have BJ's near where I live, but never been to one.      This place was great.     Beers are awesome (I did a sampler).    We ordered the chicken lettuce wraps and the yellow mustard sauce was awesome. I had a turkey burger with cheese and avocado and it was great. Can't wait to go to my local place when I get back."
Foodman T.,"Flushing, NY",5,43,11,5.0,10/24/2015,"Excellent food! Food has been consistantly great, nice selection of beer ! Very comfortable and relaxed environment ! Servers are very friendly and helpful !"
Mark B.,"South Burlington, VT",117,112,1,3.0,8/3/2014,"Take a standard chain of mediocrity, and add mediocre beer brewed in house. Not to say that it's a terrible place; it isn't. But it's not like super stand out either. I had a chicken dish that was very flavorful...it was a crusted parmesan with a nice sauce. Service was very good. Staff were friendly. Where it kinda goes wrong is with the beer. I'm a beer snob, I'll admit. I've had everything from Heady Topper to MGD, and I know how to make every style, and have tasted some of the best of each. Their beers are just OK. What makes it worse is the knowledge of the staff. First, you're not supposed to touch the tap to the glass, nor overfill above the tap. But that's a minor infraction. Where it gets worse is when you have no clue how to serve the varieties you offer. My IPA was served in a pilsner glass. That's the very tall, narrow, V shaped glass. Which totally KILLS the hoppy aromas of an IPA. You can't properly immerse your nose in them, like with a proper tulip or IPA glass.  Then I decided to get a Paulaner Hefeweizen instead, as they had it on draft, and I figured that would be better. It was not served in the tall, curvy ""Weißbier"" glass, but in a standard American pint glass instead. Again, the glass design enhances the beer - most places that serve Hefeweizen, that claim to be brewpubs, and make the motions would know these things. A Hefeweizen glass has the curves to catch sediments and the yeast, and also enhances the aromas of that style beer. I asked the bartender about it and he sheepishly admitted they only had the two types of glasses; he genuinely seemed ashamed that someone had called them out on it."
Ryan B.,"Rapid City, SD",111,11,2,5.0,12/22/2015,"First time going and it well exceeded my expectations. The service was excellent and the food was absolutely scrumptious. I personally ordered the ""Seared Ahi Salad"" and it was delicious. My girlfriend ordered the Italian style pizza and shared some and I have to say that it was very good as well."
Nathaniel M.,"Houston, TX",87,14,30,3.0,6/10/2014,"It's a cross between a restaurant and a bar. Have lots of TV for watching sports and atmosphere is pretty laid back. Portions are not bad and price is decent. I think they take a little long to get your food. If you have more than 8 in a group, expect at least 30 min wait to get your food. It was 3 of us that were there to eat and it took about a good 20 mins to get our food."
Alvin J.,"San Jose, CA",177,389,2,3.0,3/14/2013,"This place is pretty similar to Champps Americana and Brick House Tavern, but it feels a little nicer/more elegant, or as elegant as a sports bar can be. There is not too many nice places around my office but BJ's does the trick for work lunch, especially since the place is big and the service is quick. They have good lunch specials, and the menu is very long so there's a range of choices, even if you're vegetarian or are counting calories. My favorite is the soup/sandwich combo; their tortilla soup in particular is tasty. The beer is decent. Some good ones (Piranha Pale and the Hefeweizen) and some clunkers. All in all, for this part of town you could do worse"
Zippy A.,"Houston, TX",0,54,1,4.0,11/1/2015,"Great food, huge menu, and always good waitstaff. I enjoy this place and its even open late!!!!! Also, this is a wonderful place to see a game! Wifi is free and you can get a BJ's rewards card to earn free meals! They also have coupons and bogo deals from time to time!!!! The pizookie is a must have!!!"
Monica T.,"Houston, TX",237,112,19,4.0,7/6/2014,"Came on a busy night, but was still seated relatively quickly. I ordered parmesan crusted chicken, and it was satisfying. Unfortunately, before I got the entree, they managed to lose my order in the mix, so I actually got it late, but then the waiter brought me out a full sized pizookie to make up for it. The pizookie was amazing, so I was pretty happy with my visit."
Susan D.,"Cypress, TX",0,4,1,2.0,3/13/2016,We waited 10 minutes after being seated to have our drink order taken.  We waited another 10 minutes to get 2 beers and 2 soft drinks.  The restaurant was not crowded at all. We got there after 11:00 on a Sunday night. Our food took at least 25 minutes to come out. The food was tasty enough.  My daughter asked for a drink refill and ranch for her french fries when her food was delivered. She was finished with her steak by the time the waitress came back by our table. We had to remind her about the refill and ranch. By the time it was delivered the fries were ice cold and she didn't need the ranch after all. Our feeling about our experience tonight would have been so much better if we had had service.  There was no apparent manager checking on things.  The bar tender stayed behind the bar taking constant care of the 4 people that were there.  The hostess just stood there.
C D.,"Houston, TX",1,55,22,2.0,5/2/2015,Extremely slow service. Staff doesn't seem well trained. Always reaching over you to serve someone else or to pour or serve a drink. The food is decent but I feel like you can get that average kind of food anywhere. I'd give it two stars just because service is lacking.
Danielle L.,"Houston, TX",44,14,3,5.0,10/15/2015,"I love this place...  the food is good, the service is great and if you have any issues they try to resolve them for you.  Love love love the Peanut Butter Smores Pizookie!"
Greg M.,"Houston, TX",0,36,6,4.0,12/29/2015,"Now, I know that Yelp gives it a 3.9 or so.....but we really enjoyed this place! Again, don't expect a 5-Star restaurant....it is what it is.....and what we had was great! Thin crust appetizer pepperoni pizza...rib-eye medium...calimari...chicken strips...hamburgers....it was fantastic, great....come on people...sometimes you are too critical....great bar, clean....nice decor....good draft beers.....If you have a little money...it is well worth it.....Good prices for what you get...nice serving sizes...."
Daniel G.,"Houston, TX",159,11,3,4.0,12/26/2015,"My latest visit to BJ's was on Saturday Dec 12 2015. It wasnt too busy so our waiter was very attentive and friendly. I ordered a small deep dish sweet pig pizza which was AMAZING, a order of beef sliders which was ok, and of course for dessert i got a white chocolate macadamia nut pizookie. The best part of my visit was def the pizookie! If i could remember my servers name i'd def give him a shout out bc he was amazing with the drink refills. I'd rate my visit a 9 out of 10 only because the sliders could have been better."
Jan F.,"Kingwood, TX",20,25,1,4.0,10/1/2015,"I love this place. I've had many things on the menu, tasted most, if not all, of their beers, and haven't had a bad thing yet! I first learned of BJ's while working in CA. They're a little far from my house, but they are expecting to open another restaurant in my area, Kingwood/Humble.  Can't wait!"
