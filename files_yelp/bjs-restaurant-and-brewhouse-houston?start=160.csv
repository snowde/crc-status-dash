Lea S.,"Houston, TX",11,53,251,5.0,4/8/2014,"I freaking LOVE this place! I have been here many times! Dates with the hubs, girls night out,family time, & have even ordered to go The alcohol selection is FABULOUS! I can't wait to have this baby becaue when I do I WILL be coming here for my 1st drink after I have my angel on my 1st official girls night ;)  All of the food is wonderful here! I ALWAYS try to get something different but it's hard knowing how yummy the avocado egg rolls are! The ahi tuna is fabulous but they no longer have it on the menu but you can ask your waiter for it & the chefs will still make it for you (winning lol). The deep dish pizza is out of this world good & would go great with a blue moon! My son loved his mini cheeseburger sliders he got too! Others we have enjoyed are: Fried Artichokes, gourmet Mac & Cheese, spinach artichoke dip, chicken lettuce wraps, & the sante fe rolls! Our service has always been good even when they are busy!"
Judy P.,"Hamilton, MT",23,12,,1.0,6/24/2016,"My family went in two nights ago.  I have always loved the grilled shrimp tacos....they have changed so much....not sure what that crap was on the top in placed of the cabbage slaw and the gaucamole sauce was so spicy i couldn't even eat it. The tacos was also spicy and the tortillas were very chewy.  Another family member ordered the blackened shrimp tacos and they were also too spicy.  Those prior tacos were the best in town....now the worst.  IF IT AIN'T BROKE, DON'T FIX IT!!!  We complained but nothing happened, the manager didn't even come to our table.  Worst ever!!!!"
Mike B.,"Cypress, TX",12,91,31,4.0,4/14/2014,"Great lunch special. A coworker and I both ate for $18.00. That a great deal.  He had the soup and sandwich. I had the BBQ lunch. The slider was excellent, the chicken was ok.  Very big portions.  Very clean and super service. Our waiter Troy was on the ball. He knew the menu , he was on top of the drinks and you could tell that he liked what he did.  Try the tuna tataki. It is one of the best things on the menu.  The manager at this location is on point. Super Clean restaurant. Fast Food. Excellent service. A greeter with a smile.  What more could you ask for?"
Matthias M.,"Schweitenkirchen, Germany",5,1,,3.0,9/21/2015,Has seen better times. Been here at every visot in Houston. Seen beter service and food   before
Todd M.,"Houston, TX",73,444,255,4.0,4/16/2014,"I like BJ's mostly for the beer. They have an excellent selection of craft beer and at very reasonable prices. They also have bar bites like stuffed mushrooms and corn fritters for under $5. Restaurant is very clean, updated and great for casual lunch / dinner / family or dates. Staff has always been excellent.  This is one of my top spots in NW Houston, 249/1960 area for catching a beer and snacking on some bar bites."
Rhi M.,"Houston, TX",39,160,16,2.0,5/15/2015,"The service here was sad... As in it was painful to wait 90 minutes for food, especially with children!!! Food was average for a chain restaurant in Cypress."
Imagine P.,"Houston, TX",14,70,115,4.0,7/2/2014,"I've never had any complaints about bj's brewhouse, they have a wide arrange of food on there menu. The service is normally an A+ and everyone is very attentive,food is always tasty! If you are a sucker for a great desert definitely have a pazooki and even better they have a selection of great beers! It's a chill place to go and have a good meal. :)"
Ramonica C.,"Houston, TX",184,3,1,4.0,2/7/2015,"Visited this place last night and it was good. The lettuce wraps were delicious and drinks are okay. The have reverse happy hour from 9-11 pm the only spot in this area that does ... I believe. I've been twice now and I'd highly recommend it. Service is pretty quick, immediate seating no waiting, and comfortable environment."
Luar L.,"Spring, TX",0,17,10,5.0,6/12/2015,We had a larger than normal group  of 12 people. The wait was a bit long but expected with such a large group. They gave us two servers which were very attentive. Our drinks and food came out hot within a reasonable time frame. No complaints. Thanks
Shay T.,"Houston, TX",135,58,175,5.0,10/28/2014,"For an Appetizer we had the "" California Club Flatbread Pizza "" which was Very Good!!! For my Entree I had a Salad "" Honey-Crisp Chicken Salad "" $12.95 which was Excellent!!! It was Super Fresh & pretty big as I struggled to finish it, but I just had to because it was SoOoo Good!! The customer service is always A1 here  I'll be back soon."
Crystal S.,"Cypress, TX",24,87,69,5.0,4/14/2014,"Great food. I've ate here several times for lunch. I've had the fried chicken with mashed potatoes, the mahi-mahi fish tacos, and of course the pizza. It has all been delicious. The staff is always friendly. If you go for lunch, get there by 11:30. It can get really crowded"
Lamb C.,"Plano, TX",45,9,,4.0,8/13/2015,"Pretty cool. I had a the bacon, brisket burger. It was really good. Also tried the chicken Parmesan with lemon. It was also tasty. It tasted better after time."
Coco B.,"Cypress, TX",27,39,24,4.0,12/20/2014,"Definitely try the BJ`s Burger. It was moist, fresh, and just plain delicious. They have a full bar and the house drinks are pretty yummy. I don't remember which one I got (it was that good). This is a cool place for a casual date night."
Jason S.,"Houston, TX",3,95,16,3.0,9/13/2013,"This place used to be great. Now it's just good. In its heyday, they had $2 crafts beers on Tuesday, $5 mini pizzas, happy hour restaurant-wide (you didn't have to sit at the bar for specials), and a friendly consistent staff that took care of their regulars. But that's long gone. Now its just $1 off beers (so they're like $4.50 on special), happy hour only in the bar, and varied staff with high turn over. Not quite the place it used to be. But that aside, food is still good - especially the pizzas. Their craft beers are expensive but good (though if you are already into craft beer, they are a little lighter in taste). And while the staff is varied, they are still friendly. Place gets packed at peak hours - so come off-hours or be ready to wait."
Bobby A.,"La Grange, TX",0,46,4,4.0,4/7/2014,"Good, fast, friendly service. Waiter knew his stuff.  Food was good - lemon chicken with angel hair pasta and artichokes in a cream sauce. Good portions, well presented.  Had the avocado egg rolls with tamarind dipping sauce - good mix of flavors.  Only complaint is that the main course came out before the appetizer.  I would definitely go back."
Linh P.,"Houston, TX",0,2,1,3.0,7/4/2015,Ordered the BJ deep dish pizza. It was good but the service sucks!!! They didn't refill any of our drinks are ask how we were doing but when it was time to pay they were there in a flash!!
Anji A.,"Los Angeles, CA",130,124,931,4.0,8/26/2011,"Wow. I was pretty impressed! I don't usually go for the big chain restaurants, but it was a convenient place to meet an out of town friend. We expected to get maybe a pin or two of one of their delicious beers, and call it a day. But we walked in during the lunch hour, and seeing everyone else eating, we of course indulged in a few mini-plates. (Pigs, I know). Here's what we had: BJ Brewhouse Blonde Nobile Sauv Blanc- yum! Fresh Mozzarella and Tomato Salad Seared Ahi Crispy Fried Artichokes Margherita Fresca Pizza Seriously, we walked out for all of these for just $30 buckaroos. The small plates were only $3 to $4 a piece, pizza about $8 and the drinks $6 and $7. I didn't realize they had such reasonable options, and having these types of ""bar bites"" was just fantastic. I'll look forward to stopping in to other BJ locations, I definitely had a surprisingly pleasant visit. :)"
Spunke S.,"Houston, TX",102,43,75,5.0,3/19/2014,I love this place! My work comes here often for lunches and we try to get here right when they open because after 12pm it is a mad house! I really like they chicken tortilla soup! Its the best and the presentation is spot on.  My favorite drink to get here is a long island iced tea. I never have to order more then one! Plus on your birthday they give you a free pizzookie!
Diana G.,"Houston, TX",1,8,,5.0,6/9/2015,Love this place. I've been there multiple times and it keeps me coming back. The service is good and the drinks/food are great!
Jacob R.,"Houston, TX",0,5,,4.0,7/13/2015,"I normally go to BJ's in Pearland to meet friends, but this one in the Willowbrook area is great! I came in with a small group and we had some great drinks, but the food was average this time. The pizookies never fail us, the salted caramel is my favorite."
