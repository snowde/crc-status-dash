Isabel C.,"Houston, TX",178,96,17,3.0,1/9/2014,"We decided to go to BJ's for a co-worker's going-away luncheon. The invitation ballooned and what was originally a 12 person lunch turned into a 20 person lunch.  The staff at BJ's was very accomodating and they moved us over to a small area off to the side and one of the managers stepped up to help take orders and move the dining experience along. It only took 1.5 hours from seating to paying the bill, which for such a large party is a great feat.  Although the service was really good, I can't say that the food was any sort of spectaular, which is what holds my rating back. I ordered the Half sandwich, half soup + fries.  The California Chicken sandwich, which seemed to have an abundance of mayo on it, was decent. I enjoy a dollop of mayo to add some fatty goodness; however, I don't enjoy having globs of it spilling out onto my plate and my fries.  The chicken noodle soup was akin to what I could find in a can, but it still hit the spot and expectations. The chose the shoestring potato fries because I like the crispiness to starch ratio. They were well-cooked, but underseasoned. All-in-all it was an enjoyable dining experience and I appreciate the staff at BJ's for being able to handle our seemingly ever expanding party."
Noor-Hal C.,"Houston, TX",9,107,,4.0,4/13/2015,"Went to have dinner for one of my friends because it was her birthday and we really enjoyed the food! We shared a pizza and got some appetizers. We got the Crispy Fried Artichokes and Crispy Calamari. We got as well the Classic Tavern Cut Pizza and it was delicious. The service was really nice, our waitress came frequently to check on us if we needed something, even though the place was crowded! Worth checking the rest of the menu :D"
Liliana P.,"Houston, TX",0,13,1,4.0,4/11/2015,"Food is amazing! I had the crispy jalapeño burger, sooo good! Their wedge fries were also super good! I also had a strawberry patch mixed drink & it was the perfect balance of sweet & strong. The selection of beers is pretty extensive. It explains what category each beer lands on & what it tastes like. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5, is because our service sucked really bad. Our waitress would hardly come to check on us & we were constantly looking for her & waiting to order more drinks/condiments/etc. definitely coming back though for their food!"
Jassmine B.,"Houston, TX",0,5,1,4.0,4/8/2016,Great atmosphere and drinks. The salmon unfortunately didn't stand up to that. I can say my boyfriends barbacoa chicken was delicious. Will go back just won't be ordering the salmon
Nicole R.,"Houston, TX",7,17,3,3.0,2/20/2014,The Morrocan Salmon was just okay..wouldn't suggest it if you are super hungry. GET THE PAZZOKIE! The restaurant service is good as well as the food I just didn't get the best entree that time.
Jay Theron P.,"Houston, TX",51,47,9,4.0,1/13/2012,"I love this place...except for some of their appetizers...but the local beer selection...darker beer selection is very tasty with great pricing.   Tip:  If you come on the weekend, get a seat at the bar area.  You will be served quicker and your food will come out sooner...it's just weird like that.  Every time I have been seated elsewhere, the service was less than appreciated and the food came out relatively cold."
Rachel B.,"Houston, TX",445,193,103,3.0,12/16/2012,"I'm really torn on my feelings about this place. I tend to frequent here with friends who live in the area because it's  well known landmark in the Willowbrook area. The menu is really hit or miss. Must try: Any type of pizza and the southwestern spring rolls.  Not to try: California chicken sandwich and pretty much any pasta dish.  The real reason I allow myself to meander through their heavy double doors is for the beer.  It is nice to go to a chain and find an exciting beer menu. The Hopstorm IPA is a personal fav.  If you happen land one of their few and far between ""good"" waiters then I would advise you to pick their brain about what you should choose. Had a lovely girl give me a run down on the list. Much appreciated ma'am. Waitstaff here makes me a touch mad. On 2 separate occasions I have had just bazaar incidents happen with different waiters. One man took 20 minutes to run my credit card on a very slow night. Second was someone who wasn't even waiting our table who delivered the food by slamming it down without a word and walked away. Rude. I've been told there is a waiter here that looks exactly like Obama. I for one will continue to go back to get the opportunity to witness this myself."
Samir N.,"Royal Oak, MI",219,472,1,2.0,10/11/2013,"For a chain, the beer actually has flavor and is not different colored versions of the same watered down stuff.  They had lots of TVs everywhere to catch Sunday football, but they were all along the outside walls so you had to contort yourself or strain to see them.  Is this a Willowbrook thing?   I also tried the pizzookie - vanilla on chocolate.  It did not meet my [overly high] expectations.  By the time I finished my beers, the check came out.  I guess the waiter did not want me ordering other beers (they had non-BJs beer that I would have liked to try)."
Betsy R.,"Houston, TX",41,26,11,1.0,11/11/2013,"The food was so-so but not worth the price or the wait that Jeniffer A. gave us by spending half her time gossiping with other waitresses. My fiancé ordered the parm. crusted chicken, which I have had and loved at other locations. They ruined it. My jambalaya was okay though it shod have been spicier and they had nothing to spice it up. Waited probably fifteen or more minutes between empty drinks and refills. Our table was not buses between courses. Avoid if you can. Don't go in with high expectations if you must."
Arturo Y.,"Leander, TX",20,124,338,3.0,10/9/2011,"Decent food - like the Shareable Appetizers more then the Entrees.  Like the Pot Stickers and the Wings - Like the BJ Beers also -  Been going to this particular restaurant for several years - still very ""new"" and well maintained. (usually very good service - can be some wait if you pick a busy time...)"
Ashley W.,"Houston, TX",0,2,,2.0,5/20/2015,"We loved going to BJ's where we used to live and decided to give this one a try since it was close to our house. We won't make that mistake again.  First, we asked for a booth and were told very matter of fact by the hostess that there were no booths available. Umm.. we spotted 2 open and we were being seated immediately upon walking in so we know they were not already designated for another table. I'm assuming they needed us to sit in someones section to balance out the servers tables. Not my problem.  Second, we end up sitting at a regular table and not making a fuss even though we can still see the two open booths. But the real problem began when our waitress introduced herself. She was as the lady behind me said, ""sour.. that's girl is just sour! No smile, no manners, just here's your food now can you pay?"" Lady, I couldn't have said it better myself.  I worked in retail in college.. I know what it's like to work with the public. You catch more bees with honey than vinegar. The final straw was the mix up on our food. My husband ordered a salad to come out before his meal. 25 minutes after ordering... here comes our meal. No salad. So he stops another server because of course we can't find ours and the guy disappears. Here comes the hostess asking what type of salad it was.. 10 minutes later, meals are finished.. here comes the waitress asking what kind of salad it was? No I'm sorry.. No discount on our meal.. Nope. Just some lousy excuse that it was put in a to go box and misplaced. Okay. Sure. Not buying this excuse. Just own up to forgetting to put it in for the order. Being humble is better than blaming someone else.  Sad to say, we will not be going back to this BJ's."
Jessica M.,"Cypress, TX",94,248,94,4.0,1/7/2013,I really like this place and Happy Hour is pretty good. Lasts until 7 I think but at the bar only I believe.  I have never had anything I don't like at this place and I love the variety of beers.
Lawrence V.,"Houston, TX",152,140,197,5.0,6/15/2013,Really good homemade tasting pizza
Hilary A.,"New Orleans, LA",129,150,76,3.0,12/22/2010,"I went here for lunch with two friends today, a Wednesday around 11:30. The parking lot was packed! I had no idea it would be so crowded.  When we went in, the hostess and the other people at the host stand ignored us; finally, a waiter addressed us (after looking around, wondering why no one else was). We were seated right away, and the hostess turned the menu to the lunch menu for us. When our waiter came, he told us he was sleepy. Awkward. I asked a question, and he answered it equally awkwardly, then walked away to serve another table. Yikes.  I ordered a caesar salad and half a ""giant stuffed baked potato"" (which cost me $9 including 20% tip). The salad portion was very good and tasted and looked fresh. I asked for the baked potato to be loaded but without sour cream. They brought me butter with chives in it? That seemed strange to me. The baked potato also had way too much cheese on it (it was covered!), and just looked generally unappetizing. One friend ordered the chicken fingers and had plenty left over. The other friend had a salad and the broccoli cheddar soup, which she complained was almost too stringy (melted cheese) to eat.  I've been to this restaurant at this location before, but not in awhile. I recall having a better experience in the past, and would also recommend the pizzookie. Tip: Lots of people were drinking beer at lunch, so don't feel too bad if you want to get your mid-day drink on!"
John E.,"Mandeville, LA",93,20,,2.0,2/6/2015,"Boy, this place has so much potential with 5 star beer, but the food is 3 star, they fail so much on one aspect that is ridiculous.  Wifi.   There is absolutely NO phone bars (T-Mobile) and then I go to their ""wifi"" and get to watch my phone and computer try to get connection FOR A FRICKING HOUR.  I feel like I went back in time to my dial-up modem just to re-live the ultimate frustration of having the POTENTIAL of having internet, but failing at the last minute.  Seriously, I have things to do, and don't have time to waste on waiting for something that even momandpop coffee shops seem to do, which is give me access to the world.  Please let me know when you have decided to spend the extra $55 bucks a month for decent wifi, and I will reward you by buying more beer and possibly food.  Cheers!"
Jason B.,"Houston, TX",13,10,,2.0,8/18/2014,"Quite expensive... over a hundred dollars for a few beers for a few friends. 10 dollar beers? Here ya go! Oh, also, allow us to have our ceiling drip water on you and your food, Thanks for comping an appetizer, but you might have considered moving us...  Not good enough to revisit for me. Although food was decent, if expensive."
DeWayne R.,"Houston, TX",161,567,283,4.0,3/29/2013,Nice atmosphere and pretty good food! Great people!
Chandra A.,"Dallas, TX",82,31,25,2.0,2/16/2015,"Visiting from out of town and was underwhelmed with the preparation of their signature dish, Crusted Parmesan. Chicken ""breast"" was so thin it was dry on the edges and tough to cut. Another guest underwhelmed with her buffalo wings. Hard to tell if this was a bad day for the chef or if this site is not up to the typical BJ standards."
E. C.,"Houston, TX",0,14,,3.0,1/1/2016,Ugh.  I don't know what all the excitement about this place is about.  I didn't enjoy the food or the atmosphere.  Too noisy and tables are too close together.  Food choices are unhealthy.
Emre C.,"Houston, TX",8,47,3,4.0,9/1/2012,"Your typical Bjs. Service has been good the three times I've been here. A little better than your average chain as far as atmosphere goes, great for large groups or social gatherings.  If you've never been here, the Pizookie cookies are amazing for desert. The pizzas are the same quality as pizza chains like Papa Johns or Dominos or w/e. The presentation is much better though and you can easily share a medium pizza with two people, or even three if you don't feel like stuffing yourselves."
