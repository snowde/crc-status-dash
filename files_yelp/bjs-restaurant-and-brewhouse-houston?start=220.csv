Alicia J.,"Austin, TX",135,303,14,4.0,8/9/2011,"I feel like I've had an abnormal amount of gluten free pizza lately, but I'm just making up for lost time. I'm just thankful people are offering it now. BJ's isn't the best GF pizza I've had, but it certainly isn't the worst. (Looking at you, Austin's Pizza.) Bonus points to them for brushing an herb butter of some sort on the crust before baking, and for what looks like herbs mixed into the actual crust as well. Now there's something you don't find often in a gluten free crust. All of my love and all of my kisses for that gluten free pizookie, though. It's not often you find a GF item on the dessert menu that isn't flan/creme brulee/ice cream/sorbet and it was DELICIOUS. My co-diners said they couldn't even taste a difference in the cookie, and it was soft, gooey, and fresh-out-of-the-oven delicious when served. The best part of this dining experience (for me) was that I didn't have to ask if they had a gluten free menu. All GF items were clearly labeled and even advertised in the standard menu. I don't like people fussing over me or paying special attention, so being able to flip through and order from the same menu as everyone else was a really nice touch. Kudos to BJ's for giving me the best chain restaurant dining experience of recent memory!"
Marshall J.,"Austin, TX",633,480,272,4.0,8/7/2011,"My wife and I have gotten consistently horrible service everywhere we've gone for the last two months. BJ's broke the spell tonight--our server was friendly without being schmoozy and helpful without being obtrusive. Great beer selection and variety for a place that, honestly, looks like a T.G.I. Friday's."
Michelle N.,"West Hollywood, CA",930,246,1971,3.0,4/1/2010,"I was in Houston for ONE day for business and my clients wanted to come here.  They are 2 middle aged ladies who most likely have a limited palate so they chose this place for our business lunch.  Go figure.. The restaurant is located in a very nice area - hello!  Willo Brook! I'm from Dallas and I even know about the area.  We walk in around 1 and the place is full of people in business attire.  Yep... just as expected.  It wasn't too crazy and there wasn't a wait.   This BJ's looks like any other BJ's I've been to but I like it.  BJ's are always clean and kept up.  I open the menu and found new items on the menu!  I decided to go somewhat healthy and ordered the Salmon Teriyaki dish.  The menu indicated it was served over STICKY white rice.  Hmm.. ok?   Portion was just right for lunch.... BUT the entree itself was ok.  They give you plenty of salmon so be happy to hear they don't skimp out on that.  It was the sauce!  Omg.. it was too sweet, salty, and thick for me.  I was to the point where I was looking for rice where the sauce had not touched it yet so I could tone down the taste.  Also, the rice is not sticky.. it's not just normal white rice.  Or maybe its sticky because of the sauce??  *shrugs* Overall... the food is okay.  I don't hate it but I don't love it.  The menu is humongo so you should always find something you're in the mood for."
Ryan V.,"Spring, TX",11,234,3,3.0,5/20/2012,"Been here a couple times for the pizza, which is amazing! But at the end of the day it's just pizza, and this place is kinda expensive. They have nice tasty rootbeers though (like brewed I think, not regular ones) I haven't sought out BJs for a while though, and the desire just isn't really there :-/ Good place though, would go back, just too chainey and busy in my opinion to go to by default."
Keith B.,"Houston, TX",1,52,,4.0,5/21/2015,This is the only location I've been to but the food is usually very good and the service to match. It depends as with any restaurant with how busy they are but usually it's great. The menu is a bit overwhelming at first but once you skim through it usually you have an idea of what you want to order. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for something new. The atmosphere is great and the food as well.
Jenn L.,"Houston, TX",74,238,236,4.0,2/8/2014,"This is my third time visiting BJ's. I would say their staff is friendly and the food is pretty good. I've tried their deep-dish pizzas, Spinach stuffed mushrooms, Gourtmet Mac & Cheese, Louisiana style Pasta, Jumbalaya, Pizookies, and cocktails. -Spinach stuffed mushrooms- I would say it's a 5/5. The sauce is pretty good and they don't drench the mushrooms with the sauce which was a plus. -Gourmet Mac & Cheese- 3/5, I would say it's a little different from the mac and cheese most people imagine. The cheese is on the light side and it's not saucey like most mac and cheese dishes. The presentation of the mac and cheese was really nice but I've had better. -Deep dish pizza- 3/5, the Gourmet five meat pizza is really good but when I think of deep-dish I think of Chicago style deep-dish. The pizza isn't as cheesy but the pizza is good. Meat lovers should try the Gourmet five meat. I've tried their pepperoni pizza and it was average. -Pizookie- 5/5 AMAZING. All of their pizookies are good. However, the triple chocolate is definitely for chocolate lovers. SO sweet and very chocolate-y/. I usually stick with Cookies and cream and White Macadamia nut pizookie. Red velvet is pretty good, too. You can sample 3 pizookies for  $10.  -Jack lemonade is pretty good. Definitely sweet with a hint of Jack.  -Louisiana style pasta/ Jumbalaya-  3/5.  Service is 4/5."
Emily A.,"Miami, FL",25,46,56,5.0,3/8/2014,"I had an excellent chicken Parmesan that was juicy and tender - the waitress was pleasant and sweet and thoughtful and she smiles frequently, which was nice. The first time I went to this restaurant was in Miami and I had deep dish pizza that was decent but.not fabulous. This time I got Parmesan chicken with cheddar mashed potatoes that were really yummy. Plus my green beans were cooked perfectly. Very nicely done BJ's!!!"
Ruben Q.,"Florence, KY",1,28,3,4.0,5/10/2014,"Pretty dope place, the avocado egg rolls Are by far the best appetizer I've ever had, I usually get them with ranch instead for the sauce they come with it fits the salty taste way better. Hard to go wrong here sweet pig pizza is awesome. They will customize pizzas too."
Laura W.,"Katy, TX",168,312,188,4.0,8/22/2011,"You can't go wrong with BJ's. They have a very large menu so you're bound to find something at this restaurant that you're want to eat and it'll be delicious! They have everything from pizza, to pasta, burgers, sandwiches, salads, soups, and appetizers galore! And their drink and beer menu will quinch your thirst as well! Don't forget to try their one-of-a-kind pazookies for dessert! They even have mini ones that you can have just for yourself. I recommend the white chocolate macadamian nut one! Yum! I would definitely suggest BJ's for a girl's night out, a night out with the boys, a fun family outing or even a quick lunch."
Jessica H.,"Houston, TX",0,21,,4.0,7/17/2014,"I love this place! Im a huge fan of their chicken caesar salad!  My boyfriend and I went their for lunch and we both got a dessert and our bill was only $25, thats GREAT in my book! Im also a member of their rewards program, so for every dollar I spend I get a point and those points get you great rewards. I love this place, I always end up having my birthday dinners and other special occasions here.  The only down side is I've experienced both AMAZING waiters and absolutely terrible ones. However, the great ones always outshine the bad ones, and the food is still GREAT!"
Stacey L.,"Magnolia, TX",0,22,4,2.0,11/8/2015,"Once upon a time I loved to eat at BJ's, the food was great, but lately, the last few times I've gone the food has gone downhill. The avacado egg rolls use to be my favorite but the last couple times they have been mushy & not sealed or wrapped very well, and end up as just big mess all over my plate. I also got the siracha chicken bacon Mac n cheese. IT WAS TERRIBLE!! $13 for a Mac n cheese made with powdered cheese!! I thought it might be just me, so I had the other 3 people at my table try it, they said the same thing, you could taste the powder, it was gross. And no idea where the siracha came in, it had no spice to it at all. I'm not sure if they got new chefs or what but the quality of the food is just terrible. Last time I got a burger, no flavor to it what so ever, it was just a burger, 5 Guys is 1000 times better & way cheaper.  The beer selection is the ONLY reason they got 2 stars from me."
Allyson A.,"Cypress, TX",214,699,26,4.0,11/22/2011,Mini pizzas are tasty and go great the a beer. Half off on Sundays while the games are on. My favorite is the grilled ham and cheese sandwich with tomato bisque soup. Yummy!!
Hillary B.,"Houston, TX",0,11,1,1.0,4/29/2013,"I ate here with family yesterday at 2 pm. I am absolutely disgusted with how a simple mistake was handled with the food. Besides being slow (nearly 40 minutes to be seated...well over the 10-15 minute quoted wait time) and having to ask five people for silverware, I had the pleasure of our waitress trying to cover up a burger having cheese instead of getting the kitchen to remake me one without cheese. I had ordered a burger without mayo or dressing (the menu lists a hamburger completely separate from cheeseburgers) and when it came, I checked o make sure it had no dressing. To my surprise, I saw globs of yellow in a corner - it looked like morons had stuck cheese on the burger and then pulled it off when they realized it wasn't supposed to have it on there. Absolutely disgusting. I brought it to her attention and she took it back to the kitchen - I figured that I'd get a new burger...yeah, no. Two minutes later, she's back with the burger, claiming it's ""new"" (I know it takes longer than two minutes to cook that...and taking food from other diner's orders to correct a mistake is rather uncool). Nope. She lied. It was the EXACT burger with a corner cut off. How gross. So customers can't get what they order and when mistakes are made, get the mistake poorly covered up instead of new food? To make matters worse, on the other side of the patty, there's tons of cheese bits. I get the actress again and tell her that its the same burger and there's still cheese all over it. I told her I am allergic to cheese and she's arguing with me that it's ""meat juice"" not cheese. Yeah, no...I know what cheese looks like. Finally she takes it back and I eventually get a burger made correctly. Nothing's comped, I'm disgusted by the way the food was handled (touching MY food that I'm supposed to eat to cut a chunk out instead of getting a new meal made????), and I'm annoyed over how rude/lazy/incompetent our server is. I wish I had spoken to a manager, but I didn't want to make a scene and I just wanted to get out of that place.  I don't understand how someone can mess up like that and then argue with me over it. I rarely eat here and now I have more reason to avoid this place."
Melinda A.,"Houston, TX",41,24,12,3.0,7/8/2013,This place to me is just ok.   We mainly go for atmosphere and the husband likes the beer.  I find the menu way too extensive and I always have a hard time figuring out what I want... I prefer the lunch menu. The quality of the food is inconsistent. I once had pork chops that were completely dried out.  I do like the shrimp and chicken lettuce wraps. A nice thing is you can call ahead for seating... this place is always packed.
Vicente A.,"Houma, LA",19,6,5,5.0,7/6/2013,Went here and i got the best BJ ever i was so happy my eyes were popping out of my head..Be sure to get the 10$ special!!
Mike D.,"Houston, TX",0,6,,2.0,5/25/2015,"Good food, poor service. Really sad. Waiter apologized three times for the ""delayed service"" which was just him. Other tables were grumbling as well so maybe it was just his section."
Harold H.,"Houston, TX",26,12,,1.0,1/11/2012,"Lunch time meal was horribly gruesome!!!  Grandson's kids meal: How do you ruin a kids Mac and Cheese? Dry and not edible by a two year who loves Mac and Cheese. Papaw's Meal: Fish taco of questionable fish origin despite what the menu says.. The tacos was more cabbage then the over cooked fish stick in the tortilla. Nana's meal: 1/2 Turkey sandwich was made with hard bread that fell off the sandwich into pieces as she tried to eat it and served with greasy fries.  BJ's used to be our go to place, but after this lunch fare today not anymore. A $37 lunch that was just a waste of money and a waitstaff that must have been trained to ask you every 5 minutes is everything alright. The only reason it got one star review is because we all had a salad that we could at least eat. Otherwise I would have given BJ's zero stars. Yuck!"
Denis C.,"Houston, TX",204,331,221,4.0,1/16/2011,"I used to go the my local BJ's back home in Long Beach,  It's small, comfy and usually never has a wait.  This place here in Houston is huge and almost always has a wait.  So plan your day around when you want to come; but that can be said in general about FM 1960 and the Willowbrook Mall.  I recommend parking on the Whiskey River side of the parking lot, there's usually plenty of spots there if you don't mind walking about 50 yards. Back home, I'd usually stick to just the deep dish pizza, but since moving here, I like exploring the rest of their menu.  Their salads are good; can't go wrong with fish and chips and their teriyaki chicken dish is awesome.  I try to stay away from their chicken sandwiches as they usually disappoint me.  No matter what you do, always leave room for a pizookie! Overall, I enjoy the food and the service staff rock.   I usually drive to the restaurant but leave the driving home to my wife.  The beer is good and their seasonal selections are worth trying.  The Grand Cru is a strong Belgian-style ale that is served in a small glass (10% alc for those thinking about throwing down a few).  The Irish Root Beer and Sangria(s) are also excellent. The only downside is the wait, but that happens everywhere in in Houston starting at 5pm, Friday-Sunday.  So chill out at the bar with a brew. Oh...and about the floor near the bar/restroom.  It's slick like a bowling lane so if you don't want to look like Bambi doin' the splits, be careful."
Nicolle R.,"Houston, TX",0,6,2,5.0,2/21/2014,"Love the beer!! Andres the server was excellent, great beer suggestions. I suggest trying the California Club flatbread it's delicious!!"
Eric W.,"Tomball, TX",0,8,,5.0,5/15/2014,Their deep dish pizza is okay. This place is a little bit overpriced for a slightly upgraded American restaurant. Only eat here if they are having their gift card deal. At least that way you can get something out of it. You know what I change my mind. Their pazookies are delicious and warrant 5 stars.
