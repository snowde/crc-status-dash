Olivia K.,"Houston, TX",405,363,319,3.0,11/6/2012,"For a chain brewhouse restaurant, it's pretty good. It's a typical chain with the menu and food preparation, which explains why you can only find them in the suburbs of Houston. Personally, I'm not a fan of chain restaurants because they lack originality and uniqueness. I met a blind date here, so it wasn't my choice to drive to the suburbs to eat here, but I was pleasantly surprised. I don't think there was anything outstanding about the food, but it was prepared well with no problems. I'm just not a fan of oversized portions of typical American bar/restaurant food. I'm not a beer drinker and it was too early in the day for me to start drinking, so I opted for one of their in-house crafted sodas and it was amazing! For beer lovers, they do keep St. Arnolds on tap in order to keep the locals coming back, but still offer a full bar as well as bottled beers. The decor is dark and warm with a very swag cigar-smoking type feel, minus the actual smoke. I sat at the bar instead of sitting in the main dining area. I always enjoy sitting at the bar as a means of feeling like there is a different ambiance than being seated amongst the overwhelming number of families that use the main dining area. Being childless means that I'm not tolerant of your screaming baby behind me while I'm trying to eat and carry on a conversation. The hand crafted root beer alone was worth returning, but I may pass on having an actual meal and stick with an appetizer or one of the indulgent cookie desserts."
Emma S.,"Houston, TX",8,16,3,3.0,7/30/2014,"I went to meet some friends for dinner and it was suggested we go to BJs. It was a Wednesday night at around 8am and very busy. We waited only a short amount of time, enough to get ourselves a drink at the bar. I was happy to be seated at a booth as the tables looked uncomfortable. Our waiter came over with waters while we looked at the menu. We ordered the calamari as an ap which was pretty good, nothing special. For my entrée I ordered the chicken fried chicken. It was suggested by the waiter as I was in two minds to get that, or the fish n chips. I was somewhat disappointed at the taste. It wasn't bad by any means, but just lacked real flavor. It tasted as thou it had been cooked in old oil and wasn't seasoned enough. The potatoes were good thou. I would say this is a great place if you want a nice dining experience without paying the $$. It is very affordable.  My plate was around $13. It reminded me of cheddars.  Maybe a slightly more upscale version. I would go back but it would not be my first choice."
Daniel L.,"Katy, TX",7,31,1,3.0,11/13/2012,"I like the pizza, their beer was OK, would rather have a St. Arnolds, the atmosphere is nice, But I am not impressed with the staff. We have been a few time and one time they were more interested in getting us out them keeping us there. Another time our waiter disappeared never to be seen again. Now I understand that people need to leave sometimes, but you would think him or the Manager (who was walking around , mind you) could say something. I will probable not go back and eat there, but I would pick up a pie from there to take home. If you have not been there I would say try it for the pizza just don't get made if you are ignored."
Laurie S.,"Tomball, TX",268,129,8,4.0,10/11/2010,"I'm not a huge fan of chain restaurants, but of all chains, I have to say this is one of my favorites.  The selection of beer is awesome, and their menu has tons of options.    I always have a hard time deciding because everything sounds so amazing to me! I took my mom here for Mother's Day, and she has wanted to come back several times since then because of their french dip sandwich.   I hate to say that I've never had their pizza, but it always looks absolutely divine. I just have that inner turmoil of what to order, and the pizza hasn't prevailed yet! Parking can sometimes be a PITA, but never impossible."
Mark M.,"Houston, TX",0,245,1,3.0,5/19/2011,"I rarely eat here, but always enjoy it.  Their draft beer selection is quite good, and their deep-dish pizza is some of the best in the area.  Service has always been prompt.  Not cheap, but food value is good.  Can't speak to the rest of the menu, though it looks good..."
Laura K.,"Houston, TX",13,40,,4.0,9/22/2010,"Let me start by saying I traveled far to get to BJ's... well from inside the loop anyway... all for some gluten free pizza.  Was it worth it??  I'd say so!  Some friends of ours live near BJ's and go often.  On a recent trip they noticed the GF pizza and immediately called me of course. So how was it??  Excellent!  The gluten free pizza is a thin crispy crust that tastes exactly like regular thin crust pizza to me.  I ordered mine Hawaiian style and hubbs opted for sausage and peppers.  Both were perfectly prepared.  GF pizza often has a tendency to not be properly browned but the BJ's pizza did not suffer from that problem.   The price point was excellent and the staff was soo friendly!  In short, we'll certainly be returning but not too soon considering the drive."
Carrie H.,"Houston, TX",22,11,,4.0,8/5/2011,"Went there a couple months ago, it was nice...loved my BIG salad and those avocado egg rolls are to die for.  In my inbox this morning is a promotional for Party for Two.  This sounds like exactly what my hubby and I would enjoy, so we are going back tonight to see if it is 'all that'...and get a margarita or mojito 'cause its payday Friday! Woohoo!! It was a great dinner, will be back for this special deal (and another mojito!).  He had a wedge salad, I had a house salad and we shared the all meat pizza and a peanut butter pizookie.  He went nuts on the pizookie idea and was hard for him to share it...going to have to make this one at home I am told.  It was tasty!  Need to have a kid-free zone though.."
Sara L.,"Houston, TX",6,66,10,5.0,4/25/2013,So far so good. Been here twice and both times have been a great experience. The food is great. The drinks are great. The service has been great. MY favorite was the dessert! Highly recommend the white chocolate pizookie!!!!! It was to dieeeeee for :)
Aliza R.,"Spring, TX",70,14,5,4.0,9/14/2013,Love the pizza here. The Great White is a fave!!! Fun place for a quick bite before a movie or even out with the kids!! And if you have room - a pazookie!!  Their house brewed beer is very good too!!They seem to have some good happy hour deals - can't wait to try those out!
Peter C.,"Chicago, IL",29,132,3,4.0,3/6/2011,"Excellent homemade brew (try the pirana pale ale or the jeremiah red). The avocado egg rolls are amazing. The place seems to be always busy. You can't make reservations, but they let you call a bit in advance (ten or so minutes before you arrive) which helps."
Mathew N.,"Austin, TX",110,63,6,4.0,6/13/2013,"Fairly pleased with what I experienced. Our waitress was very nice and having witnessed her deal with customer complaints she still had a good attitude about it, although she did enjoy sharing her stories with us. I had the pulled pork burger and my friend had a shrimp scampi. In all the food was fairly decent although if I were to nitpick, the sauce was overbearingly sweet as was the dessert which was the white chocolate raspberry cookie with icecream on top. But it's dessert from a chain restaurant so I should've expected so. In all the experience was very entertaining and I would definitely return with company."
Michael O.,"Houston, TX",0,11,1,2.0,1/7/2015,"Went during lunch on a weekday. The service and the food was very slow, and the quality of the food did not make up for it."
Alan P.,"Sugar Land, TX",6,58,1,3.0,6/10/2011,MMMM!! ordered a large buffalo pizza and a fried butterfly shrimp with fries. Shared it with 2 other friends. Buffalo pizza was awesome. Really tasted like hot sauce. Shrimp and fries were good. I like how skinny they make their fries. It's unique and fun to eat.  I give BJ's a B+
Laurie S.,"Houston, TX",15,14,,4.0,8/28/2013,"This place has a great menu and the servers are always on the ball.  My husband loves to go there for the brewed beer and fish and chips.  I love the BBQ salad.  Pretty much always a wait, but worth it."
Edward M.,"Houston, TX",31,88,3,4.0,1/22/2013,1-8-2013 Wife and I went here a couple of times. The burgers are off the chain. We really enjoyed them. I also enjoyed the Shrimp Tacos. The service is great. Pint of Blonde was good and cold. The RR are very clean. Which is a plus. This place is useally busy. Next time I'm going for the Pizza looks good. Nothing bad to say about this place.
Kari M.,"Houston, TX",221,517,724,4.0,9/8/2010,"Went on a Labor Day evening with my entire family. There were 10 of us and they let us make a reservation about 3 hours before hand, which I thought was cool because they usually don't let people make reservations with that short of an advance. The drink menu was ridiculously huge. I didn't drink anything but water, but the first 4 or 5 pages are nothing but drink specials! I ordered the Honey-Chicken Salad and it was yummy! It had fresh egg slices and tomatoes. One of the best salads I've had in a while.  We also had a deep dish pizza with everything on it. I had a bite of a slice. It was pretty delicious.  I had a bite of my husbands bacon burger too....wow. That was not was I was expecting. I was really tasty and served on bread instead of buns. Our server was good on keeping my water full and bantered with us a lot. They even let us bring in homemade pies for my Dad's birthday.  Pretty cool place!"
Mai S.,"Houston, TX",53,236,98,3.0,10/5/2010,"I really like the Pizzookies from here. Get the classic chocolate chunk with vanilla icecream. Tasty. Food-wise. There's a pretty good cut of everything. The portions are big too. I never finish my meal. I like the Roasted Turkey Sandwich and the Gourmet Mac and Cheese is delicious. I love the steak cut fries too. I had the Pot Roast Sandwich before too and it was a little too salty for my taste.  The pastas are ok but the garlic bread is great. The Garlic Parmesan Kettle Style Chips I would pass on. Kinda pricey for some chips in my opinion. The Mini-bruschetta is good though. I've had the potatoes too and they are good but nothing special.  I think most people order the pizza from here. I think it's pretty good. I'm pretty boring so I order the Margherita pizza which is good. I tried the brewed root beer which again is okay. So, I like the margherita pizza, gourmet mac-n-cheese, steak cut fries and washed down with a root beer. Cheers!"
Patrick G.,"Houston, TX",304,6,,5.0,5/23/2011,"Walked in on a lark.  Boy was I glad I did. We were seated immediately, but the place was still well-patronized.  The hostess was friendly and got to us immediately.  Our server was a very friendly chap who had an encyclopedic knowledge of the menu, which was incredibly extensive. My wife had an excellent sex-on-the-beach, which she said was quite strong and delicious. The food was outstanding.  She had the parmesan chicken and I had a personal artichoke and spinach pizza, which was just awesome. Everything came out fast, the server was a true professional, and I just can't wait to go back.  It's a great place that I'd recommend to positively anyone."
Miss B.,"Houston, TX",12,17,4,4.0,5/16/2013,"Stopped in here for a late lunch. I was a little disappointed that the lunch portions were so small. But hey, I guess that's why they are ""lunch portions"" to keep from over stuffing yourself. However, I like to eat so I'm assuming I should have ordered a regular size meal. Anyway, went with my regular BJ's Cobb salad and yes, it was delicious. There wasn't a wait but considering the time I went. Friendly service; that's usually a hit or miss. Always been a fan of BJ's, espiecially the Pearland locaiton."
