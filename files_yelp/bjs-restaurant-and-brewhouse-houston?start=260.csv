Maria S.,"Houston, TX",10,36,5,5.0,5/21/2012,Avocado egg rolls + deep dish pizza. You will not be disappointed. And save room for a pazookie - the original chocolate chip is my favorite!
Sam S.,"Houston, TX",0,9,6,4.0,9/13/2013,"Te atmosphere is open, yet each table feels private enough. The food is delicious, and there are many options. While the lunch menu is reasonably priced, I feel like the other items are a bit too expensive. The drink menu is vast, even for non-alcoholic drinkers. The Facebook page always offers specials and there is a rewards program to get free food. Besides Marsala, I haven't enjoyed any of the waiters though. Food items are forgotten, refills take a long time, the waiters don't appear to be knowledgeable, and the hostesses act snobby. Of the past five times I've been there I haven't felt welcomed."
Laura L.,"Houston, TX",6,33,,4.0,4/10/2012,"BJ's is just a good dependable place to go to in the Willowbrook area.  I have been here many many times and went again today to have a birthday lunch.  Service was superb.  Even though they are always so busy, the servers pay attention to the guests and the food is always what you expect.  And at the end they brought a baby pazookie with a lit candle to the table.  But they did not make fools of themselves by bringing other servers and everyone singing happy birthday.  We sang ourselves, but a whispered version.  Had fun!!!"
Rho A.,"Conroe, TX",27,4,3,4.0,6/9/2013,"My husband and I ate here a few weeks back and it was our second time. We love it the creole jambalaya, Mediterranean pizza, pizooki and strawberry lemonade is always delish. We went to the location in the woodlands, tx and in pearland, tx and both times we were pleased. Even the appetizers are great we recommend the sampler."
Butters B.,"Houston, TX",13,98,317,3.0,7/11/2012,Pretty good--Family friendly. Would like to try the beers. Had a good chicken Thai salad. The avacado egg rolls left something to be desired. Practically tasteless. Would go back to give this place another try.
Richard M.,"Houston, TX",1,32,,3.0,1/2/2010,"If you're looking for a traditional brewpub type experience you're sure to be disappointed with BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse.  This is a chain where the food is just mediocre and the beer ...well the beer obviously is not their first priority.  Houston is the home of Bud, Miller, etc., if you want GOOD home craft brewed beer at a restaurant/pub you'll have to go to Austin or some other city for that. The interior of this place is set up very nice and open with a clean modern look.  They have bar and restaurant seating offering table or booth seats.  I'm not really sure how they get away with calling this place a brewhouse since they don't actually make any beer at this location nor have I ever seen any working brewery equipment.  As far as I know the beer served in their Houston restaurants is still contract brewed at St. Arnolds Brewery.  They really need to change their name to ""BJ's Restaurant"" and just drop the ""Brewhouse"" altogether. I've been here a few times and have had an opportunity to try a few of their beers (or should I say St. Arnold's beers).  They have a list of beers they regularly stock and a few seasonal/specialties on tap.  The beer is not bad but the prices are a bit outrageous, you'll spend the same for one beer as you would for a six pack at home.  I've had the BJ's PM Porter which is pretty good if you  like really dark beer.  Overall BJ's would be better off if they just offered a wide variety of craft beers that people are familiar with... Their menu is all over the place, from salads to fish to pizza to sandwiches/soups to tacos.  The portions are pretty large but the food is only mediocre.  As mentioned by others the avocado egg rolls are good.  Stay away from the fish and chips as I found it to be very tasteless.  I had the fish tacos on their lunch menu recently which was actually pretty decent (the fish is breaded and fried which I don't normally like). They serve a warm 5 inch diameter chocolate chip cookie with a scoop of ice cream (it's not an original but it is tasty). This place would be better if they focused on doing a few things really well instead of trying to serve EVERYTHING with only mediocre success. I'd like to give this place two and a half stars but I'll go ahead and round up..."
Carl M.,"Houston, TX",95,90,13,5.0,8/13/2012,"Good pizza (not anything like Chicago deep dish), but where they excel are in their homemade brews. All the food there is decent though."
Melissa N.,"San Francisco, CA",31,164,1,3.0,6/2/2012,"came for lunch on a monday, it was crowded but not terribly so. the wait for a table for 4 was about 5 minutes. the host mentioned surreptitiously that if i asked the waiter for samples of the different beers, that they had to give them to me.  i tried the jeremiah red; it was a little too bitter for me but not bad.  i ordered the barbacoa tacos off the lunch menu for $5.95. i couldn't believe how cheap they were and that they were off the ""enLIGHTened"" menu boasting healthier choices. but when i received them, i understood why. they were TINY. like, nacho chip sized corn tortillas with a light smathering of barbacoa and a few bits of cabbage up top. it came with black beans and starvation.  i was still hungry after my lunch. i also have trouble believing it's healthier other than the small size because the tortillas were drenched in butter which made the entire dish taste like popcorn.  my friend, whose southern fried chicken and mashed potatoes dish also came off the lunch menu for $5.95, was disappointed too by how small her dish was. The chicken parmesan sandwich for $6.95 with fries is a nice filling portion however, wayyyy too much mayonnaise for them to claim any sort of healthy choice option there.  i like BJs because it has a fun lively atmosphere and the restaurant always looks spic and span clean, but i think the quality of food is mediocre at best. i suppose my expectations are too high; it is just another chain after all.  but maybe my real disappointment came from my table who didn't want to order a pizookie. i'll be back for that---just won't order from the lunch menu or i'll make sure to eat first before eating here..."
Lauren J.,"Houston, TX",66,254,6,4.0,4/27/2009,"This is the meeting place for myself and a friend of mine since it is about halfway between us. I could live on their Avocado Egg Rolls. I also enjoy their deep dish pizza, calzone and grilled chicken pasta. The portions are hefty and make great left overs. We have had a few quirky waiters, but hey.. who isn't a little weird sometimes..? Quasi personal sidenote: My friend left her number for our waiter  (per my kind and slightly forceful request) and went on a date with him. awesome."
Cat R.,"Olton, TX",0,36,15,5.0,5/5/2014,"Really good food, a gluten free menu, and excellent and attentive service.  We'll be back to this location for sure."
Thierry T.,"Houston, TX",143,193,327,4.0,1/9/2012,"The food here is trendy. People come here for American food, but mostly for their brewery. They make their own beers. But one thing I hate, is that the wait is too long on a Friday night. Often times, you have to wait for more than an hour to be seated. The ambiance is hip. they have a huge bar and they have a lot of booths surrounding the bar. Service is often very friendly."
Michelle H.,"Houston, TX",525,662,674,4.0,11/28/2011,Very good. Love their flat bread pizzas. They also have a jambalaya and cajun pasta that's really good too.
Celso N.,"Houston, TX",21,21,24,5.0,6/18/2012,"Excellent place!! The artichoke appetizer is amazing!! Different kinds of beer and pizza, are you kidding me? This is heaven!!! Btw.. Pumpkin spice beer is one of the best beers  I have ever had anywhere!!"
Thomas R.,"Cypress, TX",0,18,,1.0,8/10/2013,"This place was quite busy so I assume the products they serve are decent enough, but I don't think I'll ever actually eat here.  My wife and I tried to eat here this evening, but the hostesses wouldn't let us.  We were told a 25 minute wait for the two of us, and after half an hour my wife checked on the wait and they admitted they forgot about us.  No big deal, they said they'd give us the next table so forgive and forget I say.  Well, 20 minutes later and after seeing many other people get brought to their tables, we had been forgotten about again.  My wife angrily put our buzzer back on the hostess stand and said we were leaving and while we were walking out, we received a very catty, ""thanks and have a nice night"" on the way out.  Absolutely disgusting behavior by the front of the house, they lost two good customers tonight."
Ashish K.,"St Petersburg, FL",5,25,32,5.0,4/17/2012,There bjs brownie is a must try. It's served in the dish it is made.. Heavenly taste.
Clif W.,"Houston, TX",96,23,2,3.0,3/30/2011,"A-Ok perfectly describes how I feel about BJs, and with gas prices where they are right now, I'm sort of glad I don't have a desire to drive down here all the time. Its got a nice, generic restaurant feel and the food is definitely tasty. I agree with reviewer who said they should drop the ""Brewhouse"" from their name since they now contract out. Their beer is definitely enjoyable and decent, but like I said, nothing that is enough of a draw to get me out to BJs on a regular basis."
Muna M.,"Nashville, TN",5,6,,5.0,2/23/2010,"5 stars for a chain restaurant u ask? I can't help it. I just moved to Nashville,TN and we don't have it here... So i miss it! :( I love their deep dish pizzas, the BJ's blonde and their avocado egg rolls. I order the exact same things every single time. Sometimes i go there just for their Avocado Egg Rolls.. They are the best!!  I miss u BJ's!!"
Michi A.,"Houston, TX",18,27,12,4.0,5/28/2009,"Hits -Avocado Eggrolls -Spinach artichoke Dip (although I don't think i've ever come across any I didn't like - so it's not that its just spectacular here, it's just that its yummy any where.)  -Deep Dish Pizzas, BJ's Special and the BBQ Chicken were good.  -Blonde beer, tart and refreshing -Open Late (a big issue out in the burbs. We went on a Sunday and they were open till 11 pm, unheard of!) Diss -Seating is wierd, uncomfortable. Either the booth is way too big or the tables are way to small with all that they bring out. Big plates, and pizza and such.  -LOUD, but hey its a quasi sports bar"
Gloria C.,"Spring, TX",0,32,,3.0,11/14/2012,"We ate at BJ's last weekend for the first time.  I will say it was just a bit above okay.  The appetizer we ordered was pretty good.  I had a burger, I didn't think it was that great just ok.  I did not like the french fries. My daughter ordered Salmon and it was a bit dry again, just ok.  I think there will be a next time for us because we did like the atmosphere.  Next time, I will try the Root Beer and Pizza."
Rudy M.,"Houston, TX",116,159,34,3.0,11/1/2009,"BJs is one of the best values for lunch in the suburbs IMO.  The restaurant has a great lunch menu with a variety of choices.  My favorite is the half sandwich and soup or salad option.  The meal comes with fries!  All that for about $8, you can't beat it.  My only regret is that if you are on work time, you can sample the beers offered.  Boo. Also, boo to the staff or manager who did not take ""tax exempt"" status when we fed our non-profit org's work group there.  WTF?  Most likely will not go there for work options again."
