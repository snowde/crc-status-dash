Lindsay S.,"Rowlett, TX",33,317,32,3.0,3/26/2012,"I just ordered take-out when I was staying nearby. I liked the deep dish pizza, but it didn't settle well. When I went in to pick up the food, the place looked busy, so I have to believe it's a good place to go when you don't know where you want to go."
Stephany C.,"Arlington, VA",26,24,,2.0,1/12/2012,"I have no idea why this place gets so packed. The menu reminds me of Chessecake Factory but the food is no where near as good (and Cheesecake Factory is just above OK in my book). Don't waste your time waiting for a table, because every time you go there will be a wait. We had the stuffed mushrooms (rubbery) and the mini brushetta (I've had better) for apps. BF got the turkey burger, which seemed to me was just a frozen turkey patty from your local Krogers and I had the Angel Hair Toscana (noodles tasted like they were cooked in the same pan as an Asian dish). No need to return."
Apr F.,"Panama City Beach, FL",5,40,5,3.0,4/16/2012,"Great food, great service, but manager sucked!! Our waitress constantly kept asking him to change it to a game... Took more than 5 attempts before he changed it... & to the wrong game, at that.. Terrible. But thank you so much to our waitress, she was great!"
Ronald M.,"Cypress, TX",0,5,15,1.0,2/18/2014,"Where do I start? Let me say first that the food and service has always been very good. Brought my family here last weekend a party of 6 adults and 1 baby, told the hostess what we needed, that 2 adults & baby had not shown up yet they seated us in a large booth. When the rest of the party showed up we had already ordered drinks & appetizers she saw that we needed a high chair and said they are not allowed to have a high chair at the booth, that's fine but instead of reseating us at a open table they said it was spoken for & they were going to make us get up and wait on another table so we went and got the car seat and stayed in booth with car seat stuffed in between us. Now the food...we ordered beers everyone except one were brought their drinks, after 5 minutes we told waiter we were short 1 beer he said he would check after 5 more minutes we reminded him again he then said they were out of the brand ordered. At what point was he going to tell us!!!! Remember the appetizers I mentioned? We ordered a spinach artichoke dip and when it came out we grabbed some chips and were HORRIFIED!! To find an old dried up lemon wedge in the chips!!! Are they putting used chips back in the chip bin???!!! Do not know why at this point we just didn't get up and leave?? We we ordered burgers and steaks and nothing was cooked to ordered!!! Needless to say I WILL NOT!! Be back...WHAT HAPPENED??? Oh yeah they were not that busy when we went. If I knew how to rate them a zero I would!"
Lisa S.,"Katy, TX",0,8,,3.0,4/14/2013,"We eat here at least 4 times a month.  usually good food/service.  very disappointed on last visit.  waiter was very inattentive...had to ask for drinks, to take our order etc...  one of our dishes looked (and tasted) like the salt shaker exploded on it.  I sent it back and asked for a salad thinking it would be quick and I'd be eating most of my meal with my companion.  it took forever to come out and I wound up eating by myself.  we had to even ask for the check and [unbelievably] while the sodium overloaded dish was taken off the bill, we were charged for the salad!  We were floored.  we left a $5 tip and our waiter should be happy he got that."
Ashley B.,"Houston, TX",6,13,,2.0,3/31/2011,"I went here for dinner last night we a couple of friends and it was very...Meh....the avocado eggrolls were really good. They didn't have much flavor by themselves but the sauce that comes with it makes the eggrolls pretty amazing.  Other than that, not much else to report. The beer was pretty good but not great. I tried the Blonde and the Hefewiezen. We were corrected by the waitress that it is pronounced with a 'w' not a 'v'. I hate when people correct you with an incorrect correction.  Anyways, I ordered the BJ's Favorite small pizza. It was loaded with toppings, which I loved! I went in for my second mouthful and was met with under cooked dough. I guess with all the toppings it is difficult to tell that the pizza was finished. I ended up just not eating the middle parts of my slices.  The service was so-so at best. We sat a lot waiting for refills and silverware and other things that we needed.  The price was ok. For 2 meals, 2 beers and half of the appetizer it was a $40 bill before tip. There was pizza left over which was taken for lunch today.  I can say that I won't go out of my way to eat here again but wouldn't not be totally against it if my friends, who live near here, wanted to meet up. The company makes it far more worth it."
Ty D.,"Spring, TX",1,29,13,5.0,2/18/2012,Great beer and food! Can be a wait to get in but worth the wait. Get the beer sampler if undecided on what to try. The palzookie is a must after dinner!
Paul B.,"Spring, TX",0,105,4,4.0,5/13/2010,"I enjoy BJ's period, but this location is better than most.  I've been twice recently and both times I've experienced excellent service.  One of the waiters was named Stephen, and he is absolutely amazing. I particularly enjoy the Jambalaya, but pretty much everything is pretty good.  If you save room for dessert, definitely try the pizookie: fresh cookie topped with ice cream.   If you go on the weekend, expect a wait.  This place is well known. The house beer is average.  I'd go with a national brand, but that's just me. Flat screen tv's all over.  Its a great place to watch sports, and eat some good food."
Stephanie F.,"Spring, TX",11,10,,4.0,6/15/2012,"This place is great. Always busy so sit in the bar area. Tuna appetizer is DELICIOUS. It's open late, and very laid back"
Sarah H.,"Magnolia, TX",69,86,70,5.0,6/29/2011,"One of my new favorite restaurants.  Great atmosphere, huge menu with something for everyone.  Must try: their pizzas, homemade root beer, and the pizookie for dessert!!  Great place to watch sports also, as big screens are prominent."
Crystal C.,"Tomball, TX",11,118,7,3.0,8/5/2011,"A few nights before we went my friends started telling us all about this place, how they make their own root beer and how all the food is fantastic. I had a cream soda and my husband and sister had a root beer. We all ate and thought everything was good, but it wasn't like ""best ever"". I thought it was a little hard to move around, very bar like atmosphere, without the smoking of course. The food is much better than at a bar, but nothing I would go again and again to."
D.M. R.,"Cypress, TX",80,116,4,3.0,1/10/2011,"We came here for a snack one Sunday afternoon. At 2 in the afternoon, we were surprised by a 20 min wait, however, we chose to sit in the bar and there was no wait. They also had happy hour specials since it was football season. $2 off all appetizers suited us just fine. I got some SW eggrolls and my hubby got 2 of the personal sized apps. He liked his little taco's, even though they came out incorrectly prepared. He asked for no tomatoes, they had tomatoes and when the waitress finally noticed, she asked ""if this was ok"" instead of saying she was sorry! Kinda weird. Nevertheless, they tasted good once he picked all the tomatoes out. My egg rolls were decent but not anything like the ones at Chili's, which are awesome."
Alexander T.,"Houston, TX",70,523,207,2.0,7/24/2008,"Although I recently had been to a different BJ's, something about the service here left me wanting more. We had a large party (around 60) and they asked to confine us to several tables, even though we had more people then previously reserved.  Service was very slow, and the happy hour wasn't impressive when you are buying 8 dollar drinks (it is okay for 3.50 drinks @ original prices) but if you want any of their 'specialty' drinks you are paying 7 dollars after tip per drink. I would give them 3 stars, but the service here was atrocious for a thursday night. I saw waitresses walk around with food asking people if they had ordered plate whatever, because she had no idea where to take it, as well as bartenders giving us attitude because we walked to the bar to get drinks since our waiter was being too slow."
Stephanie T.,"Los Angeles, CA",66,95,,5.0,11/24/2010,"I do a lot of theatre in the Willowbrook area and after a show, the cast usually likes to go out and get some grub and drinks. BJ is a favorite of ours becasue not only does the menu seem neverending, but I've never tasted any dish that wasn't absolutely delicious! Oh yeah, and the fact that they brew their own beer which is also delicious!! While I find the food and drink to be a little pricey, I find it to be well worth it. It is tasty and very high quality. The beer is actually a great deal. Any pint of their homebrew is $4.95 which is an average price anyway. I've tried quite a few of their beers and enjoyed every one of them!! Also, the staff is always friendly and accomodating. Especially since we usually have large groups late at night. Thanks for the great food and service BJs!!!"
Mike J.,"Memphis, TN",46,225,,4.0,2/2/2011,"Went with a family unit including 2 year old SWDH. She, of course, was perfect the whole dinner through. As a result of her eating routine we went in at about 5:30 which seemed to be just ahead of the big crowds. We had an excellent booth with plenty of space for SWDH to entertain herself. I am not normally a fan of chains and BJ's is a pretty big chain. This is the first time I have been to one in a long time. First, I was impressed by the beer menu. Not only did they have a good selection of their own beers, but they had a really good selection of other beers, both draft and bottled. To be just a bit persnicketty, I would have liked it if they had an IPA in their beers. We started with a flatbread to share amongst the 6 of us. It was really good and there was plenty to go around. The menu variety was also very good, there were plenty of interesting choices. The pictures in the menu also looked very good. I selected a cuban burger. I ordered it cooked medium and the waiter didn't argue about that. It came cooked very nicely medium. It was very good. The fries were mediocre. Everyone else commented favourably on their food. Our waiter was good. The place was quite busy, but he managed to be on hand just about every time we needed him. He was cheerful but did seem like he was just barely hanging on. I found the price OK, maybe a bit high, but I suppose it didn't help that I ordered the most expensive beer they had on the menu."
Joe R.,"San Marcos, TX",2,19,,4.0,4/25/2011,"I've been to this place 3 or 4 times now and every time I'm back in Houston, I always try and make a trip here. Admittedly, most of the time I order a Piranha Pale Ale, New Orleans Jambalaya, and then split an Oreo Pizookie so I can't say I've had a wide selection of the menu, but it should say that they make a mean jambalaya. Everyone in my group is always satisfied with the food they get. It's a smidge on the pricy side but I don't mind as it's all very tasty. I may re-rate this to 5 stars if I ever decide to order something else and am equally pleased with it."
Sam V.,"Houston, TX",149,375,20,4.0,2/18/2008,"My days of enjoying the microbrew craze ended a long time ago. I think you could even correlate it with the closing of all the Houston microbreweries/bars - but I hope I was not the inciter of the demise of these places. One can only handle so many hops. But this place has staying power just because the menu is so good. American fare that has been cared for - they truly make it worth coming here for. The deep dish pizza is great and the kiddie menu, although simple, is excellent. The pasta dish I had recently here (with chicken alfredo) was bland, but almost everything else I've had here was very good indeed. Even their blonde beer is good (I am SO tired of how every microbrew has to be full of hops and this one is not). Service here has also always been attentive and fast every time I've visited. They also have a long bar with plenty of TV's to view a game, if that's your thing. So it can get loud in here when it fills up."
Andrew G.,"Houston, TX",9,61,49,5.0,3/10/2012,ok i went there on saturday night at 10pm it was slammed but it's ok me and my wife waited 15 minutes at the bar so while we waited we drank a mirtini called strawberries confuzion it was real good  and strong also when we sat down the restaurant was very busy but it did not bother me i oredered the texas fried steak it tasted real good and the side order was very stasty and my wife ordered the deep dish pizza with her own toppings the pizza was hot and tasted very good and during the time we ordered a midori super sour drink and man it is super sour but taste great and strong i love this place this is the very first time i ver ate at this restaurant me and my wife were very happy we went here i strongly would recomment this place to friends and family i would come back again again
Anthony B.,"Houston, TX",59,148,,4.0,6/23/2008,"I like going to BJ's to try a variety of their own brews, which here in Houston I understand are brewed under contract by our very own St. Arnold's. It's nice to see this brewpub successful when so many in Houston have gone under. It seems we like beer here, it just has to be Bud or Coors in tonnage, rather than 'taste'. Their menu stretches across a variety of ethnic items but often with an American twist. Service tends to be good but sometimes struggles when busy. Ordered food comes fairly prompt, and the waiters seem to know when you're babbling instead of ordering, and will take/place a salad or appetizer while you continue to yack and sporadically read the menu. BJ's does suffer from a common fault of too many restaurants - deafening when busy."
titus d.,"Spring, TX",5,28,71,5.0,11/9/2010,"90% of the menu is fantastic! If you're looking for a traditional brewhouse this is not it. Bj's does everything their own way. The deep dish pizzas are great and the pastas are scrumptious.  And,they are opening a new location in the woodlands tx. Try the jerry burst brew. It consists of half Jeremiah red beer and pear cider. Try everything on the menu,EXCEPT the steak,this is not a steakhouse. My  favorite dish at Bj's isTuscan Chicken Limone, and the avacado rolls are a great appetizer."
