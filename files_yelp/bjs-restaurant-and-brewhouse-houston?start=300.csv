Ash D.,"Houston, TX",0,3,,3.0,8/22/2013,"I love the food here, I have had many items off the menu and nothing to complain about. I have sat at the bar the last fee times and have enjoyed the atmosphere as well as the televisions. I have to say that this night is a little different with the red head bartender. She makes it a different experience. She seems to be doing good on the well for the employees but as far as the bar she seems to be blind to. Not very friendly nor is she helpful towards the other bartender. The other bartender has been helpful and made the experience worth the while. Maybe it was a bad night for her but kinda rude and unfriendly for a bartender. As for Jevan (the other bartender) he made up for her poor attitude. For the restaurant it's self I would say its worth a visit. Awesome food and environment."
Lacy S.,"Elgin, OK",0,1,,1.0,8/7/2013,"I usually love BJ'S brewhouse, but we couldn't even get seated.  The hostess was so lazy, she was laying her head on the hostess station.  She told us the floor was closing in five minutes and told us to sit at the bar.  There were at least 3 bar tables that hadn't been cleared. We stood in the bar area for ten minutes and no one even acted like they were going to clear tables.  I get that it is late, but at least you have a job.  The establishment wasn't closing for an hour, but the servers seemed to be kicking people out."
Lacey D.,"Houston, TX",142,76,34,4.0,5/12/2010,"I love a good tomato soup and BJ's is the best mmm sourdough bread bowl.  I'm not much of a beer person so I can't really appreciate this place like some of my friends do but! their mixed drinks are good, pricey, but good. They used to have one on the menu that tasted just like a caramel apple it was really sweet so thats probably why it got the boot, I liked it though!  This last time I had Irish root beer which tasted just like root beer which was great, I loved it.  This place really has a lengthy diverse menu sooo many things to choose no one should have a problem finding something they want."
Andrew M.,"Houston, TX",8,181,,3.0,10/13/2007,"Went here with a couple of my buddies for beer and some food.  There was an alright selection of drafts, your best bets it try one of their own brews (which are brewed in Clear Lake).  This place is supposedly know for its deep dish pizza, so I tried one.  I was not terribly impressed, the dough tasted like something you would get from Pizza Hut and it was lacking in the sauce department.  Overall, it was slightly better than a Domino's pizza.   Good place for a beer, but I could give or take the food."
R V.,"Houston, TX",0,10,,1.0,5/5/2013,"Ate here last night. The server was scatter brained, got our drinks after the appetizer. My glass was filthy, the inside had some greasy film on it. Speaking of greasy....the floor was slippery beyond belief, everyone was walking around like they were on egg shells. Told the server and his reply was ""that's why we wear slip resistant shoes"" 10 minutes later another server slips and falls with a full tray of empty dishes. The floor looked like it had months of grease layers on it. We couldn't eat in peace, the server kept asking if we wanted dessert 5 minutes into getting our pizza. All in all bad experience usually I have great service, food and atmosphere....tonight was not the night."
Janet W.,"Spring, TX",13,12,2,5.0,11/5/2010,"Who said there's no such thing as a free lunch? Along with approximately 90,000 other people in the community, I was invited to sample the menu at new BJ's Restaurant & Brew house, renowned for its microbrewed beers and delectable manly portions. Facebook is abuzz with diners who have already been there. I was invited to accompany a good friend, Annette, and one of her other friends, ""Barb."" After exchanging greetings in the chilly parking lot, we entered BJ's to a warm reception where we were greeted by a very friendly hostess named ""Courtney"" who informed us that our server would be ""Allison."" A charming ""Austin"" appeared instead, which was certainly alright with us, and who good-naturedly went along with the joke, as we called him ""Allison"" for the duration of our meal.  First, Allison (Austin) took the drink orders. Annette ordered an extra dry martini Stoli with extra olives. Talk about a 'call' drink. I didn't know martinis could get that fancy. And blonde Barb ordered a Brewhouse Blonde. (Say that four times fast after drinking an extra dry martini Stoli with extra olives.) There were so many drink choices that I was confused, so Austin (alias Allison) appropriately suggested a Confusion... Hpnotiq, which is a blend of vodka, cognac, and natural exotic fruit juices including a strawberry puree, raspberry Stoli, and a splash of pineapple juice. Now that's a drink! After downing it halfway, I was even more confused, but convinced that I was drinking healthy. It was suggested that we each try something different from the menu, which is always more fun so you can graze from each other's plates. Barb ordered the Sweet Pig Pizza...a deep-dish pizza with ham, pineapple, and roasted tomatoes (ordering the smallest size.) For a pizza crust so thick, it was light as a feather. Incidentally, you can order your pizza gluten-free. Annette ordered the fish and chips. Being kitchen-impaired, I'm assuming the fish was fried in a beer batter as BJ's certainly has enough beer on hand. It wasn't that cornmeal batter like everyone uses in this area of the country. It was a thin, crunchy crust over flaky fish filets. (I'm not a food blogger, but I'm actually beginning to sound like one.) I was glad Annette couldn't eat all the fries, so I could finish them off. Typically I never order fries because they don't have any flavor, but these were thick and delicious. I usually order something I would never be able to prepare, so I ordered the Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo.  You can order this grilled or blackened, and since I can't do either, I asked our server, Austin, to make a recommendation. The people who work in restaurants have usually sampled everything on the menu, so I value their opinion. He recommended the grilled chicken and assured me I would be pleased with it. I know, a lot of restaurants serve this dish, but not like the one I was served. The chicken wasn't in little chunks like you get out of can of chicken. It was slices of breast meat that were so tender, you didn't have to use a knife. I'm not savvy enough to tell you what seasonings were used, but the chicken was seasoned to perfection. And there was so much fettuccine pasta left over, that I had enough for a 'to go' box.    While waiting for our meals we oohed and aahed over other menu selections that were being served up around us. The salads were beautiful, and the burgers were huge! This will definitely be the place salad lovers will frequent for lunch, and the brews and burgers will make this a 'guy's night out' hangout. We opted for a desert instead of an appetizer, and unanimously agreed on the Pizookie. With my limited Italian, loosely translated means...a large cookie prepared like a pizza, thus Pizookie.  It was half cookie with chocolate chunks, and half with white Macadamian chunks, topped with vanilla ice cream.  Rarely eating desserts for lack of a sweet tooth, this dessert was a melt-in-your-mouth reward that really finished the meal off in fine fashion.   In addition to a quality meal, one thing I especially appreciated was the quality control. Andrew, not to be confused with Austin (alias Allison) or is it the other way around. I'm still confused, and I've only had one Confusion.  Andrew, the Quality Control trainer was following up on Austin's service, to ensure the 7 C's were being addressed: Community, Connection, Caring, Consistency, Control, Compassion, and Courage (an integral part of BJ's culture.) We suggested they add Charm and Charisma. With the exception of the alcoholic beverages, the meal was complimentary.  If you please, a voluntary donation to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation is politely suggested, and would benefit a great cause. November  8th  at 11:00 a.m. , is the official opening of BJ's. For more information about BJ's, visit    Now that I'm familiar with the menu, I won't be so confused when I return. I just hope they don't remove the Confusion from the menu."
Brandon J.,"Tomball, TX",0,11,,5.0,12/6/2012,"The food here is phenomenal!  The menu is massive (literally 18 pages), and everything I've ever had there was amazing.  Couple the food with their own brews and decent prices, and you can't beat BJ's!"
M B.,"Houston, TX",0,50,1,2.0,6/17/2012,"Went in on a Fri about 9pm. Had 7 in the party. Called ahead to get on list.  Parking was a real problem. Had to eventually park next door.  Said wait would be 25-30 min, but was only about 5.  We almost left.  Food was good as always but service was awful. Slow, slow, slow, and did not check on us at all. Very disappointed. We have always had a fairly good experience here, but not tonight. And, we had bragged on this place to our group we were with. Waiter also tried to have food passed down the table, by us, as opposed to serving each person as he should.  May go back, but not sure."
Julia S.,"Houston, TX",117,294,355,2.0,11/20/2009,"Food is mediocre at best. Maybe a slight step up to Chili's. I ordered the Field of Greens salad with grilled chicken. Decent salad except for the pecan shells (yup, on verge of breaking my teeth a few times) and the salt overload. Who puts salt on a salad? I ended up not finishing my dish."
Melody F.,"Houston, TX",137,231,130,3.0,11/20/2011,"We arrived just in time! Went on a saturday night with a 4 year old and a 9month old. So the prompt seating was nice! Our waiter was new or not very smart or both. I am gluten free so like bj's for the gf pazookie. I tried their mint chocolate martini after explaining to the server he could substitute the goose for kettle. It has been done. Kettle is a potato vodka not wheat. I sucked that drink down it was fabulous! My husband ordered a delicious chicken rice and zuchinni meal. I ordered a soup and salad. No go on the tortlilla soup it was gross. Being a bartender I dont like dirty glasses and dishes on my table. There was no prebussing. Martini glass and dishes remained on table entire meal. Took a long time for food to come out. My whole family finished their meal before I even had a spoon for my soup. Waiter kept trying to joke about his crummy service. He never refilled our tea glasses, dirty dishes, food not right and kept forgetting to check back!  I joked back and said the gluten free pazokie should make up for all the bad things. It did indeed. We all even the baby fought over the pazookie."
Robyn H.,"Houston, TX",4,80,35,2.0,1/8/2012,"Unfortunately I've had better experiences at other BJ's than the experience at this location. We were seated in a reasonable amount of time and the waitress was attentive (it wasn't the service or restaurant that was the issue), but it was the food that was sub-par for what I am used to from BJ's. First, our salads arrived before the appetizer (minor inconvenience and easily overlooked). For an appetizer we ordered the potato skins. There was barely any cheese on them. I'm used to the nice cheesy cast-iron skillet of potato skins and apparently they've changed them to be more 'fancy'. This means they arrive nicely organized on a white plate with barely cooked bacon and no cheese. The ones with cheese tasted okay, but really the rest I took home so that I can add more cheese and eat them later. My Parmesan chicken was all right (the chicken was cooked nice and tender), but the pork chop my husband ordered was like one of the those fake plastic food items you find in kids play kitchens. It was really thin and came with only 4 small red potato halves. Next time we'll avoid the pork chop. Maybe it was an off-night, but I expected better food."
Shannon G.,"Spring, TX",0,99,2,2.0,11/22/2011,"Food was excellent as always but server was pretty bad. We asked her for things and she didnt return with them. Nor did she act like we asked for anything when she came back. Sorry, but ive been to better ones so ill avoid this one."
C S.,"Houston, TX",13,11,12,1.0,8/19/2011,"I must say that I dine out quite a bit and have never had an experience as the one I had Thursday night while dining here. I came here to have drinks and dinner w/ a friend and while eating at the table I looked down to see a roach crawling on the top of the table near the attached wall. I was absolutely revolted, I couldn't eat any more, I called the hostess who was closest to me for her to see this and she said she would get the manager. Another 3 mins later the waitress came and said the manager was coming, and she was going to see if he was taking something off the bill. After another 4 mins of waiting the manager came over to apologize and said they spray often but sometimes the roaches still come out of the wood. He didn't offer to take care of anything on the bill even though we were clearly revolted. I paid my tab and went somewhere else for dessert. Based on this I don't see me EVER returning and I love bj's."
John M.,"Cypress, TX",1,113,,4.0,3/21/2011,"Agree with the latest reviews, this is a great place for an outstanding micro brew and lunch or dinner. Was there for dinner with some friends the other night and even though it was busy we got a table within 5 minutes. The host was great, telling us about the beers available and getting us settled. The waiter arrived in minutes and took our drink and appetizer order (pot-stickers and bruschetta, both outstanding). I had the BBQ sandwich with onion strings which was delicious and my friends had a spaghetti and specialty salad both of which received great reviews. Definitely a great corner spot for a nice meal"
Jeff S.,"College Station, TX",0,8,1,1.0,8/26/2011,"My wife and I went to BJ's for lunch one Sunday.  I was pretty optimistic and excited due to the fact that it was a brewhouse and it always seemed like there were a crap load of cars in the parking lot.  When we got inside we waited for approx. 20-30 mins. for a table, not a big deal.  Once we were seated it took over 10 mins. for someone to come get our drink order and it seemed like it all went down hill after that.  After the drink order was placed it took another 10 mins. to get our WATERS and somehow the appetizer we ordered with our drinks never made it to our table.  Finally got our meals 45 mins. after sitting down and when I asked the waitress, Ashley I believe, where our appetizer was, she informed me that she forgot to put the order for it in.  She then asked ""Is that ok?""  Well at that point it kinda had to be.  We already had our meals and my pregnant wife finally had something to regulate her blood sugar.   No apology or any other form of compensation was made for this mishap which I prob. could have lived with if the food wasn't just mediocre at best.  Definitely won't be eating there again..."
