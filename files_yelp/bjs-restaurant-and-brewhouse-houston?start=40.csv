KC V.,"The Woodlands, TX",48,24,14,4.0,7/21/2017,I've always found BJ's to be a great place to eat. My family always enjoys eating here. We've always had great customer service and the beer selection is wonderful. I always get the California Club flatbread and it's been amazing every time. The pizookies are a must at BJ's! Chocolate Chip is by far my favorite.
Phillip B.,"Houston, TX",1,3,2,5.0,3/12/2017,Very good pizza and the drinks are great but by the looks of other orders you really can't miss I would recommend to any and everyone.
Bill L.,"Oak Lawn, IL",0,32,,4.0,8/10/2017,"I read other reviews and was surprised over the long wait and bad service comments. I have been to many BJ's in Texas and california. Never had a long wait or bad service. Maybe because we never had a party larger than 6. Sit at the bar or in the bar area and the service is great. Good but not outstanding food. Better than usual fare for a chain, very decent brews of their own along with guest beers. I like the nutty brunette and the stout. They had one of my favorite beers as a guest beer. Rogue dead guy ale. We shared appetizers, avacado egg rolls were delicious and filling. The roasted Brussel sprouts with sriracha sauce are outstanding and healthy. The calamari was a bit over cooked. Salmon tacos exceeded my expectations. Very consistent no matter the location. Good value for the money,"
Deep S.,"Houston, TX",1,52,9,4.0,7/23/2017,"Decent food, a good place for big parties. The menu has variety of food so people can choose what they like instead of being confined to a certain cuisine. Pazookie is a must try dessert, warm chocolate chip cookie with ice cream, we get it every time. The appetizers avacado egg rolls and calamari are really good. My husband likes to get the deep dish pizza, and I like to always go for their featured dish. I'm glad they have new things on the menu every time I go."
Mercedy M.,"Houston, TX",192,79,115,4.0,5/21/2017,I like their salmon dishes and drink menu.  Good variety of food and great service every time!
Abby R.,"Spring, TX",25,47,263,3.0,9/28/2016,"This place is always busy, so if you're coming for dinner, mentally prepare yourself for the wait. Because of the wait times I tend to gravitate towards the bar seating. I've had numerous items from their menu and overall the food is just okay. I haven't had anything blow me away yet.. except of course for their pizookies. If you're brave enough to dive into a chocolate induced diabetic coma order the triple chocolate pizookie. This thing is the bomb. If it weren't for their pizookies I probably would not frequent this place as often."
British C.,"Houston, TX",40,10,5,3.0,7/28/2017,"Our waitress used a tablet to take our orders, but some of the choices on the menu weren't available for selection on the tablet. The food was good, but our waitress forgot to put in the order for our appetizer(fried calamari) as well as an order of fries. We asked her about them once our main meals came, & she said she was sorry for forgetting, & offered a free dessert, but we declined. BJ's is a good restaurant, our waitress, I feel was just having a bad day."
Carmela S.,"New Orleans, LA",822,1039,3471,3.0,8/25/2016,"We took a break from sitting by our friends bedside at the nearby hospital to grab a bite to eat.  We requested a large booth for the three of us and the hostess happily filled our request. Let's be honest, we didn't come for the food, we came for the on tap root beer.  There's something about that on tap root beer that makes life feel ok.  We ordered and waited for our food to arrive. I got the boneless wings with buffalo sauce and bleu cheese and I also ordered the italian market salad.  Our entrees came out and I let the server know that we never received our salads.  She came back with them in a few seconds and I was a bit disappointed because I was then overwhelmed by food.  I dug into the salad and it was limp, soggy and really lackluster at best.  What happened I think is they were made and sat back there with the dressing on them until she brought them out at least 15 minutes after they were made; judging by the sogginess level.  The bonesless wings were just ok but, the bleu cheese dressing was phenomenal.  The wings were only half coated in sauce and really looked like tiny chicken nuggets.  Also, the portion size was at least a pound which I find unnecessary. To me BJ's isn't really a place you plan to go to just like you don't plan to end up at Applebee's but, if you need something quick and it's right there then you go."
Benjamin P.,"Northern Point, Tomball, TX",34,2,,5.0,7/25/2017,Came in after a long day at work. Alyssa was super friendly and knowledgeable about the specials.  Her positive attitude and attentive service made it the best part of my day.  A 10 out of 10. I will ask to be seated in her section on my next visit
Celeste M.,"Houston, TX",143,121,112,2.0,8/31/2016,"I ate here for the first time on Friday night with a friend... We waited a good 7 to 10 mins before someone came to take our drink orders than another 10 or so minutes to place our orders, when the place wasn't even busy.. But i looked over the menu for a while and couldn't find anything to order, I decided i wanted ribs i seen a order of ribs as a appetizer for $10 i asked the waitress how many ribs come with the appetizer she said 5 but i would do better getting a half of rack, so i took her word... My order came out and it was 6 small ribs and a order of hard fries.. So i ended up paying $18 for 6 ribs... My total bill $27.55 for one drink, 6 ribs and fries...Our waitress kept getting lost came to our table maybe 3 times the whole night... I definitely feel like I got ripped off but with that being said I most likely won't be back just not worth it..."
Chris G.,"Houston, TX",0,9,3,2.0,1/31/2017,"What a mess. Made reservations for 15.  Arrived and they had a table for 12.  They said we called and changed the number.  We didn't.  5.95 beers...ugh but BJs is not a good drink place.  Knew that already.    Food usual fair, meh"
Jae S.,"Houston, TX",131,254,575,4.0,3/13/2016,"Pizza night with boyfriend! I love it here! Our wait time was 5 minutes on a Saturday night! Our server Brianna was awesome! She was attentive, nice, and friendly. I really appreciated that she was so patient with us. They have a shareable appetizers, small bites, dips, soup, salad, pizza, burgers, tacos, pasta, special entrees, kids menu, desserts, BJs handcrafted beers, and much more!  We started with his favorite BJs handcrafter root beer. He loves it. Then we got the Spinach & Artichoke Dip. It's super cheesy and creamy. The chips are thin and crispy. It breaks easily when we try to pick up the dip. Then we ordered the small deep pizza (6 pieces). We got BJ's Favorite without the green bell peppers. It's the perfect size for us. Sometimes we order a Medium size if we want to take some home.  I also love their Margherita Fresca Flatbread Pizza. This appetizer I don't like to share. I also tried to make this at home and failed miserably."
Lina D.,"Yucca Valley, CA",1,33,12,1.0,5/23/2017,"Worse experience ever. Ordered wings as an appetizer and my son ordered a hamburger and I asked for an ahi tuna salad ($15). The appetizer came right away and a minute later our food came in also. No time to finish our appetizer. Then my salad, I had 6 very thin slices of ahi tuna and two little scoops of avocado!!!! For $15 is way too expensive!!! I refused to pay so much for a low quality salad.  My son finishes his food and the manager came, it took him too long to come over and fix the problem. Linch hour wasted and no food for me!!!"
Margaret R.,"Houston, TX",23,9,,4.0,7/21/2017,"the food is always lovely . I love the santafe salad . Yesterday had a chicken dish on rice it was great . the only problem I ordered directly from their site but the food was delivered by door dash.  both times the drivers got lost , so our food was cold . Will still get my santa fe salad fix from them.  Hope they will address their relationship with door dash"
Natalie P.,"Houston, TX",1,5,2,1.0,8/21/2017,"I love bjs restaurants since I'm originally from Cali and have been going to them for some time. My boyfriend, daughter and I came one evening after work our waitress was a large African American lady I believe her name was Melissa I could be wrong. She was rude and very dry with us my daughter who is 2 went 15 minutes before getting a refill we watched our waitress go to other tables multiple times before coming back to ours! We noticed all those other tables were nothing but white people. My boyfriend is black I know that sounds weird since she's black herself but my boyfriend said she probably thinks we're ghetto and not going to tip that's why she's acting like that. Not only was customer service horrible my boyfriends burger was salty as ever I took a bite of it and it tasted like I just ate pure salt!!! Gave my boyfriend a headache actually! It was a real let down coming to this location just sad our waitress was horrible my boyfriend and I are amazing tippers normally $20! But we left her $1 instead yes $1! I called management after we left and he said he would speak with her I truly hope he did I would hate for any other family to be treated how we did!"
Tamika J.,"Houston, TX",115,47,43,1.0,3/25/2017,"Only because we have to leave one star. They are at a zero in my opinion. I waited pass the curbside promised time! Then went in b/c of the wait, my order was messed up! So much for giving them another chance after several times of horrible service. This is my first time and last, after at least a year since service was just a nightmare!"
Darlynne S.,"Houston, TX",52,10,10,4.0,3/24/2017,We love this place! The pizzas are always on point! Had Mom's birthday dinner here tonight and received great service. Ask for Rachel!!!!
Danny L.,"Houston, TX",190,524,3973,4.0,4/1/2015,"I'm not sure why this place has such bad reviews. Maybe they are under new management because my last visit here was good compared to the other ratings.  I ordered the half sandwich combo with fries and a salad for $9.80 after tax and tip. For the sandwich, I got the California chicken club which was actually pretty good because of the buttery toasted bread and avocado. My question is, what do they do with the other half of the sandwich??? The fries were plentiful and crispy, and the salad was a nice contrast from the artery clogging fries. Service was friendly and food arrived on a decent time. This place isn't too shabby for a restaurant chain."
Alicia H.,"Houston, TX",78,24,22,5.0,12/22/2016,"Friendly servers, food came out fast and hot. The bar area was really clean and well kept."
Jose A.,"Houston, TX",119,1,,1.0,8/13/2017,This this place was beyond rude I came in with a group of 9 friends and we were treated so rude one of our friends came in from out of town from Mexico he provided he's passport and was denied an alcoholic drink he's well over the legal drinking age he felt so embarrassed our waiter was so rude he rolled he's eyes and said you should have an American ID not this we tried to speak to the manager but was told he wasn't there at the time definitely never coming here again I
