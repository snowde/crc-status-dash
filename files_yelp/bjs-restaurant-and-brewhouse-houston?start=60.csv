Denise C.,"Almeada Heights, TX",246,5,,1.0,1/28/2017,"I've never left an establishment more upset than I did tonight. Our waiter accidentally spilled a container of soy sauce all over myself, my purse, my phone, and my leather jacket. He apologized and brought us towels to mop up the sauce ourselves all over the booth. If it wasn't bad enough I had to soak up the sauce myself from our table and my belongings, it took the manager over 10 minutes to come by. He was very unsympathetic and offered to buy the plate the soy sauce was spilled from then walked away. I was left with my pants soaking wet and feeling irrelevant. With people like the manager Alex running this establishment, I will never return. I understand accidents happen yet a simple apology goes a long way especially when my property was damaged."
Martell H.,"La Puente, CA",79,30,19,4.0,5/25/2017,Pretty good atmosphere our waiter was very patient and there were 10 of us. Food was good and the pizookie at the end just topped it off.
Adolfo A.,"Houston, TX",33,2,,1.0,7/28/2017,"I came here frequently with my fiancée for their burger, steaks, and especially beers (my personal favorite is the Jeremiah Red). Today I decided to make another visit to the restaurant and had my usual medium rare ribeye which was very good. It wasn't until I started eating the mashed potatoes that I all of a sudden projectile vomited the potatoes and only the potatoes onto my plate, I was lucky to be able to conceal it under my napkin for the sake of the customers, however. This may be TMI but the potatoes had a very distinct rotten milk smell when it came out and I did not have any dairy product today either. I brought this to the attention of the waiter (he was still tipped very well for his service, for he was very friendly) who notified the manager who seemed to put the blame on food poisoning from something I had eaten earlier today and didn't have the decency to check on me personally. I did not feel well after and did not have energy to argue for any sort of compensation, rather I choose to never bring my business there again. I always order huge meals and tip VERY generously. Stay away from the potatoes!"
Kenya R.,"Houston, TX",173,142,215,4.0,1/2/2017,"My first time here and it wasn't a bad experience. It was your normal American chain restaurant so it wasn't that spectacular to me. Since I am still new to Houston I've been trying to try places I haven't been before and this was one of them. The menu was very typical so I just kept it simple when ordering. We ordered boneless wings, Brussel sprouts, and has traditional wings as well. Everything was good, but as I stated it wasn't anything too spectacular The server we had was very attentive and she didn't continue harassing us like some of the restaurants do. She met our needs and even provided us with a complimentary dessert. We had a child with us, and sometimes children take a long time to decide what it is that they want, but she was very patient. The restaurant was very clean and the atmosphere was welcoming. There were more families here than I would have expected. I didn't get a chance to order a mix drink, I think I was over drinking from the prior day activities lol, but this will definitely be a place I wouldn't mind going back to for a quick bite to eat."
Demietria J.,"Houston, TX",0,18,,1.0,7/18/2017,"I was here last Friday to celebrate my best friend's birthday. There were 15 of us and we were told the wait would be an hour. An hour came and went but we still had not been seated. My friend asked the hostess what was going on and he informed her that they were waiting on a table to leave who had already been there 4 hours. Clearly making more money was not important because we had watched that table close out their bills a while ago. It took for my best friend to go back up to the hostess counter and complain for us to finally be seated. It took a while to order and the food to come. Once it did the food was not hot, just warm. I was willing to overlook all of this until my boyfriend got hit it he back with a tray by one of the waitresses. It wasn't even the one who was serving us. She asked if he was okay and apologized and left. He had a huge wet spot on his shirt from the tray. I don't understand how she hit him especially when he was leaned forward. No one ever came back by to check on him it make sure he was fine. We were still waiting on our desert at this point. The service we had on a night where we should have been celebrating was horrible. I'm not sure if I'll be back."
Cristhian G.,"Houston, TX",0,15,1,5.0,5/20/2017,I don't know who cooked and prepared the hickory BBQ burger today 5/20/17 at approximately 9:20 but that individual deserves a raise!! It was absolutely PERFECT. The sweet Potato fries and new fresh cut fries were a great addition. I am already Super satisfied and still haven't gotten that Oreo pizookie  (the best dessert known to man kind)
Marlon S.,"Houston, TX",18,33,45,4.0,3/22/2016,Had the deep dish pizza. It was very filling and had great flavor. The staff was great and the service matched.  A nice place for a late night meal and seems like a nice bar to watch a game or a fight.  I would definitely visit again.
Brissa M.,"Houston, TX",0,6,,3.0,9/6/2017,"the best strawberry lemonade ever but the service could of been better. also our appetizers were never brought so we asked to have them off our check, secondly our salads were brought almost at the same time as our entrees."
Mihalis R.,"Wiesbaden, Germany",34,67,144,4.0,4/8/2016,Nice food  service was okay  Nice restaurant ambient  Many different bier  Would go again
Linh H.,"Houston, TX",1,5,143,5.0,2/17/2017,Enjoyed the Cobb salad and pizza.   Waitstaff friendly and checked on us several times
Stephanie C.,"Houston, TX",0,26,,1.0,3/3/2017,"The service is always good here, but MAN the food is blan. The pizza and Pazookies are good but that's it. Don't have the burgers, the ahi tuna salad, spaghetti, or anything else. I've given this place so many chances cause I live close by but sadly, it's always a disappointment. Sorry!"
Kenny H.,"Houston, TX",6,15,,1.0,1/2/2017,Horrible wait for mediocre food? I'll pass. This place doesn't even deserve to be busy as much as it is.
Matt R.,"New Orleans, LA",521,512,289,4.0,10/10/2014,"BJ's is your typical sports bar. A huge menu with a thousand lunch and dinner options, TV's everywhere, lots of beer, and a boisterous crowd. We stop in at this location a lot for business lunches and rarely have a negative experience.  On my last visit, I had Parmesan crusted chicken, steamed broccoli and cheese infused mashed potatoes, all of which hit the spot. The server was great, and very attentive... the only issues we ran into had to do with food prep... my sister is a vegetarian, which she stated at the onset, yet her wedge salad contained bacon bits and had to be sent back, and the sauce she asked to be placed on the side for her sandwich, was not. Minor griping really... not enough to sour our opinion.  BOTTOM LINE: A solid sports bar on 1960. Great place for a beer and some finger foods or a lunch break from the office."
Michael S.,"Spring, TX",58,2,,2.0,2/10/2017,"Very disappointing.   Food warm, not hot, not tasty. Staff looking very unprofessional.   Standards??  Not here...anything goes...including my business."
Hannah F.,"Houston, TX",1,23,5,4.0,2/9/2017,"I came w/ my bff and we had a coupon for a free pizookie!!! shit was tight! good service, good food, great dessert! definitely recommend lemon thyme chicken!!"
Nikhil S.,"Houston, TX",66,11,7,4.0,9/2/2015,"Ambience: lively, Nice place!  Service: Not as crowded as other locations. Not sure during game time.Pretty good service.  Food: Pizzas are amazing! Tried the chicken potstickers; watermelon and feta cheese salad - pretty cool!  Beer: Defn try BJ brewery beers!"
Kevin T.,"Westminster, CO",2,437,12,5.0,1/23/2017,I got a to go order. The staff was helpful and friendly the food was ready when it was supposed to be. the food was very good
Sunnysuraj P.,"Houston, TX",22,7,9,4.0,11/18/2015,"Been here a few more times now and my mind's changed a little bit. I don't wanna be too harsh, but a few points stand out to me: The food isn't always warm. Side dishes such as roasted asparagus and mashed potatoes, and even main dishes such as the chicken or mahi-mahi tend to be room temperature when they arrive. Dishes which are not are usually things like pizza or soups. My asparagus was also not crunchy but really soggy. I'd be okay if it was a rare occurrence but I've come here a few times during dinner and this seems to be rather common. The appetizers are great, and usually more reliably ""fresh"" -- but the main courses tend to be lukewarm at best. Refills on drinks are alright; they're not the speediest but I'm not crunching ice until the end of my meal. I get that this place is busy, though, so I'm not too bothered by that. They do pretty well considering that, but it could definitely be a lot better.  Service is otherwise incredibly friendly. They definitely seem attentive and do well checking up. What I love about this place is the spinach artichoke dip and their famous pizookies. They have a lot of great dishes, the quality of their prep could just use a little work."
Lucy L.,"Houston, TX",0,5,,5.0,2/3/2017,"Lemon-thyme chicken was amazing. It's always nice when you can find something healthy that tastes fantastic. Ask for Stephanie! She's friendly, knowledgeable, and funny!"
Natasha A.,"Magnolia, TX",17,38,8,2.0,11/6/2016,Bought two appetizers and two drinks and walked out paying $60. The drinks were watered completely down and tasted horrible and service was slow. I don't think I will be coming back here again.
