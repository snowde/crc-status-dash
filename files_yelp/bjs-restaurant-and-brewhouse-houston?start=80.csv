Thu D.,"Houston, TX",120,59,66,1.0,9/23/2016,We came in at 9pm and it was not busy. We had 8 people and they told us it was a 45 minute wait. But they kept seating people that came after us. I think it was because we were wearing workout clothes. Horrible customer service.
Ashley Y.,"Houston, TX",103,428,480,3.0,5/21/2014,BJ is always one of my favorite restaurant and I have never been to this location before. I came here on a Saturday for lunch. I found the mahi mahi from the menu and it looked so good. Well. It came with scallop too. The scallop were pretty good still. The mahi mahi is a lit too dry.( Even tho it suppose taste dry but it is too dry)  I did not bother to finish it. I also ordered ahi tuna for appetizer which was not bad.  Overall I still like this restaurant in all the locations I have been so far. I guess next time I will still try not to order sea food there.
Ronal A.,"RICHMOND HILL, NY",63,2,,5.0,6/11/2017,Been coming here for a while now ! Love the service here and the food always comes out tasty! Best place to celebrate a special occasion!
Tana L.,"Nederland, TX",0,70,18,4.0,12/5/2016,Great waitstaff and cheerful atmosphere. Not impressed with the margaritas but the beer selection is impeccable! Had Mediterranean pan pizza and OMG!!! Awesome!!! Also enjoyed the crispy artichokes!
Tele 1.,"Cypress, TX",21,29,7,5.0,6/29/2015,"My family and I loved this place without question!  Our waiter Juan was truly fantastic. He was very friendly attentive and very knowledgable of the menu.  For an appetizer we ordered the avocado egg rolls. I don't like avocados but this was pretty good. It has cream cheese stuffed in there somewhere.  The menu is like a book. So many choices!! Between the three of us we ordered BJ's Classic deep dish pizza, Chicken Alfredo, and wings. I enjoyed everything. We most certainly will return to try much more."
Ryan T.,"Houston, TX",168,224,241,4.0,5/17/2015,"BJ's is the spot where we like to run to for late night bites. My friends and I don't come here to often, but it sure suits our appetite!  The pizza selection and their own root beer is what attracts me here. Oh, and their avocado egg rolls! These are must have items when dining in.  You can't compare their pizza to any other kitchen. They have buffalo chicken, sweet pig, and many more types that make me eat to where I smile with happiness. The food always tastes great. One time, the avocado egg rolls didn't look too presentable and it was probably missing something, but it still tasted delicious.  Sometimes I eat so much I forget about desert. If you have room for desert, definitely add a pazookie into your tab. You will probably regret it later after you leave, but it's so damn delicious!  The service here is okay. I think the night crew is slacking a bit, but at the same time I can see how the size of the crowd here can take up their attention.  I see they have some specials that they put out on their stand up displays. This chain also has discounts and offers via email.  I gave out my recommendations so if you could do the same, that would be great!"
Tony W.,"Houston, TX",434,12,9,5.0,11/6/2016,Food was really good  service  was great our server got triple sat and she still handle her business
Mindy C.,"Houston, TX",5,68,72,3.0,4/1/2016,Pretty standard place. Nothing great but it's decent. Had the veggie flatbread and it was good. Taste as it sounds nothin special. Friend had a regular cheese burger. Again basic cheese burger nothin special. Fries were good though.
Duyen N.,"Katy, TX",0,14,13,1.0,12/13/2015,"Started off pretty well. Came in was seated right away, waiter came right away for drink order. Food came out good, and that's about where it stopped. Waiter explained he was ending his shift and asked if we wanted to be transferred or to close out. So we wanted to be nice and close out. He assured us the 'girl' that would be filling in after him would check in on us. Me and my husband with a pizza and only one glass of soda each. I didn't drink much of mine so, we ended up having to share my drink because no one else came by to check on us!! All the while our waiter who was 'ending his shift' is still walking around talking to the other waiters/waitresses!!! This is the second and last time I am ever getting horrible service from this place! Never ever coming back to this location. A bunch of useless employees who don't want to do their job but want people to tip well. I get that's how you make a living, but you get paid what you are worth. So useless service gets useless pay."
Mel S.,"Riverside, CA",53,74,110,3.0,9/18/2016,"No matter where you are BJ's food is always good and doesn't change. Order the salad, the pizza...doesn't matter it's all the same. Good food, good place. Unless u have a bad waitress."
Jedi S.,"Washington, DC",0,22,6,1.0,9/21/2015,"Terrible food, good drinks, nice ambiance! The food is definitely not fresh and tastes worse than a TV dinner. We were really looking forward to trying this location out, and could not even eat our food despite being hungry - left most of the food on our plates untouched. Steak meat was low quality, mashed potatoes were cardboard powder, veggies were stale and frozen. Chicken wings were ok add were the only thing we could force ourselves to eat. It's a shame they are not doing justice to the customer nor their brand. I will avoid this place for food and would suggest Chilis or Applebee's over them any day!"
Meka A.,"Houston, TX",0,6,,5.0,8/28/2016,"Went with friends on a Saturday afternoon around 4pm. No wait at that time; friendly, attentive waitress. Flatbread nachos were amazing; seared ahi tuna salad pretty good but seemed to be missing something; bloody mary was bland. Must repeat, flatbread nachos were amazing!"
Erni D.,"Houston, TX",113,344,275,4.0,5/14/2016,Solid choice I vw always count on especially if we are not certain of what we want. Great variety and always consistent quality.
Alison C.,"Spring, TX",225,186,2622,5.0,3/26/2013,"The best of the menu is the first three pages: drinks, appetizers, and the deep dish pizza.. They have their own little menu of beer listed from lighter beers to darker and all of the ones I have tried are fantastic! I would recommend the Nutty Brewnette and the Hopstorm IPA ~ Most visits my table starts off with the spring rolls, though I have had (and enjoyed) their calamari, before I move on to my all-time favorite pizza: the BBQ chicken pizza. Flavorful sauce, tomatoes, red onions, and large chucks of pizza on a thick dough with crispy edges. Delicious! You may have to sit through very mediocre service when you come to BJ's, though. In my experience, the server is either overbearing or doesn't know what to do and messes up the order. Not to mention the wait to be seated! Being on 249 and 1960 this location gets a lot of foot traffic, and I think being next to Whiskey River helps BJ's get customers for their menu of pizza, pasta, and potatoes to soak up all of the.. well, whiskey."
Kristen T.,"Houston, TX",157,42,50,4.0,12/29/2015,"This is the first time I've been to BJ's in over 5+ years and it was a nice experience.  I order the potato skins for an appetizer and for my main course, the chicken fried steak. I was very impressed at the potato skins which were fried to a perfect crisp and loaded with cheese and bacon (yum). The chicken fried steak was pretty good. I didn't realize how much food I'd be getting though. It was two fried steaks on top of mashed potatoes and gravy along with steamed vegetables on the side. To finish my meal, I had the cookies & creme ""pizookie"" which is essentially a fresh out of the oven cookie with ice cream on top. It was one of the best cookies I've had in a while and I was impressed by how soft and warm the cookie was.  The service was overall great, our server never let our drinks go empty and always came by to check up on us. I will be returning to this place soon. It was worth the drive to the Willowbrook area."
L C.,"Houston, TX",0,31,,2.0,8/6/2015,"Been going here since it opened.  The original menu had some wonderful food.  Today it is an overpriced Asian restaurant. Tonight we were very disappointed.  BJ's is now an Asian restaurant offering a few American entrees that are poorly done.  In my opinion, their Pizza is great.  Hamburgers are disappointing, and ribs are fair.  Loved pork chops & Cobb Salad...but they are no longer available.   If you want honey glazed, soy & sesame, you will love this place.  Mahi Mahi is available prepared Hawaiian (Japanese) or Asian.  All grilled chicken or fish are Asian only.  If you don't like that, they will gladly fry it for you.  Couldn't find one grilled chicken or fish entree.  They offer two grilled beef entrees, rib eye or sirloin steak.  Also have hamburgers but in my opinion, they are disappointing.   Have two Pork options, ribs or bbq pork sandwich.  It was hard to find something to eat."
Jay B.,"Cypress, TX",1,13,12,5.0,2/21/2016,Every time I come here I am always a happy person. Staff is awesome and engaging. Food is always warm and delicious. And the bartenders know how to do more than just pour a beer. Love the smooth of the mojitos.  recommend this place for sure.
Sonia B.,"Killeen, TX",18,25,31,5.0,12/31/2015,Great food and better service. Their baked ziti is delicious. I went during lunch hour and I didn't have to wait for a table. Our waiter was friendly and attentive. I would definitely eat there again.
Shay R.,"Austin, TX",33,23,72,4.0,8/20/2015,"I've been using this location for years and tonight, I learned why! I had curb side takeout but couldn't find a place to park as the spaces were in use. I called inside and let them know I was at the store and ready to pick up my food. Long story short, three calls and no food, work break is long over and people were waiting to eat....I flip out...and the manager...she does EVERYTHING YOU HOPE THEY WILL. She apologized and empathized, comped the food and delivered it to the car immediately. She brought a beverage since it was hot out and was warm and apologetic about the whole thing."
Temmesce C.,"Houston, TX",141,17,10,3.0,6/14/2016,"I would probably give them 3.5 stars  I do not round up as it gives them something to work towards. I ordered the shrimp tacos (forgot a pic). They were okay. I've had way better and it's hard to come anything of that nature once you have been to Torchys Tacos (shoutout). I had to send my first order since it came out cold. I mean I thought I could drop the shrimp into my water since my ice cubes were melted. I expected my meal to be cold since it took about 30 minutes for it to come out. And no they were not ""packed"" on a Tuesday evening. The bartenders seem to always make up here were the cooks are lacking. Can't go wrong with alcohol. The manager brought out my new meal and the coins seems to have stepped up there game. My shrimp had a lot more seasoning and my slaw was not so dry like in the first plate.  All in all. Don't get a booth, go straight to the bar!"
