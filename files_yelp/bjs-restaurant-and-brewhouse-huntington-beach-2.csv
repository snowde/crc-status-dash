Jaye S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",119,40,11,5.0,10/1/2017,Things were crazy on Main Street tonight but we just needed some food. We ordered the nice enough. We ordered and everything came out correct the best part was that the person who brought us our food had a smile on her face and was ready to help us with whatever we needed. We asked for 2 sides of ranch and she was back in seconds! So of course I had to ask her name thank you Victoria!
Dave Y.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,9,,1.0,1/8/2018,"Terrible food, terrible customer service. Had a problem that could have been easily resolved but the manager Michael didn't want to do his job. I'll support the local pizzerias in HB instead of going here from now on. UPDATE: The General Manager Michele sent a quick response apologizing and offering to make it up to me with a phone number to call. She said she wanted to talk to me personally and I should call at my earliest convenience. I tried calling and quickly found out it was the restaurant number instead of her direct line. Had to listen to an automated system for five minutes and press zero to talk to a real person. Somebody at the restaurant finally answered and said she wasn't working today. What a waste of my time. I tried to give them a chance to make it up to me and they just proved my point. I stand by my 1 star review. I'd give them zero if I could. TERRIBLE customer service. This is how you lose business."
Suzanne G.,"Huntington Beach, CA",25,74,16,2.0,11/9/2017,"The food was fine, the service was good (once someone came to take our order, after about 20 minutes), but the happy hour sign is deceptive. We were sitting in what appeared to be the bar, to the left of a wall separating the bar area from the restaurant area.  Based on the fact that we thought we were in the bar, we ordered from the happy hour selections.  When the bill arrived, there were no happy hour prices.  I asked and learned the hard way that the tables in the bar area that are not high tops aren't considered the bar. Lesson learned."
Erica J.,"Fountain Valley, CA",7,15,,2.0,1/1/2018,"This is not the bj's i usually go to , but i tried this one today because all the breakfast/brunch spots nearby  were crowded. First thing, the tables were dirty after we waited about 5 mins for them to ""clean us a table"" . I had to ask them to clean it up but i just felt they should've checked the tables before seating people. There was orange juice spilled all over the floor in the table next to us. The spoon that they gave me for my soup was filthy with food from the previous customers. I asked for the a new one and the new one they gave me was just as bad. The food was just okay . I was actually disappointed in everything since we first sat down. Our waiter was really nice and attentive though . I forgot his name but it seemed like he was newer. I would probably never come back to this one though."
Paige S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",144,141,69,1.0,1/25/2017,"Worst BJ experience. I've been here several times and had good experiences but last Saturday was horrible. I doubt I'd come here again. If I did it would just to get alcohol or water.  We waited for two hours on only our pizookie and house salad.  Our waiter was acting strange with all three of us, she kept on walking past us without even asking us if we're okay. We wanted to order or get something, we got nothing from her. She would come back every 15-30 minutes which is not okay. Maybe she just had a bad day who knows"
Peter F.,"Lomita, CA",186,126,74,5.0,10/18/2017,"Went here for lunch on a Saturday, with a friend after we came down to Huntington Beach to pick up our bibs for a local running race. As soon as we walked into the door we where greeted properly and asked where we would like to sit. We sat in a booth and settled in. Our sever Natasha came over immediately and asked if we wanted drinks. We asked for a couple waters and looked over the menu. My guest ordered a pizza and I the spaghetti and meatballs, with a side of asparagus. Well when the food came, it was acceptable and filling. Our server came and asked if everything was ok and refilled our water. After we finished we gave our server a thumbs up and both left with full bellies and smiles on our faces. I will definitely come back when I'm in town.  Two thumbs up"
Darien C.,"Los Angeles, CA",3012,223,141,4.0,5/22/2017,"Stopped here for a few drinks today. The place wasn't too crowded and the hostess greeted us right away.  We opted to sit in the bar area(happy hour). Our server must have been a bit busy, the bartender had to come over and get our drink order. We waited maybe 5 more minutes then our waiter, Ryan, came to get our food order. We just wanted something small so we got the pizookie.  Overall this place is good to come to if you're in the area and want to stop by for happy hour or appetizers. The service is ok and the food is great!!"
Steven D.,"Minnetonka, MN",12,218,69,4.0,5/24/2017,"This place is a solid local hangout. Nice and open, attentive service even with s shift change, people seemed to like the food. A nice selection of local taps, but I got excited when my bartender opened the fridge to reveal a Duvel!!! It's hard to give anything less than 4 stars with a Duvel in the fridge. Case closed."
Michael S.,"San Bernardino, CA",5,121,69,4.0,12/11/2017,"Slow to start... but overall good experience. My wife and I arrived early for a group lunch. So, we went to sit in the bar. I grabbed a seat at a high top and she went to the restroom. My wife made it back to the bar, and I still hadn't been greeted by anyone yet. We waited a few more moments... still nothing. We decided to move to the bar top thinking that we can't possibly be ignored THERE because you're sitting directly in front of the bartender. Just our luck... as we sat at the bar... the bartender then proceeded right past us to head out to the high top tables and check on every single table.  I'd say we went a good 15 minutes without so much as a hello. We eventually got a drink order in, and everything seemed to normalize from there. Definitely a poor start though. Once we were sat, our group trickled in in bursts. So, I thank our server, Megan, for her patience. She was very helpful and attentive to our group.. even though we took a long time to get things going; much appreciated. She was also very gracious up front about splitting up checks accordingly. I don't believe there were any errors with orders, either. Great job. The kitchen did a great job of getting everyone's food out at one time. It's always a pain when you're in a large group, and yesterday's staff managed to make it happen. Awesome job!"
Abubaker D.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,6,,5.0,12/17/2017,"Lakeisha, Michael and the servers always welcome me and my friends/family with joy and help with anything we need. Always a good vibe.  Wish all the folks there a happy holiday."
Kristina R.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,7,,1.0,12/17/2017,"So, first let me start by saying that I love going to BJ's and have never eaten anything bad. Tonight was my birthday, and my family and friends took me here to celebrate. We called ahead to make a reservation and dealt with a very rude, and immature girl on the phone who we had to repeat ourselves several times to. When we arrived, we spoke to the hostess who was obviously the same girl who we spoke with previously. She started by acting extremely rude, like we were majorly inconveniencing her simply checking in. She told us that since it was a busy night, our wait would be at least 20/30 min. We asked if we could sit in the bar, and she said fine so proceeded there to find a large enough table for our party. We sat down and let her know she could take our names off her list because we found a table. She again sighed, and gave us a major attitude saying 'thanks'. She then proceeded to come to our table, and very rudely asked us if we checked in?? We looked at each other kind of dumb founded since we literally just checked in with her two minutes prior. She then started knocking stuff over on our table (and not making any effort to pick them up) and threw menus down, sighed and walked away. At this point we were ready to leave, but I asked for a manager instead and explained the situation. He was very kind, and apologetic. Then, as we were sitting there, the hostess who is standing no more than five feet away starts staring me down- literally staring at me with a smirk on her face. She did this repeatedly for a good five to ten minutes before I asked her if she had a problem. She then said 'nope, enjoy' and proceeded to again stare at me in an angry manner. I asked her what her problem was and that I'd like to speak to the manager again and she laughed and said very condescendingly that she couldn't hear me. I asked our waiter for the manager again, which he again apologized for her actions. We didn't see her for most of the rest of our visit Which was pleasant. When our desert arrived, she was back again and stood only a few feet away talking and laughing to another employee VERY loudly about how there were very awful customers who decided to complain about how rude she was, and how she had an attitude problem. She laughed and again continued to point and stare in our direction. I have NEVER experienced a more rude, or inconsiderate 'hostess' in my life! We live less than 5 minutes away, and I will go out of my way to never go back to this location again! I have no idea how someone of this magnitude would even get a job here! Extremely disappointed!"
Wyn Dee S.,"Irvine, CA",1,32,,5.0,12/11/2017,"So we just had a very messed up experience with a grub hub order that I won't go into because what's more important is the manager Micheal turned a very mad family into a very happy family by fixing the problem, beyond call of duty. The food was amazing as usual. Thanks Micheal and Bj's we will be back!!"
Jevonah K.,"Huntington Beach, CA",108,89,150,5.0,10/5/2017,"Good time to go is 3pm on a wednesday. Our server was attentive, available and awesome. She got us our happy hour beers and daily special of a loaded burger with fries and the $3 limited pizookie deal that's going on this week. The food was awesome and no complaints whatsoever. Good deals. Good happy hour 3-7pm and good company."
David F.,"Rialto, CA",1,53,38,5.0,10/21/2017,"I've been to B.J.'S before, but tonight was my first time at this location, incredible! The entire staff was friendly and professional! Kyle and Tory went above and beyond they're call of duty! The customer service was impeccable! I haven't even mentioned the food! I ordered the Brussel sprouts and the double bone-in pork chops...both were delicious and cooked to perfection! I understand Michelle is one of the managers, thank you! I'm definitely coming back to this location and I'm recommending to friends and family!"
Patrick J.,"Orange, CA",0,13,1,1.0,1/3/2018,"Got here at 11:18 to pick up an order I called in an hour ago. Once I got here they said they couldn't complete the order because they ran out of chocolate, I said okay make it peanut butter. It is noe 11:59 and I am still waiting here. 40 minutes for cookies. Absolutely horrible service, empty restaurant too, what are they doing??? Managers name is Tory. Came in 1-3-17 around 11:18pm. Slow Stoner service. Also I asked for the managers name from the blonde girl at pickup, she said Aracely, which was probably a lie? Anyways she should be accountable if she lied about the managers name, who knows what else she will lie about. On top of that they also forgot my soda. Unacceptable!!!"
Kayla F.,"Newark, CA",301,39,41,3.0,9/2/2017,I'm enjoying my salad and pizza with Jessica... but we're seated with so many fruit flies in this one corner.. so disgusting!!!!!!!!! Idk if I'll finish my food
Jarid A.,"Fountain Valley, CA",0,3,,5.0,12/31/2017,"I came in today, and was surprised it was happy hour, sat in a high top table and was greeted right away. The server was Bajj, he interacted and talked with me so much even learned how to spell his name. The food came out and tasted great 6$ for a burger during happy hour great deal for a great burger. I would like to thank Bjs and my server for the great experience during a busy time. Definitely will be back."
Jasson C.,"Orange, CA",9,74,89,2.0,7/30/2017,"Service was great kept up with all the orders and drinks for everyone. Group was of 14, good job. Orders were taken all at the same time but each group of 7 got their food about 15 mins apart. Food was so/so."
Linaa N.,"Riverside, CA",0,8,1,1.0,11/27/2017,We were seated and left there for 15+ mins around 1:00 on a Monday (they weren't even busy by the way) and no one asked us if we needed any drinks or service. We got up and left. Horrible customer service.
David R.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,3,7,1.0,12/27/2017,This BJ's in particular had so much disorder and although the workers were extremely kind they couldn't agree on one server for our table and we had confusion with our pazookis. The food portions were tiny and the food itself was not good. I love  the BJ's in Downey but this one has a tiny menu and our pizza was undercooked and had paper on it! What a disgrace to the BJ's organization right in the heart of Huntington Beach. Horrible food mediocre service and an overall disappointing experience at BJ's.
Adela V.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",120,31,23,5.0,8/29/2017,Omg their deep dish pizza and the wings! uhhhh soooo yummy!!!! The great white pizza and the Mediterranean are my top favorite! I also love the ahi seared salad. It's quite big but if you split it with someone is quite the perfect portion. We sat outside on their patio since the weather was so great. We will be back anytime we are in the area!
john A.,"Fontana, CA",27,14,2,1.0,12/4/2017,"I give this place a 1 star due to the fact I can't rank it lower.  Worst service ever by waitress and manager, well not sure how he became a manager.  My friends pork chop came out in 15 minutes while I sat there for an additional 30 minutes waiting for my ribeye to get to the table.  By then, lost appetite.  Table sat there most of the time with no pre bussing and empty cups of water.  Had to ask manager for refills.  Worst part of it all there were only like 8 tables In the entire restaurant."
David G.,"Plano, TX",67,118,35,4.0,7/17/2017,"I just really like this place. For a chain the food is really good I love the Santa Fe salad with salmon. Unfortunately they got rid of the wedge seasoned french fries why they would do that who knows. But the service was very good and my friend really liked the pizza, and the grilled cheese.   I always have a good experience."
Angela A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,2.0,9/18/2017,"Soooo- im a lyft/uber driver. I end up in Huntington often enough. I like the happy hour that bjs has... Overall I'm giving two stars because I came in during happy hour at 4:22 pm on a Monday. Not busy at ALL.:.. sat in bar tables area... took 12 minutes for anyone to come up to me. I did sample few beers... another 12 minutes and no one... Decided to sit directly at bar because someone was at bar and figured I'd get attention that way. Steve was behind bar and was 1000 times more on it as far as making sure I had what I needed. Asked what I would like, remembered he had served me a week or so ago, what I got and had suggestions for something different to drink which I took and liked...if you're gonna be here see if he's here. He makes sure you have what you need... My two stars are for lack of service during a non busy time of day.  If I had continued to just sit- who knows when someone would come up.  Other servers that were doing tables right near me-nothing....walked by me several times. No comments of someone will be with you. Nada. If I could rate just steve by himself  alone would be 10 stars- even if that's not an option Thanks steve!!!! Sadly steves shift is over -"
Davis P.,"Glendale, CA",5,53,12,2.0,7/8/2017,The food was good no complaints there. The problem was that it took so long to get it! It took them literally 45 minutes to bring us two appetizers and a mini-sized pizza! Not professional at all! It also took them another half hour to bring the table a mini-pizookie. Not to mention ten minutes to get one refill! Disappointed to say the least...
Jenna H.,"Santa Ana, CA",15,21,9,2.0,6/27/2017,"Went here with a group for a friends birthday, we were waited by Jared who started off quite pleasant. As the night went on he paid less and less attention to us. I asked multiple times for water and condiments. We even watching him pass us by with the water pitcher in his hand while catering to other customers.  That wasn't the worst part.. At the end of the night it got worse when we paid our bill. Our bill came out to $54 and I paid with a $100 bill. I was leaving the tip and noticed I was short $20 dollars on my change. I question Jared about the short change and he questioned if I was being honest. Then said he believed me and remembered putting only one $20 bill. He then awkwardly pulled out a wad of cash from his BACK POCKET and handed me the second $20. I was completely thrown off by the whole situation, not sure why the money would be coming out of his back pocket and not the register. Just his reaction and the awkwardness made the whole situation seem shady. I would reconsider Jared as an employee because he definitely misrepresented your business tonight."
Jake S.,"Newport Beach, CA",40,4,,2.0,11/13/2017,"I've always been going to BJ's of Orange as my primary ""night out"" restaurant or craving place of choice. But as this one was closer to me I decided to give this location a try thinking it would be similar.  Honestly I was very disappointed with the service, our server took quite a long time while it was not particularly busy, and the food took a lot longer than normal. When the food did arrive it was put together very lazily (The Hickory Brisket Burger), and somehow had lost its flavor which I regularly crave.  Sorry but I will be going back to BJ's of Orange again and not returning to this location."
Luana F.,"Westminster, CA",573,72,169,3.0,7/20/2017,"I love that there is outdoor seating. I ordered the Ahi Tuna salad it was pretty good for me personally I wish there were less ingredients in the salad I thought there were too many different things, of course I barely read the description on the menu because we were in a rush and hungry. The waiter recommended the jambalaya for my friend. He said it was decently spicy but not overwhelming. My other friend ordered the mahi tacos and really liked them. Don't know how filling they are she only got two of them with some chips.   Our waiter was also very nice."
Leooxi M.,"Orange, CA",209,1,,5.0,10/26/2017,"Let me just start off with saying I had a wonderful waitress last night , she's blonde and has blue crystal eyes. She is soooo sweet!! I forgot her name unfortunately but I do remember Sunny!! Sunny was awesome!! He was waiting on us as well at the same time (because frankly why not have two amazing people helping you?;)) lol!! Hahaha .. that being said... sunny and this waitress need to be shown some love over there!! They're helpful, understanding, sweet, and go the extra mile!! I haven't been to bjs in a while but now I want to go back!"
Dania A.,"Huntington Beach, CA",16,80,35,3.0,9/16/2017,"I'm a fan of this chain and I do love how late they're open but service was pretty slow (on a quiet Thursday afternoon) and while it was friendly, it seemed like there was one server entirely that she looked overwhelmed and disoriented. The food was good, minus the kale superfood salad. Something about it was off; either the dressing or the combination of items, but it didn't bode well with the table. The chicken tortilla soup and baked potato soup were delicious; and the buffalo chicken pizza was perfect. Not a slice remained. We definitely saved room for a pizookie and got the salted caramel one. Nothing left there either. The only complaint was, although we know sitting outside comes with bugs flying around, there was an unbelievably ridiculous amount of flies everywhere. It was like something spilled earlier or I don't know what, and they were congregating and it really made the atmosphere uncomfortable. When we asked if it could be handled or checked, they said nothing could be done."
Pamala M.,"Charlotte, NC",48,24,5,2.0,6/7/2017,Tasteless rib eye.  Came well done first time. Came rare the second time. It was supposed to be medium rare.  Manager did comp our steak.  Cheddar broccoli cheddar soup was gelatinous and also like the steak had no flavor.  The salad was old and flat. The Long Island Ice tea was just okay.  The wait staff was average.  Two stars because it was better than average decaf.
Sydnie H.,"Logan, UT",0,6,,5.0,12/17/2017,"Great food, great drink/beer menu. Service was excellent, our server Anthony (Tony) was very attentive and friendly. The boneless wings were excellent."
Tiffany T.,"Hawthorne, CA",1,66,6,1.0,12/12/2017,"Terrible location. I came here on a Saturday night and sat outside. Our server took forever to come, so a member of my party had to go in and notify them. Luckily, I was not really hungry. I ordered a soup and it came out cold. Although our server was attentive, I do not recommend this BJ's location."
Tina H.,"Janesville, WI",0,9,3,5.0,10/9/2017,"Sooooo Good!  LOVE that you have healthy options!  Amazing pita tacos!  Our server, Anthony T., was knowledgeable and so kind! Totally awesome experience!  Thank you!  Pumpkin beer is WONDERFUL - subtle and refreshing!  Awesome kids menu!!!"
Issam K.,"Temecula, CA",16,50,120,4.0,5/22/2017,"All is well !! pretty noisy, a lot of youngsters , food is good service could be slow when it's busy, beer selection are great happy hours $4 house brew works great for me :)"
Chris B.,"Riverside, CA",113,5,,5.0,8/11/2017,"Our Server Anthony was excellent! We had great conversation, our orders were taken quickly, our drinks were always filled and we left with our stomachs full and smiles on our faces. Thank you Anthony keep up the good work and doing your thing!!! 10/10 experience."
Karen B.,"Huntington Beach, CA",14,6,6,5.0,10/7/2017,Service  beyond compare.  Kyle is one of the best waiters I have had anywhere at any price point.  He made our night!
Melanie P.,"Torrance, Los Angeles, CA",238,159,14,4.0,3/20/2017,My boyfriend and I came here on a Tuesday. They had a great special on half off wine glass/bottle. And.... $3 PAZOOKIES!!!! How did I not know this! Such a great deal. We ordered the usual avocado rolls. Those are my favorite. As many times as I've been to Bj's I've never tried their pizza.... I finally decided to try one. We got the BJ's favorite in a size small for two people. It was so goooooood! The toppings are generous and fresh. We sat at the bar and was well taken care of. I also came across a 10$ off coupon when you spend $35 or more. I want to try their new healthy selections when I come back!
Joel C.,"Los Angeles, CA",504,27,14,5.0,4/29/2017,All I have to say is this Sarah The Beck is the best. She feed us and gave our puppies water and kept out glasses full.. I'm from Downey I ha me a BJ's 2 blocks from my house but this is where I'm coming from now on. And our deep dish pizza was perfect Thank you so much Sarah The Beck.
Justin S.,"Orange, CA",136,7,6,5.0,12/4/2017,"Came on a Monday afternoon rather quiet and slow enjoyed an 805 and their classic cheeseburger. Anthony was my waiter very attentive, knowledgeable, and friendly! Definitely a great environment all the way around."
