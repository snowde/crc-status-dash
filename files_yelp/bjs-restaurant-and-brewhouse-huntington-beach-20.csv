Shannon M.,"Scottsdale, AZ",174,33,21,3.0,10/16/2014,"Pro: great atmosphere/location, lots of menu choices, calories listed on menu,  friendly servers Cons: food is just ok.  Not bad but not anything I want to run back for either"
Stephanie C.,"Buena Park, CA",2,146,26,4.0,5/29/2014,"Boyfriend & I came here in a Wednesday evening around 830. We found seats at the bar right away. Our bartender, Ryan was quite attentive and served us pretty quickly.  We ordered a small BJ's special pizza. When it came out, which didn't take long, our waiter wanted to serve us a slice but accidentally dropped it. He then told us, ""I'll make you guys another one!"" A few mins later, a guy, who seemed to be a supervisor  came by and said ""we're making you a mini on the house."" Wow! I don't think I've received service like this...ever!  Love this spot, will come back!"
Jane G.,"Huntington Beach, CA",89,271,16,5.0,12/6/2015,Same BJ'S food but we got great service from Kayla today!  They also serve breakfast which I didn't know..the menu is limited but the few items they do offer are good!  Breakfast and early brunch is a great time to go before the lunch crowd gets there.
Pete W.,"Huntington Beach, CA",12,28,,2.0,12/1/2015,"I usually give this restaurant a 4 but recent visits have changed my opinion.  They seem to have lost the quality and customer service.  Tonight I was seated by the host, when I opened my knife and fork they were both caked with food.  He brought me a new set and left at which point I waited a full 15 minutes and not one person stopped by the table to ask about drinks or food or anything.  At 20 minutes I got up and told the host that no one had come to the table and that I was leaving.  There are plenty of restaurants in downtown HB so no reason to return to a place that treats customers like that."
Đ T.,"Westminster, CA",25,22,22,5.0,6/10/2015,Best dessert is the pizzookie! I get white chocolate macadamia nuts on one side n chocolate chip on the other for the small pizzookie
Jenn A.,"Costa Mesa, CA",123,18,3,1.0,5/29/2014,"I am honestly shocked that this location has 3 stars because this is hands down the worst service I have ever experienced, and I am one to give the benifit of the doubt but I have been here a good 10 times not always by choice, and out of that I probably had DECENT service one time. I went there the other night and was seated on the patio, 15 minutes went by and no one even came and brought me a menu, so we just got up and left and went to RA sushi. Another time I went there with a friend and at the end of out meal that took forever, we ordered a pazooki hoping that would make up for the awful service.. The waiter brings it out after about 15 minutes of us ordering it and the ice cream is completely melted and like milk on the cookie and he waiter sets it in front of us and with a smug voice mutters 'oh sorry' and leaves it and walks away! Worst pazooki experience ever! I didn't even know that was possible but leave it up to bjs in hb to ruin your experience EVERYTIME!  Any place is a better place then this place, stay away, I'm never going back."
Alicia P.,"Irvine, CA",117,4,1,1.0,6/14/2016,"WORST SERVICE I HAVE EVER RECEIVED. You would think of a slow Tuesday your server wouldn't try avoiding you the entire meal I guess not. Immediately after our orders were taken the server never came back once but preceded to walk past our table twice while my empty glass just sat there and never did he once ask if i wanted a refill. Our food was brought out by another server who I had to ask him for a refill which he said he would tell my waiter. I guess he decided he had no choice but to come back and give us our drinks, to which he proceeded to ask us how the food was. After then he went back to avoiding our table and helping all his other tables but ours. It's kinda of sad we actually had to ask the hostess for to go boxes and to put in our order for free pizooki day. To once again he wasn't the one who brought our dessert to the table. He happily came back with our checks 5 mins later to which he charged us for one of the pizookis when clearly we shouldn't of been charged for one. When my friend tried to explain it to him he simply said its one per table your server should of told you that. Funny thing he was our server and this problem could of been avoided if he actually did his job. He proceeded to talk to his manager and come back to us with an attitude saying the manager said they'll take it off but this is the last time. I like how all of sudden the problem clearly got turned around on us when he wasn't the one doing his job in the first place. This is the absolute worse service I have received not just at BJs but at any dine in service establishment and I will definitely not be returning."
Angelica K.,"Fullerton, CA",35,44,1,2.0,9/8/2015,"Updated review: Thank you Michelle, I am not as upset that they put the wrong sauce on the pizza because I understand that mistakes do happen, especially when it is busy, I just wish the server and manager didn't lie to us when we asked about it. We still love Bj's and will continue going :), just probably not this location"
David F.,"San Pedro, CA",83,23,,5.0,6/10/2015,"The food and drinks are excellent, and the location is perfect for a date or a fun night out with your significant other."
Bridie M.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",64,14,4,5.0,9/20/2015,"My family and I just had lunch at this restaurant downtown HB! I have to admit I wasn't feeling the crowds on a Sunday afternoon but I went and I was pleasantly surprised. We only waited 15 minutes to be seated and we just loved our waiter, Morre:-) Morre was so nice and accommodating and really made our lunch very enjoyable. He is an asset to the team here and made my day! Thanks Morre:-)!"
Christopher C.,"Anaheim, CA",670,38,,4.0,10/22/2015,Great prices.. great happy hour.. located right in the heart of doto hube.. get the wings well done..
Michelle R.,"Riverside, CA",0,3,,1.0,6/1/2016,"If I could give this 0 stars I would. Boyfriend and I went there and we love bj's. They seated us right away. It was not busy, went on a Tuesday night. Well for it being a non busy Tuesday night we had horrible service and got ALL of our food wrong. Ordered water with lemon,no lemon. I let that one go not that big of a deal. Ordered a side salad with dressing on side and salad came with dressing already coated on there. We ordered an appetizer,mozzarella sticks, and never received them. Next we split a deep dish pizza with half buffalo and half meat pizza. My boyfriend ordered with no tomatoes and behold there were tomatoes. Whenever they refilled they left the old glasses on table and didn't bother to pick up. Pizza was not great so I boxed it and gave it away to someone who needed it. Never coming here again. Bad service and food does not taste good. Didn't even want to order dessert because I was afraid they would make that wrong too. I love bj's but this location is the worst I have ever been too"
Jay F.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",130,137,84,3.0,8/26/2015,Food was great sat outside service was lakin  only one server for a packed patio not her fault management sould of stepped in!
Matt E.,"Huntington Beach, CA",189,109,75,4.0,8/25/2014,"My sister and I decided at the last minute to go downtown on a Friday night! Stupid us you say?  Well Bjs had an open table in the bar area during happy hour; sweet!  Our server was very nice and my sister and I split a potato skins appitizer, a BJs favorite Pizza and Pizooke for desert.  All in all, a wonderful evening."
Alexis C.,"Huntington Beach, CA",37,74,116,5.0,6/25/2015,I'm addicted to the crispy brussel sprouts and the cherry chipotle salmon. Oh and the peanut butter s'mores pizookie...... To die for!!!
Drew C.,"Paso Robles, CA",116,11,,1.0,1/10/2016,"Ok I'm NEVER going back to BJS. Overpriced CRAP. I ordered a mini pizza and a small gluten free pizza. $25.65 later and I'm pissed off. The mini is so small I could eat that in 6 bites. It's unreal how Overpriced they are. I will never go back and I'll be sure to let everyone know. $11 for that tiny little pizza is a JOKE!! I never ever complain about restaurants, let alone their pricing but I had to post this to warn others of this overrated and overpriced piece of garbage. Save your money and eat somewhere more worthy of your money."
Mike K.,"Orange County, CA",655,628,662,4.0,9/27/2012,"Service can be a bit slow but they can get some serious traffic from all the people walking up and down main st. Ultimately Bj's is a Bj's to me.  It's a franchised chain, they have strict standards and this place met them in every way."
Mark D.,"Folsom, PA",63,161,17,4.0,5/25/2014,"Ate here twice while in Huntington Beach. Left both times satisfied. On the first visit, we sat outside and had lunch. The pizza was pretty good - it didn't amaze me, but it wasn't bad. The beer was better - I got one of their porters (forget the actual name), and would definitely recommend it. On the second visit, we sat inside to watch some sports and grab some appetizers / desserts. The pizookies were very good, although I'll never know how to actually spell it. Service, on both occasions, was phenomenal. Our servers were very friendly, knowledgeable about the menu, and came by frequently to check on us. Couldn't really ask for anything else there. Overall I'd recommend BJ's. The food is good, if not amazing, the service is great, and the location here on main street can't be beat."
Natalie P.,"Corona, CA",9,26,9,4.0,6/8/2015,"Went in last night for dinner, ordered turkey burgers with fries and chicken pesto pizza. Omg everything was DELICIOUS! so happy we decided to stop there instead of sharkeez for food. :) service was good to average."
lisa a.,"Seal Beach, CA",63,102,1226,2.0,3/4/2014,"Have not been to a BJ's in a long time . Was in the mood for the wonderful pizza ordered a personnel pan 6"""" deep dish came out cold and didn't taste good. To much in rush to return they got 2 stars for the service ! Lunch special included  a side salad with small pizza!!"
