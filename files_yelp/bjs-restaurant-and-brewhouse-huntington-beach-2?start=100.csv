Alejandra F.,"Anaheim, CA",114,37,8,4.0,10/1/2016,"I've been to many Bj's around orange county but this is my favorite by far. The location is wonderful, located in a corner of main street. If you are lucky and get there on a good time, you will get to seat outside. Its usually pretty calm and nice outside unless its a Thursday Friday or Saturday because there is usually people out drinking and they get loud. But I went on a Wednesday night and it was super nice to seat outside. The price is reasonable for the amount and quality you get. Take advantage of happy hours! 4-7 pm Monday through Thursdays. Once you are done eating you can walk around, its safe, and pretty at nights"
Melinda A.,"Henderson, NV",110,40,136,5.0,4/19/2015,"My friends and I were down in HB for today. They came in from Vegas so we hit the beach and stopped by this restaurant on our way out. It has a great atmosphere and the service was on point. They do card everyone for drinks so be sure not to forget wallets like my pal did...whatever, we just ordered an extra one for her and it was all good lol.  My friends had sangria and the ultimate long island while I sipped a strawberry mojito.  For starts, we had the stuffed mushrooms and the avacado eggrolls. O.m.g. they were so freaking bomb. For those wanting to watch calories holy toledo don't get a soup bowl. Freaking 1420 cal for a bowl of brocc n cheese of course because its served in a bread bowl. Lol.  My friends ordered the salmon (around 800 calories I think) and the rack of ribs (oh Gawd who knows the calories lol...he can afford it though). I had the mahi (less than 500 calories). Everyone devoured their meals. Tyson's  ribs were fall off the bone.  My mahi was perfection with a great pineapple fried rice...and Jenni's salmon and couscous was really flavorful. The mushrooms were about 350 calories and the avacado eggrolls...well...who knows. They were worth it haha. We were definitely satisfied walking out of there...no room for dessert in our bellies. ;)"
Morgan H.,"Long Beach, CA",1019,672,1159,3.0,11/18/2014,"You can expect to find the standard tasty BJ's food here. I enjoy the unlimited soup and salad lunch combo for $7. My favorites are the Chicken Tortilla Soup and Caesar Salad. They bring your bowl with most of the ingredients already in it, and then pour in the ""broth"" component of the soup. Squeeze some fresh lime and you're set. I don't really like the personal size pizzas because you don't get as much surface area of cheese and toppings. You're better off sharing a larger pizza. I DO NOT like the service here. I have never had good service because they just aren't attentive. During lunch they take 10-15 minutes to get to your table. Then it takes them another 15 minutes to bring my soup and salad when I think that is something that should be pretty easy. I would come here more often if they were on top of their service."
Cheryl R.,"Huntington Beach, CA",5,43,33,3.0,5/6/2017,Good food with nice beach atmosphere!  We ordered the ribs which were delicious. The brussel sprouts were not fresh and lacked taste.  The asparagus was too salty.  I should have ordered the fries instead of trying to be healthy-difficult to mess up fries.
S M.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,13,,2.0,4/12/2017,"How they have a server on the door who doesn't check in after 1st bite or if you want another (alcoholic) drink, is a mystery! It's not closing time, nor is it crowded in here, so she has no excuse for her terrible lack of service. I guess they can treat us however they want because this is the only place open around here. We will be sure to eat earlier to avoid having to come here again."
Christina B.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,1,,5.0,4/26/2017,"We just had the most amazing experience at the Huntington Beach location on Main Street! Our server, Sara Beck, was the best we have ever had at a BJ's restaurant! We will definitely go back anytime she is working! We have always gone to the one on Beach Blvd. because the service has always been better but if this location can continue to hire the quality of Sara Beck we will have no reason to go all the way to the other locations! Hope she gets a raise, she deserves it! Thank you Sara Beck for such an enjoyable experience!"
Nathan M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,2,,5.0,5/15/2017,"Me and my girlfriend went here on Monday for the great half off pizza deal. The server Sarah Beck was super nice and gave us great service, and although someone dropped our pizza her and the manager Michael was super nice about it and gave us a free pizookie. This time at BJ's has only encouraged me to come back next Monday."
Brett B.,"Huntington Beach, CA",3,13,76,4.0,1/4/2015,"Went here for Sunday brunch during the NFL playoffs.  It was pretty empty, but they had TV's at all angles.  The breakfast pizza was really good (!!) and the drinks were exactly what we expected. If your getting a few drinks the pizza can definitely be split by two people.  it was flatbread style and had a nice flaky crust.  Two thumbs up. Service was friendly and attentive so no complaints there.  Nice bar area lots of TV's.  I'm a fan of this place!  Especially for Saturday or Sunday brunch."
Kenny T.,"Brea, CA",9,9,2,2.0,9/30/2016,Yeah you would think that this place of all places would give you some good service . Because they don't get the brunt of the late night business. Stopped in thinking oh they are not busy and should have some good service but no luck very cold and calculated no sense of humor what so ever so Hb Letting me down unusual
Bailey W.,"Cypress, CA",390,36,36,4.0,8/7/2016,We were seated fast and our server got to us pretty quickly! Food came out quick but I got the ahi tuna salad and it was only supposed to have Wassabi on the side and it was all over the salad so I could eat all of it. Other than that everything was good.
J Nicholas E.,"Yucaipa, CA",65,5,1,2.0,7/7/2016,"First let's start with the walking in. Walking in we would expect someone to be curious and ask for a name and for us to be seated or just possibly wait. Which I am totally fine with as its Downtown HB. But first of all the staff was ignorant and ignored myself and my girlfriend that was with me. This made us feel not valued at all as a customer even though It was around 2:45 and wasn't even that busy. But after this was said they put us in the back of the restaurant next to the smelly bathroom which both waiters and waitresses were walking in and out of without washing their hands! Uhhh disgusting... So I would think the experience wasn't too bad as I have been to other bjs restaurants and had amazing experiences. Nope we ordered a plate of buffalo wings which were not only freezing cold but old like they had been sitting there for a long period of time. I only confronted them after bout 20 minutes of waiting for them To finally stop Talking to each other and reach our table in the back to realize my waiter went on break and didn't tell us or let us know we didn't have another waiter. After this happened we waited another hour and was around 4:15-4:25 when we finally received replacement for wings we ordered. Which by the way they tried to charge us for when they Couldn't even do the first order right? Gimme a break. After an hour and half later around 4:35 the food finally arrived and you could tell was rushed and undercooked on the chicken which my Girlfriend got and the pizza I ordered was way chewy and almost fought in my mouth cause of the dough. Overall bad experience and staff was very inconclusive with helping not just us but other tables as well. Recommend other restaurants but lower the wait time for dishes, higher more staff if your having trouble with work flow and flow of business as well as develop consistency in your kitchen and restaurant."
Susan E.,"Houston, TX",16,1,,5.0,4/30/2017,"Great location right on Main Street in Huntington Beach. Great service Gina the bartender is amazing! Managers are so nice they remember my family when we come in and stop by to say "" hi "" . Busy location during the summer but a must if your in the area. Try the Pizookie's !!!"
Arely R.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",12,24,27,5.0,11/17/2014,Reasonable prices Service was a bit slow but then again it was a busy night!  The deep dish pizza was delicious!!  And their Long Island tea was on point
Brian W.,"Inglewood, CA",0,1,,5.0,4/28/2017,"Sarah Beck was phenomenal. We sat on the patio and she was the only server, yet we never felt ignored and we're completely taken care of."
Annette Ł.,"Stanton, CA",0,21,,2.0,9/17/2016,"We came In at around 10 pm, and the place was maybe half full at the time.  Our server took our drinks order and left. She came back and we were still looking at the menu so we asked for some time. She never showed back up. We all picked and we waved down another waiter who told us he will go get our waiter for us.  She walked by us carrying a tray of drinks and pause to ask us to give her a minute. I'm guessing she went to serve some other table but again she disappear for like 15 minutes. She finally came back and took our order.  By then our water were gone and she didn't refill it. We waved down another waiter carrying a Jul of water and ask him to pour us some.  Food arrive and they gave me the wrong thing. Didn't see her so I flagged down another waiter and told me my correct order. I waited some more for my correct plate to be brought back.  I snack on my friends' fries while waiting and found the fries really salty.  My food was not the best that I knOw BJ can be. I've been to other BJ locations, and the food here is a bit below their standard.   I'm guessing that by this time they were closing because we flagged down our waiter to get dessert but she just came and quickly said she'll get us the check and left. We didn't even say anything. We tried to call her back but either she didn't hear or was ignoring us. We just wanted some ice cream and a  float. So even if the kitchen already shut down, I'm sure ice cream can still be serve. But anyway we dint get to order dessert. The check came and at this point we just didn't want to deal with it anymore. Sending back the check, ordering dessert, getting new checks, waiting for the waitress... so we just paid and left to go eat dessert somewhere else.  the place wasn't packed at all when we came in. maybe our server was going through some issues. Idk. And food was not as good as other BJ places."
Suri P.,"Long Beach, CA",0,15,8,1.0,12/27/2015,"Dude If you want to wait 5 hours for dinner then come here and ask for Natasha. And then she'll  take forever You'll have to wait at least 30 minutes to get water You'll only get one glass of water, and you'll be ignored all night. Fantastic!  Then when you ask for water you'll never get it So try to telepathically ask for what you need. Good luck."
Linda W.,"Westminster, CA",4,63,4,1.0,12/13/2015,Haven't had BJ's in years and decided to come here and give it another try since it's conveniently located on the pier. Coming back reminded me why I haven't been back. Our food came out cold. We ordered the deep dish pizza and expected it to be at least heated.. The wings were okay.  Our server was no where to be found even though we ate an early dinner before rush hour. Disappointed and won't be back..
Brandon M.,"Fullerton, CA",24,153,7,1.0,10/10/2015,"I was close to giving it a 2 star, solely because of the food - but the service is so terrible I had to give it a one star. That is just how bad the service is in my opinion (I have gathered this opinion after eating 3 meals here). Its on Main St, obviously the popular hang out for shopping, dining, drinking, etc. In most cases, I would understand that its going to be a bit crowded. But unfortunately, even during the less crowded times, the service is still terrible. On my most recent visit (and definitely last), we got there at about 10:00 p.m. We were seated immediately as it wasn't crowded at all, but it took the waitress 15 minutes to greet us and get our drinks. It was then another 15 minutes before she returned to take our food order. While everyone in my party (4 of us) were not happy with the service, we relaxed a little since our food order was put in. It ended up taking about 35 minutes for the food to come out. We were honestly just about to get up and leave but we saw a girl bringing the food. The food was pretty good. I personally ordered a burger, and must say it was definitely well prepared. While I wasn't happy waiting over a half hour for it, I am glad it still came out to my liking. The only sucky part with the food was our waitress went MIA so none of us got refills on our drinks. Once we were all done eating, our waitress magically appeared and gave us the bill. We paid and split. Overall, the service is the crappiest I have ever experienced. Its in a fun location that attracts a lot of people. I feel the restaurant should consider that, and work on its customer service technique."
Jennifer F.,"Azusa, CA",193,10,1,1.0,8/30/2016,"This place is ridiculous. Why would you choose a location right by the BEACH and refuse service to people in their bathing suits? I parked in the farthest parking lot from the pier and decided to walk to go eat. I was NOT going to walk back just to get a shirt to wear. Glad I didn't, chose to eat at a small business called ""the 2nd floor"" (which was amazing by the way) instead of this corporate BS. And it's funny how most of the pictures uploaded on here are professional and not by actual customers"
Shannon H.,"San Diego, CA",144,134,193,1.0,9/10/2015,"What a crappy experience. Especially from BJ's! I usually go to the one closer to me, but I was down in HB so I decided to come here with some friends.  First, we came here during the middle of the week. (It was a Wednesday evening, so it wasn't busy). They ran out of lemonade after my first drink, which is fine, but it took 20 minutes waiting for our drinks. We waited an HOUR for our food to get out and when we would ask our waiter where it was at, he would get annoyed and tell us that it would be out in a couple of minutes. (We waited another half hour). After we ask, we didn't see him again until our food came out. Plano refills, no nothing. It took us forever for the guy to pick up our check.  Needless to say, this was a severely annoying dinner. The food was great, but the service was god awful. If the place was packed and really busy, I would understand completely. But this place was dead and the service was slow and rude."
