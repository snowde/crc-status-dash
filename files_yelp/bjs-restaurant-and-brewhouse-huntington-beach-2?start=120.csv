Sb A.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,19,15,1.0,8/26/2016,"I find it so disgusting!!! and disturbing. I found a hair in my pizza!!!! The manager was really appologetic, and said their PIZZA WERENT MADE IN THE RESTAURANT!!!  BJs would just bake them. For the price of the pizza I would expect it to be made in the restaurant not else where, and thats not an excuse to find hair in your food.No more BJs for me ! Go somewhere else where they prepare food fresh, and someone can be accountable for any hair in the food issues!!"
Rachel W.,"Long Beach, CA",2,102,40,3.0,2/19/2016,"First timer tonight at BJ's.  All in all, I was not all that impressed.  Service was ehh.  Waitress forgot about my beer(blue moon), I got my food before I had to remind her about it & when I got it, it was warm....  California Club Flatbread was great , no complaints there.  The peanut butter pizookie was very good.  Giving them 3 stars only for the food."
Jennica R.,"West Hollywood, CA",661,118,2839,4.0,8/11/2014,"Surprised there's so many poor reviews of this BJ's, cuz my experience here was great! And I had come here having barely eaten all day, so my growing hunger really had the potential to turn me into a cranky bitch.  Lucky for the staff, I was completely satisfied with their customer service. Hostess seated us immediately in a comfy booth. Within 5 minutes, our first waiter took our orders and returned promptly with drinks. Even when he took a break and switched off to another waitress, she continued the quick, efficient service. Waitress also gets bonus points for bringing us Ranch dressing and red pepper flakes upon our request and refilling my water without me asking. It's the simple things that please me =)  As expected, the food was Awesome! Had the Spinach stuffed Mushrooms for an appetizer, which was delicious with lemon juice. We got my favorite, the BJ's Favorite Pizza, which is basically a meat-veggie combo of everything. The best part was the perfect crispiness of the pizza crust and dipping it in the ranch dressing. Was so content and full, sadly I didn't have room for their infamous Pizookie. Their Macadamia nut is the Best! If I'm ever in the HB area again, I'd definitely come back to this BJ's."
Marcie K.,"Huntington Beach, CA",1,23,,2.0,11/21/2015,Going downhill unfortunately. Been coming here for years. They must have new chefs. I ordered a medium rare steak with fries and Brussels sprouts tonight and got a well done steak with cold fries and some green slime that was probably once Brussels sprouts. This was not an isolated incident. It's real hit or miss these days here. We come for Sunday brunch all the time but lately it's a real crapshoot as to whether the food is good and they have developed a really bad habit of sending out cold potatoes or fries on your plate.
Jeff V.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,15,1,1.0,11/14/2015,"RIPP OFF ALERT.   Went back to BJ's on main when we got the bill we were double charged for our pizza.  Asked the waitress,  without even looking at the bill she knew what the problem was and corrected the bill in less than 15 seconds.   MAKE SURE AND CHECK YOUR BILL"
Juliana B.,"San Francisco, CA",3,77,76,5.0,1/15/2015,Very good beer and sandwiches.  My dad had clam chowder and claimed it was the best one he has ever had.  I had the avocado burger and it was amazing.  My mother had a chicken sandwich and was happy with her choice.  I guess what I'm saying is that there is something there for every member of the family.
Todd W.,"North Las Vegas, NV",38,5,,3.0,2/22/2017,"FOOD was good, prices HIGHER than average.   Mood was upbeat but MUSIC/SPORTS on TV   TOO   L O U D."
Darin A.,"Santa Ana, CA",64,51,7,1.0,8/21/2016,"So there was this short, tattooed server that served us, idk if she was new or what, but she took our order and she was nowhere to be seen for at least 15 mins, we had empty beer glasses, the water we ordered was not brought. The pizzas(all three) were not cut, we had to flag down another waiter who was working the patio to cut our pizza. I would I understand if it was a busy night, but the restaurant was half empty. She was totally unapologetic, even though we were visibly upset. I love visiting other locations, but this has to be the worst ever. Needless to say we won't be back."
Maricris O.,"Granada Hills, CA",124,77,203,1.0,6/8/2016,This is probably the worst BJ's I have ever been to . Customer service was horrible. Service was sloooow. Fries were cold and gross! Server was just ok. We were not given utensils or napkins. Had to ask the host for utensils and napkins and some condiments like ketchup because our server just wasn't around. It wasn't even busy as it was a Tuesday night ... Will never eat at this location again poor poor service!
Gina C.,"Whittier, CA",0,9,8,1.0,7/22/2016,"One of my favorite restaurants. First time at this location. They will send a text to you once your table is ready, pretty cool. Parking can be a little crazy. You will be ticketed. $1.75 for 2 hours at the meters, not bad. Parking structure is cash only. The meters accept debit.  There is outside dining at the restaurant. One level. Nice bar area. The rest of the seating is limited.  We sat down ready to order. After the order was placed I was browsing through my BJ'S app and found a free appetizer or mini pizookie .  I should have known. I asked the server let's call him ""Austin."" About ordering a appetizer. His reply was he would have to check with the Mgr. about using the coupon, because we ordered a ""special of the day"" after 10 minutes he comes back to offer a refill on my water. I asked if I could order the appetizer. He was waiting for a Mgr. to get approval. 10 more minutes I grab him and he says good news  it was approved. I need to watch you redeem your coupon. What?!  Actually Yelp has the same coupon when you check in. I'm going to use that one. He said I had to use the one on the BJ's app. Finally after a few minutes of going back and forth, he said that's fine AND walked away! No order taken. So we continue to wait. No appetizer, no salad which was ordered 40 minutes earlier. No ""Austin"" . We left see him on the way out and he said our food is soon to be coming out.  We said thank you, but no thank you. Our parking is set to expire. What a waste.  That's too bad restaurant has a prime spot and nice and easy vibe. If your looking for a 2 hour dining Experience."
Brooke Ivy S.,"Newport Beach, CA",0,7,2,2.0,9/7/2015,"The food: excellent -thank you The service: a hot mess The bartender: specifically the one working the evening of  Sunday 9-6-15. A complete and total rude douchebag. He even wears his snappy little haircut sloppy, much like the ""drinks"" he pours. Grow up idiot you are certainly NOT gods gift....  Which brings me to my final point,  The management: (shaking my head) how is it that this place is still open??? Lawsuit city!!!!! Get it together corporate this place should be a goldmine for both you and your ""servers?""............"
Tracy M.,"Yorba Linda, CA",0,16,,1.0,4/2/2016,So sweet of you to offer.  Save it for the health dept. when they come and inspect the bird shit on the floor of the restaurant because the birds just fly in and crap and the feathers waft around. Btw - the kitchen is disgusting too - had to go in there to find out where the chicken was for my salad.   Thought I was going to vomit.   Besides you can't fix stupid when it starts at the corporate level.  Go in and see for yourself sometime.........it will be eye opening.
Lori B.,"Westminster, CA",36,11,1,3.0,7/18/2016,Not all that great. Food was ok & the service was not all that great. Waited nearly 30 mins for a sandwich & the restaurant wasn't all that busy.
Amanda F.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,21,,5.0,7/12/2016,Perfect service at the bar. Friendly bartender and great drinks. Would return if in the area again.
Carissa G.,"Temecula, CA",19,19,5,1.0,6/22/2016,"This is the worst BJs I have ever been to! We went in didn't get water for 15 min and waited for the food for another 30 min. Which came out wrong twice. Service was shitty, the cooks don't know what they're doing it wasn't even that busy I don't know what else to say. I don't recommend this BJs, the IHOP up the street was 10x better, anyways good luck."
Sunday W.,"Sparks, NV",0,8,,4.0,1/26/2017,Me and my son had lunch there on 1-24-17 service was good waiter was very helpful just not a fan of the fried brussel sprouts its an appetizer.
Kirsten B.,"Highland, CA",5,32,9,1.0,6/20/2016,"I usually LOVE BJS, but this location is terrible. The food was mediocre and the service was horrible. It took him 5 minutes just to even greet us and ask for our drink order (and the restaurant wasn't even busy). Maybe it was just our server Tyler whose bad but man I will not be returning to this location, they give BJS a bad name."
Melissa V.,"Newport Beach, CA",229,116,45,4.0,5/6/2016,"I Love this restaurant chain! This location get's extremely busy though, so service is never great. And I've had them reject me from buying alcohol because I looked young even though I had my valid ID? Didn't understand that one at all! But besides that, the food is always soooo delicious! My favorite is the chipotle glazed salmon! MMMMMMM, served with asparagus and quinoa. They have a great selection of beers and wine, I love the Blonde and Oasis the most, but I'm also not a fan of dark beers. And if you have room, top it off with a pizzookie! This location isn't very good for kids, lots of TV's with the game on and the bar can get loud"
Emily S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",300,40,40,4.0,5/4/2016,"This bjs is really hit or miss on service. Because of the location, downtown Huntington, it's prone to having long waits. I like to visit at off times, either late on weeknights, and mostly just try to avoid weekends all together. Our server tonight, Kevin was very attentive and pleasant. It's a normal bjs: clean, good food, all around a nice place to visit."
Toya M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,19,3,1.0,2/28/2016,"If I could give 0 stars I would. WHY bj's... As much as I love you... Every state that I take a trip to I make a visit to bj's.. So why in my own state do I have to receive the worst service ever? First of all the wait time is out of this world, I should of known a empty Bj's on a Sunday?? I waited 1 hour and 20 mins on a small pizza Cesar salad and order of wings... Food comes and guess what ? They send me the wrong pizza, told The server that I didn't wanna send it back because it would take forever . After she swore up and down that I ordered that pizza . I even pointed to the pizza when she took are Order ..same pizza I order all the millions Of other times I visit BJS And the pizza wasn't even warm let alone hot! No refills on our sodas and it was 3 of us.. She never even asked.. And what's so bad is this location is Meter parking with the slowest service.. Never again and I do mean NEVER.. Didn't ask us did if we wanted desert or anything.. 80 dollars of pure trash!! So many nice BJS I passed to come and experience this one.. Boy did I make a bad choice. And I was over charged ! No way a small pizza with 2 toppings should come up to 17.95 ! She charged me for the wrong pizza she brought out. Just said forget it paid and left.. On my way out two other customers were at the counter waiting on the manager to complain about the horrible service. Terrible just terrible !"
