Jenny F.,"Alhambra, CA",1,18,3,1.0,5/21/2016,"The worst service I have ever had at any BJs. We were a party of 8. When we walked in because we are BROWN, they spoke to us in SPANISH! Racist and stereotypical. Then, the pathetic server acknowledged everybody but my daughter and I. We had to ASK for a kids menu. I had to ask the bartender for water and he has the nerve to tell me to wait after I had already been waiting about 10 minutes. The waiter didn't bring my water until asker again. He never even took my order!"
Abe B.,"Anaheim, CA",47,8,,5.0,7/17/2016,I dined here last night and I really like the way I was treated. There was an issue with my order and it was delayed in coming out. Mgmt realized this and gave us free items without us asking for it. The waiter was extremely nice and apologetic. Usually things run smoothly but once in a while there is an issue and this place sure knows how to make things right! :)
Ashley D.,"Huntington Beach, CA",99,49,21,2.0,5/17/2016,Terrible food and terrible service. Came here at 4:45 on Tuesday. Granted it's Street fair Tuesday but they weren't that busy. The hostess rushed by and rudely said I'll be with you in a few minutes I have other tables inside. Ok cool. Sit down and wait about 20 minutes to order. We order an appetizer it comes out way late. It was a quest dip and the top layer was cold so the cheese hardened. The chips were cold. So we sent it back. It came back 10 minutes later warm. Not hot  but somewhat warm. Pizza comes it's okay. But luckily I've been to the other locations so I know they actually have bomb food here. I think it's just this location and poor staffing. Waiter was not attentive at all either. Hopefully it gets better!
Thomas F.,"Huntington Beach, CA",85,52,12,4.0,2/24/2016,"Good food. Conveniently located on Main Street in Huntington Beach. Parking can get tight during summer. Big televisions to watch sports but they don't play sound. Wide menu. Friendly and responsive staff. The Mahi Mahi, Salmon, potato skins,pizza,spaghetti  and jumbalaya are delicious."
Laura L.,"Anaheim, CA",2,12,51,1.0,4/9/2014,"My fiancé and I work too much and we finally had a day off to ourselves. We wanted to walk the pier, but instead my taste buds wanted some pizookie. We parked and walked in. No one was there to seat us, we had to find a server to ask them where could we sit. She rudely told us there was open seats at the bar.  We didn't want to sit at the bar, so we asked her one more time if it was ok to sit outside. So finally we sit down and she walks over to us and gives us the menu. We start looking for some drinks. She comes back and asks us what we wanted, we let her know what we wanted and she rudely corrects my fiancé. And thought we could laugh about it, but no. She was very rude and she didn't even crack a smile.  So she brings us our drinks and as soon as we get them my fiancé notices a hair on the lime of my drink (gross!). The waiter, that had brought us our appetizers, was very nice and kind to take the lemon and replace it. We didn't really want to be there any longer because she was very rude to us the moment we had stepped in. The waiters that brought our food out were very nice. Overall I would still go to bj's, just not this one. She ruined our whole experience there with her rudeness. Maybe she wasn't having a good day or she was tired, which we could understand. We tried to make her smile and nothing.  I love bj's but I don't think I would be returning to this one because of her, I didn't get her name but she had orange hair with pale skin and freckles. But the waiters were really nice and kind to help us out and smile while helping us out."
Troy W.,"West Jordan, UT",0,1,,5.0,7/6/2016,"They have the best low calorie meals hands down.  I have had the salmon with the cherry sauce and the BBQ chicken and loved them both. My friend recommends the pizzas. If you are looking for a burger go somewhere else, but everything else is awesome."
Ris S.,"Costa Mesa, CA",10,17,2,1.0,4/12/2016,"The food is good, but the service is terrible. You won't recieve half of the things that you order and it takes forever to recieve whatever you do get. I really love BJs food, but this location has horrible service."
Karina R.,"Long Beach, CA",0,32,,3.0,4/19/2016,"We went in on a weekend and sat at the bar to watch a game... The bartender/server was so busy making drinks that the service was a bit compromised (refills, dirty plates, napkins) I understand it's not the servers fault that they get slammed with drink orders for the restaurant and still have to serve the people at the bar.... The food was good, it took a bit long. I wasn't unhappy with the place, I just thought maybe we could've had a better experience, mostly with the service but oh well."
Bri Q.,"Mission Viejo, CA",12,58,8,5.0,6/11/2015,"First time at this location, and its super small inside, so expect to be on the wait list. Me and my friend came here about 10:30 at night, just to get some dessert! We got sat down right away, and our waitress, ashley L was super nice, although it was difficult to flag her down sometimes, but i understand. Just have to have some patients. So we just had some time to catch up, and she came back to check up on us plenty of times! She seemed kind of rushed, but also looked like she had the most tables.  $10 tip was worth it. I do suggest Ashley as your waitress!"
My N.,"Westminster, CA",264,16,8,1.0,4/28/2016,"Coming here was very depressing due to the racism I experienced this Thursday night. As me and my friend, both women of color, walked in we were told that we should try the self seating section instead of being seating in the regular section with the booths. We sat down for 15 mins and was never approached by any servers and the bartender made eye contacted with us twice and never said a word. We decided to leave after this and while walking out, four Caucasian women were seated at a booth and served right away as they sat down."
Forget I.,"Cypress, CA",0,4,1,1.0,10/30/2015,Only gave them one star because zero wasn't an option. I arrived with the family around 3 on a Friday afternoon when the place was pretty much empty. I first got attitude for no reason from the person sitting us. I decided it's probably a bad day for her so I let it slide and stayed. I waited 15 minutes to be asked what I want to drink. Then was served about 30 mins later and was forgotten about.  Now I'm waiting for him to take the bill... It's been 15 minutes while there I had 3 different servers. This was a horrible experience.
Dave B.,"La Mirada, CA",0,200,88,1.0,10/5/2016,"Sooo DISAPPOINTING... waste of money !!!@ This location is way smaller than most, so menu is limited not the same as the bigger locations...with that being said .. one order was gluten free and they said there was an error in the kitchen and had to start over ..well they brought out other meals which were  stone cold by the time they corrected the gluten free flatbread stating only 5 min ...so we all waited to eat ..fish tacos were cold, deep dish pizza was horrible cheese not even melted thru... it was a horrible dinner spent with friends at the beach...  we all went to dinner together and was unable to share a good meal . Bad service, bad quality control... why should we all pay for your mistake !! Very disappointed for a Bjs ,  a manager should of handled this situation so 1 guests eats hot meal while 3 try to choke down our meal at full price .   Step up make an effort to satisfy your guests especially when mistakes on your end. People work hard for their money ....."
Ruba B.,"Huntington Beach, CA",1,6,1,1.0,3/27/2015,"OMG this restaurant is a hot mess . They changed their menu , not enough varieties. The manger kept on apologizing over 4 different plates we ordered oh sorry "" we r out"" what kind of restaurant runs out of  food ? Huh what a joke.  Leave this aside , the service was a disaster !!!"
Diesel A.,"Huntington Beach, CA",5,20,27,5.0,7/20/2015,"A review from my daughter: BJ's is the BOMB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! if I could write a 10 star review I would do it in a heart beat. There Ribs, Rootbeer, Mozzarella sticks, Pizza, and the best part there pizookies with the vanilla icecream are sooooooooooooooooo good!!!!"
Bri L.,"Seal Beach, CA",8,35,5,5.0,3/13/2016,"Came in for a late night pizooki and coffee. So glad we did! Our server was fantastic and even comped us a monkey bread. Even thought it was a short stop on our date, the staff definitely made it a memorable one. Thanks!"
Sherry D.,"Los Angeles, CA",44,36,82,4.0,3/26/2016,"Good food just like all the others. But this one is open late. One of the only restaurants open after all the others have closed. So if you get into town late, you can still grab something to eat."
Sara J.,"Minneapolis, MN",36,207,61,3.0,3/16/2014,"There are no BJ's near where I live so I wasn't aware it was a chain when we decided to dine there. While i would not have went had I known, the experience was good and the food was on par with what you would expect.  We were seated outside and had great service. The menu is huge and includes a large variety of options. The food was pretty average but acceptable.  If you have a picky group this might be a good option since there are lots of choices, it also seems like it would be a good place for a group or kids.  While my experience was not negative I am giving it a 3/5 star because it is only average food. If you typically like casual American chains you will probably enjoy this as well."
Bethany P.,"Los Angeles, CA",147,56,58,5.0,2/29/2016,Love the location it's perfect for people watching if you sit outside! Service can be busy on weekends but it's worth the wait!
Jenny D.,"Las Vegas, NV",881,393,2599,2.0,9/19/2013,"We've made it to Huntington Beach and we need to EAT!! There's tons of places all around... many of them are packed and noisy with football games!  Decided on BJ's just because it didn't look too packed and there was still outside seating on the patio.  We started with a beer and their signature Bloody Mary. I wans't to impressed with this. Maybe it was the Absolute Peppar or maybe it was the Bloody Mary mix. IDK. But I wasn't a fan.  For starters we ordered the Ahi Poke and the Mini Bruschetta. And for our lunch we ordered the breakfast sandwich and the Fish tacos. Our starters came out before our main course and then about thirty seconds after the appetizers came out, our lunch came out. Bad timing on the kitchen's end but it happens.  Anyway, the Ahi Poke needed... flavor. I DUMPED salt on it. It helped, but obviously it's BJ's so how good could the Ahi Poke REALLY be?! I also didn't care for the mini bruschetta either - the little bread it came on was too thick so it was hard to bite and then the toppings fell off.  I guess the breakfast sandwich was fine - it's kind of difficult to mess THAT up... and my fish tacos were just aiight. Not too much flavor.. However I did REALLY like the salsa that came with and the avocado cream sauce! Nom nom! That was THE best part for me.  Oh and then I did end up ordering a Watermelon Mojito that was SUPER delicious too!"
Kat H.,"San Diego, CA",54,266,785,2.0,3/26/2015,"Usually have a great time at BJs locations, but this location was a little disappointing. We were a party of 7 looking for a small meal before a big BBQ feast later at night so two of us shared the deep dish lasagna, I got a root beer for myself, and the rest of the table shared a medium deep dish pizza.  After we ordered, our server left all the menus at the table all cluttered until about 15 minutes later when I asked for a second or third refill on my root beer. For my root beer refills, server seemed a little annoyed (head down, didn't say a word when he took the mug to refill nor when he brought it back) which made me feel a little awkward thinking I had done something wrong for asking for refills.  Also, I am aware the deep dish lasagna and deep dish pizza both take longer to bake because of their...deepness, but the wait was ridiculous. It was at least 30 or 40 minutes later before we got our two food items. The restaurant wasn't crowded either. If it is supposed to take that long, a reminder from the server when we ordered these items would have been fine, but we didn't get one. No ""sorry for the wait"" afterwards either. Food finally came and I have always loved the deep dish lasagna at BJs so that came out perfect as always. Deep dish pizza also got good feedback and the group wished they had ordered a larger one. Deep dish at BJs isn't really deep dish though, probably half the height of a regular deep dish pizza with an overly large crust but our buddies didn't complain so oh well. The five who shared the deep dish pizza felt a little awkward at the end when they paid enough cash to cover the bill and a 20%+ tip, but weren't given the change back.   For the experience we got, we would definitely not have tipped that much. I rarely mention bad service unless it's really bad and this was one those really bad times. Hopefully the server just had a bad day, but probably won't visit this location again."
