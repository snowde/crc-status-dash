Brooke V.,"Morongo Valley, CA",0,8,3,1.0,4/28/2016,"Tried ""call ahead"" seating to avoid the wait, when we got there they didn't have record of it, so I had to pull up my recent calls and prove I called them at the correct number and show how long we talked before he agreed to put me on the call ahead list, for a mistake on their end. Still had to wait 30 minutes. Our appetizers took 45 minutes and came out at the same time as our food. We also asked that our daughters food (kids pizza) come out with the appetizers and hers ended up coming out last way after our pizza. Absolutely the worst service we have ever had at a BJ's.  But we did get an ""oh, sorry"" from the manager on the way out. Unacceptable!"
Nguyen A.,"Huntington Beach, CA",1,108,93,3.0,5/23/2015,"Happy hours drink taste great. The BJ mojito worth the money . I ordered a second drink but it was past 7pm so they wouldn't honor the happy hours price; which is fair but I was hoping they would, bc they prolly will make money selling the drink rather not selling one at all .  Pizza - bJ special taste normal nothing special . I always stick to the basic and ordered their special pizza."
Robert B.,"Huntington Beach, CA",119,288,394,5.0,2/27/2015,"Had a great experience here tonight!  Best yet.  The flatbread pizza was very good.  The server Ashely was exceptional.  She made the visit memorable and really good.  We dine out often, this server definitely made our experience a wow!   Reminds me that eating out is more about the hospitality than just the food.  A smart manager hired this young lady!   Great experience!"
Zach L.,"Placentia, CA",0,7,,1.0,4/1/2016,"First off, it took over an hour and a half to get a booth. But its a friday night around dinner time. Brandon C was our waiter for the night. He started off by being extremely rude because we didnt want to drink but just to grab some dinner and celebrate someone who passed away a year ago. He took over 20 minutes to brink us waters and tea. Then took another 20 minutes to take our orders. And never checked on us again. We needed refills and some napkins. Then another waiter dropped off the bill before we were even given the option for dessert. Horrible service equals no tip. And the thing is I tip very generously."
Sam L.,"Irvine, CA",0,1,,2.0,4/19/2016,"Went here last night and got food poisoning. I love bjs but unfortunately will never eat at this location again. I ate avacado egg rolls, spinach and artichoke dip and a cheese pizza."
Alex M.,"Laguna Hills, CA",7,54,14,5.0,4/5/2015,Had a questionable experience here last time but this time was great. Our server ryan was extremely helpful & made sure we had a good time!!
Alexa M.,"Hoboken, NJ",1,4,3,5.0,1/15/2015,"Went here with my boy friend after a craving of pizza (I'm from NJ and used to pretty good ny style pizza). The deep dish Hawaiian (I think called fat pig or something?) was awesome, it is a great place holder for East coast pizza cravings- and that is a HUGE compliment. We also ordered the wings exxxxtra spicy, they were great, just the right amount of spice (don't be intimidated by the name). Also, our waiter was awesome and brought us opened wet towelettes when he saw us almost done with the wings (A++ service, I've never had that done before). But the best part was that pazookie. Omg, literally amazing. The best mix of cookie dough and brownie in my mouth ever. I am absolutely returning purely because of that (even though everything else was awesome). The pazookie took dessert to the next level. I am 100% going back for my birthday and going to eat all the pazookies."
Luke G.,"Whittier, CA",1,23,10,2.0,4/3/2014,"Pizookies were great!!! BUT, they got our order wrong, and when they brought the cookies n cream Pizookie like we ordered, they only put a small portion of cookies n cream ice cream. AND it wasn't even cookies n cream ice cream, it was like a cookies n cream whip cream!  If you can process the information above, well then you can see why I was disappointed with the cookies and cream ice cream."
Arman S.,"Irvine, CA",22,32,17,4.0,2/20/2016,"I tried the bogo deal at mainstreet bj's, not my first time dinning at bj's and definitely a go to diner if you're out hanging out with friends on mainstreet, but as a take out option, there are still many better options, both in quality of ingredients and price, the meal felt just a tad too blend, meaning the ingredients were very safely flavored as is the case in many chain restaurants, i tried their new chicken jalapeño pizza, and chicken Alfredo entree, both somewhat heavy on the carb portions, again, expected and acceptable when dinning in at a place like bj's but not my go to choice for take home. The chicken Alfredo actually had a decent portion of meat even though still around 35 to 65% meat to carb ratio, the pizza on the other hand was extremely unbalanced considering bj's famous thick dough pizzas, just eyeballing i would say something around 5 to 10% max both by volume and mass and even low on veggies and other ingredients, felt a bit like eating a giant piece of bread with a thin spread of everything else, but i guess the bogo coupon does make it an acceptable occasional option.  Extra star for the amazing staff and customer service."
Lana A.,"Corona, CA",0,1,,1.0,10/19/2016,"Probably the worst service I've ever had at a restaurant. Servers took their sweet time to come and ask if we needed anything. They forgot about one of my family members dish. My sandwich had spoiled lettuce and avocado that had gone bad, my bread was also soggy and burnt at the same time. Everyone was so rude and would totally ignore us when we wanted their service. I wouldn't recommend coming here at all."
Lexie L.,"Santa Ana, CA",105,8,6,5.0,2/19/2016,"I love Ryan from the bar he made sure my partner and I felt welcomed and took fantastic care of us, however Anthony was being very rude & disrespectful saying that people should leave because of how busy it was when there weren't many people in the establishment. I recommend Ryan as a bartender though."
Jim G.,"Covina, CA",154,439,2,3.0,7/23/2013,"It is BJ's, it is right off the Beach, it is crowded and you know you are going to wait. But is as consistent as all the others.  The service was pretty solid."
Rusty M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",2,33,5,1.0,3/7/2016,I ordered some pasta and it was 15 bucks and the portion was very very small and the noodles were over cooked. I had to wait for service for awhile before being waited on. Way over priced and not very tasty. Won't be back.
Scott N.,"Carmel, IN",210,343,83,4.0,10/29/2013,"BJ's is your standard chain brewpub with a large selection of craft beers and standard pizzas/sandwiches. The menu is enormous and it proved to be quite difficult to navigate the entire thing before our attentive waiter returned to get our order. For appetizers, the hot wings were nothing special, but still satisfying. I did enjoy the fried calamari; it had a great texture/taste and it was hard to put down. I also got a mini-deep dish pizza, which also was exactly what I would have expected.  Overall, I will probably return if I have no where else to go, but there are plenty of options on Main Street and BJ's didn't offer anything that stands out in my mind."
L P.,"Las Vegas, NV",44,53,14,1.0,4/11/2016,Worst service ever !  I am a rewards member and actually have great experience in another Bj's in my hometown. This location has the worst service. I can't even begin to say in detail how horrible my visit in Huntington Beach.  We are in HB all the time and sad to say we will never visit this location.
Cody F.,"La Mirada, CA",16,2,2,5.0,2/10/2016,If you come here make sure you get seated with Kevin he is the man definitely will come back because of the awesome service he gave us
Mike S.,"Big Bear Lake, CA",16,21,5,1.0,8/24/2014,"To say the least last night was a disappointment. After eating elsewhere on Main Street, my girlfriend and I decided to head to BJs for a pizookie. I went on my phone and ordered dine ahead hoping to make it a painless dessert. I reserved a time of 10pm and was told it would be 15 mins. We were sat at 10:30 and did not see our waitress for another 15 minutes. By then our pizookie had arrived and she stopped and apologized. We asked for our bill and that was promptly delivered. Although picking it up was another 10 minute wait. We got up and found our waitress to give her the bill.  The most disappointing part of last night was me accidentally leaving my phone on the table. It took but two block to realize I had forgotten it. We called back and were on hold for 10 mins before I decided to walk back and retrieve my phone. The hostess said they were getting a manager to unlock the office. After 10 mins he comes up empty handed and grabs my info seeming very insincere. I assured him I knew I had left it at the table and that I was going to locate my iPhone with my girlfriends phone. I asked what would happen when I found my iPhone located there. He said I would not find it because no one had it. I step outside and begin locating my phone and before I could even locate my phone I received a call from the waitress stating she had found my phone.  I walk right back into BJs and she has my phone I'm hand. I ask her where she found it as the manager walks up and she is stumbling over her words to give an answer or a name. I was livid. I then asked the manager what the policy was on lost items for the restaurant as I could only assume it would be to turn them in or place them in a certain location for patrons.  Having worked at restaurants, I know this type of thing happens a lot. I also know things like a phone just do not go ""missing"" one moment and there the next. Sad to know that there is such a lack of honesty and integrity at an establishment such as this one.  We will certainly never eat at this particular BJs again.  -mike"
Renee G.,"Los Alamitos, CA",328,417,149,2.0,9/8/2015,Worst location I have been to. The service was not only bad but so slow it was insane. The food was so below average and I used to love BJ's Pizza they usually make great drinks and have great food but this trip was not even somewhat good. I doubt I would ever go back. Staff was rude and food sucked
Iris W.,"Fountain Valley, CA",6,20,37,3.0,8/28/2014,"Just order the Pzookie, everything else is whatever. Been here a couple of times with friends and I have to say that the food is mediocre at best, service is decent, and the only thing worth ordering is the famous Pzookie! Warning: it is like 2000 calories but of pure tastiness! They put a scoop of ice cream on this thick, large cookie/cake thing, and it will make all your problems go away. Well, for a few seconds anyways! The service is ok, haven't been good or bad.  No dogs allowed even on the patio, we tried once and they wouldn't let us, so we had to eat elsewhere with the doggie."
Trish S.,"Escondido, CA",910,82,271,2.0,8/10/2014,"My family and I came here while we came up to watch the US OPEN, we notice that they were open at 8AM for breakfast. Because who doesn't like BJ's and Bloody Marys in the morning amiright? The breakfast food was really good. The service sucked. I had to go up to the bar twice and ask if we could get some waters.  When they first opened there was only like us and a couple of other people there to eat. Didn't really get busy until after we got our food. WHICH took about 40 mins. The staff there was looking for another waitress that apparently disappeared, and customers were coming in (sitting outside), was starting to get busy. The missing waitress I think her name was Maria? came back into the  restaurant and said she was looking for the fu*king managers card, or something to that effect. Flipping out in the bar area where MY family 7 and 8 year old were at eating their breakfast. Lots of F bombs going on. Took everything I had to not go punch her in the throat =)  WITH THAT SAID, I don't know who the Hostess was as far as her name goes, but she was great. She came and got our empty plates came and gave my family refills while our waitress was MIA. Super sweet girl. I ordered 2 bloody marys while I was there, because that is how I get my vegetable in take. They were WAY different. The first one was the bomb the second one tasted like a V8 with a bunch of olives in it. GROSS. I also asked for a Diet Coke for my daughter who has Type 1 diabetes and they gave her a Dr. pepper or Mr. pib. Thanks Assh0les, I specifically asked the waitress anything Diet please because my daughter has Type 1. It wasn't like we had a huge order of drinks to get mixed up and it wasn't even busy yet. The girl who was the awesome bartender came up to another employee and was telling her and showing her how a brand new bottle broke over the ice and had to melt the ice because of the glass that was broken into it. Yes thank you for announcing that as I am sitting here drinking my V8 Bloody mary. Best service ever! The last 2 BJ's that I have been to have been in the OC. NO THANK YOU. I will stick to the San Diego BJ's and anywhere else that is not related to the OC. I gave 2 stars because of the Hostess.  T~"
