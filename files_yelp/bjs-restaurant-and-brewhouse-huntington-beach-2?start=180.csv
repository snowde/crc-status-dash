Scott P.,"Corona, CA",151,91,97,5.0,4/4/2015,BJ's is always good. We got great service even though it was packed. Fast friendly service. It's also right close to the beach and great atmosphere.
Jeff B.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,7,,2.0,9/7/2016,I have been going to BJs for years and like their menu but this is not a good restaraunt. They have the worst service. It's really more of a bar. I live near and go there a couple of times a month. I have never seen the same server twice.
Paige W.,"Fullerton, CA",0,3,,1.0,3/24/2016,"Terrible service. Was seated really quickly because it wasn't crowded. It took over an hour and half for our food to come out. Mind you, this is a party of 2 people. By the time our food got out, it was the wrong order. I had to wait ANOTHER 30 minutes for my correct order to get out. Then they took yet another 25 minutes to bring out the bill. Complained to the manager about the inconvenience and was not given any apology or any discount of some sort or compensation. Not even something small. Again no apology was ever given. Do not eat here unless you love terrible service!"
Jess M.,"Irvine, CA",2,26,6,3.0,1/18/2016,"My boyfriend and I love coming to BJ's, the food is always amazing and Ryan is always accommodating. We came a week ago and had a lady named Whitney. I ordered a new cocktail that wasn't very good and she made it seem like a hassle that I didn't like it. So I asked for another drink instead. At the end of the meal I was charged for both cocktails and she sighed at the table when I asked her to take off the bad cocktail. As a server, the money spent on making the bad cocktail wasn't coming out of her pocket, so there should be no reason for giving attitude to a customer. Customer service is always first!"
Keith D.,"Bloomfield, NJ",5,43,26,4.0,3/6/2015,Had some appetizers and the very berry margarita. Absolutely delicious. Had the california club flatbread pizza and it was excellent. Worth a try for sure!
Chav H.,"Fullerton, CA",2,5,,2.0,5/16/2015,"The gluten free options were very limited. They have a separate menu with allergens, which is helpful. But where most of the dishes usually can be adjusted slightly to make them allergen-free, there were not really any options to do so here.  We shared Atlantic salmon and Balsamic chicken. The salmon was served without the rice or sauce (contains wheat). The dish was fresh, but very blend, if not boring. The Balsamic chicken had a great taste, the combination with cranberries was very nice. The chicken itself was slightly dry.  The restrooms were not clean at all.  The place was alive :-) not to say crowded and loud. Liked the atmosphere still. Our service was pretty ok.  Like the berry cider a lot!"
Tiffany L.,"Costa Mesa, CA",178,68,16,2.0,6/21/2014,"I've never had a terrible experience at ANY BJ's restaurant until I came here.  A couple friends and I were seated after waiting 20 or so minutes on a Friday night. Our server brought our drink after being seated for a couple minutes. We ordered three appetizers: potato skins, traditional wings, and spinach and artichoke dip. Being super hungry, we were excitedly waiting for our appetizers!  We waited between 30-40 MINUTES just the appetizers alone. We watched in agony as tables around us received their appetizers AND meals. Our server barely acknowledged us for the first 20 minutes. Then after, she came to our table and asked us if we got our appetizers when it was very obvious that we didn't since the appetizer plates was stacked exactly how she left it. Isn't it her responsibility to know? But no! She told us she didn't know what happened, and then left to care for other customers. If you don't know what happened, figure it out and put in another order. A simple explanation could be nice. It's reasonable if maybe another server took our food by mistake; my table won't be mad but just let us know instead of ""I don't know what happened"". But thanks for reassuring me that you don't know what you are doing.  The manager eventually came to our table and told us he didn't know what happened either. Sigh....  but thank goodness he brought it out after 5 more minutes. He also made it on the house to make up for the long wait.  We were about 75 percent done with the appetizers when they brought out pizookies. We ordered them in advance and told them to bring it out after our meal. We had to stop the appetizers, no way I was letting the ice cream melt! After I finished the pizookie, I finished my appetizers. This is probably the weirdest dinner sequence I've ever experienced. The whole timing of the night was very off. We received our appetizers late, but our pizookies early. I think I'll stick to the Bella Terra location as my go-to BJ's from now on."
Maureen K.,"Pittsburgh, PA",124,53,52,4.0,10/6/2014,"The bartender, Brady , was great. Up beat and was attentive. Seating at the bar for lunch was easy and comfortable. Food came out quickly. Drinks are a bit expensive here though. I wasn't expecting my rum and diet to cost $7.75. I am used to east coast prices where an expensive mixed drink is $5. Other than that, the place is nice and has a good ambiance. Considering planing a company putting here."
Tanya K.,"Huntington Beach, CA",2,21,3,1.0,1/31/2016,I am a huge BJs goer however this experience was really disappointing.  Me and my friend went out for dinner around 9:30pm before going to a bar and the service was horrible. It took 20 minutes for us to submit our order and we had to ask for our refills several times.  It seemed like there was 1 server with a girl helping him for the entire bar.  It was so hard to enjoy which is sad because I love BJs.  Guess I'm not going to that location ever again.
Nancy P.,"Baldwin Park, CA",41,77,16,4.0,11/18/2014,"I go to BJ's all the time. You come here because you know what you're going to get (service, type of food, quality of food, beer choices). Sure enough, it was just that. It is possible that extra ice cream scoops for pazookie desserts are free..so that made me happy. No food review here."
Lupe P.,"South Gate, CA",214,141,115,1.0,8/4/2015,"I got sick from eating salmon at this particular location. I normally don't have a problem but on this particular evening I ended up sick for about 3 days, laid out in bed shivering not being able to eat or drink anything. Not a very pleasant feeling! Maybe it was because it was so late in the evening and we were waiting for my daughter to finish having dinner with her friends but either way we will definitely not be going back."
Jackie J.,"La Mirada, CA",19,19,7,1.0,6/29/2015,"Took a friend out for her birthday and we had horrible service. We waited about 5 mins or so for someone to seat us and the worker wasn't even a host. We came before the lunch crowd and it still took forever. We ordered an appetizer and the guy forgot to put it in and didn't even offer to give it to us for free. The salad had horrible dressing, and my friend's salmon was very plain. In total, we were there for an hour. Most of that hour was spent waiting for our food. If the service for our check was as quick as our food, we would have been happy, but oh well, never making that mistake again. Go to another BJs, this place cannot serve well before or after a crowd. Especially, when a crowd rolls in."
Lana L.,"Orange, CA",213,44,8,2.0,3/12/2016,"So the location is amazing, and people watching is fun and easy to do here... But the service sucks. Half our table didn't get refills until dessert, and one person in our group didn't get their drink at all. They also never cleared the table, which made eating dessert difficult with appetiser plates and dinner plates. The food is fine, standard Bjs. Nothing special. If you're looking for somewhere cool to eat while visiting the Huntington pier I would go somewhere else."
Gabie L.,"Los Angeles, CA",32,75,257,4.0,8/13/2014,"My friend is a regular here since she loves fried avocado menu (don't know its name..). I and my friend went here Tuesday for happy hours (3-7pm) so we didn't need to wait. We ordered all happy hour menu like fried avocado, deep dish pizza, and spinach dip with nachos. They were not super great but just okay as bar food since we were drinking wine/beer/martini. Our waiter was professional and food was just great with drinks, especially fried avocado which is very unique menu here. Will come back when I visit Huntington Beach again."
Berna T.,"Los Angeles, CA",334,302,440,4.0,6/5/2013,"BJs is always a safe option if you want good food and drinks! Happy hour is even better! I came here after a long beach day and it was a bit empty around 5pm on a Tuesday. I came here many times before for their pizookies - yum, which are super gooey and great with the ice cream.  Their deep dish pizza is a good option - minis are only $6 during happy hour! I got the barbecue chicken and the chicken bacon ranch pizza. The barbecue chicken in my opinion was the better of the two - it was coated with cooked tomatoes and had a great barbecue sauce underneath it. The chicken bacon ranch pizza seemed to be missing the ranch component and all I could taste was chicken with a bit of bacon."
Len B.,"Costa Mesa, CA",0,20,,1.0,8/23/2016,cant believe how bad the pizza has got here!!!!! Hire some chefs get the proper dough and stop pennypinching...does anybody look at these pies before they go for a togo order. I will never come here again!!!!!
Sandhi T.,"N HOLLYWOOD, CA",10,8,1,1.0,7/31/2014,"This would have been a 4 star review had there been proper follow through. I am usually impressed with the experiences I have at most BJ's. I was truly impressed by the swift reply to my initial feedback. Despite this, a person named Jesse reached out to me after I was disappointed with a recent experience. He wanted to make things right by offering me a courtesy card. In order to do so I provided him with personal information -- my home address on 6/17/2014. It has been more than a month and have not received anything, which is upsetting because now BJ's has personal information of mine in which I trusted to disclose to them; which is my mistake because I wasn't aware of what they were going to do with that information (apparently not send me a courtesy card). So my advice is if BJ's asks for personal information don't, because it seems they have no process in place that ensures that they will deliver on what they promise (when it comes to customer feedback)  and it's unclear as to whether or not that information is secure or used for other purposes."
Ellen J.,"Huntington Beach, CA",4,36,3,4.0,11/29/2014,"One of our favorite places to go on Main St. when it's busy.  With their free Premier Rewards card, you can use the app on your phone to make an advance seating request, and even order your food if you want.   This is great when it's busy! The Premier Rewards also lets you see your bill and pay using the app on your phone.  Also, the points add up pretty quickly, and you can use them to take money off of your bill or get a free dessert. Aside from the convenience of the benefits of Premiere Rewards, the menu is pretty large, so you can find something for everybody.  The food is pretty good.  I recently had a mediocre appetizer.  I sent it back, and they quickly replaced it.  Other than that, I think we've enjoyed everything we've ordered... especially the pizza and salads.  The bar is large with great drinks and a big screen to watch games."
Steve R.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,6,,5.0,2/17/2016,Ate at BJ'S and John was our waiter. He was very helpful and made some excellent recommendations. I will ask to sit in his station next time we go. Thanks for your help John.
Josh S.,"Newport Beach, CA",383,13,1,2.0,8/2/2015,"The food is usually good.  Service is OK. Every time I go here the floor, tables and bathrooms are disgusting. They should really keep all of those things clean.  I've been here 10+ times and it's always dirty."
