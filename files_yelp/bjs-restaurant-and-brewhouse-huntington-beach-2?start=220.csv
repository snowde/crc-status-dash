Florence H.,"Huntington Beach, CA",94,68,121,1.0,5/7/2015,"Was here for dinner last night with my daughter.  Our waitress (Haylie) totally sucked!! I thought maybe she was just having a bad day, but seeing the other reviews it seems to be the norm for service at this restaurant.  We had to ask for our water to be refilled.  I ordered a pizookie for dessert and also asked for a box for my daughter's leftovers.  She didn't return with the box for a good 20 minutes and when she did, she handed the check over with it!  WTH, I don't even have my dessert yet, and she's already cashing me out!! When dessert arrived I asked for a to go box for it and she looked at me like I was nuts and said ""You want a box for the pizookie?""  Uh, Yeah! You friggin took forever getting us the first box, dumba**!!  I didn't say it, but I was shooting her the look!   I had shown a coupon prior to ordering dinner, it was buy one entree, get one free.  Of course, the check did not reflect the discount! So the waitress had to get the manager to verify the coupon was legit.  The manager inspected it with a fine tooth comb before honoring the coupon.   I don't know how this crappy restaurant stays in business."
David T.,"Huntington Beach, CA",4,73,25,5.0,7/14/2015,"We eat at this BJs 2 or 3 times a month, the foods great but so many bad times with the service. Well much to our delight we got a server that we have not had before. Ashley L. Very nice ,very attentive and just stayed on top of all our needs. This nite is HB Streetfair nite where the restaurants get Sooo busy but Ashley L did a great job of handling things,, hope we get her next time and even better if other servers learn her secrets, thanks"
Mai T.,"Irvine, CA",137,27,40,2.0,7/8/2015,I like the atmosphere here since its nearby the beach and always pretty packed. Their food isnt so great. Their baked beignet is so disappointed. It was soggy and they were so stingy with the ice cream. One small scoop with several strawberries on the side and some whip cream ontop for $7....?? No thank you. Dont come here for dessert. A lot of choices for drinks and food doe! Great place for hangouts but ill pass the dessert.
Tab G.,"Long Beach, CA",21,5,,1.0,4/8/2016,"This BJ's was a big disappointment.  1st we called ahead and were quoted a wait time of 15 minutes but it was actually 30 minutes (not too big a deal because we requested a booth on a Friday night). 2nd, my wife ordered a chicken tortilla soup to go along with her meal and specifically asked that the soup be brought out first and NOT at the same time as her meal.  Her request was ignored because the soup came out about 30 seconds before the rest of the meal.  So when faced with 2 hot items to eat at the same time, chances are one of them will be cold when it's time to eat it.  Needless to say, one of the items were sent back.  At this point a manager will come over to the table to find out what went wrong and reassure the customer it won't happen again or something along those lines.  The manager at this restaurant just dropped the check off then bounced.  I don't like when organizations seem to take for granted that people don't have money trees or have access to large sums of money but rather have to work hard to earn their money.  We can choose where to spend our hard earned money and if I'm not treated like you care whether or not I'm satisfied, I won't be spending my money at your establishment.  I'm sure this is not a normative occupancy at BJs but one apple can spoil the bunch.  Beware of shotty customer at this location."
Ella M.,"Costa Mesa, CA",0,6,1,1.0,9/20/2015,"Poor experience! All I ordered were two pizookies which take 5 min to make. 45min later a different server tells me they're out of chocolate chunk. That's horrible customer service, granting there were so many workers."
George B.,"Lancaster, CA",204,12,1,4.0,8/11/2015,"Simply loved it, music out side, friendly service and food came out fast even house it was a crowded"
Terry W.,"Costa Mesa, CA",52,40,,4.0,6/4/2015,"This is one of our mainstays when we come over to wander around Huntington Beach. Went in last night to order a couple of their Tavern Cut pizzas. Everything went well, until my Extreme Pepperoni version showed up looking something less than 'extreme.' Although not his fault, our server Alan swung into action and turned a disappointment into a very pleasant experience! Anyone can make a mistake, but you really show your ""chops"" by how you handle a difficult situation, and Alan did himself proud! He's a keeper! Oh, and for the record, the Tavern Cut pizzas are THE BEST!"
Jennifer H.,"Dallas, TX",53,102,23,4.0,7/5/2012,"The server was awesome, the food was delicious and my pizookie was the best. I love the Oatmeal cookie one, it's just enough sweetness. The other ones are a bit too sweet for my liking.  Probably one of my favorite BJ's I've ever been to. Even during the US Open, the service is still fantastic. That says something! Under pressure, they're diamonds."
Judi S.,"Orange County, CA",1138,1153,310,1.0,9/2/2011,It's a little before 7PM on a Wednesday night.The bar is full and they won't sit me on the patio to wait for friends before a Yelp event because I don't have a reservation. There are 8 open tables on the front patio and people keep funneling into the restaurant but no one else is being seated on said patio area. BJ's...you suck! Or atleast your hellhound gatekeeper does. I'm sure those teenagers in beachwear shivering with wet towels around them is what pays your bills... NOT.  Add this to the list of the reasons why I hate HB. I'm never treated like this at their Irvine location. Never.
Bobby C.,"Los Angeles, CA",379,1502,703,4.0,11/10/2011,"I agree with Robert Q. about hating chain restaurants, but I feel Bj's ins't as franchised as TGIFs, Chillis, etc. More of a regional chain.  So when we found ourselves late, hungry,  wondering down Main St., in HB, they were the only ones open where I knew we could get a good meal at a solid price. I've never written a review for BJ's before, but I really liked this one a lot -- been to the Burbank and Glendale ones, which seem too busy and loud. The service was good, the pumpkin ale seasonal brew was a great recommendation by our server.  Wasn't too hungry and I love that they have a small bites section where you can basically order tapas style. I got a side of mac and cheese with bacon--pretty good. But the best thing were these new chicken/cream cheese wontons... Wow! Only three of them, but they are very rich, so it was the right portion unless you were going to share.  My lady got a solid angel hair pasta and they didn't charge us to substitute for alfredo sauce. Love this little Cali chain. The pizzas which my friend had never seem to disappoint,"
Stephanie B.,"Murrieta, CA",28,132,24,1.0,3/21/2015,"If i could give this place no stars I would. The service was so terrible and the food was cold. We had two different servers, both were awful. 20 mins to get water and soda, 30 minutes to get an appetizer, and by the time our food showed up it was cold. Tried explaining this to the manger, she was beyond rude and no help. It's a shame when a manager is rude to the customers that fund her place of employment. I'm guess having a personal conversation is more important. Never will we eat here again."
Melissa I.,"Murrieta, CA",330,18,3,4.0,3/29/2015,"Came in to watch the Ducks game and had a good time. Steven A was our bartender and he was amazing! Super friendly, attentive and quick. The only drawback was the hostess. She was rude and it took me at least 10 minutes to get her attention from the personal conversation she was having. Had I had to wait for a table I probably would have left.  Snag a spot at the bar and have a great time!"
Adam A.,"Costa Mesa, CA",1,21,2,5.0,11/18/2014,"I have been here a few tomes, and never have I had a bad experience... the bar tender Gina, that's G-I-N-A , is awesome! Has a great attitude towards every patron she serves! I watched another patron proceed to scream and yell and her, and she just kept her cool and let him leave peacefully. She is amazing with her customer service, don't believe what any other reviews say,  treat any bar tender with respect, and they will take care of you, and never has that rang more true than with Gina!"
Tyler R.,"Portland, OR",14,91,10,5.0,4/8/2015,This is a must visit every time I'm in town! Great bartenders and great people! Right on the main drag with plenty of people watching. The deep dish pizza is to die for. I advise not sharing it with anyone because you're going to want to take it home for left overs! Come hungry!!!
Hope R.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,1,,1.0,9/24/2015,"Literally have been sitting at the high top tables for a good 45min.. Finally someone took our order. Waited another 40min and finally got our food. As the food runner was dropping off our food I asked for ranch. For the next 10 min I watched him bring ketchup, ranch, and other small things to other people but NEVER brought us ranch. Finally our waiter came and asked us how our food was so I asked her for ranch but it took forever to come. When she finally brought us our ranch we were more than halfway done with our food. So lame, had we waited for the stupid ranch our food would have been cold!"
Armila D.,"Los Angeles, CA",92,70,,1.0,7/11/2013,"This is probably the worst BJ's that I've ever been to.  I came here on a Saturday afternoon around 4 pm. The place was only moderately crowded so there should not have been any excuses for the slow and terrible service that my party received. While our waiter was quick to take our order, he forgot to get us silverware. During our meal, I asked for hot sauce and had to remind him twice for it. When our pizzookie sampler platter came, he didn't bother clearing our table. He also didn't refill our waters until I asked him to and I had to flag him down for our check after already patiently waiting for 10 minutes for him to realize that we were done eating. I will never come back to this BJ's again."
Samantha H.,"Pomona, CA",170,99,265,3.0,5/21/2012,"Stopped here after going on a bike ride all the way from Santa Ana. We were dying for some carbs in our system. This is by the pier so it tends to be packed. We decided to go with the avocado egg roll appetizer. These are always good especially since we were hungry.As far as dinner, I wanted to try something other than the pizza. Decided to go for the scampi shrimp pasta. I was surprised by the amount of pasta they gave me. Huge portion. The pasta was alright but was lacking some kind of sauce. It tasted kind of dry. The shrimp tasted pretty fresh though. Our server kind of took forever to get our order too. And that is why I'm giving them 3 stars. Service could have been a little better."
Andy F.,"Santa Ana, CA",5,1,,5.0,5/23/2015,It's my first time at this BJ's. The food is great the pizza flat bread is bomb I ordered pep pineapples and ham. So far so good
Alexis B.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,14,,1.0,4/5/2016,"Worst customer services by far. Host doesn't know how to count how many people need to be seated, when you go in she doesn't greet you and just stares you down. Waiters/ waitresses are not on top of things and pretty much seem to not genuinely care if the customer is satisfied or not. Never come to fill your beverages. I've received cold food more than once at this place. I have been here a couple times because I live about 5 minutes away walking distance and I get disappointed every time. I've finally stopped going and driving else where instead. I work at the bjs headquarters close to Bella terra and always see employees come in, seem to have no energy won't greet you. Would love to see a restaurant on Main Street like bjs have higher standards in who they employ."
Sierra C.,"Los Alamitos, CA",197,14,2,1.0,5/17/2015,Came on a Sunday for brunch.. Usually a good service. But our server never came back. We orders food then never saw her again. Thanks for the crap service. Spent 30 bucks on no one waiting on me
