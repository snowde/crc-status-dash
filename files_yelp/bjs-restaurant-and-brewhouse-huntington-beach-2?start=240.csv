B G.,"Garden Grove, CA",0,26,,4.0,8/2/2015,"Over spring break 2015 visited twice with my daughter (12).  We enjoyed both meals, dinner first visit. I had small BJ special and it was awesome and she had the chicken alfredo and loved it. We sat on patio and had a great time even though it was lightly raining. Next visit a few days later for lunch after the morning spent on the beach...I had the avocado burger and she had the chicken fingers and again...great meal for both of us. This time we sat in the bar area at table...nice experience."
Nigel M.,"Ithaca, NY",0,1,,2.0,4/22/2016,"Food was delicious. Three of the four drinks ordered were undrinkable, I don't recommend ordering anything but beer or wine! The margaritas were purely mix, so thick and sweet they would make anyone sick. One of the servers suggested we pay $8.00 for a tequila shot to add to each. They did end up removing them from the  bill which was considerate."
Barry H.,"Fountain Valley, CA",0,17,3,5.0,5/12/2015,"Happy hour on Tuesday, 5/12/2015. Cory is tending bar. Although I am drinking rather than eating, the food passing by looks great. The beers are delicious and at the right temperature. Place is clean. Background music at proper level. Everyone looks happy. All personnel busy. I'll be back."
Cindy W.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",0,14,,4.0,7/23/2015,"Good food, friendly staff, overall a nice place for lunch. Why not 5 stars? Waaaay too much food items on the menu. When it takes 10 minutes to ""study"" the numerous pages of dishes, it's hard to figure out what's their best dishes (signature missing). I also found their offers confusing, half of them apply only to certain days and so shouldn't be given to the customer when they don't apply. Lastly, I would never pay more than $10 for a pasta dish unless it contains expensive ingredients which none of theirs had. Other than that I'd be happy to go back for an easy peasy lunch."
Berry P.,"Scottsdale, AZ",106,32,6,1.0,5/3/2015,"Horrible service! We were in town visiting looking for a late night bite to eat. We waiting 25 minutes just for a glass of water not even from our server. About another 20 minutes go by until our server came by, not only did she not greet us, she didn't even apologize for the wait (mind you, she maybe had 5 tables in her section) She was rude and rolled her eyes at everything and we saw her constantly complaining inside to the host. We saw other tables waiting around for drinks, they eventually went into the bar themselves to get a drink. The food was decent and came out quick but the due to the fact of the service we wont be returning."
Kim G.,"Pico Rivera, CA",175,853,122,4.0,7/12/2013,"pretty good BJs in Huntington beach area. Same food as all the other chains around. nothing really special about this place.  Parking is a little tricky though, so best bet, park at structure if your coming here."
Krystle F.,"Huntington Beach, CA",19,7,,1.0,9/21/2014,This place sucks. Worst service ever.. Flies just everywhere. Our food came to our table cold. Just an overall horrible experience.
Miguel C.,"Santa Ana, CA",2,46,4,1.0,8/9/2014,NO STARS IF APPLICABLE. Honestly i don't know what i was thinking going here on 2 occasions. first time i went with my 2 buddies during the week and were the only customers there. the servers weren't even around to sit us down. our server was flirting with another employee. when they did sit us down they walked away and didn't even start us of with drinks. when they did. IT TOOK FOREVER TO GET THE DRINKS! took them along time to check up on us and get our order. we ordered the pizza that took forever and when it came to the table not only was it cold but it was infested with flies. it was disgusting we wanted to speak with the manager but even him was being incompetent and didn't do anything for us. WORST SERVICE EVER!  SECOND TIME. i don't know WHY IN THE WORLD I WOULD COMEBACK. but really wanted a drink with my girlfriend. we asked to sit at the bar and got a drink. it took them 10 min to talk to us and get our request and another 15 min to make the drink. NEVER AGAIN IN MY LIFE and we are spreading the word to everyone we know to NOT COME AND SPEND YOUR MONEY HERE! THIS BJS RESTAURANT HAS GOT TO THE WORST DINE IN PLACE IVE EVER BEEN TO IN MY LIFE. and I've gone to crappy restaurants. BUT THIS PLACE TAKES THE WIN!.
Julie L.,"Orange County, CA",374,1061,521,2.0,11/24/2013,"I came here on a Saturday night when everything else was packed. I got a flight of tasters - 5 ounce pours of 4 beers: blonde (my favorite because it was refreshing), Jeremiah Red, Piranha, and pale ale. The restaurant was empty with a few people having beers and dinner. This location is much smaller than the location on Edinger."
Joe I.,"Lake Forest, CA",476,374,139,4.0,11/21/2013,"As far as BJ's is concerned, this location serves pretty much the same fare as the rest of its bretheren.  My friends and I  like to come down here during the week to grab a beer and people watch.  The night I went I enjoyed a tasty Cookies & Cream Pizookie.  Tony was our server and he was on top of everything.  The food came quickly and the patio is a nice place to sit when it is warm out."
Marissa G.,"Redondo Beach, CA",307,567,134,4.0,6/4/2011,"Came in at 10:30 for brunch since the Sugar Shack was crowded and my dad was too hungry to wait. We were the only ones in the whole restaurant. The hostess seemed annoyed that we wanted a regular table instead of a booth or a high table.  The food was delicious. We each had the California Scramble. I also tried their new brew, the Nit Wit. It was alright. Had an herbal/orange aftertaste that I could have done without. Sort of reminded me of smoking weed, to be quite honest. In all, I'd go back if I didn't want to wait for a table at Sugar Shack again."
Ally T.,"Huntington Beach, CA",24,2,,1.0,4/13/2015,"I normally have a pretty average experience at BJs, but tonight is probably the worst experience I've had at ANY restaurant service-wise. Not only did it take 20 minutes to get my ICED TEA, but it took a half hour to have my order taken, and I saw the server maybe twice the whole time. Any time I was asked if I needed anything, it was another server who relayed the message to my actual server. The icing on the cake was the 20 minute wait for the check, and the extra 10 it took for our ACTUAL waitress to ring it up. Needless to say I'm pretty disappointed. If a waitress can't handle a few tables at 11pm, I question her profession."
Grace L.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,2,,2.0,4/5/2016,"My friend and I love going to BJ's for dinner. One day we went and ordered 2 meals and then 2 child pizookie's. A waiter, not our waitress, brought us the two pizookies but one was a children's and the other was an adult. We told him and he said he would charge us for 2 children's. My friend and I were very pleased with how nice he was. Then our waitress brought us the bill and charged us for a children's and adult pizookie. We told her what had happened and she said ""No, I heard you guys and you said 1 child and 1 adult pizookie"". She was extremely rude and didn't believe us so we ended up paying for a pizookie we did not intend to buy."
Mk T.,"Garden Grove, CA",2,12,9,1.0,4/11/2015,"Giving one star is way too generous. I went to BJ's today with two other people and the service was SO BAD. We were treated as a joke just because we looked young. They probably thought we were going to dine and dash. Keep in mind we arrived at 5 pm. We ordered an appetizer, a pizza, and the trio pizookie. The appetizer took 20 minutes to come out. After we finished that, the pizza was still not out yet. We basically stared at each other across the table for 40 minutes. I caught myself asking ""where's the pizza?!"" at least 5 times. Our waitress passed our table so many times. Not once did she check up on us, yet she checked other tables to see how they were doing. We also asked for parmesan cheese but by the time our waitress brought it out, we finished the pizza. Last was the pizookie. We specifically ordered it after finishing the appetizer because we knew it would take awhile to make. We figured that if we ordered it early, then we would get it right after we finished the pizza. We thought wrong. It took an additional 20 minutes after constantly pestering three other waiters. The service was so bad that it left me at a loss for words. Other people who came after us left before we even got our dessert. We didn't even leave the restaurant until around 7:50. I have never felt so disrespected. This sort of treatment is unacceptable. NO ONE should ever be belittled just because of their age and I will NOT be coming back to this location. BTW, I'm not writing a review to try to get compensation. I'm writing one to let others know that it's NOT OKAY to look down on others and treat them unfairly. Not only did I leave in a bad mood, but I lost 2 hours and 50 minutes that I'll never get back."
Ty Z.,"Long Beach, CA",8,42,3,3.0,2/15/2015,"Food was good but the service was horrible.  I waited 30 min for my food and then when i asked for more syrup, it never came."
Teresa K.,"Anaheim, CA",57,138,43,3.0,9/1/2014,"Always good food, but inefficient service. This establishment need to be more particular on who it hires to work with it's customer."
Laura A.,"Huntington Beach, CA",27,24,5,4.0,2/9/2015,We always sit at the bar and the bartenders are always great!!!! the only reason I'm not rating 5 stars is they've taken off one of the most popular items the chicken lettuce wraps for somebody that really can't eat carbs this is a really great option!!! Miss it!!!
Dillon G.,"Point Loma, San Diego, CA",18,97,33,1.0,7/26/2014,"WORST fucking service I've ever had in my life. Girlfriend and I went here last night, it was somewhat busy but nothing that an experienced server shouldn't be able to handle. I'm pretty sure our waiter was on HEAVY drugs, guy was so slow, my girlfriend noticed him nodding off at the cash register. Dude was uninterested in making a good impression and acted like he was shackled to the ground to work there that night. I really hope the manager's look at these reviews because everyone around us was complaining about this guy up the wazoo. Not a good sign if we think your staff is on drugs, I think you should know about it before me. Food was excellent but damn you guys need to step it up. Your customer service is terrible. There was a table of kids next to us and they were even wondering what the guys problem was...... Future liability issue!!!"
Julia G.,"Huntington Beach, CA",31,19,3,5.0,3/2/2015,"First off my favorite server is Joe, he delivers every time I'm there. It's hard to get his section sometimes but when he's open I go to him.  My favorite thing to order is the Hawaiian pizza and my mom loves the Ahi Salad.  And of course finish off with a Pazookie :) They have a good happy hour that is affordable.  And it gets busy!"
Jason B.,"Costa Mesa, CA",0,13,1,3.0,5/16/2015,"So I'm giving this place three stars only because at least the bartender was nice and attentive. I usually don't get food at this particular location because I come to the stores and shop but I stopped for a couple drinks and decided to get their lasagna just to be disappointed. The food came out quickly but they weren't busy so I figured must be because they are slow. Their ""lasagna"" tasted like something you buy at the groceries store frozen and throw in the microwave; in fact, I believe that's exactly what they did. Tasted bad, will not get food at this location any longer. guess it's hard to find good authentic Italian style food these days."
