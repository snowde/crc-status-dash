Terry B.,"Huntington Beach, CA",1,29,10,5.0,1/16/2015,"Perfect place to catch the game with cheap craft beers.when an NFL game is on, it's happy hour pricing on food and drink specials in the bar area.     The place is clean and has an upscale look, but has some of the cheapest prices on Mainstreet. All the servers here are fantastic, and  this place has a good mix of locals, visitors and tourists, awesome times to be had conversing with everybody here. Sitting at the outside tables is surely a fantastic experience just people watching, either listening to music at Surf City Nights (Every Tuesday night) or soaking up some rays during the day!    BJ's does kind of bust my rule though; don't go to a bar to eat, and don't go to a restaurant to drink. For me, the compact eatery/bar is just what I'm looking for when I go downtown HB. Not all the food is to my liking here, but I've weeded my way around the menu and have found great dishes to go with my house IPA. Good luck and see us here!!!"
Dave J.,"Weehawken, NJ",0,28,,1.0,9/17/2015,"Lets start off by saying that the they really earned this 1 star rating. It all began this past Tuesday. I ordered a beer and when it arrived and I started to taste it I was greeted with a lovely grain taste in which that means that the lines need to be cleaned. Of course the bartenders tried stating to our server that nothing was wrong with the beer after they tested it. Second, when our food arrived I noticed immediately a lovely hair on the burger so when I presented it to the waitress I asked her what does this look like and she "" I don't know a string or hair"" I immediately said to her try a hair that was on my burger. She immediately took it back and now I got to watch my wife eat as I waited for a new burger. Now during this entire time, not once did the manager come over to apologize for the beer and definitely not even the food. Until the very last moment is when the manager came over to apologize and stated that my burger will be out in 30 seconds hmmm try another 5 minutes. So for all you people that like to visit Bj's on main st in Huntington Beach I would stay clear of this restaurant for not only will you get crappy beer but you dine with hairy food. Oh and I called their corporate yesterday and I received a voicemail and still no response. What a terrible company."
Bigg E.,"Santa Ana, CA",31,39,68,5.0,11/29/2014,"I give the staff 5 stars. They were great, super cool ambience and quick service for a weekend supper. Our server Jennifer P. was very attentive and friendly. One item we ordered was all sold out but they made up for it on the final check. Overall the food was good, typical of a Friday's or Chili's, but the main attraction for me is the variety of beverages. They have plenty of craft beer, wine, and cocktails to pick from. Good place, great people."
Jason M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",8,18,2,2.0,6/20/2014,"Beware out of staters. Our friend from out of town was visiting and they took his i.d. so the manager could verify its authenticity which was not terrible but still annoying. Every time I have gone the experiences have gotten progressively worse. It's crowded, slow, food orders forgotten. They neglected to bring plates for the pizza. There are plenty of other restaurants in Huntington Beach go to one of them instead. Unless you absolutely have to see a game and no where else is playing it."
Vinnie N.,"Huntington Beach, CA",468,368,82,4.0,7/13/2011,"Everybody love BJ's!  Alright get your mind out of the gutter, I'm talking about pizza of course ;) Order a beer and get down on some heavy carbs. Deep dish pizzas are cooked well most of the time. The salads, although a bit pricey are delicious. Get one with your pizza so you don't feel like a total fat ass for eating pizza only. If you're on your second pitcher, well I guess you're not here on a health binge. Service is friendly and the downtown HB location adds plenty of ambiance to the whole laid-back beach goer experience.  Recommended date location, I mean a walk on the pier, watching the sunset, then downing a pizookie after dinner? That's romance baby!"
Ally C.,"Huntington Beach, CA",11,18,2,4.0,11/9/2014,"Came for happy hour with a friend tonight and it was pretty nice. Decent service but the drinks seemed kinda weak,maybe new staff? Overall it was good since it wasn't too heavy of a crowd. Great location to walk around after a few drinks and have fun with friends"
Crystal S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",148,186,105,3.0,5/25/2011,"Wow....What an experience, this place left me as confused as the staff was. Let me explain, we had 3 servers come over and say they would be taking care of us. Not like its an issue, the other two must have fell in a hole... it happens :P  It was Friday night we were out with our friends (another couple) and we weren't your typical eyeful of Affliction, short skirts, heels, and swaying from side to side. We work downtown and were shocked none of us had ever eaten here. Came in the hostess was confused and said let her get the booth in front of us clean and its yours. She then said we couldn't take the table without a reservation....then changed her mind again after saying she recognized us. I was already confused.  Fast forward, past the first two servers....the third (poor guy) is new, and they were out of flat-bread, Pinot Noir (one in particular) and the seared ahi. Lucky for him he is at a table of servers and bartenders, we easily chose around it and ordered a feast of small bites: Stuffed mushrooms- 3/5 good but not served very hot  Cheese sticks- 3/5 standard, and again not very hot  Ahi poke- 4/5 they brought this by mistake but hey we didn't know and wow was it good  Caprese - 5/5 this was really a great salad, whatever they marinate their mozzarella balls in is amazing. Also a very nice presentation.  Mini-Bruschetta- 4/5 good presentation, tasty, and pesto is always good.  French dip- I didn't have it but my friend said it was good, he gave it a 4/5  Triple Chocolate Pizookie- OH GOD YES!!!! 5/5 This will make anyone happy :) Well that was my experience, I would love to come here again for some small bites but never again on a Friday night, all their confusion almost gave me a headache."
H C.,"Fountain Valley, CA",0,7,,1.0,4/18/2015,"the service here was absolutely terrible. there was abundant staff but nobody came to help us. I had to wait ten minutes after asking for water, for the waitress to bring it to my table. we ordered the avocado eggrolls (an appetizer, not even an entree) and were left sitting with no service for over 50 minutes. we asked a waiter to check on the time and when we came out of the kitchen he totally avoided us. We then ask the manager what is going on and where our food is (after watching several groups get seated, eat, pay, and leave) he told us he would drop the bill and go check, after an hour of waiting. the food came out looking sloppy and rushed, not only that but burnt????????? we also got a pazookie and had to wait over a half an hour for that as well. this was totally disappointing and completely unprofessional. I have never had such bad service in my life."
Catherine S.,"Eastchester, NY",0,3,,5.0,2/28/2016,"Love coming to BJ's when in Huntington Beach. Food is always fresh and delicious (heads up for the diet conscious: they give you calorie counts on the menu!!). Tons of choices for everyone's taste. The best server is Shane...professional, efficient and friendly. Came back twice on the same trip because of him! Can't wait until our next visit!"
Jess C.,"Sacramento, CA",605,345,427,5.0,5/7/2013,"We got there and got seated immediately. Me and five of my girlfriends sat out on the patio and enjoyed the view! God bless the person who invented the Pizookie! Great service and great food. Ordered the fettuccine Alfredo and a pitcher of the cider beer and was amazed and tipsy by the end. A+++ on service, location, experience and taste."
Tracy N.,"Westminster, CA",87,10,9,5.0,11/22/2013,"Having bday dinner celebration for a friend's husband and the experience is really amazing.  Our waiter, Tony was really outstanding.  He deserves a 10 rating :) the food was real good. We had the ""party for 2"" and let me tell you: it was delicious soup, pizza and pazookie for only $19.95 :). Thank you for the nice dinner :)"
Randy K.,"Huntington Beach, CA",77,74,17,1.0,10/30/2012,"happy hour in the bar this week was terrible,  I just wanted a mini pizza and a salad.  And of course a nice cold beer!  Pizza came out lukewarm, the salad was the end of the lettuce and the beer wasnt cold!  The server tried her best but they were terribly understaffed and she was left to figure out everything on her own.   Management needs to actually visit the customers on the floor and they would realize that the  crowd was slowly loosing faith in them.   WIth SO many options on main street in HB they need to recognize that they are not any better then the rest and need to improve before their business goes across the street."
Tim G.,"Bellevue, WA",20,14,,1.0,9/28/2012,"So Angry!  I will qualify this with a terrible week at work, and a tasty Octoberfest from bjs.  BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE!  Being the Duke of the huntington beach location illustrates how often I come here. I do live 2 blocks away. That said, I will be relinquishing my crown. Here are my reasons, which will all involve food since I've always overlooked the hit and miss servers.  1. They changed the freaking pizza! No longer is it deep dish, but just hand tossed. They got rid of the deep dish tins... This is the biggest WTF moment. This is the reason people come here and makes this place unique. What was management thinking? The servers told me HB was the last holdout for the deepdish tins.  If that's the case, I'm sorry to all the other locations as well. 2. Wheat crust on the veggie pizza is no more. (I'm sure I'm the only one that cares.)  3. They got rid of the oatmeal raisin pizookie!?  So a big FU to the minds at Bj's. Again, I relinquish the crown. Too many other good pizza joints in hb, and bjs just gave up their signature pizza, the ""California deep dish"" in favor of handtossed.   If you're looking for a handtossed pizza in HB, take a look at pizza lounge or Luggattis or papp joes.  Cheaper and better. Bj's deep is no more, and therefor is dead to me."
Sione T.,"Perris, CA",9,24,13,1.0,10/29/2014,"Worst experience ever. Walked in around 10 pm Tuesday 10/28/14. Lady took about 15 minutes just to get our drinks. If I asked for any additional marinara sauce for my calamari, it would take her 10 minutes to to bring that. What makes it worse is that there were only 5 tables to be served. My kid needed a high chair and they couldn't provide until we were half way thru our food. She never once asked me if I wanted a refill nor my wife and kids. I don't even know why I left a tip. First time at a BJ and service was better at a McDonalds. What a shame. Chicken tortilla soup was good. Pizooki was good. Fries and potato wedges was good. Calamari was a bit off. Double deluxe burger tasted like salt was smothered all over smh. Raspberry mixed drink was great. Overall if the service was great I would give it at least 3 1/2 stars but that didn't happen."
Paul S.,"Long Beach, CA",28,606,20,3.0,9/20/2014,"Update. After discussing my situation with the manager, they gave me a gift card for another meal. I have to give them credit for that. So, I'm upgrading the service. Thanks BJ."
Kristie W.,"Upland, CA",4,64,1,3.0,8/23/2013,The bad: food took way too long to come out in a not very full restaurant. Over 35 min for a salad and a mini pizza was way too long.  The good: the food when it did come out was great. My daughter had a mini cheese pizza which is hard to mess up. But I had the seared ahi salad. I've had it at other BJ's and the ahi has been cooked all the way thru. Here it was perfect! Seared and delicious!
Sam E.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,2,,5.0,2/15/2016,"We came here when it was busy and you can tell they were understaffed, but that didn't stop the crew from giving great service, Ed was our server and gave an impeccable experience. Thumbs up guys! Thank you"
Gabi K.,"Costa Mesa, CA",62,54,82,1.0,7/1/2015,"We came here again because we love the food. Big mistake. It took forever to get drinks, not to even mention appetizers (only 40 mins). The whole lunch took 2 hours; which is still kind of ok... The bill took another 20 mins to come....we owed $89... We gave our server Kayla $45 cash and asked her to put the rest on my card... After a while she came to inform me that the card did not go through which i was aware of. I asked her to punch in the number manually which she did and it was ok.... The card went through; i signed and we left. After about an hour i realized the server charged me the whole amount even though we gave her $45 in cash and asked her to only charge the test on the card. I immediately called the restaurant and spoke to the manager Steve who told me it might have been his fault since Kayla did not inform him she previously got $45 in cash. He aslo promised he would call me right after he will resolve my issue. He never called back and i still got charged $89 on my card. Shame on you BJ's.... Keep my $45... You need it more than i do apparently..... Never ever coming back...the worst customer service EVER"
Clif P.,"East Jordan, MI",62,147,5,4.0,4/27/2013,"Good happy hour specials.  They had quite a few TV's and did a good job showing a variety of sports/games. Their beers were tasty.  They tasted more 'commercialized' than other small breweries, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  Their lighter beers were crisp and clean, and I would go back next time I visit Huntington Beach."
Kristina M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",1,106,16,1.0,7/12/2014,We ordered delivery for the 1st time. It took an hour for the food to be delivered at 10pm finally. We only live 1/2 a mile down the street. The food was cold. They forgot part of our order. I have to say we won't be ordering delivery from here again.
