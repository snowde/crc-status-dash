Annette A.,"Palatine, IL",1,7,,3.0,5/8/2014,"First and foremost, the food was fantastic. Maybe it was the 50 minute wait or maybe it was the half a bottle of wine I drank, but everything came out as ordered and delicious. I had the Lemon Thyme Chicken minus the brown rice and sauce. The chicken breast was surprisingly juicy and the veggies were better than your standard veggie side. Brussels sprouts, red onion, tomatoes, broccoli, carrots, etc.  Two others in the group had steaks and someone had a burger, everyone was very pleased. BUT, the service is slow, slow, slow. Literally, it was 50 minutes from the time we were seated before the food came. Ridiculous."
Sushil P.,"Los Angeles, CA",26,50,28,1.0,6/29/2014,"Worst Service Ever. Most disorganized, disoriented restaurant. The wait is always 30-40 minutes, but its never first come first serve, they randomly call and seat anybody with no systematic approach. Even the sitting is way too disoriented and if you do manage to get past all this and finally place an order. It will take forever your food to arrive. Stay away. Even If they were giving meals for free, I would still avoid this place !"
J G.,"Whittier, CA",0,1,,1.0,7/23/2014,"terrible service! I love the laid back feel of HB but not at a restaurant- the employees chatted away amongst each other while I waited for a table (the restaurant was empty) for 20 mins. the front desk girl looked annoyed when I told her I had been waiting and there were several empty tables...The manager was chatting away as well and completely forgot about us. We finally seated ourselves...The waiter never brought out silverwear, condiments and any time we needed anything we needed to flag him down. The food? ok The service was HORRIBLE!"
Katelyn B.,"Huntington Beach, CA",14,24,7,3.0,10/4/2014,"Great pizza, nice choice of appetizers, good lemonade, delicious pizookies but... Not so great of service sometimes."
Jose C.,"Fullerton, CA",104,73,5,5.0,5/11/2013,"Spent over 100$ for 2.. but we ate and we ate ate ate.. We enjoyed every last moment of it, great service, great food, and a great person? What else can someone ask for?"
Denise C.,"Phoenix, AZ",45,96,16,3.0,10/18/2015,"The service was EXCELLENT with a server very attentive to the needs of my children, including timely refills. However the food is just ""meh"" and an overpriced ""meh"" at that. I really wish we had eaten at one of the more eclectic restaurants but our kids just weren't that adventurous so we stuck with a familiar yet mediocre choice. Still, the service couldn't be beat and BJs deserves kudos for that."
Bryan M.,"Moreno Valley, CA",190,17,5,1.0,6/23/2014,I had a trip yesterday to the beach. My girlfriend and I  BJs around our home in Menifee CA but this location in Huntington was HORRIBLE!   Our server was nice but damn was she forgetful.  We had no silverware or napkins during our meal. Luckily my girlfriend had napkins in her purse. We finally finished our food and while I was getting up mup gf told me that her order came with a salad. We reminded the server and 20 minutes later we got the salad! Spinach and dressing doesn't take that long. I didn't even get an apology or a discount or anything.  Such a bad BJs.  Never in my life will I recommend this place.
Matt M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",4,7,3,3.0,6/10/2014,Tuesday night and we waited for 45 min. we went to check on our status and the host told us our name wasn't on the list. We ended up having to seat ourselves on the high top tables where we then Waited for 12 min. to even get spoken to. Service was horrible needless to say. Good food though!
Mitchell H.,"Newport Beach, CA",57,4,,4.0,3/3/2015,Committed IPA is very tasty... The cherry chipotle salmon was done well.  Great location Main Street in HB.... Especially fun on locals night which is every Tuesday...
Demascus S.,"Beverly Hills, CA",58,126,,1.0,2/27/2015,NO No no ...never again. Didn't Hurricanes use to be here? You know things are going downhill for a town when a chain restaurant takes over a hot spot.
Mathew R.,"Newport Beach, CA",134,213,22,4.0,8/26/2012,"We went here for lunch today and sat outside on the patio to eat. I ordered the Ceasar salad. The food came out pretty fast, and considering all the people there it was quite impressive. Our waitress was very nice and made sure everything was good to go. The salad was really good, I added the blackened chick to it and the portion of the salad is just the right size, not over fed at all which a lot of places have been doing this lately. If you sign up for their rewards card you get a free cookie with some ice cream on top as a reward for signing up with them. It's a points related rewards account that you can ask them to give you a physical card, or you can go to their website and sign up as you're waiting for your food is what we did. After the lunch we got the free desert which tasted great. The cookie was Oreo, and it was topped with ice cream and a cookie flavored whipped topping which tasted great! Eating here, and enjoying the nice weather while people watching and having a great conversation with my girlfriend was a perfect little lunch date for us. She ordered a pizza which she then took some home with us for her to much on later. She loved the pizza, and has eaten here before but since I am new to the area I haven't, but glad I did. Try this place out, gorgeous area to eat a nice lunch or dinner in. They also had a brunch menu that you can choose some other food choices that aren't on the regular menu, it's just for Sunday Brunch. The menu looked pretty good but I didn't decide to get anything off the brunch menu this time. The bill for both us came to around 36 dollars, which isn't too bad at all for the food we ate."
Danielle D.,"Irvine, CA",119,329,146,3.0,7/28/2014,"Service is questionable here. I get it's a busy location but come on I shouldn't have to beg for water or a drink. Manager was on top of it hence why he is the manager.., I'll be back if I can't find anywhere else i like the food just wish they had better customer service! They're knew peanut butter s'more pizookie is OMG good though. Beware ! Lol"
Travis J.,"Midtown West, Manhattan, NY",5,2,,4.0,11/24/2014,"The food was great! Service was ok, but the manager was very nice"
Genevieve P.,"Huntington Beach, CA",84,34,2,1.0,4/18/2014,"Normally I really love BJs. We went on a Friday night, not too busy. Got seated fairly quickly. After being seated, sat there for 20 minutes. No acknowledgement, didn't ask for drink order, nothing. So we walked out."
Toddy S.,"Indio, CA",194,32,12,4.0,6/7/2014,"This was the perfect place to grab a drink with an old friend. The staff all welcome us and offered us a table, we opted for the bar where we were again greeted my the friendly bar staff who had great recommendations and had us try some great bjs brew. We didn't even know but it was happy hour! (Always a great surprise) I also had the California club flatbread, I would come back for that alone, definitely work the $4."
Harry S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,7,,1.0,6/16/2012,Loud and stuffy.  They need ceiling fans to move the air when it is warm. The density of this bar far exceeds the ability of the wait staff to adequately keep the customers well attended.
Bill B.,"Tempe, AZ",108,73,12,1.0,1/4/2014,"It's playoffs. Everyone in the bar is here for the football fame. Zero sound. You can't hear the game. The crowd. The calls. Nothing. We asked (along with many others) three times to turn volume on - and the final response is that there is a law (a BJs law) against sound. It's apparently a ""restaurant and not a sports bar"".  Then take the TVs down because you are misrepresenting yourself!  Too late to move to another bar now and find a seat....or we would leave!"
Christine S.,"Monterey, CA",12,10,,2.0,5/7/2012,"They only get a second star because my friend really liked his meal. I've heard nothing but rave reviews about this place and my friend loves it. I took him to dinner here last night and he went crazy over the Caesar Salad with Salmon. I got a Rib Eye and requested it to be cooked medium rare - it came out almost completely burnt. It reminded me of the crappy steaks I got at Sizzler as a kid for 9.95 (only I paid nearly $20 for this disappointment). The side of mashed potatoes was marginal at best, it had to be flakes because I've never seen potatoes that white, naturally. The skewered shrimp was way overcooked to the point of rubbery and they waited until the end of the meal to refill my water, even though I asked at least a half dozen times, throughout the hour I was there to get it filled. My friend also ordered rolls that came out after he finished his salad.  We sat outside and the heater we were next to was turned off, we kept telling the staff that it was off and they insisted it was on (without actually looking up to check) and finally a busboy helped us turn it on so that we weren't freezing during the whole meal. The waiter kept apologizing for forgetting so much stuff and being inattentive, but I still had to pay the full bill. Quit apologizing for bad service and do something about it instead. My experience was abysmal and they weren't that busy, none of this should have occurred. I will never return to this establishment. They screwed up too much."
Ian A.,"Costa Mesa, CA",6,23,4,4.0,11/28/2012,"Love love love the root beer!! Its perfect and not all ofthe BJ's serve it. I remember this place before they remodeled/expanded it. Night and day difference. It gets crowded and noisy but, IT'S A SPORTS BAR IN DOWNTOWN HB, WHAT DO U EXPECT?? Seating can take a bit of time in the summer, but I've never ha to wait more than 20min with a group of 4-6 of us so of youre in a bigger hurry than that, you probably should get out of downtown HB to get some food. ;) It's not perfect, but the food is great, the waiters are all friendly and helpful, and the newer item menus are excellent healthy options."
Doug M.,"Newport Beach, CA",8,16,2,1.0,7/20/2015,"Poor food quality, also serviced a dish missing the avocado & onion strings had to request it , the wedge salad poor too. DO  NOT recommended this location."
