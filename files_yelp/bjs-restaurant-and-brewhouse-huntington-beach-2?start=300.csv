Esther L.,"Long Beach, CA",662,253,81,4.0,4/10/2014,"Great late night happy hour specials.  Came here with one of my girlfriends to have some wine & munchies.  Forgot what Chardonnay we got, but it tasted good & was 50% off :). For munchies we got mini deep dish pizza (good), Southwest egg rolls (loved these!  Banging flavor, perfect amount of crisp & loved the sauces that accompanied them), and chicken lettuce wraps (just ok).  All the food was half off too.  The bill came out to be $40 with 4 glasses of wine & the food.  Whatta deal!   The service was amazing as well!"
Monkean M.,"Berwyn, IL",0,86,,4.0,4/25/2014,"We went to BJ's for lunch while vacationing in the area. My wife had a veggie burger, I had a spicy burger and my daughter had the gluten free pizza. We dined outside on a brisk day. The service was good and they understood the need to be careful when preparing a gluten free meal. Overall solid effort on the food. Nice atmosphere on a beautiful day. Would come back again."
S O.,"Irvine, CA",1,32,,3.0,7/11/2015,"My family and I stopped by for a late evening snack on a weekday.  Restaurant was full, but wait was minimal.  Ordered tavern cut Italian Market pizza -- very tasty.  Crust was thin and crispy and meat and toppings were delicious.  Also shared a triple chocolate Pizookie made with Ghirardelli ice cream -- very excellent!  Service was friendly and attentive, but servers seemed harried and exhausted.  Plates were dirty, but were replaced with clean ones.  Please be forewarned that the noise level of this location is very loud -- in the heart of touristy downtown Huntington Beach."
Beneta P.,"Cypress, CA",200,175,103,3.0,6/20/2012,The food is A-OK is like every other chain Restaurant. They get their stars because of great customer service and beer not food much.
Peter Y.,"Garden Grove, CA",165,22,1,1.0,8/28/2013,"Man where do I start with this place? The food? It's BJ's, what do you expect? The Staff? Unfriendly, unwelcoming, and undeserving of minimum wage. The management? Incompetent.  Overall? Be glad I gave you one star, and against my will, at that. I called in an order one night, it was specifically 3 large pizookies. Not that difficult right? After telling me on the phone it would be ready in about 20 minutes, I ambled on down from the beach bonfire that I was at to go pick up the pizookies. Now mind you, this beach bonfire was for my friend's birthday, and we all forgot to buy a cake so we decided to get some pizookies as an alternative. After reaching BJ's, I walk up to the hostess bar and tell them my situation and they look through some receipts(?) looking for my order. They just kind of stammer and say it will be a couple more minutes. Uh, ok, sure, I came about 10 minutes later than you advised to avoid exactly this, but it's not a problem. So I'm standing there against the wall watching T.V. because I left my phone back at the beach, thinking it would only take 10 minutes, MAX. 20 minutes go by and nothing. I go up to the hostess bar and ask how much longer it would take and they give me a vague response full of excuses, ""The kitchen is busy,"" ""The pizookies are being baked fresh,"" ""It's coming right out."" Ok, I'll wait a little longer. I waited about 25 minutes, plus the added 25 minutes they told me it would take over the phone, it can't take that much longer right? WRONG. To make a long story short, I waited a little over 2 hours for my order to come out. By that time I was visibly steaming. Turns out they forgot my order, put in an order, gave my order to the wrong customers (what, is it that difficult to verify a NAME on an order?) and after all that decided to have me just wait there instead of doing anything about it. Now I understand mistakes are a part of human nature, and I'm willing to forgive them for my time wasted. But the thing that really set me off was the way they all tried to play it off like it wasn't a big deal and that I was blowing it out of proportion. Management came out and explained all the errors that happened with my order and asked if I would pay with a Visa or mastercard. Wow.  Take your business elsewhere, this chain restaurant is the model of everything that's wrong with chain restaurants."
Vanessa H.,"Bakersfield, CA",298,987,78,3.0,9/1/2011,"This is the smallest BJ's I have ever seen! Azya C. and I stopped by here to pre-party before the Yelp Elite Event at 2nd Floor, and we grabbed a pear cider (of course) and a couple of appetizers. She got the potstickers, which she found to be a little gummy and undercooked. I got the Mac N Cheese small plate, which was made with rotini (yay!) but in a really soupy sauce (boo!). The taste was there, but the preparation and the presentation are both somewhat lacking. Still, it's a good place to grab a pint before heading to a better spot."
Sylvia T.,"Arcadia, CA",39,7,7,1.0,10/25/2013,"Waited over fifteen minutes for a server to come by and take drink orders.  The food was ok.  Ordered the tomatoes and mozzarella, meatballs, Mac and cheese and stuffed mushrooms.  Mac and cheese was bland, stuffed mushrooms were ok.  Meatballs were flavorful but the best was the mozzarella and tomatoes."
Morgan B.,"Mission Viejo, CA",2,5,,5.0,2/16/2014,"After a morning workout at Huntington Beach, stopped by Main Street for my breakfast options. To my surprise, BJ's was open for breakfast. Enjoyed a great breakfast, had the french toast and bacon. Bacon was nice and crispy, the french toast was fluffy and the syrup was great. Service was great and staff was very friendly. Can't wait to come back!"
Paul A.,"Anaheim, CA",394,1075,513,3.0,11/13/2011,"It may be confuisng that I give high star ratings and bad reviews, but I know that these places are hit or miss and this is usually a hit! When I take my ""starving"" kids to a restaurant I always grab an appetizer out of the gate- app and drinks came quick, but then our order either got lost or somebody was learning to cook and time orders, because they sucked at both. My dad and I both order rare burgers-this should be easy and we ordered a half pepperoni half cheese and our waiter took the time to ask if wanted the tomatoes on top which is how it comes- he knew our kids would probably not like it- good call. after about halfan hour - i asked him ""whats up with our food"" and he knew there was a problem and said ""yeah I'll go check"" who knows what happened, but they brought us dry over cooked burgers(maybe they had been sitting for 28 minutes) and a room temperature pizza- with tomatoes...it was a shame, because BJ's happy hour is awesome- but my last two eating visits have been F visits- my last visit at the Laguna Hills location had a hair in my cobb salad.  They comp the food, but all I want is a good order, because waiving the 14 or 15 bucks doesn't make it a great experience."
AllieBree M.,"Lakewood, CA",53,17,10,1.0,7/12/2011,"I love Bjs, and eat there regularly, but this particular location I WON'T be returning to. Me and my bf and a few of our friends went to Main St to catch up and eat so we decided on BJs. First of all we asked if the happy hour was the whole restaurant or the bar. The hostess said bar AREA, which usually the tables around the bar in that specific area are included. So we sat in a booth right by the bar.  Our waitress came to get our order and we put in a few drinks, when she came back we asked again what the happy hour specials were, she said they were bar only, and we asked what tables then we could sit in, she pointed to the tall tables litereally 2 feet away from us. We offered to switch but she said it was okay she would acknowledge the happy hour for us, just that the first round of drinks would be normal priced but from then on would be happy hour prices. We were fine with that.  So we ordered the mini pizzas which she CLEARLY gave us the happy hour price on when we ordered and asked, and a few more drinks.  The check came with everything FULL price so of course we brought it to her attention, she said she never said such a thing or said she would actually do it, just that we were not in the tables for happy hour. WTF?! yeah we made it up, she clearly told us what she told us and kept denying it saying she didnt tell us that. so we got a manager. All he could do was give us 10% off the check because the order was already in the system and could not acknowledge the happy hour because she already put it in.  pffffftttt, we were beyond pissed off especially since we were being told we pretty much made up the story by a stupid waitress.  horrible customer service and not even a free pazookie to make up for it!! so much for the customers always right.."
Yarong L.,"San Gabriel, CA",1,5,,4.0,6/7/2014,"It's a very nice place nearby Hungtington Beach. We sit outsise and look the nice street view. The strawberry lemonade hasreal strawberry, I like that. The breakfast open 8am to 1pm on Saturday and Sundy."
Pinnacle T.,"Huntington Beach, CA",36,236,64,3.0,6/4/2014,"Although we made a reservation for 6 on a Wednesday night, it took about 45 minutes to be seated. The service was pretty good, which means our beverages were refreshed several times over the course of our meal. I ordered the bison burger and it was above average. The salad that came on the plate with my burger, however, was atrocious. It looked like that crappy salad mix you might buy at Walmart."
Dat D.,"Huntington Beach, CA",199,46,5,2.0,11/5/2013,"Terrible service, we had three different servers and no one is communicating with each other on the orders.  Food is decent, once it arrives.  Sit at the bar for improved service."
Chris B.,"Costa Mesa, CA",86,436,516,5.0,9/23/2011,"Mmm, BJ's.......this will be a different review for me. Usually the amount of stars someone receives is directly related to the service or quality I receive. Never have I rated a restaurant so highly that didn't properly cook my dish. Read on. So, I ate at a BJ's once. Probably about 6 or 7 years ago. I don't recall it standing out much. But I was walking from my house to downtown HB the other night to eat....we didn't have any particular restaurant in mind....just kinda aimlessly wandering....till something presented itself.  Well, I've walked by the BJ's a million times....never wanted to try it....had kind of a ""been there, done that"" attitude about it. And my girlfriend says, ""Lets try BJ's""......... Hmmmmm Ok, lets go in. We were pretty much seated immediately even though it was pretty crowded as per the usual. Waiter came over.....very friendly....ordered a garlic bread hamburger and a dinner salad with Blu Cheese. The girlfriend ordered a Calzone.  The salad arrived and I immediately noticed the blu cheese tasted funny...maybe a little too sweet.......not normal blu cheese at all. My girlfriend agreed. But it was edible.  The waiter was very attentive, stopping by several times to make sure everything was ok......when he asked about the salad, I told him it tasted a little funny. Not BAD.....just not that good.  He immediately offered to make another.....but I told him no.........it was necessary.....it wasn't THAT big of a deal. Then he offered to take it off the bill.............but again.....since we'd eaten most of it I told him that no....that's not what I was looking for .......but thanks for the offer.  The entree's arrived and we dug in.  Everything was good.....but something wasn't ""right'........Hmmmm then it hit me.....my burger wasn't hot. It was just barely warm.....as were the fries.  Hmmmm, then my girlfriend commented her calzone was good....but not hot either. I tried a bit.....and yep....just warm.  Oh well....took another bite....then she commented.....""Cazone is like pizza, it's supposed to be too hot to eat the first couple minutes...""  She was right.....it's supposed to release steam when you cut it open....what the heck? this was warm like....ordered it to go.....drove over picked it up..brought it home and took it out of the box 30 minutes after it came out of the oven warm.  So here comes our happy, helpful, cheery waiter..... ""Hows everything?"" So while my girlfriend didn't want to be a bother......I simply asked, ""my burgers not hot.....can you nuke it for a minute for me?""   He immediately asked if I wanted him to have a new burger made.....""No, I just want it warmed up."" It was a delish burger....just not hot..... So he took my plate and my girlfriend continued on with her calzone. He stopped by a moment later and said he asked the manager to stop by........Uh oh.....now I'm in trouble.  So the manager stops by,  ""I hear your burger wasn't cooked properly?"" ""No, it was fine.....just not hot....I asked him to warm it up. And my girlfriends calzone wasn't hot either"" ""Well, I'm having the kitchen cook you a new hamburger"" "" I apologize for it not being hot.....and I'll take the calzone off the bill"" ""We want to make SURE you are completely satisfied with your food and service here""  Whoa I just wanted it nuked.  But then I thought about it.....wow, WHEN was the last time I had a manager come over like that?  I know when a server asks ""How is everything?"" They don't REALLY care.....they're just being (usually) polite.  But I still somehow think.....that when I mention (and NOT asking for replacement or anything) that the hollandaise is too lemony or the eggs should be runny or the blu cheese isn't right.....that maybe they'll go back and tell the cook.......""hey, someone mentioned this and you should check it out....."" that maybe it's constructive criticism and just might be helpful. Now I know that may not be true most of the time....but as a business owner I'D want to know....so.... The burger comes back......nice and hot.....it really is a very good burger....everything's good (cept I'm eating by myself, the girlfriend having already finished) The waiter comes and drops off the bill......and not only did the manager take off the calzone but he took off the burger as well.  Wow!  So he essentially took what would have been a really disappointing meal and turned it totally around and made up for it and then some. If it had been ""business as usual"" like EVERY other time you have a disappointment during a meal.....I likely would have never walked in a  BJ's again.  But now as a result of the extraordinary attention the manager paid to my experience there.....I'm looking forward to going back.  Other restaurants take notice......see how that works?"
Hugo I.,"Hanford, CA",0,6,,2.0,8/3/2014,"Had lunch here on a very busy weekend during a surfing event. The service was quite fast. By the way thank you to the manager who told a guy in the restaurant to put on his shirt. Nobody wants to eat in front of a hairy guy. The classic burger I ordered was just ""ok"". It had no flavor and lacked seasoning and sauce/spread. Must not be a burger place."
Jenny N.,"Huntington Beach, CA",236,49,3,1.0,6/25/2013,"So it was my first time here and I was definitely not impressed whatsoever.  Some of the workers were just standing around laughing and doing nothing productive.  My friends and I ordered and it took the longest time for the waiter to bring out our food. We only ordered a medium pizza.. We asked for water with lemon, and they forgot to bring out our lemon.. It's not that hard to cut some lemon up and bring it to your customers.  Afterwards, we ordered 3 mini pizookies and that still took quite a long time, and our ice cream was all melted.. So what I thought was..,'it doesn't take ice cream to melt that fast when it's being walked over and the cookie is just a little warm.. right? Or am I wrong? THEN, I accidentally dropped my spoon, asked this random waitress to get me another one POLITELY, and this girl NEVER came back with a new spoon.. HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO EAT MY DESSERT? UGH.  Anyway, my overall experience here sucked, but the only exception for this place for deserving a single star is the pizookie, since the delicious cookie was baked to perfection.  TIP FOR THE WAITER: If you wanted a better tip, then maybe you should be WAITING on your customers, that's why you're a WAITer, right?"
Sylvia C.,"Fullerton, CA",0,15,,1.0,7/24/2014,Service is horrible!! Wasn't even that busy we got sat right when we walked in took 20 mins to get a server then when we got our food 30 mins later!  We asked the girl for more refills on our waters an asked for napkins an she rolls her eyes an says she will get our server to do it!! What the F!!!!  She Such horrible attitudes shitty service.  Never coming back  ill take my business elsewhere
Melissa G.,"Santa Ana, CA",1,29,,2.0,5/3/2015,the service was great but the food was mediocre. ive had better broccoli cheddar soup & better pizza. my bf & i came here bc we wanted quality food. this was really a waste of time and money.
G W.,"Fountain Valley, CA",205,8,,1.0,6/7/2013,"I was sitting at the bar... I was told per the manager to keep my voice down at 10:30 pm on Saturday night,  I had used the  word ""Bitches"" to my friends a few times. really... Others have used the word as well.  Yet I was told to keep it down???? Was it because I was not caucasian?? I am better off going some elsewhere... Too many other restaurants to put up with that.... Too bad, the bartenders was cool... Get rid of the manager and maybe we will go back!!!"
Whitney M.,"Fullerton, CA",49,8,3,3.0,3/15/2014,"Came here for a small lunch. This is an extremely busy place but that is to be expected since it is on Main St. in Huntington Beach. We sat at the bar since outside and inside had a 10 minute wait. We order the Pepperoni extreme flatbread appetizer pizza and the fresh mozzarella and tomato salad. The wait to get these items was at a least 20 minutes. Once we got them, they were both very good and appetizing. The waiter,John D., was very good and attentive."
