J C.,"Highland, CA",1,33,2,1.0,4/22/2011,"You've gotta work hard to get 1 star, and these clowns really put in the consistent extra effort.   First, yes the service is that bad.  Be it the incompetence, disinterest, or attitude it's all too true.  Don't expect the ""management"" or should i say mismanagement to help any either.  Tried this place on a few occasions and ok, places get swamped and things can fall off once in a while but this is a trend here, not an exception.  Read around the reviews and the pattern is clear.  The owners are lucky that there's a constant flow of tourists and visitors to the area to keep this joke going.  I don't know about you but if I read about the sort of crap that so many have remarked about here on yelp and other review sites, I'd close shop for a week and exterminate the vermin responsible for ruining what should be a solid business model. Gotta give props to the beer selection and a few of their bartenders- they realize they need to work for a living at least.  The food is, let's face it, chain fare which is only average at the best of times but you can't knock it for being what it is if you knew about that in the first place.  ON the other hand you can hit up a drive thru Pizza Hut, save a lot of $$$ and aggravation and be just as grease bloated later.  Again, food isn't the real problem here per se. Why do this to yourself or your so called friends when there are all kinds of superior alternatives to this planned community chain strip mall abortion of a restaurant located in a prime main st location?  It needs to be torn down and buried in Irvine somewhere and something useful put in its place.  There are dozens of great alternatives on and off main st - Cafe Alessa or Lugatti's on 5th (reopened recently thank god!) are both solid bets with none of the bullshit attitude staff and mediocre food.  Trust me on this one, you won't be disappointed!  Or you most likely will be if you don't...  Invest your time and money better elsewhere."
Naty M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,3,,1.0,7/6/2015,"Ok I really hate writing reviews but this one is just to funny to not share! So I sit down about 5 min later my waitress comes by and asks for a drink order now I must say my waitress was very accommodating to us in the beginning but it seemed as time went on it just became a downward spiral so I went to the restroom and when I came back they had already cleared outer table and sat a family, I come out confused and the hostess comes up to me and very rudely asks me can I help u? Yes I would like my appetizers that I didn't finish yet and my table lol ok so whatever I sit back down not to mention it's been about 45 min into the experience so now I'm sitting there after about 20 min I ask the waitress if our food is ready she's says she doesn't know and will check now keep in mind that I've already seen about 4 tables come and go and she was happily taking food out to there table so about 10 min later our food comes out my bread is rock hard and my daughters marinara is starting to turn dark red and the edges around the pasta is dried up clearly this has been sitting in the window for a very long time I ask the waitress about it ok so I resort to eating it in fear of being held hostage there for another 30 min to get my food so she tells me a pizookie is on the house wow thanks I totally wouldn't rather get a quality meal, so bacon was only on half of my whole sandwich so then right she asks me if I'm ready for dessert another 20 min yes 20 min then she's like I comped ur sandwich! She I guess was to busy to bring us our bill I literally handed the other waitress my card right away in fear I was about to spend another 30 min just for her to swipe my card All in all I really like eating here but it's like the last time I ordered shrimp tacos and they gave me one mahi  one shrimp it's like get it together! One word of advice please do better next time I would much rather pay for my meal and enjoy myself then to have it comped and just be like oh it's ok we comped her meal quality and customers are everything!"
Tim K.,"Huntington Beach, CA",31,28,2,4.0,10/18/2013,"I live in Downtown HB, last week we made the news again when and oil rig partially collapsed knocking power out for hours. So i went to BJ's to watch the Monday night football game as well as the Dodger playoff game. I got center seat at the bar and it was great. The staff there is awesome i applaud them for their service however the price for Stella Artois was $6.50 for a regular size glass, wow that is crazy when I can buy a 3 pack of Bud light 24 oz cans for less than that. I really felt that was too expensive my experience service was is what get the 4 stars and the ambiance as far as the TV's and games but wow if you want your wallet to take a beating go to the bar otherwise beware of the beer prices they'll getcha"
Eric N.,"Cupertino, CA",57,7,,3.0,8/13/2011,"First off, my family had quite a large party for my cousin's birthday so we called a few days before and made sure they had us down for 4pm - 13 guests. Well low and behold... we get to the hostess and she tells us there is no such reservation and is sure we made it for the wrong BJ's. Well good uncle that he was, recited the manager's name as well as the address and that stuck it to her. After that small debacle, we were seated about 10 minutes later in what looked to be a very shiestily put together set of 3 tables in the back room. These chairs even after they were scooted in were about 5 inches away from the adjacent tables with people sitting at them. Not comfy at all. Well our families asked for separate checks and the waitress didn't mind splitting up the already ordered drinks so props to her. All in all the food was pretty good... pulled pork sandwich, spinach and artichoke dip, buffalo wings (With ranch sans blue cheese), and buffalo chicken pizzas for our half of the family. The food came relatively quick considering a party of 13 people and all the food coming out at once, so thanks again there. We then proceeded to order dessert, delicious pazookies (one large platter for the larger half of the family and a small cookies n' creme for my sister and I to share). That was great as well... And.. the reason they lost a second star was due to the 15-20 minute wait after getting the bill to take our cards to be processed. We had immediately put them in, when we received the check, so I'm not sure why the hostess who by the way was right next to us at the computer half the time didn't see... oh well.  All in all a decent experiencing minus the initial trouble... we don't appreciate being called liars by the girl up front. I'd rather go to the other Huntington Beach BJ's with way more room, and also quieter atmosphere with better service (Beach Blvd / Edinger)"
Jeremy C.,"Chicago, IL",63,336,1,4.0,1/28/2012,"I've gone to this BJ's for years. They've certainly remodeled it to look like all the other BJ's. You CANNOT beat their lunch specials. Such a great value. Super delish cheap small plates. I know all you haters hate chains but this one is really legit. I wish they would make it out here to Chicago!!!! I would give my left arm for access to a BJ's California Burger on a regular basis. Well not MY left arm, possibly somebody else's left arm would be better.  BJ's pizza's are great but I would stay away from the wheat crust. Come on... Seriously... You're eating pizza.. If you get the wheat crust you will say to yourself... ""I should have got the regular crust."" Don't be that guy.."
Robert Q.,"Redondo Beach, CA",314,245,281,4.0,11/7/2011,"As much as I HATE huge chain restaurants for their quality of food and creativity in menus, BJs always proves me wrong.  I love this location first off.  Always try to sit outside and you can people watch HBs best and worse while having lunch.   Their house brewed beers are awesome and at $3 they are a steal.  Soup and salad is bottomless and is pretty decent, tho salty.   They made me and off the menu fried fish sandwich, which i thought was not only very accommodating of them, also quite good.  Most of their menu is good, I'd say just go for it! RUMPELSTILTSKIN!!"
Donald S.,"Newport Beach, CA",590,448,25,2.0,2/2/2011,"BJ's Brewery Where do I start...it is so very hard to come up with a review about a place named BJ's without making a slip of the tongue...you know, gagging on the grammar. I need to get my head into this review, or I'm going to blow it! I guess I'll just have to take a stab at it and see what the reading public can swallow! The Beautiful Carin and I dropped by the Hawaiian wedding Yelp event at Don the Beachcomber's last night, dropped off our donation and tried to make a little small talk with people (new to Yelp in this part of the world). I was the oldest person in the room by about 20 years...not too many people interested in chit-chatting with the new/old guy...oh well. We headed back down the road and came across the little farmers market and street fair in Huntington Beach (Official Motto - ""The Portland, Oregon of Southern California""). We decided to stop by, since we didn't stay for the dinner at the Yelp event...and I am so glad we did! Main Street in HB is fun little spot for a bite and people watching...esp. during this little saturnalia! I have never before seen this many people congregated in one spot...both buying healthy, organic and locally sourced fresh food...and chain smoking cigarettes! What a delightful, yet haunting contrast. We dropped by the aforementioned BJ's (Official Motto - ""No, we didn't know what that meant when we named it"") and had bowl of soup and a chili-burger...it took us 90 minutes to have this little repast. The service was (how shall I put this)...uneven. We were seated and we waited...and waited...and then...we waited. Finally, our waiter showed up with the explanation that some people called in sick (probably smoking related) and they were short handed...but he was nice and the place was nice enough, so we thought we were in no hurry. That turned out to be a good attitude to bring! While the food was OK, everyone was nice and just as sorry for the delays as could be, etc...that turned out to be the theme...forgotten utensils, forgotten drink orders, incorrect food orders and apologies. ""Oop's"" and an apology...doesn't that pretty much sum up BJ's? They did offer us a free cookie to make up for the troubles, and it was OK...white chocolate macadamia nut cookie...all warm, white, thick, gooey and sticky. What...you didn't think I was going to let this little review end without another shot at a double entendre, did you? Two stars for this sloppy BJ."
Ashley S.,"Los Angeles, CA",79,156,32,2.0,6/3/2013,"The good: They take reservations for groups (I think more than 6?), which is really nice on crowded days. It's also just a couple of blocks from the pier, which I loved. And it's BJ's so the food is good! The Not so good: While I loved the location, that was about it. They do validate parking, but the parking is pretty bad since it is by the beach. Also, the service was...interesting. I had a fly in my drink and thought it was very noticeable but it was brushed off as not being a big deal. I then ordered a cheese pizza. However, the waiter thought I said 5 meat. So, the serve brought out the pizza and I said it wasn't mine. He then went to the back and brought it out and said it was mine and brought the waiter out to tell me it was mine. I told him what I ordered and he said that item didn't exist  (I saw it on there and have gotten it at other BJs in the past). After telling him I saw it on the menu, he left a little frustrated and carless and came back to tell me it would be out soon. When it did come out it wasn't good very well.  It is also very, very loud so you can't hear what someone is saying unless they are next to you. I give it 2 stars because I was with a medium sized party and people make mistakes. Also the rest of my part liked their food and didn't have any problems. I just don't like being told I'm wrong multiple times when I say I saw something on the menu. Although the problems were quietly brushed over, my meal was comped. I laughed it off and it was fine, but I will probably choose a different BJs in the future unless I am near the beach."
Kim H.,"Buena Park, CA",0,21,,1.0,3/29/2015,Terrible terrible service with out waitress Michael he was rude to my transsexual friend so inappropriate sad that ppl are still that way. But then we were welcomed by an amazing josh that took care of everything he was amazing!
Lesia M.,"Kansas City, MO",6,62,2,5.0,3/28/2015,"Everything was absolutely perfect and delish, Laura was our server and she is by far the best waitress we have ever had! She was friendly and attentive. No detail went unnoticed.we ordered calimari which was tender and cooked to perfection ,BBQ wings were saucy, Santa Fe salad was loaded with fresh corn avacados,grilled chicken, tomatoes. Tavern style pizza tomato/ basil was crispy and tasty. The strawberry lemonade was perfectly balanced a little sweet, a little tart, refreshing and Laura kept the refills coming. There were plants of other options on the menu that looked enticing! U need to go here and bring the family"
Paige S.,"Long Beach, CA",0,6,5,4.0,2/18/2016,"So my boyfriend and I went here last night for a dinner date, sort of a late Valentines Day since we both are so busy. I'm so happy they stay open late. It wasn't busy at all since it was raining and a Wednesday so we got our food quickly and excellent customer service. Our server was Kalen (Sorry if I spelled it wrong!) She was so sweet and extremely attentive to our needs. I'm an extremely picky eater and always modify my meals and she didn't give me any flack because of it. I ordered the potato skins with no sour cream no ranch dressing and she brought me blue cheese instead without me asking her! I love blue cheese and had ordered my entree with a lot of blue cheese and she thought I would like the dressing to go along with my potato skins. GOOD CALL! So amazing! Over all our experience was top notch. I took off one star because the food was just mediocre but I don't blame that on the workers, it's what happens when you eat at chain restaurants like this. I wouldn't mind coming here again as long as Kalen is my server."
Essam D.,"Anaheim, CA",2,5,,4.0,6/12/2014,I was her on the Main street I smell very nice cook  so I decided to go eating some pizza when I order a pizza it's come very fast and it was very delicious me and my friend was happy to eat it I want to say to everybody there is a place on Main Street is very good on pizza
Pim L.,"Garden Grove, CA",203,104,31,4.0,1/11/2011,"Deep dish pizza is my kryponite, making me weak and tired after I eat it. Bj's Pizza the way I want it, how I want it.   Bj's never disappoints me, especially if they do my pizza right and get me my crushed red pepper, ranch and honey mustard in time.  Four stars everytime!"
Thomas R.,"Happy Valley, OR",0,18,,4.0,5/29/2015,Dog friendly on the patio!  Great food and atmosphere.
Clemens K.,"Westchester / LAX, Los Angeles, CA",0,7,,4.0,4/5/2015,"Had a burger, my colleage a steak. both are well done. The waitress was perfect engaged and super friendly and the food was delicious. Recommend this for all who like to seat outside, like HB (its not so silent, more noisy) and like it close to the beach."
Cat N.,"Orange County, CA",4271,1319,5866,4.0,12/25/2010,"everywhere was closed early christmas eve so we decided to drop in here their hours for christmas eve stated that they close at 11 and we showed up at 10.  They were really nice to seat us and did not rush us.  We ordered calamari to start off with and shared a pizza between all three of us girls.  one of my girlfriends also ordered a mixed drink and it turned out to be super super strong.  the calamari was a little over cooked but still good.  the bbq chicken pizza was very good.  although we didnt leave til 11:45, the staff was really nice.   overall, i had an awesome time chatting it up comfortably here.  The food was all good and the service was excellent.  the waiter also helped us take some photos since we dont see each other often.  good times at bjs..."
Lydia K.,"Anaheim, CA",104,109,193,4.0,9/16/2011,"I don't get all the bad reviews. Every time I've been here, never had to wait really for a table. Service is friendly and I love their deep dish pizzas! In fact, there happy hour deals aren't so bad. $1 off beers/ cocktails, $2 off their appetizer menu and half off on their mini pizzas. Gotta try the BBQ chicken!!!  Parking wise, it can be a bit difficult. If it's a block to two away, most likely it's metered parking and if you don't mind walking... around 6 ave and further, parking are meter free! Hope this helps."
Andy G.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",57,85,14,5.0,11/11/2013,"We came on last Saturday with a large group. Big thank you to the manager and our server! We had reservations for 14 , but that grew to maybe 20. They quickly accommodated us, kept our glasses full and the food came quickly. I had the California chicken sandwich and it was real tasty with fresh avocado. I have two trips to HB in December and will be back for a beer , only bummer, they were out of their IPA."
Angie S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",20,8,3,2.0,5/5/2013,"Went there with a friend today after hearing about their lunch specials was greeted by a nice host who was wearing a cast though I didn't catch his name he was very nice. Our server came several minutes afterwards and we wanted to order right away. My friend asked for her usual and the server said she couldn't get that at lunchtime so she had to change her order to a flatbread with salad and I got a personal pizza with soup. I received my soup about 20 minutes before my friend got her food and never got refills horrible service!!!! When the food runner came with my soup I asked him to check on her salad an he explained it came with her meal even though she preferred it before our food like I did with my soup. When we finally got our food after waiting for 25 minutes after I got my soup which is ridiculous with how slow the restaurant was my bacon pizza had barely any bacon on it, so the nice food runner got me more bacon without my asking. We asked his name because he was the only one in the whole resteraunt who took care of us and it was Hugo.  Hugo then refilled our drinks while the waitress was out of sight. She never checked back and then finally dropped off our check. I never got her name because bjs employees don't wear name tags, but I wish I would have. The manager asked the other table how they were doing, but never asked with us, which was also disappointing."
Jim N.,"Huntington Beach, CA",5,15,,2.0,4/4/2013,"Long wait for beer/food, seems understaffed. Food was ok, IPA not so much. If you want better service there are better places on Main."
