Lisa L.,"Phoenix, AZ",60,22,32,3.0,2/2/2014,"I would have given this place 5 stars cause the bar last was awesome and beers are great.....but....when I flagged the buss boy down for a water...he asked me...""Yeah...what do you want?"" Seriously....he needs to be taught some manners or be fired."
Janet B.,"San Diego, CA",113,50,14,3.0,8/5/2011,We went here as a group of seven for dessert and ordered a gigantic pizookie with ice cream.  It was hot and delicious.  For just $20 for dessert for 7 people I'd say it was a pretty good bargain!   One thing to note is this place is extremely loud.  We were there after 10pm on a Thursday night and it was pretty crowded and very loud.  You have to yell very loudly just to be heard by the person sitting next to you.  Beware that you might have a scratchy throat by the end of the night...  I'm only rating this place 3-stars because the staff all seemed to have attitude from the bus boy to the server - no one seemed very happy that we were there and that we were crowded around a table at the bar.  We really were no trouble.  We just ate our pizookie and left quickly.  Thanks for the yummy dessert but no thanks for the attitude!
Valentin J.,"Huntington Beach, CA",72,19,2,1.0,2/25/2013,"""I've gone to many BJs and had great experience. But this time it wasn't a good one. I've seen them have there stuff together but I'm sorry to say they let me down. Won't be Bach till they get there things together."""
William S.,"Sacramento, CA",0,13,1,4.0,1/20/2014,Great BJ's!  Wife and I come for lunch during the week....always good service and friendly staff! Food is hot and tasty. Nice location and atmosphere for lunch or dinner. Love the beer menu!
JacqueLin O.,"Long Beach, CA",343,189,138,2.0,9/20/2010,"This past weekend, I was in HB getting my hair done by the LOVELY Thao at One Stop. My appointment was at the crack of dawn, and I figured since I was in the area I might as well visit main street and meet up with some of my friends who live in HB.  We decided we wanted to get breakfast/brunch on main street. We were shocked how packed it was at 10:00 am, so we decided we'd try BJ's weekend brunch. I had seen signs and I was curious.  It wasn't the nicest day in HB. There was overcast and it wasn't very warm out yet.  The place was empty, and there was this group of people standing in the front waiting, the waiters/hosts seemed really confused and unorganized. Two different ones came in to sit us, and it seemed really out of order. I decided we should sit inside because it was chilly and even though the host tried to entice us by saying there was ""heated patio"" I shook my head and we went inside.  The guy who gave us the menus neglected to give us the breakfast menus, so at first we thought maybe they didn't serve breakfast or something. Another employee came over and we asked for the breakfast menu. It wasn't a huge variety, I'd say maybe under 10 menu options. I was pretty hungry at this point, so mostly everything looked somewhat interesting. I decided to get the steel cut oats and a side of eggs. I didn't care to be TOO adventurous, I just wanted to eat.  My friend ordered an Italian sausage omelet. We both ordered coffees and water. After we ordered, my friend immediately noticed that the waiter didn't ask us what kind of toast we wanted, or what kind of meat we wanted. We hoped this wouldn't determine the rest of our experience there.  It was SO cold in the restaurant, my coffee wasn't staying warm for longer than a few moments. Our food was brought out and it looked good, but sure enough, the toast was white our sourdough and BOTH of us wanted wheat. The person who brought out our food wasn't' the same person who took our order, so I asked him if I could have wheat toast instead.  I could feel huge gusts of cold air, and it bothered me because I knew my food would get cold quickly. The oats were mediocre. They came with milk, brown sugar, and some mixed dried fruit. They weren't piping hot and with the AC on and windows opened, they had NO chance.  The waiter didn't ask us if we wanted hot sauce or ketchup and the food was SO bland, it was necessary. By the time I got to my eggs they were cold, hard and rubbery. I was VERY disappointed. We actually had to flag down a guy because our waiter was no where to be found to ask for hot sauce and ketchup. At this point, I already felt very disappointed. Our waiter didn't come by to check on us, coffee was cold and food was cold and less than exciting.  It was right before we called it quits when our waiter finally came over to ask if everything was okay. At that point, there really was no saving of our meals.  I'm officially not a fan of BJ's. MAYBE I'll come by for the pizookie but my last two experiences have been less than satisfactory.  It was TOO cold, the service was BAD and the food was unremarkable. I would DEFINITELY say to pass BJ's if you're looking for breakfast in HB."
Jeff M.,"Snohomish, WA",0,67,6,4.0,10/31/2013,"I enjoyed visiting this location a couple of times this week.  I was on a business trip - staying at the nearby Hilton Waterfront Beach resort.   I visited on Sunday and Monday night to watch football!  They also had the world series on both nights, but I was wanting to watch the football game. It was very busy on Sunday, but the food was great, service was good too. I enjoyed the roast beef dip sandwich (4*) one night and the  following night I had chicken strips (4*) - the chicken was great, but the mashed potatoes were cold. Their Desserts are awesome!  I had the BJ's Baked Beignet one night and the next night I tried Apple Berry Burst Crumble.  Both were 5*  The only problem is the ice cream melts too fast because both dishes are served hot, but they were sure delish! I like the big screen TVs and the comfort food and consistent service.  If you are looking for a good place to watch the game and eat, go to BJs!  It's the best choice on Main Street in my opinion."
Esther A.,"Garden Grove, CA",6,128,332,2.0,3/4/2013,"I really like BJ's, but this restaurant at this specific location really sucks. They were not welcoming or friendly. The hostess seated my group, but we didn't even know who our waiter was until 20 minutes later. The servers were not even busy, and they took so long giving my table water/food/check. I would understand if the place was packed and busy, but it wasn't. Go to any other Bj's Restaurant except here.."
Ronald F.,"Garden Grove, CA",0,8,,5.0,3/17/2013,"Damn the food was good. And if you can get Amy K as your waitress, I promise you won't be disappointed. Great service, great food, a good wine selection and very reasonable prices. WE WILL BE BACK... SOON!"
Amy D.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",8,148,43,5.0,4/4/2011,"Great location, good food, fast and friendly service and great prices - what more can you ask for?? On a sunny day, sit on the patio and do a little people watching.  Just don't ogle though, because that is just plain creepy. The BBQ chicken salad is super delish!  Everyone who is not afraid of greens should definitely give it a try."
Laura R.,"Orange County, CA",799,863,175,3.0,6/14/2010,"Newly renovated - this BJ's is super clean and has a huge new TV, new booths and tables, and a new bar. BJ's went from a cool local bar with one of my favorite red beers of all time (jeremiah red), to a typical chain restaurant without a lot of flavor a few years ago. This new location is in the heart of downtown hb, and if you are watching a game, seriously consider grabbing a seat in the bar here.  Pints are $4.95. I always find the food to pretty much suck - and now that they list the calories for every item in the back of the menu, it REALLY makes me not want to eat their food. 1892 calories in a salad? Ah! Props for expanding their outdoor seating and for having attentive staff."
Claire P.,"Upland, CA",1,19,1,4.0,11/29/2014,"I came here with a friend for her birthday it was just the two of us and we called ahead of time to make a reservation that way when we came in we would be seated right away, as we were walking a group of six walked in right behind us and they were seated before us when they had no reservations, we were seated after 10 minutes of waiting on literally nothing, there was no one else waiting for a table and there were plenty open. We finally get seated and get our menus and my friend and I were ready to order within 2 minutes of getting the menu and being seated but our waiter was no where in sight after waiting for 10 minutes i finally flagged down a waiter in another section and had him order our drinks and food. Shortly after ordering our waiter comes and slams our drinks on the table and doesn't say a single word to us. My friend and I were talking about how rude she was and the table next to us heard and started talking to us about how she was so rude to them to and she was being rude and ignored them as well. we then get our food and as we were eating they kept bringing us more drinks but no one was taking the empty glasses it got to a point where i started stacking about 6 glass cups on the ground. after our horrible service meal and not even talking to our server, we tipped the guy that we flagged down to take our order. i then went home and ended up throwing up my entire meal because the meat wasn't cooked properly, i called the next day to tell the manager what happened and she told me to come in and completely refunded my entire meal and informed me that the server will no longer be a part of the team. i was going to write the most horrible review and then i talked to the manager and she completely changed my mind after the shitty service here so thank you for not ruining my experience i will def come back."
Mike C.,"El Monte, CA",1,9,,3.0,12/1/2012,"We ordered the Avocado Egg Roll appetizer, and it came quick and was really good. As for the rest of the food, service was pretty slow, taking over 45 minutes to get our deep dish pizza. It was warm, not hot, and the crust was rubbery as if it had been sitting for a little while, not crispy like if it had been served right away. You have to really be on the wait staff to remind them."
Jessica B.,"Huntington Beach, CA",36,9,,5.0,2/14/2014,"Sweet pig pizza is awesome! Get a pazookie for dessert, peanut butter or white chocolate chip macadamia nut! Delish!"
Laura M.,"Santa Ana, CA",51,101,108,4.0,10/22/2012,I love the cookie w/ ice-cream dessert it was AMAZING!! My cosmo drink was also delish and hooked up! The bartender was very chill I def recommend this place.
Chenai M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",30,28,4,5.0,5/10/2013,"Great service, food was exactly as I asked for :) go here as opposed to the Beach Blvd, location (which has awful service)!!!"
Gregg S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,3,,1.0,11/2/2012,Changed the happy hour with no notice to the customer. Mini pizza cost 12 bucks and well drinks cost over $6 - with Pepsi instead of coke. Last ten visits my order would have cost $20 but cost $31 today. Won't be back anytime soon without seeing the happy hour menu in advance.
Jennifer A.,"San Bernardino, CA",3,3,,1.0,6/18/2014,"Although I am a frequent visitor to BJ's in the Inland Empire, I was extremely disappointed with the service we received at the Huntington Beach location. I was with a party of five and  after of waiting nearly an hour for our food the waiter brought out three of the orders and proceeded to tell me that they just found out they were out of dough for the flatbread pizzas. The manager offered to comp our two dinners. This may seem nice however the rest of the party was completely done with their food before we received ours. The waitress brought the bill only to see that we were charged for all five meals. I had to remind her of what the manager said so she proceeded to bring the bill back with the two meals removed. As far as I am concerned they should have comped the entire bill since my 3 other family members had to sit and wait for us to finish our meal. Never saw the manager again. Very disappointing service."
Amber M.,"Sedona, AZ",11,7,,2.0,9/28/2010,"We came from Az where we eat at BJs 3xs month..  We got seated pretty quick out on the patio.. It was an incredible table for people watching on a Sunday night! But it started to go down hill when we ordered 2 drinks n they took our IDs (because we were out of state) and verified them with the manager.. 10 mins later we got water n our IDs back with no drinks... Then I asked if they had a gluten free menu n the manager had to being me that too.. It was beyond innctedible how long it took just to sit down n order our food. After getting a salad that tastes like it had watered down ranch on it, I ask for a different one. Our waiter gave me an attitude n I then waited another 10 mins to get my salad.. Meanwhile my date ordered a dinner salad n bake potato.. He didn't get the salad till 5 mins till he was done with his baked potato. And by that time it was wilted n gross..  They place was nice n whatnot but service was horrible! Also if ur curious what's in ur food get the allergy menu! Almost everything has MSG in it!!"
Bethany K.,"Huntington Beach, CA",8,5,41,3.0,7/30/2013,"Awesome place to chill and hang out with friends. It can be overcrowded, resulting in slow service, but always good food and friendly service. If you're going to go during any kind of rush time or with a big group, try to call for a reservation; it totally helps!"
Kevin H.,"Los Angeles, CA",11,143,1,2.0,7/5/2010,"Not impressed.  Those are the words that come to mind when I think about the dinner I ordered here last weekend. I met up with a friend.  I put my name on the list at the HB Beer Company across the street but there was a UFC fight going on, so the wait was going to be an hour-and-a-half.  Soooo, we thought we'd eat somewhere else and then come back later to the HBBC for a few steins.   We walked over to BJ's and were seated within 5 minutes, which was nice.  The waiter was pleasant and took care of us quick. But, I ended up being bummed with the place, and here's why: My friend and I were each going to order a salad, but the server told us that the Garden Medley salad, which my friend was ordering, would serve two people no problem, so we ordered that to split. The waiter brings the salad, which looked uninspired - I mean it was a mound of chopped romaine and a few diced tomatoes - and it was definitely not a salad that would easily feed two people.  It didn't taste as bland as it looked; in fact, I'd even go so far as to say it was ""okay,""  but the server was mistaken in saying it would be enough for two.   It suddenly occurred to me that I was eating at a chain restaurant. I ordered the Angel Hair Toscana, a simple dish with a menu description that made it sound appetizing and relatively healthy to eat.  Problem was, the pasta itself tasted like it had been boiled in water that had been re-used 50 times that day.  It just had an off-putting  taste. To the manager's credit, she took the pasta dish off the bill and she was nice about it, but I won't be going back. We ended up driving to Long Beach for dinner."
