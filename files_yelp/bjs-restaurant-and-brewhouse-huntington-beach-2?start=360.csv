Kate K.,"Costa Mesa, CA",185,428,62,3.0,4/4/2011,"Not my first choice... ever, but I wouldn't say ""absolutely not"" if someone requested we go there for dinner. they have a full bar and a good beer selection, but you should go there for the pizza--the great white is my favorite, but I hear every kind is great!  Theire appetizers are meh, and the pastas are pretty good--the jumbalaya is tasteless but the fettucini alfredo tastes really good. This one is great if you sit out on the patio because you can people watch, and if you're from around HB you know that people watching on Main St is a favorite pasttime for locals."
Britt P.,"San Diego, CA",2,3,,1.0,3/23/2012,"We've been here several times and the service at this particular location has been TERRIBLE every time.  Drinks and food take forever to get delivered.  It seems like they're chronically understaffed, and the waitstaff makes excuses instead of apologizing. Knowing this, tonight we decided to try and circumvent this problem by simply phoning in an order.  This time took the cake. After being on hold for seven minutes, we had my mom call in to see if she could talk to someone.  The host picked up, and told her that she would have to wait on hold.  My mom asked how many people were on hold ahead of her.  The host said nobody was.  Are you kidding? This location does not deserve your business. These problems seem to be specific to this location -- I've been to others and have never had terrible service like this.  But we'll never return to this location and strongly encourage others who don't want to put up with such terrible service to do the same."
Mike K.,"Los Angeles, CA",140,18,,4.0,6/19/2011,"No matter which one you visit, BJ's offers great service and great food.  Their signature brews (my favorite is the Harvest Hef) and pizzas are staple menu items.  My personal favorite is the Roast Beef Dip, and you can't leave without a Pizookie. All locations are generally packed on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday evenings, so plan accordingly.  No reservations unless you're throwing a big party."
Chris G.,"London, United Kingdom",132,393,68,4.0,3/6/2010,"My girlfriend found out that I had never had BJ's before and was shocked - so shocked that she had to introduce me to it right there and then. And you know, I was amazed. It was brilliant.  Maybe it was because I am English that I had not had BJ's before, but it was an experience I will never forget. In fact, I made my girlfriend promise it to me at least once a day.  While I was in there, I felt very comfortable, but toward the end I became so excited that my girlfriend had to take me out.  So for all of you that have not had BJ's before, you have got to try it, it is incredible."
Sandy N.,"Anaheim, CA",22,77,60,2.0,7/1/2012,"The food wasn't bad, but has bad service. The waitress was inpatient and unfriendly.  When we didn't understanding all the items for a dish, we asked the waitress and she just simply point back to the menu and asked us to read it again. We have been to other BJ's and their services were much better."
Chuck B.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",0,14,9,2.0,9/30/2014,"Text that table was ready, then sent back outside... We were seated later. The service was terrible. Our order was split, half the table was served and then the other two came a few minutes later. The food was mediocre at best. I would not recommend it, especially for its high price."
AJ W.,"Newport Beach, CA",12,26,,3.0,9/21/2010,"After checking out the booths of organic produce, surf photography and Himalayan wool beanies at the Farmer's Market on Main Street in HB my girlfriend and I were hungry.  I told her any place she liked was fine with me, and we ended up wandering into this BJ's and had a pretty good experience.   The first thing I noticed walking in was how nice the place looked.  It's a scaled down version of the larger Bj's you're used to, kind of a blend of an upscale pub and the franchise.  The bar area has lots of high-tops, lots of screens for sports and nice long bar for bellying up to and ordering your favorite poison.  The second thing I noticed was how loud the place was.  Am I getting old or does anyone else cringe at the thought of having to shout your dinner conversation?   We were given the choice of waiting on an outside table or being sat right away inside, and chose inside.  Sadly the open table was on the bar perimeter and I could barely hear the hostess tell us the usual ""our specials are...and your server will be with you shortly"".  So we decided to wait for the outside table, which was actually available right away.  The outside seating consists of a patio area at the front and some two-tops along the side which gives you good people watching time. I know people like getting the pizzas here, but I'm the kind of guy who goes to burger joints for burgers and pizza parlors for pizza.  They do it best and much cheaper.  It doesn't mean I don't do it occasionally though. Ok, off my soapbox... My girlfriend ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken with broccoli and mashed potatoes and I got the Italian Market Salad with vinagrette dressing (I'm still doing the no-carb thing ok?  Don't you think I wanted something else and wash it down with beer?  Well I did, but I didn't). The food was good (my girlfriend brought half the chicken home) and we enjoyed being outside people watching and actually being able to hear each-other.  I think the waiter may have forgotten us a couple of times, but no matter, we were in no hurry and he didn't forget us for long. All in all, the meal was about $30 for both of us and we walked away satisfied. Oh, and they validate your stub for the parking structure."
Amanda V.,"Seattle, WA",103,50,9,2.0,9/18/2012,The food was decent but the service was terrible. It took us literally 40 minutes for us to get our food after we ordered...and another 20 after we asked for our check. Our server wasn't even friendly and didn't apologize once for his poor speed of service. Overall we spent over two hours sitting in BJs just to eat mediocre food. I wouldn't come here again.
FoodyforLife Y.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",19,60,23,2.0,5/10/2014,"My girlfriends and I came here for my friend's birthday after a trip to the beach expecting to have a great dinner like we usually do at the bjs by our house, but the experience was not comparable. The hot tea was lukewarm, the table was dirty, and the pulled pork sandwich was not up to par. The coleslaw was dry and chopped too big. The stuffed mushrooms were delicious and the pizza was good. The shrimp tacos were atrocious. The guacamole tasted like green sour cream and the tortilla tasted like plain flat bread. The busboy Jordan was awful he left numerous empty plates and cups on our table after walking by and passing us 4 times. Instead of cleaning our table he went and talked to the homeless man that stands right next to the patio cussing, yelling, and making inappropriate balloon figures. It made us very uncomfortable. Our waitress, Karen was fabulous, picking up all the slack of the bus boy and managing to bring us everything we asked for in a prompt manner despite being very busy. P.s. Please bring back the red velvet pizookie, the salted caramel leaves much to be desired."
Jon R.,"Huntington Beach, CA",306,114,411,4.0,2/12/2010,"They just finished remodeling this place and now it has a full bar. It's a lot smaller than other bjs, but it's still pretty cozy inside.  It's a good change from all the other bars on main st. They still have the happy hour specials and lunch specials that you are used to having from all the other bjs. It right on main st and you can have a really great view of all the hot eye candy on a nice day if u sit out in the patio area. I'm glad they added a full bar here now so u can just come here have a drink and chill when u don't feel like sitting in one of the loud bars here. Plus u can have a pizookie when the munchies kick in hehe  Just to let u guys know only the taller tables are considered the bar area, so if you're there for happy hour, u have to sit at the bar or on one of the high tables. I didn't really take time to rate the food because you should already know the food is bomb! My faves are of course the pizookies then the great white pizza, buffalo chicken pizza, the pesto flat bread, and the roasted turkey cobb sandwich. I can go on and on about my faves here but i don't want to bore u with the details. Stop by on a nice day. U won't regret it"
Robert G.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,12,,4.0,8/18/2014,"I have been going to the Bjs on Main St for a long time. There food is delicious.  The pizza was what drew me there, inexpensive and excellent, the cheese and tomato is still my favorite. Since they expanded the menu there are so many more excellent items, my favorite is the pot roast sandwich. Oh, did I mention the beer? Hands down, my favorite beer on the planet is the Jeremiah Red!  The service there is always great, they must pay better or make better tips because they are always friendly, happy and helpful. Don't forget a pizzookie if you still have room! The only reason I wrote this review was to comment on the breakfast though. The breakfast is not good and the only reason I knocked it down a star. I am saddened by the poor attempt at bfast. My wife and I went on a Saturday. The menu is limited, especially for the health conscious. The food we received was fresh, but undercooked and bland. I'll say it again, the service I received was excellent in spite of the poor food. That being said, thank you bus for many years of excellent food, beer and service!"
Mark A.,"Los Angeles, CA",374,435,670,5.0,5/3/2008,"You know what I LOVE about this particular location? OUTDOOR SEATING The outdoor seating might be uncomfortable since it's at the front entrance of this BJ's, but it has a great view of Main St. View in particular? the EYE CANDY! Hahahaha! You see bikini beach babes walking up and down main street- absolutely breathtaking! Haha! Other than that, this BJ's is a great stop after a long bike ride down to Huntington Beach (start off and Angel's stadium and ride the trail down the Santa Ana river). Anyways, BJ's Restaurant and Brewery. I love this place. I've been visiting BJ's for quite some time. Pizookies are KILLER, always a MUST when you go to one. The pizzas are great too, a sweet pig, bbq chicken, great white or even blackened chicken never fail me. I think I enjoy the  blackened chicken pizza the most. They update there menu from time to time, to mix things up. One item (burger) in particular that I have come to like is their Cuban Burger. Just like a Cuban-style sandwich, except it's in a burger form, tastes great! Great experience! We got the meal ""on-the-house"" because of our corporate hookup! ;)"
Cynthia A.,"Huntington Beach, CA",464,718,330,2.0,8/20/2009,"Came here for a late night dessert w/some friends.. Stupid stupid me......... where else would young teens go to hang out on a Saturday night in HB ...... it's either here or IHOP.. Happy hour pizookies and pizza.. cute.  What's not cute are the hoards of screaming teens who feel their asinine hi jinks such as spilling their drinks all over the floor and continually asking the waiters to take their pictures are hilarious and think all the patrons at the restaurant feel the same. The service was incredibly slow for a restaurant that was only giving two options of food to order..Took forever to get our drinks, food and check.   Our waitress was rude.  Does it make sense that one pazookie that comes w/two scoops of ice cream has two massive mounds while another pazookie that is supposed to have three scoops has three ping pong sized ice cream balls?  When my friend asked our waitress snootily said ""Well that's how they come we can't do anything about it.""  Yea I guess the boss will notice if an additional scoop or two from the tub is missing when he's counting the ice cream inventory at the end of the night.   I give this place an extra strar because during the day it's not bad.. but it's still ridiculously crowded with people."
Bishoy G.,"Anaheim, CA",88,4,9,4.0,7/2/2014,"One of my favorite Bjs.. Awesome service, great server.. We went for the happy hour and Suzan was our server!! She's fast and she knows how to take care of the customers!! Wohooooo thanks Suzan ;)"
Rick B.,"Corona del Mar, CA",11,30,6,3.0,9/28/2012,"I was downtown for an EMT recertification course at the Huntington Beach Lifeguard Headquarters for the weekend.  I opted for the Calzone.  It was awesome.  It was served hot with marina sauce over the top.  Very excellent.  Should of had a beer since their sodas are flat and weird tasting.  Even had a great apple cinnamon desert in honor of Octoberfest.  It also was excellent.  The biggest hit in the rating is how slow they are.  Just a meal for one and one of the first customers in the door, one and a half hours to eat.  I had to go to the bar for my own drink refills and had to ask them to rush running my card since I was now running late for getting back to class.  But. Hey.  It's down on the beach. You aren't supposed to be in a hurry.  As I was leaving I saw many people standing with their check in hand looking for their waitress.  Maybe they understaffed a. Bit?"
Ashley M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,3,1,1.0,9/14/2014,"Worst service ever. Our waitress was clearly high. We ordered a drink and she never asked if we wanted another one. When we ordered our food she didn't ask how we wanted our burgers, what side we wanted. When my daughter tried to order on the sheet they give kids she just stared at her. We got an appetizer to share and Noone ever brought us plates, then fifteen minutes later when I asked for one she looked like she didn't understand me. Another waitress came while I was eating my dry burger and asked if we wanted desert and I told her not yet, we're still eating. Noone cleared the appetizer plate while we ate. The waitress never came back to the table and while we still had half a plate of food someone just came and dropped off our check, meanwhile I'm trying to order another drink for a half hour. Boone asked if we wanted a box. Just pretty much left us high and dry. I'll never come here again."
Corinna R.,"Orange County, CA",0,21,13,1.0,5/18/2014,"First time in Huntington Beach ,we decided to have lunch at bjs when we arrived there was a short wait to be seated ,our waiter comes and asks us what we would like to drink we both said sprite ,he got distracted and says ok so 2 cokes coming I then corrected him when it was time to order I ordered a burger with no onions no tomatoe with a side of ranch he did not repeat the order when our food arrives there onions tomatoes and no side of ranch , I did not say anything about it ,then we asked for ketchup he said sure comes out twice with no ketchup then the 3rd time he looks at us and aid oh yea the ketchup by that time we were almost finished ,he really just had an I don't care attitude the whole time after all that we felt as if he was rushing us out asked if we wanted boxes have us the bill and came back four times for it bad experience"
Mary N.,"Anaheim, CA",136,93,17,2.0,9/9/2013,"So this past Saturday I had my 25th birthday here at this BJ's. I called 2 weeks in advance to make the reservations, I figured that would be more than enough time. I made the reservation at 8pm for 25-30 people. Some of my party arrived at 7:30 so they went to the front desk and let them know so the hostess gave them the buzzer for when the table will be ready. I arrived at 8pm and went to the front desk to check the status on our tables, the hostess said maybe another 5-20 minutes. I thought OK that's not too bad. Here comes 8:30 and now my guests are all standing outside waiting to go. I went back to the hostess and she said ""you can go back there they are just cleaning the tables"" ok so you want us to stand there while they clean the tables? Awesome! The manager did come up to me and say she is sorry for the late sitting but they had a party there before mine. Which was fine, but then more and more of my guests arrived and come to find out the room I had reserved only fit 25 people max. So now I had about 4 of my guest just standing around and ended up leaving. I had also let my party know to make sure they get there parking ticket validated so they wont have to pay. When we left BJ's we went to the car and got up to the pay booth and the gentleman said it was $13.00!!!!! Turns out BJ's only takes off $!!. So now that we have spent over $350.00 at BJ's now I have to pay $13.00 for parking oh and there's a $2.50 charge for using your card. GREAT!!!!! Overall I wasn't too happy with my birthday."
David R.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,26,,1.0,10/5/2011,The big TV above the bar is awesome but you better sit directly in front of it if you want a drink in a reasonable time frame.   Been here 3 times and every time I've had to walk to the bar as waiting 10 minutes plus is no bueno!
George K.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,1,,4.0,6/19/2014,We have been coming here for years and never had a bad experience  till now . The Calamari was horrible and we had to return it . They changed the recipe and the portion size . Everything else we ordered was good . Please bring back the old Calamari recipe !
