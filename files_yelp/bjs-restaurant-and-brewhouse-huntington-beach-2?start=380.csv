renn a.,"Orange, CA",246,92,33,4.0,4/27/2010,"They remodeled! I thought I was at a different BJs from the last time I ate there.  Service was good even after happy hour.  Food is ok, I'm not into deep dish pizzas, so we tried the new flatbread pizza. It was ok.  Their mini bruchetta was pretty good though.  And the server was cute, only reason it got one more star, or else it would have been a 3."
Brittney G.,"West Covina, CA",160,65,43,4.0,5/31/2012,I love the food and their beer! I like the location because you can walk main street before or after you munch here. The service has always been splendid and the customers have always been nice too
Tiffany M.,"Stanton, CA",1,14,15,5.0,8/13/2012,"This is by far my favorite restaurant I've ever been to. Waiters are always checking in on you, refills are free, and the portions are big. The menu has a wide variety of appetizers, entrees, and deserts. Always look forward to eating here!"
Susan V.,"Huntington Beach, CA",2,24,,4.0,8/8/2010,"I don't go here for pizza, but the burgers are fantastic!!!!! From the sliders to the specialty burgers (like the California grill with avocado and green chiles and chipotle sauce, yumm), I started a new thing with where to go when I want a great burger downtown hb. Since they remodeled the restaurant is still a little slow on service, but the food is still good. I also like the mini bruschetta, and it's a great place for lunch salads!"
Joceline I.,"Garden Grove, CA",0,2,,1.0,7/12/2015,"THIS IS THE WORST SERVICE I HAVE EVER RECEIVED. I made a yelp account just to complain about this BJ's.... I had a group of 8 people and before we ordered we asked for the check to be separated 4 ways and the server said no we could only do 3... Very strange but we dealt with it. After separating it 3 ways, we gave our server back the check with our cards and he took it to the register. Shortly after he came back and said he needed us to do the math ourselves because he was to confused. After sitting there for 30 minutes calculating it I spoke to the manager & let her know the situation. Instead of actually having the server do his job to calculate it her response was ""Well it is confusing and he is to busy to calculate it."" Even though our server was just sitting at the register the full 30 minutes we were doing it ourselves and when we asked for water he completely ignored it!! horrible customer service. I will be calling BJ's headquarters to complain. DO NOT GO HERE"
Lydia S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",202,100,196,4.0,9/4/2011,"The service is always pleasant here, which kind of makes up for the madhouse that is the waiting list. It's a fun location on Main Street in Huntington,  so if you want romantic and private, keep walking-you won't find it here but the people watching is fun. The food is really good , and predictable at least! Go for the flat pizzas-they are wonderful"
Jeff F.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,16,,1.0,11/12/2013,"I have lived in Hunting Beach for 25 years.  I have gotten sick EVERY time I have eaten here.  I have a ""weak"" stomach but usually one other member in our family or group gets sick as well.  Maybe they've gotten better I obviously don't eat here any longer - under any circumstances."
Matt J.,"Covington, LA",24,55,9,3.0,1/15/2010,"I had the turkey cob sandwich.  i was surprised with the bread and fresh avocado.  i took the thick fries over the skinny-skinny.  i like how some of the pieces were still crunchy, but not over done.  $10 is steep for just a sandwich, but given the location of the eatery, it's excusable. For my beverage, i originally ordered BJ's blonde or whatever.  It arrived stale & warm and i wasn't in the mood for that taste.  I sent it back and got the hefeweizen instead.  much better!  i don't usually fruit my beer, but i'd pinch the lemon and float it with their brew. The pizza looked really good.  If i get around to coming back, i'm definitely grabbing one!"
Lindsey T.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,12,,1.0,6/3/2013,I recently ate at BJs in Huntington Beach.  I had the Ceasar Salad with Grilled Salmon.  I got food poisoning and was so sick for 24 hours.  I would never eat here again!
Cait B.,"Huntington Beach, CA",220,54,21,3.0,7/26/2011,"Ok the food is good. And they have some pretty amazing off-menu martinis(ask a bartender). But why is it that every time I go into this location all of the waitstaff seem so impatient. If it takes me longer than 30 seconds to order after sitting down, it's like i've committed a crime. Every time. Is it because it's downtown, because none of the other locations ever make me feel so rushed."
Chelsea H.,"Garden Grove, CA",1,11,6,1.0,4/11/2015,"I went to BJ's hoping for good food and friendly service after a long day at the beach with my friends. When we came in to ask for a table, the hostess treated us with a manner that made us feel disrespected. We felt because we looked young, she treated us with a rude manner, like we were going to dine and dash or something. Personally, I felt extremely disrespected and I was disappointed. The wait time to get a table was pretty reasonable, but after we sat down, the wait time for our food was OUTRAGEOUSLY UNREASONABLE. We got our appetizer (Spinach and Artichoke Dip) 20 minutes after we sat down and it took another 40 minutes to get our entree (4 slices of BBQ Chicken Pizza). We decided to order 3 mini pizookies when we finished our appetizer, because we knew it would take awhile to make, but 30 minutes after we finished our pizza, we FINALLY received our dessert after asking a couple different waiters/waitresses. What's the point of telling your waitress ahead of time if it's going to take the same amount of time or even longer? Also, our waitress didn't even bother to check up on us, while she checked on others and I felt like we were treated unfairly. In conclusion, we had a poor experience because we were belittled by both the hostess and the waitress."
Jo N.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,13,9,2.0,5/14/2014,"I live just a few blocks away and my past experiences here have been good, but last Sunday (Mother's Day) I went with a few family members and had a ridiculous experience.  Waitress was fantastic- great personality and very accommodating. We ordered a pizza and asked for bacon on 3/4 since my daughter is vegetarian- and the two guys wanted extra  sauce. The waitress said she would request triple sauce. The pizza came, had bacon everywhere and not one spot of sauce that we could see with the naked eye. She brought the manager over and he said he'd have a new one made. Since we were really hungry, the others of us said that if he would just bring some sauce we could continue to munch on that one until the new pizza came. He came back about 10 minutes later with a tiny ramekin of sauce. Then when the second pizza came, the waitress took the remainder of the first pizza to box for us to take home (it was actually a very good pizza) and we started on the new one. This time, barely any sauce and some pieces of bacon on my daughter's portion. Not a big deal- we just wanted to eat and get out of there. Then the waitress came back- said the manager took the other pizza from her and ""got rid of it"".  We ended up being there a very long time- no offer of a comp drink, dessert or any type of compensation for the bungled pizza. Very disappointing. Plenty of other good choices in downtown HB."
Lightning T.,"Garden Grove, CA",0,54,,2.0,8/11/2011,"I usually enjoy eating at BJs but for this particular one, not so much. I ordered the New York strip and it was dry and bland. And for $19 I expect it to be much better. And they didnt give me my 2nd side which I waited for 20 mins. They did the samething to my friend, but he never asked for his 2nd side, I don't understand why let them do that to you. I won't be going to this one by choice unless my friend really wants to, but no more dried steak and poor service for me."
Brooke L.,"Huntington Beach, CA",142,185,56,2.0,5/20/2011,"Went to BJ's last night to watch a Giants/ Dodgers game... and for dinner of course.  Everything took FOREVER!  10 minutes to clean off a dirty table and seat us.  10 minutes for a server to come and greet us and to take out drink orders.. 10 minutes for our drinks to come (sodas) 30 minutes for our dinner salads to come out, 15 minutes later our pizza came out.  20 minutes to get a drink refill... finally another waitress noticed how annoyed we were and kept checking on us from that point forward.  Took care of our drinks and to-go box.  Granted... we did go there at 7:00 on a Thursday... but it shouldnt take 20 minutes to get a refil (especially since I was dying of thirst)... The food was decent... no complaints to the kitchen just the service from our waiter and hostess.  At the end the waiter we had apologized and started making small talk with us.. I told him I was a Giants fan and he proceeded to see me ""they suck"" (even tho they were whipping the dodgers ass)- so one less star for that!"
Taryn P.,"Kailua, HI",140,74,3,5.0,3/8/2012,"For a chain restaurant, their beer and food is outstanding!"
Dianne K.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,1,,3.0,6/3/2015,"We were looking for a restaurant with late night happy hour and BJ's is one of the few in HB. We got there before 10 so didn't end up taking advantage of it. We each had the house margarita, which I thought was great, but my husband thought was a little light on tequila. I ordered the sirloin with asparagus and my husband ordered the chipotle salmon. I also ordered a caesar salad. Well, we waited and waited and no salad came out. We ordered a second drink. We waited and waited some more. Finally, the waiter told us that he had forgotten to put our order in and apologized. My husband asked him to comp one of the drinks and he said he'd see what he could do. Some woman came out, presumably a manager, she didn't identify herself, and asked us how things were going. We said fine and she left. I guess that was what we got for having to wait so long for our food. My poor husband had worked an 11 hour day, was tired and hungry. When the bill came, nothing was comped or discounted. So, I would have to say that as nice as the waiter was, I would have to say I won't be going back to that location. That just isn't how you treat a customer."
Cher A.,"Sunset Beach, CA",0,17,,5.0,9/14/2012,"Had an awesome experience here last weekend. The service was great, the food was wonderful and the manager came over and chatted with us for a bit to make sure everything was good. Great times, would highly recommend!"
Ryan F.,"Walnut Creek, CA",107,129,1,3.0,3/1/2009,"This place has excellent food, but the service is constantly lacking. It doesn't matter what time of day you visit, the service will always be sub-par. They validate parking for the nearby garage, so if you visit you can rest assured your parking was free."
Brad R.,"Seattle, WA",19,259,802,4.0,4/24/2011,BJ's recently expanded the bar by taking over the restaurant next door.  This completely changed the look and feel of this bar making it one of the best places to grab a beer in all of HB.  Their lineup of beers if fantastic and the pizza is awesome.  Nothing beats the buffalo chicken pizza and some piranha ale.
Chelsea T.,"Anaheim, CA",59,53,56,4.0,8/8/2013,"Every time the 2 for $20 pizza deal comes around, my boyfriend and I eat there like 5 times in a row lol. BJ's pizza is so delicious, the crust is moist and crunchy at the same time, oh man not much compares to this (as far as non-New York Pizza goes). The service at this spot can be very iffy, they are packed on most nights so the wait is a little longer."
