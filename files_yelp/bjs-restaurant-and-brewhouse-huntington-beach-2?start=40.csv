Shelly O.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,29,,5.0,8/29/2017,Love this place. Food is always amazing and the staff are always super friendly. Highly recommend if your a local or just visiting.
MarVy S.,"Arcadia, CA",484,334,3657,2.0,10/24/2015,"We came here to watch the Thursday Night Football Game.  I was expecting it to be busy but it wasn't.  The Hostess greeted us and mentioned that Happy Hour is offered at the bar area.  We ended up sitting by the bar so we can get a great view of the game.   ::Food:: We ordered the Pepperoni Extreme Deep Dish Pizza (I didn't think it was a deep dish pizza) and asked to add mushrooms too.  It has five cheese blend according to the menu but I couldn't tell.  I thought it would have a lot of pepperoni but it didn't. The crust was good.  Then we got Chicken Wings; half Hot Buffalo and half Garlic Parmesan.  The wings were not crispy.   ( ) ( ) ::Customer Service:: ~Everything took a long time: getting two glasses of water, food, to go box, getting the bill, and paying the bill.  It started to get busy maybe that's why.  The service was really really really slow.  The person who took care of our table didn't seem happy. Maybe he was having a bad day.  At one point we were looking around to find him so we could get the check.   ~Order was not correct: I requested to have the Hot Buffalo sauce on the side but the sauce was on the hot wings. I prefer to have the chicken plain so it can be crispy; I just dip it in the sauce.   ~The Hostess was friendly.  ::Rating:: Customer Service was disappointing and the food was just ""ok"".   ::M's Notes:: ~Happy Hour: Mon-Fri 3pm-7pm / Sun-Thurs 10pm-Close  ~Indoor and Outdoor Seating ~Parking: Meter, Street, Lot, and Structure"
Austin M.,"Yorba Linda, CA",17,9,1,5.0,3/18/2017,"Came here on a busy packed Saturday night. Grabbed a table quickly, and for how busy it was things got started quickly. Our server was very friendly and did well while handling another large table that seemed needy. She payed good attention to my girlfriends allergies and overall made a last minute dinner enjoyable.  I have been here numerous times and have never truly had a problem making it not worth going."
Matt S.,"Kansas City, MO",60,15,2,4.0,4/4/2017,"BJ's is a wonderful experience of joy and happiness. The flatbread nachos were so good they make ya wanna slap your grandma. The pizookies are the best thing since Wookiees. The deep dish pizza isn't really anything like Chicago deep dish at all though. It was good, but it was just fluffier crust almost like a cheesy bread instead of a deep dish pizza. It also really needed more cheese. The prices on specials nights are quite good. I ordered a lovely Alabama sunset like a real man, and drank it down my gullet faster than a cheetah. Only issue was the sad state of the deep dish. Eat here and you'll have a fairly unemotional experience."
Alan M.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,132,64,4.0,1/17/2017,"BJs is a hit and miss.  I boycotted a different and unrelated  BJs  due to an unrelated poor service and attitude.  ( Montebello location)   I was pleasantly surprised that all of the waiter/waitresses who attended to us were nice, friendly, and helpfully.  I gave a nice tip.   (Waitress with the glasses is awesome) Thank you."
Marcus M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",138,7,,2.0,5/21/2017,"Giving this a 2 Star review only because of previous good experiences (we eat there a few times a month) but unfortunately the bad experiences make the greatest impressions. Normally I eat here during the week and never come to Main St on the weekends (we live a few blocks away) but decided to give it a shot as a last minute Sunday dinner.  We got here and the wait wasn't bad just about 5min total. We were sat down and about 5-10min later we were greeted by our waitress. Since we have eaten here on numerous occasions we already knew what we wanted to order. We ordered our drinks, appetizers and dinners. Shortly after ordering we received our drinks. Then I recieved the soup that came with my dinner (Prime Rib). The only problem was that I asked for it to come after the appetizers. No big deal I will just put it to the side and eat it later. Then our appetizers come and we proceed to eat them. A little while after the appetizers I am am informed that my Prime Rib is not offered in Rare/Medium Rare at the moment and I can either have it Medium, Medium Well or Well Done. I decide to get it Medium only because I didn't want to wait for a different meal to be made. The meals come a few min later and my Prime Rib is more on the Well side than Medium. Whatever it's not the end of my life. The food is good and it's getting late, my kids need to get home and go to sleep since they have school in the morning.  We finish our food and I ask the waitress for a few to go boxes, our check, parking validated and the Pazooki that was included with my meal. She realizes that she put my order in wrong but said that she will have her manager fix it. She comes back with our boxes and check. She informs me that the Pazooki is being made as we speak. Our bill is $68 so I decide to leave her a $20 tip because I know that servers rely on tips to make any real money. We box up our food and wait for our Pazooki. And wait. And wait. And wait. After 30min of trying to get our servers attention I finally corner her at the front register and ask her about the Pazooki. She said that she will check on it. She comes back and says that her manage is putting a rush on the Pazooki upon which I tell her that it's already been over 30min since we ordered it. Nobody at our table has anything left to drink and we haven't gotten any water refills since starting dinner. I tell her to just cancel the desert. I decide to change her tip from $20 to $10 which is still probably more than most would tip under this situation. I am unsure if or when we will come back. If we did it will definitely never be on a weekend and even at that it's probably going to be a long time."
Char P.,"Colton, CA",77,95,64,4.0,7/17/2017,Our server was awesome it was a busy Sunday and she rocked thanks Kailyn. I had the deep dish pizza. It was my first time. The buffalo chicken very tasty. I don't say this often my woody's whiskey sour was strong!!
Kylene G.,"Downey, CA",186,5,2,1.0,5/6/2017,"Worst BJs location that I have dined at. Chef's made decent food. No refills on water were offered at any time. Waiter didn't stop at our table, we had to ask the hostess for help. Our waiter also only took the order for 2/4 of our guest. Took 40 mins to get our sirloin, and there was no sorry for the wait or anything of that nature. Our own waiter didn't even bring our check or offer us anything   for our waiter Anthony T. He aint shit."
Christina M.,"Barelas, Albuquerque, NM",0,1,,2.0,6/14/2017,"The staff at this location is.... weird. They seemed rude and disorganized. I understand they were busy when I went in but based on the size of their staff, you'd think they could manage it. I felt uncomfortable before I was even seated. I walked up to the hostess and a guy I believe was a busser. The interaction was just weird. These two particular staff members made sarcastic comments about something that the people I was with were wearing them they turned and laughed at each other. I'm pretty sure they were fucking with us.  The hostess led us to a dirty table, after she told us that someone had already gone to clean it. I understand things happen but it was just disorganized and the staff seemed to lack communication. At one point, someone at the table next to me spilled a drink on them and the bussers didn't seem to know what to do. The spill stayed on the floor for a while after that until what looked like a manager told a busser to clean it. The guy seemed really confused like he didn't know what he was doing for a moment then finally took care of it. When our food came out, the guy giving us our food made more weird sarcastic comments. I understand trying to make small talk but there are more things to talk about than something you observe about your guests. He even mocked my voice, which kind of high pitched. I guess he was trying to be funny or whatever but I was on edge because of the comments from the hostess earlier.  I observed the other staff members. I noticed that the servers around me at other tables were very nice, courteous and polite. Out waitress, Danielle R. was great. If not for her being just a normal waitress, I'd have thought that the staff's goal for the night was to see how many customers they could piss off. I guess it just seems that the bussers, hosts and runners are bored or something and trying to entertain themselves at the expense of their guests. It was just weird and uncomfortable. I think that staff really needs to consider how they look to their customers and how they treat them.  2.5 stars. Food was good and our waitress was nice but everything else just made me uncomfortable."
John L.,"Emeryville, CA",73,227,10,2.0,7/6/2017,"Sometimes a busy night means long waits for tables.  I get that. But when a 20-25 minute wait turns into nearly an hour, and I have to bus my own table just so the nearly an hour wait doesn't turn into over an hour, I tend to get a little cross with the service.  Still, it's to be expected at a place like this.  However there's a line where expectations end and incompetence comes into play.  BJ's crosses it. Pros:  +convenient location to Huntington Beach pier. +Plenty of big screens inside to catch the game +Good portion size and price +Wide selection of entrees Cons -crowded -loud even for a bar/pub -slow, inconsistent service -parking can be difficult A party of six can be somewhat challenging but it felt like this location had maybe 4 tables that could  fit six, less if you don't want to be crammed into a corner. We ordered an appetizer (calamari) and it arrived with no plates to eat it on. I asked for plates for our party of six (the server never brought them out) and got four.  Our drink order was wrong, and when they did remember to bring the final plates, one of them had baked on cheese from an insufficient cleaning. Waiting for a drink refill was at least 10 minutes from the tune we had to flag our server down to ask for a refill.  For the duration of our meal, we saw our server at the following times: ordering drinks, ordering entrees, getting refills (the first time had to be solicited, and there was only one other time), and checking in on how we were doing.  Once.  And of course, checking if we were ready for the bill, completely forgetting to see if we wanted dessert, much less actually bringing the dessert that came with our meal. And throughout, not a single plate or glass was cleared off our table.  I'm not impressed.  They weren't rude and were apologetic, but in the end, intentions only cover so much and service as a whole drags them down.   The food is acceptable.  Flavors were solid and robust if a little salty, and the prices are typical, certainly not a tourist trap kind of pricing scheme.  There are a number of specials and while things are a little haphazard in terms of selection, everyone will be able to find something that hits the spot for them.  Everything entree wise was prepared correctly, but we're also talking about the bare minimum.   The only reason this review isn't a one star is that none of these errors were indicative of poor overall quality, just youth, inexperience and a busy night.   Service issues aside BJ's is a typical damily/bar restaurant with all the potential pitfalls being realized in a beach side chain restaurant.  As I've said before, when part of a franchise or chain, service is the main way to distinguish yourself, and this place fails that metric.  It's the nature of the beast, so take it into consideration when looking for a place to eat.  Especially when the beast is poorly trained."
Yessenia C.,"Maywood, CA",25,11,3,5.0,2/18/2017,"Such a good ambiance, jack and Jeremy are the best, making my best friend's birthday brunch one to remember. First time here but because of them I'll definitely be coming back again!"
Alyssa A.,"Yorba Linda, CA",111,10,5,1.0,10/16/2016,"Came to this BJ's after a nice night at the beach for my boyfriends birthday and I can easily say this was the worst experience I've had at any BJ's location. Our waitress was EXTREMELY rude!! There was only one other table she was taking care of so there is no excuse here. First she spilled some chips on me, and when I asked for extra napkins she never returned. I also wanted to let her know it was my bf's birthday when he went to the restroom so it would be a surprise, and she paid no attention to me! I looked to see if she was busy and she walked to the bar where a few coworkers were hanging out and just started talking socially. When I finally got her attention I was greeted with so much attitude I couldn't believe it. She slapped my menu closed in my face and walked away as if she were in a hurry while I was still talking to her in mid sentence! I mentioned the bday & she bent down in my face and said something like ""ok, I'll get your FREE pizooki for his 'birthday'"" sarcasm slap to the face! Why would I lie about his bday she is so rude! I'm angry, and I can't come back to this location.  We also ordered chips and guac, and the guac wasn't even mashed it was in chunks.  The chips were straight up as flaky as our server."
chris m.,"Huntington Beach, CA",210,5,1,1.0,8/19/2017,"We ordered take out and our $100 order was given to someone else. So we waited for them to remake our entire order. What did we wait for? Our missing salad. Our cold, undercooked, soggy pizza. Amazing. With all the competition in downtown HB now, I'd suggest bringing your money somewhere else. I wish there was a zero star."
Morgan M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,3,1.0,5/11/2017,Waiter took 15 minutes to finally approach us and when we ordered they got the order completely wrong and the food finally came but was COLD!!!! We complained to the manager and she only gave us half off!
Bill M.,"Stockertown, PA",0,10,,5.0,8/8/2017,"Ate there during Vans US Open. Considering how crowded everything was, we were seated quickly and served quickly. Normal great selection of BJ's. Everyone was pleased. My son who has a peanut allergy was with us and ears frequently at BJ's with no issues to date."
Tara S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",6,3,,1.0,3/24/2017,I come down to the Main Street bjs all the time. They have never messed up on my order or have been rude. This time today though was a first for all. The blonde lady under the to go sign was very rude and mean and made me give back my order when it was already 30 minutes late! Can someone tell me why I got my order 30 minutes late after I put it in on the computer an hour before. Worst experience ever. I didn't even get a sorry. You won't be seeing me back here again.
Jose C.,"Huntington Beach, CA",85,19,9,5.0,7/2/2017,"I absolutely love Bjs they always have great service and the food never disappoints. The Parmesan chicken, Santa Fe salad, and guava burger are all to die for. This is a busier Bjs do to it being near the beach and tends to get busy on weekends and holidays. They did get my order wrong but they were very quick to fix it and took it off our bill. The servers were super sweet about everything and I will definitely be back."
Victor D.,"San Jose, CA",0,160,,3.0,12/7/2016,I only like this BJs of all he BJs I been to. It's Huntington Beach so the quality is given fact. Hmmm they could make it little more cosy but for most part everything is good... They should come up with vegetarian options other than veggie pizza lol ... Vegan dishes like Yard house and they can pull the crowd toward BJs instead of yard house
Marina N Manuel A.,"Fontana, CA",29,9,3,1.0,7/5/2017,"Worst experience I ever had, service was horrible waited an 1 hour and 15 minutes for my food... sad!!! Was expecting much more from this spot."
Leland S.,"Irvine, CA",873,753,1001,4.0,4/10/2015,"I don't usually do corporate but when I do it's when I receive gift cards, free pizookie coupons, and happy hour. Here's how my experience went: Ambiance Parking | Plenty of parking whether it's street or garage. We came here on a Tuesday evening for Surf City nights at around 6pm. We didn't have any problems at the garage 2 streets over 2 dollars for 2 hours? I'm down with that. Seating | Plenty of seating outside and inside however it does get pretty packed. The tall seats are on a first come first serve basis though. Feels | In the heart of Huntington Beach Main Street. Coming here during Surf City nights is an additional plus. Feel free to watch a game or even people watch. It's a nice place for almost any type of night. Food: Spinach & Artichoke Dip (A-OK) * Borderline good and okay. Good because it was served fresh and has a nice kick to it. However I wished they balanced the ratio so there's enough dip for the chips. Great White Pizza (Recommend) * Deep dish and delicious, you can't go wrong with alfredo sauce! Ask for some tabasco too. Mediterranean Pizza (A-OK) * Though it is mediteraneany. I personal don't like the olives... =/ Avocado Egg Rolls (A-OK) * I used to enjoy these however I feel like it got more unhealthier. The crunch is there along with the rich avocado however ours was pretty oily and that just made us full before the pizzas came. Customer Service: They were pretty quick with or order nothing too special but good respectable service. Overall: 4 stars. I like the options on the happy hour menu. Price is about right, the wait was reasonable and the food was delicious. Not a bad way to enjoy Huntington Beach especially during happy hour. TL;DR Tips: *RSVP for nicer seats! *Happy Hour | M-F:3-7pm & S-Th:10-Close * Kitchen closes an hour before close"
