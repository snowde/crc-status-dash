Alyssa T.,"Lawndale, CA",107,30,6,2.0,1/13/2009,"First off let me just say that I looove their food. I've never had a bad meal at any of their locations and just thinking about their pizza makes me want a slice right now. The big downside at this particular location was the service. It's right by the beach, so they are often busy with foot traffic but the service was still unacceptable even though I factored that in. My boyfriend and I were told there would be about a 15 minute wait so we had the hostess put one of our names down and we stayed close by. I'd say at least 40 minutes passed until I got fed up and asked the new hostess who just went on duty what was going on. Turns out the other hostess didn't write us down at all! They then seated us as quickly as possible. We were starving at that point and very thirsty on a hot day so I was also let down when they sat us and no one bothered to come by and give us water or check on us for 10 minutes. We were trapped in a weird corner so we got ignored by out ditsy male waiter who would only giggle and say ""my bad"" about everything he did wrong, which wasn't all that funny to me. We ordered an appetizer only to have it come out mere seconds before our entrees so that was rather useless. I usually tip a minimum of 15% but this was the first time I was compelled to tip less. If you want good pizza AND good service, go to BJ's on Beach Blvd right by the 405 freeway instead. Their staff has always been nice and attentive. I once waited a few hours outside with my party but it was well worth it for the good food and friendly waiter."
Sarah H.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,16,3,1.0,11/24/2012,I've always loved BJ'S I always thought there food was delicious and that they had good service. That is until today! We sat at a dirty table in the bar area which wasn't busy and it took 15 mins till someone begrudgingly clean edit after I complained. No water was brought out despite it being requested numerous times. We asked for the food to be split and it wasn't. Such a huge disappointment! I may never eat here again!
Lola S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,5,,1.0,2/3/2013,"We ordered take out on a Saturday night.  Got home an realized that the pizza litterally had no toppings....you really feel ripped off when you expect a certain quality only to find out that they don't take any pride in there take out menu, I guess because you aren''t there to complain.  Annoying.  Ordered food online and when I got there the phone was ringing off the hook, so I had to wait for quite sometime so that they could answer there phones.  So much for ordering ahead."
Noah S.,"Seal Beach, CA",429,106,1,4.0,6/7/2011,"Even though I usually would not go out of my way to support a big chain, I have liked this place since before I could drive. Their beer is flavorful and their food is consistently good. They have one of my favorite deserts too, PIZZOOKIE! it is a fresh-baked cookie still hot in the pan topped with ice cream. I have been to a few of the locations around so cal, and they even have one in lahaina, maui"
Joe R.,"Chino Hills, CA",39,137,1,1.0,8/24/2012,"Service sucked, there was a hair in our chicken....  EEK ME THINKS NOT!"
Kal C.,"Portland, OR",143,601,438,4.0,3/13/2009,"Man, this pizza is good. I haven't really seen it like this anywhere else. I eat the crust like it's nobody's business. And, well...I hardly ever eat pizza crust. The pizookie is awesome, too! My long-term ex and I went here on Valentine's Day and they gave us 2 free pizookies and coupons with little hearts on them. Unfortunately, he's my ex for a reason and I never got to go back after my 2nd visit because I had no reason to visit the area anymore. Too bad they don't have one near me now, otherwise I'd be much, much fatter (wait...that's a good thing)."
J. W.,"San Diego, CA",0,10,,1.0,8/14/2012,"Where do I begin?!  Here are the facts: Checked in with the hostess to get a spot for the patio and waited in the bar. The tables were dirty-glasses, plates, etc. while we sat for 10 min-nobody came by or even looked at us to say they would be right over, or offer to clean the table. I then asked a busser if we had to order at the bar and he said somebody would be over. 5 min later we were paged for our table on the patio-except it wasn't on the patio so we went back to the table to wait.  5 more minutes go by and nobody comes or acknowledges us. I stand up with my credit card to get drinks and a server immediately comes over to get our drink order-so after we placed the order, you guested it! we waited another 5 minutes for drinks-so we are at about 25 min so far for our 1st drink to arrive. We order food immediately and once we get it there is no silverware, napkins, etc. Sooo we have to get it ourselves. Nobody follows up with us until we flag another server down to get another round of drinks, and then another to get our bill. About 10 more things went wrong too but I just don't want to waste anymore of my time on this place. And, I work at a restaurant so I am extremely empathetic to busyness but our waiter really just didn't take any pride in his work. I have also dined at other BJ's and have never had an experience be so poor."
Alex H.,"Lakewood, CA",143,54,9,3.0,2/3/2011,"Been here a couple times with my boyfriend. First time was for happy hour, very good. About a week later, we ordered the same thing for carryout & were very disappointed. Back last weekend for a third try, also late at night. I had an iced tea..extra black! love their iced tea. We started with the pirhanna chili nachos. at first i wasn't so sure..i let my bf pick the appetizer without even looking as to what it was & chili on nachos sounded really heavy. but to my surprise the nachos were really good & super flavorful. the bf had the cajun pasta & we were both surprised by how good it was. the sauce was rich & creamy with just the right amount of spice. i got a small bbq chicken pizza..came to the table extra hot && super delicious!! scarfed down three pieces, gave one to the bf & had the other two for breakfast the next day. yummm :)"
R G.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,8,,2.0,7/20/2012,i had the worst service at this Bjs. I came here to have an early dinner with a friend and figured sitting outside would be nice since it's summertime. We got sat in a squished corner when there was obviously open tables all around. Then it took our server like ten minutes to greet us and by that time we both were ready to order. So we ordered a water and sprite along with dinner salads and mac n cheese. We ended up almost finishing our salads before getting our drinks and when the mac n cheese came it was already cold. I usually love my experiences at Bjs but this time it was miserable.
Kris T.,"Huntington Beach, CA",112,12,,4.0,9/23/2013,"As chain restaurants go, BJ's does a great job! They offer a wide variety of foods in addition to their extensive lineup of pizzas. They remodeled this particular location making it much more attractive and trendy. They have a LOT of sports on the TVs to keep everyone occupied (if so desired). Many of their menu items are non-standard in that they have customized typical dishes to have more flavor and character. My favorite entree is the Moroccan Spiced Salmon served with Sauteed Vegetable CousCous covered with a tasty, mildly spicy, Roasted Red Pepper Sauce. Of course, all of their Pizzas are excellent. Even my old standby, the Classic Combo (Pepperoni, Sausage, and Mushroom), is extremely satisfying. Their full bar has everything you can imagine and they have several unique beers on tap as well. Service is always friendly and efficient. My only complaint is the noise level. When the restaurant is full it is hard to carry on a conversation with your dinner mates as it is just too loud. Other than needing earplugs, or trying to go when it is less crowded, BJ's is a big hit for me!"
Todd S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",1,85,1,5.0,11/26/2013,Always consistently good. We live 5 blocks away and enjoy the variety on the menu
Gary Royale T.,"Orange, CA",990,346,107,5.0,1/9/2009,"This location is located on the busy main street HB where all the beachy party people are at. The floorplan is actually smaller then most BJ's due to its tight location in downtown HB. If you go on a busy day, you will probably have a hard time getting seated within 15-20 minutes.  I went on new years day and was able to get a seat within 5 minutes of entrance. Most times you will just have to try your luck because the line does run out into the street. I am really curious, so what exactly is considered a deep dish here? I got a regular pizza and it was thicker then pizza hut, dominos and round table. I am assuming you get bread with cheese and toppings if you order their deep dish pizza. This is one of the few places where you can order 2 different types of chicken on your pizza. They do charge you double the price of a topping, but that is understandable.  I also ordered the chicken fetucinni and I was few minutes past the lunch hour, but the waiter still hooked me up with a lunch price. I thought that was really cool indeed. I always loved BJ's menu and all the original beer they have on tap. This place in the Surf City USA is definitely worth stopping by if you can't trust those local bars and grills."
William H.,"Irvine, CA",1,23,,4.0,11/19/2011,"Context:  Late November on a Friday night around 11, hungry for some dessert, only place open on main street in Huntington  What we got:  -Red Velvet Pizookie. Consistency was perfect. vanilla ice cream tasted how it should be. I will come back and get this again! -Coffee to help us drive home. It tasted average, but I'm writing this review on the Pizookie. Atmosphere:  not crowded at all, I could hear my friend talk Other Notes: They had Smithwicks beer on tap! I really like Irish beer; so I will be coming back!"
Abe Y.,"Huntington Beach, CA",3,10,,4.0,8/29/2011,"Very accommodating for special needs kids. Try the pizza, salad and dessert combo for two."
Merrilee S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,12,,5.0,12/4/2014,"We went at 5pm on a Tuesday night, when it was mostly empty, and not knowing it was happy hour. I loved my Brewhouse Blonde on Tap for happy hour price. My husband had an IPA as a guest beer for a $1off. The California Club flatbread was full size at happy hour price for only  $6 and was sooo good wiith chicken, bacon, tomato  and a drizzle of ranch dressing. We shared a fresh beet, arugula and goat cheese salad for about $5. I'd take my girlfriends there just for that salad. We added an avocado spring roll with four pieces, that I thought was better than Cheesecake Factory's. We also enjoyed a J Lohr  Cabernet that was on sale as was my yummy Mojito lite. The atmosphere was calmer and classier than I expected, which was a lovely surprise. It usually seems more like a rowdy bar, but if you go early you can enjoy a lovely atmosphere, with attentive employees, and above average happy hour fare. Our bartender was Susan and she was attentive, pretty and friendly. Her bar back with the gorgeous slight pompadour and sideburns could not have been nicer."
Stephanie N.,"Clearwater, FL",376,632,20,4.0,6/10/2007,"Crowd is pretty young and the place is packed.  Servers are young, relaxed and say stuff like ""rock it"" or ""sweet choice""  :)  Its fun though and the food is pretty good if not a bit over done.   Clam chowder was salty and the clams didn't taste that good Wedge salad was good BJ's Favorite Deep Dish was excellent.  My fav portion of it were the crispy edges of the pizza (and normally i'm not a crust kinda gal) Overall good dinner in touristy location."
Teddy B.,"Irvine, CA",0,23,6,3.0,5/9/2011,"They finally bumped out the wall so there's more seating, and added a full bar.  Yes!   Otherwise its just like other BJs with great pizza and brews.  Happy hour specials are pretty good.  A little pricey but its a sit down pizza place so I wouldn't have figured its as cheap as Pizza Hut."
Trent R.,"Seal Beach, CA",11,155,,3.0,4/2/2010,"This downtown Huntington pizza joint is probably the best of the Orange County versions of this chain. This place non-apologetically serves up Chicago deep dish pizza in all of its glory: thick bread-like crust, fresh toppings, and covered with lots of cheese. BJ's was better before they embarked upon a large scale corporate expansion, but the pizza and appetizers are still A-OK. They also sport a fine line of microbrews, and all are excellent. The burgers here are also very good. The service is up and down, influenced by crowds that rise and fall like the tides."
Crystal L.,"Huntington Beach, CA",116,183,31,4.0,3/23/2012,"came here for dinner since slaters 50/50 burger had a huge wait. haven't been to a BJ's restaurant in a really long time so i took some time viewing their menu. everything was pretty much the same as i remember. friends ordered two large pizzas. great white and some hawaiian one. i ordered their chili cheese baked potato ($8.95) and their chicken tortilla soup ($5.95) my other friend ordered the chicken marsala pasta and another ordered the nachos.  first, their baked potato is overpriced. if i actually looked at how much it cost i probably wouldn't have ordered it. as for the chicken tortilla soup, it was pretty good but towards the end it got pretty salty. i didn't try the other stuff, but they all said it was good.  i don't ever crave to eat here, but when i'm here i enjoy the food."
Virginia K.,"Whittier, CA",170,219,3,2.0,2/6/2008,"I came with a party of about 10 and apparently they dont like big crowds because they do get loud... I wish they would have told us this before they seated us and we would have gone somewhere else... They straight kicked us out for being too loud... Hello were a BIG group!! Anyways it wasnt that good! I ordered a snakebite and it was disgusting! apparently in HP they make snakebites with RASPBERRY CIDAR!!!! yuk!! it tasted like Bubble gum! I ordered Pasta for my meal and it was good. Not enough shrimp, but hey its alright. The PIZZA was delicious! I do love pan pizza!!  Anyways don't go here if your in a big group! The manager will come and hush you all up and eventually kick you out! dont get me wrong, I do like BJ's but this location was a little snobby for my crowd!"
