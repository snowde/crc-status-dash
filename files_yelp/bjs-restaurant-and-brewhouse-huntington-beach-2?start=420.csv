Eric F.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,105,2,4.0,4/7/2013,"Probably more of a 3.5 star rating.  I don't care for their pizza and their cajun shrimp pasta used to be great.  Their chili bowl though is excellent.  Bread it comes in is nearly the best I've had.  Another great choice are their hamburgers.  Who would have thought since a pizza joint.  Then, top off with a pizookie."
Amy K.,"Irvine, CA",595,754,1040,3.0,9/29/2007,"This is one of the louder BJ's locations.  Tonight they were packed when we got seated after a 25 minute wait at 8:00 pm.  There were several groups of people in their late teens/early 20s.  It gets pretty loud here, plus there are TVs with sports on, so when it's a good game, bring your ear plugs. The food and service was good.  I had the halibut fish tacos which were very tasty breaded in panko and lightly fried.  The flour tortillas were lightly grilled giving them a good texture, and they use various cabbage giving the tacos a good texture.  On the side, the tacos came with red, blue, and yellow corn tortilla chips.  While very colorful, the chips are just okay.  I did eat some of my friend's seasoned potato wedges, and they were really good!  Once I tried one, I didn't want to stop eating them.  Lucky for me, she isn't a fried-food fan, so I ate most of them off her plate. I also ordered a glass of the lemonade, which turned out to be pink lemonade.  It was nice and tart, and the pink sugar around the edge of the glass was a nice touch.  I wasn't offered a refill on the lemonade, so I don't know if they have complimentary refills or not. For dessert, my group shared two Pizzaokies, one chocolate chip and one half peanut butter and half macadamia nut.  Since I can't eat ice cream (lactose intolerant), I just ate some of the warm cookies.  I really liked the peanut butter and how it was loaded with peanuts.  The chocolate chip was super chocolaty.  Our group of 6 polished them both off. My biggest complaint with this location of BJ's is the restroom situation.  It's a fairly large restaurant, and yet there is only a single men's restroom and a single women's restroom.  When I got there I wanted to wash my hands, and I had to wait in line almost 10 minutes.  Why on earth didn't they make bigger restrooms with multiple stalls?   I did enjoy my dinner, but this location is definitely the worst BJ's I've been to."
Courtney E.,"Huntington Beach, CA",25,11,,4.0,1/23/2011,"BJ's is a favorite of ours. The food is always delicious and we enjoy trying new things off the menu...haven't found anything we don't like!  The restaurant itself is small, so be prepared for a wait, and good luck trying to find a seat at the bar on a busy summer night.  Definitely worth the wait, though, as the food is far superior to other options on Main St."
Cody L.,"Huntington Beach, CA",26,76,1,4.0,5/20/2011,"Good food, Decent service, and a good environment . Good TVs for sports and I hear there is a good happy hr."
Emily P.,"Cerritos, CA",122,353,39,3.0,4/7/2010,"To be honest, I have eaten at this location about a million times and have never once thought about yelping it .. I do not know why .. but I used to have nothing but great experiences here ... for food and service .. HOWEVER: they obviously recently did a remodel of some kind and I must say I HATE IT .. They added an indefinite bar area .. I am sure because it brings in a lot of money and now they have the TV area for sports games and all like surrounding bars etc .. however because they added the bar the dinging seating is very limited and very compact ... I recently ate here .. this past week in fact .. and was seated in the back where it felt like I was next to all my surrounding tables and was immersed in their conversations and families .. The ""booth"" I was sitting in was small and cramped .. only big enough to barely fit myself on one side and one person on the other side .. Very uncomfortable and not what you want to fell when you want to relax at dinner .. If I want to sit that close to my neighbor I will sit at the bar .. Also because the tables are so close the waiters and waitresses are constantly bumping your elbow or you and it is annoying .. Your best bet now is to sit outside which I would have but it was freezing outside"
Kumi K.,"Brea, CA",175,517,282,4.0,9/4/2007,"It's a good thing I'm into salty food. I love salt. As a child I was addicted to salt or anything salty. And I rarely drank water so imagine how my kidney would look like if you cut it open. Probably I could sell it to med student and fetch a good price. DYL is nothing. It's all about DYK now. Saltiness aside, the clam chowder was good. It was thick, creamy and flavorful. Even the pan pizza was good enough for me. And the best cosmo I've had so far. Strong and sweet just the way I like it. The location is good if you're into gawking at people walking by. It's so undignified but its oh so satisfying at the same time. lol."
Cam S.,"Orange County, CA",37,89,12,4.0,3/31/2010,They recently redid this BJ's and it looks great! Much more open and able too look out on main st. The happy hour is amazing.
Vanessa S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",1,7,,4.0,12/29/2010,Love the remodel and the updated menu...only downside is that there are too many good things to choose from!
Steven P.,"San Jose, CA",5,21,,3.0,12/7/2012,Hostess has a real attitude problem. I worked Main St. for a couple of years and it's hard but that's no reason to act like this girl. Everyone else was awesome. The remodel is 100X better than the old restaurant. Food was pretty good.
Tiffany L.,"Santa Ana, CA",3,36,1,4.0,7/6/2009,"I love the pizza there, and especially the cookie desert plate thingy... I forgot what you call it v______v""! The wait is usually 15-45 minutes, depending on the day/hour."
Danielle C.,"Huntington Beach, CA",82,190,13,4.0,1/15/2008,"Let me start this review by stating a little know fact about myself. I LOVE pizza, yes I do, if I could and it were socially acceptable, and I wouldn't gain a million pounds, I would and could eat pizza every day! That said, I have always been a fan of BJ's. There is just something about the thick crust of their pizzas that keeps me wanting more. While this BJ's location is not my personal fave (I prefer the brea location) it is very close to my house and they deliver! Which is the reason they still get four stars."
Adam B.,"Newport Coast, CA",5,1595,,2.0,7/6/2009,Probably one of my least favorite pizza restaurants in Orange County.  The pizza is 90% thick dough with mediocre quality cheese and sauce on top.  I am going to try to never return to a BJs again.
Marc W.,"Highland, CA",1,32,,3.0,10/2/2012,"Well, I've never really been overly impressed with BJ's food.  I think it's more about watching sports and engaging in a social festive atmoshpere and having a few drinks.   Anyway, because we wanted to watch football, my girl and I stepped in for a burger and to watch some games.  I ordered the Crispy Jalapeno Burger and my girl had the Cali Burger.  I suppose the burger(s) were decent--nothing bad nor great.  I like thin cut fries (shoestring) and their fries were really good, I was glad they had the thin cuts on the menu.  My Diet Pepsi was a little bit flat and a bit sweet for diet but whatev, no biggie.  The server really did his best to take good care of us with frequent stops at the table and a friendly demeanor.  The only thing that really bugged is that other servers kept coming by our table offering us samples of other ""things"" they were creating in the kitchen.  I guess it's all in their protocol to advertise and sell their products.  Anyway, we pretty much went their to catch some games and a burger so overall it was as expected.  It's just typical restaurant chain/franchise type food."
Nichole L.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,6,,1.0,9/23/2012,"after my experience calling in an order and being on hold for over 15 mins Im not sure I will order from there again! We live downtown and my family loves BJs so we thought we would order and go pick up our food, well we get there the girl was great taking my money but when we rode our bikes home we realized our order was wrong and missing portions of food! Such a bummer that we had to go through that, the customer service on the phone is horrible and the wait time is even worse!!! Cant say that our food was any better!  Just disappointed in more or less in the service!"
Garrett L.,"Los Alamitos, CA",498,332,76,2.0,11/25/2008,"The first time i went to this BJ's i was with a friend and it was all good until i got the Pizookie. The Pizookie, if you don't know is the awesomely delicious, warm, 10"" cookie they give you with 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream. There are a few types of pizookie's i'm going to talk about the original. But like i said, my meal was all good until i got to the dessert. About half way into the yummy thang, i was about to take a bite....and all of a sudden i saw a hair. This wasn't any old hair...it was curly and had a distinct look to it. I swear it was a pubic hair. I was so sick to my stomach i almost threw up. But see, i'm not going to be the guest who complains and wants a new one. To tell you the truth there would be no way i could eat another one and i wouldn't want to waste it. So instead i left a little note on a napkin with my fork stabbed into the piece of cookie with the cooked pubic hair in it. It said:  ""Give my compliments to the cook, thanks for the pubes in my cookie""  Then i left a small tip and left. I know it wasn't the servers fault so i'm not going to penalize her tip for the idiot who doesn't wash his hands in the kitchen. So from that experience i will never go there again for the pizookie. I might go for the beer or pizza....but if i find a pube in either of those i'm out for good."
Steph L.,"Glendale, AZ",0,14,,2.0,7/11/2012,I understand the location makes this  particular BJ's super busy but the service was terrible. We waited about 10 minutes for 1 beer and an ice water. Our server was super slow and did not check back with us. I will say that the spring roll appetizer thingy was good but definately not worth the bad service we got. I may give BJ's another chance but definitely not at that location.
Brian Y.,"South Bay, CA",4834,357,5169,3.0,6/22/2010,Recommend Outdoor Seating. People watching. Nutty Brunette Brown Ale and PIZOOKIE. AHHHH! yeah. service needs energy drinks. Slow To Roll
J. C.,"Newport Beach, CA",55,143,87,5.0,2/3/2009,"I went to BJ's for lunch with a few of my college friends. They're known for their pizzas and beers. I really like their pizzas, especially the BBQ chicken pizza. If you've got room, try a pizookie."
Jules V.,"Irvine, CA",0,2,,5.0,4/7/2012,"Stopped by for lunch this afternoon with my son. I was greeted by two friendly hostesses and was seated at a table in the back room that had a high chair waiting for me. Scott came over and let me know that he would be taking care of me. He promptly brought over water for my son and I.  He was super friendly and helpful with helping me choose what to eat. We had the mozzarella flatbread to start which was yummy and then I had the Santa fe salad with blackened shrimp. The salad was delicious and I was very happy with my choice. Throughout our meal, a manager and a couple other servers asked how i was doing and even helped to pick up the car my son had thrown on the floor. When i was done with my salad, Scott of course suggested a delicious pizooki and we took him up on his offer and treated ourselves to a mini peanut butter cookie one. Delicious. Over all a very enjoyable lunch. I will definitely be back soon!"
Brendan C.,"Cypress, CA",2,8,,4.0,11/7/2011,Really good food especially the sweet pig pizza.  The root beer that they serve is not that good though.
