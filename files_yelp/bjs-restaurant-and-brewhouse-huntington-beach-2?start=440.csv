Connor H.,"Huntington Beach, CA",47,89,6,4.0,4/12/2013,ended up that my meal was rung up twice. the first time was the wrong price and without me doing anything they fixed it themselves. wtg bj's
Grace T.,"Huntington Beach, CA",101,485,44,4.0,11/14/2012,"i love food from bj's! the white chocolate macadamia pizooki with vanilla ice cream is sinfully good and will leave you licking every bit off your plate. the cajun chicken pasta is really good as well (even though it had a pool of unsightly butter/oil on the bottom of the plate, yuck), i ordered it by chance and ended up really liking it"
Debbie R.,"Covina, CA",1,23,,5.0,9/11/2011,"BJ's on Main Street in Huntington Beach was excellent! From the moment we arrived, the hostess was friendly and helpful. Our server (Charlie) was so sweet. Our family wanted to adopt her!  She handled our large party perfectly.  The food was cooked to perfection! I highly recommend BJ's in Huntington Beach."
Anjelica A.,"Garden Grove, CA",95,49,9,3.0,12/9/2008,"This place is okay.  If you're hanging out at the beach, enjoying a pizza or pizookie here is fun, but being on Main Street, it tends to get busy, and you have to wait outside, and people, since they are already in a hustle and bustle mood, tend to be a little rude and or obnoxious.  Take caution, weekends are crazy.  It is however a nice place to enjoy on a week night, maybe before catching a movie or so."
Ann Z.,"Long Beach, CA",2,160,,3.0,7/26/2010,"I have family visiting from out of town and they wanted to eat some pizza, the food was decent, I think I have had better pizza someplace else or maybe I just don't like the pizza being so thick anymore, we did like the avocado rolls and the soups were really good. I do have to say our service was great, I believe our waiter was Tony and he was really good and attentive. I would like to try this one for happy hour only because its close to the beach and it would be nice to walk down the beach after stuffing your face."
Lan T.,"San Diego, CA",51,39,11,3.0,8/30/2006,"I only come here for the BBQ Chicken Pizza and Pizookies...they are damn good. This one on Main is small and it has no bar and there's only 2 tiny TVs in the back room. They have a front patio but around you is full of punks, drunks, tattoo-piercings-flyer-passer-outers, and of course, the revving engines of hogs and muscle cars. The one on Beach Blvd is like 5 times bigger and a way better place to watch a game."
Robert M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",6,42,,4.0,1/20/2011,Great pizza. Service is about average.  I love to sit outside and watch the people. Lots of freaks in HB.
Thi L.,"San Francisco, CA",0,7,,1.0,4/29/2009,"No offense I love their pizza and beer and typically would give at least 3 stars for BJ overall.  But the problem with this particular BJ is their service.  We came for a late lunch around 3 or so.  so the restaurant was not that crowded.  we asked to be seated out in the patio and was instructed to wait outside.  15 minutes passed and 2 other groups arrived after us were seated, I went inside to ask the host if our table was ready. He actually forgot about us and asked back:uh...how long have you been waiting? (ha)  and sent us back out with an apology and ""someone will assist you right away"" another 10 minutes passed.  i went inside again and this time asked to see the manager.  another apology granted and we were actually seated.  another long wait for the waitress to come around and took our orders.  then the food came out without utensils.  apology again.  then they switched waitresses on us.  the waitress was nice when talking to us but not at all attentive.  we asked to have the heater lamp turned on since it was getting chilly and she actually said they are not working.  Apparently, after we left and strolled pass by later in the afternoon, the heaters were all turned on."
Tiffany M.,"Chattanooga, TN",28,4,,5.0,6/28/2010,"We visited BJ's in early May while staying at the Shorebreak Hotel.  Everything about our visit was great.  We ordered the Spinach & Artichoke Pizza (hands down, best pizza I've ever had), Southwestern Pizza, 7 Beer Sampler (large samples, really enjoyed 5 out of the 7) and BJ's Irish Root Beer (delicious, but a bit sweet to have with pizza).  Our service was fantastic as well.  The only bad thing?  The BJ's located closest to where we live in 450 miles away."
Lisa P.,"Orange County, CA",1,13,,4.0,11/9/2009,My family loves BJ's Pizza.  We have always had very friendly servers and quick service every time that we have been here.  My kids love the pizookies.  My only complaint is they only have one restroom for the entire restaurant.
joes g.,"Huntington Beach, CA",5,24,1,4.0,10/23/2008,after work I like to get the appetizer combo plate with the beer samplers and sit in front of the giant TVs and grub.
Katar I.,"Chino Hills, CA",342,122,22,2.0,4/19/2008,"Ok first off, I do enjoy BJ's. My favorite on is the one by the ontario mills cause the service has always been friendly and good. But I happen to go to this small as BJ's off Main st. in Huntintgton... one of the worst experience in my life. Ok first off it was great that we got sat in like 10mins but this place is tiny, you're bumping elbows with everyone. and there was one bath room stall for each sexes. And there was no bar. No happy hour, pre made cocktails... thank god they had beer. Our server was fine, she just kept forgetting to bring me ketchup. And to top the night... the parking arrangement for that whol complex sucks... I mean it blows! You can only validate at restaraunts on that initial building... I parked at the parking lot near the beachfront grill, and don't get me started on that scene. So I asked if she could validate my parking and she said thats not the yello ticket we can't validate it. No I'm sorry, no ""yeah that sucks, they really should change that"" nothing to acknowledge how upset I am about the situation, and she quickly ignored me to do something else... I work at a restaraunt, and I know how some parking lots can gauge people and I totally take the sides of my guests. I ended up paying 2 dollars for parking cause it was all the cash I had, and its only cash only, I was suppose to pay 4 dollars. Ok, (1. they should make a sign about validations in the structure. (2. Some sincerity would be nice from my waitress. (3. I got sick from eating their sliders there... And when I rate  I usually give restaraunts the benefit of the doubt, cause I know what its like... but this place and the whole complex... Just something about going to the beach where everyone are ass holes... I dunno... I'm more pissed now thinking about it.... so not dissing BJ's, they have a great bar menu and happy hour... but steer clear of this place."
