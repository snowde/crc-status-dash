Joelle H.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,7,,4.0,10/10/2017,The food is great but the service is beyond slow. It takes them about 15 minutes to just give us our utensils and ask what we want to drink. I come here so often and it's sad that the serve just doesn't match up to the reputation of the overall restaurant.
Ryan L.,"Los Angeles, CA",33,3,,1.0,3/12/2017,"My family and me was dinning here and received terrible service first thing we noticed was the silverware was dirty every single one. Second thing was we order guacamole and chips and received a big bowl of guacamole with salsa, we goto order another some more and it has less chips and the bowl of guacamole was small with no salsa. Our waitress was rude she didn't asked if we needed more water. Oh yeah about the silverware she brought us out new ones and we open it up and yes they are also DIRTY! Overall bad experience I recommend not to eat here unless you want to pay to eat with dirty silverware, get cheated out of your food and have to ask for more water."
Jonathan J.,"Newport Beach, CA",3,31,1,3.0,7/8/2017,"This place is not the best. The servers are very nice, but when it gets busy there is a total breakdown. No silverware, no table bussing and the food is mediocre at best. They are a typical chain restaurant that offers nothing that interesting except the great location and friendly staff. I will also say that management was attentive and did their best to make it right."
Taylor Nicole M.,"Pasadena, CA",164,1,,5.0,7/17/2017,"I have to write this review to say Thank You to the staff working yesterday night. I had an extreme sunburn and heat exhaustion which sent my system into shock. I collapsed on the floor of the bathroom. Luckily the staff acted quickly. The manager called paramedics and got them to me fast. In the meantime, Tori (waitress maybe? not too sure) sat on the floor of the bathroom with me and tried to keep me calm. She deserves a raise for being so helpful and willing to sit on a bathroom floor for a stranger. This is not my first time visiting this BJs and it won't be my last. Especially because of the excellent service and help I received in a scary situation I had never found myself in before. Thank you!!"
Chee S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",71,22,4,5.0,12/22/2016,"Updated review, I've come back to BJ's (quite a few times) after my last experience and they have definitely upped their game. You're back on my lunch list! My family and myself dined in on Halloween which was exceptionally busy! The staff was extremely apologetic about the wait and they were super helpful and friendly the entire time. I've also had my fair share of take-out after dining on Halloween and everything has been perfect, so far. I'm happy again!"
John F.,"Huntington Beach, CA",293,8,,1.0,6/4/2017,"Follow up to last months visit for breakfast. We decided to give BJ's any opportunity for breakest and once again were disappointed. We were greeted and seated immediately, from the there it was just horrible. After 10 minutes of not being greeted, offered coffee or water by anyone, we got up and left. There is a serious issue with their weekend breakfast  service."
Stephanie G.,"San Diego, CA",188,11,,1.0,5/28/2017,Been to many Bj's and this one had bad service and bad food. Would have much rather spent my money and time else where.
Sara A.,"San Diego, CA",1203,301,847,4.0,12/28/2015,I went to this location for late night dining. Every place in Main Street had already closed their kitchens. We were greeted and seated promptly and had a delicious dinner and pazookie. We ordered drinks which were a lot stronger than they tasted! I was all around fully satisfied with my visit and am glad to know there's a good option for similar nights.
Paola K.,"Los Angeles, CA",176,173,268,4.0,2/21/2016,"Stopped by BJ's last night to grab a bite before getting our drink on at different bars. Look people, yeah it took some time to get our food and at one point they forgot about my friend's fries but it's Friday filled with a bunch of potentially drunk or (in the process of getting drunk) people. Give them a break. It's busy on a Friday night. I understand so I don't mind and it wasn't even a huge wait. Took about 15 mins for the food. In the meantime, chat with your friends and relax, Anyways, my drinks were good my salad was a bit dry from my preference so I requested extra dressing. It was brought out within about 4 minutes. Our server Kevin (I think)  was attentive despite it being busy. He constantly apologized for the time wait and made sure if we needed anything additional. I appreciate that a bunch. Thanks for taking care of my table."
Emma C.,"Huntington Beach, CA",3,4,,5.0,1/1/2017,I always come into this BJs with my friends to get pizookies and I just wanted to give a special shoutout to Kevin T he is an angel and is so nice. He always gets me refills on my lemonade and gave my friend and I free bday sized pizookies one time. I hope I get him as our waiter every time because hes amazing
Francisco P.,"El Segundo, CA",4,12,7,3.0,4/3/2017,"The food was great, service had an issue with kitchen and it took a really long time for our food to come in but the Manager took care of it, she is a true Boss"
Honda C.,"Whittier, CA",1,2,1,5.0,7/28/2016,My favorite thing to get in bjs is the pizookie and the sweet pig the sweet pig is one of my favorites the have a sweet and savory which I love and when its your first time going to bjs I will highly recommend the sweet pig
Val L.,"Chino, CA",17,3,2,1.0,7/15/2016,"DO NOT EAT HERE I've always had a great experience at Bj's Restaurants, however this particular location had horrible service and horrible food. The server disappeared and never asked to refill our waters or beers. I asked her to please bring ranch for our pizza because our great white pizza was missing the alfredo sauce. She never came back with the ranch. She reappeared at our table with the bill 45 min later.  Better off eating at a local restaurant."
Lynn N.,"Huntington Beach, CA",629,202,287,2.0,11/6/2014,"Happy hour drinks are $4 (strawberry or blueberry mojito and wine). Cheap place for a quick drink and chat with some friends before hitting the other bars in downtown.  The happy hour appetizers are okay tasting - as in mediocre food that was frozen then prepared. Don't expect much.  It's not a place to mingle. It's more of a ""sit down with your own group"" to eat and drink.  The staff is attentive.  The place is relatively clean.  Parking in downtime is free after midnight."
Christopher N.,"Orange, CA",31,4,4,4.0,5/5/2017,The food was OK. The best part about our night there was the waitress. Sarah Beck was an awesome server. Not only did she make sure we were well taken care of she went out of her way to make us feel like we were appreciated as customers. Thanks Sarah
Brandon B.,"Chehalis, WA",109,9,,5.0,4/27/2017,Stumbled into BJ's while on vacation. Great atmosphere. Staff was friendly and helpful. Food was great! I will definitely come back the next time I'm in town.
Carissa M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",4,72,34,4.0,3/15/2017,"I actually haven't been there in a while but just getting my Yelp reviews. I was there a couple months ago for lunch. The service was fantastic at the bar, the tomato soup (& I'm very picky) was DELICIOUS!!!!! Great beer selection and I like the outdoor seating. I run a local burger joint so I'm unable to get out much and typically don't eat out but I do intend on returning to try the Brussels sprouts dish and mmmmm more soup!"
Delena T.,"Garden Grove, CA",213,162,133,2.0,7/24/2016,Service was great but the food is lacking at this location. I am a huge bjs fan and I have loved every dish I've tried so far but at this location everything sorta just fell flat. I ordered their steak medium rare with two sides; clam chowder and rice pilaf. I love a juicy steak but this one was on the dry side and the rice pilaf was very plain. The clam chowder was the only thing that was satisfying. My boyfriend ordered one of the pizzas and the bread was a bit chewy in my opinion. There are plenty of choices to eat at on Main Street but I knew I liked this restaurant so opted to eat there. So sad it didn't turn out at great as all the other bjs I've been to.
Nancy C.,"Alhambra, CA",16,115,677,4.0,7/23/2016,very clean good service nice place to hang out when your bored food are good.  Near the beach people watching side tables
Alicia S.,"Anaheim, CA",11,17,3,3.0,3/26/2017,"Server was nice, but it took a really long time to get food. We ordered steak. I ordered it medium rare and only half of the steak was. Some random guy that works here also told my child to stop using the soap in the bathroom. Eh. I won't return."
