Scott M.,"Aubrey, TX",16,59,19,4.0,4/9/2017,What a fun location. Right in the middle of all the excitement. We had a great time at Huntington Beach and finished it off with some great food. The service was decent but they were fairly busy. The place was clean and a good spot to catch the game.
Sam M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,1,,2.0,8/18/2017,My friend had to ask for ranch three times and had to ask three DIFFERENT waiters. My Caesar salad had a bunch of brown old lettuce scraps in it and a speck of blue cheese. Oh also! The menu had old artichoke dip smashed in between the pages. Very disturbing. Don't recommend coming here.
Dani S.,"Santa Ana, CA",1006,2146,4147,2.0,7/3/2014,"I heart the Pzookie! But the service as TERRIBLE! Came one night because I was craving something super sweet, so we got a seat outside, perfect for gawking at all the weirdo's, hipsters, 909er's, DB's, and tourists during the summer months.  Ordered the white chocolate mac nut pzookie with vanilla bean ice cream. After our waitress brought our drinks and took our order, she never showed her face again for half hour. During which time, we definitely got an eye full of the ""best"" of downtown HB. I had to ask a busboy where was our order half an hour later, had to wait another 10min after that, in which our waitress finally showed up and slapped the thing on our table with a frown and left again, never to be seen. I was so tempted to walk out without paying as I've never encountered such bad service.  Pzookie tasted great as per usual but I would definitely NOT come back for the crappy service!"
Armando P.,"Upland, CA",0,4,,1.0,5/21/2017,I had some of the worst service I've gotten we waited for like 20 min without our server comming he came once took our drinks and never came back he's lucky he was so bad he didn't even tell us his name
Aaron H.,"Irvine, CA",165,3,,4.0,1/4/2017,Ryan is cool he served me beer btw try the committed IPA probably the best to come out of BJ's so far. The raspberry sour is quite sour. Food typical for BJ's the happy hour has changed and isn't as good as it used to be. Bring back old happy hour deals please!
Tim R.,"Corona, CA",33,65,144,5.0,7/7/2016,"Over here at the Huntington Beach BJs, you can expect a crowd on the weekend. There's always bar seating and get the app for weekly specials."
Lauren L.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,2,,2.0,7/13/2017,"I visit BJ's quite often in other cities because I'm usually quite satisfied with their food and service, but this one left me extremely dissatisfied. I went there with one other person and we shared a meal which included salad, entree, and dessert. It wasn't a super busy day, tables were still open, but it took 20 minutes before we were even asked what we wanted to drink. Another 30 minutes for salad, another 30 for the entree, and another 20 for dessert. The food was great and everything, but a quick dinner turned into a 2 hour waiting game."
Samantha M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",261,3,,1.0,6/18/2017,"Came in on a Wednesday night... walked into the restaurant, no one was standing at the greet stand. We waited for about 5 minutes before someone finally walked up to greet us, I think it was someone who worked the to go area because the actual host came to take over eventually. We asked if we could have a table outside since we had noticed some were open but were waiting to be bussed. We were told that table would be offered to he next person on the waitlist. No big deal, could we be added the the waitlist? It was just a bizarre experience with the host because they weren't friendly at all and I felt like I was having to direct the flow of the experience. Normally wouldn't a host offer this to you? I felt like it was more of a ""what do you want"" situation? Anyways.. we were told we could have the next table that got up outside. So we waited outside, watched the table get up and leave and then stood there and watched nobody buss it for 10 minutes.. finally I went and found someone to buss it. They cleared as much as they could but it still needed another trip and a wipe.. and the host was no where to be found again.. finally I look at my husband and we are unsure about whether or not to just seat ourselves? Finally the host comes up to the table and leaves us the with menus. We know what we want and are hungry and ready to order. Our server greets us and was nice and prompt, but the food took soooo long. Our pizza arrives and is not hot but we are so hungry and don't want to wait for a new one. We know we want a pazookie so we put in the order for that which also took around 20 Minutes. No one cleared our dirty plates or silverware from dinner so we are eating our dessert around dirty dishes. We just want to pay and leave. Overall a dining experience that should have only taken an hour to an hour and a half tops took over 3 hours because the host and bussers were MIA and the food took a ridiculously long time. We really enjoy bj's food normally but the team at this location was seriously slacking so we won't come back to this one."
S A.,"Chicago, IL",55,9,1,3.0,12/29/2016,"Decent food, reasonable prices we had to summons bartenders every time our drink needed replenished. Not very attentive"
Angelina R.,"La Mirada, CA",0,4,,5.0,10/6/2016,"Thank You Natalie & Jessica for making the visit extra special! It was me & my twin brother's birthday and these ladies went above & beyond to create a terrific afternoon lunch! Great food, even better service when these girls are in the mix! We'll be back soon. Cheers!"
Darrell H.,"Artesia, CA",51,3,3,3.0,7/16/2017,"Great food just very bad service, refilled water before food arrived but after no help until food was all gone. Maybe because it was Sunday but still needs to be better no excuse."
Mette R.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,1,,5.0,6/28/2016,"We were out with friends last Friday night and everyone wanted something different to both eat and drink-so, BJs was the unanimous vote and everyone was happy. I had one of the best Mojitos I ever had!"
Colleen C.,"Anaheim, CA",0,2,,5.0,6/26/2017,"Stopped in to celebrate my birthday with a quick pizookie and Reed (the host) was lovely when I arrived but made my night extra special with a sweet, caring, positive conversation that literally saved my night. Thanks sweetheart for ending my birthday on a high note!"
Neither Here N.,"Fullerton, CA",23,49,7,1.0,2/25/2015,"I am actually in the restaurant right now. The server was absolutely  disinterested in waiting on our table.  He didn't give us napkins or silverware.  When we asked another server for napkins, he brought us bar napkins. The brown paper napkins that they place by the drinks at the bar...After he brought us our food, still didn't  give us napkins or silverware.  We had to ask him if he would bring us silverware.  The food was over cooked and tasteless,  I ordered a burger, asked for medium rare....I received an over well done hamburger.  The sandwich my guest received wasn't even toasted,  and it was a toasted turkey sandwich....how easy is it to place two slices of bread bread on the flat top. I guess too difficult for their cook.  When the server brought us our beers, they were the wrong ones...how hard is it to pour heffenwisen in a glass? .... Follow directions, get glass, pour beer...serve correct beer. The server continued to pass by without asking if we want or need anything.  He did stop by to ask if I could eat the hard overcooked burger....How kind  No stars for this place...poor service, poor food and as for the beer,  I may have  appreciated it if I had gotten the correct beer I ordered.   No wonder there was pigeons flying around in the restaurant looking for food.... Pigeon by the tables. ... gets 4 stars"
Sadaf Q.,"Huntington Beach, CA",32,119,137,4.0,6/27/2015,"TLDR: Their pizzas and pizookies are what you should try!!  More like a 3.7/5 but rounding up!  Their pizzas are undeniably very yummy! They have many choices and it's a great way for multiple people to order and eat and bond. What separates BJs from somewhere like California Pizza Kitchen is that they have more options on other dishes to choose from. Kind of like a less variety version of Cheesecake Factory and with more pizza.  My favorite of their pizzas is barbecue chicken pizza! They don't overwhelming put BBQ sauce and they have tomatoes on top too. I also like their vegetarian one as well. You can choose to make pizzas without chicken or meat; they aren't sticklers about sticking to exactly the way the menu is written out.  For their other dishes, I've tried the Caesar salad. What I love about the Caesar salad here is that they actually give you a decent amount. You can also add protein on it, which I added salmon! The salmon was really, really well flavored and cooked! I would get this again if I wanted a lighter meal.  But if you're coming with a large group, it's best to go with pizzas and some appetizers!  And for dessert, always go with the 3 option pizookies!!!  You get to try more flavors and it allows you to share as well. One pizookie is too much for me, personally, because it can get really sweet with the ice cream and cookie itself.  Their service is pretty good. Their pricing is also reasonable as well. This place is also pretty good for bigger groups."
Keihlouu F.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,4,,5.0,12/29/2016,I ate here with my girlfriend tonight and the service was incredible. Our bartender Ryan C was really knowledgeable and personable. He recommended me the local tropical pale ale which was delicious.
Jared W.,"Huntington Beach, CA",138,2,1,3.0,7/2/2016,"Burgers are ok. Know when it's avocado season before ordering anything with avocado. When it's not avocado season, you might get hard chunks of underripe avocado in the guacamole and an impossibly thin layer of avocado on the avocado toast. Also, service is consistently meh."
Cedric D.,"Anaheim, CA",5,10,1,1.0,4/18/2017,"A group of friends and I came to Bj's to have an early birthday dinner for me, hoping for some great laughs and great food, but that was the complete opposite. We checked in our party of 11 at 9:00 pm on April 18, 2017 with an estimate wait time of 30-45 minutes. As 45 minutes creeps up our anxious group wanted to know why it was taking so long, so we decided to ask one of the host, how much longer will it take to get seated? She replies that they already have a spot reserved for us but that they're waiting for a party to leave to complete our seats. We understood and proceeded to wait. Another 30 minutes passes by and now we're getting more anxious because they still haven't called us after more than an hour of waiting. We were told by one of the waitresses that the party blocking us from getting our seats has already gotten their check. Another waitress told us she would talk to the party to see if they're ready to wrap it up, she walks towards them but never acknowledges them and proceeds to come back to us and lie in our face saying again ""they have their check."" I had politely walked up to this group of three asking if they were done since we've been waiting for so long, they had told me they're service is horrible and they even had to call another waiter to take their orders. Oh the the funny part is they didn't even have their check and were barely ordering dessert! That made me and the other members of our group outrages. The manager ""Michael Avila"" started sympathizing with us telling us he's ""trying to accomadate us"" when even he told us before that said party had their check. When I confronted him asking why are you telling us they have their check when they haven't even ordered dessert? We understand these people are just doing their job, but lying to our face, giving us false hope of having and ruining my birthday dinner was totally unacceptable."
Samantha Z.,"Huntington Beach, CA",217,74,402,5.0,1/27/2016,Great place nice decor. The service is pretty good but the great thing is its open late the as well as the kitchen! There is an actual healthy menu with pretty good diversity. If you are a beer drinker then this is definitely the place for you! All in this place is awesome also its not widely known but they have a rewards system card!
Harley S.,"Las Vegas, NV",85,1,,1.0,7/18/2016,"This place has got me fucked up. No, for real. The bitch that brought out the food literally fucked up absolutely everything and more. Pretty much made me finger 2 burgers because she doesn't know how to read the damn food ticket. And you seat yourself.. Stupid. I'm not usually this girl."
