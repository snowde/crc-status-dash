Trini T.,"Irvine, CA",1,20,2,5.0,10/26/2017,"Lunch time at this location is so entertaining. Plus you ca get filled up on the lunch menu items (until 3pm). Dana, the ""short, hairy, bald, fat man"" is a great singer. Oh, he pretty good at taking your orders & bringing out the bread.   I got the Shrimp Fra Diavolo & it was the perfect portion, right amount of spicy, & a whole lotta yum!!!  Definitely recommend coming here during the weekday & lunch time to meet Dana. I guess you could get a bit to eat as well.  ciao!"
Alan C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/8/2018,"i'm usually the type of person who'll eat his entire meal in misery rather than bother the waiter, but even i had to send this pure salt burger back in fear for my life.  also no apology.  also our drinks weren't good.  also the host lied saying it was happy hour so we paid full price. here's a haiku tho! burger caked in salt i'd rather live in my tub and eat hard-boiled eggs"
Annie N.,"Los Angeles, CA",59,18,6,1.0,1/8/2018,"Came here after seeing a movie. Haven't been to bjs in probably 8 yrs. Upon walking in, the host told us it was happy hour and sat us in the bar. We ordered a margarita, beer, avocado eggrolls, brew house burger, and roasted cauliflower. The margarita was really sweet. The cauliflower was covered in sauce and soggy. Eggrolls were undercooked and salty. The burger was EXTREMELY salty. Sent back the burger and there server took it off the bill. Came back with the check and all the items were FULL PRICE. It wasn't worth dealing with anymore, gave server FULL tip, and left. NEVER. AGAIN."
Natalie G.,"Los Angeles, CA",458,118,87,3.0,12/5/2017,"BJ's has so many great options and their food is absolutely delicious! This review is regarding their takeout option. I ordered large pazooki for my sister's birthday to be picked up.  The order was done on time and the box was warm. When we tried to cut the pazooki and the pazooki was stuck to the foil under it. My friend who works in a restaurant said that she thinks that they forgot to take the foil out and just put it in the box. It was a little embarrassing because we invited friends over the cookie was a bit of a disaster. We had to flip the cookie over so we could tear the foil off of it. Pazookis are GREAT when you eat in the restaurant. The food is usually good, but this particular take out experience was negative."
Mercedes H.,"Fountain Valley, CA",387,101,533,4.0,9/7/2017,"Have been coming here often for their happy hour! I always have a pleasant experience when dining here, from the wonderful service to the delicious food! The workers are always on their A game with their customer service. Probably the reason why I always come back. The food always comes out super fast! FOOD: Avocado Eggrolls- 5/5: OMG I HAVE to order this when dining here! I'm not a super big fan of avocado but this appetizer is soo yummy! And the sauce it comes with it makes it that much better.  Calamari- 4/5: Love how its not calamari rings but the whole body cut into pieces. Also barely has an batter on it. That's how calamari should be! Portobello mushroom burger- 3/5: Ehhh I love portobello mushroom burgers but the way they cut the mushroom was humongous! The actual mushroom was bigger than the patty.. I took a few bites and I wasn't enjoying it so I had to take it out.  They have a good list of items for happy hour!"
Steffanie V.,"Santa Ana, CA",318,119,467,4.0,8/31/2017,"I enjoy coming to BJs for happy hour it's the closest restaurant to home & whenever I need to get my clam chowder craving in this is the place I always end up at .  Love BJs happy hour, appetizers & beer till midnight ? Why not ! I had came back yesterday and it was extremely packed on a Wednesday night. My friends and I were seated right behind the host since there were no more seats where the happy hour section is. I then asked our waitress if they would still honor happy hour since I came with a party of 8 and they did honor it. We got started with the avocado roll and calamari & I had put in my order for beer . I then decided I was really craving for pasta so I had ordered a grilled chicken fettuccine alfredo pasta.  For a party of 8 our food appeared quickly I was very surprised & so glad since I was starting to get hangry haha . I wished the pasta was more cheesier but not gonna lie it was pretty decent and I sure did devour it . My friends had then order desserts so we ended our night with pizzooki! BJs recently started this churro pizzooki which I was really looking forward to but was a bit disappointed because the churro didn't taste good. The churro yesterday night was missing the cinnamon and sugar it was also too soft for a churro, hopefully they fix that can't wait to try it again !  If anyone is wondering happy hour at night time is 10-12 also I'm pretty sure I'll be returning relatively  soon . Can't ever say no to BJs happy hour"
Cathy M.,"Anaheim, CA",280,1133,1081,3.0,7/12/2017,"Came here last night for their Tuesday half off wine special, which is a great deal! Parking here isn't too difficult after 8pm. There's plenty of seating inside, but my friends and I chose bar seating instead of restaurant seating. They had a 3 for $12 Trio which is a preview of their new and healthier items. We thought we might give it a try. Here's what we ordered: Garlic Knots - These were okay, I personally think I make better garlic knots. It was incredibly dry and lacked any amount of garlic. Eat them while they're still hot, otherwise you're stuck with cardboard. Mac & Cheese Couscous - This was the only decent thing out of the entire trio. The texture of the couscous blended well with the cheese. I definitely enjoyed this dish, I also liked that it was extra baked, so the cheese on top was nice and crispy. Sautéed Spinach & Kale - This was tasteless. It was just onions; some tomatoes, spinach and kale tossed into a little bowl and heated up. There was no taste to it; definitely the worst thing we ordered. **Final verdict for the 3 for $12 trio: I wouldn't try the trio again; I think I would much prefer their actual appetizers over this.** French Fries - This came from their normal appetizers. The fries are no longer thin and seasoned. Now they're just steak cut, salted, and deep fried. You need to eat this with ketchup; otherwise it won't taste like anything. Mashed Potatoes - We ordered this to share. My friend was craving mashed potatoes, and this wasn't so bad. I probably wouldn't eat it alone, but would prefer it as a side with my entrée. Pepperoni Deep Dish Pizza -  1/2 off during HH after 10pm. This was pretty good. It came out piping hot, and I liked how the pepperoni was cut into thin strips so it was extra crispy. The pizza was definitely tiny; you can eat an entire one alone if you didn't eat anything else. I would probably get this again during their HH next time because I really enjoyed it. Estancia Cabernet Sauvignon - Generally sold for about $36 a bottle at BJ's, we were able to get it for $18 for their  1/2 off Tuesday deal. Not bad, it was enough for 3 of us to share. I would recommend this Cabernet, it smells amazing and doesn't taste overly bitter like other Cabernets I've had. Overall experience here wasn't the best. The service was extremely slow; we had to flag down our server several times to get him to bring extra condiments or utensils. However, he was very accommodating despite the slow service. The food took about 20 minutes to get to us, so I recommend ordering right when you get the chance. Nonetheless, I probably wouldn't be back unless if it's their wine deal or lunch."
AL B.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,18,,1.0,1/7/2018,"Dreadful service. We just received our food when they dimmed the lights so much that I couldn't see my dinner. I asked for the lighting level to be raised, or for a candle, or any kind of light. The manager just seemed to find this amusing. He was very unhelpful."
Timothy W.,"Huntington Beach, CA",5,68,25,1.0,7/3/2017,"BJ's is a chain that you can find pretty much anywhere. I've been to several and this particular location several times, but really never have had a great experience with any one.  Their menu is fairly extensive, but that's not necessarily a good thing. Their food, I would describe, as average at best. The consistency is also very poor. At a different location in Nevada, I ordered the same dish several different times. Each time, it was different. Once, the pasta dish, which is supposed to be hot, came out stone cold.  A friend of mine once found glass in his pasta dish at a different BJ's location. But I'll talk about this location.  It's your standard BJ's layout, but it's busy. During peak times, expect to wait 30+ minutes for a table for two.  Our most recent time here, as soon as we sat down and unrolled our utensils, we found both sets to be dirty. Not just a little dirty, but with large pieces of baked-on food. Both mine and my girlfriend's were soiled. We asked for replacement sets and those were also soiled just the same. Disgusting!  We specifically ordered food that didn't need utensils to eat.  The female server, Kayla, repeatedly called me ""hun"" with my girlfriend sitting right across from me. I find that rude and unprofessional.  In the bathrooms, there was no toilet paper or seat covers in the female restrooms.  The beer? I wouldn't bother. If you appreciate good beer, order something from their craft brew menu, not their in-house selections.  My girlfriend ordered sweet potato fries with her sandwich, but was given regular fries and had to send it back.  We will not be coming back to BJ's, not this location or any other."
Tracey N.,"Arcadia, CA",313,103,184,3.0,11/25/2017,"Every time I come here, we usually get a table within 10 minutes.  There is plenty of parking spaces around the restaurant. The service here is quick and friendly.  It's pretty big with indoor and outdoor sittings. The bar area has many big-screen TVs and they usually have sport games on.  However, the food quality here is just mediocre.  Definitely not worth the price they are charging.  They need to put a lot more work into the plate presentation.  This time, I ordered the rib-eye steak with the house salad and mashed potatoes.  The plate came out with a big piece of steak and a scoop of mashed potatoes next to it.  It looked pretty plain! I wish I can say it tastes better than it looks but naa, not really...My friend ordered the fresh Atlantic salmon.  The plate looks yummy but the salmon is greasy with oil. I had the chicken alfredo to-go as well and wasn't so impressed with that either.   It's a nice restaurant but I wish they would improve their food quality because the dishes are so bland."
Katie S.,"Costa Mesa, CA",485,83,167,4.0,5/15/2017,"Ok let's be honest- the pizookies here are 6 stars. AND they let you do a flight of them- you pick 3. I seriously come here just for these lol! This time we got the regular chocolate chunk, salted caramel, and cookies and cream. SO good!  The restaurant is good too. It is a chain but they have a massive drink list and food menu. They probably have anything you're in the mood for. Nothing out of the ordinary, but every time I've eaten here it's been pretty good food. This is one of the few chain restaurants I actually like to come back to.  Service is good and prompt as well.  I'll be back for more pizookies definitely :)"
Mikaela H.,"Costa Mesa, CA",8,83,85,2.0,6/29/2017,"The stars are really only for our server.  I'm not sure why over all these years I still choose to come here because it's never satisfying. Service is usually dull and slow. Food takes forever and isn't that great.  But I love appetizers and have been a loyal bjs customer for years now.  Service : host and hostess are less than enthusiastic. I don't think the person who sat us even said a word.  Our server John was the best  I've ever had at a bjs. He was friendly and helpful. Any bjs I've ever been to the service is close to useless. Like they just bring the food and that's it. He was very different from this and seemed like a server I've had at any other restaurant with good service. So 5 stars for john !  Food : Stuffed Mushrooms - the reason I come here and today they looked like sad shriveled burnt mushrooms. Super disappointed  Boneless wings with root beer glaze : the glaze was good but the chicken was really dry and not enough glaze..  Prime rib dip: super bland, hardly  any flavor and pretty dry. My boyfriend didn't even finish it and he clears a table. Black and bleu burger : well........ there was an eggshell in my burger... so that's all I have to say about that.  We complained about the egg shell and the manager came over and offered to take it off the bill  but we already had a buy one get one coupon. She then offered us a free desert but we were full so I believe it was gonna be left at that until my boyfriend asked to just take off the burger and let us use the buy one get one on our appetizers so she let us use that. So that was nice. Still after all that we spent 40 dollars on a meal that really wasn't worth 10..."
Zach A.,"Anaheim, CA",219,23,,5.0,12/14/2017,"Celebrated my 4 year anniversary with my fiancé tonight & we were fortunate enough to have John N serve us. John is a great server & he's extremely attentive. He apologized for the food & drinks taking long (although we didn't think it took long, considering how busy the restaurant was) & he kept our drinks full.  Not to mention...I overheard a rude customer complain about his drink being low & although the customer was mean, John kept his cool & respected the customers frustration, dropped everything & immediately had the customers drink refilled. I would definitely recommend John as a server if you come to this location. Thanks for a great dining experience, John."
Philip M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,14,1,1.0,1/6/2018,I came for the Saturday brunch as I normally do and was greeted by a pounding rock music background. I requested they lower it a bit but they didn't. I asked for the manager since I come here all the time and know from experience it was really loud. He came out smirking and said he lowered it in two adjacent rooms but not the one we were in. A true smart (bleep). When he left for the back room the sound was lowered to normal in two seconds. So it could have been done easily before.   I love background music but for some reason this morning the guys working the place wanted it to pound you senseless. Besides this morning manager being a (bleep) I really enjoy the good food and waitresses I know over the years.  I'm giving this place one star because they need a better morning manager and not a complete freaking (bleep).
Mike B.,"Harrisburg, OR",69,14,5,4.0,12/19/2017,Of course the pizza and pizookis are great but for something really special try the root beer glazed ribs!   Incredible.   The servers are generally friendly and efficient and most of the food is good.  Have had issues at some other bJ's but this one is always fun and delicious.
Patty V.,"Cerritos, CA",7,29,1,4.0,1/2/2018,So I wasn't a Bj fan... But decided to give it a shot one more time. Excellent happy hour place. Love the happy hour times. Food became much better than before.. But I still do miss their Pesto Pizza
Kristine T.,"Westminster, CA",2,10,4,2.0,9/14/2017,"This review is for their delivery service. I highly recommend to NOT use their delivery service. Thursday night dinner basically turned into a midnight snack. I called the restaurant and the person who picked up the phone stated the delivery service typically takes around 30 minutes. It took them over an hour and a half to deliver our order and we live approximately 10 minutes from the restaurant.  When the food finally arrived, it was cold. Cold pizza and cold brussel sprouts. Terrible! Sorry BJ's, but your delivery service is absolutely horrible. Not sure if I would even come back to dine-in at this restaurant anymore. So disappointed. Edited: *Giving an extra star to their manager that night, Ryan, for sending the delivery person back to give us red peppers and parmesan that we specifically requested for in the special instructions section. (Thank you, Ryan!)*"
Amy L.,"Costa Mesa, CA",457,142,372,1.0,1/9/2017,"I really wanted give this restaurant another chance and after today, it confirmed why I won't be returning. Upon being seated at our table, there was a tablet we had an option to order from. We attempted and failed.  I mean, we are quite tech savvy and needless to say it was embarassing we couldn't figure it out and luckily a server took our order instead.   Anyway onto the food. We ordered the spinach artichoke dip and a buffalo pizza. Food came out super slow and it wasn't busy at all. When it did finally come out, chips were all broken crumbs like those you'd find at the bottom of a bag of chips. The pizza was mediocre and wasn't even hot. Quality was lacking. Luckily the best part was how easy it was to pay on the tablet and get out.  It's a shame we didn't get the ""Manager's special"" treatment as with other patrons during late dining."
Mitchell W.,"Huntington Beach, CA",4,37,9,1.0,8/30/2017,"Update... Thought I would give this place another chance.  I shouldn't have done that. Once again cold, tasteless burgers, warm salads. Don't bother with this place unless you want beer. Maybe the beer makes the food taste better?  Even then, you are better off at TGI Friday's, I hear they have Pizookies now too."
Danny N.,"Garden Grove, CA",11,81,13,5.0,8/2/2017,"My favorite place to go for plenty of different things like pizza or... Other things... (I think I mostly always end up getting pizza despite craving something new at BJ's... They just have really good pizza!) I like this place so much that I actually got their app and boy is it handy; most meals you'd go here for end up giving you plenty of points anyway so it's definitely worth looking into. Not like it costs you anything to get their app anyway. Their pizookie obviously is delicious but I'd really recommend smaller sizes unless you're sharing with a party because they get really tiring and I have a huge sweet tooth. Some honorable mentions: I REALLY enjoyed their pink lemonade, their dry rub wings (lemon pepper), the avocado eggrolls (expensive and small though), the strawberry beignet, their pizza ofc, and practically all of their pizookies (except the gluten free one, never tried that, never will)."
Lana N.,"Garden Grove, CA",1757,312,3307,5.0,12/3/2016,"For a chain restaurant, I love going to BJ's and this location is particularly my favorite.  The customer service at this location is excellent. On an extremely busy Friday night, the food was taking a little bit longer than usual and the manger came out to personally apologize about the delay, which was a very nice gesture. When the food finally came out, every server who gave us the food was extremely helpful and nice, despite how busy they been all night long. One of the server even took time out of his busy night to scoop pizzas on our plates for us with a big smile on his face! I love the customer service here!  The food at this location is also the best (& trust me, it's not the same at every BJ's). The food & dessert is always baked & cooked just perfect!  PS, Don't forget to sign up for the BJ's rewards card!"
Ashley G.,"Lakewood, CA",75,30,2,2.0,10/8/2017,"Okay where do I start..... I've been coming to bjs since I was in high school and it's had it's ups and downs but this experience was by far the WORST. My boyfriend and I came in around 6pm on a Sunday. Of course it's busy and we understand there's going to be wait. The girl at the front told us it was going to be about 10-15 mins. Okay, no problem. So we are waiting and waiting and it's been about 30 mins and were wondering what the hell is going on. So finally, my boyfriend gets up and goes to see what is taking so long. You guys, the hostess FORGOT to put our name in. So then they tell us it's going to be another 5 mins. Back to waiting. They finally call our name and try to seat us at some tiny ass table against the wall with 50 million kids around. Like a chuckie cheese section of Bjs. Wtf, ummm no. So we finally see a table open by the bar and we take it.  So far, things are good. Our waitress is super nice. We ordered our food: half Mediterranean and half bjs favorite pizza and some chicken wings. Then we get our pizza, and it literally looks like the cooks threw a bunch of shit on there. I said half and half you guys and I got a mixture of every ingredient known to mankind. So I notify the waitress. She was really sweet and agreed it looked like vomit and took it back to the kitchen. Eventually, we got a new pizza made properly, the right way. The only thing good about this night was the waitress. It's too bad I didn't get her name to compliment her service in this review. But everyone else: the cooks and the hostesses, you guys suck at your job. So at the end of all this we ended up spending $50 for a shitty experience at Bjs. Please do something about this location corporate!!!!"
Craig F.,"Fullerton, CA",1954,563,4131,3.0,11/29/2016,"Berry Burst Cider... That's what we head to BJ's for (well, at least for my SO)...that and a relaxing booth in the bar area...that and to watch a game...that and, most likely, a half-n-half specialty pizza to share: pepperoni on one side, mushrooms on the other!  For us, going to BJ's is pretty predictable.  Variances merely include the games, like ""who's playing who.""  Other than that, clockwork. Despite the fact that it's an ""A-OK,"" (three of five stars seems rather dismissive, I realize), but it really is the Berry Burst Cider that initiates our return.  The service is what you'd expect: corporate, scripted, standardized.  The pizza's tasty; however, I don't know anyone who's placed BJ's pizza on their favorites list.  But BJ's is a great place to gather with friends after work, to catch up a little, have a drink, and get a quick bite.  (Come to think of it, BJ's would probably consider me a 3 of 5 as well.)  I'm good with that."
Janet R.,"Anaheim, CA",558,5,1,1.0,1/7/2018,"Called in the day before for a group reservation for  a party of 15 for 1pm in the patio area that they have. The next day I called in 5 minutes before I arrived to the restaurant and the employee who answered said they didn't have any record of our reservation and that there's another reservation for the same patio area for a party of 22 at 2pm. Mind you, we had family driving all the way from Corona and Oceanside, we could've gone to another BJ's on the way, but was really hoping to have our family gathering in that patio area. The manager then gets on the  phone and apologizes for the miscommunication and says that only managers can take reservations, but the employee I spoke to the day before mentioned nothing about that. We had a smaller group so we got bumped pretty much. Not cool. I still love BJ's, but we will no longer be visiting this location in Huntington Beach."
Mary L.,"Pasadena, CA",133,184,217,4.0,7/4/2017,Huge selection for food and drinks. Pretty loud but fun. Next to a dead end street u turn on beach to enter parking
Shareen D.,"Orange County, CA",104,235,24,4.0,7/27/2017,"Came in on a Wednesday evening with my friend and it was so packed! We put our names down and thankfully we only had to wait 15 mins until we were seated.  I ordered their new berry hibiscus tea which is unsweetened and I asked the waiter to put a splash of lemonade in it and it was just the right amount of sweet since I don't really prefer sweet beverages. I wasn't too hungry so I just got their spinach artichoke dip which is probably my favorite- it's so rich and creamy and just so delicious!  My friend ordered the chicken alfredo but she said her pasta was a little dry.  For dessert we got the pizookie trio: churro, original, and triple chocolate. I'm a chocolate fan but their triple chocolate is a little overwhelming, it tasted heavily of cacao. The original is my go-to and the churro was soooo good! Can't go wrong with pizookies!  I wish I remembered our waiters name but he was very efficient and friendly and he always came by to check on us. I like this location!"
Carl N.,"Westminster, CA",0,7,,1.0,1/7/2018,"Came on Saturday night, the place was packed. waited almost 1 hour before we can get in, we ordered the sea food pasta. burger and house pasta. Waited another haft an hour before the foods came out .The foods tasted like the ones you bought at the frozen section in the supermarket. The waiter brought the bills over while we still  eating. Never go back again."
Trisha H.,"Huntington Beach, CA",97,14,2,2.0,10/26/2017,"Order dinner to go tonight and my family got the rib special. I don't like ribs so I got the SHRIMP and penne pasta. It's comes with Marinara but I'm not a huge fan of so I got garlic butter sauce. My mom gets home with the food. Open my container to see chicken instead of shrimp, a very dry no saucy pasta, and not all the way cooked pasta. So basically a waste! Thanks bjs! 2 stars cause I guess my family gets to eat tonight. But apparently one of the poozkies was burnt. Maybe this is why I never go to bjs anymore ha"
Abby C.,"Norwalk, CA",447,6,2,1.0,9/27/2017,Horrible service.  The waiter seemed nice but we had to flag him down numerous times and I'm more than sure he forgot about our table. I came in around 930-10 on a Tuesday and they usually have $3 pizookie days and the last time I went to this location was almost 10 years ago. Only ordered 1 to share and 1 beer. Really simple order. We waited for our pizookie for over an hour. The cookie was close to room temperature with the sides burnt/almost charred and the ice cream melted. Waited another 30 mins to flag him down for the check. I understand it can get busy closing up/handling many tables at once but it shouldn't justify inadequate service. Don't think I'll ever go back to this location again.
Laura S.,"Seal Beach, CA",2,47,42,3.0,10/21/2017,"Third time this week to watch the Dodgers win NLCS and the ALCS finals. Crowds were not so bad. Ordered a special reserve with Habanero Chile and pineapple for a couple of nights but they ran out tonight. I really recommend it by Four Sons. Seasonal beer with pumpkin was good but you have to have a cold glass. Bartenders and servers recognize you after a few days. Happy hour during the week best deals. Food is decent I was disappointed in the Ahi salad I spent $16 on yesterday, so today was chips and queso dip the chips are awesome. Dessert was really good the Beignet with strawberries and ice cream can't go wrong. Recommend the hot wings with bones really good and meaty. Great place to meet people or go on a date. Lots of TVs so everyone can watch what they want."
Tamara-Michele C.,"Huntington Beach, CA",718,68,12,5.0,11/22/2017,"This place was awesome. It's the same as any ol BJ's restaurant but this one has a waitress named Lauren and she was absolutely amazing! Extremely friendly, knows the menu well, took care of us from beginning to end!! We will absolutely be back because of her alone. Thank you lauren for such great service! We will gladly wait to sit in your section the next time me are there!"
Ryan G.,"Westminster, CA",21,78,32,1.0,12/4/2017,"Bit odd tht majority of photos on a consumer app are from ""business owner"". food network takes pretty good photos of food too yet we know it's never the same. Get real. No need for trump tactics. Scroll through a couple years of co posted photos then compare the ""mushrooms"" from customer photos Vs company photos.  (Not just mushrooms for the point made)"
Cheryl N.,"Huntington Beach, CA",148,156,10388,4.0,10/7/2016,"My last visit, I was disappointed but I decided to give it another try. The last time, the server said she would figure out for me to either use the $10 coupon for a $35 purchase or used the happy hour discounts on drinks and apps, I trusted her and found out I was out of about $4 when I got home. The drinks used to be $6 for a mojito, now its only $1 off, which brought the price to $7.50, quite expensive. The pizza was kind of soggy, the crust was not crispy This time we had a really nice chap, his name was Preston, it was an unusual name so no family name was needed when I give him this shout out!. We used the $10 coupon from checking in on Yelp. I had the Jambalaya, it was fresh and flavorful but much too hot, they must have sprinkled 1/2 a bottle of paprika, the next time I will for sure request less paprika. My husband ordered the pasta with shrimp and asparagus, the sauce was phenomenal, the fired grilled taste was just out of this world, we complained the asparagus was too chewy, mostly the stem, we saw no tip, Preston brought me another plate of freshly cooked asparagus with tips, really tender and flavorful, we were totally impressed with Preston's fast service and good customer service manners. Preston also gave us a free pizookie, it was really delicious, my previous experience with pizookie was not as good. BJ mojito was the best in the world, what I had in Little Havana was outrageously priced for a 3rd rate Mojito. The mojitos I had on all my cruises, they were all no good!!! Preston had a solid 5 stars rating! and BJ has definitely 4 stars, the corporate bosses really cared, I received email from them all the time for coupons, etc..I can't wait to go back there for the shrimp pasta again."
Sue B.,"Westminster, CA",0,10,14,1.0,1/10/2018,"Ordered dinner for the family last night because I was craving their chicken tortilla soup.  Made the order online, I know that it will never be ready on time but I'm always hopeful.  Get there pick it up and get home...no tortilla soup!  The one thing I really wanted.  So I call and it rings and rings.  Finally someone picks up and I share I didn't get my soup.  They apologize but that's it.  I have to drive all the way back while the family sits and eats without me.  I like their food but it's pretty much guaranteed that they don't get the order right.  Last time I ordered for work and got day old lettuce for my salad.  We had to throw it out and share another meal.  I think it's sad when a large corporate restaurant like this has such poor quality control and lack of pride to ensure their meals are correct.  I won't be going back for a long time.  Too bad because I really did like their soup."
Jessica E.,"Garden Grove, CA",363,37,20,5.0,11/26/2017,Our waiter was very nice & friendly. Always attentive. We had brunch which I forgot they have. Egg tacos were great and the monkey bread is amazing. The drinks were all great. Had plenty of alcohol. Definitely recommend BJs !!
Cor V.,"Westminster, CA",0,383,294,4.0,12/6/2017,"BJ's restaurant is on the way home and we stopped in for lunch.  No worries about parking, there was plenty.  We had a very friendly greeting and I liked that she immediately asked if we were member of the BJ rewards program.  I noted that they couldn't find me last time, but somehow my cell number got us in.  So, I can start accumulating again, must have lost 125 points in the meantime.  Oh well, lets order with Becca our server.  I had the tomato/mozzarella salad.  Balsamic dressing over the tomato/mozzarella salad was great, but, this salad should have more than just half a cut up (Roma) tomatoe in it, the mozzarella cheese balls and the balsamic dressing made up for the tomato inequality.   The smaller lunch portion of the southern fried chicken breast came on top of a dollop of buttery mashed potatoes.  A whitish Gravy covered the fried chicken breast and the mashed potato was surrounded by  dried out kernels of yellow corn.  The chicken, however, was  well seasoned and had a good crispy batter.  For dessert we ordered the monkey bread with vanilla ice cream.  Wow, now that was a good choice.  We will be back."
Zachary M.,"Costa Mesa, CA",16,3,,1.0,12/8/2017,This BJ's was beyond horrible. Our waitress hardly attended to us. We had to stop and get her attention since she seemed to go to the table on the other side of us more. Got the prime rib special and my order was incomplete and lukewarm at best. Seems like to employees are more focused on themselves and their friends than the customers!!!!
Lisa M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,3,1,3.0,12/10/2017,"Usually a go to spot for quick lunch with good food and drinks. Today horrible.  Forever to get a beer and wine,  extra crispy pizza came out soggy,  sent back and the same pizza came out black and burned. Very disappointing experience"
Nima I.,"Santa Ana, CA",198,2,,2.0,12/12/2017,"Went in to order for take out and waited almost a little under an hour to get desserts I ordered enough for just two people. Despite the busy dinner hour there should've been more than one worker taking care of the ""take-out"" side of the restaurant."
Lisa S.,"Los Angeles, CA",554,32,,5.0,8/11/2017,I'm usually very hard to serve and picky when it comes to eating at bjs since I worked for the company for over 3 years. But tonight's dinner was worth mentioning! We came to watch the football game and figured this would be a good option for the adults to enjoy a beer while having a one year old with us. Our server tonight was Marcelo and he was AMAZING. He brought us a little snack for the one year old to keep her calm and occupied which in and of itself was above and beyond. He was very attentive and checked on us the perfect amount of times and was able to talk us into a pizookie for dessert. He is honestly probably one of the best servers I've had at any bjs! I no longer live in this area but I will be sure to always ask for him if and when I come back!  Thanks for the gold star service Marcelo!
