Daniel H.,"Huntington Beach, CA",187,1,,1.0,6/11/2017,Our waitress was very rude. She had the attention span of a 2 year old and was constantly asking for tips.
Monique L.,"Garden Grove, CA",13,16,43,5.0,3/21/2016,"Came here for my 21st birthday! We ordered potatoe skins and mozzarella sticks as appetizers, both were super yummy! I ordered the chicken Alfredo and it was perfect. Our waitress, Ashley, was super sweet and attentive! She made me feel special on my special day by writing a little ""happy birthday"" note on the receipt, I thought that was very thoughtful of her. One of my favorite locations, never seems to disappoint."
Jay T.,"Garden Grove, CA",0,2,,2.0,11/8/2016,Bad service and the food was eh. We wanted to order dessert but waiter came back with a check instead of asking us if we were ready to order dessert. We had to wave for our refills as she was Busy with the other table as well.
Amanda D.,"Huntington Beach, CA",135,61,28,1.0,7/19/2016,"It's taken me two weeks to calm down before I even tried to write this review... I will start a month ago...  My husband, 2.5 year old daughter & I were sat in the back room, straight through the bar.. Where they usually sit us.. We were sat at a table when there were 2 booths open. Ok.  Every table seemed to have a different server, so we waited patiently.  After both booths were filled, we started getting annoyed that nobody had even greeted JUST OUR TABLE; Making eye contact with each of the other tables servers. After the second booth was sat, a waitress came out took their drink order and went to go get them...  We left. And because my husband is on their rewards program (SUPER FREQUENT CUSTOMERS) the manager was able to call him and offer us to come back... No thanks.  Two weeks ago.. Evelyn was our waitress. (Pretty sure it has an 'i' in it.. Autocorrect)  After my husband ordering a small cheese pizza, and broccoli cheddar bread bowl... I over heard the table of girls behind me complain about how their server got their orders wrong.. Didn't think much of it. Our waitress comes by and gives us our second round of sodas.. And tells us that the kitchen messed up and made him a mini cheese and mine would be out soon. My husband tells her to wait on them and bring them out together. To which she returns to our table with this mini cheese pizza and me, nothing.. She comes back 10 minutes later and asks if everything was ok. So I gesture to my empty table and say 'um no not really', her response is 'it's coming soon' . She returns a minute later and has a young gentleman tell me he will be taking over our table because she has to go home. I'm not kidding when I tell you red hot steam had to have come from my ears when the food runner set down A SECOND PIZZA on our table, because the manager came over.  TWO PIZZAS BEFORE ONE SOUP?!  What is wrong with this picture?!  All the manager has to say is the generic 'sorry'..'it's on the house'  What is?! HIS dinner? Yea thanks!  Meanwhile the manager asks if I want to take the soup home with me.. Um no thanks. I wanted to eat dinner with my family.  Next thing I know our waitress is asking her next table what they want to drink.  Ps. The pizza that night was bogus. BOTH of them! Nothing but bread. Hardly any sauce and even less cheese.  Oh and I witnessed her trying to bring us a check as we were getting up.. The manager motioned with his hands back n forth across his neck with eyes open real wide.  We won't be back here.  And I wish I had gotten his name so I could call about this, to the corporate office."
Susan M.,"Costa Mesa, CA",0,16,,3.0,5/27/2017,"We had a very nice meal as a late lunch. The only thing we didn't like was the coffee, which tasted burnt- the waiter quickly replaced our coffee with a fresh cup, it was nasty too. Oh well, they tried! The wait seemed long as well , they weren't that busy. We'll try again, though, as the entrees were quite nice ( ribs and Peruvian quinoa)"
Amanda D.,"Orange, CA",479,101,42,2.0,8/16/2016,"There are only 3 things you order when you come to BJs: alcohol, PIZZA or pizookie. If you do not heed this warning and order something else, you're just asking for a world of misery because you'll constantly be asking your server for additional sides or condiments or complain about how salty and how your actual dish looks unlike the picture in the menu. This of course did not happen to me because I didn't listen to my own instinct so I cannot blame anyone else but myself. But DAMN my dish was extra extra salty. I asked for extra brown rice and it helped a little... My server was completely sweet and nice and I didn't have the heart to tell him how awful my dish was. People.. Do not blame the servers for not getting your dish right or if it doesn't come out in a prompt time... It's not their fault.. Think about it. Have you seen them carry 5 plates with two hands? That is skill my friends. It is NOT skill to pour a cup of salt in a baked Mahi Mahi dish.  Sigh... Pizza. Alcohol. Pizookie. This is the rule. Do not stray from it."
Yelp Is Bullshit B.,"Irvine, CA",24,152,14,1.0,11/12/2015,"I have been here many times, ordered many items, come back because of just this one item on their menu:  Santa Fe spring rolls.  It's simple, light, easy to eat and digest, not too fattening.  Would I come back again for this? No.  Service has been terrible during the last few visits, pretty much at the point of being nonexistent.  I guess they don't need customers to come anymore. Food = Not good 1/5 Customer Service = Bad 1/5 Curbside Takeout  Service = Terrible 0/5 Environment = Decent 2/5 Cleanliness = Questionable 2/5 Overall Satisfaction = Will not return 1/5"
Victoria T.,"Garden Grove, CA",135,21,270,1.0,8/7/2016,Sigh... Been sitting here for 15 mins with at least 3 waiters walking back and forth passing my table without asking if I needed water or anything. Come on man. It's not even busy.. there's 3 of you guys juggling 4 tables lol really that hard?
Celine V.,"Beverly Hills, CA",14,53,48,5.0,4/18/2015,"Bj's brewhouse is well known for their pizookies as well as it being a great place to celebrate birthdays and go on dates!  Angel hair pasta: they have these tasty sun dried tomatoes in the pasta which add so much flavor to it! The shrimp is very well cooked and tastes phenominal!  Lasagna: My boyfriend at the time ordered this and I was astounded because it was the best lasagna I had ever tasted in my life! Oh noo, now I'm craving it!"
Yadira R.,"Anaheim, CA",69,22,19,5.0,9/8/2016,"I had lunch here with my family on Sunday and I just wanted to note that this location had great service! Kristen, our waitress, was very attentive, kind, and accurate.  She got all our orders correct, brought our drinks out quick and overall made it a memorable experience.  I briefly mentioned that we were celebrating 2 birthdays and at the end of our meal she brought out a birthday pizookie for each of the guests.  Oh and I recommend the Hopstorm IPA if you are into that type of beer. Delicious!"
Miguel P.,"Garden Grove, CA",33,21,1,2.0,7/16/2016,"1-2 years ago this was my favorite place to grab a bite to eat, but sadly the items on the menu have changed and so has my favoritism. My go to plates were the chicken lettuce wraps and the chicken alfredo. Sadly the food creativity and craftsmanship has downgraded. The meals no longer look complete. The lettuce wraps contain chicken that look like slices of grilled chicken breast thrown into a bowl rather then being sautéed with the sauce. The chicken alfredo's lengthy delicious garlic bread has been reduced to a small twist of bread. Good food at BJs is a distant memory."
Maianh H.,"Westminster, CA",58,62,101,3.0,4/12/2015,"BJ's is a chain restaurant. Note to self: don't have expectations too high.  First and foremost, I used to love BJ's when I was younger! I don't think the food has gone down hill, I just think I've been enlightened by many delicious foods so now BJ's is mediocre. It sure does the job though. We ordered potato skins, BBQ Chicken Pizza and a chocolate chip pizookie. Potato Skins These potato skins are fried then adorned with cheese, bacon bits, and chives. Very tasty but the potatoes themselves could use some work. They were dry and hard.  BBQ Chicken Pizza Again, I used to LOVE BJ's but I found my recent trip to be overwhelmingly underwhelming. The pizza crust was soggy, the bbq sauce tasted artificial and the chicken tasted frozen. I was very unsatisfied with this pizza. Pizookie The pizookie was perfect!! It's a warm, soft and gooey freshly baked chocolate chip cookie topped with vanilla ice cream. Scrumdiddlyumptious! Our waiter was not anything out of the ordinary. It was a day before my sister's birthday so I asked her if she could bring a surprise pizookie to the table while my sister was in the bathroom. I guess homegirl forgot and asked us if we wanted dessert after we were done with our meals. Super awkward because I tried to lowkey remind our waiter that I had already asked her to bring us a surprise pizookie. Our waiter couldn't pick up my hints so I had to blow the surprise and remind her in front of my sister. Annoying but whatever  Meh, I'll probably be back but NOT when I'm expecting a quality meal. In fact, no one should go to BJ's and expect a quality meal. Extremely decent at best. Location at the block is better!"
Tracie L.,"Orange County, CA",1056,629,3145,3.0,6/20/2013,"Came here for Father's day w/ the fam bam, thank god their call-in reservation system worked otherwise we would have had to wait for hours. So sadly enough it was our family's first time ever trying BJ's, my dad wanted to go 'cause of the free Father's day pint glass & I guess there was a dish he liked in the mail-home flyer ad they sent. Our waiter seemed frustrated the whole night by giving us service w/ an attitude, that was a no-no for me especially on father's day. However, I give him props for getting all the modifications correct for our food. Started off w/ the thai shrimp lettuce wrap appetizer. HIGHLY recommend you start w/ this to open your stomach. It's very light and refreshing, the shrimp was not overcooked which is a plus. The sauce complemented well w/ the mango salsa in the lettuce cups. There were plenty of shrimp pieces as well (I think about 3 per lettuce cup)  Maui Glazed Porkchop - I've been on a pork chop crave and so I decided to get this. I should have figured that since it was on the under 575 cal menu it would be a small portion -__- It was ONE pork chop, instead of potatoes I subbed for steamed veggies. The veggies were perfectly steamed not too mushy and not salty. The pork chop could have used some work. Didn't really get much flavor from it and it was really small. I should have just ordered the regular 2 pork chops one BBQ Chicken Pizza - Mom ordered this dish since I told her per reviews the pizzas are bomb. However, mom was highly disappointed. There were a good amount of chicken chunks on the pizza which I liked 'cause I hate skimpy toppings, but according to my mom she liked Papa John's better =\ The pizza was also cold when it arrived Salmon Terriyaki - my sis ordered this dish, I have to say this was probably the best dish out of everything we ordered (wait nvm the shrimp lettuce wrap was). It was actually pretty expensive for this dish (about 17$) but I think the only reason it tasted good was cause it was drenched in terriyaki sauce. It was definitely a big portion, but most of it was rice... Chicken fettucini Alfredo - My baby sis ordered this and well she has the taste bud of a 13 year old so she said it was good, but the dish looked bland compared to Cheesecake Factory. The chicken breast was so small...HOWEVER the garlic butter bred that came w/ the dish was AMAZING! Everyone devoured the bread. It was really soft and warm Mahi Mahi w/ Scallops - Alright Star of the show, DAD ordered this dish. I think it's a great combo deal (bout $16), and on the ad it looked really good BUT when the dish arrived it looked nothing like the ad (go figure). The mahi was so small like literally my fist size and so were the scallops. The mahi was definitely over cooked, but the scallops were good. My poor dad was disappointed in his dish and just picked off the Salmon Terriyaki plate instead. CHOC CHIP PIZOOKIE - Ok we HAD to get this dish. It's amazing it took this long before I tried the pizookie since my friends always rave about it. It was SOOOOOOO good. Warm ooey gooey choc chip baked w/ scoops of vanilla ice cream. Everyone loved this dessert. I shoulda got the trio to sample the other flavors. So to summarize it up, I probably would only go here for the pizookie or if I'm seriously watching my portion control on food. Otherwise I'd stick to cheesecake factory 'cause I'm a girl w/ a big appetite"
Samuel N.,"Fountain Valley, CA",266,27,8,4.0,12/22/2015,"I'm sad that this place isn't rated higher. I mean, if you're going there for the first time then try their pizzas and beers and don't come on a busy weekend. If you want a deal then come on their happy hour times and sample around with their mini pizzas. You also get a dollar off on beers, cocktails, and wine when you sit in the designated area. I really recommend their Jeremiah Red Ale for anyone getting into beers. It's crisp and light with enough body but not too overwhelming for beginners. Hefes are always nice too if you're into lighter drinks. Aside from those, if you want to try other things, their pastas and pizookies.  Finding close parking might be hard on game nights but it shouldn't be hard to find a parking. I never really had a bad service so I can't complain there. I would give a 4.5 since it can be pretty expensive for what it is. Overall, I find that this is a great place to kick it with friends when you're indecisive."
Tera K.,"Fountain Valley, CA",142,47,157,4.0,2/28/2016,"Great servers! We had some several misfortunes today, but regardless, they handled the situation very smoothly! There were several huge pieces of baking sheets in our pasta and Pizookie; however, they sincerely apologized and was extremely nice. We also spilled our drink but right when that happened, the timing could not have been more perfect. They instantly cleaned up the table with a dishcloth in hand. Although finding the parchment paper in our food was a bit disappointing (chefs please be more careful), the service was great and the food was absolutely delicious as well."
Jennifer S.,"Portland, OR",666,562,1974,2.0,9/12/2014,"What has happened to you, BJs? You were once my ""generic, go to"" place if we couldn't decide what we wanted, because you kind of have a little bit of everything (like the Cheesecake Factory)... and I've always been satisfied with the food and the service. But lately, you always disappoint me with one or the other. Today, it was the service. - - - Upon getting inside, my friend and I stood there. Waiting... A group of ladies walked in right before us, but they were greeted. We weren't for about five minutes, and when she did talk to us, it wasn't a greeting. It was a... ""How many?"" The whole, entire time before she just played on the little computer seating chart and made herself look busy. Oh, and I completely understand that my baby was a bit on the loud, crying side, but if you sat us in a more efficient manner, I would be able to give him a bottle... and OMG! The loud, crying noise would disappear! - - - Once sat, we didn't see our server for forever. She was nice, so I'll give an extra star... but the service was unfortunately slow. Did they not expect it to be busy on a Friday? I don't know. All I know is that everything seemed to take a long time.  - - - Now, don't get me started on this food runner girl... Ooohhh! She'd seriously like throw plates at you if she could. She must have been in a bad mood, because she'd come by with the food, say what it was in the most annoyed voice ever, and drop the plate in front of you. SO rude. - - - I had never visited this location before, and I don't know if I will again. I so want to give you good reviews BJs like I used to, but you've been so disappointing."
Chelsea K.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,3,1,2.0,4/28/2017,"My boyfriend and I frequent this place a lot and last night was the absolute worst experience we've had. We sat at the bar and ordered drinks and an appetizer. We waited 30 minutes, being ignored, before we could finally put our food order in. We didn't even get an apology for waiting so long from the man that took our food order. Then my boyfriend's food (with cold mashed potatoes) came out along with the appetizer and my entree didn't come out for another 15 minutes after. Again, no apology. No two bite check, we were completely ignored until our card was out to pay. We'd like to think we are regular customers who treat those in the service industry with generous tips for how hard they work. Last night, I didn't see any hustle. I understand restaurants get busy but bjs is large for a reason and supposed to handle that type of capacity. To sum it up, we are very disappointed and it ruined a nice evening."
Clay H.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,17,2,4.0,7/3/2015,"5 stars for the deep dish pizza.  Best dough ever.   4 stars for their beer selection. 2 stars for service.  They've forgotten to give us a table that actually had a server assigned to it...more than once.  When you actually do get service, it can be slow but the staff is always friendly."
Coco S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",20,29,3,1.0,10/19/2015,"Really bummed that they messed up on every item of my online to-go order.  I ordered 2 of the gourmet Mac and cheese without bacon and when I got home I realized they both had bacon in them. I hate/ don't eat bacon at all and It was annoying to pick it off and have the bacon smell afterwards. I'm not a vegetarian but what if I was? :/ Also I ordered the 10 piece chicken wings and they were bare. Absolutely no wing sauce on them. Not even a separate container on the side. I really did not want to go back JUST  for wing sauce. Luckily I had my own at home. And lastly, I ordered a large tavern cut pizza, and I've ordered it before at the restaurant, so I know what it looks like. I guess when you order to go they cut it to half the size. It was TINY. Again, I'm really bummed they messed up my entire order. I definitely have to double check for accuracy before I leave :/"
Grace C.,"Anaheim, CA",50,843,1158,3.0,2/3/2015,"This BJ's is full a lot of the times.  Especially Friday nights.  When hubby and I have made it through the doors without too much issue, it was typically near when they open.  But, we've learned to not venture here on a Friday night.  Parking can be quite hell-ish, too. Overall, though, service has always been great.  Never had any issues with any of the employees.  Food is good, too.  Hubby loves anything related to a lettuce cup, while I really enjoy their salads.  Burgers have always been cooked correctly and very tasty, and other entrees are pretty okay.  The alcoholic drinks are okay, but I never feel that they're worth the price.   Overall, a good place to go to when it's not too crowded.  Food is reasonably priced, but nothing standing out that would us come here more often...especially with the parking and possible-large-crowd situation."
