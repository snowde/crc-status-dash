Joe P.,"Midway City, CA",0,8,4,5.0,4/9/2017,Thanks to the bar staff for making some killer drinks! Service was fast on right on time.
Serena H.,"Costa Mesa, CA",328,76,65,5.0,5/17/2016,"Had a great time here a couple of weeks ago. My coworker and I came here for their late happy hour and sat at the bar. The bartender (it was a Monday night and he was a 25ish year old man) was AWESOME. Very friendly service. He didn't even care that my friend only ordered a soda (at first... hah!) We just got some apps. I got the stuffed mushrooms and she got their seared ahi salad. Both very tasty. I loved the mushrooms the most.  It was pretty busy for a Monday night, so this location must be doing something right. Their late happy hour is awesome, check it out!!!"
Julian P.,"Garfield, Huntington Beach, CA",161,11,,5.0,8/21/2017,"Awesome pizza. Me and my folks ate here the other day. We had a great time, along with enjoying amazing food. Great place to be ! I would strongly recommend this place to anybody who's hungry."
Mina M.,"Irvine, CA",15,3,,1.0,3/11/2017,Service bad I order 2 burgers after 1:15 mins she comes with one burger and we ask her where is the other one she said I thought u will share it . 2nd    the burger taste is not good the wings I don't like it overall my experience with food and service is not good maybe pizza is better there it looks  nice but I don't like their  burger and wings at all
Rachel T.,"Irvine, CA",67,969,239,5.0,11/12/2015,"So good I've come back 2x in one week! LOL! I was in the area this week and my sister wanted to grab lunch here on Monday, once again the menu has changed for the better, some things I am sad they took off the small plates, those were the jam! Anyways, they added a new pasta section and OMG! We tried the Jumbo Meatballs and Spaghetti and it was delicious!! Super saucy and cheesy just the way I like it!! It does have a bit of a kick to it (my sister can handle anything spicy so it wasn't a big deal for her LOL), I couldn't think about anything else except that Spaghetti for the rest of the week until I came back today! My sister thought we should get the spaghetti AND the baked ziti! Baked ziti was out of the park too! Super ooey gooey with cheese, bits of sausage and pepperoni bites! Everything was delicious and not salty like you would imagine!  The pasta dishes would have me coming back for more! I'm so glad they have BJ's where I'm moving to or I would be even more devastated about moving! Good job BJ's, solid food every time! ^___^"
Michelle D.,"Glendale, CA",66,103,180,5.0,7/10/2017,"This branch provided the best customer service of all the ones I've been to! They are fast and efficient. They asked if I'm a reward member and I gave them my cell number. They printed the receipt with my reward number, took us to our table and left the receipt on our table. Shortly after, our server was taking our order and our food came in no time. I'm so glad that I don't have to go online line to claim my reward when the hostesses did it from the point of contact."
Lindsay H.,"Santa Monica, CA",364,303,180,2.0,7/12/2015,"It was as if this BJs had just opened today with how off the service was. Our waitress was great, but her visits were inconsistent and there were times where so many other people checking in at our table that we didn't really know if we had a waitress anymore. For whatever reason, they only had one bartender working on a busy Sunday afternoon so drinks took a long time; one was completely forgotten. Then, shortly after appetizers were finished, my salmon quinoa dish came - along with another we definitely didn't order. I sat and waited for the rest of the dishes to come... and waited, and waited... We're thinking they gave me another tables order, because then the rest finally came out all together. And then another salmon quinoa dish was delivered to our table a few minutes later (that one was probably mine, even though it was much later than the others). The first salmon quinoa looked like it had been sitting out under the heating lamp for a bit and the chef skimped on the veggies, so the waitress just gave me the second one as compensation. Once we got our meals, the various wait staff stopped by frequently to check in. Unfortunately our dirty dishes didn't get cleared until we asked. Sooo, I think it's pretty clear that our experience was less than stellar. Like I said, everyone just seemed to be off. Food and drinks were mediocre, with exception to the new sriracha brussel sprouts. They were amazing!!!"
Diana L.,"Huntington Beach, CA",3,56,1,4.0,7/30/2017,"Lunch with grandsons.  They always order burgers with their own variations.  Bj's always accommodates them well.  I had two of the ""small bites"", ie mac and cheese made with quinoa and roasted beets - both really good."
Lena S.,"Corona, CA",111,22,53,1.0,7/11/2017,I didn't get the name of the server we started out with and unfortunately JT whose name was on the reciept was her relief. I've worked in the service industry for 30+ years and don't understand the work ethics of this newer 'entitlement generation'. I've always liked BJ'S and this is my first time to this location and was not impressed by the service at all and told my fiancé he better not leave his typically generous tip.
Josh W.,"Huntington Beach, CA",641,9,1,4.0,8/6/2017,Went in waiting awhile for our waitress to even get our drink orders which we were confused because there wasn't a lot of people. 10 minutes later a server asked if we have been help at all and took over not only our table but another table of hers. Jesse was not only taking care of his tables but ours and other and helped us with every need. He was wonderful.
April Hamilton O.,"Romoland, Menifee, CA",20,1,,5.0,8/20/2017,"We went to the BJs in Menifee and the manager, Jessica, was awesome! She came to our table all smiley and asked how our food was. I thought that was awesome because they were so busy and she still took the time to make sure we were happy with our food."
Beth A.,"Fountain Valley, CA",0,23,6,1.0,7/25/2017,"Used to be one of our family favorites. Two bad experiences in a row and I am done. Our waitress, Susan, worked hard to make it a god experience but we waited over an hour for our dinner. When it came the pizza was dry and the tacos terrible. Too bad. They need to up their game."
Chris H.,"Huntington Beach, CA",154,12,2,1.0,5/23/2017,"We come here often. Always good food. Service never great. This visit, I had a HAIR in my salad, told me server and he ordered another and sent the manager over to apologize. No worries I say. Then the bill comes and they didn't even take it off the bill. They brought my salad out before my husbands meal. It sits in front of me for 10 mins before he gets his salad, hair and and all. The service is so bad here. It's embarrassing!!!!"
Angel B.,"Anaheim, CA",1934,1244,4434,3.0,5/27/2015,"Yelp Challenge 2015   88/365. *update* Sing along time  ""holding out for a hero  (footloose)* Where have all the good PIZZAS gone And where are all the pies? Where's the Chicago deep dish To stuff the hungry ones? Isn't there a meaty one on this menu? Late at night I stuff my face and I eat what I need [Chorus:] I need a PIZZA I'm holding out for a PIZZA  'til the end of the night its gotta have cheese And its gotta have meat And its gotta be fresh from the start I need a pizza I'm holding out for a pizza  'til the morning light Its gotta be big And it's gotta be good And it has to be the best tonight Somewhere after eight In my hungar fantasy Somewhere just down Beach Blvd There's pizza enticing me Baking all that cheese and rising crust with the heat It's gonna take a Pizza to stuff me  I need a PIZZA I'm holding out for a PIZZA  'til the end of the night its gotta have sauce And its gotta have meat And its gotta be deep dish tonight I need a pizza Pizza, that's what BJ's is all about. It may not be the best pizza, but  If I am looking for a good inexpensive deep dish this end of the OC, I know BJ's can always deliver.  Pizza is something that the Beast and I always agree on, its got to have a lot of meat, lots of sauce and lots cheese on it. And Anchovies on the side. But lately, I have been more accommodating to his needs and allow half the pizza to have his silly little fishes. And you know what? There is zero fishjuice on my half.  We have also learned to alter their standard pizzas and add extra sauce, extra cheese and order it well done, to ensure its cooked all the way through. Sometimes, with multiple toppings the crust does not always cook to our liking, so that extra few minutes in the oven really helps. A large satisfies us and we can usually finish the whole pie ourselves.  If I we dont share the large pizza I order one of the chicken dishes, The Parmesan chicken and balsamic glazed chicken are amazing, and some of my favorite dishes ever. Washed down with the berry peach iced tea. To finish things off, we usually share the white chocolate macadamia nut Pizzookie with ice cream. Service here is never consistent. Which is why the 3 stars.  It is like a roller coaster, up and down, up and down. It makes me dizzy. Tonight our service started out good. I was actually surprised how good it was. But then our waitress got a little busy, disappeared, missed us waving her down  and forgot our drink refills after removing our cups from our table. Then they changed shifts. So we got a new waitress.  Service was in slow motion, at the end of our meal as we waited for our to go  box and check. Then the new server forgot our coupon. *sigh*. In the end everything was resolved and we left full and satisfied. What I noticed is, the other servers in the same sections do not have each other's backs. They don't seem aware of their fellow servers tables needs or tap off their drinks, remove plates, notify your server the customer needs them, ect. It took a few minutes to get our servers attention and the other servers were completely oblivious.  The kitchen crew on the other hand, seem, to be in sync with everyone. Once they bring your order out, they are quick to bring you any condiments you might need.   I also noticed the other patrons around us were pretty much all needing the same things. Checks, to go boxes, drinks, ect. We all must of sat down around the same time. That also makes it difficult to have excellent service. The tiny tables for 2 are not the greatest if your having pizza. There is not enough room for the pizza, the drinks, and a conversation. Its hard to see the person your talking to, if a pizza is in your face, or your worried the pizza is going to fall off the table. Opt for a bigger table for pizza. 4 star food....3 star service = 3 stars I am a fan of the food, but the service could be better."
Andrew M.,"Midway City, CA",0,2,,3.0,5/21/2017,"Let me just say that the upsetting experience I had tonight ended on a good note, thanks to the manager, Daniel. When my family and I got our food, my brother had to wait longer for his chicken alfredo because the staff accidentally dropped it and had to cook another one.     Considering that I have worked in restaurant service before, I simply brushed it off because I understood that that stuff happens sometimes. For the record, I want to say that the food tonight was delicious as always. BJs never fails to amaze me with their dishes. However, what got me upset was that when our server finally brought my brother's food, he was left to eat on his own since the rest of us were just about done. Additionally, when my brother's food arrived, our server did not even bother asking us if we wanted drink refills when most of our glasses were clearly empty. That was the last time we saw our server. We never got our refills and waited a while for our bill.   Thanks to Daniel for being such a great manager and remedying the situation. After expressing my frustration, he personally came over to our table with our bill and apologized for the mishap and service. He told us that he took my brother's chicken alfredo off the bill, and put in another 15% discount to reduce our total. At this moment, I felt valued as a customer and perceived this action on his end as excellent customer service. I expressed my gratitude and told him that I will for sure be coming back soon! Kudos to you Daniel!"
Amanda L.,"Garden Grove, CA",356,196,937,4.0,6/29/2015,"BJ's is one of my most favorite American restaurant compared to macaroni grill, CPK, TGIF's, and etc. I love that they have a large selection of food choices and BEER selections. I often like to try a new beer that  ""sounds"" good or ""looks"" good to expand my beer tasting desires.  If your a first timer, I recommend: - BBQ chicken pizza  - spinach artichoke dip  - berry burst cider (alcohol) sweet, berry, cider -wyder cider- white grape, sweet, cider And end it with, a white chocolate macadamia pizzookie!!!!!! Mini is a tease, regular is perfect :)"
Stephanie C.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,4,,1.0,10/25/2017,"For our birthday celebration BJs ruined it by refusing to make a pizza without their cheese blend. Parmesan is a problem for the birthday girl and when asking to replace it with mozzarella, they refused over and over. The worst pizza place in Huntington Beach. No customer service. Go somewhere else."
InOx P.,"Torrance, CA",113,5,,1.0,7/31/2017,This is the worst BJ's that i went to the service i so slow it took an hour just to receive my food!!!
Lauren M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",4,54,2,5.0,6/29/2017,We dined here for lunch today with a party of 7 which can sometimes be a little difficult. Our server was so patient and helpful. There were 3 kids in our party and he was seriously so incredibly patient. His name is Manny. By far the best service we have EVER received at BJ's. I sure hope he gets good tips and lots of recognition at work because he goes above and beyond!!
Sandra C.,"San Diego, CA",291,496,451,3.0,6/28/2015,"Pros: Large, good for big parties, good for kids, variety on the menu, and pizzas are placed on top of a scale!    Cons: Pizza isn't that great. The thin crust (called ""tavern cut"") is too thin and the thick crust is too thick. Bring back the one in the middle!  Service was a little slow --busy--but not too bad.  We had to send back the brussel sprouts because they were too fried/burned.  The server kindly brought us new brussel sprouts after we showed her."
