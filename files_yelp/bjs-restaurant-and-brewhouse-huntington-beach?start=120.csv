Kelly L.,"Fountain Valley, CA",169,29,3,5.0,10/13/2017,"My 8 year old wanted to take me out on a ""Mother/son date night"" so he chose BJ's to go to. He insisted I come on here and give it 5 stars...and I had to agree.  We waited 3 minutes...server Jonathon S came right over. He was very friendly and polite. We ordered our drinks and food right away. The drinks and food came out so fast we were shocked! It was hot, fresh and delicious!!! Jonathan came by and refilled our drinks before it was empty and without us asking, and since we mentioned at the beginning we wanted a pozookie, he asked about what we wanted. We ordered the monkey bread one, and again...came our rapid fast, hot and amazingly delishious!!! Again, Jonathon was attentive, even while having other tables. We had an amazing mother son night, and because we had a rough week, we wanted to pay it forward by #hustling kindness in the name of a little boy who bravely fought cancer for 2 years, and sadly passed away on Sunday. This little boy loved to ""hustlekindess"" so in his memory we did tonight. Our bill was $25....we left a $25 tip....Thank you Jonathon for being an amazing server and making then end of a dreadful week amazing!#carterstrong"
Renee M.,"Garden Grove, CA",268,360,499,3.0,3/2/2016,"This applies to all BJ's because they are all basically the same.  They are ""A-OK"" as the 3 stars applies.  Exception the location on main street in Huntington Beach gets an extra star for the entertainment factor of watching the people on Main Street.   The food at all is decent, the same at all location, and super mainstream. You would choose BJ's the same way you would choose McDonalds, you know exactly what you are going to get. But unlike McDonalds I am not offended by what is offered nor am I Wowed. I think they might even clone their wait staff, because the service is always the same - that is not a bad thing,  I have always appreciated the attentive , yet non overbearing attention. Last time I went in I had the  Ahi Poke  appetizer and an IPA.  Both were good quality The Ahi was fresh and sushi quality,  tasted great and made me happy.  The IPA was decent for a brewery that caters to the taste of the masses.  Yes go there especially if you are going with a group that has varying tastes, they will have something for just about everything.  (Vegan options are a joke) Hense a cheat meal of ahi."
Khoa L.,"Garden Grove, CA",125,16,10,1.0,6/15/2017,Today I went in for dinner and the service here is absolutely horrible. Arrived at 10pm and didn't get serve until 1030pm. The waiter was unorganized and non professional. Definitely will not be back and I recommend everyone not to come to this location.
Chris B.,"Long Beach, CA",157,20,7,2.0,9/6/2016,Came on a slow night for dinner with my family. I came about 25 mins before my reservation and the hostess made me wait exactly until our reservation before we got seated...when the table was clearly ready.  The restaurant wasn't even busy.  Money lost for the restaurant if you ask me.  I don't mind ordering drinks and waiting for the rest of my party.  Once we ordered our food it took about 40 mins to come out.  My uncle ordered a medium rare steak and it came out completely well done.  Such a disappointment.  The only thing that was on point was the pazookie that night. I probably won't be coming back to BJ'S ever...even for the pazookies. The food is mediocre and the service is slow.  Don't come if you're really hungry.
Maria R.,"Santa Ana, CA",21,7,,5.0,7/21/2017,"We enjoy the food and we always get great service in the bar area. Especially Sierra, she is extremely  friendly and always attentive to our needs. Fun place to hang out."
Ken S.,"Anaheim, CA",0,4,,5.0,10/14/2017,"My family and I visited BJ's today and we could not be happier with the experience.  The best part of our visit was our server, Corey (Corrie?).  He was very friendly and conversational and established a great rapport with us.  I've been fortunate to visit many fine restaurants, and Corey could teach those high-end servers a thing or two about establishing a relationship with customers and putting them at ease while they enjoy their meal. He is an asset to this organization."
Poxie R.,"Huntington Beach, CA",24,22,25,3.0,6/3/2016,"Not surprised that they only have 3 stars. I love the pizza and shoestring fries with ranch (among other menu items). We were in here twice within 10 days and both times did not have a good experience. The first evening our server was terrible. We had to ask her twice for our drinks, twice for ranch, twice for our check and three times for a to-go box. By the end she was no longer apologizing and said, ""Here"", then left. A good portion of her time was spent flirting with the table next to us. It took us over 2 hours, from the time we got our food, to get our check and leave. We called in a pizza for carry out the following week. All we wanted was a good pizza without the poor service. When we got home, the pizza was wrong and one of the best parts, the tomatoes, weren't even on the pizza and it was so dry. It was missing other toppings as well. Next time we know to check it before we leave. I've truly never had a pizza screwed up for delivery or carry out and didn't think to check it. We should've known. I gave 3 stars because of management. If something isn't right, they make sure it is before you leave (if dining in). It will probably be a long time before we come back, as we have a bad taste in our mouths after these last two incidents. If it wasn't for the managers and how they care about the customers, we probably wouldn't come back.  Thank you to management, I think Jesse helped us both times. You make a bad experience, better. If only your staff cared as much."
Monica B.,"Huntington Beach, CA",1,18,1,4.0,7/22/2017,"Pretty decent food. I'd recommend the jalepeno burger. The service is so so, kind of takes a while to get attention of most of them. But close to freeway so it's easy access"
Mayra K.,"Huntington Beach, CA",1,23,1,5.0,10/5/2017,"I always have a great experience at BJ's. My favorite foods here are the traditional chicken wings, mini pepperoni pizza, and a smore's pizookie. The food is always fresh and tastes yummy and the staff is very friendly. I love the wide variety of food served here and they have some tasty healthy options as well (Mediterranean chicken pita tacos are great). Even on one of my visits when there was an issue with my rewards points, Oscar the manager on duty listened, was kind, and remedied the issue right away. Their food and service is the reason why this place has become my favorite restaurant and I always make sure to check in on the rewards app to acrue more points for rewards (free pizookie, $10 off the bill). I love this place!"
Kelley U.,"Huntington Beach, CA",89,65,57,1.0,6/10/2017,"Came here for dinner and it was busy to the max, but it is a Saturday so that's not surprising. We sat at  the bar that had a lower seat then then rest of the bar which was awkward. I ordered the new garlic knots and they weren't good, essentially dough that had no flavor at all... and there was hair on two of them.... I ordered a BBQ chicken pizza no tomatoes or onions and it came out almost baron- all crust a handful of chicken, barely any sauce and   Just a pinch of cheese- since it cost $22 I was not happy!!! No one came to see how our food was.... I doubt I'll be back to this location.... it was a waste of my money for bad food and poor service!!"
Abubaker D.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,6,,5.0,6/25/2017,Great food. Santa Fe salad is definitely my favorite among the salads.  Restaurant waiters and managers are always welcoming and friendly.
Kris O.,"San Pedro, CA",0,13,1,3.0,3/23/2017,"Stopped by for lunch and tried the new Cuban sandwich. Ordered my favorite root beer which was awesome like always and the Cuban sandwich was overall good i would recommend it, i asked for the bread a little more toasted than usual i like the crunch of the bread in a sandwich and to my disappointment it was soft all is forgiven will try again real soon p.s Josh and Molly were great servers very patient and kind thumbs up to them."
Dee D.,"Norco, CA",88,41,28,1.0,4/30/2017,Receptionist at Bjs right about now is a douchebag. Yapping about 15 mins ignoring whose behind waiting for service. Hopefully the service is good SMH.
Tia L.,"Garden Grove, CA",0,20,,5.0,5/28/2017,"Overall this place is very average nothing really makes me want to say, ""hey let's go to BJ's!"" This specific location is the one I frequent most and service has always been good but I came here tonight with one friend and I have never been more impressed with my service. The 5 stars is for my waitress Kristin, I sat down and your typical drinks to start off with but throughout my meal she just consistently got more impressive. I had a refill on my soda before asking and my friend had her water refilled as well, she checked up on us frequently, and I glanced at her, she said ""dessert?"" And then proceeded to read my mind with the right size and flavor pizookie without me having to ask/ state it. I don't write yelp reviews often but she definitely deserved this one!"
Jon-Michael B.,"San Clemente, CA",13,4,,1.0,6/10/2017,Toast is old and hard. Omelet it mushy and oily. Pancakes are hard. Waitress was gone the whole time. 2nd worst breakfast I have ever had
Anita B.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,33,19,3.0,6/3/2017,"It's alright. Average food. Saving grace is the super nice staff. They work hard enough, at least each time I've been, and earned a 3-star."
Vivi T.,"Long Beach, CA",455,406,1196,3.0,2/13/2015,"I seldom go to BJ's because if I'm ever feeling like going to a chain restaurant, The Cheesecake Factory is my usual go-to choice.  But the other day, I decided to go to BJ's for the all-you-can-eat salad and soup $7.95 lunch special.  There are several options for each.  Soups included chicken tortilla, broccoli cheddar, clam chowder, and maybe something else.  Salads included garden salad, wedge salad, a tomato mozzarella salad, and another one that I cannot remember.  This is a really good bargain.  I am kind of a fiber-a-vore, so I ate 4 salads.  I had the wedge and three garden salads.  Nothing too special about them, but I do love my greens and especially for such a low price.  I had the chicken tortilla and broccoli cheddar soups.  Both were very tasty.  I liked the chicken tortilla better.  My friend had the clam chowder, which he also really enjoyed.   Service was not so great though.  When I walked into the restaurant, the hostess didn't even look up from her screen when she asked me how many people in my party.  I said ""three.""  Then later she said ""2?""  I said ""No, three.""  When she went to seat me (my two friends had not arrived yet), she only brought two menus and I told her that there were three in my party.  She said ""You said two earlier.""  Yeah, so I'm taking a star off for that."
Amber H.,"Huntington Beach, CA",33,18,4,2.0,10/29/2016,"Sadly, this was a less than awesome visit. Ordered online to save time. Nope. Didn't happen. No parking. Phone didn't work. Ended up going in and they weren't having a good night. Finally got my pizza and headed out. Drive strait home and realized that not only was it cold (weird since I had to wait extra long for it) but it was also seriously lacking in the topping department. Did you know only half a pizza gets the ingredients you ordered? Guess I should stick to Menchie's...closer to home and consistent."
Brittany R.,"Los Alamitos, CA",8,62,110,5.0,8/13/2016,"Came here with a large group for my sons 10th birthday last Sunday and Brittany was our server and she was great.   Drinks were always full,  food was delicious,  and they even did a free pizookie for his birthday!"
Chris P.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,3,,2.0,9/22/2017,Unbelievably slow service. Felt like our waitress held on to our credit card for a solid twenty minutes. Very disappointed.
