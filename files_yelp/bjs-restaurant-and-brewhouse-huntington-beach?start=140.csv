Jess G.,"Downey, CA",347,347,1551,4.0,2/7/2015,"Disclaimer: I'm a huge fan of BJ's Brewery. The wait was about 30 minutes-1 hour on a Saturday night at 7:30 pm. It wasn't bad because sometime during that time span, a magical man from the kitchen came by bearing free cheese pizza! He visited twice so I got 2 slices of pizza just for waiting. The BJ's service was decent for a busy Saturday night. It was lagging in quickness but I was in no rush so this wasn't a problem for me. Don't go to any BJ's location on a weekend dinner night if you're on a time schedule because their service in terms of time is relaxed. They won't forget about your empty beverage glass but you'd wait anywhere from 10-20 minutes just to get that beverage glass refilled. If you have a sweet tooth and have never tried a pizookie, get one. It will change your life forever after."
Lucas L.,"Irvine, CA",0,15,2,5.0,9/9/2017,"We got a delivery and was a bit of a nightmare but Chris the manager, what a guy! He went well and beyond to make sure it all went well, with him even delivering the food himself. The guy is a leader and a fixer and BJS are lucky to have him manage one their restaurants."
Nijole T.,"Los Angeles, CA",3080,6372,5149,2.0,11/3/2015,"I'd rather not. Service was a miss here, no luck on getting refills or something additional I wanted to order. Food was brought out way after each other to the point that some were almost done eating and I was still eating. My salad was ok, not special, I nabbed some of the pizza (thin crust and it was lacking crunch and quality. Prices are high for the quality that you get, not worth returning."
Heather L.,"Garden Grove, CA",57,193,176,3.0,1/16/2016,"Came here with family to celebrate my brother's 17th birthday last weekend. It was fairly crowded on a Saturday Night and luckily, we were seated within 25 minutes. There were a lot of options to choose from regarding food and our waiter, Rori, was very helpful. My table got nachos and fried calamari as our appetizers which were very good and tasty. For the entree, I ordered the balsamic chicken which was also pretty good, but I wouldn't get it again due to a weird wine-ish taste. My brother got a candle-lit pizookie as his birthday dessert which was cute although none of the waiters joined in to sing him a happy birthday song which was sad. I wouldn't come back unless I'm being dragged here for a celebration, but it was okay when I went."
Renee G.,"Los Alamitos, CA",328,417,149,1.0,12/18/2016,Awful service we go a lot but this waitress was so busy on her phone she messed up our drink order and food was mediocre at best first time it's been this bad Mai Tai tasted awful my pizza was doughy sadly diisappointed
Mark T.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,2,,5.0,1/26/2017,Best bartenders in town! Friendly bar and great service! Avocado egg rolls are the best and they're always switching up menu for a corporate place which is nice. They also have great local beer selection!
Dayana Z.,"Santa Ana, CA",150,4,,1.0,5/27/2017,First time attending here and had to wait more than an hour for them to tell us they going to text us when ready and to find out they had jot down the wrong number nd made us wait more on top of it not great service either...not coming here again
Julio L.,"Buena Park, CA",0,3,,5.0,5/14/2017,"Sussi is awesome.. loved her service, shes soo experience and so polite and nice. Loved the food too ive been here a lot of times but this time sussi made it soo special, would definitely come back more often. :)"
David S.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",381,43,18,4.0,5/27/2017,"Love the variety on the menu.  Lots of great fresh food. Only disappointment are the fried apps.  Which is fine, because the healthier options are plentiful and good. And today our waitress Connie was the best!"
Jaime H.,"Huntington Beach, CA",40,127,1,1.0,3/8/2017,"Food was decent but service was atrocious!  Our server took our order, brought our waters, forgot my beer, and then went MIA until the food was ready.  Oh an he didn't even bring out our appetizer.  Someone else did and no one bothered to check up on us.  After the food was brought out, our server went MIA again.  As I sit here writing this review finished with our food, he is nowhere to be found.  Never once asked us if our food was ok or if we needed anything else.  What a joke...will never come back!!!"
Sadaf Q.,"Huntington Beach, CA",32,119,137,3.0,8/19/2016,Not my favorite. I went here and find myself coming back here because of friends. They accommodate a lot of people so it's great for large groups and service is okay. It's also the home of the pazookie which I highly recommend.  It's not that their food is bad or anything. I just don't have that much of a taste for it. I think BJs is great for pizza and pazookies and not so much for everything else. I've been here a couple of times and I always leave feeling like I could've gone somewhere else and eaten healthier for the same prices.
Kevin A.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,2,,5.0,5/5/2017,Love this place. Service is great. Waiters are very attentive and helpfull. Food is always cooked well. The only down side is the parking can sometimes suck so get there early
Lexie L.,"Santa Ana, CA",105,8,6,2.0,3/11/2017,"Kristen was a terrible server, we asked for no Parmesan on our salad and it came it with Parmesan. Then she continued to tell her life story to the people behind us and didn't ask if everything was okay with us until Oliver had helped us with our order. She never asked if we needed refills for our drinks and our wings were cold. Also, when our check came she rushed us to pay by continuously asking if we were ready to pay. We had also asked for Togo sauces that she didn't bring out until I reminded her when she came to ask about the check. We understand she is new but please do better."
Shirl S.,"Lake Havasu City, AZ",7,21,15,2.0,4/6/2017,The server sent the manager over and we spoke with him. We did not ask for the manager and did not try to complain. We spoke to the manager after the meal. He did nothing.
Crestal F.,"El Monte, CA",61,15,3,4.0,7/14/2016,"The food here is great, especially the pizza! HOWEVER, the service we recieved from our waiter was terrible... a little after me and two others sat down; we realized the AC was blasting directly above us and our friend was freezing. So we asked our waiter if theres any other seats are available or if we can move outside. He said okay and will check for us. Half an hour later he still hasn't come back and passed by us multiple times, IGNORING us! We couldn't order anything else cause he was busy avoiding us! Then our food came and we gave up changing our seats. This guy totally ignored us and dodged us even when we try to call him. He even looked at us and turned away! Not once has he checked on us but he did so about 3-4 times to all other tables in front or near us! :/ very unprofessional.. I wanted to order a drink and ended up having another server get it. He was super prompt and great!  So the 4 star is for food and that awesome other guy."
Robyn B.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,3,,1.0,12/30/2016,We were told that it would be a 30-40 minute wait but then they sent us a text saying 40-50 minutes. So 40 minutes pass and we check to see where we are in line because lots of people had been seated. They told us 15 more minutes and that we are the next big group (7 people). 15 minutes passes and we check again and they say 10 more minutes at the most because they are waiting on people finishing their dessert. We could see other tables that could be pushed together but decided to wait a little longer. Again time passes and we check in after 10 minutes and they finally say they are going to start looking at putting tables together and possibly 10 more minutes. We decided to leave because they didn't apologize for their inaccuracies and we didn't want to wait another hour for food.
Jack M.,"Fountain Valley, CA",0,6,2,3.0,4/11/2017,"Beware of their ribs. $19.50 for 1/2 rack?? 6 ribs? Tough, little meat, no flavor and no sauce like the pic showed. broccoli cheese soup was like melted thick cheddar cheese, gummy. Great tomato mozzarella salad.  For the price it was terrible!! Salad was the only one worth eating.  At Tony Rome's tonight. Full rack, $22.00  includes nice rolls with butter, Cole slaw and fries or baked potato. ALL FOR $22.00."
James L.,"Garden Grove, CA",1106,935,1830,1.0,8/4/2014,"BJ's - you've made it to my one star list! The service on the night that I came was excruciatingly slow. We had a table of 7 people and used this night to catch up since we had a friend who flew in town for the week. It was a Thursday night and the restaurant seemed like it was pretty full. Our first server took our drink order and shortly after, was gone for the evening. She introduced us to the person who was going to ""take care of us"" the rest of the night. The first server looked unhappy to be there, not at all pleasant so it seemed like a huge plus we were getting someone else. The second person was slightly better but something was definitely going on in the kitchen because our food came out so slow. At different points of the night, we couldn't flag down our server (to get drink refills, to order dessert, to pay for our bill). It was mind numbingly slow! To top it all off, the pizza I got was pathetic and I try not to be so harsh in my reviews but I have nothing kind to say about it. I ordered the Great White and there was nothing great about it. I felt like they skipped the sauce or something so it was literally pizza dough and toppings. Normally, I would send it back or bring it to thr server's attention, but if you read the few paragraphs above, that would send us into another time warp until anything would come out correctly. I was sorely disappointed this night and have no intentions to come back. As much as I like the pizookie, I really can't have my patience tested like this anymore- we all don't have time for it."
Christopher H.,"Garden Grove, CA",0,4,5,5.0,8/24/2017,"Solid place, great beer, good food.  If you order pizza make sure and ask for extra olive oil on the pan!  I used to work there and they used to do that for every pizza now you have to ask... good bye dry crust..."
Will C.,"Garden Grove, CA",188,190,114,3.0,9/18/2015,"We arrived for a birthday dinner around 6 pm.  With 4-yr old who needed a high chair and were seated promptly in the outside garden area.  Nice spot when you're not facing West as the sun sets. We had drinks like the Amber Red for me and my GF had a mixed seasonal fruity one.  They arrived quickly and the staff was friendly, but did not introduce themselves.  The place was clean and utensils as well, a plus there.  So we split a steak and salad and brought organic & gluten free food for the kid.  He played with BJs crayons and his cars so had a great time.  I even watched the football game on the screen outside.   Used the Yelp app to get the 10% discount and learned that it applies only to food...not to alcohol beverages.  So bewary to read the Yelp fine print that vendors add to their ads. $32.62 - 10% = $26.10 (not counting beverages).  Otherwise well recommended. We will return."
