Tom H.,"Huntington Beach, CA",16,18,9,1.0,1/5/2017,"Just left this place. Sat in the bar-- ""no waiting"".  It took more than 5 minutes before we got menus. Our drinks water and tea took 5 more minutes. After almost 15 minutes and no waiter to take our order, it was time to leave. We would starve waiting for our food if the kitchen was as bad as the service。 getting a lunch should not be a pain. It certainly was today."
Jenny L.,"Huntington Beach, CA",6,2,,2.0,6/15/2016,"So first off I never write reviews on Yelp but today was worst than most.  I have come to this BJs for a while now and I have always had decent to great service! Until tonight.  We had ordered around 10:00PM and for 30 minuets still had gotten our food. Thinking BJs is just busy, so we gave our waitress a little more time. 15 more minuets and we finally had asked when our food would be coming out. Our waitress then apologized and told us she FORGOT to put in our order!!! It took her a full 45 minuets to realize she had forgotten? Ridiculous. Then, she offered us a soup or salad ""on her"". Politely declining, just wanting our main course. 15 more minuets pass and now we have been waiting 1 hour for our dinner!!! It had FINALLY came out after an hour.  Dessert time. Thinking... ""Let's order early so this doesn't take forever"" we ordered two pazookies, 1 regular sized pazookie, which we had asked our waitress about because it was said to be ""free pazookie day"" (with a purchase of a meal) and 1 mini pazookie. Right after we had ordered dessert our waitress gave us the check. On the check was our two entrees and 2 full price pazookies. WRONG. So I flagged down the waitress and readdressed the free pazookie deal. Took 10 minuets to get the correct bill and 20 total minuets to receive our dessert.  And in the end we got 1 apology, the price of 2 entrees, and 1 mini pazookie. Making it a total of $48.00 and bad service."
K L.,"Garden Grove, CA",573,81,107,3.0,12/20/2015,"It's great that BJ's closes so late. This place specializes in pizza (which I've never tried) but it has anything you can possibly think of! They brew their own beers. The hopstorm IPA is quite tasty. I've eaten at a few BJ's before and this seems to be the best one.  The meal was almost $30 for wings and pasta, which is a stretching for us. I chose to get the shrimp and asparagus pasta: it was decent. There wasn't much flavor in the dish, and it was a very small dish for $16. The buffalo wings will always be my boyfriends favorite. They drizzle their buffalo sauce and ranch on top instead of pouring the sauce over, so the wings stay crunchy. Yum! The workers here seemed to be on the younger side, and it seems to be more on the casual end of the stick. However, the servers are all very nice. It's just hard to get a hold of them to ask for something.  Make sure to check the bar area for seating before you wait!"
John S.,"Norwalk, CA",16,25,42,5.0,8/13/2016,"For appetizers, our group of fifteen shared spinach & artichoke dip, ahi poke, and avocado egg rolls.  For the main dish, we shared three pizzas, sweet pig, Mediterranean, and buffalo.  Finally for dessert, we shared pizooki to finish things off.  Food was great waitress was nice and price was reasonable.  Will comeback in the near future."
Shawn H.,"El Cajon, CA",59,13,10,5.0,2/9/2017,I come to BJ's a lot and the food today was the best it's ever been very on point and the service was good as well
Brian L.,"Compton, CA",8,161,9,2.0,11/13/2016,"Good food, friendly staff, but an hour and a half for an appetizer and a pizza is just not acceptable. They have that neat little computer thing that lets you place orders, but the food never comes. Also, what's the point of that little computer thing if you can only order about a third of the menu?"
Cindy W.,"Fountain Valley, CA",0,20,,3.0,3/13/2017,I ordered a spaghetti with meatballs. The meatballs came out burnt.  I was very disappointed.  Luckily the bartender was good about switching it for me.  I am so surprise the kitchen would allow burnt meatball server like that.  Overall the experience was good. The staffs was friendly.
Brittany S.,"Westminster, CA",17,4,,3.0,3/13/2017,Well the food was really good and didn't have to wait too long compared to other times I had been here. I have come to expect slow service because of how busy this place gets so I understand that but my biggest issue is they charged my debit card for the full bill amount twice. Not too happy with that at all.
Little T.,"Long Beach, CA",80,28,9,1.0,7/7/2017,"I usually go to the Bj's in Cerritos and have never experienced any issues there. I will NOT be coming back to this specific location. So, we had to wait a bit to be seated. No biggie. Wait wasn't long at all. Cool thing is they text you when your seats available. On our way to our seat.. YOU CAN SEE AND FEEL THE STARES FROM EVERY SINGLE WHITE PERSON THERE! Nobody has seen an Asian woman and black man EVER in Huntington Beach? Okay! Our waitress started off great. We still got the heavy stares as we tried to converse and just enjoy our night. The food didn't take long to arrive. However we order the steak well done and yet it came out with the meats blood leaking bright red. They took it back and when it came back it was .... DRY and tough. Well done doesn't mean dry and tough. It means NO PINK. I've had steaks well down yet juicy still. So after our dinner we ordered dessert. The waitress brought the check and said no rush.. HOWEVER SHE KEPT HOVERING AND COMING BACK TO ASK IF WE WERE READY TO PAY LIKE EVERY 5 MINUTES.  Damn can we enjoy ourselves without feeling rushed? As we left needless to say they stared at us leaving. That was the most awkward dining experience up to date. WE WILL NEVER RETURN TO THAT LOCATION and will advise others to not dine there as well."
Cheyenne P.,"Los Alamitos, CA",143,112,108,2.0,10/9/2016,"I came here last night and boy, was it an experience... We had a reservation for 8 people @ 5:30pm for our friend's 21st birthday and our entire party showed up around 6. Our waiter was very nice, got our drink order & food order and all was well. Drinks lagged a bit, and he comes over to me and asks what I ordered again (not a good sign). I tell him I ordered the same as my friend next to me, which were mahi mahi tacos (no cilantro), and he went on his way.   15 or so minutes later our table starts getting their food, which was everyone but myself and my friend who ordered the tacos. Our waiter says they're lagging but it'll be out as soon as possible. A few mins pass and he brings out my friend's plate, and explains there was a ""mix up"" in the kitchen with my order and it'll take a bit longer. (Even though we ordered the same damn thing, which means he clearly didn't put in my order). Everyone at my table was then eating except for me, and I probably sat there for 30+ minutes with no food. All the meanwhile the waiter constantly comes over and apologizes, which was appreciated but it wouldn't change the fact I didn't have any food the entire night and I honestly ended up being there to hang out LMAO.    I was insanely irritated the entire time but tried not to take it out on him and I remained patient. He ended up telling me the meal would be discounted and he would put it in a to-go box for me. (You mean you didn't want me to be the only one eating while my friends were finished, even though I was the only one NOT eating? Lol) I was honestly baffled by the entire situation lmao, we were there for my friend's birthday dinner and I didn't even get a meal LOL.      He brings over the tacos and there's cilantro all over, which I didn't even bother to mention was wrong since every single other thing about that visit for me was wrong. Like yeah, it ended up being free, but I would have rather gotten what I ordered (on time) and paid for it than to be pissed off and hungry all night with something I waited for for over an hour and it didn't even end up being right. Honestly unbelievable LMAO. The waiter was nice and apologized what seemed like a million times, so I'm not giving a completely despicable rating for the way he handled it. Don't really wanna come back though if it means I'm not going to get food LOL."
Brian N.,"Huntington Beach, CA",150,69,,4.0,1/7/2017,Was there with colleagues for lunch yesterday. We sat at the bar.  The waitress provided very good service. I had Meatball spaghetti. It was good. Meatballs have a little too much flour but otherwise tasty.
Ruth M.,"La Mirada, CA",6,5,,2.0,7/31/2017,"Tried this restaurant last week (although different HB location) for only the second time as a family.  We tried it while they were doing their 50% off pizza special.  Because I eat gluten free, we called ahead of time to see if the special applied to the gluten free pizzas.  The guy who answered the phone didn't know but kindly checked.  I was told that it did work for the gluten free.  Fast forward a few hours to dinner time.  My husband called again because we realized that the offer wasn't clear about whether it could be used for carry out.  The girl who answered told us that it was fine.  We ordered our pizza, and were told the price.  ""Oh.  But it will be half that.""  Off we go a bit later to pick up the pizza.  Hubby goes in store and is given a full price amount.  He tried to let her know what we had been told.  She said, ""The offer isn't for this pizza.  This is just a small pizza.""  Hubby says, ""But we were told that it worked for this one.""  ""This is only a small pizza,"" she says.  ""I understand,"" says us, ""but we were told it would be half price for the special deal and were even given the half price amount.""  ""No.  Not this one.  This is just a small pizza.""  She was really stuck on the ""small pizza"" thing.  We said we didn't want it then.  By the way, my husband thought this was the same girl who had just told him on the phone that it would be half price.  Up walks a manger and gives it to us for half price.  A gluten free pizza is usually a bit smaller than normal, but this one seemed very small.  And the ingredients on it looked as if they had just been tossed on.  AND an ingredient was missing.  I can't imagine paying close to $20 for this pizza.  I didn't even like paying the $9 or so we paid.  Not a good experience.  And we are done with BJs.  Very stressful dinner choice!"
Johana A.,"Santa Ana, CA",2,12,6,1.0,11/5/2016,"If I could give zero stars I would!!!  Horrible experience to say the least! Here is how it played out for us... We order chips and salsa and  mozzarella sticks as appetizers.  The chips were stale and the mozzarella sticks were cold! I informed our waiter that the chips were stale, and he then proceeded to bring a ""new"" batch which were also stale.  My husband ordered a double bacon cheeseburger (medium pink), and I ordered a California club flatbread pizza.  The hamburger buns were burnt definitely not edible, the meat was cooked well done with char, and to top it off the fries were COLD! My California club flat bread pizza came out with a burning hot plate, but yet the pizza was warm/cold with extra ripped avocado (black in color).  We AGAIN called our waiter to inform him about our food.  He took my husband hamburger back to the kitchen to switch the bread and brought it back WITHOUT THE BACON!!! At this point, it was a JOKE! We couldn't believe how horrible the food was. The manager came over to talk to us about our food.  He did not offer to remake our food, and laughed as if it was a joke! He discounted the chips and $3.95 ""manager discount"" for our disgusting food! I am definitely not returning to BJs restaurant again! And would NOT recommend this place to ANYONE!! Stay away unless you want to deal with horrible food and a $50 bill!"
Cat A.,"Los Angeles, CA",94,29,,3.0,2/9/2017,"I was here last night. Ordered an appetizer that took FOREVER to come, it was the cheese dip with chips, how long can that take to be ready? My friend and I got our entrees when we were just starting with the appetizer...  Overall food was good, service was good too."
P S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",20,53,25,2.0,12/3/2016,"I LOVE BJ's. However, we realized they were having their 2 for 25 deal and talked our friends into a holiday dinner.   Well, apparently this time around you can only do one per table. Even when asking to split checks the manager refused. Our waiter Aaron was kind and says he asked but couldn't have it changed. It is the holiday season and I didn't expect my favorite place to be the town Scrooge. Stear clear!"
Allyson G.,"Stanton, CA",0,14,,5.0,7/23/2017,"Came here on a busy night, was waiting only 20 minutes and the hostess brought out slices of pizza for everyone waiting to be seated! Definitely recommend and appreciate the friendliness"
Chad C.,"Huntington Beach, CA",3,84,35,5.0,12/16/2016,You can always count on this place for good food. They brew there own beer and do a pretty solid job. There menu has a good assortment and there pizza is amazing. This location is great and service is always on.
Kimberly N.,"Garden Grove, CA",100,45,273,4.0,10/15/2015,"Took my little sis here for dinner around 7pm! It was crowded as usual but we didn't have to wait long.  Food: We got the .... 1. Small great white pizza--which is our fave--comes with mushrooms, garlic, chicken and tomatoes on top of Alfredo sauce. Instead of a pizza stand, they have a small table SCALE to hold your pizza. It's not really appealing because the scale just makes you feel fat while eating your pizza...   2. Spinach stuffed mushrooms--mushrooms were big & juicy.  3. Clam chowder bread bowl. It comes in a garlic bread bowl, a little bit too salty 4. Ahi poke appetizer taste fresh with crunchy wonton chips-very refreshing!  5. White chocolate chip pazookie --everything just melts in your mouth! LOVE!  ---------- I also love their California flat bread pizza & the classic wings--can't go wrong with these items!  Waiter provided great service!!"
Tish S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",45,202,170,4.0,11/26/2016,"I've been to BJ's a handful of times. The food is average and the blond beer is good. This night I was meeting a friend. We ordered appetizers: fried calamari, mozzarella sticks and sliders. The calamari was salty and the sliders were dry. Our server was super nice, but we waited about 10 minutes to get our change for our bill."
David l.,"Encinitas, CA",117,81,153,4.0,8/9/2015,I had the jumbalya which was good but not as good as the salmon.  The salmon is a better deal and 4$ less.  I finished the night with the PB&J pazookie.  I love PB&J but their interpretation of it through the famous pazookie was an embarrassment to any try PB&J fan. Over all good service and same great taste...
