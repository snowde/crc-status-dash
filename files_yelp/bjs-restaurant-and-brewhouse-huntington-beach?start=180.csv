Chris A.,"Whittier, CA",1,7,6,5.0,4/2/2016,"First off I want to start by saying I love bj's brewery, and it's been one of my favorite places to enjoy myself for years now. Since I've been going also I've had only maybe one poor experience because of service. Still not bad enough to keep me from coming back though. So now for my review on this location. I love it! Probably tied for my favorite location overall, cerritos being the other one. This location though is great. It's one of the smaller ones, but still give off a nice intimate ambiance. Also the service is great. Most notably the bartender chris. We went for happy hour and not only did he remember us but remembered our drinks and everything. I know it's not the craziest thing, but it's definitely the little things like that, that make u feel welcomed and coming back! Either way I'm going to continue to come back to bj's because I just love it so much, but this location will definitely be on top of the list now thanks to their great customer service."
Lauren S.,"Long Beach, CA",1,4,3,2.0,12/26/2016,My friends and I went to get pazooki's and had a terrible experience. At the end of the night we asked for separate checks and our server was EXTREMELY rude. She told us that it was going to take her a long time and pretty much said we were an inconvenience. Her name is Mandukhai and should be fired.
Rudy R.,"Garden Grove, CA",0,23,4,5.0,1/23/2017,"Came here last night with my wife and we decided to sit in the cocktail area our server was Ashley, she was super fun and energetic my wife didn't know if she wanted the committed beer so she brought her a taster which was really nice so we decided to get  the grand cru instead and the red with totonka stout. All throughout our meal she kept constantly checking on us making sure everything was good. Towards the end we decided to try to pay at the table which didn't work out so well but she offered to close our check for us and take off the game purchase we accidentally made. I'm a rewards member and I love BJ's so I will Def be returning to this location"
Rob W.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,14,7,5.0,12/18/2016,"Moving into a new yelp account, my review of this BJ's was deleted but it deserves my 5 stars for the record.. the location is ideal across from Bella Terra but with a separate parking lot. The hostess is gorgeous, and super efficient. Our waitress Kayla was the perfect blend of friendly and professional, great ink too! The food is standard BJ's and the beer selection is better than average. All in all, solid place to go to watch a game, or dinner with the Fam."
Mike M.,"Ontario, CA",0,4,,2.0,1/1/2017,Well let me start my saying the bar gets a 4 star.  The dinning area gets two star at best . The management here seemed to not care .  The food took over 35 mins to come for one pizza . This was after waiting 15 mins to put in a order . Their are many other great restaurants in this area that I will go to in the future . They sat us in the black hole of restaurant it was so cold we ate with jackets on . We ask to have heaters turned on the manager failed here too
Taylor Ann R.,"Riverside, CA",1,4,1,1.0,12/15/2016,"I absolutely LOVE Bj's and this was a big disappointment. When we first got there the hostess didn't even walk us to our table, she just pointed and said we can go sit over there. (whatever) but then our food took forever, they got our appetizer wrong and by the time they got it right our food was ready. Then after we finish eating the waiter didn't come over to our table for a while and we were ready to order dessert, once he finally came he didnt ask if we needed anything else he just set the check down and we stopped him to get the dessert we got it and within a couple min. the check was back on the table. they were more in a rush to get paid then they were to serve us. VERY disappointing."
Jackie N.,"Garden Grove, CA",211,142,167,3.0,7/21/2015,"We usually only ever come here for happy hour, which isn't bad.  You have to sit by the bar (tables and booths on the bar side included) to get happy hour prices, so sometimes there's no seats if you come in at a bad time.  Service is good.  Food is okay.  I got the ahi poke because I wanted something light.  It was okay tasting, but probably could use more  sauce, or at least give me soysauce or something to dip it.  The artichoke dip was alright, except the chips they gave was really oily."
Anh T D.,"Santa Monica, CA",97,62,18,2.0,9/6/2016,"Ordering curbside was a difficult and frustrating experience.  I placed the order under guest checkout, expecting BJ's to collect my method of payment.  When this didn't happen, I called the restaurant, which is when what was to be fast and efficient took up 30 minutes of my time in trying to figure out how to pay.   I called  in and a very nice girl Kennedy answered and said she couldn't accept the credit card and instructed me to register online  (Jump thru hoop #1) and to call back with my account#.  I did that, called her back, and she said to wait 5 minutes, download the app (Hoop #2) to pay.  I downloaded the app, and tried to log-in.  No success.  After multiple attempts of not being recognized on app, I reset my password online (Hoop #3).  The iPhone link took me to a blank page.  I then went back and clicked on ""please click here if you are having issues"", which worked.  The new password still didn't work on the app *sigh*. I called the location again and Kennedy transferred me to her manager.  The guy was helpful too because he sensed my frustration (of course I said that ""I've jumped through all the hoops you wanted me to, but I still can't pay for my food"".  I guess they don't really want curbside or business customers who just want a simple way to buy and pick up food.   They make it so hard to buy their food for a standard, chain restaurant.  I expect super trendy- hard to get in- restaurants to make it difficult  but not a place like this. BJ's- you already know this.  Make it easy for customers to want to spend money with you, not to deter spending.  Your staff was super helpful but your procedures/website is not."
Bradley M.,"Los Angeles, CA",515,5,,2.0,11/25/2016,"I love BJ's but tonight our waiter was an idiot. We ordered a spicy chicken Hawaiian pizza, but they brought out a Pizza with Ham instead of chicken. Neither my date nor myself eat pork, so keeping it wasn't an option. Our waiter offered to make a new one as expected, (which took another 15 min) but gave us an attitude as if we were being difficult or something. Then we both felt like he was rushing us to get out of there once our pizza was ready, as he brought it to us boxed up already. I honestly thought he would of for sure taken the pizza off the bill, but as you probably have guessed by now, he didn't. For this they get 2 stars. I don't see myself going back to that location."
Kristy L.,"Westminster, CA",446,8,6,5.0,6/20/2015,"What a wonderful restaurant to go to!  If it's either for family or just an outing with friends, this is the perfect place for it.  I've been to BJ's a couple times now and their food has a very excellent taste. Either you try their artichoke dip from their appetizer section to one of their exotic burgers, it's like my taste buds jump out with dance moves. Haha.  BJ's will always be my go to place for dinner!"
Courtney A.,"Huntington Beach, CA",67,2,,2.0,12/17/2016,"Had one of the worst experiences ever at a recent trip to BJs with my mom, sisters and nieces. Of our eight meals, four were made incorrectly. My sister and niece didn't get their food until the rest of us were almost completely done. But the worst part - neither the server or manager apologized once. We would've felt much better if we got an ""I'm sorry"" or ""your pazookies are on the house!"" Definitely won't be coming back here anytime soon (this is my first negative review anywhere, not generally a complainer)."
Jasmine R.,"Anaheim, CA",0,1,,1.0,7/3/2017,"I've been to this bjs before and never had a problem with it before. However, I recently came to this location again and Kayla M, our server, was incredibly rude! She would avoid our table and go to other tables who got there after us. She never checked up on our table, subtly told my friend she was wearing a basic/ugly shirt, waited 10 minutes for a simple side of ranch, said she was ""old as hell"" when we asked if she can take a picture of us with our polaroid camera, never asked if we wanted a refill on our drinks. The list goes on, she was rude and overall ruined our experience here."
April W.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,14,2,1.0,3/15/2016,"Do not order to-go from here! The first time I did it took over 45 minutes longer than what they told me... Said we were still waiting on my daughters kids pizza... Everything ended up being cold and mushy except for that pizza. Decided to give them another shot only for my order to be ready 30 minutes later than they quoted AGAIN. Not only does the to-go service suck but when you walk in the host seems to have NO CLUE what they are doing and the servers are just standing around,unhelpful, with no manager in sight. Bummer."
Darlene T.,"Los Angeles, CA",514,8,4,5.0,3/7/2017,"Came in during the dinner rush on a busy weekday the other night, and waited less than 10 minutes to be seated. The hostess and host did a great job in greeting and sitting us as efficiently as possible. These hosts do not slack around! You can tell they are constantly scanning and working to make sure guests are seated as soon as possible. I dine at this BJs frequently because of the service! I love the food, especially the Barbecue Chicken pizza, tomato mozzarella salad, chicken alfredo fettuccine, and strawberry lemonade (my usuals). Always end with either a cookies and cream/Oreo or chocolate chunk pizookie! You won't regret it. But why I consistently come back is the amazing and friendly service I always receive. My usual server is Mandukhai, who has such an effortless way about her that makes my dining experience feel comfortable. Mandukhai makes sure all my requests are met with efficiency and certainty. She always goes above and beyond in her service. I can also say the same for Connie and Cory! If you ever get Connie, you will get hit with so much fun and friendliness, it's infectious! Cory gives the best service, as well. He is so quick with every request and so freaking funny! Love this BJs because it's a big corporate restaurant that gives a small restaurant experience with its service. I don't usually like eating at corporate restaurants because the food tastes plain.....like it came off a conveyor belt system. BJs is not that, their food has quality and freshness that's hard to find in chain restaurants."
Jevonah K.,"Huntington Beach, CA",108,89,150,5.0,9/18/2016,"Andrew is the best server ever. He was very approachable and friendly. He served us our food quickly (thank you kitchen), and he gave me beer samples and I got my Jeremiah red. Andrew had a great smile and provided great service. BJ's is lucky to have him!"
Sherri G.,"Irvine, CA",324,421,1067,2.0,1/20/2014,"Mid-afternoon lunch during playoffs...went well until... Parking: A few open parking spots despite football playoffs starting in a few minutes.  Seating:  There was a ton of open booth seating in the main dining area but she wanted to seat us in the small drab room at the back of the hostess stand. I don't think so!  I think that's where they hide people who don't look beachy enuf.  I asked her for a booth so she redirected us to the main dining area close to a TV.   Food: The tortilla soup was more like a thick stew. I was disappointed that it wasn't more watery - is that strange?  I also ordered the bruschetta appetizer but it came after I was done with my main course.  The hubby's Cajun chicken pasta was a bit starchy/pasty with a strange taste. Me thinks they threw some cayenne pepper in the pot and labeled it ""Cajun"".  No complaints on the Caesar salad the hubs ate although it appeared to be swimming in dressing.  Service: It started out good enough but soon after we ordered, our waiter was switched out.  The replacement completely forgot about our existence.  My iced tea was never refilled so I started drinking my husband's Pepsi. We had to flag him down for our bill after waiting for quite a bit of time after we finished.  Service was really pretty crappy.  After many dining and happy hour experiences here, I'd say you'd have to belly up to the bar for the best service."
Zaynab B.,"Westminster, CA",0,6,4,3.0,5/25/2016,"I've had a lot of mixed experiences at this restaurant. From what I've seen and what my close friends and family have told me, the waiters and waitresses will either make your experience a good one or a very bad one.  On the good days, a waiter will seat us in the appropriate size booth/table, take my order while asking all the right questions, and deliver the food after 25 minutes (which is not bad during their busiest times).  On the bad days, they will seat you in a very cramped location, it will take about 20 minutes for a waiter to even approach you to ask what you're ordering, and over half an hour later the food comes in somewhat cold. I'm not saying I'll never come back to this BJ's, it's one of the few restaurants close to home that feels more appropriate for a nice restaurant dinner than the other places in Bella Terra.  Just beware that you might not get a good experience the first time around. P.s. I know I did not review their pizzas and other famous dishes, but think everyone knows they're food is pretty good and many yelpers already have good reviews posted (woot woot!)"
Shelby R.,"Buena Park, CA",76,3,,5.0,12/5/2016,These guys are right behind my work and are always able to get me in and out with ease! Ashley (works in the bar area) and she's great! Very fast service and always makes sure I am taken care of!
Jim K.,"Camarillo, CA",1371,503,3770,4.0,1/5/2015,I have eaten at a lot of BJ's but this one is a mile from the corp office and they didn't disappoint! We got very good service and the food was fresh tasty all three of us had salads one chicken Cesar and a Barbecue Chicken Chopped Salad i had the unlimited soup and salad with clam chowder was great taste. I am from the SF bay area and i know chowder ;) we didn't have any cocktails but in the past i always go for the Jeremiah Red. RED BEER! wanted a burger but teh rest of the crew was doing the4 new years salad thing so i didn't want to temp them.
Duke P.,"Placentia, CA",129,2,,1.0,11/22/2016,"My brother in law, our niece and nephew had the worst dining experience.  I will not blast via Yelp what happened but simply said the waitress told me not to complain to her Manager because she shared her thoughts that he was unapproachable.  Well her statement was definitely accurate although he was reluctantly apologetic his demeanor was spot-on.  I already wrote their corporate office via their website a scolding message and hope if one employee complains about their Manager that something is done to improve both front of the house and back of the house if those issues and inefficiencies are true."
