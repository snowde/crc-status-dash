Christine V.,"Laguna Hills, CA",194,232,492,4.0,11/23/2014,"My experience at this BJs has been alright, I have been here twice and usually go to the Downey or Cerritos locations. I'd say the Cerritos is my favorite as far as wait times and service. I have also gone to the one in Carlsbad when I lived over there and that is where I discovered the super scrum diddly umptious Jalapeño burger they have! Sooooo goooddddd lol. This BJs, however gave us pretty good service the first time. The wait wasn't too long and we had a nice experience. Last night we called ahead and spoke to a very nice employee named Autumn. She explained the wait time was 25 minutes so we asked to be added on the wait list. We drove over there as soon as we got off the phone with her. We arrived about 20 minutes later and noticed how packed it was and went up to the hostess to let her know we were there. She said she would call us once our table was ready. About 30 minutes pass by and we still hadn't got called. I don't have an issue with the wait because I saw how busy they were but I was wondering why we even called ahead and got on a wait list if we were going to end up waiting like we just arrived there anyway? I'm guessing it's just to make customers feel better. We ended up waiting the time like everyone else who just got there which kind of was a fail for us thinking we were covered on the wait list already. My bf was super hungry although I wasn't as hungry I was kind of bummed that the calling ahead didn't make a difference.  Right when we were going up to the hostess to tell her we were going to just go somewhere else we got the text that our table was ready, so we decided to stay since we already waited. We were sat and got a good sized booth for my bf, my son and I. The waiter came pretty quickly and was very nice to us.  We got a medium pizza half pepperoni extreme and half chicken bacon ranch (I loved it). We also got yummy Caesar salads to begin with and Nutty Brewnettes. My son got the apple juice and we all enjoyed our meal.  Overall service was good, food was good. The only issue was the wait list but it's understandable seeing it was a Saturday evening and all. I would return but maybe just on a weeknight next time."
Christine P.,"Garden Grove, CA",0,3,,3.0,4/23/2017,"Great restaurant but slow service! The pizookie there is amazing, get the chocolate chip!"
Erik H.,"Huntington Beach, CA",3,9,,2.0,10/22/2016,"I'm not a big fan of this place, but my SO insisted that we give it another try. I decided why not. We get there and request a table for two. Shortly after we check in, another couple walks in and asks for a table for two also. Five minutes pass and they sit the couple that arrived after us first. We go check to see if they wrote our name down to be seated and they say ""Oh yeah, we are just getting your table ready."" Okay? That doesn't make sense, but sure. A few minutes pass and they call us to be seated and walk us to our table. When we get there, there's literally like 4-5 tables empty next to our table... Whatever. Finally we get seated and the server takes our order. The server was actually very friendly and attentive. No complaints there. The food was, however, dissapointing yet again. Pasta was drowning in pasta sauce that the four shrimp that were in there almost floated. Thet chicken was plain and had no flavor. I imagine that is how eating cardboard must feel like. In conclusion, make sure they take your name down when you check in. They're just hanging out in the front so it's easy for them to miss your name while they gossip. Second, if you like having small portions, food with no flavor, and like paying full price anyways, then come on down to BJs."
Mr P.,"Fountain Valley, CA",0,6,4,3.0,7/17/2016,"The visit was ok. The waitress kept interrupting me when I spoke. We got spinach dip app, which is not the best. There pizza was amazing though as usual. My wife ordered a mojito which was pretty watered down, which is expected at a chain restaurant. I got the beer tasters which was for 7.95 and I was charged 10. Soooooooooo 3 stars is my rating."
Rynel V.,"Buena Park, CA",430,175,881,4.0,1/11/2016,"Darlene gives awesome customer service! She's super friendly & fun! Pizza was good as always. Tried the wings, the lemon pepper needs a little more lemon flavor. Other than that, yummy food, yummy beer, dope customer service!"
Joji J.,"Newport Coast, CA",78,59,127,3.0,9/15/2015,- don't order the sliders.  they taste worse than microwaved White Castle burgers.  mickey d's cheeseburgers taste better.  - they're nice about swapping out a dish you don't enjoy.
Stephanie H.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,12,,5.0,4/11/2017,"nice fun place to hang out with friends, great food and service"
Lisa T.,"Huntington Beach, CA",7,30,1,2.0,9/14/2015,"We usually love BJ's, it's our go to when the family can't decide where to go. However, this place was ridiculous. Food was good, but the service was awful.  The hostess was snooty and kinda rude, funny that you're working at BJ's and not some five star restaurant. Get over yourself. Our original server was good, but when ours went on break we never saw the next guy. He brought us our food and that was it. We ordered a wedge salad with no bacon, and at first it looked correct but when we started eating we saw that the bacon was all over. We did not get one refill on our drinks.  I do have to point out that when we got the bill the salad was on it. It was taken off after we pointed it out. All in all, it was not the best BJ's we have ever been to. Wouldn't recommend this location to anyone."
Sarah N.,"Anaheim, CA",348,101,58,4.0,8/8/2015,My friends and I wanted to grab a quick drink and a bite to eat. We decided to drop into bjs and eat there. The service there was mediocre but I didn't expect much because they were busy. Me and my boyfriend decided just to order dessert since they are known for their pizookies. I got the white chocolate mac nut pizookie and my bf the new beignet. I was happy with both and definitely would recommend the beignet.
Tori B.,"Westminster, CA",141,117,91,5.0,8/20/2015,"I don't know about these stories other people on Yelp are making up or why. BJ's is a great chain and this restaurant is consistently good. Good food and good service. Sure, I've been here on the crazy busy weekends where servers don't come check on you every five minutes. Who likes that, anyway? When you come on busy nights, if you are the sort of person who expects to be waited on hand and foot, I urge you to reconsider and just eat at home in your castle with your servants, not out with us common folk. Some highlights ... + 5.75 for a kids' meal. Choose your entree, type of side (ours enjoyed the smiley-face fries especially) and a drink. + Lunch deals, Mon-Fri until 3p. Kind of limited, but kind of awesome. Cheap prices on pizza, pastas, and sandwiches. We did the lunch pasta. It comes with your choice of soup or salad and is $1 cheaper than the normal pasta price. The lunch size still filled me up. Clam chowder was good. Served warm-hot. The Cajun chicken pasta was also good. Served piping hot. + Cheaper beers for lunch hour! Jeremiah Red is a good fruity choice and still has a 7.something ABV. Normally $5.50 a pint, came to about $3 during lunch time. + Friday afternoon, 2:30. Slow! Score. Server Cory was very friendly and attentive, but not too much so that it's annoying. He even offered to get my iced tea to go as we were paying! That was really cool. Here's the order .... tropical iced tea (free refills), chicken tender kids' meal with smiley fries and apple juice (served in a small cup with a lid, thank you), California chicken flat bread appetizer, two lunch orders of the Cajun chicken pasta with clam chowder, and a pint ... came to $48 after tax. We didn't have enough room for a Pazookie, which really feels like a crime! Skip the appetizer, save room for dessert! All in all, very good lunch, and BJ's always serves up really good meals in a comfy yet classy environment."
Angie B.,"Norco, CA",162,8,1,5.0,4/6/2017,We came with a big party and I have to say our server Gildi was really great. He made everything run smoothly and took care of everything. Best server in a long time.
Shayne T.,"Cypress, CA",30,4,,1.0,8/16/2015,"The worst dining expierence of my life. We call ahead and leave a reservation and are told 25 minutes, we show up in 15 and are told ""sorry you can't make reservations for a table of 8""......you took it why?""oh it doesn't guarantee a spot...it'll be 40 minutes"" My freinds went to the bar and it was happy hour, finally we are told our tables ready. Our table is litterally 3 steps from the bar and we're told we can no longer get happy hour prices, and the waitress recards everyone still drinking their booze...fine. We order 3 appetizers and ask them to be brought out before the food. 30 minutes later, no waiter no waitress *we had 2* i see them standing by the bar talking. So i get up and ask hey where are those apps? oh only 1 out of 3 was supposed to come out before....I ask everyone in my group they say no, the waiter and waitress take off. It's at this point we start walking to the bar to refill our drinks since the waiter and waitress haven't come back to check on us once at this 40 minute point finally 2 apps out of 3 come out. Food shows up, and before asking if anyone needs ranch or anything they just run away. At this point im livid, i open the kitchen door and ask for a few plates and some ranch. After getting the plates I talk tot he manager and am told ""oh wow....that's weird.....well i can get you some ranch"" Finally after the manager comes back they bring 4 plates of ranch with 3 different waiters sweet thanks.  After this everyone orders there pazaookies, the waitress and waiter combo send other people now to give us our food and forget to give us any spoons for the fucking thing. So we ask the new guys and they say sure no problem.They take 2 steps back and knock into another server with a pizza, the server drops it, one of the waiters say watch where your going to which the server that drops it screams ""YOU WATCH WHERE YOUR FUCKING GOING"" they go into the kitchen and start fighting. Long story short, if your looking for awful service, condescending managers and waitress/waiter combos and the greatest whitetrash family theater a bjs can put on look no further. Never will i eat in this dive again."
Giselle H.,"Anaheim, CA",1,7,9,4.0,3/2/2016,"The wait was a good hour but it was fine because the waiter and the food was great! Would definitely come back. I recommended the chicken thyme, it is to die for!"
Andre M.,"Sacramento, CA",12,11,4,1.0,7/28/2015,"The worst BJs experience I've had. Terrible service.  I would not recommend coming here with a group bigger than 8 people. Visited this location with our extended family (12 people) on a Monday night. We were seated on their patio and basically forgotten about. Drinks came out slow and it took 15 min for all the kids to get their waters and Sodas (they brought out a couple at a time). When we got our pizza and pasta, the waiter did not bring out the ranch or breadsticks that were ordered for another 20 min at which point we were done with the pizza. In the end when it came time to pay they either lost my credit card or forgot about us but I had to request to speak to the manager to let him know that we wanted to leave and needed our card back. The manager did not have time for us so one of the hostesses was helping us track my card down. Took another 20 min to get our card back. BJs is a place that MUST do a better job servicing big groups."
Thomas W.,"San Carlos, CA",0,13,,2.0,9/9/2015,"They don't take reservations, but I've been told to call 1/2h before and the table will be ready. I called 6:50 to get a table for 4 at 7:30pm. They told me no problem! We arrived 7:30 and they told us we were a bit late and they gave away our table! yeah! Right! They said that we'll get a new table in 10-20 minutes. After 50 min wait and talking to the host every 10 minutes we've got a table 8:20pm!!! The food was OK and the service was good as well. I wouldn't go there if I knew of their poor logistics and BS!!"
Samantha P.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,2,,5.0,2/27/2017,I went to BJ's today with my friend and I had the best experience! Our waiter was amazing. His name was Jesse and he was very nice and great at small talk. He came quickly with our food and he made my day!
Neil F.,"Los Alamitos, CA",135,84,360,3.0,9/20/2015,"Typical BJ's food.  I came here during a Sunday Football day, meaning that it is happy hour.  It seems that portions are getting smaller during happy hour compared to last year, but the quality is still the same.  I was disappointed by how understaffed they were.  The servers were hustling their tails off, but because this was Sunday Football Day, they could never really get on top of it.  We had a few appetizers and a pizza.  Decent, but nothing really to rant and rave about."
Mrs. S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",29,102,33,3.0,9/27/2015,"My daughter and came here for lunch on 9/26/15 for lunch. We ordered the special 2 for 25 deal. You get a choice of soup or salad, medium pizza and a poozkie. So we ordered our soup and salad and our pizza. We sat there for 20 mins and no soup no salad and then here comes the pizza. WTF? I dont want my pizza before my salad cuz now my pizza is going to get cold sitting there.  They brought us dirty plates and all the manager did was say ""we are sorry"". I hate that this is the only closest BJ' to us. I would go to a different. And to top it off this place is so slow."
Julio L.,"Laguna Beach, CA",0,63,5,1.0,9/22/2016,"The food was okay, but it's hard to mess up pancakes. I thought the service at the Laguna Hills BJ's was bad, but the HB location blows it away - absolutely the most horrible, nonexistent service ever, simply pathetic. I can't say anything more, this is being nice."
Ailene F.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,16,3,5.0,3/20/2017,Great food and service. Had the Piranha Pale ale nachos. It is not on the menu but we had it before so asked the waitress and it was available. Delicious.
