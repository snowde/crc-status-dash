Hend Q.,"Anaheim, CA",3,18,1,3.0,7/29/2016,"They're really really really slow with service! We could already tell our food was going to take long because of how long the appetizer took. The food was good, I would recommend buffalo chicken pizza! Other then that they're just really slow. Took her a while to get us our checks."
Ray M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",3,122,6,4.0,7/29/2016,This bjs is quite nice with ample parking. The food is usually good and the service however can be very up and down. For the most part it's great but sometimes it's very slow.
Brandy M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",82,7,,1.0,3/14/2017,"Tonight we went to BJ's with with a party of 7. Four small children and three adults we put our name in and were told 15 minutes (not a problem) our text message confirmation came through a moment later letting us know our wait time was 20-25 minutes (ok that's fine, not a problem). We started checking in with the hostess about 30-35 minutes after waiting and were told they were cleaning our table (awesome we're so ready to eat). After about another 5-10 minutes we inquired again and were told a party hasn't left yet. We saw another booth open that would fit our part perfectly and asked the hostess if we could be seated in that booth. We were told no, there is no server for that table (alright we're not ok now, the ""hangry"" children, poor service and lack of communication is now effecting us. We were just told our table was being cleaned). After over an hour wait time we are finally seated and asked to speak to the manager. When the manger came over we simply tried (he had his speech ready and didn't want to hear it) to let him know we never would have waited here had we been told the wait was over an hour. That they need to adjust the wait time to reflect the actual time people wait. The manger basically told us to turn that frown upside down. Telling us we are ""here seated now let's just have fun""! Yeah no thanks, peace and we left!  This is a Tuesday 6pm, you have an entire empty patio and empty tables maybe your understaffed...I can understand that as a small business owner myself, but at least act like you care."
Rob W.,"Huntington Beach, CA",327,441,710,3.0,6/17/2015,"Was in the mood for some deep dish pizza and a salad to boot.  The place was packed, but we managed to get seated within 5 minutes. Bravo!!!!We started with the Thai chicken mango salad.  The salad was part of their light side menu selections.  It was spicy and delicious, but was lacking on the chicken. The meat lovers pizza was up next and it was a tasty pizza indeed.  Substituted the ham for mushrooms.  We had two pieces each and took the rest home."
Jennifer W.,"Fountain Valley, CA",41,32,13,1.0,7/25/2015,We had the worst experience ever. Went with family out of town and regret it. We had to ask for water several times. Our food came way after other large groups who enter way after us. The manager did say sorry and took off a discount but didn't give everyone a discount. That was not right. We all suffered through an awful time. I did tell the manager the waiter was nice but in the end the kid was a punk! Rude and disrespectful. Very disappointed. This customer service or lack there of lost the business of 6 family's and their friends. I felt like the manager did make it right till Jordan was a punk and only certain people got a discount. Bad all the way around
Joe K.,"Fountain Valley, CA",17,81,20,1.0,6/19/2015,"This place has really gone downhill. We came last night, party of 7 for a Birthday celebration. The place was packed, we found a long table in the bar...cool.  The waiter was doing his best but he was slammed. Drink service slow, ordered appetizers : Fried Calamari, Spring Rolls and Fried Mozz. All of the came out cold to lukewarm, the cheese was ok. The Calamari was cold, the spring rolls were smaller than egg rolls, were bland, and....... You got it, cold. Ordered a large BJ's Favorite (extra sauce) , came out dry and.....cold. Service ok, drinks ok and terrible food. Never coming back"
Jessica W.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,4,1,3.0,10/21/2015,"The service was great. Conversely, the dish was more soupy like than pasta. Furthermore, it was very watery and bland. Good thing they have good beer to make things better:) For being open late it is still a great atmosphere overall."
Amy V.,"Orange County, CA",1024,539,1570,3.0,10/22/2015,i would only come here during happy hour.   - mini pizza for $6 - i usually get BJ's favorite - chicken wings $4 - so good and one of my favorite thing on the happy hour  menu.  they have really good ranch! lol - of course you have to get the pizookie.  I like the white chocolate macadamia nut one
SUSAN B.,"Garden Grove, CA",62,68,1,3.0,4/9/2016,"BJ's has been my favorite pizza for years. I haven't been there in a while because I don't eat pizza much any more. I went there last night and ordered the BJ's favorite. If you are a crust lover, this is the pizza for you, but if you are expecting toppings, this pizza was greatly lacking. I heard the father at the table next to us complain about his pizza too. Come on BJ's, do what you do well. Don't start skimping on us. Toppings aren't that expensive, make your pizzas like you use too."
Kathy N.,"Orange, CA",3,6,52,2.0,9/4/2014,"The bf wanted to have some ot theri homemade rootbeer so we stopped by our local BJs.   What a disappointment! Both the food and the ""rootbeer"" were less than we expected from BJs.  The soda wa flat and the food sub par. We had the Calamari and Ahi poke for apps and while I love calamari ..... it was chewy and a little on the hard side. NOT tender like its supposed to be.  Bf got the Cali burger and wedge cut fries. I had the Chicken club with crispy thin cut fries. My sandwich was pretty good but my fries were soggy not crispy and the wedge cut fries were not good at all . What happened to the BJs that we know and love ????"
Mimi B.,"Orange County, CA",64,291,134,2.0,8/13/2014,Well..... The menu looks amazing but I was not happy with the food.  Cobb salad  total YUKK.  Not sure if it was normal or something was bad but it was not a Cobb salad.   Fries with the chicken were soggy and no one ate them.  Flatbread California club was only edible meal.  Too bad it had canned tomatoes cause the crust was great.   Super refills in sodas and then i saw the 2.95 price. Yikkes! Makes me wonder how expensive those craft beers would be.   Great service.  Super sonic cold in here. Bring a parka if you come.
Jonathan Z.,"Cypress, CA",595,1179,1175,4.0,9/24/2012,"There's this list my sister keeps.  Every time she comes back home from NYC, she needs to hit certain things. A California burrito from anywhere in San Diego, 85 degrees (the bakery in Irvine), BJ's...the list is quite extensive.   You could always get a good meal at BJ's and ever since they made their root beer part of their bottomless drinks, I have been more inclined to make that visit.   half BJ's Favorite and half sweet pig:  half BJ's Favorite and half BBQ chicken:  I've had most of their pizza selections, but the one I don't have a pictured, the great white pizza, is my favorite (I'm the only one who seems to like it in my group).  It's made with Alfredo sauce that has mushrooms, garlic, tomatoes, Parmesan cheese and grilled chicken breast.  I am salivating as I type.   To finish we got two types of pizookie:  It's a warm cookie with ice cream on top.  This says America in every bite.  I know it's a chain, but sometimes chains have their purpose."
Correen B.,"Garden Grove, CA",388,533,303,3.0,5/13/2014,"We had lunch here after visiting the AAA office in the same parking lot.  I really appreciate their lunch specials for $10 and under.  There are about 20 items on the menu to chose from. I love their flatbread pizzas because I don't care for a really thick crust.  I like the California Club pizza because it had bacon, avocado chunks, cheese and chicken.  They will also let you substitute a wedge salad for the mixed green salad.   My husband ordered this lemon chicken dish that is served with vegetables and brown rice.  He was a member of the clean plate club. The server was awesome, and very attentive.  She was quick to bring me a glass of ice to cool off my iced tea.  She was quick to apologize for the warm iced tea. Hey, I'm not complaining, it's fresh!  I did notice that every person we had contact with from the front desk to the server was pushing the BJ's loyalty program."
Chels C.,"Rossmoor, CA",6,29,22,5.0,1/1/2016,This place has a great vibe. I find that sitting at the bar is just as awesome as sitting at a regular booth. Not to mention the service is faster. The main dish to eat here is the pizza. You'd be crazy not to try the house root beer that they make. It's a nice mix between Barq's and IBC. The PIZOOKIE speaks for itself. The trio pizookie is your best bet because you can try 3 different amazing pizookies at once. It's a little pricey but so worth it. Craft matters as they say..basically this is a great place for the best beers and the cocktails are pretty neat too. :) happy eating!
Beverly G.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,8,5,1.0,6/16/2015,"The worst place ever  We have ordered  calamari appetizer and flat bread plus two mains  After few bites of the appetizers which was disgusting, we cancel mains paid for starters. And left never looking back.  I will never, never go back there!!!  It's topical chain/bar quality food - inedible. I  don't know why people even go there. Well not everyone knows what a good food is. Me being a Cordon Blue graduate gives me credentials to know."
Ayana S.,"Long Beach, CA",128,11,1,5.0,7/14/2016,I came here solo. I thought why not take my damn self out. I sat at the bar ...  Jordan and Holly... They treated me so well. I live in Long Beach but I might come back just for them!
Jonathan W.,"Huntington Beach, CA",2,51,3,1.0,11/6/2016,"0 stars if I could. I've never been to a restaurant where one bite of their food could make you lose your appetite completely. I mean, even Taco Bell, which gave me the Hershey squirts some years ago gave me a pleasant experience on the front end. BJs, your cooks are an embarrassment. We will not be coming back. I felt like I was being robbed. Seating was really slow despite open tables. It took forever to get our food (a salad and a bison burger) and the bison burger turned out to be a dry, shriveled, rubbery, burnt, concave meat puck that was inedible. The cooks obviously don't know what the difference between searing and cooking means. The server had offered to replace my inedible platter, which was nice - but the chicken wings I got after that was pretty much just as bad. The chicken wings took forever to come out as well. I don't know what is wrong with their kitchen staff, but I would hate to be here on a busy night because the majority of customers were only getting drinks. I'm so disappointed I still had to pay for chicken wings that were sub-par even to mcdonalds chicken nuggets. What a disgrace."
Mara M.,"Garden Grove, CA",73,34,30,4.0,7/12/2015,"Came in super late and our server was amazing! Sierra was on top of everything, drinks, refills, cleaning, everything! The kitchen kinda messed up the burger (no guacamole on the guacamole burger? Whaaa?) but Sierra communicated well and fought the kitchen staff for our guac! Lol. Poke appetizer was good, Magnolia peach beer was good... PB & J pizookie was... Interesting. Sometimes you go out for the food, but come back for the service. We'll be back and recommend Sierra to all."
Cheryl L.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,23,,2.0,2/2/2017,"We have been regular customers of BJs and have enjoyed our visits and their beer dinners.  However due to our restricted diet, we can no longer eat here.  The only thing on their menu we could eat were their Veggie Tacos (always loved the Mediterranean Tacos).  We ordered them and they were unpleasant to look at and to eat.  Since BJs is a CA company, I would think they could have at least one edible vegetable entree.  Very disapointed!"
JB J.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,12,2,1.0,7/29/2016,"Horrible service.  Got charged $35 for 1 beer, then they ""fixed"" it to $12.  Wtf kind of service is this?  They then tell me it will be 3-5 business days to get that money back.  Bartender is a joke.  Avoid this place!!!! Plenty of better spots to have a drink at the block in Orange."
