Jessica S.,"Carson City, NV",29,31,4,2.0,6/10/2016,Food is good but do not go for happy hour Friday. Specials are only offered in the bar area but the area is small and people take up a 4 top with 2 people. You cannot get the HH specials in the restaurant. I can take my money elsewhere and so should you.
Roxy A.,"Westminster, CA",0,3,,1.0,10/4/2016,"Right when we walked in, the service was awful. The host did not greet us with a warm welcome. It seems like this place is very short staffed. The server took forever to greet our table (it was just my boyfriend and I). We ordered appetizers and my salad came out before the appetizers. I thought appetizers were meant to eat before the actual entree?  Once all of the food came out, we were ready to eat BUT we were not greeted with utensils. Also, we never got refills. To sum it up, horrible experience. Will not come back to this location at least. The manager on duty seemed to just be walking around and not helping his staff who seemed to be busy."
Victor G.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,14,,5.0,10/26/2015,"We were in the area and decided to go in on the whim. We didn't go in expecting the custom pizookie this time, but gave it a chance anyway (the manager did comment on our last post, but never replied to our response after).  Cory, our server, was great from start to finish. He timed everything out perfectly, and kept our drinks full. He checked on us frequently enough to reassure us we were being taken care of but not too much that it was overwhelming or annoying. Best of us all, he made the pizookie happen.  Great service, truly. Thanks Cory."
Lisa H.,"Westminster, CA",57,43,250,1.0,9/13/2014,"This BJ place used to be a lot better. We came here just last week and got entree (party of four) and food was delicious all around. We decide to come back today and get pizza since we didn't order last time. Been awhile since we order pizza from here. Came here for the BJ Favorite... first off the dough wasn't crispy and secondly it didn't taste like pizza dough. Had more of a bread dough taste to it. Order soooooo many pizza from here and never disappoint as today. It didn't taste good, not crispy, and soggy. Flavor was off. Pizza was off. Sad :( Tried the new peanut butter smore pizookie. Heard how good it was. All of the pizookie cookie dough wasn't cook :( :( :( :(  End up eating just the ice cream of it.  Didn't get any drink/water refill at our table. Overall a bad mess today. Waste of our time and money. We were still hungry :( Kitchen people... please get your food straight. Been coming here for a very long time!"
Daisy D.,"Santa Ana, CA",779,122,71,3.0,4/18/2015,"Of course this place always has a long wait, but what is neat is that they have a cool text message notifier so you know when your table is ready. Once I received my text message, it turned out that my table wasn't available yet???  Once seated, getting a waiter to your table takes longer than usual. Maybe it's because they're understaffed? I understand that this place is busy- but having bad customer service isn't gonna make it any busier. I simply asked for a water refill, which took my waiter very long which wasn't cool because I was thirsty.  Food: 10/10  Service: 5/10"
Melissa W.,"Huntington Beach, CA",369,155,125,1.0,3/3/2015,"So today 10 minutes before the server came to us. Then when we order we have to asks for silverware and then wait and wait. I told her we want to order pozookie she says let me drop this drink and be right back. 15 minutes later we have to ask for a manager and then she comes over with an attitude. ""I wish I could split myself up"" please we could see you shooting the shit with the table. We watched you tried to wave you down, don't act like you are swamped. If you can't handle 3 tables get a new job. (Ok sorry I am a little pissed)"
Courtney H.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,3,1,1.0,12/26/2016,honestly we didn't get seated for 20 minutes with other tables open in the restaurant . Our waitress mandukhai was complete ass. She argued with us that we COULDN'T have separate checks and then left and had another guy come back to give us the checks. What a rude move. she needs to be fired we are the priority here
Eric F.,"Anaheim, CA",80,56,192,5.0,5/27/2016,"BJ'S is a great restaurant for family and friends.  They have good food lots of choices.  Their deep dish pizza is so good.  We had a wedge salad, deep dish pizza and desert pizookie.  Pizookie is a large warm cookie with ice cream.   The best thing about BJ'S is the service.  Tonight Jordan was our server.  So attentive felt like we were at Ruth Chris steak house.  Never waited for anything.  He has eyes like an eagle.  Great job Jordan.  10 stars to Jordan and the great service, all staff is so friendly.  Great night out."
Ben S.,"Mission Viejo, CA",3,26,,5.0,6/21/2016,"Popped in for a family dinner just before Father's Day for a birthday celebration. Waited quite a long time, but the staff was handling the rush and the crowded foyer really well, and there were plenty of games to watch while waiting. The food was excellent, the service, once we were seated, was great - Gildi was on top of everything and very friendly to everyone - and the birthday celebrant and dads at the table got some nice gifts from the house. Looking forward to the next excuse to go!"
Jade P.,"Anaheim, CA",0,12,,1.0,6/21/2016,"This was the worst service ever. I waited 30 minutes to be seated which I didn't mind for a good meal. When I was sat I ordered the chips and guacamole appetizer it took 47 minutes for it to come out, and on top of that the server checked on us 1 time between the time we ordered the appetizer and received it. I ended being there over 2 hours just to eat. I will not go back."
Bo D.,"Irvine, CA",0,26,80,2.0,10/19/2014,"Why would anyone go to B.J.'s when Selma's is in business?  Because Selma's is too far from home :( The food is okay (not when you remember you can get a slightly better version of every item at Selma's), but the service is painfully slow. This is chain-wide, even when you get a really good waitress like we did last time. They must have an impossible management system for the servers. I don't get it. I've never had decent service at a B.J.'s unless it was a slow time of day and I sat at the bar and there were at least two bartenders."
Susan G.,"Garden Grove, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/10/2017,"We always seem to have issues at BJs, cerritos, downey and huntington beach, but we keep getting offers and gift cards so we keep going back.  Food is good, but order is usually never right.  My husband ordered a veggie burger and got real meat, and had to vomit twice, thankfully he did vomit or he may have wound up at the ER, for allergies, and has not eaten a hamburger in at a very, very long time.  The manager came over and had me fill out a form, but i believe that is to cover their butts.  Do the cooks not read the tickets, do the waiters not double check the food they are serving is correct, what is wrong with this establishment.  This was not just a simple mistake, this was a scary one."
Bonnie A.,"Riverside, CA",58,9,,5.0,6/15/2016,"We had a party of 20 women from High School and had reservations at BJs at 1:00 PM   We waited at BJs until 1:45PM and still had no table.  We called Lazy Dog and asked them if they could get us a table for 20 to 22 people.  We walked across the street walked in our table was ready for us.  The service was great, our waitess Denise was wonderful, even did seperate checks for all of us.  The food was fantastic.  We will make sure we come back again.  Thanks also the manager Dillion for setting this all up for us and making our get together a success.  Great Job. Thanks  Bonnie Lockhorst"
Myra K.,"Irvine, CA",147,19,10,2.0,9/10/2016,"Okay I freaking love pizookies at bj's right like who doesn't?! So my friends and I (large group about ten people) came in just wanting to split a party pizookie, we get seated after a few minutes and I kid you not it literally took 20 minutes for anyone to come and ask if we wanted anything to drink, after that it took another 20 minutes for them to take our order!!! Like yeah I understand it's busy but that's just rude??? My friend had to physically go up to two different staff members and it still took that long! It wasn't a huge issue because we came for dessert we weren't starving or anything but after we ordered our simple party pizookie the waiter tells us it could take a while because there's a special promotion today that gives customers a free pizookie for every entree ordered like fam actually made us wait super long, didn't start off by telling us the promotion, and then told us we were going to have to wait even longer for the damn pizookie. I go to bj's often and don't usually have issues like this so it was surprising to me. Giving it two stars because despite poop service I still freaking love pizookies"
Calvin V.,"Newport Beach, CA",1,9,,1.0,3/12/2016,"Here I am once again After 10pm and the service is a 1 star at best. Tried to get food to go and when it was brought out half was for here and half was Togo. We gave this place a break for a few months hoping for a better experience but once again we've been disappointed. On top of all that they bring it back out with out a Togo bag, napkins or utensils. Coming from a person in the industry I'm sad to say I'll never go back there again. I love their bbq chicken pizza too! This location should be closed by 10 every night if that's how the service is always gonna be."
Rusty M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",2,33,5,2.0,5/7/2015,Order carne fries and no meat and no Sauce. This place is a joke. I will contact corporate over this. I asked for BBQ sauce and he brings me a few table spoons. A joke.
Ruben P.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,5,2,5.0,12/17/2015,Having dinner with my family and the waitress is really nice and took our order right away didn't let us wait. The beer here is good. The kids menu is good for my boys wish they had chicken nuggets or Minni pizzas. But other than that everything is going smooth.
Jason C.,"Long Beach, CA",0,4,,2.0,2/27/2016,BJ's has the worst service.  This company exploits consumer confidence.  Patrons need to be omnipresent so to receive a complete order. The manager withheld a nickel out of my change. The experience was ludicrous and one BAD JOKE after the next.
Criselle M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",60,22,9,1.0,2/23/2016,"I am insanely disappointed in my visit to BJ's this afternoon. My friend and I got to the restaurant at 11:40 and were seated pretty promptly and ordered right away because we already knew what we wanted. I ordered the dinner sized portion of the salmon and quinoa and my friend ordered the salad with ahi tuna. We waited for our order for 40 minutes, finally at 12:30 we asked for our food which had not come out yet to be bagged as take out for us to just take back to work and eat. The server, Ryan, was very nice, and informed us that the salmon usually takes 15 minutes to cook. But from being seated and ordering at 11:50am to not receiving our food until after 40 minutes of waiting did not make up for the fact it took twice as long to cook my 15 minute salmon. Now here is the real kicker. Once I did get to open my to-go box up expecting to see a dinner portion of salmon and quinoa, I am met with less than a cup of quinoa scattered around my salmon. I've had the lunch portion of salmon and quinoa bowl at the BJ's in Torrance, and what was in my to-go box did not even measure up to that. There was probably enough asparagus and mushrooms, and the salmon was a good size, but did they not even think that I would notice that I had at most 4 spoonfuls of quinoa as my dinner entrée? I took a picture and will post it after I finish this little rant. But I hope that you who are reading this know that BJs had poor service at lunch time, middle of the week on a Tuesday, and that they bamboozle you with their take-out food. I am 100% sure they knew that I was getting a substandard portion for a lunch and dinner portion, and that absolutely disgusts me. Shame on you cooks! I hope managers check up on that after seeing this."
Christi Lynn C.,"Newport Beach, CA",532,167,343,5.0,5/25/2015,Huge menu with great happy hour! Server (Ben) was great on a very busy Sunday night he never missed a beat. Ordered the tomato basil salad. *Loved it. Ceaser salad was huge and fresh. Fish and chips *Fabulous. A couple glasses of Estancia Cabernet and a Blonde.  I was exhausted and hungry after a long day of travel and this was exactly what was needed. Great go to for late night dining.
