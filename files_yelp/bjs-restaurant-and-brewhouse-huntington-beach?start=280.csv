Long T.,"Redwood City, CA",41,133,13,4.0,3/25/2016,Great service and food.   When you go to BJ'S you know you will get your money worth.  I love the TVs and music. Pizza was very fresh and the beer was cold.
Randoll C.,"Los Angeles, CA",582,1424,6023,5.0,11/24/2011,"Disclaimer: Review is for the Red Velvet Pizookie (only) After a disappointing dinner, I opted for some comfort food for dessert. BJ's was my choice. Nothing like a Pizookie with ice cream to make life's downs go away. Not that life isn't good - I was just bummed with dinner. Anyway, it had been a while since I was at a BJ's last so I hadn't had their Red Velvet Pizookie. I also had a hot chocolate as it was getting a little chilly out.  Beware - it's really sweet. Just like how I like my desserts. I finished it off to the point where I was scraping every last bit off the pan. If I were at home, I'd probably be licking the pan clean. It may not be for everyone but it sure did hit the spot for me.  I'll definitely be ordering that again!"
J D.,"Huntington Beach, CA",3,23,2,1.0,3/31/2015,"I asked our server for a pizza with half-and-half toppings, one half pepperoni for my son and one half mushrooms for me. Our server said we would be charged for TWO full toppings. I explained that I didn't want two toppings, but a half portion of perpperoni on one side and another half portion of musrooms on the other side. Nope, she said she would still charge for two. Since when does .5 + .5 = 2? OK, so let's get this straight. What if I ordered a 2 topping pizza (pepperoni and mushrooms) and asked the server to have the chef put all the pepperonis on one side and all the mushrooms on the other. By our server's logic, I would be charged for FOUR toppings.  Oh, and she was rude on top of all that.  I walked out, and I am never walking back in. What a joke of a restaurant."
Gary C.,"Fountain Valley, CA",305,107,32,2.0,12/14/2015,"Hit or a miss, I've came here about twice this month. First time was pretty good but the most recent visit wasn't that great. This review is mostly about their service, as their food is pretty good and I don't have any issues with. Location: Right off the 405 and Beach. Parking lot can get busy at times depending on when you come. Service: I'm usually not picky on service, but as someone who works in the service industry, this has got to be an all time low for me. The person that served us was obviously training because he had a guy right behind him the entire time watching his every move.  First mistake was not introducing himself, or the person behind him. Second off our waters were forgotten, and didn't come until 15 mins later when we reminded our server. I would have understood if it was a super busy night, but there were a lot of empty tables and they seemed very staffed.  After we ordered, our party of 4 changed to a party of 6 because 2 more of our friends decided to join us. We advised our server that we needed a bigger table and he said we will get one very shortly. Our 2 friends arrived really soon. The server sees that our group of 4 grew to 6, yet he said nothing. 15-20 mins arrive and we remind him that we are a party of 6 now and we need a new table. He says he's working on it still and then our food proceeds to come. One of our friends wanted to order something, flagged down one of the workers (who i believe was a food runner). That guy flat out told my friend he wasn't our server and just walked away continuing to do what he was doing. That's the first time I've ever experienced that kind of service. No matter what your job is, busser, runner etc. you don't tell a guest I'm not your server and just walk away. At the most you could have said I'm not your server, but I can get your server to see what you would like to add etc.   So finally 20 mins in, we get our table switch. We notice some some of the food were wrong. Fries were forgotten on my order, but they quickly fixed that. We had our sort of private patio room which was nice, and the server kept checking up on us. However the damage was already done as we all felt like the service started really bad. This being the Huntington Beach location and the headquarters just across the street, I expected their service to be at least decent. What a shame.  Drinks and Food: My favorite beer here to get is the Jeremiah Red. It's their signature beer, which is a strong ale and one of my favorite ones to get when I come here. The food is pretty good. Good sizable portions ranging from their pasta, to burgers. If you have room for your stomach, save room for dessert and order a pizookie."
Penni C.,"Huntington Beach, CA",83,26,5,2.0,12/17/2014,I have been to BJS many times and to this location the most. It has been my go to spot for a long time. Service here the past few times has not been so great. I thought I would try again last night. Very sorry that I did. Waited for about five minutes for anyone to come to the table. Would not mind this if they were busy. But it was not. When the food came to the table we did not have any place settings. That took another several minutes to get while the food was getting cold. The server really did not check on us. We had to ask for more drinks. Let's not talk about how the menu has changed. This has not changed for the better. They need to bring back the old menu. If you are looking for a beer they have them. If you are looking for good food and good service this is not the place to come.  This will not be my go to spot anymore. To bad....I have the BJS rewards card and I have used it a lot. Not anymore!
Frank O.,"Orange County, CA",154,60,40,3.0,6/7/2015,"We tried it again. Took a while for me to want to go, but my son got a reward at school for a free menu item, and he wanted to get their pasta.  It ended up being a pleasant dinner with descent food.  I really liked that they left the pizza in the pan again because it stayed warm longer, or at least it seemed as if it did. They service was considerably better than I expected especially for a night that they were very busy, So in this trip, we had descent service, the food was brought out in a fair amount of time and was not burnt, plus our son had a free meal. Perhaps I might offer BJ's up as a family dinner option again. I would not call it one of my favorites again, as it used to be, but perhaps if we have one or two more positive trips, maybe it can get there again."
Brittany M.,"Westminster, CA",19,178,10,5.0,2/16/2015,"I've been to this location twice now. It's usually been hit or miss at other locations but this one has always been spot on!  Today we had a very attentive and friendly server, and the hostess was also very friendly. The food was cooked perfectly and we weren't rushed out. The atmosphere was nice and mostly quiet, not too crowded.  I will definitely come back here again."
Lydia D.,"Simi Valley, CA",17,30,7,2.0,6/9/2015,"Normally I like BJ's.......ordered the chicken lettuce wraps...skimpy portion of chicken (couldn't even use up the 6 lettuce pieces) and the taste was pretty subpar. The wraps at Yard House are far far better. We went during happy hour, but my group was seated at a table, so they wouldn't let us get any of the happy hour deals. The restaurant was pretty empty, but just asking what the happy hour offers in the bar were was like pulling teeth.  At the end we wanted to split the check (because a couple of us had coupons) and they refused to split the check, and would only accept the one coupon.  Did I mention that our waitress didn't come check on us and the food took forever to come out of the kitchen?"
Daniel F.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,8,5,2.0,5/26/2016,Staff was not the best.  We went on a weekday at 10pm plenty of tables open but still took 15 minutes to get seated.  Waitress complained to us that she didn't get tipped that well ( i wonder why?) then for whatever reason they traded our waitress for a waiter (we were 3 couples so don't think gender was an issue) he didnt give us a name or anything he just asked is what we wanted.  And for some reason he always left when there was one person left to order we where still talking and he would just leave then come back couple minutes later then say did i get everyone?  Only reason im giving two stars is because food was decent and it was happy hour so beers kept us from getting upset.  I dont recommend this place unless ur not in a hurry and don't mind waiting and if you dont mind baf customer service.  It was my first time here maybe i need to give it another shot dont know
Ricardo P.,"Westminster, CA",370,10,1,1.0,11/4/2016,"I have been here about 15 times with my girlfriend. We have made this our new spot and every time we have gone everything had been good. From food to service. One day we were over charged $130 dollars because the machines weren't working. We were upset but they ended up fixing the problem. Today is November 4 2016 and I had a really bad experience.  My girlfriend ordered the chicken tortilla soup and I ordered  the steak. We waited 1 hour for the food. We didn't complain about the wait because it's a Friday night.  We had a problem with my steak. The steak was burned and the soup had a ton of hairs. At this point the waiter came and said he would bring the manager or owner on his request. We didn't ask for him because we were calm. The owner never came. We waited another 30 minutes for the food to come out. My steak came out and again it was burned.  I was fed up so I didn't eat it.  By the way I didn't mention my girlfriends replacement soup because the waiter forgot it and just brought the bill.  Once again he said the ""owner"" would come but once again he didn't.  I was still charged full price for all this. We always order the exact same thing.  We aren't people that like to complain but this was to much.  I hope someone could get back to me because I payed for all my food to not have it served. I'll change my rating when problem is solved."
Isabel H.,"Redwood City, CA",11,2,,4.0,11/4/2016,"Long story short, I was there last Thursday. It was experience to say the least but everything worked out thanks to the assistant manager and manager."
Katherine A.,"Long Beach, CA",27,45,26,3.0,12/15/2014,Stopped by here on a Sunday afternoon to have some lunch with my husband in between some shopping. It was pretty busy because of Sunday football. We sat in the bar and waited about 10 minutes until someone brought us menus. I was really craving a Bloody Mary and I was greatly disappointed. The Bloody Mary was bland and tasted like tomato sauce. I had to fix it by adding some lime to cut the thickness and sweetness of the tomato flavor.  Our waitress was very nice. I ordered the Asian chop salad which was okay  the lettuce was old but I as starving so I devoured it.    The happy hour is good and that's all they have going for them.
Theresa T.,"Garden Grove, CA",18,68,495,5.0,3/13/2014,Came during lunch hour  :)  I think it was a Wednesday ... Maybe it was a Monday... Idrrrrr I went with a friend and we got seated right away! :)  The staff was very friendly  The food was filling!!!!  I don't even remember the name of what I got .... Lolol but it was good! It was from the lunch special menu tho!
Eric V.,"Costa Mesa, CA",0,17,,1.0,10/29/2016,Worst service ever! Second time I've gone through this at this place. I will definitely not come back anymore. They messed up our order (just like the last time). Food is great but service is bad!!!
Jennifer G.,"Orange, CA",9,21,2,5.0,3/4/2014,"Last night I attended the IPA tasting and dinner. It was hosted by the Assistant GM who was very knowledgable on IPAs, their history and the different tastes.  The event included 9 beers to taste and a 4 course meal. The hush puppies were a great starter, and cooked perfectly. The citrus salmon was amazing. The beers varied in flavor and hops. There were several palate cleansers to prepare us for the next course and beer tasting. The pazookie with vanilla ice cream and caramel drizzled was well worth the calories. I will definitely go to their next event and be back for more of their beer on tap."
Patty W.,"Hemet, CA",44,15,4,1.0,3/25/2016,"Awful experience at this location. Would not recommend going here. Was seated by a drunk party of 12 that screamed through 1/2 of our dinner despite asking the manager to address the problem. He excused the behavior by saying it was a ""sports bar."" Once we were finally moved we had no utensils or water service. After going after the utensils myself, they were brought to the table-without any water service for the duration of the meal. The food for table wasn't brought out together, some of it was 15 minutes delayed from the rest. The service was fragmented, it is clear that the management is not in touch with concepts of customer service. We won't be back to this location."
Adam A.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,22,3,1.0,10/22/2014,"Its sad when a favorite hang out spot like Bj's Pizza is ruined by bad management and that's exactly what happened to me on a very special night.......... I came here on a Saturday night to celebrate a big event in my life and we were seated, served and treated with respect by the waitress until a giant cricket jumped on our table, in front of my wife and scared the living Christ out of us. The cricket proceeded to jump all around the table, booth, bench and over my wife several times as the bus boy was swatting at it  with his cleaning cloth. Wow, ok well my wife and I had seen enough so we asked for the bill because we were not about to dine with the cricket guts all over our table area.  The waitress was very busy so my wife went to the hostess booth to explain what happened and the hostess was very polite and demanded that we explain what happened to the manager. This is where it all went down hill...... Manager: ""You had to talk to me about something?"" (angry and upset that we pulled him away from some seemingly important undertaking) Wife: ""There was a giant cricket on our table and we are ready to go eat somewhere else because we lost our Bj's appetite.""  Manager: ""Well we all have crickets, its a pretty common thing, I have crickets at my house too."" Wife: ""Well we are ready to go so can we have the bill?"" Manager: ""Ill comp your pizza but that's  the best I can do"" Wife: ""Well thank you but we just want to get outta here so can we have the check?"" Manager: ""I cant comp the whole check."" (keep in mind we never asked for or intended to get any comp just the check and some respect for the situation, our check was $17 so far.. we were a party of two.....not trying to take advantage) Me: ""We don't want your comp pizza just give us the bill so we can leave"" ""So you say you have crickets at your house so were supposed to accept them here at Bj's?"" ""What does the Kitchen look like if theres bugs in the dining room?"" Manager: ""Look man, I compped the pizza for you so I don't know what else you want me to do......"" AS YOU CAN SEE: this is a simple ""Dropping the ball"" situation in customer service. How do you become a manager if you don't know the simple skill of SYMPATHIZING WITH THE CUSTOMER, Acknowledging the concern, or maybe just ACT LIKE YOU GIVE 2 SH!TS!!!!! WE WILL NOT BE RETURNING TO THIS RESTAURANT; Due To Bad Management!"
BettyLou H.,"Irvine, CA",160,180,8,2.0,9/29/2014,"Good atmosphere with lots of TV screens showing ice hockey & basketball. My friend and I both ordered ribeye steaks. Her steak was quite bland and mine was bland & very very tough.  I complained to the waitress who said she would speak to the manager. A short time later I was presented with the full bill & when I asked about the manager's views it was clear the waitress hadn't spoken to him/her. I used to enjoy the pizzas here, but that was a long time ago..."
Jayne T.,"Huntington Beach, CA",26,17,,4.0,10/3/2016,"doing much better, i understand they are a busy place and cooking times can vary last few times been here the service has been better, the meal was messed up once but the manager saw to it and refunded, so i will continue to come here"
Brian B.,"Anaheim Hills, CA",426,698,43,1.0,10/15/2015,"Some friends and I went to your location to watch the Raiders vs. Broncos game. When we arrived all of the TVs in the restaurant were on other NFL games from all around the league. When those games had finished we asked our server if one of the TVs could please be changed to the Raiders game? The response we received was ridiculous. She stated ""We do not show Raiders games here, this is a family restaurant."" At first we thought she was joking with us, but when the Rams fan at the table next to us turned around and asked her, ""That's a joke right?"" She again stated ""We do not show Raiders games in this restaurant because this is a family restaurant."" She then went on to say that she would ask the manager, when she returned she told us they said no, and we would have to go somewhere else. At that point we sent back everything we ordered and we left. I do not understand how you can advertise that your establishment is the place to go to watch the NFL. But yet do not allow certain people to do so based on who they cheer for? We were told that Raiders games cause violence, foul language and chaos in the restaurant. So because we cheer for the Oakland Raiders we are profiled as violent, foul, and trouble makers? For this we will NEVER step foot in any one of your establishments again. Raiders fans are not all foul, violent, or problem starters, but what we are is a FAMILY, and in your managers own words this FAMILY is not welcome in your ""family"" restaurant. I wonder if we had asked to put on the Broncos game, the channel would've been changed, but we were profiled as Raiders so basically asked to leave. I wonder if this is a corporate decision or if a server, bartender, or manager is making the executive decision to exclude teams. Maybe y'all should just put up a sign, the place to watch the NFL, except the Raiders. Wait, is it just the Raiders? My wife likes the Patriots, do you side that Pats are cheaters and not show their games? What about Dodgers, again there was just another beating over the Dodgers? Riots happen after Lakers playoffs, do you not show Lakers games?  Not like I am a huge fan of your restaurants, I cannot think of a single positive experience. Maybe someone at corporate should read the reviews, or read my reviews, there are several, and I believe they all highlight negative experiences around service. And your mediocre food does not make up for horrible service.  Enough chances, I think I am over you restaurant."
