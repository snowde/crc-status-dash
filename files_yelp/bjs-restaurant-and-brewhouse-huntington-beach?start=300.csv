G M.,"Riverside, CA",1,95,5,5.0,7/30/2016,"Molly was so polite and professional, from making our reservations over the phone to helping us at the actual location. Great customer service :)"
Vivian A.,"Garden Grove, CA",2,17,13,1.0,12/28/2015,"Look I'm not one to be particular about service but having worked at disney and a restaurant I know what it's like to work at a very busy or even slow restaurant with that being said .  My boyfriend had suggested this place because he loved it and I had never been so mind you this is my first experience here and my last. we decided to stop by one day for a late lunch around 4 on a weekday and it was slow so we got seated right away and then we met the waitress . The whole time she had one of those ""I hate my job but here I am what do you want"" kind of attitudes so I just ignored it ordered my food which didn't take too long to come out it was good , but after that the waitress just completely forgot we were in the establishment didn't stop by once didn't come to see if we needed anything nothing at all it's like she had vanished . But still it was my first time so my boyfriend was completely pumped and told me I had to try the pazookie because it's everything I would love. Then a little more than half way through our meal waitress stops by doesn't say a word drops off the check and a box for our food . At this point I was upset , she was super rude didn't ask if we were done if we needed anything maybe like refills on our drinks? If we wanted dessert or anything to-go nothing .. So we paid our tab and left it completely ruined it for me I seriously don't ever want to go back because of their services . Or maybe I'll try a different location and hopefully it'll be better there ?? I'm so sad I didn't even get to try those delicious looking pazookies :("
Sabrina C.,"Huntington Beach, CA",306,107,57,2.0,12/17/2014,"I liked the food here a lot but they have recently changed their menu and taken away some of my favorites (the stir fry!!) and changed some of their recipes (garden salad is different and I don't like it as much, there are also no more boneless hot wings only ones with bone in). They still have their staples like pizza and pizzookies (yay!) but I wish they would go back to their old menu.  Service at this location is not great. It takes a long time for a server to come by your table, they do not check on you that often and the kitchen is slow. Last time we didn't have place setting and when the food got dropped off to us it took us 5 minutes to flag someone down to get some so that those of us in the party who had dishes that required silverware could eat.  Need to improve on service and please bring back your old menu!!!"
Darren W.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,21,,2.0,10/13/2016,We usually go to the downtown location and enjoy the food.  We ate here to avoid the Tuesday crowd.  It was a mistake.  The pizza arrived lukewarm and soggy.  It was also burnt on the bottom.  We would sent it back.  But it took so long to get our pizza that we didn't have time for it to be remade.
Jason M.,"Brentwood, CA",3,35,3,1.0,6/12/2015,Absolutely horrendous customer service. I'm still sitting here. HELLO...Does anybody work here...? 1st and last time at this location.
Jan T.,"San Bernardino, CA",0,10,,5.0,10/28/2016,"Just finished a wonderful dinner here! The food was yummy, but the service was OUTSTANDING! Our server's name was Preston, and he was INCREDIBLE! He gave us service that I would have expected at a 5 star restaurant! Thank you Preston, you ROCK!"
Mimi K.,"Orange County, CA",0,36,1,4.0,9/24/2016,We have come here a few times and love the flat bread and Caesar salad.  It has a great lowkey feeling and the wait staff are great.
Chuck K.,"Long Beach, CA",26,233,56,4.0,9/14/2014,"Pretty much like other BJs. Same thick crust pizza, same beers and same poozookie (sp?) cookie with ice cream dessert. It is a formula but it is a formula that works. This one is large inside and it is across Beach from the mall. It is right up next to the freeway on ramp, so figuring out how to get into the parking lot is a bit of a maze. The service was good. Sort of weird that our server always had a stack of dishes in her hand. But she still stopped by regularly to make sure we had all that we needed. To be different I had the berry cider this time instead of beer. I highly recommend it."
Lyrae T.,"Midway City, CA",16,25,7,2.0,3/19/2016,"Terrible hostesses. Standing room only, open booths and tables in bar and people just walk in and sit. I ask the hostess and she says it's open seating. How about offering that to us standing?! After waiting 20 minutes, I see a booth open in the bar area, tell the hostess to remove us from the list, turn around and the booth is taken! Tell her to keep us on the list. Wait another 15, people arriving after us being seated. Go back to hostess and she says oops I forgot to put you back on the list! Totally irritated by now. Completely ruined the vibe of a relaxing meal!"
Armando N Anna P.,"Santa Maria, CA",2,14,6,5.0,4/22/2015,"I am one of two chief executive producers of sweet pig productions, you can find us on Feb. My wife and high came here on 4/22/15. I only wish I had 2 more thumbs so I could give this place 4 thumbs up. Sarah and Suzie you girls rock!"
Cierra H.,"Costa Mesa, CA",0,11,1,1.0,9/30/2016,"Came on a Friday night, wait wasn't too bad, but service could've been a lot better. The server was nice and pleasant.  The expo/food running staff NEEDS to be trained better. If you drop a salad and someone doesn't have silverware...you should offer silverware not drop it off and walk away quickly before I can get your attention. I tried to wave multiple people down and everyone was turning away quickly when seeing me try to get their attention and the server was too busy to notice. I sat for 10 minutes with my salad in front of me before finally getting silverware. The check was the same story, check was dropped (without a check presenter) and we put our card down but it took about 8 minutes for it to be picked up."
Rob T.,"Huntington Beach, CA",54,43,22,5.0,5/19/2014,"Lunch adventure. I ordered the single topping pizza and salad. Chose bacon for the pizza and house salad with bleu cheese dressing from the lunch specials menu. The salad was tasty. The pizza was fantastic. My uncle was impressed with it, so he ordered one to go. He had the classic burger. What was unexpected was that pizookies can be half-and-half. I really like the sea salt caramel;  my uncle prefers chocolate chip. That turned out better than expected. :)"
Anna G.,"Huntington Beach, CA",10,15,,5.0,6/16/2015,"Everyone seems so against ""chains"" around here.  I really understand the desire to check out new, local, mom and pop places, and I do that all the time.  But when I just in the mood for some consistently great food, with consistently great, friendly service, nothing beats BJ's.  All of them are great, but I love this one, as it's so nice to sit by the sidewalk and watch people.   Twice now, we've made special seating requests, and both times it seemed like the staff just jumped at the chance to help us.  All their pizza is great (or at least as great as you get outside of NY or Chicago), the fish tacos are as good as anywhere, and even their more upscale dishes have always been great.  We've tried many of their in house brews, and all of them are very good.    There's really something to be said for always have a consistently good experience.  BJ's never lets me down and that's huge!"
Gaylen W.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,7,,1.0,10/15/2016,Server was on a big hurry to get off work. Gave us our bill before we got dessert so we paid then she took it & left before we got the dessert. We both ordered the beignets with strawberries. We got it and the strawberry sauce tasted like a salad dressing. We thought it was weird but we could not get anyone's attention. We just ate it anyway. Then finally got the manager and he said oh sorry I have a new salad guy. We ordered dessert not salad. I am just surprised the did not do anything since our dessert had strawberry salad dressing on it.
Nick D.,"Buena Park, CA",0,7,1,1.0,10/14/2016,"Very disappointed with this business as a whole, if I could give less than 1 star, they definitely deserve less.. So Friday night, my GF wants to go to BJ's to meet with her old work crew, I go reluctantly, as we've had poor service here before. After waiting for over an hour to be seated, we get taken to our table. Waiter asks what we'd like to drink, I order a Moscow Mule, at which point he informs me that he would have to talk to the bartender to see if they have an open ginger beer, and if they do not, then I would have to ""pay for the whole ginger beer($7.95), on top of the price of the mixed drink($10/12) that includes ginger beer!!!!!! That would be a $20 Moscow Mule!!!!!  The manager comes up and said he was told someone had a question... I never asked to speak to him, but thinking he would be a reasonable fellow and want to provide excellent customer service, he adamantly stated this was their policy. So I asked, so if I'm lucky enough to that someone else is ordering this same drink at the same time, I can have one for the normal price? But when would that be? So basically you cannot order a Mule with out paying for the whole ginger beer, so you pay for two drinks to get one. Unbelievable!!! I said I'll just save my money and ordered water. I did not order food, I will never go here or to another BJ's again. These people are trippin. Worst customer service ever."
Dawn A.,"Westminster, CA",46,33,1,2.0,9/20/2015,"This location does not monitor the curbside takeout. There were cars parked with no one inside taking up the 3 spots that were designated. After waiting in my car for 30 minutes I called to see what the hold up was as no one had come out to take my payment, my food was ready to go, not sure how long it was sitting there."
Daniella D.,"Huntington Beach, CA",1,2,,5.0,7/17/2015,"There are few restaurants that can you find that offer good service, excellent food and a inviting environment. BJs is one of those restaurants and I will definitely come back here.   I visited the restaurant one Saturday. Earlier that day I wasn't having a good day but once I went with my family I was raised out of the blue. Our waiter was a nice fellow that help us order since it was our first time there. The drinks and food arrived at a good time. Our family shared the deep dish pizza; it was cooked to perfection, the veggies tasted fresh, and it was enough for the whole family ( five people). The best part of my experience was the dessert which was a cookie kind of pizza with ice cream.   Overall it is a very good restaurant, with good service and good food. If you plan coming to BJs I recommend that you arrive early because around six the restaurant fills up."
Jazmin M.,"Costa Mesa, CA",0,12,,5.0,3/27/2017,"I'm honestly not sure why there are so many bad reviews about this place, but my boyfriend and I have come here sooooo many times and the service is ALWAYS AMAZING! We were just in two nights ago and we were that couple that come in like 30 minutes before closing and the manager and only server on were extremely nice about it. (My bf and I both work in the restaurant business and we know what's in like to get those late walk in so we were going to just get a quick bite and be in and out.) The server was awesome, checking up on us making sure we had napkins, plates, utensils, and that our drinks were filled to our liking. Usually servers will give bad service in these types of occasions because they most likely are dying to go home, but this guy was awesome, really wish I would have remembered his name. The whole process took about 25 minutes, which was great. We were out in no time and left with happy filled tummies. Thank you for a awesome late night dinner BJ's and for never failing us! :)"
Akiko I.,"Orange County, CA",1460,1443,13972,3.0,3/25/2013,"- Locale Destination -  Happy hour - $4 for beer, cocktails and $4~6 appetizers. Lots of TVs for games. Somehow they used almost all the TVs for ""Lakers"" switching the awesome game by Miami Heat. Good for Lakers fans. Don't be a hater just because Heat is awesome ! Of course, you can ask the staff to switch the channels ;p Service: Not focused and very slow. The staff do need proper trainings. They seemed nice when they actually attended the tables but rarely come back to the customers. Many of the customers at podium often wondered to get their attention despite of many staffing. I saw my server had to deal with stupid guests who couldn't figure out the prices of happy hour items. She couldn't explain the prices to the stupid and upset customers and the big manager had to step in. It took forever for food to come, for drinks to be refilled, for dirty dishes to be picked up, for customers to catch their servers... The services were very very slow despite of the fact they had plenty of staff. So I was so careless to stay there for the entire Miami Heat's game ;p - Gluttony Expedition -  Strawberry lemonade : Way too sweet. CA club flatbread: Chicken, avocado and diced tomato on the flatbread. Small but good for appetizer. Not bad for $4 - happy hour! Chocolate ice cream:  Very thick.  Mac & Cheese: Nasty.  - Conqueror's Deduction -  I don't understand why this place is so busy - for non-happy hours. Foods are so so, services are pretty slow. Why do people like the mediocre? I don't get the mediocre food nor mediocre people..."
Remie M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",864,652,525,4.0,1/3/2014,"I've always like this location.  My friend and I came here to grab a drink for new year's day celebration.  We walked in and headed straight to the bar.  There was only a few people there.  Petra was our bartender.  She was very friendly and attentive.   Cheap drinks!  As for the food, we didn't eat this time around.  But I always like there calamari, and everything else on the menu! Portions are huge, so I always end up sharing or bringing it home. You have to try their pizookie! Those are THE best!"
