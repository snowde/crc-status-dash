Stephenie G.,"Garden Grove, CA",54,75,56,3.0,11/2/2015,"My husband and I came here for Happy Hour on Friday. We were both disappointed to see that the Happy Hour menu had changed and not for the better. The old happy hour was one that kept us coming back, but now I'm not sure how often we will go to BJs. We love the beers but the food is just average."
Tiffany L.,"Costa Mesa, CA",178,68,16,5.0,9/7/2014,"Since my youngin' high school days, this is always been the place for late night appetizers and pizookies. I have not had a bad experience (at this location) ever! They are open pretty late for a restaurant... closing at 12-1 AM. I'm here a lot for their happy hour too. Food: You can't go wrong with the pizza here; both the flatbreads and the deep dish pizzas are awesome. But honestly, you can really get full and get your money's worth if you know what you are doing. They have a small-bites section for only $4-5 each dish. I don't know why but their small-bites mac and cheese is really filling! I order this for my meal + pizookie = I'm already full. Check out their fried artichoke and their small salads too! Also, utilize their happy hour! They have $4-6 dishes, and their spinach dip and buffalo wings are very good too! You can get half of a flatbread pizza for $4, which is good for the late night food cravings. As for their pizookies, if you know you aren't going to finish a whole one to yourself or your friends want different things, you can order the mini's for a cheaper prices.  Drinks: WOW, you must try their water. It's the best water I've ever had. Just kidding.. but seriously check out their beers! They have good house craft beers, especially their brand. The pale ale and the hefe are awesome. They also carry other craft beers as well and some of them are not listed on their menu. You have to be a loser like me and walk from one end of the bar to another to see which craft beers on tap they have. For example, the menu did not have Bootlegger's Palomino Pale Ale. However, in the corner of my eye, I saw the beer tap handle on one end of the bar. I saw Green Flash and Stone IPA as well. So keep your eye out for the beers that you want!  In conclusion, go after 10 PM Sunday-Thursday for eats and drinks. Keep your belly happy :)"
Andrea B.,"Costa Mesa, CA",85,18,3,1.0,8/23/2015,"My husband, I and our 2 daughter's decided to go out to dinner tonight which ended up being the WORST mistake. We arrived around 6, waited about 25 minutes to be seated, which was pretty normal for any restaurant. We were seated all the way in the back corner first of all and I immediately knew that we would be forgotten. The waitress was very nice but had a big party she was taking care of. We waited 15 mins to be greeted and put our drink and food orders in at the same time. It took another 20 mins for my husband's beer but no water. I took one look at the beer glasses and they had lipstick on them and were extremely dirty. I got up and asked for a water and New glasses. Why should I as a customer have to get up and ask for these items. We ordered potato skins, so nasty and bj's house pizza. Also, very nasty. The service was HORRIBLE and if I could give it zero stars I would. I tried to find a manager but there was not one around. My husband and I left very upset and will never be back. Yuck....pissed off customer UPDATE: We got home and both got super sick (both ends), I am sure it had something to do with their food handling and OBVIOUSLY their poor dish washing skills. $65 down the toilet, literally."
Thomas F.,"Huntington Beach, CA",85,52,12,4.0,10/17/2015,Wide range of food. Attentive staff. BJS is known for their pizza. You can get either deep dish or Flatbread style. Good place to take kids. Plenty of televisions for game day. Can get crowded but worth the wait.
Dao N.,"Garden Grove, CA",133,202,91,4.0,1/16/2014,"Usually we come in for dinner, but we had time to do lunch instead. With limited time, we just seated ourselves at the bar area.  My gf of course likes the high chairs.  We were quickly given menues and asked for drinks.  I love the fact that they have a decent selection for lunch specials.  I decided to go with the half flatbread pizza with a side salad.  It's too bad that they didn't have deep dish pizza for a lunch special.   The food was delicious, can't go wrong with pizza at this place.  The portion may have been a little small for me, but I guess for lunch it was perfect.   Overall, if you are looking for a quick lunch and want to keep it affordable.  This is the place."
G M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,408,722,5.0,2/8/2016,"This place is a chain, but they have good food, great beer, and a fun environment. The only problem is somewhat loud, and no bread served. The salmon was great, and the pizza appetizer pretty good. The Jambalaya seafood was a bit too spicy and inauthentic though."
Denise H.,"Newport Beach, CA",518,510,2,5.0,6/3/2013,"He..he...five stars for the deep dish BBQ pizza...it's just yummy! BJ's has HUGE portions, excessive amounts of calories per dish, a fast wait staff and a pretty good size menu...what's not to like I tell ya! Sometimes I sit there looking at the huge portions, the huge plates that the food is served on and the sometimes huge size of the other diners and well heck, no wonder there is an obesity epidemic in the U.S. I know anybody from Japan or any part of Europe would laugh their butts off at ""the huge American sized food"". Yep..everything bigger here in the USA and we're proud of it.  BJ's is an excellent place to get your grub on."
Diana N.,"Westminster, CA",255,367,514,4.0,7/5/2013,"My boyfriend took me here for lunch to celebrate our 5-month anniversary. Plus, he obtained an offer on Facebook that was a BOGO Free for any entree. In addition, my review may be a little biased considering the fact that this place has sentimental value for the both of us.  We waited around 15 minutes for a table (they offer pagers for you that doesn't work beyond the BJs facility, so be sure to stay nearby). I ended up ordering a PARMESAN CRUSTED CHICKEN SANDWICH w/ CRISP STRING FRIES (lunch menu) and my boyfriend ordered a LUNCH SIZE SALMON TERIYAKI over RICE PILAF (sauteed with white onions, red bell peppers, napa cabbage, green onions and sweet baby carrots, tossed with teriyaki sauce. served over white rice and topped with sesame seeds). The PARMESAN CRUSTED CHICKEN SANDWICH was cut in half by default (which I always love), and stayed crispy throughout all my bites. I was able to finish one half and my boyfriend was able to finish the other half. The amount of parmesan was perfect considering that I'm not a fond fan of overwhelming cheese flavors. The sandwich also came with what seemed like an acidic coleslaw immersed within the sandwich. As for the CRISPY STRING FRIES, they were a little bit of a disappointment. I assumed they were going to be crispy and straight considering that they had less surface area and width to be fried though, but there were a lot of fries that were limp and could have been even crispier.  As for the boyfriend's LUNCH SIZE SALMON TERIYAKI over RICE PILAF, it was a perfect amount for lunch (unless you are super starving). The only thing we both had to complain about the entree was how the rice pilaf and the salmon bits were drenched in too much teriyaki sauce. Although the salmon was cooked perfectly, all we were able to taste was the teriyaki sauce. As a result, it made the dish too salty and our mouths too thirsty. I recommend having the sauce on the side so you can pour your perfect amount of teriyaki sauce.  Other than that, we are sure to come back here because of the great beer, happy hour, and it's sentimental value to us."
Machelle P.,"Irvine, CA",119,1,,3.0,4/5/2016,"Not impressed. My napkin is dirty! They said we could sit at the bar, lots of waiter/waitresses walking around but no one making eye contact. We like coming here but service is strange. The one on Main Street has better service. There is not slot of customers for this to happen."
Brenda M.,"Long Beach, CA",3,68,291,1.0,9/26/2015,"Worst service ever. We got sat and waited 15 minutes before my husband walked up to get service.  And the service never got better. Warm salads, no utensils, no refills, couldn't ask for condiments because we don't know who our server was. Usually you go out to dinner to enjoy yourself. Not the case here. Just stay home!"
Mooki x.,"Irvine, CA",0,332,2,2.0,6/26/2016,"We decided at the last minute to go there to dinner.  I just had a long day and didn't feel like cooking.  As usual, it was a little busy.  The waitress was awful.  It took forever to come by and when she did, she didn't even ask us what we wanted to drink.  Her visits were few and far between.  Then when we finally got our food, she came and dropped off the check.  Now, I didn't want any dessert but how did she know this?  After that, we didn't even see her again other than to process the bill.  Maybe she figured we weren't worthy of decent customer service?"
Lane J.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,7,2,3.0,3/30/2016,"I never judge a place by its first visit but after 3 bad ones? Come onnnnn... First visit are server disappeared completely after we waited a good 15 min to even be greeted the manager did swing by and apologize  gave us free desert and a new server which was an awesome guy. second visit still bad visit, 3rd  bad food, app wasn't cooked all the way, took forever to get salad as in after entre, my dish wasn't even cooked all the way as in still cold in the middle. The only good thing was are server made the experience great and I couldn't even be mad. Just seems like the cooks rush with the food (I get it ticket times need to be met and it's busy) and the managers don't know how to properly schedule the right amount of servers. I feel bad for the servers being over sat causing longer wait times. I'm not sure if I'll return to this location again."
Joe I.,"Lake Forest, CA",476,374,139,4.0,11/14/2013,"Some of my friends and I like to come here after our Bible Study on Wednesday nights.  The food is pretty good and it is one of the few restaurants open at 9pm besides the Cheesecake Factory in Bella Terra.  I dinged them a star because they always make groups wait a very long time to get a table even though there are plenty of tables available.  They have two different sections of empty tables as they are a large venue.and yet they just make groups wait or eventually after a long time they will just seat us in one of the empty sections.  I don't quite understand the logic of why you would close a section to a group of customers especially regulars who are there every other week. Outside of that, they have all the usual fare for restraurants and breweries.  Their wings are pretty good.  I usually get cooked in the garlic sauce.  They also have great salads.  If you have a sweet tooth like me, there is no tastier dessert than the Pizookie.  Its a freshly baked giant cookie topped with a couple of scoops of ice cream.  They have several flavors including the original cookie flavor, chocolate, oreo, and even red velvet.  Its truely dessert nirvana - especially if you don't let the nutrition info get you down.   They also have a tasty moscato that some of my friends order religiously.  They have a wide selection of beers on tap and they even have samplers you can order."
Nikki M.,"Long Beach, CA",0,18,1,5.0,3/11/2015,"Our server Kate was awesome! She was attentive and friendly. Food and drinks were also great. We enjoyed the watermelon and feta salad, corn fritters with bacon aioli, and California club flatbread. Flatbread was big and plenty to share!  We also got the pink Cadillac margarita and prickly peach sangria. Both were deliciously sweet.  Also tried the the BJ's Peanut Butter Smores pizookie for dessert. To die for!! Must try if you go. And ask for Kate, she'll take great care of you."
Manny G.,"Santa Ana, CA",200,22,16,2.0,8/1/2014,"This is your typical corporate experience, the food is good but it doesn't make up for the service. Nobody that works here is warm or welcoming. The servers could care less about their tables. Everyone is disengaged and they make you feel as if you are a burden on them and taking up their time.  Earlier I was in and ordered a medium pizza with pepperoni and pineapple, half of it with olives added. When I received my pizza only 2 of the pieces were with out olives, so It made it difficult because I was with 3 small children, 2 of which do not like olives. . We didn't receive any napkins or roll ups/silverware until we basically gunned down our server to ask him. It's a hassle to be accommodated in the slightest of ways.  I don't know why I continue to give BJs a try, but each time it is dissatisfactory. This will be the last time I come into this establishment."
Vi V.,"Orange County, CA",281,760,3358,3.0,12/15/2014,"Review is only for the dessert! Apparently our server was not happy that our party of 4 came here just to share a pizookie trio ($10)...She didn't pay attention to us at all compared to the tables around us. She took our order, brought our waters, brought the pizookie trio, and then we never saw her again until we asked for the check. But anyway...we ordered the chocolate chip, oreo, and white chocolate macadamia nut cookies. Oreo was definitely the best one!"
Elle H.,"Los Angeles, CA",89,50,1,3.0,2/24/2015,"Starting this out by saying that I'm a New Yorker. Nothing compares to a slice of authentic NYC pizza. The sauce....the cheese....the crust! We New Yorkers don't pack our pizzas with toppings like the rest of the US does. This being said....I don't mind eating here which means that the pizza is at least decent! That or I'm slowly being corrupted by california.... So Chicago pizza is pretty much blasphemy as far as I'm concerned, but this isn't really Chicago style deep dish. It's more like really thick bland crust. The sauce and cheese are what makes this pizza acceptable to eat for me. I come at least once a month because my boyfriend is gaga over the pizookies (cookie pizza with ice cream on top). The peanut butter marshmallow one is really good though....can't go to BJ's without getting one! The drink menu is also pretty good. I've only ordered their BJ's brand beer once, and it was good but nothing worth writing home for. Their seasonal specialty drinks are really great though!  The servers are great! I like the ambiance too. As far as wait time, it always takes about 10 minutes to sit down even if it's just 2 people and parking always takes awhile. And the manager here is a bit all over the place, so don't expect anything from her."
Molly W.,"Huntington Beach, CA",37,11,5,1.0,8/4/2016,"I will never return to this BJs pizza. I came with my family for my birthday. There were 8 adults, 3 kids and one toddler. Our drinks took over 20 minutes to get, our orders didnt get taken until 45 minutes into sitting down and we kindly asked for the kids food to be brought out first which they did not do. we were there 2.5 hours. my mother in laws order was wrong, we had to get up and ask for extra utensils/napkins, and the worst part of the night? One of the bus boys picked up my birthday card from my dad on accident when cleaning the table and threw away (or took) my gift card that was inside and when I called to tell management, they blamed me."
Jade M.,"Cypress, CA",162,36,30,1.0,9/24/2015,"we do not frequent BJ's often, but we went last night after our bowling league and we were starving. We were sat immediately, and waited..and waited..and waited...Forever to even get our drink orders. Mind you plenty of people have walked by us and not one person stopped to ask if we had been helped. My boyfriend and I had a question about some stuff and finally caught the manager and asked him. I wonder if he wondered why we didn't ask our server..hmm. Finally, our server brought out our waters and then bailed again to drop off water refills to another table. He expressed how it was his 2nd day and it was so much to learn. He apologized profusely, but still has yet to take our order. About 15 minutes has gone by since we sat down and all we have are our waters. Once we finally got our order taken the waiting began again. We ordered the 2 for 25 deal, meaning we literally ordered everything at that one point to our server...never saw him again. We waited another 15 minutes and the soups we ordered never came, I stopped him as he had been walking up and down his table section and he said he'd check on our salads. We ordered soups. He came back out and said ""has my manager been by about the soup? I was just told we were out of clam chowder and they are making you a new one now."" I asked to speak to the manager, a lousy excuse for one at that. He said he was sorry gave the same story about the soups and said our pizza was up. I told him if the pizza was ready to just bring it out and we'll figure out the soups later. He said ok I'll get everything going. 5 more minutes went by. I know that doesn't seem like a lot but when you're hungry it's a lifetime. My boyfriend and I decided we would give them 60 seconds to bring out our pizza or we were gonna bail and drive thru somewhere. Our server got to the table right when the timer started and I informed him of our plan. Before time was up we got our pizza and our soups. The manager came over and all he did was offer an extra pizookie. I told him yeah yeah whatever just so we could start eating, but we didn't want it. It was just ridiculous. By the time we got the check all that was on there was pizza, but we spent almost an hour and 15 minutes there. I'll never be back. EVER.  Also, BJs management, why are you giving a guy a 10 table station on his 2nd day? That's awful, he had his ass handed to him. Poor kid. TRAIN BETTER"
Kelly M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",52,6,,5.0,3/17/2016,Always amazing food and drinks. Andrew G is an amazing server. He was so attentive and our glasses were never empty. He was so nice and interacted with us during our whole visit and best service we've ever had. His service was top notch. Thank you very much Andrew G.
