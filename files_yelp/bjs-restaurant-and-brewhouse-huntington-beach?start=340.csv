Richard A.,"Stanton, CA",9,42,82,4.0,1/20/2015,"My second visit here and better than the first about 4 years ago.  The Pizookie still highlights the dinner, burger, club sandwich and pizza. Everything was great with the exception of the Great White pizza. The Alfredo sauce thats supposed to be there gets lost in the bread and doesn't get any recognition. Overall, great place for groups and spur of the moment meals."
Aarron W.,"Orange, CA",473,526,407,3.0,9/20/2013,"Came here to catch a game with a buddy last night.  This place is ok I guess, had one of their home brew light beers which is ok, and this leads to my TIP: CATCH THE HAPPY HOUR The beers are 50%off, and the appetizers are discounted as well.  Even with the happy hour this place is just a 'chain' restaurant, nothing spectacular, and every item you ordered seems to be over 1000 calories. I would come back to watch a game only, other than I can catch the food at other places for a better eating expierience."
Tai H.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,37,2,1.0,8/31/2015,"This update is only for their rewards program.  You have to spend $75 to get a $5 discount??  That's a bad incentive offer.  Anyhow, I've been here about 4 times now and I've accumulated 23 points??   Their system is not even working right.  I'll be going back but not interested in their generous reward program."
Noemi C.,"Buena Park, CA",4,288,50,1.0,7/4/2014,"HORRIBLE AND DISGUSTING! We were a party of four on a Sunday evening, around 6pm. My party and I were only there for pizza and beer. We should have known better and gone to a mom's and pop's pizza joint, but because we were near the area...we said what the heck? We arrived and were told that it'd be a 15 minute wait, then another person stated that they could seat us. So...we didn't wait more than five minutes; which was great! Here comes the crappy part...our waitress (can't remember her name), was very kind to the rest of my party, but not me. I was the only female in our party and maybe she just decided that she could get away with giving me an attitude. I asked for a veggie pizza with gluten free crust. She stated that I couldn't order my pizza that way. I asked why, if I've never had a problem ordering the pizza that way in the past. She became visibly annoyed and responded in a very rude manner. She stated that a gluten free pizza was cheese only. I found that hard to believe and she took a deep breath and sighed. I told her that there was no reason for her to give me attitude and that I didn't appreciate the way that she was talking to me. Her attitude completely changed after I made her aware of her horrible personality and lack of dialogue.  Long story short...I ordered a veggie pizza (not gluten free), and it was bland, cold, and disgusting! I only had half of slice and sent it back. I then ordered a pan cheese pizza and that was also disgusting. Needless to say, I threw up a few times when I arrived home.  I want to believe the BJ's staff would not tamper with my food, but because I made the female waitresses aware of her horrible service; you just never know?!  We won't be returning to this location again! It's a shame because it is very close to our home, but I'll never go to ANY BJ's location for pizza and beer. BJ's is not the same anymore!"
Ana E.,"Long Beach, CA",8,93,47,4.0,12/20/2015,Crazy busy on a Friday night. We came for drinks. I probably wouldn't want to wait the hour or more if I had to. For sure don't go on a weekend if you don't want to wait for ever
Tyko N.,"Antioch, CA",24,32,2,1.0,9/15/2015,I came for curbside and their phone wasn't working took over 5 minutes to get a hold of someone. They took extraordinary long to give me my food.
Linda H.,"Buena Park, CA",0,1,,1.0,9/26/2015,"Very disappoonted in this facility. They have a call ahead list and we called ahead the morning of or event and were told we were on the list. Well Not so. When we arrived at 6, not on list. We were even told that it was ok to call ahead so early. Now being told that they only keep names on the list for an hour. More than likely will not come here again."
Lynn J.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,1,,3.0,3/5/2016,"Great service great food overall went there with my girls, but with the exception of the creepy short guy with a glass eye that looks like he's high out of his mind just kept on passing back and forth staring at us. We couldn't eat our food after that experience so we just ordered some boxes and took our food to go."
Jane W.,"Baltimore, MD",1155,635,1484,3.0,7/19/2013,"Food here is rather mediocre at best. Came here last night with a rather large group and we ordered: 1. Piranha nachos: decent, but then again it's pretty hard to mess up nachos. 2. Ahi poke: good flavor, but not enough fish for the wonton chips. 3. Calamari: calamari itself is rather flavorless and not as crispy as I want it.  4. Pizza: I really don't like the pizza here. It's rather dry and there isn't enough sauce to tie the ingredients together. Toppings are also sparse and flavorless. Made the mistake of ordering two pizzas. 5. Everyone ordered their own entrees, but I ended up ordering the Mahimahi and also sharing Jambalaya with someone. Both weren't bad, but not amazing. 6. Pizookie: can't really go wrong with this, but you will probably feel really guilty afterward. Service was good - waitress came by often to check on us/refill our water/etc."
Chase N.,"Huntington Beach, CA",1,29,32,4.0,2/6/2015,"Not horrible, but by the best. This is true for service and the food.  It seemed a little high end, but it turned out to be just another pizza chain restaurant and brewery.  I could tell the pizza was rushed into the over and out to our table, but it wasn't horrible.  Maybe I should lower my expectations."
Brandon Edward B.,"Cerritos, CA",116,23,3,3.0,1/7/2016,"I would love and actually want to give this review five stars. Don't get me wrong, this BJ's always has the best tasting food and rarely do I ever get a bad waiter/waitress, they're usually really nice and even good looking to top it off. The reason it's only three stars is the food is great and has good prices but the appetizers are the price of an entree but half the size or extremely less! Also, the reason this BJ's specifically gets three stars is because of how long it takes to get seated and get your order taken. There was once where I had to wait forty five minutes for my reservation and the entire left side of the room was empty and people who came in after me were seated first. Before that incident, I would have given it a 5-star. Still definitely my favorite BJ's, though."
Ed E.,"Fountain Valley, CA",0,2,,1.0,8/30/2015,"Do not order take out, they like to pretend they have take out service, but it is consistently some of the worst service, orders botched service poor."
Tiffany N.,"Garden Grove, CA",128,21,3,2.0,1/1/2016,Love their food. Hate their service and how long they make you wait. It's funny because I often see their workers standing around and socializing with one another while other customers try to get their attention. I work in food service so I understand the pressure but really.. Get your workers to actually maybe do what they're paid to do. Work.
Jessica V.,"Fountain Valley, CA",126,121,213,2.0,9/29/2012,Dinner for 2 on a friday night at about 9:00pm. 20 minute wait. The BAD: 1. Appetizer came out before our salads 2. Pizza came out before our salads 3. Salad orders were never brought out until we asked for it 4. Pizza came out wrong; had to wait for another one 5. Pizookie took a ridiculous amount of time to come out Our waiter said the manager would come by to talk to us; he never did.
michael n.,"Garden Grove, CA",92,39,252,4.0,12/28/2015,"The food/service quality is always great but kind of on the pricy side with food. This place is known for their pizzas, pizookie (dessert), and craft/root beers. I rarely get desserts while eating out but I can always make room for a pizookie.  The best bargain you can get is there lunch special!! I feel the menu items are greatly priced during this time. Mini deep dish pizza and salad is around $7 or 8. I can't remember all the lunch menu items. I occasionally visit during happy hour. Just check the website for the menu items for lunch.  I feel there happy hour menu isn't really a deal at all!! The only cool thing during happy hour are the craft beers. Currently, they changed happy hour special again to $2 off appetizers, beer specials, and half off mini pizza's. My favorite go to beer is the jerri burst :)"
Jessica E.,"Upland, CA",0,4,,1.0,8/25/2015,"3:30 pm, walked in, 3 girls at counter. One on the phone, which is understandable. The second on her cell phone, no acknowledgement. Third one, too interested in the second one's call. Second one gets off her phone, then her and the third girl walk towards the first girl. At this point we get nothing, no hello, nada. The third girl looks at us and looks away. What the? We walk out, still they said nothing. There was hardly any customers and no one waiting for a table. Kinda messed up when you can't even get a smile. Wow is all I gotta say."
S O.,"Irvine, CA",1,32,,2.0,7/19/2016,"Disappointing experience for a Tuesday dinner.  Wait for a table was minimal -- good.  Plates were not clean -- please check dishwashing equipment.  Fried calamari was a soggy mess -- we didn't finish this appetizer.  Fried asparagus was a good idea, but poorly executed -- overly greasy with a portion of the batter unable to stay on the spears.  Avocado egg rolls were OK, but the filling seemed a bit too mushy.  Ahi poke was very good.  Flat bread and tavern cut pizzas were good.  Service was fine.  Mini pizookie was very good.  Overall, not one of their better meals -- they can do much better.  Will be a while before we let ourselves be seduced by their pizookies."
Julian G.,"Long Beach, CA",11,52,17,5.0,10/25/2015,"You have officially earned my business back! My wife & I used the courtesy card you sent. We came in with low expectations however they were quickly exceeded. We grab a booth in the bar section that the staff was quick to clean up and our server was quick to greet us and take drink orders. Or order came out timely, cooked perfectly and was correct. I'm very happy with the changes that were made."
Jennifer D.,"Santa Ana, CA",192,110,59,5.0,9/26/2012,"My friend and I go here on 90% of our Friday date nights.  This place is great because it has something for everybody, and we never have to wait very long for a table when we get there at 9-10 pm.  The service and atmosphere are great! My favorite thing to eat here for lunch is their barbecue chicken salad (no beans).  The lunch portion is a perfect size, and you can add a bowl of soup for a couple dollars more.   For late night meals, my friend and I share the appetizer combo plate (we sub out the mozzarella sticks for whichever one of the other 4 options that we are craving that day).  They have good ""small bites"".  My cousin told me about their feta watermelon salad, which doesn't sound great...but it's delicious!  I also like their fried artichokes.  They have a vast majority of drinks to choose from, but I usually get their margaritas because I am boring. Their happy hour is great if you're in the mood for pizza.  Their mini pizzas are half off, appetizers are $2 off, and a little discount on the drinks during happy hour.  I like to get the BJs works pizza, the great white, or pepperoni and pineapple.   How can I review BJs and not talk about the amazing pizookies.  The cookies are warm, soft, gooey, and delicious.  I usually get half oreo and half white chocolate.   Overall, this place is awesome."
Lauren C.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,14,1,4.0,9/16/2015,The Pizookie will change the way you see life. It's sooooo good. The pizza is a great choice too. BJ's is a good selection for a night out with friends or family because they have a wide variety of choices to choose from.
