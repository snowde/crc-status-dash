R K.,"Huntington Beach, CA",201,425,226,4.0,5/15/2014,"I went there for lunch with a few of my coworkers.  I keep forgetting how much of a selection they have.  It's not great food, but good quality micro beer brewery food in my opinion.  All of us had something different.  I had a turkey club, while the others had a pasta dish, baked potato with chili and a chicken club.  All were very different but all have good size portions at reasonable prices. I do like their pizza when I crave deep dish.  The service is usually above average just like it was this time.  Oh yeah, even though we didn't partake in the pizookie, don't forget they have it. I've always liked this place, but I guess why I don't come back more often is because the food is good, just not memorable.  If you are with a group of people and some of those people have picky tastes, then this place might be a good place for everyone.  I think there is something for everyone here."
Kimberly M.,"Bakersfield, CA",117,107,6,1.0,4/29/2014,"This restaurant was awful. Our server was not polite, our drinks were never refilled, my food was cold, my four year old's sliders were PINK in the middle, and to top it off, our waitress TOOK MY FOOD before I was even done with it. Didn't ask if I was done or anything, just picked up my plate and walked away. Really?? Oh and for this amazing experience we paid $50 bucks.  Severely disappointed."
Enni S.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,20,3,5.0,12/13/2015,Ask for Nathan as your server. he is great. This place is always packed and cool bar. And never leave without a Pizooki
Paul T.,"Santa Ana, CA",163,211,722,2.0,5/9/2014,"I remember many years ago when BJ's was still a relatively new small chain and that I really liked the food here.  Maybe it's because the food scene has really improved over the last 5 years or my taste buds have evolved but I'm just not impressed with BJ's anymore. This was my 3rd time to a BJ's in the last year and I've been underwhelmed all 3 times.  This latest time, my niece chose BJ's for her bday dinner.  This location is pretty big and it was packed on a Thursday night. The server was cute and pleasant.   We order several small appetizer plates (calamari, fried artichokes and corn fritters with bacon aioli), a large deep dish pizza, parmesan chicken with mashed potatoes, and chicken limone with linguine.  We waited a good 20-25 minutes before any food arrived but then suddenly they brought all of the appetizers AND the pizza out at the same time.  A few minutes later, the two chicken plates arrived.  Unfortunately, the appetizers may have sat out while waiting to be delivered to our table because they were just lukewarm.  I'll usually eat anything that's deep-fried but even I wasn't that tempted by our appetizers to try more than a bit of each item.  Worse, the pizza was also only semi-hot.  The flavor of the pizza was really only just ok, especially since it wasn't piping hot.  The two chicken dishes tasted quite good but those were also not super hot.  We didn't send any food back but it was just disappointing that nothing was hot and the appetizers were quite bland.  My niece got a free mini-Pizookie topped with a scoop of ice cream.   What is all the fuss about the Pizookie??!  In my opinion, the cookie was really thin and too crusty. After leaving BJ's, I was really unsatisfied and almost hit up a food truck but I had already consumed too many unworthy calories at BJ's.  The next time someone suggests BJ's, I'm going to have to exercise my veto power!"
Aida G.,"Orange, CA",63,50,223,5.0,8/17/2014,"So I've definitely been to BJ's in the past and have experienced all the best they have to offer.. This specific experience though was amazing.. My best friend and I went in to catch the niners game and was privileged enough to be seated at the bar in Brady's section.. May I just say that BJ's definitely scored when they hired him? Not only was he polite and friendly, but he offered ideas on drinks, answered the 101 questions my friend had in regards to the difference of beers and even gave us an appetizer on the house... Amazing, amazing service!! Thanks Brady, cheers!!"
Sharon R.,"Anaheim, CA",0,4,,2.0,8/3/2015,"Four of us stopped here yesterday (Sunday) afternoon for dessert. Of course we ordered pizookie. We opted for the trio with Chocolate Chunk, Cookies & Cream and Salted Caramel. Funny, the waitress insisted that Chocolate Chunk was chocolate chip and the Cookies & Cream was Oreo. You would think they should refer to menu items by the names on the menu. But, no biggie. Of course, the pizookies were delish. I had never had the Salted Caramel before and it is my new favorite. My friend also ordered the beignet for us to share. That was truly disappointing. I've had beignets several times at different locations. They are always small bites you can eat with your fingers and they usually come with a dipping sauce. This beignet was about the size of a hamburger. It was drenched with strawberry sauce and ice cream with a few sliced berries. It was soft and doughy, like eating underbaked bread. Bleh! Lesson learned, just won't order that again.  For the most part, our service was very good. Our waitress, Susan P, was very attentive and friendly. We didn't have to wait too long for anything. Until the end. She brought the check. In less than 2 minutes, we were ready to pay. The little book was standing up, my credit card was sticking out. She walked past our table several times and never picked it up. After 20 minutes, we had to wave her down so we could pay and leave. That is one of my biggest pet peeves and will almost always result in a smaller tip."
Armen G.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,42,16,1.0,7/27/2015,This was the f...ed up BJ's I ever been . Our waiter took our order all wrong. They brought totally something else and when we told them it's wrong they said u want me to get a manager. We were there for 30 minutes we only got served ones with our drinks. Definitely won't go back.she Powledge after we paid for all.
Vivian N.,"Westminster, CA",0,1,,2.0,8/2/2015,"Coming from out-of-state, I was told by many that the ""pizookie"" (I assume that's what it is called) is something you have to get when dining at BJs. To tell you the truth, it really did not meet my high expectations. To me, it was just a cookie with ice cream. Not that special. (I got the white chocolate macadamia, btw.) The meal I ordered (Parmesan crusted chicken) was like eating lukewarm chicken with cold broccoli and mashed potatoes. Overall first experience, eh."
Mayle H.,"Huntington Beach, CA",2,6,1,1.0,12/31/2015,"So I came with my sister and my mom to be bjs and our experience here was no bueno!!!!! As soon as I got out of the car I saw duck shittttt all over the parking lot and walking up to just there was shit!! Ewww ... Service was great!!! The guy serving us was a bit busy but very nice I tipped him $18 Food came out and it was no bueno... Orderd a Cesar salad with fried chicken ..the chicken was not cooked all the way and told the server!! The salad was not good it was all covered with extra cream I didn't eat it .the server then said chicken should be right out on 5 min n I said I didn't want it ...then the bill comes n I get charged for the salad .. I laughed and didn't say anything.. Worst part was that the server said manager will be right with u and I waited and nothing .. What a great manager ,... Not cool"
Mixie G.,"Riverside, CA",1,2,,1.0,7/31/2015,"I came in with a party of 15 and had a reservation on Monday, July 27th. We had 2 servers that sat us in the back corner which was nice but that's the only part of it that was. It took almost 20 minutes to just get waters and even longer than that to get drinks from the bar. Also took us over an hour to put in a food order. Once the food got to the table, half of it was cold and they forgot 3 different meals. When we had asked for the check we were informed by the waitress that since we had a large party, we couldn't split the check. Our servers barely gave us any attention, in fact other waiters/waitresses ended up helping us. I will never come to this location again nor will I refer anyone to there. I never thought that I would leave a restaurant more hungry than when I walked in."
Jane G.,"Huntington Beach, CA",89,271,16,4.0,12/29/2015,I think this is one of their bigger locations since it's down the street from their headquarters.  I've never had a bad experience here the food is standard BJ's - good!  They also have happy hour until 7pm but get here early the bar seating fills up fast!
Anne H.,"Westminster, CA",135,12,11,5.0,1/7/2013,"We made a reservation here for 8pm for a bday party on a friday night, came at 7:45 about, they gave us a beeper to let us know when our table was ready so that was great, got seated at around 8:15, all 13 of us got to sit in this smaller, more private room w/only 2 other tables in there so that was awesome for our murder mystery dinner thing hahaha plus we were right next to the tv so i got to watch the lakers game too, even better :)  Tried many diff kinds of pizzas, best for me was probably the buffalo chicken or spicy meatballs one w/jalepenos, and deep dishes wayyy better than reg pizza! Also, if you order a large pizza, theyll let you make it half & half, as in half mediterranean, half buffalo chicken, for ex., so that was also a plus Was craving fries so they let us order seasoned steak fries or reg, we got both, conclusion: steak fries ftw For dessert, we got the pizookie party platter w/4 diff kinds of pizookies. Our rankings: 1st- raspberry w/white chocolate chips, sooo good, esp. since im a white choco fan haha 2nd- red velvet (bc its red velvet, come on) 3rd- bj's famous, its a classic chocolate chip cookie i believe 4th- triple chocolate, this was too sweet and had too much chocolate for us but it is called triple choco so that shouldve been an indicator haha Service was incredible, our waiters were awesome, esp. the one who served us first before his shift ended, our orders probably took 20 min every time we ordered some more but the waiter kept us up to date w/the food status and he was extremely enthusiastic,friendly,&helpful, he even asked us about our murder mystery dinner throughout the night hahaha Overall, we paid about $15/person after ordering 3 large sharable pizzas, 1 large deep dish pizza, 2 side orders of fries, pizookie party platter, and maybe 1 other entree and gratituity was included. Definitely looking forward to coming back & trying out more stuff in the future :)"
Candice C.,"Newport Beach, CA",1423,177,1500,1.0,8/24/2010,"The service at this locations ALWAYS BLOWS.  I always try to give restaurants second and third chances when it comes to bad ratings, but this place just disappoints me. The food is always good because it's BJ's and it's an awesome restaurant chain; however, the staff at this location is just terrible. They're rude when approached, and rude when taking orders---and this has been the case on several occasions.  I prefer to go to the location on Main Street Huntington, or even the location at The Market Place in Irvine/Tustin."
Brittany K.,"Anaheim, CA",30,7,1,5.0,2/5/2016,There pizza is really good and it fill you up and they have good price on pizza and they are really  nice there and they are very helpful of you never been there.  If you never been there you should go and try there pizza it very filling  and I will go everyday if I had the money to go everyday that how good they are there
George P.,"Fountain Valley, CA",45,31,24,5.0,8/18/2015,"When your walk in, you are greeted by the staff instantly.  The waiter that serves you is friendly and week occasionally come by to check up on you just in case you need anything, a refill, or concerns on the food. I love the pizza. It's crunchy on the end, and the dough is fresh and soft on the inner side unlike other pizza places that I'm not going to mention. The steaks are fabulous and juicy that it meets in your mouth. I love coming here, have always been coming here, and will be coming here in the future"
Calvary D.,"Westminster, CA",10,395,2,2.0,9/22/2014,Never go watch Monday Night Football here. Their promotions only applies in the bar area even though BJ app says otherwise. Service and time it takes for food to come out is ridiculously wrong. My waitress didn't know the BJ application point rewards I have and kept on rushing us to pay the bill when I am watching the game. Annoying when I asked if I could watched the game and she say no rush. You Could Stay as.long As You want.  She did not go on break or ended her shift.  No rush mean checking for the bill to closed.out like three time in like 10 minutes??? NO thanks. Taking my business elsewhere.
Diana H.,"Baldwin Park, CA",588,699,1425,4.0,5/21/2014,"May 18, 2014 Came to this BJ's for my boyfriend's pncle's surprise birthday. We sat in the front entrance and surprised the Uncle with a huge SURPRISE! Drinks and food were buffet style and already paid for by the daughter. So, eating on, we shall :D  Served:  Salad with garlic croutons along with vinagrette and ranch. 3 styles of Deep Dish pizzas...all so delicious. 2 types of pastas: creamy cheesy alfredo and marinara sauce drinks: all drinks, but NO alcohol. wah wah Great service! We even got to take the leftovers home!"
Joe T.,"Royal Oak, MI",378,201,100,1.0,4/6/2013,"*HAPPY HOUR REVIEW* Their Happy Hour runs Sunday-Thursday 10 til close. Why you change your happy hour bj's! Appetizers shrunk in size and mini pizzas cost 6 dollars now. Also, no 1 dollar off guest beers. Disappointment. BJ's Happy Hour used to be a staple of mine. Now it is no more."
Krystel R.,"Dallas, TX",109,5,,1.0,12/17/2015,"This is the 3rd time I have gone to this location and I'm flabbergasted by the service - or lack there of. All 3 times they gotten my order wrong. This time was as simple as removing onions, when she asked if she could get me another one, I had to pass because I had to return to work, but she said she would make sure my meal wasn't on my bill. When the bill came, she kept the side salad portion of the lunch special I ordered. Are you kidding me? You couldn't spare the $3 after wasting my time? Thank you for continuously leaving me feeling hungry. Much appreciated. Learned my lesson - not returning to this location."
Robert A.,"Westminster, CA",1,5,1,2.0,8/2/2016,"Been sitting here for almost an hour. Still waiting for salad. Food here is excellent, but this is worse than their usual slow service."
