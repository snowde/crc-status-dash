Tiffany N.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",207,368,59,3.0,3/12/2013,"BJ's is usually a pretty standard place, with standard food, and usually more than standard service. On service alone, this place would've gotten 5 stars and more. I had two of the best waiters ever. They were super attentive, quick, and hilarious to boot. Also, they handled us well seeing as how we had about 20 people there that day. However, the other servers that came to help here and there were not as attentive. A friend had to ask for something over 3 times before they brought it out for her. The food was off too. It seemed as though everyone's food was just a little saltier than normal. My clam chowder tasted like an entire bucket of salt was dumped into it. It made it hard to swallow. A lot of food also came out late, but it's cold temperature indicated that it was forgotten rather than prepared slowly.  I may have just come at an off day. I would love to give them another chance."
Esther A.,"Garden Grove, CA",6,128,332,4.0,4/15/2015,"I first came here with a bad experience, but I came here again. Service was a lot better. I wish that the entrance to the restaurant was better. You cant take a left on Edinger and turn right into the plaza. There is no opening on that side and it leads to the freeway.. You have to go all the way passed edinger to the next light to make the u turn or take a left to enter in the big plaza. Anyways, I had a server named Jaelene M and she was awesome. Gave us samples of beers and checked up on us multiple times. Food is good as any other BJs. Nothing too special/great or bad. I got full from the beer. I got the BJS porter and it was chocolatey but a bit watery smooth. If that makes any sense lol. It was a lighter stout and wasn't as strong. Their berry beer (I forget what it was called) tasted soda like. I took a sip of it and I didnt like it. So, for beginner beer drinkers start with that. Seating arrangement is different from the cerritos one."
Brittni M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",35,30,380,3.0,9/7/2014,Stopped by here for a Togo order before work I wanted a capresee salad then gentle man on the phone said we don't have a capresee salad I asked what kinds they had and he mentioned a mozzarella tomato salad! Perfect sounds like a capresee to me. Service was quick and friendly but there was no fork in the bag for me to eat my salad and there were also no napkins and there's was onions in the tomatoes and mozzarella sale and I'm not a big fan of tomatoes... Very little ice in the Ice tea..... Bummer I guess I'll try another spot next time....
Ryan D.,"Fountain Valley, CA",205,94,10,3.0,6/7/2013,"Came here late after a concert once and the food did not impress me. I like their pizzas usually, but I did not get it this time, so I have no clue how good or bad they are here. This review is about the burger, pasta, and avocado eggrolls. We got the avocado eggrolls as an appetizer and they are just average. The ones at cheesecake factory are much larger, have a better crust, and a better sauce. The burger does not even compare to the ones at Cheesecake Factory of Lazy Dog. Drier and does not have as much flavor. The pasta was not as good either."
Kathy L.,"Westminster, CA",234,218,995,4.0,7/19/2015,Always a good place to eat and chit chat with your friends. They have a lot of really good pasta here! But their pizzas are even better!!! They have a meat lovers pizza and that is my favorite pizza that they have. Pretty busy restaurant... My favorite part about this place is their PIZOOKIES!! It's to die for. My favorite is the the cookies and cream and white macadamia nut pizookie! Just melts in your mouth. Sweet and milky!
Cindy L.,"Cerritos, CA",497,6,,2.0,7/26/2016,"I went here for a birthday lunch with my coworkers and the experience with the waiter was very awkward. When we first arrived I informed him that we would want separate checks, which I knew to tell him in the beginning because I am a server at a chain restaurant as well. He acted annoyed and like it was going to be too complicated- we ended up only ordering 3 things and 5 waters... then when the food came he came back and asked if everything was tasting okay before we got to try it- still acceptable. But then after about 1 more minute he came back and asked to start a desert, so I awkwardly told him maybe later (knowing that my coworker told him it was my birthday). At the end of the meal he tried to give us our checks and to have a nice day so I mentioned to him ""didn't they tell you it was my birthday?"" he said ""oh yea, okay"" and started walking away- and then I asked him ""well don't I get to pick a pizookie?"" and he reluctantly started to list a few for me. I am not sure if he was just trying to rush to get us out, or what the situation was- but I felt like our waiter hated us when we were an easy table (not how I wanted to feel on my birthday). Overall WILL NOT COME BACK!!!"
Jane K.,"Fountain Valley, CA",99,72,24,4.0,8/19/2014,"Service was incredibly slow on a Tuesday night!  Not cool. Apps: avocado egg rolls are good but the ones at cheesecake factory trump all. The wings are tasty, spinach dip is good, but potato skins were dry and bland. all these are on the happy hour menu. Pizza: great white and BBQ chicken. to die for! Cider: berry burst cider and pear cider. Sweet but not over the top, has just enough alcohol to bring a smile to your face. Wanted to try the gummy bear shot on recommendation but they were out of an ingredient. The server recommended the scooby doo snack shot instead which tasted like coconut and sugar... No. Waste. And then some other margarita called lemon drop was really good too. And as always, must finish with a chocolate chip pizookie."
Tiffani L.,"Costa Mesa, CA",401,325,916,1.0,5/24/2014,"This place has horrible service. I just left just now because I've been waiting for 10 minutes after my food was served with no utensils... I usually always come here and I never had a problem with their service, but tonight was horrible. Our server was so rude. He dropped our food off knowing we didn't have napkins or utensils and quickly walked away to help out other tables. We sat there waiting for ten minutes trying to get his attention and after waiting, our food got cold. We decided to leave and informed the hostess. She was really nice and helpful and offered if we wanted to talk to the manager. We didn't want to make a huge deal out of it so we decided to just dine somewhere else."
Topher J.,"Newport Beach, CA",58,74,217,2.0,6/8/2014,"I've been here many times before and as I age and try finer cuisines I can fully appreciate the lack of customer service and quality available at this eatery.  My most recent experience, I had a reservation for 12, arrived on time, only the front lady wouldn't let us sit until more than half the people. That is reasonable, which is fine, only I explained to her that we would prefer to be seated now to start ordering our food. My family always orders ""asian style"", or a more politically correct, ""family style"", and we always share our food. So getting that head start and ordering for the whole gang would not only save our time but their time. Needless to say, they wouldn't let us do that. When I come here, I always need to bring tums. The food is sooo oily I could wring it out to lube my car parts, my lover, as well as my hair - if oiled hair were still in style of course! Either way, I always get a massive heart burn after eating here. I would rather stick to the whole foods ""serve-your-self"" bar! The atmosphere is nice though! It's loud enough to transform awkward moments into comfortable ones, and release some gas, and quiet enough to make conversation. The food we ordered could be described as followed: Pizzas - too doughy and thick, salty, not flavored very well Salads - dry meats on top, dressings are okay Ribs - dry but came off the bone easily, but very very dry  Baby burgers - decent, it's just the average baby burger Cheese sticks - didn't have cheese, was just a fried case of missing cheese"
Kathleen B.,"Fontana, CA",60,93,99,3.0,7/23/2012,"I really like BJ's.. Their deep dish pizzas are filling and nicely flavored and they have an awesome beer selection.. Lots of choices. This is a nice location and it's right across the street from Bella Terra.. So lots to do in the area. Service and parking are good, and they have a good-sized bar area with many flat screens.  My bf and I have been guilty of strolling in here 30 min before closing time, but they are still welcoming and accomodating despite the time crunch. I can also say that their wedge salads are tasty and my bf's grilled steak salad was good too. Filling and healthy at the same time. Gotta balance out the pizza right? Lol. It's also nice that they're open late. We will be coming back again! :)"
T I M O L.,"Huntington Beach, CA",40,177,187,3.0,10/22/2014,Bar area is good.  Would never sit in the dining area but had to.  Not impressed with the service last time.  Service is hit and miss.  But like the TV's and appetizers.
Patricia J.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,6,,1.0,12/20/2015,Went here last night and both food and service was not good.  Would not recommend this place. I am a local and have been here many times and it hit or miss. But after last night we will be missing this place!
Phil B.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,3,,5.0,7/20/2016,Preston was extremely courteous and polite. Got every detail for our order and checked up on us at just the right time. Really satisfied with the food and service we received.
Tyler J.,"Fountain Valley, CA",38,5,1,1.0,2/18/2014,"Signed up to Yelp just to share the terrible experience I had here.  Valentine's day. Couldn't get a babysitter, so my wife and I decided to cheat on our diets and get some to go food. Settled on BJ's - an old standby chain we've been eating at for 15 years. 6:30 - My wife calls and orders 1 pizza, 1 brochette, 2 root beers. Should be done in 20 minutes. 6:55 - I admittedly lagged a little and found that the place was so slammed for Valentine's Day, I couldn't find an open spot on their curbside service. Circled the parking lot for a while until one opened up. 7:10 - Found a spot! Called the number. Server came out, took my card, swiped it.  7:12 - Signed my copy. Tipped server $3.00. He said my food would be right out. 7:15 - Started to wait. Got on my phone and caught myself up on Pinterest (don't judge!).  7:30 - Notice that I'm watching people come and go. This isn't right. My phone started to die, so I called to check on my food order. The girl said ""Let me go check in the kitchen. I don't see it out here."" 7:32 - Phone dies. Getting angry. I couldn't leave since I already paid. Regretted leaving a tip. 7:35 - Manager comes out hands me a gift card with an unspecified amount on it. Apologizes for making me wait. Said they're putting a new pizza in for me because the first one was cold and gross. ""It should only take 5 minutes"". Mentions he'll get my Root Beers too. 7:50 - Server finally comes out with a bag of food. Half-hearted ""sorry to make you wait"" with no explanation. Mentioned he put in some cards for free Piezookies in there. (Great. I guess I'll save it for next time I decided to eat crappy...?) I was so over it by this point, I just wanted to get out of there and get home. 7:55 - I scream profanities in my car. I get on Edinger to take the freeway home. Realize they forgot my drinks!! Drive around the block to get back BJ's. 8:00 - Have to go in (Phone was dead). Tell the to-go girl that I was the guy they made wait 45 minutes outside and that they forgot my drinks. She looks startled and we both see my drinks sitting on the counter behind her. She apologizes puts them in a carrier for me, and I leave. 8:15 - I get home. My wife was starting to get really worried for me. I explain the situation to her. We roll our eyes at the gift cards. They can give us free food, but they can't give us back our evening which they nearly ruined. 8:20 - I bite into my pizza. It was totally undercooked. Soggy, doughy crust and the cheese wasn't even fully melted. I had to throw it into my oven to make it decent. All in all, an incredibly frustrating evening. I get that it was a holiday and a Friday and they were slammed, but that's still no excuse for completely forgetting about my order and then just saying ""sorry"" with no explanation. Never had a problem with BJ's before, but after that night, I'm sure I'll ever go to this BJ's location again. It seems like a lot of the negative reviews have been fairly recent. Proceed with caution."
Cody U.,"Lakewood, CA",9,20,,5.0,5/26/2015,"Just had a fantastic lunch and even better service. We ordered the spinach artichoke dip, brewhouse burger with bacon, cheese and skinny fries and a peanut butter smores pizookie. The food was SO GOOD. The bacon melts in your mouth and the artichoke dip is super cheesy. Even the fries were outstanding. What really put our lunch over the top was our server, Shirley. She was so funny, so nice, so good at her job. She was a joy to be around. Will definitely come back."
Amanda P.,"Westminster, CA",179,68,110,2.0,3/22/2014,"Between meh and A-OK, I'd give it a 2.5 but I'm rounding down. Food is ok. Yeah, just OK. not worth the price.  Service is meh. The last time we went (this past Sunday) we got our food and no utensils, napkins, sauces, and our waitress disappeared for 20 mins. We flagged down another waitress who gave us attitude for asking for stuff from her and said ""yeah. hold on."" and walked away. We waited 5 more minutes and just decided to take the sauces from another empty table and told the waitress when she finally came back.  At the end of the night, we paid $40 for a small deep dish pizza and the jalapeno burger including tip. Definitely not worth the price. You're paying for the ambiance, and frankly, there was none that night. We only saw our waitress 3 times that night. To greet us and take our order, to apologize for not bringing us utensils and sauces, and to bring us our bill. I'd say unacceptable for dining in (not at the bar area).  Unattentive waitstaff, mediocre food, overpriced.  I wish there were more places open til (and past) midnight on sunday nights so that we didn't have to resort to BJ's."
James Y.,"Santa Ana, CA",327,469,1819,4.0,3/8/2014,"Saturday lunch.  Food and service was great. Ordered Santa Fe rolls, California club flatbread and a glass of Jeremiah red. I recommend sitting at the bar if you can. Lots of televisions to watch and enjoy a good meal."
Diamond L.,"Midway City, CA",228,78,128,3.0,8/30/2014,"+1 star for the scenery, and +2 stars for the service. I've been here a couple of times;yet, the food fails to satisfy me every time. Today My table ordered pizza, bread bowl, grilled chicken pasta, and pizooki. The food took forever to come out, and our dishes were room temperature.... The pizooki was awesome though! I will only come back for the pizooki next time! I will not eat lunch/dinner here again!"
Jodie P.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,3,,1.0,1/1/2016,We went to Bj's with my family. They sat us in the way back. It was probably 90 degrees where they sat us. We asked if they could turn the air up. They said sure no problem. Our drinks came then our food. There was a manager that checked on the temp. Nothing was done. The waiters we're bringing out the food and complaining themselves on how hot it was where we were sitting. We asked to be moved because we could no longer handle the heat. The waitress said no problem I will be right back. The manager comes out again with keys and unlocks the air and tells us it should get cool in 5-10 minutes. The air finally comes on 5 minutes before we were finished eating. We spent around 400$ on food and drinks. What a waste of money. We come here all the time. This Bj's is going down hill quickly. Not to mention the time before  this one was a horrible experience.
Albert V.,"Irvine, CA",52,77,30,4.0,8/31/2014,"I usually just come here for happy hour and the service has always been friendly.  They have a good selection of beers with decent prices! Their pazookie is always bomb!! Hard to resist, seriously"
