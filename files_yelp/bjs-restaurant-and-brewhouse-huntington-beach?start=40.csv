Kevin N.,"Santa Ana, CA",5,74,74,1.0,9/8/2017,"Got two deep dish pizza and it wasn't mind blowing. I was hoping the cheese would stretch while I was getting a slice but it didn't. Customer service was pretty good and it wasn't busy at all. Overall, the toppings were a bit disappointing because they barely put toppings/tomato sauce so you will most get bread. Price for the deep dish is a bit pricey and I was hoping to get what I paid for but I really didn't. If you want to get a REAL Deep Dish Pizza, go to a Chicago pizza place in Costa Mesa (Harbor & Baker)"
Page N.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",53,54,1,2.0,10/28/2017,"Dinner with my Sweetie and our friends. This is our 2nd time here. The first time was great. This time not so much. Service was so so. My Sweetie had the ribs with a baked potato. Neither were hot. Matter of fact, the butter wouldn't melt on the baked potato. I had a burger, good taste, but it was just warm too (as were the fries). Has a bowl of tortilla soup, super salty. I know BJ's can do MUCH better than this."
Tifa D.,"Fountain Valley, CA",145,12,,1.0,11/20/2017,"It takes a lot for me to write a bad review, but my last visit at bjs was one of the worst experience. It was Friday night so I was expecting it to be busy, I put our names on the preferred wait list so getting sat was a breeze. Our waitress had a big section and seem overwhelmed. We were greated promptly for our drink and app order, wait 15-20 mins to put in our actual order. Appetizer took 30 mins to come out. We were sat close to 8pm and we didn't get our main course until 9:30. At this point we were never checked up on for drink/beer refills. We had one dish missing but luckily everyone was sharing food. After we finished everything I tried to get the servers attention but failed to do so for 10 mins. Finally I got up to wait by the kitchen door to let her know we were ready for deserts. Wait around for deserts and by 10:30 we w re finally done with everything. When the bill came I realized they charged us for a salmon we never received.  With so many choices in Huntington Beach it makes me think twice to ever come back to bjs. Took my family out to dinner and it ended up being a long and tiring process."
Natt M.,"Orange County, CA",1,43,1,1.0,7/24/2017,"Absolutely Appalled by the service at this establishment ! I came and dined with my sisters yesterday Sunday 07/23 I ordered a CA Club chicken Sandwich, to my utmost disgust I FOUND A HAIR IN MY SANDWICH !  I spoke to my waitress and she had the audacity to ask "" Are you sure its not Yours"" to which I responded "" My hair is long and straight, NOT SHORT AND CURLY""  IT WAS EVIDENT it was not my hair as it was insside the sandwich not outside or on top of the plate. She then proceeded to ask me to show her where the hair was.  It's like the waitress or management were thinking we were trying to score a free meal or something ! absolutely NOT  ! I was completely offended I even had to show her where the hair was.  I was insanely nauseous just having to stare at the hair let alone having to once again dig it up so the waitress to see ! Ew ! I was absolutely disgusted  by the treatment on behalf of the waitress as well as the hair itself and lost my appetite completely !!!!!!!  sure the waitress  brought a replacement sandwich however I barely touched it.  She never EVEN  offered at least a free dessert or to not charge the tab for a half eaten replacement sandwich. Needless to say I will NOT BE RETURNING TO THIS ESTABLISHMENT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! you HAVE LOST A LOYAL CUSTOMER"
Terry A.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,2,1,5.0,9/28/2017,"Had a co-worker's retirement luncheon today (50 people) and it was fabulous!  Delicious food, great service, everything was perfect!  Lots of compliments from the guests!  Chelsea, our server, was very attentive and quick!  Izzy, the day manager, was very helpful, and everyone I talked to or emailed with beforehand was responsive and helpful too.  Thanks again for the lunch buffet experience, we will be back!"
Jin L.,"Irvine, CA",7,26,29,2.0,8/24/2017,"Bbq bison Burger bun was soggy underwhelming presentation vegetables look wilted burger patty it self was watery all together is ugly and messy but service was good not bad.  Do not get burgers here go eureka, Grinders or Bunz"
Mike H.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,20,13,4.0,9/16/2017,"First time eating here, food and service were good, will definitely try it again soon.  Very busy place and a bit noisy but is family friendly environment."
Samantha O.,"San Diego, CA",3,97,27,4.0,8/6/2017,We had a really great experience here today! We came as a party of seven people and we were seated in a booth. It took about 15 minutes for us to be seated. Coming into the restaurant it was very visually appealing outdoors. But indoors it looks kind of small. The host was no where to be found which was kind of odd. And when he did come to the table he seemed like he didn't want to be at work.  Anyways so we got seated and the seating was nice! Our servers name was Jose and he was so nice! I really liked his customer service. He spilt the check with no problem and refilled our drinks right away! The food was good and it came at a reasonable time. Not to quick and not too long but just reasonable. I did order the ahi seared salad which was amazing!! I will be getting that again but my mother ordered the buffalo chicken salad and said her greens were wet which was not very appetizing to her. We also got a pizza which was awesome and a mini pizooki to top it off! It was delicious! I would come here again but I don't know about this location. I feel that the other locations are better.
Benicia L.,"Elk Grove, CA",60,6,1,1.0,10/8/2017,"This place really has its days, I must say. But 8/10 times, long wait, terrible staff, errors on meals constantly and over priced for low quality food. I've been here before and had a terrible experience, burnt food and no manager was ever sent to us for apology. Only reason they get 1 star is because of happy hour and sports bar ambiance."
Alexa M.,"Irvine, CA",160,19,4,3.0,11/2/2017,"I've been to BJ's a lot in the past and have gone to this location this past weekend. I'm gonna be honest though... ya I was a lil bit medicated on the 420 BUT this order really left me going ""what the f**k!?!?!?"".  So I specifically came in because I had some munchies for their nachos. This was entirely my fault because when I ordered them the server asked: ""Did you want the blah blah blah nachos??"" I zoned out and I nodded yes because all I heard was nachos and it sounded good to me. She brought them out and I was left like ?!?!?!?!??!! what to heck?! These aint no nachos!! It was flatbread with stuff placed on top of it. Please remove these off the menu I aint that bougie."
Heather G.,"La Mirada, CA",6,51,26,3.0,10/26/2017,"Service for lunch took over an hour for soup and salad . Waiter had 2 other tables and was moving at a snails speed . Finally got a glass of water after 15 mins . Soup came with no crackers then the crackers Finally came 10 minutes later , guess what they were stale . Couldn't continue to eat the chicken tortilla soup because it was salty !"
Phylisha D.,"Huntington Beach, CA",76,41,4,2.0,7/9/2017,"How can a place so close to their corporate office be so terrible? We used to frequent this spot but the last several times have been rough. Today was the nail on the coffin when we had to wait 20 minutes at a rather slow period to even meet our server. Two other parties near us were looking around as we were. I watched our server greet a table that was sat after us only because the woman complained. I then watched him go and stand at the bar chatting for another ten minutes. I went to the hostess to ask if our server would come over and he did so slowly.  My meal came out before my water (the server was back to hanging out at the bar). It was also incorrect and my husband's meal followed a few minutes later with cold french fries.  A manger came by and apologized. I asked to remake my meal. The manager did so incorrectly as well. (dang people, all I asked for was no cilantro). My husband was done with his meal by the time the manager came out with the correct order for me after a third try.  They took care of our bill but that wasn't the point. It was slow, there was no reason for 30 minutes to pass before we got our drinks and our meals to come out wrong twice other than an apathetic server and a management staff that doesn't listen."
Christine N.,"Fountain Valley, CA",910,702,1676,3.0,6/7/2017,"Dine-in experience Sunday, 6/4/17. The front desk hostess checking people in around 6pm could've been more accommodating and friendly. I told her I was checking in from the preferred wait list on the app. She looked me in the eye and said ""the wait time will be 20, no 10-15 minutes"". I said okay, then 24 minutes pass by and my parents were getting hangry so I placed an online order at 6:11 for it to be started by the time we were seated. Well, that didn't happen.  I checked in again and the same lady finally asked how many in the party and had someone take us in right after I asked. Then our server tried to explain that the order was not received by the kitchen and for next time to give my membership ID to the front upon checking in. I have not had this terrible experience with BJ'S until that evening. Note: I have previously dined in West Covina, San Bernardino, and Rancho Cucamonga locations without any problems. The evening went better as the food came out and satiated our hunger pains. We ordered boneless BBQ wings and potato skins to start and then a small pizza half great white and half 5-meats and an order of their rib eye with side salad and white cheddar mashed potatoes for the main courses. Mom loved her strawberry lemonade."
Monique T.,"Westminster, CA",464,37,33,5.0,6/30/2017,Cannot go to BJ's Restaurant without ordering a Pizookie. There's no other place I'd rather go to for a mouth watering pizookie. Cookies and creme are by far the best!
Jelanii S.,"Anaheim, CA",22,71,298,4.0,9/25/2017,I am from the east coast and had never tried pizooki (which is a cookie with ice cream on top! A pizza cookie haha!!). I got to try three different ones (the deal was to buy three small ones for $10). And loved it !
John T.,"Garden Grove, CA",287,83,93,1.0,11/21/2016,"This place is now 1 star in my opinion after receiving terrible service today. The waitress clearly was preoccupied coming to our table, because she took forever to give us our food, and check up on us. After we were done eating, it took her an estimated 15 minutes to give us our check. After noticing a mistake on the check, it took us another 15 minutes for us to get her attention for her to change the check. Frustrated with the waste of time, we spoke to the manager, who also told us it was a ""busy night"" and they had ""many things to take care of"". Needless to say we will not be coming back ever."
Kevin W.,"Garden Grove, CA",47,4,,5.0,8/24/2017,"I had previously left a very negative review, but decided to revise it after my last experience here. As a bit of a background:  The reason I had initially left my terrible review was because that time we had went, our pizza had taken an eternity to come out, and it took so long that a manager came out and told us we could have a free appetizer while we waited, so we got the breaded mozzarella sticks, which were (are) fantastic. Then we get our pizza, finish, and get the bill, and the appetizer is on the bill, so we felt cheated. We paid the bill, but left no tip because of it and left with a sour taste in our mouths. However, this time, the food came out relatively quickly (the breaded mozzarella sticks were again fantastic, and the Mediterranean deep dish is PHENOMENAL), and we decided to bring up our last experience to the waitress, and she went to get a manager so we could talk to him about it. We told him everything that happened that last time, and he apologized deeply for it, thanked us for continuing to come to BJ's, and even removed the appetizer from our bill! 5 star service this time more than made up for the experience last time, and I will definitely be coming back again.. BJ's re-gained another customer!"
Zsanelle L.,"Huntington Beach, CA",6,17,9,1.0,11/28/2017,"I'm so sad to have to give a negative review because I love the pizza here and I bring my nephew often! On Sunday night 11/26/17 at 12:45 Our server Michael made my experience very unpleasant. I could tell from the get go that he seemed to be irritated by our party of four. After he repeated back our order I asked for our pizza well done and he was visibly frustrated. I apologized for the inconvenience. I know how it can be; I'm a server too! He brought our pizza and it was not well done. He was slow at refilling drinks but no bother, I know how busy it can be. Towards the end of our meal I presented Michael a coupon for ten dollars off 35. In the past when I've done this I receive a reduced second check. I waited but didn't receive one so our party sorted out what our payments would be. When I waved Michael down I let him know how we would be paying having divided cash and card and placing them inside the envelope. I began to explain to him when he cut me off and said ""so I'll go out of my way and bring you separate checks."" He returned and said ""the coupon applied to this check since I split it."" It wasn't even my half of the check! So I politely tried to explain that I didn't want the check split but that I was trying to show which tender goes where. I said ""I'm sorry I'm not trying to be difficult"" the response I received ""well, it is difficult."" Never before have I received such terribly rude service."
Angie W.,"Fountain Valley, CA",1,32,2,3.0,10/26/2017,"Waiting 20 minutes at curbside without them answering when I call per the protocol for curbside. They must not be hearing it ring.  Also, they forgot a part of my online order. A month later...I ordered and arrived curbside, called the number for curbside to pay for my order before it was ready, waited a long time on hold (five minutes), and no one has been out to take my payment now thirteen minutes after my call.  My order was supposed to be ready nine minutes ago."
Mario S.,"Santa Ana, CA",5,105,73,5.0,7/23/2017,"I'm really enjoying my night I dropped in to eat favorite meal (BBQ pulled pork sandwich) good stuff and to take it down I'm on my third patron shot and the service cannot get any better my boy ""Ocampo"" like always giving me his usual five star service every time I stop by to eat I request his service and I recommend the same he's very professional, respectful​,and cool and I recommend the BBQ pulled pork sandwich those two combined equals=5 Stars."
