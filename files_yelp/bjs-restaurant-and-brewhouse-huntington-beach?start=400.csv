Micah G.,"Midway City, CA",52,4,3,1.0,2/28/2012,"Was in there on the 27th of February for a quick lunch with the girlfriend.  Ordered a mixed drink.  As soon as I received it, I began to stir it (as I usually do) and noticed something dark moving around under the ice.  Upon closer inspection, I found out that it was a fly trapped under ice (see uploaded photo in pictures section).  I wasn't in a state of shock or anything (definitely grossed out my girlfriend, however) and merely flagged down our waiter to report it.  Upon explaining the situation, he merely said, ""So umm, do you want another one?""  I chuckled and said, ""Sure.""  Got the new drink after waiting for some time.  Mixed it and concluded that it was fly-free.  However, there was probably not more than half a shot of liquor in the entire watered down drink.  I didn't care enough to ask for a corrected one. However, at the end of the meal, I was shocked to see that I was still actually charged for the drink.  Most restaurants would instantaneously take the drink off as an apology but not this one.  I don't mind paying for a drink but to receive two unsatisfactory drinks in a row warrants a bad review in my book.  Get your stuff together BJ's."
Pretty D.,"Fountain Valley, CA",8,19,6,3.0,3/29/2014,"I came here today for a friend's birthday party. She had made reservations under her name for 7:15. One of my other friend came in early to get the table for the reservation.  She was told there would be a long table for 7 people in the back. So, we walked to the back and there were a group of girls already sitting there. We came to the front desk to ask what happened. The front girl at the desk was kind of rude, insisting that there was a table for us already. She looked annoyed because she kept repeating the statement. We told her there were a group of people we didn't know already there. Apparently, they gave our table away.  I was baffled.  How does that happen?! We were given a beeper and told to wait for a while. A guy came by to apologize, but I was a bit annoyed something like this would happen on a special occasion of a friend's. After that, food and service was great."
Heidi A.,"Garden Grove, CA",3,7,7,5.0,9/21/2015,This is about a waitress who did an excellent job and deserves 5 stars! DARLENE (don't know her last name) who served out table of 11 teachers (worst customers during limited lunch time) with her beautiful smile from beginning to until paying separate checks (we don't get paid until end of September). She was efficient and accommodating above and beyond!! Good job! ...the food was delicious as well.
Heather G.,"Fountain Valley, CA",0,18,1,3.0,10/18/2014,"Placed a to go order: BBQ bison burger w/asparagus, chicken pesto sandwich w/ fruit, a kids grilled cheese w/ applesauce and a drink, and the mini pizookie trio. Bison burger was dry, pesto chicken was ordered without red peppers but were of course on, no kids drink, and pizookies were wrong and was missing an ice cream. Not happy. Apparently the burger wasn't dry so in fairness, I upped my rating."
Sal Katrina Emma O.,"Anaheim, CA",122,26,23,5.0,10/18/2014,"Wide variety of foods to choose from.  Great menu.  Sign up for their rewards and receive discounts and or goodies like appetizer's or deserts for free.  Try their calamari it is excellent.  Sit watching the pond with ducks and water features as you eat,"
Justin S.,"Laguna Hills, CA",0,29,9,2.0,12/19/2015,Only giving 2 stars because the food is amazing and I love the atmosphere but I don't know what is with BJ's and their horrible service! It really does ruin the night when I see my waiter 3 times the whole night and I was their for 3 hours! And one of the times was when they brought the bill! BJ's needs to improve this! But I love the food and that's why I'll go back!
Samara G.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,6,,1.0,5/18/2015,"HORRIBLE  SERVICE. Bj's used to be one of my favorite restaurants, but i don't know what has happened in the past year or so because now the service sucks. I'll admit, the food is good, but to have a server walk past your table multiple times without even looking at you to ask if you want more water or anything else is ridiculous. We sat there for 10 minutes after we were done eating our food waiting for someone to come give us the bill and bring out my birthday pizookie, but because it took so long we just ended up going to the front to the get the bill and left without getting the pizookie. These waitresses/waiters need to be trained better."
Warren G.,"Anaheim, CA",28,153,4000,3.0,2/10/2014,"This place is delicious. Great atmosphere, nice looking bar, and lots of tv's to watch the Lakers and Clippers! The entrance is very unusual. Kinda reminded me of El Torito. Tables next to the walls kinda looked like they were just put in the walk way. So yeah, the seating was awkward."
Cindy L.,"Westminster, CA",1,9,5,1.0,9/1/2012,"I love BJ's restaurant but it has failed me quite a few times. Every time I order a pizza and ask them to double the green bell peppers, there's no difference in the amount of bell peppers they put compared to the one topping of green bell peppers. I am really disappointed in them for that because my boyfriend and I are such regulars to the point where there are hostesses and waitresses that know my boyfriend by name and know our ""usual"" order. Not to mention the time when my boyfriend bought me a pizookie and it came undercooked with holes. I will add a link to show what I mean. I even circled the parts that were holes in red and circled the undercooked parts orange. I realize now that BJ's must purposely make their to-go foods sub par in comparison to the food when you eat there."
Samantha C.,"Anaheim, CA",1,20,3,1.0,6/6/2015,Connie is very inattentive and it was one of the worst experiences ever. Fuck Connie!
Sandeep S.,"Anaheim, CA",121,23,62,3.0,10/11/2015,The waiters try's too hard to sell new products that make her look good.  And they do it even if you don't really want it.
Jennifer L.,"Costa Mesa, CA",0,7,,5.0,6/11/2016,"Just celebrated my son's 8th grade graduation here with a group of 8 people. I was able to make a reservation yet, they were still understanding with time issues on an unpredictable day. We sat away from any crowds in a nice table by the window. Service was fabulous and food was good."
Sophia A.,"Orange County, CA",20,95,112,5.0,3/30/2015,"Jaelene provides awesome customer service and made our dining experience fantastic!! Great food, and tasteful too! Come for happy hour after 10pm."
Lisas N.,"Huntington Beach, CA",196,102,845,3.0,12/29/2013,"They're known for their deep dish pizzas forever. The pizza turned out soggy and could've been a lot better. Honestly, this is a local spot and I've had better deep dish pizzas before. The quality of food has definitely declined these days. The idea sounds awesome but it's not up to expectations."
Nikki C.,"Westminster, CA",51,18,,3.0,10/18/2015,"Today was our cheat day and boy did we take advantage!  One of the nicer BJ's we've been too.  Hostess was nice and welcoming.  Service was very slow.  Took us 15 minutes to get our drinks.  Food came out in fairly good time.  Dessert was out in a flash.  Over all, service was just ok, food was great!  Thanks BJ's, see ya in 3 months!"
Annchalee R.,"Huntington Beach, CA",21,39,277,4.0,7/25/2014,"I've been to BJ so many years. Their pizza is a bomb! BJ always updates their menu. They have great selections and something for everyone. I love their snacks and small bites! I've had all of them on this menu. Now, the new starter salads will be my addition of my favorite food here. BJ have great selection of crafted beer. They also have a good wine selection and great cocktail. And for dessert...Pizzookie is out of this world!!! All in all, BJ is my favorite place for me, family, friends and as a group of co workers!"
Tito M.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,17,3,5.0,5/15/2016,Came here for lunch with my wife and mother-in-law on Sunday around noon. Was seated in 2 minutes. Hostess was pleasant and took us to our seats. Zack was our waiter and since this was my mother-in-laws first time here he took the time to explain the menu to her. He was friendly and always had a smile. We ordered BJ's special pizza and potato skins. Both were great and my mother-in-law ordered skins to go she liked them so much. She had a broccoli soup bowl for her lunch and she enjoyed that as well. Portions were large so we had doggy bag to go. We will definitely be back and hope Zack will be there to serve us again.
Milissa N.,"Garden Grove, CA",125,2,,1.0,3/7/2015,"Came in to grab a late night dinner. My boyfriend and I waited 15 minutes before we were acknowledged by our server. We ordered our food and waited about 30 minutes for it. The food was alright. I ordered the grilled chicken alfredo, it was dry, barley any sauce. Then we asked for the check and a water refill. We waited for another 20 minutes. Our waiter finally dropped our check, we had to wait another 15 minutes for her to come pick it up. I'm pretty sure we spent more time waiting for everything than we did eating our dinner....."
Nan T.,"Elmhurst, IL",0,22,,5.0,6/15/2016,"At BJ's recently....Great service, everyone was super friendly and we all loved our food...Pizza is wonderful, as well as all the sandwiches, drinks and desserts!   Pizza better than our hometown of Chicago's!!!   We went twice the week we were in the area and will go again next time we are there...All 5 of us loved atmosphere, food & service."
Chad B.,"Westminster, CA",2,1,,1.0,3/29/2015,"This was the first worst dinning experience I have ever encountered. They had the slowest waiters with the worst attitudes. It took 15 minutes before someone came to our table introducing themselves and asking what it was we wanted to drink. After ordering then because we had had such a long time to look over the menu, we ordered a medium cheese pizza. After 47 minutes, it reached our table. This will be the last time I ever eat here."
