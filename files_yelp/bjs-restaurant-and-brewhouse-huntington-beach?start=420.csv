Paula L.,"Huntington Beach, CA",79,180,42,5.0,1/3/2014,"Very Polite service here!!  I love their pizza and Apps, but they truly went out of their way to make sure ewe were comfortable (I was using a cane) and that our parking ticket was validated, to explaining the menu and any substitutions we needed!  Great service is just as important as the food, and it's stellar here! If everybody was so kind and polite, it'd be a much better world. Go there, and enjoy!"
David A.,"Costa Mesa, CA",1066,585,1044,4.0,1/18/2012,"Still a good bet and a mainstay.  I am still upset that they got rid of the shrimp skewer small plate, but they still have some other good ones.  Try the thai wontons and the meata balls... If you get there during happy hour, get one of their specialty pizzas (like the BJs favorite) on a flatbread. Or build your own.  they are half off the mini prices and are the best deal around. To be continued...."
Jessica E.,"Huntington Beach, CA",4,11,,1.0,6/2/2016,"I made reservations for my roommates surprise birthday party at this location over a month ago for the patio. We went tonight and I was surprised to hear my guests tell me that the manager came out and told them to hurry up and eat bc they have another table coming at 8:15. I had my roommate come about a half an hour after the guests were there so that it was a surprise. We ordered right when we got there and I asked the waiter about what the manager had told the guests. He said don't worry about it and to enjoy our time. My mother went to the bathroom and overheard the manager talking rudely about our group and saying we had been there two hours and needed to leave. We had been super nice to our waitress and were very quick with eating and ordering. When one of the guests approached the manager about what my mother had heard, she shrugged it off and said I don't know what you're talking about. No apology, nothing. He didn't even come out to the table to say sorry or anything which we would have forgiven him if he did. Instead he stood there and gave us dirty looks and continued to talk trash about us. I know it's cliche to say but I have been a loyal customer of this location for years, as has my roommate which is why I chose the location and I've never been so offended at a place of Buisness before. Our waitress was still tipped nicely because she was very nice and caught in a bad situation, but myself and all of my guests(15) will not be eating at this location again. We were even worried that he may have done something to our food after the way we were treated. I just don't understand, I work in a well known retail location and had several waitresses in attendance and we would NEVER treat customers like that especially if they were being as nice as we were. I think this location needs some work and new management pronto."
Jared P.,"Baton Rouge, LA",121,53,21,2.0,5/5/2014,"My family and I decided to take my cousin and aunt to dinner with us and we all agreed that BJ's sounded really delicious. When we arrived we had to wait about 10 minutes which was not bad (thank God we called ahead or else the wait was an hour).  Once we sat down we agreed that pizza was the definite choice for all of us except my cousin. Our server was friendly. The problem I had with her was that she was not very organized. We asked for a pepperoni and meatball pizza but instead we received pepperoni sausage. I didn't mind because that topping is still good to me, but for the other people eating the pizza they were not too thrilled. I figured okay everyone makes mistakes, but about 10 minutes later when my cousin got her dish the order was wrong as well. My cousin asked our waitress to make sure that what she asked to be removed from the dish wouldn't be on there and the waitress said she got it. Well clearly she didn't fulfill my cousins wish. We all felt bad cause we were eating while she was waiting for her dish to be corrected.  All in all I don't think I will be returning to this location because of this experience.  I think the 3 hours we spent here shouldn't have been the case, but messing up orders and slow service will definitely cause this.  +2 stars for the food tasting good as well as the dessert.  -3 stars for our food being wrong, as well as the really slow service.  I would only recommend this location to people that wouldn't mind being here for hours."
Danielle R.,"Newport Beach, CA",68,3,9,5.0,3/4/2014,"Last night we attended the IPA beer tasting event. We were seated in a nice private room, with table clothes and even balloons. We were greeted by our friendly server and even the Asst. Manager.  We were nicely surprised to see that it was not hosted by all the beer vendors and that the Asst. Manager was actually the host. He did a great job informing us about the background history of IPA beer and then led us through all the different types of IPA beers. I never really knew much about what an ABV (alcohol by volume) and IBU (International bittering units) were and we discussed each beers level and how that affects the beer. We had a nice 4 course meal that complimented the beers. In between we were able to ask questions and talk with our neighboring tables. I would definitely sign up for this event again. We even parted with a gift of take home beer mugs.  Thanks for a great evening BJ's."
VanAnh D.,"Westminster, CA",16,2,3,5.0,4/2/2014,I love this place. I and my best friend always come here. The bartenders are so friendly and nice. I always sit at the bar and Chris or Amanda will take care of us.the reason I gave this place 5 stars because the stuffs are nice and the good always bomb.  Great place to hang out n watch sport.
Jennifer N.,"Garden Grove, CA",70,133,201,4.0,1/10/2014,"Get here for their lunch specials!! The Southern Fried Chicken is my fav and comes in a small portion perfect for lunch and your wallet. As always, their pizookie's are the best!"
Richard R.,"Buena Park, CA",0,35,11,4.0,7/5/2015,"My friend and I chose to stop by for a late night snack and was so happy with our experience. We did, however,  had the pleasure of experiencing an unruly guest. What ever the servers or managers did to try and please her just didn't make her happy. She was creating a scene, storming off, but not before she could take everything with her, yelling rudely at her family and at the servers to get her stuff, walking out on their check. I was afraid she was going to fall out of her dress with all that stomping around.  We felt so bad for the servers and manager who did everything to try to please an unpleasable guest."
Lucy Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",196,1418,6065,4.0,8/31/2011,"I came here with a group of 30+ on a weeknight for a work dinner for my bf's company, and left impressed with the ambience, service and food.  Parking was super easy in the big, free lot, starting the experience off right!  When we walked in, huge flat screen TVs above the big bar and around the place gave it a fun-feeling atmosphere.  Our group was seated in the front area, which isn't usually private but became our private area because it was the right size for all of us.  Our server was Lisa C, and throughout the evening, she was nonstop warm and friendly, got everything spot on, re-filled waters and took additional drink orders as glasses got low, and was all around AWESOME! There was a lot of food at the table, so we tried a bunch of appetizers: Spinach Artichoke Dip - creamy, cheesy, yummy with the crunchy chips that came with - a classic! Avocado Eggrolls - WAY too chipotle spicy!  Whoa, seriously - maybe I got a super spicy bite or something, and granted I am a spicy food wuss, but the creamy chipotle dressing wasn't even remotely cooled by the ripe avocado chunks.   Mozzarella Sticks - yummy with the marinara dipping sauce! Ahi Tuna Poke - served with wonton skin chips and garnished wth avocado cubes and napa cabbage, it was tasty and the presentation was pretty - but the fish was WAY salty.  It tasted like the marinade was just pure soy sauce. Dinner salads that came with our meals landed in front of us as soon as we ordered.  I chose the Caesar instead of the garden or the tomato mozzarella.  Mine was a nice sized salad, but WAY over-dressed. Our entrees came out pretty fast: Me: NY Steak - a 12 oz steak, served rare and salt-free, just as I ordered it.  It came with a ginormous baked potato, and I requested steamed green beans.  This steak definitely satisfied my meat craving, but of course I'm partial to a ribeye. Bf: Jambalaya - a big portion, with perfectly cooked shrimp, slightly spicy.  Bf liked it - and I stole a few plump shrimp! I was impressed that the menu offers gluten free pizza crust AND a gluten free pizookie (gluten free beer too, even)!  So of course, we had to try:   Gluten Free Mini Pizookie - a single fresh baked chocolate chip cookie, baked in a mini pan and topped with vanilla ice cream.  Yum!  I wouldn't have known it was gluten free if  had just dug in.  Yay! Our server Lisa was so super awesome that she even packed a few pizookies to go - with the ice cream separate, so that they wouldn't arrive home with a creamy puddle.  And when I got my ginormous baked potato to go, and requested sour cream in a little container, she didn't bat an eye, she just made sure I didn't want butter and chives too - and then she brought it right over. It's been a while since I visited a BJ's, but if Lisa is any indication of the service that this chain offers, I'll gladly be back to try that gluten free pizza cust.  I'll just ask for really easy dressing on my Caesar salad! Thank you bf's company, for our dinner at BJ's, and thank you Lisa for being so on top of your game!"
Nancy N.,"Westminster, CA",29,151,66,3.0,11/12/2013,"They need to seriously clean the menus... The pages are sticky and sometimes have food in them, gross!!  Ordered the pizookie trio: white chocolate, red velvet, and cookies and cream.  The order came out as: white chocolate, PEANUT BUTTER, and cookies and cream. Red velvet and peanut butter .. Who messes up those two orders?! They don't sound like the type of words that can get mixed up."
Kristine B.,"Anaheim, CA",10,28,4,1.0,6/29/2015,"I'm very saddened at my experience yesterday. We had a bridal shower here. They rushed us out, which seemed odd since they didn't say a time limit when booking the space. We were in a room with no circulation, it was stuffy and humid and uncomfortable. Bar service was incredibly slow and the food was really bad. It's such a shame. This place used to be a good place. Sad to report that it's lost it's sparkle!"
Jack C.,"Tustin, CA",31,21,18,3.0,3/1/2015,Good food....but sometimes service can be a little lacking.  We had a group of 6 people and when we sat down.....we waited 15 mins before the server came by to take our order.  This is after we already told the person that sat us down....that we were ready to order immediately.
Dmitriy S.,"Santa Clara, CA",293,905,2950,4.0,11/13/2011,"Believe it or not, this was only my 2nd time at a BJs, with my first time being the night of a very awkward high school junior prom. This time around, I didn't have to worry about impressing my date or being too loud. This time, it was fellow Yelp Elite Kathleen W.'s birthday, and you know we had to do it big.  We started out with a couple of beers, and I chose their signature Piranha Pale Ale. Not the best pale ale I've had, but it was pretty much perfect for the meal. It was just at the right bitterness level. Of course, we got Kathleen something stronger, which easily amplified her perky attitude.  We went with the Spinach and Artichoke Dip to share between the entire table as an appetizer, and it was quite delicious. Tons of dip to go all around, but too many chips were left over with the dip all gone. Gotta hate that... For the main dish, places like BJs, Cheesecake Factory, Olive Garden, etc tend to give you 10 pages to choose from, which ends up making you take half an hour to decide on what the hell you want to eat. Simple solution here: get the deep dish pizza. We split a large one between 3 people and it left our stomachs bulging. I recommend the BJ's Favorite and Gourmet Five Meat pizzas. Both are delicious. Props to Laura C (at least that's her name on my receipt; short haired filipino girl) for being an amazing waitress. A smile, patience and great service are rare to find these days."
Brian B.,"San Marcos, CA",73,30,10,1.0,3/15/2015,"Slow service. The server was non existent and we had no idea where she was the entire time. It appeared they had enough workers as there are 6 people standing around the bar area talking. It wasn't even that busy as it was in the middle of the day (3-4pm). The server takes forever just to get any refills, orders, or boxes. I usually don't do yelp reviews but this is time it was necessary. Considering I am waiting and have time to type a short story about her slow service."
David C.,"Huntington Beach, CA",114,89,56,2.0,8/5/2012,"The food I recommend: Ribs! Get the full rack because it's only a slight increase in the price in comparison to the half rack of ribs. You also get a starter choice of clam chowder or any soup they have that day. Don't forget to ask for their clam chowder crackers also. They usually don't bring it out unless you ask for it.   Hint: Instead of getting mash potatoes or baked potatoes as a side with your entree of ribs, you may choose to get the side as another clam chowder, that way you'll have 2 clam chowders to share with your significant other! Drinks: Beer-wise. I'd recommend getting the Sampler. You get 8 different beers for about $12. Not only do you get a variety, but it's also fun with a group of friends! You don't get too full over it.  I'm giving BJ's 2 stars because of my last experience. ""I've experienced better basically."" I had dinner there last night with my girlfriend. While we were waiting for friends to arrive the server came out with the water. As he placed each one down the very last one fell towards me and onto the floor. The glass of water broke into pieces and I could feel the water soaking up my left leg of my jean. My girlfriend, who had heels and a skirt, was in danger of being cut from the broken glass. We checked to see if any shards pierced her. Now the table was also wet along with the surrounding area of our table. The server left u there to go get a broom. While our server was gone the nearby table was talking to each other about possibly suing BJ's if that were to happen to them. On the other hand, we seemed to be OK and felt like it wasn't necessary. Well, the server came back and scooped up the glass. However, he just came back with the broom and the scooper. How was he to know where all the pieces were though? BJ's lighting is quite dim so he was merely assuming he was finding all the glass. Luckily for him I took out my cell phone and used my flashlight ap to assist him. He didn't even say, ""Thank you."" It was more like I was the worker helping another fellow employee. Unbelievable. Now the problem actually continues with the following: Our table was still wet and had ice cubes. The floor was extremely slippery and risked us from falling or any other patron for that matter. We continued to wait for our replacement water. Finally, it was brought to us. However, what happened to our utensils? Where were our napkins or towel cloth? It was never given to us and he expected us to sit there with our table all glossy--serving as a reminder, ""Oh. It's not over yet! Stay tuned for more!"" When our friends arrived we told them about what had happened. We then ordered our food and waited 40 minutes until our clam chowder arrived. Usually we'd receive it less than 10 minutes with our crackers. Well, that wasn't the case. Instead, we waited 40 minutes and only got our clam chowder while our friends looked at us eat. My girlfriend even stopped our server to ask, ""May I have crackers for my clam chowder please?"" Guess what? The crackers never came. It completely slipped the server's mind! After finishing our clam chowder our empty bowl just sat there until the very end of our dinner. Thank you very much for reducing my eating space!  Furthermore, all of our entrees finally arrived. Ah Yes. The moment of truth. Once again, my girlfriend had to remind the server, ""Can we have some towels and utensils please?"" I mean, I don't carry an extra pair of forks, knives and spoons with me. So please give us some utensils to eat. Don't tease us with our food sitting right in front with us!  Fast-forwarding to the end. We signed up for BJ's rewards program and were told by our server that tonight's dinner will be properly added to our rewards account. However, I found out this morning from checking online that the server had lied about it and only processed 1 of the orders. Thanks a lot for confirming your lie multiple times! I don't know if the guy was just being lazy our perhaps he was just downright incapable of addressing his patrons, but I'm very disappointed that not once did he offer to give us any freebie. Not once did any other worker or manager come out to address the broken glass and water all over our table and floor. Not once did the server sincerely say, ""Sorry."" Instead, it just felt like he was rushing to hide the issue before he got in trouble.  In conclusion, we did leave him a fair tip even with the horrible experience he has given the 5 of us there. My past experiences at BJ's were wonderful, but this server managed to screw up everything. I'm assuming the manager was never notified at all about what occurred. Therefore, our server probably just went to the backroom and got a broom to clean it up before anyone found out. How it should have been handled was that he should have notified his manager and requested to give us a free SOMETHING or for the manager to come out to say SORRY for the rather scary incident. But No. That didn't happen. Case closed."
Sherrill H.,"Huntington Beach, CA",100,147,47,4.0,4/7/2015,"This place has vastly improvised since inception- we are here tonight with a friend/coworker and our son.  There are few places you could do both and have a good dining experience. kudos BJ's, kudos !"
Jan H.,"Big Bear Lake, CA",75,9,,1.0,5/19/2016,"WORST NIGHTMARE EVER!!!!! made a reservation at 11:07 am for 10 for a celebratory dinner for our daughter graduating from csulb (yeah!!!!) showed up at 8 NO reservation we were told a table was just leaving please give them 20 25 mins. to set up no problem WRONG came in 15 min to make sure all was going good they didn't know what was going on. told the story to Tracie (very rude very unprofessional) was told we would have to wait another 30 to 45 mins. at that point I got upset said no you have already ruined our dinner (my husband had to leave 2 plus hour drive home so he could work in the morning) my daughters room mates parents had to leave due to long drive and both needing to work in the morning) Tracie still calling people in ignoring me standing there. she called a table of 17 that had come on after us and sat them . That's when I asked for a manager.... she continued to ignore me and another young lady who had made her reservations the Thursday before. The manager after listening to both of us finally got her to quit seating people and get our tables ready. if it hadn't of been my daughter's choice for her grad dinner we would of left. not only was the food sub par..... the service was horrible we were served other people's dinners appetizer and drinks ( would you want a drink or food that had been left on anothervtable?) the waitress did her best with very little help. we did tip her quite well it was not her fault. management will be notified and I will blast this on fb so people know what to expect. The manager was not very helpful until we mention getting should of the corporate office. we were 1 of three large parties with ""lost reservations"" so if you are planning an event i suggest you do not use BJ's very very disappointed. My husband who,worked 6 years putting our daughter through college didn't even get to enjoy our families traditional dinner. to top it off they did not offer a discount or even complimentary drinks water or? do yourself a favor find somewhere else to enjoy a family get together....."
Carrie B.,"Orange County, CA",274,86,106,1.0,4/20/2014,"I've never been disappointed by BJs until last night when I placed a pick up order for a pizookie trio. I wanted red velvet, but that has been taken off the menu. This was not the reason for this unhappy and dissatisfied review. Dessert is my FAVORITE part of dining out, and last night I was craving for a pizookie. When I brought home the sweet trio of goodness, I found that the peanut butter pizookie was pretty much torched and inedible! I couldn't believe that the kitchen/ server allowed this to be taken home by a  customer."
Kyle F.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,2,,1.0,9/19/2015,I loved this bjs before I waited 10 minutes to be seated and then waited 20 minutes before leaving because nobody came to our table. I understand I went at a busy time but it is inexcusable to sit for 20 minutes while 5 different members of the wait staff walked by multiple times without saying anything to us.
Sean L.,"Cypress, CA",25,49,31,4.0,5/4/2015,"wow - lots of bad reviews in yelp for BJS...yikes.  and the managers just post the same copy/paste response every time.  I have had good experiences here but will be watching things now based on all of the bad reviews.  if things go downhill, I am out......headed to Cheesecake Factory or Buff wild Wings right across the street."
