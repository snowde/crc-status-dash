Shawn H.,"Huntington Beach, CA",74,204,82,1.0,6/11/2015,"We're here right now. Asked about the garlic bread and marinara that used to be on the menu. No longer on the menu, but they will always make it. Asked for it and our waiter said Mike the manager said no. They have garlic bread and spaghetti marinara on the kids menu, so they can totally make it... Very bad customer service. Very bad."
Huynh T.,"Newport Beach, CA",0,40,19,5.0,12/30/2014,Happy Hour is the bomb! Good lively environment. Awesome waitresses. Good food and friendly people. We have been here many times and will continue ongoing.
Gunnar R.,"Tustin, CA",42,8,1,4.0,9/13/2014,"I ordered the mini classic combo pizza while my girlfriend got the fish and chips. She always asks if its battered and fried to order as she's quite picky about it. Both orders were quite good and she was happy with her fish. Oh, and the hostess had a cute butt."
Mike H.,"Cypress, CA",37,94,68,5.0,6/9/2014,Came here for lunch with my dad. Service has always been good here. Ordered a glass of my favorite brew and bake potato with grilled chicken. Delicious.
BOOYAA P.,"Garden Grove, CA",227,321,347,5.0,4/27/2014,"After may last visit I have to say that our sever Elizabeth totally made me a fan of BJ's again. Service was exclent, my beer was never empty and all the orders came out perfect with the exception of my house salad that I never got but in the end that just does not matter,"
Nam B.,"Garden Grove, CA",3829,841,173,2.0,3/6/2014,"I've been here a bunch of times with so many different people and about half of the visits the services has been bad - like messing up orders, bringing out appetizers after the main course, forgetting utensils & stuff, adding bogus items on the bill, and taking away food without asking before it's even done. Don't know if they're too busy or what, but they just suck. Eating at the bar seems to have the friendlier and better staff. Food is alright, but if you are looking for a brewery/restaurant/pizza place, Oggi's is much better."
Kaylee T.,"Garden Grove, CA",4,37,14,1.0,8/20/2013,"last time, our server took my boyfriend's beer when he was only half done, and only said ""Oh oops"" when we said something. I'm in the food/sales industry; it should've been comped or replaced. no big deal. THIS TIME - worst service we've ever experienced. McDonald's is better. after 10 minutes of sitting we were finally greeted by Nick, a cocktail server that didn't know what goes into their specialty drinks. we immediately gave him our whole order... 10 minutes later we got water. (20 minutes with nothing to drink in the bar?) another 15 minutes for my mojito to come out, with half the ice melted. I didn't bother sending it back because right then, our food came out,  wrong.....the chicken on the caesar was burned yet ice cold....and my potatoes were cold and the plate was missing things. cocktail server came over after I stopped him, and told me that's how I ordered it. then he brought over new mashed potatoes....then the expo brought onion straws....then the manager brought onion straws....then our server brought onion straws. This establishment place is so inefficient. We walked in with orders ready, and it took 1 hr 45 minutes to get out the door. If you notice this trend with your evening, get up and dine elsewhere. this absolutely ruined our night. The manager and his 3 employees standing idle at the host desk could've helped out this poor kid in the weeds. Corporate should perform evaluations on all of their employees, management included."
Julie N.,"Huntington Beach, CA",56,251,191,4.0,4/28/2012,"BJ's is a regular favorite of mine and my BFF... we live 2 hours apart, so we meet at the BJ's in Moreno Valley.  I'm also a regular at the Huntington Beach location, near my home.  They have a nice large menu, but since we love appetizers and finger foods... we always select a few of these and enjoy catch up conversation...   Our all time favorite is the Flat Bread Pizza with Fresh Basil, Cheese,  Roma Tomatoes, and sausage (just a little sausage, not too heavy) and we usually also choose the Avocado Egg Rolls or Thai Shrimp Wraps, which allows us to save room to share their famous pizookie sampler  for dessert.   We have also tried the apple cobbler (good) and the strawberry beignet (nothing special, rather disappointing). They also have a great clam chowder in a bread bowl and wedge salad.  My hub and son always get their famous pizza... thick and crusty.  Looks delish, but too heavy for my appetite."
Aliza F.,"San Ysidro, CA",0,12,,5.0,9/2/2015,Love the nutty brunette. On draft. And the avocado rolls and the brisket bacon burger. I love the 4 course dinners they offer.
Casandra B.,"Westminster, CA",1,9,2,5.0,6/27/2014,"Came to this BJs for the first time today after work. Caught the tail end of happy hour and we were able to fit in two drinks each. Our waitress was very nice and made sure we had everything we needed. Good food, good atmosphere. Hard to find in this area of town.  What surprised me the most was being seated instantly after walking in. 2 people on a Friday night at 6pm, that made us very happy.  We will be back again soon!"
Rosa S.,"Westminster, CA",669,210,1065,4.0,6/12/2011,"My friend and I came here because we just wanted a small appetizer and a drink since we were still kind of full from our last meal. But I think we overdid it and ate  a full meal again. We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip with tortilla chips. The dip was good. Cheesy and rich. The tortilla chips came in 3 different colors. Of course I ate the black and red chips and left the yellow ones for my friend lol. As we got to the chips on the bottom of the bowl, the chips just got really salty. I literally had to shake of every chip before eating it.  For our beers, We drank the nutty brunette beer. Pretty good beer, imo. It basically like a new castle but more bitter and darker. ( which means more alcohol and calories :D ) A whole pitcher gives us 4 1/2 pints. It has kind of like a sweet coffee taste to it. At first, I wasnt use to the taste of it because I'm so use to heineken, corona, and basically light beers. But after 2 cups, I actually prefer dark beer now since it gets me buzz quicker. For our dessert, we had the red velvet pizookie. I kind of had to beg my friend to get this for me because I am a big fan of red velvet ( i'm kind of sick of it now, but trying it as a pizookie is something I have to do! ) O M G soo freaking good. It was red velvet pizookie with white chocolate chips and vanilla ice cream on top *drrooolllsss* well it was kind of too sweet, but I love sweets so I didnt mind it. My friend and I devoured it within minutes. Best pizookie they ever invented! I would come back for their dark beer and red velvet pizookie yom yom yom!!"
Carolyn C.,"Garden Grove, CA",545,659,418,4.0,4/24/2012,pizza / beer/ jambalaya/ hamburgers/wings..yadda yadda EVERYTHING is good here...besides the wait theres nothing to complain about... BUT the reason why im writing a review after over 10yrs of eatting at BJs..? their gluten free menu!  this is the first place ive visited after going on my gluten free diet where I didnt feel like crap after & there pizza was delicious!   the gluten pizza is pricey to start with just cheese and it gets even pricer as each topping costs extra for us -_- I usually get artichoke/bacon/mushroom/pineapple and my 10in pizza becomes over $15..bummer but its worth it. I also had their baked potato ...just remember to remove alfredo sauce and any bleu cheese ifnecessary!  ive been here 4x and never been contaminated!! hoooray!
Jodie M.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,50,46,4.0,7/21/2015,"I like their happy hour!  They usually have a good chardonnay for a great price!  Food good, but can be loud..."
Bobbi G.,"Plainville, CT",0,26,28,5.0,7/20/2015,"Loved this place, so many meal options to chose from and the ambience was fabulous! I was there just before happy hour, we had appetizers and dinner, prices were good, the restaurant was starting to fill up with locals.  Great choice!"
Sansan B.,"Whittier, CA",8,34,7,1.0,1/18/2016,"If I could give this place zero stars I certainly would. Came in to get a late lunch. The hostess couldn't show us anymore how badly she didn't want to be there, appreciate her job, or the customer who just walked in. I asked for a table and was pointed to the bar area. The hostess couldn't even walk us to the dirty table she pointed to or even hand over a menu. We sat waiting for the server to come over and that never happen. So we sat observing the employees. The hostess chatting with two co-workers. Three other servers outside bar area. Austin was too busy texting to see us sitting without even a menu. I asked him if he would be our server and he said no. ""How dare I interrupt him texting!"" We walked out. Went across the street to CPK and the service was night and day. Had a great meal, awesome drinks, fantastic server...& hand down the best service. As for BJ's goes... This is not a good representation of the restaurant. You can get better service at our local Brea location. The Manager Mike needs to either fix this place or BJ's needs to get a better Manager. I would never run a business like this. You certainly can tell that their is zero leadership is in this restaurant and it starts from the top. I am not the only customer that has left horrible reviews. Stay away from this BJ's! You have lazy dog, CPK and Cheesecake Factory all of which have great service & good food!"
Valkerie M.,"Long Beach, CA",0,1,,1.0,8/8/2015,"Worst bjs I have ever been to these people clearly don't know what ""well done"" mean instead they bring  me a burger that doesn't even look cooked....it didn't even look medium rare in opinion it looked raw....I was super disappointed because bjs is one of my favorite restaurants but clearly I just picked the wrong one to go to."
Jeff R.,"Garden Grove, CA",117,155,101,1.0,11/6/2013,"So disappointed!  I got there around 11:30am before most of the rush came in. The hostess behind the desk was stacking people in the front area and not seating anyone! Not a single person! I would say at least 5 - 7 groups were waiting. My mom walked over to the desk and asked why is no one being seated? The hostess replied because we are waiting for a server to show up. Ummm NOT OUR PROBLEM! Finally a server showed up and went to clock in. Of course this new server had to talked to her friends before actually clocking in. Everyone waiting was just watching her knowing that we were all waiting for her! Finally, most of us were sat in her section which of course made our food coe out slower becuase 7 orders went in at once. I used to work in the restraunt business. When you get a rush, you open more sections and ask the servers to cover until the server for that specific section shows up.  I will say that once our server did show up, she was really nice and fast."
J N.,"Fountain Valley, CA",0,3,,1.0,3/22/2016,We went there for late lunch on a Tuesday and the service was slow. The portion was a lot less than other BJ's location. The waitress never brought out the lemon for my water. Better service and quality at the Tustin Market!
ChrisandLulu U.,"Westminster, CA",24,34,,3.0,3/6/2016,"Hm, used to eat here quite a bit a few years ago. Returned with my nieces for lunch. Service was perfect. We were seated right away, even though it was noon. Austin! was our waiter and he was pretty attentive. Gotta admit, though the food wasn't much above mediocre. Started with the appetizer combo. For $18.50 it should've been more than frozen mozzarella sticks and deep fried hot avocado egg rolls... ugh, nothing else in that egg roll, but hot avocado.There was a pizza & soup or salad special, so a couple of us got that. Salad was okay, just a regular garden salad. Tortilla soup was very good. Pizza was... not what I'd expected. 1 topping, pepperoni. It was personal sized, but I still expected more than 3 pepperonis. Also, part of the dough was raw. I ended up picking it apart to look for good pieces. One of my nieces just ordered water as her drink. She said it tasted like tap water. Considering how much we were spending, I think we should've gotten at least filtered water. The Pizookies were pretty amazing, especially the new cinnamon monkey bread one. But all in all, I was mostly disappointed at a dissatisfying and expensive meal."
Alex P.,"Atlanta, GA",429,834,1720,3.0,1/18/2014,Just a mediocre place with a menu composed of anything you can think of. The service was great and all the servers seem to live up to the happy and friendly culture within the restaurant chain. The food wasn't bad.
