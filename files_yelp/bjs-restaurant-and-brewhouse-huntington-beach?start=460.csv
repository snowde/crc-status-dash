James S.,"Fountain Valley, CA",33,74,16,3.0,3/1/2015,Food was good. Service was garbage. Took a long time to get our food. Then they brought out each plate separately so I had to wait for them to bring my wife's food so I could start eating. Some of the worse service I've had.
Helen G.,"Downey, CA",0,1,,5.0,4/13/2016,Erika served us at lunch and it was such a delight. We had great coversation and really enjoyed our time. Will defintely come back to bjs and will ask for Erika time and time again!
Steven M.,"Dana Point, CA",3,60,,1.0,5/5/2015,"I wrote again just to see if they would reply, and they didn't. I just guess it shows their total lack of regard for once loyal customers!"
Lorena C.,"Pasadena, Los Angeles, CA",77,18,1,2.0,7/9/2015,I guess today was training day at BJS because our server tonight had three people following him around all evening. Even with three servers.. we had to ask twice for ranch and 20min later it finally arrived. I was really looking to a pizookie but by the time someone came to ask of we needed anything I was already full and over it.. and to top it off they took their time to bring my check after I asked for it. Very bad dining experience.
Angel G.,"Tustin, CA",13,70,74,3.0,3/1/2012,Came here for a bday dinner. It was ok. The service was great but the food was ahhh. I orders the balsamic chicken it was really burnt. This chicken was on top of the salad and it was all soggy. I been here before and had steak that was really good. But this time I believe they may have had a new chef. Needs a little work on cooking the food not burning it and how quick they bring it out. Probably won't return.
Emily S.,"Los Alamitos, CA",1,11,1,4.0,7/7/2014,"Their pizzas are delicious! For the most part, their service is great, too. My boyfriend and I recently purchased a pazookie to take with us to the beach. A warm, chocolate-y treat with a sunset was the perfect evening date. However, when we parked the car and peeled open our pazookie we were horrified! Baked inside were several stringy black hairs. It was especially disgusting because we had already taken several bites. :( We knew the hairs could not be ours because they did not match the color and texture. Our romantic date dessert was totally ruined! We immediately looked up online to see if they had a customer service number...they don't! Which is very strange. They do have an e-mail option, but we prefer to speak to an actual person. So we decided to wait until we went again (we previously went very often) to report the situation. We went last night had a nice server. After we paid for our meal, we finally worked up the nerve to ask for the manager (pretty shy, lol) The manager came out immediately. He was friendly, responsive and seemed like he really wanted to make sure we had a good experience. Totally loved him. After we explained what had happened he thanked us for returning, and offered not just me and my boyfriend but our other two friends coupons for pazookies. There was a catch, however. You have to purchase an entree in order to get one    -_- kind of a disappointment, as we usually just go to grab dessert lol. But overall I will be returning, and have not had any other problems at this location. There was a name on the back of the coupon that said Tom, so if that's the manager, special shout out to him for really taking the care to make sure we were happy. He has a true gift for customer service. I had kept the receipt in my wallet to show them, but he didn't even ask to see it, which I thought was really amazing. Their Santa Fe Spring Rolls are a great appetizer, we love their balsamic glazed chicken...and of course their pazookies! Still love this place, despite the Hair Incident."
Kat S.,"Torrance, CA",1900,743,771,5.0,3/12/2013,Love their reduced calorie menu. I'm talking good stuff. I had the blt flatbread with salad and was left quite satisfied. Weight watcher people come here!
Melinda H.,"Westminster, CA",373,22,,2.0,8/20/2013,"I remember when this place used to be the place to go back in HS.  I just recently went and the place was completely empty. However, my server came to my table maybe 3 times? First, to take my order. Next, to give me the check. Third, to give back our check and tell us how glad he was that we came in. Of course, sucking up to get a better tip. Never came by our table once to ask if my friend and I needed anything. Wasn't even the one that dropped our food off! Didn't care about our experience/needs whatsoever.  BJ's standards have definitely gone down."
Lexy N.,"Huntington Beach, CA",3,16,9,1.0,2/17/2015,I did catering and they didn't know where my order was when I called. Then they transferred me to a manager. The manager also didn't know where my order was. So he left a note for the morning manager to call me. Which he didn't so I had to call them to follow up. I wanted to pay using their mobile pay. They never sent it. Then when they did and I payed it. Then the next day they showed up at my work. Asking me for my credit card number. And bothering me at work instead of just letting me come to them. I never felt so harassed in my life.  Never going back or ordering from this bjs. The customer service was horrible especially from the manager. He took no responsibility for what happened. He doesn't do well follow up. The way he talks to you using unnecessary smart comments to make u more upset.
Kenna I.,"Redding, CA",107,13,4,3.0,5/21/2014,The atmosphere was great and so was the service. I ordered the this shrimp lettuce wraps for an appetizer. They are usually great in SAC but these were falling apart and very little shrimp. I was craving pizza so I ordered the chicken bacon ranch on gluten free crust. The crust was great but the rest of the pizza...not so great. I think it had been sitting a while and there was no flavor. I was very bummed!  I will try it again next time I'm in sacramento since I've had better luck there!
C J.,"Walla Walla, WA",1,57,1,1.0,2/1/2014,"Wow, really???  We came in for lunch on 2/1/14 with a party of 4 and one child. We arrived around noon, and the place was empty except for about 2 other tables. The hostess tried to seat us at a table, which was too small for us.  We asked for a booth and she had to ASK permission to seat us in a booth.  She returned and moved us to a larger booth. We ordered beverages and our food and we received 3 drinks and the fourth was MIA. I think they had to go pick the coffee beans and grind them!!  We waited FOREVER for our food to be delivered.  By the time it arrived, the restaurant was full. I think our order sat in the kitchen the entire time while everyone else who arrived AFTER us placed their orders and received their food.  By the time we received our food, the three burgers were ice cold and the fries were barely warm. The fourth order, a sandwich, was room temperature.  We had to flag down our waitress to send our food back. SECOND TIME AROUND:  We waited and when two of he plates were delivered, they were lukewarm, again!  One of the burger plates came out and was ice cold and was immediately sent back.  One of the managers came over to apologize and give us the explanation that the burger was cold because the lettuce and tomato were ice cold, so that somehow prevented the patty from being hot....unbelievable!!  The food was still not hot, but we gave up, as we were not willing to wait any longer to eat.  The manager offered desserts to compensate for the poor experience, but we think that at least half the bill should have been comped.  By the time we got out of there, we had wasted 2 HOURS!!! WE DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS RESTAURANT t!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Cottage I.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,37,,4.0,4/6/2015,"I had the bacon cheeseburger, my partner had a salad.  Both were tasty and portions ample.  Pricing reflected very good value. Service was prompt  and friendly."
John P.,"San Marcos, CA",0,36,,4.0,9/10/2013,"I think it is because this location is near the HQ, but this place has not let me down for good food, and good drinks. This is not a fine dining restaurant so lets keep it in context, if you come in expecting gourmet, your in the wrong location.  I have been in many times but this review is about last Saturday evening. It was PACKED!! Oh my, we came in and were told 45 minute wait. We knew it was going to be busy so we expected the wait. However we come often enough to know, wait around the bar for a booth or a seat at the bar. We did and were seated in about five minutes. Yea that just happened.  A few beers, a good meal later and desert we were happy.  Staff is always friendly and helpful, thanks for the custom menu items.  As a tip, sit in the bar, service in my experience is always good."
Laura M.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,4,,4.0,4/5/2016,"Best appetizers around.  Wait was long, but it was a Thursday night.  BBQ chicken salad is one of the fav's, and the new cinnamon pizooki was a hit for the whole table.  Service I found to be upbeat even tho it was sooo crowded and they were getting some pressure from people having to wait!"
Maite H.,"Huntington Beach, CA",606,470,2336,3.0,12/21/2010,"After my pleasant experience at the BJ's in Irvine, I went to the Huntington Beach location for lunch the other day with my family.  It's been a few years since I've been to the restaurant and I noticed the nice remodeling. We were seated immediately and ordered the following:  (1)  Tuscan Chicken Limone - $11.95  2 Chicken breasts sauteed with garlic, artichoke hearts, sun-dried tomatoes, spinach in a lemon butter sauce. Served over angel hair pasta with 2 pcs of garlic bread. My lunch entree was delicious. 3.5 Stars  (2)  Mini 1 Topping Pizza & Salad - $6.25  Hubby was served a good sized salad and a tasty pizza.  (3) Lunch Size Pasta and Soup or Salad - $11.95  You can select any pasta dish (except Jambalaya) and order soup or salad for $1 less than the menu price of the pasta.  Son ordered the chicken fettuccine & minestrone soup. He really liked the soup. He said the pasta was just ""ok"". The chicken was grilled and placed on top of the pasta without any sauce.  (4)  Re-fillable Diet Sodas - $2.55 Each My lunch at BJ's was enjoyable. The food was tasty and we received great service. We'll be back because my son wants to try the pozookies and I want to try the beers.  3.5 Stars"
K.Marie V.,"Fullerton, CA",221,94,27,2.0,12/18/2013,"Two stsrs hecause of all the young inexperienced hires.  I Went to lunch here with my family.   I called ahead for seating, got there they told me to wait 13min since my reservation was for 6 changed to 4.   waited. Same girl confirms i have 6.  I told her 4 and a high chair 4 times.. they still gave us 5 adult menus and wanted to seat us in an area where in a squished area which had zero space for a highchair. Zero space for even walking room. I refused tye table so they made us wait oonger for a suitable table.  The server was ok. Apologetic.  I feltnsorry for him because hosts conduct the fpow of the restaurant.  And are the first face customers see walking un the door. So when it starts off nad..sometimes the meal doesnt event matter."
Albert W.,"Orange, CA",701,1823,60,3.0,6/1/2013,Service was pretty bad.    Not enough silverware and plates.   Servers did not come by.   Pizza was undercooked.   Still....  you know what you're getting and they can hold a lot of people.
Jamie D.,"Garden Grove, CA",185,284,169,4.0,11/15/2013,"If you don't have reservations on certain days, the wait can get pretty long since it fills up pretty quickly when there's a popular sports game on. Their pizookie never disappoints. Who could complain about a huge cookie fresh out of the oven topped with ice cream?! They have a choice of appetizers that don't disappoint either. I especially enjoy getting their Chicken Lettuce Wraps! It's the best I've ever tried anywhere! Yum! The flavors are on point. Their giant stuffed potatoes and BBQ chicken pizza are prepared well.  If you want something to drink other than a beer, they have plenty of great cocktail options. Though they no longer have it on their menu, the peach mojito is a must try if you like something fruity and not overpowering. Warning: their mixed drinks will cost you an arm and a leg! Service is always great!"
Courtney H.,"Westminster, CA",165,133,100,2.0,12/4/2014,"So I personally love BJs for the most part. They have a great selection of beer and food which is always a good thing. I walked in requested a table for two and was seated immediately, which was great. Now to the part that didn't go so well. As we followed the hostess toward the back of the restaurant and around a corner the first thing I see is a large party of about 20 people parents and children included. Granted I'm not expecting to have the most quiet dinner however I most definitely do not want to sit next to a bunch of screaming kids who are running around. If that was the case I would've opted for chuck e cheese! We sit down and I noticed a little black bug on the table our waiter taking our drink orders was completely oblivious! I mean really? Come on now. I ordered Hefeweizen which is my favorite and a burger. Pretty much I give two stars for the beer && food."
Christina N.,"Orange County, CA",166,66,16,5.0,1/11/2014,"The pizookie here never fails, get the traditional chocolate chip with vanilla bean ice cream."
