Sabrina D.,"Garden Grove, CA",77,35,27,5.0,11/27/2013,"my boyfriend and I finally tried this place out after not being able to decide where to go for dinner, we chose this place because the one thing I really wanted to try was the pizookie. I was kind of hungry but my bf wasnt so we decided to just share a dish then get the pizokie, oh boy was that a great idea! we ordered the grilled chicken pasta, it was yummy and the dish was pretty big. we weren't able to finish it even though we shared. then the pizookie came out, OMG....  it was soo good... seriously, u guys HAVE TO GIVE IT A TRY! I have friends who told me they only come to eat the pizookie! & now I understand why! our waitress was super nice! well definitely be back for more!"
Allison H.,"Huntington Beach, CA",11,74,47,2.0,12/22/2013,"Hair in my pasta during lunch a couple weeks ago. It happens...but it shouldn't. I had taken one bite after swirling the angel hair around when I saw it. I hate that awkward moment when you point out the hair to the waitress and you're both just staring at it, horrified. It happened here. She was supposed to send the manager out while the chef whipped up another plate, but no one ever came by. My friend was nearly done with her pasta by the time mine came, so she had to wait for me to finish. I was pretty dissatisfied with the whole experience. The food is mediocre -- it's a chain restaurant, so I knew what I was getting into there -- but I was pretty grossed our by the hair and annoyed that it took so long to get a fresh plate."
J A.,"Orange County, CA",191,336,32,4.0,12/27/2012,**I am only rating on behalf of the Pizookie** My cousins & I went in just for the Trio Pizookie(Take-Out). THEY ARE DELSIH!!! We ate it as dessert. I can't wait to try other things from BJ's.
Josh H.,"Costa Mesa, CA",0,7,,1.0,3/13/2016,"Checked in on the app after calling and told that checking in on the app is the same as checking in with the hostess. We get there and they said we had not checked in and that it would be a 30 minute wait which turned into a 45 minute wait. By the time they called us, they tried seating a party of 6 at a table meant for 4. When stating it would not work, they said we would be out back on the waiting list and would have to wait for a big enough table. Service took forever and the waitress seemed not to care about the inconvenience. Don't waste your time or your money on over priced mediocre food and under parr service."
Lauren V.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,22,,1.0,10/5/2014,"Wow this was one of the worst experiences at a restaurant my family and I have had in a long time. We came to eat here last night for my nephew's b-day with a party of 13. This will be long so bare with me.. I'll start with our server: As soon as my sister asked her if we could have the dreaded separate checks, we detected attitude and much irritation.  She took our drink orders and then unbelievably asked us, ""can you find out what they want to drink over there?"" referring to the teens sitting at the end of our long table. Yeah maybe it had been a long night for her but really? You can't walk over there and ask yourself?? Like isn't that part of your job? Then when asked what kind of dressings they had for the salads, she replied ""just the normal dressings"".  Hmm normal dressings.. as opposed to abnormal dressings?  So we were done ordering, or so we thought, and then she asked my sister with a hefty dose of attitude: ""So wait I'm not really sure whats going on here, like, is your son sharing the pizza with you or is he ordering something or what?"" My sister replied that she already ordered his plate. It was just a wierd question, what does it matter if he was sharing the pizza or not, that's not the way a server should ask a question! At that point we felt uncomfortable and annoyed ourselves and we hadn't even eaten yet, so my sister got up and asked the manager for a different server. He apologized and agreed and a much more nice, genuine server came over a few mins later. But not long after, she was still coming to our table, but only the other end where the teens and a couple family members were sitting. She would bring a refill or clear plates but ONLY on that end. Strange. Why didn't the manager have her switch with someone else helping a different table or something? Nothing like making our dinner awkward now with her being overly fake-friendly on that end and walking by our end so fast and hastily that a breeze would blow by every time. Anyhow we wanted to have a nice dinner so we ignored it. Next I'll proceed with the douche-like behavior of the manager: Our brother in law was a little intoxicated and had the genius idea to give nephew who had just turned 16 a taste of one of his beers from a flight he ordered. As soon as we noticed we stopped him and told him he couldn't do that! After that we see the manager with arms folded standing there watching our table. So at that time we're tasting our pizza that came a couple minutes before and it is LUKEWARM, no wood-fired crusty taste, more of a bread consistency, and overall tasted like a frozen grocery store version of a BJ's pizza. Not to mention the 'seasoned tomatoes' on top were straight out of a can and looked disgusting. I know because my mom has bought those canned tomatoes before and there's no mistaking them.  Anyway back to the manager. Since he was standing there eyeballing us we asked if we could have the pizza heated up, he comes over and says sure and then quickly says something about how they do not allow underage and drinking and if WE do that again we all will have to leave. My sister explains WE had nothing to do with it and before she could say any more he rushed off. He was unfriendly from that point on, and service seemed to go down the toilet even faster. Not yet finished with our meal, we see the server coming over with the birthday ice cream scoop with candle on top. It was pretty obvious we were still eating and not quite ready for that moment yet. But I can only assume it was the manager's hint to rush us out of there since we all were guilty by association. The server set the dessert down and when asked if they sing happy b-day he said ""we don't do that here"". I felt like a dessert myself so I ordered the beignet with ice cream and strawberries. Again it seemed like the oven or microwave must've been broken because my beignet was a little tough and barely lukewarm. Ughh disappointing.. Not the dreamy dessert I remembered from last time. Here comes the final blow to a huge let down of a meal and service: We asked for the manager so we could clarify we had nothing to do with bro in law offering beer to teen and we quickly shut it down as soon as we saw it. At first he denied my suggestion that service took an even worse turn because of that, but then he acknowledged that 'it did alter his perception' whatever that means. He reminded us that he could've kicked us all out but he didn't, and when asked why the server who was rude still continued to come to our table, he said 'we all help each other out and this was her area to serve. Um ok.. then why agree to a new server??  He was very sarcastic, nothing on the bill was comped (not that that was our goal, but it's typical of a manager to do that to make up for bad service!), and continued to blame us all for one person's mistake. We all agreed he didn't have the balls to go up to the culprit himself and instead took it out on us ladies. Never again!"
Kat V.,"Huntington Beach, CA",358,6,,1.0,9/19/2014,"The food was not tasteful. The avocado egg rolls was not good as it normally is. The pizza was, okay the waitress I had was horrible would never check up on the table. When billing finally came, she took off and never brought back even brought back the change. Bjs Huntington beach should not even receive any stars"
Teresa B.,"Costa Mesa, CA",17,3,,2.0,9/16/2014,I usually love BJ'S and I come a lot because I love pazookies and alcohol. But tonight I was not satisfied. Our server did not have a sense of urgency for our table and would take her about 15 min to get us a drink. This is a table of 3. Toward closing time my mom ordered a berryburst 20 min later she drops off the check and asks us if we need anything. UHM HELOO! We ordered more drinks! Not happy not happy.
Ryan S.,"Santa Ana, CA",3,24,4,1.0,3/26/2014,"I was not impressed at all. My wife and I went here for her birthday and ended up leaving wishing we hadn't. After ordering our food, it was brought to us by someone different than our server. They promptly set down our food and left which wouldn't be so bad except we had no silverware to eat with.  So after several minutes we were finally able to flag down a bus boy to get us some forks to eat with. Shortly after we started eating we noticed that my wife didn't get any garlic bread with her pasta, so we asked the server and she said it didn't come with any even though it was in the picture on the menu. Also when you look up the menu online, it clearly states that all pasta comes with garlic bread. After eating 1/3 of the meal, I then find a hair in my chicken and had to get a replacement meal to go since we had been there so long my wife ready to leave. All of that of that combined with the service not exactly being the greatest is enough for me to not want to come back."
Tina T.,"Westminster, CA",101,141,66,3.0,6/25/2013,"My boyfriend and I went here for lunch.  We both ordered salmon entrees, which came with soup.  My bf got the Clam Chowder, and we were disappointed.  It was really salty =( I got the Chicken Tortilla Soup..it was pretty good.  We had great service, but 3 stars because of the extremely salty clam chowder!"
Vivian T.,"Anaheim, CA",216,86,24,1.0,10/12/2014,I sat at the bar. For some reason I keep coming back thinking the service will get better. It doesn't. Service is horrible. I get my check before I even get my dessert. Didn't bother to get my refills. It felt like she wanted me out as far as she could. I had to flash her down for everything. They win for the worst & I've been to many bj's around the country.
Tammy G.,"Huntington Beach, CA",319,714,5721,4.0,8/12/2011,"For casusl dining, I have never left unhappy. Both locations in HB are great. If you aren't on Main street down at the beach, there is one at the 405 at Beach Blvd. I love the pizza, and the hot wings. Have also gone for just drinks & appetizers after work. A treat! The beer is fun to taste, they brew their own. You can get a sampler of them. Family friendly, but also has a bar."
Yolanda A.,"Hawthorne, NY",2,16,8,3.0,4/25/2014,"I went with a big party and we did not have to wait that long. Then our waitress came and she had some attitude. She forgot the high chair that we requested, she forgot the kids menus, she finished bringing the silver wear when we were ready to eat and no coasters with the beer. Food was really good and very good portions. Chopped salad was delicious but we got the check before the dessert was even on the table. Prices were reasonable and craft beer was perfect."
Gennie M.,"Long Beach, CA",188,194,204,4.0,1/22/2011,"Wanna chill on a friday night? This is the place to be! A restaurant & brew house all in one! Though, it gets really packed on a Friday so get ready for half an hour to an hour waiting.  Although by the time you get seated your table is going to be accommodated right away.. but be sure to have your order ready by the time server comes! (takes awhile to get your food) Got here @ around 8ish and it's really packed and there's a long line of waiting. Ordered the crispy calamari for appetizer & had myself a bowl of New England-style chowder and it was good though it was kind of salty for my taste.. For the main course, I had a slice of BJ's favorite pizza and it was really good! I got stuffed right away so had to take it home :) It was my birthday dinner so I had their personalize famous BJ's pizookie and it was the bomb! Too sweet though! Don't eat the whole thing! :D Everything is good! I wish I was 21 already because the bar sure looks great! They also have huge HD tv's all around the restaurant so you won't miss the lakers game or the football game!! This restaurant is also just located by 405 freeway and close to Bella Terra if you wanna have a 'lil shopping! Love this place!"
Dae'sha J.,"Long Beach, CA",9,26,8,4.0,12/18/2014,I love this Bj's Location. Food is always good and great service.
Bj U.,"Waianae, HI",244,109,15,4.0,6/3/2013,"My beautiful date had a rather disappointing dish... some sort of Moroccan style salmon that she didnt like lol but this is not her review :P Moving on! First off if u cant decide on a good appetizer just go with the ""perfect start"" or ""good start"" or something start i honestly forgot the name BUT its got their most popular appetizers all on one plate... u will love it... i think.... i did.... SO!... I had some sort of awesome grilled chicken. the meat was tender, juicy, flavorful and not to mention a twist of something sweet that they put on top as some sort of sauce.. Mmmm it was served with seasoned mashed potatoes and steamed veggi's.. it will be my next order when i visit again. oh yeah and dont forget to try their beers... their selection has something for everyone.. just dont be an idiot like my friend n order a heineken -,- waiter giggled pretty hard.."
Vinnie N.,"Huntington Beach, CA",468,368,82,4.0,7/13/2011,"Everybody love BJ's!  Alright get your mind out of the gutter, I'm talking about pizza of course ;) Order a beer and get down on some heavy carbs. Deep dish pizzas are cooked well most of the time. The salads, although a bit pricey are delicious. Get one with your pizza so you don't feel like a total fat ass for eating pizza only. If you're on your second pitcher, well I guess you're not here on a health binge. Service is friendly and the huge big screen tv's are great for watching sports."
Rob H.,"Coto de Caza, CA",1,131,2,2.0,8/24/2015,"We had a party of 10 for a birthday party, 7 adults and 3 small kids.  When we made the reservation the hostess was very emphatic that if we do not arrive on time they will give away our table after 15 minutes, there can only be 1 check and so on.  So when we arrived ON TIME our table was NOT ready for us and they kept us waiting 15 minutes while they set up our table.  If you are going to make demands of customers, make sure your house is in order!  Our waiter was good but the kitchen was beyond slow and this is at 4:30.  It look over 30 minutes to get their signature app plate on the table which came our warm at best and I do not recommend.  Then after another 15 minutes the dinners started to come out.  They brought out the kids meals with the plate so HOT they warned the kids not to touch them.  Are you kidding me, possibly burn little kids with HOT plates!  Then the adult meals came out one by one taking another 10 minutes to get all the meals on the table.  Other than the 2 pizzas that were served the food from the apps to the entrees was not good.  The entire meal took an hour and a half to finish and at 4:30 in the afternoon this is unacceptable.  Never did the manager or anyone inquire about our dining experience, it is like this is the norm for this restaurant.  Do yourself a favor and read the latest reviews.  There are to many other options in town."
Paul V.,"Garden Grove, CA",372,158,218,4.0,1/19/2011,"I haven't had BJ's in a good minute! Someone was craving their giant baked potatoes, and I was like how giant can this giant potato be!? The parking is always hard here, for one it has BJ's and then it has party city!  When we got in, we were seated right away, and the first thing I noticed they changed the place up a bit, well more like upgraded. They now have..which looked like 42 inch tvs around the restaurant, and one giant one at the bar. If I remember correctly it used to be 4 tv's instead of one giant one!  The server helped us in a quick manner, ordered our drinks as well as our orders, I forgot to ask for no tomatoes!!  When my salad came out it looked heavenly! I moved over the avocado, and found it pretty easy to take off the tomatoes, the first bite of this salad was just mmmmm!! =) 0o0o before i go on...it was a giant potato!!! I was very amazed, stuffed with chili, which was really good, and you can totally taste the beer that was in it..i believe it was the piranha kind. Back to my salad, BJ's cobb salad is amazing. I love the fact that the lettuce is all chopped up, so when you grab a forkful of salad, you don't even see the ingredients hiding inside. The crunch of the lettuce, the kick from the ranch, then a hint of bacon..oh and whats this a cube of turkey comes into play! Ahhh delish!  I will always come here for my BJ's fix, I've also had their pizza which is amazing as well, but being on a diet, it was back to this delicious yummy salad!! Feast well my fellow yelpers! - Ssp"
Trishanna R.,"Huntington Beach, CA",22,20,7,4.0,1/31/2015,"Decent beer selection and some non meat items on the menu, so it's my go to when I'm looking for a small bite."
Brian N.,"Irvine, CA",94,30,9,4.0,10/10/2012,"BJ's is better than just OK! You can't go wrong with good appetizers, pan pizzas, and beers. I generally go to BJ's for those after dinner munchies we all have. It's a great place to have a beer, eat good food, and spend time with friends. They have a great late night happy hour from 10-Close Sunday-Thurs. I enjoy their in house brews, but they also carry a large variety of other craft beers as well.  I've never had bad service here, and every time I go I have a good time. The decor is appealing, and the atmosphere is enjoyable.  I'm giving a 4/5 and not a 5/5 is because the food is good, but not amazing, and the beer could be a little colder on occasions."
