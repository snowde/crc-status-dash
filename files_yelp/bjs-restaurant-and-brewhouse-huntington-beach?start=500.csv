Alberto O.,"Northridge, CA",90,146,9,4.0,11/1/2014,I've been here numerous times and always on a Saturday or Sunday.  Not a bad place to watch a game and have dinner with the family.  The service has been consistently good and the food quality is consistent with what you'll find at other BJs.  You can find places with better pizza but it's highly unlikely they serve Pizookies too.
Liz W.,"Huntington Beach, CA",100,122,32,5.0,11/18/2014,Happy hour at 4pm was awesome. The food was great and the service was perfect. This is a new go to spot for early dinner. I loved the chicken potstickers and California club flatbread.
Brittaney P.,"Garden Grove, CA",8,65,20,1.0,11/18/2014,"I have no complaint about the food or service I received while eating here although I'm giving this establishment one star because my car was broken into here-window was smashed in. It's hard to enjoy eating somewhere I don't believe to be safe. I reported it to security and they had not seen it (isn't that their job?). Additionally, they stated it happens frequently in that parking lot. That should indicate they need to watch more carefully or install cameras (which they did not). Most expensive night out in a long time. I don't recommend eating here as its not safe."
Elizabeth N.,"Irvine, CA",82,137,112,1.0,9/22/2012,"I don't expect chain restaurants to have good food. I expect them to have mediocre over priced food. HOWEVER! I do expect acceptable service when I go to chain restaurant. Hey, your food is lacking flavor, you need to compensate with the service! Came here on a Saturday afternoon and it isn't that crowded. Waited about 5 minutes until our server came to take our drink order. He took our order and about another 5 mins later he came with my bf's beer, just dropped it off..no eye contact...no telling me wtf he just put on the table...and he went to the table next to us to ask them how their food was. WTF.....I'm sure it doesn't take that long to give us some eye contact...just one second, and he couldn't do that.  Also, when he came with out food he saw that my water glass was empty, he told me ""I'll be right back with some water for you..."" When I finished my appetizer, the waiter came to pick up with dish ""Your glass is empty, I'll be right back to get you some water.."" Comes with my main dish ""I'll be right back to get you some water"". Yea...whatever....I never got my water btw. When my bf and I were done with our meal I was looking around the restaurant for our waiter. I literally was sitting there for 10 mins looking for him. He was nowhere to be found. We ask a random server and asked him for Frank (that was the servers name) and asked for the check. The server comes back with our check and said that Frank has left. WTF! If you are going to leave for whatever reason, find a replacement, let me know that you are freaken leaving.  I was so pissed off, I paid, left a dollar tip (that is considered generous). I walked straight to the manager and told her what poor service I got from Frank...and guess what...Frank was right behind her. Guess he took a long ass break and neglected his section. HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE. That is all I can say."
Deanice M.,"Garden Grove, CA",0,19,1,4.0,2/25/2015,"They have the best sheared ahi tuna salad ever. Love this place If your looking for a good place to have lunch you must try it, great service and very nice waitresses as well"
Brandi L.,"Westminster, CA",297,38,55,5.0,8/14/2013,"5 stars!!! Randy at the bar is just freaking on top of his game!! He is friendly and is a great bartender!  Bummed that Corey doesn't work here anymore, but randy makes up for it.   My boyfriend and I are regulars on Saturday nights and only because of randy. Knows our favorite items and remembered our names after the first time coming!  :)"
Shannon T.,"Westminster, CA",0,22,4,2.0,8/10/2015,"I asked my bf, 2 stars? 3 stars? His reply, ""Oh, no, not 3."" ....and here's why. #1, slow service. #2, our appetizer was cold. The waiter did offer to get us another order of it but it took so long to get the first order that we just powered thru the cold. #3, felt like days while waiting for our pizzas. Waiter goes to check on them and comes back saying ""well, I've got bad news."" This is not something you really want to hear at a restaurant let alone when your hungry and been waiting forever for your food. Waiter goes on to tell us that our pizza orders never went in. 《Insert sigh and grumbling tummies here.》waiter goes on to say he will ask his manager if he can comp one of the pizzas and offers us free birthday pazookies. Still starving because we are still waiting for our pizzas but the waiter was very apologetic. In the end, pizzas and pazookies were actually hot and tasty so the night wasn't a total loss. Can't believe though that when the waiter brought our bill he said he couldn't take one of the pizzas off because his manager said the cold appetizer and the pizzas never getting ordered were NOT HIS FAULT. Well, who the h-e double hockey sticks fault is it then?!"
Cynthia T.,"Garden Grove, CA",5,11,4,2.0,5/25/2014,"I came here with my mom and dad and we were very disappointed with the service. We waited about 25 minutes for our appetizer which came out about the same time our food did. Our waiter wasn't attentive and our food wasn't that great, honestly. We did mention that we were disappointed with the wait time and service and our service still didn't get any better after that."
Jim G.,"Huntington Beach, CA",12,29,,2.0,5/23/2013,"Not a real great experience.  I was put off right off the bat as I and my guest were right in the middle of a sensitive discussion and the waitress walked right into it why my guest was talking and piped up saying have you made your choices yet?  She was totally clueless about what was going on 18"" in front of her. Secondly, we ordered pizza and it was cold when it arrived.  We both ate one piece and just had it boxed so it could be reheated later.  I've had better experiences at other BJs but not this one."
Richard V.,"Huntington Beach, CA",1,2,,2.0,11/7/2012,"I've been coming here for the past four years and have started to notice the service has started to go downhill. I arrived there at 5pm with a group of six and were seated at the furthest corner so that we couldn't see anyone else. Although we got the appetizer in a timely manner, the server didn't return for twenty minutes when the entrees arrived.  Overall the food was average and its only saving grace was that the pizookies were as great as usual. However the service spoiled the evening for us."
Jon N.,"Tustin, CA",0,3,,1.0,8/16/2015,"We have been BJ's customers for years and have always loved it; however, today was our first experience at the BJs at this location. First of all, instead of a pizza stand to hold our pizza at the table, the waiter brought us out a SCALE from the kitchen to act as the pizza stand. Secondly, the service was extremely slow, it took forever to get a glass of water, and we never even got a refill after continuously asking. We had our high expectations as usual coming in but at this location, I am not too sure."
Will M.,"Las Vegas, NV",65,36,21,3.0,10/18/2014,"Just ""ok"". The service was good, and it's a nicer restaurant feeling atmosphere. I ordered the ribeye and it tasted about how you would expect a $20 steak to taste, or maybe worse than average. It was thick enough, but so tough that my teeth hurt for like an hour afterward. It was also overcooked and had no flavor, which didn't help. I'll have to drop a thank you note in the mail to the folks who make A-1 for making tonight's dinner bearable."
Rich P.,"Naperville, IL",51,207,30,3.0,5/22/2013,"The best thing BJ's has going for them is that they are open late every night of the week including Sunday night when the rest of HB seems to turn into a ghost town. We happend upon BJ's at about 10:00 pm on a Sunday and it was the only place still serving a full menu. Menu is broad, if you crave it they probably have it. Service was good too, waitress was really on the ball. Food is average at best. Don't get me wrong, nothing bad but nothing stand out either, typical chain quality food. Pretty much everyone in my party(4 of us) had the same opinion. I am not a beer drinker but they have a ton of beers on tap, too many to count."
J R.,"Westminster, CA",0,1,,2.0,2/24/2016,"visit this bjs all the time and love it, however in this particular might not so much. Food came out wrong, never received condiments asked for and sat with empty drinks/beers for the whole meal. I am a sever and have been for a long while, not blaming sever at all, clearly he was to busy as we saw him darting around opposite sides of the restaurant taking tables in different sections. It was obviously  they cut to early, wich happens, however in that case management should have had his back and been helping out much more. poor guy was running around like a chicken with his head cut off, and any of us who are or have been a server know how awful of a feeling that is !!"
Tiffany N.,"Westminster, CA",756,316,1152,5.0,8/8/2010,"Good food. The customer service is great. Free pazookie cookie on your birthday! Oh so hot & warm in your mouth.. with a cold scoop of ice cream to cool it down. One time me & my boyfriend was sat down in a room, and was asked to move to the next room a minute later because of a party of 20+people. We were fine with that... but guess what! The manager gave us free dinner that night. Everything we order was on the house! WOW I did not expect that at all just for moving to another table. Five stars for unexpected free dinner!"
Christine T.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",239,320,15,3.0,1/2/2013,"BJ's is usually my favorite spot, as you all know. We were in the area visiting some friends, so all 18 of us decided BJ's would be the hot spot. Upon arrival, the people who greeted us were really nice and assured us that we would be seated promptly, once they were able to accommodate our big party. We were seated in about 15 minutes, and they were nice enough not to split us up. We had two servers, Brady and Jordan, and for them ALONE I would give 5 stars. Best customer service ever! I decided to order some of my favorites here at BJs. I got the tomato bisque, Ahi Poki, and the sweet pig pizza. Unfortunately, it was mediocre at best. The soup was good (as always), and came out hot. The Poki was extremely salty, as if it was just doused in soy sauce, and that was it. My pizza came out way late and warm to cold, so I wasn't too pleased. The crust wasn't crispy and the middle was cold and mushy. Boo. Our party was huge, but the servers were able to help each and every one of us to make sure our drinks were refilled and we got everything we needed. I just wish the food was a little bit more up to par. Maybe it was an off day. Regardless, I'm usually a fan."
Albert S.,"Santa Ana, CA",1,7,4,3.0,1/4/2015,Today I wanted Bjs for diner and wanted to use my gift card I receive l Christmas. I called in for some take out and I called beforehand to check that the card had the balance it said it did. It did. When I went to pay for my food they take out girl ran it a couple of times and told me it was not going through. I told her I just checked the balance and it had more than enough. The lady told me that it was not going through and she couldn't do anything about it. I ask for a manager and she gave me a look like a was making her waste Her time for spending my money there. She did call an older lady to help. She did solve the problem. Girl at the take out counter had poor customer service and didn't seem to have problem solving skills. Also my food was cold because it take an extra 15 minutes to solve this problem.
Mearedey T.,"Long Beach, CA",25,67,16,3.0,10/5/2014,"It seemed that if you want terrible service or rushed service you sit at the booth bar. I love Bjs it's near my house, the beers are awesome, but lately I come to find my regrets of not sitting at ""the bar"" the service is always excellent there, however contrary to that the booth seatings service sucks the last of couple of times. I noticed that BJS is no longer my weekend's first choice for beers lol...."
Lindsay B.,"Huntington Beach, CA",25,19,15,5.0,12/1/2014,"BJ's! Bomb. So many selections! Food is always good and fresh (from what I've seen). Pizza, Salads, Burgers, Pasta, Low-Calorie, Pizookie. A Pizookie for crying out loud! This is definitely one of the better restaurants out there. Clean and classy at a great price and the service is always good if not great. Great for large party occasions or date night/lunch. Who has 2 thumbs and is a big fan??"
Gabi K.,"Costa Mesa, CA",62,54,82,1.0,7/1/2015,"We came here again because we love the food. Big mistake. It took forever to get drinks, not to even mention appetizers (only 40 mins). The whole lunch took 2 hours; which is still kind of ok... The bill took another 20 mins to come....we owed $89... We gave our server Kayla $45 cash and asked her to put the rest on my card... After a while she came to inform me that the card did not go through which i was aware of. I asked her to punch in the number manually which she did and it was ok.... The card went through; i signed and we left. After about an hour i realized the server charged me the whole amount even though we gave her $45 in cash and asked her to only charge the test on the card. I immediately called the restaurant and spoke to the manager Steve who told me it might have been his fault since Kayla did not inform him she previously got $45 in cash. He aslo promised he would call me right after he will resolve my issue. He never called back and i still got charged $89 on my card. Shame on you BJ's.... Keep my $45... You need it more than i do apparently..... Never ever coming back...the worst customer service EVER"
