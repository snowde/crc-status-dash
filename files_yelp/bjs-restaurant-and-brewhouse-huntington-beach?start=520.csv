Elizabeth T.,"Garden Grove, CA",97,124,65,3.0,8/13/2013,"PROS: - This place is known for a unique dessert called pazookie, which is a scoop of ice cream melting on top of a warm cookie. I'm not regularly a fan of sweets/desserts, but I liked this cookie/ice cream combination. Their deep dish pan pizza is also very good. - This place is big so you never have to wait in line for a table. There are large booths that can accommodate up to 10 people. There is also bar seating. It looks just like the inside of TGIFriday's minus the loud crowds. CONS: - Everything is a little pricey, which may explain why TGIFriday's is always packed and this place is never packed."
David N.,"Wilmington, Los Angeles, CA",28,122,38,3.0,9/4/2014,"BJ's food is good as usual but service was not great at all! The manager that was here at the time was not very friendly and ignored our party! We ordered a large pizookie, and got the smallest size!! The free WIFI SUCKED!! PLEASE FIX ASAP!! will most likely not return to this location but hey you never know!"
Bea R.,"Garden Grove, CA",1,124,52,3.0,10/24/2014,"OUR favorite restaurant is BJ's like I said in my other review I loooove BJ's, we always celebrate our special events here BUT.... I was so disappointed on Wednesday!!! I decided to celebrate my bday here again and made a reservation for 27 people. The service was THE BEST!!! To be honest the best I ever had!  But the food was just..... okay!!! It wasn't as delicious as always.... my mom had a bacon burger and calamari and she the only delicious plate she had was the calamari. Husband had a salad w bbq something, oneof my brothers had salmon and let me tell you, that salmon has sooooo dry...i kinda blamed by brother though cause he said he didn't want all the white sauce on it but then i thought ""we cook salmon all the time with no seasoning or anything for him and comes out juicy not as hard or dry as the one we got here...hmmm weird""  I dont know I thought the food tasted differently I mean we come here all the time how can this be possible.... but any way I still had a good time. I wish I remembered the servers names though!! They were sooo nice.  I'm not sure about having a celebration here again, I mean I will be back for lunch like we always do but for events like these... I dont think so   3 stars for the best service ever"
Danielle A.,"Newport Beach, CA",60,92,8,2.0,7/23/2012,"I wish there was a rating for food and a rating for service.  This would get a 4 star rating for food and 0 stars for service.  The wedge salad is very delicious and the dressing is a great mix of zap and blue cheese.  Love the pizza, very different approach with the very fluffy dough and tomato chunks.   What ruins the food experience is the service.  I've tried this place a few times and out of 5 visits only 1 had an attentive server (it was her first day).  I did take out once to avoid the lower than average service and they put me on hold for over 5 minutes for curb side.  I hung up and walked in... only to be completely ignored and smiled at by the manager (young manager) and she happiely talked to all her servers coming and going around me.  It took another 5 minutes just to get someone to take my money and to get my to go order... I still roll my eyes when I think about how the manager just didn't addres everything around her and only her staff...  If I go again, I will have to plan an extra hour just for service to get the yummy food I like.  Disappointing."
Imran K.,"Walnut, CA",3711,725,48,3.0,6/6/2012,"This restaurant a large private parking lot but seems like one side is on a highway ramp so you can only come in from the parking lot side on Beach Blvd. This is tricky other then that the restaurant is fine. We had a take out and had to wait a little  to get the food. I had the Angus Beef sliders they are small, tender Angus beef patties served with grilled onions and ketchup on fluffy miniature buns. Accompanied by lettuce, tomatoes and pickles. Somehow I did not get the ketchup as you know this was a takeaway."
Iona L.,"Bellflower, CA",0,3,,4.0,1/9/2016,"Food was good, service was excellent.  Attended a large party of 50 and the servers were attentive,  friendly and personable."
Wonder Boy B.,"Buena Park, CA",4,91,5,3.0,7/3/2015,I am being generous giving this location 3 stars. Hot food was cold by the time the server brought our food out. Bartender was not friendly. I asked for ranch dressing on the side twice and never got it. Much better option in the area is Lazy Dog Cafe
Ken K.,"Newport Beach, CA",131,36,7,1.0,1/7/2016,Went for lunch 1-6-16 with a co worker ordered the soup salad all you can eat the service was atrocious! Was served after 25 min wait finished my soup and salad before my co worker was ever served. Ice tea never refilled when mine finally was my friend got his Diet Coke topped off with ice tea.  Never asked if I would like any more soup or salad had actually never saw out waitress again. Had to ask manager for check. When we spoke to the manager he was just ok thanks good to know! I won't be going back to this one any time soon.
Yovita P.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,65,1,1.0,11/7/2014,Service is slow!!! it's ridiculous! Meals came before our water!! We were the only ones in there when we came in sot not getting our water is ridiculous! To top it off they are just rude! Customer 101 needed. Desperately!
Tracy C.,"Huntington Beach, CA",36,13,1,5.0,6/16/2014,You never fail I live in Orange and refuse to go to the BJ at the block it's the worst service and food. I will drive all the way to Huntington just for your restaurant the service is always spot on. I always bring home food for my boyfriend and the servers always take extra care and always make sure there is extra sauce as I ask. The team at this location is the reason why everyone I know makes the extra trip to you. Thank you
J G.,"Huntington Beach, CA",7,46,8,2.0,11/4/2014,"Sad to say but my husband and I have not been here since their beer tasting dinner they had over 3 months ago. Our bill was over $70 dollars for cold hard rice, a sliver of chicken and a half cup of salad. We left early before the desert. Yes we did try about four tasters of beer. I did snag a bottle opener key chain that I refer to as my $70 dollar keychain (they were giving them away) I wrote an email to the manager after but I guess it wasn't worth a reply. Honestly happy hour feeds and quenches our thirst for less. We use to come here at least twice a month...I guess I still have a bad taste in my mouth. They have my favorite beer on tap. Someday we will go back but never for beer dinners."
Joanna L.,"Los Angeles, CA",482,760,930,3.0,7/15/2012,"So instead of running 9 miles to burn 1000+ calories this evening, I went to dinner with my sister, her husband and babies and her in-laws to consume 1000+ calories....hehe So I have never been to a BJ restaurant and this is my first time here..for a party of 5 and 2 babies the wait was over 20 minutes apparently because a waitress came out and handed out small piece of pizza to us....this is apparently what they do when you have waited over 20 minutes...nice gesture. We finally got a table after another 10 minutes and even though I looked at the menu while waiting I almost couldn't make a decision because their gluten free thin crust pizza sounded safe...but they also had lighter options that I should eat but didn't sound as appealing to me.....therefore yes you guess it I ordered the Gluten-Free Thin Crust pizza with sausages, mushrooms, olives and roasted garlic accompanied by a sparkling raspberry lemonade. The food took about another 15 minutes to come out which felt pretty long because by this time I was pretty hungry. When my pizza came out I gobbled down the first slice pretty darn quickly...however the crust is super thin but not super crispy - it was still pretty good though. I ate about 3 slices and that's bout 126 calories per slice so it's not too damaging. However I did spot a Gluten-Free Pizookie and I heard that they are super good and BJ is known for it so I had to try it....my sister ordered this other baked dessert called the Baked Beignet and told me it's really good too.  So apparently they overbaked and burnt my pizookie which was a disappointed because it was really chewy and hard to scrape off the dish....it wasn't as good and it's not because it's gluten free because I have had gluten free cookies before and it wasn't this chewy and sticky. The baked beignet was okay - it's like a crepe - but this was baked and topped with strawberry sauce, strawberries and ice cream..it's actually quite sweet. not my typical choice for dessert...even the pizookie was just a little over the edge for sweetness for me but hey if you have a super sweet tooth then it's a perfect dessert.  Our waitress was pretty nice and overall it's okay....however I must say this must be a good place to go drinking or drink because the first few pages of their menu are all wines, beers and alcoholic drinks. not cheap ... maybe during happy hour?"
Still Water Runs Deep F.,"Lakewood, CA",98,643,1691,3.0,1/14/2013,"Been here before with a co worker for lunch and came here yesterday with my gf. It's an alright place for those that like to drink it up.   The pizza here is delicious, no doubt. Otherwise I love the football games on the big screen tvs they have throughout the place.  The waitress gave good service even though she forgot a few things here and there, but overall good service for being attentive.    Like some other yelpers mention, you can only enter this place going North on Beach Blvd.   Overall, a nice experience from the norm.  Parking is a bitch to find up close if u can find it, but I always like to park far away and walk my fat ass over."
Deanne B.,"Huntington Beach, CA",2,3,,4.0,2/17/2015,"I love this restaurant, it clean the waiters are friendly and they have the best salad in town."
Mae F.,"Santa Ana, CA",144,37,12,1.0,6/9/2014,"I am very disappointed in my recent experience at bjs. First off, the customer service was horrible and no one was friendly at all. Every time we needed something, it seemed like we were inconveniencing them. Our appetizer came out after our entrées which were all cold. The staff was having a meeting during the busiest time of night while my food probably sat there. They never came to fill our waters or drinks and The staff just seemed like they didn't want to be there.  It's just very disappointing because I usually love bjs but this experience completely turned me off."
mike m.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,8,,1.0,3/31/2014,Ordered from the special menu....both my wife & I ordered the scallops with asparagus.....the scallops were burned on one side & undercooked on the other...so black on one side & white on the other. ALSO.....someone went crazy with the pepper.....way too much.... My mouth is still burning. Too much pepper on both the asparagus & the scallops.
Meghan L.,"Sacramento, CA",190,192,12,3.0,1/5/2013,"BJ's......I've eaten at many and well this one is no difference.  Our waiter was fine and then they changed shifts and another one came hooking up my friends with the extras. LOL.  Although it was fine and nothing unusual about the service, except when a friend asked for ranch from the person who gave us food and would never bring it to her.  Not sure what was up her butt, but yeah had to ask our normal waiter for it.   This time usually the food is great, but it was extremely salty this time. It seemed like everything i tasted was poured on salt. i had the clam chowder and the bacon and ranch pizza."
Shelly G.,"Huntington Beach, CA",18,18,2,5.0,10/19/2014,I really enjoyed the food and prices aren't out of this world. They accommodated my party of ten on a busy Sunday afternoon with in 20 minutes. The staff was attentive and the atmosphere was relaxing. Lots of TV screens with my only complaint being the same thing was on all of them. Would of liked to see some NASCAR along with football. Still a 5 star place and I will be back.
Lola L.,"Hemet, CA",35,357,114,4.0,7/28/2013,"I always like BJ's because of the ambiance and the choices available for beer. The servers are always ready to let you sample the beer before ordering it. Summer brew pretty good! It has an orange flavor with something else....clove? cinnamon? i'm not sure but I really liked it. As usual, get there early because it really fills up at happy hour"
Pete L.,"Fullerton, CA",26,6,5,1.0,11/8/2012,"Went with a group of 4. Food was ok, waitress was pleasingly great. So why should I rate it a star?? Answer: the hostess!? Didn't seem like she was happy. Anyway, she unavoidably greeted us and said there was happy hour.  I greeted her back and said we liked a table (group of 4). She pointed us to the table!? Fine, we went there and seated ourselves. Few minutes later, we expected the host would give us the menu, guess what!? She was busy happily talking with her co-worker. Ok, I didn't care. We could wait a bit. Then, like 5 minutes later, there was a group walk in. She greeted them and seated them next to us with the menu!!? Really!? At that point, I just wanna walk out, but my friends said to not make a big deal of it. Well, maybe bc we were waring like shorts and shirts. Seemed poor lol. But plz I respected u and just only wanted you to treat us like other guesses. Too hard for u?"
