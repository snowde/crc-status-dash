danea o.,"Huntington Beach, CA",271,65,3,2.0,6/19/2012,"OK first off let me say that I usually love BJs and have been to many locations. But i came here yesterday at around 730 with my husband and friend and were seated within 20 minutes. Then things went downhill very quickly. ordered 2 of there house brew hefs..... tasted worse than a coors lite! so we had to send them back, and told them to bring me another similar hef and they gave us blue moon. Then we ordered our food.  my friends pasta dish came out completely wrong. We thought they just forgot to put on the spinach on the pasta so we sent it back to give us the proper dish.... came back with a spoonful of spinach on top of the pasta like they just threw it on top. Then we realized it didn't have chicken on it like it was supposed to have, so we had to send it back. After the 3rd try.... our server realized he put in the order with the WRONG dish completely so that's why it never came out right. By that time me and my husband were done eating and my friend just received her food. don't let me forget.... the server NEVER took 1 dish off our table and still brought out our dessert and let us eat it with all our dirty dishes in the way. (and he was not busy at all..... walked by our table 5x and never took 1 dish and was talking with co workers the whole time)"
Frank E.,"Westminster, CA",220,4,1,3.0,3/26/2015,"after a long day of dealing with the agony of plugging the holes that my coworker left behind in the wake of an untimely and disgraceful political coup, all i wanted was to ease my sorrows with some cheap, greasy food and some drinks. I decided on BJ's, which is typically a safe bet for a simple combo of pizza and beer, but ventured out of the box slightly, similar to my newest slave drone, who is boxed into a void of pikerdom. My caesar salad arrived and I quickly felt my stomach turn the way it did just a few days ago, when the news of my wingman was dropped on me. have you ever received a caesar salad with american shredded cheese on top? no? because that's what I got. it reminded me of the frozen recycled salad bar at Chuck E Cheese, except with no pitcher of piss beer and skeeball to dull the pain. perhaps this appetizer portion of sliders would do the job. A few drinks later, I was stonefaced and ready for anything. but even though i asked for them with cheese and caremalized onions, I received literally just black meat and a cold bun with a shit squirt of ketchup and fossilized lettuce on the side. as I stared down at the comically tragic mess on my plate, I felt rage boil within my soul. to add insult to injury, I had to listen to the dick sponge waitresses gossip and hoot endlessly, a siren song that felt like a cheese grater on my tender brain. When I sent back the sliders, the final straw came, as one of the faceless broads, not knowing I was the one who sent them back, piked up and cheerfully squawked, ""oh I love the sliders! they're, like, the reason I work here!"" Utterly disappointing."
Max D.,"Westminster, CA",0,41,,3.0,7/2/2013,"I have had ONE good server in the last year or so of coming here... Yes, its nice that they are open late.., but they also start clanking dishes and turning up the lights, and turning off the music at 12:15, when they ""close"" at 12am... Our server closed us out right after taking the order, and we never saw him again, so as to ask about how everything went ...- it will be the last time I tipped 20% there. Your welcome!"
Hung T.,"Westminster, CA",12,11,1,4.0,1/4/2016,Another great place to eat out if you are lonely. There is alway a crowd and the atmosphere is fun. I would give them a 5 but for the food. Sometime their food disappoint.
Jenn H.,"Fullerton, CA",3,29,,3.0,8/13/2013,"BJ's offers great quality food and decent service. Everything my family and I have ever had here has been good. The beer selection is wide and sometimes the house brews are hit or miss but nothing is bad, necessarily, just not great or worth purchasing in my opinion. Its not a bad meal. It's not a bad outing so much. Just pricey. I can get a comparable (or better) meal at comparable quality with comparable service at a dozen places all over Huntington Beach for less money. It's not bad by any stretch. Just pricey, and there is nothing on the menu that really stands out enough for me to decide that this is where I want to go this evening. I will happily enjoy a meal there at someone else's suggestion but if it's my choice invariably I will choose somewhere else."
Darlene L.,"Huntington Beach, CA",11,7,,4.0,12/29/2014,Great pizza! Great bar food! Love coming here for dinner or just happy hour drinks to catch up with friends! The service is good. The bar area is self seating which is great so we usually never have to wait in line. This local HB BJ's is a fun spot to eat and have a few drinks
Pete S.,"Cypress, CA",474,1401,1557,4.0,2/20/2008,"You can only enter this restaurant driving North on Beach, I didn't know this so I flipped a bitch and my tires made a screech, We parked and came in, we had a party of fifteen, They wouldn't seat us unless half of the party was presently seen, Our server was Holly, she handed us the menu, Of course I knew I wanted one of their micro-brew, I got a red-ale, it was slightly bitter and hoppy, Brew in hand, TV in front, I was joyful and happy, Got to try a few things, especially loved the BBQ chicken pizza, It was flavorful and crispy and filling, I could've used a big bad sofa, No pazookis for us this time, we were so full, We had a great meal and service here, that is no bull, Even though they tack on 17% gratuity for a large party, I will be back, $215 dollars poorer in my pocket, BJ's is still cheaper than CRACK."
Liz T.,"Los Angeles, CA",184,567,194,5.0,12/7/2010,"This is one of my favorite Chain Restaurants.  The HH is great, after 10pm for a late night snack for 1/2 price mini pizzas, or $2 off a tasty appetizers.  Or just a nice place for a late night snack that's open late.  OH and the pozookies...and draft beers...so yummy.   I like the bruscetta small bites, avocado egg rolls, and tried their fish tacos-LOVE it, and of course the mini pizzas....oh AND dessert...pozookies are SO mouthwatering and you can get multiple cookie flavors- double bonus!!"
Bill K.,"Long Beach, CA",13,167,53,4.0,8/24/2014,"Good pizza, good service and great ambience. If you have room after the pizza don't forget to get the pazookie..."
Nicole L.,"Las Vegas, NV",21,131,33,5.0,12/21/2012,We walked in on a Sunday at lunch and the place was so busy but somehow they sat us immediately. What?!?! We ordered the avocado egg rolls for an appetizer and they were so moist and delicious. Very good. I had the shrimp scampi and salad and my husband had the sliders. Our food was good and was brought out quickly. They don't have cherry coke but they made a Cherry Pepsi and I was so happy!! Our server was Derek and he was so attentive without being annoying. He was genuinely nice and not a fake customer-service guy. Derek you rock!!! When we are back in Cali we will come back to this location...
Sarah B.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,3,,4.0,11/10/2014,Best Pazukis ever!!! :-) If you love desserts and sweets go to BJ's!
Linda M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",6,10,,1.0,3/31/2014,"As I'm writing this my husband is eating his lunch.  He sent his first lunch plate back.  We both ordered the scallops and asparagus with couscous. The dish was extremely peppery, as why my husband sent his back, and the scallops were not cooked on one side and over cooked on the other side. Chef Ramsey would have never sent the plates out. And if they had slipped by then came back he would have made every chef taste how over seasoned they were.  My mouth is still on fire. I should have sent mine back as well. I was completely finished with my dish and husband's replacement dish still had not been served.  His should have been a rush.  It wasn't. It took about 20 minutes for his replacement lunch to come. This is very disappointing about BJ's."
A H.,"Huntington Beach, CA",125,31,380,2.0,3/23/2014,"After a 45 min wait when we were quoted 25-30 min, we were not greeted at our table for over 10 min. The food was good but we did not have a single drink refill in the entire hour and 45 min we were at the table. We were not there for that long by choice. We ordered dessert for our kids (a cookie with ice cream) and it took literally over 30 minutes to bring it out.  The waitresses were nice but nice isn't enough in the food industry."
Danny N.,"Cypress, CA",230,4,,1.0,3/19/2014,"This review is for the service we received from a specific server. We've been to this specific location numerous times before and have enjoyed the food and service prior. But this experience was by far one of the worst! When we brought it to the attention of the manager on duty, he didn't take any ownership of the situation but rather just nod and apologized. Anyone can apologize on behalf of a server who didn't provide the service expected from a well establish restaurant. All we wanted was to express our frustration and to help the restaurant with constructive feedbacks that they could improved on. Sadly, I didn't feel this was accomplished."
Mike B.,"Chino, CA",73,111,36,2.0,9/5/2012,"It's been a long time since I went into a BJ's but I do have to admit the last times I had there pizza it was pretty good.   This time I had the Fried Chicken off there lunch menu and it was pretty good although the gravy made it taste 5x's better, too bad they barely put any gravy.  My GF ordered the Texas sized Chicken Fried Steak and I have to say it did not have much flavor, it tasted like a bland hamburger breaded.  They barely add any gravy to that making it tougher to eat.  Overall I didn't like the seating since the waiter and people bump your chair trying to get by.  Can't enjoy a meal when I'm looking over my shoulder. Although they never really had my business, they surely won't see me for another 5 years or until I forget the way its layed out.. Pass!"
Henry Z.,"Berkeley, CA",2,24,1,3.0,6/10/2013,"The place really doesn't have anything as favorable than its pizza. I tried the Chicken Marsala and it was very disappointing. It has a fishy taste to it - even though it was grilled chicken.  I did enjoy the pizza though that my sister and her husband ordered. I believe it was called The Works, or BJ's favorite. It was delicious and definitely made up for the dish I ordered.  Our waiter was great!  The pizookie is simply amazing! If you go to BJ's...don't ever forget to order this dessert after your dish.  Long story short, stick to the pizza and don't order the pasta or chicken. It's not as great as they make it seem to be. The pizza and pizookie are real delights.  CONS:  It's overpriced."
Rose C.,"Chino, CA",11,95,36,5.0,11/17/2012,"We've been coming here for Monday/Thursday Night Football and it's very satisfying.  The drinks are good, the food is better, and the pizookie is BEST!  Happy hour prices could be better but can't complain because everything is so good.  We've never had a problem with service.  We've only sat in the bar area so can't say much about the rest of the restaurant."
Anna L.,"Seattle, WA",7,129,162,3.0,12/15/2012,"Good restaurant for lunch or a casual dinner.  HUGE location! Boyfriend and I came here for lunch today.  The service was not that awesome.  Our waiter was not super friendly...he didn't smile that much.  I ordered a raspberry sparkling lemonade, but was served a raspberry iced tea.  My menu had crumbs from someone else's food in it. I loved the fish tacos!  The cabbage is tossed with a yummy sauce, the avocado cream sauce is delicious, and the fish is not fried which makes me feel healthier. We shared a pizookie trio platter.  Hated the red velvet pizookie...WAY too rich/sweet for me.  But the triple chocolate pizookie was great."
Cathy K.,"San Francisco, CA",492,583,848,4.0,1/4/2010,"This place has freshened up since my last visit ~ gigantic flat screen TV set amongst enticingly lit liquor of all shapes and sizes. This is a good place to catch up with your buddies over drinks and food. Known for their deep dish pizzas, they also offer salads, soup, sandwiches, burgers, pastas. I like that they include a page listing calories of their items - good for folks like me to make 'healthier' decisions. A large group of my grade-high school mates recently had an informal reunion and they gave us great service. I had the lightly battered fish tacos and a side of wedge fries. Both were a delight. No room for dessert, but I hear the Pizookie is a classic."
Marilyn M.,"North Hollywood, CA",18,21,2,5.0,4/19/2015,"We almost didn't go to BJ's because of all the negative reviews, but we had a gift certificate so we tried it, we were so happy we did, everything was great! My husband ordered the rack of ribs...mmm good and there was enough for two, the asparagus was grilled to perfection, another mmm. I ordered the pizza, it was one of the best ever. Our waitress was great, whom ever gave this place a bad rating must have been talking about another place."
