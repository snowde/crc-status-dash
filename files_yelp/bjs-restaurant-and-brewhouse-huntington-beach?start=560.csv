Barbara M.,"Tustin, CA",0,4,,2.0,11/19/2014,Went Monday terrible service. Hostess forgot to give us a buzzer. Waited too long. To b seated.  When we sat down served 3 meals. And not the fourth. Told 2 servers at the time. ( no fourth meal? Waited and waited. Told waitress and. waited and waited. Finally got up and asked hostess to send a manager. Waited and waited. Then demanded another waiter get us a manager. He finally came and bought then 4th meal. By this time we were all done eating. So our friend ate alone. Shocking.  We think the trick is order alcohol we weren't so our tip was going to b smaller than others. This night no tip at all!!!  Must say the food was good. Pity service was bad.
Jason D.,"Costa Mesa, CA",0,6,,2.0,11/17/2015,"We've gone for lunch during the week one too many times.  Usually go after lunch rush about 1:30pm.  The food is good, the service is friendly, but every time we have to wait around for a server and tackle them and flag them down just to take our order or bring a refill.  The frustrating part is you can see them laughing and talking at their station or behind the bar with a restaurant that is not very busy yet they neglect the customers.  This has happened probably 5 or 6 times....I'm the fool for continuing to return but have finally decided not to."
Mary N.,"San Diego, CA",0,3,,3.0,11/17/2014,"We don't go to BJ's very often but everytime we do go, the pizza has never been hot, sometimes warm to cold. We went again today for lunch and I have finally come to the conclusion the reason the pizza is never hot is because they must have the crust premade/precooked. When someone places the order, they throw the toppings that were ordered on the pizza, put it in the oven for just a few minutes to let the cheese melt and serve. Why did it take me so many years to figure this out? This is the only logical answer. This has been an ongoing discussion for years with the group that I go to BJ's with. We enjoy their pizza, but would enjoy it a lot more if the pizza came out hot. Has anyone else noticed this??"
Joe P.,"Huntington Beach, CA",123,1480,5934,3.0,2/21/2012,I came here for Happy Hour on a Thu recently and I was disappointed. The food was OK but the place seemed empty. I have not been in a while so I guess all the cool people hang out elsewhere
Mike M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",1821,1380,381,4.0,11/18/2009,"The family came here tonight for a Boy Scout Fundraiser as well as celebrating my son's birthday.   There is plenty of parking, the place is huge, well lit and well staffed. Good lettuce wraps, tasty wedge salad, and a pretty hearty minestrone soup.  It is not the best pizza in town, but the deep dish is quite good, especially for a chain.  The beer sampler is always a personal favorite.  Four champagne flute sized glasses topped with fresh brews.  The kid sized spaghetti plate was huge and pretty cheap. Our server, Kendra, was sweet and attentive. Like I said, it is not gourmet food.  Great family atmosphere, good service, tasty cheap food.  We had a great evening."
Ailee F.,"Santa Ana, CA",176,144,7,3.0,9/16/2010,"3.5 stars I don't really get why this particular location always has a long wait. Most of the time I go there, the wait is like 1 hour long and we end up leaving to another restaurant or the other BJ's on Main St.  Everything is usually ok here, but that's kind of it. It's ok. The clam chowder is really good though, IMO better than Splash Cafe's in Pismo Beach. The BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich is also really good, but it's kind of huge, good for sharing I guess, I can't finish one of those things by itself.  Their root beer is also awesome!"
Kay-Lynn M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,27,2,5.0,2/2/2014,"I really enjoy Bjs in general, but this one was a bit better than the rest. The food was excellent. The staff was very friendly. And since I went here form my bridal shower, I also got a complementary pazookie. I definitely recommend this Bjs."
Lychee W.,"Huntington Beach, CA",109,78,122,3.0,2/13/2012,"Bj's is a fun place to go with groups of friends. ok service, but yummy food. They have a good selection of beers and cocktails and definitely have great pizza.  I've been to this location so many times and every time I always end up waiting a really long time for service but every dish I've had was really good. It seems like they have a lot of servers but mine seems to disappear all the time and if I ask another server, they just say they'll get mine... My favorites would have to be any kind of pizza, chardonnay shrimp pasta, and the Parmesan crusted chicken and sweet onion strings with ranch as a side dish. Definitely always have to order a pazookie when I come here. It's basically the giant cookie with ice cream but it is always a must when I come here."
Bani G.,"Anaheim, CA",24,16,4,2.0,8/21/2014,"Wow! This place was very unorganized, food took a looooooong time to come out and it was cold, orders were wrong. Sorry guys but ya blew it! They were never rude to us and they did give us free dessert so that was nice but I won't come back to this location."
Christina S.,"Fountain Valley, CA",51,3,,2.0,3/8/2015,"Absolutely the WORST restaurant experience of my entire life. I came here with my family, 11 of us, for my moms birthday on a Sunday at 3pm. First we had a waitress who took our drink order, while half of the table received our drinks the other did not and then a 2nd waitress came who was taking over for the first waitress. She told us she would be our new waitress and that the other one was off but was starting our order since the new waitress had to go the bathroom :/. Gross. I did not want to think about my waitress using the bathroom ""for a while"" before she was getting my food. She then retook our drink order for those who weren't served yet. When she came back with drinks and started taking our food order she started complaining that she was waitressing at all since she was always in the bar serving drinks and that ""they decided hey she's here let's send her out to waitress for an entire room"" and told another table she'll get to them when she can and quietly said even if it does take me 20 minutes to get there. We ordered our food and a salad and an appetizer that she said she'd bring right out. The salad never came and the appetizer came with the food. But before it came we had another waitress change. This waitress was nice and good and the best by far. Before the other waitress left she told us our food will be right out only about 10 more minutes-we had already been waiting at least 20 minutes. The food finally came-2 of ours anyway. Then a couple minutes later they brought out 4 more plates and 3 of them were wrong. Wrong fries, no cheese on burger, no tomatoes on pizza. The fries were replaced quickly, the tomatoes took about 10 minutes, and the cheese never came. In the meantime 3 of us were still waiting for our food. We complained that the table was half way done with their food and the others hadn't even arrived. Finally another plate came out-wrong fries again. Also the gm came over to us. What a creep! My husband explained the situation and there was no apology, no rush, no movement from this guy. Instead he justified it saying that he was not another server ""just the general manager"" and was trying to make it better. My husband said just bring the food out so we can eat. He said I understand sir and we are working on that but in the meantime please understand we're working on it and doing what we can. All while leaning on a chair next to us wanting to debate rather than fix. I said just go get the food please we do t need a discussion. He stared at me with an asshole look stood up and rolled his eyes and turned and walked away while shaking his head. I said to my husband ""what an asshole"". He turned around and walked back over to us saying there was no reason for name calling and he did not appreciate that type of language in his restaurant. What?! My husband explained again how there were STILL 2 people waiting for their plates and he was MUCH more concerned with my ""name calling"" and needing to battle us. We literally had to tell him just please go and get our food-sternly. He left and came back with no food asking the people now what did you order that you're waiting for. So after they ordered again about 2 minutes later one plate came-wrong fries. We asked again for the right fries and the tomatoes. The tomatoes finally came the right fries never did. But the gm came back and asked the last person what they ordered, this was the 4th time she ordered. As he asked her I, in my husbands ear, quietly said he's taking her order again! He was STARING at me not even paying attention to her because he was so worried about what I was saying to my husband. He gave me a dirty look my husband told him to stop looking at his wife that way he then said ok and went to the end of the table to ask once more what she had ordered. She said just cancel it and shared with people at the table. He then went to the bar and was pointing us out-literally-to a guy sitting at the bar! A few minutes later he came back knelt down whispering to my mom who's birthday it was how she liked her food that she finally got and then told her that the entire tables bill would be covered. That was impressive considering his behavior before. But I feel he owed me and especially my husband the explanation since it was my husband he was dealing with and an apology. He never once apologized to any of us. The waitress did many times. She was great and we left her a BIG tip. He, even though waived the bill, was just so bad and uncomfortable. It was a very weird uncomfortable situation. He was extremely creepy in his manner. I seriously can not believe and have NEVER seen a manager behave and battle in the way he did. It was SO bad. The 2 stars are because the food is good."
Kilgore T.,"Costa Mesa, CA",1,10,,3.0,9/16/2014,"I like this BJ's and I always sit at the bar.  On the few occasions that I sat at a bar adjacent table the service was horrible, but at the bar the service is great. The food is good, or at least the same as any other BJ's. My BIG complaint is the freshness of their ""guest"" beers. EVERY time I go I ask what the seasonal Sierra Nevada beer is and EVERY time it is a horribly out of date beer. Last night they had SN Celebration Ale, a winter beer that hasn't been distributed for at least 9 months.  The bev manager and the distributor obviously don't care about freshness. I only hope the restaurant manager cares more but it makes me wonder."
Joshua H.,"Santa Ana, CA",76,53,21,4.0,9/26/2012,"I have to admit, most BJs get very crowded and the idea of bringing a big group is not the wisest, especially if there are sports events showing. But on numerous occasions i have called in for groups 9 people (if its bigger you will have to get a special reservations) and once I've arrived they have accommodated accordingly and sat us within 15-20mins during Sunday Football. I usually call in right before i get ready to drive, so that gives me like 20 mins of driving time. The management team here do what they can to please large parties. So feel free to speak to them if anything ever is needed or misunderstood. Here's a tip. Call in and put your group of 9 on the list, and then once you get there you can easily add 1-3 more people based on the section they put you in. It just depends on availability. Request the long tabled narrow section that has 2 designated tvs, (behind the hostess desk in the corner). Remember they will not usually allow you to call in a party of more than 9. So keep that magic number in mind. If you are waiting, remember the BAR is open seating and you can easily grab an open chair and drink a few beers while you wait. One last tip. During Football games, it is Happy Hour. So all mini Pizzas are half off and they discount Cocktails and appetizers. ENJOY"
Nikki N.,"Orange County, CA",742,348,660,4.0,12/6/2011,I am so sad to say that they discontinued my favorite dish. Chardonnay Shrimp pasta. IT WAS THE SHIT!!!!! oh whyyyyyyyyyyyy =(
Jorge T.,"Long Beach, CA",28,97,17,2.0,6/23/2014,It was an interesting experience in this BJ's because usually I have good experiences in other locations. First the front of the house was horrible. The ladies that should greet you just wondering around playing around and giving excuses when you call them out on their lack of attention. I personally think the girl with the glasses placed us in a horrible section with babies screaming and such. The only good thing about this was our waitress was attentive. I don't blame the staff... I blame management. The manager should keep a check on their staff who is goofing off. If you can avoid this place and go some where else just headaches....
Autumn R.,"Anaheim, CA",30,15,16,5.0,4/8/2014,Sean is the best! he is the best waiter at this bjs! he always refills drinks as soon as he can! we came here tonight with. huge party and he got a shitty tip but totally understood and we felt horrible and he made us feel good about the tip! he is the greatest person ever!!
Joann N.,"Westminster, CA",122,80,33,5.0,10/24/2012,Great service and delicious food! I'm in love with their pizookie! My friend ordered the giant one for our entire table! We killed it!
Travis C.,"Alhambra, CA",108,17,,4.0,5/12/2013,"A tad hard to find, we would have thought it was in the huge mall with all the other chain restaurants, but it was a block and a half down near the party city.  Huge place, cool waiter, came close to closing and was still very busy. We ordered three appetizers and drinks, beer and shots were good. Appetizers we're too bad."
Lindsey S.,"Stamford, CT",89,75,9,3.0,3/18/2014,"The wait is long ! But- if you go into the bar area the stools over there are first come first serve. My sister and I didn't have to wait at all. The food was good- we had an order or the southwestern egg rolls (those were amazinggg) I ordered the mozzarella salad which was good but they overwhelmed it a little too much with onions.. And I got blackened shrimp tacos, pretty good. If I went back to huntington I'd eat somewhere else but I wouldn't disregard BJs completely"
Willie B.,"Orange County, CA",63,79,8,5.0,11/14/2012,"This has always been one of my favorite place to get eat pizza and drink some ""alcoholic beverages"". I always get the Buffalo Chicken Pizza, a blonde (beer), Pink Cadillac and a strawberry mojito.  Also, kudos to BJs for honoring veteran with a free mini pizza!"
Ally S.,"Round Rock, TX",0,33,49,5.0,12/23/2012,"I visited on Sunday Lunch. I had a coupon for two soup or salad + medium pizza + Pizookie for $19.95. I and my husband got a glass of beer and cream soda for each. Waitress let my husband try some samples of beer which was super nice of hers. Cream soda I got was pretty nice. It was only $2.95 I think. Beer was $5.50 for a pint.    My husband got clam chowder and I got a salad. Clam chowder was really really good while my Caesar salad wasn't that good. We got a half of Five meat and another half of Sweet pig which was OK. I really liked the pizza from Old Chicago Where I used to go so much in Colorado. I wished it would taste like the Old Chicago one but it didn't. It is super heavy. I couldn't eat that much. I don't know why! maybe because of the thickness of bread??! Anyway I wasn't that crazy about Pizza. And We got a Pizookie which is just Cookie and ice cream on top. Waitress asked if we want half and half so we did with Chocolate chip and Red Velvet. It was reeeeeally goooooooood. I totally recommend it.  After having so much food and beer and stuff, my check was only around $30.  It was the first visit to BJ's and I really liked here. I think me and my husband will go there more often. Also, Waitress was very good which made us like there more and more."
