Laura O.,"Huntington Beach, CA",17,30,37,3.0,5/4/2014,"Typical chain restaurant fare and atmosphere but the vast majority of the servers here are helpful and friendly, the food is decent and the root beer and cream soda is pretty good. Good place for a happy hour meet up or a quick lunch."
David D.,"Orange, CA",59,40,27,1.0,6/8/2014,"Love the food here, service really sucks. They probably need to hire more waitresses."
Matthew M.,"Orange County, CA",369,628,91,4.0,12/19/2011,They did it again.  Everything was good and cheap due to HH pricing! Salad - motzarella was delicious. pizza mac n cheese ahi tartare avocado eggrolls They're consistently good and always on point!!!
Mrs. A.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,99,8,2.0,10/1/2015,"4 of us Camed in Tuesday late night We all sat in the bar area thinking service might be better, Well not true its as bad in there as the rest of the place, Ordered side salads to be brought before the meal took 15 20 min to bring out then needed more dressing well that was another 10 min. This is the worst BJs We have been to the one at the Block Sooo much better service and food even in Laguna Hills Much better!!!"
Rachel A.,"Huntington Beach, CA",1,14,2,5.0,9/30/2014,"I live in the area and even went to Golden West College which is right down the street, so over the years I have had my fair share of visits to this BJ's. Every visit I had up until this one has always been pleasant, food hot and tasty (I love the pizzas, and the balsamic glazed chicken), but when I came here with my boyfriend Tuesday night on my latest visit, that wasn't quite the case. I know most people review when they had a terrible experience (which isn't always fair to the restaurant), so I just wanted to give this review based on how the restaurant handles their customer service. I'm not really going to go into what went wrong, because that's not really that important.  It happens to the best of places.. but what matters is how they handled it. The manager came to our table without us even having to ask to see her. Chase (the server who took over our table) did an excellent job, and even after what started out as a bad experience, we both left very happy and will most certainly return."
Peter H.,"Fountain Valley, CA",197,103,148,4.0,10/11/2011,"HAPPY HOUR YAY! Love the Happy Hour here mainly due to the epic thick and hearty mini pizzas that go amazingly with my favorite beer here the Jermiah Red smmmoooothhhhhhhhh! Rarely any complaints when I decide to hit up BJ's tons of selection on drinks, beer sampler here is a great value to get buzzed on, can't go wrong with any appetizers but I do highly recommend spinach/artichoke dip and the avocado egg rolls. Haven't ventured beyond to the entrees so can't comment give it a try these guys seem legit. Staff is always pretty friendly and attentive to any needs even when you are being a ruckus. Whats a night at BJ's with out a fat serving of your favorite PIZOOKIE! Hells fucking yes. And just in case anyone needs to know:  Happy Hour 3 p.m.-7 p.m and 10-Close.,  $2 off appetizers 1/2 off mini pizzas and $1 off pints."
Katie A.,"Huntington Beach, CA",39,4,,5.0,3/13/2014,"Okay, so I'm just going to flat out say that this BJ's is by far, THE BEST. I coach water polo at one of the local high schools and I needed a place to throw our end of the season banquet. I thought of Bj's immediately but had never done a restaurant before so I didn't know what I was getting into. I literally started out with a head count of 47 guests, which ended up to be about 67 people. I called their manager Tim C. probably a million times over the course of four weeks prior to the banquet. Our banquet was originally going to take place on the patio and then the head count was too many and I literally almost had a heart attack. I called Tim and he was able to move us to their bigger room and switch the smaller party that was booked in it to the patio. He was more than happy to email me the menu and the total price, plus the contract. Tim wasn't there during the night of the banquet but his other manager Dawn was there and she was fabulous. We ended up needing more seating and she immediately set up three extra tables and got our guests taken care of. She was there during set up, during the initial first two rounds of food going out, during the middle of the night she checked back again briefly, and then at the end she came by to make sure everything had went well. She made her presence known and it was comforting to know a manger was focusing so much on our party and its success. Kudos to management! We were able to order 4 deep dish pizzas, one pasta, and have a Cesar's salad. All the food was unlimited, as well as drinks. Cost $14.75 a person for the buffet menu and it cost a little extra for pasta but TOTALLY WORTH IT. The food was to die for!! I don't even know how many pizzas we went through or how many pounds of pasta, but my parents and kids were full.  I think the reason this night but I mean.... let's not forget about our service! I had three servers, one of them was Jamie and the other I believe was Trent. I feel so bad that I don't remember the last two names completely 100% but they were still amazing. They were funny and carefree. When I felt like I was going to have a meltdown from stress they were there to help out and were always checking on me and my guests. Jamie even cut the custom cake I brought in. I didn't even know they could do that! I was freaking out because I wasn't sure how to cut a cake and here comes Jamie like, ""Would you like me to cut your cake for you?"", is that even a question Jamie!? LOVED THE SERVICE. Trent was funny and joked around with the girls. His personality totally showed and he was very quick with drink orders and cleanup. At the end of the night, I know how hard those servers worked and I felt they deserved nothing less than 20% tip.  I was embarrassed that one of my parents was rude towards Jamie and I apologize profusely again. I appreciate the servers and all their hard work. This banquet would not have been a success if it had not have been for those servers. They busted there butts and they did it with smiles on their faces. I would not hesitate to bring my business there again. I STRONGLY encourage anyone looking for a banquet or large party venue to choose BJ's of Huntington Beach.  Thank you so so much!!!!"
J N.,"Irvine, CA",0,21,1,5.0,7/17/2014,"Awesome food and great service. Great location on main street, close to the beach and great bars. Ideal for couples and familys alike. Highly recommend :)"
Jessica R.,"Coeur d'Alene, ID",11,29,6,5.0,4/18/2014,BJ's has melt in your mouth Pizza Pies. The salads are large portioned & fresh. They both go down great with a cold beer & finish with that famous cookie desert.. yummy!
Steve P.,"Fountain Valley, CA",171,32,19,4.0,9/21/2011,Usually come here for late night beer with the guys.  Good place to unwind after a rough day at work.  They have many crafted beers on tap and a full bar if you need something a little stronger  - go for the heff (its my fav) - the beer sampler is good too for a good buzz - pizzas are good - gotta try the pizzookie - shoe string fries are good - chicken wings are BOMB
Teresa K.,"Anaheim, CA",57,138,43,2.0,11/21/2013,Great food slow bad service! Don't come here week nights for happy hour unless your into the long wait
Eric M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,8,19,4.0,9/17/2014,We went here for dinner with a few friends and watched Monday night football.  The service was great.  I had my all time favorite wings and shared the specialty pizza.  The food was delicious and reliable as ever.  Thank goodness the wait was only 15 minutes.  We'll come back next week.
Lan N.,"Knoxville, TN",289,409,562,2.0,5/17/2010,"When I think of breweries, two factors come to mind: big portions and good beers. The food is okay and I really only come here for the beers. Not so much the food anymore because I always feel like a food coma after eating here.  They are known for their deep dish style pizzas, pizookies, and bar food. Service is overall okay. Actually, the service I had today in particular was very poor! Our original server had some sort of sniffle while taking our orders. When our server changed to another girl, she was not giving us a time of day. Probably because 3 out of 4 from the table had ordered the unlimited soup and salad lunch special. I had ordered the chicken tenders with wedge fries. My dish was pretty good. Better than your KFC chicken tenders. Then again, chicken tenders are just chicken tenders. Nothing really special. Although my hefeweizen complimented my meal very well. As for the lunch special...not so special. You get to choose from different soups: clam chowder, broccoli cheese, chili, minestrone, and tomato basil bisque. The salad you can choose from house salad (basically ice berg salad mix from the bag) or the caesar (which i would recommend over the ice berg).  The best soup to have is the tomato basil bisque. The chili is pretty good too, but the beer that was used in it wasn't really cooked out all way.  okay I digress. 2 stars"
Mark L.,"Garden Grove, CA",1,2,,4.0,9/14/2014,"They are currently running the 2 for $22. Wedge salads were big, pizza tasted great and we took the complementary pazookie and ice cream home... too much to eat. Server Emilio was friendly and attentive but not overbearing. They only got 4 stars because BJs insists on texting you when your table is ready, it never works because of bad reception in the restaurant."
Chris E.,"Pomona, CA",81,127,6,4.0,8/17/2012,"I'm a sucker for the Pale Ale Nachos, the Great White, and the White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Pizookie. You set me up with that combination with a pint of Piranha Pale Ale and I'll marry you. This location has a great wait staff. I mean exceptional. I've never had an issue here and I feel like I've always been taken care of very well. Their assortment of beers makes the experience when dining here that much better. Albeit, sometimes the beer tastes off and not as good. My friends and I always joke that the batch they brew those times were lousy or didn't sit long enough. BJ's has food for everyone and can accommodate any craving for a decent price. I've been coming here for years and I will continue to patronize."
Gerry B.,"Westminster, CA",986,557,569,2.0,8/24/2009,Party of 6... From start i was not impress with there customer service. i had 4 friends and 2 kids.

Dieu C.,"Tucson, AZ",345,198,155,5.0,7/22/2011,"When in doubt, go with BJ's. You can't go wrong there. EVER. Not with BJ's! *giggles* Avocado rolls, bacon cheeseburger pizza, and a pitcher of Berry Burst Cider. That is all I need. Oh wait, gotta finish the night off with a chocolate chunk pizookie also. Now my life is complete. Okay, I can die happy now."
Jason V.,"CA, CA",18,178,928,5.0,11/30/2013,Great food and atmosphere....never much of a wait..great service and friendly staff...always takehome..and the pazookie rocks.. man try it you will thank me
Allison M.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,24,11,2.0,6/29/2015,Had my bridal shower here Sunday in a private (sort of) room as you walk in. Beware that it is extremely hot in there. ( only fans since you're not inside the building). To start the tables were set and I was impressed with that. However we had specifically requested that only brunch be able to be ordered and me and a worker had to turn the pages in a hurry. My mom planned the shower and was told there was no time limit when she asked. They had her give a final headcount two weeks prior and still no warning of a time limit. The staff though lovely and nice weren't really looking at the clock and managing the group very well. It felt like they cared more about ringing up the mimosa bill vs giving us actual food. Most people liked their food by the time we got it however some got half scrambled eggs and microwaves potatoes. I get that brunch isn't their speciality but it really was unfortunate. With the clock nearing 1245 a group came in with balloons and the manager warned us we had 15 minutes left. Something the guests and myself weren't prepared for. I definitely wouldn't recommend having any sort of event here if you can't fit everything in 2 hours. With having people arrive late and socialize it's not enough time to settle down eat and not be rushed. Extremely disappointed since before moving to Las Vegas I used to frequent this place often.
Kendahl S.,"Nashville, TN",54,7,8,2.0,1/20/2014,"While the food is always consistent at all Bjs, the experience we had with the service did not seem up to par with the rest of their locations. After being seated we waited approx. 10minutes just to be greeted (no order taken) and was told she'd be back after dropping off dirty plates- however when she came back she still attended to two other tables prior to coming back to us to take our order.  Once we received our food there was no table touch from her and we waited for 20minutes looking around to try to get our check.  In that time period I even watched her service one table even though another one was sat before them at least 7minutes prior.  I ended up asking the manager to get us our check - I tried explaining to him that our service wasn't up to par and that our server needed to manage her tables better, and while he was apologetic he made me feel like he didn't necessarily want to hear it/deal with it.   This was in the bar area so maybe the service is better in the dining room- I do have to say the hostess was very sweet upon our arrival- ill still go back because I enjoy the food and the overall ambience of the restaurant- it was just an unfortunate experience this time around."
