Maggie B.,"Anaheim, CA",0,44,1,1.0,4/28/2017,"We came here on a double date tonight. We ordered 2 pizzas for the table, fries and a few beers. The beers and fries were great, but our experience was rough.  My husband and I are vegetarian, so we ordered a pizza with black olives and artichokes. The server entered it as a ""BBQ chicken pizza with olives and artichokes"". I bit into chicken and spit it out. No biggie though, mistakes happen. We point this out and he puts in a rush order to get us the correct pizza. After bringing it out I take a big bite into my slice, only to have a mouth full of anchovies. In his rush, he entered an ""olive and anchovies"" pizza rather than artichokes. Apparently, he hit the wrong button on his iPad as toppings are listed alphabetically.  This is now the 2nd time that meat has been in my mouth tonight and made me nauseous. When they finally bring the 3rd pizza out it is completely correct. But by this time we've lost our appetites. The server apologized and explained that his manager has comped the 2 incorrect pizzas, as if he did us a favor correcting his mistake. Nice guy, but I'm seriously so grossed out right now. We won't be coming back."
Karin G.,"Phoenix, AZ",2,21,8,4.0,7/4/2017,"Thanks for being open on a holiday!! The spinach dip, pizza and pizookie were all amazing and much needed! Thanks for also having gluten free options, my sis has celiac disease and it's nice to have options for her! Server was good and very responsive.  The HH is legit too, 1/2 off on mini pizza, $2 off apps, and $1 off beers!"
Rachael L.,"Newport Beach, CA",139,6,,5.0,10/24/2017,"Went to Main Street last night with a group of friends and everywhere was pretty much closed besides BJs so we gave it a try! It was kinda busy when we got there, but we were seated and greeted right away by our server Tyler! I think that's his name..( guy with really cool long dark hair) he was super  nice and gave good recommendations on where to go out on a Monday night. The food was delicious and we all left happy :)"
Carolyne T.,"Santa Ana, CA",321,254,375,4.0,9/15/2016,"When I was younger my uncle used to joke with me that BJ's means ""bad job"". I don't know why but he would always laugh hysterically every time he said that. Anyway, you can always count on BJ's to be opened a little later than other american chain restaurants neighboring. I went to another restaurant before going to BJ's tonight because it was way too crowded and I could count on BJ's to have a seat for me for late night dinners. We sat at the bar and instantly got greeted by our server Preston! He was a great server, love his enthusiasm and the way he answered my question on what he would recommend. I ended up getting the baked ziti and my friend got the late night burger with skinny fries and clam chowder. Since it was Wednesday, they had $4 BJ's craft beers as their weekday specials. The baked ziti was ok, it came out warm and I wish it was hotter. The beignet is a must get for me every time. Screw the pazookie! They have happy hour after 10pm but its not that great. At the moment it's $2 off appetizers /flat breads, half off mini pizzas and I'm not sure what else, check their website for the full information. Make sure to subscribe to their emails for coupons too! I got $10 off spending $35. My friend forgot to tell the server while I was in the restroom and ended up not using it. I reminded him about it after they already swiped his card but Preston was able to have his manager fix it. Awesome!! I don't usually go to BJ's often but I know I'm bound to wind up back here."
Dez M.,"Irvine, CA",23,20,7,2.0,12/10/2017,"I usually write reviews if I feel like a restaurant has made an impression on me (good or bad) Last night was not a great experience. 7:09 p.m. We sat at the bar. Waited for someone to help us. I don't want to throw anyone under the bus but H.K, our bartender was kind of slow, rude, not excited, took forever to get our drinks, and overall kind of a downer. She seemed really tiered? Maybe before we came in the resturant had a rush? But the bar was pretty empty and the resturant didn't seem busy like most Saturday nights. We would have orders dessert but I just wanted to get out. Bummer. I gave two stars for the bussers and the food came out fast."
LC B.,"Westminster, CA",0,7,13,5.0,7/27/2017,This place has a great atmosphere. The food is so amazing. I had jambalaya and pizookie. My family went on a Thursday night and got a full rack of ribs plus a pizookie dessert for 18 dollars. Waiter Eric and Manager Lacy are so polite and go above and beyond to make customers feel valued.
Sharla H.,"Whittier, CA",170,7,8,5.0,7/7/2017,"So good... Southern chicken sandwich could use a thick tomato..... other than that Great wedge salad, spinach stuffed nakedushrooms, fries and gf: chicken artichoke pizza YYYUUUMMM!!!"
Kim H.,"Fountain Valley, CA",4,4,,4.0,8/27/2017,Great food and good service.  Pizzas and pizookies are very good to eat.  Service is great people are very nice.  Wait can be long during peek dinner hours but the food is great!
Anna A.,"Huntington Beach, CA",84,31,11,5.0,9/23/2017,"Props to DAISY! The only reason im giving this place 5 stars is based on the best customer service i have ever received by ""Daisy"" who helped me in take out. I usually get girls who look like they hate working there or are to busy chatting. If u only knew what a deal breaker service is to me. Anyhow great job to her! Hopefully management sees this."
Vu N.,"Houston, TX",131,97,1111,4.0,4/18/2017,"This is really a 3.5 star but my rule of thumb is to estimate up, not down.  The why;  2 star: BJ's is a chain, so the interior is much like all the other BJ's you've encountered unless it's your first time. Very clean, trendy, and commercial feel, it's definitely family friendly and group friendly, depending on your circumstances. The ambiance is very laid back with TV's all around if you're catching the game.  Is it intimate? Depends how close you want to breathe In your date's ear.  1 star: Our server, Jordan, did a good job. He was very informative and recommended a few things that we ended up purchasing. I was trying different beers and he brought me a Sample of a seasonal pilsner which I thought was cool. Attentive enough without over doing it.  1 star: The food is nothing spectacular. But it does get the job done. We ordered the chicken wings with the sauce on the side. Guacamole dip and chips, and the new nacho flatbread pizza. I can't really complain but there was nothing wow about it. But when I'm drinking a beer, anything taste good.  Why not a 5 star review? Because that would mean I stand behind the product. Believe in it. Do I believe in BJ's? It's good for on the fly drinks with a couple of pals while I'm in town on short notice on a late Easter night when all the other restaurants are closed. I'd come back if there isn't any other options available or if my friends suggest it."
Ed I.,"Temecula, CA",1,14,,1.0,7/23/2017,"You would think with this location being walking distance from the corporate office, it would be superb as far as service and food. Not only was the service lousy, but the food was pathetic. I've been to this location severalties, and other BJ's all around Southern California, but this was my last visit to the chain."
Jose R.,"WILMINGTON, CA",80,21,,1.0,8/25/2017,"Came here to have dinner as it's one of my favorite restaurants to go to and to try their new Churro Pizookie. Was greeted and seated right away, which that was great. As free being seated, 10-15 mins went by and we were never checked back on or taken any drink order. Was tired of waiting, and there were no waiters or waitresses coming towards our section. Very disappointed, decided to leave as clearly we were not going to get service."
Bex T.,"Westminster, CA",19,98,129,5.0,4/18/2017,"I've been meaning to write this review for a bit now I went with my boyfriend and two friends the other day and wow! I was so surprised with how great the was that night Or server, I believe her name was Susan, was amazing. She was sweet and attentive. If we had a problem, she took care of it right away. Susan was what made our night My friend had gotten a burger and fries, but the fries were kind of cold and limp - not good at all. We let our server know and she got them replaced with a fresh batch. Our drinks were never empty and she made us glad that we chose to go to BJs that night Thank you, Susan!"
Debbie N.,"Garden Grove, CA",15,65,438,2.0,8/20/2016,"Service here sucks. Everybody working here looks unhappy and the waitress never came to check up on us. We had to keep calling for her and whenever we asked for things, she always ""forgot."" We got calamari which was pretty good. If you go on their website, you can get a FREE APPETIZER OR FREE PIZZOOKI if you spend more than $9.95 which is pretty easy to do so don't forget to show your waiter/waitress. Although our waitress forgot to take it off our bill.... We also ordered a chicken bacon ranch pizza and that was good. A small size (6 slices) is big enough for two people because keep in mind it's deep dish, so you'll be full. My boyfriend made the mistake of getting a medium lol (8 slices).  We also got a strawberry lemonade. It took forever to come out because the waitress ""forgot"" about it... No worries though because I will tell you to never ever ever EVER get a strawberry lemonade here. It's seriously full of syrup... Like SUPER SWEET SYRUP. It's so bad... I felt like I was drinking corn syrup. It was SO disgusting. Oh, and our waitress forgot to charge us for it... But no complaints there lol. Seriously though, she forgot basically everything..  Also, if you ask for complimentary bread, they WILL give it to you. I didn't see anyone with it, but if you ask, they would bring it out for you. Strange.  In the end, we only paid $23 for an appetizer, a medium sized deep dish pizza, and a strawberry lemonade lol because basically the appetizer and lemonade were free. That deal online is pretty cool. Use it before it expires on 8/31/2016!! But other than that, the service really sucks lol."
David G.,"Long Beach, CA",0,19,,1.0,10/15/2017,"Waitress didn't know menu. Came to a family birthday celebration at this location.  My wife and I are long-time vegans.  The waitress says that they have no vegan options.  She claimed that (1) the pizza crust has egg (never seen such a thing), (2) all sandwich breads have butter, (3) the pasta noodles all contain egg (very unlikely), and that their only vegan options are salad.  Well, a quick look at their menu showed several vegan options (or items that could be made vegan).  This waitress didn't know her menu, and my wife and I ended up eating nothing (lettuce leaves and tomatoes don't make a meal, lady).  I won't be taking my family here again."
Jimmy N.,"Anaheim, CA",565,767,159,1.0,8/15/2017,"when you put in a name at 8pm on a wednesday night for a party of 10, and witness more than 2 dozen people leave after completing their meals, and still get no table to sit in, you leave a 1 star review.  I can understand if you're short staffed, just tell me if that's the case. Tell me you're short staffed, so that you're waiting for tables that are covered to clear up, than to continuously lie to my face about a table that's getting set up ""right now"".  Nevermind that you just denied service to 10 first-first responders for your local police, fire, and emt members of the community."
Connie Y.,"Huntington Beach, CA",58,156,782,5.0,10/16/2016,"Pizza and Pizookie what else can one ask for?  Had a craving for pizza after costume shopping at Party City so we stopped by next door.  We ordered a beet and arugula salad and it was okay.  The root beer wings were really good.  The star of the show was a large deep dish BJ favorite pizza and it was perfection.   The pizza had a deep buttery flaky crust and it was the best pizza I've had in a long time.  We got a large so we would have left overs for dinner and I could also pack one into my kids lunches tomorrow.  We ordered the wonderful pizookie dessert with ice cream.  I can't wait to come back to try the beignet with strawberries next visit.  And yay the Yelp check in gave us a $10 discount on our meal today, hooray for Yelp!"
Sarah O.,"Lake Forest, CA",472,129,104,1.0,2/4/2017,"Bus person that sat us asked how many and where we wanted to be seated we waited to sit outside and asked to sit next to each other . They sat us thirty minutes after we complained that it was empty outside ! They sat us across from each other after the whole patio was almost empty .  Talked to manager , she assured me about our order and our table after asking again.  Bus guy never came and food came only after people next to us were served food way before us . We had made sure our food didn't have garlic and we were assured it didn't , yet the dish has garlic . The service and food were a horror . Thank God we weren't starving !!! Don't go here no one cares about their job or the food they serve .  Seriously wish we never ate here .  Sad and waste of cash !"
Jonathan S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",179,260,355,4.0,2/19/2016,"4th of July weekend, 2013, was the time I [first] wrote this review.  Fast-forward three years later - things kind of went a bit downhill, but not in a bad way that I wouldn't come back here again; no, not that bad. Let me give you the run-down on my experience [today]  I ordered the Southern Fried Chicken, and it came with a side of mashed potatoes.  I wanted a full BAKED potato instead, so the waiter, Cory, was kind enough to switch my potatoes to a baked potato instead of mashed.  Okay, first trip of my order:  The sour cream and the butter both were on the side, when I wanted to get all of them ON TOP of the potato like people usually do.  So, they took my plate back, and the chef put the chives, butter, and sour cream on top for me.  Second trip:  I didn't see the pepper gravy on my chicken, so I kindly asked them to put the gravy on top of the chicken.  They put the gravy on top of the chicken.  Yes, I know those are small issues, but I'm sometimes OCD about things like that - again, not to say it's a bad thing, but on the other hand, I'm not Mr. Perfect. :)  All in all, the food (and service) today was at par, so I may try again another day."
Tanner W.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,9,2,1.0,6/19/2017,"Came here for my birthday dinner with my family, they all played it safe and got pizza.  I decided since it was my birthday I'll treat myself and get a nice big juicy steak, some asparagus and potatoes.  Ordered the steak medium, they brought me the most dry, well done steak I've ever tried.  The asparagus it pictured on the menu as nice and big, but it came out as little twigs.   After I tried it I sent it back, the waiter agreed that the steak was wayyyy overdone.   Had some leftovers of my family's pizza.  Thanks for the great birthday experience BJ's..... not."
