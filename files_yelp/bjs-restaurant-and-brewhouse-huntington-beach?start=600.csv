Samuel K.,"Garden Grove, CA",823,572,346,3.0,5/20/2012,"Clean and positive vibe in this BJ's but the lighting is pretty dark. It's been over a year since I've been to a BJ's so decided to eat here tonight.  Our server was awesome. Forgot his name but he was an older Caucasian man who went out of  his way to maker sure we were happy diners. I ordered the Jambalaya. It was okay. The rice tasted buttery and there were small chunks of chicken, sausage and shrimp, but just not enough of it. For almost $16 I expected more bang for my buck. I also got a dinner salad for $2.95 but the salad size was pretty petite. It would great for people on a diet.  Overall a mixed bag. I like the cleanliness and vibe of this place. And the service was excellent. I think their food is overpriced for you get."

Samantha L.,"San Francisco, CA",676,953,2057,3.0,7/30/2009,The food at BJ's disappoints me. I always go in expecting greatness but always leave like my meal lacked something.  The only thing that I enjoy there is their LUNCH SPECIALS! $5.95+ for a lunch deal :) score! Most of their common entrees are included in this lunch special.  Today i had a Caesar salad + pepperoni personal pizza for $5.95 and tax. I asked them for ranch on the side and they provided great service! The pizza is yummy!! It's the perfectly sized deep dish pizza for one person. SO JUST COME HERE FOR LUNCH but otherwise I think some of their dishes are lacking. You can make pizookies at home!! But BJ's is also a good place to celebrate a birthday with both your 21+ and underaged friends and family. There's a bar and plenty of alcohol! AND it's a restaurant for families so they don't kick anyone out or restrict any under-aged people in after a certain hour.
Sally C.,"Santa Ana, CA",39,28,16,1.0,4/12/2014,"Couldn't even bring plates for our appetizers. We are basically done with it, still no plates. Seriously. She could bring coasters to another table but not TWO plates. Okay I'm a lot irritated."
Emmie V.,"Santa Ana, CA",411,11,1,5.0,5/21/2014,"I absolutely love their Prime- Eye steak, but it's often a hit or miss with this because a few times I have gotten the steak, it was really salty. But it was still good! Their waiters and waitresses are all so peppy and really on the job, and I love it. Their manager once gave my friend a free meal because they messed up her course and I found that very generous. Overall, I love the feel of this place. Definitely coming back, especially for their Pizookie! Best, Cookie, Ice Cream, Cake thingy ever..."
Hung V.,"Fountain Valley, CA",598,49,30,3.0,9/1/2013,Me and a couple of my girlfriends decided to have a girls night out on some dessert. We ordered a pizookie trio and a extra large cheeseburger w bacon on the side but our waitress had some misunderstanding and we did not receive our BACON!! Seriously? How can she not remember when she clearly wrote it down on her small pad.
The D.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,7,,1.0,8/23/2014,"This is by far the worst BJ's that I have ever been too. Terrible service, ignored all the time, poor management, grumpy waiters, and slow kitchen. Skip this location. Close this location please."
Candace C.,"Cypress, CA",10,6,2,1.0,4/22/2014,Update your menu online and train your take out staff better. A little customer service goes a long way.
Linda L.,"Westminster, CA",25,40,4,2.0,10/5/2013,"I normally love Bj's and their food has been hit and miss when I come here for dinners, but normally the server is really nice and drinks were good so I still come back. I came here during a lunch hour, grabbed the pager and was told that there was a 20mins wait. The pager goes off and I turn it to the front desk and wait by the side for someone  to seat us. There's two servers waiting for people! The girl at the counter is confused but this whole time in waiting to be seated, nobody says ""it will be just a few minutes"" or even look at us. I watched two groups of people AFTER me turn in their pager and get seated. No one says anything to me. Finally the girl at the counter looks up and I look at her kind of annoyed asking what's going on. She seems pretty frazzled and says, ""OMG, I'm so sorry!"" And I tell her I watched two groups of people get seated immediately while I had to stand there and wait while everyone ignored me. Not that it was intentional, but the server was about to take our orders and threw her pen at me for some reason. She was apologetic and somehow it slipped but this overall was the worst experience I've ever had with Bj's. I wish I had gotten takeout and stayed at home if I knew I was going to deal with terrible service."
Jessica G.,"Los Angeles, CA",61,29,4,3.0,2/6/2012,"This review is for the late night happy hour only! Tip: sit at the bar! The bartenders are great talkers, know a helluva lot about beer, and will remember your favorite drinks when you come in often. I usually hit up BJ's after I work at my serving job. The beer is cold, the drinks, are stiff, and the company is a perfect compliment.  Late night happy hour eats are what they are: skimpy portions for a cheap price, but what else do you expect for everything 5 dollars and under?. I usually get the tomato, basil, and mozzarella salad. It's delicious and they will add some romaine in there if you ask nicely to bulk it up a bit.  My friend usually orders the ahi poke which is sashimi grade tuna diced up with avocado and served with fried wonton chips. I've also tried the spinach artichoke dip, salsa, potato wedges, and chicken tenders. All solid, bar food options.  During happy hour it can get a bit busy, so keep that in mind. Also, wines are NOT on happy hour."
Thuy L.,"Orange County, CA",1663,504,3908,3.0,5/13/2011,"2.5 stars... I'm sorry BJs.. you used to be much better... =(  Every time I go here with my friends we always get the same table.. it was 3 out 3 times we sat at this table. It's the first table on your right, right behind the hostess.  The service seemed a bit slow here last night even though they weren't that busy... We ordered everything to share with everyone so I got to taste a bit of everything but here was what we ordered: For drinks most of us ordered the Strawberry lemonade but the lemonade was the bottom of the batch so it was very watered down. By the time they came around to give us refills(which is when almost everyone's drink was almost empty) she said she was going to get us refills but 10 minutes later, she comes out and says that they are making a new batch of strawberry lemonade so they gave us the homemade lemonade. =( -Ahi Poke - the portion got a LOT smaller now.. I was very disappointed when it came out. check it out:   that is TOTALLY not a shareable appetizer. it was so tiny! The flavor was okay. I have had better. The picture in the menu just looked soo good, what a trickery.  -Calamari -   portions were small also.. I remember when they used to make these SHAREABLE appetizers shareable. False advertisement  is what I think. - Crispy artichoke - I liked this dish. It came out piping hot - Shrimp pasta dish but I forgot what it was called but here is what it looks like:   This dish was pretty good. The shrimp were very plump and yummy -  Blacken Salmon Santa Fe Salad - Pretty good. The salmon was yummy but then I love salmon so you can't really mess it up. Here is a picture:   I really need to get a real camera and take real pictures.. LOL - Crispy Chicken Salad - MY FAVORITE!   I love the corn, eggs, cucumber and almonds mixed in with it. The sauce is addicting also! - something pizza   LOL. I didn't feel like eating pizza so I didn't really pay attention when they ordered it but they liked it.  I do usually love their Pzookie but we were too full to order one this time."
Mike K.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,4,,2.0,12/14/2013,"BJ's has decent food and good beer but, every time we go there the no matter which one we go to the service is terrible!"
Beth H.,"Huntington Beach, CA",279,300,151,4.0,5/3/2011,"I have to admit...I was going to drop my previous 3 stars down to 2 after BF and I went for dinner and I had the fish and chips....greasy, greasy, greasy.... However, between the time I was ready to write my updated review and today, when BF and I tried BJ's for lunch, things have changed dramatically. See, BJ's has this new part to their menu named, ""New Flavors"". BF and I were trying to keep our calorie count low so we decided on the Chicken a la Fresca and the Creole Tilapa so we could share. About 20 minutes after ordering the head chef/kitchen manager came out and said they were still working the kinks out and that the rice pilaf would be another 10+ minutes. However, he could substitute. BF and I jumped at the chance for fresh, mixed veggies, despite the fact that I had to get back to work. When the plates came, they were literally a work of art. I personally liked the tilapia better and BF liked the chicken better but neither was here nor there. They were both really nice, well seasoned, flavorful sauces and fresh veggies, cooked to that perfect crisp/tender. We had several people, including the same head chef/kitchen manager come out and ask us how we liked the dishes. Basically, I would have the fresh veggies in lieu of the rice pilaf. I know I haven't had the rice pilaf but I love fresh veggies. Because of this New Flavor menu and the fact that I tried two of the new items on it and really enjoyed them both, your drop to two stars ended up to a raise to four stars BJ's. Keep it up! Loved the new entrees and loved the fact that so many of the staff cared so much to ask what we thought of them."
Katie E.,"Fountain Valley, CA",49,73,26,5.0,10/19/2011,"Pizoooookie! I think this is the main reason why whenever my friends wants to get together and celebrate something, we come here. Red Velvet: PRETTY GOOD! Oatmeal Rasin: My favorite. It has nuts though, FYI. Chocolate Chip: The OG. Double Chocolate: Too much chocolate, I can't handle."
Bijan J.,"Westminster, CA",1,37,1,2.0,10/28/2011,"We've been here quite a few times for both dine in and take out. The food is not bad, but nothing is really stellar there are plenty of pizza places around without the the problems that this BJ's has. The service here is awful. The hosts are rude and ignore you in favor of talking to each other. The takeout cashier is similarly rude. We came in to pick up our order 20 minutes after ordering it as they instructed and still had to wait another 15 and it could have been longer, we approached after 15 minutes to inquire about our order, the girl said rudely ""it's coming"" like we were being unreasonable in wondering were our food was after 35 minutes, but the guy behind her apparently had it packaged because he nudged her and then she told us it was actually ready. The servers are usually very slow to get to the table, slow to bring out the drinks and your lucky if they get back soon enough to see if you need anything with your meal. I ordered a Guinness and some other sever brought it out and nearly half of it was head. I didn't touch it and waited a good 10 minutes for the server to get back to the table to ask for a new one to be poured correctly she acted really annoyed that I want to have a proper pour.  I'm paying 6 dollars for a beverage I do expect it to be right.  The quality of the food and drinks doesn't make up for the extreme lack of service BJ's offers."
Jenn F.,"Long Beach, CA",24,14,2,5.0,9/14/2011,Easily rated 5 stars!  Great place to celebrate any occasion.  Food was delicious..I loved everything that touched our table.  The service was amazing...WESTIN (our server) not only handsome but such a sweetheart!  =)  great times ahead if you plan a date at this BJ's!
Jason Y.,"Fountain Valley, CA",27,3,,2.0,11/30/2013,"Good quality food, however very poor handling of group parties. They failed to utilize our reservation for 7 in advance and gave us quite a difficult time than I would have liked. On top of that, they did not give us enough seating or adequate table settings. They need to get their act together."
Amber N.,"Garden Grove, CA",3,20,10,4.0,4/23/2014,"Came here on a Sunday evening with my man to grub and grab some drinks. The server I had was such an improvement from my last visit. She was very sweet and attentive. Perhaps it depends on the section you're put in? We were sat near the front. We had the appetizer sampler and the rib-eye steak. The sampler was HUGE! I do not recommend it for a party of 2, we had tons of leftovers, haha. My favorite part of the meal was the side of Tortilla soup that came with my steak :) My only disappointment for this visit was my overpriced Mojito, $10 and no buzz :( My boyfriend appreciates the wide selection of beers though :D"
Joyce P.,"Fountain Valley, CA",20,51,5,1.0,9/12/2011,"Really, BJ's?  Really?  How do you manage to eff up baby back ribs?   I really, truly was craving ribs (think Lucille's or even Chili's next time, moron!) I pulled into BJ's wanting to give them another chance.  (Been there before, and the service SUCKED). Husband and I decided to split 1/2 rack of BB ribs.  That's the only way you can avoid gaining 2 pounds on dinner alone.  We wanted mashed potatoes instead of baked.  We declined on the soup or salad because it's EXTRA! The plate arrived with a sad looking, DRY teeny tiny 1/2 rack of BB ribs.  (they were a little warm, not hot), with a sorry little lump of plain mashed potatoes on the side.  BLAND BLAND BLAND.  Husband put 1/2 shaker of pepper on his potatoes to give them some taste.   First thing out of husband's mouth was, ""what? no vegetable?""  No vegetable.  Not even a sad lump of broccoli or green beans.  Empty place where the veggie should be.  Our waiter said he could ""make it happen"".... but at what cost?  Probably another 10 bucks. Honestly, the ribs were dry and tough.  We asked our waiter for extra sauce, and really? (?) it was BITTER.  BBQ sauce should be a little sweet and spicy.  It tasted spoiled.  BJ's needs to buy a fricken crock pot for their ribs.  They should be fall apart tender, but alas, they are teeth breakers.   Save your money.  Unless you just want to watch TV, then they've got your back."
Gabby A.,"Long Beach, CA",119,269,9,4.0,7/27/2011,"This BJ's location is soooo much better than the one in LB. Bigger, brighter and of course nicer.  Came here with a large group and was able to try a variety of pizzas and appetizers. I really liked the eggrolls stuffed with avocado..they were different and delicious.  I'm not a fan of deep dish pizzas but the ones we tried were really good. They did not skimp on the toppings which is always great. Service was great even though we had a large group.  I'll definitely try this place again."
