James D.,"Huntington Beach, CA",16,25,5,2.0,7/5/2013,"I don't set the bar high when I go to BJ's but tonight was ridiculous. It started by being told the wait would be 25 minutes. Ok. It's Friday night. 45 minutes later (and after before being told that we were next and seeing three parties seated) we finally got a table. My daughter and I split a calamari appetizer and I wonder if half of it was fully cooked. The batter on several pieces was still doughy.  While we ate our calamari, my wife's garden salad came out, with balsamic dressing.  She ordered balsamic vinegar and oil.  After getting over the fact that a garden salad at BJ's is iceberg lettuce, two slices of tomato, shredded carrots, and croutons, my wife asked for the balsamic vinegar and oil she had originally ordered.  What came from the kitchen? Balsamic vinegar and rice vinegar.  What cook can't tell vinegar from oil?  After waiting several more minutes for a check in from the waitress, my wife asks for olive oil and gets it a few minutes later with the comment from the waitress, ""it sure is hard to find olive oil in the place."" The oil tasted like it had been sitting out for a week or so. My bison burger came out (inconsistently cooked from well to medium from one side to the other) and cole slaw (think shredded cabbage with a dollop of ""dressing"").  Good thing we had the rice vinegar; I added it to my shredded cabbage to make slaw.  The delivery guy (not our waiter) also brought out some pasta dish, ""Tuscan Chicken Limon"", but my daughter had ordered ""Texas Style Chicken Fried Steak.""  Yeah, they sound the same.  Ten more minutes for her dish to be delivered.  We got a line from the waitress that she put in Chicken Fried Steak and she didn't know what was going on in the kitchen but our check reflected the ""Tuscan Chicken Limone.""   My wife ordered ""Maui Glazed Pork Chop"" with red potatoes that needed to be re-hydrated.  Warning, the glaze is spicy! At least we got a free pizookie out the deal but there was no apologetic attitude associated with the offer.  I guess mediocrity is par for the course at BJ's.   While we ate, a man and woman with their child in a stroller paid and left.  Immediately, two young, attractive, scantily clad girls sat down at the table before it had even been bussed. One got up to get menus from the front desk while a busboy ran over to bus the table. Almost immediately thereafter, the (apparent) manager was squatting in front of the table smiling, chit chatting with the girls.  I expected the waitress to blow them off, but no, she too had a conversation with them. I guess they worked there.  I was shocked that an establishment would let this sort of behavior stand when customers were patiently waiting for a table.  In the time it took us to get our check and pay, the girls had no less than 2 busboys, one waitress, the (apparent) manager and (apparent) assistant manager at their table, appetizer, drinks, and entrees delivered.  If BJ's doesn't think customers notice this sort of behavior, they're wrong. As we left, I counted three parties of 2 and one party of 6 waiting by the door. The night ended as we left the parking lot and had to dodge a BJ's employee running out the door in uniform, lighting up a cigarette, through a group of customers with children, into the parking lot. Did I mention the waitress and busboy wandering the floor texting? I don't think we'll return to BJ's."
Jaime N.,"Riverview, CA",27,5,,1.0,6/16/2015,"If there was the option for a negative rating, this place would deserve it today.  By far, worst experience EVER!  From the hostess to the manager.  Only sign of good help was our waitress who was sweating bullets.  Our waitress was working her ass off & had to take the brunt of our frustration as the manager was non-existent!  He didn't offer any form of good faith gestures other than, ""Sorry, I didn't schedule enough help!""  When I asked for his name they only gave me ""Oscar"", no last name available.  Our reservation was made yesterday for 7pm today.  Our party was at their door before 7pm.  We did not get seated until 8pm.  Our food did not arrive until after 9pm.  With many mistakes also.  One of our platters never made it to the table at all!  15mins to 10pm & our desserts are MIA which we ordered before the entrees were brought out.  Never coming back to this BJ's.  I would not recommend it to anybody.  Irvine or Block locations would be better options.  Or atleast call ahead & make sure ""Oscar"" is not the manager for that day.  Our waitress ""Shayla"", sorry if I didn't spell that correct, was the only good thing about our experience there.  We made sure to apologize for projecting our frustrations to her & made a note of informing the manager ""Oscar"" that despite her not having any real support she did everything she could to tend to us."
Mariah S.,"Orange County, CA",34,49,78,4.0,7/20/2013,Been her a few times and just recently needed to write a review  this place has been a favorite but just recently we had a horrible experience we came on a Thursday and Shelly (the server was great ) but the kitchen did a bad job of doing their part we waited 40 mins and thanked Shelly and the manager at that time for keeping us updated but when we got our food my husbands burger was burned and half my order was wrong I'm pretty sure they just weren't on point that day because even the tables around us were getting their orders wrong we didn't make a big deal and were going to a movie any way so we just left disappointed and are hopeful we don't have another experience like that ..and we're definetly seeing if Shelly's working the next time we go she's a great waitress and took care of everything else
Sara J.,"Westminster, CA",11,27,,2.0,11/4/2014,"this is directed to the company itself bjs not this specific location .. bc the waitress we always seem to get is soo amazing she always remembers the drinks were order thefact that i looove extra cherries w mine !  so that extra star is for her.. too bad can't remember her name darn it  ~dont get used to one dish !!! they change the menu like they change their underwear! !! its ridiculous!  two items i ordered regularly were removed off the menu! !   ..,soooooooo annoying!  ...we haven't been back to any of the bj restaurants,for what they can't make up their mind about the menu... smh ... ever think of addding to the menu vs. removing ..geez rip tuscan chicken limon"
Shirley H.,"Fullerton, CA",377,151,36,4.0,5/9/2011,"One of the smaller BJs in the OC area, but I love this location because they have so many TVs throughout the entire restaurant so its the perfect place to come to watch a game!  No matter what area in the restaurant you sit in, there is a TV screen nearby so even if you don't get seated at the bar, you can get a table and still watch. As usual, their deep dish pizzas are really good.  Warm, fluffy buttery crust and good toppings and selection of beer! :)"
Stephanie L.,"Bellevue, WA",595,114,55,4.0,12/2/2011,"Who doesn't love this restaurant? It's much much much bigger than BJ's I've seen in other parts of CA like by UCLA and has both an indoor and outdoor section which is really nice in the mostly wonderful weather of Huntington Beach. Service is always great. They are as speedy as possible but there can be a SERIOUS wait on Friday/Saturday nights when gangles of middleschool kids to the range of senior citizens all want to eat the BJs for its popular appeal. Also-the floor is slippery as hell here. I can't tell you how many times I've almost fallen wearing a variety of different shoes. I've eaten outside/inside/and at the bar...theyre all nice places to try. The bartenders are really helpful with drinks and food, something that doesn't generally happen everywhere.  Things I like here: -beef dip (with the au jus-it's sooo good) -spinach artichoke pizza -pizooki (esp the choco chip and oatmeal) -the small beer sampler -the blonde hef beer"
Colette K.,"Orange County, CA",190,227,106,2.0,7/8/2011,"We tried the soup and salad combo which entitles all you can eat soups and salads. The clam chowder was terrible and the chile had too many beans and not enough meat. The salads are plain, all made with iceburg lettuce, no baby green salads so it almost seems you are eating the same salad just with different dressing.  The cheese pizza was not as spectacular as I would expect since it is their name sake.   On the other hand, the food was very affordable, $6.95 for the soup and salad combo and $6.25 for the salad and pizza combo. The inside is nice and clean and the service was good.   If you want better food, try their laguna beach location. Its far more superior :) Much better tasting food but a longer wait."
N. Danny S.,"San Gabriel, CA",565,635,158,4.0,1/4/2012,"The Grand Cru is pretty awesome, plus its 10%!  They have a great happy hour here, and I love that its happy hour during football games on Sunday, sad to see the season end.  HH is really great here, discounts on appetizers and mini pizzas, just get a bunch to share.  Of course, no BJ's visit is complete without a Pizookie!"
Nick W.,"Huntington Beach, CA",43,32,1,4.0,3/2/2012,"BJ's is a great resturaunt as far as I'm concerned. They have a good variety of foods. Something for everyone. The bar is nice and they have a great selection of their own beers.  The Pizza's are great, if you like the deep dish!! The salads and pasta's are also awesome! I wish they had better happy hour deals, I would probably be in more! Never a disappointment, except when you get the bill!"
Garth E.,"Denver, CO",51,119,5,3.0,11/17/2011,"I had always heard great things about BJs from my LA friends, but had never made it to one until recent, despite the fact that they have them outside of Southern California. This is a good place to go and hang out after a long day, have a couple of beers and ""bar-type"" food from their extensive menu. I ordered pizza and it was good- deep dish so there was plenty of crust, but I enjoyed it. It's definitely not the best pizza I've ever had, but definitely not the worst. One of the people I was with ordered this salmon dish that was excellent...I can't remember exactly what it was but it had an Asian flavor. Definitely check for it next time you're there."
Gerard S.,"Santa Ana, CA",17,1,,2.0,5/26/2014,"Honestly I have given this place too many chances. Very poor customer service, unattent servers. I like bj's restaurants its just this specific location doesnt reflect what they should be. Do yourselves a favor and stay away."
Sandy T.,"Garden Grove, CA",53,112,75,2.0,2/6/2012,Went here with the significant other for dindin for my first time. I ordered some angel hair tomato pasta.. not sure what it was and a red velvet pizookie. This place is known for their pizookie but boy did I think I made the wrong choice of pizookie. It was waaaaay too sweet. I had to drink A LOT of water. Bleh. The pasta was also very sour and hard to eat..  Maybe I just ordered the wrong things.. who knows..
Nardys C.,"Los Angeles, CA",101,13,2,1.0,9/7/2014,"Worst experience ever! It took 10 minutes to get my lemonade because the waitress forgot about it. It then took an hour to receive my order of fries. When I asked the server about it she said she would check on it and never returned. I then approached the manager and asked if the kitchen was behind because I'd ordered fries 45 minutes prior and still hadn't gotten anything, not even an apology. He said he would come over to our table to talk about it as soon as he was done adding to someone's order. He returned 10 minutes later with our food. It took an hour for me to get my chili cheese fries, AN HOUR! When I asked why he didn't return he said he wasn't going to come back to our table without our food. I explained that when someone says they will be there as soon as they're done with something I expect them to be there. He also did not offer an apology, he ended up making it seem like I was at fault. Are you fucking kidding me?! Needless to say the service and management were extremely disappointing and I will not be returning to that restaurant and I will be telling my friends and family about the horrible experience."
Jovan R.,"Cypress, CA",82,59,304,3.0,10/13/2011,"I was here for dinner last night. There were a few things I was not happy about. There was issues with the service. When we received our food. One of our salads was missing. It took about 30 minutes to get that salad out to our table. When we asked why we hadn't received our salad, the answer we heard was unsatisfactory.  ""We're backed up."" I wasn't waiting on a steak or pizza, it was a salad, with no dressing. As a person who works with food this was not indicative of a good level of service. I asked multiple times for water. Which never came after 2 plus hours of being in the place. The floor in there was also slippery in some parts of the walkway. Which is kind of unsafe. These are my issues. The food tasted great as always. But the service was sub-par."
Sharon O.,"Corona, CA",410,443,46,1.0,12/9/2013,"All I can say is wow with my experience here -_- Me and my girlfriends decided to have a little Christmas get together here ... there was about 10 of us so I made reservations.  We get there and it took about half an hour for us to get to our table...first thing that pissed me off. What's the point in making reservations! Table was VERY small...we did bring like 2 extra people...but it was small even for the 10 we reserved for. Our waitress seemed VERY inexperienced...and wasn't very attentive. She spilled water on one of my friends, and at the end was cracking jokes about how much she ordered. The food was disappointing! My friend had a salad all the mozzarella balls were frozen, I had boneless buffalo wings...gross and so small, and the margarita I had was terrible was probably had one drop of alcohol in it for $10 bucks. I had fun with my girlfriends, but this BJ's experience was awful...NEVER coming back here."
Caitlin P.,"Huntington Beach, CA",150,5,2,1.0,6/15/2014,"Came here with the family on this fathers day. Worse service from our server lady Roxanna. As I sit here our cups and plates are still stacked nicely at the end of the table waiting for her to take them away. I guess we were SUCh an inconvienece for her. Wanted another refil of an ice tea 20 minutes ago and JUST received it. She rolled her eyes almost every time we asked her a question (can we get napkins? Can we get refills? Could we have some ranch with the pizza as well. And Thank yous around the table) yet, not one smile from her. So bad. So disappointed. My family is not the kind of family to make a complaint to management. I would love to but instead I'm writing my complain right here. If you dont like your job or tips, Roxanna I suggest u get a new job. AND My family and i will come back again because we love BJ's. if it were to happen that she was out server again, I would ask for another server and not feel ashamed. There were 9 of us total."
Kathy R.,"Anaheim, CA",3,18,1,3.0,3/9/2014,"I love the food at BJ's.  We go there quite a bit and usually sit in the bar area.  The reason I only give it three stars is because of the service.  It's always the same.  We have to wait at least 10 minutes before anyone even comes to take our drink order and then we have to wait another 10 minutes for them to bring the drinks.  Sometimes they are really busy and I understand that it's going to take some time but we were there yesterday and it was not busy at all and we still had to wait.  We ordered our drinks, appetizer and meals all at the same time hoping that would save some time and we wouldn't have to wait for our server to come back.  We also asked for two glasses of water.  Our server brought us our drinks after about 10 minutes.  Shortly after that he brought our appetizer but didn't bring our water.  We asked again.  He apologized and said he would bring them right away.  We waited for quite awhile and then I saw him coming with a tray with 3 glasses of water.  He then went to the table next to us and gave them 2 of our waters.  He then brought us one glass and apologized again saying that somehow he lost one of our waters on the way.  Finally he brought us the other glass of water and our meals which were excellent.  We ordered another drink and had to wait so long, my husband to hunt down our server and ask what happened to our drinks.  Again he apologized and brought them out shortly after.  I'm not going stop going to BJ's because of the service but I do think they need to work on being a little more on the ball and efficient.  We have been to other BJ's in Cerritos and Montebello and they are pretty much all the same when it comes to the service.  As I said, the food is excellent and I really enjoy their enlightened menu so I won't stop going but we just have to realize that service is not their strong point."
Big B.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,8,7,5.0,6/11/2014,Bomb food great beer what else is there to say....the pizza is to die for the wings are my addiction buffilo exxtra hot u can customize the pizzas any way you want with millions of toppings and sauces.

Josh A.,"Huntington Beach, CA",1,34,2,5.0,4/5/2014,I love bjs!! Ever thing from the atmosphere to the staff and especially the food the deep dish pizza is there hallmark but everything is good.
