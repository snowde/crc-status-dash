Patty P.,"Fountain Valley, CA",98,56,11,3.0,1/30/2012,"Good food! Service really depends on the server.  Came here once with a lot of people celebrating a graduation.  Our server Linda...the asian one (not sure if there's another Linda, but anyways) came by our table and said it was last call.  A couple mins after she left I ran after her and asked if I can order one more drink and she was snappy and said, ""sorry, I just last called your table"" and walked away. Seriously? You just came to the table a couple mins ago.  Anyways I then asked her if she can split the checks and was pretty attitude-y about it. I'm sorry but fuck, lighten the fuck up.  Luckily gratuity applied to our group, otherwise I would have not tipped. Every other time, service has been great though. Must have caught the other server on a bad night."
Audrey L.,"Danville, CA",322,353,1388,2.0,3/12/2011,"I've come to this location for a few work lunches and recently for pre-outing snack Each visit i leave feeling like a little underwhelmed by my meal and realizing how many miles I will have to run to burn it off.. this time i discovered their mozzarella and tomato salad- a little over seasoned but for $2.95, this is a great deal paired with a blonde beer.....its dinner!  This location was pretty crowded and there was a line of people waiting to be seated for dinner, packed bar, standing room only and slow service."
Luis M.,"Garden Grove, CA",3,79,7,3.0,2/2/2014,"The craft beer is always above par.  However,  the food is just standard. Its nothing to write home about."
Caroline T.,"Westminster, CA",279,147,16,5.0,4/7/2011,"My favs: Chardonnay Shrimp pasta- plump, juicy shrimp with a creamy tomato sauce on rotini pasta with real bacon bits! You can taste a little bit of the chardonnay but it's very mild. This is my favorite pasta dish but it is on the heavy side so share with someone! Mediterranean pizza FLATBREAD style- I love this pizza! They put pesto as the sauce with tomatoes, artichokes, kalamata olives, feta and pepperoncinis. You have to ask for the flatbread style. I'm not a fan of deep dish pizza =/ Honey Crisp Chicken salad- this is like a meal salad because it's filled yummy goodness and calories haha. Breaded chicken tenders on lettuce with boiled eggs and corn with honey mustard dressing.  Who can't forget their PIZOOKIE! Normally i'd be too full to have dessert but i try not to stuff myself and togo the rest of my dinner so i can have dessert. mmmm what is there not to love with a freshly baked cookie with ice cream on top?!?!  Another favorite dessert introduced! BAKED BEIGNET. OMG where have you been all my life?! thanks to my GFs who suggested to try the baked beignet. It's a deep fried donut dusted with cinnamon sugar, top with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, fresh strawberries with a strawberry glaze...I'M IN HEAVEN! Their handcrafted beer is delish and they have a variety of beers on tap as well. CHEERS TO THAT!"
Jacklyn H.,"Santa Ana, CA",99,105,222,4.0,11/3/2011,"I've had food, happy hour, and drinks at this BJ's location many times before writing this review.  I recently came in for Football Sunday and lunch. I had the Ahi Poke to start.  The poke was all right.  The wonton chips that came with the dish were possibly the highlight of the dish...  and for a poke, that's sort of sad.  The tuna seemed reasonably fresh, but didn't pack a punch in flavors (as a poke should). I appreciated the ""Small Bites"" part of the menu that offered tapa-like portions (and prices - around $3-4 a plate) of food.  I had the street tacos.  The server let me order one of each type (chicken and beef).  Both were well seasoned and delicious.  The salsa was good and not too salty.  There was a small side of cabbage and jalepenos also. I got to sample a piece of their new portabello mushroom deep dish pizza.  It was ok.  I dislike places that advertise for truffles or portabello (or any other specific type of fungi) and not deliver.  Don't get me wrong, there was about one piece of a medium sized portabello per each slice of pizza and a few white buttom mushroom throughout, but it wasn't anything special. They are serving their seasonal special right now: their pumpkin beer.  It's definitely a delicious beer to pair with your pizza! Service was great.  The server was very attentive.  One of the managers came out to apologize that the pizza had taken so long to come out (I thought it took a while, but didn't think it was anything to get upset about). Parking can get ridiculous, especially when there's a game and during happy hour.  It's nice that there's a lot of parking in the back though (that belong to the business offices -- don't park there during normal business hours at risk of being towed!!!)."
Jeremy C.,"Chicago, IL",63,336,1,4.0,1/3/2012,The California Burger... Need I say more.. Actually no.. I don't need to say anything more. Obviously you can get the pizza and all the other good stuff they have here but seriously.. Just get the California Burger and thank me later.
Karen C.,"Costa Mesa, CA",0,10,,2.0,9/30/2012,"Two disasters in a row at BJ's on Beach Blvd.  I think the reason so many of us do not have a good dining experience is the (inefficient and impersonal) SYSTEM  they have going.  When the server puts a drinks order (into a computer) you then have to wait about 15-20 minutes or longer.  Last week our server never got around to putting our order in, which we found out a half hour later from a different server.  It is a huge restaurant and we see servers RUNNING to keep up, and they sometimes  can't.  Last night our server would not even TAKE an order for a second beer until the glass was empty(!).  That meant (on the two occasions) we were not refreshed with a second drink until we'd been long out of what we had and the meal was essentially finished.  Apparently this is a hard and fast rule that allows no room for discretion on the part of the server.  We are in our early 70s and had not been to BJ's in about a year.  In the meantime we've been spoiled by other restaurants that demonstrate they are happy to have our business by providing good food and attentive, prompt, and friendly service.  We won't go back because it just isn't worth the aggravation.  Too bad because we like many items on the menu."
Stacy B.,"Garden Grove, CA",35,8,3,2.0,5/8/2013,"My husband and I had date night at this BJ's last night.  There was a wait when we walked in on a Tuesday night at about 6:30.  Not bad about 5 minutes.  It seemed though there was confusion and not enough staff to sit people.  It also looked like there was a front end manager, but wasn't out there until we had left eating.   I would never go back to BJ's if it was my choice. I had been there in my twenties before and it now seems like an overgrown giant restaurant with too many choices.  The food ok, just ok.  I could have made a better turkey cobb sandwhich myself.  My husband got the jambalaya.  Mostly rice on the bottom, but tasted ok.  There should have been more meat and veggies in it for the price.  Nothing special with this place.  Like I said, won't go back would rather spend the money on a different place who put more effort and time into their food and customer service."
Jennifer N.,"San Gabriel, CA",227,194,1186,3.0,10/26/2011,I took my little brother and cousin here because they wanted pizza. I personally don't like to eat pizza. The food took it's sweet time to come out. The only good thing is the pizzookie(I don't know how to spell it) I got the triple chocolate and I absolutely love it. They kept changing waiter and I assumed the manager saw that I was yelping so he came over and tried to serve/help me so I can give them a good review...
Tyler K.,"Aurora, CO",306,67,162,3.0,11/22/2011,"It's ok typical chain restaurant type place, nothing special but still good."
ciara c.,"Temecula, CA",288,211,104,4.0,3/12/2011,"For what this place is - a chain restaurant where you pretty much know the kind and quality of food you're going to get before you set foot in the door - it's pretty decent.  Went with the mother in law and my husband around 6pm on a weekend. We had about a 15 minute before we were seated. That was nothin' compared to what people went through an hour later.  Sat down, took a look at their drink/wine list, and wow! They serve some decent wines on their list. Waiter brought us those right away.  NOTE to anyone on a diet or watching their weight: BJ's might not be the right place for you. Restaurants in OC have started to list calorie and fat amounts contained in the dishes on the menu. Most of BJ's entrees will set you back nearly an entire day's worth (or more) of calories and fat. I was pretty astounded to see those numbers.  So, more because of the fact that I don't eat chicken or red meat, I ordered the garden burger. My husband ordered the Chicken pasta with masala sauce. He loved that. Mother in law got shrimp scamp with pasta. She liked that also, though saved 1/2 for her lunch the next day.  The garden burger tasted better than most served in restaurants. You could tell it was made with rice, veggies, maybe some wheat gluten. Came with lots of onions, lettuce, tomato and a gigantor wheat bun. If you love your carbohydrates, just come in and ask for the bun. They also butter and toast/fry the bun.  It's a fun place, lots of people watching, TVs if you want to watch sports, pretty good food and an upbeat vibe. They provide good and friendly service, too.  One more thing to note: when we were leaving, about 7pm, the lobby/waiting area teemed with people, all milling around, looking down at the little black, square pagers in their hands, every time someone else's buzzed. Get there early - or very late - or be prepared to wait a long time for a table."
Vanessa H.,"Bakersfield, CA",298,987,78,4.0,3/25/2011,"BJ's is a great place to have a solid meal with good company. Pear cider, great white pizza, and an oreo pizookie to wash it all down. People who diet may order something different though. :) It's always busy in the evenings so call ahead to put your name down."
Gigi M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",1001,687,2181,5.0,2/19/2009,All I gotta say is 5 stars for the following:  ~PB Pazooki  ~Avocado egg rolls  ~Beer selection  ~Menu filled with delicious of variety of different flavors  ~Chill/sporty/contemporary design  Have never left dissatisfied at any BJ's!
Jenni I.,"Huntington Beach, CA",246,277,40,3.0,7/21/2013,"I came here for lunch on a Wednesday afternoon before  I had to go to work (always a bad idea). I called ahead of time to ask them what the wait was and they said there was no wait... yet we had to wait for about 10 minutes for our table to be ready... I think a party after us got seated first (I could be wrong, so don't quote me on that). But it's fine, we still got seated pretty promptly. It took forever for the waiter to take our order though. I swear we were sitting there for almost half an hour when he finally came... it was NOT busy, mind you. The server looked a bit melancholic so maybe he was having a bad day. Who knows. In any case after we finally ordered, I noticed my plate had some food on it, so I was wiping it (as I do at Asian restaurants haha never an American restaurant like BJs). Our melancholic server asked if I would like a new plate and so I said yes and he took the dirty plate... and then he never came back with a new one! I had to wait until the pizza came (the person who brought the pizza out noticed I was missing a plate so he brought one). Ughhh, delaying my food experience. Not cooooool. Anyway, I'll give BJs some credit for food. I love BJs pizzas. They always come out delicious and I enjoy it. But I really have to dock them on the service."
Meg L.,"Anaheim, CA",111,55,16,4.0,10/15/2011,"Fiance and I love BJs. It took him a while to get in the dam restaurant, but now he loves it. Our favorite, HOT WING PIZZA (w/ no Onion)!  We've gone a couple times in the past few months for the 2 for $19.95 deal. Pretty sweat, we each get to choose soup/salad and then we share a Medium Pizza and then we get a Pazookie! BOMB.COM We usually get the Hot Wing Pizza and two drinks and the total is like $25/26! Not bad! =) Always easy place to come for a late lunch, but weekends and nights are NUTS! We've done Curbside a couple times in the past and that works well but (though they offer it) cant imagine having pazookie at home the same as at the restaurant!"
Brandon F.,"Westminster, CA",0,3,,5.0,4/27/2015,"I had a great experience at BJ's the other night and the staff was amazing which is one of the reasons I am going out of my way to write. Johnathon, our host, was more than great and our waitress was exceptional as well. We were definitely taken care of and the food was delicious on top of that!"
Grace S.,"La Mirada, CA",168,55,322,5.0,9/26/2009,"My two favorite entrees at BJ's are the Balsamic Glazed Chicken and New Orleans Jambalaya. I normally don't like chain restraints because there is never enough flavor in the food, but each dish is surprisingly oozing with flavor. The crispy friend onion strings on the Balsamic Glazed Chicken gives the dish a perfect balance of texture and flavor against the chicken and cheddar mashed potatoes while the Jambalaya doesn't skimp one bit on the spicy sauce or meat. I always wish the Jambalaya came with more rice because there is so much chicken, shrimp, and sausage on the plate. I usually manage to take part of the Jambalaya home and just add more rice later on and since there was so much flavor in the meat it still tastes great the next day. There is no way I can leave a BJ's without having a Pizookie, usually chocolate chunk for me, but they have white chocolate macadamia nut, peanut butter or oatmeal raisin walnut. It comes with two scoops of vanilla ice cream on top of the hot of the oven cookie. It's worth every extra calorie. I'll just have a smaller meal the next time. I've never done it, but this seems like a great place to just come have a beer with a group of friends. It's a very cozy atmosphere and the music isn't too loud to actually have a conversation with friends."
Justina R.,"Costa Mesa, CA",93,91,,3.0,12/1/2013,"BJ's is a good place for a group of people who want a variety of dishes.  I don't come here very often, but when I do, I know I will receive good, quick service and a delicious pizookie to finish my meal."
Linda L.,"Los Angeles, CA",134,121,317,1.0,11/28/2013,"Really not a fan, to laud, long wait, super sweet mixed drinks, nothing special. Not sure why people come here the food is very basic with little flavor. I had nachos and never again, bland with bucket of sour clean on top. Had hard time to have out waitress notice us when we asked for hot sauce to help the nacho situation."
Greg P.,"Fountain Valley, CA",0,1,,5.0,4/15/2015,"Came out tonight looking for great food and beer, at an affordable price, and BJ's delivered. Great service. Instantly was greeted by host and sat within 5 minutes. Server Jaelene was accommodating and very friendly. Even though it was close to closing time for the restaurant, the service and quality of food was beyond expectations. Been going to Bj's for a while now and will continue to!"
