Rashad M.,"Costa Mesa, CA",101,49,21,4.0,10/16/2011,Round up on the Pizzookie(s) - U'll thank me later. That's really all that needs to b said about this place!
Sitha I.,"Huntington Beach, CA",143,277,53,4.0,5/25/2013,"I love BJ's. It never disappoints. For a franchise, consistency is the key and every BJ's I've gone too has given me the same type of customer service and food quality. Love, love, love the calamari, wings are great as well. I'm obsessed with the tomato and mozzarella side salad with balsamic vinaigrette. All their pizzas are good and great for sharing. Dont pass on dessert. Their pazookie is to die for. Baked cookies, you can split the flavor, with scoops of vanilla ice cream. Yum!"
Chau N.,"Cypress, CA",228,448,69,4.0,9/8/2011,"Hands down BEST SPINACH & ARTICHOKE DIP! Love their pizzas, which are relatively large-portioned; love the starter appetizers, love the ahi poke, love their pizookies, and of course, LOVE THEIR BEER SELECTIONS. Just not luvin' the long waits during weekends, but oh so worth it for their pizookies :) !"
Lily A.,"Laguna Hills, CA",3,18,7,4.0,10/10/2013,"Ordered myself atlantic salmon which was really good! The sauce made it all perfect :) If you're a type of person who loves fish and creamy sauces then this is the dish for you!!! And oh, try one of their special martinis too. Tops off the whole entree."
Karen S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",4,6,,1.0,2/2/2014,"We called in to order at 1:36pm so we would be back home before the game... we were told 20 minutes.. we arrived and were informed that they were backed up. We got our cold food at 3:10 pm..EPIC FAIL... were informed by Ryan Mccomb, mgr on duty, we had to take our complaints to the general manager who was not on duty.. are you serious???"
Jennifer D.,"Garden Grove, CA",90,60,42,3.0,9/1/2011,"Food was alright. The appetizer that included everything (forgot the name) used to be good, but they seemed to have changed it.. Shrimp teriyaki wasn't too bad. Crispy chicken salad used to be good all the other times we went.  Service was ok at best. She seemed to have been in a rush to get rid of the tables that she was taking care of. She gave us our check just right after we got our food.. Kind of early, don't you? She even asked a different table if they needed a box even though they were clearly eating still. It wasn't even busy so I don't get why she was in a rush to get rid of us."
Lillian L.,"New York, NY",575,347,193,1.0,7/3/2009,"I came here only for my friend's birthday dinner party. I'll admit it - i don't like deep dish/thick crusted pizzas...  but that's not the main reason why i dislike this place. this place doesn't have any dish/food that appeals to me. the pizza quality is sloppy (""fresh basil"" does not look fresh at all...). and the pazookies are basically just a disgustingly over buttered/oily cookie with 2 scoops of ice cream on it. YOU CAN DO IT AT HOME FOR CHRISSAKE. it's not that hard. our waitress really sucked. everyone at the party agreed on that. she gave us attitude and avoided eye contact as much as possible. each time ive been her, i've never been given decent customer service."
Amanda R.,"Anaheim, CA",591,15,17,5.0,12/26/2013,We come here quite often. Normally in the day we come and sit at the bar to watch tv. The day manager is always nice and friendly and Every time we come we have a good experience! If you haven't tried the avacado egg rolls you definitely need to try them!
Michele R.,"Long Beach, CA",4,42,,2.0,8/31/2014,"Busy Saturday night, not enough servers and just mediocre food. The food came out at different times which is really a big no no. People go to dinner with each other so they can eat together AT THE SAME TIME...maybe I'm just too rigid!   The food was just fair. The cookie pie dessert did look yummy though."
Dana L.,"Fountain Valley, CA",0,92,39,4.0,2/23/2015,Great service the mediterranean pita tacos are so good . The beer is great. The kids menu is super good. Id stay away from the steaks though . Overall a great place to go.
Sherry S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",20,10,,5.0,5/20/2013,"One of our favorite go-to restaurants, food is great, service is great.  Flatbread pizzas are awesome, the avocado rolls are super and the Balsamic glazed chicken will never do you wrong!  Try the bi-zookie at least once, it's rich, but so good!"
Lan D.,"San Jose, CA",213,488,43,3.0,4/26/2011,"The best thing about BJ's - this or any other - is the Pizookie, a giant freshly baked cookie with ice cream on top in the shape of a pizza.  It's absolutely amazing and room must be made to make it part of your meal.   Regarding this particular branch, it is spacious and decent.  But I came in here on a Friday night around 8:30pm and the place was packed.  Would have had to wait an hour for a table for two.   Found seats at the bar but it was too loud to me and my friend to have a conversation so we left."
B L.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,63,4,3.0,10/16/2013,"Three stars for food, The food is good ... Especially the avocado egg rolls. The service was not good. It took a very long time for our server to even approach the table. It then took a very long time to get our drinks and food. Our  server never checked on us. I will come back for the egg rolls and beer but will not have the same server."
Ralph L.,"Long Beach, CA",285,404,144,3.0,6/9/2009,"I don't really know what the people below me are talking about, because the service was actually pretty good. However, the pizza needed some work. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love deep dish pizza and wouldn't mind eating it for the rest of my life if fat was no object. The spinach and artichoke pizza, though, tasted like ranch with some incidental pizza below it. Creamy to an absolute fault, it reminded me of watching people grudgingly eat ""salad"" -- under thick layers of fatty dressing and bacon bits. The menu promised lots of spinach, but we instead got more artichoke than spinach--also disappointing. It's really a shame, too, because the pizza crust is irresistibly crispy. The macadamia nut pizookie was predictably good, but a little too fatty. It would have tasted just as good, imo, with some leaner ingredients in the cookie dough. The small microbrew (they wouldn't serve me a pint and just brought a 12oz, huh?) was a decent take on the Lost Coast White Ale. Total came out to nearly $30 with tax and tip. (a little much, imo) Free parking validated at the garage. Beautiful walk down to the HB pier."
David T.,"Huntington Beach, CA",4,73,25,1.0,12/20/2014,"Well my wife and I don't get away from the kids and hectic life much but since it's my wifes 50 Bday we got a local hotel room and and her choice of a restaurant , she chose BJs so we wanted to beat the crowds and got there about 5 . We had no wait like I like told the attendant we were celebrating  my wife's Bday and a getaway from the Kids,. Our waiter took our orders and it went down hill from there. She got wine and i Ice tea . Well  asked for lemon which didn't come with it and no sugar  on the table.  After waiting a bit for dinner, remember we were early and it wasn't busy our burger ,came which would be great but we ordered  salads that came  after our burger , umm normally u eat the salad them ur dinner arrives. Our waiter offered to take the burger and keep it warm under the lamp while we enjoyed our salad, well  NO cuz then the bun would be mushy just please bring us some ketchup. Always found it cool that somehow ketchup at restaurants always seem to be fULL , guess not at BJs got a few funny noise squirts but very little stuff so had to wait and ask for more not to mentions n that my tea was dry so much of the time. Almost done with dinner when my wife says SOMETHINGS missing!! Hmm we ordered a bacon cheese burger but no cheese on the order, cheese make things just better, well we pointed this last error out to our server, he said he'd take care of it,, we watched as we had a great view of the front desk, he told the manager and she looked abit pissy  shrugged and he came back with a 2 dollar bill adjustment , and they ignored the birthday celebration we were doing , I was ready to just get the heck outta there but my wife approached the same manager that dealt with our waiter and told our story, she apologized and refunded our meal, with our few times out and away woulda been glad to have a memorable nice uneventful dinner instead, wasn't worth the time  for a substandard experience ,  we have been refunded but I post this to warn others as well as get the management to tune things up so others can have a better  dinning experience, had that manager came to our table when she first  learned about the problem this post would have been different, REMEMBER we saw our waiter tell u what had happened"
Chloe K.,"Huntington Beach, CA",30,172,9,3.0,7/18/2011,"Love their pzookies! Their food is good, the only thing bad about this specific one is they are slow most of the times.  One time I had lunch here with coworkers. Our 1 hour lunch turned to 1 and a half hour. Our waiter was a guy who we nicknamed jimmy neutron cuz of his hair. We would ask for things and he would be gone for a while. By the time we got our food, we had to ask for boxes to get back to work. It took him 15 mins to even come back with boxes and another 10 mins to get us the check. Since we were splitting the bill, we had to go up to the front and ask someone to break a $100 for us. She managed to apply the whole lunch to the $100.  WTF. We had to make her reapply the different amounts to our cards..."
Tracy F.,"Garden Grove, CA",0,31,3,2.0,2/9/2014,Service was very slow. They tried to cram our party of 6 into a corner booth that would fit 4... Not impressed.  Bummed since it was my sons birthday dinner.
Jill T.,"Huntington Beach, CA",35,90,139,4.0,8/21/2013,"Yep, Southwestern salad was wonderful, They have  BIG screen TV's if you want to watch the game."
Natalie R.,"Santa Ana, CA",33,61,14,4.0,7/7/2011,"I have to say I am a fan of the deep dish pizza. My husband and I went for his birthday and ordered the Mediterranean, which I felt was very good and well balanced.  I also like BJ's because I feel the vodka tonic is of a more generous size than a lot of the other chain restaurants and the beer is good too.  Our service was a little awkward but it was attentive."
Andrea K.,"Westminster, CA",3,41,4,4.0,10/31/2013,"We experienced EXCELLENT customer service at this BJ's on our most recent visit. It was a take out order, which had a slight issue. The girl who gave us our order was GREAT, she immediately brought the issue to her manager. The manager was awesome in the way he handled the minor issue and made it right. We left VERY HAPPY customers. I do have to comment on the 'Party for 2' deal. I've taken advantage of this deal 2 times this month...both times it seems like they skimp on the food. Most importantly, the Pizooki (sp?) was so thin...not like they normally are when we pay full price. Seems like they would save just a few pennies doing this, not worth a possibly unhappy customer. Anyway, I will be back...I love the Party for 2 deal!!"
