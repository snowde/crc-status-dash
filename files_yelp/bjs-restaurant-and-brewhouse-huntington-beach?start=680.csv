Janice C.,"San Diego, CA",99,167,51,4.0,5/31/2013,Never disappointed me when I need a drink and steak and enjoy conversations with my homies.
Patrick S.,"Kailua, HI",2,44,,4.0,10/24/2013,"We really like this place! Very lively and it is a fun place! Food is good, especially, the sashimi appetizer! Pizzas' are good, too!"
Dee S.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",212,243,38,4.0,9/3/2012,I went out here for a date last night. This BJ's location is really nice. It's located in a really busy part of Huntington Beach. Lot of activity and fun place to go with friends just because of the location. BJ's in general is a wonderful restaurant so I had a great time. Order the chicken a la fresca with a blonde ale and you'll be good to go!
Elizabeth O.,"Long Beach, CA",0,30,,2.0,9/5/2013,"Really disappointing. Long story short, ordered the BJ's special, received it with the wrong crust, then received it with no sauce. The irony is that we asked for extra sauce. Maybe that got translated to zero sauce? Ended up leaving hungry and with nothing in hand. Wedge salad and tortilla soup were both edible but not amazing. We won't be back."
Brandon D.,"Fountain Valley, CA",0,5,,4.0,1/29/2014,Place has good food and great beer. Good place to go grab some pizza and beer with some friends
Kevin O.,"Mission Viejo, CA",7,7,5,1.0,10/21/2013,"I came to BJ's with my family and experienced extremely bad service from our server. Drinks not refilled, cold fries, my wifes salad did not arrive until 15 min after the rest of our food.  Then we were passed to another server. Had a Birthday to celebrate for one of my sons and they did bring him ice cream and cookie but no birthday song.  This is one of the few times in my life I left NO TIP!  Awful. Stick with the BJ's in Laguna Beach. Booooo!  Their service was scarier than Knotts Scary Farm."
Aaron F.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",215,424,,4.0,5/26/2011,"Over the years, I have been to at least 5 different B.J's. This place has the best service. For some reason, service is a huge negative factor for this franchise. The food is amazing but it seems to be a running theme at these places. I came here for a friends graduation from college at around 9:30pm with a party of about 10 people. After we were seated, service couldn't have been better. We were even paired with TWO servers for a period of time which made things go more quickly and efficiently. We were given plenty of service and was so impressed here. The food was, as always,as good as it gets. Be aware other B.J.s restaurants, take note of this place on how to properly give excellent customer service."
Joey L.,"Huntington Beach, CA",380,167,74,3.0,10/10/2010,"Happy hours at BJ is the place to be! Happy Hours are Monday thru Friday from 3-7pm. $1 off appetizers and draft beer at the bar and mini pizza specials. This location does get pretty jammed pack but I have always been extremely lucky enough to find an empty booth at the bar every single time. The bartenders work with you to get the best drinks made, and their food is awesome! I definitely recommend the following dishes: Appetizers *Sante Fe Rolls - The crispy spring rolls filled with tender chicken, fire-roasted red peppers, sweet corn, jalapenos and cheese served with a Santa Fe dressing and avocado cream sauce. Make sure to ask for extra sauce! *Chicken Wings - A pound of crispy, deep fried tender chicken wings drizzled with hot sauce. Finger licking good!   Main Dishes *Work Deep Dish Pizza - You got meatballs, pepperoni, Italian sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, black olives and seasoned tomatoes on top of a deep dish crust. Make sure you get a side of ranch. The pizza is extremely hearty and tasty! *Sante Fe Salad - The salad is topped with jack and cheddar cheese, avocado, corn, tomatoes with blackened chicken breast topped with Sante Fe dressing. The salad really complimented the pizza. Dessert *Pizookie - Freshly, baked Chocolate cookie topped with 2 scoops of vanilla bean ice cream. It's UNBELIEVABLE!! On Tap Depend on my mood and type of girl that I am into that day.  I recommend the Porter (dark and smooth), Jeremiah Red (Irish malts), or your typical Blonde. Please avoid the calories menu ....you might get a heart attack once you see all the calories count in all the dishes. See ya'll at Happy Hours!"
Anamarie T.,"Mission Viejo, CA",32,109,26,4.0,12/3/2013,"I like BJ's.  They have a great variety of foods.  They are known for the pizzas and the in house brewed beers.  The service always seems to be good here, although try to stay away from being seated next to the restrooms....The cover up perfumey smell travels to the dining room.  I like the BBQ chicken Pizza."
Jake C.,"Seal Beach, CA",22,23,1,1.0,10/6/2013,"Horrible. Wait time double what was promised, drinks took forever, apps took forever to come out and when they did there were receipt papers in the nachos. Completely unacceptable. I was apologized to but was reminded it was ""just a piece of paper"" . And as I'm writing this my whole table is waiting for a refill on drinks. I see so much of the staff pretty much twiddling their thumbs watching tv. Inexperienced staff in place with poor management. NEVER WILL COME BACK TO THIS LOCATION."
Cynthia J.,"Costa Mesa, CA",1023,368,57,4.0,6/4/2011,"I am not known to be known who enjoy thick crust, but I love the GREAT WHITE pizza. It is just good ! The cream sauce with tomatoes, cheese, and grilled chicken. It is definitely one of my favorite combos.  Another amazing item i love is the broc cheese soup ! OMG its so rich and creamy. Its probably one of the best bro cheese soup I have ever had. It is never watery ! Always consistant !  Service is ok, it just depends if they are super busy or not. You could probably make a reservation during the busy times or you can be  waiting awhile.  Oh and definitely pretty good happy hour specials ! Half off beers and such ! Come to think about it... probably the best time to come for pretty good food at a discount !"
Anna V.,"Franklin, TN",0,8,2,3.0,2/19/2014,"I am a frequent BJ's visitor at the San Diego location, so when driving home from a trip to LA (very hungry) I knew I'd be stopping at a reliable place! Overall the food was good per usual, but the service was slow and inattentive . I also noticed that the table was grimy, as well as the silverware. Good food, mediocre service and place. At least I'm full now!"
Tamotsu I.,"Garden Grove, CA",554,11,4,4.0,9/20/2013,"Came in on a crowded Tuesday lunch, and service was superb. If only the silverware was cleaner. Over all 4.20"
Steve T.,"Orange County, CA",327,198,141,4.0,5/23/2011,"Usually on weekdays I would only eat 2 meals a day, while in between it would be a protein shake after the gym. One night it was already 8pm and I haven't had my 2nd meal so I decided to head to Bj's for a Small Meal. Spinach & Artichoke Dip: 4/5 Baked to perfection. Very Rich and Cheesy. The tri-color chips that accompany it was enough to finish the Dip. However you may want to hold off the salt, they sprinkle a little too much on ours. We literally had to shake off each one unless you love salt. Nutty Brunette Beer: 4/5 What's chips N dips without some house brewed beer right? This beer was dark and slightly bitter comparable to a New Castle. The price for the pitcher was $17.95 not easy on the wallet. However it comes out to be at least 4 1/2 pints of beer not too shabby when you put it that way. My friend just started drinking dark beer she the nutty. Red Velvet Pizookie: 4/5 If you have eaten at BJ's you know its not a complete visit without a chocolate chip pizookie. Well now they also offer a Red Velvet one. Its of course freshly baked when you order it. It taste like authentic red velvet flavor and the ice cream is good as ever. So a small meal here made me $30 lighter in the wallet... *****Note***** Parking is Horrible here, if you are planning to eat with a big group you should really look into carpooling. And if its a ""small"" meal you planning to eat dont bother wasting your time here. Luckily I found parking here on a Busy Thurs Night :)"
Richard T.,"Fountain Valley, CA",298,137,59,4.0,11/20/2010,"BJs has all around good food and good beer. It's popular for its brewed beers on tap and their Chicago-style deep dish pizzas, oh and their pizookies, but their other food is quite delectable as well.   Usually my buddies and I go for a late night happy hour which isn't much but every dollar saved helps avoid an overdraft fee. The happy hour starts at 10 and I think it's a dollar off beer and $2 off appetizers? I might be mistaken but like I said it isn't outstanding. However beware! It only applies to the people sitting in the bar area, so the HH doesn't apply everywhere else. That's how they get you! Anyway, I highly recommend the Beer Sampler that comes in 7, 8oz. glasses of beer ranging from the darkest beer to the lightest beer. Not only do you get to try the 7 different house beers on tap, but it always gets me a really good buzz. Trust me, I go out and I drink a lot, and usually its hard A, but whatever they do to the beer boy it sure tickles your brain.  I never really eat the pizza here only because I hate to eat heavy, so i stick with the appetizer menu instead but everything I've had on there is good. I recommend: -Chicken Wings: OMG sooo good! Crispy skin, juicy meat, perfectly seasoned.  -Spinach & Artichoke Dip: Cheesy Goodness, sensational flavors! -Nachos: Perfect for a small group of 3. Its huge and it comes with mounds of different toppings including beans, sour cream, ground meat, guacamole...I'm getting full just thinking about it.  -Tomato Mozzarella Salad: Wowwww its under the mini menu but its a really refreshing salad for only $2.95! Its a great starter before all the food and booze starts entering your system. -Cant decide? Then get the Appetizer Sampler Plate (I forget the legit name but its on the top) it comes with mozzarella sticks, avocado egg rolls, spinach and artichoke dip, santa fe spring rolls, etc. It's quite tasty.  I enjoy going here mainly because its a nice place to just chill with a couple of your buddies, sip on some beer, eat some food and chit chat about life's ongoing pleasures."
Vicky M.,"Garden Grove, CA",57,31,47,2.0,1/5/2014,"As a busy, working Mom, date nights are cherished and fleeting as the hubs works a lot!  Tonight, after sending our son back to school, we decided to go to dinner and a movie.  The movie was awesome, dinner was good but BJ's has a lot to learn about service! We arrived just before 7 PM and were immediately seated.  10 minutes later, our server acknowledged our arrival.  We ordered drinks and they arrived a few minutes later. (Good so far). We placed our dinner order.  (Way too dark to read the menus) Less than 10 minutes later our entre's, not our salads, arrived.  I informed the server that we were expecting our salads first to which he replied ""I'll put these under the warmer and get your salads"". I said, that is not going to happen.  We ordered fresh foods and I do not want ""warmer food"".  He said ""I'll talk to the manager"". I said No, bring our salads and remake our food.  He scurried off.  I pulled our waiter aside and explained to him what had happened...  Salads arrive, with no silverware, and less than half way through it, look what comes around the corner...the dinner!  Yup, you guessed it, straight from the warmer!!  To shorten this up: the hostess found her texting to be more important than bringing the water she promised, the waiter didn't come by for a while and after his 3rd trip past, brought the water, placed the order for dessert, but was prompt with the check!!!   As we sat watching, tables were unbussed, the man at the table next to us was served an improper burger, and another table went ignored! The food was great but for our first time in BJ's, we are unimpressed!!"
Bill B.,"Huntington Beach, CA",1,10,2,1.0,12/29/2013,Too many people serving table. Salads brought 1 minute before our meals had to hold salad plate to finish.  Waitress clueless had to ask for refills twice. One meal came 20 minutes late. Waitress said manager will come to table never came we saw manager go to wrong table and appologized.  We were rushed and hurried once meal came no won done eating waitress asked on 3 occasions do we need a box.  We ordered a bu zzookie for desert and was brought the check with out desert. I'm a local in H B and telling this restaurant management better think about service and training of employees. Thank you for a horrible experience.
Anita R.,"Huntington Beach, CA",56,39,12,2.0,1/21/2013,"I used to really enjoy going to BJs - the one on Beach Blvd in HB is very close to my house. But the last couple of visits have been very disappointing. The service has been seriously lacking - slow, messing up orders, bringing out the wrong dishes, and then they are cold. Recently, we had a large group of 16 and they simply forgot to seat us when the tables became available - seriously, they admitted to forgetting about us! I will still go for happy hour because I still love their Chocolada Martinis but it won't be a my go to place any longer."
Rebekah L.,"Garden Grove, CA",79,16,11,2.0,8/2/2013,"Normally I rave about Bj's Restaurant and Brew-house; amazing food, great beer, nice staff and cool atmosphere but this recent trip was a failure. I hadn't gone in months and so when the Fam wanted to go out for dinner I naturally suggested Bj's.  They hesitatingly made a reservation for my party of 8 (had to involve the manager) despite their automated system saying reservations were taken for parties of 7 or more.... If your system says 7 or more you need to accept 7 or more and not give me crap for it. Upon arrival ten minutes before our reservation time at 7pm we check in and got our buzzer. At 7:45 we were still waiting to be seated!!! what is the point of making a reservation if you make us wait over 45 minutes!! Terrible. The wait should be 15 minutes max. It took TWO complaints and a Manager to get our party seated. Once seated our sweet server took care of us. Unfortunately the food runners messed up the rest of the evening. They kept bringing out the wrong food (2X) and ended up taking my Mothers order to another table. The manager had to come over and apologize offered her a free soup or salad while the kitchen remade her food. The entire table had their dishes except her..... one thing after another man... I will say this the manager was quite amazing in fixing her staffs mistakes. She seemed genuine in her concern and fixed each issue as promptly as possible. It was the worst experience i have had at Bj's.  I truly hope this was just one bad night.."
Phooey L.,"Anaheim, CA",84,61,55,3.0,1/24/2015,"Came here for a quick dinner with my boyfriend. Parking wasn't an issue as it was prior the dinner rush. We sat and our waiter immediately asked for drinks and If we wanted to start with any appetizers. He came back additional 2 times asking if we were ready to order, didn't necessarily feel pushy but let us scan the menu. Boyfriend order a bacon cheeseburger and side salad and I got the avocado egg rolls and gourmet Mac n cheese. Salad arrived first and it was smaller than expected but the plus side it didn't arrive with tomatoes. Food arrived and my egg rolls were made with brown avocado and a hint of greener looking ones. Food overall tasted good just visually with the avocado egg rolls not particular please to see more brown than green. Server checked up on us periodically asked if we wanted a pazookie and we declined and he immediately handed us our bill and said no rush. For a not so busy night it felt like we being rushed as we finished dinner earlier than expected.  Mac n cheese made a great meal for lunch the next day top with some wedge fries :)"
