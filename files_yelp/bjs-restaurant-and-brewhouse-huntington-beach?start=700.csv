Bryan B.,"Huntington Beach, CA",8,10,1,5.0,11/27/2013,Had a great experience around lunch time last Sunday. The food was great and the guy serving us was even better. Will for sure be going back
Mike P.,"Irvine, CA",4,91,385,4.0,6/13/2013,"Food is quite good.  Very deep pizzas are surprisingly not greasy or heavy.  The pizooki deserts are mega delicious.  Burgers are quite good as well.  Bar is nice environment to relax and have a good quality beer (not BJ's beers, guest beers e.g. Green Flash IPA)."
Tyrell H.,"Bellflower, CA",6,3,1,1.0,1/18/2015,"I went there yesterday with a friend for lunch after shopping and it was pretty much bad from the time we walked in the door. We walked up and asked to be seated and the manager and the host were basically arguing about where to sit us. I'm guessing they didn't want to since they just assumed we wanted to be in the bar. We had to tell them both that we did not want to be seated in the bar. After their show we got seated the server was quick to bring the things we ordered but not to be found between. We waited a very long time to receive our food and when we got our plates. The rice on both out plates was hard aka Half Cooked. We didn't eat and we got our food to go. The server dropped off our check and disappeared we waited a few minutes then we just walked up and asked the manger if she could split out check for us because we were both paying with our cards. ... This evil woman rolled her eyes and iad okay  so I told her what was mine and what was my friends and she said oh no. I'll split it down the middle. That was not okay because I spent more money than my friend on purpose knowing I would pay for it. But she did not care. So then I asked her what we would each be paying and she says I don't know between 24 and 30 dollars. And I asked her the exact amount and she again rolled out her eyes and took out her phone to give us our totals then I take10$ out of my pocket and tell her to use that and charge my card for the rest. She gives my card and my cash to the server and told him she didn't know what the cash was and told him it was his tip and he walked away and she said ""is that all""  I never said anything to her while I was there because it would have been really ugly. I think what I asked for was pretty simple and I don't think the manager at this location is good for the company I have been eating at bjs for years and this was by far the worst. I could have gone to Denny's for that service I don't understand how we waited an hour and got terrible service and halfcooked food. Will not be returning to this location"
John M.,"Santa Ana, CA",61,338,130,3.0,9/12/2013,"Typical BJs. Food is above average but the tv situation in PHENOMENAL. If I was ranking on football game selection on Sundays my rank would bump up a star. I don't drink, so I don't want to go to a sports bar with a bunch of rowdy drinkers every Sunday. So, I watch football here every Sunday at the bar :)"
Cheryl P.,"La Quinta, CA",2,7,4,5.0,10/12/2014,Very responsive to those with food sensitivities. They have a chart with common allergens. Waitress communicated special order clearly to cook and food was tasty.
Brandon C.,"Costa Mesa, CA",6,57,34,4.0,7/8/2013,"Delicious lunch. Parmesan chicken sandwich was tasty and priced right. Nice atmosphere and comfortable seating. Also, come at 3pm for a great happy hour."
Caesar V.,"Midway City, CA",62,4,,3.0,11/2/2013,"I've always enjoyed the food here.  However I have to ding them on this particular review because I'm pretty sure they don't enforce the 'takeout/curbside service only' parking.  The past few times I've opted to do takeout, there were either empty cars or the number of folks at the takeout counter didn't match up to the number of cars parked in the spaces purportedly set aside for these particular  customers. I suppose I can cruise a bit more for parking,  but it gives me pause if I'm looking for takeout options, especially given my busy schedule and young family."
David S.,"Orcutt, CA",36,24,4,5.0,10/19/2012,"Being the flagship franchise hands down one of the best and most fun sports bar/eateries I have ever been in.   Wish I remember the name of the waiter, probably the best I ever had. Food is great and not overly priced and the beers, try the sampler as they brew their own. Avocado egg rolls are bomb and so are their pizzas. Great happy hour specials. I recommend Piranha, its my favorite beer. Lots of TVs with tons of sports, the atmosphere is great. We always make it a point to stop at BJs now when we are in the LA area, I love it."
James T.,"Orange County, CA",210,150,12,3.0,9/5/2010,"Screw happy hour, I come here AFTER HOURS to go FISHIN' in the huge pond out back! What's on the menu? Bass, catfish, and bluegills, but you'll want to catch-n-release."
Jeremiah S.,"Phoenix, AZ",17,125,11,4.0,11/12/2012,Excellent deep dish Pizza!!! We have always enjoyed the deep dish pizzas here. It would have been a 5 star but the call ahead for seating is BS. We showed up. No one else there. Told them about our call ahead seating and were told a 5 min wait. But the next three groups of people who did not use the call ahead were seated immediately. So in this case calling ahead put us behind the next 3 groups????
Dally D.,"Orange, CA",0,20,,1.0,7/1/2013,placed an order for pick up and BECKY the cashier was incredibly RUDE!! she was rude over the phone and when I picked up my order I should've complained but I'm not that type of person. I hope the manager or someone reads this and fires her. She looks like she hates her job and everyone that comes in.
Lu T.,"Huntington Beach, CA",326,270,89,3.0,6/30/2010,"This place gets 2 stars for having remarkably uninteresting bar food that is feloniously overpriced but I must award an extra star for a decent beer selection for a chain style restaurant. Foregoing my normal beer selection of pink-hued Berry Burst Cider (don't laugh, that shit is tasty. I don't care if it's a ""girls"" beer), I decided to have a 13% ABV French brew by the name of Belzebuth to affirm my manhood.  The brew had a slightly thick, syrupy, viscous character and a deep amber color with a subtle sweetness that I didn't expect. What a pleasant surprise! It didn't take long for the magical elixir to bring me to my happy place. We also got a free pizookie for my friend's birthday. Four guys sharing an ice cream topped cookie dessert was just adorable. Thank you BJ's for making us look like bigger pansies!"
Mary F.,"Garden Grove, CA",1,164,19,3.0,8/25/2013,"Pazookies are always the best here, and you can do half and half on the cookie option, which I didn't know until now! My grilled vegetable flatbread was ok, it could've used more vegetables and sauce. The veggie burger was juicy and well cooked. The service is average, it's like they forget to get everyone's drink order or too busy, it happened twice to us in a group of 8 ppl. But the beers are good and come very cold. It's a good place for a large group of ppl, but not to go just for dinner, long wait and pricey."
Sato I.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",60,38,3,2.0,4/7/2011,"It wasn't so much the food getting a 2 star rating, but it was more for the overall experience. I am going to be easy on our server because she was ""new"" but I am more disappointed with the way the manager handled, or should I say, didn't handle things.  To start, it took at least 30 mins before we got our lettuce wraps and then from there they screwed up 2 of the 3 entrees we ordered. The first screw up held up the rest of the order for the entire table for another 15 mins. We were there with a 1 year old so any delay is always cause for concern.  The manager came to talk to us but he wasn't really apologetic but sounded more like he was making excuses, although he did offer us free dessert. I rather have gotten a heart felt apology than a free dessert. The worst part about this whole thing was the the place wasn't even crowded!  The food was typical BJ food with typical BJ quality. Just extremely disappointed with the service."
Abigail M.,"Orange County, CA",0,51,,4.0,10/22/2013,"4 stars for service, 3 stars for food. Pizza needs more sauce. We ordered 2 for $20. Pizookie was really good."
Mr. F.,"Cerritos, CA",37,40,,5.0,2/22/2012,Best Bartender Ive ever had. Kameron was his name. He took care of my group like a real professional. This guy wont be B-tending for long...definate Management guy...if they are smart. Good Job BJs Ill be back if you keep hiring people like this. It feel good to know people genuinely appreciate your business.
Liz R.,"Long Beach, CA",128,218,24,4.0,1/6/2011,"BJ's is a chain restaurant/brewery, very similar to San Pedro Brewery, Rock Bottom, et al. The food is about the same stuff you'd find at Chili's and such, but isn't everything better with a freshly tapped homebrew beer? I didn't drink anything this time (this was sanctioned by my employer) but I will make sure to next time. Anyway the food was good, the avocado/cream cheese/eggroll appetizer was pretty amazing, and I had the turkey cobb salad sandwich which was pretty good and the turkey was freshly carved. The pizzas are huge and served in big raised pans, although I admit the deep dish crust was a little dry and disappointing. Crust is the base of a good pizza. I'd be back."
Ninja N.,"Orange County, CA",119,399,57,2.0,8/27/2012,"This place is great to catch a game and have a drink. This place gets packed quick and it seems like they don't always have enough people to help out. It took my friend 40 minutes to get his 2nd beer. Sad :( We asked for deep dish pizza, but were given thin crust. Pizza is pizza, but if you are going to indulge, you might as well go the whole nine yards right?? The service is super friendly, just a bit slow. Maybe in time they will get better??"
A. L.,"Santa Ana, CA",24,30,6,5.0,4/26/2013,Deliciousness in every bite of pizza and root beer on tap! Rewards card that is free and can earn you things like a free pizookie or a beer tasting dinner and merch! Plenty of TVs to watch the games! Service is always good though the wait sometimes is lengthy. Prices are reasonable. Where else will you find Chicago style deep dish pizza in OC? BJs is on my faves list. Parking is awful cause it is always full; I guess that is a good thing then? Anyway it is tasty.
Cherese R.,"Huntington Beach, CA",44,7,,1.0,6/2/2013,"Horrible service. Ordered take out online and they gave me a specific pick up time. I arrived at that time and still waited another 20 min for my food to be ready. Unacceptable. Correct pick up times and better service should be the focus here. Maybe a more considerate manager who apologizes instead of giving snarky excuses for why my food isn't ready at the time BJ's specified it would be on my online order. It's ok though I will no longer be coming to this restaurant, I have 20 more restaurants to pick from right next door."
