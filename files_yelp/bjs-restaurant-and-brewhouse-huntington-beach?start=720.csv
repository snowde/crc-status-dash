Arvind S.,"Champaign, IL",336,12,,4.0,7/28/2013,I came here with family and it was good. I ordered a California burger but it was whatever. My mom got pasta and she didn't like it and the sandwich they brought after was amazing. Also the manger came to check up on us when she returned her pasta.  The food was average but the service was great!
John N.,"Huntington Beach, CA",9,87,27,4.0,4/11/2012,There's a full bar here.  This is a great place for catching up with old friends.  Their food is pretty good.  I always try to fit in an order of root-beer float and avocado rolls. I don't consider this place high-end.  It's just a friendly place to meet up with friends and catch up.
Queen B.,"Santa Ana, CA",20,22,,4.0,3/7/2010,"I come to BJ's occassionally for happy hrs. or just lunch/dinner brunch w/ friends or family.  My favorite dish is the grilled chicken pasta. Very tasty!!! Creamy alfredo sauce w/ grilled chicken and steam broccoili. The BF tried the balsamic glazed chicken  which i took a bite of & it was actually yummy. There clam chowder and sourdough clam chowder soup is to die for!!!!! I've also tried the country fried steak which was tooo greasy!! One night my cousin and I had a late night snack and we went to BJ's just for the pizookie, we got the White Chocolate Macadamia Nut w/ vanilla ice cream on top which was delicious. The ice cream made it even better. Everytime I eat @ resturant I would be tooo full to get dessert but if you are still hungry and want dessert I would definitly recommend the pizookie."
Shawn C.,"Huntington Beach, CA",17,28,,2.0,4/16/2011,"The food and beer are good, but the service needs improvement. Of the times I've visited this BJ's, I've only had a few good experiences.  Other times:  - They didn't write down, and therefore lost our call-in reservation for a large party.  - The online order we placed was ignored (or went unnoticed) until minutes before the scheduled pick-up, causing a 30 minute delay. - They seated us in an area that wasn't assigned to a waiter or waitress, and therefore, we went unnoticed for 30 minutes.  When asking for the manager, it took them an additional 10 minutes to find the manager, and bring them to our table. Most of the problems seem to lie with the reception area.  Online orders, reservations, and seating -- all things they're responsible for -- are where this BJ's lacks."
Jaime E.,"Sacramento, CA",48,44,,4.0,6/8/2013,Been here several times. I wish I lived in Huntington Beach then I would be at this restaurant more often. Never have been disappointed with service. A bit better than Chili's Bar & Grill. All I have to say is I'll be coming soon...
Shay C.,"Garden Grove, CA",0,19,,1.0,11/29/2014,"GO FOR THE BREWSKI NOT THE FOOD.   I ordered a half sandwich which consisted of (at least) ham, turkey, cheese with a salad.  I opened the sandwich to apply mustard and was surprised to see ONE piece of ham that was no larger than my thumb nail!  Seriously - I shouldn't have looked.  The owner/management should be so embarrassed at the quality of such a serving. It also had a very small ""used""  piece of lettuce and two skinny pieces of tomato.  It was quite a site. Talked to the manager who was complacent and somewhat sarcastic. If you order a sandwich at this BJ's, best take a look between the slices BEFORE you dive in.  Horrible that they are cutting costs but not the prices.  I'll go to Macaroni Grille before I go to BJ's on Beach Blvd.  I'd rather spend money on an ""In- 'n-Out"" than for that leftover crap BJ's is selling.  BUYER BEWARE."
Melissa M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",29,5,2,1.0,6/6/2013,Used to be my favorite pizza. They're making it different now. I ate one bite and it was nasty.
Sharad G.,"Irvine, CA",6,22,19,1.0,3/30/2014,"So it was a Sunday evening and my parents wanted to take the family out for their 46th wedding anniversary.  I was the one to suggest BJ's.  Having been to BJ's plenty of times in Irvine, it has never disappointed me in the past.  In fact, the food was always good, the ambiance perfect, and the service top notch.  That's why it's difficult to write this review; but write it I must.  So we go there around 6:30.  We had called in and let them know about our party of 12.  They said no reservations, but would do the best they could for us.  We got there around 6:30 and were told by the manager that they would do their best to seat us within 10-15 minutes.  We were seated in 30, in the outside patio area.  Now, it was just starting to get cold, but they assured us that the heaters would keep us warm.  When we were first seated, I noticed that the heaters were not on.  I asked the waitress to please turn the heaters on as we had small children as well as older people in our party.  ""No problem, right away.""  Yeah, right.  So we ordered drinks, then our food.  After about 30 minutes of not getting our food, I called the waitress over and reminded her about the heaters again.  She acted surprised that they were not on and said she would immediately handle it.  The food finally came; we had pizza, pasta, burgers.. .  No complaints there.  The food was good - BJ's does it right.  But the service that night was not BJ's; at least not the one I knew.  Finally, I went inside to the nice girl who had taken our name and let her know the situation about the heater.  There was a nice guy with what seemed to be an Irish accent who came out and took care of getting the heaters on - at last!  The old folks were freezin' by then and so were very happy with the heat.  After we ate, we probably should have called it quits, but we decided to order to dessert. It was already 9 pm by now.  So we ordered a couple of pizookies; no big deal, right?  Shouldn't take too long.  The kids did have school the next day, but how long could it take?  35 minutes later, 5 minutes after I requested they cancel the pizookies, the waitress brings them out at last.  The kids were yawning and falling asleep, but their eyes lit up at the pizookies, so we let them enjoy and headed home around 10.  The worst thing was - and the waitress knew we were upset with the situation about the heaters and the entire wait - no apology, nothing.  Just ""Have a nice night.""  Very disappointing.  BJ's.  Really?  Never going back to this location again."
Sadia C.,"Fountain Valley, CA",296,321,100,5.0,4/10/2010,"Food: -I gave the 5 stars because they sprinkle magic in their pizookies.  I've had wannabe pizookies at other restaurants, but none compare to the ones here. A hot cookie in a plate with a scoop of ice cream----heaven :D. They have a bunch of pizookie flavors now, but original is best (chocolate chip pizookie with vanilla ice creams).  -Their deep dish pizza, my favorite item here. My favorites: the bbq chicken, the great white, and the buffalo. The crust is thick and soft. The toppings really good and they put lots of it on their pizzas.  - All their appetizers are good- the calamari is kind of chewy though. - Pastas are good. My favorite is the cajun pasta, it has tons of flavor. - Really good strawberry lemonade. - The wedge cut fries here are super good! nice seasoning. Prices are reasonable. Service here is always really good. Expect a wait on the weekend because this place gets busy."
Allison B.,"Torrance, CA",3,17,,5.0,4/17/2012,totally rad spot to catch the game with friends and get a mini pizza! Especially at the bar when its *happy* hour! Blonde beers are delish and the bartenders are always upbeat and super kool. I will be back very soon ;)
Anne N.,"Irvine, CA",59,54,54,4.0,4/7/2012,"I love the buffalo chicken pizza, its a must if you haven't tried it. The root beer is really good here too."
Amy S.,"Seal Beach, CA",2,18,5,4.0,2/4/2013,I have stopped in many times but my last visit on Friday was very different. Our waitress was very knowledgeable and personable. We then had a chance to talk to the manager Steven who gave us some great insight on the brewery and others we will be visiting. Just had great conversation with the staff. Our food as always is great. From the pizza to the wings and the chicken noodle soup. It was nice to have good food and good staff serving us. See you all again soon.
Vince F.,"Fountain Valley, CA",184,149,61,4.0,3/12/2010,"Deep dish pizzas and pizookie are the best. What can I say. BJ's is legit. They have great deep dish pizzas - every time I go here, I try to order something different, but I end up wishing that I just got a nice pizza with some ranch dipping sauce. I like their selection of their own beers, especially the harvest hefeweizen. I kind of wish they had other beers like Blue Moon or something, but I understand that they got their own thing going on.  What I look forward to each time I go here isn't the beer or the pizza, but the effing pizookies. mmm, a big ol chocolate chip cookie with ice cream on it. Trying to eat it quickly while the cookie is still warm and the ice cream isn't melted yet. I always get tired of it after half the cookie, but man, my mouth is watering right now just thinking of it.  I really like this restaurant and the wait has never been much of an issue, but I can't give it five stars because I like Yard House a little more. Especially the Fashion Island location.  But another upside is that I've been to a wedding rehearsal party and an engagement party here and they do a really good job bringing out pizzas and closing of a section of the restaurant for us. It's intimate enough and I like having BJs pizza served buffet style. It's nice being able to taste all the different flavors, but the barbeque chicken is totally my favorite. quick update: last time I went, I took a look at their extensive list of Belgian beers. Dude, Chimay Red is one of the raddest beers ever. Try it."
Valerie K.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,,4.0,9/9/2013,"BJs is a great place to go when it is a group outing. Decent food and always something exciting for any kids in your group from the desserts to coloring sheets to the kids menu. They have a great selection of beers and margaritas for adults as well. While I have had a couple bad servers over my many outings, overall, I have been satisfied and have never been disappointed with the food or drinks."
Hideki K.,"New York, NY",466,1079,310,4.0,3/24/2010,"Review Based Solely on the BJ's Pizookies.   My SoCal friends took me to BJ's (at the recommendation of SoCal dining scene expert Dennis H.) to try their famous Pizookies!   We tried one of each:  - Regular (named BJ's Famous Pizzokie), which is vanilla ice cream with chocolate chip (chunk) cookie dough option  - Triple chocolate, dark choco ice cream, on choco cookie dough, with a Ghirardelli's dark chocolate  - Cookies 'N' Cream, Oreo cookie, with vanilla bean ice cream, and cream on top   The regular was by far my favorite.  I would return to BJ's just for that.   For more info on their desserts, check out:   BJ's brews were good, as was the pear cider (very good)! They are also known for their deep dish pizzas.  I would need to try it next time.  The wait here can get ridiculous, so be prepared.  There are numerous BJ's in SoCal, so if you don't want to wait, try a less popular location."
Dee N.,"Fountain Valley, CA",1049,428,85,4.0,1/30/2010,"4.5 Stars. Would have shamelessly given them 5 stars if not for the fact that service was lacking. My friends and I had the avocado eggrolls (YUM) and white pizza. (It's basically a chicken alfredo pizza.) The eggrolls were STUFFED with avocado, so you definitely get what you pay for! And of course, the pizza lived up to all of the hype. The crust was amazingly deep, the pizza was loaded with cheese and toppings--each of us got through 1.5 slice before we tapped out. This location has pretty much been my go-to place for deep dish pizza ever since. ^_^"
Jorge T.,"Downey, CA",1,8,5,5.0,10/19/2013,So I wanted to try this b_j's. It's a new b_j's and I wanted to try it out and check it out see how good this place is. I met my dad here we ordered a pitcher of Piranha. This beer is so dang good I got to get a mini keg of this. so we ordered the $20 deal and it was delicious. I got to say BJs is one of my favorites.
Kimmy L.,"Huntington Beach, CA",34,108,89,3.0,12/27/2009,"I come here occassionally with friends and it's really an all American brewery house. It's got American food with an exception of a few Asian dishes and it's not bad. It's not the best but when you're looking to hang or meet up friends, it's conveniently there. It's not my first choice but that is just a matter of preference.  In terms of food, I always enjoy a pazookie in my group and sometimes I really like ordering some hot fries etc. I'm mostly into the snacks and junk food that I feel go with beer. I've ordered a  sampler before with my friends but there is no preference or reference because I've had better.  But this place still keeps a good tradition of brewing their own beer. I really like that about them, so you can expect some good beer. They are also quite busy at night."
Vivian V.,"Fountain Valley, CA",54,35,,3.0,10/5/2013,"Came here yesterday to grab some drinks with a couple of my friends. We decided to try their specialties beer in which you can get 8 glass of your own choosing. Overall, I thought the drinks had some really gross aftertaste. The only one that I thought was good was the hopstorm."
Rebecca Z.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,19,1,2.0,6/30/2014,"My husband and I used to frequent this place quite often however we have stopped going as much because of the awful service that is offered here! We almost always order a BJ's Favorite Deep Dish which is always delicious and salads to start. We have ordered different entrees from the menu when we don't feel like pizza but the problem lies with our salads. Not once, not twice, not even three times, but FIVE different times, they have brought the salads and the pizza at the same time so our pizza sits there and gets cold, they bring the salads out approximately 2-3 minutes before our meal comes out so we have just started to eat our salads and then our food just sets there getting cold once again OR they have just forgotten our salads all together! I don't get it, how hard is it to make a salad?! I have spoken to the manager several different times about this problem and he or she almost always takes care of the bill or something on the bill but still, I came for a relaxing meal, i should not have to worry about rushing through my starter bc my meal is sitting there getting cold! In fact we went there last night, and we waited about fifteen minutes for our salads and about a minute after we got them our food came, so once again epic fail on the service. Get it together BJ's, the only reason why I give two stars is because I like their food! As we were leaving last night my husband said if we really want to eat at BJ's we will go to the one on Main St., it is just so in inconvenient because we live right around the corner from this location. I would not recommended this location to anyone! Ding Bats I tell you!"
