Ana T.,"Fountain Valley, CA",10,4,,5.0,3/27/2013,"My husband and I dined in just last night and just as anyone went in to have a good time. Normally I am not the type to write reviews but last night service was OUTSTANDING! Our server Brady who was training a new server, Bernadette where both AMAZING! Plus Brady's glasses were fun and cool. I was undecided on my selection of beer that night so they both had me try 3 beers before I made my final selection, never had I ever gotten that kind of service before. They were both very attentive through out our whole meal. We had a GREAT experience and left very stuffed but happy."
Alex T.,"Santa Ana, CA",113,8,47,4.0,1/25/2011,"Arrived around 5ish pm. It was a bit crowded with a 15-20 minute wait. Cool thing that happened was while I was waiting, the waitress brought samples of slices their deep dish pizza and let me tell you IT WAS DELISH!  Our server was nice and friendly no complaints. She did the usual check up and refilled frequently, so service was grand and she was pretty a were her fellow co-workers :) Upon ordering I started off with there big plate of chicken caesar salad ($12.95) which was good nothing fancy I mean you have to be culinarily uninclined to mess up a simple caesar salad. Next, I was tempted to order a deep dish pizza after my flavorful sample, but I was curious and my eyrs wandered the menu through and through and finally settled with a Cajun Shrimp Jambalaya. It was my first time eating jambalaya and it was a good first experience, however I wouldn't order it again only bcuz its not my style. Dont get me wrong it was a good size portion, they weren't sheisty with the shrimp and it had a nice kick to it, but I just thought it was ""ok"", nothing special.  My girlfriend, however, ordered the Chardonnay Shrimp Pasta. BOMB DIGGITY! Served on a huge plate so there is potential for leftovers as is the jambalaya. Also, they did not hold back on the shrimp. I'd recommend it. They sauce was supremely delectable and the chardonnay gave it a nice broth-type blend.  I would definitely order this second time around. Last but not least, where do I begin, oh yes, the PAZOOKIE!!! My mouth produces excess saliva just thinking about it. Hands down, thee best dessert I have ever had and will not hesitate to order even if I am super stuffed. TRY IT!  This place is great esp the location right across from the Bella Terra and other various shopping plazas."
michelle t.,"Garden Grove, CA",166,28,,5.0,9/16/2009,"I LOVE BJs!! How many times do you hear that in a day? Damn this place is really good. Never ever fails... the food comes out fast and the pizzas are all authentic, if thats even the right word for it. Anyway the staff here are really friendly and everyone looks welcoming. Nothing worse than stepping into an unfriendly restaurant where your appetite just goes down hill when you see that first smirk or snarl.  I highly suggest the lettuce wrap, bacon pineapple pizza, buffalo wings, lemonades (are yummy), and basically anything that sounds good on the menu u can be sure it'll be good in your mouth too. Man im really hungry again anyone down for Bjs ? ;)"
Alan T.,"Westminster, CA",182,225,38,4.0,1/3/2010,"Diverse menu with consistent quality, at least for me :) One time I got the pulled pork sandwich which was decent. had the pizza here a couple times and also got the blackened chicken sandwich. the food is a little bit on the greasy side. just a little heads up for you health freaks out there personally, i dont think you can fully enjoy this place to the fullest if you can't legally purchase alcohol haha  nothing would wash down a bite full of their pizza better than a mouthful of hearty beer! enjoy !"
Justin H.,"Corona, CA",19,32,20,5.0,1/9/2011,"I have been there twice since i have been in cali, there service is always great and the food is out of this world. if they had these in buffalo they would be huge..  love it out here..  if you have a chance go here and you will not be let down..."
Danielle P.,"Tustin, CA",11,36,2,5.0,11/6/2012,Best happy hour quality wise! 4-7. 10-close? Best. Ever.
Izzy F.,"Orange, CA",2,30,5,5.0,6/9/2014,"Emilio V is a five star server. What an amazing experience.  We came to grab a late dinner.  Let's just say , we are both servers at a different restaurant. Probably the most difficult people to impress. He had a great personality, and went above and beyond our expectations with our questions and menu needs. I have been here several times before - service was not great. This guy was a reason to return and give this place another chance.  Go Emilio!"
Frederick R.,"Garden Grove, CA",161,20,3,5.0,12/22/2012,Awesome food the buffalo chicken pizza is delish!  Awesome service. Great atmosphere. Just make sure you make reservations if you are coming on a busy night or be prepared to wait.
Jeffrey S.,"Los Angeles, CA",70,34,2,2.0,11/21/2011,"I'm giving this a two star rating not because of the food/service (both were fine) but because of the strange way our food was served to us. Keep in mind I'm the only person in my group who was freaked out by this and when I started laughing at the end of the meal everyone thought I was an asshole. There were 6 people in our party. My girlfriend, her mom, her moms boyfriend, her sister, her little brother and myself. Waitress came and took our drink orders and a little while later took our food orders. I asked for a mini pizza and a side of fries, girlfriend got some pasta with a side salad, her mom got some giant salad, her boyfriend got something that I cant remember and both of her sibling got small pizzas for themselves. About 20 minutes goes by and a small plate of fries is placed on the table. I know they're mine but nobody else seems to know that so now my side of fries has become an appetizer for the entire table. Another 10 minutes pass (fries are gone) and they bring my girlfriend her pasta. Another ten minutes pass and they bring her mom her giant salad. Anther 10 minutes and I get my pizza, another 10 minutes and moms boyfriend gets his food, another 10 minutes and my girlfriend gets her side salad. My girlfriend and her mom were both done with their meals before brother and sister even got their food. I'm finding this whole thing comical so I start to chuckle and point out the absurdity of it which is met with puzzled looks and a ""whats so weird about the service?"" from the mother. A little while later the sister gets her pizza and about 5 minutes after that the waitress brings the brothers pizza to the table and asks ""who had the bbq chicken pizza?"" and after the brother raises his hand and says ""me"" the waitress still served it to the sister (who had a whole pizza right in front of her). I let out a very audible chuckle and the waitress looks at me funny. So, now we're in an awkward moment because everyone is done with their meals except for my girlfriends brother and sister who have just started eating so we decide to order some desert to share so that they don't feel like we're all just staring at them while they eat. Waitress comes and takes our order (we got two pazookies) and I swear to god not 5 minutes later she brings us our bill and tells us to have a good day. Our pazookies are still like 15 minutes away from being out of the oven and we're already being shooed away from our table. I don't know if it was just a messed up kitchen, lack of staff or what but I was so amused by the whole thing that when the waitress dropped off our bill I was pretty much just laughing in her face uncontrollably.   the pazookies were delicious."
Michele H.,"Bradbury, CA",456,29,62,4.0,8/7/2012,Very crowded but found a seat in the Bar section. Lots of TV's and Great Happy Hour prices on Drinks and appetizers !!!   Food was Great as well as my Strawberry Margarita w/ xtra lime!!!
Drivingcrzy D.,"Huntington Beach, CA",13,29,18,4.0,10/14/2010,I have never had a bad experience when eating at BJ's. I think its the best pizza around in Huntington beach. I think everyone in the world has had a PIZOOKIE and knows its the best thing in the world. If you haven't had one yet just go to BJ's for a pizookie and you will be in heaven.  Cant wait to eat here again.
Husqvarna F.,"Whittier, CA",0,100,147,4.0,10/4/2012,"$20 for two dinner special comes with a medium pizza, 2 salads, and a desert. Long wait times at this location."
Eman S.,"Buena Park, CA",146,19,7,1.0,4/17/2014,"I love BJ's I really do, but this location is lacking. We walked in (a group of 3) and didn't even get greeted at all. When I went up to the hostess and asked for a table for 3 she said ok and out of nowhere a random lady walked by and said hi and apparently she was supposed to take us to our seats but she didn't even tell us to follow her or anything so we were standing around all confused. When we got seated we waited an entire 10 minutes until the waiter came up to us to take our order for our drinks. Thank goodness we were ready to order or else we would've been there all night! So this waiter comes back 15 minutes later with our drinks and no food. At this point my hungry side is coming out. We waited another 30 minutes until we smelled our food. Now that we had our food, my friend decided to ask for a side of ranch. The waiter (who we only saw like 3 times the whole time) nods his head and never comes back. So another 8 minutes pass by and another waiter walks by and we ask him for the side of ranch. I guess he also ignored us too. We were on our last slice of pizza when the ranch came out. It was such a slow and annoying experience that we decided not to order the pazookies and I love those things. After this terrible experience we talked to the manager who really did listen and feel bad and she took care of us. All in all I will never visit this location again, I'll go to other BJ's before I go to this one."
R C.,"Beverly Hills, CA",21,128,231,4.0,8/15/2012,"I like coming here for happy hour. They have the personal pizzas on special along w/ beer & wine deals too. I think Mondays wine is half off too! While I have been experimenting w/new flavors... My fav pizza is still the great white. It has Alfredo sauce w/cheese chicken, mushrooms & roasted tomatoes- Delish!!!"
Carlo S.,"Westminster, CA",0,6,,1.0,9/7/2014,"Poor service, lousy food.  We have been here several times for takeout and the ""people"" up front have always been rude or just plain indifferent."
Qwerty N.,"Huntington Beach, CA",292,135,3,4.0,10/26/2010,"Nice bar, great beer selections!!!! Food is ok, I usually go just for the beer."
Dirrrty D.,"Orange County, CA",2,20,3,4.0,2/13/2013,"Delicious pizza, delicious house beers, delicious pizookie desserts. Cool atmosphere and lots of flat screens around the bar with sports on. Try to call ahead, because this one always seems to be busy. I love BJ's!!"
Ivette C.,"Garden Grove, CA",53,2,1,5.0,1/24/2014,"Oh how i love this place!!!!!!  It s the best restaurant in town, good food, great service and a huge Tv where i can watch Football (: I love hapy hour, i can try all their food and drinks and BRunch  on the weekends ohhhhh so Amazing!!! I go to this pace at least 5 times a month. Always have a great experience here. I am in love with their buffalo chicken pizza and cadillac pink martini (;"
Lynda C.,"Laguna Hills, CA",0,16,3,3.0,8/26/2014,Thank you so much for getting back to me on the earlier review I posted regarding our visit last week.  I appreciate the time you took to listen and your resolution if our issues. It means a lot to have a manager who will listen!  Thanks again!
Greg R.,"Los Alamitos, CA",45,26,2,3.0,4/27/2014,"I'm not sure what's happened to this BJs but we had a bad experience too. Service was really slow and not sure why as it wasn't all that busy (4:00 Saturday afternoon) We ordered some flatbread & spring roll appetizers and watched it go by our table to the table behind us. Unbelievably the 4 at that table just laughed and ate it. Our server came by 30 minutes after we had ordered and I asked how the food was coming to see what kind of response we'd get. He came back saying it was taking longer than expected so I mentioned we saw it go to the other table (then admitted that was correct, not that we blamed him). Manager came over apologizing for the delay and comped us our new order which would be expected. I believe the expediter brought another order to this same table by mistake after ours too. Maybe they need to do more training. Food was good as well as the beers but they need to work on their service for sure. We will give them another try and see what happens next time."
