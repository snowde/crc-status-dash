Kim S.,"Hawaiian Gardens, CA",20,7,,1.0,9/27/2012,"Don't make reservations in advance. Even though the wait is short, you are dumped in the exterior patio with no A/C and no fans above your table while it is 91 degrees. Be prepared for excuses if you asked to be moved to a cooler area. We were told we would have to be placed on the waiting list again for about ""20 minutes"" until another table becomes available. The manager that came over was useless as he stood there without saying a word. Wouldn't you know it... 5 other tables were available. And if you ask for splenda  expect some generic sugar or the following response from your server ""I might possibly forget your splenda again, but if I do please remind me again"". WTF? I originally had 2 stars, but as our dinner went on, the service got worse. Food that wasn't ours was delivered to us, we were given no plates with our pizza, we had to repeatedly ask for the same refill at least 3 times, we had to ask for the same dirty dishes to be removed several times, the kids had to wait 12 minutes for their dipping sauces, the order was brought out wrong (even at the neighboring tables), we received thin crust pizza instead of hand tossed, the kids received their food about 10 minutes after the adults and we were asked to continuously serve others at the table because the server couldn't do it herself. This our second time here and I think it will be our last. We receive better service, atmosphere and food from Lazy Dog Cafe down the street."
Brian K.,"Anaheim, CA",103,246,404,4.0,4/30/2012,"Thick pan crust pizza with amazing flavor is served here at BJ's.  This place has one of a kind pizza and beer.  They have many great tasting brews on tap that are brewed in-house.  If you want a great pizza and beer in a fun atmosphere to hang out in, come to BJ's."
Andy N.,"Huntington Beach, CA",4832,1367,10567,4.0,4/15/2010,"Came here last night for some happy hour. Ordered a gang load of food. We ordered the best beginnings sampler platter which included the spinach artichoke dip, avocado egg rolls, santa fe spring rolls, and mozzarella sticks. We also ordered some flat bread pizza, buffalo chicken wings, pulled pork sliders, potato wedges, and some drinks. The bill came out to an amazing 61 dollars. The food is always good and the service is okay. It's always packed with people and good to catch up with local friends."
Lauren M.,"Irvine, CA",240,145,6,3.0,10/1/2009,"The quality of the food at BJ's is usually across the board the same no matter which location you go to. However the reason this location gets 3 out of 5 stars is because service is really hit or miss here. Sometimes it's really obvious that the local high school students are running the hostess stands and running the food. Other times my meal goes without a hitch and I'm left feeling satisfied and full. I've had some obnoxiously rude waitresses, and I've had some really attentive good waiters. I guess it really depends on who you get."
Larry D.,"Beverly Hills, CA",5,32,1,2.0,4/20/2014,curb side service:  cock-tooey!!!  told us it would take 15-20 min.  we waited 15-20 min at the house then left.  waited another 15-20 min curbside.  buyers beware!!!
Chialee L.,"Fountain Valley, CA",12,66,8,4.0,4/19/2010,"I like this place, I really do...and why? Because they have two of my favorite things: alcohol and dessert! Ha, not the obvious answer of pizza right?! Came here for a girlfriend's birthday dinner last week and started it off with a nice cool glass of Jeremiah Red.  Jeremiah Red has a great color, crisp taste and goes down smooth! I split a pizza (couldn't remember what kind, had too many Reds, haha) and a salad with my sister and I was good to go. Kept the beer flowing through to dessert which was a trifecta of pizookie!!! If you haven't had this, you gotta do it. Nice warm cookie all nice n' doughy under a scoop of ice cream. My one complaint? My spinach dip n' chips came with crumbs of chips! What's up with that?! How am I supposed to eat the dip with chip crumbs?! I was too friggin hungry to send it back, but really, at least send out full size chips with my dip next time, all right?! BTW - get there early, this place packs up fast!"
Holly C.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",135,382,11,4.0,5/29/2012,"great food, great location, good service, and reasonable prices. the BBQ chicken pizza is delicious - and of course, you can't leave without ordering a pizookie!"
Rob A.,"Orange County, CA",63,85,189,1.0,6/30/2009,"I always come here for a brew at least 2-3 times a month but last night i had the worst waitress ever!  I had a snake bit that was 80% pear cider, what kinda fucked up mix is that! Anyways, I didn't wanna be mean and have her dump it so i just drank it! My next drink was even worse than the first. I had a chocolate rasberry (pm porter and framboise) it was 1/6 foam!! @ this point i was fuckin pissed. The waitress was half assing all the drinks even mixed drinks! Ohh and one last thing, I ordered a sampler for a friend and that was also shit-e they were 1/4 foam all 7 of them!!!!  * AVOID THE SHORT BLOND HAIR CHICK( BECKHAM STYLE CUT ) SHE FUCKIN SUCKS!!!"
Elaine P.,"Hidden Hills, CA",0,27,2,1.0,6/19/2014,"My kids always want to come here for their birthdays just to get a pizooki, but it's always such a pain!! First, when I call ahead (many times!), the manager will NEVER give us a table for 10-12 people (what the heck?), then when we go there, there is always room...service is very slow and food mediocre!  Can't wait till they out grow this craving! :("
Nancy N.,"Westminster, CA",0,3,2,1.0,5/20/2014,"Can I give zero stars? Worst service ever. Went on my birthday and when we walked in we weren't greeted. They didn't pay any attention to us at all. When we got our table, we sat there for a good 20 or more minutes without being asked anything by our server. My brother complained about our TABLE, like the TABLE ITSELF, and the server over heard and spoke to her manager saying that we were saying something about HER and cursing at her...excuse me? There was no foul language even in the sentence he had said. The manager came to speak to us and he was being extremely rude and hostile to my brother, so we walked out. Fuck this place. Never going here again."
Alex J.,"Garden Grove, CA",44,13,1,5.0,4/19/2014,"The manager really saved the day. What I can only describe as a 50 min wait for our pizza's while watching everyone seated around us get there food even though they ordered after us. We actually watched a group order after us, get their food, finsh, pay, and leave.  I can only speculate that the waiter screwed up somehow. He stopped checking on us after the pizza's took so long. My group and I were about to leave when the manager came up and apologized for how long it took. She then said the order will be out in 3 minutes (it took 10). We asked our waiter for ranch took him 7 min (in that time we asked another waitress to get us ranch, took her 20 seconds). I don't know what was going on back there but the manager came through. She said the pizza's were on the house and gave us each 10 dollar gift cards. Which we used towards our bill (our bill would have been around 130-140) came out to about 3 bucks. Awesome right? Did I mention that most of the people in my group were very close to finishing their review on yelp when this manager fixed everything. So if corporate reads this that's down the street, the lady that was manager on 4/18/14 did a great job keeping 7 people from leaving pissed, never returning, and leaving several bad yelp reviews."
Welcome to the I.,"Huntington Beach, CA",39,88,146,3.0,9/14/2010,"Very busy establishment, the ditsy hostess tried to stuff us at the bar we told her we would wait and all of a sudden there's a booth open lol stop being  lazy and freakin do your job!!!  Food was good came here becuz ive been craving for a big loaded potato and their chicken potato was good my girl is happy with her tomato soup w/ salad but is disgruntaled about their dirty bathroom ;("
Steven H.,"Huntington Beach, CA",6,58,1,1.0,10/13/2013,"My girlfriend and I had dinner at the Huntington Beach location and I must say we were very disappointed, beginning with the service and continuing with the food.  We both ordered beer which when served over the railing next to us was spilled and my girlfriend was allowed to mop up before the server offered to help.  Why was my girlfriend allowed to clean the table for the servers spill?  We wanted the Party for Two but did not know all of the details and choices.  Sadly, the salad choices were not even mentioned.  The first two slices of pizza when arrived were barely warm however the second slices were much warmer indicating that the pizza was left to warm near a heat source for a while. I do recall also, that the first two slices during previous visits were served by a server.  Apparently this is not longer the case.  So there is not really much service at BJ's any more.  Obviously, this was a pizza made well before we ordered it.  Our salad plates were left at our table well after we had finished eating the salads and were not removed from our table until we were almost finished eating the pizza.  Finally, we felt as if we were being rushed to leave as we had ordered a special and would probably not want anything additional.  I do not understand the service and definitely do not understand why there was such a crowd waiting to be served by  a sub par staff serving sub par food.  Yes, I will not be returning anytime soon."
Ann P.,"Stanton, CA",120,27,55,4.0,11/23/2011,"This place is good to hang out, drink beers and have some appetizer.  I come here mostly for a glass of hef. and some chicken wings, and of course their desert, the bazooka. I really wouldn't recommend any of their lunch or dinner entre.  If you are craving pasta, i recommend olive garden."
Vi V.,"Westminster, CA",221,25,4,3.0,9/18/2011,Its BJ's  very standard american food. I love the BBQ CHOPPED CHICKEN SALAD. Thats pretty much all i get here.
Theresa F.,"Anaheim, CA",80,77,8,3.0,6/3/2009,"So I walk in ""wow are you ok"".... ummm yes you are by the beach... my hair is a little wet from the beach...  so we sit down can I get you anything  ""Yes umm coffee"" 10 min later... no drinks... Then ""can I take your order?"" The I ask ""what is good, this is my first time eatting here."" ""umm i guess the pizza is ok... its deep dish, everthing is ok..."" ugh I have never had a more monotone, dull waitress ever.  She also had 5 table and would go in a circle asking what everyone needed before going back to get it, I understand it probably saves her time but it was annoying waiting 10 minutes for anything we asked for. But the food was great, the pizzooki (sp?) was amazing. Service was slow, and dull."
KaThy T.,"Huntington Beach, CA",1194,1121,102,4.0,6/20/2011,"Came here with friends after taking a motorcycle course.  We ordered avocado egg rolls (was ok), spinach & artichoke dip (good), large BJ's favorite pizza (good), large bbq chicken pizza (good), a pitcher of tatonka beer (ok, a bit on the bitter side), and a pitcher of porter (this one was better than tatonka).  We also ordered a chocolate chip pazooki and go an oatmeal raisin pazooki.  Chocolate chip was waaay better.  We also received complimentary cups for Father's day.  Our waiter was awesome.  I don't think I ever caught his name, but he was a good waiter overall."
Madalynne T.,"Garden Grove, CA",1,7,2,1.0,6/2/2015,"WORST EXPERIENCE OF ALL TIMES.  A group of us usually go out and finish our night at BJ's usually this location.  This time around our black friend joined us. Never once have we had any problems with BJ's. UNTIL TONIGHT. So we have a few drinks and of course we're getting loud because it's a fucken restaurant. Everyone is trying to talk over each other. The MOD Oscar, turns to us and directs his attention to my friend and tells him to tune it down, and to cut it down on the eff bombs. Really dude? The audacity !! He didn't go to any other table. My friend ended up asking for the manager because the table next To us  said  what the fuck, is the manager serious, that was straight up racial. Only black guy at the restaurant might I add. We will never be coming back to this BJs location or giving BJ's any of our business.  But I have to say. The waitress was amazing. She shouldnt be penalized for such ignorance coming from a manager."
Kasey F.,"Lewisville, TX",309,407,361,4.0,3/21/2009,"This place is definitely one of my favorites. I've never ordered something I didn't like! The pizza, hamburgers, and pastas are all so delicious. And don't even get me started on the desserts...the pizookies are melt-in-your-mouth delicious. My favorite dish is the meatloaf sandwich because it's so unique. They serve it with BBQ sauce, vegetables, and garlic mashed potatoes. I can only ever finish half of it because the portions here are very generous. There's not much to complain about here. The food comes out quick, employees are friendly, prices are moderate, and the place is always spotlessly clean. The only reason it's not 5 stars for me is because there's always a really long wait to be seated. And by the way, if you're looking for somewhere to throw a party or bring  a big group, BJ's is perfect and very accomodating."
Natsuko N.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,37,1,3.0,2/24/2010,"I had the Balsamic Glazed Chicken and the Ultimate Cosmopolitan for drink.   I'm not sure if I liked the dish because it was delicious or because I was starving.  The service was kinda slow, but I can't blame them because there was a party of 15 sitting next to me (it shouldn't be an excuse ... but I know that when you're slammed, you're slammed.)    The dish was good, but not great.  It didn't give me the tingling feeling like you've met your love of your life ... but then again, this is BJ's ... don't expect much.   I don't know what made that cosmo the Ultimate Cosmo ... I sure the heck didn't feel ultimate.   Oh well ... I guess I won't order that anymore.   Come here first for the group experience and food second.  If you come here with good friends, that should make your experience here more memorable.  Because come next week, I will probably forget about what I ate here."
