Iris A.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,6,,2.0,7/26/2015,"We came here the evening of 7/25/2015. The food was good..the service was very bad..there were 10 of us and all of our food came of different times, with the last order coming when the nine of us were finished eating. We were entertaining relatives from out of town, they just happened to be the last to get their plates. We ordered our food, we ordered water several times, we ordered cocktails, we waited for our dirty dishes to be removed, we watch large parties around us come and go. My daughter had to go ask manager to at least bring my grandson his food so he could eat and calm down. My nephew finally went to the bar and got water and drinks. The manager was accomendating and apologetic when we expressed our concerns, but not to all of us. This was a very frustrating experience due to the unacceptable service. We were embarrassed for our out of town family. We wanted to give them a happy experience in Huntington Beach. It didnt happen. We will probably not come to this BJ Brewery ever again."
Jen K.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,9,,1.0,9/6/2014,"Horrid service at this location. I specifically told the waitress ""No Sauce and No Tomatoes"" when I ordered my pizza because I am allergic to them. The waitress said no problem and put in our order. After almost 40 minutes of waiting my pizza came out, with sauce (and cold). I called the waitress over and she said that they can't do pizza without sauce and it was ""only a little"" clearly this woman has no idea what an ALLERGY is. I saw nothing on the menu, nor on the BJ's website saying that you can't get a pizza without tomato sauce. As I clearly ordered my pizza without sauce she should have told me when I ordered so that I could pick something else. To add insult to injury she did not take the pizza off the bill despite the fact that I could not eat it. Our waitress was not only rude after the pizza was made wrong but she hardly checked on us and it took nearly a half hour to find her to order dessert (aka my dinner). Extremely disappointed, had I known that BJ's ""can't make"" pizza without tomato sauce I would have ordered something else, by the time our food came out I didn't feel like waiting for almost another hour to get something else."
Khatu N.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,3,,2.0,4/13/2014,"This was only my second time visiting but I'm not impressed. Unlike my first time, this had me shaking my head. Wait was long, food wasn't that great, and poor service.     When I ordered a broccoli cheddar soup, I found a hair. They got me a new one, but the shredded cheese on top was gone. It looked like they just scraped the hair off and served it to me again.      Someone came to apologize for the soup, I believe it was the manager, but he went to the table next to us. When they corrected him, he left. My boyfriend and I were there for at least 30 minutes, and not once did we see him again. He didn't even bother trying to find the right table to apologize!      I ordered a pizookie, hoping that BJ's would redeem itself. I was about to dig in until my boyfriend noticed there was a green on the back of my spoon, obviously from a previous meal. Really? You didn't even bother to check if my spoon was clean?      I'm not sure if I can even come back after that. The waiter was nice though, and is the only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars."
Joy R.,"Olympia, WA",3,15,,2.0,5/13/2014,"5 of us stopped at this BJ's for lunch & beverages today...very poor service. Our waiter, Dylan, was slow to bring everything. After waiting 20 min, my DIL finally got up and poured her own water. The meal, other beverages, & even the check equally as slow. The salad i wanted had pepitas. Dylan had mo idea what they were, ""never heard of them."" Even when he brought the salad, he still had not taken the initiative to find out. He said, ""they look like some kind of seed."" Ya think, genius?"
Christina P.,"Santa Ana, CA",97,51,7,4.0,2/27/2009,They have an awesome lunch menu.  I got half soup and half sandwich for 6.95 and boy was I full!! I haven't had their pizza which I heard was good but next time I will definitely try it. To top it off the Oreo Pizookie is to die for.  Not kidding I would murder someone just for a bite!  Our waiter was pretty nice.
John B.,"Huntington Beach, CA",15,200,1,4.0,4/2/2009,"Don't go to the one downtown. It's not as comfy. Reccomend:  1) Bj Burger w/cheese. Wedge Cut fries. 2) Sweet Pig Pizza, no tomato chunks. 3) Pizookie (doi!) I think this place is probably best for group dinners. and i think is open later than most restaurants.  (not to sound like THAT guy, but it helps that the waitresses aren't bad to look at.......most of the time.)"
josh c.,"Fountain Valley, CA",23,27,1,4.0,3/8/2009,"BJ lol this place was the only place that cut off me and my friends at 2pm. Can u believe it. Overall this place is pretty good place to watch sports games, eat dinner and drink.  Last few times i went i had a blast drinking, eating and watching football games. their pizza are deep dish but good!! Their beer is a little above average mostly becuz they had a imperial stout.  This place  gets crowded at night so come early or make a reservation if u go out at night. prices are decent for a restaurant. Bj pizza and brew house is a restaurant/sports bar expect a chill laid back atmosphere, deep dish pizza, and their many beers and drinks! Oh yea had their cheese burger pizza good stuff especially if your faded and Gerald chocolate bazooka really freaking goood!!!!"
Laura R.,"Orange County, CA",799,863,175,3.0,1/28/2009,"I used to really like BJ's ... but recently they've been letting me down. -During FB season, they didn't show any games except what was on the local channels.  Boo! -Last Night, I had a side salad that looked like it came straight out of a bag, and it wasn't even fresh.  It kinda grossed me out. -They messed up boyfriends order last night too. Those 3 things alone is not enough to keep me from coming here.  Their beers are awesome.  I love their blonde, pale ale, and nutty brunette.  5 stars for the beer! They do have a pretty decent happy hour.  And, the pizzas are good.  I like the great white the best. I just feel that recently, they've been going downhill.  The service and the food just isn't as good as it used to be."
Julie L.,"Fountain Valley, CA",140,62,3,3.0,12/28/2009,"There's a wide range of entrees to choose from. Not only entrees, appetizers, deserts, and drinks. The food is decent because you can't really mess up on sandwiches and burgers. The deep dish pizzas, however, are 4 stars :). Strawberry Lemonade.. do not get, it's way too sweet and shouldn't be served. The biggest downside of this restaurant for me? The wait time between drinks and meals. We waited for about 20 minutes for our food. That's a long wait! It was around 4 o clock and not busy at all. How long would it take for a full house?"
C T.,"Huntington Beach, CA",209,14,1,4.0,12/14/2010,"What's there to say about BJ's that really hasn't already been said?  It has the right mix of restaurant/bar/atmosphere that should have something for everyone. The bartenders pour a solid drink and they have everything you can want -- except Red Bull -- just had to mention that cuz a couple friends of mine like RBV :) Being a fan of craft beer I have to say BJ's beer is pretty good.  My top choice would be the Jeremiah Red.  It's quite smooth and very drinkable.  It goes well with the pizza.  Their pale ale is also very drinkable as are their other selections. I just recently tried their nachos and I have to say, I don't think I've had better nachos anywhere else.  They have your typical nacho toppings with the choice of meat (optional) but what makes these nachos a cut above, is they line the bottom of the dish with chili so when you think you've got nothing left because all the chips on top took all the goodness of the meat, cheese, jalapenos, etc then you get to what has become the best part of the nachos.  No more saving some toppings off other chips to extend to the empty, salty chip... hahahaha.  Plenty of chili to scoop up with those plain chips. Now to the pizza... theirs is quite good.  If you haven't tried the pizza I'd suggest you try the BJ's Favorite, it has many great great toppings that enhances what their pizza is all about.  If you're not into pizza the rest of the menu is diverse with plenty of strong options to really give even the pickiest of people something enticing to try. It gets crowded during peak hours so be prepared to wait to be seated.  Once your seated however, their service has always been real good, never have had any complaints.   It's a cool place to go and hang no matter what the occasion is to celebrate and they have the food and drink selection to make it a good night.  I'm a fan of BJ's and will continue to go back."
Alison B.,"Sunset Beach, CA",9,131,,4.0,2/8/2009,Great pizza- rich with great quality ingredients. If you want good deep dish pizza- come here- even my boyfiend from Chicago gave it a thumbs up. Love their local beer selections. The Porter and Hefeweizen are fabulous. Great atmosphere for groups or a first date. Their Pazookies are delicious. Deep dish chocolate cookie- baked in a pan and served warm with vanila bean ice cream. Ohh so good! I just hate waiting for so long- usually there is a wait on the weekends. Ugh- anoying. So get over it and enjoy a few beers.
Kira-Marie A.,"Long Beach, CA",105,11,,1.0,1/17/2011,"My boyfriend and I have been to many BJ's Restaurants ranging from so Cali to the Bay Area...and this BJ's by far was the worst one. When we walked in the door the hostess saw that I was there but took a few minutes to acknowledge me. We took a seat in the bar area. One server came and introduced herself  and got my boyfriend's drink while I went to the restroom. When I came back, it was a totally different server. When Kendra (our server) came and got my drink order, I asked for hot tea with extra lemon and honey and then she took our order. Once she was done taking our order she asked me ""you wanted hot tea with extra what?"" I said ""lemon"" and my boyfriend jumped in and said ""honey."" And her reply was ""That's how I always serve, but you want extra lemon and honey (with a little attitude.)""  After we placed our order, she asked if we wanted soup or salad, we both said yes. My boyfriend got his salad but I never got my soup. She never came back to check and see if we needed anything or missing anything, so I never had time to tell her my soup was missing, let alone I couldn't find her to tell her. As our food came out, she came by grabbed the salad plate from my boyfriend and didn't stay a few seconds to ask us if we needed anything else.  When she came to check on us while we were eating our entrees, as she was walking towards us I heard her say ""How's everything?"" Before I was done saying ""everything was OK,"" she already had her back turned and was walking away. At the end of our meal, she dropped off the check, while my boyfriend was eating, she said, ""oh let me take that out of your way (while my boyfriend was still eating the last bite.)""  I just want to say that I used to be a server for a few years, and that was the most HORRIBLE service that I have ever got. She was rude!!!! I usually leave more than an avg tip, but this time, I set my foot down and decided to leave her less than avg. I was very disappointed and was debating on leaving her anything at all. She's lucky I left her something. This was the first and last time I'm ever going to the BJ's in Huntington Beach. BS SERVICE.!!!!!"
Michelle M.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",631,943,154,2.0,10/28/2009,"I love the BJ's in Laguna Hills and Laguna Beach...I've always had wonderful experiences there....but what's up with this place?! It's just...meh. That's all. Came here last night with 2 of my friends after going to the Queen Mary Haunt thing. It was around 10pm and we were starving!!! Thank God BJ's is open til midnight during the week. We got seated right away....and waited and waited and waited....for--no joke--about 20 minutes until our server came out to check on us!!! WTF! In this 20 minutes we were freezing out little butts off....it was so cold!!  Since we had picked out what we wanted already (both drinks and food) the server took both orders. About 10 minutes later both drinks and food came out. Food was just meh...I've had better at the other locations. Drinks were decent though...I love their Blonde beer, tasty!!! I think the drink was the only thing good about this place.... The server never came out to check on us again, until he came out about 20 minutes later with 2 boxes and the check. This service was h-o-r-r-i-b-l-e!!!! And I'm a sucker for good service. What if we wanted more drinks (which we all wanted water--but no server in sight). What if we wanted some more food? No server in sight! Ugh!! The only 2 things worthy of the +2 stars for this place was good beer and a clean bathroom. That's it. Go to other BJ's instead...."
Nicole R.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,2,,5.0,10/11/2012,"I really really really love this place! Yes, I've had my one or two not-so-perfect dining experiences here, however nobody is perfect, and I am the first one to give people second chances! I dined here today (10/11) for lunch today & had the most wonderful, sweet server, Jordan S. She was attentive, cheerful, and genuinely nice throughout the entire meal. I encountered a lovely bubbly manager (Ally, i think) and was overall impressed with everyone that served me. Glad to say that I will be going back very soon!"
DAVID T.,"Huntington Beach, CA",6,203,,5.0,3/27/2010,"Great Chicago style deep dish pizza, great service, great atmosphere and good prices. Their desserts were great as well. Free Pazookie dessert on your birthday. Beer and pizza, what more can you ask for."
Makoli D.,"Orange County, CA",11,86,57,3.0,1/27/2012,Mushroom lovers: you must try their new portobello mushroom pizza!!! A combination of portobello & regular mushrooms with caramelized onions tossed in sweet balsamic vinaigrette. TO DIE FOR!! I gave them 3 stars because their service was so-so.
Brandon S.,"Los Angeles, CA",2050,1180,54,3.0,9/13/2009,"The food is good.  I had the onion straws for an appetizer.  They were quite good.  For my meal I had a buffalo chicken pizza.  It was very good.  The crust is tasty.  For desert I had a peanut butter pizookie.  It is a cookie cooked in an individual tin with ice cream on top.  It was fantastic.  I really wanted to give this place 4 stars, but the service prevented that.  My friend and i often had to flag down someone after our drinks were empty for long periods of time.  One bartender sat and talked to her friends for nearly 20 minutes while not helping a single person at a full bar.  A few times the bar back took our empty glasses without bothering to tell the bartender or remedy the solution his self.  I will go back in hopes that the bad service was a fluke."
Aaron D.,"Anaheim, CA",421,415,27,3.0,2/11/2009,"This location of BJ's really deserves 3.5 stars but Yelp does not allow that type of leeway. This is a very small BJ's. Very tightly packed - hard to move around. Difficult for the servers to get to where they are going.  Patio dining is lovely here though. Due to zoning in Huntington Beach the staff here claims to not have the ability to serve large beers out on the patio. This is a big pain in the ass considering they are a brewery restaurant. If its actually the case - then they need to apply for a variance.  As for BJ's - I often avoid going there because I don't really like any of their appetizers. They are not awful they just also are not great. They need to work on more variety in the menu and on adding some complexity to their recipes. Most bars can make the appetizers they are offering. The Lettuce wraps are pretty good. If you eat meat then the Angus sliders are ok. But, in general: the appetizers are not great. Appetizers don't make a restaurant; but if your a brewery you better work on your appetizers or people will eventually quit dropping in for a beer.  As for the beer - I really enjoy the refreshing quality and flavor of the Brew house Blonde and the two varieties of Pale Ale. The Heif  at BJ's however has a nasty aftertaste. The Jeremiah red is fantastic. And the freshly brewed Root beer is worth trying. Its also delicious with ice cream as a dessert.  On to Entrees. The Salmon is not very good. It could be that its because its farmed and from the Atlantic. Unfortunately many restaurants have not learned that cheap, farmed, crappy, Atlantic Salmon is not every going to taste elegant or amazing. Its going to taste like cheap, farmed, atlantic Salmon. The clam chowder is pretty tasty. They don't always consistently deliver it hot but when they do its wonderful.  The Chardonnay Shrimp Pasta is delicious. They sometimes bring it out with some nasty bacon on top but other times they don't. And some people probably prefer some bacon on their pasta. But, the sauce is fantastic on it. The Jambalaya is pretty tasty here too.  They have a fantastic pazookie. Its a giant cookie with a nice scoop of ice cream served right in the middle of it. Its really a bit much for me but there is nothing wrong with that.  So, overall I would say BJ's in general is ok. But, this location is very small and always crowded.  The Upside is that this place is great for sitting on the patio and people watching. You cant order large beers out on the patio though and they need to do something about it."
Lisa N.,"San Clemente, CA",332,144,168,4.0,3/17/2009,"Grade: B+ Why does pizza have to taste so darn good? Terrible for the waistline, yummy for the tummy.  We usually order the BJ's supreme, appetizers (bruschetta, spinach artichoke dip or the avocado rolls though not all at the same time!) or green salad, beer and sometimes the pazookie. BJ's pizza is very tasty but also very heavy. Since they are deep dish, the pizzas are usually very filling.  The appetizers are good starters too. My husband also likes the sliders. Since it is hard to avoid eating carbs at a pizza restaurant, be prepared to be super full. When we aren't in the mood for pizza, we also like their sandwiches. The club sandwich is actually very good. The pazookie is much too sweet, but i usually just have a few bites with ice cream and I'm good. You can call ahead of time to reserve a place in line, plus you can order to go. The only thing about ordering to go is that you can't mix and match your beer. :)"
Joyce D.,"Santa Ana, CA",35,50,12,5.0,3/11/2009,"Happy hour anyone!?  Totally there. $2 off of appetizers and half off of pizza.  Stuff I love: Santa Fe Spring Rolls, Great White Pizza, Potato Wedge, Root Beer, BBQ Chicken Salad. All good! I rarely alter from these staples. They're clam chowder is good too if you're in the mood for it. I don't normally drink, but when I do, it's Bailey's and soda. The bartender has never made it before and I was really surprised when he actually asked me how to make it instead of just saying no. Left him a big tip for that. =D OH! and don't forget the half and half Pizookie. Oreo and chocolate chip. With an extra scope of Vanilla Bean Ice Cream."
