Ruth T.,"Downey, CA",995,640,1490,1.0,7/20/2016,"This particular BJ's location was just not on its game during lunch hour. I'll just make a list of all the pros and cons: CONS: - Service was abysmal for us. Took almost an hour for the entire process of ordering and receiving our food. We literally saw a group who arrived after us get food before we did. - Refills? Forget about it. - MEAT LOVER'S PIADINA: Don't bother, this is a fancy Hot Pocket that tastes only a little better. - BAT GRILLED CHEESE: Somehow they messed up on the ""grilled"" part, because the cheese was still unmelted.  - We ordered different fries and they arrived on the wrong plates. - Root of Evil Ginger IPA was pretty bad PROS: - We went when they were offering BOGO entrees so at least we didn't have to pay full price for their crappy lunch specials. Ended up paying about how much they were each worth anyway.  - Nice building I don't typically feel so strongly about BJ's, but this one left me with a bad taste in my mouth. ... ... That's what she said? Food: 2, Service: 1, Environment: 4 Price: 2"
Angel V.,"Santa Ana, CA",1,14,9,1.0,3/6/2017,"The food was okay, but the reason for only one star is because of the bad service. This one goes out to the waiter Jordan, who seemed to not care about his job. My boyfriend ordered the Strawberry Splash, but a minute later decided to get a Bud Lite instead. We told the waiter to change our order and he rolled his eyes and walked away to tell the bartender. When he came back, I apologized for any inconvenience. He seemed to ignore me and ask if we needed anything else. Placed an order for pizza and the pizookie trio.  Anyways, skip to the point, he seemed to not want to serve us anymore so he had a different waitress take care of our table from that point on. He didn't even have the decency to notify us of this change. Rude, to say the least. Our new waitress was Ashley and she was wonderful. She had amazing service. However, Jordan did not smile at all when he took our orders. He definitely has a low patience tolerance. He walked past our table multiple times and did not say a single word after that. Sorry Jordan, but I don't think I'll be returning because of your inattentive service. It's really unprofessional to pass a table on to another server just because you're annoyed. Learn customer service."
Erica H.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,9,,1.0,12/4/2017,"Really bland, unappetizing food. I couldn't figure out why the restaurant was so full of customers. Bad food, small portions and high prices. We had terrible service, and food that tasted like it came out of a can. So many better options in Huntington Beach. No reason to return."
Alicia O.,"Lynwood, CA",213,216,188,5.0,8/24/2016,"Okay so I've been to my fair share of BJ's restaurants. I love their beer and food. Its good, fast, and service is usually friendly.  But on Monday night was the best service I have ever gotten. I had re-fills before even realizing that I needed one. Food was out before I started wondering about it. And the waiter was friendly, but not clingy.  Might be one of my favorite BJ's out of their chain."
Harambe L.,"Westside Costa Mesa, Costa Mesa, CA",0,2,,1.0,9/19/2017,Shitty wok service. Was next in line and these clowns had the audacity to let these group go ahead of us who just walked in. You couldn't pay me to come back here.
Thao P.,"Garden Grove, CA",41,33,51,1.0,3/20/2017,Paid $7.49 for a bowl of clam chowder to go.  Got half a cup container worth of chowder. Shame on you BJ's. Make sure you open all your containers when you order to go.
Holly W.,"Long Beach, CA",7,126,34,1.0,4/10/2017,"This place is always the worst, it's like the employees don't even care. I have repeatedly tried to give it more chances.  I have twice ordered takeout and was disappointed by the quality of the pizza. Once it was burned with hardly any cheese and the other time the two identical types pies we ordered came out totally differently and the dough took on the texture of a sponge. Another time we dined in and received the wrong pizza entirely.  This visit I came long after the lunch rush and the host said I could sit at any of the open tables they all turned out to be dirty. Where was the server? Apparently he would rather lean against a counter on the corner and wait for the host to take care of the dirty tables....sigh I just expect more from BJ's it must just be this location"
Michael L.,"Westminster, CA",15,49,3,3.0,8/17/2017,"Food quality has been on the rise at BJ's and they have impressed me on my last 3 trips here. Get the prime rib deal on the weekends! Friday and Saturday after 4pm, Sunday all day. Now, for the pitfall. I feel that the service has been lacking recently. Maybe they got too many orders last night since it was $10 burger night, but we were seated at about 7:30 last night and we didn't drinks for about 10 minutes and then food was another 35 after that.  Burgers were delicious, I had the mahi mahi tacos, I would not recommend as the tortillas were kind of hard and not much fish was in them. My primary complaint though is that in my salsa was a label from either a towel or clothing as it said ""100% cotton"" very clearly. The waiter apologized, took it, and replaced my salsa, but that was it.  We also had a coupon for $10 off of $35, it was a good thing we checked the bill as it was not applied the first time the bill was brought. Good food, but I think some procedures and training may need to be updated."
Auntie R.,"Riverside, CA",35,3,4,3.0,5/1/2017,"So. BJ's was one of my favorite places to go to on our Friday (Date Night).  I enjoy the parmesan crusted chicken. Yum. BUT last night I got it and it did not have any Chardonnay sauce on it. I told the waiter and he said ""yes it does, do you want extra?"". I said yes. So I put it on the piece on the left. As you can see the one on the right, DOES NOT have any. So for the first time. I was disappointed. And instead of complaining. I just brought it home and put it in the fridge"
SL S.,"Rosemead, CA",0,107,4,2.0,10/22/2017,"came here and sat at the bar.  Very comfortable sitting arrangement where you can watch the main room and the TVs while you eat.  Ordered wine and was disappointed with dirty wine glasses.  I asked for another glass and the female server got annoyed with me because I asked.  I showed her the dirty glass.  She said they didn't have enough wine glasses, really?  Also, I ordered their pasta with shrimp and asparagus (I think it was).  Price was $17 for a regular size bowl.  For $17 I was expecting a bigger bowl or plate.  I love the atmosphere at this BJ's.  Not sure if I just ordered the wrong things and/or sat at the wrong place.  I may come back but will not sit at the bar.  And, definitely not order wine since BJ's is mainly a beer joint.  Will get a menu way in advance and research which items are best."
Dennis G.,"Orange, CA",70,95,62,3.0,2/13/2017,"Came here on a Friday night to grab a something to eat and a couple drinks. Overall the service was pretty good and the food was okay. My wife ordered the hot boneless wings and they were honestly pretty gross. I ordered a BLT and I thought it was pretty good. We then ordered desert, we ended up getting the color trio which was our favorite part! These cookies were awesome and everyone at the table was taking bites!"
Lisa M.,"Anaheim, CA",21,3,,1.0,9/4/2017,"DO NOT ORDER TAKE OUT FROM THIS LOCATION!!!!! My family ordered take out using the app and was in the restaurant before the pickup time. When we got into the car I ate a few sweet potato fries and they were cold as ice, greasy with big chunks of whatever is in the bottom of the fryer.  We were already almost home (5 minutes away) and my husband did not want to go back for fresh fries. When we got home our food was ice cold, slimy, and old. It had been prepared long before we arrived. My son's chicken pasta was congealed cold goo. My chicken sandwich was cold and gross. The bread was soggy and the avocado was brown-tinged slime. I had to throw my dinner away.My husband had the Ahi salad, which was fine and clam chowder. The chowder was medium warmth because it was in an insulated cup.  I can not believe the level of disrespect that BJ's show customers who take out food because they know we can not ""send it back to the kitchen"".  This dinner was a waste of $50.00"
Tracey T.,"Huntington Beach, CA",4,67,83,5.0,2/3/2017,"I'm going to cut to the chase with this review. The prime rib was AWESOMENESS!! When you try it, you'll understand why I had to capitalize the adjective. The prime rib was perfectly seasoned, tender, and cooked to perfection. I was leery of getting prime rib at BJ's, boy am I glad I did. Everything else faded away once I tasted that piece of nirvana on my plate. The portion was generous as well. Well done, BJ's, well done!"
Dino M.,"Santa Ana, CA",4,70,40,4.0,2/26/2017,"Betty Burst Cider rules! It's delicious and perfect treat anytime of the day.  I have visited BJ's many times and particularly this location. It's considered a Corporate store as Corp. is around he corner.  I only eat/drink at the bar.  8 out of 10 times the service is good but every now and then you have lazy staff and lack luster service.  Pros: Normally we eat off the Gluten free menu.  Great pizza  Good salads  Good soups Often times our server will be happy to help us out. Sometimes, they are put out. One visit in particular they handed us copies of paper with most allergy information missing :/  This last visit on 1/21/17 the staff was great but the managers were lack luster and set a really low standard for customer service. I went to compliment our bartender and they both stared at me as if I was crazy and bothersome. They could careless.  So here's to a usually good restaurant with descent staff and unusually awesome staff every now and then.  Cons  Meh mixed drinks - often overpriced and weak Menus are often sticky"
Micah L.,"Henderson, NV",44,232,1926,3.0,7/21/2017,"I have been going to this spot for quite a few years and they could do better. Usually I hit up the location on main st in HB, but every now and then I visit here while on beach blvd. BJ's as a restaurant is great, it offers a large variety of  dishes that are quite tasty. You add some delicious gourmet beer (Jeremiah Red) and a pazookie for dessert and you got yourself a hellofa place to eat. Where this place falls short is the wait times. Last time I visited it felt like forever to get our dish, drinks refilled and such. It was shame because it wasn't crowded at all and there really was no need for a delay. Perhaps there was, but we were not informed one way or another from our server or even apologized to that it took so long. When I used to live in the area, many years ago this place was spot on with quick service. Wish they could kick it into high gear a bit for their hungry customers."
Tessa C.,"Anaheim, CA",19,216,401,3.0,6/29/2017,"Chill place to hangout post show. I came for the pizookie, let's be honest LOL. It was good, but the smore one was wayy too deathin-gly sweet. I struggled, and I'm a girl who likes chocolate. Luckily my guy friends were there to demolish the rest. Another  two people in out group shared a pizza, and that looked good. I definitely want to get an Irish Mule next time instead lol."
Ashley Z.,"Huntington Beach, CA",143,210,126,4.0,11/12/2016,"Pretty good for a chain restaurant.  Their brussels sprouts are TO DIE FOR.  Totally random for a place that's known for pizza, but trust me....they're amazing!! Service is average and prices are a little high, but the food is good and the portions are pretty decent."
Kelley S.,"Irvine, CA",220,82,58,5.0,7/18/2016,"Kayla is amazing and Super Friendly. I prefer this location  (due to atmosphere and is pleasing). Parking was very easy tonight, so I am happy. Looking forward to my Great White Pizza!"
Rose O.,"Huntington Beach, CA",18,7,,5.0,11/11/2017,"On Nov. 10, my  husband I both ate at BJs as they honored our Veterans.  Both my husband and I are Viet Nam Vets.  He served on a ship and I was in the hospital corps serving in San Diego Navy Hospital.  We want to thank BJs for honoring our Veterans and for the wonderful service we received.  Our waiter was Jose Reyes and he was great.  Again, thank you very, very much."
Kerry Gizzy K.,"Redlands, CA",43,12,2,2.0,8/18/2017,"We never have a good experience at any BJs, the server was um ok, the dry lemon chicken wings were not good, the flight of beer came out warm & it took forever to pay with a card."
