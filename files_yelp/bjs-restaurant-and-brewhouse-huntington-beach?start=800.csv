S H.,"Garden Grove, CA",0,6,,2.0,4/28/2014,"We got to Bj's before  6PM with a party of 7 and were seated in theverflow (?) area  that is actually part of the waiting area, only separated by a row of plants.  A party of about 12 was already there and was a little noisy at times.  Half of us were facing west and the sun was blazing in the windows only minimally obscured by screens.  The sun became too much for me and I asked about covering up the widows more.  The receptionist came in and lowered the screen so that the backs of the chairs were covered which did nothing for our eyes.  She said ""that is the BEST I can do several times which led me to believe that it wasn't the first complaint they had ever had. At the same time the sun was glaring off car windshields in the parking lot and that actually became worse than the sun, but those windows didn't even have the useless screens so nothing was offered.   I ordered salmon without the champagne butter sauce since I can not have dairy and when it came, it was covered in sauce.  They took it back and in about a half hour brought the salmon with no sauce.  They were kind enough to not charge us for it.  Next time we will NOT allow them to sit us in that space - which is to me a form of banishment for being bad or something.  I do not think that seven people would be too many for the restaurant proper to handle, especially since we were fairly early and there were no people waiting outside.  Other than the awful sun problem and wrong order, the servers were courteous and accommodating so that the evening was not a total disappointment, but pretty close to it.  Something needs to be done about the sun shining in the customer's eyes, even turning the tables 180 degrees would help some, but investing in opaque screens would eliminate half of my complaints about that room;  leaving the room for truly large and boisterous parties would make more sense. More and more people are developing food intolerance's and it would behoove restaurants to pay more attention to requests for changes to orders.  They should offer some gluten free choices along with dairy free sauces, it IS possible to eat well without using allergy provoking ingredients."

Dennis B.,"Lemont, IL",0,5,,1.0,2/16/2014,"Good service and all, but I got severe food poisoning from their ""enlightened"" ahi tuna salad.  So regardless of how nice the experience was I can't say I would ever be able to recommend it."
Delta N.,"Alhambra, CA",3,129,,4.0,12/9/2009,This is one of our favorite spots for my friends and I. The prices are decent and it has a bit of everything for everyone. It can get pretty busy at night so make reservations or expect to wait 20-30 minutes.  Drinks: Their house special beers are great. If you like dark beers then you'll like this place. The framboise and hard ciders are good if you're not into beers and I like their alcoholic rootbeer float. They also have a full bar.  Appetizers: I think we've tried everything and we like everything. We go for the sampler platter since it has a bit of everything. The avocado fried eggrolls and hot wings are so goood.  Entrees: I love meatloaf and they probably have the best chain restaurant meatloaves I've tried. I also like their pizzas. That or I'll usually get the salad and soup. Their salads are yummy.  Desserts: Pizookie is a must. Warm giant cookie with ice cream. I love the macademia one since it's not as overwhelming as the choco chip. On your birthday they'll give you a personal size pizookie for free!
Jerome R.,"Glendale, CA",302,5,1,2.0,5/12/2011,"Shawn said this below but really their service people at the reception area are HORRIBLE. I've walked in before and asked for a table, take out, etc. and there hasn't been a problem usually.  Today, I tried calling in to order takeout since they have cards in front of the reception area saying that it would  be faster to pre-order. I call in and am put on hold while the guy gets the other guy who takes care of takeout orders. After apparently forgetting about me for 20 minutes, I called back. NOW they have someone to take my order. Even if I ordered, i wouldn't have time to eat so I couldn't order. If the person who picks up the phone says his name is Kenny, DON'T order takeout. I'm especially pissed that the manager didn't even try to make things right. I've gone in to eat in the restaurant and the food and service were fine. I'd give 3.5 to 4 stars for that. But I've also noticed that the staff likes to talk a lot and lounge around when I walked in for takeout. Really, the manager needs to crack down. It's a customer service job.  I like BJs in general. I think their food is usually well done and the pizzas (especially the cheeseburger pizza) is amazing. When service starts lacking, then I can't really enjoy the food."
Kevin K.,"Los Alamitos, CA",66,17,23,4.0,3/27/2011,Best Chain Brew House. Food is above average but varies from restaurant to restaurant. Been to Cerritos and Downey Locations. Cerritos is better.
Alex V.,"Westminster, CA",1033,330,189,5.0,5/25/2011,"5 stars today bitch! wanna know why? Red Velvet Pizookie, holy fuck that shit was good, white chocolate chips to boot. Man I gotta get back there asap and have another one of those sweet delicious treats."
Nicole L.,"Santa Ana, CA",197,15,3,4.0,10/16/2011,"Me and my boyfriend came here for dinner, like most times we choose bjs cause of the pizza and pizookie. It was Saturday night and the wait was only 10 minutes. We got our seats and waited..and waited, usually I can be patient. But as we were watching other waiters chat it up with other people or helping other tables, we were still being unnoticed, I was getting ready to get up and tell someone, but then our waiter came and apologized. Which was good, but not only that, he said we could get a pizookie on the house for waiting, the regular size too, not the small one...We ordered a side caesar salad, large pizza and my bf got a soda. When the bill came he also didn't charge for the soda so our meal was about 20 dollars total. So free pizookie and free soda, yay! Even tho we had to wait a few extra minutes, the waiter made it up to us in the end, which was great service. I was also able to get mushrooms on the side for my pizza since my bf doesnt like them.. Will definitely still be eating there since our waiter was able to accommodate us with good service.  :)"
Don Xavier D.,"Garden Grove, CA",237,40,,4.0,11/15/2008,"I have a ""I (lessthan three) BEER"" t-shirt I never wear it, but when I drink and subsequently eat at BJ's, it reminds me of just how much I'd like to be wearing that shirt. BJ's is an excellent microbrewery with seasonal bears that rotate ever month and a half or so. A great happy hour with half-off, deep-dish, 6-inch pizzas and 2 dollars off appetizers.  I wish I could be like superman and wear my t-shirt under my business clothes. Jump up on the bar stools during happy hour, rip off my tie and open my shirt proudly proclaiming, ""I (lessthan three) Beer, and I'm not ashamed at who knows it! Thank you BJ's with your seasonal delights and excellent value. You help me feel....alive!"""
Isaias T.,"Kent, WA",3,20,,2.0,2/17/2012,Whaat? 60 bucks for a couple of dinners and a couple of drinks? Next time I'll got to coastal cantina.
Jay Y.,"Newport Beach, CA",26,43,8,2.0,8/11/2012,"If I were rating food it would be a 4-5. If I were raring service it would be a -1. I have been here over a dozen times (I live around the corner) and every single time it is the same circus. Horrible is the only way to describe the service here. If you can put up with the abuse the food is good, but hope you have a lot of patience. Good luck!"
Amy L.,"Green Lake, Seattle, WA",21,99,,3.0,1/31/2009,Went with a big group for lunch on a weekday. Good selection of the regular American fare all at good prices. The lunch portion Italian salad was pretty big and well priced.  This is a good place to do lunch/dinner with a group or for a quick casual meal. Also a good place for the greasy pizza/burger with beer meal. I still want to go back and check out this legendary pizooki!
Safa S.,"Anaheim, CA",120,457,41,4.0,9/25/2010,"I love the happy hour here.  They have really good appetizers like thin crust pizza, avocado egg rolls and much more.  The pizza here is pretty good too."
Michael G.,"Niles, OH",76,168,1292,4.0,6/21/2009,"Good bar-n-grill.  I recommend the chicken pot stickers appetizer, the angus french dip sandwich w/ wedge fries, and either a Godiva or peanut butter cookie pizzookie for dessert.  Wash it all down with a BJ's Blonde. Letter grade:  B+"
Chris L.,"Costa Mesa, CA",11,10,1,5.0,3/12/2012,"Patrick is the man. Ask for him if you go in. He is quick, timely, and fun. Pazookie is a must. I go he often, but was surprised with the service I got from ""the man"" patrick"
Carlos T.,"Santa Ana, CA",1,8,14,1.0,2/6/2014,"Great food!! Good ambiance! But the worst service I've ever got. My girlfriend and I went to BJ's restaurant to have dinner there was no wait which is good but we got sat right next to a table with 20 young people, it was extremely loud and annoying but we were ok with it because we also work in the restaurant business. The waiter took good 10 min to approach our table, he didn't say his name or nothing. He took the drink order ( which it took another 15 min for him to bring them) and also the appetizer order, the appetizer was good and did not took to long then out of the blue literally 30 min later a waitress comes to our table telling us that the other server had to go home and she was gonna be taking care if us ( like I said I work in the restaurant business to so I understand when a server gets send home he/she has to tell the guest that he/she is leaving and let them know who will take care of them now) we ordered at this point I was a bit irritated no refills on our waters or beers then the food took even longer to come out the server never stopped to ask if we needed anything, food arrived we ask for to go boxes we pay And I never went back again. too bad great place!"
Wes L.,"Huntington Beach, CA",2,18,,5.0,2/6/2014,"My girlfriend and I ate here for the first time together - been here before - however we ordered a pizza and left the to go box on the table - came  back in literally minutes - aka less than 4 minutes later to get the pizza - and it was thrown away :(  with people already sat at our table - the manager comes out of nowhere and says ""looking for something"" i tell him what happened - and he couldn't have been MORE HELPFUL - he asks how many slices were left AND REMAKES ME A SMALL PIZZA TO GO -  AMAZING MANAGEMENT AT THIS BJS - his CUSTOMER SERVICES SKILLS ARE PHENOMENAL - GIVE THIS GUY A RAISE - HE'LL BRING CUSTOMERS BACK IN!!!!!!! - probably about 5'6-5'7 white dude that wore glasses brown hair - THANKS AGAIN!!"
Rashell B.,"Beverly Hills, CA",47,17,5,4.0,2/4/2011,This is the best place to hang with your girlfriends or guy friends. Its a relaxing atmosphere with great tv's surrounding you. Especially on a friday or saturday night.. its always packed with people who are wanting to have a good time! The menu has a variety of different entrees and appetizers to choose from. My favorite are their wedge potato fries and the chocolate chip pazookie! TASTEEEE!!!!! :) the only downside is that you have to wait for a table.
Brad N.,"Paris, France",274,387,47,4.0,5/20/2009,This is a great place for groups.  Come here for your birthday and you will get a free mini-pizookie.  They have really good pizzas and a great selection of beer.
An L.,"Anaheim, CA",45,15,1,5.0,10/28/2011,"I drink at BJ's too much. They have great berry cider. I only like berry cider from BJ's and The Studio Buffet(Las Vegas's M Resort buffet). I've tried others, but I can't find a better cider. They have a new red velvet pizookie now that tastes pretty good. This review will be exactly the same as the one in Irvine because I was there 3 days in a row."
