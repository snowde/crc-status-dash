Kathy T.,"Camarillo, CA",0,15,1,2.0,4/30/2012,"Don't order the BJ's cobb salad - it is a total rip-off. I am on a restricted diet (no sugar, no starch) so I ordered the cobb without dressing and asked for blue cheese instead of feta cheese. Cobb salads usually have major quantities of chicken or turkey, bacon, blue cheese, egg, etc. over lettuce, and that's why I order them - lots of protein and filling. The BJ's version was like 90% chopped iceberg lettuce and I had to hunt for the stuff that wasn't lettuce. My son ordered the steak salad, which looked really delicious and had a lot more heft to it. The staff were super friendly, the ambiance is great, and I've always liked BJ's. Lesson learned - don't order the BJ's cobb!"
D C.,"Las Vegas, NV",202,171,5,3.0,10/26/2010,"BJ's is pretty good, but their Tustin location just seems so much larger/better. They've got a full bar with a large array of beers on tap. Check out the Beer Sampler if you're not sure what to get--7 flutes of beer ranging from very light to very dark await your drinking pleasure--it's good for the ladies because each flute is small and it's diverse. Me? I'd rather just get a few pitchers on tap to wash down the food to come. Happy Hour is decent here, and so is the food. If you like your steak nice and charred like I do, they've got a blackened steak for only $18.95.  Basically everything on the menu is good, with nothing extraordinarily unappealing (except maybe for the Avocado and Santa Fe Spring Rolls--these are gross.) Word of advice: whether you're a health nut, or just someone curious about the nutrional value of the meals here, you should check out the facts about the meal you're about to order. Some of the pizzas have 10,000 mg of sodium! The Pizzookie is also a must. The restaurant chain's signature dessert--it  is utterly delicious. One time our server had the kitchen custom-bake a 15 inch Pizzookie in a pizza pan to accomodate our large order--and it was nothing short of awesome."
Jonathan R.,"Glendale, CA",152,18,11,2.0,3/31/2011,"This place has decent tasting food, but mainly the low star rating is due to the service. Our waiter was very unattentive, forgot our appetizer, and bought our a wrong order. It was a busy evening, but there was lots of  staff to assist their customers. Btw it was my first experience to BJ's and didn't go so well from what i've been told. I'll give them a second chance sometime soon."
Mr. C.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,156,9,2.0,12/27/2012,"Usually am satisfied with the pizza here but today will most likely be my last visit. Ordered the great white pan pizza. Guess what?! Pizza does not come put on a pan anymore. That would've been fine had it not been for the the second slice being cold, grossly soggy. Don't think that's acceptable at all BJ's, do you?"
John L.,"Torrance, CA",0,12,,1.0,1/17/2014,"Perhaps the worst service that I have ever had in any restaurant.  We arrived with a party of 8 (4 adults 4 kids) at 5:00 pm.  There were more employees than customers at this time as expected.  We were sat in front near the hostess area and where the wait staff congregated.  We werent greeted for 15 minutes and that was only after I asked the host to send our server over.  I guess me asking for our server labeled us as demanding because for the rest of the meal, we were glared at and ignored.   We were never served by the same person and had to ask for EVERYTHING.  Food was as expected (I'm sure it contained spit).  This was the first time in my life that I have left $0 for a tip."
Candice Z.,"Portland, OR",444,356,91,3.0,1/28/2009,"Always check out their seasonal beers! Always get a pazooooooooki!!!!!! GIANT-COOKIE-COVERED-IN-ICE-CREAM Get here early on the weekends because there's usually about an hour wait, which I don't think is really worth it. I don't like to wait for my giant dessert. But if there's not a very long wait I'll hang around. Pizza's are good, but I'm not a fan of chunky tomato sauce where there are huge chunks of tomato in my sauce and all over my pizza, so I usually have to take it off when I share a pizza with others. So yeah, not worth the wait... but go if you can just walk in."
Rick C.,"Sacramento, CA",12,22,,4.0,7/26/2011,"Great service, great beer and awseome food"
Billy L.,"Orange County, CA",199,70,106,4.0,8/31/2011,Happy Hour is when I come here. That's when you get Half Off Mini Pizzas and dollar off Beers!  I would usually come and eat 2 Mini BJ's Favorite Pizzas and get a few Blondes....and that would make my day.  Just had some today....so definitely feeling good for the rest of the day.  Will be back soon!
Michelle F.,"Auburn, CA",29,58,1,2.0,8/28/2011,"Went here for my lil cousins bday....had our group out in the lil courtyard area by the front door. Food was ok, service was pretty bad. We had 2 girls that were our waiters for the party and one couldn't smile if she had to & the other was better but not great. The best thing about this place on this day was the family time that we had and the beer. Oh & they did package all the left overs up from the buffet that my cousin paid for with having the party there. I guess that was pretty cool. The bathrooms were clean too and parking's a breeze."
Shara J.,"Huntington Beach, CA",161,9,1,2.0,10/19/2011,"I looove the food here but every time i go to this one i always get the worst service! its so frustrating because i know what its like to be overwhelmed by too many tables but someone clearly needs to rethink how many tables theyre assigning to their servers. I literally don't get a glass of water for 15 minutes sometimes, that's ridiculous."
susan l.,"Rowland Heights, CA",264,750,1646,3.0,2/15/2011,"like any other BJ's, but BUSIER! went in on a tuesday night and they were PACKED. we ended up sitting in the patio area, and by the time we left the patio was full. the host that seated us said that it was busy like that every night, so be prepared to call ahead for a rez or to wait!"
Ayesha L.,"Orange County, CA",43,43,,3.0,10/5/2011,"The pizza is my favorite here along with pizookie of course. The spinach artichoke dip sucked! Too salty and all I could taste was cheese. I ordered the gluten free veggie pizza and OMG it was delish! It tastes diff than non-gluten, you can really notice a difference. Service used to be great here, but not it really sucks! Actually, it depends on where you are seated really. They used to have impeccable service, but now they always seem to be so busy and lack in service or are understaffed. It usually takes them 20 min to bring out our checks and 10 min to bring out boxes for left over food. They really need to do something about this."
Rox P.,"Long Beach, CA",18,145,451,3.0,6/11/2011,"My little niece and nephew loves the children menu - they ordered the cheese pizza and mac and cheese.  The adults had the everything pizza.  I'm not a big fan of thick crust pizza but the sauce was flavorful and the pizza had enough meat.  I prefer the appetizer margharita pizza - it was a thin crisp pizza dough with basil, tomatoes and cheese.  The kids wanted the chocolate chip pizzokie and it was warm and gooey with ice cream on top - what's not too like."
Andrea C.,"Garden Grove, CA",0,5,3,2.0,12/15/2014,"This had to have been the worst impression I've ever had regarding service and management service. I am a server myself and have patience and understanding to an extent. We had sat in the bar area and took about 10 minutes by the time we got greeted. Then took over 5 min just for 2 waters. Then another 10 minutes before we ordered. We got there 10 minutes into the first quarter for MNF and ordered but barely got our food midway into the 2nd quarter. In between all that, when we finally got our food the burger was barely warm like it had been sitting a while,  never got our appetizer first but instead with our meals, went through 2 different servers to ask for napkins water and the side they didn't put on our meal in the first place. The waitress comes by 10 minutes after we get our food to finally bring a water refill and asks if we need anything,  but by that time I had already asked for the manager. After I tell the manager about the prolonged wait we've had with service, he remakes the burger but doesn't even give a discount or comp the burger. I'm sorry but this whole situation could of been handled a lot better. I've gotten better service from Dennys before."
Dan G.,"Irvine, CA",88,75,61,4.0,11/6/2011,"Great food, and great service. We had a bit of a dud for a host, but our server was awesome."
Ryan F.,"Walnut Creek, CA",107,129,1,4.0,3/1/2009,"There are a lot of BJ's Restaurants in the Orange County area, and they all have their share of problems. The food, at the very least, is always consistently delicious. There are two main problems with this particular BJ's location: 1. The service is inconsistent 2. The restaurant is ALWAYS packed Regarding the service, there are a couple of waiters who are surprisingly horrible yet they continue to be employed. I don't know many companies who will employ horrible workers, but if you're a shitty waiter or waitress you can rest assured you can get a job here. Apart from two specific waiters, the service overall is poor when it comes to timeliness. You'll usually find that if you order an appetizer and your meal at the same time, they'll arrive simultaneously (thus defeating the point of the appetizer). My wife and I have had to work out a system where we order the appetizer with our drinks, then pretend we ""need a few more minutes"" to look over the menu just to ensure we don't get everything delivered all at once. Regarding the crowdedness of the place, the management got smart and now allows people to call-ahead to get their name on the waiting list. If you want to get a table within 15 minutes of you getting there, call ahead at least 10 minutes before you decide to begin driving there. Lastly, there is always a large pack of smokers standing outside the entrance and a smaller pack sitting on the patio near the fountain (where there is no overhang). It's all perfectly legal, but is still annoying. If you hate smoke, wait inside. Oh, and the pizza always makes me sick. Don't order the pizza."
Kate J.,"Greater Vancouver, Canada",1,33,,2.0,6/23/2013,"This place was packed at 10pm, and the bar was full of course. Sitting in a booth, I ordered one of those small salads with strawberries. It was drenched in dressing, and there was a lone bit of avocado that definitely wasn't supposed to be there...My friend had a caesar salad, but she said it tasted like it was ranch sauce in place of caesar dressing. The food wasn't good, and the service was just okay, so I guess I should go for the bar next time!"
Alex T.,"Seattle, WA",1849,632,222,2.0,5/12/2010,"Went here for their beer samplers, dinner, and spend time with friends! :) Finally learned I can switch out that dreaded Jamaican Red for something better. I opted for another blonde. Mmmmhmm. Finished 5 of my samplers...that was good enough for me!  I ordered the chicken quesadilla (mini-meal) and it was good! i ate it with the salsa from the chips and it was even better! they kinda fry their tortilla so its crunchy. I topped it with the lettuce and sour cream provided and it was mmm mmm satisfying.  I tried my friends flatbread and it was good. I like the crunchiness of the crust. I also tried my friends potato skin....SUPER oily! I could only eat one...and still felt guilty. -__- Then I tried my friends mozzarella sticks with marinara sauce! Their sticks are good, but the marinara was somewhat bland and they need to give more sauce for that many sticks (10 sticks!!). I had to dip my sticks in salsa for extra flavoring.  Service....was ok. We were waiting a while for our samplers because the girl forgot what order to bring them in...so they had to re-pour them. :/ Then she spilled some beer on our table...took her a good 10 minutes to come back with some napkins to wipe it off. We ended up wiping the beer spill up...-__-. Our bill took forever to get, pay and sign...we had to flag her down each time we wanted something. Disappointed in the service... but im aware it's not always like this. i'll probably be fair a submit a better review next time. But for now....2 stars for the food and beer, but -3 for the service!!! (greater than sign) :O"
patricia f.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,16,3,3.0,8/6/2013,"Remember when BJs pizza was delish? Yeah, don't go there, you will be disappointed. I used to love the deep dish at the Laguna location, this one was awful. The pizza is so dry and there was so little sauce it tastes like a gigantic breadstick with a few topping thrown on. When the crust is a thick deep dish it should be going and covered with topping, this was not. Service was nothing to write home about either. After trying for 10 minutes to get my servers attention, she was leaning against the wall by the bar avoiding eye contact, she finally came over. I told her the pizza was really dry and asked her for more sauce. About 15 minutes later a different server brought it out. The only reason I have this place ANY stars was the pizookie which was as delish as ever. No wonder it isn't called BJs Pizzaria any longer as their pizza is painfully subpar. Save the carbs by avoiding the pizza and go straight for the pizookie. Dominos and Pizza Hut have better deep dish and that is saying something!"
Don H.,"Costa Mesa, CA",136,133,54,1.0,7/30/2012,"I was contacted by an area manager after my first trip here and after some mishaps in the communication I was sent an apology letter and a ""courtesy card"". I am a very reasonable man and understand everyone has off days and I am more than willing to give a second chance. However the second chance was almost worse than the original. Our waiter apparently forgot about us at one point because we didn't see him for about a half an hour. When he saw us and was startled back into to remembering he was in charge of us, he stuttered out asking why we hadn't got our dessert yet. We had in fact finished our dessert a good 20 minutes earlier. For god knows what reason we went again, mostly because we still had credit there. We didn't expect much, and thats about what we got. Asked for 2 glasses of water, didn't get it, constantly waited for refills, asked about the spice of the hot wings was told the  regular buffalo was spicy and the other spicy ones were unbearable. Regular were not spicy at all and when I asked for the hotter sauce, I got a cold side of sauce which was fitting since my wings had gone cold waiting for him to come back, our pizookie which had been the saving grace came out with the ice cream mostly melted. This place is always busy and I can't figure out. We are 0 for 3 and have had such terrible experiences it blows my mind. Then again applebees always looks busy, sheep i guess."
