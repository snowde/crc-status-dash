Steven W.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,13,,3.0,8/3/2011,$3 beers is the highlight of this place. Food is pretty good. Need to revamp the menu.
Kara K.,"Park Ridge, IL",1,4,,4.0,1/17/2012,"LOVE the raspberry cider. mmmm just thinking about it makes me want to head over there and have some right now!  Although, finding someone to go with me who doesn't mind waiting a looong time for a table can sometimes be an issue. But what can you say? They are busy because they are good. Everything on the menu is delicious. Like hate yourself in the morning for having too many appetizers, drinks, and desserts-type of delicious.  A great place to splurge for a special occasion."
Holly E.,"Huntington Beach, CA",92,33,50,4.0,2/20/2011,"I don't know if it was because it was raining or because it was a Saturday night, or both, but this place was cuh-razy crowded. The hostess was training (which added to some of the seating confusion I think) some people got pagers, some did not. Luckily we stood right by the podium and heard when they were looking for us.  Our waiter was also training (being shadowed by his trainer the whole night) We each ordered a drink and an appetizer along with our entrees. We gave him the whole order at once and were quite flummoxed when our entrees came out first (flummoxed but not upset, i mean, it all ends up in the same spot anyway right?) Our waiter's trainer came by shortly thereafter with our appetizers and apologized profusely swearing that they entered it correctly and it never happens and that he would let his manager know. I thought this was very thoughtful of him, considering we weren't complaining about it. (though we were at a little 2 person table and trying fit four big plates on it was entertaining.) About 2 minutes later, the manager came by and apologized again, saying they were going to comp our appetizers (which they didn't need to do, but we were grateful) Everyone was very nice about the whole situation (which they made a much bigger deal of than we had.) They also got my french fry order wrong, but I didn't care; potato/potato.  Throughout the night we encountered a total of five different people being trained (which on a Saturday night on a holiday weekend may not have been the best scheduling choice) i think this added to the general chaos of the restaurant that night, there were just too many people working. There was nothing particularly impressive about the food (i mean, it was good, just not mind blowing) I'm giving them this rating because of the amazing customer service we received. They handled a potentially upsetting situation very well, and I commend them for that. They had no way of knowing that we weren't the kind of people to totally flip out over something so trivial (YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE!) And they took care of us anyway. For that reason alone, I would go back."
Shannon H.,"Chandler, AZ",401,158,433,2.0,6/28/2010,"My experience here was not the best! The parking was sufficient but there was none. Maybe because it was so busy, the hosts weren't very friendly. This was just a regular Thurs. night around 7pm. The bartenders took so long to not only take your order for your first drink, but then to bring it to you. And this happened to everyone in my group! This is not my local BJ's and their food wasn't even as good as the one near me! :(  Overall, just not a very good restaurant."
Jonathan L.,"Garden Grove, CA",10,37,4,5.0,7/11/2010,"BJ's serves my favorite pizza of any other place. It doesn't taste like any ordinary pizza like Pizza Hut, Dominoes, etc. It's the place to go for some gourmet pizza. They also have a nice assortment of special brews with different flavors. I tried the Nutty Brunette, which went perfect with my pizza. The pizookie with vanilla ice-cream is incredible. I look forward to trying they're other special beers in the future!"
Samuel L.,"Cypress, CA",0,14,1,5.0,6/12/2009,"BJ'S !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  ONE OF MY FAVORITE PLACES TO EAT.   Must haves! = DEEP DISH PIZZA, SHRIMP SCAMPI,  HEFEWEIZEN, PIZOOKIE, AND THE ARTICHOKE DIP.   Prices are great!!! not too expensive and well worth every cent. Come out happy every single time! GUARANTEED  *The ONLY downside is on game days, it gets really packed...remember to make reservations!*"
Christa N.,"Anaheim, CA",87,248,69,4.0,3/26/2008,"You know what  the worst thing about being or having been a server?  The fact that everywhere you go, you can't  escape it and you tend to either critique the service or feel bad for the server because of someone in your party.  (SAD, i know.) Well, I came here tonight with a few of my girlfriends, and a few of their friends. Our server wasn't that great, she seemed annoyed actually, but she wasn't God-awful. I actually felt bad for her because a member of our party came off a bit rude and annoying,  (at least to me she did).  The runner who dropped off our food was really nice though. He actually took the opportunity to talk to us and physically SERVE us our food.  The food was great, as you can imagine.  My friend and I shared a small pizza: half Sweet Pig, half BBQ. It was absolutely filling and delicious, but what made it worse was that we decided to order 1 Pizookie platter for SIX girls.   HOLY CRAP. you try to finish that with six girls and you're out of your freakin' mind!  We ended up not finishing it, what a waste! haha 4 stars because the food was great, most of our company was great, and the service was mostly great (thanks to the runner)."
Connor H.,"Huntington Beach, CA",47,89,6,1.0,4/8/2014,ive been here before and the food has always been good. this time was for a friends 21st birthday and we had a reservation so we were sat immediately. drink orders were taken for all 26 of us and were brought quickly also. but here is where it went downhill. after ordering our food we waited and were told as soon as it was ready it would be out. more food and more food was coming out as soon as it was ready yet where was the food i ordered? finally after the waiter thought everyone had their food he asked if anyone needed anything. a friend of mine told him i needed my food to which the waiter completely forgot what i ordered although he told me when i ordered it was his favorite. so the waiter leaves and comes back with some drinks and to refill peoples water yet still no food. about 10ish minutes later he brought my food out which i thought was suppose to be hot and it was just barely warm.  as i started eating the waiter started asking people if they wanted any desserts. at this point i was furious but didnt say anything. was about a third of the way finished with my meal when he asked if anyone needed a box. being that i was so frustrated and not wanting my friends to have to wait till i was done to leave i boxed it up and paid. normally i wouldnt tip with that level of horrible service but since i was with a large group i still ended up giving a 6 dollar tip. never again would i go in with a group or even recommend people go in a large group
V D.,"Westminster, CA",1,2,,1.0,7/28/2013,The service here sucks!!! We had wait for 20mins just for the waiter to bring us empty boxes!
Rob R.,"Huntington Beach, CA",1,4,,5.0,7/12/2009,"BJ's has become my hands-down favorite chain restaurant for two reasons--consistently great food and BJ's Blonde micro-brew beer.  Let me tell you, for the most part I never have really liked drinking beer, but I actuallyget excited about coming here because the Blonde is sooooooo yummy.  Tastes so good when it hits your lips!  Haha!   In all seriousness, the salad, pizza and appetizers are all great!  I've been to various locations probably 50+ times in the last few years, and I've never had a bad meal.  The service is also top notch.  My friend and I also tried 2 new appetizers that just came out--the calimari and this chicken pesto flatbread.  Both were delicious!  So if you haven't been here yet, it's time to try it and get hooked like me. -Rob"
Vee B.,"Garden Grove, CA",21,45,16,4.0,12/28/2009,Number one rule...when you go to BJ's get a PAZOOKI! its basically a cookie the size of a personal pizza with ice cream on top. i have tried the chocolate chip pazooki and that is pretty awesome but if you really want melt in your mouth yumminess...try the oreo one! it comes with this cream frosting type stuff that is just ridiculously amazing! best deal is to come on the weekdays for happy hour. personal pizzas are half off and you can walk out for under 10 if you abstain from alcohol...but...i would recommend splurging an extra ten because they have a full range of beers and even a few ciders to suit your taste buds.
Amber W.,"Huntington Beach, CA",16,5,2,2.0,6/26/2013,"The service on my visit on 6/17 for my daughter's bday was horrible.  We ordered wings and got chicken nuggets.  I asked at least twice for utensils as there wasn't one on the table for my seat.  Never received it.  My daughter who was celebrating her bday was to receive her free pzookie and ordered a standard chocolate chip and received the order of another person at the table with her bday candle in it.  Then when we get the check and credit card receipt I received no pen to sign the receipt.  After trying to flag down our server and asking for a pen and still not receiving one, I ended up signing the check with the butter knife that was still on the table. The food itself is always good but the service was atrocious."
Tam N.,"Placentia, CA",224,19,6,3.0,12/6/2010,"Good for appetizers and micro brew beer. The Parmesan crusted chicken breast is also pretty good, but everything else is pretty average for the price."
Brad F.,"Los Angeles, CA",25,131,,4.0,7/8/2006,"What is better than hand in hand on the peir? How about Bjs on Beach Blvd. I met a few ""bros"" here and we watched some sports and had brewhouse juice.  Hostess were real nice, but our waiter was like a Geoffrey Dahmer Doppleganger. Freaky + he took the wrong order- my friend asked for a bottle of Corona and Lil Dham brought out a pale ale draft. Hmmm, I can see how might get those mixed up.  I was not too hungry so I just had the honey chicken salad which was a step up from the BK version, but only ONE step up.  BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse off Beach Blvd (try to say that fast after 5 ales) gets 4 stars because the place is big, people are nice (except lil mr. dahmer, he wanted to eat us) and there are plenty of screens to watch sports. The food that I tasted was average, but the food I smelled was mouthwatering. Deep Dish pizza and Clam Chowder. I hope I am hungry when I go here next so I can order those."
Anni T.,"Huntington Beach, CA",132,46,11,2.0,10/19/2010,"So... this place is alright and it's nice to chill at a local spot at times, but the service I got last week was horrible! First I ordered the lettuce wraps which already took 10 minutes to find a waitress to help us. Then when they came, there were no utensils so after waiting 2-3 minutes we asked for some. Then the waitress came back and we ordered a bloody mary... it came with no peppers on it, then when i tried it while she was getting some peppers, it tasted horrible. I've had then there before and they were pretty good... then when i told her, she took it and left... did not say sorry or if i wanted anything else but... really ??!?! i was so shocked, it's not like i love to give back drinks! I was so mad then she told the manager i asked for no chili peppers... I don't think id go back anytime soon."
Anne N.,"Garden Grove, CA",42,107,,3.0,11/2/2009,"BJ's is the ""safe bet.""  Not exactly the best place to grab some grub, but I don't leave upset either. I really like their BBQ Chicken Pizza and their Spicy Chicken Wings.   They do have a few good brews on tap, certain locations have Arrogant Bastard (I believe this one does too) which is one of the better beers out there and when I feel like having something less hefty, they have a framboise as well. There's a pretty big screen behind the bar, so it isn't a bad game watching location either (yay for basketball season!)"
Alison W.,"Costa Mesa, CA",1,176,14,5.0,6/10/2011,I'm not a huge fan of BJs as I am not a big beer drinker but I have to say that between this one and the others I have been to I'd give this one a 5*. I only came in for take-out but from the moment I walked up I had the door held open for me and I was greeted with large smiles at the to-go counter. They were inundated with phone calls but still managed to take my order with a smile. I waited outside and noticed what a nice area it was - it was an enclosed patio of sorts. The bummer would be that if there are lots of guests waiting to be seated they will probably spill out in the adjoining area to watch you eat but besides that it was lovely and there was a fountain outside that sounded wonderfully relaxing. When I picked up my food they were still all smiles. Service speaks quite a lot about a place and this place gets 5*s for service. Food was excellent - I would totally recommend the mozzarella and tomato salad as it was wonderfully seasoned and a fair amount for only 2.95!
Steve T.,"Irvine, CA",52,122,19,4.0,1/26/2010,"Even though I consider this place as one of those cookie cutters corporate chains, the food ain't that bad! The service is always great and I enjoy their diverse menu. It's a bit pricey but what do you expect? If you feel like being around a lot of people, this is the place to be."
Mindy H.,"Huntington Beach, CA",60,14,,5.0,5/16/2013,"I was happy to see that they are offering sodas without high fructose corn syrup! Makes me not feel as guilty letting my kids have soda when we go out. The kids chic pasta was amazing. They're food is always good, and their drinks are even better."
Nicole G.,"Fountain Valley, CA",0,11,1,5.0,5/7/2013,Hadn't been to BJ's in a while but had a great lunch today with my mom! Awesome staff! Jaelene was our waitress and she was great! Very sweet and personable! Also gave us great tips on food selections while always checking back on us! Also had Randy make my drink and it was great! That is how a mojito should be made! Last time I had a mojito at BJs it tasted more like fruit juice but this was one of the best I have had! I need more mojitos like this! Definitely going to come back soon on my days off! Again amazing staff!
