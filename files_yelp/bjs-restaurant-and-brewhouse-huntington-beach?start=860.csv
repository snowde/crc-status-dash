Stan V.,"Huntington Beach, CA",42,76,,4.0,2/17/2011,Good pizza. Brew is good too. Decent size bar.
Heather S.,"Midway City, CA",46,11,,4.0,1/25/2012,"The very best thing about BJ's is happy hour. Half off all mini pizzas is awesome and $2 off appetizers + $1 off beer doesn't hurt either. I really enjoy the small bites that they have added to their menu. There is a ton of mozzarella in the tomato and mozzarella salad and it is a really great price! I am a big football fan and I really like that they have booths in the bar and a ton of flat screen TVs for watching the game. The late night happy hour is also great because I don't get off work during the week until around 8pm so I always miss regular happy hours but the late night one starts at a perfect time for me. My biggest complaint is that sometimes the bar is completely full during happy hour, while I appreciate that this is a sign of good food and prices, I wish the bar were a little bigger so that I didn't have to go somewhere else. I am vegetarian and they have a pretty good selection of items for me but I also like the Mediterranean pizza without the chicken."
Gstar K.,"Huntington Beach, CA",65,365,196,4.0,11/25/2007,"BAZOOKIE 4 PIZOOKIES!!! Although a chain, consistency is cool too. Been here a handful of times. One of the best locations out of other 3been to: Main St., HB & Westwood, L.A. (my shortest review ever ;) Oh yeah, near the 405, across from Bella Terra Entertainment Plaza, & Party City is next door in case you're wondering what else to do in the area."
Brandi C.,"Garden Grove, CA",72,20,12,5.0,10/25/2010,"Strictly rating for the pazookie here. Outstanding! The food overall, so-so. I do love the BBQ Chicken Pizza, though. Most of the other options I've tried, not that impressed. Oh, I almost forgot, the drinks are VERY TASTY!"
Anjelica A.,"Garden Grove, CA",95,49,9,5.0,12/9/2008,"One of my favorite places to go back in the high school days... and still today!  Although its been a few months since my last visit, BJ's has never disappointed in food, drinks and dessert!  The BBQ chicken Salad is absolutely do die for! And they give you such big portions that you have to just take the rest home.  Their drinks are poured very nicely, and they have some outstanding beer, and I don't even like beer!  And finally, you cannot... and I mean absolutely CANNOT go to BJ's without having the legendary Pizzookie! It's a Pizza Cookie that is topped off with fresh vanilla bean ice cream, that that's after the deep dish cookie is heated up in the oven so that the warm cookie and ice cream just melt in your mouth harmoniously! Definitely a great place to go and hang out with friends for dinner... you can also sit at the bar and enjoy a great game, celebrate a birthday, or just have lunch or dinner! Check it out, its worth it!"
Suzn L.,"Anaheim, CA",71,325,55,4.0,8/31/2007,The best place to have white chocolate Pizookie and Berry Burst Cider. Great hang out place for friends and family.
Peter M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",3,11,2,2.0,8/26/2006,"For the restaurant, Yuck.  Had the meatloaf--was completely inedible.  The food just isn't worth it. The bar is pretty good, though.  As Brad mentioned, lots of TV screens to watch the game.  Lots of different beers. But for food?  Don't bother with this place."
Dmitri S.,"Garden Grove, CA",33,4,1,4.0,1/29/2013,"This isn't a rant about how I didn't get my way or a bash on BJ's restaurants, I actually love their pizza and my server was absolutely amazing, but I have got to say that BJ's has a HORRIBLE HH appetizer special. I can't stress enough how horrible it is. I went in today and went for the HH special and ordered boneless wings for $5. The plate comes out and there are 5 tiny little wings on this big plate.... What!? I can understand if BJ's had the most amazing wings on earth and people traveled far and wide to get their hands on some boneless wings at BJ's. But no, these were just your less than average heated up wings. I took a second look at the HH menu and it says ""happy hour sizes"" which basically means half the size for half the price. So in other words its not a special. Your not saving money. So why have a happy hour. I don't get it. Other than their horrible HH it is a great restaurant to go out with friends, family or a date. It deserves a 4-5 star rate. Just don't expect ""happine$$"" in their ""happy hour""."
R L.,"New York, NY",11,48,5,3.0,9/7/2010,"A dependable spot for a few drinks, good food and sweet desserts.  Meet some friends here so food was an afterthought.  Was good to know that whatever we ordered was going to hit the spot as needed.  Mini bruchetta, fried calamari, ahi poke, spinach artichoke dip, pazookie were all quite good and satisfying.  I was also thoroughly impressed with their Jeremiah Red micro brew."
Crystal L.,"Huntington Beach, CA",12,14,,5.0,1/18/2011,"Love love love this place!!! My favorite thing on the menu is the grilled chicken pasta!! Yum :) Staff was friendly, hardly any wait and our food came out fairly quickly.... If you are eating and start to feel full, get a to go box and save room for their pazookie!!!"
javier v.,"Costa Mesa, CA",23,20,4,2.0,4/25/2010,"tonight marks the second night i have thrown up after eating BJs pizza. the first time, my daughter and i both threw up, the next morning. i called and spoke to the manager, and he assured me they would check the kitchen. he took my address, and about a week later i got a 15 dollar gift card in the mail. no note, nothing. just a card in an envelope. whatever. that was almost 2 years ago, and ive eaten there since with minimal pain (although, usually in Tustin) tonight, my girlfriend brought pizza home and it only took about an hour until it came back to haunt me. i gave two stars because when we eat in the restaurant, the service is good."
Lilly C.,"Anaheim, CA",0,1,,4.0,5/22/2013,"Their food is so good! I usually can be very picky about food, so I was a little nervous about eating at a different place. I ordered a personal pizza, and oh my gosh it was so perfect! It was not greasy, and the flavors were amazing! The only reason why I am giving it 4 stars is because it took an additional 30 mins to get our desserts, which was kind of crazy, and to top it off, personally I think the cookie for the pazookie is way too sweet. It overpowered the ice cream, that it tasted plain. If it wasn't that sweet I would have finished it, but after 4 bites I couldn't continue on. But overall it was a good place with good food!"
Carol M.,"Germantown, TN",150,183,30,4.0,5/3/2010,"Warning!  The menu is huge so be prepared to spend about 20 minutes reading the darn thing.  However, it was worth it.  The avacado egg rolls were amazing and so was the Calfornia flatbread.  Our server was so patient and was really helpful when we were trying to make our selections.  They had some amazing desserts that I wished I had tried but just couldn't do it after all that was sitting in my stomach.  Wish I had more time in HB so that I could have gone back!"
Clifford Y.,"Garden Grove, CA",180,367,37,4.0,4/19/2010,"I came here last saturday for a birthday dinner. Reservations were easily made for about 20 ppl, the tables were set up on time and everything. I like the food here. The pizza here is very heavy and fulfilling, their pazookies (dessert) are always awesome.  I ordered their New Orleans style jambalaya this time, and it was delicious - lots of chicken and shrimp and veggies and a whole lot of stuff, yummy. My gf got the chicken breast with mashed potatoes, they seemed to give a smaller portion on the meat, but it was pretty good. Their staff is very friendly, they were a good sport when putting up with my friends and their ridiculousness.  The inside of this place is very clean, loud, has the sports bar feel, and is huge. We ordered our beer separately at the main bar, the bartender was even friendly and chill. Their house beers are just ehhh to decent at best, and for a place called BJ's ""restaurant & brewery"" that's very disappointing. I ordered their nutty brewnette, it's as dark as a new castle, but has a less appealing after taste. The blonde and hef i tried were kinda mediocre as well. If I wanted to go to a place for just good beers, I'd much rather go elsewhere. But for everything else, this place is pretty amazing!"
Sandra A.,"Huntington Beach, CA",13,484,436,4.0,4/19/2012,"I love this place.  Stumbled upon it many years ago with my kids when we were at the beach.  Dropped in and they had the best pizzas ever.  We shared it.  Can't recall what it was now.  But later, we went to celebrate our anniversary.  The waiter was so nice and the food, the wine, everything was just delicious."
kenneth c.,"Kahului, HI",3,16,8,2.0,8/7/2014,I like to eat at this location and when we have group parties this place hits the spot. My review though is based on their take out department. Phoned in an order around 9pm for a bbq chicken pizza. I arrive 35 min walk in to pick up my take out.  The guy at the register tells me he can't find my order. I told him are you serious you told me to come in 30 min and you don't have my order ready. He goes in the kitchen to double check  comes out empty handed and said sorry but at the time of the order you placed the registers got rebooted and the order probably got lost. Tired of arguing I said if you knew it rebooted you should have made sure it went in or jus hand write it it's common sense. He basically jus said ya they can make it right now if you can wait 30 min. Pretty much defeats the purpose of doing a take out. No apologies and didn't do anything to make the situation right. It wasn't a busy night at all. Very disappointed.
Evan N.,"Torrance, CA",134,198,164,4.0,8/19/2007,"*happy hour review* Loved the pale ale, but just wasn't feelin the hefe.  I met my friend visiting from hawaii after work and we got stuffed jus from the appetizers!  We didn't get any of their pizzas and oddly enough we got different varieties of potato.  Chili cheese fries, reg fries and baked potato were chosen to fill our bellies.  The chili cheese fries filled me up good that nite and was a great mid-morning snack the next day. They were actually the best I had in a while"
H Q.,"Placentia, CA",153,715,1751,3.0,8/14/2009,"3 1/2 seems right on for this place.  I came on a Friday night and it was really busy. We waited about a half hour before getting seated. No big deal. There were four of us and we got sat in a booth. I felt the booth was too small. Especially the table. When the two large pizzas came out and were placed on our table, one of the pans was sticking in my face the whole time. I couldn't move it because there was nowhere else to move it to.  We had the BJ Specialty (?) and the Sweet Pig. I actually liked the crust on them. They were light and doughy. The toppings were good. I prefer pizza with tomato sauce than chunks of tomato. I don't know if that's because I'm used to 'low grade' pizza than 'gourmet' pizza, but that's how I like it. Evenso, I ate two pieces of each style and was full.  We also ordered one of those Pizookie things. It was pretty rich and like a previous reviewer said, you can easily make this at home. The only draw back to that would be you would eat too much of it. According to the nutrition facts that are in BJ's Menu, the Pizookie that we ordered consisted of 4,219 calories! Yikes! Oh well, gotta indulge occasionally. I got my chocolate fix, so I was happy.  Service was passable. Our waiter didn't seem too happy. There was a cute Hispanic waitress that I wish had our section, but that's the way it goes. Anyways, the waiter did everything we asked of him even though he wasn't very enthusiastic.  Truthfully, I think I would only come to BJ's if someone wanted to go there. It wouldn't be my decision. I don't have anything against them, but saying ""How about BJ's"" to a bunch of guy friends is just too weird. Girls, different story."
Jonathan L.,"Garden Grove, CA",482,64,,5.0,6/14/2010,I went here with my girlfriend and it was a very yummy place :]. I got the Buffalo Chicken Pizza which was very delicious and then had the famous Pizookie which i tried a while back. Its been a while but Pizookie never lets me down. I love this place the only problem is its kinda pricey but its worth it i guess :]
R T.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,113,31,1.0,5/4/2010,"Mediocre chain food laden with sauces, fat, & sodium. My wife and I ate lunch here today because she got a teacher appreciation coupon. I ordered the Salmon Teriyaki and she ordered the Chicken Parmesan. My Salmon would have been ok if they hadn't drenched the plate with teriyaki sauce. I couldn't taste anything but the sauce... The chicken parm was pretty good, but they ruined the pasta with a sauce that was so spicy it made it inedible to both of us... Typical American chain restaurant that tries to make mediocre food better by hiding it in sauces, fat and salt instead of original recipes and fresh ingredients and herbs. BJ's doesn't even list the nutritional content of their food anywhere because it is SOOO BAD for you... ugg..."
