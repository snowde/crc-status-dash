Quoc P.,"Arcadia, CA",19,13,,3.0,10/21/2012,"BJ's is a pretty solid place.  I prefer it over other chains like Chili's or TGI Fridays.  It is a safe choice for meeting up with friends because of the variety of food that they have.  I especially like going there to have a few beers and watch football or basketball games.  They have plenty of TV screens everywhere, so that is great.  That being said, I think their pizza is a bit on the average side, considering that is their specialty.  Perhaps it is because I usually prefer NY style pizza over the Chicago deep dish.  Still, the pizza gets cold fast and doesn't taste so great cold.  And it's the rare pizza that doesn't taste better in the morning the next day.  It's not a terrible pizza, just not great considering the alternatives out there.  Pizzookie (the famous ice cream on a warm cookie) are totally great though!  Service is usually very friendly and helpful.  However, it can get really busy on the weekends and so they might forget to check in on you."
Eddie C.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,48,,5.0,10/22/2010,"I ate here yesterday and I liked it. I have eaten here in the past, but it was a while ago. The pizza is great; get the small if it is for yourself only. The bathrooms were clean and the service was great! We had Kyle as our waiter and he was great! Very friendly, and my iced tea was always refilled. Thanks Kyle!!!"
Daniel S.,"Salem, OR",82,115,7,5.0,1/18/2007,"I will preface this review with this. *MY WIFE HATES DOUGHY PIZZA!* With that said she loves BJ's Chicago style pizza.  It's our favorite pizza to eat and the price is right.  We can get a small pizza, caesar salad, a beer, and another drink for under $25.  And when we leave we are fully satisfied with the size of our meal.  We usually order the veggie combination with extra sauce and it always comes out great.  I've tried most of their beers and my favorite is the Hefewiezen, but I'm a big fan of Hefe's.  Also one of my wife's favorite things to get there is the Framboise that they have, it's a delicious Belgium beer that has berry added to it after the brewing process. The atmosphere is that of a sports bar if you are sitting in the main area next to the bar, they have a large screen that shows 4 sports channels at the same time.  Appetizers are great, with my favorite being the avocado eggrolls and the spinach with artichoke dip. We have never had any issues with the wait staff and they have always been able to handle any special requests we make in the years we have gone here."
Hang T.,"Long Beach, CA",50,53,12,3.0,3/15/2009,"I'm been to this restaurant a couple of times, but it's not on my list of favorites.  Last night I went and all I got was mac and cheese with added bacon. The portion was decent for a kids size meal, but I swear that the mac and cheese was from Krafts which disappointed me, because I could have made that at home.  My boyfriend got the California burger with fries, and my brother got the California Chicken Club with wedges.  It was practically the same meal except for one was beef and the other was chicken.  Oh, and if you you do eat here, don't get the garlic cheese bread.  It's $4.50 for four small pieces of bread with a little garlic butter on it; waste of money.  The service wasn't bad, but it took forever from the appetizers to main course to arrive. So to recap: mac and cheese-made from Krafts, garlic cheese bread-wasted of money, service-okay."

Cayleen O.,"Costa Mesa, CA",202,84,3,2.0,7/22/2007,"Great food, great service.  Shxt for brains when it comes to reservations. When it comes to popular chain restaurants I'd highly recommend making reservations especially for a Thursday, Friday, or Saturday night.  But I'm sorry to say that this probably won't help you if you have a large party reservation. I made reservations for 8 oclock for a party of 10 the day before.  We were celebrating my boyfriends 21st so imagine how relieved I was to have it at such a casual spot. They called the next morning to confirm my reservation and I asked to change the party size to 15 since more of his friends confirmed. We're at the front desk at 7:45 to make our presence known and they tell me that the reservation says 6 butt fxck oclock earlier that evening.  WHAT??????????????????????? 10+ friends and acquaintances stand with me and I am baffled with the mix up. I'm sorry, excuse me...  WHAT?!??!?! AGAIN I SAY WHAT??????? They tell me that they'll seat the party as soon as possible but they just seated a party of 30 and a party of 40 in the semi-private rooms meant to accomodate 15+ customers. So, one of the party members theory was that they bumped my reservation intentionally to make room for the larger party. That is bull shxt. So after an hour of waiting (and three party members leave) we are seated.  I ask to speak to the manager after dealing with the man at the front desk unfortunate enough to have to deal with me.  He handled me very professionally and apologized for the screw up. I did not in fact take my anger out on him because twas not his fault. Though I did ask the manager for some free appetizers for the inconvenience and the long wait. Bomb diggity he hooked it up and apologized. From then on the evening was redeemed by our awesome waitress who dealt with 15 ferociously hungry young adults. The combo appetizer platter was bomb.  DEFINITELY try the avocado egg roll things as a starter.  You won't regret it.  & you can almost NEVER go wrong ordering their pizza.  My favorite?  The BBQ chicken melts my heart every dxmn time. Free appetizers, great beer/drinks, and great food still didn't make up for the mix up. 2 stars."
Heather A.,"Huntington Beach, CA",35,79,13,1.0,6/16/2011,"I am extremely frustrated and disappointed with the food I received from BJ's delivery. I've ordered many times and my order has never been this bad. I've ordered the California chicken sandwich many times before, but this time it was missing the chilies and had nasty barely cooked bacon and wilty lettuce on it which should NOT be on that sandwich in the first place. The chili and cheese baked potato had barely any topping on it whatsoever, nothing like the picture. You would probably be completely embarrassed to bring that to a customer actually sitting at the restaurant. The buffalo wings were completely plain with no sauce on them!!!! The menu says they are drizzled in sauce, with sauce on the side for dipping. Who wants plain chicken? I could have gotten that at KFC. To top it all off the extra ranch that was ordered was forgotten as well, even though she read my order back to me. I cannot believe I paid 40 dollars for this! It leaves you with such a bad feeling spending so much and not getting what you order and there's no one that can fix it for you. I haven't been this disappointed by a restaurant in so long. I'm sure my little problem doesn't mean anything to such a huge company. But hopefully something can change, because they've definitely lost a few frequent customers."
A Y.,"Glendale, AZ",16,238,14,4.0,12/17/2009,"Best chain out there. BJ's delivers quality deep dish pizza and hearty salads. Nothing on the menu has let me down yet. The honorable mention goes to the fried avocado eggrolls. Crunchy on the outside and smooth melt-in-your-mouth on the inside. Add a generous dollop of dressing and you're in heaven! The honey chicken salad is also highly recommended. To finish your meal, order a pazookie, it'll give you sweet dreams at night. Come between meal times to avoid the crowd."
Robert M.,"Corona Del Mar, CA",1725,1258,47,4.0,9/18/2009,"Great late night happy hour-- this place was surprisingly busy on a Thursday night!  Great service and the food here is always good, although don't expect top notch gourmet food."
Matt S.,"Whittier, CA",0,25,3,1.0,6/8/2012,"Food was acceptable but at those prices I expect much better service. Our servers forgot everything, drinks, utensils and soups. When we reminded them for our soups they said ""they'll make sure to add that to our bill"" wtf? We already ordered the soups. They acted very rude and oblivious to their jobs. Food was ok and the bus boys were on the ball, the waiters/waitress staff awful."
Kevin L.,"Westminster, CA",750,68,9,4.0,1/2/2010,"I've been here on numerous occasions and i have yet to have a bad complaint about this place. I usually don't have to wait long for a table, and service is generally good. Food is decent for what you pay for and the drinks are good. I think the one thing anyone really ever comes here for is their world-famous pazookies. My friend and I shared the Triple Chocolate Pazookie. OMG! So decadent and rich! It had rich, ghiradelli chocolate ice cream, over a warm, oven baked chocoate cookie with bits of ghiradelli chocolate baked in with chunks of ghiradelli chocolate sprinkled on top. HEAVEN!!!"
Gary S.,"Bluffton, SC",7,62,,5.0,9/19/2012,"2x there= wedge salad B+, clam chowder A , pizza A, dessert A. i'll b back."
Shane D.,"Torrance, CA",32,10,21,4.0,7/9/2012,"Went this last Saturday for Linner (in between lunch and dinner). The service was quick and the food was really good. I enjoyed the Chicken a la Fresca, and my wife had the Mediterranean Pizza. While it is always loud sitting near the bar I am still glad they recently added more booths with much more seating in that section. I used to avoid Bj's because they always had a huge wait and I totally think the extra seating is helping. Overall the only thing you still can't get my kids to eat are the Happy Face fries... The rest of the food was really tasty."
Mac N.,"Orange County, CA",345,309,5,5.0,4/2/2009,"I absolutely love this place. There are 2 happy hours everyday here. The one at night is always happenin'. Appetizers and drinks are discounted a few dollars during the happy hours. Desserts are to die for. Get the pizookie, u wont be let down. Lots of flat screens to watch sports on. Lots of cool people.."
May N.,"Westminster, CA",0,2,,3.0,8/24/2012,"okay, let's see. i went with two friends and it took us about 15 minutes to get seated. i'm not complaining. our server didn't seem to want to be there, i don't know, maybe she was having a bad day. well i asked her what kind of deep dish pizza was popular and she recommended the buffalo chicken, so i ordered that. it was OVER SEASONED. omg, i hate water but i downed the water cause it was so salty. and my friend had a clam chowder bread bowl and to her dismay, there was barely any clamchowder. i mean the bread bowl looks pretty big, there should be a decent amount of clam chowder in it... but nopee. no complaints about the burger tho. to end our night, we got a pizookie trio. we ordered 3 different ones but when we got it, we had 3 of the same one even after the server double checked on our order. however, she corrected the mistake and we got 3 more pizookie. most likely why i gave then the extra star because the main entree is definately 2 star. thank god i love dessert that much."
Jim S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",543,64,15,3.0,2/11/2012,"I'm a fan because of the food but on the other hand I've been displeased with the service here multiple times. Like someone else said below . . . your service depends on the server you get and not the consistency of Bj's. I've had great servers and some who are definitely not so great : /  Also, my fiance and I made reservations here for my birthday once and they forgot/didn't write down our reservation. We ended up waiting a long time and it was a downer on the birthday fun. I tried making another reservation for my fiance's birthay and they gave me a hard time about making a reservation for 10 people because they had another reservation for 100 people. The food is good but not as good as TGI Fridays in my personal opinion and the service always varries but if you want to go to a place with a fun atmosphere that's in a good location, then this is the place. Last note, the downtown HB Bj's gets the same review except with much worse service!"
Phil L.,"Huntington Beach, CA",446,81,6,4.0,9/9/2009,best restaurant pizza money can buy. my favorite is the meat lover or the buffalo wing pizza. they also have the BEST strawberry lemonade around. and for desert (must have) order the pazooki...its a personal sized cookie with your choice of ice cream on top. THE BOMB! expect to spend at least $15 a person.
Stephanie R.,"Huntington Beach, CA",130,234,44,1.0,7/21/2009,"Hmmmmmmmm.....? mixed feelings here.  I have been here many, MANY times! And this is my first really, REALLY bad experience.  So tonight I have decided this will be my last time I subject myself to mediocre, overpriced food served by pushy, unpleasant servers.  My experience started off with a short 15 minute wait for our table (no biggie.) From there, we waited another 15 minutes for a server to greet us (NOT COOL.) The server who greeted us, told us she wasn't our waitress but would take our drink order (and after 15 minutes of waiting around) our dinner order. After taking our order we waited yet another 10 minutes to get our drinks, while in the meantime, my salad makes it out before my drink does. So I awkwardly scarf down my salad (which I found 1 moldy crouton in it) as my dinner-mates sat with no drinks staring at me. When our drinks finally came out, our food came out literally moments later. (whatever, again, no biggie) Okay... this is the part that pissed me off. My dinner-mates and I were not even half way done with our meals and she asked us if we wanted dessert (as if she wanted to get us out of there), we politely responded that we didn't know yet because we weren't close to finishing our meals yet. She responded by saying that she will just leave the check and if we wanted anything else to ""holler"" for her. Not even 5 minutes later, she asked AGAIN, if we wanted any dessert. We ended up responding yes, just because it was my cousin's birthday, for which we got a free pazookie (only highlight of the night.) No joke, from the moment the pazookie hit the table, we were harassed 3 times for the bill, even though she could plainly see we still had food on our table and 3/4 full beers on the table. Now, I usually am very lenient with service, because I had been a server for over 4 years. But there really was no excuse for her pushy service, because she was still taking tables, it wasn't like we were her last table or being over demanding or anything.  Bottom line; food is always consistently average and overpriced, service HAD been great, up until now.  Count me out!"
David G.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,4,,1.0,2/16/2014,"Decent food awful service.  We ordered salads and entrees, 20 minutes later with no contact from our server the entrees showed up.  We told the girl who brought them (not our server) to make sure the salads were removed from our bill, she said she'd bring them, we said forget it, just take them off.  About 5 minutes later our server shows up with our salads.  The manager came over and offered to comp us a desert because of the error, I thanked him and said great.  After our meal was done we ordered a pizookie which took a good 15 minutes to show up, again not brought by our server.  At this point we were going to guess how much the check was and throw down the cash and leave, but our sever showed up with the check just as I was pulling out my wallet.....we were charged for the desert but the server was already gone, and I had already spent an hour too long getting crapped on.  Paid for it and won't be going back, not even on a bet."
Brian S.,"Westminster, CA",112,4,,4.0,5/31/2010,"As a 15 year old boy, i need three things entertainment, food, and girls. Its hard to find a place where all that can be provided, luckily for me BJ's is around the corner and can provide all that  for me. I always try to find an opportunity to go out and eat there, wither its with my family or my buddies from high school. When ever I go there i always get the pizza."
