Karen W.,"Costa Mesa, CA",1,30,,1.0,1/2/2014,"Probably our last trip to Bj's and we've been going to this one since they opened! To begin with, the manage at the front desk tried to dissuade us from using a $10 off that we had as part of the rewards program. She told us we had a PIZOOKIE' coming--covering up the place on the card that said $10 off!! The menus were ripped halfway up the middle to start with. Service was incredibly slow, the waitress was not friendly at all and didn't even tell us her name. We ordered our food, medium pizza, garlic bread which is what we usually order. The garlic bread comes out within 10 mins as a rule.......not this time. It didn't come and it didn't come. I knew something was up. Pizza came out about 25 mins later with a plate of what looked like little hard planks of bread with some mozzarella melted on top. We said to her ""this isn't the garlic bread we always get"" and proceeded to describe what we wanted. She went back to the back and came out 5 mins later saying ""This is the only bread we have, we don't carry any other kind"". Keep in mind, my son had had the regular garlic bread less than a month before. Got done with the pizza, sat a good 10 mins more before she noticed us and brought us a box for leftovers. Sat a good 10 mins more before she brought the bill. This was at 3:30 on a Thursday afternoon, it was dead. They weren't busy at all. I can't blame this all on the waitress, obviously management is oblivious to how far this particular Bj's has fallen as far as service, the ripped menus, and food offerings to long, and loyal customers. Will not go back there again"
Cam T.,"Tustin, CA",0,28,,4.0,10/9/2009,"I went to this BJ's last night with co-workers for a birthday celebration.  We wanted to sit in the bar for happy hour, but all the large tables were full.  If you are planning on going for happy hour with a big group, get there early.  I was really surprised by how small the bar area is - this is a brewery, right???  Anyway, our server was really cool when we explained the situation.  He talked to the hostess and moved us into a little dining room off the bar so we could still take advantage of the happy hour deals.  Food was good, and I highly recommend the berry cider.  Thanks to BJ's for making the extra effort for us!"
Brendan C.,"Cypress, CA",2,8,,5.0,1/14/2012,Great deep dish pizza and amazing pizookies!  need I say more?  Good for dates but make sure to get reservations.
Melani B.,"Huntington Beach, CA",25,39,2,4.0,11/20/2008,"Best place to have great beer, glorious pizza, and the best pazookie! Love the place, the people and the prices!"
Trang D.,"Costa Mesa, CA",31,31,8,4.0,9/3/2009,"Most people go here for the pizza but I'm personally not a big fan of it.  I love having lots of pizza sauce but they're stingy with it.  However, I am a huge fan of the Cajun Chicken Pasta and pizookie!  I will go here for those two items and wait for as long as it'll take.  Not many people are familiar with the pasta but loved it when they tried some of mine.  The place has a lot of TV's to watch sports and a decent-sized bar, creating a fun and enjoyable environment.  There's also a nice patio and the restaurant is always packed.  I just had my birthday here and we had some good times. Recommendations: - Cajun Chicken Pasta (w/Grilled Chicken) - Chocolate Chip Pizookie - Spinach Artichoke Dip"
Quynh Tram T.,"Huntington Beach, CA",86,261,98,4.0,5/20/2011,"Can't believe I've been coming here for over 10 years! I love BJ's for their selection of food,  I always want to eat everything on the menu! BJ's is known for their brewery and pizookis! For your birthday, they will give a tiny one for free (the size is actually really cute). From 3-7, and 10-closing, they have a happy hour special if you sit in the bar area (at the bar and the tables close by counts, too). Parking can get super hectic 'cause they share it with Party City. They do offer curbside service, where you call to do a pick-up order, then call them to let them know you're on the way and they will come out and hand it to you while you're in the car (they have a couple of spots designated in the front of the restaurant for this kind of service). On busy days and if you don't want to wait, you can tell them that you want to sit in the patio and you will most likely get a seat right away!"
Karen S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",164,182,101,4.0,6/17/2008,"im sorry but this bjs is wayyyyyyyyy better than the one on main street. this is for two reasons 1) it isnt on main street and 2) they have a full bar. ive never had bad waiter service but i have had a few mess ups with orders before. a little know fact about this restaurant: they deliver in the area, YUM. ive had almost all of their salads and they are equally good to wash down with a berry or pear cider. i never forget to order a pizzoki either!"
Stephanie B.,"Huntington Beach, CA",1,30,11,1.0,7/11/2009,"Ew!! This place is horrible. Im originally from Fresno Ca. They have a BJ's and its AWESOME. I was so excited when I found this one here in Huntington and have given it about 4 tries... (Reeeaaalllyy hopeful they'd finally get it right, but NOPE). BJ's pizza is famous, yet this place cant seem to get it down right!!! What gives. Its always real doughy and has about a tsp of sauce on it :/ I've given up on this place, I'll go to the BJ's in Fresno when I go visit."
Ed L.,"Orange County, CA",0,44,,4.0,12/25/2011,happy hour specials are awesome. i can't ever order a bj's pazookie w/o smirking though. delicious!
Erik S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",8,52,,4.0,4/20/2010,"I love coming to BJs for either lunch or dinner.  i mostly come here for dinner, more than lunch.  It gets very very crowded, and the wait is usually up to about 45-60 minutes (and has been longer).  And parking is hell in that lot.  But I expect that.  However, their Brewhouse Blonde and their food is excellent and worth the wait.  I usually get their pasta dishes, with a caeser salad as a starter.  They make them really well.  And their service is great too.  I always get great service here.  I have also had their burgers, which are also really good.  Finally, there is the pizookie!!  My most favorite is the macadamia nut one.  But if you have a chocolate craving, then get the Chocolate chip on."
Jon O.,"Santa Ana, CA",222,275,,4.0,2/27/2008,"I probly don't have much new to say that hasn't already been said, but wtheck. I used to be a student at GWC and took some lovely classes like anatomy and microbiology at night cause that was the only time I could find a class with any openings by the time I could sign up for em, so this place actually became a good spot to hit after class ended around 10. One could get a mini pizza (or 2) for 1/2 price (only in the bar) and their coffee is actually quite good, on the strong side, but no complaints bout that from me..so I would come here and refuel and re-write my lecture notes or get organized from whatever was covered in class earlier that evening.  So if any students are taking night classes at GWC, this might be a decent option. Pizza is pretty consistently good and they are definitely one of the better nationwide chains and of course thier famous pizookie. I haven't been in awhile, might be time to refresh my memories---fortunately no anatomy or microbiology nightmare classes in my near future.... I don't think anyway."
B R.,"Garden Grove, CA",3,24,4,4.0,2/24/2009,"Great place to have some good food and watch the game! Great place for groups and kids. It's loud in there so if you have a noisy 2 yr old, no sweat! Love the beer...try the BJs Blonde. YUM!"
Lilo G.,"Orange, CA",0,11,,4.0,6/28/2011,"i love this place! i like that this place closes late so when i'm feeling for a hefeweizen at the end of the night, i usually come here with my gfs. i have a few favorites also, which are the bruchettas, deep dish pizzas, clam chowder, jambalaya, and the desserts!! particularly pizookies and the benets. i never get tired of it and the ambience is great too! i just hope the workers can be more friendly. the only thing they lack in is their welcoming and friendly customer service. a lot of them never bother to smile and eye contact would be nice too!  well at least they help me out in spending less money on tip! but i don't care about them, cuz the food is great!!!"
Kim D.,"Garden Grove, CA",11,90,5,5.0,9/4/2007,"This place has really good food. Their lasagna is really tasty! I love their baby back ribs, so tender and juicy! My favorite side dish is garlic mashed potatoes! I can't find another place that compares to their mashed potatoes! The only negative thing is their waiting line...can range anywhere from 20-1 hr. depending on when you go. Other than that, the food and service is great. I wouldn't mind waiting that long cause the food is so good!"
Jennifer M.,"Westminster, CA",36,172,33,5.0,4/10/2007,"Everything I have ever tried here has been delish! I love their Berry burst cider, most of the beers, and who can forget their famous pizookie! There are very good deals at happy hour, but get there early because tables fill up very fast. This is always a favorite of my friends and I and it is always a great time!"
Brianna V.,"Huntington Beach, CA",2,68,4,2.0,10/15/2010,"First I have to say out waiter was kind of a airheadish guy. He seemed like he thought he was so cute that no one would care if he was attentive with service or not. He did not have that kind of looks to be getting by on in my opinion he should step it way up if he wants to earn any money. He asked us if we wanted to order our entree when we ordered our appetizer. Um ok does that mean they come out around the same time ? he said no but of course he did. Then we asked for desert menus and he just came back and asked what we wanted and I'm thinking um hello are you stoned we asked for the menu. Idk if they are supposed to have bussers but he bussed our table in a poor fashion. Whatever. And we ordered the most chocolate rich thing for desert and had to flag him down to re ask for water. The food was ok, pizza is the thing to get here. They have tons of other stuff but don't bother with anything containing shrimp here as its frozen not fresh. bleh. And the chicken in lettuce wraps was watery. Do get the Mozzarella sticks, spinach dip, wedge fries. The pizzas are a do but don't bother with the chicken dishes, I think most of their meat is frozen. Do get the pizookie but if your waiter is an airhead he won't warn you that its incredibly, remarkably hot and served in a hot pan. Thanks guy."
Kristy M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",32,16,,5.0,2/13/2007,"Yum.  I love this place.   Everything I have ever tried on the menu has been excellent, from their wedge salad, loaded baked potato, pasta, chicken fried steak to the ever popular pizookie for dessert.  I'm not real crazy about their own brews, but the margaritas are pretty damned tasty.  Love the atmosphere, and the service is usually pretty good."
Jim S.,"San Jose, CA",1,28,,3.0,1/5/2008,"Restaurant...check.   Brewhouse....ehhh...not so much.  Sure they have some stainless steel vats in a room in the corner that ""look"" like they brew there...but they don't.  So don't go there thinking it's an actually working brewpub.  Sorry, had to get that off my chest.  The beer here (which always should be of top priority), is OK.  Their darker ones are better (porter and stout) but none of them really blow my socks off.  The food is pretty decent actually, especially their pizzas which are their specialty.  I enjoy their BBQ chicken pizza the best.  Oh, and for whatever reason, their Caesar salad tends to be really good too...go figure!   Service is so so.  Last time i was there the waiter tried to hit on my friend (who wasn't interested) and then our service noticably declined after she said that she wasn't thrilled with his suggestion for beer.  But other than that, they're usually pretty good.   Pizookie is a must, like everyone else says too...but make sure you have someone to share it with as it's a lot of sugary, fattening glory in a pizza pan."
Kim N.,"Orange County, CA",174,309,12,3.0,1/7/2008,"Sat at the bar to watch a football game and got pretty good service.  Was approached immediately for our drink orders, was visited upon soon thereafter for our food orders.  Food came out promptly.  However, we weren't asked if everything was okay and had to flag down the barback for waters.  Food was not bad.  I've had better lettuce wraps, and the pasta was pretty standard.  I've been to a BJ's before though and had awesome service and food there."
Anne T.,"Garden Grove, CA",0,7,11,2.0,1/7/2011,"I went here for lunch a few weeks ago, a late lunch.  Think it was about 1:45pm-2:00pm.  It wasn't very busy.  We waited for like 10minutes for our table, there was only 3 adults and 2 kids, they gave us a HUGE table, I think that table can probably fit 8 average adult.  I was hungry and that wasn't the end of the world so I didn't ask to move or anything.  We sat down and it took about 5 minutes before we got acknowledge.  Our server finally greeted us...got our drink orders and left again.   I was starting to get irritated.  He came back w/our drinks and took our order.  My sisters and I all order salads and soup before our meal, it took him another 10 minutes before they came.  I didn't want to say anything cuz I know that sometimes after the lunch rush they have less server on and they're probably busy.  It probably took another 15 minutes before our food came.  Another table who came in after us got their food before us...the party was smaller by only 1 person, I am disappointed w/the visit this time but just wanted to eat and go back to the hospital.  Then my sister started to eat and realized that her dish was wrong.  She asked for fettuccine noodles instead of spaghetti noodles.  When the server finally came back we told him and he looked in his book and said, ""oh yes, you did."". He had he kitchen remake it and all but when he repeated her order he had the modification down...so I'm not sure why it was made wrong.  I'll give it that it was probably the kitchen's fault.  It took him another 10minutes for the kitchen to remake it.  After our food was served (minus my sister) we had to bother other srvers and the food runner to grab us condiments and to refill our water.  We all shared w/her while she waited.  She was full and we had it boxed up by the time she came back.  The manager never stopped by and the dish was never taken off the check.  This visit was not pleasant at all compared to our last visit.  I still gave it 2 star becuase the food was still good."
