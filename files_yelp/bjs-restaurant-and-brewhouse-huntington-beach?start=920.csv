Betty M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",3,9,,3.0,4/21/2011,"Food is always good, service always bad.  I have a 5 year old and a 2 year old so eating out is a little challenging as you parents know.  Every time we go we wait for like 10 minutes, I always have to get the host to get our server another 5-10 minutes go by before they even get to our table.  When the food comes it is wonderful the whole family loves it but to wait 15 minutes to get served then another 15 to get food with 2-4 kids is a LONG time.  Oh did I mention they were out of crayons and the womens bathroom needed a serious cleaning.  All in all if you are in no rush and want good food go to Bj's don't expect to much from the service end though..."
Epi I.,"West Sacramento, CA",3,391,1,1.0,12/7/2009,"I came here with my buddy.  It wasn't our first time dining here.  First, we sat at the bar to wait for our table and while we were waiting we purchased a beer each and paid for them.  then while we were still working on our beers our buzzard went off for us to claim our dining table so we signaled our waitress tha we're on our way to our table.  We sit down and ordered our meal.  At the beginning our server asked us if we paid for our beers.  We said yes and we showed the receipt to the server.  Then we finished our 1st beer and ordered a 2nd...now at our dining table.  So, we finished our food and our 2nd beer and we get our bill and there were 2 beers on this bill.  I wasn't about to have it so I called the server and asked WTF.  She said she remembered us showing her a receipt for the 1st beer but the bar tender had added the 1st beer on our bill.  I questioned our server because she was the one who saw our receipt for the 1st beer as we were sitting at our dining table.  Well, she played the dumb shit and said she didn't know, etc.  Anyway, I went over to the bar tender and told him what had happened.  He argued w/me.  I sat down at my table and told our server I needed to speak to the manager.  The manager didn't apologize for the obvious error and said she'd take our drinks off our bill.  I was so upset that I didn't argue anymore.  I got home and wrote a letter to the company.  Well, after all someone acknowledged seeing how an error could've happened but by then it was too late.  I will never return to BJ's.  I was a regular here.  It's obvious to me they don't care about customer services here.   Needless to say I've never been back.  THIS PLACES S-U-C-K-S!!"
Becky T.,"Bethesda, MD",167,446,4,3.0,2/14/2007,The food is mediocre.  But the pizzookie is heavenly!  I would go there anytime just for that dessert.  There's nothing better than the hot chocolate chip cookie out of the oven that is topped with vanilla ice cream.  I wish I could get one right now.  If only I was in California again...
Steph M.,"San Francisco, CA",109,256,157,5.0,1/15/2007,"1 party sized plazookie platter, with 4 flavors of warm cookie the size of a pizza, topped with a mountain of vanilla bean ice cream = heaven."
Chris G.,"Concord, CA",474,562,367,4.0,2/1/2008,"I've been to other BJ's before, but this one had great service.  Our server Roxy was very attentive and always smiling and made small talk.  I was there for my birthday with my 3 other co-workers who also like to drink various beverages. Well one of them got the 4 beer tastings.  Since they didn't like one ""said it had no taste and was too fruity"" (this coming from an woman). Well Roxy changed it out without a thought.   Overall I enjoyed the service and even when the manager thought we brought alcohol to the place which we didn't, (It was Kahlua chocolate sauce) the manager just laughed and said so is it good? Which replied hell yeah!"
Erik J.,"Costa Mesa, CA",6,83,37,4.0,7/30/2006,"great pizza, pizookie for dessert (deep dish pizza cookie) and a decent assortment of beers.  i wish i could say i liked their home brews more than i do.  the pirana pale ale is decent though.  them make a good root beer too i make a fair amount of pizzas back home and i use bj's as my benchmark.  until i can match their yumminess i'll keep coming back. i recommend the bbq chicken pizza or the bj's favorite.  oh, the menu is different from restaurant to restaurant so give them all a try."
jessica h.,"Livermore, CA",23,138,2,4.0,9/14/2009,"my grandmother had her 75th b-day lunch here with our whole family, we had a huge table in front area of the restaurant to accommodate everyone. the food and drinks were good and the servers extremely friendly. they did a great job keeping drinks full and orders straight! all and all we had a great time here and my grandma seemed to enjoy it all!"
kelly c.,"Anaheim, CA",58,9,,1.0,4/18/2012,"Ive never had an issue at another restaurant from this chain until this week. I went to two locations and had issues but I will only put my issue with this location here..seeing as it was the worse. I brought a group of 9 women here last Friday night. We ordered drinks, entrees and a large pizookie. We were there almost 2 hours. A manager came over and asked us if we knew we had been there for almost 2 hours. We were a little dumbfounded by the question and not sure why he was telling us that.  He repeated himself a few times and the girl he was telling this to told him we were waiting for the bill. He then nodded to some guys who started rearranging all of the tables around us and scooting us out. I have never had this happen. We never once had a lull in our ordering. We were constantly getting drinks, food, and dessert and then promptly paid for our tab. It was very rude and this happened to be a bachelorette party. I then tried to get the managers name and he hid from us. I will be calling today to get his name to further complain to corporate. They may be getting 9 phone calls at this point since we were all upset about it."
Sean S.,"Brookings, OR",6,31,,4.0,11/3/2009,"this place is great. they have great pizza and pasta and even very reasonably priced lunch specials. i went there for lunch today and tried the lunch portion of the fetticini alfredo. it came with a small salad and portion size was perfect. pasta was really good but a little heavy on the alfredo sauce. the server was very attentive and came back  frequently. they also have a little patio to eat on which is very pleasant. i also was able to try the new seasonal beer pumpkin ale. this beer is awesome, if you are a fan of heffiwizen and stronger beers then this is the beer for you.  a definite must go,,,-    a side note is that if you go here for dinner try to go early as this place fills up and gets really crowded for dinner."
Jennifer V.,"Fountain Valley, CA",6,15,,5.0,6/1/2008,chardonnay shrimp pasta is the only thing i order here! it's not too heavy and has the right amount of sauce...=)
Michael T.,"Orange County, CA",33,49,69,5.0,12/20/2006,"I gotta give this place 5 stars.  The wings are pretty tasty... crispy outside and drizzled with buffalo sauce and ranch dressing, served with extra sides of buffalo sauce and ranch.  Their late night happy hour (10-midnight) is $1 off all pints, $2 off appetizers, and 50% off all mini pizzas!  Freakin' sweet.  Get the BBQ chicken pizza with pineapple and BBQ sauce instead of pizza sauce.  Damn good eatin'.  There's 5 tv screens behind the bar and a few more located strategically around the restaurant so you can catch the game while sipping on their homemade brews.  They only serve their house beers, but for about $7 you can get the sampler and decide which one is your favorite.  They also have an excellent draught rootbeer that they serve in a frosty mug if you're the DD.  I can't rate the rest of the restaurant, but my experience at the bar has been pretty awesome.  Make sure you save room for their pizzookie!"
Jennifer N.,"Sunset Beach, CA",71,517,27,2.0,7/1/2008,has anyone ever noticed that the pizookie takes on the flavor of the metal pan it's cooked in?  it's NOT that great.  the only thing i like is their thin crust appetizer pizza.
