Brandon S.,"Ewa Beach, HI",0,29,,5.0,10/12/2017,Not to shabby. Great tasting food Great environment Great entertainment Cold beer Cold drinks and flavorful
Jammy S.,"Madison, AL",0,27,7,3.0,1/5/2018,"The atmosphere is great. The appetizers are good. There are plenty of TVs near the bar area to watch games.  I've had good service here as well. I mainly do not like the pizzas. On two separate occasions the deep dish pizzas were extremely bready, bland and luke warm. The margaritas I tried, a spicy jalapeño and regular one, tasted like sweet and sour pre-mix."
Bill B.,"Madison, AL",1930,478,1562,3.0,5/20/2017,"I visited BJ's on 5/18 at lunch.  I was greeted at the door and motioned that I would sit in the bar area. I found a table next to the server station and sat down. It took over 5 minutes for a server to greet me, provide a menu, and take my drink order even though the servers were visiting the server station just inches away from my table.  Once served the service was good and courteous. I ordered the Prime Rib Dip with Swiss cheese lunch special. While waiting for my order to arrive I enjoyed the big screen TVs in the bar area. The back wall contains the list of beers that they have on tap and I wish I could partake, but I had to return to work. I noticed an advertisement on the table for a new seasonable beer called Mad Crazy Mango IPA, again I wish I could try it.   My food arrived and it looked appealing even though the two sandwich sections appeared to be small. The Prime Rib was cooked medium rare and was very salty. The fries were average and the horseradish dip was good and I don't care for horseradish dip. Normally I don't mention the quality of the ice tea, but they have very good ice tea. It's not to light and not too dark. The price of my lunch special was high.  $20.93, before tip, is too high for a small Prime Rib Dip sandwich and an ice tea. The restaurant is very large and loud. I measured 73 dBs on my sound meter app. BJ's has a nice outdoor seating area and special Take-Out door on the side of the restaurant. Of course they have an on-site brewing operation."
Brenda D.,"Ardmore, TN",19,6,,1.0,12/20/2017,"I've had LOTS better. Turkey burger wasn't good, pasta was greasy, no Splenda and tea was old and bitter, had to ask for silverware. Not worth the price at all. Had to pay before I could see the bill. Not crowded at all."
Chris G.,"Huntsville, AL",39,6,2,1.0,1/6/2018,"I don't think my wife and I will ever go here again. Which is a shame. The food is so good and at a decent price. The reason we likely won't be back is the abysmal service. We've gone back over and over again hoping they'd be better, only to get let down. To provide an example, I'll describe our last visit which has been typical for the majority of our trips there. We go in, and I used the app to let them know we were coming. We got seated pretty quickly because they weren't very busy. But once at our table, we didn't see our waiter for 15 minutes for her to ask us for our drink order. Once we finally got our drinks, it was another 15+ minutes before we were even able to flag down our waiter to place our order. This whole time, I'm using my phone to time how long it takes for us to get our food because that's the worst thing, to be hungry and wait forever to get your food. And to state again, they weren't that busy, if they had been, it would have been understandable. We waited over 30 minutes for our food. The food was delivered and the waiter walked away before we could mention that we never got silverware. So we had to wait five minutes to even touch our food because we didn't have anything to eat it with. We maybe got one refill on our drinks this whole time, which was well over an hour and a half. The table next to us looked to be in the same situation. They waited forever for their food, and their faces reflected the same feelings as mine. This place is friendly, and has great food, but for the love of God, don't go there hungry, you'll wait forever to get your food."
Charnetta M.,"Huntsville, AL",189,177,1326,1.0,12/21/2016,"Joined my colleagues here for our Christmas lunch today. It was a full house but there didn't appear to be a wait. Service was a bit slow (on the kitchen's end) and it took about 30+ minutes for our food to come out. However, our server was nice and she kept the refills coming. I ordered the combo appetizer which cost approx $18. What I was served was not worthy of my $18 before the tip. The boneless buffalo chicken pieces was very salty. I requested for the buffalo sauce to come on the side and after tasting an overabundance of salt, just on the chicken, I opted out on using the sauce. I didn't want to add on any additional sodium.  The spinach and artichoke dip was ok.  Cheesesticks were cold and the cheese was stale & limp.  The avocado egg rolls was ok.  If I had to sum this meal up, I'd say the quality of this platter reminded me of the appetizers you buy in the frozen foods section of the grocery store. The chips that came with the spinach dip was the best tasting thing on my plate.  Overpriced for the quality. Subpar menu selection.  I'm ONLY giving a one star because of our server."
James S.,"Huntsville, AL",0,5,,2.0,10/13/2017,"We've been here several times and each time it is very busy.  Tonight, we did call ahead to check on wait times because we had 2 small children with us & needed to eat sooner than later.  She took my name but there was currently no wait ! We were walking from the H&M, so not far.  By the time we got there, a wait had started....we were told 15 minutes...40 minutes later we were seated. We would not have eaten there had we known the wait was the long with the children. I think everyone came at once, but overall service was slow, food was slow, dinner came out before our appetizer.  It was just a hot mess. We love their food, but for future reference, we'll tack on double the wait time they tell us because that has been consistent theme every time we come.   Isn't it better to over estimate than under?!"
Michael L.,"Ardmore, AL",8,103,58,4.0,5/4/2017,"Cocktails have become extremely inconsistent here, I keep giving this place a chance but they are loosing me. The wait staff is usually on top of thier game, so there are no complaints there. The kitchen is rather consistent in the food quality and temperature.  So they loose a star from me on the bar section, if they would get some consistency back that would be great."
Diane M.,"Oklahoma City, OK",27,4,10,5.0,11/15/2017,Great pizza and the only place we have found that has my boyfriends favorite beer (New Belgium 1554). The service is top notch.
Bailey B.,"Huntsville, AL",85,137,47,3.0,3/30/2017,"Boyfriend and I came in for the free Pizookie day--with a purchase of $9.95 or more you get a free Pizookie, which is a giant skillet cookie with two scoops of ice cream on top. The atmosphere at BJ's is very inviting and attractive.  I enjoyed that. I also really liked our waiter.  I did not catch his name, but he was a taller black man wearing glasses.  He had a nice smile and pleasant demeanor.  He brought us our silverware (the hostess forgot), made sure to ask us the order in which we wanted our food to be brought out, and was prompt about refilling our beverages. The menu was...confusing?  Appetizers, then like 3 pages worth of alcoholic beverages, then soups and salads, then pizza, then entrees, then lunch specials.  It's massive and a little overwhelming and not set up very well, in my opinion.  It's also a shame that many of the lunch offerings aren't available at dinner; I saw many dishes I would have rather had but were only served during lunch hours.  The lunch specials look like a good deal; dinner prices were a little high (in my opinion...perhaps not, though, as it is a kind of upscale location).   My boyfriend liked the beer he drank.  The food was only so-so, however.  We started with mozzarella sticks and sriracha queso and chips.  The mozzarella sticks themselves were tasty, if a little lightly breaded, but the marinara sauce was oddly sweet and not super appetizing.  The queso had good flavor but was a little congealed (had to mix it up in order to reach a desired consistency).  The chips themselves were too small.  We split the chicken and broccoli fettuccine.  It tasted good, but would have been much better if it had come out hotter -- as served, it was lukewarm.  Our waiter brought us two garlic knots instead of one, since we were sharing.  A nice touch, and the bread was obviously fresh and piping hot.  Best part of the main meal.   The Pizookie was outstanding, though.  There's almost nothing better than a fresh baked cookie with ice cream.  I'm not sure I'll be back to try another main course, but I'm definitely coming for another Pizookie."
N L.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",2,22,1,1.0,12/27/2017,"They'll tell you that your order will take ""10-15 minutes"" and then they'll bring it 35 minutes later. They gave stupid excuses as to why the order took forever. If you're actually hungry and want good service, go somewhere else."
Timothy N.,"Cincinnati, OH",2,13,26,3.0,8/1/2017,"I ordered the penne pasta with shrimp and asparagus. This dish had very little shrimp and even less asparagus. I've had better meals here but I'll not order this dish again. The taste was good though and the marinara sauce comes through. For me though, this was a disappointing dish. The beer selection and the drink selection are very good, so three stars for that."
Bryan B.,"Madison, AL",0,3,,2.0,12/22/2017,"Horrible service but decent food. We waited over 20 minutes for our server to ask what we wanted to drink. We ordered our food at the same time to expedite the process and three out of five items came to the table incorrectly. When I told the server my daughters soup was wrong, he didn't want to correct the situation. The manager ""spoke"" with the waitress but it didn't change anything. We will not be coming back"
Charles W.,"Fairfax, VA",36,2,,4.0,11/9/2017,"Alex was a Fantastic bartender and waiter. sat at the bar, ordered food and had adult beverages. The kitchen had some hiccups regarding the temperature of the steak. No fault of Alex. The steak came back out perfect and I know it was because the waiter made sure if it. Thanks for the service and good attitude. The bar staff (also took food orders for bar patrons) as a whole seemed on point. Thanks and I would visit again and recommend this particular BJ's."
Donna B.,"Rock Spring, GA",3,28,1,2.0,12/10/2017,"I would never eat at BJ's again. We were in town for my husband to run the marathon. We were actually looking for another restaurant but were unable to locate it. We finally decided on Bj's. To say the entrees were terrible is an understatement. My steak was brought to the table charred. You would think if you are supposed to be a steakhouse you would have great steak. My husband's was fair but not good. I also got asparagus and it was cooked beyond recognition. The only reason I am giving them two stars is the server. He was trying his best. Also the guacamole was good.  After the charred steak was delivered to our table the manager came by and apologized. He did not offer to credit the meal or compensate in anyway. This was not good customer service. It was very busy, for some reason, since the food is not very good I do not understand why.  All I can say is if you want good food do not go here. We spent $50 plus for horrible food."
Claudia R.,"Río Grande, Puerto Rico",26,58,26,5.0,6/5/2017,"Had a very nice time; the bartender was friendly, the service was timely and accurate. The beer selection was great. For a Sunday afternoon, it was a great place to spend my afternoon."
Stanley N.,"Athens, AL",0,12,1,1.0,4/21/2017,If it was possible I would give them 0 stars! A 25 minute wait turned into a 65 minute wait and then when we were seated our table had to be cleaned. The potato skins were fried and were very greasy. My son ask for a lemon for his tea twice and the third time the server brought him a bowl of 11 lemon slices. My daughter ask for a Vodka drink and they were out of that type of Vodka. ( this has now happened to her on 2 diff. Occasions. Mgr did come by to apologize and blame it on the ABC store!!!!????? Food was barely fit to eat. Parm. Chicken was burned and broccoli was almost raw even though two of us asked for double steaming of it. Server did offer to have it redone but I told her after 2 hours never mind. Daughter and son ordered Macadamia nut pizza cookie but got a peanut butter cookie that was not fully cooked.  I WILL NOT GO BACK TO B. J.'S and I would not recommend it to my friends or enemies. I HAVE NEVER RATED ANY PLACE LOWER THAN 3 stars but tonight deserved what it got!
Clariee J.,"Chattanooga, TN",40,101,306,3.0,6/8/2017,"I've visited BJs several times and I've enjoyed both visits. I haven't had anything I didn't enjoy, but I haven't had anything that was excellent, either. It seems like the type of place that has such an expansive menu, excellence is a little out of reach.  I love the idea of a small plates menu. They have several options for vegetarians and meat eaters alike. The roasted garlic, spinach and kale is good; my mom loved the cauliflower plate and the beets. She loves veggies and is a little particular, so I trust her palate. The selection is great but again, a large selection typically is lacking in excellence. The wings are nice and plump, but aren't really seasoned. It seems like they cook them then toss them in sauce (the root beer glare is good, btw) or sprinkle them with lemon/pepper. So a dry rub winds up more on the bottom of the plate than on the wing. The pizookie is good, but can be cooked a little too long. I shouldn't have to forcefully get the cookie away from the edges. I've had better at differently Bricks locations. The dinner salads are large, but if I order a BBQ chicken salad, I expect to find more than 6 small pieces of chicken in it. I asked the waitress about this (""How do they decide how much chicken to add?"" ""It's a whole chicken breast."" I call bullshit.)  The appetizers are good. The sampler appetizer is meant for at least 4 people, I'd say. The stuffed shrooms are good, but make sure there are 6 on your plate and not 5 (I'm guessing the waiter dropped one of mine on the way to the table? When I got the plate, there was a clear spot where a mushroom used to be.). Their homemade soft drinks are good. Root beer on tap is one of my friend's favorites. For me, the soda's don't have a lot of bite to them. I want it to feel like a scorpion stung the back of my throat after I've had 3 sips. Just my preference. I've never been disappointed, but I've learned to adjust my expectations accordingly. Good, yes. Visit again? Certainly. Excellent? Nah."
Rachel L.,"Long Beach, CA",2665,647,10634,3.0,10/13/2016,"Wings were good, the fresh baked cookie with ice cream was delicious. They got our order wrong twice, she brought out the small cookie and ice cream (personal size, free on your bday). I've had this before in Cali so I knew it was the wrong size. They were gonna charge us regular price for the wrong size cookie and ice cream! After I told her it was the wrong size she gave us a little attitude like we ordered it. She's our server, she took our order, she knew what we ordered and still gave it to us! if we didn't know better we would've probably ate it, paid for it and left."
Diana L.,"Huntsville, AL",0,2,,2.0,12/12/2017,Went here for the first time for a Christmas luncheon with the office.   Slow service and terrible service.  Our waitress never refilled our drinks and didn't bother checking on us at all. Food was nothing special.  Would not recommend.
Deon D.,"Harvest, AL",161,12,1,4.0,10/11/2017,"Very good for a ""chain"". My favorite is the avocado egg rolls. And the fruity ale is yum for a non beer drinker like me. Good service... fast and good food. Ambience is nice for after work hang out."
Huffbuffer B.,"Huntsville, AL",5,17,1,5.0,3/3/2017,"It was a beautiful day and I was at the bar.  It was quite busy today.  My mother was disputing charges at the Monaco for the movie Logan that somehow got charged to her.  So I stopped back in to see if that bus riding fellow may be at BJ's.  The food was amazing, as always.  The beer was wonderful and they definitely have their share of regulars.  When one bartender walked in, about nine guys stood up and cheered her arrival.  Unfortunately, my mom called and I had to run before she knew where I was at.  I wanted to see what set her apart from every bartender that would receive a standing ovation. Regards Huffbuffer"
Chelsie H.,"Davenport, IA",0,4,3,2.0,9/26/2017,"Drink was good.  Chips and queso were good.  That's all I can say good about this place.  My sandwich was bad as it had no flavor what so ever and the fries were cold and had a weird flavor like they were fried in old oil or something.  My co-workers wings came wrong and had to be redone.  Also, Our food came before our appetizers. Definitely won't be going back to this place."
Tony G.,"Huntsville, AL",54,92,6,5.0,2/24/2017,"Returned for the Thursday Rib Special a 1/2 rack of ribs, salad, 2 sides and a Mini Pizooki for $13.95. It was an excellent meal. The salad was fresh and large. One of sides was a bowl of Chicken Tortilla soup it was a bowl not a small cup it had a lot of flavor and the right amount of spice. The ribs were very well cooked and were tender and a good spice to the BBQ sauce. I had the Cookies and Cream Pizooki it was also very good. The beer and homemade sodas are also good. We will return soon."
Nick P.,"Anniston, AL",0,7,,5.0,12/17/2016,"Great service, beer, and food! Tried some of their in-house brews and local brews. Very refreshing. Started with some traditional wings and they were amazing! Crunchy and cooked perfectly. Buffalo sauce and ranch drizzle was a nice twist as well. Also ordered the sriracha brussel sprouta. They were very tasty! I'm not crazy about brussel sprouts but these were a different story. Lastly, I shared the mahi tacos with a friend. Very good. The appetizers were out of this world Overall, a great place to eat while at the bridge street mall."
Jeffrey K.,"Falkville, AL",21,63,64,2.0,5/6/2017,"Very slow service, they are so under staffed it is so obvious.  Food was ok but nothing to write home about.  We sure will not return."
Alana G.,"Huntsville, AL",0,5,,2.0,5/6/2017,Mediocre food and inconsistent service.  Table next to us actually got up and left the wait was so long.
Jennifer E.,"Baltimore, MD",0,3,,3.0,7/2/2017,"Don't know how the food is because we are still waiting. 15 mins to get drinks. 30 mins to get our order taken. The girl taking our drink order introduced herself as ""not our waitress"". Now been here 45 mins... no appetizers. Just told us that have no iceberg lettuce. Yay, food is here. Except three out of five orders have something wrong with them. Ok, food is pretty good... waitress has warmed up to us... we may alright after all. 25% off on the check... BJ's you are ok."
Tom L.,"Huntsville, AL",16,73,2,5.0,10/28/2016,"A new work friend (Jeff) took a group of us (4 total) to BJ's today and it was the best lunch I've had in a long time!  I'd never been before, or even heard about it - but man am I glad he took us there! Our server, Amy, was awesome - but be sure to only ask for her M-F - as she takes the weekends off... I had something on flatbread that had a weird name I've never heard of before... it was OUTSTANDING... Jeff just walked by - I had the PIADINA ....I ordered it because of Jeff's suggestion and he was spot on!   The placed was packed, but we were seated right away and our drinks came quickly.  I hear the blackberry cream soda is a hit - I stuck with a diet Pepsi because of sugar problems. The menu is packed... It was 16 pages long and weighs enough to use as a boat anchor, but everything in it looks outstanding.  If any of the other food items are 1/2 as good as what I had, I'm a fan! They have free wifi - and I downloaded the app while waiting for our food.  Once you sign on and get your table number, you can see your order on your phone... and you can pay for it as well... a very nice feature. I suppose you get some kind of bonus points for using the app - but to be honest, I don't need those points, I'm just happy as I can be to have found such an excellent lunch spot!  The wife and I will try it out soon as well! The food took a little longer to get to us than I expected, but seeing how it was a Friday, at 12:30, and packed, the wait was very reasonable and, when the food got to us, it was WELL WORTH THE WAIT! I - without a doubt - will be returning to what is now one of my favorite lunch spots.  It's close enough to walk to from my office - with food that is out of this world delicious!  You will NOT be disappointed!"
Nicholas B.,"Meridianville, AL",21,112,37,4.0,4/12/2017,"I like BJs. I recently moved to Huntsville from Colorado Springs where we also had a BJs so its nice to see a familiar chain. I have never had a bad experience at BJs and this visit was no exception. The inside is the same, wait staff was attentive but not toooo attentive. Home brews were on par which was refreshing. Hopefully the trainer I met in Colorado is still responsible for the great work these restaurants are doing. Needless to say ill be back."
Travene G.,"FL, FL",118,2,,4.0,10/15/2017,EPIC Sandwich ! If you need a place to splurge on some great food this is the place to be! I ordered the Nashville Hot Chicken Sandwich and the food peaked my satisfaction. The waitress was very complimentary with our order. Also get a pazookie if you get a chance! Wonderful restaurant!
Danielle M.,"Freehold, NJ",0,9,1,1.0,6/18/2017,"Do NOT eat here!!! Terrible, worthless service. HORRENDOUS food!! Truly horrible, cannot find even one positive thing to say about this place."
Salethia M.,"Gadsden, AL",40,3,,1.0,3/18/2017,"I was not impressed...extremely slow service. Our orders were either wrong or served warm, not hot. AND the warm food was not tasteful."
Beck W.,"Huntsville, AL",0,13,1,1.0,4/19/2017,Service was horrible. We sat outside and the server didn't show up. We had to go in and ask and get our own beer. Then he took our order and disappeared. We had to go in and get a second beer. Food arrived and it was bland oily and overlooked. We will not come back!!
Helen C.,"Gurley, AL",32,10,,5.0,3/15/2017,"This was my first visit.  Excellent craft beers.  Deep dish pizza was wonderful, an half off on Monday's!"
Alex I.,"Florence, AL",0,5,2,5.0,12/4/2016,Awesome place!!! The boneless honey BBQ wings are the best I've ever had!!! The Cobb salad with Avocado ranch is extremely delicious and very filling! If you are thinking about going you won't be disappointed!!!
Erin C.,"Homewood, AL",14,10,,3.0,1/27/2017,"Husband and I came here last night with my father in law. Wait wasn't horrible...25-30, which I kind of expected based on how busy they appeared. Beer was good. Waitress came, took our drink orders, brought them to us, and gave us a few extra minutes to decide what to eat. From the time she put our food orders in until they came and the manager came to talk to us, 36 minutes passed. The manager, she was incredibly sweet and kind, she comped our meal. Unfortunately, my food and my husbands food both had to be remade. Both were burnt. Mine didn't remotely look like a deep dish pizza the 1st go around...2nd time was MUCH better. My husbands was warm, burnt, dry (he had parmesan crusted chicken). His 2nd dish was better, but now he has food poisoning from his meal. I'd give more stars if we didn't have the issues we did."
Stephen W.,"Huntsville, AL",122,15,4,5.0,5/29/2016,"Best pizza in town. Jalapeno cucumber margarita is best Marg in town. Love it every time I'm here. Service is either great or okay but never poor. Proprietary beers are solid. There's some mixed ""beer cocktails"" that we've enjoyed. At the least me of the day, just go deep dish and be done with it. You won't be disappointed."
Emily M.,"Harvest, AL",44,16,,2.0,5/17/2017,I have only found one thing on this menu that I really enjoy and I've been there a handful of times. The brews aren't anything super special.
RK T.,"Madison, AL",0,34,,1.0,8/12/2017,"The service was terrible. We got seated right away, but our drinks and appetizers took quite awhile to get served. My glass of water was empty for about 30 minutes before a refill. Then the food took an hour to be served. We've been to Bj's in OH and WA, so we really like it. But Huntsville Bj's is terrible. Literally got 6 chips, not even a handful, to go with fish tacos. Fries never came out for sandwiches. Terrible can't be said enough."
