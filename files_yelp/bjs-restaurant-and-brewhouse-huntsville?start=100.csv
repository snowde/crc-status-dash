Don D.,"Madison, AL",0,2,,1.0,10/9/2016,"Went for deep dish pizza, this is NOT a good deep dish pizza. No sauce, so it tastes like a dry dough ball with toppings. Service staff was not accommodating ; they sat us at a booth and there were two empty tables, when we asked for a table we were told they were reserving them for a party, and a booth is all we could have, not that we could wait for a table. We relocated to the bar, and the severe was absentminded. Wife ordered soup in a bread bowl and it came after dry pizza and it was in a ceramic bowl. When we asked about the bread bowl, she said she forgot and it would be a while to fix it. In other words, sorry not gonna fix it. All in all I would give this place a C- on service and quality of food. On the positive side it was overpriced. Also, when we left the table we requested was still unoccupied. Plenty of better places in Huntsville that  still cater to the customer."
Audra S.,"Huntsville, AL",66,29,44,4.0,12/2/2015,"It wasn't a mind blowing experience, but no real complaints. A bit pricier than I'd like; can't go twice a week or anything. But it has 3 major selling points. The first is the locally crafted soda. They have a root beer, orange soda and cream soda they make personally. Pretty tasty. Also there is an Alfredo with Broccoli dish that was amazing and such large delicious portions. I have only eaten there twice and that was the better dish. The third selling feature is the Pizookies. Mostly cuz you have a lot of different kinds to choose from."
Evan C.,"Columbus, GA",0,1,,2.0,12/22/2015,The beer was pretty crappy. Nothing special for damn sure. But for some reason it was expensive as hell. The restaurant was pretty nice however the Bartenders were uneducated and slow (couldn't even pour a stout correctly) to me it's a typical bar att working to act like a m local brewery or beer advocate. Based on their beers it wasn't worth what I paid at all. Tasted more like kitchen beer made by and amateur.
Justin P.,"Madison, AL",2,9,2,4.0,12/10/2015,"Great location wise but food is just so so.  If you really enjoy Applebee's / Ruby Tuesdays type food you'll love this place, lol."
Sherrie D.,"Union City, TN",12,21,,4.0,3/25/2016,Fun place!  Lots of room and seating. I had the California flat bread with a Caesar salad. Both were very tasty.  My daughter had the classic burger and fries. My waiter Dwayne (I believe) was very nice and helpful.   We will be back!
Leonard W.,"Madison, AL",0,19,2,5.0,3/25/2016,Our server was way cool and was perfect!!! The food was great!! Great atmosphere!! Look forward to going back!
Jason P.,"Huntsville, AL",5,6,3,5.0,11/9/2015,"Service was fantastic.  Even as the place filled up, out waitress was very attentive.  The stuffed mushroom appetizer was very tasty and the Brisket &Bacon burger was delicious.  Will definitely come back."
Arrow H.,"Huntsville, AL",0,46,9,1.0,1/17/2016,Had Cesar salad with mini pizza.  Cesar has rotten lettuce.  Very disappointed.  Don't understand why it is so difficult for management to spot check perishable food and throw out food that is old.  A bag of iceberg lettuce is cheap.
Samantha W.,"Madison, AL",0,11,,5.0,9/25/2015,"My husband and I decided to try BJ's for our anniversary dinner. We had purchased tickets for an 8:15pm movie, but were running behind and didn't get to BJ's until 6:50pm. We didn't have a reservation so the hostess said it would be about a 10 - 15 minute wait, which would leave us with under an hour to eat. We decided to take the chance and I'm glad we did. The hostess got us seated in about 5 minutes and our waitress was there almost immediately. We let her know that we had movie tickets and she was able to get our appetizers and drinks to the table promptly and our food arrived around 7:20pm. This gave us plenty of time to eat and even some time to relax before heading to our movie. The waitress came by regularly to check on us. Now, about the food, it was great! Our drinks were great, my husband got the Long Island Ice Tea and said it had all the right components and wasn't too strong or too weak. I had the Strawberry Splash and it was sweet, strawberry flavored, and cool and refreshing. We shared some mozzarella sticks. They were not the best, probably frozen, but I still really enjoyed them. My husband ordered the bacon cheeseburger and said it was delicious. The fries were the skinnier, homemade version--good flavor and crisp. The burger was huge, which we were both kind of surprised about. My husband liked it quite a bit. I had comfort food, the Southern Fried Chicken. The chicken was yummy and their mashed potatoes are better than my moms and my mom is a great cook. The corn was also very tasty and paired wonderfully with the chicken and mashed potatoes. Overall, a great experience and we will definitely go back."
Halston S.,"Athens, AL",1,4,,5.0,3/8/2016,"A place that is well worth the prices (which are surprisingly not too bad). We were seated somewhat quickly for such a busy day, and despite our waitress being rude towards the start, the experience was nice, and the food was quickly prepared and delicious. Their menu contains anything and everything you could be craving, and they're pretty flexible with the way you might want it prepared. The environment and atmosphere was nice and comfortable, including the temperature and it wasn't too loud or bright. The architecture is neat and minimal, and it was a really nice restaurant with good service, great food, and a nice atmosphere to dine in. New favorite place? Yep. Will be back! :)"
Kendra S.,"Monterey, CA",61,31,45,4.0,7/9/2015,"I just moved from CA and was excited to see BJ's opening because this is one of my fav places to go for games and with groups. You will be able to see a TV from any seat in the house.  They are known for their pizzas and burgers, but make sure you leave room for the pizookie at the end! You won't regret it! The music is loud and so is the conversation. The place just opened, so it's popular. The menu is diverse and has a lot of great offerings from appetizers to small bites to entrees, including gluten free options. Picky eaters will find something to please their palate. They have great lunch deals and prices, as well.  They offer a variety of beers and wines. Download their app and start collecting rewards. Use it to pay, use it to request a seat, use it to order your food ahead of time.  They are newly opened and so far so good! They have things running smoothly! Thank you, BJ's for branching out of Cali and coming to my neck of the woods!"
Chris B.,"Cambridge, MA",4,9,17,5.0,10/25/2015,"Fun restaurant and bar. Great for couples, families, friends. Frequently full; get a reservation. Good selection of food and beers. Great desserts."
Tipawan G.,"Huntsville, AL",63,47,5,5.0,9/12/2015,"Oh, I love this place. Hard to get in if there's a long wait but once you're in, the food and service is stellar. I loved their calamari and the sirloin dinner I had. Delicious."
PD G.,"Madison, AL",1,60,10,5.0,10/1/2015,New but excellent sports bar at Bridge Street near PF Chang.  Very good food and good choice  of beers.  ( a plus is that my wife likes to go there). (Seems rather new (opened in 2014?) ). I can stop in to get some good food & drink while my darling wife continues her shopping.
Just T.,"Atlanta, GA",845,11,45,2.0,7/19/2015,"This time was very disappointing... Our Waitor only said her training lines, I asked her a question and said ""oh I don't know I just learn what I need to say and bring what you need"".  When I ordered my beer I ordered a blond ale she brought a dark beer.....  We barely saw her only when she needed to close the check."
Kelly E.,"Huntsville, AL",14,33,20,2.0,6/21/2016,"Went for lunch with a group of 8. We got there early and they had set us up initially in a large booth, which would have been tight. Since we had at least one more joining, we got them to switch us to adjoining tables. We ordered at about 11:15. Shortly after, our appetizers and salads arrived. Then the long wait for entrees. When I say long, I mean more than 45 minutes. Thankfully my watermelon and feta salad was very good. My half flatbread was ok, nothing special. Our server was not forthcoming with water refills. He also managed to mess up the split checks and then became a bit rude when one of our party pointed out that she hadn't received her check. The whole lunch took almost 2 hours. Rude servers are barely tolerable when they are good, but to be rude and inept is not acceptable. I will try going back once more maybe for dinner or happy hour. If the service sucks the next time, it will be the last time."
Tanya G.,"Queen Anne, Seattle, WA",1,42,1,4.0,9/13/2015,Service is always good. And the the food has always been amazing. My only complaint is that the patio chairs and benches are very uncomfortable and dont have sun protection in the afternoon. They should put a blind to get shade.
Debarun D.,"Madison, AL",0,4,,3.0,7/29/2016,"Good collection of drinks and food, great atmosphere... Sabrina was a wonderful server !!"
Mark P.,"Modoc, IN",1,5,,4.0,11/25/2015,"Reading all the negative reviews, I almost did not go. I'm glad I went anyway.  They have a good selection of brews and will gladly help you find the one you want. I had a slab of ribs, which was good and seasoned just right. Fries were hot and crispy. Only drawback were the Brussels sprouts, which had been fried for too long.  My buddy had a religious experience with a deep dish pizza.  Waitstaff was friendly and competent, but not overbearing."
Daniel S.,"Huntsville, AL",8,14,,5.0,7/12/2015,"This place was great! Food was excellent, waitstaff were attentive, and we were seated immediately. I was very impressed with the food quality and freshness. Normally, new restaurants experience a few hiccups, but my experience here was perfect. I highly recommend his place - they have a large menu that will suit anyone."
