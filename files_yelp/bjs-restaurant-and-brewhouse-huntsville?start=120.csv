Jeff B.,"Huntsville, AL",0,13,13,4.0,6/4/2016,"Went there expecting to get burgers but we were told that their specialty was pizza. So we tried my favorite pie to compare to other restaurants (deep dish pepperoni, sausage, and bacon). It did NOT disappoint!!!  It was amazingly delicious!!!  The only negative was their sweet tea. Not very sweet and almost bitter.  But we will be back to try other things."
C B.,"Avon, NC",0,2,,5.0,7/5/2016,Food was great. The house made guacamole is some of the best I've had. The fried artichokes were delicious. We had the baked ziti and chicken piadina. Both were really good.  Sabrina was our server and she was excellent. She had several suggestions about the menu and they were all wonderful. We didn't order pizookie this time but have had it before and it's definitely amazing but be prepared to not want to move after eating it. It's definitely something to have on occasion as a treat.
Sonya N.,"Athens, AL",2,7,,2.0,12/24/2015,"Food is mediocre and overpriced. This is not the place to socialize over a meal because the music is far too loud, and it's not even good music. Service is a slow. Very disappointing. Not sure I would give them a second chance because they are so overpriced. But if you like a variety on the menu, that's one good thing. They have a lot of choices--almost too many."
Jeremy D.,"Louisville, KY",0,11,,5.0,8/4/2015,"They were slammed, but still delivered on quality customer service and food. Oh, the beer was great too.  Will surely be back when I visit next again."
Tom S.,"Gurley, AL",0,8,,3.0,6/23/2016,Since this location opened we have been here five or six times. The service is hit and miss. Tonight it definitely a miss. There are so few places that understand service these days.
Christi F.,"Hazel Green, AL",0,10,,1.0,11/28/2015,"If I could give this place a negative, I would. We had a party of 6 and came to BJ's for my husbands 40th birthday. It was horrible. 4 of the 6 meals came out a few degrees above cool. 3 of the meals where so bad that they didn't get eaten at all. I'm so disappointed and so was my husband! Way to ruin his birthday!"
Jason F.,"Madison, AL",0,2,,2.0,11/23/2015,"First off, the food here is ok...my poor review/rating is based solely on the service.  Our first trip to BJs was for dinner and our waiter was EXTREMELY unresponsive. Our drinks were only refilled once (and that took FOREVER), we didn't receive silverware until 10 min after our food had arrived, and didn't receive our check until 15 min after I requested it. We felt like an inconvenience to the waiter. It was awful. Our second trip was this past Friday for lunch. We showed up around 11:30 and were seated at a two-person high-top table in the bar area. These tables had zero privacy...the tables to the right and left were literally two feet away on each side. So we asked the hostess if we could sit at a booth instead (mind you there were 5 open booths that we counted at that time), and she said that we couldn't because there were no servers for those booths. Well not 5-10 min later, EVERY one of those booths were filled. Unbelievable. To be a paying customer and be lied to was very unsettling.  And btw, this is my first Yelp review...I am not normally one to write reviews, but the service was so bad I felt like I had to!"
Larry S.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,3,,3.0,5/6/2016,"Great menu, pretty good food, good atmosphere.  You just have to decide if it's all worth the wait.  Don't be fooled by them coming to your table quickly and taking your drink order--it's just a way to try to keep you there when they disappear... for a very long time."
Ashley H.,"Huntsville, AL",20,2,,5.0,11/3/2015,"Oh my gosh! This place is SOOOOOO good!!! To start, the waitstaff is so kind. We were greeted by each employee, and definitely completely tended to. The restaurant was very clean, and each employee was constantly cleaning up after themselves. We received the most simple and detailed menu. Very easy to follow, and the wait staff was very knowledgable about the menu. I ordered the California chicken club, and it was so good! As a side, I did the broccoli cheddar soup, and it was completely phenomenal. My boyfriend did the steak, and he enjoyed it along with baked potatoes. We did the salted caramel pizookie and baked beneit (sp?) for dessert, and it was soooo yummy!!! We will definitely be back! Not to mention, the prices were great! We ate all that for less than $50!!!"
E B.,"New Market, AL",15,15,,3.0,7/31/2015,"Very nice environment. .Food came out very fast. Calamari wasn't the best I've had. On a scale of 1 -10 I would give the calamari a 3. My wife had the shrimp scampi pasta, I will give it a 10. The white peach magarita was okay..I definitely will go back. They have a great variety on the menu."
Nate M.,"Madison, AL",0,1,,2.0,5/3/2016,"Service was average, nothing great.  The ""deep dish"" pizza was extremely disappointing.  It's not real deep dish - it's thick crust.  The pizza also just tastes... Cheap.  Not good.  I'm shocked this place remains so busy.  The one good thing I can say is the beer was cold, so that's something...?  BJ's is just not worth the time or the money."
Jack H.,"Huntsville, AL",1,5,1,4.0,8/20/2015,We have gone to BJ'S twice now and have really enjoyed ourselves.  The food is very good and the drinks even better. The servers are very polite and prices fair. Our only complaint would be it's quite noisy inside. The patio was a great option for  less people noise and they play some outstanding music throughout the place.
P C.,"Madison, AL",2,3,1,5.0,4/19/2016,"This is an outstanding restaurant. Great service, good food and very friendly atmosphere.  You've got to see/try all of the fantastic beverages; beer, mixed drinks, tea and super soft drinks.  My favorite hangout!"
Rebecca A.,"Madison, AL",6,11,4,3.0,5/4/2016,"The food is always on point but if you want to order a drink from the bar, be warned... It takes forever! I never come here unless I'm able to wait and willing to do so. With that said.... The servers I have had have all been great. The only issue is the bar, which is a big deal for a brew house."
Chris H.,"Huntsville, AL",30,3,,1.0,9/17/2016,"Horrible service. Hostess said first come for seating in the bar area. After we seated ourselves we were ignored for 20 minutes. Then a waitress passed us and said that our server would be right there. We watched as another couple were walked to the bar area and given menus and napkins/flatware, again were told by another waitress someone would be right with us. Sit for another 10 minutes while viewing the restaurant manager look out through the glass at us still no service. Finally another waitress comes to our table again to inform us that our waiter was in the process of clocking in and would be right there........ridiculous, not sure what type of management/customer service this company expects but I will predict this place will not remain open much longer with this type management. Finally a waiter comes to our table and ask if he can get us something to drink, advised him I wasn't sure that we had 4 different waitresses snub us at that point and the last one had said she would bring us a drink. He ask what they were only to tell us they don't carry that drink So apparently we should order again. I must say he did everything he could to correct such a shitty experience but this is the second time that I have tried this place and both times sucked. We will not be back EVER! Shitty shitty management!"
D G.,"Huntsville, AL",1,33,,1.0,7/10/2016,"Went to the restaurant last night at 5:30 and got on the wait list. I had been before for lunch with a friend. Tonight wife and I. Just two of us. Front of house said 40 mins ""but that's what they told us to say. It won't take that long"" so we waited. After 45 mins, asked and they said we were #11 on the list. Many tables inside are still empty. 10 mins later and five couples are seated.  So I asked where we were on the list...#11. Wait...what?  Oh people who call in or use the app are seated first. Hmmmm that would have been good to know. So we left and went down the street to a competitors restaurant. Got seated, had drinks, appetizers, etc. When our entrees arrived...Bing...text message from...wait for it...BJs. Really?  One hour and thirty five minutes later we have a table. So here's the thing. Wait list is stupid, just tell people the truth that you don't have seating, staff are confused and overwhelmed, service is slowed to a crawl since my first visit. We won't be going here again. There are other and better options across the city."
Jerry M.,"Huntsville, AL",0,10,,1.0,1/14/2016,"Their service is SLOW!!!! Hope you're not in a hurry?  Took my server 20 mins to even acknowledge I was here. It took 10 mins to get my beer. It's the third time I've been here and it's gotten progressively worse every time.  If it wasn't the fact it was a group event, I wouldn't even be here."
Jim M.,"Amelia, OH",0,40,11,4.0,12/23/2015,"Had the guacamole burger tasted great service was good, plenty of televisions....good experience!"
Elizabeth B.,"Salt Lake City, UT",4,77,11,2.0,9/17/2015,"Thank you BJ's for reminding me why I usually avoid big chain restaurants. They told us it would be a 10 minute wait and we ended up waiting over half an hour. We ordered immediately because we had time to look over the menu about 18.5 times and memorize it backwards and forwards... and it took another 40 minutes to get our food. Now, I am pretty forgiving when it comes to slow service. If the food is good I won't even mention it. After waiting that long I could have eaten an old boot. It was definitely better than that, but even in our hungry state we were less than impressed. My sister and I shared the Thai Mango Salad, which included no mango (or Thai seasoning). If there was dressing on there, I couldn't tell. I got through the whole salad before I found one single mango matchstick stuck to the bottom of the plate. 11 dollars is a lot to spend on lettuce and bland chicken. The French Dip was actually really good, but the fries that came with it were stone cold. My other sister ordered fish tacos and reported that they were flavorless and had to ask the waitress for extra salsa. I have no problem with a restaurant having an extensive menu if they do everything on it well, but most don't. I guess when you go to a place like this you should really stick to burgers and pizza."
Brenda B.,"Madison, AL",0,1,,1.0,7/25/2015,Waited 1 1/2 hours to be seated. Told 3 times it would be 20 minutes to be seated. Food not so good service horrible experience long and trying. Bill messed up - not even offered dessert - by that time just wanted to cut our losses and leave!!!
