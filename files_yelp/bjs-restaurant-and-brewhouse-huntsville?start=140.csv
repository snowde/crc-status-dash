Esther C.,"Huntsville, AL",0,4,3,2.0,12/1/2015,"Been here twice and neither time was a good experience. I will say they had good beer, their food is OK, not bad...but there is better elsewhere. The food is definitely not worth the 3 hours of waiting you have to do for it. Both times I have gone the waitstaff has not been very attentive. It seems they forget about the table. Maybe they are understaffed? I dont know. But each time I would finish a beer, I would stop feeling the buzz before the next one. By the time our food was served it was cold. The atmosphere here is good, but the long 2 hour lunches you have to take from work in order to eat here outweigh the few positives. Dont waste your time here."
Mary G.,"Madison, AL",0,12,1,4.0,7/17/2015,"Beautiful Restraunt. We r always happy to eat at a new place in Madison/Huntsville. This place didn't disappoint, lots of beer choices and lots of food choices. My order started out a bit wrong but the staff and MOD fixed the problem right away. Everyone was very helpful. We will be back. Really wanting to try the Pizookies, just didn't have room enough for it."
Eric H.,"Florence, AL",0,1,,4.0,8/30/2015,Our food was great! A little bit of everything! Very packed though but that's to expected with a new restaurant.
Sean M.,"Springfield, VA",0,14,,1.0,11/27/2015,"Yes, it was Black Friday.  We checked in at 5 pm, we were told 45 to 60 minutes, so we went shopping.  Checked in at the 60 minute mark, we were told it was only 41 minutes and they assured us they'd text when we were up, just another 20 minutes and we waited on the bench out front.  After 45 minutes, I checked in and they indicated we missed our table because we didn't check in within 5 minutes of the text.  I didn't get a text.  They said there would be a table within 2 minutes, and it was.  Except it was too small for our party and it was sticky.  They moved us to a larger table, properly cleaned and promptly took our drink orders.  And she missed 2 of the 7.  And we had to ask a second time to get it corrected.  Nearly an hour from seating to food service, burgers had been under the heat lamp the cheese melted and slid off.  Three of the burgers were not prepared as ordered.  When I was a manager of a restaurant, patrons with an experience as we had were offered free dessert, or maybe one of the entrees free.  My offer, the full price bill delivered without a smile."
