Mike S.,"Chicago, IL",137,169,140,4.0,10/17/2015,"Been here twice in a week's time... that means it's time to weigh in.  BJ's Brewhouse is an unexpected surprise among the many, many chains that often park to grab up new retail space in Huntsville.  After trying (and failing) nearby Bravo!, I wasn't expecting much other than a beer burger joint that oddly hit me in that Gordon Biersch kinda way.  But low expectations and a healthy appetite are where second children and surprisingly good dining experiences come from, it seems.  I won't talk about how I know the former...so we'll focus on the latter.  If 'Suburban Industrial' is a style, the interior of BJ's would be just that.  High walls adorned with ongoing of murals of what could be best described as Atlas Shrugged figures doing stuff with grains.  Again, reminiscent of many many generic brew houses and art Deco Nebraska.  The dark red/black motif makes me think of all the cattle I've eaten over the years.  There's an array of flat screens and a few more strategically placed to give just about everyone in the dining area a view of the latest games.  Also hard to miss is the bar area... But I haven't tested their top shelf material or their barkeeps' expertise just yet.  Again, keeping the bar low.  Now onto the food...  What I've had... Bacon guac burger, calamari, Southwest egg rolls, pot stickers, ahi tuna, Brussel spouts with Sriracha and a four meat deep dish pizza.   Of those, they're all pretty to very good with the exception of the Southwest rolls.  Honestly there's absolutely nothing to em.  But standouts are the burgers, the Brussel sprouts and the deep dish.  Granted, the deep dish isn't Malnatti's... but approaches Gino's.  Oddly, the Cheesecake Factory-esque menus don't contain a single onion ring option.  I mean... seriously? Am interesting thing here is the mix and match beer brews.  You can mix a low ABV fruity type with a heavier stout on your own or pick one from their list of go-to orders.  Or... You can try 'em straight, from names you know to a few local IPAs you might not. There are also cocktails, wine and the likes as well. The waitstaff is hit or miss on both personality and responsiveness.  First time around, the service really popped albeit nervously.  The second time around, our server was MIA and we suffered some mix ups in the orders.  But none of it seemed grossly negligent so not a death knell in my book.   I'm gonna even venture to say that BJ's is a good time spot at Bridgestreet for the family, date night or even the bar flies like myself.  I think the fact that it's new actually helps attract a fairly diverse crowd by Huntsville terms."
Stephen M.,"Madison, AL",23,41,7,4.0,6/17/2016,"My service was impeccable.  Dustin, my bartender, is amicable and courteous.  The Tatonka stout beer is delicious, and the barbacoa chicken is worthy of repute!  It's nice to have their enLIGHTed menu which offers lower calorie and healthier options. I dock a star because:  1) it seems a little loud to me with a sound system playing some admittedly great 90's hits, and the guest conversations and laughter are very audible.  If I were with a friend, I think conversation would require some effort.  2) I had trouble staying connected to the WiFi.  There seems to be a timeout issue.  I'm having to nitpick to find anything wrong, because this really is a great place! I've heard the pizza here is remarkable, so I'm anxious to try that next time."
Laura B.,"Starkville, MS",1,48,4,2.0,7/16/2016,"Disappointed. We went specifically for the pizza (because I LOVE Giordano's deep dish pizza). BJ's says their deep dish pizza is inspired by Chicago-style pizza. Well, it is a TOTAL FAIL. BJ's pizza is NOT Chicago style pizza at all! It was basically a thick crust pizza with hardly any cheese or sauce (and I asked for extra sauce) that was baked in a deep dish pan. Little Caesars' $10 thick crust pizza has more flavor. The Pizookie is THE BOMB! I would go back just for the dessert. We tried the triple sampler and liked all three picks (monkey bread, chocolate chip cookie and Double Chocolate.) Service was terrible. While our waitress was friendly, we had to ask a couple of times for flatware and napkins. Our table was only cleared of two plates. I personally removed our pizza stand and plates because our table was so crowded. When we left, there were more than 10 glasses on the table (there were four of us).  At least we never felt pressure to leave. :) The atmosphere is light, casual, and fun. Plenty of parking. There was an hour wait but you can shop or walk around while you wait because they will text you when your table is ready."
Jose M.,"Montgomery, AL",64,3,,1.0,3/23/2017,Slow slow slow! Came here for lunch and had to wait 3 hours for food! I should have just stayed here for dinner too! Crust of my California Club was like eating bark. I'm so disappointed.
Meghin E.,"Toney, AL",119,183,745,4.0,7/30/2015,"We went late on a Thursday night. My husband got the tavern pizza, and I had the mini deep dish. Both pizzas were great. The menu is very similar to a Cheesecake Factory but without the cheesecake. The desserts are skillet cookies. The selection of beer is phenomenal. Also the bar seating area is first come first serve. We will definitely be back."
Maria C.,"Madison, AL",0,18,3,3.0,7/25/2016,Bj's has a wonderful beer list and usually decent service. The only complaint I have is that the food is average to sometimes very good but it isn't consistent. For example I got the fish and chips on a Saturday night .The fish was over fried and absorbed too much grease. But the service was excellent that night.
Kala H.,"Huntsville, AL",2,23,,3.0,10/2/2016,"Only go for the food, service is lacking. Second visit in a year and hasn't changed a bit."
Michael H.,"Panama City Beach, FL",9,1,,5.0,7/18/2017,The root beer bone in wings are excellent! And sweet tea was great. First time eating here hoped to be back.
Dana I.,"Florence, AL",9,14,5,5.0,10/10/2016,This place is amazing! They have great beers and great ciders on tap. We got the calamari as an appetizer and the triple decker and the pulled pork for entrees. Amazing food and great staff!
Jeremy T.,"Huntsville, AL",57,162,7,3.0,2/19/2016,"So Huntsville finally got something that is more on the high end for what it is. I had never heard of BJ's until it opened and was told a lot of things. I went here right around the holiday season so it was packed as I would expect. What I did not expect that there were open tables on a 20 minute wait? They evidently have some program you can use your BJ's app on a smartphone and get a table and preorder drinks and food before you get there. That is cool if you go a lot but someone like me who is trying it out for the first time ever thought it was stupid. I went with my grandfather who liked the place and enjoyed the beer menu as I liked it as well. The food was okay, I had ordered a burger in which is was tough and dry tasting. My grandfathers food was not the best either in which I believe he said something to management about."
Ann W.,"Grant, AL",0,9,7,1.0,7/13/2017,"Service was good. Food was not.  I told them I couldn't eat onions because they made me sick. They said no problem. I ordered the Mahi tacos. She said they could make them without onions. My granddaughter ordered the broccoli cheese soup. It took quite awhile to get our food even though they weren't really busy. When they brought our food, they didn't bring her a spoon for the soup. My tacos had lots of raw onion. They said they would remake my tacos and took them away. Five minutes later we were still waiting for the spoon. 15 minutes later I finally get the tacos only they didn't have any of the cabbage or other slaw because it had onions. So I paid $11 for a tiny piece of fish an a tablespoon of lettuce. If they had told me they couldn't do the tacos without onions I would have ordered something else. Totally unprofessional. Not going there again."
Tara D.,"Huntsville, AL",0,6,,1.0,7/7/2017,"Service was awful. First of all... went to sit at the bar while we waited on our table. Sat for 10 mins without anyone taking our drink order, then got paged for our table. Of course, the bartender made eye contact with us at that point... we were leaving. There were 2 bartenders that knew we were there and clearly for whatever reason weren't interested in serving us. So we get to our table. Server took a bit to get there... takes our drinks and app order. Brings drinks. I got a flight of their house beers. None were good. I'm a beer person. I didn't finish a single one and one of them was flat and barely drinkable. Main course came out before app. Server never apologized. We asked her to just cancel the app. She kind of shrugged and said ok with no apology or anything. Just complete indifference. Very annoying. Got a burger. It wasn't cooked as ordered. Overall a terrible experience and definitely won't be going back. Terrible service. Terrible beer. Mediocre, not so great food."
Nick G.,"Lake Mathews, CA",5,15,4,1.0,5/23/2016,"We have been to BJ's in CA many times (for birthday parties) and have always thought the food was overpriced for so-so quality. This place was no exception. Service was poor, sat at the bar and took forever to get service despite the place being empty. Then had food poisoning and spent the night on the toilet. Would have been 2 stars if it hadn't given me mud butt."
Jim D.,"Huntsville, AL",0,4,,2.0,10/30/2016,"Seems to be in decline... 3rd time was definitely NOT a charm.  Service poor, food cold, drinks left empty.  Won't be back for a while"
Kayla K.,"Birmingham, AL",8,23,22,3.0,10/27/2016,"Only thing that offsets the great drinks and atmosphere is the food. The food is average at best, which isn't surprising since the menu is the size of a short novel."
James B.,"Old Fourth Ward, Atlanta, GA",0,6,1,2.0,6/17/2017,Not a good experience at all!!!!  I know it is busy on a sat night however  when we placed our order we asked for lemon in the water. None came with it so we asked 3 times before it arrived.  The food arrived and mine was not real hot but not bad. My husbands was not what he ordered.  I went ahead and ate my flatbread pizza before his arrived.  Bill arrived and it was for three pizzas instead of two so we got that straightened out and got out   After screwing our order up you would think that there would be some kind of compensation.  I have NO interest in coming back for another dinner. Maybe lunch would be better
KaSea C.,"Meridianville, AL",1,45,4,3.0,9/26/2016,We love to come in during football season for happy hour. Tonight the place cleared out....because they chose to play the debate instead.
Danny D.,"Vincennes, IN",88,5,1,1.0,8/4/2016,"I've always had great service and food from Bjs restaurants from California to Indiana.  We stopped by here on the way to Florida for a nice meal. It took the hostess 45 minutes to seat us. Only half the tables in the restaurant were full. We suggested together multiple times if we can just push two tables together to sit. Long story short, after multiple suggestions we finally get seated. She did not look happy to be working at all. Then our waiter comes. He didn't even looked interested in serving us. He's walking back and fourth barely helping us. We finally get drinks and appetizers ordered. Onto the entrees. Food comes at a decent time. Refills took forever. Our wings were raw. Fries were cold. At this point we just want to pay and get out of there to get back on the road.  It takes another 15 mins to get checks. Once the checks came we asked for boxes. He comes back to run our cards and all that. We're still waiting for boxes. He's walking around and helping other people. We stand up and wait for him still to bring the boxes. He finally does 20 mins after asking for them. We leave. Needless to say I will never go back there. The worst food and services I've ever experienced at any BJs restaurant. Edit: I ended calling to talk to the manager but got the run around and was put on hold. Decided it wasn't worth my time to continue to call back. Left and number and never got a call."
Whitney D.,"Emerald Ridge Apartments, AL",116,110,328,2.0,1/26/2016,Visited on NYE with friends. Very slow service. Had to constantly ask for refills and they over cooked a medium rare steak.
Kevin L.,"Nashville, TN",0,8,13,5.0,12/3/2016,We had the stuffed mushrooms for an appetizer and we both had the grilled mahi mahi tacos.  Everything was really good.
