Jeff R.,"Owens Cross Roads, AL",2,27,10,2.0,8/24/2016,VERY slow service bordering on forgetting you.  Cool atmosphere but wait staff is either overworked or just plain bad.
Duck M.,"Huntsville, AL",0,69,,3.0,2/24/2017,"The first time I came here I had the Santa Fe Salad which was huge and very filling but most important it was very, very good. My wife and I shared the Root Beer boneless wings which were also awesome. My wife had the Southern Fried Chicken which she said was very good as well. Today when I ordered the Southwest chicken salad it was not nearly good as the first time. Do not go here unless you plan to wait. Service is slow and the girls at reception are not well trained on their duties. I would not recommend unless you want good beer. Food is just so so now."
Jeremy M.,"Huntsville, AL",18,20,,1.0,7/16/2016,Such great beer. And such good food. And such terrible service.  We went to BJ's a few weeks ago and the service was extremely slow.  We gave them the benefit of the doubt and went back today and sat outside on the patio for more than 5 minutes and weren't even greeted by anyone.  So we got up and went into the bar and the bartender was slow and frankly a jerk.  This place has the best beer in Bridge Street but we won't be back.
Larry S.,"Huntsville, AL",1,74,15,4.0,4/30/2017,First time eating at BJs and was pleasantly surprised with the quality of food and service. The Thursday special of BB Ribs was very good and the fries were something special.  Prices are very reasonable if you go during happy hour or purchase their daily special.  I wasn't as impress with their beer.  I tried three different samples and drank both of their dark beers (Stout/Brown) and none had much flavor.  I would go there again and recommend it as a place to meet a friend.  Place can get busy late in the afternoon even during the week.
James B.,"Kaneohe, HI",222,20,,4.0,4/21/2017,"I ordered a flight of the BJ's craft beer, along with a spaghetti and meatballs. For the most part the food quality was okay, beer was good and staff was friendly. I also felt the restaurant itself was inviting and would probably go back to this location or visit another BJ's restaurant somewhere else."
Tiffany E.,"Louisville, KY",50,6,,5.0,7/22/2016,"We visited BJ's for the first time this afternoon. Our waitress was very knowledgable and recommended a house berry craft beer that was outstanding. My husband and I split the California Club, which was by far the best club sandwich I have ever had. My children loved the extensive children's menu and was thrilled to drink the strawberry lemonade. We highly recommend BJ's and can't wait to explore more of the menu."
Douglas P.,"Wilmington, NC",1,1,,2.0,10/1/2015,"I've never written a bad review before today, but as much as my wife and I wanted to enjoy this place, the service and food were sub-par and after our stomachs settled down, I figured I needed to share our experience.  We walked in today mid-afternoon and had no problem getting a table in the bar area. The restaurant was 90% empty. Our server took our order: two beers, queso dip, and two crispy jalapeño burgers. The beer came quickly and it was wonderful. Everything went down hill after that. We sat waiting for our appetizer for 20-25 minutes. I was wondering if this was a technique to sell a second round of beer; make people wait so long for food they drink the beer waiting and then order more when the food comes. We only got our appetizer after I waved our server over and she remarked ""Oh, you still don't have your queso"". So she went and got our queso. We ran out of chips, and she said she'd bring more...she never did. Our burgers arrived 15-20 minutes after the queso. Total wait was about 40 minutes after ordering. Our server told us the kitchen didn't cook them medium, so she had them redo them. I was excited about the burger, but my first bite was a major disappointment. Very little flavor in an $11+ burger. In fact, a Hardees Thickburger put it to shame! My wife felt the same about her burger. Within 20 minutes of eating the burgers, we both had upset stomachs and were a little angry that we just spent $41 for food that was unremarkable and service that was far from good. The beer was tasty though..."
Ralph P.,"Spring, TX",0,4,,4.0,7/30/2016,"Love this place!! Every time we come we ask for Sabrina. She is always on point in attending the table, drinks, she has a great knowledge on the menu, and everything we have ask her opinion about is always good! The atmosphere is great and we will be always coming back!"
Tyler S.,"Wilmington, NC",0,9,,3.0,2/23/2017,"Ok so food is good and lots of draft beers which is awesome. However, I've been twice and sat at the bar alone and both times I had male bartenders that  were not great. Now not sure if they were new but what got me mad was how they acted towards me. Made me felt like I was an inconvenience for ordering food. They also didn't acknowledge or respond any time I asked for something. I travel a lot for work and am forced to eat out and I can recognize good and bad bartenders with respect or manners. I usually don't care when they are very busy at the bar but it was pretty slow. It was to the point where I didn't want to order food my 2nd time going. Maybe get a table with a waiter or waitress and you might get some better service"
Daniel E.,"Gardena, CA",55,2,1,1.0,9/26/2016,If I could give a zero star rating I would. My family and I were absolutely disgusted and lost our appetite's  due to the roach on the table next to us as a waiter came to clean it up. As if that wasn't enough she used a plate and a glass that our food is on to do it with all of this going on another employee said pest control came out the other day. This is not a establishment that I will be eating at again at least not until it revises it's pest control policies.
Nick G.,"Meridianville, AL",116,21,1,3.0,10/12/2015,"First experience here was overall average. We went about 2pm for a late lunch. It wasn't very busy.  The food was phenomenal and was delivered very promptly. We ordered the Spicy Hawaiian pizza. It was probably the best pizza I've ever eaten.  Only complaint was the service. The young lady that was serving us had the personality of a bag of rocks. She was better at the beginning of the meal than toward the end.  I ordered a beer when we first sat down and it was delivered promptly. Once I finished it, just before our food arrived, she asked if I wanted another. I declined and asked for a water. That's when her demeanor went down hill. She gave me a terrible look, said ""Oh you just want a water?"", and walked away. Several minutes later when she came back by, I asked again for a water. She said she would be right back. Moments later, she came back with a pitcher and refilled my wife's water, still no water for me.  We finished meal and asked for check. She acted disgusted and flipped our check down in front of our infant child. We paid and left.  Basically I ate my entire meal sipping on my wife's water because she refused to bring me one.  Definitely enjoyed the food, but it was a poor service experience. This particular waitress needs a job that doesn't involve interacting with people."
Johnny B.,"Huntsville, AL",58,169,12,3.0,6/26/2016,"I'll reluctantly give three stars, because the food was good.  It took over 30 minutes to get seated and we called earlier in the day.  People who arrived AFTER the first of our party were seated after only 20 minutes.  Once at the table, the service was mediocre at best.  I cannot see me returning, unless someone else is paying (it is hard to pass up a free meal, when the food is good)."
Elizabeth N.,"Kennesaw, GA",120,102,156,3.0,8/9/2015,"I expected this place to be a little more lively on a Saturday night. It was definitely busy, but it's not a Bar Louie kinda time. :-(. Foods still awesome like the others I've been too. Waitress was friendly and made honest menu recommendations. California Club and pepperoni flatbread tasted amazing!! Glad she told us you can split the order into two different choices. I wouldn't recommend the ahi tuna tho. Didn't try the garlic wings and Mac n cheese but heard they are INCREDIBLE."
Z J.,"Huntsville, AL",0,50,,4.0,8/15/2015,"Went here for a beer last week. Did not eat any food, but I can tell you the bartenders are good and there is a lot of beer choice. Must have 40 on tap.  The other good thing I'd say about the place is it's a great place to watch a sporting event, lots of large TVs."
Pamela M.,"Huntsville, AL",90,299,683,4.0,7/29/2015,"Monthly Girl's Night Out convened @ BJ R&B post work. I think our fearless leader reserved a table. She arrived at 4:45ish to claim the table & the restaurant was not busy. It didn't take long for it to really fill up! Here's the skinny: Large, warehouse styled interior, maybe 20 ft ceilings? Covered patio. Large bar. Open styled kitchen in back separated from dining room by Plexiglass. Relentless fruit flies, & a lot of them. Fairly noisy. Menus will preclude your gym curl routine coz they weigh a ton. Staff, friendly, but semi-stressed, maybe she was overseated. Various runners bring your dishes. I think they are still running on their out of town crew aka ""store openers"" staff to get the joint ""off on the right foot."" So, expect smaller portions & less slick service & smiling faces in the upcoming weeks. Many of our ?s could have been alleviated if they had enough table tents listing the HH specials. In between trying to *hear* our server & then process what she said, before she would add, ""I need to grab desserts for them, I'll be right back"" during which time, we would get half of the specials, but not the whole picture. Even adding a page to the voluminous menu including the HH specials would have helped.  Anyhoo, on to the eats & whatnot. It was ""wine down"" Tuesday, so all bottles were half price & all glasses were half price all night long, so a nice pinot grigio was ~ 3.95. Other specials were $1 off certain beers. That's about all I could catch on the HH drink specials. Small plates were 1/2 price on some, & the mini pan pizza was $5.00. The HH prices were completely on point. The wine list was solid & beer lovers will not be disappointed. However, after one beer, my friend was told they had sold out of the beer she was drinking. She found a suitable substitute.  Our 4-some shared the following:  Spinach & Artichoke Dip (described as ""A rich & creamy blend of spinach, artichokes, cream cheese & spices, topped with Parmesan cheese. Served warm with crisp corn tortilla chips."" )- the artichokes were fresh tasting & abundant, otherwise, this was just like you get anywhere else.  Chicken Pot Stickers (described as ""Filled with chicken, onions, Chinese chives, ginger & garlic. Served with soy ginger sauce & topped with green onions & sesame seeds."" ) - again, st&ard fare pot stickers, a la PF Changs or any Asian place. Santa Fe Spring Rolls (described as ""Filled with chicken, black beans, red bell peppers, cilantro, sweet corn, jalapeños & jack cheese. Topped with pico de gallo & served with Santa Fe dressing & avocado cream sauce."")  - these were good, tightly rolled fried spring rolls, & even though they forgot the pico de gallo & we didn't ask for any, the other sauces were nice! I was afraid these would be the same ones served at Bison's & other sports bars, but they were unique & flavorful. Honey Sriracha Brussels Sprouts (described as ""Lightly fried brussels sprouts tossed in Big Poppa Smokers' Desert Gold seasoning with sweet sriracha crema."")  - we DEVOURED these sprouts! They were as good as Cork & Crust's on (even tho C&C dresses theirs w/ truffle oil). Personally, I would have enjoyed more heat from the sriracha, or a bottle of S. on the table. Still, a clear ""home run."" Crispy Fried Artichokes (described as ""Lightly breaded artichoke hearts fried crisp & sprinkled with Parmesan cheese. Served w/ lemon garlic aioli."" )-These were like Fried artichoke balls. They were good, but sort of a waste of a beautiful artichoke heart, IMHO. The rest of the group *loved* this dish. A squeeze of fresh lemon made the app pop, & I'm not sure we received the ""lemon garlic aioli."" So, you can do like me & pop the heart out, squeeze the lemon & savor the freshness. Mediterranean Deep Dish Pizza (~8 inches)(described as ""Fresh & delicious! Grilled chicken, basil pesto, roasted garlic, Kalamata olives, sun-dried tomatoes, feta cheese & sliced peperoncinis.) -As a non-pizza lover, & being really encouraged to ""try it"" - I did, & just scraped all the toppings off the crust, so I can't comment on the crust. The pizza made four high school cafeteria sized pieces & really did have good, fresh toppings with a lot of flavor.  A good value at $5 if your are into pizza. Order this before their HH ends at 6 All in all a good time, especially since we always have stuff to chat about. The fruit flies were a total annoyance, & borderline yucky, since we were in a booth at the back in front of the kitchen's plexiglass window, where the fruit flies converged, clinging to the plexiglass, & were joined by other flies just hanging around....come to think of it, I believe their is a garage door connecting the elevated bar area to the covered patio, because a thunderstorm rolled through & I recall the staff scrambling around to close the door - so voila! That's how the flies got in.  Go to BJ R&B, they offer lighter/healthier options, too, so it's not all fried food & pizza. Join their rewards program & earn free deserts & stuff."
LeeAnn R.,"Paulding, MS",15,34,9,4.0,3/11/2017,"This was our first time eating here and we were blown away! The only reason I didn't give five stars is because the Prime rib needed a little more seasoning. It was only the second week they had been serving that particular type of Prime rib. This place has over 50 different types of beer,  which I would recommend the berry blend. It was so good!!! I had the grilled chicken pesto pizza..soooo good! Also, the white cheddar mashed potatoes were to die for!! For dessert we had this white macadamia cookie thing(which I can't remember the name of) and it had icecream. It was amazing!!! As for the staff..they were all very friendly. Our waitress (who's name I cannot remember) was great. We ordered a salad and did not like it so she offered another that we might like to try. (She also looked like Anna Kendrick!)  We were there for maybe 45 mins to an hour and had two different managers check on us three different times, and we're so friendly. I would completely recommend this restaurant to anyone! Oh, and my dog loved the leftover prime rib!"
Thomas K.,"Petersburg, TN",1,2,,1.0,6/12/2016,"Absolutely the worst restaurant experience in my 34 years of life.  This is no exaggeration.  The following includes the details of my horrific experience: - Ordered 2 appetizers, none were delivered.  No explanation. - Ordered kid's spaghetti without suace.  Came with sauce. - Ordered Mahi and Shrimp entrée.  No shrimp. Waitress could have cared less.  Manager comes to the table and tries to sweet talk me.  No dice.  I was told a ""Senior Manager"" was cooking my shrimp personally... what a joke.  An hour and 30 minutes elapsed before I asked for the check.... still no entrée sitting in front of me.  Worst customer service in the history of restaurants.  The only way it could be worse is if the manager punched me in the head.  Seriously."
Krista L.,"Cullman, AL",1,26,10,4.0,7/29/2015,"My sister and I dined at this restaurant for lunch today. I was a little nervous after reading reviews that service would be bad, but I was pleased with our server. She was good about refilling our drinks and, while busy, never rushed us as we asked her questions.  We started with the avocado egg rolls. These were rather spicy and the main reason I didn't give the restaurant a five star review.  We had a deep dish pizza next and it was good. Surprisingly large for the mini.  Our dessert was the best part of the meal and I would definitely suggest saving room. Portions are large on all dishes and we were left with four extra egg rolls and two pieces of pizza (and we ordered the mini pizza to split).  All in all - a good experience."
Zach S.,"Winchester, TN",1,11,2,3.0,6/24/2016,"We had never been here before, so we thought we'd give it a try! The staff seemed nice and friendly. The wait to get our food was very, very long! I got the Personal Pizza and when it finally made its way to our table I was a little scared when I saw what it looked like...But it's taste was decent. Not the best pizza, but not the worst... Just Decent."
Lisa S.,"Tampa, FL",48,43,8,4.0,5/7/2016,"Only been here once but we were seated in a reasonable time for the time of day on the weekend at a busy shopping area.  The service was friendly and relatively attentive.  The food that my dining companion and I ordered met our expectations and was delivered in about 20 minutes which seemed adequate for what was ordered.  Beer selection was decent but didn't 'Wow' me from a place that calls itself a brew house.  All in all, I'd say worth a try."
