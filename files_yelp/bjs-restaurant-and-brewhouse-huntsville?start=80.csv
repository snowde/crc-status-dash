Joshua M.,"Rosemont, IL",0,6,,2.0,6/21/2016,"Don't get me wrong . . . the food was GREAT!  The customer service upon entry . . . less than desirable.  When I walked in, the greaters (2 of them) looked right at me and then turned around and ignored me.  Finally I was able to get there attention and they acted like I was an inconvenience.  I'll be back because I like the food, but don't expect to be greeted with a smile."
Zack M.,"Madison, AL",83,36,111,4.0,7/11/2015,"Being a huge fan of beer and pizza I had to check out Bjs Brewhouse. My first experience was impressive even though it was opening night. I got lucky and was aimed towards a table for 2 on the East side of the bar near the window, which was perfect cause I was meeting my Dad for some beer. My server Chelsea recommended The Oasis Amber homebrew, so I did. The beer was perfect compared to the one I chose afterward (TheJeremiahRed). After first glimpse of the menu, my eyes were stuck on Carnitas Fries. Overall a good first impression. Looking forward to trying some more items on the menu."
Karen M.,"Destin, FL",0,3,1,1.0,7/7/2016,The service was painfully slow. The food was okay but not worth the price. The adult food came out 15 minutes before the kid food.
Todd S.,"Murfreesboro, TN",13,3,,1.0,8/2/2016,"Was told to seat our selves in the bar but tables were dirty, so we went outside and waited over 10 minutes and no one showed, also table were all dirty. Came back inside booth was finally clean. Sat down for another 5 minutes still no service! Will not be back!!!!!"
Sharon R.,"Hartselle, AL",1,13,,3.0,6/13/2016,"I gave it 3 stars because it was just okay. I would like to give 5 stars to Cameron, our server, because he did a great job. The food was fine, but nothing wow or amazing about it. I did order the asparagus appetizer but it was too tough to even bite through. My husband enjoyed his beer choice.  I did not like the fact that the cocktail menu didn't give the price for the different drinks. I am not some scrooge about money. I just like to know what I'm paying for. I ordered one anyway and it seemed to be a low alcohol version and then to find on my receipt that I had just paid $10 for it was really disappointing. Again, I will say that the food was just ok nothing spectacular, but we did have great service."
Micha C.,"Huntsville, AL",1,27,7,3.0,5/3/2016,"The food was pretty good, everything seemed made fresh. They had alot of options for beer and even house made sodas and beers of their own. The service was friendly and quick. I won't go again on a weekend, though, there were waaay too many crying babies and kids running around for my taste. Otherwise it was good stuff all around!"
Dennis N.,"Lincoln, NE",41,59,58,5.0,9/28/2015,"Had lunch here with my wife while taking a break from shopping. A little noisy but not bad for a brew house. They had a great menu with several salads & Lo cal options (listing the caloric info too!) that made it easy to find some very tasty options.   I had the kale & Brussel sprouts salad with goat cheese, grapes & pecans (440 cal) my wife had Salmon (at 590 cal) & total bill of just $26 was reasonable.  We had never been to a BJ's since we're from Nebraska ."
Bianca P.,"Gulf Shores, AL",85,15,8,5.0,6/11/2016,"Upbeat, friendly with great food! We've been several times and always consistent. If you haven't been just it go. We sure plan to again."
Captain C.,"Harvest, AL",0,36,1,3.0,7/14/2015,Food was better than expected BJ special pizza was missing meatballs PB&J Pizzolli was missing jelly drizzle and was only a third of the portion pictured on the table tent Server was very attentive I received refills faster than I could drink them and the check was dropped before the dessert was delivered   I would try them again hopefully just teething pains wanted to give them 4 stars  keep improving
Aurthur M.,"Huntsville, AL",0,1,,2.0,1/7/2017,Went in and sat at a high top across from the bar 10 minutes no one even looked or way. The only way to get service is to sit at the bar. Great food great bar tenders. That's why the bar was warped.  Fire the Managers as the wait staff.
Maryanne C.,"Huntsville, AL",2,11,13,5.0,3/14/2016,"The food is fantastic! Joel was an excellent waiter as well. So kind and thoughtful and extremely efficient. He loves his job, it's obvious!"
Wil M.,"Huntsville, AL",18,15,8,5.0,7/11/2015,"We placed our reservation online, for a 50 min wait time.  It took us only about 15-20 mins. The atmosphere is great and I love that they close at 1am on weekends compared to everything thing else in Hsv. Had the Mahi-Mahi, very awesome and my gf had the Jumbalaya which was just as awesome. We had wings for appetizer which was delicious and my In house brew beer was very flavorful. Even the Pizookie's were delightful. We waited a long time for our food which was the only drawback but for the prices and how they tasted, it was well worth the wait. No big deal there but then again I'm not too picky when it comes to that type of stuff. Our server was very attentive but didn't bombard us with soda or water like at a Applebee's. Excellent experience overall. Will be coming back soon."
Nat K.,"Huntsville, AL",4,26,14,4.0,3/6/2016,Been here three times now so far the beer selection is great but always have hard time ordering off the menu because it a lot of stuff but not a lot different items.   I have gotten pizza twice and the ahi salad.   All of it was great.
Brittany M.,"Madison, AL",0,16,1,2.0,6/6/2016,"Their food is just okay (except the pizza!  Omg that stuff is good!) and the drinks are very meh for the prices.  The service is up and down not consistently good or consistently bad, just is.  It's not a place I want to go to or remember to go to, to be quite honest.  It exists only for when I have a hankering for a piezookie."
Betty E.,"Huntsville, AL",0,3,,4.0,4/26/2016,"We went for the first time this past weekend. We aren't really beer drinkers, so we went for the food. Our meals were amazing! I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a meal so much! I would've given 5* but our waitress was not on the ball! I never got a refill, no condiments were offered, we had to ask, and she just wasn't attentive enough...otherwise, we will be back! Can't wait to bring friends and family !!"
Malcolm H.,"Huntsville, AL",0,1,,1.0,11/26/2016,"My family of 5 visited this restaurant for the second time. Our food was good. Upon leaving we noticed that the workers in the kitchen were not wearing gloves! Not only that, someone was texting on their phone while preparing the food without gloves! Phones are filthy! We will not be returning due to those poor hygiene practices. I was shocked to see such disregard for food safety in a restaurant where the kitchen is visible by the customers."
Frank U.,"Birmingham, AL",6,178,318,4.0,3/25/2016,Very crowded on a Thursday night. Overall good experience. They were slammed so I can't comment on the service. The staff was helpful and recommended a few drinks that were very good. The wings are fantastic!! All the food looked great
Britney H.,"Madison, AL",1,6,,3.0,4/14/2016,This place is really good for lunch. The price is acquit for the food you get. Dinner was crazy when we went. Poor waitress was so lost. I felt bad for her and our food was messed up but it is still worth going there.
Fletch F.,"Marietta, GA",0,73,4,4.0,2/18/2016,"Really enjoyed it. Dry rub wings with sriracha sauce were great. Great ambience, good service, good beer."
Aly A.,"Madison, AL",0,20,20,4.0,2/23/2016,"Each time we eat at Bjs it's a fun and delicious experience. They have yummy and innovative drinks in addition to their own brews. The food is good, and is delivered quickly and hot! Their wedge salad is so fresh and they have my favorite bleu cheese dressing! Service is friendly and quick!"
