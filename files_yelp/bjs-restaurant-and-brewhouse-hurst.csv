Chantel D.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,31,18,5.0,11/26/2017,"I love this place! I have been going to BJ's for years but I wanted to comment on the service and consistency that I experience each time. It's phenomenal. My food of choice would be the chips and queso & California Club Flatbread, it has a nice crunch to it and the flavors are spot on delicious. I also can't leave without the cookies & cream pizookie. I usually order it without the whip cream garnish and it melts in my mouth. The heat of the freshly baked cookie and the cold of the creamy ice cream is a huge wow factor. BJ's menu has something for everyone. The drinks are great as well, I enjoy the Long Island Ice Tea and my husband is a huge craft beer drinker.  The overall atmosphere is really nice, we usually go on the weekends due to multiple TVs with different sports showing. If you go with a group bigger than 4 people I would recommend going in the afternoon or doing call ahead seating in the evenings to minimize your wait time."
Dru T.,"Denton, TX",26,100,98,4.0,10/11/2017,"I am becoming a regular at this location lately, and here some observations from my recent visits: The positives: Waitress Rachel S was an excellent server, was kind, attentive and helpful.  I love their flatbread pizza and wings.  The two go together excellent.  I love their Lightswitch Lager as well. I like their selection of TVs everywhere playing sports. Their pizookies are ridonkulous. (Good) Negatives: one time out of several visits, my flatbread was lukewarm and chewy and did not seem fresh like the other times. The same visit my beer was warm. Might have been a fluke situation, as those two things have been consistently excellent every other visit.  The wings are very hot and even the regular mild wings make my nose run, which is awkward with cloth napkins.  I don't want to blow snot in a napkin that will be reused.  That being said, our waitress brought me a stack of cocktail napkins when I brought it up and that helped. The price is pretty high, it's kind of low lit at night, and they keep it FREEZING in there.  I always bring a jacket, even in Summer. All that being said, I go pretty often and I do love it.  Just dress warm, bring your own napkins or wet wipes, and make sure you have an extra 40 or 50 bucks in your account."
Genevieve P.,"Grand Prairie, TX",34,57,94,4.0,8/20/2017,"Our group of 11 went yesterday and service was spot on... our waitress was super friendly and attentive.  Deep dish Mediterranean pizza was pretty good I'd have to say, along with the bacon Ranch pizza. Yum. I really liked their Sriracha brussel sprouts. I would definitely order those again. Everyone enjoyed the food.  Dessert ruled the day! Monkey bread pizookie was awesome, followed by salted caramel and chocolate.  It's  a lot of chocolate though in the triple chocolate so you have to love chocolate.  I think we ordered every dessert they had just about.  Overall, good service,  good food, good ambiance and great dessert."
Captain A.,"Fort Worth, TX",1,1,5,5.0,12/27/2017,Love this place. Highly recommend the ribeye or the huge pork chop with a Jeramiah Red beer
Kevin S.,"Hurst, TX",6,92,121,5.0,6/16/2017,"First off, GET THE APP! The App alerted me the  appetizer was free with $9.95 purchase until the 17th. Cha ching $$$$. Order of Rootbeer glazed wings were $11 but got them for free. In fact, they may have owed me money had I stopped at $9.95. Fuzzy math style. The wings were the absolute truth. Last supper level but Judas wouldn't be offered a single one. Snitches get stitches, not wings. They balanced crispy fried wings that were super moist once snapped into, with a sweet, sticky Root Beer flavor glaze. Did not anticipate them being that darned good, and how much? Zero dolla make honey boo boo holla. And all because they have an app. Also, rewards members get to cut in line for a table or reserve a seat and order ahead. A Yessiree. So the salad could use some help. Spring mix with iceberg mixed in. Why? Iceberg lettuce is for rabbits not adults. They need to bring it up to match their pizza. The Pizza. As always, perfect pie crust, oodles of meat toppings, lots of shrooms and diced Roma, cheese enough to make a man full. This is a bite to savor from start to finish. The server truly worked the table. Truly over the top service. Smiles galore, informative about what was really good and was right. I love honesty over sales quotas.  The bathroom was super clean and smelled good for a place of business where business is placed. TMI? Nah, you need to know the place from back to front has to be clean or I don't eat there. No pun... Okay that was a pun obviously. WTF? That may have been my first triple pun. Go with it where it takes you. That got weird. All in all those rating it lower than 4 must have an Italian Grandmother making them pizza old country style and flying it in.  Did I mention the app had me paid out before the meal was done, tip slider was nice."
Sean F.,"Haltom City, TX",202,109,630,4.0,6/8/2017,"My wife and I enjoy BJ's atmosphere and food. The menu is rich and we like trying new things when we visit. I recommend the Kale and Brussels sprouts salad which she s one of my favorites. They have a texting system to let you know when your table is ready and usually we don't feel rushed to finish and go. We like to take our time and enjoy it. Waiters are on point for the most part and the bar is pretty cool. It is not loaded with kids and personally I rather have less kids and more adults in a place like that. I recommend mostly for adults, business and couples. We will definitely return."
Tram N.,"Bedford, TX",39,187,651,3.0,1/2/2017,"Came in and was able to be seated right away.  Server was nice and our food came out in a timely manner. Place was clean but our silverware wasn't, which turned me off. Requested for new ones which were still dirty/sticky so I used lemon from my appetizer to clean it  If you want a place for pizza and beefy burgers this place will satisfy your cravings. Pizza could've been more saucy but I know to ask next time. Burger was really meaty.  They do have a huge selection at the bar but didn't order any alcoholic beverages. Maybe next time"
Charli D.,"Irving, TX",0,26,4,1.0,11/21/2017,"I stopped by for the first time and ordered the Kale/Brussel sprout salad w/blackened salmon for lunch. It cost $16.98!! If I was mining for Kale I would be broke because not a single, leaf of the salad greens was actually Kale. I guess they believe their customers are stupid or don't know the difference. I addition, the Brussel sprouts were cold, bland and limp like they boiled them a couple of days ago. Oh, BTW did I mention it took an employee 10min at the peak of the lunch hour to come from the kitchen to take my order? Fool me once shame on me...fool me twice, shame on me. Let's just say it's my first and last time."
Jan F.,"Colleyville, TX",53,303,123,1.0,3/27/2017,"I am sorry to say that my long absence from this restaurant has not resulted in an improvement. We met a friend for lunch and all ordered from the lunch menu.  Soup and salad.  Sounded good enough with several selections available for both soup and salad.  I opted for a chicken tortilla soup and a wedge salad. The soup was SALTY beyond belief, and could not be eaten.  Because I normally am on a low salt diet, sometimes others do not have my reaction but after tasting it, all at my table reacted the same way, as did the waitress.   The over saltiness is a major issue.  However, though the waitress was sympathetic and offered me a substitute of anything else (this particular menu option features unlimited refills of soup/salad), I was not able to report the offensive soup until the check had been delivered and others were finished with their meals.  I did try a small amount of the clam chowder and it was better though not something I would ever order again. The wedge was acceptable as was a companion's caesar salad (dressing also very salty).  One friend loved her fried chicken and a mini pizza received a 'just OK' verdict. We wonder why the chef, if there is one, does not taste the soup?  The kitchen appears to be poorly supervised.  Service was a bit slow, and especially in this situation, I would have appreciated a courtesy stop by the waitress to assure that everything was OK.  I could never catch the eye of anyone to report the Salt soup.  Many other restaurants would likely have comped my meal. Sorry to report that we will not be anxious to ever return."
Colin C.,"Amarillo, TX",0,4,,3.0,11/25/2017,"Biggest disappointment is the kid's Mac - truly it is only Kraft brand Mac n cheese. Kid's menu aside, the food is average. Brussels sprouts appetizer was flavorful with a bit of spice but the quest lacked character. Beer was very good, clean and flavorful. Better to drink than eat."
Brian S.,"Punxsutawney, PA",0,6,3,4.0,11/16/2017,Great service . The food was very good along with the server. There are lots of tv's to watch your favorite sports event
Art H.,"Granbury, TX",41,4,,5.0,11/12/2017,What an awesome place food great service awesome went there for Veterans Day.  Had what we thought was a nothing issue and Manager discounted both of our checks almost down to nothing
Andrew W.,"Fort Worth, TX",188,75,198,3.0,6/27/2016,"Big menu, good food, good service. BJs is the sports bar version of Cheesecake Factory. There is a massive menu, so if you haven't been here before, be prepared to study the menu for a while. Everything I've had here has been at least ""ok"", but most things have been pretty good. Burgers and pizza were really good. Chicken was a little dry when I had it."
Leslie J.,"Hurst, TX",23,2,2,3.0,7/28/2017,"The service needs A LOT of improvement! Both of our orders came out without french fries and they were never brought to our table. And then it took a very long time for our waitress, Kamaria, to bring us our check. The food was excellent, just would have liked to have received our full order."
Beibei C.,"Colleyville, TX",0,2,28,5.0,7/2/2017,"So good restaurant,the service also very well.A lot of choice of food and drink. I always like seating in the bar. We will feel very relax and comfortable.  The Dumpling and Chicken Lecture Wraps are so good as the chips of beer or Wine. We have been here several times. Sure will back again"
Tyronne F.,"Hurst, TX",0,1,,4.0,7/28/2017,"The ribs were great, Kay-Kay the waitress never did get my fries. Then I'm about finished with my ribs and I tell her to cancel the fries and she said "" you don't want them""...ah no.  Then my drink was less than half full and she did not even ask for a refill."
Susan S.,"Arlington, TX",52,201,1424,4.0,5/13/2016,"Love this place. Great craft beer, tasty food, lots of good food on the menu & friendly service! I recommend the pizza, burgers & tortilla soup. They also have a nice selection of wine.  BJ's is great for a group after work happy hour, watching a game or a party. I love it!!"
Connie H.,"Cape Girardeau County, MO",25,40,103,4.0,5/4/2017,"Love BJ's. Good food, good cocktails and great service. I go to the restaurant at North East Mall. When I'm looking for a consistent meal that won't break the bank, BJ's is my ""go to"" place."
SANDRA G.,"Hurst, TX",12,19,,4.0,9/25/2017,"Enjoyed a great dinner tonight.  Friendly staff behind the bar, great service. I ordered the baked potato along with my favorite Parmesan crusted chicken which blended well. (The broccoli is weird tasting, can't identify why, never order it again). The butter on the potato tasted old and just took it off. Love the Jeremiah Red Craft brew, very flavorful and blends well with the chicken. Ordered a monkey bread pazookie which is always good and freshly made. Ice cream is a vanilla bean which is good just by itself. One of my favorite places to eat."
Joe G.,"North Richland Hills, TX",0,4,1,3.0,9/21/2017,"Bj's is an easy choice the food is good and service is friendly BUT...They are very very slow in the kitchen. I understand they lost they're best cook and its been the cause of the food process slow down. Please hire help it's causing me HANGRY issues.  Plus my wife loves the pizookies & I really like the pot stickers, but I'm starting to question Bj's as a 2nd or 3rd choice in dining ."
Vivian H.,"Euless, TX",203,54,13,4.0,9/17/2016,Good food...lots of menu options. Chill relaxed family environment. Some downsides are long lines but that's understandable especially during food rushes.  Now this is a place I'd visit again but something to work on is curbside service. This has happened to me before where I schedule curbside pickup and I call but no answer. So great idea but not if I have to go in to pick it up...that's the whole point of curbside...am I right? My curbside orders are normally off like my dressing or drinks.  I never have these issues dining in but just an area of opportunity to work on and make your restaurant even more fabulous
Chalea A.,"North Richland Hills, TX",78,318,263,5.0,1/29/2016,"BJ's is my absolute favorite restaurant.  I have been here so many times.  I'm a member of their Premier Rewards program and love to earn points for rewards, like discounts and free stuff.  My favorite dishes are the ahi tuna salad, the shrimp tacos, the deep dish pizza, and the avocado dip with chips.  Everything here is so good, though. The service has always been excellent.  lots of room so never a long wait, and once when my salad tasted weird the manager personally came by to check it out and comp that part of my check.   There are a ton of drinks and desserts to choose from.  I get a pazookie every time, the smores is my fave. Great place for a date, group, or to watch the game on multiple screens. The atmosphere is really nice. I'm def a fan!"
Lauren M.,"Fort Worth, TX",273,219,642,2.0,1/28/2016,"Hubby Ross, friend Carlos and I met for dinner tonight.  No wait, big booth and a very nice server. Fried cheese sticks for appetizer were just ok....no real flavor and about one tablespoon of marinara.  Had better ones at our local sports bar.  Hubby got avocado egg rolls and said they were ok. Ross ordered the salmon quinoa bowl, which he proclaimed as bland.  He actually didn't even finish the small plank of salon because it was tasteless.  Pretty pricey considering they didn't deliver any real value with the flavors. Carlos got some burger with avocado and jalapeños and really liked it.  Came with seasons potato wedges which he enjoyed too. I got the chicken pita tacos and they were yummy!  Subbed out a wedge salad for their quinoa or grain side dish and it was good too. Great service, timely check backs and mediocre food overall.  Perhaps their menu is so expansive they can't get everything right? Happy eating!"
Connie H.,"Hurst, TX",0,14,11,4.0,11/18/2016,"The app sucks. It found my acount, let me log in, then said it couldn't find my accoint. I finally gave my phone number to the bartender and got my rewatds...wow... Food service...be sure to order in stages or your food piles up when eating at the bar. A good happy hour through.  $5 wine...yippee! The food isn't completely objectionable....still better than cooking."
Lex W.,"Fort Worth, TX",294,323,1416,3.0,1/5/2016,"Beautiful BJ's Brewhouse located on campus of North East Mall. Looks new inside. Easy to be seated within a few minutes during lunch rush hour. There's ample seating, with lots of booths and tables. The bar is huge and I noticed a huge selection of beers and drinks in the menu. I plan to visit again just to try the drink menu! Lunch items are reasonably priced. I got a bowl of soup in a bread bowl for 6.50, the bread bowl is an extra 2.50. The chili is good and the bread bowl buttery and crispy.  There's something for everyone. Traditional entrees, individual pizzas, tacos, burgers, fish and chips, salads, soups, etc. Seems like pub type food/American food. Where I was sitting I saw five TVs. So, a good place to watch the game. Our server was attentive and the manager came and checked on us which was nice. I'd come back!"
Billie S.,"Fort Worth, TX",58,72,342,2.0,11/19/2015,Husband and I went on a spontaneous date last night here.  The hostess just stared at us when we walked through the door. No greeting and a tad rude...but we didn't let that ruin our evening.  They sat us right away and our server was very helpful! (However she did mention that the cook in the back was new and his steaks were a hit or miss).  I went with the jambalaya and my husband went with the pepperoni pizza. The pizza was delicious but the jambalaya was very salty. We ordered their beers which was reasonably-priced. ( I wanted wine but wasn't going to pay 10.75 for a glass. I read that Tuesdays are half off glass or bottle so if you're a wino go on Tuesdays)
Cheryl B.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,10,3,3.0,10/31/2017,"Eat here about once a month. Generally the service is good - every once in a while you may get someone slow or who just doesn't seem to want to be there. Food has always been good except for my visit last night.  Ordered the Fresh Atlantic Salmon and started eating on the thin end. (Wish they would just cut it to a proper filet and lower the price) When I got to the thickest part of the salmon it was not completely cooked (raw). Sent it back and the waitress came back with - ""the cook says it is cooked properly and is not raw"". I HATE being argued with about whether my food is cooked properly. She said she would bring me a new one (no thanks) or to put that one back on the grill some more. The cook offered to do that even though he said it was cooked. I opted for cooking it more and taking it home. Had it for lunch today and it was cooked all the way through. However I did have to pick pin bones out of it. Go figure.  Also had an issue with their points program - happens a lot - but it finally got straightened out."
Danielle T.,"Fort Worth, TX",138,245,309,4.0,7/12/2016,"This is the one place that everybody can agree on. Borderline overwhelming food and drink menu, so many great things to choose from. I love their pizza and cocktails, and my boyfriend loves the craft beer selection. The rewards program is also nice."
Kerry N.,"Keller, TX",170,271,818,4.0,6/20/2016,We are sad that you quit making the Thai app. It was the best!!! My husband loves the ribs and the Thursday special for them. The pazookie is always a hit.... the original is the best.
Guadalupe P.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,9,,1.0,7/28/2017,"Great food but lousy service...We came for the wings, fantastic!  We keep giving them 2nd, 3rd and 4th chances...but  our server was so mediocre, barely doing the minimum to get the job done, so sad. He acted like we were imposing on him!"
Juanita E.,"Watauga, TX",279,9,3,4.0,2/10/2017,"Atomosphere, decor and staff are great. Food is excellent and I'm never disappointed in anything I order and I always try something new. The 5 star was dropped because of a steak we got. Steak is a very tough item to get perfect and I don't blame the staff at all. The steak we got had a great flavor but was more rare than I expected, even though we said medium rare so that's par for the coarse I suppose. However, this was about a 50/50 steak. 50% fat and 50% lean. It was a a gummy and difficult to cut steak. We could have just got that one crummy steak in the batch they order but it was just awful quality from the supplier. All in all I am still very pleased with my visit and will still continue to dine here."
Ashleigh B.,"Carrollton, TX",455,326,114,4.0,9/30/2016,Came here while meeting family for dinner. It was crowded and funny seating arrangement but good nonetheless. Great appetizers and even better beer. Not the best in the world but a great hangout place.
Jonathan M.,"Euless, TX",0,70,,5.0,7/6/2017,"The Peruvian bowl is an amazing dish, one of the few in the area to use quinoa.  I am a fan of quinoa and very glad to find a large establishment get on board with something so healthy.  I have had this with salmon and shrimp but I know it is also available with chicken.  it comes with spinach, mushrooms and tomatoes (I sub broccoli for the tomatoes).  I ask for a bit of lemon and the dish is even more amazing.  Tomatoes probably add some acid and I guess the lemon makes up for it.  Wednesday's bartender is also amazing!  She makes a pretty good michelada. Historically I am not a fan of BJs and this review is for the recent visits to this location only.  They have quite the extensive beer selection and I can't even remember the in house brews...I hear many are popular.  They do have some wonderful German beers that are no so easy to find on tap and I go for those. Impeccable service and a great lunch make this location really stand out from the rest!"
Shane H.,"Plano, TX",3,85,13,4.0,9/19/2016,"I love BJ's Brewhouse. This one is on par with the others. Great service and good food. Stop in if you're in the area!  I always get the Fire Roasted Barbacoa Chicken. It's great and low calorie too. Chicken seasoned with Barbacoa seasoning, brown rice, black beans, Greek yogurt crema, and a salsa type sauce on the chicken. It's delicious.  Don't forget a Pizookie!"
Nicki G.,"Dallas, TX",1,15,15,4.0,5/28/2017,"Great service, waiter Steven was very attentive. Ordered sliders and calamari both were hot and good."
Stacy S.,"Dallas, TX",0,9,,1.0,1/24/2017,"1/24/2017: While I appreciate a response to and an apology for our terrible experience, I did send an email to the address given about a week ago, but have not received a reply.  1/12/2017: Two bartenders at the bar tonight, but we finally gave up and moved to a table when they didn't look our way for quite some time. I asked the hostess if we could have a booth for two (at least 10+ open that we could see) and she asked if we could give her a couple of minutes; it seemed that sorting the stack of menus was the priority. While being seated at the booth, the hostess asked if we were ready to order...literally before we even had a menu in our hands. I said that we will need to look at the menu. After another 10 minutes of sitting in the booth without being greeted... I went back up to the hostess and asked if we had a server. She said yes, but they are busy right now. That's fine...but plenty of employees were walking around and socializing in front of our booth...yet nobody realized we had been waiting there, not even the manager. Finally, someone acknowledges us after being instructed to be another hostess. I ordered a glass of wine...another 10 minutes passes before that arrives. We order our food. ThAt comes out and I have to ask the food runner to grab us ketchup. Also had to ask another sever if the garlic bread is coming... it was supposed to be with the pasta but wasn't delivered to our table. The other server brought out a roll, and it was actually black on the bottom. I waited tables for many years, so I completely understand that a table may get overlooked, a drink may take a while to get to the table, the food may not come out right, the server may forget something...but no excuse for all of this on one visit. And nobody addressed any of these issues after we brought it to the staff's attention."
Nathan G.,"Galveston, TX",21,9,3,5.0,9/24/2017,Had an amazing experience tonight! I had a spinach dip and vegan lentil soup that was excellent! Not to mention pretty cheap as it was happy hour. Props to our server who had to deal with our weirdness!! Will definitely be returning!
Terry H.,"Euless, TX",43,437,221,4.0,9/16/2016,Cantina chicken flatbread was a great choice to split and not to heavy.  Service was good. Drinks were better.  This is a sports bar and with that its loud. I didn't think it was to excessively loud tonight. More than I like but acceptable for a sports bar.  Seated right away which was very good.  I'll be back.
Mindy C.,"Fort Worth, TX",155,344,68,3.0,12/8/2015,"BJ's normally has QUICK SERVICE. I've found that you can order something very last minute and if you go to pick it up, it'll be ready when you get there. Even if you're calling in the order from the car whilst already driving. Although they are not reliable when it comes to their curbside pick up. I've had to go inside to get my order every single time I've tried to do curbside. What happens is that you are suppose to call the number on the sign, in the curbside pick up spot. Then someone is suppose to answer and bring out your food. No one has ever answered, thus making me go inside to get it. Completely makes the curbside pick up offer USELESS.  I've also encountered that they do not handle a group of 10+ very well. Most restaurants might struggle with a large group too so I discount this fact. Anyways...  AVOCADO EGG ROLLS, you'll WANT THEM. For those who don't know, egg rolls are not any type of traditional food. They were invented in America/for Americans. So to say they are good for something ""Americanized"" isn't completely correct, but you get where I'm going with it. They have a great amount of avocado in them. They come fried and with a sweet dipping sauce. The sweet dipping sauce is very good but you can tell how terrible it is for you. Not that the rest of it is much healthier either haha. They are categorized as a shareable appetizer, but for someone with a small appetite, it can definitely be a meal.  They have a decent lunch specials menu, beginning at $5.75. They have an unlimited salad and soup option, which is always good for variety. I don't particularly like their caprese salad but I can be a cheese snob. It's another option next to traditional salad options; cesar or house. They have a strong tomato bisque soup and their broccoli cheddar is VERY GOOD. They also have a one topping personal pizza option, which kind of sucks. It's ~$7.75 and then 50 cents extra per topping. For an already small option, it's not priced accordingly in my opinion. Their pizzas are VERY GREASY THOUGH and could use more pizza sauce. I normally DON'T ORDER THEIR PIZZAS. But I think their known for them? I've had some of their other entrees and their salads, so you can't really go wrong here as a quick, good lunch option. Dessert here is SO GOOD. Pazookis (is that how you spell it) which you get one for free on your bday. Is a type of cookie and a type of ice cream scooped on top. The cookie is warm so it melts the ice cream a bit. It's just the right PERFECTNESS you want and expect from BJ's. It's their twist on the traditional molten cakes a lot of ""American"" restaurants offer.  My normal chain restaurant disclaimer: I like to comment more about the service, cleanliness, and the process experience when it comes chain restaurants because these are the main factors that vary between them. They all have the same menu. Although I go into more details regarding the menu here because despite this being a large chain, I have known many people who haven't had it before."
Mary Elizabeth W.,"New Orleans, LA",109,119,39,5.0,12/16/2015,"After a looooooong drive from New Orleans to Hurst, TX, all we wanted was a warm meal and a cool beer and BJs delivered both! My boyfriend got the deep dish pizza which was amazing and I got a burger, which was exactly what I needed that night. We finished the meal with their warm cookie dessert before going back to the hotel to pass out! The service was great, very quick and friendly, and the food was very good. I would definitely eat here again if I find myself in Dallas again."
