Lynda B.,"Colorado Springs, CO",1,161,4,4.0,5/19/2016,We are from CO but here working. Glad to find a BJs close to our hotel. Love 1/2 price wine on Tuesdays. Was glad to see the consistency with another BJs. Hubby loves the mini deep dish pizza and I love the Srircha dryrub wings. My only complaint is the celery. Had to cut the ends off of a couple. It happens to me in CO too. That area needs a little work.
Kat L.,"Euless, TX",51,29,2,2.0,4/28/2014,"A prime example of how an expansive menu leads to a lack of excellence. BJ's has an amazing atmosphere. Its a little dark and cozy, and the booths are comfortable. The bar is beautiful, and the patio is so great. Unfortunately, that's where the praise ends. I really WANTED to like BJ's. I TRIED. Wicked hard. But service is hit or miss with a little more missing than hitting, and the food is seriously lacking. Don't waste any time on the low calorie menu. Everything on it is TERRIBLE. They send out the Mahi like a slab of rubber - even if you expressly ask your waitress for your fish to be cooked rare! The Santa Fe spring rolls and the avocado eggs rolls are absolutely to die for, but i get sick every time we eat them. Seriously, beer and pizookie. That's all you need to get here."
Ben H.,"Hurst, TX",5,48,12,5.0,6/20/2015,"I have eaten here many times. Although I do have a relative working at this location, objectively j would say the food is well above average for a chain restaurant. WAY better than chilis or Applebee's! Their beer is solid, but some of their non-store brand tap selections are way better. The service is good and fast and the tall TV's in the bar make it so most everyone can see the game in the restaurant. Overall probably one of the nicest places to eat around northeast mall."
Errol W.,"Tulsa, OK",21,17,4,4.0,7/23/2014,"Had a ball! Good food good drink. Would have given 5 stars busy server never refilled out drink, they could have made more money at my Table if they would have said can I get you another beer. Overall a good experience."
Karen T.,"Collingswood, NJ",53,667,117,5.0,7/11/2012,"This place was pretty empty when I went one night for dinner and a couple beers, but I am surprised why. It is on the outskirts of the mall, but the food was pretty good and you couldn't ask for a bigger selection of beers, both their own and others.  As one of the other reviews noted, Brandi is incredibly nice and considerate as a bartender, asking if you want a sample of a beer if it isn't something you've had before, etc.  They also have a happy hour with bar discounts in the evening after the traditional happy hour. One thing that was good and bad was the music they played. It isn't a jukebox, but they went from some cool interesting tunes (Bjork, MIA, etc.) to mid 70s songs and then back again. Imagine if a teenager and a 60 year old were fighting/alternating songs and that is how it seemed. Overall, if you're in the area, I would highly recommend."
Haley K.,"North Richland Hills, TX",67,530,71,2.0,8/30/2013,"The first time we came here, we had a very good experience. I had a pizza and it was better than delivery but nothing in comparison to the good sit down pizza places or a good hole in the wall place. I cant recall what the hubby had but he said it was what you'd expect out of a chain.The main calling here is all the drink variety. I had a friend who wanted to try this place out and lives just to far away to trek out on her own so we went ahead one day she was in the area anyway and had stopped by for a  visit.  Please note my friend is type one diabetic who had just gotten off a 9-4 shift and hadn't really eaten since breakfast so she needed to eat.  The first time we had come we had been talked into getting a rewards card and I had gotten a half off large pizza offer w/free mini pizone so we decided to split a build your own. We could tell our waitress was having an off night, we all do, so we were patient with the slower service, its a Saturday night after all. We got our pizza, about 45-1hour in and my friend originally was turned off by the tomatoes ... our bad, no big deal we can scrape them off ... then we start eating and find other random toppings in our pizza, stray toppings maybe? When our waitress came back my friend was just going to order something else but I asked why we had all of these extra topping on our pizza and at first she asks us ""did you read the menu and see what toppings came on what you picked?"" until she remembered we ordered a build your own and put our order in wrong. No big deal, just don't yell at us about reading the menu when it wasn't our bad. After that was when it got weird. We ended up having a manager come take our order again, then we waited another 45 mins for our pizza to come out. So much for shopping at this point ... then when it came out it was wrong again. We flagged our waitress down and said we're done, we'll pay but we've been here nearly two hours and our orders been taken wrong twice. She ran and got another manager instead of dealing with us, he offered to comp our meal, but at that point my friend who really needed to eat was just wanting to leave to & get a sub sandwich to get her blood sugars  into check.  If we come back it will be after awhile, we understand bad nights ... its just tough with a person in tow who needs to eat in a timely manner ... and don't blame other people for mistakes that you made. :-/"
David S.,"Fort Worth, TX",1,28,6,4.0,5/13/2015,We eat here fairly often (among all the ones in the DFW area).  They can be hit miss - but more times more favorable than not...
Zainah U.,"Fort Worth, TX",31,40,41,4.0,3/18/2014,"Came for the pizookie, stayed for the pizza. The ""shareable appetizer"" flatbread margherita was both shareable and appetizing. I split one every time I come here now. It's super infused with herbs and crispy - better than any entree pizzas, or any other entrees ever, really."
Lisette A.,"Euless, TX",24,39,32,4.0,9/5/2011,"BJs has good food and an assortment of drinks. It's one of the better chain restaurants, in my opinion. The burgers are pretty huge, which is good for the carnivore's soul. The Seared Ahi Tuna Salad is pretty huge, too, and is definitely filling. The broccoli cheddar soup is thick and tasty and the fried calamari make for a delicious appetizer.  It gets pretty busy on weekend evenings but midafternoon Sundays are a great time to go. Plus the portions are pretty big so a 3 o'clock meal just may satisfy you for dinner! It does for me. The staff are pretty friendly and attentive and the music is good. It does tend to get a bit loud in there, though, and the ginormous televisions everywhere you look are distracting. I wish restaurants wouldn't use TVs because I like to converse during dinner. It gets difficult to do so when there's so much sensory overload, though. BJ's prices are a bit on the high end-- not too much so-- but your wallet will notice it."
Corina T.,"Keller, TX",88,274,78,2.0,5/18/2011,"I agree with Peter. ""Meh"" is a good word to sum this place up. We went out with some friends on Sunday - it was a little busy when we came in but it wasnt insane. We had a large group so we expected to wait a while for seating. Once we were seated it took our waiter a while to come around to take drink orders and bring them to us - this was pretty much the same issue with our meals, order taking, check etc. between waiting on our waiter and food we were at that restaurant for about 3 hours and we didnt even stick around to chat! We tried out their backed mac n cheese as a starter and that was surprisingly yummy. I really couldnt figure out what exactly I wanted so my husband and I decided to split a pizza since they sounded pretty decent from the reviews I read online. To me the pizza was simply alright although my husband didnt care for it a bit. it wasnt great but it wasnt bad. It was more on the bland side of things and it was a bit pricey for my liking. I took about half the pizza to go for lunch the next day and after sprinkling a little Parmesan on it it was actually better tasting straight out of the fridge the next day than it was fresh. Based on the value for the price and the length of time it took us to get through our meal I dont think i'll willing go back here - it was just average and not impressive in the least bit."
Courtney W.,"Palm Desert, CA",64,45,38,4.0,7/19/2015,"Good food & good service. The restaurant itself was a bit loud and there was just a lot going on. It was a little dark and hard to hear conversation. But the hamburger I got was to die for. It was so big that I couldn't finish it, so I took it home. Just as good the next day."
Katie H.,"Fort Worth, TX",2,38,82,2.0,8/22/2013,"Here's the deal - I come to this location to eat every few months because it is a central location for me to have lunch with a friend and catch up.  However, I don't know why we don't pick somewhere else.  The menu is much like Cheesecake Factory - it is huge with way too many selections.  How do they specialize in anything if they offer everything under the sun? I usually play it safe and order a Caesar salad and a personal-sized pizza or a flatbread pizza.  The pizzas are good but nothing super special to write home about.  I also have gone several times when I am in ""diet mode"" and ordered their Chicken Tacos which is on their 575 cal light section.  The tacos are miniature and you get three of them.  Together they equal probably one taco.  They are really good!  You also get a little slaw and black beans.  The black beans are really bland but edible.   This past time I went I ordered a Bleu Cheese Bacon burger with shoestring fries. It was DISGUSTING!!  The burger was cooked decent but was topped with an ungodly amount of bleu cheese.  Now. I like bleu cheese and can appreciate a decent amount but there was probably about 1/2 cup of melted bleu cheese on this burger.  It was excessive and looked like barf!  The bacon was not crispy - as a matter of fact - it looked like it was still partially raw!  Geez!  I had to scrap some of the bleu cheese of and set it aside which grossed out my lunch partner since it looked so disgusting.  Thinking back I should have sent it back to the kitchen but I hate to be a complainer!  Anywho ... if you want a place that cooks EVERYTHING and specializes in NOTHING then this is a good choice.  Probably will go again because its our reqular lunch spot - or maybe I will suggest we venture out. ENJOY - but beware of the bleu cheese excess!"
Dianne P.,"Euless, TX",0,1,1,5.0,6/3/2014,I had the California Club flatbread pizza and my husband had the Honey-Crisp Chicken Salad. Everything was excellent.
Darius D.,"Arlington, TX",1,12,,4.0,4/6/2014,I am new to the area and have tried BJ's twice both great experiences I don't understand why they seat two people in a booth that's meant for 5 to 6 people when there smaller tables and booths available  Beyond that the food is great the service is wonderful the price is reasonable.
Kyle W.,"Las Vegas, NV",6,221,1,2.0,9/16/2013,"Do not recommend for watching Sunday football. Brought my ipad to use , they do not have WIFI free or otherwise-no WIFI. May not be a big deal for some, but what sports bar/ restaurant doesnt have WIFI, Food was average at best"
Reena D.,"Euless, TX",516,808,939,4.0,11/6/2012,I prefer this location than the other locations as it doesn't get super packed and our waiter was very friendly.  We came here on a friday night with some of our friends.  The mojito light here is great.  There no artificial sweetener after taste!  I love their flatbreads here!  The spinach dip was pretty tasty as well.  Fun place to hang out.  The ambience is nice and they are opened late on fridays!
Shelley E.,"Euless, TX",26,76,140,2.0,10/17/2012,"Stopped for a Saturday lunch with my sweetheart before I tortured him at the mall.  We sat at the bar and started with a beer tasting (you can have 3 cute little glasses).  Oktoberfest is seasonal and perfect with a burger.  I was in the mood for a porter, but I didn't bother to think of how that would pair with the Ahi Poke.  Riiiiight.  Great brew - bad combo.  I should have ordered the Hef with the Ahi and saved the porter for dessert.  It was very coffee/chocolate.  I was a little put off by the enormous menu.  It is overwhelming.  I asked the bartender what they do the best - response, ""'everything"".  Not exactly the help I needed.  The Ahi Poke was light and fresh.  My husband enjoyed his burger and let me have a taste.  Good.  During the football games, the beers are happy hour price and not too expensive.  Basic burger with fries is about $10."
Eric W.,"Tarrant, TX",465,1198,4381,3.0,7/6/2010,"I've been wanting to try this place for a very long time (ever since I saw one open in Arlington). On this Saturday (7/3), on our way to see Toy Story 3, I finally got my chance.  There was a bit of a wait (afternoonish), but we used that time to look over the very extensive menu. I do think BJ's would be a good choice for a group when nobody can agree on where to eat, as I think there truly is something for everyone here.  Also during the wait I notice this little stack of business cards that reads ""Call ahead for a table 817-595-3705"", which would have been a great idea for us since we had a show time to make. You can also call ahead for food, or even order on-line. When you get to BJ's, you don't even need to get out of your car. Just call the number on the sign marking in the reserved ""to go"" spaces, and they bring the order out to you for curb-side pickup.  So Thuy decides on the ""THAI SHRIMP LETTUCE WRAPS"" (Grilled shrimp glazed with spicy Thai sauce, served on a bed of Napa cabbage, cilantro, carrots and red onion, all tossed with a fresh, minty mango salsa and sprinkled with toasted coconut. Served in butter lettuce cups with a spicy Thai sauce for dipping.). Dad and I decide to split a SPINACH & ARTICHOKE pizza. Yeah, he wanted something with meat on it, but I talked him out it.  As soon as we meet our server, we let him know we have a show to catch and that we are ready to order. With help from our server, we ordered a medium size pizza. He also tells us the pizza will take 15 minutes, so props for that. We'll be cutting it close to showtime, but we should be OK.  For drinks Dad goes for a ""handcrafted"" (never did find out what that means) cream soda, Thuy gets a ""fresh-squeezed"" lemonade, and I go for a beer (obvious choice). Now I thought I saw a sign on the way in that said BJ's was brewing a Belgium-style white beer, so that's what I ordered. What arrived was a bottle of Hoegaarden. Turns out whatever sign I thought I saw, was not for an in-house white beer, or so I was told.* Oh well. It's still a good beer, which I drank down thinking how I'll be more careful with my next beer order. The lemonade and soda were also OK, if you like that sort of thing.  So the food arrives and all I can say is everything is fine. Thuy's shrimp wrap thing is tasty. Our pizza is very good. While billed as ""thick crust"" it's not what I consider a ""Chicago-style"" thick crust. Compared to Chicago, BJ's is more of a medium crust, which to me is a good thing, as I don't like thick pizza. I also take this opportunity to order an actual ""brewed on the premises"" beer. I went to the other end of the spectrum and went with the TATONKA STOUT. I'd compare it to a Guinness, which is to say, I enjoyed it.  Other than the beer snafu (see below), It was a good experience. Service was a tad slow, and we did not get out quite as fast as we wanted, but we still made it to the theater before the movie started (previews were still rolling), so it's all good. I'll definitely be back, even if it's just to sit at the bar and try a few more beers (and maybe a personal-size pizza).  * Looking at BJ's web-site ( ), I do see that they have a seasonal ""Belgian-style Witbier (or White Beer)"" called ""NIT WIT"", available at ALL BJ's from June 1 to July 31. So I really do think I saw that sign right and our server messed up. I may go back for the sole purpose of clarification, and to actually drink one!"
Ryan H.,"Grapevine, TX",25,1,,1.0,6/15/2014,Awful service.   Waited 30 minutes with no service talked to three employees.   Still no service.   Don't expect to sit on the patio it's never open.    Not sure why they even have a patio.
Tara M.,"Bedford, TX",562,1290,1624,4.0,5/16/2010,"BJ's is our go-to restaurant choice for my large family when no one can decide what they want cause their menu is so extensive everyone can find something they want. I am surprised by some of the low ratings here because this is obviously a VERY popular place - every time we have dined here it has been very early around 5:30 and there was already a long wait.  Daddy always gets the loaded burger with onion rings instead of fries. The burger has Thousand Island dressing on it - which sounds horrible to me but he obviously likes it..  I liked both my Mom and Sissy's choices on a recent visit - the Cali Club Flat bread Pizza and Fish Tacos.  I have ordered their HUGE loaded potatoes - love the Chicken and Broccoli with a ton of cheese minus the Alfredo Sauce (icky) and I rarely order a salad but on my last visit I was not hungry so I ordered a salad that ended up being huge and delicious with roasted red peppers, tomatoes, red onions, feta cheese and Cajun blackened Shrimp. Half way through my salad I realized it was missing the artichokes listed on the menu. I mentioned it to our waiter when he brought our bill and he took my salad off - Wow! since it was still one of the best salads I have had in a long time!!"
