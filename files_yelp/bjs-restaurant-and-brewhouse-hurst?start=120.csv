Desirae B.,"Omaha, NE",581,621,125,2.0,4/21/2010,"Another sad chain restaurant installation in the Mid-Cities.....very depressing.  This place is PACKED everytime we go which tells me we NEED more restaurants in Mid-Cities!! And I'm sick of the chains! Will someone PLEASE open up a local restaurant around here......we are so desperate we are going to BJ's and Red Robin!  The food is mediocore - my sister had the shrimp lettuce wraps as an appetizer and the shrimp wasn't done so she sent it back - the waiter explained that they cooked it early that morning (it was 8pm) and they keep it chilled all day so when he brought out the replacement, it contained more partially cooked shrimp from the same batch. My cajun chicken pasta was a snore - could've been heated and served up from Schwann's. The only item we had that I could truly say I would go back for was their Irish Root Beer cocktail. BJ's - we are all just visiting you because there's no where else to go and we've been to Red Lobster, Olive Garden and Red Robin down the street too many times......your newness will soon wear off.."
Nathan H.,"Lubbock, TX",127,374,383,4.0,8/25/2012,"We went to BJ's to one night to meet some friends and the next morning I had this written on a napkin: 'Throwback cherry cola... Effen black vodka, some other kind of vodka, and a dash of awesomeness' Embarrassingly, I have no idea what we ended up eating, drinking, etc, but past me wanted to make sure (apparently) that I remembered the vodka. So, be careful going to BJ's because the night will escape you and enjoy the 'throwback cherry cola'."
Brandon H.,"Dallas, TX",410,90,86,4.0,8/21/2012,"My dad and I came in tonight for happy hour, they had 1/2 price mini pizzas. I had the sweet pig and it was delicious, and my dad had the works pizza. Very good for half off... So then we got the nacho's to share. Yum! I think they put cooking sherry in the chili do give it a sweet and spicy twang. Service was great. Loved it"
Portia H.,"New York, NY",54,364,223,3.0,1/20/2013,"This is a very convenient place to dine after you have had a shopping day in Best Buy.  Luis and I both say the drinks are A+.  They use Brand name liquors like Bacardi and Stoli. The waiter should have pointed this out before we ordered a bottle of Moscato, but Luis stopped him in time to switch and order a drink.   The dinner menu is like reading a dictionary, boring. I've been to BJs many times at other locations and it is a little bit better than Meh chain. We started with the Thai wantons. This is a wonderful offering compared to the last menu I saw years ago at BJs.  We should have kept ordering this appetizer because the steak left a lot to be desired.   The atmosphere is good and quiet. I liked it. I prefer the elevation of the bench seats at the Arlington Highlands, but prefer this location."
Brande K.,"Fort Worth, TX",1,6,,4.0,9/27/2013,"The avocado rolls are fantastic and the tomato soup in a bread bowl is decadent! I find that many of their items are overpriced, especially the adult beverages.  However they have some appetizers that are decently priced, including the flat bread pizza which is quite tasty.  I recently went for lunch and thought the lunch special were better priced than dinner."
Kevin G.,"North Richland Hills, TX",0,12,,5.0,1/16/2013,"The food here is fantastic every time... Favorites:  Avocado egg rolls, any of the pizzas, and several of the sandwiches and salads. Really, my only complaint is with the prices.  Particularly on the pizzas.  I don't mind paying good money for good food, but nearly $10 for a personal size pizza about 6"" in diameter... Seriously? All in all, the place is clean, there's a good beer selection, and the food never disappoints.  Plus, the pizzas are half price during happy hour.  Those things combined are enough to still earn 5 stars from me."
Steven H.,"Las Vegas, NV",276,170,9,4.0,12/17/2014,"The food came out late, but they handle it well and it tasted really good. I have always like their pizza. Any of their pizza is really good. It's like deep dish type pizza. I also love the drinks there. There are lots of choices to pick from!"
B H.,"Arlington, TX",8,25,8,4.0,8/29/2014,"Always good food and friendly staff.  Get the appetizer sampler,  if you want to share it is big enough and very good. Burgers are scrumptious. If you want a real classic burger they have it on the menu. The spring rolls are very good. Weakest link was our waiter but don't let that stop you."
Brandi N.,"Dallas, TX",141,299,326,3.0,7/17/2012,"Either the menu changed (likely), I'm crazy (which day of the week is it?), or the waitress just didn't know her menu (ding!ding!ding!).  I just wanted the classic cheeseburger that had sort of a hoagie bun that was really some sort of garlic, cheese bread with cheddar cheese.  The waitress said they didn't have it so I ordered a different, flavorless burger with all the toppings.  Ah well. They have lots of beers but I totally heart their berry cider!  This time, I ordered 2 of the tasters as well and I tried the blends.  The blends were good but just plain berry was best.   In summary, BJ's is pretty inside so I like that.  I didn't get the burger I normally get.  I didn't like that.  The cider hasn't changed.  I like that."
Chase B.,"North Richland Hills, TX",0,12,3,4.0,9/22/2015,"They have a great happy hour - post up at the bar, order some avocado rolls, wings, and a few beers and your day is complete. Bartenders are attentive and food good."
Nicole H.,"Houston, TX",104,10,,4.0,11/16/2012,Its really just the best! Great food. Great service. Its big and its appropriate for everything.  Bit pricey... but I love that. Keeps the riffraff out. Hallelujah!
Harry M.,"Dallas, TX",0,12,,2.0,3/31/2012,"This place is either not up to par with the rest of the BJ's in the country, or BJ's has recently changed.  Not a fan of the endless offerings of pale ales.  (Do they simply not know how to brew a lager?)  MINI bruscetta?  What are they french now? Bottom line:  spent $60.00 for dinner for two (w/ only 2 beers BTW) and received food comparable to a run of the mill Pizza Hut.  No offense to Pizza Hut intended."
Terry W.,"Grapevine, TX",15,112,4,4.0,6/13/2012,"We really liked our dinner here.  I had the ribeye steak and it was perfectly prepared and fairly tasty.  I have had better, but this is very good.  My wife enjoyed the salad she ordered. The best part was the Baked Beignet dessert.  Now that was incredible!  Perfectly prepared and delicious."
Matt W.,"Fort Worth, TX",16,32,17,3.0,3/17/2014,"Decent food and service.  A small step up from a chilis.  I will always go here with someone else if they want it, but I could never see myself picking this place to eat."
Mark A.,"Arlington, TX",127,6,6,4.0,5/18/2014,Great service. The manager Eddie took great care of our table. Food was not impressive when it came out and he brought out additional pizza on the house. Pro move
Navin A.,"Hurst, TX",13,60,9,1.0,5/16/2011,"My third time to a BJ's. Food wasn't the greatest in the other two (Cali & Az). Our waitress was attentive, gave us a chance to actually try the food. Refills were quick. Tonight I decided to try something different and went for a CFS. Any place I get a CFS at, I order it always the same. Fries instead of mashed potatoes and gravy on the side. I like CFS crispy! Sure enough it came topped with gravy instead of on the side. I politely told the person that brought the food, that I asked for the gravy on the side. He looked annoyed and said he would take care of it. Being experienced in this situation, I knew they would just throw the CFS back in the deep frier to get the gravy off. Out comes the CFS with a fried gravy stain on it and real soggy. Pissed off I just pushed the food aside, explained the situation to my waitress. She goes and gets the manager, but at this point I'm ready to leave. This place has prices similar to Cheese Cake Factory, but with smaller portions. Most of their appetizers are Chilies entree prices. I won't be back here. Save your money and see if you can hunt down a Bennigans! I topped my night of with two McDoubles, Mac sauce instead of ketchup and mustard and a value fry. At least McDonalds got my order right and the don't even speak English!"
Ali N.,"Fort Worth, TX",2,59,,3.0,3/15/2014,"Food is good and has varieties however service sucks so bad.  We went there for my dad birthday and it was unpleasant.  First we had to wait for over 30 min just to get a table which was ok by me.  But When we finally got the table we were also having to wait for a while to get our food ordered.  The waitress kept on forgetting to get what we asked for.  Even our appetizer took forever to come and and it did it was cold. I also noticed the plate for the appetizer was dirty it got food still stuck on it, I didn't make a big deal out of it I just put it aside and not use it.   Even after dinner we waited at least 30 min for the waitress to bring our check. It's unbelievable she obviously does not care about our time, that waitress sucks and I gave her what she deserved....a bad tips.   I ate here on several occasion before didn't  encounter this problem until now...maybe it's just that waitress."
Eddie M.,"Austin, TX",0,6,1,2.0,8/10/2011,"This was the 2nd time I've been to this restaurant and both times were sub par.  The total of our bill did not reflect the food or service of this place. My steak was over cooked and extremely tough. Baked potato for the size was very under topped. Our waitress had to keep reminding her self several times for our drink refills.  This place isn't terrible, but if you're wanting to spend a little more than normal, this place is not the place to do it."
Dirk N.,"Dallas, TX",0,637,144,5.0,7/22/2011,"I used to always say BJ's had the best pizza ever, but now I realize there are a bunch of pizza places that are equally good in their own ways. Deep dish-wise, BJ's is definitely my favorite. Love, love, love the Buffalo Chicken and Cheeseburger pizzas. Southwestern is good as well, along with others. I really like some of their beers as well (try the Jeremiah Red). Don't think we've gotten too many appetizers from them, but their Pizookies make the perfect end to the meal. No gripes with service at this location. Try 'em if you haven't!"
Laurie K.,"Olathe, KS",0,4,,2.0,10/2/2012,The food is good but the service is slow. My husband and I have eaten there on several occasions for the continual 'benefit of the doubt' reason but each visit we waited a considerable length of time before our food arrived at the table.  On one occasion we were at my husband's Christmas party and the server was inappropriately flirting with my husband.  She went as far as to stand behind him and rub his shoulders.  In my establishment that will get you released immediately.   Again the food is excellent...it's the service that gets this restaurant a two star review.
