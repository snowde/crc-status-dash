Mike H.,"Arlington, TX",18,4,,4.0,1/31/2014,"Always great on the service and the food!  Couple of hiccups tonight, but nothing earth - shattering"
R P.,"Chicago, IL",17,52,12,1.0,8/18/2013,"So tired of places insisting on single diners sitting at the bar.  I declined and was made to wait although 12+ seats for 2 were available.  Server was pleasant service good but you get poor rating...first impressions ARE everything!  The food itself was actually good, too bad the first impression by the seating hostess set a poor tone from the start."
Jane K.,"Fort Worth, TX",18,36,7,3.0,10/26/2013,"I've been to this BJs at least a dozen times. I can give it anywhere from 2-4 stars for each visit. It's a pretty average place! But if you like beer and average food, go for it!"
Jmw J.,"Dallas, TX",0,13,,2.0,7/13/2013,"The wife and I stopped in here, for the first time, this afternoon (7-13-13) for a late lunch. My wife has to eat gluten free and is always looking for a good GF menu. She had a GF cheese pizza and said it was one of the best GF pizzas that she has had. I'm glad for her because it is difficult finding good tasting GF menus.   I had the grilled chicken club sandwich (hold the avocado please) with fries. The fries were rubbery and I only ate a few. I'm not real sure what was going on with them, but I've had better at fast food drive thrus. No kidding. My sandwich was drenched in mayo to the point I didn't taste much of anything but mayo. It literally dripped from the sandwich to the plate when I picked it up. Not good. The bacon was over-cooked and chewy and reminded me of the rubber fries. I didn't quite finish my sandwich either, and thought that I could get a better tasting sandwich, cheaper, somewhere else.    The service was decent and the staff was nice and friendly. I'm pretty big on customer service so if wait staff isn't friendly or attentive, I don't go back. I'm am thrilled my wife liked the GF pizza so it gives us an alternative to other places when we are in the area. I'll probably give it another try at some point I'm sure because my wife liked her pizza but I'll try something else. Hopefully they can keep up the good GF pizza and redeem themselves on simple sandwiches."
Scott N.,"Euless, TX",3,67,1,4.0,12/14/2013,"Good beers!  Nice place to catch a game, like the new brewhouse burgers.  Pizzas are always good too"
Tia B.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,8,,4.0,3/31/2015,"Good service and good food. I had the deep dish lasagna and my companions and I had the tray of three mini-cookies for dessert - they were fantastic! Minus one star, though, because my friend's fish was way too peppery, to the point where she couldn't eat it. Warning - plan on leftovers, as they give you enough for a couple of meals."
Judith J.,"Orange, CA",0,3,1,1.0,2/1/2015,"We came to watch super bowl, at BJ's north 820 loop, they keep the music on the back ground loud while game was keep to a minimum volume!  Not cool!  We will never watch any major sporting event here!  Second try the worst experience!!!!! Food good, drinks good, but changes waiters 3 times!!  Super Bowl!!   Are you kidding me!!"
Ryan L.,"North Richland Hills, TX",327,171,27,5.0,10/12/2012,"I eat here probably twice a week. Whether its lunch, dinner, or just drinks before a movie, I am always satisfied. The bartenders are great conversation if you sit at the bar. The handcrafted beers are awesome if you are a beer fan. They have a massive selection of liquor, include somewhat hard to find liqueurs. The California club flatbread pizza and the Hawaiian Maui Maui are my two favorite dishes. It's a large restaurant that can get busy, so don't be surprised if you have to wait longer than if you were at whataburger. I've seen a few complaints about waiting too long.  Go make it yourself if you think your well done steak is taking too long."
Shannon G.,"Dallas, TX",87,413,9,4.0,11/15/2010,"You know, for a chain, BJ's is alright.  It's alot like Houlihan's in terms of ""Chains I'm Okay WIth"" -it's like they try a little harder than Chili's and the like.  And with BJ's, you get the beer which is good. I'm not beer snob, but I've liked what I've had.  Also, although I don't think I've ever had it, the Nutty Brewnette makes me laugh every time because, hey, I'M a nutty brunette! I had the pumpkin beer this time and it was really yummy, spicy without being so pumpkiny that it would taste weird with food. The avocado egg rolls are just delicious mostly because that's all that's in there -avocado.  And with the sweet dipping sauce, it's just really good and a little different.  Also, I saw they have poke on the menu as an appetizer which I found surprising, see, they try to be different (did not eat it, so someone else will have to take that chance and report back.)   The food is fine, nothing too amazing but there are lots of choices.  I had a really tasty BBQ ranch salad once and this time my beer battered fish and chips were yummy.  My BF had the most disgusting thing I could ever imagine -it was bacon cheeseburger pizza with pickles on it.  Pickles on a pizza! So gross sounding but he loved it, so if you're into that kind of thing, it's apparently awesome.  I've seen many cheeseburger pizzas and they all seemed weird but harmless, this took it next level (depending on your tastes, next level gross or next level awesome.)  We had one of those big booths to ourselves which is a little awkward.  I pointed out that another couple was sitting all close together on one side of it instead of way across from each other like we were and the BF rolled his eyes in an exaggerated manner."
Jennifer H.,"Fort Worth, TX",41,176,14,2.0,11/19/2012,Great place but so $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$. The food is not very good but the drinks are great! Just stick to the pizza.
Mark K.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,26,3,2.0,10/10/2012,Service was ok but food was cold and dried out.   I had the salmon first but sent it back.  They then brought me a Cobb salad that had finely shredded wet lettuce.  Atmosphere is awesome if you are going for drinks.
Kinz M.,"Austin, TX",1075,339,122,2.0,5/25/2010,"Well, at first glance, it's a nice looking restaurant.  Good amount of parking, and great looking atmosphere. I went there with the family. First impression, the girl at the hostess desk greeted us and told us to stand off to the side. That's fine, except for the fact that she looked at us like we were scum, and had a really nasty attitude. The food was... meh.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't amazing.  Our waiter asked us how we were, and I told him we were a bit insulted by the hostess. He never really spoke to us again.  All we needed was an apology for the way she acted, and it would've been fine!  No apology. Not even from the management. The beer selection looked pretty good [hence, it's a brewhouse], but we didn't drink since we had the whole family with us. SO, overall, I wouldn't say it's a bad experience. The atmosphere is good, big TV's, good sports bar... the staff at this particular location just plain sucks though."
Angie G.,"North Richland Hills, TX",15,25,,4.0,8/19/2012,"This location is hit or miss with the service. We've had excellent service but also really bad service. I even had a server complain about me to another server, right in front of me! (Even if she thought my request was ridiculous, you complain about your customers in the kitchen or out of view/earshot. That really sucked.) ..anyhoo the food and beer are great. Always. Best kids menu of any restaurant we frequent. Best beer selection in the Mid-Cities. (not that there really is any competition in that area) and food is always fresh, they have lots of variety and lots of healthy food. You can never go wrong with BJ's. They have something for everyone and it's quality food/beer. (for a chain)"
Jennifer S.,"Hurst, TX",11,10,1,1.0,1/24/2012,Not somewhere I will go back.  Food is flavorless and they are not amble to accommidate those with dietery issues.
Todd W.,"Dallas, TX",222,233,238,2.0,12/7/2011,"terrible service. first 2 things we ordered at 845p on a weeknight--gone. thing we ordered: gone martini was good. again, service--the poor kid--not his thing."
Tony H.,"Austin, TX",81,269,53,5.0,2/26/2012,"Love the food.  I have always been recommended to BJs but finally made it on a business trip.  Absolutely loved what I had to eat and the place itself looked really, really nice and classy."
Jeff D.,"Richland Hills, TX",1,27,7,4.0,7/21/2011,"Their pizzas are tasty and their potstickers are amazing. The best part of the meal has to be the monster ""pazookies"" for desert!!!  They are a warm cookie that is gooey and right out of the oven with a scoop of ice cream."
Jerry J.,"Bedford, TX",0,2,,1.0,9/15/2012,"Nice place, but the food is over rated. Finally tried the pizza, not impressed, it was at best average. Looked great, crust was not good, and that is what makes a great pizza. I do not understand the hype on the place.  The wait staff is well trained to milk you."
Sherree B.,"San Antonio, TX",3,58,,2.0,11/13/2013,"Every time we have eaten here or any other BJs for that matter, the service was slow, slow, slow!  While I like their food and atmosphere, the service is ridiculous.  Step up the training and expectations BJs!"
Tim H.,"Garland, TX",4,10,,3.0,9/30/2011,"Great place -- big selection of drinks and large selection of drafts. Good food, a little pricey, service was so-so, depends on where you sit."
