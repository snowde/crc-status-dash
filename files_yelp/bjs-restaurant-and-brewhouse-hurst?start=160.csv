Shawn B.,"Fort Worth, TX",8,44,,1.0,10/28/2010,"We had Marcus and we were not pleased. He seemed to be off in another world. I had to tell him what I wanted several times because he wasn't paying attention. Our drinks got low several times and it took him a while to refill. The food is not even close to 2nd rate, it is awful. It was like stale and OLDDDDDDDD.  He asked us if we wanted dessert and we said yes. I turn to ask my wife so I could order for her, I turn back around and he is nowhere to be found. He doesn't come back to our table for another at least 5 min. Marcus wasn't having a bad day he is just rude and didn't care. Being a server you make most of your wages through tips... If you treat the guests badly your only going home with a couple dollars from your hourly wage. I tried to get another server to help us out and no one seemed to care. There was half a dozen employees crowded over by a computer doing nothing. I will never again be visited BJ's. Besides who would want to eat at a place named BJ anyway? On a side note this is a loud restaurant both times we got people sitting down the aisle from us and we heard their entire conversation. Ehhh"
James N.,"Hurst, TX",0,5,,4.0,9/21/2011,"After my friend insisted I try this place I did. She put particular emphasis on their dessert called a ""Pizookie"" a giant cookie topped with ice cream. I had lunch here on a Friday afternoon and was impressed. Loved the decor and atmosphere. The wait staff were friendly and attentive and the margarita I ordered was excellent. I had the margaita pizza and a salad, also very good. The Pizookie proved to live up to the hype. I had half chocolate chunk and half ghiradeli chocolate. Amazing! Didn't expect such good food and service from a chain."
James L.,"Hurst, TX",49,96,1,4.0,11/26/2010,"I really like BJ's......the restaurant. This place is right across the street from where I live and I would go more often if my wife was up for it.   I do remember when they first opened, all the hostesses would be like ""Welcome to BJ's"" with enthusiasm!!!  Now...it's like ""...welcome to bj's how many?"" with little to no enthusiasm.   They have a very good beer selection that you don't find at many places.  They also brew their own beers.  I recommend the Nutty Brewnette and the Hefenwiezen.  Their own handcrafted Root Beer (I hope Handcrafted doesn't mean they actually use their hands in the mix), is awesome as well. You have to try their Avocado Egg Rolls for an appetizer.  I've had friends try it how aren't huge fans of Avocado and thank me later! As far as entrees go, my wife is a big fan of the Pulled Pork Sandwich.  I stick with their Pizza's.  Their Pizza's are thick and hearty.  Their white pizza is good and so is their Southwestern Pizza.  Their Cheeseburger Pizza is pretty stout as well!  I did one time stray and got a California Burger.  It was pretty much disgusting. The Pazookie desserts are pretty awesome as well. The service here is spotty at best though.  We've had plenty of the normal chain restaurant service but we have had one server that we now ask for religiously when we visit so we don't get stuck with someone who would rather be doing something else.  Hell, I'll recommend her....the servers name is Jessica G.  Ask for her and she will give you great service.   I did have one experience one time where me and 3 other co-workers went there for lunch.  We all love the root beer.  The place was packed.  We asked for a pitcher of root beer.  The waitress stated ""Nah...I'll just refill them as you drink them.""  We then nicely told her....""You don't understand.  You are busy waiting on 6 tables during a lunch rush.  Your glasses are small, we will need refills every 3-5 minutes.  Please provide us with a pitcher.""  She goes....""I'll have to ask my manager.""  15 minutes later and 4 empty root beer glasses later, she brings out this pitcher of root beer and talks about how she had to talk her manager into it.   Man....if charging us for a pitcher of root beer which in turns runs the bill higher which in turn earns her more of a tip....is doing us a favor....then she has her priorities backwards.  We don't ask for her when we go there.  In fact, we tell the hostesses, we don't want her section (if of course our normal server we request is off that day). They do offer call ahead seating so I would take advantage of that as they do get pretty busy.  I did mention the gate keepers earlier (the hostesses) so if you don't do call ahead seating....you get to hang out near the hostess stand and you will literally feel the life and energy getting sucked right out of you. One of my favorite places to go though overall!"
Ashlee E.,"Dallas, TX",11,23,,4.0,3/21/2010,"So since I live like 5 minutes away from here it automatically makes me happy and secondly the ice cold beer and amazing pizza makes me happy as well. Good staff here too! Although they are always busy, they really try to make your wait as best as they can (or atleast they did for me)! All in all -- good food, good place, and good beer! Enough said."
Matt T.,"Dallas, TX",154,446,329,4.0,9/3/2010,"BJ's reminds me of a Cheesecake Factory.  Giant menu and probably average to above average food.  Never been blown away by their food, but also not been dissappointed.  I tried their grilled chicken pasta and started with their small caeser salad both of which were fine.  Our waiter was a highlight and was very nice and personable."
Judi C.,"Bedford, TX",1,48,,3.0,6/3/2013,"Service is average; not stellar, but not bad.  The atmosphere is actually really nice; pretty bar.  It's rather loud in there, but I can still hear classic/current rock music playing in the background.  I LOVE the Nutty Brewnette they brew there!  I have tried several things on the menu; both the fish tacos and the fish and chips disappoint, but their pan pizza is GREAT.  I'm usually more of a fan of thin crust pizza, but this crust has a really good garlicky taste.  All their toppingsare really good and some are gourmet (like feta, kalamata olives, artichokes, etc.)  Good brewed beer, good pizza, hellacious to get to with all the construction these days, so only go if I'm already making a trip to the mall."
Ross T.,"Dallas, TX",53,9,5,2.0,9/19/2010,Feels like a blend of Cheescake Factory and Humperdink's. Didn't try the beer but the food was alright if a bit rich. Seems like a good alternative to olive garden/chili's for those stuck in the mid-cities.
Zach P.,"Hurst, TX",0,3,,4.0,2/8/2011,Not the best burgers good salads and great home brewed root beer. waiters are nice and they have a pizzuice a cookie cooked in a pizza pan i haven't tried one but there supposed to be good please tell me if they aren't cuz Ive never tried one.
Woody S.,"North Richland Hills, TX",0,12,,2.0,8/7/2011,The time you have to wait to get seated and then actually have someone to come by and take your order can be extremely long. It takes a long time for the food to arrive and you my as well forget getting your drinks refilled. The food was average and the prices seem high for the food served.
M L.,"Arlington, TX",0,11,,5.0,7/30/2012,Awesome margaritas! Great food every time! Good service.
Carolyn M.,"Hurst, TX",84,9,,3.0,3/10/2012,Love the food but a bit pricey. Unless you go during happy hour. They have good specials then. Staff is always friendly and quick service.
