Casey S.,"Bedford, TX",643,195,311,4.0,6/16/2016,"The most important thing you need to know about BJ's is PAZOOKIES.  You can get three, mini (and honestly they're not that mini at all!) delicious pazookies of your choosing (chocolate chip, cinnamon monkey bread, salted caramel, white chocolate macdamea nut and G. free chocolate chip) all freshly baked and topped with vanilla bean ice cream for ten bucks. THEY'RE HEAVEN! BJ's has several made in house brew's, included ciders and gluten free options and well as typical bottled and draft brews, cocktails and beverages. I went with one of the BJ's brew's options that our server recommended based off of my beer preferences that i'd described. It quenched my beer thirst, but I was a little disappointed because it was a little bit on the warm side. The menu is full of traditional ""new-american"" type foods, with some many options, I never really know where to start reading.  We walked in late, pretty close to closing, but the hostess and waiter were both very friendly, happy to see us and waited on us efficiently! It's was a great late night stop!  ...but mostly because of pazookies!"
Kourt T.,"Bedford, TX",7,72,10,5.0,10/15/2016,The food the drinks and the service were all great. Our server Lance was very attentive and kept our drinks full. I love that they have veggie burger patties!! Got the jalapeño burger with a veggie patty and it was so good!! Will for sure be back!
Jesse G.,"Roanoke, TX",16,20,5,5.0,12/28/2016,"I visit BJs on a fairly regular basis, and rarely do I have such a pleasant experience as I did tonight.  I brought the family, all 7 of us out for dinner.  We were seated quickly, and waited on quickly. Our waitress, Haley, was probably one of best waitresses I have ever had.  She was super friendly, great with the kids and was always thinking one step ahead.  My family is not always the easiest with their weird likes and demands! Haley was right on top of it.   The food was good as always, but what really separates this visit from the rest was the service.  So if you are stopping by this BJ's be sure to ask for Haley, you will not be disappointed!"
Nicole S.,"Mansfield, TX",0,28,13,2.0,6/12/2016,"Not a fan of this particular location. We went there last weekend, had a table of four. We consistently had to ask for our drinks to be refilled. The food was good, it came out in a timely manner. I ordered the salmon with a cherry chipotle glaze, over a bed of cous cous, with asparagus. It was delicious, the glaze really makes the dish. I was getting really irritated because they started setting up a large party behind us. Every time they kept rearranging chairs they kept knocking mine with another chair. This happened more than three times, if you know it won't fit, don't keep trying. When we were done but just chatting to let our food settle, the large party started trickling in. Again, from the beginning they knew we wouldn't fit. One of the female employees suggested we go to another table or to pay if we were done. That's just rude."
Mike W.,"Kissimmee, FL",0,5,4,3.0,2/26/2017,"Food service was okay.  Was not properly charged the correct amount on a couple of items but the waitress apologized and made it right.    The food, steak, soup, chicken tenders were are all cold.   That wasn't made right nor even asked how everything was.   Advised the waitress but nothing but a slight apology.    Would maybe go there for a drink but not for the food."
June T.,"Keller, TX",15,55,62,3.0,12/27/2015,"My fiancé and I have date night here about once a month and the only reason we come back is for the food. My favorites are the calamari and ahi tuna appetizer, Parmesan crusted chicken, and pizookies.  The service is hit or miss. When we first started coming about a year ago we always got good service. However, recently it's gotten worse. I've been a server before so I understand the frustration and I'm usually a pretty patient person. One time It took over 15 minutes before we got noticed by anyone. I had get up and ask the hostess if she could send service our way. Then when I ask for extra sauce or lemons it takes another 5-10 minutes to come out. Another time I called to order to go and the guy on the phone was in such a rush to get me off the phone I couldn't even finish my order. So all in all the food is good and the service is iffy."
TheBaby D.,"Tampa, FL",0,53,23,1.0,7/15/2017,Whelp this is the first time I have ever eaten in this restaurant. My experience was NOT GOOD. I want to know who is in the kitchen preparing the food. I ordered a simple dish without any kind of special requests. I was with a party of 11 people which can be a little overwhelming to some staff and I get that. I ordered a clam chowder sourdough bowl which was good. My main dish was the chicken fried steak with all the fixins on it. The first order was incorrect I received the wrong chicken steak so the second trip was also incorrect and it actually belonged to another person in our party who they never acknowledged which meant he had to wait longer for his meal. They offered to attempt a third time that's when I declined. GET IT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME!! how about that. The damn place wasn't even crowded yet. They say first impressions are everlasting. Several people in our group had messed up orders not just me. NO GOOD
Robert V.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",37,65,28,4.0,10/31/2016,"Another one of our favorite haunts. I am almost a regular here. The food is decent, staff is friendly, service is quick. We like this place because it's a fun atmosphere with diverse food and beer menus. Great place to watch a game. I gave this place 4 stars because it lacks the ""wow"" factor that I look for in a great restaurant, but it is still very good and I will continue to come here."
Daniel C.,"Arlington, TX",0,2,,5.0,7/31/2017,"I was there this weekend for a couple hours at the bar.  Zachary, our bartender was great.  Very knowledge and honest about the beer selection.  Helped me pick several beers off their extensive craft selection."
Jessica T.,"Dallas, TX",164,24,19,3.0,7/14/2017,"So I went here on a pretty empty stomach and I will say my plate was very clean at the end. I ordered the Southern Fried Chicken under the lunch only items (but you can get it anytime). The dish comes with some seasoned corn, mashed potatoes and a boneless chicken breast on top of the potatoes with some gravy. Honestly, I get this dish like every time I go to BJs and you will chew it down in no time. The chicken is tender and eating that with some potatoes will definitely hit the spot. I went with a party of about 14 people and half of us got this dish. It was not the BEST southern fried chicken I had from BJs but it was good enough for me to make the plate clean at the end. So if you are looking for something filling and inexpensive, I would suggest getting the Southern Fried Chicken! Other than the food, we got seated within 10 minutes and got our food in a reasonable amount of time. We did go on a Saturday night so it was a little full but not extremely crowded. Location is in a great spot. I would recommend this place anytime!"
Dawn D.,"Hurst, TX",27,6,,3.0,6/29/2016,"Beer was good. Had the bourbon barrel stout and the hefeweizen. The ginger ipa had a good start but finished bitter. I ordered a rare steak and it came out barely pink so I sent it back and was told the cooks wouldn't get it right? So I was left with no entree but was allowed to keep my asparagus which was seasoned well but still had some woody stalks to it. Apps were good, brussel sprouts and artichoke hearts.  Ordered the beignet for dessert and it was tough, not flaky.  Our server (never gave us his name) was nice and accommodating. He gave us a coupon for one free app.  So sixty bucks, 4 beers later and no entree...My conclusion is we probably won't go back."
Chris M.,"Euless, TX",7,23,27,4.0,4/16/2015,"Consistently good. Love to drop by here once a week (big splurge) on my way home from work for happy hour. Catch a Mavs game, great apps and beers.  Service at the bar is always spectacular. Jason is the dude!!"
Raymond D.,"Southlake, TX",0,10,1,1.0,5/7/2017,The service was so so I ordered a steak baked potato and salad and the dressing was real watery A big mistake The steak was kind of OK a little overcooked when I told him I wanted a medium the big potato was hard send it back they brought another one it was a bad potato it had some kind of crap inside of it so they had to bring me another baked potato that makes baked potato number three and it was still kind a heart wasn't cooked all the way when the ticket came they charge full price and I told him that shouldn't be that way I don't recommend going here
Steve W.,"North Richland Hills, TX",0,83,1,4.0,4/30/2017,"Good until we ordered Dessert. Server, Ariel, was very nice and prompt, and our food was very good, but everything changed when we ordered dessert. It took FOREVER to come out and finally I told Ariel that the wait time for dessert was ridiculous. Nothing was done in the way of any goodwill gesture to make up for it. I wouldn't make such a big deal over it had it not took soooooooooooooooooo very long when everything else had been great! This needs to change."
Calvin S.,"Euless, TX",0,4,4,5.0,6/12/2016,Great place for late night meal. Great beer and drinks and food. Stephen was a great waiter.
Autumn G.,"Fort Worth, TX",1,19,28,4.0,3/30/2016,"We are regulars here. Always good food, friendly service and good drinks. There has been only one time we came in just for drinks and the bartender working had little to no experience and our drinks were not good. This time, we actually came in for dinner on Easter and the service was good, it wasn't busy and we got our food and drinks in a reasonable amount of time. We tried some of their handcrafted beer and depending on your taste, you may want to sample some before ordering one. Will return as soon as I receive another $10 off $35 ;)"
Jenna N.,"Arlington, TX",285,167,1091,4.0,11/17/2014,"It was my second time here and I ordered the chicken fried steak. I also got a clam chowder soup. It was really good, really creamy too. The CFS was very chewy.. And hard to cut.. I thought it was okay. But the white cheese mashed potatoes was amazing! My friend got the baked lasagna and that was good but a little too sweet. We ordered pazookies and the smores peanut butter one was great but just too sweet I didn't finish it all"
Jennifer H.,"Keller, TX",62,165,153,4.0,1/26/2015,4Stars -Watermelon and feta cheese salad  was very fresh watermelon was nice and sweet. 4 stars - bruschetta small bite - must pour the dressing on top of the bruschetta . Absolutely delicious. 4 stars- New England clam chowder . I'm a native New Englander and I known clam chowder. For Texas this is as good as it gets. Highly recommend especially in the bread bowl.  My only minus point was all my food came at once. This is the biggest and most consistent problem I have had at BJs. They seem incapable of being able to properly time food. But I still will give them 4 stars because of the quality of food and the double berry drink.
Shannon G.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,4,1,1.0,9/30/2016,Never have I experienced such an unpleasant meal in my life which is a shame as I love BJs and have been coming here for years. It just takes one rude wait staff and an unsympathetic manager to make one never want to go there again.
BJ E.,"Euless, TX",3,21,,2.0,12/25/2015,"Christmas Eve:  Two people in our party had the Jambalaya, having lived in New Orleans, I know Jambalaya and this was just a jumbled mess.   For some odd reason they decided to sprinkle a ton dry seasoning on it before serving which made it very gritty and it was already very dry.   Between the chicken, sausage and shrimp the only way I could tell what I was eating was by its texture as the spice was so overdone the individual favors of the meat remains a mystery.    Three others in the party had chicken dishes and yes we know that chicken is frozen before cooked in most restaurants, but you should never be able to tell that it was frozen by the rubbery texture caused from an improper thawing technique.    Probably not a place we would revisit or recommend."
