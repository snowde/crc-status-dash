Candice W.,"Fort Worth, TX",6,11,14,4.0,4/24/2015,"Ok so this girl wanted to eat somewhere new cause I was tired of the same old food. We decided on BJ's because we had never been here. Truth? It definitely did not disappoint.  I ordered the Mediterranean Tacos and a House Salad and it was AMAZING!!! I will definitely be back for more. I almost wanted to order another plate, but didn't want to look like a pig.  Wait staff was attentive and super friendly. Atmosphere is a casual but classy place. I definitely recommend you all making a trip to BJ's."
Marcie B.,"Garland, TX",8,311,294,4.0,12/18/2015,"I was actually very impressed with their seafood options. Very flavorful and sizable portions. The fish was a tad overcooked but I thought the flavor was great. There a lot of selections of craft beers, however, they're served just a tad cooler than room temperature. If you can cool your keg any more than it is, at least chill the glasses."
Cristal Y.,"San Antonio, TX",124,126,408,3.0,10/9/2013,"I met up with one of my girlfriends here for dinner one night and I was pleasantly surprised to see that there was no wait! It was a Tuesday at 6:30pm, so I expected to see a bit of a crowd, but luckily we beat it instead.  We both had hamburgers, which were veryyyy good! I had the avocado jalapeno burger which was great! I expected it to be a bit more spicy, and with more dressing, but it wasn't bad! Our waiter let me sample the pumpkin ale that just came out and it is SOOOO good!!! I would come just for that!  Everything was great until we were walking out the door and my friend gracefully slipped on the floor. It literally looked like she was doing the splits in the middle of the restaurant and then I realized that she had fallen! She slipped on a water puddle with small pieces of food in it. I don't understand why someone wouldn't have been picked up/wiped up, but unfortunately it was there. And my friend who JUST recovered from a sprained ankle just slipped on that puddle. :(  If it wasn't for that, then I would have given the place 4 stars!"
James F.,"Hurst, TX",52,6,,5.0,7/30/2016,"Been here a couple times.  The food is great, and the drinks as well.  The service is good and fast."
Charity B.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,3,,2.0,3/23/2016,"This place used to be so great! The past 5 times have been dreadful though. Our food has been served cold, wrong, burnt, or just plain awful. I'll give management credit though for always trying to right the situation but it shouldnt happen every time we go there. Also, service has gone downhill...20 minutes just to be greeted after being seated?! Not once...but twice! The avocado egg rolls are usually amazing but my order last Sunday were brown! Have you ever had brown avocado? It's disgusting. I didn't complain because my mother in law had already complained about her food and I didn't want to overwhelm our flustered waitress. I miss the old BJ's."
Holly N.,"The Colony, TX",458,93,19,4.0,7/23/2014,"BJ's is a family favorite because it's close, it has huge portions and they usually have good service. Only issues I've ever had is with large parties - somehow we always end up with the one waiter who has no idea what they're doing. Food is fantastic. They used to have this big open faced pot roast sandwich, but they have since done away with it. Now, I either get the parmesan crusted chicken (enough to share!) or the soup and salad combo. My dad and boyfriend's father are big supporters of their beer. If you like hand crafted, this place is perfect. They also have GREAT hand crafted sodas. I always get a 1/2 cream soda, 1/2 root beer. YUM. If you go on your birthday, you get a free mini pizookie (gooey cookie goodness). Also, if you're a frequenter, I highly recommend joining the rewards club. It's free, and super easy to rack up points for free food and $$ off your meals."
Justin B.,"Broken Arrow, OK",645,277,113,5.0,2/25/2014,"I'd somehow managed to never heard of BJ's Brewhouse until a visit to the DFW area over the summer.  After doing just a bit more of opening my eyes, I see they are in many different cities.  Still, this location at Northeast Mall in Richland Hills (or Hurst?) is the only one I've ever been to. This place is quite the treat in many ways.  I've been five times and had a different server on each visit.  Every time the server was professional but also had good humor and really seem to want everyone to have a good and quality experience.  They're quick with recommendations and offer some insight into what might be best paired with a particular beer- more than I'd usually anticipate a server being able to do accurately.  They've even been quick and witty with responses to questions and comments made by the more mischievous diners in my group. If you've never been to a BJ's, then you might not know that the menu is overwhelming and full of options.  Without having counted, there are easily around 100 dishes to pick from.  So far, I've tried burgers, fish and chips, Cajun pasta, and a few different chicken dishes.  They offer sandwiches and pizzas, but I've yet to be in the mood to order that or a steak.  The burgers were good- probably not what I'd normally order with so many other things that are so delightful on the menu.  The Cajun pasta was seasoned nearly perfectly and had the right amount of spice.  The fish and chips seem to be popular and for good reason!  These are possibly the most delicious example of fried fish I've managed to have outside of the UK.  But the absolute best dish I've had at BJ's Brewhouse is the Balsamic Chicken.  Sounds like something that wouldn't be as amazing as it is, but this dish has consistently blown me away.  The chicken is lean and tender, served on a bed of fresh greens with the most incredible balsamic glaze on top.  This also comes with well-cooked onion straws, which work very well with the flavors.  White cheddar mashed potatoes finish off this delight and are the best mashed potatoes I've had (a side I usually don't even like). Of course, the biggest draw of this establishment is the beer.  BJ's Brewhouse has the most amazing beers.  I've tried about half by now and they've all been prime examples of perfection in brewing.  My personal favorite is the Hefeweizen, which is on the lighter side.  It has a very light taste that can take on different flavors, from refreshing and crisp to full and almost buttery.  Another that I've tried which is a great example of a dark beer is the PM Porter, which offers a flavors like chocolate in a beer.  The Irish Red is also very good, but I can't imagine picking it over the above two.  The great thing is that if you aren't sure which one you will like, you can get a sample glass, which is more that enough to help you make up your mind. For an experience with all the ambiance you'd expect from an upscale brewery, this BJ's Brewhouse location is a difficult experience to beat."
Marc R.,"Hurst, TX",0,3,,1.0,6/29/2016,The Rangers now have the best record in baseball. I said OK I will try them again. I went up to the place and to my surprise the game wasn't even on. Soccer was on the main screen (you know Texas favorite sport) apparently they just don't care about the local team.
Rayna F.,"Mililani, HI",0,3,,4.0,12/22/2016,I got the deep dish cheese pizza with jalapeños and black olives as I always do. And I got the stuffed mushrooms. I love BJ's! It's one of my favorite restaurants and they have a lot of great food!
Jolene B.,"Mansfield, TX",113,150,161,1.0,3/2/2015,"I used to be a dire fan of BJ's. Every time I went I got the same thing and it was my favorite meal. Potstickers for app, a french dip for my meal and a strawberry mixed drink from their cocktail menu.  I've been to this location a few times and had a great experience with a bar manager once. Another time, I left and realized my waiter hadn't returned my debit card. Called them, I had to harass them to get any answers because I knew I hadn't just left it on the table but that the waiter had actually not returned it. Finally, a manger admitted to me that the waiter had taken my card home and wouldn't bring it back! What the heck?! So I cancelled it and ordered a new one.  The last time I went there I ordered my usual. The same thing I get EVERY time. But, guess what? Instead of my french dip being served with au jus (you know- like all French dips are) they served it with this gross balsamic, oil dip. Ew! I was so grossed out and disappointed. I complained to the waitress thinking they had given me the wrong thing only to be told that's what they serve it with now? Really? That's interesting because that's not a French dip. There were some things wrong with the orders of other people at the table but you know it gets to the point that there is no point complaining any more.  Sad. I loved this place so much and now it's been 6 months since I've gone back.  If you decide to go- get the pizza. It's good and I never had a bad experience (except that it's pricey)"
Teresa D.,"Fort Worth, TX",131,6,,2.0,6/18/2016,"Not a fan of this location, but I thought I would give it another try because it was the only thing open around the area. Our appetizers came out cold, and when confronted, they said they would get us a fresh plate that never came out. When our food came out, we ordered a sirloin medium-well, and it came out extra well. The jumbo spaghetti and meatballs was not to out liking, the meatballs tasted as if it wasn't marinated right or cook all the way. The chicken parmesan was the only decent thing we ordered. We then ordered a chocolate chip pizookie that came out halfway cooked. Will not return to this location, I will drive the extra mile to a different location."
Christine C.,"Arlington, TX",383,541,123,3.0,3/21/2014,"This place can get STUPID busy on weekends. I generally try to stay away from the whole mall area when dining out with friends, and so should you. It's the only place, however, that I've been to where they served out mini pizza slices to all of us that were waiting. I don't think it's the norm, but worth applauding. The hostesses are also not that great at approximating wait times. We had to wait 40 mins longer than they told us we had to. By that time, Bun-Bun and PK had finished their naps and were wide awake for the meal, and upset as bedtime approached sooner than we had anticipated. Registered our CCs so we can GTFO faster and pay automatically. instructions on the table."
Anna C.,"North Richland Hills, TX",37,11,2,5.0,12/4/2016,This BJS is a great place. Servers are very good. As Asa member  they treat me outstanding!  Pazookies are delicious!
Jacqueline P.,"Hurst, TX",63,31,68,5.0,3/27/2014,"I normally don't give 5 Stars but I have to for this BJ's. This my local restaurant, no it's not a hole in the wall. It's a chain and a damn good one. This place gets it right every time I got at least once a week sometimes even 2-3 times. I meet friends there etc. Never had a bad meal every time clean plates, their food is to their perfect every time. Their burgers to salmon doesn't matter. The ambiance is always fun and relaxed. It's the luxury of brewhouses. Now their beers are fab if you can't decide ask them for a taste and ask for seasonal ones as well... Their Grand Cru & October Fest  superb..  Their pizzas are awesome can't say enough about this place. The staff my favorite is MARCUS ... He's awesome ...one of my favorite from everywhere ..."
Debby H.,"Fort Worth, TX",3,45,9,4.0,4/22/2016,"Really great atmosphere and food. I esp love the French dip, the salads and the lemon blueberry pizookie is delish! The menu has a lot to offer and it takes a little time and a coin toss to make a choice."
Troy A.,"Keller, TX",1,23,,2.0,4/14/2016,"Only reason for two stars is due to the food being pretty good. Service was really bad as it took 35 minutes to get the food for the 4 of us. We purposefully got there early to avoid this type of situation. After about 15 minutes our server avoided even making eye contact with us as well as avoiding our empty drink glasses. He then proceeded to be surprised that our food had taken so long.  As the head of local company with frequent lunch guests, be assured that BJ's will not be on my list of options."
Kimberly A.,"Fort Worth, TX",2,6,2,3.0,3/20/2016,"Very average. The menu seems really diverse and has something for everyone. I had the calimari appetizer (tasteless and soggy ) and the barbacoa chicken.  Again tasteless, and overpriced. Not very impressed."
Re M.,"Arlington, TX",355,71,410,3.0,1/7/2015,"The bartenders, Antonio and Mark are very sweet.  I had a bloody mary, which is NOT the business.  Something is off with the mix.  I also had a California burger with a turkey patty.  It didn't seem too hot, but the shoestring fries were really fresh.  Best parts of my meal...olives from my drink, water and clam chowder.  I'll stick to pizza."
Scott H.,"Nolanville, TX",0,1,,5.0,4/22/2016,"Best hostess ever!  A humble girl, but confident and dang friendly.  She may not be the general manager, but she can sure hostess better than any restaurant I've been to in a long while, that's for sure. And BJs is awesome!"
Brieann G.,"Cary, NC",4,4,,3.0,4/21/2016,"I really wanted to put two stars but since I loved the food so much, I decided on three stars. The service is just so so slow and they had every kind of spaghetti, except spaghetti with meat sauce. My family can be a little picky when it comes to food and for some reason they decided to get rid of this dish but keep the other two spaghetti options. We were very disappointed to learn about that and puzzled by their elimination of such a basic and easily prepped dish. Overall though, we love their food and dessert there but expect to be there for at least an hour no matter how busy they seem or how fast you eat."
