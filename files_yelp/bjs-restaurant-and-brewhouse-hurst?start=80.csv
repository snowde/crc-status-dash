Jillian G.,"Fort Worth, TX",227,194,273,3.0,3/11/2015,"I am a fan of BJ's. The atmosphere is enjoyable and the food is usually pretty good... But best of all, they have a really good beer selection there!! Lots of local beers here too such as Rahr, Revolver, and Firemans. Service is pretty good and reliable. My favorite thing about this place though is the avocado egg rolls. They're supposed to be an appetizer but they give you a huge portion and they're soooo delicious, therefore, I usually get them as my meal:)  Bonus: They have curbside to-go delivery too. :) you can order and pay on your smart phone using the BJ's app and then call when you get there so they can run your food out to you while you wait in your car. :)"
Amy Z.,"Dallas, TX",8,101,73,1.0,11/9/2014,"Writing this review as I'm eating because the food is that terrible. We got the shrimp scampi, jambalaya, and chicken fettuccine alfredo. All horrible choices and really expensive. The scampi was very sour and watery, the jambalaya was drowned in unpleasant spices, and the fettuccine was so dry as if it was scooped from the bottom of a pan. Will not be coming here again. Service was ok and food came out slow."
Vesper L.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,5,,5.0,10/7/2016,"Came here on Saturday, 9/24/16, after being completely & openly ignored at Bar Louie just down the street.  Excellent service & their Root Beer glazed chicken wings are amazing!  Our waiter, Steve, was really nice & we will definitely be coming back!"
Michelle L.,"North Las Vegas, NV",57,65,36,4.0,2/12/2015,"Another day at BJS even though I splurged last week. It was open late so it was an only option because I did NOT want whataburger. We had the wings as appetizers. Teriyaki bone in wings. THEY WERE SO GOOD. I wish they sauce at wingstop I had the parmesan chicken. Wow.  For a $14 dish its really huge. Literally a half of a chicken. We had Justin as our server and he's a sweetheart. The asparagus he recommended instead of broccoli was really good. I tried the California club that my boyfriend had and I really liked it! The avacados were my favorite part. I enjoyed the beignet with ice cream. Even hough I was full... I wanted more. Its amazingly good. So did my boyfriend. I just wanted to straight lick the plate. The staff there are so welcoming, I love it. They're so chill to talk to and really sweet. The only problem is the wait, overall everything was perfect."
Scott B.,"Keller, TX",25,219,15,3.0,12/31/2014,"BJ's is a decent brew pub. They have such a huge variety of food. Maybe they should shrink their menu and focus on the things they excel at. Let me state that I've been here multiple times and I like the place. The Craft brews are good as well as their craft root beer. Pizza is their specialty and its one of the only deep dishes that I like. Great crust. Its their other entrees that are mediocre. Being that said, service is usually good, but seating areas are cramped unless you're in a booth. If you're in need of a good craft brew and the best deep dish around, then look no further."
Trina C.,"Weatherford, TX",41,66,4,2.0,10/23/2015,This place is WAY overpriced and the food is mediocre at best. I have had 4 different plates and all of them were honestly worst than some fast food I have had. Not going back
Matthew S.,"Bedford, TX",96,199,50,4.0,5/20/2013,"I went here last night, just on a whim really. I've been here more than a few times, actually. They have great specialty beers, I'm more of a fan of the Red and the Nutty Brewnette beers, but the whole selection is great. The atmosphere is all right, and on most nights you get some discounts due to happy hour. I would prefer the prices not be as expensive as they are, but they're okay as far as the food goes. The dessert, however, far too expensive. It's nine bucks for three scoops of ice cream and a square of chocolate. Every time I go, I have to make a decision whether I want only an appetizer, only an entree, or only a dessert, because you can't have two or all three options and have it below twenty bucks. Sadly.  However the fourth star comes from the servers, they always have been amazing and friendly, and always come to check on you. It is a very great place, and as said I've been here a few times in the past, and I would go again. Just not more than once or twice a month, due to the prices."
Amber S.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",50,51,12,1.0,2/6/2015,"This was the first time we had just dessert here. I am disappointed. They have a  few choices of a cookie pizza thing topped with ice cream which you can't go wrong with cookies and ice cream...so I thought.  It took over 20 minutes to bring the pizzookie trio, 3 small cookies and ice cream and whatever my hubby ordered. Dessert as well. Outta control! The food doesn't take that long!  I got triple chocolate, chocolate chunk and salted Carmel. All my favs! I could've made brownies that tasted like the triple chocolate that would've been better. It tasted like boxed brownies. The chocolate chunk...nothing special. And the salted Carmel...over salted chocolate chip cookie.  Won't be doing that again. And the food is okay. It's like any other chain...for Myself and being in Texas there's better choices."
Larr L.,"Arlington, TX",2,43,3,4.0,10/15/2013,"This is definitely a great place to eat.  Handcrafted beers that are made in or around Houston, and the handcrafted root-beer is wonderful.  The pizza's here are great, although I wish they offered more veggie toppings, but they are very good.  We love to order several appetizers and snack while we drink beer and watch the game. Family friendly, good food and good drinks.  My only down side is that it can be a little bit on the pricey side, but worth it."
Caye C.,"Oklahoma City, OK",6,40,24,1.0,7/25/2014,"This place deserves maybe a 1 and a half. But there's not a half option. We were seated very quickly on a Friday night which was great! Our waiter was prompt in the beginning and took our order. We ordered the spinach artichoke dip which was delicious and hot. Little did I know it was $10 for a cup of dip.  This place is ""known for"" their pizza, so I got the bjs favorite and a Caesar salad. 30 minutes later our food came out...one by one. It took maybe 10 minutes for everyone's (table of 5) food to be brought out.  My pizza looked great but was soggy and cold:( I never got my salad either. I had to constantly ask for water refill and then wait for him to actually refill it.  When we got the checks they were incorrect so then it took another 15 minutes for him to correct it after a manager sign off. My bill was $25 and some change for a small, soggy, cold pizza that dominos easily beat, and a cup of dip. Terrible. No more of this restaurant for me. So disappointed."
Lavenia W.,"Grapevine, TX",4,16,7,5.0,7/5/2016,Our waitress Priscilla H at the Fort Worth location by NE mall was amazing. I work in hospitality and her service blew my mind. She gets it which made our dining experience amazing.
Paige D.,"Fort Worth, TX",49,142,16,3.0,11/29/2014,"I can never complain whenever I go here. Service is always good and food is good, but not great. They're known for their pizzas. My fiancé loves their meat lovers pizza and the portion size is always ginormous, enough to share and take home. I really enjoy their calamari appetizer and their pasta dishes. The calamari are thick pieces of squid, lightly battered and fried, with a good dipping sauce. I've got to say, the best thing about this bj's or any other bj's is the ambiance and atmosphere. It's perfect for date night or a family/friends get together."
nora f.,"Euless, TX",12,22,1,4.0,6/28/2016,"We have been here a few times. Last visit was with our grown daughter. She is a foodie and very particular. We were all pretty hungry, and our food was good-overall. The service and hostesses were awesome, friendly, and attentive. Plenty of drink refills, and good cross service when our waiter was busy. My hubs LOVED the pizza he got LAST visit, but told me (later, cuz he was starving at the restaurant~~:-) that the pizza was nothing like the last one. The other one was in a pan, and this one just came on the plate. Kind of disappointing, but not awful. We eat out a lot, and are pretty picky about food quality and service (my daughter is in the industry), but we like it here, and that one pizza won't spoil our experience. WE will be back!"
Ryan H.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,47,4,3.0,1/17/2016,Decent food at a decent price.  But nothing special.  We may return if only for their beer selection.
Megan S.,"Bedford, TX",1,14,1,5.0,6/24/2016,"One of our favorites yet again does not disappoint. Though busy, we were seated on Friday evening within just a couple minutes. The usual delicious hot bread started us off. Salads were fresh and generous, with nice dark greens - not just iceberg. Our steaks were perfect, as was my delicious, huge baked sweet potato. It was the perfect cap for a date night with the hubby. Thanks, Logan's, we'll be back yet again."
Lynnette K.,"Youngwood, PA",4,182,,3.0,8/23/2015,"While traveling through Dallas on a business trip, I stopped at BJ's for lunch.  I ordered a turkey burger with a side salad.  The turkey burger was really great with dried cranberries on it.  I never would have thought to add dried cranberries but boy was it tasty.  The side salad lacked the actual dressing but I couldn't complain because the server was nowhere to be found.  That was the biggest problem at this place.  She was not at all attentive to me only to call me ""sweetie"" when bringing me the check.  Nice try but too late.  They really need to upgrade their serving staff.  An average experience."
Kendall S.,"Fort Worth, TX",3052,762,1332,3.0,7/17/2012,"I went to BJ's tonight, and while the beer selection is pretty awesome (they even have a few of their own brews and ciders), I wouldn't say the food is anything too special. It's all good though, satisfactory, and there's a HUGE selection to choose from. I'm always a little suspicious of menus like that (i.e. Cheesecake Factory), because how can ONE restaurant make great pasta, pizza, sandwiches, steak, seafood, salads, soups, chickens, desserts, etc.? I think it's just too much for one restaurant to handle every food genre ever with expertise. However, BJ's ambiance was cheery and cool, our hostess and waiter were all smiles, and I'd say my experience overall was - as that rating bar above says - ""A-OK.""  I'll go back and try something else, I think... there will forever be something else to try! And I'll definitely order another Berry Burst Cider. They need to bottle that stuff!"
Wayne W.,"Euless, TX",141,49,,2.0,5/2/2014,"I hadn't been to BJ's in more than a year and after my experience yesterday, I remember why.  The service was horrible and the food left a lot to be desired! Our server was very inattentive and incredibly slow.  She claimed she was slammed but I could not accept this excuse seeing as she only had 4 tables.   When the food FINALLY arrived, it was slightly warm (not hot) and seemed if it had been sitting for 5-10 minutes.  A couple arrived 15 minutes after I did and sadly, they received their appetizer and food at the same time I did.  Next time I want to drop $20.00 on lunch, it surely won't be at BJ's."
Meredith B.,"Fort Worth, TX",2,33,129,5.0,9/27/2014,"Finally had a server that was worth writing about! Steven T was attentive, but not constantly bothering us, and our drinks never went empty!! We now feel like we can give 5 stars, just hope we continue to have this level of service."
Briana T.,"Fort Worth, TX",114,1,2,2.0,12/6/2015,"Decent food. Great desert. Not so good service, waitress must've been new or uninterested in serving us."
