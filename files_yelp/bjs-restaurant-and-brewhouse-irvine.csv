Wendy C.,"Irvine, CA",46,12,1,5.0,1/6/2018,"We went to BJ's last night and it was awesome. We met the GM Al, who is working on the delivery issues that happen on occasion.  Dinner was great. Sriracha Brussel Sprouts, mini pizza and the new turkey club salad (big chunks of turkey, fresh and moist). We will try delivery again...when we don't feel Like going out. Dining in the bar is a nice evening to talk, relax and have fun."
Brian S.,"Irvine, CA",17,86,,1.0,1/7/2018,Wow. This experience was horrible. They injured me physically.  Tonight I was injured by a busboy so busy and rushed he had a full empty round service tray and this slammed me on my knee and caused severe pain. It was a horrible experience. I made my way to the Seats and asked for ice.  The manager came by and apologized.  The Meal was terrible and they did nothing.  I was shocked how bad it was and they really did not care or do anything other than giving me ice.  I would not recommend This restaurant to anyone.  They should not be dealing with the public.
Don H.,"New York, NY",56,130,36,3.0,1/5/2018,"I don't know...  Sometimes it's hit or miss with BJ's. The last couple of times we were here the pizzas were undercooked; they tasted better when we took them home and put them in the toaster oven, but that's not saying much. The beer samplers used to be a gem - 6 samplers was the # but  now it's reduced to 4 without changing the price. Not cool. The service is a bit chaotic. We'll have anywhere between 3-4 servers. In theory I guess that makes for efficiency but call me ol' fashioned, I like the one on one server so that the tip is well earned.  Lastly, and perhaps the underlying reason for a 3 star. There are numerous times (3x too many) where for whatever reason we could see the frustration on the staff- and I get it, everyone has their day, especially in food/hospitality. But this was between two co-workers... Not sure if it was matre D v busboy or whatever but that was very visible to the public patrons... Meaning it was in front of the hostess podium."
Todd G.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",7,195,8,5.0,12/28/2017,"Came back tonight and BJs is back to the great service that I have always known there. Even ventured away from the usual pizza order to try a couple of items that I have never tried here. ordered the hamburger with fries, it was tasty and especially liked the bun as it tasted super fresh.  also ordered the asian style ribs and the meat was cooked to perfection. I might order a different sauce next time as I prefer more the bbq style taste, but they were good.  Waiter was very attentive and never missed a beat."
Debi R.,"Irvine, CA",299,156,57,4.0,10/8/2017,"My favorite trio: Chocolate Chip, Oreo, Peanut Butter Pizookies. The #1 reason I come here. Service is always good whether you're seated I'm the bar area or the restaurant."
Jane K.,"Tustin, CA",368,189,35,4.0,1/3/2018,BJ's has ok food but its getting four stars because of its pizookie!!! A freshly baked cookie with a dollop of icecream on top. Life can't get any better. I also tried heir buffalo wings which were pretty good and the drinks there are good priced as well. Environment is nice to just chill and have a good time with your friends.
Anna K.,"Irvine, CA",191,92,158,3.0,11/21/2017,"Service was surprisingly awesome but the food was cold and sub-par.  This was the first time I'd been to this location of BJ's but I've been to different locations countless times so I have an expectation of what the food should taste like and needless to say I was quite disappointed by the food. We ordered a pizza, steak, salads, and sliders and EVERYTHING came out room-temperature or cold. The Fries tasted like they'd been made hours ago and just heated up. The pizza tasted old as well.  The only redeeming quality of this location of BJ's was that the servers were super friendly and nice. I'd definitely give this location another shot just on account of the good service... hopefully the kitchen was just having an off night... hopefully."
Organic D.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,14,30,5.0,1/2/2018,"We can't say enough about our visit to Bj's we had a group of 20 and the service and food were absolutely incredible! Beyond expectations. With such a wide range of options, everyone was happy. The Customer Service was on par. The food topped it all, I had the Mediterranean Pita Tacos and the quinoa it was amazing and refreshing both had so much flavor, I would eat it again. My husband had the Black and Bleu burger, he said it was among the best, the patty was thick and juicy with lots of flavor. The bun was soaked in flavor which added to every bite. Great quality, the Executive Chef David Vasquez came out to greet us and wow does he know how to run a 5 Star kitchen. Incredible taste, timing and variation. We recommend to anyone eating alone or with a party! Come eat some great food!"
Aaron E.,"Orange County, CA",94,1429,2127,2.0,10/14/2017,"Poor taste passed off as gourmet. It is a chain you have been to and you didn't care for it either. Sticky booths, screaming day drinking suburbanites, and fair weather football fans. All of that plus a terrible deep dish. I tried the Buffalo Chicken variety and you are 100% correct, I deserve what I got.  The pie is all dough and no go. Dry and wood-tasting chicken breast chunks are combined with diced celery, red onions with a sloppy drizzle of ranch dressing, buffalo sauce and... well, that is the good part! The bad part is the 3/4 inch of too soft, almost mealy, doughy crust these things have going on. If this is an attempt at Chi-Town pie, BJ needs to actually go to Chicago someday because this is a disgusting attempt at a deep dish.  Bleh.  This pizza stings like a first divorce, or that first Newport... Whichever hurts you more. The second star is for having Stone IPA on draft and Famous Dave's is conveniently located next door. Moonwalk past BJ's."
Gus L.,"Tustin, CA",214,79,55,3.0,10/31/2017,The location is nice and clean. The employees are super nice and attentive to their guests. The venue is very open yet intimate. I do enjoy the layout. I've always liked coming to this location because the bartenders are extremely nice. I highly encourage others to come visit this location.  The music isn't too loud which helps and allows you to keep a conversation. And they have tv sports going on at all times.  James and Lisa the bartenders are just great
Durell B.,"Irvine, CA",392,146,813,4.0,7/5/2017,"This is the other corporate chain spot that I can get down with because they are consistent across the board (which is what chains shoot for, I know) but they have a GOOD consistency; which doesn't always happen with chains. While I have been to other locations, I am happy to report that this one is the closet for me and probably the best.  The last time I was here was (7/2/17) with fellow Yelper Candice K and we had a good ole time.  We sat in the bar area left hand corner, which had a great view of multiple TVs. Candice wanted to check out the Angels game and it was on the big screen. The staff is very accommodating with the TVs (I assume as long as they have the channels and no other guests care too much). On this particular day our server was Bianca and she took great care of us. Initially we were catching up and talking for a while but that didn't stop her from checking in on us frequently which is much appreciated.  We finally were ready to order and we decided to go with: *App* Root Beer Glazed Wings --- I ordered them extra crispy and they came out very nice, crunchy but full of that sticky flavor glaze. Cooked thoroughly, so there are no complaints here. I would order again.  *Entrees* Full Rack Of Ribs --- Good glaze. Meaty and not too dry. I was kind of surprised because you never know if they will be too dry but I would order these again.  Rib Eye --- A very nice slab of meat. Cooked medium. Good flavor. Juicy *Sides* Green Beans --- Tender. Juicy. Not much to say. Overall good. Asparagus --- Seasoned well with the right amount of crunch.  *Drinks* House Blonde --- Cold and good tasting. *Dessert* Pizookie Trio --- Monkey Bread. White Chocolate. Peanut Butter. The PB was the definite hit out of the 3 for us with WC coming in second. MB was ok but may have been a little too sweet and not as soft, but it was ok.  I believe this is all we had and the experience was overall good. We were also able to take advantage of a BOGO entree which wasn't a bad deal at all. And our server was cool about it. I say that because I've been to places where you would present a coupon and sometimes the server would seem like they had an attitude with it or something. My thing is, if they weren't meant to be used then the company wouldn't have made them. And with that being said, make sure you tip appropriately; especially when you're getting a deal. A lot of servers work hard and coupons shouldn't cut into their bottom line.  All in all a good day and a good job from Bianca. I will be back. Cheers, Beautiful People!!!!"
Tara L.,"Seattle, WA",212,344,708,4.0,6/12/2017,"I've been going to this location since I was in high school, so almost 10 years now! Overall, I have always had excellent service and great food. I've tried everything from pastas, burgers, salads, and tons of their appetizers. The main food items I would recommend here are their: avocado egg rolls, deep dish pizzas, and of course, the pizookies.  On this particular trip, I went for a healthier option and was not disappointed. The meal itself was the perfect amount of food and tasty. I ordered their Peruvian Quinoa with Shrimp bowl. The shrimp tasted pretty fresh and the meal itself wasn't as bland as you might think for a healthy meal. I would get this dish again and I definitely intend on returning here."
Michelle S.,"Irvine, CA",6,6,12,4.0,12/23/2017,Foods always wonderful here. :)  The beer flights are enjoyable. Happy hour during the week.
Jessica N.,"Garden Grove, CA",94,310,852,4.0,6/10/2017,"Staff was great and super attentive. Parking was great too for a weekday lunch. BJs is known for their pizzas and pizookie desserts, so I totally recommend those, but not really anything else except their root beer. I got the unlimited soup and salad and it was honestly disappointing. The soups tasted like they were from a can, especially the clam chowder and chicken tortilla. The chicken tortilla was a disgrace by the way. It was thick and way too salty. Chicken tortilla soup should be clear and light. The salads were kinda unhealthy. Definitely ask for dressing on the side because they liked to drown their salads. I got the wedge which was covered in ranch and bacon  No thanks. The tomato salad was whatever. House salad was the only decent one because it was pretty much a normal salad with romaine, spring greens, carrots, etc. But hey, it's unlimited, so I brought some home. I like their normal cookie pizookies, so I decided to try the monkey bread version. Unless you like dense and thick chewy bread, this is your thing. I like my monkey bread fluff and light, so this was disappointing. Ice cream was delivered though, especially the chocolate Ghirardelli. Anyway, still had a good time and will definitely come again and get a pizza."
Sandra L.,"Irvine, CA",1,24,13,5.0,12/14/2017,"Hadn't been here for awhile but had an amazing experience for our company's Christmas party.  The food was great!  I had forgotten how extensive the menu was.   I had the holiday pork chop which was delicious and huge, and also enjoyed many of their appetizers...loved the Brussels sprouts.  We were seated on the patio and it was perfect weather for it.  The atmosphere was fun and the service excellent.   The general manager Al, even came to check up on our party several times and helped us take photos.   Of course the pizookies are always a hit, I didn't know they came in personal sizes so you don't have to feel like you're really destroying your diet to indulge.  Great food and menu, fun atmosphere, and awesome service all add up to a great place for a party!"
Ashley P.,"Seal Beach, CA",54,8,16,5.0,12/14/2017,"I recently attended my work Christmas party at BJ's.  We ordered several appetizers, main courses and for desserts pizookies.   From the moment we arrived all of the staff was very friendly. We didn't have to wait long to be seated. Our server was very prompt with our drink orders and the refills just kept coming even before I was at the half way mark there was another one waiting for me!  I never had to ask like I do at most restaurants. Our appetizers arrived and they were so good.  I highly recommend the cheese curds and the potato skins.  I ordered the prime rib special which was huge! Two people could have shared it so I had left overs for lunch the next day. My dinner also came with the pizookies, I choose chocolate chip. Even though I was stuffed from dinner I hate 2/3 of it by myself. The only regret I have about the pizookies is that I had never had one until that day!  The whole experience at BJ's was awesome. They really made our Christmas party a great one. The manager Al even came over to greet us and took a group picture for us to remember our Christmas Party!  Thanks BJ's! I will definitely be seeing you guys again, especially for that Pizookie!"
Randy L.,"Irvine, CA",144,224,326,5.0,5/27/2017,"DEEEEEEP Dish Pizza with EVERYTHING on it is simply delicious and awesome.  You will take some home.  Food at BJ's is always great.  Have not had a bad meal or poor service YET.  Great for a date; lunch or dinner meal time; groups large and small; business or causal dining.  For groups, make sure to make a reservation FIRST, or you will be waiting a long time, but they always try to accommodate the drop in groups. Food and service 5-Star, HANDS DOWN!"
Sunny S.,"Irvine, CA",28,92,302,3.0,8/16/2017,"Overall good experience could've been a 4 star but will stick with 3 for now.  -Service was somewhat decent. It's hard to judge when you have multiple people serving you.  -Food quality was very good; the only comment I have is on the pizza; please put enough toppings specially when you're charging extra for jalapeños etc.  Oh also, check your receipt before you pay as I discovered I was charged for an extra appetizer and when I brought it to my server attention her comment to me was ""I'm glad you caught it""."
Trevor O.,"La Mesa, CA",39,6,,3.0,12/30/2017,"I order takeout from here a couple times a year. Always order the same thing...Large buffalo chicken pizza. SOMETIMES it's my favorite junk food, and other times it's soooo disappointing. They are vv inconsistent ‍"
Jessamine A.,"Tustin, CA",11,318,328,4.0,8/26/2017,"The family and I came here on a Monday for the ""half price pizza"" deal. A large pizza plus potato skins was definitely more than enough.  The leftovers were lunch for the hubby for a couple days after that. All for under $30.00!  You can't go wrong with that to feed a family of four.  Unfortunately the pizza and potato skins were too good we ate so much that we didn't even have room for a pizookie. I know, I know...I'm a bad mother! Shame on me.  LOL!  The potato skins were quartered pieces fried crispy then baked/broiled with the toppings of cheese, bacon and chives.  Served with sour cream and ranch dressing and just the right amount of pieces to feed us all.  We love their new wireless/remote service the servers have for placing our orders to the kitchen. It sure speeds up the drink and food delivery to the table. Did you know you can also pay your bill via the BJ's mobile app? Pretty technology savvy!"
J H.,"Palm Desert, CA",0,15,2,4.0,12/29/2017,"Wonderful experience! We frequent this location, and our last visit was great! Quickly seated, great and timely service, and the food was delicious.  Our waitress was so kind. We will continue to come here when that pizookie craving hits!"
Bruce A.,"Corona, CA",22,51,26,4.0,11/17/2017,"Mini Sweet Pig Pizza is my favorite. Couple that with a wedge salad, and some appetizers = I'm quite full. No room for a Pazooki today."
Thomas V.,"Irvine, CA",841,106,307,3.0,1/11/2017,"I really do enjoy their food, but it can be hit or miss at times. But that seems like a common theme among most chain restaurants. However, the food I generally get at this BJ's is usually well made.  This particular BJ's is situated at the Tustin Marketplace among a variety of different restaurants. It is located on the corner of Jamboree and Irvine Blvd. Parking can be an issue at times since the area is packed with many different shops and restaurants, but I usually am able to find parking without too much trouble. This BJ's is pretty large and there is a waiting area for those waiting to pick up food or waiting to be seated. The inside is usually pretty clean and the tables are well kept.  The food is the same food you would find at any BJ's, so I'll talk more about the execution. I've had the sirloin steak at several different BJ's and have never been disappointed by the quality of the steak at this location. I've also had several other dishes and have usually not been disappointed. The service at this BJ's is also usually very good, all of the staff and friendly and helpful. Overall, this BJ's is a solid choice if you're looking for some good quality chain restaurant food."
Rebekkah C.,"Orange County, CA",598,385,3780,4.0,12/17/2016,"SOLID FOOD and GREAT SERVICE!  Complimentary meal valued under $12.95 to all Military Veterans. Staff were nice and friendly. We were greeted with a smile and was seated outside to enjoy the fresh air. Food we had were good and came in a timely manner. We had.. -AVOCADO EGGROLLS- Yummy!!! Crunchy on the outside and creamy on the inside. A bit greasy but tasty. -SPAGHETTI and MEATBALS (lunch portion)- Portion was still big and easily filled me up. Meatballs were perfectly cooked and noodles weren't soggy. It was delicious and I'd get it again.  -BISON BURGER- El Hubby enjoyed it. It was his complimentary meal. Grilled buffalo patty with bbq sauce, green chiles and pico de gallo. It was lean yet very flavorful and delicious. Highly recommend it.  -TATONKA STOUT- A rich dark beer with hints of coffee or chocolate. Get it.  Our server was really nice and attentive. She checked on us and made sure we had everything we needed. She was also knowledgeable with the menu esp with drinks. She recommended her favs and gave El hubby beer samples to try.  Overall, it was a good experience. I highly recommend this location."
Amado S.,"Tustin, CA",0,7,1,1.0,11/21/2017,"This review is based on ordering take out. Two nights ago I ordered boneless wings, avocado egg rolls, 2 side salads and a pazookie. My girlfriend went to pick it up about 25 minutes later since they told us it would be ready in 25-30 minutes. 45 minutes later, I get a phone call from her that the food is still not ready. About 10 minutes later from that point, I get a call that she finally got the food and she was on the way home. We live literally 2 minutes from this location. When she got home, the wings and avocado egg rolls were soggy and cold. How were they like this if the food was not ready on time and we supposedly got the food right as it was prepared? To top it all off, the pazookie was burnt.  I love BJ's and have never had a bad experience dining in, but their take out was terrible. It was a waste of my ~$35 because I tossed the wings, avocado egg rolls and pazookie in the trash. At least the ice cream was good..... guess they couldn't really mess that one up."
Jacqueline K.,"Diamond Bar, CA",918,153,932,1.0,6/18/2017,"Stopped by around 11pm because of late night cravings for pizookies. First time trying BJ's pizookies & was such a disappointment!!  Ordered the SALTED CARAMEL pizookie & BJ'S FAVORITE pizza. Both were awful & tasted like store bought/pre-made food. I could've bought Albertsons' cookies + vanilla ice cream + frozen pizza & had a more delectable meal. To top it off, service was meh & seemed like they all hated their jobs."
Joe J.,"Irvine, CA",8,75,24,3.0,12/10/2017,"The Buffalo Chicken Pizza is the only way to go! Everytime I come here, I always say I'm going to try something different but once I look at the menu, my taste buds just gravitate right back to the Buffalo Chicken Pizza! Get it! The only reason why I didn't give a 5 star is because sometimes when I get my pizza they don't put enough chicken. They should really focus on putting more meat on their pizzas"
Alva T.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,13,7,5.0,10/30/2017,"Great service and awesome food! Their exclusive alcohol suggested by Brady were delicious!  Speaking of Brady... she was simply the best. Her smile and really friendly attitude makes me want to come back again and again, thanks so much Brady for a memorable night with people that mean so much to me. We created great memories tonight and you were a part of that. Thanks again BJ's!"
Grace B.,"Huntington Beach, CA",238,458,279,5.0,4/22/2017,"I am the last person that would ever be up for a corporate establishment for dinner. I just prefer my hole in the walls. The other night though, we were celebrating a birthday and this is where everyone chose to go so I made the best of it. It must have just been my night, cause we started off with impeccable service by Sam. He was one of the most genuine and friendliest servers I have had in a while. He patiently answered all our questions, was quick to acknowledge us if we ever needed anything, and consistently came by our table to check on us. We started with his recommended appetizer of the sampler plate since we didn't know which ones to choose from. It came with buffalo chicken tenders, mozzarella sticks, spinach artichoke dip with chips, and avocado egg rolls. We all devoured it. Next, for my meal, I chose the barbacoa chicken and substituted the brown rice for coleslaw. The chicken was seasoned wonderfully and the flavor of the whole dish was great. My husband had the buffalo burger wrapped in lettuce and preferred my meal to his. Others ordered regular burgers and had no complaints. I couldn't keep my fingers off everyone's fries. They really do their burgers and fries like a burger dedicated restaurant. I'm pretty impressed, they're definitely doing something right!"
Michelle D.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,4,,2.0,11/28/2017,"Great if you are there....not a great grubhub delivery experience. Got our order on time, however it should have been 2 burgers with fries and two add on wedge salads. Received 2 burgers, no fries and 4 add on salads...which they charged me for 4. When I called, they said, ""that must be frustrating, your fries are here if you want to come pick them up."" Really? I paid $2.99 for them to pack up the food. Paid 15% tip. Paid the delivery man $5 tip and paid a fee for Grubhub. Soooooo not worth the chance to get food delivery. Better to call it in, go, check it, leave and go home. Saves nearly $20 that way."
Bryan M.,"San Jose, CA",388,3,,1.0,11/28/2017,"Went there late night on a Saturday after work. Hostess directed us towards the bar. We sat waiting at our table for ten minutes, only to be passed by the bald waiter as he greeted a table who walked in during the ten minutes after us. He then proceeded to walk back to the POS station near the bar. I had to physically walk up to him and ask him for assistance. I was hungry and refused to wait to be noticed any longer but if I had who knows how long it would take to be noticed. Our table was in plain sight. Super annoyed at service, or should I say the lack thereof."
Joy G.,"Loma Linda, CA",1,4,,5.0,9/16/2017,"Had fabulous service. No waiting 4ish on Friday. The best cauliflower tacos I ever eaten! Even meat lovers eod enjoy these. Soft warm pita filled with sauteed cauliflower topped with shredded lettuce, cheese and a yogurt sauce. Absolutely a feel good meal! Of course top it off with a white chocolate macadamia piezookie to finalize the feel good sensation!"
Larry M.,"Tustin, CA",0,6,,1.0,8/22/2017,Recently informed by a very unhappy family member that there is now a membership rewards program that seats you prior to those unregistered and previously waiting!!! If that be the case then this 10 year plus attendee and family will be taking our business across the parking lot for future dining............... No matter how much I like their Jeramiah Red! This is a terrible marketing idea.
Yoshie M.,"Hemet, CA",4,35,29,5.0,6/17/2017,"My husband and I have talked about going to BJ's many times before but never did, until today.  We got there around 6pm the day before Father's Day. The place was packed with 30 to 40 min. wait. My husband HATES wait! However, the hostess suggested because we were just two of us we could get seated at the bar tables. So we did. Thanx to the hostess! A server came right away! Tiana was very friendly, attentive and knowledgeable. We ordered 2 Ribs Pork Chop and 15oz Prime Rib. Pork chop was at least 2 inch thick, and perfectly cooked and perfectly seasoned! The best pork chop I have ever tasted. Prime Rib was tender and flavorful and minimum of fat.  Pizooki came with Prime Rib dinner. Huge, freshly baked cookie ( many choices) with 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream on top. Yum! My husband said he would definitely come back, which he rarely say. Great food. Great service.   Btw, they gave my husband a ""Happy Father's Day"" glass and a 20% off coupon card for Father's Day. Nice!"
Christina S.,"Irvine, CA",147,118,40,1.0,8/15/2017,"Service from the hostess the last few times at this location have been unpleasant and rude.   We just went this past Sunday as a party of 10 and my friend called me to let me know that she called in to put her name down.  When I arrived, I told the hostess, Liza or Elisa (was given both these names from different people), that we had reservations for 10.  She told me that there wasn't any reservations under that name and that there wasn't any reservations for 10 people.   Fine.  She continues to look at me with a blank stare so I asked her to put my name down and she said FINE.  Straight out glared at me and had so much attitude that I really was ready to walk out.  Does she not know that she's the greeter and is supposed to be pleasant and inviting?  No one taught her this working as a hostess at a family restaurant?   We were never asked if we were ok with the patio and that's where our table was set up.  It was 90 degrees out and the ceiling fan was basically a joke.  We were drenched in sweat. This was definitely an unpleasant dining experience all around."
Abbe W.,"Irvine, CA",619,616,1261,4.0,8/24/2016,"My family and I were there last week and found out that they now have a rewards plan.  Through the sign up, we found out about the Prime Rib Tuesday Special so we came to check it out. It's a three course dinner meal for $27.99 (I think).   The appetizer course had a choice of soup or salad.  My first choice was The Wedge but I really wanted to try the Twisted BLT, which was very good and light.  There wasn't any ""L"" but more of ""S"" for spinach.  Perfect size to get started. The main course was of course the Prime Rib.  My meat was medium rare.  It was done perfectly and paired with Roasted Brussel Sprouts, rice pilaf and 14oz goodness.  The au ju's and horseradish were very nice addon.  I couldn't finish it so brought some for lunch.  The dessert course was the signature pizookie.  My husband and I thought it was the mini pizookie but instead it's the full size.  So we had two pizzokies.  I would have been happy with just a mini but the full size definitely filled up the sugar level! Overall, it was very nice dinner.  The special is only on Tuesday selected BJ's so please check your local BJ's.  It's also limited so go early for dinner."
Derek T.,"Tustin, CA",7,3,1,3.0,7/6/2017,"I always get take out here and the food is good most nights but every time I order something they almost always forget something! Either my burger doesn't have fries, the balsamic I asked for is Caesar, or just not paying attention to special instructions.   Want to give a good review but it's about what you'd expect from a chain; although even as a regular I'm sometimes disappointed."
Susie L.,"Irvine, CA",25,14,45,4.0,8/22/2017,"My mom and I love coming here for happy hour. We've tried a lot of their food and they're all tasty. We usually share a salad and pizza with beer, it is really amazing. The service and the atmosphere there is always great."
Charles N.,"Orange County, CA",165,107,65,4.0,8/29/2017,"It's a great place to grab a drink, munch on some chicken wings, hang out with a buddy, and watch a game. If you come here with that mindset, you'll love this restaurant. Don't expect to get gourmet meals. You go somewhere else for that. Service is always great. It can get very crowded, especially during Happy Hours. As for #Thinsulin approved green light drinks, go for the wine or hard liquor on the rocks, but avoid the red light drinks such as beers and mixed drinks since they spike insulin."
Jake A.,"Irvine, CA",537,167,53,4.0,4/6/2017,"My wife has been talking about half-off pizza Mondays for... a long time. So we got the large deep dish classic BJ's whatever pizza and it was sooo good. We normally grab domino's or little caesar's on the go or a quick slice or for group events, and I think I forgot what a good deep dish pizza tastes like! Obviously, I'm not comparing to authentic Chicago deep dish or anything like that, but you know what I mean. It was only about 12 bucks and it could definitely feed three people. The avocado egg-rolls may say that it comes with six pieces, but it's really six HALF PIECES. When I bit into the deliciousness I forgot how upset I was about feeling jipped on the half pieces. But I won't drop 11 bucks for that again."
