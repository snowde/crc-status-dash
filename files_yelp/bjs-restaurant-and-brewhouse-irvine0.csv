John C.,"Newport Beach, CA",11,209,5,4.0,4/22/2017,"We were not expecting much since itwas chosen by a grandson. Yet we were surprised by how tasty the food was. The prime rib , served only on Fridays & Saturdays, was as good as any priced more than twice as much without the included soup or salad plus the specialty dessert. The wait staff was attentive. The place does get crowded towards the evening. This place provides good food for the money. Do note that you cannot get there via El Toro road but via a side street off El Toro.  Cheers Just noted that this review was on the Irvine last cation even though I had meant this to be for the El Toro one."
Sheila F.,"Irvine, CA",0,4,,1.0,5/24/2017,"I have emailed  bjs twice and still no response .  We had the worst service ever. Our food was not prepared  correctly, we ran out of drinks and our server was busy chatting with another customer .  We usually  order a pizookie  but the server never asked us. We are loyalty members too. The hostess was very good she kept us updated on our booth request. You would think management  would want to rectify  our bad experience . ..."
Kristy M.,"Irvine, CA",80,84,40,4.0,9/13/2016,Make sure you sign up for a free membership to get free pizookie and points towards food. I've been here twice on Monday for the 50% off large deep dish pizzas and tarven cuts. Such a deal! ~$13 for a pizza enough for 3 people or for left overs.
Ellie Q.,"Irvine, CA",54,100,150,1.0,11/8/2014,"Terrible take-out food and service. It took 40 min to get our food. Everything we ordered was barely warm when they gave it to me. By the time I get to the hospital (my daughter was admitted) the food was cold and dry and hard. Yuck! We ended up only eating the two mini pizzas between the four of us. We tossed the cold cheeseburger  with hard bread, the so overcooked potato skins, all the fries and BBQ beef sandwiches.  Very disappointed in this BJ's."
Spence L.,"Irvine, CA",0,8,1,1.0,10/22/2016,"The cooks should be embarrassed of their ability (or lack thereof) to make a pizookie. Today we ordered the trio, one of which was a peanut butter cookie (one of their classics). It was undercooked and doughy. I told my server, who was very nice about it, and she brought out another. It was clearly less cooked than the previous peanut butter pizookie - much blonder- and needed probably 4 more minutes in the oven.  Not only did I not want to eat a plate full of cookie dough, but uncooked dough is a health hazard. It can cause salmonella in a normal healthy adult. I am pregnant on top of this, and it could be dangerous for my child. I was absolutely appalled at this location's inability to produce their classic dessert with two tries."
Abigail J.,"Anaheim, CA",0,6,,5.0,5/11/2017,"Me and my friend just had a great experience with our waiter Jordan, he was slammed with tables and was still able to check in and deliver in a timely manner. Also he was the friendliest waiter I've encountered in about 2 years! Promote him!"
Yelp Is Bullshit B.,"Irvine, CA",24,152,14,2.0,11/12/2015,"Loved their happy hours, it saved me a few bucks.  I only ordered one item from this chain, the Santa Fe spring rolls.  It never failed me.  However, I would not come here just for this one item.  This BJ's location had better, more efficient customer service than some other ones of its chain. Food = Not good 1/5 Environment = Decent 2/5 Curbside Takeout Service = Decent 2/5 Customer Service = Adequate 2/5 Overall Satisfaction = Needs Improvement 2/5"
Azzy O.,"Orange, CA",157,106,17,2.0,10/3/2015,"I decided to not pay anymore patronage to the location at The Block due to horrible customer service and give this location a try after so many years.  First off, at 3:00PM it was very empty. There were booths available for at least 4 other groups of parties if needed. We were a party of 5 and a child and the hostess put us at a table w 4 chairs and where was my 2 yrs old to sit, on my lap? I asked for a booth so she won't fall or even get a highchair and she said she couldn't because there were so many reservations. As long as I remembered, there were only reservations a day ahead for parties of 8 or more. So I had to ask and she did confirm that you only need if there were parties of 8 or more and that's why we couldn't sit there. After we sat, she sat a bunch of parties of 2 or 3 people per empty booth. Why didn't her excuse as to why we couldn't get bigger table applied to them?  My point was that it's not about table or booth, it's about how she was seating other 2 or 3 people that had no reservations where she could easily sat us with a child. This is not our choice of place to eat but where my daughter loves the pizza so it's the initial reason why we are here. I also let one of the manager know and he truly apologized how she handled us.  Tip to hostess, when you see a child (offer highchair), someone disabled or elderly... try to make their visit comfortable. It's not difficult because it was pretty empty at the time. There are plenty of other places to eat nearby. I was just trying to make my child happy on her birthday for her favorite pizza and pizookie."
Jorge S.,"Santa Ana, CA",1,9,,5.0,10/4/2016,"I love this place!!! Came in with a group of friends after out beer league softball and found seating at the bar. Our waitress (Bonnie) came up to us within a minute of sitting down, gave us menus and said she'd be right back to take our order. She came back about 2 min later and brought us waters. Took our drinks order and gave us some awesome recommendations for some grub. My buddy ordered a salad (don't judge him) and he said it was good. On her recommendation, I ordered the Irish Root Beer and damn that thing is bomb! She took our order and gave us great suggestions! Our overall experience with Bonnie was great. She cracked jokes with us throughout our visit, checked in on us regularly, and made us feel right at home! I'll definitely be back!"
Page H.,"Mission Viejo, CA",121,39,27,1.0,10/17/2015,"I've had multiple unsatisfactory services at this BJ's location, and I continued to go back because it's near our home...but after today, I am NEVER going back. Again, this is a complaint on their customer service. This complaint is about our service on October 17th, 2015, and it began at 6pm. My husband, 8-month old son, and I arrived at 6pm to meet up with my parents and brother. I told the hostess that there was a reservation at 6pm under my father's name; instead of checking to see if they were already seated, the hostess said, ""I'm not sure if they're here, but feel free to walk around and see if they are."" What?! You can't check to see if they're here?! I'M the one who's supposed to do YOUR job? Ridiculous! As it turns out, my family had not yet arrived at that point; but after they did arrive, the seating hostess sat us at the BUSIEST aisle, knowing that we had a child that required a high-chair (that had to be placed in this very busy aisle, which was by the kitchen). My son's chair was pushed as far in as possible (so that he wasn't in the way), and a bus boy STILL came rushing around the corner and collided into my son. My son got startled and started crying, of course, but I was glad that nothing had spilt on him (like hot food or a stack of plates). Right afterwards, a man named Chuck (I'm guessing he was the manager/supervisor) came up to our table and asked us if everything was okay. We told him that, for the future, it would be best not to seat parties with a child requiring a high chair in the busiest aisle of the restaurant. He apologized and asked if he could get us anything; since we were still eating our dinner, we said we were okay at the moment. We were going to stay for dessert, but everyone was upset about the service that we decided to get dessert somewhere else. When we got the check, we were shocked that we weren't comp'ed for a meal or given a discount. I was so upset that I just wanted to get the hell out of there. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! You're so lucky that my 8-month old kid didn't get hurt! I'm not so angry with the bus boy as I am with the hostess and manager. The bus boy was very apologetic, and I can tell he was very remorseful. But the seating hostess needs to do her job (and use common sense), and the manager needs to know how to handle these situations better. We are NEVER coming back here."
Cindy Y.,"Boston, MA",576,333,878,4.0,9/5/2014,"When you walk into BJ's, you are greeted with absolutely beautiful decorations, with huge TV's mounted high up on the walls and that intimate ambiance. It's definitely a great place if you just want some drinks, dessert, or a nice dinner. Service is great and food arrives pretty promptly, despite the fact that they are so busy! I came here several times, mostly for pizookies, once for brunch, and several times for dinners. While most things are ""A-OK,"" what I definitely recommend are the pizookies and the pizzas! PIZOOKIES: they have a ton! There is a new one (salted caramel), white chocolate macadamian nut, cookies and cream, triple chocolate, smores, and the classic chocolate chip (also available gluten-free). Out of those ones, my favorite has got to be the white chocolate macadamian. It's actually the least sweet among all of them, and that works well, in my opinion. Since this is practically ice cream and cookie, you're going to get a lot of sweetness. When the cookie isn't too sweet, it provides just the right amount of chewy, yet delicious, goodness that melts your ice cream and delivers heaven to your taste buds. The macadamian nut is amazing, because you get white chocolate bits and macadamian nuts as you bite into it. Provides a nice crunch that is great! PIZZAS: what's special is that their crust is thick. They do it well. The crust is thick, yet so soft but crispy on the outside. It tastes absolutely amazing. My family and I got the White Pizza, which was great. The alfredo sauce really gave the pizza a nice creamy flavor that paired well with the tomatoes on it. The mushrooms were also absolutely tasty. I had a hard time trying to stop myself from finishing all of it so my family could have some. Overall, come here for the pizookies and pizzas! Haven't tried their drinks, but they look great. We also got the pastas, which weren't that great. Not much flavor to them, although the shrimp scampi definitely wins out over the chicken pasta. Whenever I'm craving that pizookie or thick crust pizza, I know where to go."
Brenna P.,"Orange, CA",34,61,2,1.0,10/16/2015,"I came here tonight for my birthday with a group of friends, and there were 10 of us in all. Our server, Joseph B, gave some of the worst service I have ever received.  He rarely refilled our waters and we had to ask multiple times, with no apologies from him. It took a while just to get sides of sauces we asked for in the first place and had to remind him. But this wasn't what really upset us. Upon paying the bill we were 62 cents short (I held the tip for later) so my friend put in a dollar then I put in the tip money ($16) and he kept it all without giving us any change. We would have given it to him anyway but we saw him shove the money in his back pocket. This was so unprofessional that he did not even give us back any change and I am not sure if that is even legal. By far the worst service I have ever received. I'm not sure if I will ever return to this location."
Dave W.,"Tustin, CA",44,16,6,1.0,7/3/2016,"Bad service, expensive drinks and food, long lines for no apparent reason...this will be our last time.  Our waitress was awful...inattentive, forgetful, and had the grace of an orangutan.  This place really has kinda turned into a joke.  $17 for a Flatbread medium pizza, for reals?  Are you guys like Spagos now?  $9 for your own home brew?  Come on.  Anyway, I'm sure you'll get a few suckers to pay that maybe once or twice until they figure out you're 3rd rate in every way."
Kurtis C.,"Anaheim, CA",154,354,56,4.0,10/27/2014,"This past weekend I went to BJs for a friend's birthday dinner. It was busy, but the service was still good compared to how hectic it must've been for the staff. Anyway, my girlfriend and I ordered food a little bit after the rest of the party ordered. I don't think it took us over 5 minutes to get our order in. The food arrived for everyone else, but after they finished, our food still hadn't come out yet. I wasn't really hungry to begin with, I just didn't want to hold everyone else up because of our order so we decided to cancel it. We were by no means upset, but they tried to rush our order out anyway. In the end, they offered to comp our food which would have been fine if they cancelled it, but they also brought out the food! I felt really bad because I felt like they thought we were a charity case or some freeloaders. I won't lie, the food was really good, but it still didn't feel right. Anyway, I just felt like leaving a review saying thanks and I hope we didn't get anyone in trouble. :)"
Marie AK C.,"Orange County, CA",1160,344,1863,4.0,1/9/2014,"Love coming here to watch sports in the bar area. Wish they showed UFC/boxing events. They have great happy hour specials. My faves are mini BJs favorite pizza, spinach artichoke dip, lettuce wraps & buffalo wings. They have a pretty extensive menu that includes pizza (of course), salads and pastas. Make sure you save room for their famous pizookie. Believe it or not, I can kill a ""pizza platter size"" (intended to serve an entire family) by myself! Proof is in my photos :) Pros: Great menu selection. Good service. Awesome happy hour specials. The bar is a great area to watch games and sporting events.  Cons: During peak hours, especially on weekends, you will have to wait to be seated."
Alycia M.,"San Diego, CA",445,14,1,2.0,10/4/2015,"Originally ordered the mahi mahi and shrimp and it was terrible covered in a soup like Sauce, and tasted so bland and impossible to chew. Then had Santa Fe salad that tasted like cafeteria food.. Ordered pizookie which was good. Should have gotten pizza to begin with, NEVER coming back. Waitress was very nice."
Kayla L.,"Irvine, CA",125,35,,3.0,8/20/2016,Pazookies are to die for. I also usually order the fries and the mozzerella sticks for appetizer. The pizza is excellent and so is the chicken alfredo. A little pricey though. Service is a hit or miss.
Jerry M.,"Tustin, CA",3426,803,614,3.0,1/7/2015,"Good beer, i liked the red ale. Otherwise typical bar food resturant. If you like beer with pizza, burgers, chicken and something sweet for desert, you could do way worse."
N C.,"Irvine, CA",1,141,794,4.0,11/10/2015,"Love their happy hour specials :). Staples we always order and are never disappointed with: avocado egg rolls and the Mediterranean pizza- minus chicken, add corn. Oh. So. Good."
Marissa M.,"Placentia, CA",28,9,,1.0,8/31/2016,Went for a quick lunch today with my mom. Found a dead fly in my roll up next to my fork and knife. Will not be coming back!
