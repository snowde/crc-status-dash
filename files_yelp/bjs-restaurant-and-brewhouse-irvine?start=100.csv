Nahla B.,"Tustin, CA",52,4,1,5.0,3/13/2017,One of my favorite places to dine.  Menu has big varieties to choose from. I love their Avocado Rolls. Prices are very reasonable.
Jennifer N.,"Irvine, CA",2,61,67,5.0,10/13/2017,"My sister and I get consistently great and friendly service every time we come here. On my most recent visit, I ordered the sunset peach iced tea, sweet potato fries, and the soup and salad combo with a bread bowl of vegan lentil soup and a house salad topped with vinaigrette dressing while my sister got hibiscus tea, chips with salsa, and a vegetarian version of their spaghetti without the meatballs. I enjoyed my soup in a bread bowl, and was pleasantly glad that the bread bowl wasn't stale or hard as a rock like I've had at another establishment in the distant past; in fact, it was delicious, and I only wish I didn't get full so quickly so that I could actually eat the bread bowl itself. At the end though, one of the servers or food runner/expo came by our table and dropped off another sunset peach and hibiscus tea even though we had already paid our check, so there was a lot of confusion between my sister and I over what happened."
Darien S.,"Irvine, CA",454,7,,3.0,1/25/2017,"I'd consider BJ's an alternative to Yard House, but more family oriented. The service has always been great, and accommodating. For what it is, BJ's brewery is a solid lunch/dinner spot, but definitely not a huuuge favorite of mine by any means. I've been to both the Westwood UCLA and Huntington Main St. location one time each, and the Tustin Marketplace location 3-4 times. But to me that's not very many occasions at all having lived around many of them for the past 6 years!  My one complaint about food would be that I wish the pizza could be saucier. That might be preferential, but the last time I went, I felt like our 'BJ's favorite' was overloaded with all the toppings,  but terribly dough-ey. I doubt that is a trademark of deep dish but could be wrong...so my thoughts on that are... find a pizza that can do both! Other menu thoughts are that the boneless wings are really good! AND of course the ultimate menu standout ......you guessed it....THE PIZOOKIES are amazing! I especially LOVE the red velvet one....yummmm!"
Mike R.,"Tustin, CA",0,4,1,4.0,8/3/2017,"I know Bjs isn't a ""sports bar"", but you could at least get a cable system that works. Check your dish location or box. The last two years or so, the system goes out out for certain stations like FOX  sports when there are weather issues. And there were no weather issues tonight. A joke. And yet, next door at a competitor, all is well. Not good. Should not be an issue."
Danny T.,"Irvine, CA",96,11,12,3.0,5/8/2017,"Always busy, hard to find your waiter. Everyone is all over the place. Rude employees. They can be more organized"
Rachel T.,"Irvine, CA",67,969,239,3.0,3/29/2016,"3.5  BJ's has always been the bomb since day one! I remember when my sister first started taking us there in the HB location and I thought it was the cats meow! I still feel that way especially since their menu is forever changing and evolving! Sometimes we'd have lunch at the HB location while in the area getting our nails done but now that she's moved to Irvine and we've moved out of state things are so different now :( I was in town for 2 days to see my sister and we came here on our last night and I couldn't believe how packed it was for a Wednesday night! OMG! Just about every table was filled and bigger parties were coming in by the droves! Luckily my sister walks extremely fast and was able to snag a table in the bar area LOL!  In the beginning the service was spotty, it took quite a bit to get menus and water, our server was slammed and was constantly on the go so I can only be upset at management not her because their wasn't enough employees. Once she was able to get us menus and drinks, we started with appetizers! Coming to BJ's is the best place for appetizers! They have so many to choose from, some to eat by yourself, some to share with your pals!  We started with: -Bone in chicken wings (we like ours with sauce on the side so we can enjoy the wing on its own and dunk our own sauces on it) Their wings are always on point, I've never had a bad order of wings, their always crispy and never soggy! -Potstickers: These are my go to! I wish they gave you more! We can easily sniff these up! Their always delicious and the dipping sauce is great too!  -Cup of clam chowder: The chowder is nice and creamy, not too watered down, I wish it had more potatoes but other than this is a solid choice everytime! Down to the entrées LOL My mom and sister both went for burgers and I tried one of their new Piadianas and was kind of disappointed :/ In the picture they look super ooey gooey and cheesy! However without any kind of sauce it is really dry, and the cheese was melted properly so it was kind of thick and coagulated :/  Other than that everything else was just delicious! Service got better throughout the night and my sister took home a Cookies and Cream Pizookie! I was too full and sleepy to try it but she said it was delicious!  This is going to be are go to location since it's close to my sister's house and the food is always on point! ^__^"
Jennifer H.,"Orange, CA",45,151,17,2.0,11/20/2016,"Overall, I guess it was mediocre. There's a few reasons why I deducted two stars. First reason is plates were dirty. And when I say dirty, I mean wet with dried up leftover pieces of food like an onion or something. Second reason, service was not exactly the best. I mean, the waitress herself seem nice enough but she wasn't such a great ""waitress"" if that makes sense. Maybe she was extremely busy, I don't know but her service was definitely lacking. And my final reason is the food was not hot. For appetizer, I ordered the spinach stuffed mushrooms. This is a dish I've had many times before and usually it comes out so hot that I would burn myself. This time it came out room temperature, borderline cold. Same with the pizza but it was a bit better. Still not anywhere close to ""just got out of an oven"" hot, but it was still somewhat warm. Now if you're wondering why I didn't complain to the waitress, well she wasn't exactly around. Our appetizer came out and we had no small plates. Our pizza came out and we had no red peppers or cheese. We needed to ask for every single thing, that is if we can find her. The food itself is not bad though. It would have been perfect if only it was hot."

Regina O.,"Huntington Beach, CA",1409,673,1940,4.0,3/25/2015,"I've always had good experiences at BJ's.  I usually go for their pizza's and pizookies.  On my most recent trip here, my boyfriend and I ordered their Spinach & Artichoke dip, their new Spicy Hawaiian Pizza--pineapples, jalepenos, roasted tomatoes & chicken and their Balsamic Chicken Entree. The spinach and artichoke dip was really good.  My only complaint is that they could've added more spinach to the dip and if it wasn't so runny.  The dip was really thin and I prefer my dips to be thicker.  Once we were done with the dip, my boyfriend asked our waitress for some salsa which she brought out for us with no problems or extra cost!  Great way to eat up all those left over chips hehe. The Spicy Hawaiian pizza was also pretty good.  I don't know what it was missing but it wasn't as delicious as we had imagined it to be.  I did like how the pineapples added some sweetness to the pizza while the jalepenos added spice.  It was a good twist of flavors but something was missing.  Maybe use ham or bacon instead of chicken?  I did like how thick the cheese was... you could literally pull and pull at it before it'd break apart.  The Balsamic chicken entree is one of my boyfriends favorite plates to get here.  We got it upon his request.  The chicken was tender and not dry at all.  The mashed potatoes was seasoned very well and I like how they added onion strings on top.  Everything just paired very well with each other and it's actually a pretty generous amount of food.   This place can get busy and happy hour is ONLY at the bar :/  Kind of a bummer because I hate waiting around at the bar for a table and I would rather eat my meals elsewhere.  I hope they change that in the near future!"
Debbie M.,"Orange County, CA",553,41,37,5.0,4/12/2017,"I've always loved BJs but only recently did I begin coming for lunch. They have fantastic lunch specials and the service is always great, despite being usually busy. I also noticed their enhanced technology integrations lately, with the waitstaff taking orders on tablets and the ability to download their app and order ahead. My friend and I tried that last time we went for lunch and enjoyed that our food was ready right after we arrived."
Karim S.,"Irvine, CA",288,128,348,1.0,2/24/2017,Ok so came in to pick up an order today and the Latina lady at take out was so unbelievably rude it was ridiculous ... Just huge attitude was talking down to me like I was stupid her whole tone was just confrontational and rude... She also was reluctant to give me napkins and utensils when I asked her for extra ... Like she was too bothered...  just horrible... Food business can totally be stressful I understand... I've worked in it but If you hate your job then find somewhere else to work.
Frank n Gaby T.,"Tustin, CA",0,21,16,3.0,1/8/2017,"Placed an order through GrubHub was 15 minutes late.  Ordered a BJ's Brewhouse Burger no cheese, crispy thin seasoned fries, two house salads avocado egg rolls, bacon cheeseburger with wedge cut seasoned fries and a salted caramel Pizookie for a total of $64.45. The burgers were really greasy very old produce, the egg rolls were soggy The Salted Caramel Pizookie was not the size that you get in the restaurant and it was $7.50.  One of the burgers was not supposed to have cheese and there was grated cheese burned onto the bun.  The vegetables in the salad are old and wilted.  The french fries were cold they did not provide wedge fries they were both shoestring so the order was incorrect everything was so greasy the only thing we ate was the burger and that is just the meat we just wasted $65 McDonald's would have been Gourmet compared to this will never be eating again from this establishment!  So angry right now.   Update to my review:  my husband contacted the restaurant directly to put in a complaint spoke with Evan and Elin who were both very apologetic and handled the situation very professionally thank you to you both we were advised to contact GrubHub directly to deal with the issue and they credited our acct. Immediately!  They also offered to remake our food and send it out with one of their own drivers in addition to a gift card which was a very kind gesture.  Thank you Evan and Elin for your excellent customer service!  We will give BJ's another chance."
Zari B.,"Irvine, CA",12,26,23,5.0,7/11/2016,"Went there on Friday & ordered Salmon with quinoa, It was delicious, service was great & food was yummy! I'll definitely order the fish again!  My daughter ordered salad & she really liked it! We were very pleased with everything!"
Janelle J.,"San Juan Capistrano, CA",922,393,925,4.0,8/22/2015,"Tasted the pizza with banana peppers, tomato, pesto for the first time ever! It was so good. Next time I would get thin crust because it was bready for my taste.  Strawberry lemonade was great! Wish we didn't have to beg for refills. Party of 10, but the waiter handled our table great. Ended up being $140 for ten people (not including the alcoholic drinks) with us ordering 2 appetizers and 3 gourmet pizzas.  PAZOOKI! awesome as always. The triple Chocolate was VERY rich. My favorite was the classic chocolate chip."
Jamie N.,"Costa Mesa, CA",632,519,3854,4.0,3/21/2015,"Okay, I know BJ's is a chain with guests packing the house nightly, but what I find most worthy is their selection of bottled beers. If you love Belgians, this may be the go-to spot you hate to admit going to, but the list is pretty legit. My brother is a fan of Belgian beers with Chimay Blue at the top of his list, but he often ventures into sours, trippels, dubbels, and IPAs. And believe it or not, BJs is also one of his favorite places for beers.  We decided to grab dinner and some beers. He got his Chimay Blue and I tried something new, a sour! I had Supplication recently and although I liked it, it was much more tart than I expected. Petrus Oud Bruin is a wonderful introduction to sours as the dark, caramel brown ale has a slight sour tang without being overwhelming. I totally dig sours now! Can't wait to try more :) For dinner, I wasn't very hungry, so I just got the usual bar fare and a salad. I rarely eat salad as a meal, but roasted beets has been a favorite recently. This one was superb and only $4! It's in the healthy section lol. Dried cranberries, sweet yellow beets, strawberry balsamic vinaigrette and arugula - I would love to have this again. And then I ordered wings. Theirs is drizzled with a buffalo ranch, but it's pretty sparse so it doesn't sog up the crunchy wings.  Bro got a burger sandwich or something with their famous potatoes wedges. It's a must have for him, the potato wedges haha. After finishing his Chimay, he also got Goose Island's Sofie, a Belgian-Style Saison (Farmhouse) Ale.  I used to come here for pizookies, but now I'm all about the beers. Impressive! I'll be back lol"
Bassel ..,"Irvine, CA",0,5,,1.0,9/2/2016,"I LOVED coming to BJ's with friends probably 2-3 times a month. Nothing beats being able to grab a pizza, a steak, pasta, or dessert at 1 in the morning. That was until yesterday..... I feel horrible leaving this review but feel compelled to. I got to the restaurant and was greeted and seated very quickly (so far so good).  I look over the menu and see the soup bowl made out of bread. Looked amazing. I didn't want the soup though so I ordered my normal tavern cut pizza along with a bread bowl.  The bread bowl was amazing (for now). The pizza, so-so. It's hit and miss for some reason but I always tend to come back anyways.  I eat up everything and get the tab.... $10 for a piece of bread?!? What on earth. My friend ordered the SOUP AND BREAD BOWL  for $9.50.  I asked the waitress why it was $10 for the bread she stated that it can't be discounted. Ok fair enough but why not charge me $9.50? AND WHERE IS MY SOUP...? That makes absolutely no sense. It's not even about the $10. I would have paid $30 for the bread if that was the cost of the bread. But don't charge me full price PLUS $.50 and then not tell me it's the same price as a full meal. Or at least give me my soup.  Just didn't make any sense.  Not sure if I will be returning honestly. It's sad because I truly do love BJ's. It's a great atmosphere with friendly people and close to home.  I guess only time will tell."
Erin M.,"Irvine, CA",148,62,14,1.0,4/13/2017,"Turned off by their lack of service and weird attitude. Our server got a little spunky towards my friend when she gave her an expired ID. She keeps both with her in case of emergencies and handed her the wrong one. Also, I requested no chicken on my Cobb salad, so at the end of the meal I simply asked politely if I could have a discount for the chicken since I didn't get it on my salad. I did get a tiny bit of bacon (but I could've held that, too). The manager then came by and said they don't have a way to do a discount on their computer system...so yeah...weird response and I just felt that I didn't matter as a customer. I think in this day and age, doing a tiny discount for people who don't eat meat or who do without some meat isn't a big issue. What if we was full vegetarian and wanted a Cobb salad? There's no way to ring it in without meat for a discounted price? That's a little confusing for everyone. I work in a restaurant part-time and take off $6 on salads and lunches without chicken, beef, and fish. If it's a corporate policy, I'd gladly like to speak to corporate.  Our food was okay. Hot appetizers didn't come out hot at all. Our first server took a break and our second server was really busy.  But he was polite. I enjoy going to BJ's when I sit at the bar- I feel like I get better service and it's faster. It's still a good place to get a cold beer and some good pizza.  *Side note- isn't it cheaper to order a plain cheese pizza rather than a pepperoni pizza? My point exactly."
Sanjay D.,"Irvine, CA",199,44,35,5.0,5/31/2017,"One of our favorite dinner places in Irvine. We've already visited BJ's on Jamboree several times, and few times with my parents on select occasions. Today was no different. My father and mother gave a nice dinner party to their grandson Rohan for graduating with Aerospace Engineering degree from UT Austin and finding a great job at SpaceX. We enjoyed the hot appetizers (Fried Asparagus, Stuffed Mushrooms and Spinach/Artichoke dip) with shots of beer (whereas I don't drink, I saw that my family enjoyed the samples.) The food arrived quick, smelled great and was freshly prepared. The main course was even better... entrees ordered included Veggie Quinoa, Deep Dish Pizza, Penne Pasta, Tacos and Portobello Burger. Each entree was prepared well, served hot and tasted awesome! The pasta was just a bit heavy with red tomato sauce. We pretty much finished all our food except a couple of slices of pizza (which will make a nice lunch for one of us.) A trip to BJ's is never complete without the final guilty pleasure... I mean the Pizookie. We were so stuffed though... so we only ordered the mini-version for our parents. They loved it! We laughed, talked loudly, shared stories and just had a fun time. Look forward to our next BJ's outing in the future..."
Cindy S.,"Irvine, CA",262,314,603,3.0,4/3/2016,"bj's is predictable so a nice place to go for good bar food. pizza - check, wings - check, beer - check. pizza comes in 2 forms- deep dish and thin crust. we did the deep dish and it was good but heavy. I'd recommend thin crust; all the flavor without the guilt. the wings we did with the buffalo sauce on the side. this was a first at bj's but good. wings were crispy and much better without the sauce.  waitress was kind of clueless. let me give you a tip that could help you. if you want a good tip, don't tell people a girl's age!"
Eric C.,"Irvine, CA",37,62,13,1.0,8/30/2016,"So I feel really compelled to write this Review. I ordered curb side take away at 6pm for a Medium BJ Fav. Deep dish, Cobb Salad, and Bone In Lemon Flavor Wings.  I called and was put on hold for 10 minutes to take my order. Basically they forgot about me. I called back again and again they said "" Can you hold on for a moment""? I mentioned I was on hold for a very long time. So they took my order. First mistake. The lady on the phone was so out of this world, I had to literally spell out my order. I even asked her to repeat the order back.  Curb side take away, so the food was on time. The lady at the take out desk brought all my food. Even opened the pizza box which showed my pizza really fast. I asked again, "" Is this deep dish""? She replied, Yeah yeah, no problem deep dish. Second Mistake, trusting a BJ's employee who just wanted to get off work ASAP.  Came back home and opened all the food, cobb salad, regular NON Deep dish pizza, and some of the DRIEST CHICKEN NUGGETS ON THE PLANET.( no bone inn) I called to speak to the manager, THIRD MISTAKE. Lady on the phone replied"" Can you hold on for a second""? After holding for 7 minutes, FORGET IT. I'm through with BJS at Irvine Blvd/Jamboree.  To be fair, when I picked up my order. The place wasn't even busy at all. They really train their STAFF and Execute. WONT BE BACK."
