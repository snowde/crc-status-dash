Kevin J.,"Huntington Beach, CA",112,134,277,3.0,10/6/2016,"Came in for #nationalpizookieday the other night. If you spend $10, you can get whichever pizookie you want!! I haven't been to this location in years let alone a BJ's in general. This location is pretty big like most locations and has a lot of ""outdoor"" seating with televisions everywhere. I love how you can basically sit anywhere an at least see the screens. It's a great place to watch sports games on Thursday, Sunday, and Monday. I've been here in the past and all I can remember is that the beer is actually pretty good and the pizza is pretty average. I came in the other night and did not order either. Instead, I ordered a flat bread pizza because it was later at night and it seemed like a lighter options. We had the Italian pizza with sausage and peppers. It was pretty average just like the deep dish. It wasn't packed on with toppings and had a lot of crust. I probably wouldn't get it again. The highlight of the night was the free pizookie. I got the monkey pizookie with vanilla ice cream. This was actually really good. Instead of a cookie, it was a cinnamon bun that was nice and moist. I loved every bite of it and would totally order it again. Lastly, I thought the service was excellent. Our server brought me back refills without me even asking. Overall it was a good experience and I would come back again!"
John A.,"Santa Ana, CA",2,33,5,1.0,2/2/2017,"The worst service you can imagine. I work nearby and I regret every time I have come into this place. I usually say review the food, but I left after waiting 15 minutes to order."
Yvonne R.,"Irvine, CA",3,32,1,1.0,4/18/2017,"I've gone here at least 5x giving it a chance every time. From mistakes on order, being forgotten, long wait time and incorrect billing, my boyfriend and I previously went to catch a hockey game and ordered the pepperoni pizza deep dish. The server was incredibly helpful and friendly. However, I got food poisoning and within hours of eating had the worst sickness I've felt from a restaurant. Scary, so I won't be visiting this location again."
Diane W.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,5,,5.0,6/25/2017,"We had an awesome dinner at the Irvine BJ's.  Great service, great ambiance, great food.   Although we had provided our BJ reward # to the server, it didn't get entered in the system, and then we didn't ;eave the restaurant with the actual check #.  Called Howard, the manager, the next day and he went above and beyond to search for our check #, and then link it to our BJ reward #.  Howard -  THANKS for your extra care and concern. Also - kudos to Nick our server who also provided excellent service.  We were entertaining guest from out of town and everyone was pleased.   THANKS!"
Salina G.,"Tustin, CA",1078,48,1903,1.0,8/6/2016,I tried to mention the free appetizer with check in on Yelp and she changed subject and never brought it ?!
Dennis H.,"Irvine, CA",211,633,573,4.0,12/22/2015,"Oh man, I've been here over 30x and I didn't realize I never wrote a review. Well, my fav place to hang out during football season.  Find a boot in the bar area and kick back for the next 3 hours (or 6 :D )   BJ's food is good but nothing great.  BUT it keeps me coming back.  Some of my fav items (btw always happy hour when there's an NFL game) - Avocado Egg Rolls - Sliders - Brussels Sprouts (it's new) And of course the PIZZA!!  The flat bread pepperoni one is great if you don't want anything heavy.  But I say 80% of the time I'm getting deep dish.  Until recently I didn't know you could do a 50/50 on the deep dish meaning, a supreme on one half and cheese lovers on the other. Where have I been!??!! Drinks are great!  BJ's own brews are always good.  I particularly like their mixed beers like their Snake Bite which is half Guinness and half cider ale."
Lina S.,"Irvine, CA",4,28,10,1.0,8/3/2016,"Horrible experience today. We went to celebrate daughter's graduation. We ordered a salmon entree from Gluten free menu and told the waitress my husband is celiac, please make a note saying allergy. And we even asked the manager to take care of the order himself. Both waitress and manager promised there won't be any problem. After we ate half way, we were curious what kind of gluten free sauce made the meal tasted so good. Actually it alerted us. We asked the waitress to ask the chef what kind of sauce they put on the salmon and rice. Surprisingly and disappointedly enough, the kitchen messed up!!! They put the pasta contained rice pilaf in a gluten free dish!!!! We have been put Bj's as a regular eating out place just for their gluten free menu, this was really unacceptable!!  Please take every order seriously!!!!!"
Luis L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,10,,5.0,6/16/2017,"I jut finished having dinner with my dance team (our banquet for the end of the school year and performance year at UCI) and Mackenzie E. was absolutely amazing. She was beyond graceful, funny, had a real personality and I appreciated her service more than she knows (especially because I was a server too). She handled everyone's orders with such ease and brought me both my Pink Cadillac and White Peach margarita so quickly. The drinks were perfect. Not too much alcohol, just the right amount. I hope that the company really looks out for and appreciates the work Mackenzie does because if the job is draining on her, she doesn't show it one bit. Thank you again Mackenzie.  -Lulu (the guy with the purple hair at 88.9 FM)"
Ken C.,"Irvine, CA",194,38,79,3.0,11/8/2016,"I been here few times and realize this each time... the front staff needs to be more welcoming. When I walked in, no one greeted me and no one acknowledged  me or the two other people behind me. The delivery team were polite and did a great job but I think the server was just A ok. Not very engaging and helpful with our questions. I thought the food was a bit overpriced for what I received. Overall solid experience but could have been better."
Kenneth W.,"Irvine, CA",0,9,,5.0,5/27/2017,"Just enjoyed tonight's dinner at BJ's. The finicky kids always find something they like here. Food is as good as usual. But I want to give an extra kudos to our server, Justin. I left my credit card behind at the restaurant by accident, and Justin waved us down just as we were pulling out of the parking spot to return my credit card.  That's going above and beyond!  So thank you Justin!!!  I hope management recognizes you for your outstanding service!  Will be back here soon!"
Emilio D.,"Tustin, CA",23,8,4,1.0,5/26/2017,"Came here for dinner with my wife. Friday, 9pm. Waited a few minutes then we were shown to our table.  Then we just sat there for TWENTY MINUTES and no one came to serve us. NOT A SINGLE PERSON. Finally we got up and walked out, to Lazy Dog Cafe next door.  Before leaving I made sure to let the manager know what happened and he just shrugged it off. Never coming here again."
Bob R.,"Irvine, CA",2,26,6,2.0,12/7/2015,"It use to be my favorite to spot heading home. No more great happy hour. The bartenders aren't happy, customers including me are not. Prices are alot higher as an example my chicken wings (5) were $4 until 7 pm now are $11.95 with 10. Beer is $1.00 off. I walked in tonight with Monday night football normally packed. I had a choice of 7 seats in front of TV screens. The regular customers I see nearby at Dave's BBQ and Islands which have great beer prices and better food choices also until 7 pm. I use to come here 5-7 times per month. Now it will be once at best only because of great bartenders.  My suggestion switch back. Whoever made these changes at corporate needs a course in what brings crowds to a once great restaurant. I know blame it on Donald Bren, but this income level has to be dropping.     Bob"
Faud H.,"Costa Mesa, CA",49,63,30,3.0,7/24/2016,The food is inconsistent & not too GR8. But this is one of the bigger BJ's and have a nice bar & patio area.
John B.,"Tustin, CA",80,1,,5.0,1/22/2017,The tvs have issues during rain.   We had to go next door to watch the playoffs on the same satalite channel because bjs tvs were out.
Ariana R.,"Anaheim, CA",87,234,163,3.0,11/4/2015,"Came here last Friday. I absolutely love Bj's. But food is below standard now. Major love/hate relationship. I wish the pizza's were more flexible-like a build your own on the ""speciality"" line of pizzas they have; but not cost $20. Pizookies and beer are always solid.  Bathrooms very very very dirty. Let's get it together people."
Lyndsi B.,"Costa Mesa, CA",0,3,,3.0,10/29/2016,We have visited a number of bjs locations in the past few years but this was our first time at this location.   We were not impressed and will not be returning.    Many staff members were standing around doing nothing even though the restaurant was clearly needing to be serviced.   They took over 30 minutes to bring out three meals and forgot to bring my side of toast.  They finally brought it out as I was finishing the rest of my meal.
Sarah K.,"Orange, CA",0,63,5,3.0,3/25/2017,Bjs is always packed but the food quality is better than bar food quality and the menu is giant so it keeps me coming back. The biggest highlight of bjs is for sure the pazooki ( a giant cookie baked in a cast iron skillet) which is always the perfect way to end a meal!
Scott H.,"Tustin, CA",128,4,,1.0,6/30/2016,"Went for my dad's birthday (6/28), he had a terrible time. He ordered the salmon grilled, they brought it out blackened. No big deal, they said they would bring him another. The rest of us are eating our meals while my dad is eating his veggies and baked potato as his salmon is being prepared. His salmon comes, it's completely raw in the middle, sushi raw. How do you mess up twice on one person's order? Manager comes to speak to us, this guy is the most socially awkward person I've seen manage a restaurant. He doesn't understand the scenario prior to arriving to the table, and just thought my dad ordered the wrong thing, then laughs when he hears what happened. Didn't apologize about the restaurant ruining his birthday dinner, just says the salmon would be taken off the bill. Obviously it's taken off the bill, he never got the salmon! There was absolutely no point for him coming to the table, he did nothing productive.  I actually never complain at restaurants, nor do I write bad reviews, but this is an exception. My dad went home hungry on his birthday, great job BJ's."
Nili H.,"Irvine, CA",0,24,1,5.0,8/31/2017,"Excellent food and beer can only be framed by fantastic service offered by Nick whose natural ability to make you feel fully cared for after a long day at work makes a memorable night on a Thursday. This is a chain restaurant but is ran like a neighborhood joint. I first tried this place because of my company's Christmas party. Now My friends and I love coming here with friends for their great customer service, thin slice pizza and it's proximity to work. I will definitely come back here with my friends."
Marjorie N.,"Corona, CA",101,314,30,3.0,7/25/2016,"Service was, eh. We came late on a Saturday night for a ""small"" dinner and but mostly beer for hubby. Hostess said our wait would be 15 minutes which surprised me because there were quite a few people waiting before us. Thankfully it was more like 20. Anyway, our waitress was nice enough. She took our drink and dinner order promptly. We shared a small California pizza. My husband had three of their different beers that he didn't care for. Waitress wasn't very helpful in suggesting anything. As soon as he stopped drinking beer during our dinner, her visits to the table to check up on us were much less frequent. Had to ask her to refill my water a couple of times. Thankful that I decided to check reviews here and saw there was a coupon for a free app or pizookie. We were able to end the dinner on a good note because that was delicious."
