Michelle T.,"Sunnyvale, CA",480,472,701,2.0,8/28/2015,"Came here with a party of 10-12 ish. It was a while ago, so I forgot. It was around dinner time on a weekend, so the place was packed. s We all ordered appetizers, drinks, and entrees. They brought out small plates for us so we could use them for the complementary bread and butter. First time they brought the plates out. Dirty. Ew. Requested newer and cleaner plates. 2nd sets of plates come out. Dirty again. Ok, nasty. I am barfing up my insides.  If these plates aren't clean, then I have a feeling all their other utensils, plates, bowls, glasses are just as dirty. Most definitely not coming back here. Now for the food. Honestly, I wouldn't recommend coming here unless you want some pizza. The pizza is good, but everything else is meh and mediocre. BJ's is known for their pizookies, but c'mon people! You're just paying for convenience, as you can buy a dozen cookies and a gallon of ice cream for probably cheaper."
Kate K.,"Orange, CA",55,26,1,1.0,5/9/2016,"I won't be going back to this location again. We went for Mother's Day and surprisingly, were seated in less than 10 minutes (for a group of 6)! The food was decent and our server was great. We paid and left. Great. The next day, my fiancé checked his bank account and noticed he had been charged twice. The first time was at the time we were in the restaurant, but the second time was almost 3 hours after we had left!  My fiancé went back to BJ's the next day to speak to the manager. He said she couldn't have cared less. She took the receipt and went in the back and did who knows what. She finally came back and said oops, yeah, you got charged twice. You'll have a refund in a few days, bye! What kind of service is that? First of all, how does a card get double charged...HOURS apart? Did someone there take the credit card info down, then run it again hours later? The manager offered no explanation for what happened. She was unapologetic and completely unconcerned. Definitely won't be back."
K K.,"Irvine, CA",2,28,,2.0,7/2/2016,"Not the BJ's it used to be. I used to come here very often back when food and service was actually solid. Portions used to be very generous too; avocado egg rolls used to be so big one would get me satisfied. Now, they're tiny and obviously unsatisfying. Service used to be very attentive and enthusiastic but I don't sense that anymore. This place is going downhill slowly. Careful BJs. Lazy Dog next door is booming with customers all the time. If I were the manager, I'd take these negative reviews very seriously. I already know a few people who don't go to BJs anymore and prefer to head over to Lazy Dog instead."
Milee S.,"Irvine, CA",296,1096,510,4.0,10/21/2015,"I think BJ's has a love/hate relationship with patrons. Either you love it or hate it. I really enjoy BJ's. It seems to please all palates, the beverage list is great, and the food is filling. Plus, how can you pass up a Pizookie? I have been here a ton of times, so my review is not specific to one visit. I've had reasonable to outstanding service, and when something just didn't come out right, the manager has turned it around.  I tend to favor the bison burger or the deep dish mini veggie pizza. I find the small is good enough to share so I've done that with a salad.  Keeps the costs and calories low. But they do have great burgers, pasta dishes, soups, combo plates and fantastic calamari.  If I'm drinking, I like the Berry Burst. I will say the Bloody Mary is a go-to. There are usually large groups of high school students dining here on weekends, or families celebrating birthdays so beware of that.  Parking is easy and they have a membership card, so get those points to get the free Pizookie!"
Grant V.,"Irvine, CA",5,119,23,3.0,2/24/2017,Food is ok. Beer is good and pretty much the only reason you come here. Pizza was average. Chicken wings were average. They were out of the daily special at 7 pm. Pazookie is always good.
Hannah M.,"Village of Oak Creek, AZ",12,17,11,1.0,6/25/2016,Very disappointed in the service from the second we walked in. I started out as a hostess and moved my way up to waitress so I know how important it is to properly greet guests at the front. We didn't even stay 30 seconds. We walked in and there was a hostess and a waitress and both of them gave us dirty looks and had major attitude. We didn't get any greeting when we walked in the door. They actually said nothing they just looked at us until we asked for a table for four. We spoke to the manager briefly and he didn't seem to care enough to keep our service so we left and went to Famous Dave's next door. Much better choice!  This place needs a serious re-haul of front of house staff! I'll be sending a letter to corporate.
Matt R.,"San Clemente, CA",141,85,25,1.0,4/28/2016,"NOPE!  Literally sat here for almost ten minutes whilst several servers walked past us.  We weren't even acknowledged or looked at, none us given and not even an ""I'll be right with you.""   We just got up and walked out and across the road to Lazy Fog Cafe. Sorry BJs.  You lost paying customers forever with this."
Jackie D.,"Irvine, CA",2,94,3,5.0,2/12/2017,"It's the best BJ's in OC because management will ALWAYS make things right if the service is not excellent. We have been here for office parties, huge super bowl take outs, dine in, etc. and the food and service met our expectations every time. They offer a party take out @ $130, which includes 2 pizzas, chicken wing or strips, salad, and another appetizer for 10 ppl. An extra star for their rewards program and the BJs AP - very easy to use."
Janice O.,"Irvine, CA",28,142,76,3.0,12/27/2015,"Food- 2 1/2 stars  First time at BJ's with my boyfriend. It was okay. Let's just say that I expected more.. Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing. We got the calamari appetizer, sirloin steak with the clam chowder & rice pilaf, mini BJ's pizza, and the chicken Alfredo.  The calamari was just your basic calamari with marinara and tartar sauce.  Steak was soft and good, but the rice pilaf tasted frozen and kinda gross along with the clam chowder that was not even hot and way too salty.  BJ's mini pizza. I was so disappointed.  And my boyfriend's chicken Alfredo was sooo undercooked. We were starving and didn't want to send it back cuz it would take too long and we had to go.  I would give BJ's another chance but hopefully this time, we order the right things."
Bruce K.,"Tustin, CA",66,64,35,5.0,8/11/2016,"It's always a pleasure coming here. The servers are amazingly nice and great. They do their best to serve you well. The pizzas are great there!  The place is pricey for a well rounded restaurant. But dates are a must here because they absolutely have the best dessert. Their pazookies are to die for! They're amazingly delicious with the warmth of the cookie and cold vanilla ice cream, with whip cream is incredible.  Update: I waited 20 minutes just for someone to take my order. I've had many waiters/waitresses come by past me and my friend. I am giving 3 stars because I'm nice and patient. (I'm also tilted)  Update 2.0: Same visit, I changed it to 5 stars because the waitress is a Harry Potter fan. Also she gave us a free appetizer."
Banoo F.,"Irvine, CA",1,11,3,1.0,5/14/2016,"9:30 pm on Sunday ,when we came in the hostess was chit chatting with the other coworker, didn't even ask us if we want to be seated, sure enough I asked them if I need to be seated .what I received was ruling eyes. Great!!! Waitress took forever to come back after she brought us water ,to take the order ...really???"
Melissa S.,"Irvine, CA",0,4,,5.0,3/22/2017,The food is AMAZING! i go at least once a month because i need a pizookie every now and then. The employees are incredibly nice and helpful when it comes to selecting a food entree.
Christina D.,"Irvine, CA",9,48,245,5.0,8/28/2015,To corporate: let people order off menu items like the artichoke spinach again. It's our favorite pizza and half the reason we come to bjs (the other half is pizookies) To Donna: thanks for being awesome and getting your managers to let us order our favorite pizza even though it's some new rule that we shouldn't be able to. That's great customer service. To hostess: thank you for changing our seat. We hate to be that person but that corner seat sucks (we also saw 3 other couples ask to move so we know everyone hates that seat lol)
Silvia G.,"Orange County, CA",635,672,3264,3.0,9/9/2014,"I've only been to BJ's when it's been suggested by friends or like last weekend, we went to redeem a gift card we got years ago. I've had the pizza and its not bad but not something I'd crave. This time I decided to try the Honey lime Scallops and unfortunately couldn't find anything positive about it.  Scallops were seared to the point they looked a bit burnt. Rice was bland. The asparagus were just old and chewy. After combining the sauce with the rice, it was more flavorful but the sauce was too peppery. To top it off, my strawberry lemonade was too sour and my free salted caramel pizookie (free if you sign up to their rewards) was toooo sweet. The ice cream was ok but the cookie portion was packed with sugar (and I have a sweet tooth too!!!) I'd give them 2.5 stars for the food I had but our server was nice and attentive (refilling my lemonade before I asked, etc) so I'll round it up to 3. Sorry BJ's, unless we get another gift card, I wont be seeing you soon."
Stacy F.,"Chino, CA",0,10,5,1.0,4/16/2016,"Absolutely HORRIBLE!  No words can explain how unorganized, dirty and just rude servers. We waited 30 minutes to be seated at what was the smallest table! Our appetizer came out with our main meals appetizer was cold. Our spoons knives and forks all dirty I washed them myself in water. They messed up our bill adding 10$ for no reason. Waited another 20 minutes to find our server to fix the bill. We finally left FINALLY and now my husband has food poisoning he had a glazed salmon. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!!"
Christina M.,"Hillsboro, OR",22,393,745,4.0,11/9/2015,"BJ's is a great place to come watch a sporting event. I really enjoy their deep dish pizzas and they have an excellent chicken fettuccine alfredo. The fettuccine alfredo has been hit or miss as of late but when it's on, it is very good and is my favorite place to get that dish from. I highly recommend ordering the root beer to complement whatever entree you decide on. The service really varies depending on who your server is. We have had excellent service on some visits and during others it seemed like the waiter / waitress forgot we were there. This location does tend to get quite busy, especially if there is a big game on. You can call ahead to put your name on the wait list or add it online. It's nice to not need a reservation way in advance but still be able to reduce the amount of time spent waiting at the restaurant. 4 stars."
Casey T.,"Irvine, CA",169,40,72,4.0,5/5/2016,What's not to like. Came in on a double date and were seated in a very timely manner.  Our server was rather new. She was still being trained with another server but she did an awesome job.  We ordered the avocado egg rolls to start and devoured those hot delicious beauties quickly.  We then ordered a great white pizza and it was sooo good. I might order thin crust next time because they're so huge and bready a bit more than I like but I still loved the flavor of the pizza.  Ad to end our meal was the always amazing Chocolate Chip PAZOOKI!!! I love it and will be back for another very soon!
Bri S.,"Buena Park, CA",219,5,,5.0,2/9/2017,"Came on a Thursday night. We were seated right away. Jennifer greeted us not really knowing if we were her table, but she noticed we hadn't been greeted. She apologized for the wait and took amazing care of us for the rest of our visit. Very personable, attentive to detail, extremely nice. Clean restaurant. Wish we lived closer so we could visit more often, but we will be back if we're ever in the area."
Natasha N.,"Orange County, CA",874,324,3683,4.0,5/8/2014,"My boy friend got together about over 20 of my friends to surprise me at Bj's Restaurant & Brewhouse on my birthday. I was totally thrown off and thought we came here to say happy birthday to one of his guy friends. I was in total shock when I saw my friends *TEARS* and very amazed how they all kept quiet for a WHOLE month! You guys are awesome!!! :D  Our party was sat out in the patio area with two long tables side by side. It was easy enough for me to migrate back and forth to each table to chit chat with my buddies. The service was amazing for us and they made sure that everyone placed their order, got their order, and came back to make sure if anyone needed anything else. They also gave me a pizookie for my birthday (: and was searching for my cake, but we were holding it already (haha).  Food I've ordered in the past:  Avocado Egg Rolls - so crunchy and tasty!!! Totally recommended!  BBQ Chicken pizza - delicious! great combo with the bbq sauce and chicken (they are known for their pizzas)  Mediterranen Pizza - very interesting and exotic type of pizza  Food we ordered on my birthday:  Pork Chops - the meat was so soft and the potatoes were so creamy and buttery  Jalapeno Burger - super yummy! if you are into jalapenos then this burger is for you! Calamari - super crunchy and the squid taste perfect!  Pizza  (others got many options) to share with each other) - usually very good!  Fettuccine Alfredo - my best guy friend said it was delicious  The Jambalaya Pasta - couple of friends ate this dish and they said they really enjoyed it  Drinks: Adios my friend - it is exactly what it sounds like! ahahah Buhh Byeee to meehhh! Island Sunset  - it is almost like another version of a Long Island (:   Overall, this is one of the top birthday events I ever had! Thanks Bj's, my boyfriend, and my friends for making this wonderful event happen!! :D"
Jeff G.,"Tustin, CA",40,55,30,4.0,7/25/2016,A great place for a quick bite or a casual lunch. The appetizers are highly shareable and delicious. Wash it all down with a craft beer.
