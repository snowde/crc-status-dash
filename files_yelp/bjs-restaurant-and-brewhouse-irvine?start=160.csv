Val S.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,34,6,1.0,4/22/2016,"This place was exquisitely bad. First they handed us a pager for when our table was ready, pretty normal. But when it went off they had us get in a line with a bunch of other people whose pagers went off, which defeats the purpose. We didn't have utensils for the first 30 min. The whole thing took over 2hrs. The boneless wings did not taste like chicken, more like a mix of plastic and some sea creature you aren't supposed to eat. The deep dish pizza was basically a pile of wet bread with almost no sauce and glue like cheese. The corndogs were burnt on the outside and raw dough on the inside. My baked potato was gray and slimy. Seriously how do you mess up a baked potato? All it takes is an oven and a potato! The sliders were sickly sweet and the buns looked like they had been colored with a yellow highlighter. The queso was fuzzy. That's the only way to describe it, a fuzzy texture in your mouth. Even the fries were weird. Who leaves most of their fries uneaten? That never happens, but at this place it did. Afterwards all of us felt ill. Gordon Ramsay would have dropped F bombs in all directions here. We should have know after seeing the huge and confusing menu. Potstickers and jambalaya and pizza and pasta and burgers and seafood. This place has no idea who it is. It's searching or itself on a long road trip across America and making bad decisions in bars. Do yourself a favor, skip this place."
Anthony D.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",15,40,37,5.0,5/23/2017,"Oh BJs...  How I've loved to hate you at times; due to inconsistent service at several locations throughout southern Cali. But not last night. I was LITERALLY blown away by the service we received. I rarely walk into retail or restaurants within 30 min of closing, simply because I know how one or two tables straggling in late can slow down the closing process. I confess I was that guy last night, coming in late and sitting at the bar already having my order ready when the server came by to grab our waters. ( my GO-TO: buffalo chicken deep dish, no celery, no onion ). I could tell the gentlemen taking care of us might have been a bit tired after a long slow shift however that did not stop him from flashing a welcoming smile and going above and beyond with waiting on our table. He was stealthy on our H2O refills without us even having to ask or do the casual ""look around for your server cause I'm getting thirsty"" neck turn lol. He didn't seem bothered by simple requests like more buffalo sauce on the side or extra lemon for my glass of water. The pizza hit the spot as always and he made sure that we were 100% satisfied with the meal. We ended up scarfing our meals down before they even hit closing time which was perfect seeing how the dining room/bar was still 25% full at the time we left. Couldn't have been more happy with the quick bite to eat and great service we encountered. I gladly tipped our server 75% because give credit when credit is due should be practiced more often in food&beverage business'. I threw away my receipt so I will update this review with the great servers name for any of you fellow yelpers looking to get the best BJs experience in the good ole OC. ( server: tall gentlemen, clean cut, with a few small arm tats). ILL BE BACK"
Taehee Y.,"Santa Ana, CA",1,3,,2.0,10/15/2016,"My family and I have been going to BJs for many years and it has been an enjoyable place to eat and just spend time with family. However, our most recent experience has broken this perfect image of BJs due to the impolite and insensitive behavior of our waiter. The waiter was very rude with her actions and seemed to be trying to do the least amount of work possible. She was extremely hasty and rudely commented back as we asked a question. Every year we go to BJs bringing our family and friends with higher expectations knowing our service will be ecstatic. But, due to this one experience I think it will be hard to think of BJs as the once welcoming place it once was."
McKenna F.,"Berkeley, CA",172,4,,2.0,10/16/2016,"Came here a few weeks ago for snacks and dessert for my birthday after receiving terrible service at another restaurant. We ordered a few snacks and the pizookie platter which were all delicious. Our waitress, however, could not have cared less about our table. We watched her talk to another table, possibly with people she knew, almost the entire time we were there. She never came to check on us. At one point my friend's phone slipped between two pieces of the booth seat and could not get it out. We asked her for help while she was still taking her table, and instead of helping, she says ""hold on, I have another table to check on"" and walks to the table right next to us to ask them how they're doing! Meanwhile, we're taking apart the booth seat to attempt to retrieve the phone. Unreal. Food was fine. Service was terrible."
Thao P.,"Irvine, CA",0,8,,3.0,2/14/2017,We waited a long time to get our food and Jennifer our waitress was kind enough to recognize this.  She brought Caitlyn the manager out even though it was a special valentines dinner for my family nothing else was offered accept an apology.   Jennifer came out and took the initiative to make things better and for that I am grateful.  It really is not about anything other than recognizing the shortcomings and doing something about it.  Thank you to the best server at BJ's!   P.S.  In all fairness when the manager Caitlyn heard that the pizza was cold she came out and took care of the dessert that Jennifer offered.   My compliments on the teamwork.
Nijole T.,"Los Angeles, CA",3080,6372,5149,2.0,5/2/2015,"There is really too much great food in the area to end up at BJ's. That being said I still did and was not really thrilled about it. Full, noisy, overworked staff that got my order wrong. It took so long to flag her down and let her know I was over ordering something else. I had some of the pizzas we ordered for the table and they were fine. Nothing stellar, pretty pricey for the quality and there would be a ton of places I would rather go for pizza. Location is nice, but filling it this much with people really ruins being able to have a descent conversation. Not horrible, but I wouldn't bother coming back."
Erika R.,"Orange County, CA",108,201,604,1.0,5/9/2015,"Came back again after 2 years since my last review only because 11 of my family members wanted to come here AND a few of them were from out of the country. Unfortunately, my previous 1 star experience still stands.  LONG STORY SHORT: Conveniently, the 1 person who paid with a $100 bill didn't receive his $80 in change at the end of the night. Everyone -with the exception of him- was personally handed their check inside a black book. Our server, Devin B, claimed that she left it on the table and had the nerve to say, ""Maybe one of you guys took it!"" Rude! After my aunt explained the situation to the manager, he went to investigate and came back rather quickly with $80 in cash and stated that Devin didn't have any extra money on her. Suuuuuuuure!  Now, not only are my bf and I FOR DAMN SURE not coming back, neither is my family! Adios again, BJ's!! =]"
Cheyne T.,"Tustin, CA",1069,763,281,3.0,3/10/2016,"Their actual food is just okay, I usually stick with their deep dish pizzas because those are decently good. Most of the time I just come here to get their famous pizookies for dessert! It's not listed on their main menu, but you can order a mini size for about $3 if you can't finish the regular size. Also you can split two flavors in one pizookie. Customer service isn't the best, but I don't really expect it here I guess. Be sure to sign up for their rewards app program so you can earn points towards redeeming rewards!"
Gabriela S.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",49,288,1169,4.0,9/21/2015,For once we had a great waiter who was enthusiastic and on a top of things as well as flexible with some food substitutions. The Bison Burger is always fantastic and the chicken Mediterranean pitas were great as well. I do wish they had more bottle beer choices (import) as not everyone likes brewery heavy beers and their light beer is like watered down ale. I do have to say that the hostess should either start taking some happy pills or change her profession- she was so miserable and unfriendly that if it wasn't for already being 2pm and us needing to eat before heading up to Pasadena I would have gone someplace else. How can you have a front person with such a lack of customer service?
Kenji U.,"Irvine, CA",3,47,81,3.0,7/3/2016,Food is good but pretty pricey. I usually just come when my girlfriend wants dessert. The pizookies are pretty good but pretty heavy on the sugar side. One of those restaurants you'd go out to on a special day when you want something fancy. Try it out!
Jessie L.,"Sacramento, CA",56,110,125,5.0,10/2/2015,"My favorite BJ's! If you are a beer fan, try the Jeremiah Red. It is tastey! The parking here is decent. Haven't not waited to be seated when coming to any BJs, unless we snag a random bar seat or we have call ahead with large groups. I don't mind the wait since I love their food. Rarely get a bad server. We did get one girl here with a big group once.  She had a huge attitude and was very rude. Not to worry she got the tip she deserved. Nonetheless the service is good 99% of the time. I must say there are a few things here I secretly desire like always. The tomato mozzarella small bite, the sweet pig deep dish (droooool), the pazookis, and their beer on draft. My counterpart part can't help but order the black n blue burger everytime. He says it's hit or miss with how well the do the blackened part, but still says it's good nonetheless. Attributes: plenty of Tvs with games on, good for loud parties, large parties, vegan/veggie friendly options, best pizzzzza, beer on tap, easy to find location.  I recommend all day long."
Kayla H.,"Garden Grove, CA",32,54,234,3.0,6/6/2016,Food was decent. Came out in a timely manner. -2 stars is because our waiter forgot to give us utensils. It was a bit of a wait for them. She didn't even bother to give it to us I had to ask the lady who came out with our food.
Henna K.,"Irvine, CA",0,4,,1.0,4/30/2017,"We used to love coming here - we would come at least once a month. We had a horrible experience at our last visit. I don't know if we will be going back here. The food is great, service is TERRIBLE. It shouldn't take more than 10 minutes to get your menu or for any of the waiters to recognize that you are there. I don't recommend going here if you are looking for excellent service that will get your check correct and won't overcharge you."
Rick M.,"Tustin, CA",46,8,13,4.0,1/25/2017,"This BJ's  (Irvine) was very good tonight. I ate their Shrimp & Asparagus Penne, it was delicious! My wife had their Roasted Salmon Quinoa Bowl and loved it as well. Good food, Good service, Good time."
Jonathan S.,"Irvine, CA",1,27,1,1.0,1/6/2017,"**Not a place to bring your family - unless they all drink and love to be loud** My wife and I were having a casual date night on a Friday. Place was fairly crowded and we felt fortunate to get a seat in their extended seating area. Soon after sitting down we didn't feel that way though. An entire area of the seating section was dedicated to a group of about 20 people who were doing shots and other libations all while screaming and laughing - playing their drinking game I guess.  There were families with children around us and you could see the discomfort on the parents faces. It was useless for my wife and I to try to have a conversation over our dinner because it was so loud.  As we were preparing to pay and get out of there we asked if the manager was available to talk with and draw his attention to this issue. After giving him our feedback he was ambivalent in his response. I think his calculation was this is a group of 20, paying top price for each of their drinks, 2 customers don't matter.   So sad, I liked BJs until I talked with the uncaring manager."
Susan G.,"Santa Ana, CA",40,24,,4.0,2/2/2017,"Although I hate to write reviews regarding chain restaurants the Ahi salad is pretty darn good, tasty fresh and served quickly. Lunch is busy but still was served quickly."
Kaila K.,"Irvine, CA",14,78,55,3.0,5/14/2016,"Good food bad service. Receiptionist Stephanie was the worst, very rude and straight up blew me off when i asked her how long the wait would be"
Stephanie A.,"Irvine, CA",19,44,,1.0,12/19/2016,"They sent me a promotion for 1/2 off ur 1st delivery so I was happy to try it. The food came cold. When I called to complain, the mgr said that it was because of the cold weather & that they didn't have warming bags to deliver with.  I'm guessing that if ur going to enter the delivery market, u should get the rt equipment to keep food warm. I waited for the mgr to apologize but she never did. Do not get food delivered from bj's unless u r ok w warming ur food at home."
Corey E.,"Lakewood, CA",188,200,330,4.0,6/7/2015,This is the perfect place to come for a nice night out with the family or to watch the game. The atmosphere here is awesome and the food is great. I had the deep dish Mediterranean pizza and it was awesome. They have a nice selection of draft beers and a full bar. What will really get you in trouble are the nice desserts. I highly recommend this place.
Alisha G.,"Holladay, UT",25,28,12,1.0,10/31/2016,"The WORST!!!! Our server was barely present, we asked for an extra spoon and waited almost 15 minutes, our soup became cold and when we asked for it to be reheated waited 20 minutes (Clam Chowder was overly thickened with flour and had a floral hint to it, Calamari was under fried and oily, too much sugar in the tartar sauce which is a sign of it being jarred, the pizza...ALL DOUGH...it was way to processed) !!! The restaurant and bar are far from crowded so there was no reason for the unprofessional service. Oh well...next time I want to go out I will avoid coming here and suggest you do too."
