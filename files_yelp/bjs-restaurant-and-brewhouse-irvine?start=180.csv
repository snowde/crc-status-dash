Tienanh C.,"Costa Mesa, CA",14,38,12,2.0,3/9/2016,"If it's your first time here, be prepared to do some reading...their menu is a book!   I've heard many times that they're known for their pizza, but I just don't have enough time over lunch to wait for the pizza.  After realizing that I've spent way too much time going through the menu, I settled on ordering the Salmon, which was good, but the portion was not very filling.   We also ordered the artichoke dip, which was good, but not anything spectacular.  So for the food, overall, it was just okay.  Maybe I should have tried the pizza. The pricing for a place like this was not out of line...I just expected a bit more food for what I paid.   The service was fine.  Food came out in a timely manner.  Server came to check on us routinely.   I probably would not come back here, unless I was meeting someone else for lunch.  It's not that the place was so bad, but more so that there were plenty of other restaurants around (some of which I've been to and had a much better experience)."
Aaron C.,"Irvine, CA",0,39,1,3.0,12/4/2016,"I love the fact they serve breakfast. Always a seat and you can watch the early games. Good service. Good management. Only downside is every time I order eggs over easy the eggs are cooked too hard and the bacon is over cooked. They need to monitor the cooking time. Please change this and I will keep coming but if I have to send the eggs back again, I will need to go elsewhere."
Mahesh S.,"Irvine, CA",807,382,260,3.0,2/26/2016,"Its always a hit or miss at this place. but I go here for the deep dish buffalo chicken pizza which is my absolute favorite, and for the pizookie, so the service never bothers me. They can smile a little more, and ask if you need water or something a few extra time, or bring the salsa before you finish your food, but oh well. just dont get any complicated order beyond getting a pizza, and you will be fine!  and note to self: dont order the steak here. take your $$ and go to TAPS next door. your money mind and wallet will thank you!"
Patrick A.,"Anaheim, CA",7,284,58,3.0,4/11/2016,"Stopped in here before a basketball game down at the terrible MMTSC down the road and enjoyed an appetizer and beer at the bar.  Great selection of beers, Masters on TV and friendly people working and hanging out.  It was one of the better experiences I've had at a BJ's bar."
Jodie L.,"Orange, CA",0,29,2,4.0,6/11/2017,Good service and good pizza.  Save room for a pizookie as dessert.  The chocolate chip flavor pizookie is definitely tasty!
Paul L.,"Orange County, CA",32,74,8,1.0,1/14/2016,"I've been to this establishment 3 times. Each time, my experience would get worse and worse. Just recently, the 3rd time was it. I obtained food poisoning the first time, negligent service the 2nd time and 3rd, rude and unprofessional treatment from the general manager.  I wont go in detail about the lack of treatment in this review, but no one should be belittled by the manager or anyone for that matter.  I suggest if you had to to talk to a manager, suck it up and leave or dont bother talking to them."
Jessica D.,"Irvine, CA",0,4,3,1.0,8/9/2016,"I like this restaurant, but today, my friends and I were sitting on the patio and our waiter tried to pick up too many items at once, dropping several glasses of water and drenching me and the two people beside me, and also my entire purse. Accidents happen but he didn't even try to comp us for anything when we were clearly scrambling to dry ourselves and I was wringing out things in my purse to dry everything. It was so baffling to me how strange the situation was and how the waiter so easily made the damage he caused seem like no big deal."
Mike C.,"Irvine, CA",5,3,2,5.0,2/29/2016,"Really happy with the re-introduction of thin fries to the menu here. Also, the aluminum plate style for this burger is excellent. Allowed me to spread patty juice all over the place and not feel like I had to keep it contained to a restaurant style plate. As always, bar service from excellent bartenders like Lisa was perfect and I can't recommend happy hour here enough!"
Heather W.,"Anaheim, CA",162,50,7,4.0,10/30/2016,My fiancé and I came here today to watch some football and get some lunch for our anniversary. Our waitress was Julia and she was super sweet. If you're looking for somewhere relaxing to watch football I would definitely recommend this place. We had the rootbeer wings for the first time and they were amazing!!! We will be back.
Vinnie N.,"Huntington Beach, CA",468,368,82,1.0,1/20/2015,"Chain restaurants are disgusting in general and BJ's is no different. It tries to be hip and cutting edge but everything on the menu screams mid-west. As in it only seems novel to those who live in a one horse town. So if Olive Garden is your idea of a fancy Italian dinner then BJ's is the place for you! This review is only based on the food as the service I usually receive here is decent or good.  Happy hour prices and menu is decently priced but again, all the menu items are forgettable.  I eat here for the same reason I eat at TGI Fridays, to remind myself of what horrible, boring food tastes like."
Michael T.,"Foothill Ranch, CA",348,216,562,4.0,12/8/2014,"This high-volume BJs is always busy, so it is usually loud and crowded.  The staff does an excellent job handling the chaos. I've had multiple lunch meetings here without any incident.  Keep in mind, it isn't the quietest place but it is clean and the service is usually good. The food so far has also been great. If you know BJs, you know they have great options for whatever you might be in the mood for. Just thinking about it makes me hungry!"
Adithi R.,"Tustin, CA",2,15,1,5.0,11/3/2016,I love BJ's I go here all the time with my family. The waiters and customer service is nice and also the food is amazing I would recommend this place. Only negative is that it is a little pricey. But other than that great. Try their pasookie
Jacqueline R.,"Los Angeles, CA",2491,927,2572,4.0,10/31/2013,"I had an INCREDIBLE experience when I dined here a few days ago! I've been to my fair share of BJ's locations, and they've all been pretty mediocre. However, I came to this location with my boyfriend this past weekend and had by far probably the best time I've ever had at a BJ's. It was pretty packed because it was the night of some local high school dance, and annoying super dressed up teenagers were all over the place in their 20+ people parties. I thought it was going to take us FOREVER to get seated, but it only took us five minutes (basically the whole time I spent using the bathroom LOL).  Then, the seating hostess originally took us to a table that's located in the back section of the restaurant that is in this echo-y, different room where they had basically seated all of the loud and obnoxious teenagers. As soon as I saw that we were being seated there, I felt uneasy and was already regretting it. Either me and the seating hostess had telepathy or she could just see the expression on my face, but she then asked us if we wanted to wait for a table inside, far away from the teenagers. We said yes, and she took us back inside and was able to find us another table to sit at which was MUCH better. Once we were seated, we were immediately greeted by our hostess who was very attentive and friendly. She took our orders and it literally took like...10 minutes to get all of our food. With the restaurant being super busy, my boyfriend and I was very surprised that our pizza came out speedily!  The only reason why I give this restaurant 4/5 stars is because we had ordered regular sized pizookies, and the ones we ended up getting were the small sized. However, we were not charged for the full size, so it was ok. Good job, BJ's! This might be my new favorite location."
John K.,"Newport Beach, CA",26,21,33,5.0,11/13/2016,just like another bjs like anywhere else. but the service speed here seems faster and friendlier than others. also for reservations make sure you got min. of 6 or more in a party. great job guys keep it up. ***why are there so many upset people here.. i swear people are just too crazy into writing bad reviews like there some kind of big shot restarant reviewers.. also if writing a bad review write the pros and cons and how others might benefit from your visit.. if only they knew how hard it is to run a restaurant.. they would have some sympathy for the owners and staffs.
Weon L.,"Irvine, CA",83,96,2050,4.0,2/15/2015,"BJ is chain restaurant which is famous for handcraft beers from light to dark. If you want to find best one, you can try to order sampler to drink several kinds of beers at the same time. At this time of night, we tried to drink Hefeweizen, Jeremiah Red and Light Lager. For appetizers, we ordered Avocado Egg Rolls,   Thai Shrip Lettuce Wraps,  Crispy Calamari,Nachos,Chicken Wings ,  Pizza etc. Most of them are delicious and good match with beers. There are indoor and outdoor place to drink,  so it is spacious for a lot of people. It is good place to watch sports and  drink handcraft beers together."
Jan B.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,8,,1.0,11/26/2016,"Ordered the monkey bread pazooki to go, hold the ice cream.  Imagined how disappointed I was when I got the container home, opened it, and found almost rock hard pieces of monkey bread, REALLY?  I had a flat bread appitizer, avocado, tomatoes, chicken (maybe?) and a spinach salad, both were VERY good.  Don't order the monkey bread pazooki, GROSS!"
C C.,"Costa Mesa, CA",1,18,,2.0,11/26/2016,Ordered takeout yesterday and the toppings were minimal on both pizzas we ordered. The pepperoni large pizza maybe had 15 pieces of pepperoni  and 2 pieces were pepperoni free. The BJ special pizza was much lighter on the toppings as well.  Their pizza isn't cheap so disappointed in the quality.
Sue B.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",0,10,1,2.0,5/27/2017,Love the call ahead for not a long wait. Justin our waiter was very nice.  Out of 5 meals ordered 2 meals were terrible. Ribs dry and prime rib sandwich tasted like packaged deli meat.  Not a fan of the food.
Michaela B.,"Orange County, CA",5,24,11,3.0,2/19/2016,"My friend and I came here for the bogo lunch deal. It was pretty cool that you can choose from any of the entrees and that there aren't limitations to the deal! I ordered the New Orleans Jambalaya and the Grilled Chicken Alfredo. The jambalaya portion size was okay, there was a good amount of chicken and shrimp, which was a plus. However, the jambalaya was actually pretty salty. The chicken alfredo was really bland and I had to add salt and pepper to it. The dishes pretty much balanced each other out. I had the Chocolate Chunk Pizookie with vanilla ice cream, which never disappoints! I love pizookies. Service was good, and the server suggested that I sign up for the BJ's rewards, which is actually a pretty good deal! Overall, the food was just okay. I'll probably order something else next time. I can't complain since service  was good and one entree was free!"
