Emily K.,"Chino Hills, CA",538,297,1721,3.0,10/1/2015,"Decided to come here on a whim for one of my friend's birthday tonight. Our friends arrived first and put our name down for a table, I wasn't there to witness this but she said that the hostess looked like she hated her life and was leaning over the counter on her elbow with the bottom of her palm on her forehead when she was asking how many was in our party. Meh, I'll let it slide, maybe she had a long day. We had a party of 7 and all ordered our own dish, everything was pretty whatever. My friends split a pizza and said it tasted like a pizza hut pizza and that it was super dry. The avocado egg rolls were bomb though and so was the appetizer platter but I felt it was a little too pricey for what it was, some mozzarella sticks, egg rolls, chips & dip and youre tryna charge me $17? bruh. But anyways, I ordered the cajun pasta which had a really good flavor to it. My only real complaint would be that a lot of the noodles were stuck together as if it'd been sitting for awhile or maybe not cooked properly? I also had a few of my friends' fries that came with his burger and they were soggy. The servers were very attentive though and came by pretty often to refill our waters and drinks. At the end after we gave the bill back to them, we told them to keep the change but they brought it back anyways? lol. The service was kinda all over the place today, everything was either hit or miss I guess. Probably won't be back just because the food is meh for how expensive it is, but I guess they do give pretty good portion sizes."
Mark B.,"San Antonio, TX",44,145,63,2.0,1/27/2016,"Was having a casual business dinner and was encouraged to sit at the bar tables. Without any customers in the entry area both hostesses were standing around. We asked for a booth near the bar, but we simply got a point in the general area, so my colleague and I went on a search.  The seating at the bar area was very limited and not conducive of a business dinner. We went back to the hostess and found a small crowd now. We were asked to sign in and had to wait several minutes for a table. I felt as if we should have just been given a table to begin with. Our waitress was very rushed and eager to get away from our table. She actually walked off ad my colleague attempted to order an appetizer. Our appetizers came out a short while later and we're great.  Our waitress eventually surfaced again for a fly by ""you guys doing ok?"" She was already gone before we could respond and tell her we wanted to place an order. After we flagged her down we placed our orders. I was unhappy to find that the pork chops I have come to love are no longer on the menu. I decided to order the fish and chips. BJ'S has always had good everything so I was sorely disappointed when my fish was the worst I have ever had. The bottom of the dish had a pool of grease that the fish was sitting in. It left the batter greasy and soggy. There was so much greasy batter that I eventually had to peel it off to get to the fish.  There were so many misses during my visit that I will not be a returning customer."
Rajat K.,"Irvine, CA",0,33,2,4.0,2/13/2016,Dylan at BJs is a guy who goes out of his way to make rhings happen. Been going there for 10 yrs. they do a great job for the most part. They are humans and is impossible to please everyone all the time
Nina B.,"Newport Beach, CA",111,16,,3.0,7/9/2015,"The pizza is not as good as it looks, even the BJ's Favorite.  The atmosphere is definitely family oriented, at least in late-afternoon. The service was okay, but no better. Floors were sticky and table was sticky.  I might try it again to check out the burgers, but if I go back, my expectations will definitely be lower."
Melissa C.,"Long Beach, CA",13,114,182,2.0,12/21/2014,"1st... a positive - it's pretty cool they have happy hour during NFL games.  The California Club flatbread was $4 & tasted just like a club sandwich.  Perfect size for snacking. For $12 we got 2 Titos vodka drinks & the flatbread.  But it's really, really weird that they have a full bar & can't make a Moscow Mule.  It's a very popular drink right now.  I would totally understand not having copper mugs & serving it in a rocks glass.  But to actually say, ""Sorry we don't make those"" is really just weird.  So we settled on Vodka sodas - sadly the soda was flat.   No wonder this place didn't make it in Belmont Shore (Long Beach).  It has a very corporate, chain restaurant vibe which it so...well executed on the corporate, chain, blah vibe.  The service in the bar, we were at a table, was mediocre.  The server made zero conversation with us & barely cracked a smile when we joked with her."
Stacy F.,"Orlando, FL",1317,1460,7211,4.0,9/12/2014,"We had a great experience at this BJ's and having just moved to the area, we are happy to know that this location is now close to our new home. We headed in because it's a chain place that we both enjoy and feel comfortable eating at pretty much anywhere we go. We were on a time crunch and picking something we knew was the best option for the night. There was a bit of a wait - 15 minutes, but we were seated in about 10. We let the waitress know that we were in a bit of a time crunch and she was extremely accommodating of it. She took our order right away and had the food out quickly. She even got us our bill right after she confirmed that our food was to our liking.  We had a great patio seat with lots of fans over head for the little bit of heat that was still sticking to the day before the sun completely set. The place was busy, but everyone was on their game and seemed to be handling the rush with ease and experience.  My honey chicken salad was amazingly fresh and delicious. Their homemade root beer is delish. Wish we had time to get a Pzookie, but it wasn't to be. Next go-round. Overall: A Great staff. Sit on the patio. Order a root beer."
Steven N.,"Orange, CA",41,79,137,4.0,10/16/2015,"Woah! Everything was almost on point tonight! My friends and I came in and waited for about 20 minutes to be seated. When we sat down, our table was clean right away. Great! Both of my friends ordered a vegetarian pizza and I got an entree of Cajun pasta. The servers are very nice. They all smiled, asked if we're okay, and answered our questions nicely. It's not my first time trying BJ's and my friends really loved their's. The only problems we had was that our food took so long including our check too. The waitress forgot to print us a new check since we asked her to split it in 2. But that's not much of a big deal. We also got a $10 off deal for spending at least $35 on our food. Anyways, we will come back again soon if we're in the mood for some Italian food!"
Peter H.,"Torrance, CA",382,132,308,3.0,11/30/2014,"Been going here for years with friends, family, clubs, and organizations. The staff is friendly and the food is decent. I highly reco,mend their deep dish pizza if you are looking for something filling and delicious at the same time  Oh and to add to their food, they supposedly make this root beer in house so it is really delicious when tey add ice cream to it for a root beer float!!"
Vero G.,"Thornton, CO",0,55,1,1.0,10/11/2015,"Just left the restaurant and I was very disappointed. The food was good as always but the service.....HORRIBLE. We walked in around 10pm and no one greeted us nor came to seat us. There were 2 girls at the togo counter one was on the phone. Finally the young lady comes gets the menu and ask for 2? No greeting Hi How are you....nothing. We sit down restaurant is pretty empty everyone's at the bar. We waited about 4 minutes to finally meet our server. The whole thing was a disaster.  Manager was gossiping alot with servers at one point my server was laughing away with her manager instead of getting me refill. I understand restaurants get busy and things take a while,  but it wasn't busy it was pretty empty in there. Our server didn't deliver any of our food to us. Thank you to the kitchen staff for bringing out our food. And to top it off as we are eating a gentleman took our cheese and pepper to refill it. I don't understand why that couldn't wait. Very disappointed in the service!"
Megan M.,"Tustin, CA",60,4,,1.0,2/4/2017,"So disappointed with the service. Came in and was told they just needed to clean a booth for us, no problem. Waited about ten minutes was taken to a dirty booth, was told they would clean it, waited another 10 min watching the bussers talk at the booth they were supposed to be cleaning, while other people were being seated, I was already pissed. Sat and waited and waited, finally a server noticed we were not being waited on she came and apologized and ordered drinks, but we waited about another ten minutes just for drinks. Asked to speak to manager and she wasn't really interested,  like I was bothering her. I am a restaurant manager/server for 14 years now and I would be ashamed at my wait staff, food was alright, we only come to bjs for the amazing tomatoe soup, but will definitely not be coming back here, SECRET SHOPPERS ARE NEEDED FOR THIS RESTAURANT,  find out what's going on with management because they are dropping the ball"
Jason F.,"Anaheim, CA",3,10,54,4.0,9/26/2015,Came here for a drink. Bartender James made me an awesome Bloody Mary...  Morrissey playing on the tunes..  not a bad way to wake up on a Saturday.
Marylin P.,"Irvine, CA",0,37,18,4.0,8/13/2014,I have been coming here for years. I always see new faces working here. A lot has changed. I think the customer service has improved a lot. I recall when this place use to have mainly good looking servers with poor attitude.  Today this place is great. My friend is a regular here and she always requests Brandi. She's a great server!
Judy G.,"Chino Hills, CA",7,3,,1.0,7/31/2016,"If I could give zero stars I would. I went in on 7/30/16 early evening around 4:00 pm. It was the worst service I've ever experienced in a restaurant. I was placed on hold for fifteen minutes, when I entered the establishment, there were three employees standing in the takeout area conversing instead of attending to guests. The management actions were deplorable and the environment is not inviting or professional at all. They were not busy, yet the staff acted as if they could care less about returning guests. No warm smiles, please come again or simply have a nice day, do yourself a favor, go to Lazy Dog, where they know customer service. I wish I had read the reviews of this establishment, the census is not favorable."
Andrew C.,"Irvine, CA",296,2,2,1.0,5/23/2014,"I came here to watch the Super Bowl with a group of friends and the cheeseburger I ordered gave me food poisoning. That aspect of my experience can be forgiven.  What makes me  give this place one star is my experience with Howard, the general manager.  Howard is a complete jerk. I came in today to complain about my food poisoning, and was referred to Erin. Erin was very considerate and professional. He brought back his general manager however, who basically accused me of lying.  I told Howard that I had gotten sick the night of the super bowl, and that the next day I called in to complain. I told him that they referred me to human resources who told me they were going to send me a gift card for compensation. Upon waiting a few weeks and receiving nothing in the mail, I called back only to have an employee tell me they were going to personally send me a gift card. Again, i waited a few weeks and received nothing.  I happened to be in the area today, and decided to complain in person. Upon telling Howard my story, he questioned me as to the names of the HR person and the employee I talked to. Considering that this happened a while ago I couldn't remember. He then proceeded to say that my story ""didn't sound legitimate"". He asked me how much i wanted on the gift card in a manner that suggested I was being unreasonable. I told him ""however much"". He replied by saying ""since the burger you ordered is only $10 I think that's how much you should be compensated"" I chose not to call him out on his attitude considering I was with my little sister, but was very tempted to go off on him. not only was he unapologetic towards the fact that I had food poisoning and was forced to miss class for a week, but he was trying to make it seem like I was making stuff up just to get a gift card. He turned to Erin and said ""whatever just put $10 on the card and give it to him"". He then proceeded to walk away from me as if I had just wasted his time.  I want to make a point in this review that Erin displayed an exceptional attitude. Upon giving me the gift card, he made sure to thank me for my time and told me to have a good day. He was very polite and attentive.  It is beyond me how that douchebag of a general manager got hired to run this place. He is incompetent when it comes to customer service. $10 in no way makes up for the experience of getting food poisoned, being stuck in bed, and being forced to miss important class time. I will be sure to take my business elsewhere in the future to watch sporting events with my friends."
Charles R.,"Irvine, CA",163,167,271,3.0,12/29/2014,"Sort of disappointed tonight with my meal. I usually love the Jumbalaya. But they first delivered it with bell peppers that I specifically asked to not have (I get violently sick from them). Then it was served with the chicken and andouille sausage overcooked. Brandon gave us very good service! He did tell us that the manager had ""taken care of"" my meal, which in fact he didn't. It was subtracted from my bill only after having been entered twice."
Clara C.,"Irvine, CA",2017,776,2655,4.0,5/14/2015,"I always thought BJ's had good food, but what stops me from frequenting here is the wait time.  It takes a good 5-10 minutes for a waiter to take your drink order, then another 15-20 minutes for your food to come out.  If it's a busy night, you may have to wait a while just to be seated.  At this location at the Tustin/Irvine Marketplace, it gets busy quickly.   I love that BJ's has a huge menu: appetizers, entrees, salads/soups, desserts.  On top of that, their drink selection is pretty impressive.  Sometimes it doesn't help if you are indecisive..everything on the menu will start to sound awesome and you order too much food!  My favorite appetizer is the stuffed mushroom, although they added more items on their appetizer menu like the flatbread and carnitas fries.  My favorite entrees here include burgers and pizza.  I love their deep-dish pizza - so many great choices like Great White, Sweet Pig, and BBQ Chicken.  My fave salads include Thai Chicken Mango and Santa Fe (I love avocado!).  For dessert, you cannot go wrong with the famous pizookie.  Their newest on the menu is the smores peanut butter.  (Note: you cannot get this one in a mini/birthday size)  I tried red velvet, triple chocolate, and salted caramel, and I still prefer cookies and cream.  The previous three are VERY sweet. HAPPY HOUR: Mon-Fri 3p-7p and Sun-Thur 10p-close.  (Yes, they close late: midnight!) Their happy hour doesn't really work for me, but $5 martinis!  For this location's happy hour menu, see their website here:  The reason they get four stars is I received excellent customer service from Craig.  He was great with checking on our drinks and making sure we had everything we needed.  That particular visit I had an email coupon, and he had already applied it when he brought the check.  This really impressed me because most times the waiter makes me wait another 20 minutes to correct the bill with their manager (sometimes it still comes out wrong), especially on my trips to BJ's. Tip: join the BJ's premier rewards program!  I get free food :)  Here is the link to their website "
ritu p.,"Newport Beach, CA",1,2,,1.0,2/3/2017,The service just sucks....first time here it's been 20 minutes and we still don't have our food. Disappointing experience.
Jack C.,"Anaheim, CA",15,38,7,2.0,5/19/2015,Summary: Wrong orders everywhere during none busy hours. Not coming here again. Go to TGIF instead. Explanation: We were seated quickly and served our drinks. Our waitress got orders wrong. Friend 1: Asked for skinny fries with his burger. He recieved Potato Wedges. Friend 2: Asked for Medium Burger and a side or ranch. No side ranch. Burger overcooked. Friend 3: Asked for a bowl of tortilla soup. Asked another waiter who brought Clam Chowder. Told the waiter the correct soup. Brought it out after everyone finished. Friend 4: Ordered Totonka Stout. Never recieved it. Waitress didnt even put it on the receipt. This is honestly bad service on the waiters and waitresses side. The food was good though which merits the 2 stars but I'll pass this location.
Lauren R.,"Santa Ana, CA",22,52,37,4.0,4/23/2016,"I'm always pleasantly surprised when I dine at BJs. Everything I've ordered off their extensive menu has been delicious. They have a great wine selection at reasonable prices. A good place for date night as well as the family. Great selection, atmosphere and superb customer service!"
Thomas A.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,27,5,1.0,7/26/2016,Not very good service at all. Took over 35 minutes for the waitress to come over and even take order. After that the food reminded me of something that Pizza Hut will be making. I had a steak that was terrible and about the size of the fork. It's most unfortunate but they concentrating on making beer. The service and the food go down the drain. Once iconic Southern California favorite slowly  going away. There are far better choices around in California. Too bad it is like the good old days when I was just one little pizza joint in Santa Ana.
