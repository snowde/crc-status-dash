Big Y.,"Irvine, CA",0,7,,2.0,8/11/2016,One of the most mediocre meals I've had in a long time.  Did BJs used to be good or did I just not know any better?  Basically microwave dinner status.
Samuel B.,"Irvine, CA",14,35,162,5.0,7/8/2015,"Love it. Beer. Pizza. Pasta. Pizookies! Pi-friggin-zookies!!! Genius idea. Atmosphere is also lively and I dig the coverage of sporting events on the tvs, especially when it's 3 at once!!! So cool.  I would have to say I wish it could be a tiny bit cheaper, but I can't be too picky. If you love pizza, get any of their pizzas. They are thick and fluffy and packed with flavor.  Make sure to make a reservation though! The place can get packed, especially at night!"
Nermeen A.,"Irvine, CA",0,2,,1.0,2/5/2017,I wish don't put any stars  the restroom is very very dirty and not clean at all I feel I throw up and the smell is very very bad
Richard J.,"South El Monte, CA",0,18,6,3.0,1/18/2016,"There are a few things that come to mind when thinking of a great place to dine.. One is obviously the food, this place has it.  Variety, mid-range meals, bargain meals and beer!  The other things are ambience/environment which it has a bit of as well.  The last thing is customer service/experience.  That is where this location falls short.   I've been a customer of several BJ's restaurant and this one for quite some time since I work nearby.  The wait staff is usually chipper but I always seem to get stuck with someone who isn't very nice.  I have a high tolerance for issue and not complaining because I'm considerate to things that may be out of their control but bad service is just that.. bad service.  My recent experience there was on a Monday night for the College Football Championship.  I arrived shortly after 5pm and grabbed an open booth at the bar, good enough to see multiple TVs and enough privacy for personal conversation.  Our waitress was a very good looking gal who seemed like she was in a rush when greeting me at the table.  I had obviously just sat down and without hesitation she asked me if I knew what I wanted to order.  I get that she may have asked for my drink order but I felt it odd that she asked if I wanted to order food without giving me a second to look at the menu.  I know I've been here multiple times but it was how she said it.  I then began to feel like she was rushing me because she knew that I was going to watch the game and most likely, she didn't feel that I would be ordering throughout the game, which I did do.   I was waiting for a friend so I was very patient when ordering my food/drinks in anticipation that my guest would be a few minutes behind.  Nonetheless, I ordered some wings, a personal pizza and a beer.  As my guest arrived he asked for menu and he simply did not get one.  After we both finished our drinks, she comes back and asks if he was ready to order.  similar to my experience, he felt rushed because she had not even left the menu the first time nor did she bring my water that I asked for several times.   All that to say, during the start of the 4th quarter of the game I was about to order a final beer when the waitress came over and said that she would be leaving for the day and before she was going to introduce us to our new waiter, she wanted to close out the tab/check.   Not knowing what to say, we agreed to close it out.  I know this was done because she wanted to cash out on the tip which she did deserve but that was definitely awkward and unprofessional in my opinion.  I ended up making a mistake about the tip and I over tipped because it was a split bill.  Just a disaster of an experience.  I'm sure that doesn't speak for the entire staff however, this isn't the first time I've been to this location and the service wasn't great.   BJ's I still love your chicken wings, don't hate me for my feedback ;-)"
Jessica V.,"Tustin, CA",143,78,8,2.0,5/27/2016,"Nice ambience and great service from the servers. The hostesses are not interactive nor helpful, and are pretty stand off-ish. I've worked in the restaurant industry before and I have to say, this is by far one of the worst customer service. Purely the hostesses that are working (5/27) aside from the sweet Asian one that sat us. I live right by here and gave this place a shot because it's my sister's birthday and she really wanted to come. But probably won't be coming again."
Ashley Z.,"Huntington Beach, CA",143,210,126,5.0,10/1/2015,"Yum!!!!  I hadnt been to BJ's in years!  My friend called and invited me, and I'm so glad she did!!  My lunch was absolutely delicious!!!  I ordered the 1/2 sandwich and salad lunch combo.  I chose the pesto chicken sandwich and the caprese (tomato/mozzarella) salad, with crispy french fries.   The salad came out first and was to die for.  It was soooo so good!!  I could eat it everyday for the rest of my life and be a happy girl!!  The sandwich and fries were also delicious!   Our server was AWESOME  (I feel bad that I didn't get his name, because honestly, he was one of the best servers I've had in a LONG time) To top it off...it was FREE pizookie day!!!!  1/2 peanut butter for me 1/2 chocolate chip for my friend....heaven!"
Sharon B.,"Duarte, CA",118,11,245,5.0,1/29/2016,Needless to say we took them up in their offer! My daughter and I had an awesome lunch here today. BJ's management and their staff really do care about their customers' satisfaction. So we will continue to be regulars here!
Bahman P.,"Tustin, CA",0,11,5,3.0,7/13/2016,"We eat out all the time , been to this BJ's location many times and last night the service was so bad that I decided to finally write a review.   Receptionist are not polite and somewhat rude. We were served by a young lady name Tierra.  Simply putting it she was rude, cold , arrogant,  unfriendly , don't care !!! I always leave 20% minimum gratuity when eating out . my wife who is always lay back and cool about everything said to leave her $0 .  I still feel bad and left %10 on a $90 bill !!"
Sundos S.,"Santa Ana, CA",77,18,28,4.0,3/16/2014,"We love this place. Consistently great tasting food, always buzzing with a laid back vibe. We usually head towards the bar area for self seating and no wait. Same menu & sometime better service!  I've tried a variety of things here ranging from veggie jalapeño burgers to yummy happy hour finger food.  The winner of my BJ heart definitely goes to their Jambalaya plate. They are totally open to substitutions, since I don't eat meat they always don't mind giving me all shrimp rather than their trio of meat/shrimp. It's spices, balance of veggies/protein/carbs, and filling deliciousness is perfection. This time though, we decided to switch up our order and got the avocado egg rolls & stuffed mushroom appetizers along with a medium half buffalo chicken half vegetarian deep dish pizza. Wayyyy too much food for two people, definitely could have gone with the small pizza!  The avocado rolls were delicious, light and flavorful. Perfect appetizer, love the taste of the slightly warmed avocado in just the right amount of crispy. Sometimes, some food just makes you moan close your eyes and thank the heavens for good food. Those were the stuffed mushrooms for you. Little and delectable, the appetizer portion comes as six lil scrumptious mushrooms. Comes with a slice of lemon, we asked for more, squeeze em on for the most epic finishing touch to these guys. The pizza was good, the crust was phenomenal and so soft it was heaven in ma mouth. My vegetarian half came with roasted tomatoes, bell peppers, olives, and artichoke hearts (which I substituted for the onions). Good flavors, fresh ingredients, but for some reason I wasn't impressed. Good, but probably wouldn't order again. Overall great place to have a nice meal or have drinks and watch the game-we've never gone wrong here. It'll always have a place in our hearts, and our bellies!"

Kirsten H.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",33,23,,2.0,9/26/2015,"Went here last night with my husband and it was fairly good to start, our service was decent. However half way through our server said she was going on break and so and so was taking over and she took off. At the time she went on break I was in need of a refill and she didn't notice and walked away so fast I couldn't ask for one. Then the breaker never came by to check on us til she decided we were ready because she brought the check. I felt very rushed and was irritated I had to eat my dinner without a beverage.  To top it off, both my husband and I ended up sick in the middle of the night."
Carolina N.,"Irvine, CA",0,5,,1.0,6/17/2016,"This BJ's location has really proven to be a huge disappointment once and for all. This is the second time in two weeks we have attempted to have dinner here but the wait time has been over an hour and twenty minutes long. The first time we understood but didn't want to wait as it was late and we were hungry. Today, however, we decided to give it a second try but it was the same story. We couldn't even be seated at the bar. Very unacceptable.  I'd give more stars for the food but we never managed to stay long enough. We will no longer be visiting or recommending this location anymore."
John M.,"Tustin, CA",1,7,,5.0,3/23/2015,Love this location. All of the bar staff is amazing and the menu always has something to hit the spot! The beer selection is top-quality as well and I frequent here after work because I love the atmosphere.
Devin C.,"Orange, CA",169,1,,5.0,4/16/2016,"Wow such great service. Today at BJ's My server was Jordan. After having him as a server before, I knew this visit was going to lift my spirits up. Such a great guy. He took our order with enthusiasm and made us laugh. Looking at him work making guests laugh makes me wonder where all the other good servers are. Will be going back, not only for the hot wings, but for the hot service too! Way to go Jordan! Thanks for making this visit memorable."
Clare S.,"Irvine, CA",633,71,116,4.0,2/16/2015,"BJs is a pretty solid restaurant - impeccably clean, good quality food, decent service, and a great ambience. Only grip is that the service is kind of slow, and the wait can be long.  I used to always get the Steak Salad, but I'm sad to say that I don't think they have this anymore. So the last time I was here, I tried something new - the Cherry Chipotle Glazed Salmon (see picture) over a bed of fluffy Israeli couscous, spinach and asparagus. I found this under the Enlightened section of the menu, so I expected something small and light since it was boasting a low calorie count. I was pleasantly surprised at how large the portion was. I could barely finish it! And I was delighted to find the dish to be VERY delicious and flavorful. I was ""mmm""ing at every bite, and baffled at how this could only be only 590 calories. Seasons 52 better watch out! I liked this salmon A WHOLE lot more than Seasons 52's low-calorie salmon dish (and needless to say, Season's 52 is also a lot more expensive, and the portion is smaller). I think I've found my go-to, guilt-free dish here... Also, I usually get beer, but this time I decided to try the Sparkling Raspberry Lemonade Mocktail (see pic). This was a tad too sweet, but still good. $3.50 felt especially worth it because of the unlimited refills. Next time I'll probably get another Mocktail instead of beer.  All in all, 4 stars. I won't be frequenting place TOO often cause it's a bit expensive for my taste (I can buy two meals elsewhere for the price of one here), but I'll definitely be back with friends in the next couple of months."
Randoll C.,"Los Angeles, CA",582,1424,6023,3.0,5/16/2012,"BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse is OK. I wouldn't consider it comfort food however, it's definitely consistent; you know what to expect and you know what you're getting. So, yesterday, when friends suggested meeting up here for dinner, there was no argument from me.  Lots of parking as it's in the Marketplace of Jamboree but know that there's a handful of restaurants nearby so though there's parking, you might have to walk a bit.  Service was pretty good last night. Our server (forget her name) was pretty attentive even with our party (6) being seated out on the patio. She was on the spot with refills with our adult beverages as well as not argumentative when we let her know that the appetizer plates were all dirty.  Food was OK. We all split a pizza, Jambalaya and some fish dish. Again, the food is OK. it's not great though it's definitely not fast food. This is a chain so like I mentioned, you know what to expect. The selection of beer seems to be growing from what I remember. As a fan of craft beer, I appreciate how there wasn't ads for the inexpensive, domestic beer that you can pick up anywhere. If I were just reviewing the brewhouse, my rating would be one star more, but for the most part, and in general, BJ's is OK in my book. Not my first, second or third choice of places to go - but I won't argue too hard if others want to meet up there."
Anthony T.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,2,2,1.0,4/3/2016,"Unorganized, my name was called to be seated but made us wait 15 min more to be seated , meal was no worth the wait"
Cal7amg ..,"Birmingham, AL",0,3,,4.0,6/24/2016,"Great IPA, great food, chill atmosphere, I loved it here. Eric was a great server!! Give it a try, I will be back again in the future!!"
Bill S.,"Irvine, CA",275,23,,2.0,7/20/2016,This review is on takeout. Ordered Alfredo pasta with chicken and broccoli. Requested extra broccoli and chicken on the side. Should have checked my meals before I left. No extra broccoli and chicken in the pasta. Not too happy about the situation. But I will take the blame since I did not check the order myself before I left. Just disappointed
Lidia W.,"Irvine, CA",1,5,,3.0,7/8/2016,"I really only came for the pazookie. They have so many cookies its hard to decide. I ordered the hickory brisket and bacon burger. It has smoked brisket, applewood smoked bacon, Cheddar and Jack cheese, red onions, bbq sauce and mayo. It was really filling. The only reason I am giving 3 stars is because my burger wasn't cooked how I ordered. I wanted medium and it came to me well done. Absolutely NO pink. Why ask how I want burger cooked if it won't be like that? Other than, I enjoyed my time there."
