T G.,"Huntington Beach, CA",5,136,143,3.0,4/16/2016,"I'm not going going to lie, the balsamic chicken on babay greens was mad good! The chicken was cooked to perfection! I thought it would come out dry on the outside or inedible on some parts but it was juicy and I ate every bite! What was a disappointment were the drinks. Neither of our drinks came out good. Our server was super sweet and amazing. I thoroughly enjoyed sitting outside with the hockey game on one TV and the baseball game on the next one. Although our drink experience was less than stellar this visit, it's BJs so no doubt we'll be back."
Camila G.,"Jamul, CA",15,28,4,4.0,6/2/2016,"I absolutely loved the meat pizza I got, as well as the pizookie. I think BJ's may be my favorite chain restaurant. On the flip slide, I came here at around 7 pm, so it was packed, and we had to wait quite a while (probably half an hour) at the bar before we could be seated at a regular dining table. Overall, service is decent, waiters are nice, wait is bad, but I loved the food."
Audrey H.,"Irvine, CA",10,7,7,5.0,4/1/2016,My review is for the customer service the manager Caitlyn and server Miriam provided. (See my Taps review from next door.) Caitlyn accommodated our requests without hesitation. She knows what it means to be customer service oriented. Miriam agreed that the customer should be put first. The food rocked too! Thank you BJ's!! WE WILL be back!!
Ben C.,"Clovis, CA",4,14,7,1.0,2/11/2015,"Shocking meal there tonight.  Ordered a rib-eye steak medium rare with cheddar mash and sprouts. 30 minutes later, out came a rare rib-eye steak, sprouts that looked like they were cooked yesterday, mash that was flavorless and worse yet,  all of the meal was cold. Sent it back to be told they would redo it straight away. After 20 minutes of waiting I cancelled the order as everyone else had finished and just asked for the bill. A further 10 minutes later that arrived! Terrible service, none of the party I was with enjoyed their meals either with similar complaints of lukewarm food. Hang your heads in shame BJ's - you ruined what should have been a great culinary night out.   Won't be back."
Phil S.,"Placentia, CA",2,24,,2.0,5/30/2016,Not too good.  Might have been different if we had pizza possibly Apps- calamari was burned and chips and guacamole were average.  Entrees - mahi mahi tacos ok. Bbq chicken salad tasted like it was out of a bag. Chicken entree was also ok.  Pizookie is what you should come here for and that's about it.
George G.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,73,1,2.0,12/10/2016,God forbid they refill your drinks or bring the apps before the main course.  Why is this location always sooooo bad and why doesn't corporate do something about the service here already?  One thing consistent is the lack of good service at this location.  They smile as they screw everything up.
Joe D.,"Tustin, CA",0,19,5,5.0,12/3/2016,"BJ's is a family favorite. Tonite we took our daughter and grandkids for dinner. Everything was excellent from our server Brandon to our dinner and finally to our Pazookies. We had sliders, pizza, grilled cheese sandwich and an excellent Cobb salad. Brandon gave us the best service we have had in years! He was on top of every need before we even asked. Great job Brandon! Many thanks!"
Samantha M.,"Corona, CA",3,148,34,1.0,3/12/2016,"Nasty, dirty , no refills , waitress never came back she could care less we found dirty things my moms food was disgusting please save your money  won't be coming here again"
Nichelle W.,"Irvine, CA",60,10,,2.0,3/23/2016,"I am a Bj's regular. I came to this location near my house after a night with family, we came to just grab a quick dessert, it was very packed for a Wednesday because of a nearby function going on. There was no one at the reception desk for about 5 minutes, and both servers that We did find were very rude and short with us, Haley R, and another server. I'll leave it to maybe it was a bad day for them but really not even a smile? It was overall horrible customer service."
Ami T.,"CA, CA",7,41,55,4.0,5/18/2016,"I like that they are opened late. Food is good for the bar (nothing really special). Whenever everything else is closed, it is a perfect place for a light dinner, you can always get a salad or soup and they are not bad at all."
Margaret J.,"Riverside County, CA",1,12,1,3.0,10/21/2014,"Came here Saturday night around 11 to get something quick to eat so we ordered some appetizers. Got the stuffed mushrooms, carnitas fries, and the Mac n cheese. Everything was great except for the Mac n cheese. In fact it wasn't even cheesy... First time we got it we took bites from it and there was absolutely no cheese on it...like literally none. We told our server and he apologized, he was very polite and helpful. He brought us a new one and it was the same thing. Quite disappointed b/c I've had it before and know what it's supposed to taste like and this time both were just baked noodles in oil. Check out my pic to see it for yourself. 3 stars bc service was good"
Julie T.,"Dana Point, CA",0,10,,4.0,11/28/2016,"Service at this BJs is great.  Waiters and waitresses are very friendly.  Food came quickly, and the pizookiis are the best!"
Ash R.,"Santa Ana, CA",1,8,1,5.0,11/28/2016,"THEIR PAZOOKIES ARE DANK AS HELL!!!! 10 OUT OF 10 I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND!! Potato wedges are gr8 as well. Waitresses usually have some sass to them but that's okay, I'm into it. Overall, great eatery, I would def go again"
Jim G.,"Covina, CA",154,439,2,4.0,6/2/2014,"OK, 4 Star for what it is.  BJ's is what BJ's is.  You go there like so many other chains because you know exactly what you are going to get. Food is extremely consistent and you are going to get a quality dish, ample portions and usually pretty solid service. So if BJ's is what you are looking for, this one will not disappoint."
Nikki D.,"Huntington Beach, CA",3,13,1,5.0,5/27/2016,"Had dinner with the family today. They said 30 to 45 minutes wait but we got seated in 15 min. We ordered a little too much. We ordered pizza, traditional wings, chicken tortilla soup (btw.. This soup is really good) spaghetti with meatballs, ravioli, watermelon salad. The portion are big too. We can't finished it but they were all very good. Bjs improved the food choices a lot. The marinara sauce is so much tastier now. I like our server. She was really nice. She checked up on us at least more than 3 times. And the brew rootbeer is very good."
Ahmed I.,"Irvine, CA",0,8,2,5.0,12/11/2016,"One of the best places to dine in. Actually, I tried the pizza, soups, salads and burgers they are all awesome.  With respect to desserts,  they have their famous pizzokie, if you are a chocolate lover try the chocolate one!!!"
Katie L.,"Irvine, CA",5,37,26,1.0,1/17/2015,"Man this place sucks!!! Food was mediocre at best, one of our entrées came out 15 minutes after we got all of our food... And they never even offered a discount or comp anything on the receipt after their error.  The deep dish pizza we ordered was horrible. I swear there wasn't any pizza sauce on that 'pizza' or maybe it got evaporated from over cooking it and bringing it to me burnt. Really? You see a burnt pizza and think 'I bet they will love this'.?!??  You would think this place would be good for kids... But it is not. The waitstaff gave us dirty looks as they passed by our table and saw our toddler throwing it's nasty mac & cheese (that we bought for six dollars) all over the floor! I don't blame him for throwing the food... I wanted to do the same with mine! I guess it boils down to this... There are so many options around this location to choose from... If you want your restaurant to succeed, you need good customer service, and the two times I've been there, the waitstaff is horrible and the food is inconsistent.  Yelp ANY other restaurant nearby and choose that one!"
Emily J.,"Orange County, CA",193,478,1695,4.0,5/24/2015,"Solid (food and service) every time we come here.  I've tried most of the menu by now, and I don't think I've ever left disappointed (or hungry)."
Srujan N.,"Irvine, CA",0,5,3,5.0,12/9/2016,This was my first time at a BJ's restaurant and had a great experience. Service was good and their jalapeno burgers were yummy.
Lonnie T.,"Carlsbad, San Diego, CA",0,19,1,1.0,12/15/2014,"Wow Where do I start. I should've listened to everyone that told me that every time they came here they have had bad service and bad food.  It took forever to get seated, there was soo much trash and cloth napkins underneath the table where we were sitting that my girlfriend almost twisted her ankle. I Ordered angel hair Classico pasta, when the food arrived it almost looked to be a child's portion. I brought this to our servers attention whom which was sporting what I can only describe to be a dog collar, classy lol, and she replied with ""oh, that's because it is a lighter serving"" and I replied ""no sh*t, but where is the rest of it?"" She said ""that's the way it comes sir, I'm sorry"" and walked away. Also not once did a manager ever come around to our table, or anyone else's in that matter. I ate my 4 fork scoops of pasta, paid my bill and away I went. next time I'll go to Denny's"
