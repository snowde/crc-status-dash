A T.,"Newport Beach, CA",36,42,139,1.0,2/23/2015,"So so bad. Wow couldn't even get the waitress to crack the pepper over my salad. Meanwhile i i type this into my phone a group of waitresses are giggling and really not working.. Sad . I come here all the time and it really is  a hit or  miss with the service, ... Actually the service here is terrible. I feel completely un attended for . While i wait for a long time to get some pepper. My entree arrives and i still have a full plate of salad. God . Nothing makes me more mad ... Sucks simply sucks"
Anh D.,"Orange, CA",207,18,9,5.0,3/22/2014,"Honestly this review is mostly for our (my best friend and I) server. I honestly don't even remember her name (I'm so sorry!!!!:/) but she was half Japanese & she was so adorable and attentive and friendly and just a ball of greatness.  I would come back just for her (unlike one of the rude food runners we had; he glared at us & was not polite at all). PS for those of you reading for an actual food review, I always get the cookies & cream pizookie, sooooo amazing!!!"
Mary L.,"Fullerton, CA",334,34,4,1.0,1/14/2015,"Came here for dinner. Arrived at 6:50pm. Asked the front how long the wait will be for 2 people, she told us 25-30 minutes and that it won't be 30 minutes for outside patio. We said okay! The time was 7:30pm, we went up and asked how long is it going to take and that we waited over 30 minutes. She said another 15 minutes.  After hearing that we have to wait another 15 minutes we left hungry and upset. If she would have given us the correct wait time I wouldn't have been too upset because I could have decided not to wait and just went elsewhere instead of waiting 45 plus minutes. But she gave us the wrong time and expectedly us to wait even more... Forget about! Never coming here again!"
Lauren M.,"Seal Beach, CA",12,19,6,2.0,12/30/2014,"Came here for drinks and apps and it was a typical BJS experience. The food is ok as long it's served to you while it's still hot. Service always seems to be amateur. Our group had a round of beers. Obviously we weren't all ready for a second round at the same time. Finished my beer and was ready for another. Our waitress seemed to have a bit of an attitude when we only order apps. She pretty much vanished upon hearing we didn't want more food but I was patient waiting for her to return.  When she did return she left our bill and took my glass, without offering a refill. Awesome, love a side of passive aggressiveness while out with friends."
Marc E.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,16,1,1.0,1/30/2015,"I'm not one to bad mouth, but I just think they need to do a little more training on etiquette. BJs has always been good food and great times. But whatever just happened is the complete opposite. It took a while to be seated but that's normal. After being seated and given our menus, it took about 20 minutes for someone to notice us. And even then, the other servers saw us and didn't talk to us once to let us know someone would be with us. No one even came to bring us waters! It wasn't until 22 minutes that we had to get up and tell the front that we hadn't been served. After waiting another 2 more minutes, we waited and still no server. Never ever have I had to walk out of a restaurant for not being helped.  Please, don't let this happen to any other guest! It's not good for business."
Cat B.,"Costa Mesa, CA",24,47,208,4.0,6/19/2014,"We came here for Happy Hour a couple of days ago because the BF was craving pizza. The restaurant and bar was packed at around 6pm on a Tuesday. Our waitress Jennifer came to our table and asked for our order. I have to say the service was exceptional throughout our meal. Even though the place was really busy, she was attentive and refilled our drinks and was always checking up on us. We found the Manager after our meal and told him that we had a great experience because of Jennifer. The food: I ordered the new Angel Hair Classico pasta with blackened chicken. It came out a little salty but it was still great. We also ordered the BJ's Favorite and Great White mini for $6 each (HH pricing). The best part is that we had just signed up for their rewards program and received a free pizzookie. If you download the app, you can order and pay your bill with your phone! I think this is a great idea especially if you have a big group and like to pay separately. You can also put your name down for a table and order with your phone so the food is ready when you get there. I'm hoping other restaurants will start doing the same thing.  Also they have BJ's 30 Under $10. 30 menu items under $10. I'm just bummed they took out the Tilapia from their enlightened menu Will definitely be back to this location"
Mel H.,"Orange County, CA",285,417,2654,2.0,7/21/2012,"BEWARE of BJ's ""EnLIGHTened"" menu:!!!!!!  (Just because its on the ""light"" doesn't mean it has to taste like crap. Blah. )  EnLIGHTened Thai Chicken Mango Salad: 2 stars!  Chicken was terrible!! Blah. It felt like eating rubber or plastic.  Well, at least the rest of the vegetables and the mango on the salad made up for it. I was ready to ask the waiter to take it back and substitute my meat for fish or something. But my cousin who was with me made a good point. She ordered a regular Sesame Chicken salad and the chicken there was fine. So she explained that it's not that they have bad chicken or can't cook it.  It's either a different part of the meat or that it's steamed and not grilled like normal to avoid using any oils or fats.  Because honestly this chicken was so tough that I could barely get my teeth through it!!!"
George M.,"Tustin, CA",85,22,4,5.0,5/3/2016,The prime rib special and 1/2 off wine brought us in.  It was so perfectly done that I was very pleased.  Our server Tom was always anticipating our needs and did not abandon us once.  I was amazed at how hard he worked and it made our stay more relaxed.
Y a.,"Tustin, CA",0,43,1,2.0,2/20/2016,"I used the BOGO deal on this Saturday to order the roasted chicken and spinach quinoa bowl.  On the menu, that entree shows one piece of juicy plump chicken and says this is lunch portion shown.   I think I got ripped off because I got the lunch portion (one piece of thin and rubbery chicken) when I got charged dinner price (there is no lunch special on weekends).   Very disappointing..."
BettyLou H.,"Irvine, CA",160,180,8,4.0,10/28/2014,"I had a very unsatisfactory experience when I went to the BJ's in Huntington Beach, but we had a great visit at this BJ's.  Definitely get the root beer. I had a great burger that was flavorful and delicious. My lunch buddy had a wrap. The only downside is that even though it wasn't overly busy, the sound travels and it was sometimes hard to hear.  Overall a definite recommendation to hang out, watch TV, and enjoy some good grub."
Angeli O.,"Buena Park, CA",5,34,132,4.0,4/5/2016,"I haven't been here for a while so I was excited to try it again. They changed the menu up, which is great since BJ's has been around for a while now. I got a side salad to start, I would recommend getting the dressing on the side. I didn't ask for it on the side and I had way too much dressing on this salad. I got the vegetarian penne for my entree (new item) and it was delicious, I think next time I will ask them to sprinkle a little cheese on top. I also got the monkey bread (new item) and it was amazing. I love the chocolate chip pizookie (classic) but the monkey bread was just as great! If you love cinnamon, I would highly recommend it. Our waiter was attentive and the food came out pretty quickly, not common for the prior times I had come to this location. I am hoping they implemented some changes and can keep the service at this level. I would come back to this location for sure, especially for the monkey bread."
Sherry K.,"Tustin, CA",756,324,835,3.0,12/10/2014,"5 stars for service; our server (name escapes me) was fantastic, super nice, a good experience due to him.  Bestie and I hit up BJ's because we both felt like going no further than the Tustin/Irvine area for dinner, and neither of us felt inclined to go anywhere more interesting haha! Santa Fe Spring Rolls weren't bad, not superb. certainly I could do better at home, but they arrived quickly and were a share-able quantity for more than just the two of us. We managed just fine though thankyouverymuch! I opted for the vegetarian deep dish pizza. and a house salad. The salad was tasty, definitely more than iceberg lettuce on that generous plate. The pizza was more than a bit dry though, the olives were just barely warmed through, and the cheese was hardly even melted. Bland pizza isn't how I recall BJ's of meals past! Still, like I stated before, the service was on-par, so I'll give 'em another shot one of these days :)"
M-K C.,"Irvine, CA",0,73,62,4.0,6/21/2015,"Tried brunch here Liked the food. Delicious and light Loved the tomato soup but clam chowder was too salty though Service was good, friendly, attentive. Will come back for more especially on game night"
David C.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",68,40,54,4.0,8/5/2014,"BJS has always been one of my favorite casual restaurants. They have good beer and good food. Today we went for something light. They seem to have a new under 750 calories menu, but we went with the Flatbread pepperoni extravaganza and the lettuce wraps! Both delicious, one quick tip on the lettuce wraps, make sure you just add a little bit of the spice mustard, if not your eyes will get watery very quickly! To end the perfect dinner at Bjs, their home made cookie with Ice cream (pizookies) is as a must have!"
Ryan H.,"Orange County, CA",108,19,6,5.0,7/6/2015,"The wife and I live a few blocks away, and we come to BJ's on a fairly regular basis.  It can get crowded at times, but that is to be expected from any great restaurant. Just grab a beeper at wait at the very large bar area. Time flies when you are having a great beer or cocktail! Service is always friendly, and food comes at a normal quickness. They have an expansive gluten-free menu as well. Their brews are exquisite and very fair-priced. Their Hopstorm IPA can rival most SoCal breweries. Not to mention, they also carry multiple guest beers on tap as well. Overall, I have never left BJ's unsatisfied. Would recomemmend to family, friends, and enemies alike. PS - I almost NEVER write reviews, especially at this length, but I felt the need to sing BJ's praises. Bring the family, meet a date, or swing by and catch a game on the many TVs. You will NOT be disappointed."
Matt H.,"Orange, CA",218,765,218,4.0,2/23/2014,"One of the few places (oh Numero Uno, where have you all gone?) doing deep dish style pizza, with all the greasy goodness of the crust.  I usually head there when I am on my own for a meal, which I fine, as I sit at the bar and have a cocktail or two with my small pizza watching the giant TVs cycling through various sporting events. And if you want dessert, get the pizzookie.  Don't ask, just... do it."
Alex T.,"Irvine, CA",0,16,4,3.0,12/31/2015,"The reason why I'm giving 3 stars is primarily related to poor service. They offer call ahead seating and told me it would be about 20-30 minutes. I arrived after 20 minutes and after being ignored by all 6 of the hostesses standing around talking I was told it would be 15-20 minutes more! After 30 more minutes waiting at the restaurant we were seated and was given sub par service by our server. She wasn't very friendly nor attentive. Towards the end of the meal she offered to refill my fiancés water, and when it didn't even fill halfway she said ""oh I thought I had more in there"" and never came back to fill it up! Lol I wouldn't go with too high of expectations."
Naima A.,"Irvine, CA",34,5,4,4.0,8/1/2014,I went with 3 other people later in the evening on a Friday. It was a bit packed but we were seating pretty quick. Atmosphere was chill not too noisy.vService was nice and quick. We came for dessert and ordered 3 Pizookis and were served shortly after. I got the double chocolate and it was good and pretty heavyyyy. Do not have this after a meal you won't finish it.
Lisa F.,"Yorba Linda, CA",326,145,47,1.0,11/18/2014,"This is in regards to the take-out service.    MY company orders lunch for the office several times a month.  We decided we should try BJ's out and informed them over the phone that we had 20 orders to place.  When we picked up our order and got back to the office, we noticed 6 ENTIRE employee meals were missing as well as a few appetizers. We called them back and they did not seem to care, but we went to go pick them up since we were charged for them.   When we got there, no apologies were made and they ended up forgetting three coleslaw's that were supposed to come as a side with the three BBQ platters, an order of Fritos Nachos, the french fries that come with the burger, an order of avocado eggrolls, and a mini pizza was STILL missing.  Apparently they don't double/triple check their to-go orders and don't seem to care about customer service and keeping their customers happy. Since we order group lunches often, we KNOW for CERTAIN we won't be calling BJ's."
Cassidy J.,"Orange, CA",161,327,573,3.0,4/8/2015,"BJ's is pretty good! I was very impressed with the customer service that our large party received eating there. We had a few different types of pizza.. the buffalo chicken and the BJs favorite.. And I will be totally honest.. it was good.. but for the price it wasn't amazing. I would have expected a bit more. Now, I am sure there are some really great things here on the menu.. which is large.. but expensive. I am not convinced that BJs is worth the price. The pizookies.... are honestly why I come. They are so dang good. Just cookie ice cream goodness that you just can't go without. Even if I try not to I always have to get one. Always worth it.   Overall... BJ's is good.. but in my opinion overpriced. Maybe just come for the pizookies!!"
