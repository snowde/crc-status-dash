Amanda C.,"Orange, CA",0,3,1,5.0,10/31/2016,"Just tried the curbside pick up for the first time and I was super impressed! Online order was very user friendly and simple, called when I arrived and it was brought out to my car within 2 minutes. Jay was very friendly and even double checked to make sure we got everything we needed - amazing customer service, Jay! We will definitely be ordering curbside again - so convenient and easy!"
Chris W.,"Tustin, CA",0,4,,5.0,4/28/2016,Been going here for almost three years now.   Great food and beers.  The dining staff is excellent.   Only complaint would be the to go staff acting indifferent at times.   Definitely recommend this place
Vaibhav V.,"Irvine, CA",110,106,,3.0,3/4/2015,"The only reason why BJ's is a significantly frequent evening destination is because of the great vibes and the pizookies -- a simple and elegant dessert invention. I have been here around ten times due to everything from birthdays to team bonding events. It does the job but doesn't hit the spot.  I recommend the chicken jambalaya and the cajun pasta -- both filled with flavor and well-cooked. Try the deep-dish pizza, as those are rare in Southern California. The barbecue pizza is meh and lacks the flavor to continue onward after two slices. Of course, don't leave BJ's without a pizookie."
David D.,"Tustin, CA",186,19,16,3.0,10/7/2014,"Ehh, compared to a lot of other BJ's I've been to, this location has the worst service.  You don't get that usual friendly warm welcome from the staff as you do with the other locations.  I only go here for convenience but would much rather visit the BJ's in Huntington Beach, Orange or even Puente Hills if they weren't so far. The food is consistent with all other BJ's so I won't spend too much time reviewing the food.  I will note though, that 2 out of 3 visits here (when I actually ordered food instead of just getting drinks at the bar) I had some sort of misfortune.  First time (back when they still had the marina meatballs) they forgot to order it so it took 45 minutes for it to come out.  Second time the bartenders were changing shifts and forgot to order our spinach and artichoke dip so the new bartender had to re-order it for us.  On that same visit, there was hair in our pizza between the cheese and the sauce.  Granted, they took care of the spinach artichoke dip for us, but no love for the hair in our pizza?  Just a ""sorry about that.""  I wouldn't expect to them to take care of it since we ate most of the pizza before finding the hair, but at least a more genuine or sincere apology would've sufficed. Overall, if you've never been to a BJ's before and this is the only one within reach, I wouldn't stop you from coming here.  I would, however, suggest going to another location if you're looking for outstanding service."
Allyson S.,"Costa Mesa, CA",202,3,1,1.0,9/13/2016,"My sister and I have been coming to eat here a few times a month for a couple of years now and have experienced this problem twice now, so I felt it was time to say something. We sat in the bar area because we were going to order off of the happy hour menu. After sitting for 5-10 minutes without any service, our server, Bonnie, finally came up to the table and very coldly asked us for our order with no smile or anything. She rarely came back to the table and each time she did, my sister and I were shocked at how rude she was. Not sure if we will be dining here again, but if you come in to eat, steer clear of Bonnie!"
Mary J.,"San Pedro, CA",39,23,3,2.0,10/23/2016,"We ordered delivery last night through grubhub (I already posted the same review through them too). We were in the area visiting friends and decided to order food to our hotel. Our kids had been running around all day and we knew they were too tired to be able to go out to eat and behave even moderately well. So, we ordered from BJs. I placed the order at 5:50 and the delivery time was showing 60-70 minutes. We didn't get our food until almost 8pm, after we called the restaurant and they flagged down their delivery guy. The order was incomplete and was missing an appetizer, the food was cold and it took 2 hours to get to us. The total order was over $130 for 4 adults and 2 kids meals. It was a pretty big let down and the added joy of hungry young kids crying for the hour it was late icing on the cake. I'm not sure if it's the restaurant or grubhub who employ the delivery drivers (or if it is the fault of the delivery person or the restaurant), but either way it's a representation of your brand and it was significantly lacking."
Hazel M.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,29,5,3.0,3/6/2016,"3 stars because ever other time I've come here it's been a good experience. I would rank the actually restaurant at 5 stars but NOT the service we got last night. My friends and I came here came here last night ad had the worst waitress. Natalie? She had such a bad attitude and would throw around sly remarks when she could. We didn't get a single smile out of her. How Rude. I've worked in customer service before and I know how you're supposed to act. We had to send back 2 pastas because they weren't great, so coincidentally our pazooki took 45 minutes to bake, and was extremely dry..hmm....unfortunately her unnecessary attitude out a damper on my best friend's birthday."
James L.,"Garden Grove, CA",1106,935,1830,3.0,4/16/2013,"Decent Happy Hour- probably doesn't trump Lazy Dog or Yardhouse for me though. Among the things I tried, I would get the mini pizza again. The spinach artichoke dip wasn't that good; nor were the sliders. I was disappointed by the boneless hot wings... they looked like shriveled up version of McDonald nuggets. I can commend the service being on top of their game all night- that was the saving grace. I would come here if you don't have picky taste buds."
Jennifer Q.,"Tustin, CA",782,364,373,2.0,8/13/2014,"so ive been here a few times and finally decided to write a review on this location. for the most part i have had good experiences with staff and wait times, but during happy hour times at the self seating area there is trouble with getting servers to come check in on us and take our orders. i have had multiple good experiences with having huge groups coming here to eat and being seated promptly and taken care of but usually only with big groups. ill be honest i havent had the best experiences here but its not a terrible location. but lets get down to the important stuff... the food: -Cheese & Tomato Large Pizza ($15.25): thought because it was so simple it wouldnt be good but oh boy.... DELICIOUS highly recommend because the crust is delicious and everything else tastes so yummy on this!!! -Pizookie ($5.95): it was okay but i dont think these are worth the hype. i do prefer the chocolate flavor over the others and i mean if you are going to try this then get the chocolate flavor -Classic Burger ($8.95): thought i could not go wrong with a simple, basic burger but i had a weird tasting burger. the meat was flavored very strange and overall was not good... DONT GET IT -Spaghetti with Marinara Sauce ($9.95): TERRIBLE! im a sucker for basic marinara sauce pastas and this was the worst!! im not sure if its the sauce or just idk it was not good... DONT GET! -Happy Hour Sliders ($5): simple, delicious, and lives up to the standard slider. for five bucks you get three (i believe) simple sliders with cheese and a side of fries to go with it. i would get this again! overall.... if you crave BJs then go here but i prefer to head to different chain restaurants unless its for the happy hour or pizzas!"
Nancy M.,"Westminster, CA",37,33,3,3.0,10/9/2015,Sometimes service is great sometimes it's like the servers don't care. I notice the ones in the green apron are more assertive and attentive then the ones in the other apron. Why don't I just ask for a server in a green apron next time just to have good service. Food is okay. Spinach dip isn't that great. Too much cheese. The deep dish pizzas are my favorite. Happy hour is fun there. Decent price drinks and food $6-$9 for drinks and food.
Sam T.,"Brea, CA",0,48,4,2.0,10/4/2014,"The food was phenomenal as always, however, I was very disappointed by the service. I've frequented BJ's over the years and this was my first time at this location. The hostesses seemed very flustered and didn't even bother greeting us.  We ordered a deep dish buffalo chicken pizza. Our server had placed our plates on top of the stand for the pizza... Later, when a different server brought our pizza out she just stood there staring at us. We didn't realize that the plates were in her way. She could have asked us to move them but chose to stare at us until we got the point.  Our server's shift ended and he introduced us to our new server. She did not refill our water once and barely said 2 words to us. When she brought our check she dropped it on the table without even glancing in our direction.  I will say that the food and drinks were great but I will not be returning to this location due to the lack of hospitality."
Catherine L.,"Irvine, CA",6,81,106,3.0,1/30/2016,"Came in with a 17 people reservation. The place was extremely packed with students from a school event so I guess that was why the two pasta dishes we ordered were both extremely undercooked. Regardless, the service and pizookies were on point as always so the visit was enjoyable nonetheless."
Shannon M.,"Oceanside, CA",26,8,,1.0,11/15/2015,"It's literally killing me to give this place the minimum 1 star in order to post the review. That 1 star will go to the waiter, who was calm throughout our horrible experience. Calamari? Undercooked, giant blob of crap. Artichoke hearts? Overlooked and they tasted like they were cooked in old oil. Root bear wings were decent but the celery was old, water loved and the tops of the stalk (who eats that?). Oh, and then came the pizza...complete with the hair. I couldn't take any more. I got up and walked out while the GM was trying to defend the horrible food. I will never come to this BJ's again."
Walter M.,"Oceanside, CA",1865,1608,606,3.0,7/10/2014,"Some companies get it and others don't. Some things are convenient and others not so much. As many of you know BJ's can be hit or miss in terms of wait/service. Case in point. I've literally come during a rush and been told 30 minute wait, driven to another BJ's 30 miles away and been seated and eating before my friends who I left there was. That's the kind of massive discrepancies you'll find at some BJ's. It's very area and time dependent. As an early adopter I'm all over online ordering, mobile apps and of course rewards programs. Chipotle gets it, easy, fast, quick to navigate, accurate, convenient. BJ's online ordering is the exact opposite. Their large menu is not intuitive, it's not fast, it's accurate, but when you pull up into curb side and call in, maybe they pick up, maybe they don't. Maybe the ticket on your foot says 21 minutes before pick up and maybe your food comes out 14 minutes late. Maybe you eventually come inside and see the dining room pretty empty. Who knows. I haven't and certainly don't have the time to track and document the rushes here, but I can tell you if you want to get back to work in a reasonable hour and think that curbside or ordering ahead will work. It will not. As with most BJ's the food is solid. You can't really complain as their menu selection is good and they have solid items and great beer pairings. It's not a sports bar despite their full bar and TV's and dark wood. It's not the cheesecake factory with their way too big a menu and lack of more salt of the earth items. My go to items are the avocado egg rolls and santa fe spring rolls, balance, bold and I like the avo cream sauce for both, when fresh are excellent appetizers, seared ahi tuna salad and a cocktail or craft beer. Don't expect too much local, but I'm a fan of their Tatonka stout. They have a very middle eastern seaboard brewing style across their in house offerings. Love the craft root beer, but too bad it's not free refills. Nothing is overly hopped (except Hopstorm), seasoned, roasted or IBU'd so it's a basic, but full offering. Service is ok, it's pretty good when you come here late or early, but in between, forget about it. Staff is very polite and usually apologetic so I generally sit at the bar for faster more attentive service. Classic dark wood, wall window ambiance. I dig the gluten free menu options and the small bites offerings. Spinach stuffed mushrooms have tons of flavor packed in single bite sized eats. Baked, not fried. Fried artichoke hearts with just lemon are just fine, no need for aioli aka mayonnaise. Don't get the mac and cheese, it's a kinds of failure. Something about the mixture of meats and cheese for a deep dish really separates the supreme pepperoni from the  veggie options. The classic is ideal for the sausage. It's maybe kinda close to the style they do in Chicago, but very corporatized. Burgers are ok, tons of fries, but it ain't no red robin, they need work. Higher heat, better meat mixture, the burgers are well put together. I prefer the pork chops over the steaks because honestly if it aint prime steak it's not worthy. The pork chops are almost never dry and it's a hearty meal. Spaghetti and meat sauce are pretty solid a backup when carb loading. Appetizers are pretty large in general and shareable which is why the small bites are so good for those who eat alone. Pizookie is excellent, even to go. A must try is the salted caramel with the extra caramel sauce. Literally this 1 item is the saving grace to an otherwise mediocre restaurant. I'll keep coming back for that alone, love the 3 pack, but a variety sampler of all would be great, sure you can do it on your own, but ordering is a pain online like this. They are open late so your ideal is for people who get out of work late or those looking to wind down with a nightcap, but more often than not the experience will keep them mediocre."
Rachel D.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",0,7,,5.0,9/18/2016,"We went here for my friends birthday and had the best service ever! Our servers name was Kelly and she really cared that we had a good experience. She  was very attentive, extremely friendly, and answered my many questions. My friends and I come about three times a month, we are going to ask for Kelly every time."
Jennifer L.,"Long Beach, CA",135,10,,1.0,8/18/2014,"Pass on this overpriced waste of time! They messed up my order, made us wait for our food for 20 mins. No bread nothing! No water refills and messed up on the bill (charged for two drinks and only ordered one).  You think we would have at least gotten a free cookie for dessert! 1 salad, 1 burger, 1 soup and 1 soda = $45 And the food was bland, greasy and left a rancid aftertaste in my mouth!"
Harrison C.,"Irvine, CA",0,10,,5.0,3/18/2016,"My family and I come here on a regular basis, and we are never disappointed with the food or the service! Staff members are super friendly and often check on customers to see if they are satisfied with the food and have everything they need. Whoever the chefs are, I am happy to give them huge compliments for the great food! I have tried the Jambalaya (my favorite!!!), the Southern Fried Chicken, grilled chicken, some burgers, salmon w/quinoa, and some items in the lite menu, and I am always satisfied with the seasoning and cooking. The crispy brussel sprouts are a nice starter as well... So addicted! This is one of the best BJs I have been to, it keeps me coming back for more! I have never tried any drinks since I do not, but I have eaten with friends who were more than satisfied with their drinks. Beer and cider are definitely their specialty when it comes to drinks. A great place to stop by for a satisfying meal with family or friends!"
Yash M.,"Fullerton, CA",201,69,32,3.0,2/21/2015,"Ok. Gave it a shot to give them another try. Walked in at 11:20 pm. Hope, thats not an issue coz they are open till 1am. Been over an hour . Ordered 2 appetizers and 2 beers.2 beers came right away.. ( money maker ) 1 appetizer (chicken wings) came 35 mins after. The other appetizer (stuffed mushrooms) not to be found over an hour  . Not looking good."
Elizabeth B.,"Orange, CA",2,32,14,5.0,9/7/2015,Natalie was our waitress and she was wonderful ! She kept our drinks refilled and our food was hot when it came .
Steven U.,"Honolulu, HI",1031,244,1843,3.0,10/17/2013,"Went to BJs with friends.  This is the closest one to my house so this is the one I go to the most.  I wouldn't say I am a regular, but I am a huge fan of chicago style pizza.  There is no real substitute for pizza from Chicago, but sometimes it subsides the craving. This BJs is pretty much a machine.  Moving people to their seats, feeding them...getting them out.  Service is usually pretty quick and food is usually good.  I normally get BJs favorite.  Texture is good and ingredients are usually prety fresh tasting. No real complaints. 3 stars"
