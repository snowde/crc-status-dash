Taylor M.,"Tustin, CA",110,3,,5.0,9/12/2015,I came to bjs tonight with a bunch of my friends and Stephanie L took care of us and she was so awesome ! She's one of best servers there ! I'll definitely ask for her next time I go.
Jeff M.,"Orange, CA",19,513,2,4.0,11/27/2014,We went to BJ's to watch the UCLA vs USC game this past weekend..place was very crowded and full of energy.  We both ordered off the light menu...I had the Mediterranean Chicken Pita tacos while my friend had the turkey burger.  Both were very yummy...especially given they were relatively healthy.  Give this place a try....nice place to watch your favorite team and I hear the pizza (deep dish) is good.
Lauren N.,"Irvine, CA",58,33,21,4.0,1/9/2014,"Happy waiters, variety of food, great cocktails, and of course... Pizookies.  I usually only come once or twice a year but I discovered they had peppermint icecream and have been going to get Oreo Pizookies with that on top with friends. There is usually a wait but I've always been able to find room in the bar which serves the full menu, too!"
Paul A.,"Stanton, CA",28,8,38,2.0,8/2/2014,"I am giving 2 stars for this reason. ....we  had placed our order (given that we did take a while to order..) and still waited 1 hour for our food. We finally spoke to the manager (Scott) and we advised him of situation (meanwhile Ray fell asleep), and he jumped in and handled the issue. I am not sure if i'll come back to this place, but if I did, it would be because of Scott. If waited on by jessica, I will leave and never come back. Good note, the food was goood especially the bison bbq burger."
Robert F.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",0,50,50,1.0,10/9/2015,"We love BJ's, but like all food establishments, CONSISTENCY is the name of the game. We have met some of the corporate guys (over the years) whose job it is to make sure each restaurant is following the corporate formula. Today, I ordered the PORTOBELLO and MUSHROOM SWISS burger, NO BUN. At the Tustin store, it was pathetic-looking on the metal tray. Not at all appealing, as it arrived at the table. At the Laguna Hills BJ's it looked great (the way it was presented), with the sides (lettuce, tomato, etc) neatly placed in the corner, the two sauces in a little metal serving pods and the burger, with a good-sized mushroom on top. At the Tustin store, it looked like someone threw it on a plate as an afterthought and no side sauces."
Jaqueline Y.,"Tustin, CA",429,273,334,4.0,1/9/2013,"I'm a fan! I've gotten great service at this particular BJ's, and was even comped my meal on NYE when I received less than stellar service. We usually order The Great White, which is a nice creamy Alfredo pizza with mushrooms, tomatoes and grilled chicken. My absolute favorite appetizer is the mini-Bruschetta. I don't even like tomatoes, but BJ's makes this dish so well.  Over the holidays, BJ's had a 2 for $20 special - 2 soups/salads, one medium pizza and one pizookie. We chose a half/half concoction for our pizza: The Great White & the Bacon Cheeseburger. Bacon Cheeseburger was surprisingly good. The only thing I would say is that it's a bit heavy compared to the rest of the pizzas at BJ's. Another time we went, we chose half/half of The Great White and the Buffalo Chicken. I have to say, this is now one of my favorite pizza combos ever. The Buffalo Chicken was so good - the pizza was drizzled with just the right amount of ranch and buffalo sauce (not overpowering at all), topped with diced celery and grilled chicken. The diced celery gave the pizza the perfect crunch and texture, I was in love from bite number 1.  As for appetizers, we've tried the clam chowder soup, the broccoli cheddar soup, tortilla soup and Caesar salad here. Everything is great, but soups are a little too salty. Tortilla soup is presented in an awesome way, with the toppings served in a bowl and soup poured over at the table. Pizookies are always great - my favorite remains the original chocolate chip cookie, but the Oreo and Triple Chocolate are yummy as well. If you ever need to take your pizookie to-go, let your server know and they'll have the kitchen bake your cookie in a tin pan for your convenience! Love it!"
Sa N.,"Lower Peters Canyon, CA",5,2,,1.0,2/21/2016,"I had a terrible experience: NEVER BOOK HERE FOR ANYTHING. They messed up on our reservations, took 40 min to prepare the food, did not provide us utensils before we got our food, and our group was eventually separated. Never COMING back again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Asraa A.,"Irvine, CA",6,11,17,1.0,8/29/2015,"Worst service ever, we came with party of 15 including kids. The front desk girl after making us wait for 20 mins she took our party outside when it's 95 degree outside,  also when no one else from.entire restaurant was sitting. Bad"
Chapsim N.,"Newport Beach, CA",1,41,6,1.0,2/23/2015,"It pains me to leave this comment but after so many issues I had too.  Over the past year the service and quality of food has declined immensely in the past year. I've been an avid customer since this location first opened. The accuracy of our orders are never correct which is severely unfortunate due to the number of food allergies we have.  Calling in is a waste of time , not one person of the staff truly cares ."
Kevin K.,"Irvine, CA",1,13,1,5.0,3/25/2015,Well I do not post many reviews unless exceptional service was provided...or if it's something really worth posting.   PRO - As for this review I must say that the one thing that makes us come back each time is the pasta and pizza and the great service that Bonnie provides on a consistent basis.  She remembers our names and even how we like our orders when we return... Thanks Bonnie for provided such great friendly personalized service! CON - As for the waits sometime it's so crowded it's not worth a 45+ wait so avoid it on the weekends and or if a major sporting event is on if you want to get in and out. Possible Suggestion for Management -maybe consider better weekday sun pm - thur pms happy hour prices and times.... You have tapas the new brewery coming and they will give you a run for the money if you don't do something to lower the wait times and your rewards program needs to lower their limits and or should include total bill price towards rewards.  Also your front doors should be adjusted to open easier for all guest.  Overall thank you for a great place to eat in the market place.
Rayne L.,"Fountain Valley, CA",44,10,,5.0,1/25/2015,"I didn't eat at this location, but I just ordered take-out and I was so impressed I had to say something to someone about my experience.  The staff was super friendly and even though the kitchen was obviously busy they made it a point to check on special items I was looking to add to my order. Both of the people behind the counter were helpful and kind, they allowed me to add sides that weren't ""normal"" options (an extra piece of beer battered fish). When I thanked them for being awesome, I was met with a thank you, followed by a statement (from the guy behind the counter) about customer service being his job. I explained why I felt the need to tell him and his coworker that they rock, we laughed, and it was good.  Also, this location is the only one in the area that offers bottled beer for sale. I love that I can come here to get my favorite beers that they make.  I will absolutely be returning here to get take out, eat in, and generally enjoy myself. This is my new favorite location!"
Jeff L.,"Newport Beach, CA",22,271,2059,3.0,10/13/2013,Good BBQ chopped salad Pizza isn't as hearty as it used to be and a little on the bready side Boneless wings were good though smallish on the portion side.
Krystal N.,"Irvine, CA",92,571,5,3.0,11/13/2015,A-OK! I came here for a birthday dinner and had an enjoyable experience. I got the kale and roasted brussels sprout salad which was actually really good! Service was good too. All the food and drinks came out seamlessly and she pretty much knew how to split the checks by section without asking. BJs is generally a crowd-pleaser for large groups and this one is no different.
Kayla L.,"Orange County, CA",125,254,51,2.0,4/9/2013,"Food was alright but the SERVICE was what really made me never want to come back here.  We were seated pretty fast, but our server never handed us any napkins, no utensils, and when we asked for things it seemed like she completely forgot about us and we had to flag her down. One of my friends was using his piece of bread as a fork because he didn't have anything else. Sad, sad, sad.  This place is so loud, too. Talking to other people at the same table I was sitting at was near impossible we should have just resorted to texting each other. They need to get some much better service out on the floor because the only reason I keep coming back here is probably because I look forward to ordering a pazookie."
Bonnie T.,"Rockaway Beach, OR",7,17,4,5.0,12/23/2015,Seating was terrible but all else was excellent!  Our waitress was the funniest waitress I've ever had.  I love her and her sky diving story!  She made the night!
Joyce G.,"Irvine, CA",6,4,,1.0,8/25/2016,"Very poor customer service from the front check in counter. Whoever was working as Hostess on the front desk around 12-12:30 on August 25th should not be working that position. I understand hostess doesn't cover the bar area but if she could see a booth open up there and ask the person who seats people to hold the booth, she surly could have told those waiting for a booth that one was available if they wanted to seat themselves. Then when asked what why she had a smirky smile just repeating they don't seat bar area. Doesn't make sense. Left and went to another restaurant. I had been eating here on a pretty regular basis and a member of their Premier Rewards but that kind of service and attitude I don't need."
Sara P.,"Irvine, CA",243,577,248,4.0,5/31/2011,I have been to this location 2x for the happy hour. I'm in love with the Nutty Brunette Brew.. YUMMMMM They are usually pretty busy for happy hour and the quicker you can get in the better.  The ahi appetizer is amazing! The last time we got a mini pizza that was soooo yummy and mushroom tops.  They have great HH prices and the servers are always really friendly.
Larry L.,"Tustin, CA",136,123,751,4.0,7/25/2014,"I like bj's , they are solid and service is good. Happy hour is a good deal if u come early and get good seats, this location i font like the layout, better the one at block of orange. The flat bread pizza) california  is good and no too much dought, Gin and Tonic is tanquerai"
Andrew L.,"Irvine, CA",62,17,,2.0,7/31/2016,"Disappointed.  We have come to BJ's a few times because it is close to where we live.  I usually get the pizza.  Nothing fancy.  Tomato and Cheese.  The last few times, the pizza is just not that good.  A bit burned on the top and not much cheese.  The cheese just doesn't look appetizing.  I love deep dish pizza. I used to go to a place in the valley called Numero Uno.  My mother-in-law also got a regular salad.  It was almost all greens. There was slim to no tomato or even carrot.  What's going on.  It's always busy but I am just not impressed anymore with the food."
Ly L.,"Orange County, CA",19,75,369,2.0,2/18/2013,"1. Cold fries 2. New fries were drenched in oil. Not oily. Drenched.  3. What kind of BBQ chicken pizza doesn't have BBQ sauce?  I only give this place 2 stars because our bartender worked his butt off that busy night, and he did a great job."
