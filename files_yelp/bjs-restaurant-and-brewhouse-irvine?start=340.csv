Cindy L.,"Los Angeles, CA",401,663,2002,4.0,2/11/2013,"This review is for their happy hour! I get off work late and I'm always hungry ... so I always ask ""what's there to eat late at night around irvine?!"" I decided to give BJ's a try! Happy hr: Mon-Fri 3-7pm & Sun-Thurs 10pm-close I ordered the Spinach & Artichoke dip. It was a happy hour portion so it wasn't too big but the ooey gooey of the warm cheese with spinach and artichoke was off the wall served with the colored tortilla chips.  Also got deep dish mini pizza and tried the Chicken Bacon Ranch (it's a new one) and I was anticipating a creamy ranch sauce but instead it was a little dry and very bread-y. But then again it was deep dish so what do I expect ... $6 for a mini pizza. Not that worth it in my opinion but originally it's 10.95 so it's a good deal.  Service was excellent. Server was really good about getting our drinks, order, and bill in a timely manner. I also really like the lighting of the place. Way more lit than Yardhouse & TGI Fridays during their happy hours."
Carol B.,"Anaheim, CA",0,26,,2.0,6/4/2015,"Used to love BJ's for their Chopped (Cobb) Salad. A year or two ago they took it off the menu, but you could still order it. Last time we went there I couldn't even order it. What restaurant doesn't serve a Cobb Salad? Very disappointing. I won't be going back."
Katie N.,"Irvine, CA",1,8,2,1.0,4/20/2014,"I've been coming to this BJ's for years and I've never experienced any major problems with service or food. In fact, I would have given 4 or 5 stars, but my visit two weeks ago was enough to knock all those stars off.  We came on a Tuesday night as a party of 12 for a birthday celebration. To start, we were nicely accommodated considering we had so many people arriving at different times and we hadn't made a reservation. We had a nice table on the patio outside, and we ordered drinks, appetizers, and food without a problem. We even got a complimentary pizookie for the birthday boy! Our servers were adequately attentive despite our party size and disorganization.  Everything was fine, and when the check came out, I was really happy with how the main server was working with us. She told me that we could write numbers next to each of our individual orders so she could split the master check into smaller checks to bring back for each of us. How nice was that?? The glaring problem began when one of my friends handed her credit card directly to our server to pay and never got it back. It was nearing closing time and we waited around for a bit, everyone got back their cards and signed off on their checks, and we were still missing one card.  We decided to ask our servers what was going on, and they were confused, as if they had never received that card. They went to look for it; the main waitress came back a couple of times to tell us she'd had no luck finding it.  Now, I understand that large parties can be more challenging to take care of. It was extremely kind of our server to even offer to split our bill with that numbering method. I understand that mistakes happen. But every time this server came back to our table to give us the bad news, she didn't seem apologetic in the least. In fact, she acted like it was one of our faults that the card couldn't be found. Maybe it was the fact that it was now well past closing and she wanted to clean up and go home, but her attitude was completely unprofessional. I was surprised that the manager didn't even come out to address such a big problem.  The waitress essentially told us to pay that portion of the bill because we hadn't given her the card, and that my friend could call back in the morning to see if it had turned up. Talk about a buzzkill for an otherwise good night! Oh yeah, and after my friend had already cancelled her card, BJ's found it the next day in one of the check books, just as she remembered giving it to our server. Maybe the waitress just wasn't in the mood to look very carefully that night.  I can't say I'll be coming back any time soon."
Enio D.,"Kaneohe, HI",7,8,,2.0,7/24/2016,"Service is poor, once the food is served hard to get someone. The portions are big, but uninspired at best. The pizookie is good."
Jesus V.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",118,86,41,2.0,4/24/2014,Not a fan. I came with my roommates and the server was rude and incompetent. Another server had to come and bring the check after a long time of waiting.  The only good thing was the piece of pizza we got while waiting to be seated. Probably won't be coming back any time soon.
Kristina M.,"Tustin, CA",538,76,39,4.0,4/11/2014,"This is my favorite BJ's location! Tonight I went with my two boys (6 & 8). We were seated right away, but it was still early for a Friday night. The waiter was helpful. The boys got Pizza and Grilled Chicken. The sticky rice was done perfectly! I got the Santa Fe Salad. Delicious! They do offer an allergy menu, if you ask in the front. It has all the main menu items marked with the top allergens. This makes my life SO much easier, although it is a limited selection. Also, they now have a Gluten Free Pizookie!!! Yippee!! I'm not going to lie...that's why we come. :)"
Jon T.,"Fremont, CA",937,879,43,3.0,7/8/2012,"Came here on a Friday night with some friends to get some drinks/food/desert. We had a party of 7 and were sat very quickly which was great! however that's pretty much where the good service end. While our server was NICE he was not a good server, he checked on us very rarely and we waited FOREVER for all our orders to come out. it wasn't until we had to wave him down and told him to cancel our orders that he said that they were almost done and he'd bring it out.  and the place wasn't even that busy when we went so i really don't see how he could have been so occupied with other things. Still had a good time though, but the pizza here wasn't as good compared to the other BJs pizza's i've had before, we had the ranch chicken one and it was VERY bland, not sure if it was because of the lack of sauce or what but i felt like i was eating white bread..."
Jasmine C.,"Northern, VA",0,101,6,3.0,6/22/2016,"Ordered for curbside pickup at 11:00. Arrived at 11:05, phone rang for over 60 seconds before someone answered and tried to put me on hold without even letting me speak. I was then disconnected and had to call back. Food didn't come out until 11:14, and it was the wrong order. Sat waiting until 11:19. Didnt leave til 11:22. The food earns the 3 stars. Service gets 0 stars. What kind of restaurant lets you leave with this kind of experience without any attempt at restitution?"
Christine M.,"Fullerton, CA",0,1,,1.0,7/18/2016,WORST SERVICE EVER. Each time I come to pick up my take out no one is ever at the desk to help me out. AND no one is ever at the front desk at the entrance to greet any of the guests.
Stephen P.,"Los Angeles, CA",154,1103,2803,3.0,5/1/2011,"3.5 stars A major upgrade from my last visit. Where to go on a late Sat night for a casual drinks and food? BJs is a great option. It's not too packed at 11.30pm, nor a graveyard shift.  How much would you expect to pay for 2 specialty beers (stout and Piranah), 2 appetizers (slightly bland, but spicy advocado egg rolls and can't go wrong with chicken buffalo wings...stingy on the celery sticks) and a dessert (fruit burst crumble; not too sweet and a la mode with cheap vanilla ice-cream)?  The bill was $38 + tip and we were stuffed. May be skip the dessert next time ;)"
Qui C.,"Huntington Beach, CA",730,844,191,4.0,8/17/2010,"***Happy Hour Review*** For some reason, Bj's is always so freaking packed! Luckily for us, we found 3 empty stools at the bar and our bartender was very attentive and nice. He explained the happy hour and recommended some good appetizers.  Happy Hour: $1 off cocktails and drafts $2 off appetizers 50% off mini pizzas 50% wine on Tuesdays Great White mini pizza - This is their most popular pizza and i totally see why. It's creamy, flavorful, delicious without being overwhelming. It seriously tasted like a plate of pasta but perfect in every sense. 5 stars Pizookie Trio - we got Chocolate Chunk, Triple Chocolate and Peanut Butter. The Triple Chocolate was good the first 1-2 bites, after that, it becomes too much! My gfs and I love chocolate too but damn, that's intense. The peanut butter was good, had real chunks of peanuts and that gave it a nice crunch. The chocolate chunk was the best, BEST! LOVE THEIR PIZOOKIES :)"
Natalee O.,"Temecula, CA",132,27,84,3.0,6/5/2013,"Great service!! Friendly staff. Except for the super quiet hostess. Could barely understand what she was saying to us as we walked to the table.  I ordered the Mini Deep-Dish Mediterranean Pizza. Ohhh my goodness. It was sooo delicious. Would probably taste a lot better if it wasn't sitting out before I got it. It was not even hot. It was on the border of cold and warm.  My dad's dish came out warm. He ordered the shrimp tacos. But he said he didn't like the tortillas, I guess they were too hard. So he just ate everything in the tacos lol.  The only thing we enjoyed in the meal was the chocolate chip pizookie. At least that came out hot. As always, it was sooo good. Just melted in my mouth."
Rosemary T.,"Tustin, CA",533,677,2406,4.0,11/27/2010,"Pizza, pizzoki and chicken wings are the three best things here.  I always have to get the spinach and artichoke pizza when I'm here!  And, it's always macadamia nuts and white chocolate pizzoki, buddilicious.  If I'm extremely hungry that day, i would add a side of hot wings as appetizer.  But, I try to get my wings at Buffalo Wild Wings, the best wing place EVER existed.    The best time to come is Monday through Friday from 3:00 ~ 6:00pm.  You get HALF PRICE on all pizza, $1.00 off for appetizers, and $2.00 off for drinks.  Imagine paying only $5.00 for a mini pizza instead of the regular $10.00, oh yeah!  Best deal EVER ^^"
Schel H.,"Greater Los Angeles, CA",658,1756,1544,4.0,5/2/2012,"Ok something I wont often admit... I am a fan of this particular chain. I am a fan of BJs for a few reasons; service, beer, and grub. But this location was a fun meetup for a lunch with my parents. So The munchkin, my parents and I were relaxing and having a great meal. But this place has some great things going for it IMHO. Plentiful free parking, clean facility, well trained staff, big tv's all over showing all the games... Ok now onto the food.  PRO TIP #1: The craft root beer is outstanding if its a fresh keg, if not its flat and bleh. Alright I have had almost everything you can imagine from this place: *Pizza Deep Dish 4.5 stars *Lettuce Wraps 4 stars *light menu porkchops 6 out of 5 stars (ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS and its under 600 calories) *pizookie 4.5 stars *burger 3 stars *craft root beer fresh keg 5 stars *craft root beer old keg 0 stars *craft beer depends on which one but they all seem pretty tasty to me *the munchkin almost always gets the mac n cheese  *the munchkin loves the happy face fries like nobody's business PRO TIP #2 You can get craft beer swag (T's, glasses, etc) if you want to. Service at this location has always been a 4 star kinda deal...  I can just say that this place is really tasty and that I have always enjoyed coming here. Perhaps I will see you here sometime."
Nick D.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",119,72,49,3.0,11/4/2014,"Never a good start wen you sit at the bad and it takes at least 5 mins for the bartender to acknowledge you, and a few mins later to get a water and a menu. I understand they are busy and all, but still."
Katie B.,"Irvine, CA",27,233,,2.0,4/26/2014,"This is my least favorite BJ's location. I've been here 3 or 4 times. The enclosed patio is always loud, and it's hard to have a conversation. The service is slow, and usually unfriendly. The menus are dirty and sticky, as are the tables. While the food is on par with other locations', I'd avoid this one."
Erika K.,"Fresno, CA",2,24,22,1.0,5/30/2016,"Just left BJ's with my family. Service: Very poor service. In the beginning we waited a while but then the manager came to take our drink orders because the server was ""busy."" After waiting a while longer our server finally came to take our orders. We were very patient until it got to a point where it was taking too long to receive our appetizers. After 45 minutes, we asked if they can please check on our food and it FINALLY came later. The appetizers came with the entrees and we were waiting for plates so we could eat... After realizing she wasn't gonna bring it, we asked for plates. We sent back the calamari because the batter was sooo greasy and bitter. We asked for ketchup many times for our French fries, and we received  it when we were almost done eating it. Even though service was bad, I thought maybe the manager would come apologize. Nope.. I was wrong. He was busy making jokes with the servers. The kitchen staff was bringing the food out to the tables, and everyone around us was frustrated because of how slow and bad service was.  Overall, they need to train their servers and managers because this was ridiculous. If the server came  and let us know that the kitchen was backed up, we would've  understood. But they never checked up on us and only gave attitude. At the end of our meal, a different server came and cleaned our table and brought the check. We will not return to this location again."
John N.,"Irvine, CA",2,7,,1.0,11/28/2015,"When you need a steak knife to cut your pancakes.  Fail.  But the server was great. Seriously though, do they make the pancakes with plastic flower?  Don't go here for breakfast, unless you are teething."
Hannah C.,"New York, NY",557,398,1013,5.0,8/11/2014,One of my favorite parts about this restaurant is the service. Every waiter we've gotten has been so nice and so welcoming. The food is always good and the place is always lively; people either dressed up for a fancy dinner or a family dinner. I love the versatility of this place!
Geeyoung L.,"Irvine, CA",60,243,451,3.0,9/5/2014,"I came with a party of 7 for lunch on a Friday. We ordered 3 of the 2 for $22 special which includes 2 soup or salads, 1 medium pizza, and 1 pizookie.  We got the lobster bisque, caesar salad, and clam chowder soups. The lobster bisque did not taste very good, and was definitely not a favorite to any of us. The caesar salad had pieces of brown lettuce all over in it, and it was drenched in salty caesar dressing. We were pretty disgusted at the lettuce. The clam chowder soup was the best out of the three, but it was very salty.  For the pizza, we got the Great White, BBQ Pizza, and half Buffalo/ half BJ's Favorite. The Great White pizza was very bland, I couldn't taste the alfredo sauce at all. Most of us didn't really like the Great White pizza and were disappointed. The BBQ pizza was very bland as well. The flavors were dull. The BJ's Favorite tasted just like a combination pizza from any place. The buffalo pizza was probably our favorite out of the four, although it was very salty. It was somewhat spicy, and had a ton of celery on top.  After, we got 3 pizookies - the peanut butter, cookies and cream, and salty caramel. I asked for the peanut butter smores pizookie, but the waitress brought out the peanut butter one, so I just kept it.  The best part of the meals were definitely the pizookies. Although they're really sweet, they were tasty.  The service of this place was horrible. We constantly asked them for water, more coffee, etc. but they did not come back for the longest time, forgetting what we asked for. It was pretty frustrating trying to get them to bring what we asked for since they kept forgetting. I let them go for bringing the wrong pizookie out, but this just shows how uncaring the waiters were.  I would rate this place overall of 2.5, but I'm rounding up."
