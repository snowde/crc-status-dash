Michelle L.,"Irvine, CA",1223,1104,161,4.0,5/15/2012,"I like BJ's. There's nothing that bad about this place. I've been coming to BJ's for years now and while I don't love it any more than I did a few years ago, I don't love it any less. It's one of those places that stays consistent and that is what I like about it.  BJ's has a pretty wide variety of food. It's not going to be the BEST thing you eat, but it's tasty and will fill you up. It's also open late, and has a nice atmosphere. And if you're like my boyfriend and need to be in front of a tv during a game, they will change the channel for you. So it's a good thing all around.  I've tried a lot of things on their menu and everything tastes pretty good so go ahead and order whatever you desire.  Their pizza is probably the safest choice. Or the burgers. BUT...if you're like me, you're not at BJ's for the food. You're there for the PIZOOKIE. Just get it. I don't care if you're full. GET A PIZOOKIE. It will make your life 10 times better and you'll be left scraping at the bottom of the pan for more. Delicious!!! God I need a Pizookie right now. 4/5"
Jamie B.,"Irvine, CA",3,20,,3.0,10/2/2015,"I have frequented this BJs probably over one hundred times. This by far is the worst service I have ever had. Yes, it's a busy Friday night. However, basics like taking my menu after I order, refilling my drink when it's empty, and giving us plates to eat from when you bring us a pizza are basics. Very disappointed. Also, being quoted 20-25 minutes, then waiting for 40 is not great customer service. Only giving 3 stars because my gluten free pizza was good."
Kim T.,"Orange County, CA",1156,1046,2847,4.0,10/15/2012,"Always been a great place for casual food and drinks.  They carry one of my favorite drinks, Framboise.  I love ordering the giant baked potatoes topped with veggies and grilled chicken.  Recently had a pretty good steak here too.  Pizookie's are always a must."
Jenn D.,"North Las Vegas, NV",4,79,45,3.0,4/19/2015,It took them over 25 minutes to give us our food.  We had to cancel our salad order because our pizza got to our table before our starter salad. I would have reminded our waitor Joseph Y about the salad had be ever checked up on us.  The pizza and pizookie was tasty though
Jan B.,"Irvine, CA",14,126,22,2.0,4/12/2014,"Food is just average. Food is the same low  caliber as TGIFridays, Red Robin, Applebee's - where nothing is cooked at the restaurant. Everything is frozen and all they do is heat them up. Service is also just meh.  Our server would not hear what we're saying and would say, ""What?!"". Sounds uneducated. If it weren't for my companions saying I should tip at least 20%, I would've tipped nothing."
Becca H.,"Lake Forest, CA",72,201,131,4.0,8/10/2014,"My boyfriend and I have got take-out from here two times. Each time the person on the phone taking our order is very nice, and doesn't rush us with our order.  Our orders are always correct, and still hot when we get home. The buffalo chicken pizza is really good! We also got the ahi poke appetizer which was great! We also got two mini pizookies to go and they were still got! They put the ice cream in it's own container and separate bag.  Overall the to-go service is great- let's hope dining in is just as great next time."
Theresa G.,"Austin, TX",254,163,15,3.0,3/10/2014,Decent Happy hour-never really cared about the food. The staff is pretty rude. I went around 3 to meet up with co-workers and a young blonde girl (hostess) just kind of looked at me like wtf do you think you're doing? Other then that the waitress we got was wonderful-she accommodated our large group.
Art V.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,12,,4.0,12/3/2015,"Love the place for some beers and grub at the bar. That's what I usually come here for. Beers are outstanding and the HopStorm IPA never disappoints. The crew working the bar is very friendly and always down for a joke or occasional rant about what's going on in the game on TV...which is nice and makes you feel welcomed. Speaking of TVs, they have a great setup at the bar, and I never had a problem getting whatever game I wanted to watch on one of their screens. Come here. If anything just for the beers. Damn...now I am thirsty."
Mona M.,"Irvine, CA",479,249,14,4.0,6/29/2014,"I came here on a Saturday night with my boyfriend. They said the wait would be about 20 minutes, but I think we got seated within 10. The bar is open seating. Our server was very kind, efficient, and helpful. I loved their pan pizza. It was super filling and had a good amount of toppings. The fried avocado rolls were delicious, as well as their ceviche. They also have a good selection of beer.  For the service and selection, I'll definitely come back. Not worth waiting a long time for though."
Ron H.,"Irvine, CA",152,56,8,1.0,2/4/2016,"I am a frequent customer to the BJ restaurant chains. This visit to the BJ's in Irvine was very very disappointing, especially when I was here to have my good friend celebrate his birthday. It was all good until our food order was placed by our not so happy waitress. Usually BJ's waitress / waiter are super friendly and smiles a lot however this time she wasn't. We placed our drink order, 4 appetizer, and our 2 large entrees with 2 sides. We waited for a little bit of time and we got one of our side dishes the tomato capree salad first to share as an appetizer. After we waited for quite a bit of time ALL OF OUR FOOD came out at once which includes  all 4 large appetizer, 2 large entree dishes, including full rack of ribs with fries. Immediately I was very surprised how all of these came out at once. I am betting someone forgot to bring out our appetizer as all of the appetizer were cold. We had the calamari which seems it was friend twice and was not hot from the fryer. We ordered another round of drinks but it never came. So we asked for it again and still nothing.!!  The buffalo wings were cold like it's been sitting out for about 20-30min. Our California Club flat bread pizza was also cold where the cheese already started to harden. The full rack of ribs was cold and the outside skin was burnt where you taste more of the burnt skin and heavy BBQ sauce.  We were hungry and I was embarrassed to even tell my friend this a great restaurant where I often visit frequently. None the less we ate as much as we can bare. After we finished most of the food, we told the waiter it was our friends birthday so we got a free mini boozkie. This requires some time to make but NO ONE EVEN bothered to take our finished plates away. We sat there and chatted for over an hour and when the desert came our mini table was still filled with used dishes. The waiter didn't even bother to help clean up the table so we stacked 3 piles of plates. While the candle on the ice cream was melting. The waiter came back and took 2 of the pile and left the biggest pile of large plates on our table. He never came back for it, no one wished my friend a Happy Birthday, and we had to take pictures with piles of empty plates on our table. I wanted to say something but no attention was given to us. We dined for about 2 1/2 hour and I wanted to get my check but my waitress was no where to be found. Being the tech guy I am I paid over the BJ's APP and continue to sit and chat for another 30min. No one thanked us.  Honestly I am very disappointed with the service here, the quality of food is terrible and i'm questioning the temperature of the food to even meet health code standards."
Jordan D.,"Irvine, CA",0,3,,5.0,1/7/2016,"I had one of the most enjoyable experiences at BJ's today at lunch all because of Stephanie. Stephanie has such a bubbly personality and made us laugh a lot. She didn't cut straight to the point to ask us what we wanted to drink, but engaged in conversation. She was very honest when we asked her thoughts on our entrees. I hope the next time we come back to BJ's we get Stephanie as our waitress. As for the food, the pesto chicken sandwich was a tad spicy for my taste, but the caesar salad complimented the sandwich very well. We also got a peanut butter s'mores pizookie and that is now my favorite pizookie. I'm looking forward to my next visit."
Jerome T.,"Huntington Beach, CA",184,55,48,4.0,10/21/2014,Good customer service from the employees. The waitress was very attentive. Ordered the barbecue chicken pizza and they cooked It to perfection. Good overall experience.
Jason L.,"Irvine, CA",56,43,96,1.0,2/14/2015,I hope you are wise enough to avoid this specific franchise location.  Normally the chain is decent with a solid menu.  Unfortunately this place had staffed the WRONG work force.  From hostesses that turn up their noses when you enter to incompetent wait staff that can NOT get your basic order correct.  I strongly recommend you AVOID this specific location like the PLAGUE.   don't waste your hard earned money.  Better off hitting anywhere but here.   VERY DISAPPOINTING.
Gary G.,"Fort Mitchell, KY",0,1,,2.0,3/30/2016,I ordered the half sandwiched  and soup. The soup was salty and the fries were cold. They only brought out the sandwich only after I mention it. They have a problem with quality of their food. This problem also goes to their east coast restaurants.
Allyson M.,"Seattle, WA",189,669,394,2.0,10/21/2010,"Maybe I'm more fond of the Yardhouse because BJ's is just meh for me. But it's all relative because next to that restaurant across the parking lot ( ), this place is like 5 stars! We've been here a handful of times, but I guess I haven't reviewed it. On our most recent visit, the service was pretty bad. But I guess we reaped the benefits. First, my bf got the big fat fries instead of the shoestring ones. Someone must've noticed because they then brought a plate of shoestring fries a few minutes later.  I looked around and felt BAD because it seems like everyone else was waiting eons to get their food! The couple next to us ordered salads with no meat at all (yeah, I was eavesdropping, I guess... but there's not much space between tables) and I swear it took at least 1/2 hour for their orders to come out.  Anyway, my order was eh (which is one step down from being meh). I got a mini deep dish pizza. The texture was like mush. I would've gladly waited 30 minutes if they could've cooked it a little bit longer. Heck, I might as well have taken a flight to Chicago. @_@ And no... didn't order the Pizookie. I was too scared that I'd get Pizough."
Alyssa J P.,"Naperville, IL",259,857,59,2.0,6/13/2012,"I came here for a rehearsal dinner that was buffet style. I was very happy that the Powers That Be at the restaurant made vegan meals for Jeff and I, but honestly they could have done more than given us 1/8 pound of pasta with a 1/4 cup sauce on top. I left extremely hungry (considering that everyone else in my party got a ton of pizza it was unfair) and wound up buying 2nd dinner. Oh well. Also, according to my sister, the pizookie was overrated and kinda sucked."
rowena h.,"Irvine, CA",3,14,3,1.0,9/16/2015,"Horrible service!!! They charge us for ordering soda water, WTH??? Our waiter never checked back on us and this is a Wednesday night. We tried to call other waiters but everyone was too busy. Never coming back to this location."
Lindsay L.,"Riverside, CA",263,25,45,5.0,10/3/2015,This review is purely on my experience tonight with our server Nicholas (Nick). Even with the big homecoming party going on he gave us the right amount of attention and gave us excellent service. I have been to this BJ's many times and have never received such great service. Thank you Nick. We will be back to visit you.
Dawn M.,"Costa Mesa, CA",350,109,20,3.0,8/20/2015,"The food is typical delicious BJs, but I made the mistake of ordering curbside. 100% pointless. I thought it was going to be quick as I was late to a meeting, and it took foreverrrr. Sat in my car running the air for 20 minutes. Might as well have gone in, sat down and ordered a drink! Not doing that again..."
David B.,"Irvine, CA",0,15,,4.0,12/18/2016,"I think that this BJ's does a great job overall and we always enjoy our meals and service almost anytime we visit.  They also have a great selection of brews, which I just love.  However, even though The Margarita surpassed The Martini many years ago as North America's favorite cocktail they can't make a decent one here no matter how many times they try.  Even their ""top shelf"" margarita sucks and is always inconsistent.  A friend & I visited the other day and both ordered The Top Shelf margarita and they each had a different color and a different flavor.  The main reason is because they insist on using a mix that appears to be made up of simple syrup, orange juice and some artificial color from something; it is just awful!  I hope that they read this because you first start with crushed ice (not ice cubes from a machine), 3/4 oz. of fresh lemon/lime juice, 1 1/2 oz. premium tequila (Casamigos, Don Eduardo etc.) 1 1/2 oz. triple sec or Contriue, shake well & pour into sea salt rimmed chilled margarita glass and that is it!  I would pay $20 every time for one done right but will no longer order them there and will stick with Lightswitch Lager etc.  Sorry for the rant ;-)"
