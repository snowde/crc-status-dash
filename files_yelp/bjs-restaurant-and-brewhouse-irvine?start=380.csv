Jessica R.,"Boulder, CO",110,239,32,3.0,2/9/2014,"If you're in the mood for stuffing your face with pizza and beer, BJ's is always a good choice. A friend and I had just done the Tap'n'Run in Santiago and decided that after running and drinking beer, we definitely needed some eating and drinking beer. I'd been here once before for happy hour, but that was on a weeknight and I couldn't remember if they did weekend HH. When we walked in (still dressed in our silly outfits from the run), the hostess looked at us and said ""two?"" and I answered ""Actually we were going to grab a seat at the bar if it's happy hour - is happy hour happening right now?"" to which she wandered away to ask someone else a question, then came back, picked up our menus and said ""No."" I followed up with ""Oh, ok, we weren't sure if you did Saturday happy hour."" Her response was ""we do, but it's not going on right now."" Uhhh, for one, it was 4 pm, so I would think if you were doing HH it'd be happening. Two, you aren't helpful if you don't tell me what time it happens so I can know for next time. Whatever. She just had that tone that made us not want to talk to her any more than absolutely necessary, so we let it go. Other than the less than stellar interaction with the hostess, everything was just fine - same as you would get at any other BJ's. Friendly service from our waiter, pizza came out as we ordered it and the beer is always good for a chain. If you can avoid interacting with the hostess (maybe just walk in and beeline right to the bar?) and you need a fat-kid beer and pizza fix, this might be the spot for you."
Vy S.,"Orange, CA",400,330,304,3.0,8/21/2010,"BJ's Restaurant is like that old pair of shoes you never want to throw away - they're comfortable, you know exactly what purpose they serve, and you can't seem to try something new.  This BJ's location is no different than any other I've been to - packed full even after 7pm on a Thursday, service was standard rather than stellar, the food was familiar and the beer was frothy cold - that's fine by me. I came in for happy hour with my boys, which runs from 3-7pm (there's also late night happy hour after 10p).  Make sure to get your orders in before 7pm because if they enter it in and the computer has already switched, it's full price for you. My go-to drink is the Jeremiah Red mixed with the Berry Burst Cider - affectionately known as the ""Jerry Burst"" - drink it, love it, and savor the smooth beer cider medley.  Also, my friends and I tried the new flatbread pizza appetizers - actually a decent choice and pretty light compared to their deep dish pizzas.   A pretty good happy hour outing if you ask me!"
Andrew L.,"Irvine, CA",972,117,2262,4.0,6/19/2014,"Pros and Cons  Pros  1. Wonderful selection of pizzas, sandwiches, and appetizers. 2. Tasty Food  3. Large restaurant with very spacious seating  Cons  1. Crowded often  2. Slower Service  I really enjoy coming to BJ's Pizza for lunch or dinner. They have a wide selection of deep dish pizzas, sandwiches, and salads. All of the pizzas are very good especially the Hawaiian and the BJ's special. The crust is soft and there is a generous portion of toppings. The prices are affordable and there are plenty of choices. Also, the restaurant is very spacious and there are several tvs to watch to keep up with sports games."
liza V.,"Los Angeles, CA",12,61,11,5.0,8/23/2015,"First, we love this place! We look forward to this being our cheat meal and enjoy every bite. Today was even better because of the customer service we received from our waiter, Ian. He was very attentive and was overall great! I even had to tell the manger what a great job he did and how I noticed the whole team really hustling to provide great service. I noticed a bus boy (sorry, I'm sure that's not the most appropriate name for it) carrying huge loads of dishes and clearing tables like a mad man! I stopped and complimented him too (his name is Ramiro). Overall, the pizza was awesome but the service was the cherry on top!"
basla N.,"Torrance, CA",0,21,2,1.0,3/18/2016,"Terrible service! My friend and I were having a drink at the bar. After few beers, we had to go to the restroom. When we came back after 2 minutes, our table was cleaned and someone else was sitting there which is odd since we did not pay yet. That is not why i am complaining here though. I am complaining about what happened next. They first asked the couple sitting at our table to move, but we told them that is not necessary. We were sat at another table. We then asked for our beers that they took and half the appetizer that was left on the dish. What they did later was totally disrespectful. They gave us half a beer each and they discounted half of the appetizer we were having without asking if we wanted another one. Maybe i was still hungry and wanted to finish the food. It was their mistake and they gave us half a beer which could be less than what i left in my glass. The waiter explained that they could not fill our glasses more than that because of California law???? Looks like we have to find another place for our happy hours."
Junqing G.,"Irvine, CA",113,140,7448,3.0,6/15/2014,"We came here for dinner on Father's day. Took advantage of the new BJ's mobile app to order ahead of time and to get a prefer position on the waitlist. Got there before 5pm and the place was already packed but we waited no more than 5 minutes and got our table. We ordered Fish and Chips, Hawaiian Mahi Mahi, Avocado spring rolls, Angel Hair pasta, and Spaghetti with Marinara sauce.  Overall the food was ok but on the salty side. We also paid via the mobile app so from start to finish it was relatively quick without all of that waiting before the mobile app. There are so many other restaurant choices so we will come back but maybe not too soon."
Katrina S.,"Tustin, CA",0,5,,5.0,10/10/2015,"Stephanie S is amazing. I came in to meet my friends and she greeted me right away, got my drink quick and always came back to check on us. She has a good personality and definitely has the strength of a server. I'll come in and ask for her each time. Good drinks and wings too"
Nick K.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",42,32,8,4.0,9/10/2014,"Have a craving for unique high quality pizza?  Then this is your next place to visit! From the wide variety of pizza topings available to the great low-key atmosphere, BJ's has it all. Plus, there beer selection is definitely worth trying out! They have some great brews for a fairly reasonable price. OF course let us not forget the best part about BJ's: Their Pizookie! This is an incredible taste of freshly baked cookie with cool ice cream on top.  It really is difficult to select a favorite at BJ's, either the pizza or pizookie! The price is pretty reasonable and a great place to catch up with friends. The food quality is always exceptional and I do enjoy their wide variety of food options available. The restaurant decor and atmosphere is relaxing. They have very comfortable booths for seating as well as several TV's for people to catch the local sports game and a full service bar.  The only downside to BJ's is the service. I have been to BJ's for several years and always loved and enjoyed the food and quality of it but the service was nothing more than average- especially if you have a large party, more times than not the service will be slow and take a while to fill requests. I understand that it is difficult to handle a large party but it would have been nice for the restaurant to have an additional server to assist to ensure our requests have been made."
Adam H.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",70,9,15,5.0,8/9/2015,Enjoyed our food and service. Our server Amy took the time to suggest something better and was on top of our drinks. I would definitely go back and request her.
Chris W.,"Tustin, CA",0,6,1,4.0,11/8/2015,Good food and good prices.   I have not had a bad experience dining in and they have been very accommodating to my large family.   Their take out however ternds to be rude and has messed up my order several times.
Billy S.,"Irvine, CA",0,39,8,4.0,11/5/2015,This is the spot for sporting events and beer. Great deep dish pizza.
Liceth R.,"Anaheim, CA",0,2,,1.0,5/5/2016,"Worst experience ever!! Our waiter didn't check-up on us to make sure we were doing ok. Also, I called over our waitress to order a second beer and she didn't bring out. When I asked her about my beer order she was confrontational and said that I never ordered the beer. The waitress was not happy to help us out, some entrees and appetizers came out cold, the service was just horrible."
Sarah P.,"Torrance, CA",94,17,1,5.0,7/31/2015,"Wow! I love this place! I would compare it as going into a Toyota dealership and leaving with a Lamborghini. Bonnie was outstanding...she was so prompt, as soon as I sat down, she was there with menus in hand and a smile on her face. Her service was of the highest quality and every time I come back, I will always request her as my server. The food was top notch and Bon Bon's service was the icing on the cake."
Jeff H.,"Irvine, CA",0,3,1,1.0,2/6/2016,"Tried to have lunch with a group of friends today.  It was an absolute disaster.  After waiting over an hour for my pizza, a simple cheese one,  it arrived stone cold.  The waitress said they ""forgot to bring it out."" My wife ordered a salad.  It came out at the 1.5 hour mark.  One other of our friends had to leave early and ordered an entree and a dessert.  Her ice cream came out first.  Her entree  never arrived.  It certainly appeared like no one was in charge there today, and the place wasn't that busy.  They are lots of other places to eat around there, so we'll skip BJ's from now on."
Christina P.,"Tustin, CA",90,244,102,3.0,10/22/2012,"I'm a regular? Well, I guess that would happen when it's walking distance from my house.  It's FREEZING cold inside. Which is fine with me, when I remember to bring a jacket :) The hostesses are pretty efficient. Enough so that they have time to chit chat with each other and check their iPhone's to see what's going on in the Facebook world... We have been pretty lucky with our servers for the number of times we've been since I moved in - in January. They have all been knowledgeable, attentive, and quick. Minus the one guy that did not seem to understand that when someone was out of a beverage, they probably wanted more... Other than that, they've all been great. The food is okay. Nothing to write home about. I do like that they have been working really hard to re-vamp their menu with healthier items. Even though I still order whatever I want, regardless of nutrition facts. Their pizzookie's are great, but I recommend getting your own, because one bite, and you're not going to want to share anymore :)"
Imran K.,"Walnut, CA",3711,725,48,4.0,10/5/2013,"This is a one huge and clean BJ. The parking was packed and the restaurant was at full capacity and we got a superb table. The service was quick and the server awesome. The order came in quickly . Loved the Santa Fe Spring Rolls which Crispy spring rolls filled with tender chicken, black beans, fire-roasted red peppers, cilantro, sweet corn, jalapeños and Monterey jack cheese. Served with our Santa Fe dressing and avocado cream sauce, then garnished with green onions, fresh red peppers and red cabbage. Had the Barbecue Pizza and this was delicious too. had a great time. For dessert the macadamia nut cookie and vanilla ice cream was delicious."
Kelley M.,"Las Vegas, NV",24,13,3,4.0,3/15/2014,"I enjoy BJ's Happy Hour for wine once in a while after work.  I never really cared for the food, but the appetizers are yummy.  The bartenders have always been very friendly.  The only downside is that the bar is usually packed and there is only about a foot in between each table.  You're super lucky if you can find an open bar seat!"
Eric G.,"Orange, CA",0,7,2,1.0,2/12/2015,Great food. Love bjs. Service here is absolutely terrible though. I've been sitting at a booth in the bar for over 30 minutes and not one person has stopped to help us. I even flagged a waitress down to ask for menus... Still no menus.... This seems to be a reoccurring theme for this bj's....  I'm an idiot for coming here... Smh...
Christa K.,"Tustin, CA",179,86,45,5.0,6/17/2015,We love our server Kerrie! She is the sweetest and remembered us. She takes such good care of us and we love coming here for happy hour after our long day working at the restaurant.
Will M.,"Santa Ana, CA",554,646,2467,3.0,10/25/2009,"We usually visit this place every month of two.  This latest trek was on a Friday afternoon at 1:30 PM. What a difference this place is when there aren't a boatload of teens and/or little kids jumping on the seats and proving how they can manipulate their parents in a public place. You can appreciate how nice the place looks.  They've got lots of big screen TV's, and is super crowded when there are big sports games or events. Some of the servers go home at that post noon rush time. So you may get much better service or not.  Inconsistency is one thing you'll often experience with BJs at this location.   I only live a few miles away, so this is a convenient place for me if I want some microbrew and a decent meal.  Ome of my favorite items here is the Asian Chicken Salad. They use Napa Cabbage, red cabbage, carrots, chicken slices and green onion all put together with a creamy sweet sour sesame dressing, and topped with a pile of fried noodles, I really like it, but it's $13 now, and at that price, it's not a great value IMO. Neither are sodas at $3 now. It's going to make tap water a better option.  Water is better for you anyway, and I'm finally beginning to eliminate the ordering of cokes or beverages.  But being a beer fan,I will keep ordering micro-brews on tap which I can't get at home very easily. BTW, in years past, Tustin's tap water was rated by some agencies are better than average. I also like the Balsamic Chicken also $13.  It's got two chicken breasts, a rich sweet balsamic vinegar served with greens and potatoes, though I asked and got white rice instead. This dish is filling.  There are lots of good chicken dishes, including fried chicken breast and the lettuce wrap appetizer. With a glass of one of their lighter beers, it's excellent. Some other favorites are the lunchtime meals with a half sandwich or pasta dish,  and soup or salad. There are other combinations are well for about $12 but it varies depending what you get. The star of this place is the deep dish pizza.  I know lots of people prefer the thinner crust crispier pizza.  But I like their deep dish crust so much I could just have that with balsamic vinegar and olive oil, and a glass of merlot.  My favorite is the works, the $20 for large combination pizza with a little of everything on it.  We always order the large, and is perfect for 3 people.  With 2 people, you'll probably take some of it home.  The really talk up the pizookie, and it's good warm served with their porter beer or coffee.  They have a really good happy hour deals at 10 PM at night.  I once rented out one of my rooms to a fraternity guy at UC Irvine, and he and his friends used to go at least once a week for their great deals on a college budget. I like the food at BJs a lot, but be prepared for inconsistent service."
