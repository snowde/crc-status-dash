Rosalie B.,"Lower Peters Canyon, Irvine, CA",133,1,,2.0,1/9/2018,"I went here on Jan. 6th for my sister's birthday and we asked for a table of four plus a high chair. They told us they would text us when our table was ready, so we waited. We got a text, so we went up to the front to get seated and this host just asked for our name and she looked at us like we were stupid because I guess she didn't see that they texted us. Then, another host realized that he didn't put our slip with our table, so he handed it to the host who looked at us like we were stupid. We arrive to our table and we see three chairs and a high chair. She rolled her eyes and said are you going to need another chair ? And we said yeah like it's common sense, so she sighs and adds another chair. And she tells us next time you have to say five people including the high chair with a major attitude. At this point, I've had it with her attitude, so I gave her attitude back and said that we said 4 people and a high chair. Idk, how hard it is to get that right. I worked at a restaurant and people would tell me that and I would understand that it means four chairs and a high chair. She ends up slamming the silverware on our table and says well you can talk to my manager like she didn't care. The manager ended up coming saying I heard you aren't happy with your table and we said that weren't at all it was with the service that we had receive. We explained what had happened and that we understand that it's overwhelming sometimes working a restaurant when it's busy, but that doesn't give her the right to treat customers like that. The manager just said okay I agree, we will go over it with her. Like that is gonna make up for having been treated horribly. Our server was very kind and made up for the horrible hostess experience. I wish I would have read the name of the hostess so I could right it on here. The food was good. I just didn't enjoy my whole time there because of the hostess. I won't be coming at this location again that's for sure."
Karis K.,"Irvine, CA",27,14,,1.0,7/20/2017,"I know this is a chain and it's convenient to go to, but spend your money elsewhere. Some family and I went last night as a group of 4 and I called in 30 minutes ahead to put our name down on their 'waitlist'. Once we arrived, the host checked us in, but then said the wait would be another 20 minutes? Why would I bother being on the waitlist then? Luckily we were seated within 10 minutes not 20. SERVICE: Waitress was nice, but never came to our table at the right time. I had to FLAG DOWN waiters or waitresses to take our order, add to our order, and get refills many times. Our drinks were never filled unless we asked and even then, they would only fill the person who has the least water, but not everyone?!  FOOD: We all weren't feeling pizza so we opted for 3 pasta dishes and their new quinoa dish. -Thai Soba Noodles: Poorly cooked and came as a mush of broken soba noodles. Flavor was okay. -Fettuccini Alfredo: Super sticky -Jambalaya: I asked for pasta instead of rice, which maybe was my mistake, but this was the WORST Jambalaya I've ever had (and this is a go to dish for me at most restaurants). SUPER BLAND. How could you do that to a Jambalaya? The noodles had absolutely no flavor at all except for a bit of olive oil and the peppers, shrimp, sausage, and chicken were all poorly seasoned. DO NOT ORDER NOT WORTH THE $. -Quinoa dish: Unless you really need to watch your weight, no even then I wouldn't suggest this dish. Absolutely NO flavor. My mom had to put Siracha with every bite just to eat it. Pizookies were good so there is a star for that, but they should be good it's their signature. Just think twice about coming here because things have changed at this chain and not for the better. I used to go many times about 4-5 years ago, but now I won't be back for a long while. Sadly disappointed."
M J.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,21,9,1.0,7/16/2017,Yeap all the reviews are true. The service from the staff is badddddd  it's sad because I visit different locations and they all have great food and service but not sure what's wrong here. Oh well I guess the manager doesn't care about training his staff to be more helpful or at least try to serve us that we just come to eat something good enjoy the food but can't when everyone here has long faces and can't even come to see if we are okay. Will not come to this location.
Nick D.,"Irvine, CA",0,2,,1.0,12/3/2017,One specific server is very rude. Her name was Cynthia and she had an attitude when my son asked for the kids meal. She laughed and rolled her eyes at my son. No customer should ever be treated like this. I understand there is policy but there are ways to officiate them. The food was also very poor.
Mariella Jacqueline K.,"Los Angeles, CA",211,69,131,3.0,8/30/2017,"The menu is very overwhelming, just ask for a kids menu :) anyone can order off it. A full white meat (chicken breast grilled) with broccoli and carrots and it's cheap.  The easy thing is the free birthday Pizookie if it is your birthday :-) yummy chocolate chip cookie with ice cream on top but however I cannot enjoy this so everyone else should!"
Elizah C.,"Corona, CA",62,2,,5.0,12/24/2017,"Absolutely FANtastic service and experience. I have to say tons of people will easily go out of their way to write complaints to receive compensation, but very few will to recognize prestige service. Haven't been to a BJ's in a while due to a few reasons. We came in last night 12/23 celebrating Friendsmas there was 7 of us, got sat on the patio which we weren't too happy with first off and the host could be a tad happier, it is the holidays. It took a brief moment for us to be greeted by Anthony our server who we noticed was quite busy so no worries. He came and Greeted us with a very warming and apologetic opening for the slight wait, took our drink order and was very knowledgeable, especially with all of us wanting to try new and different drinks. He then helped us choose a few appetizers and we asked him to surprise us with some as well, he made great choices must I say. I do have to say being a people watcher I was noticing how meticulous and organized he is with his tables and tables prioritizing "" me being a server for 15 years"" started to get a little empathic when I over heard a table complaining and talking about issues that were out of his control and not paying enough attention when he alone seemed to have almost a 1/3 of that huge patio! When our entrees came out he was completely on top of everything to make sure each dish was out and correct along with any condiments needed. must I also say we didn't once need to remind him for drink refills or removing dishes as needed. As for our dessert we provided our own alone with a few great pizookis and Anthony cleared out our whole table and set it for dessert as if we were eating at Mastros without even having to ask. WOW! With his load and continuing up with everyone! I hope to Have that gentleman as my server ever time I come BJ's from here on out!!! Bravo Service! Please be sure to thank Anthony for us as we were in a rush after paying! Merry Christmas Anthony & BJ's !!!"
Teri Y.,"Irvine, CA",0,7,3,2.0,12/23/2017,Review is pertaining to delivery only. Saw that they offer delivery now so we ordered a pizza and appetizer to be delivered at 7pm.  Delivery guy showed up late at 7:30 which was fine but when we opened our food both the pizza and fried calamari was cold.  Not sure how long it was sitting out before it got delivered to us. We've never had a pizza that got delivered cold. They need to learn from other pizzeria and figure out how to deliver our pizza hot. Very disappointed. Don't think we will be ordering delivery again.
J H.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",16,18,,5.0,8/17/2017,"My daughter and I just had dinner at the BJ's in Irvine and it was great! The brisket loaded burger was really good and the bacon cheeseburger was also. Really glad I tried the house berry cider, at the recommendation of our waiter, Sloan.  Speaking of Sloan....He gave us enough space to be able to enjoy our meal, but also added just enough conversation and personality to make it fun. And yes, we had pizookies :) #pizurro"
Ellen R.,"Tustin, CA",0,13,,2.0,12/23/2017,Wow..really underwhelming meal tonight. Fish tacos were awful. Fish was stone cold and I doubt anything resembling heat had hit the stale flour tortillas. Tablemate had to send her food back that was not prepared the way requested even tho directions were pretty clear.  So overpriced for the quantity and quality I do not get how crowded it was given other options close by. Servers did keep the drinks refilled well. Bye bye BJs...there are fresher and more tasty options to waste money at.
Tina S.,"Tustin, CA",0,7,,2.0,10/14/2017,"We have been to other BJ locations in  LA and other cities. It's a decent restaurant and with the new menu they have added a lot of different cuisines as well as vegetarian choices. I would usually rate them 3.5/5. But this BJ's Jamboree location disappoints me third time in row. Each time we have gone the service has been below average. The server comes once  to take your order and that's it. If you need plates, want to order any additional food or drinks, you have to wait forever. First 2 times we went, we ordered vegetarian pizza, explained them no meat. Yet both the times we found meat pieces in the slice. We thought of trying third time today after almost a year since their menu was changed. But neither the deep dish pizza was good nor the service. I will never go back to this location. BJ's seems to have lost their baking recipe for a good deep dish pizza."
Dave C.,"Los Angeles, CA",20,9,1,5.0,8/15/2017,"First time here.  Nick, our waiter, was funny and personable and mostly left us alone to re-connect.  Thanks, Nick!  You rock! Anyway, both the salmon dishes we ordered were delish as we're the drinks.   I'm from LA, but will come back next time I'm here with my local cousin."
Brandon J.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,19,16,5.0,9/28/2017,"We paid a visit to California and on our way through we stopped at BJ's Irvine, sure glad we did..They had the new Pumpkin beer on tap right now, really excellent beer! They also have a new menu and happy hour since we have last visited which is also definitely worth a trip back. A Must try also for the Crispy Fried Artichokes and the Sliders. Our server Maili was very attentive and pleasant and kept checking on us, two thumbs up for her and a thank you."
Patrick W.,"Irvine, CA",49,19,19,1.0,6/6/2017,"This place sucks. Waited over an hour and all they kept saying is 'your next'. After we are seated we ordered and pizza took another 20 mins. Worse part when the pizza arrived it was just warm. Cheese hard and totally tasteless. When I told our waitress she asked if I wanted it to be reheated. Wtf?!  Reheated?!  No I don't want you to nuke it in the microwave. All along we are still waiting for our salad. After having almost done eating the pizza the salad arrived.  Apparently the salad department was backed up.  Lame. After not having been there for quite some time, I don't think I'll ever go back. What for? The pizza is not that great. I'd rather order deep dish from little Cesars than pay $25 for bj.  Do yourself a favor, if you have to wait over 30 mins for this place, just go elsewhere."
Margaret L.,"Fullerton, CA",23,126,53,4.0,5/15/2017,"We came to BJ's for my graduation celebration.  Initially, one month before my graduation, we had talked to an employee named Daniel.  Daniel allegedly arranged everything for my graduation celebration.  My boyfriend spoke to Daniel on several occasions.  On the Thursday before my graduation, my boyfriend decided to go to BJ's (in person) to confirm with Daniel, for the last time, about our graduation accommodations.  Daniel was not there.  My boyfriend then talked to another woman, who was in a managerial capacity.  The woman said she had no idea who my boyfriend was, and that no reservations had been placed under his name, nor mine.  We were outraged.  The woman then put our names in, and told us she did not know what Daniel had arranged, but she would TRY and accommodate us.   On the day of my graduation celebration, we did not have the sides of the patio.  Our guests did not get to eat ""buffet"" style, as people generally tend to eat more when it is in a ""buffet"" style.  Rather, we were crammed in two elongated tables, with little to no room for anyone to mingle and talk.  The guests segregated themselves as the way the tables were set up did not allow anyone to mingle with one another much.   I was very displeased.  It was then that my boyfriend and I got the attention of a general manager, Ricky.  Ricky did everything and anything to accommodate us.  He made sure my two tables (along with our guests) were well taken care of.  He basically saved the day.  The four stars I am giving BJ's is for people like Ricky.  Ricky was a people person that day.  Because of him, I was content, my guests - happy and full.  Many of the guests that I was with even said that they would be coming back to BJ's because of their exceptional service.  THANK YOU RICKY.   The lack of the 5th star is for people like Daniel.  Because every employer is responsible for their employees (as BJ's is for Daniel), they should honor what Daniel had agreed upon with us, and hold him accountable.  Although we did not get the side of the patio as was previously agreed nor did we get food served in a ""buffet"" style as opposed to ""family"" style (which is what we got), our guests, nonetheless, ended up content.  We had plenty of food to give the guests to take home.   Upon leaving BJ's, I ran into another one of my fellow law school graduates.  I made sure she knew about Ricky, and told her that if she needed anything, to definitely talk to Ricky. Again, thank you Ricky for saving the day!"
Ali B.,"Vancouver, WA",1,25,3,5.0,8/27/2017,"I've learned to come to the bar top to be taken care of. Didn't catch the bartender's name but I came in at 10:00 on a Sunday night. He was a really nice guy with a beard. I asked him to make a dirty martini and if he had bleu cheese olives. He said no but he would go ahead and make me some. As a server I know what a freakin PAIN it is to make those olives (admittedly, sometimes I'll say we don't have any to customers because I don't want to go through the pain of making them), and for a bartender taking care of a million people, I imagine it can't be easy. So thank you, nice bearded bartender, for making me a delicious martini with my bleu cheese olives!"
Abby G.,"Costa Mesa, CA",0,3,2,1.0,8/22/2017,"Oh boy. We have enjoyed visiting BJ's for weekly date night for years with the understanding that we are guaranteed an ice, cold West Coast IPA Green Flash. We noticed it was not on the menu for many months so they discontinued recently because it was not ordered often enough. Very strange. The best part was that we found Lazy Dog serves it (not as cold) and we went there to find all the servers from BJ's at the bar drinking Green Flash. Do the people who are actually in the restaurant (patrons/employees) have any say in decisions? As loyal customers, this is such a scam."
Amy L.,"Costa Mesa, CA",457,142,372,4.0,4/22/2017,"This is one of the better locations. It's cleaner, livelier, bigger, and more attentive. Came here for their pizookies because, hey that's what their known for and it's a dessert to surely satisfy any sweet tooth. You can't go wrong with any variety. Had the salted caramel one and sampled the double chocolate one and omigoodness that was some heavenly chocolate. It tasted like a chocolate brownie topped with chocolate ice cream. Chocolate lovers would approve. Good chill vibes!"
Cuong N.,"Irvine, CA",7,232,358,2.0,7/29/2017,"We've always gone to BJ's for father's day as it's a small tradition amongst our family.   Unfortunately, the past few years have been abit trying. We were seated outside.  It was hot this father's day.  If you're planning to seat us outside, please at least turn on the ceiling fans and have fans for use outside. But more importantly was the food.   It tasted like frozen food reheated.   My sister in law she ordered the prime rib special.  They asked for medium... it came out well done.  It was dry and salty too.  Another person in our group ordered pork chops but they were just way to salty.  I bumped this to 2 stars because they did replace the order with baby back ribs. After eating here, I'd say I'll take my chances with Norms rather then eat here again.  My wife used to eat here alot when she went to college, but says the food has changed alot since then (that was about 10 years ago) (she's just referring to the chain as a whole...other locations we've had the same sub par experience)"
Rob L.,"Irvine, CA",4731,412,1621,4.0,4/3/2016,"I haven't been to a BJ's in maybe 10 years or longer.  My initial impression when I visited the Irvine location today was that nothing much has changed.  I was actually quite surprised by the lack of technology at the reception area. They don't use any form of pagers.  They don't ask for your phone number or text you when your table is ready.  Instead, the hostesses will scream your name at the top of her lungs in the noisy lobby when your table is ready.  Just like the way they do it in those traditional Chinese restaurants in Chinatown. However, the menu has changed quite a bit since the last time I was at a BJ's. It was definitely more extensive, and more contemporary and creative. We ordered a BJ's Brewhouse Classic flatbread which was topped with pepperonis, Italian sausages, and fresh mushrooms.  The potions of the toppings were very generous.  The cheese was what they call BJ's 5-cheese blend and it was very tasty, with a rich flavor of mozzarella, which I like.  The sauce was light, slightly tangy and sweet.  The crust was baked to almost perfection. We also ordered an Asian chopped salad and we were impressed that we were able to custom order it without green onions and cilantro.  (CPK on the other side of the Market Place would not and could not do it because their salads were pre-mixed).  BJ's is certainly a winner here and beat CPK by a TKO! The salad was made with a wide variety of baby greens, romaine lettuce, napa cabbage, shredded carrot, mandarin orange slices, among other goodies.  All the veggies tasted very fresh.  The thick slices of grilled chicken breast meat that came with the salad were yummy and tender.  The final magic touch was the delicious honey ginger dressing which sealed the deal of making it an amazing salad. Service has been friendly and efficient throughout our meal.  The mostly 70's or 80's classic rock vibes are cool.  The atmosphere is comfortable and relaxing.  Overall, it was a very nice dining experience and quite a pleasant surprise.  Will definitely be back soon!"
Ricardo A.,"Irvine, CA",157,135,84,1.0,4/23/2017,"Unfortunately lost service quality. I'm a TUSTIN resident and usually go there for a burger with friends and today ordered 3 burgers at the bar area and waited 30minutes+ for a semi-cold  meal. Thank you Howard for your reply on my comments. Unfortunately service problems were not only experienced by me. Looking at other reviews the majority of complains are about staff. I understand the difficult task of hiring and the high turnaround on this industry, however a more intensive training and perhaps addition of floor managers can maybe help."
