Jenn P.,"Irvine, CA",221,285,230,3.0,1/14/2014,"There is really not a lot to write about BJ's. it's your typical american chain restaurant. The inside resembles a brewery, decent sized bar area and lots of tables. The bar gets busy during happy hour and on game days so be prepared for a bit of a wait. I unfortunately found out that after opting for a table when the bar was full on Sunday, that we could not get HH if seated in regular dinning. BJ's offers a pretty large menu that can meet most people desired meal. The pizzas are big and made deep dish style. I think these are BJ's best menu item, besides the pizzokies of course. Everything else it good but not stellar. Average salads, pastas, steaks, etc. I do enjoy the large variety of soups though. The tomato basil is my fav. And last but not least the infamous pizzokies. A warm cookie with your choice of ice cream. Can not go wrong with these. Full bar, decent HH. Decent priced items. Service has always been friendly."
Alexandra T.,"Tustin, CA",17,5,1,1.0,2/12/2015,The service here sucks. I sat at my table with my boyfriend for over 30 minutes just to get menus. Then another 15 minutes with the menus waiting to order to be told the kitchen is closing soon. No shit that's why we got here 45 minutes ago.... Need to find a new bjs this one has terrible service.
Kevin W.,"Irvine, CA",0,6,,1.0,2/24/2016,WoW true greed. I slipped and fell due to us-safe slippery floors.  They took my info but not so much as a phone call or a free drink. wow also not even a sorry from managers i think it would be a different story if my lawyer gave them a ring watch your step no really watch your step.....
Helen L.,"Irvine, CA",98,30,2,4.0,6/17/2014,BJ's always have a great selection in food. The food is always warm and fresh when served. This is a great place for hangout and casual setting. They have their own great beers selection.
Catherine K.,"Corona, CA",206,1,,1.0,7/28/2015,Not the one to write yelp reviews but the other night service was something else. Came there after work around 9:00ish with some friends and sat at the bar. Waitress gave us attitude all night and only checked up on us once. Horrible!!!
Daniel M.,"Irvine, CA",64,9,2,5.0,10/1/2015,"Ian was our waiter and was fantastic! We had a big group, which is already hard and he went above and beyond to fulfill our needs! He is a great waiter and the devotion he has for his job is amazing! Best dinner I've had in a long time!"
John K.,"Santa Ana, CA",3,3,,5.0,10/21/2015,"I come in to BJs frequently, I must say Bonnie is one server that I have had the pleasure of interacting with many times. Her consistency of great service is a great trait and she is an asset to BJs. She always gives  great service and is one of the reasons I come back again and again. Bonnie = great service. Great service = repeat business!!! Thanks again Bonnie for all your hard work it is much appreciated."
DJ B.,"Tustin, CA",0,1,,1.0,3/3/2014,"Wow. This place has gone downhill. I took my family of 6 to lunch on Sunday and the service was terrible.  Understaffed? We waited for 58 minutes to receive 2 of our meals. It took a total of 1 hour and 15 minutes to get all 6 of our dishes. I complained and the server told me that she doesn't cook the food, she just pushes the buttons. Huh? The manager came to our table and apologized when I told the server that her response was unacceptable.  My food was cold, never got any drink refills and the the restaurant climate control was set on Freezing! I'll stick with lazy dog for a Sunday meal. Wish Opah hadn't closed. At least the service was good!"
Tania S.,"Irvine, CA",458,262,398,4.0,12/13/2014,"I'm not a beer drinker so my review is strictly about food! This is another restaurant that has been in the neighborhood for years.  It's a very popular spot for beer and pizza lovers!  During football season this is the place to be.  They have tons of TV's throughout the restaurant even in the patio area.  They also have the most AMAZING wings and you can choose ""wings only"" instead of drumlets!  I love wings and these are my top 3 favorite place for wings. The white pizza is also very unique and popular but I prefer the New York pizza crust over the super thick pan crust.  Once in a while I do crave a nice pan crust and that's when we head out to BJ's. The pizookie is one of the most famous desserts at BJ's.  If you never had one you MUST order one.  It's a hot cookie with ice cream on top!  How decadent does that sound?  The white chocolate with macadamia is my favorite!  Mouth watering dessert!  Nice contrast of hot and cold.  Definitely a party in your palette.  Good place for a good time with friends, lively and happening every day!"
Jane D.,"Irvine, CA",0,9,3,1.0,9/19/2013,"I feel bad writing bad reviews, but people should be warned... this place is disgusting!   I actually like ""bad"" food (7-11 pizza slices, grocery store potato wedges and whatnot) but man... BJ's is serving the idea of bad food in an actual bad food reality... like, over-processed food that tastes like cardboard, or like something that could be acquired through a box... I ordered the safest thing on the menu -- a deep dish pizza -- and it tasted so artificial and cold(!), that I couldn't even eat it to be polite... the fact that they charge $15 for this, is what I found most mind-blowing... I could have paid much less for a frozen pizza, and would have enjoyed it much more.  I'm amazed that the place was so packed/that they even get business, but I guess there's a first time for everyone, maybe.  Beer was fine (Orval in a bottle), and the server/manager (the server brought the manager over because I couldn't eat my pizza, and I felt like such a tool, but what can you do?) were both so nice and efficient, so one star for them."
Lisa A.,"Irvine, CA",143,587,113,4.0,11/6/2011,"We had a really good time last night at BJ's. I asked to be seated outside, but upon arriving out on the enclosed patio we discovered how loud and hot it was out there. The girl seating us was so nice and brought us inside and found a little table right by the windows for us. I had two Kicked Up Sodas (Jäger and cream soda) and it was really good! I haven't had jäger to drink for awhile and I'm not a fan of licorice, but the flavors paired well together. The man had a root beer and said it was delicious...I'm all for an establishment who handcrafts sodas and beers! Food! We stared with an appetizer of Santa Fe Spring Rolls and mozzarella and tomato salad. The spring rolls were delicious, perfect portion for two people and two really good dipping sauces. The avocado sauce was my favorite. Then the mozz and tomato salad...yum! It was on their small bite menu and for $3 you got tomatoes, mozz cheese balls, red onion and some olive oil/spices on a bed of lettuce. It was fantastic and refreshing. The man got jambalaya for his entree and I thought it was pretty good! It was spicy, like a back of the throat spicy. And the portion was huge! Really good and highly recommended. I got the crispy chicken sandwich and added bacon and cheese to it. I also eliminated the honey mustard and added chipolte mayo to the sandwich. Excellent sandwich, huge sandwich to boot! The fries were ok...I got the thin ones and they didn't really do anything for me. Crunchy yes, but other than that they weren't anything special. The service was really good, our guy was attentive, nice and even offered his suggestion on the fry type. Though I didn't like the fries hahah I'll be back."
Jae K.,"Irvine, CA",23,26,40,1.0,12/14/2014,"Horrible customer service. Waiters and waitresses shows attitude when they get busy. I had to wait more than 15 mins to order, so we just left. Never going back again."
Stanley C.,"Orange County, CA",558,418,10,5.0,6/15/2012,"When need of a bar or a good hang out place in Orange County, I enjoy coming to BJs. It's very lively, definitely on the louder side, but always a great time. I especially enjoy their happy hr 3pm - 7pm and 10pm until closing. They even have this for Fridays (yes there isn't much to do in Orange County) Happy Hour: $1 off cocktails and drafts $2 off appetizers 50% off mini pizzas 50% wine on Tuesdays I've gotten more and more into Beers lately and they have a nice selection and seasonal beers. Easy to drink and love the taste."
Heather G.,"La Mirada, CA",6,51,26,3.0,4/25/2014,"The reason I'm giving this 3 stars is because I've been to this location 3 times and sat in the bar area each time ! Everytime I've been I've had to sit and wait a minimum of 10 mins before I finally flag someone down to help - once someone is available the service had been great but having someone pay attention to you before that , not gonna happen-  Plus there happy hour prices are dumb, they are 1/2 price appetizers for 1/2 the portion that's not any kind of deal people ?! Yard house is a million times better"
Desiree D.,"Irvine, CA",77,8,,1.0,8/7/2014,"Let me start off by saying my family and I love Bj's Restaurant. We frequent the restaurant and being that it's a favorite of most everyone in our family it's always an easy option. This being said our last visit to the Irvine location was anything but satisfactory. In fact it was downright rude, the service lacked but the food was enjoyable. Giving the benefit of the doubt to maybe the servers we had come in contact with were just having a bad day we didn't complain. It's understandably human nature to have an off day.   However, this is what set me over the edge refusing to go back to this location. Our family consist of three children. Needless to say we went to the bathroom a few times, one two wash before eating, once to take my younger daughter, then again my oldest daughter accompanied my son near the end of our meal. That last trip took longer than expected so excused myself to go check on the two leaving my husband and younger daughter at the table. Upon my return my husband says that he very distinctively heard a server at the station near us say, ""watch them"". Excuse me, I was appalled. Our family is not the type to cause a big stink so we paid and quietly left.  I will not be returning to this Bj's to be treated second rate for whatever reasons we were on this day. Our family really enjoys Bj's and have never received this sort of service at the two Huntington locations, Brea nor Orange. I would rather drive further to enjoy a meal peacefully. It's so very sad in this day and age that this sort of stereo typing is still occurring.  My review represents the service and not the quality of the food."
Jessica C.,"Tustin, CA",0,10,,3.0,9/11/2015,"Can here for lunch the other day with my husband. I ordered the light salmon and quinoa dish. My husband ordered the steak. Our server was very professional and nice but the dish was the problem. So the salmon and Quinoa is supposed to be a healthy dish, it arrived soaked in oil at the bottom! It definitely wasn't pleasant to eat. The waitress returned it to the kitchen. While my husband is eating it took them 30 minutes to bring back my food and he was already done. I just took the to go. It's not the first time either, they should change the chefs or something."
Porter R.,"Tustin, CA",0,56,2,1.0,8/4/2013,"BJ's used to have the best deep dish pizza.  We used to go here once a week in Huntington Beach.  In fact, I was so fond of BJ's, I proposed to my wife with a pazooki (the ring was in a small plastic egg, encased in vanilla ice cream, on top of the cookie). We moved to Tustin and continued our weekly visit to BJ's on Jamboree.   Then they decided to use pre-baked Boboli pizza crust instead of real, deep dish pizza.  The soft, doughy bread that you usually find under the sauce and cheese....GONE!  Now you need a knife to cut your pizza because you're pizza is now a week old pre-baked dry P.O.S. with all the ingredient's heated on top.  What a joke. You're better off going to Little Cesaer's Pizza and getting their ""Hot and Ready"" deep dish pizza.   No joke.  BJ's, your pizza has gone to the birds, so I won't be coming back.  Sorry."
Kenny K.,"Irvine, CA",43,15,1,1.0,12/14/2014,Came in today for lunch... Left with nothing. Got seated quickly but then it turned into a 20min wait of nothing. I have come into this bjs plenty of time but this was the worst. No service. Different waiters walking past us staring at us. We just ended up leaving. Don't know if I would want to come back here again....
Iliana G.,"Anaheim, CA",0,4,,1.0,2/10/2015,"So, this place needs to teach their servers manners.  I came here with my husband for lunch and it took 20 minutes for them to notice us.  I believe the only reason they noticed was because my husband got up to go to the restroom that's when the waitress Bonnie came and didn't introduce herself she just quickly came and I quote ""what can I get for you?"" Really not even hi I'm Bonnie and I will be your server today how may I help you?  She seemed bothered when she walked up to take our order since she had to stop her conversation with another server. Really? It's like wow I didn't know that it bothered you that much to do your job.  She brought out our waters one I requested with no ice and lemon She brought ice in both and no lemon and it's ridiculous.  Never coming again.  Management needs to be out on the floor and pay attention to the servers attitude towards customers."
Janeth L.,"Downey, CA",0,7,1,4.0,8/1/2015,"Today we had my daughters softball team and parents attend this store, I have to say the overall customer service experience was great. The servers where attentive to our needs and helped out our softball kids have anything they needed as well. Great job guys!"
