Tasja W.,"Newport Beach, CA",115,78,174,5.0,12/21/2014,"OUTSTANDING SERVICE FROM JOSEPH the manager. I always have big group event for my mtn bike Meetup. We usually have 25-50 people. Joseph is the best. He is very organized, great customer service and our events are a huge success there. Just had or Christmas party there last week and we did thanksgiving too. If you are looking for a place for a large group hands down this place is the best."
Chriss L.,"Fullerton, CA",41,507,269,5.0,11/14/2011,"If loving our experience at a chain restaurant is wrong, I don't wanna be right. I know it's a chain, but when you get great service & phenomenal food, you can't help but..... WOOT. and woot, I will. It's so hard these days to find a place that has: a) great service b) exceptional food c) reasonable prices But two outta three aint bad. Hubby had a steak with horseradish potatoes & steamed beans. I could not believe how tender the steak was! We could have (but didnt!) given it to our baby, it was so melt-in your-mouth- tender! The gravy over it had plenty of flavor without being overwhelmed with salt. I had the sesame chicken salad. It was big, but small. Does that make sense? hm. It was too much for me anyway. The dressing was light and not overpowering the salad, and they let me sub lettuce for cabbage (not a raw cabbage fan). I only wish it had more oranges & bell pepper. For dessert we enjoyed a PB pizookie, and let us have the ghirardelli choco icecream. I like pizookies, but I've never wanted to leave my husband for one until now. I could eat this winning combo every nite. It was all the flavor of a REese's PB cup poured into the deliciousness of a warm cookie and frosty icecream. The cherry on top of our evening was an attentive & friendly server (I didnt get her name)."
Elyse F.,"Cincinnati, OH",44,358,873,2.0,1/5/2014,"BJ's Pizza seems to have changed their pizza. The texture of the pizza is different  & they no longer serve the pizza in the pan. The pan was not for ascetics.  In no longer serving the pizza in the pan the pizza is barely warm by the time it reaches the table. We went back a second time after the change and found the same problem. Also, out pazookies were so overcooked they crumbled when being chipped out of their pans. Frozen pizza & refrigerated cookie dough would have been better."
FreeGirl H.,"Irvine, CA",0,14,1,5.0,8/28/2014,"I am writing about one specific dish - the Kale and Brussel Sprout salad with Blackened Salmon.  THE BEST!!!!!  You can also get chicken or shrimp as your protein.  Since I tried it, it is the only thing I ever get, it's SOOOO delish!   The balsamic chicken is really good also! Plus the salted caramel pazookie? Fuggedaboudit!!!!"
Claudia R.,"Milford, CT",93,677,2,4.0,12/18/2013,"Surprisingly, we got a table for 7 at 7:30 on a Saturday night!  It must've been our lucky day. On this night, we received the best service I have even gotten at a BJ's.  Our server was extremely nice and attentive.  He was more than happy to accomodate my vegetarian junkfood needs. Had a yummy burger with a veggie patty and some great skinny fries.   Everyone in my party was very happy with the food AND the service."
Tristy N.,"Orange, CA",32,11,4,2.0,12/10/2015,"My friends and I went there for friendsgiving. When we left while waiting for other friends in the restroom one of my friends stepped on something and she thought it was chocolate BUT NOPE! It was POOP! Ewww! The waitress didn't do anything when we let them know. She laughed at my friend. My friend had to ask for napkin to clean it. Then while my friend went to restroom to clean up, one guy from the kitchen came out and used his towel to picked up the POOP! And the manager asked us if it was ours? Wth? How the heck we carried poop with us? We told her we saw it when our friend accidentally stepped on it. No sorry or fast cleaning up. I don't think we will go back there because we won't know if they will use the same towel that picked up that poop to clean our dishes"
Passionate C.,"Anaheim, CA",0,2,,4.0,8/17/2015,"My husband and our kids loved our dinner tonight! You think this place is just known for their pizza, well they also have wonderful dinner dishes. I tried the Pork chops meal with mashed potatoes, so delicious! I highly recommend it. My husband had the clam chowder and it was also surprisingly delicious. Praises to this chain! Job well done on variety!!! I didn't give it a perfect 5 stars because the service was slightly not perfect. But we will come back!"
Jacelyn C.,"Irvine, CA",21,458,321,4.0,5/16/2014,"This is near to home for quick bites. Good food, decent portions, and reasonable prices. Dont forget the pizookie! Ultimate dessert bomb! :)"
Natasha G.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",64,12,14,5.0,4/27/2014,"For a Saturday night you would think it would be packed for a party of 5 people, but got seated almost instantly. The waiting room was very elegant and roomy. The staff here has excellent attitude towards customers and to making sure what you order is exactly what you wanted Our waiter was dedicated to his job! I would definitely come to this location again!"
Roxana M.,"North Hollywood, CA",0,11,2,5.0,8/13/2015,"Visited Bjs Tuesday. Food was great, love the Santa Fe chicken salad.  Service was great! The restaurant was nice and clean. Loved it!!!!  Desert was specially delicious.  Most important of all the staff was very friendly and professionals. I will definitely go there again!!!"
Christian F.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",54,64,3,1.0,6/3/2013,"Do you like waiting for your table, and then after being seated, getting ignored while other tables fill up around you? Do you like trying to make to make eye contact with the wait staff while they take drink orders of the guests seated nearby, after you were seated? Would you like to spend your money in a restaurant, only to be rebuffed?  If so I highly recommend BJs Restaurant & Brewhouse in Irvine, off of jamboree. Stop by today!"
Shiva A.,"Irvine, CA",267,320,151,4.0,5/2/2012,"I come here so often it's ridiculous. Quite a few of my friends work here so i get to eat out and visit them all at once! I actually like BJ's beers, the blonde and the hef are my favorite. The Jeremiah Red is a little much for me, but it's very popular and has the highest alcohol content hah. I've tried almost everything on the menu, but the pizzas and flatbreads will always be my favorite. Awesome spinach dip too. BJ's has a pretty decent happy hour. Half off mini pizzas and apps, a dollar off mixed drinks and two dollars off draft beers? Starts at ten. Good place to hang with friends and watch sports. ...I don't care how full you are, you still have room for a pizookie. Why else did you come here???"
Jane P.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,14,,1.0,7/2/2015,"Great beer and atmosphere. But the food has gone downhill and I often leave feeling overstuffed but unsatisfied. Worst of all, my then boyfriend (now husband) who looks very young but was in his late twenties at the time of our visit, was grilled by the manager because of his appearance and his foreign ID when he tried to order a beer. She acted like she was Homeland Security, asking questions about how long he was staying in the country, what the purpose of his visit was, etc. Not at all appropriate. She was way out of line. He was so upset afterward he was shaking, and we could not enjoy our beers. I seriously hope that woman is gone now.  I wish I had gotten her name and written to corporate but it's too late now."
Sandy P.,"Orange County, CA",166,218,37,2.0,12/4/2013,"The service was excellent.   I wish could say the same for the food.   Wow......not good at all.  We started with the Thai shrimp lettuce wraps.   The shrimp and the Thai sauce were flavorful, however, the lettuce was so thin and limp that it literally broke apart in my hands.   What a mess and ended up just giving up all together.    For my entree I ordered the fish and chips with wedge cut fries.  Fries were great but the fish was almost non existent.   When the plate was served to me my first thought was that there was so much fish I would not be able to finish it all.  NO,  there was so much breading that the dish was deceiving.   I had to literally break apart each piece only to find a very small piece of fish.  By the time I was finished I had a plate full of fried breading.....yuck!      BF ordered the BBQ Chopped Chicken salad.   He complained that the dish had absolutely no flavor.  Very bland.   Again,  service was great and the only saving grace.    Not certain that is enough to get me to return."
Sida B.,"Irvine, CA",58,129,689,2.0,5/29/2011,"BJ's...we need to talk. I've been coming to you for years and you really disappointed me today. Normally, I like you for your delicious pizzas, yummy pizookies, and my guilt-free favorite, the Honey Crisper Chicken Salad. You made your honey mustard sauce my all time favorite sauce, and i recommend it to everyone.  Then. Today happened. I come in, I forget my camera at your table, and I call in to ask if anyone found it.  You don't. But...that's not right, I know for a fact it's on the table. Please check again. I get put on hold for 10 minutes. I call back again, I get transferred to 3 different people for a total amount of 20 minutes. You finally tell me...""I'm sorry ma'am. No one's seen it"". I'm heartbroken. I just bought that new Sony camera! Still, I drive 20 minutes to you to make sure, to double check, that my camera isn't lost forever.  When I arrive, I shamelessly ask the people occupying my former table to clear out, and i check under the table, around the seat. Finally, a manager tells me ""oh, here's your camera. One of the servers found it but left it on the front desk drawer...withOUT reporting it"".  So...if i didn't come back, I would've never known it was missing? Why wouldn't you report something worth $250+??? Were you planning to hide it in the drawer, then take it home later?  I'm sorry BJ's. That's really shady. I'm not sure if the honey mustard can still tempt me to come back. You broke my trust.  :(  I'm pretty sure BJ's policy has some sort of lost-and-found issues in terms of documentation of items."
Jami A.,"Irvine, CA",44,124,22,5.0,3/31/2015,BJ's is definitely one of my favorites. We always get the pizzas here. Either the bbq chicken or the mediterranean. They're mouthwatering! We just had the shrimp wrap appetizers recently and we loved them. I love their drink selection too. So many beer options for the bf and tons of cocktails for myself. My personal favorite is the raspberry lemon drop martini. And of course you have to get the pizzookie to top it all off (if you're not stuffed to the brim). Our bill is always over $50 when we come here so it's not very often but it's always a great meal and great service. Not just this location but all the locations we've been to.
Sean S.,"Tustin, CA",2,12,6,1.0,11/2/2014,"Being a server for many years I know good service and bad service. Long story short we order a few meals and aside from the order coming out wrong we had to deal with a manager who was more than rude. He came to our table asking if we had an issue with the meal. We proceeded to tell him that the meal came out incorrect and he rudely denied and walked away. We checked the menu on the way out to find that we were correct and the manager did not even know the menu correctly. On top of that being a server appearance is very important, this manger looked like he just rolled out of bed with his shirt half tucked in and a beard that was not maintained. Not a pleasant visit."
Alberto D.,"Chino, CA",96,17,,4.0,4/8/2014,Went in for dinner last night and ordered the California flat bread as appetizer. It was really good. A little too crispy for my liking but overall it was good. Ordered the grilled chicken pasta as entree and it was delicious! Pasta was nice and creamy while the chicken was cooked to perfection.  Service was pretty good. Forgot to bring us condiments we asked for but that's about it. Overall good place for a simple dinner
Carrie R.,"Orange, CA",87,166,164,5.0,3/3/2012,"This is my ABSOLUTE favorite pizza place!  Great pizza ... light and buttery crust ... If you like garlic, be sure to ask to have fresh garlic added to your pizza -- DELICIOUS!! I also luv to order the avocado egg rolls as an appetizer!  Super Yummy! Oh ... and you've gotta save room for a Pizookie for dessert!  We had white chocolate mac nut with ice cream!  DEEE-Licious!!!!! Just be prepared .. if you go on Friday or Saturday night ... be prepared to wait to get seated.  And it gets real loud in here! You can also take your food To-Go!"
Marvel Z.,"Irvine, CA",524,249,276,4.0,5/5/2013,"I rarely compliment a restaurant for their service because when I sit down at a restaurant, I expect good service.  I went in for happy hour to celebrate a friend's birthday today and was overwhelmed by the endless customer service we received. Everyone was so nice and attentive from the moment we stepped in.  The funny thing is that we came for happy hour and ended up ordering nothing but a few beers from the menu. Their were some great food choices on there such as the flatbread or lettuce wraps but we just were not feeling it that day.  Always order their deep dish pizza. My favorites are the buffalo chicken, Mediterranean, and white.  For dessert, everyone is obsessed with their pazookie and did you know that you can mix two cookie flavors? My favorite is the red velvet and white chocolate macadamia nut topped with vanilla ice cream.  This place is dead quiet during lunch time but so jam packed for dinner so time accordingly."
