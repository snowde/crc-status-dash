Paulette P.,"Irvine, CA",73,60,3,2.0,11/17/2013,"Meh.  Food was okay, nothing great.  We went with a bunch of family.  The hostess told us before we were seated that we can only stay 2 hours, they don't write separate checks and gratuities will be added in! Our waiter was training another server.  It took them quite a while to put our order in the computer-out drinks need refilling and not one of them could do that? Some if the family complained to the manager. Then we got better service... Drinks were way over priced!  A margarita is $9.25!  Had I known I wouldn't have had 2.   Not a place we frequent because the wait is too long.   Drinks"
Julie B.,"Irvine, CA",1060,731,427,5.0,3/12/2009,"I love BJ's... heh heh. Came here last night and totally demolished the following (along with my ever failing diet): - thin crust appetizer pizza (the one w/ tomato, basil & sausage) - hot wings - grilled shrimp tacos - (2) berry burst ciders to wash it all down - ... and a chocolate chip pizookie - DUH!!!!!! Did I mention that I LOVE BJ's??"
Elise E.,"Irvine, CA",361,16,24,3.0,1/1/2015,"I came on a Tuesday night and didn't expect it to be so crowded. My boyfriend and I started off with soup  and salad combo. To be completely honest, the clam chowder was a little bit too salty for me and the caesar salad was just a little below average. The barbeque chicken pizza however was quite divine and equisite to my taste buds. The only thing that it lacked was a harder crust because it nearly fell apart the moment I tried holding it. The taste of the pizza made up for it even if I had to use a fork to eat it. And I got to say, BJ's definitely lives up to having the best pazookies! We ordered the cookies n cream one. The warm cookie melted in my mouth while the ice cream cooled it after. It was the perfect balance between warm and cool. The perfect dessert to end our meal in which we devoured in less than five minutes. I definitely recommend ordering it!"
Terri S.,"Santa Ana, CA",11,119,,2.0,3/22/2014,Great menu. The food is not consistent in flavor and temperature. We love Joe Young the server and Aaron the manager. We continue to go back.  So Aaron left and the managers seem nonexistant. Since Vanessa left the feint staff could care less that you are there to dine with them. The food quality and taste jas gone downhill / so very disappointed.  Heard from the General Mgr Howard who would like to address the issues and is suppose to get back to me after the holidays  / we will see how that turns out.
Edmen M.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,49,14,4.0,4/28/2015,"Another great Tuesday wine half off amazing what can  Bonnie you are amazing Stephanie, great ( waitress) .. Enjoying our wine and pizza nice and relaxing good time to chill and talk- wit bestie"
Kimberly U.,"Fountain Valley, CA",192,48,14,1.0,9/3/2014,HORRIBLE SERVICE!!! I went with two of my friends out to dinner we are all in our 20s so not sure if they pre-judged us and assumed because we were a younger crowd that we would not tip but they could not be more wrong! We are all in the service industry. The first server we had was extremely rude! Then in the about 20 min later she left our table and we had another server who was even more rude. She even rolled her eyes at us and did not check in to see how we were. The food is great at Bjs so that was not a problem but maybe they should be more careful about who they hire as servers. I will not be returning to that location
Tiffany H.,"Indianapolis, IN",750,1102,2719,4.0,7/4/2011,"BJ's gets 4 stars only 'cause of their amazing pizookie. It's always delicious with the perfect ratio of cold ice cream and warm ooey gooey cookie. Yum. The service here is pretty consistent - I've been to this location 4 times - twice with large parties & twice with smaller parties.  But food-wise, GAH their ribs were not so bueno. I know - why would I order ribs here right? But, I've had their pizza so many times (which is another thing I'd recommend) that I decided to venture a bit. It was dry. Asked for BBQ sauce. Their sauce was NOT the same as marinade. :/ So in a nutshell, stick with the 2 P's: pizookies and pizza."
Kat S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",130,388,31,4.0,2/20/2014,"Came in here on a Saturday night with a friend.  We didn't want to wait for a table so we went to the bar.  The bar is packed with tables for two.  They are sectioned into groups of three, and there's about a foot in between each one. There is just enough room between each section for servers/customers to walk thru.  It was crowded when we were there, but not to a point where I felt penned in.  We had no one next to us for a while, and were conversing in girl chatter when a mother and daughter sat down next to us... dang, now I gotta watch my potty mouth!!!   Service was good.  We both got a beer (didn't really like the Heff) and the flat bread ""pizza"".  My friend got the black and blue which was loaded with goodies.  I got the club flatbread (chix/bacon/tomato)... and while it was good, there were far less on top than my friend's order.  I didn't make a fuss because a) I was hungry, and b) I figured it was fewer calories for me to run off the next day! Not wanting to indulge in one of the obnoxious pizookies (although the pizookie sampler looked good), we just got some vanilla ice cream with chocolate syrup (not enough choc syrup in my opinion, but then again, I drink it right from the bottle!).  Again, the service was very good, and the communication was great.  I didn't like losing out server 1/2 way through the meal(mandatory breaks), but our replacement  was spankably yummy!"
Bob S.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,9,,4.0,8/30/2014,Loud and noisy at times but it is good for sporting events.  good bar good food overall good price.
Patrick F.,"Lakewood, CA",167,13,31,4.0,3/6/2015,Favorite spot to watch any sporting event and enjoy good drinks and food! Happy Hour specials are always great and the beer specials are decent.
Daniel G.,"Irvine, CA",128,168,6,2.0,8/23/2013,"Been going to this place a few times. Primarily I come for the happy hour which equates to me ordering Beer and Pizza. Pizza is average. Its a thick slice (i.e. not the thin crust a la California pizza kitchen). The ingredients are average (typical of what you find in chain restaurants) and pizza is never too hot (i..e won't burn your tongue). So its a good option for parents and their kids maybe? I usually like getting the berry burst cider/beer combo drinks (1/2 cider + 1/2 beer, usually an amber ale). its a good option and probably one of my only reasons to really visit. parking is decent, despite being in a shopping plaza with other restaurants, this place always seems to be busy for dinner. There are times when I come with a group of friends and after finding ourselves stuck in a 30 minute wait, we usually opt to try to snag a table at the bar. This is good because we get seated sooner, but bad since they dont serve all your normal food they would to you, had they seated you at an actual table. but w'evs. the rest of the food here is mediocre. pastas are bland, salads taste processed and i really haven't had the courage to throw money away by trying anything else because really, how terrible must you be to mess up pizza and beer. Oh yeah, service can be hit and miss here, there are times when i literally had to take the bill up to the counter because for some reason or another, servers refused to pass by and take the bill. annoying. And then, another time my friend had crutches, and they completely forgot to bring them back to us, which was also kind of annoying, so we had to go and ask for them back. it would have been a convenience but turned into an inconvenience due to their lack of awareness."
Sally C.,"Santa Ana, CA",39,28,16,1.0,3/7/2013,":I I wanted to give this place a better rating. Be nice about the first time I came to this location. Well, the very first time they apparently messed up my pasta so they had to remake it. So the boyfriend and I waited for a very long time. They even forgot my bf's salad that came with what he ordered. I understood that it was busy and passed it off as nothing too bad. The waitress was very nice and did come check up on us. The reason why I am giving this location a 1 star rating is because of today's visit. We got seated at a table which seats four people, which I found weird, but understandable since there weren't many seats available. It all started to get bad near the end when we wanted boxes for our food. We waited for our server to come by so we could ask for a box. Tons of seats started to open up, people started leaving. Our server passed by us many times to attend to the one large table of people. All we wanted was a box and our check. I believe it took 20 - 30 minutes and she never even bothered with us. She had like 4 tables or less to take care of. We just wanted a box. Before the box deal my bf asked for a refill for me. She says she'll get me my refill then disappeared for a long while and then we had to flag her down to ask again.  What really bothered me was the boxes. It took 20 - 30 minutes to tell us they were out of large boxes. I just wanted to take home my potato. Another server had to box up the pizza for us and still I waited for them to find a box for me. They finally found a box and then we got our check after a few more minutes of waiting.  I was kind of irritated that she put our check in a cup. Uh, I doubt you ran out of those black check books. I didn't want to be pissy, but I was getting sleepy and tired of waiting for a box. She should have had someone deal with that simple task first if she was going to be busy with the ONE large table. The check in the cup, not sure if she was being a jerk to us by doing that. I just thought that was ridiculous. We didn't complain to her about anything, we just waited patiently for her to simply check up on us and she couldn't really even do that. I was treating my bf out tonight so I paid with cash. In like less than 2 minutes she had change and everything back to us. Really? You could do that in 2 minutes, but not grab us a box in even 10 minutes.  Just really not sure about their customer service here anymore."
Brandon L.,"Irvine, CA",0,7,,4.0,11/16/2014,"BJ's is a regular hangout of mine, and this particular location usually hits the spot. The food comes out fast and hot. (I like the Corn Fritters with Bacon Aioli and the Spinach Artichoke Dip off the appetizer menu.) They have an alright happy hour, but the specials at Lazy Dog right next door are probably a better value. Service is always good - the bartenders and servers are accommodating and friendly."
Huy T.,"Corona, CA",20,80,190,4.0,2/7/2014,Can't go wrong with the pizza and the Jeremiah Red! Chill and relaxing place & the avocado egg rolls are pretty good.
Jodie Y.,"Irvine, CA",1,17,1,2.0,3/29/2015,Came here for my birthday because I love the avocado eggrolls. This time they were okay but I think they forgot the rest of the ingredients.  It was just avocado.  No flavor. I got the new deep dish lasagna it was terrible! My entire meal tasted like a can I assume because that's how they serve it. everyone else seemed to be okay with their meals. Nothing great. Even the pazookie wasn't good. Won't be back. Suggesion: stay away from the canned lasagna!
Edson H.,"Irvine, CA",306,183,106,1.0,6/22/2013,"As a long time customer, I'm so disappointed at this BJ's. I just paid $25 for what I could have gotten at Pizza Hut for $10 -- no exaggeration. My wife laughed it off but to me it's not funny at all. It was supposed to be deep dish too but wasn't even close. Completely unacceptable! I seriously hope BJ's takes this review to heart."
Vitaliy N.,"Irvine, CA",0,3,,1.0,5/9/2013,"Ordered honey crisp chicken salad to go, bring it home, about to take a first bite look at the chicken and its raw in the middle... How can you possibly trust a restaurant that can't cook chicken properly? Eating here COULD kill you. Never going to this place again."
Maite H.,"Huntington Beach, CA",606,470,2336,4.0,12/9/2010,"I was invited to a Holiday luncheon yesterday at BJ's. I haven't been to Bj's in years and I was pleasantly surprised with my dining experience. The restaurant is located in the Irvine Market Place and offers plenty of free parking. Our party of 8 was initially seated in the patio area but it felt like the heat lamps were on so we requested to move to an inside table.  The host of our party ordered the following appetizers:  (1) Best Beginnings® Appetizer Combo - $15.95  An assortment of four appetizers: spinach & artichoke dip served w/ multi-colored corn chips, mozzarella sticks, avocado egg rolls and Santa Fe spring rolls. Nothing spectacular and kinda pricey. 2.5 Stars  (2) Calamari - $8.95  Breaded calamari fried crisp and served with spicy marinara and lemon garlic aioli. Yummy!  3.5 Stars  I ordered the Tuscan Chicken Limone as my entree for $11.95  2 Chicken breasts sauteed with garlic, artichoke hearts, sundried tomatoes in a lemon butter sauce. Served over angel hair pasta with baby spinach. My lunch entree was delicious because of the budda sauce.  The chicken was tender and savory and the pasta was cooked perfectly. 3,5 Stars  If you dine at BJ's for lunch (Mon - Fri.) turn to pg 12 of their menu and you'll find a page of entree deals!  The other orders from my party included: BJ's Mini One-Topping Pizza & Salad, Half Sandwich & Soup or Salad, Fish Tacos, and Handbreaded Chicken Parmigiana. All the lunch specials ranged in price from $7.00 - $9.00.  We had BJ's Triple Chocolate ($6.25) and Cookies & Cream ($5.95) Pizookies for dessert. Order these ahead of time because there was a wait until they were served. The wait was worth it!  I wish I had known about these pizookies because I would have ordered one as my lunch entree. Delish and sinful. 3.5 Stars. We received great service during lunch.  Our server constantly checked on us to ensure we had everything we needed.  The food is 3.5 Stars but the excellent services earns an additional .5 Stars = 4 Stars"
Dennis P.,"Huntington Beach, CA",656,12,,2.0,7/24/2014,The service was terrible waited 45min to put us outside in the heat the manager never came outside to apologize or let us now that people would be outside flys all over the food the worst experience I've ever had
Rachelle Z.,"Tustin, CA",41,70,6,3.0,2/22/2015,"To start, we needed a table for a service dog, we were brought to a table that hadn't been cleaned yet. We then asked to be sat out of the way in the patio area, were they hesitantly accommodated us, maybe no server? We were brought wet dirty plates, for our appetizer and pizza. The food was still quality, the service was just less than par, this outing?"
