Bonnie C.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,48,,2.0,11/17/2015,I don't get it . The only reason this place is busy is because there service is awful . Food has been better lately but service is always sub par
Beth T.,"Irvine, CA",114,39,,2.0,7/4/2014,"I'm so frustrated with this place.  We've had extremely polarizing experiences here, but at the end of the day the issue is with the staff.  The management seems to need a complete overhaul and while some of the waitstaff is excellent, they seem to be constantly struggling.  My Family ate here on a thursday night about 3 weeks ago- It took us 2 hours to get through service without alcoholic beverages or appetizers. We waited *Forever* for our food and our waiter was so busy, he had no time to be apologetic.  We attempted to use the app for bill pay but something happened and we ended up waiting another 20 minutes for a bill.  Also, they screwed up 2 of the three orders.  The food was not bad, but the service was so deplorable that I said we would never go back.  Yesterday, at 3:00 however, my daughter *HAD* to have a pizookie, and since it was 3:00 on a thursday I figured they couldn't possibly be busy.  We were seated immediately- not welcomed, just how many and right this way. We took our seat, and about 10 minutes later (this is too long) a young man came to the table and told us that our waitress Stephanie was busy and he was helping her. We ordered our drinks and appetizers.  The drinks came almost immediately, the appetizer did not.  We sat and watched a group of staff next to the bar and a man in a blue button down and a tie have a fairly jovial conversation, and we continued to wait.  The Young man then came back telling us that Stephanie was still our waitress, however he was going to go ahead and take our orders (at that point isn't he our waiter?) we ordered and waited about 20 minutes for our food.  All said and done the meal took about an hour- which is fine, but I feel like a restaurant like this should have service down better.  This is where I really started to struggle, my child was tired of sitting and rolling around in the booth. I couldn't find the young man and I had seen a young woman with HUGE eyelashes one time (Maybe he was stephanie? if she was she didn't introduce herself?) She didn't want the pizookie anymore, but if she had we wouldn't have been able to order it because we SAT FROM 4 to ALMOST 430 WITH NO SERVICE. NOT EVEN A HOW WAS YOUR MEAL OR CAN WE CLEAR YOUR PLATES.  I FINALLY grabbed a young woman who was not our waitress and demanded our check, at which point she walked over to the man in the long sleeve blue shirt who brought our check and gave me the LEAST sincere apology I have ever experienced.  He told me he would take care of our check, I handed him cash and he walked away.  HE HANDED IT TO THE WAITRESS. HE DID NOT EVEN BOTHER TO RING IT OUT KNOWING THAT I WAS UNHAPPY.  Apparently his time is more valuable standing next to the bar and chatting with the staff.   This is my perceived experience, but any business owner should understand that to your customer perception is reality and in my humble opinion you have a huge attitude and staffing issue and those problems clearly start with your management.  You should take a lesson from the BJs in cupertino I've been there on a number of occasions and never once had an issue with the service.  This is disappointing since we live in Irvine, fairly close.  I will never eat here again and every time anyone brings up BJs this will be the story I tell them."
Anthony C.,"Temple City, CA",838,678,1012,5.0,9/29/2013,This place is like any other BJ's.  I've been here a million times and I've never had a problem
Dan L.,"Temecula, CA",0,2,,2.0,6/24/2015,"I came her with friends 2 weeks ago. It was their Sons Middle School Graduation. The food was ok  and pizza was good. We ordered a salad to split it never came, we ordered a hamburger it was ok but no condiments came. I asked twice and by the time we got them the burger was cold. We got refills of iced tea but no ice, so it was tepid  tea instead. It looked like they were too busy and understaffed. I've had a much better experience at the Temecula chain where I live,"
Megan H.,"Orange County, CA",10,123,32,2.0,8/6/2014,Not the biggest fan of this place. Went here for a night out with friends and two of the items I selected on the menu they said they were out of. The staff didn't even seem to care or offer suggestions. I feel they are over priced for the food your receiving. The only thing that gives them two stars is that delicious cookie!
Valerie D.,"San Diego, CA",358,147,132,4.0,11/11/2011,"This place ain't bad at all. I get so tired of ""typical"" pizza!!! I want more veggies and flavors to feel like I'm eating something DECENT. BJ's was impressive with their pizza, loads of flavor and not too much freakin' cheese. Just wish there were more BJ's close to me!"
Dave P.,"Tustin, CA",101,40,57,1.0,5/27/2013,"Having reviewed this restaurant before, I am changing my personal views after this latest experience on 5/26/13. It was my daughters graduation day from college, we hadn't a thing to eat all day and we were starving. We thought about going to Lazy Dog and Cheesecake Factory, but since BJ's was close this was the decision. Bad decision, complete terrible dining experience....Food delivered cold and burgers, the ground beef was raw, fries cold...manager didn't give a crap, he was more concerned in counting his hourly totals. I am sorry was heard by our waitress not only at our table at least 6 times, but the tables all around received the same "" I am sorry "" treatment like us... I don't care how good the environment or the beer may be, if the food and service is like this, you can expect the worst. Time to step up your game BJ's, its not about comping meals and $20.00 gift cards to say I am sorry.... Too many other restaurants in town that will definitely earn the business!"
Enrico C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,23,,5.0,4/28/2015,"Great food, service is okay (gets pretty busy on weekends) and the ambiance is very comfortable.  Definitely a place to take friends out for dinner.  The bartenders there make an awesome Margarita!  Highly recommended."
Janet D.,"San Jose, CA",104,1216,1381,5.0,10/10/2014,"We had a rough start for our wedding rehearsal dinner here at BJ's but the manager on staff went above and beyond to rectify the situation. We had placed a pre-order for pizza, pasta, and salads to be ready when we arrived but the manager who had taken the order forgot to put the order through. The kicker was 1. we had received a confirmation 2 days before and 2. had showed up early and confirmed with the hostess that yes things were going to be ready for us a the time we scheduled (730pm) kudos to our server she was awesome and super apologetic. She made sure everyone's drinks got replenished and really took care of us.  Though we had to ask for some kind of discount, the manager had no qualms saying he'd fix it right away. I knocked off a point because we HAD to ask for something but I still think they did a great job. Then I added an extra point because another member of the party (after a generous discount from the manager) requested free pizookies and the manager gave them to us.  if I am in the area craving bbq chicken pizza or deep dish pizza, I will definitely give them another shot."
Gabriela V.,"Tustin, CA",41,153,141,3.0,10/27/2013,"Our service was great. That being said, I think it was just ok (this visit... I used to love BJ's but I haven't been here in years). In a nutshell: Calamari (appetizer): just ok. Not crispy. Dipping sauces were bland... particularly the red sauce. We thought it would have more flavor but it was like a bland marinara. Thick crust veggie pizza: crust was great, skimped on toppings/cheese but I liked it.  Regular crust cheese pizza: completely mediocre. Nothing special.  Pizzookie (for my niece): always delicious. Good way to end dinner.  Chocolate milk (niece): I had a sip and was disappointed for my niece. Hardly any chocolate. Kinda gross. My niece didn't finish it."
Tiffany T.,"Los Angeles, CA",55,26,14,2.0,2/3/2013,"I won't put our waitress's name but I described how she was..she was blond and a lot of curl.  She said ""I will take care of you!"" as a magic word that she automatically said to all around our table, no charm, just like robot. Then she doesn't take care of us. She says she will come back to take care of our refill and water but she didn't bring our drink nor   there is one kind waitress noticed us and took care of us.Then, the table right next to us also got mad at her bc she didn't care of them either. then another table left to us got really mad at her. He screamed to her. Well she deserved that.  then very polite manager came to took care of them.  I won't say this BJ is bad. I think Manager and other hard worker-waitresses are totally fine, but one waitress... she is a problem. can you imagine she made three table mad at the same time???"
TonyAndMychelle G.,"Orange County, CA",4,41,38,1.0,7/12/2014,"Just to let everyone know.... after I made my review 2 weeks ago... Tiffany from BJS sent a reply asking me to contact her. I called her less then 45 mins after seeing her reply and left a voice mail fir her and to this day NO return phone call. I'm not surprised, as this is how they have handled customer service or lack of I should say.  Very disappointed and will definitely be taking our weekly dining experience elsewhere.  NOTE TO BJS: I won't be calling again so save your reply.. it means absolutely nothing furthermore, it is your responsibility to contact unhappy customers once an issue is brought to your attention, not us having to chase competent personnel down. I'm done playing cat and mouse with you!"

Hi Maria
Kimberly W.,"Brooklyn, NY",344,242,222,5.0,2/18/2011,"This place has evolved over the past 10 years I've been coming here. I used to come here just for the spinach dip... thought it was the best thing ever! Then they changed the recipe and I stopped coming for a bit.  Now... I'm SO SOLD! They make the best mini appetizers ever. Last night I ordered all but the tacos and they were pretty freaken fabulous. Mac and cheese is what originally brought me in... pretty much the best I've had so far, a nice balance of creamy and crunchies on top. Pizza's are half price during happy hour... spinach artichoke is my fav. Bruchetta I've had before and ordered again. Here are the newbies... stuffed mushrooms... I was on the fence after reading the menu, but after tasting... Yup I'm a Fan! and OMG Fried Artichoke Hearts! Yes!!!! Seriously I had a mini buffet with all the different options and I was in heaven. Yup... nirvana of food.  I'm ready for my second round now... mmmm... can't wait to go back!"
Jim A.,"Irvine, CA",0,1,,1.0,6/7/2015,"Just visited BJ's in Irvine, had terrible service at the bar (waited 40 minutes for spinach artichoke dip). Then I ordered a simple cheese pizza with extra sauce to take home to my family. Once I got home I found out I had a large cheese bread.  No sauce could be found anywhere.  How hard is it to make a cheese pizza with extra sauce? Extremely dissapointed in the food. You can go for a good brew but expect mediocre food and so-so service."
Troy L.,"Irvine, CA",0,17,1,5.0,2/11/2015,How can you go wrong if the restaurant named after your favorite thing to get from your gf?
Jessica C.,"Laguna Hills, CA",10,63,5,3.0,12/29/2014,I want to love this place but every time we come its worse..their biggest problem is expediting food...pizza cold...salad and appetizers come out after pizza (why bother?)...the pizooki NOT fresh out of the oven...just sad because it could be ssssoooo fantastic
Joyce C.,"Irvine, CA",4,11,2,2.0,7/24/2014,"It a hit or miss with this place. The first time I came I was insulted by the hosted. But I have also had great service. But today I ordered the hawaiian mahi and my fish was over cooked, dry and overly fishy for mahi. Our server hardly checked in on us and missed getting our condiments."
Jason M.,"Costa Mesa, CA",53,142,35,4.0,9/6/2013,"Be sure to sign up for the rewards program. It's free and gets you lots of good food and drink and money off the bill! The service here is always awesome. We come here for a lot of birthdays and gatherings. I love the fried artichoke with extra lemons. They are not those big soggy ones you get from the jar. They have a light batter around them, with the lemon and dipped in a little of the sauce they are delicious. Another delicious apetizer and I think 150 calories is the fresh watermelon and feta salad. Refreshing and nutritious. The new handtossed pizza is delicious, I usually order it with pepperoni, mushroom, jalepeno. It's cooked to perfection. For desert the strawbery beignet is very good and sometimes I like the berry cobbler. I love hot cobbler with ice cream. Awesome location and great with large parties really amazing! Thanks BJ's Tustin"
Cheeza J.,"Riverside, CA",5,6,1,3.0,3/6/2015,"BJ's would be first coming to my mind whenever I want to have American style foods. The place is passionate, and their service is well trained and friendly. My favorite is the Baby black rib and Newyork steak (medium). They always provide a good quality of food, but the taste vary each time. And I love their Ahai tuna/claim chowder soup/Tomato soup as appetizers, but sometimes I feel like my steak is over cooked. But still, a good place with reasonable price."
