Justina B.,"Tustin, CA",16,13,5,3.0,2/3/2015,I absolutely love the food here but management needs to work on having more servers. They completely over work their servers with 6/7 tables and some even a party so we get bad service.
William N.,"Irvine, CA",36,20,11,2.0,9/7/2014,A great place to football and beer. However the service and attention to  customers is lacking.  Food is average and not always well prepared.
Hui C.,"Irvine, CA",6,9,1,2.0,12/19/2014,"Here it is.  I have been here several time.  It's almost always busy and wait is long.  I had a group of 8 ladies.  We only require 2 tables technically.  I didn't think the wait will be this long on week night. My party of 8 came early around 7 to wait for a table AND somebody called around 6:45 to get a call ahead seating.  We did NOT get a table until almost 8 and only reason we got food quickly is because we ordered food BEFORE we got seated.   Then after all this crazy wait, we were seated in their indoor/outdoor patio area where there was some kind of company/large gathering party going on.  Their patio area is pretty big and it can hold close to 100 people.  Well, there were more than  50 people SCREAMING and being very loud because they were drawing raffle for the group for the party.  I asked for a manager on duty and asked 1) if we could be relocated( answer was no because he told me that we will need to wait another 30+ minutes) and 2) if he could talk to the big party to turn down the volume little.  The manager keeps telling me that the large party will calm down as soon as Bizooki(sp?)  comes out.  He never said we will try to make the situation better or we will give you free customer service item, such as additional discount or dessert.  The manager did not know how to handle this kind of situation well.  How can he call himself a manager??? Anyway, food was ok but this whole experienced left me with very bad taste in my mouth and I doubt I will ever go back with a large group or during busy hours.  I also plan to contact their corporate office about the bad customer service."
Jane W.,"Baltimore, MD",1155,635,1484,3.0,7/15/2013,"First time I went to BJ's, and my experience overall was pretty positive.  Ordered: - calamari: I would not recommend this dish. It is $10 for the appetizer and the portion was smaller than expected. Also, they only gave us marinara sauce and two slices of lemon as condiments, and I was expecting a few more options (cocktail sauce would have been nice). In addition, the batter was kinda soggy and the calamari itself relatively flavorless. -Hawaiian mahi mahi from the ""enlightened menu"" (i.e. fewer calories): the fish itself was somewhat bland, but it was soft and the consistency was nice. Also, the flavor of the rice was able to balance out the fish, so I enjoyed this plate quite a bit.  -BBQ Chicken pizza: Didn't order this myself, but tried a slice and thought it was meh. Probably personal preference, but the lack of sauce and rather dry chicken didn't cut it for me. -Pizookie trio: white chocolate macadamia, red velvet, and chocolate chunk. Delicious, but felt kind of sick after the sugar overload. BUT worth trying!"
Oscar R.,"Irvine, CA",2,64,3,3.0,12/12/2014,Came to BJ's for a couple of beers last weekend since co workers said i should try. I sat at the bar and took the bartender 15 minutes to take my order and was not nice. Afterwards i was helped by other bartender and was much better. Met some cool people and may return.
Chelsea M.,"Fullerton, CA",629,573,156,5.0,7/3/2011,"Located in the Irvine Marketplace on the corner of Jamboree Road and Irvine Boulevard, it's a great location that makes them stand out from the crowd. This shopping center has a lot of restaurants to choose from - Lazy Dog Café, IHOP, Opah, to name a few. The story started here in our OC stomping grounds, Santa Ana circa 1978, with a great recipe for deep dish pizza. Now, they have locations from California to Louisiana. Their vision is to be the very definition of WOW for the casual dining experience. Their promise is to be the best - never compromise. They certainly do not disappoint. Half Sandwich & Soup or Salad Lunch Special is quite a deal - your choice of a large bowl of soup or a small house, Caesar, or wedge salad with half a sandwich (Classic Turkey, BBQ Chicken, Roasted Turkey Cobb, Southwestern Chicken, Grilled Chicken Club, or California Chicken) and your choice of crispy-thin or wedge-cut seasoned fries. Today's pick was a small house salad, Classic Turkey sandwich, and crispy-thin seasoned fries. The portion is just right to keep you fired up for the rest of your work day. Thumbs up with 5 stars!"
Kaleigh T.,"Orange, CA",135,12,3,2.0,1/17/2015,"We made reservations for a small birthday lunch on a Saturday afternoon. They called 3 times to confirm the reservation. The table wasn't ready. The service was not good. They brought the wrong drinks out. I had a Bloody Mary and the best part about it was the pickled green bean and pepper. The pizza wasn't very hot, must have been sitting around for a while. We sent it back to to be reheated. I just wasn't impressed. The crust is good, but I didn't enjoy the taste of the buffalo chicken pizza. The salad was decent. They brought us a free pizookie (for my sister's birthday) which is an excellent dessert. It's a baked cookie with ice cream on top. But that's about the only thing I enjoyed about the meal."
Brittaney P.,"Garden Grove, CA",8,65,20,5.0,11/17/2014,"Bjs has average quality food although this location deserves 5 stars because of the service I received. Out of all the the BJ restaurants I have been too, this is by far my favorite. My server Mia provided excellent service and I would be happy to recommend this restaurant to anyone because of her uplifting personality. Good service is hard to come by-dine in Mia's section!"
Rebecca H.,"Anaheim, CA",63,56,13,4.0,4/5/2013,"My first time at BJ's- pretty good experience!  I came with 2 friends at 6:00 on a Friday. Oops. It was super crowded! But what did we expect, really? If you want you can try your luck finding a table in the bar in the back.  We put our name down and also went to scope it out. After about 30 minutes we finally claimed a table. (Our buzzer thing hadn't even buzzed yet, so it might be a good idea to do both if it's very crowded and if your group isn't too big.) It was still happy hour when we went(pretty decent times- until 7pm on Fridays), so we got a great deal on our food.  I got the Happy Hour Wings, Angus sliders and the three of us shared the calamari appetizer (not on the happy hour menu). I also ordered the strawberry mojito. Everything was very good and I loved that I was able to get variety with the happy hour prices.  The best part was the service. Bonnie served us that night and was very kind. She made sure we were taken care of and I was never frustrated with the service. We waited for a bit in the beginning but after the initial wait, our food came in a timely manner! Next time I'll try the pizza because that's what they're known for (says my friend)."
Lisa D.,"Chicago, IL",537,260,24,3.0,8/29/2015,"Although I enjoy the atmosphere of BJ's, I am consistently disappointed by both my service and my meals here. The extensive menu seems to cater more to quantity rather than quality and while the portions are large, I have not been impressed by the actual taste of my food. The drinks are the same way. When paying for a $12.00 drink, you would expect to be served a drink that contains some measurable amount of alcohol. The drinks I have ordered tasted weak and were far overpriced considering their quality. The service also seems to take longer to deliver drinks to the table than food. During my last visit to BJs, my table had to wait over twenty minutes to be served our first round of drinks. Considering a few in my party ordered bottled beer, this wait time seems ridiculous. I would suggest visiting BJs only when prepared to spend more time waiting for your food and drinks and less time actually enjoying them."
Aaron V.,"Anaheim, CA",164,3,,5.0,5/2/2013,"Great Happy Hour, Great Beers (especially te Jeremiah Red, Nutty Brewnette and Tatonka Stout!), and a great option for a more family friendly restaurant with good prices and sports on all T.V.'s. I would recomend call ahead seating for weekend nights and booking events early since this is the place to host your events in Irvine at a reasonable price for a quality experience. Servers and Bartenders like James, Bradi, Dale, and especially Caitin take hospitaliyand proffessionalism to the next level.  I'll b a staple in this building as long as they keep doing what they do. They are also very involved in the local community, supporting many schools and community events through their volunteers and charity work, plus every Pizookie purchase earns a donation to the Cystic Firbrosis foundation. I love this place!"
M C.,"Torrance, CA",0,6,2,5.0,2/6/2016,"We have been regular customers of BJ's for the past 5 years. The manager is doing a great job running this branch! We have never left disappointed in terms of food and service. Once when the food wasn't cooked properly, the manager came out and made sure we got a new plate. Great place to go if you are looking to have a good time (place is filled with TV's :D), great service, and AMAZING food for reasonable prices!"
Andy L.,"Anaheim, CA",226,198,103,4.0,6/18/2013,"It was on a father's day that me and some friends, and acquaintances came here to eat lunch- late lunch actually. The parking was plenty but it was packed when we arrived, so we had to wait a lil while.  Since we reserved for the occasion, we were seated on time. By the way, it was for a couple of dozens so they had to send us in the very back, outside, in the corner where wall fan is not accessible. It was so hot, and I was perspiring the whole time.  As for the food, we had the Chicken Fettuccini Alfredo, it was so plain and simple, yet creamy and tasty. We also had the baked chicken with mashed potato, and streamed broccoli on the side. The chicken was so tender,  I really liked it. One of my friends commented on their mashed potato that it tasted like cream. I don't know if it was bad or good. To me, it was fine, it was creamy. The broccoli was perfect. We also had BJ's Classic Combo, Vegetarian,  Mediterranean pizza and they were all great tasting, though they weren't exceptional. As for the appetizers, we had the Avocado Egg Rolls and it was fabulous. The Mozzarella Sticks were so chewy I couldn't chew em, but it was fantastic. I ordered pink lemonade, it was so refreshing. I also tried their strawberry lemonade, and it was even more refreshing, it tasted like fresh and it was sooo sweet.  I also had the BJ's Famous Pizookie, freshly baked cookie topped with ice cream- it was delicious, but I couldn't  finish it. The customer service was phenomenal. The staffs really were so busy and overwhelmed, I could tell. There were just couple of flaws like I asked for water no ice, and it took them forever to get me one so I had to request it again. The brochure for their beer weren't given to us in an appropriate time manner, as requested. Nevertheless, the place was huge, their menus were amazing, the service was remarkable."
Joseph T.,"Irvine, CA",221,57,10,3.0,8/25/2012,"Good service and food is what you expect of BJs, however my friend ordered a Jeremiah Red and it did not taste right. There may have been something funky going on with the taps that day.  Overall not a bad experience, just not spectacular."
Belinda M.,"Orange, CA",6,143,,2.0,11/12/2014,"We came for dinner a few weeks ago and it was good. Service was great, food was good, the ambiance was nice (we came early, so wasn't crowded or too noisy, until we left. The only real complaint we had was, how can you call yourself a 'Brewhouse' and then run out of one of your advertised, ""special"" brews? On Friday afternoon? Really? Were you out all night and the weekend too? There should be better planning involved with these 'specials~seasonal' type brews. That's all. Nothing terrible, but nothing special. Maybe we'll be back, maybe not."
Em H.,"Yorba Linda, CA",8,65,,3.0,12/7/2013,"Pros: service was great! We were a table of 16 and let me just say that our waiter did an excellent job. He was busting his ass and that's the reason we gave him a $150 tip.  Cons: food was okay. A little greasy but not terrible. The main reason I'm giving it only 3 stars is because of our time limit. 2 hours maximum. Really? We racked up a $800 bill...we could have kept going! I felt a little rushed and had to chug my $10 glass of wine. Wine isn't meant to be chugged! Had I known we were going to be timed, I would have chosen a different place.  All in all, it was a great time....I just won't be back with a large party because of the time limit."
Tiffany Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",50,45,9,3.0,11/29/2014,"I've been a customer at BJ's many times since it opened, but I cannot remember the last time I had great service. Our food usually takes entirely too long to be served and we are usually missing a part of our order!  I come here regardless because I love the deep dish pizza and pizookies. My favorites include the great white pizza and the original chocolate chip pizookie. Don't forget to mention your birthday! You'll receive a free pizookie.  Keep your eye out for the 2 for 25 deal! You receive two soups or salads, a large pizza, and a pizookie to share for $25. The pizza alone is regularly $25!"
Pooneh A.,"Irvine, CA",0,41,,1.0,11/7/2015,"We ordered pene pasta. We received another kind! We asked them to change, the second time the pasta was not cooked at all!"
Jean L.,"Chicago, IL",435,713,1134,3.0,5/4/2011,"mmmm.. not terrible, not great. They have a nice happy hour, but nothing super impressive. I would pick Yardhouse's Happy hour over BJ's any day. The food (in general) isn't terrible, but really nothing too impressive.  In fact,m I wouldn't pay full price for anything ( I only go for lunch and happy hour) because I truly don't think it is worth it. My favorite part, though?  Great lunch specials...and even beer specials during lunch!!! (they used to advertise this much more than they do now)."
Kelly J.,"Irvine, CA",65,6,,2.0,10/22/2012,"We've been coming to this BJ's for several years now, once and awhile we had some bad service but overall things were good and it was one of the best BJ's we had been to. However, lately it seems like this place has gone down hill. The service has been consistently bad -- bad attitudes, long wait times, dirty tables and or silverware, and you're just kind of made to feel like you don't really matter and the staff is annoyed that they work there.  The food has been pretty bad the last few times also. We were just there on Saturday and I ordered the chili giant potato, when it came out it smelled kind of funky and then I found a long, tubular, weird thing in the potato that looked like it had grown inside. After I took it out there was hardly any actual potato left. You could also see where it started on the outside of the potato and looked like there was possibly dirt on all the gross part.. It was pretty much a rotten potato that they cut into and put chilli on top of... so gross!  After letting the server know, the manager came and was pretty patronizing and said oh you just saw a little black right? And was getting ready to explain how potatoes have dark marks, etc. No. It was straight up a rotten potato and I didn't even get an apology from him or anyone! They did take it off the bill and asked if I wanted something else, but no I wanted to barf after that. Can't believe that the cook would see that (he had to have seen it) and send it out, I could've gotten really sick and after thinking about it we had gotten sick the last time we ate there but thought it was something else.  I'm just blown away that I didn't get an apology and no one was even a little bit remorseful about the situation except for me for the fact that I went there. Also, my daughter's macaroni and cheese looked like it had been sitting out for awhile when it came (and it's not the first time it had come out like that) so just totally over this place and if I ever return it won't be for a very, very long time."
