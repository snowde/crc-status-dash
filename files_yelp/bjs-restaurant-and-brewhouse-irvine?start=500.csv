Donna L.,"Irvine, CA",0,1,,5.0,2/1/2016,"Waiter last night 1/31, Christian deserves a BIG thank you. He was so friendly, attentive (we were a party of 8}, polite and efficient! Also one of the managers (dark hair glasses) tended to us to apologize for small pizza delay-my --grandson thought he hit the jackpot by getting a complimentary Pizzuke. It is just as important to offer a thank you ...we always remember to say something when it is a  complaint."
Garrett M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",37,43,8,1.0,8/27/2012,"I go to BJ's for their Pizza. And unfortunately I will never be going back.  Yes, those are harsh words, but when something is good, you don't change it; BJ's doesn't seem to think so.   Let me explain, I ate at BJ's 8/26/12 and their pizza tasted disgusting.  Literally.  After some research, I come to realize that their corporate headquarters chose to switch to a premade, partially baked crust just the week before.  LET ME CLARIFY, THE CRUST IS ALREADY COOKED AND TASTES LIKE CRAP. Better yet, their executive chef who was responsible for the crust actually quit his job last week because corporate made this switch.   Those are the facts, I urge you to go try the new pizza.  Personally, I'm not going back until they go back to the old crust.  Until then, Selmas pizza it is!"
P B.,"Irvine, CA",143,12,67,1.0,4/5/2014,"Sorry for the novel, but I'm pretty upset. This was not my first visit to BJ's, but it may very well be my last.  Our party of 7 arrived at 5:10pm on a Saturday, and were promptly seated at 5:13. After we browsed the menu for 2 or 3 minutes, I was expecting our server to come by and introduce himself/herself to us and possibly offer to place our drink order. The dinner rush had not yet started, and I noticed that a group of servers were seated, chatting, at one of the empty tables on the other side of the patio. The diners that were seated around us were either eating or their food had just arrived, but none of those servers seemed to look in our direction. After waiting over 10 minutes, our server STILL had not come over...not even to tell us that he/she would be right back or to apologize for the wait! I was getting pretty impatient, so I decided to try to catch the eye of any servers/managers walking by. Finally, the hostess who had seated us saw my pointed stare and asked if we'd been helped yet. I replied, ""Not at all!"" And she promptly went to retrieve our server who had been MIA for so long.  By the time Jessica came to our table, I was able to give her our entire order (including drinks and appetizers), and the 4 kids in our party had finished the entire activity/coloring menu. She whisked our menus away, and promised to place our orders right away. I was starting to get pretty thirsty, so I was hoping she would bring our drinks out right away. We saw her come back to our area multiple times to check on her only other table, but every single time, she did not have anything for us. Tables that were seated AFTER us recieved their pitchers of beer, sodas, and even appetizers, while we were left to sit and watch as the other patrons finished up their meals and ordered dessert.  We did not receive our drinks until 5:45!! I have never been to any restaurant, whether busy or not, where I had to wait THIRTY MINUTES for mere tap water. It was ridiculous!! Jessica seemed very concerned about taking care of her other table however, and came to check up on them often! We did not get the same quality of service unfortunately, and when our food finally arrived (on her third trip to our table in an hour), she had accidentally ordered a kids chicken dinner instead of the kids chicken pasta. Our pizza was lukewarm and our fries were limp. Tables that had been seated after us had finished eating and had left. The dinner rush was now in full swing, and the hostesses were coming by to look at our table, probably wondering why we were still sitting there, taking up space. I let it go because I was starving, and we had a mediocre meal.  When it came time to pay for dinner, I had 3 gift cards. One had $50, one had $25, and one had $15. (I always write the gift amounts on the front of each card). Jessica came back with our bill and said the card with $25 had $25 on it, but the one that was supposed to have $15 only had $10, and the card with $50 had $0 left!! I was shocked, but she didn't bring me my 3 cards back so I can double check their card numbers against the balance slips she brought over. I asked another server to kindly return our gift cards with my writing on them, but she came back to our table saying Jessica said they were gone and they could give me 3 empty gift cards in return. Wow! Why do I need empty gift cards?  I sincerely hope Jessica was brand new, but because of tonight's ruined dinner, I have 799 Premier Rewards Points and I don't think I'm going to make it to 800. This was the WORST BJ's experience I've ever had, and probably the worst dining experience of my life."
Justina W.,"San Gabriel, CA",2,27,1,4.0,1/5/2015,Came here for a friends birthday dinner. The food and drinks were yummy. We ordered a variety of pizzas and appetizers. The service was okay. They seemed annoyed by us because we were a big party.
S S.,"Marina del Rey, CA",292,61,3,4.0,9/13/2013,Pizookie is amazing. The best part of this place. Food is average nothing special.  Good selection of beers. Fun to come watch a game.  Great for families especially with kids
Dee K.,"Los Angeles, CA",1192,23,20,4.0,6/28/2014,"Server was great, food was a little salty in my opinion, i got to Lemon thyme chicken with the Brussels sprouts and brown rice. After my table tried the chocolate chip and cookies and cream pazookie. I loved the chocolate chip cookie one! The cookies and cream was okay. Other than that, I love bj's for the various choices they give you! Definitely a good place to have a party or celebration."
Robert L.,"Foster City, CA",6,74,,2.0,5/31/2013,"BJ's is within walking distance from my house, but I never come here because... well, it's a chain sit-down American restaurant, which I normally avoid, they specialize in beer, which I don't drink, and they supposedly have great deep dish pizza, which I think is terrible. One random weekday night last week however, we couldn't find anything to eat that was open so we decided to give BJ's another try. It's hard to find something to order when everything on the menu has like 2000 calories, so eventually I ordered this weird bento-box thing that came with sliders, an avocado eggroll, salad, and fries (there was no calorie count on this item). It took 35 minutes to get my order! That must explain why my food was cold. The sliders were possibly the worst I've ever had -- the beef was super dry, overcooked, and there was no flavor or sauce of any kind. The fries would have been good had they been hot, but the avocado eggroll's skin tasted like tree bark. We did get a pizookie at the end which was decent and the reason I'm giving 2 stars, but not as good as I remembered. I can make a better pizookie at home with store-bought cookie dough."
Lin D.,"Westminster, CA",43,33,1,4.0,4/9/2015,"Wait was supposed to be 40 minutes - only waited 15 - good start - started with the ahi poke appetizer - the slaw underneath had flavor but the poke really did not - WILL NOT ORDER THAT AGAIN - my partner ordered the pot stickers - soft on top crisp bottom very good and he really liked the dipping sauce - a little sweet for my taste, for main meal I ordered the bison burger with the blue cheese topping, apple wood bacon - special order as that is not on the menu with bison but they obliged - ordered it rare - came that way and VERY flavorful, wedge fries thick and tasty - partner ordered the pulled pork with BBQ sauce on a whole wheat bun - stated it was excellent - did not taste as this is NOT in my flavor wheelhouse - he had the house cream soda said it was excellent - not too sweet - no dessert - nice atmosphere - well decorated - wait staff is confusing as at least 7 different people did something for us which keeps table clean and service crisp but u do not know who to ask for anything specific - WILL GO BACK to try a few more items - bill was less than $50 for 2 apps, 2 meals and 2 soft drinks - NOT BAD BJ."
George P.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,5,,2.0,2/4/2015,"We've been coming here since it opened and recently the food quality and delivery has been terrible.  Yesterday, one diner got fish and chips.  We couldn't find any fish within the breading.  Huge pieces of breading with no substance.  Plus, it arrived medium warm with cool wedge cut fries.  After waiting another five minutes the Southern Fried Chicken special arrived nicely hot, but the chicken breast was tiny.  The chicken in a Chik-fil-a sandwich would have been bigger and more satisfying.  BJ's used to have a great chicken marsala dish but deleted it from their menu.  Maybe we'll go back if they bring back chicken marsala.  Very disappointed.  Still hungry. A Taps brewpub is going up nearby, seems like it will be more expensive than BJ's but hopefully it will be more satisfying."
Trang B.,"Los Angeles, CA",263,175,190,3.0,5/14/2011,"Probably more of a 3.5, but the price is WAY too steep for what it is. Deep dish pizza--okay. I get mixed feelings about BJ's stuff. Sometimes, it comes out piping hot. Other times, slightly warm and very greasy. So overall, their pizza is just o-k, nothing to get too excited about. However, I do like the softness/fluffiness that deep dish brings. Try the Sweet Pig. Pastas: mediocre, really. Very basic, and no WOW factor. If you're gonna get something, the rotelli with cream sauce, grilled chicken, and broccoli is good. Chicken Parm is okay, too. Entrees: Chicken fried steak is my fave... But still not AMAZING. On their best nights, this is almost good. Drinks: strawberry lemonade is off and on. Sometimes, it's just a little too tart, and is hard to drink. Rootbeer float, delish. Beer sampler, always fun and probably the best part to BJ's. Dessert: WHITE CHOCOLATE MAC PIZOOKIE. No questions asked. Just do it. *Wait on a Friday night? Expect about an hour. *No reservations"
Eric M.,"Savoonga, AK",9,844,434,5.0,7/10/2013,"This review started as a two (2) star because we waited five (5) minutes just for no one to stop by and get us water.  I had to walk up to the front and explain to the manager that free drinks were in order -- kinda funny because we both had water!  Anyway, the server at the next station over took charge and was the BEST, hence the now five star rating. That other server should be branded with a hot iron and sent home tarred and feathered!"
Chris C.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",8,79,5,2.0,9/23/2014,"Not a bad place to go for drinks and appetizers after work but boy they really hover over you and try to hustle you out of the joint, well before closing. Had half a plate of appetizer left and over 45 minutes before closing and the server was so insistent on getting the check paid and getting out of here it was really obnoxious. When I used to wait tables that would never have been accepted."
Farah R.,"Irvine, CA",48,34,2,1.0,10/25/2014,Wow. Once again we came here and they changed 3 servers on us!!!  Waited for a clam chowder for 15 min and my husband asked for a refill 3 times. It is nice that the G manager contacted me (I just saw his note here).
Andrea S.,"Costa Mesa, CA",12,11,,1.0,12/17/2014,"Waited an hour to be seated granted it was 9 of us but they ""couldn't"" make reservations when we called days ahead. Then we are seated rudely letting us know only 2 hours and can't split checks, we didn't get enough waters asked multiple times then one girl never gets her food after  oh it's coming right now shpeal. Just overall horrible service on that night. Never again"
Crystal W.,"Aurora, CO",0,37,,3.0,12/17/2015,"Beer was okay.  I've had better brews, but they make their own so...  Food was okay.  Nothing to write home about.  My mom ordered a pizza and raved about it, so she really liked it."
Katie C.,"Irvine, CA",144,11,,5.0,2/13/2015,"I love this location! My husband and I go here all the time. The menus is great but we've always had a great experience with all our servers. The wait- even when packed- isn't ever as long as expected and the app makes is easy to reserve a table ahead of time so you don't waste a lot of time standing at the front. We love the happy hour in particular. The pricing is great and the vibe is much more relaxed. The restaurant is clean and well-ventilated. I hate coming  home smelling like the restaurant and I don't have that problem here. The menu is great for people that like options but can be a little much If you're indecisive! Plus, who doesn't love a pizookie?!? Would definitely recommend this location!"
Noel H.,"Tustin, CA",61,26,9,1.0,6/14/2014,"Gave BJs another chance. Sat on the patio because inside was freezing. This time, we had a big table. But again, the service was terrible. We asked for silverware setups and went 10 minutes without them. We had to walk over to an empty neighboring table to get some. Server kept forgetting things and was stretched way too thin. I asked for the salad to be chopped and he forgot. He was running around like a chicken with his head cutoff.  The servers here always seem to have too many tables and too much on their plate. The managers need to find a way to improve service at this location because it is just unacceptable very time we go.  Also, some things are overpriced. We feel bad with spending so much money there and leave feeling terrible with what we got for that money. Such a shame."
David P.,"Los Angeles, CA",367,138,121,2.0,5/11/2012,"Want to go deep? (TWSS) Must-haves: Pizza [B], Pizookie [B] Skip: Salad BJs will give you deep with their deep dish pizza and slightly deep dish cookie also known as a pizookie. Typical BJ's. Nothing different.  Gotta try the Pizza's and the Pizookie's. They are the reason why you go to BJ's. Service is below average, they took forever to seat us in an empty restaurant and our server was condescending when my friends were asking questions. Who does that??? Food: B | Service: F | Selection: C | Experience: C- | Overall:  D+"
Jennifer T.,"Irvine, CA",30,286,2,5.0,4/19/2013,"Pizookie Pizookie Pizookie Pizookie!!! I'll definitely get this dessert every time I visit BJ's Great menu selection and prices are affordable. Dish sizes are pretty big, sometimes it's just too much food for 2 people. Waiters/waitresses are friendly and effecient.  The restaurant is very clean and equipped with several TVs"
Mike F.,"Orange, CA",0,29,,4.0,1/19/2015,"Very close to giving them 5 stars, as good as most of the food is, every meal has had some sort of little glitch, item we didn't like, item we like gone, plus the overall this is NOT an inexpensive place to dine out, so BJ's has to stay in our treat category. The have some of our favorite drinks, lots of soda options and specialty drinks. The have several appetizers and side dishes we really like as well, but we haven't settled on any entrees we are 100% with."
