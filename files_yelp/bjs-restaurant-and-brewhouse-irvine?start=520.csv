Candice C.,"Newport Beach, CA",1423,177,1500,4.0,8/19/2010,"I've been coming to this location for 5 years. The hosting staff is always welcoming and accommodating, the servers are always on-point, helpful, and well-deserving of high gratuity, and the food is always served in a timely manner - and of course it's always delicious. When I was pregnant with my daughter (4yrs ago) I used to come here frequently for the deep dish pizza, and as I became a ""regular"" the staff started to note my habits, my regular orders, and were even more friendly and welcoming than usual - I loved that. It's always so nice to come in, and now that I come with my daughter it's nice to come in and see regular faces. My favorite dishes: - Avocado Egg Rolls - Chips & Salsa/Guacamole - BBQ Pizza - Buffalo Pizza - Asian Salad - BBQ Chopped Salad - BBQ Ribs - Oreo Pizookie - Oatmeal Raisin Pizookie Of course, during football season, or any type of sports season - this is the place to be. The bartenders are always on-point during game season, and I love that it doesn't get too rowdy here. Doesn't matter who the bartender is - they always make great martinis here. I've been to many other BJ's locations, but for some reason the bartenders here just do it right. I highly recommend having any of their specialties, or having a lemon drop, raspberry lemon drop, or dirty martini. Definitely come here if you love great food, excellent service, and an overall great dining experience."
Jimmy P.,"Irvine, CA",72,9,2,3.0,1/3/2013,"Not really sure what I'm doing reviewing a major chain, but since I frequent this place much too often, I suppose I should give it some love.  Generally I'm more in love with this place when its happy hour and not packed up the dickens.  BJs used to carry the Dunkel which is still perhaps one of my favorite beers.  If this beer comes back, ill bump my rating another star.  Otherwise, cheap beers and plenty of appetizers, I really can't complain."
Tam L.,"Irvine, CA",93,339,1671,5.0,8/1/2010,"I was in the mood for pasta so I took the risk and ordered their jambalaya chicken pasta and was pleasantly surprised that the pasta was cooked al dente and the chicken breast was cooked perfectly.  Living in Irvine where most restaurants close by 9pm, BJ's is a great place for a late dinner without the wait."
Hiep N.,"Irvine, CA",94,481,565,1.0,6/23/2012,"Bj's was good at one time but they have decided to reduce the level of service and the quality of the food preparation.  When we arrived on a Saturday night for dinner we were greeted by our waiter. We ordered water, the traditional wings for an appetizer, and the BJs Favorite Pizza without onions for our dinner. The wings arrived and they were great. We enjoyed them and neatly stacked our side plates onto the platter indicating we were finished. We assumed the plates would be cleared in a timely manner.    This is where the evening took a turn for the worst.  We waited and waited for our plated to be removed from the table. Our water glasses were empty, no one noticed or cared. Our waiter passed by our table 15 times and the empty platter full of chicken wing bones, and side plates remained uncleared. Finally, a busboy cleared our appetizer plates 25 minutes after we finished. This would be acceptable and tolerable if our waiter was busy or preoccupied. Instead our waiter was bantering with other coworkers.   After the busboy finally removed our plates we waited another 10 minutes for our BJ's Favorite Pizza to arrive. When it arrived it arrived cold and with onions. We kindly asked the waiter to re-heat the pizza. We waited an additional 15 minutes for our pizza to arrive and it arrived luke warm. We grabbed a slice for each of us. Then flagged down our waiter, explained it was still cold and requested that he box it to go.  The manager brought our to go box back to us and some what insulted my ethics. He stating the box of the pizza he was holding warm. I explained to him first of all the pizza arrived with onions when I ordered it without onions, and furthermore, the waiter removed the pizza from our table within 2 minutes of delivering it a second time with his bare hands. He didn't use the pot holders and that clearly indicated the pizza wasn't hot. The manager responded with the metal pan doesn't retain heat. His response was unprofessional and condescending.  I wouldn't return to this location."
Nida A B.,"Anaheim, CA",214,101,69,4.0,3/25/2013,"can't go wrong with BJs! American food, so many options, and all in all great service! :)"
Sergio A.,"Irvine, CA",2,17,7,3.0,5/27/2013,"Good beer, very average chain restaurant food. All the people that rave about bj's pizza or food, are your typical weekday frozen diners that don't know any better.  Deep dish pizza?!... That shouldn't exist, if you want to try a real pizza try a Neapolitan pizza."
David L.,"Dublin, CA",145,185,,3.0,8/15/2014,The Margarita was delicious but overpriced and the small buffalo chicken pizza was enough to satisfy two guys on a Friday night. Our waitress was attentive and friendly. Nothing makes BJ's stand out from anywhere else though.
Drannab V.,"Irvine, CA",3,114,18,2.0,6/23/2014,"It's bar food, so I shouldn't expect much.  The food was good, but service was inconsistent and the dishes was abso-freaking-lutely filthy.  Sticky, slimey, spotted, and streaked cups, silverware, and plates.  As a rule of thumb, if you can see dirt, there's bacteria.  I didn't get sick, but I will be eating at a hobo's cardboard mansion before going back to this store."
Derek H.,"Cerritos, CA",76,27,,4.0,11/27/2014,"The food is simple, and nothing special, but  the number one thing that changes this place, are the pizookie. Nothing could ever finish a meal so perfectly like that. It is the best desert of my life."
Alannah E.,"San Diego, CA",137,67,169,3.0,4/17/2013,"went here after a Disneyland trip. not my first time at a BJ's but my first time to the location. i'm a fan of their deep dish pizza, especially since no deep dish pizzas compare to Uno's Pizzaria in which the San Diego locations unfortunately closed ... anyways, i digress!  the pizza is yummy, the cream soda and the orange cream soda are super tasty! the calamari is good. i also had their caprese salad. it was a nice, refreshing bite :) and what BJ's meal is complete without a pizookie!? pizookies are always good, no matter what time of day you're at the restaurant."
J. C.,"Irvine, CA",16,204,1,4.0,4/13/2013,I've always liked their pizzas and their in house brewery but we were going to go next door to iHop for some breakfast and iHop was way too packed so we decided to see if BJ's had breakfast which to our amazement they did. I had their CA BJ'S scrambler and it was awesome!!!  I chalk this good experience to maybe just not expecting anything great and getting something well great!!! If you want a good breakfast get the CA BJ'S scrambler with sour dough toast.
Jim R.,"Bellflower, CA",0,17,,1.0,12/26/2014,"These guys cannot get it right.  Tonight a take out for 2 items (BJs favorite and Cobb salad) proved far too much for the BJs staff.  I arrived as directed, only to be told I had a pineapple pizza and a Cobb salad.  Rather than continue waiting for them to get it right, I just walked.  You would be well advised to do the same and if you decide to visit this restaurant, then do not say you have not been warned."
Maria L.,"Tustin, CA",0,43,20,4.0,3/13/2014,Entrees are pretty good but the best part is the selection of pizzookies! YUM!!! Servers are always super nice. It does get busy after work & if there's a playoff game. Better to call ahead for a table.
Albert Y.,"Garden Grove, CA",94,5,,5.0,9/21/2014,3 stars??? I don't know why people are complaining about the service.  Service was great (I think her name was Carla) and the food was great like always.  People need to eat a pizookie and chill out.
Joseph K.,"Irvine, CA",94,29,20,3.0,7/5/2012,"I frequent this place with my friends for pizza and beer. It's not spectacular, but it gets the job done. Great deep dish pizza and cool craft beers. I haven't explored much else on the menu, but their wings and chicken sandwiches are pretty good. Stop by for lunch specials, which are actually pretty good deals. Pros: -Pizza -Beer -TVs EVERYWHERE -Friendly staff -Open late Cons: -GREASY HIGH CALORIE FOOD -Joseph"
Andrew B.,"Irvine, CA",17,151,1,2.0,3/14/2013,"It's a BJ's, so you should know what to expect. Stopped here on the way back from the airport, because it was one of the few places open late. Service was terrible, and the food was nothing more than OK. I mean, I can't say I won't be back, because it's quick, simple, and easy, but I won't go out of my way to eat here again."
Vanessa H.,"Bakersfield, CA",298,987,78,3.0,2/6/2012,"Once again I break my No Chains Rule to review an establishment whose food, service, and overall experience is meant to be uniform no matter which location you enter. Normally BJ's is a 4-star kinda place for me; I'll admit it. Their pizza is deeelish, and the Great White is one of my favorites. They have a good selection of beer, including their own house brews, and are usually clean and well-kept. But because of my solidly 2-star experience over the weekend, I'm averaging it out to 3 for this review. We had a group reservation, with a preset menu, for 21 at 6:00 on Friday night. The idea was that our pre-ordered food would be ready AT 6:00, and we could begin eating immediately. At 6:00, however, the front of the house folks insisted that we needed more people in our party in order for us to be seated. I get that you'd need this for a regular reservation (and it's a long shot to think that all 21 people would be on time), but for a group event where the food should ALREADY be ready, I'm not sure what the point is of making people wait simply because we haven't met some imaginary quota. Well, come to find out that the food ISN'T ready, and won't be ready for another 30-45 minutes. This was irksome not only because it wasn't what we had signed up for, but because some of us had pre-paid the event organizer and needed to grab a bite and leave early (and it would have been even MORE irksome to pay for food that we didn't end up eating). It was a disappointing experience -- not enough to prevent me from coming back, but enough to make me think twice about hosting a group event here."
Amy L.,"Irvine, CA",25,80,16,5.0,3/31/2012,"This is one of my FAVORITE restaurants even though its a chain restaurant.  Surprisingly my favorite things to order on the menu aren't the pizza dishes which is what everyone seems to love above everything else. Here's my top 3: (1) Medium rare rib-eye steak with crispy thin cut fries and a jumbo baked potato. Normally it comes with just sour cream and butter but my servers always gladly gives me a generous free side of cheese and bacon. (2) Any of their burgers!!! their HUGE and totally worth the money and they come with those crispy thin cut fries that i love so much as well. One of the newer additions, BJs bacon cheeseburger is a new favorite of mine.  (3) Gourmet mac and cheese... I always loved mac and cheese so of course I always like to order this. 3 cheeses and bacon included with bread crumbs on top. Best of all, it's only 4 dollars... too good to be true. Did i mention how big their jumbo baked potatoes are?!  There's probably loads of reviews on the pizookie already. Must save room for that."
Olivia G.,"London, United Kingdom",105,46,22,2.0,8/3/2014,"Really awful slow service. We waited 15 minutes for our order to be taken, another 15 for our 2 beers, another fifteen for our food, and it wasn't even busy. Food was OK, jambalaya was very greasy, but not terrible tasting. Fish and chips were OK, nothing special. We won't be back."
Daniel T.,"Kailua-Kona, HI",0,8,2,5.0,12/5/2015,"Ashley made the experience 5 star. Food and drinks were good, but service put it over the top. We had a large party and she took care of us, top notch."
