Ming-Jou C.,"Dallas, TX",1070,875,388,3.0,1/9/2010,"Yeah, second BJ('s) of the week. The jokes are endless. First visit to this location, right on the corner of Jamboree and Irvine Blvd. Party of 1 and seated right away for lunch on a Saturday. 10 different games on the screens going on simultaneously, but I just ordered me up a Pirahna Pale Ale chili baked potato, stuck my nose in my People magazine, and munched away. My potato was definitely smaller than the ones from the Torrance location, but only by a little bit. Size does matter, even when it comes to potatoes. I've come to realize that the chili as a stand-alone meal/soup was probably not that good as it was a tad on the thin side, but as a topping on a baked tater, or on a burger (as I also saw on the menu), I think it's muy simpatico. Service was fast and friendly.  I realize $9 is maybe a lot to pay for one baked potato, but when you gotta have it, you just gotta have it."
Kim N.,"Orange County, CA",64,83,238,5.0,3/20/2014,"My boyfriend and I have been coming here for happy hour on and off for the past year. Recently, we came across a very sweet waitress named Brittany. My boyfriend instantly liked her and I found that she was very attentive and good with customers. Today we witnessed something surprising and astonishing. We witnessed an act of kindness, something that I think is lacking in our society these days. My boyfriend and I entered the bar and found the last open table at about 6:05PM. A few moments later, a man came and looked around for an open table as well; there were none. He stood patiently against the wall and waited. Around the same time, Brittany had begun her shift and was walking around the tables introducing herself. Anyway, a table opened up about twenty minutes later; the man and another group from the other side of the bar got to the table at the same time. He generously gave the table up to them and went back to wait against the wall. I felt so bad for this guy and wanted hurry up and finish my meal so that I could give him our table but we were still waiting on some items to come out of the kitchen. Other waiters and employees walked back and forth, passing the man and ignoring him but Brittany noticed that he was still standing around and approached him. They talked for a minute and then she went to the front and had a few words with what looked like a manager. She came back to the man, directed him to the manager, and they sat him down in the main dining area. Brittany brought him the happy hour menu. Poor guy waited forty five minutes and made it just in time to order before happy hour was over. Props to Brittany for noticing him and helping him out. That was really awesome of her. My boyfriend and I were very moved by this and we honestly don't know if this happens often or not but we have never ever seen this take place before. I thought it was a really nice thing to do. Hell, it's almost midnight and I'm still shocked by the whole incident.  FOOD: I love the mini buffalo chicken deep dish pizza and my boyfriend is obsessed with the avocado egg rolls. A friend of mine always orders the potato skins. Mmm. Both the deep dish and egg rolls are $6 during happy hour. They have some good deals going on at that time. Happy hour takes place between 3PM - 7PM (which is why I like BJ's...I get off of work at 6PM and by then, most places no longer have happy hour) from Sunday to Thursday.  We will definitely be coming back again soon."
M M.,"Irvine, CA",1,37,41,5.0,7/3/2010,"What more can I say about a BJ's Pizookie besides it is a deep dish pan of incredible cookie goodness! I selected the original chocolate chunk Pizookie topped with two scoops of vanilla ice cream. The cookie was soft and chewy and oozed with milk chocolate chunks. The edges cripsy and chewy. The Pizookie is $5.95 and easily serves two (or one hungry Cookie Sleuth!). Peanut Butter, White Chocolate Macadamia Nut, and Oatmeal Raisin Pizookies are also available. Visit   for more reviews and recipes!"
Nelson E.,"Irvine, CA",0,23,,2.0,10/23/2015,"Had been a returning customer for many years when the food & service were always good.  The last visits (other than takeout pizza that is still good but over priced) were bad on both ends, even just happy hour at the bar.  Too bad because I do enjoy the wide selection of beers.  On one occasion, not only did my wife's fish come out later than my meal, it came out raw.  The first person I flagged down was a manager.  We conveyed that we had a bad experience on our last visit and all we got was a quick ""well I get right on this"".  I appreciate the urgency he showed but I guess I was just expecting a little more."
Jennifer P.,"Irvine, CA",208,25,,4.0,11/26/2014,"Love this place!  Service is always impeccable and super friendly here. Warm and friendly atmosphere. Pizookies are wayyyy too sweet to my liking, though. I'm always obsessed with the pizza here! Needs to work on making the dishes nice and hot when they're served!"
Todd S.,"Fountain Valley, CA",3,18,,5.0,10/18/2015,Had a great time this evening. Went to watch the baseball game and they changed the tv for me so I could watch the baseball game instead of the football games.  The server did not rush us and always made sure we had refills.  I always love going to BJs but never realized how great it was to watch sports too.
Thomas E.,"Orange, CA",0,1,,5.0,4/26/2014,A group of friends and I met at bjs yesterday. We didn't have a reservation but to our surprise they weren't super packed and the very friendly hostess seated us almost immediately on the patio. Brady and Devin took excellent care of us! We were pretty unorganized but they were super patient with us even though we were not in the dinning room. Our drinks were kept full and everything went smoothly even though some of my friends are pretty high maintainance! They even separated our check with a smile! Great service! Great food! I'll be back for sure!!
Seema R.,"Irvine, CA",1,1,,1.0,4/27/2015,"We went for a late lunch little after 1PM on 4/24/15.  It was not very busy.  We ordered food and lemonade for drink.  Food came but  no drink. We could not locate our server so asked another server to find ours as we need our drinks with our food.  They located her and she came apologizing with the drink.  We needed a refill.  Took us few minutes to locate her.  We requested her to get us refill.  20 minutes passed.  Neither refill nor our server came by. We again asked another server to help us locate our server or refill.  Our server again showed up surprised, "" Oh, you did not receive your refill ???? Let me go get it.. ""  This time drink a few sips of lemonade and all ice.  We asked her to get us refill as it was only ice.  Another 20 minutes passes, our food finished.  No sight of server or refill.  We again asked another server to help us get our check.  Our server showed up and was again surprised,, "" Oh, you did not receive your refill ????""   We were speechless.  On the way back we asked at reception, "" Is it usual to get refill after the food finished ? ""  We narrated our entire experience.  BJsresponse thunderstruck us.  They calmly replied,  No its not usual.  Sorry about that.  Please come back again."
Kimberley H.,"Laguna Hills, CA",21,172,19,4.0,11/18/2012,"This is a regular bar spot for me and some girlfriends, but this review is for a regular dinner I had last night with a friend. Our waitress was Ashley (I think? Blonde and under 21) and she was FANTASTIC. Personable, friendly, checked in with us on a regular basis without being annoying and really added to the experience (which is great to say because two very large groups on either side of the room began SCREAMING the ""happy birthday song"" repeatedly - so even with that annoyance, Ashley made it a really memorable dinner experience. THANK YOU ASHLEY! (I really hope that is your name, LOL)"
Taylor R.,"Irvine, CA",0,24,3,1.0,4/17/2015,"I came in for dessert which was great. But our waitress was pretty horrible. Once she noticed we were only getting dessert she was extremely rude, didn't greet us, dropped the check off didn't say goodbye or thank you, actually she didn't say anything! Very rude. Didn't smile. Awful. Made the experience uncomfortable. She was a middle-aged woman working the evening shift and had a ribbon tied around her pony tail."
Bryan N.,"Irvine, CA",11,43,111,5.0,10/11/2014,This is our go to place for weekend brunch and Sunday football.  Food is good portion and prices are reasonable.  My favorite beer is the Lindeman Framboise
Danielle D.,"Irvine, CA",119,329,146,1.0,2/7/2014,Silverware still had old dried up food on it. Absolutely disgusting. We asked to speak to management  and management never came. food was good as usually luckily I ordered a pizza which is finger food and don't have to depend on the disgusting silverware they serve. It definitely makes me question if the back of the house is up to date with current  Heath code. Really grosses me out and makes me question what is in my food!!!!
Elle C.,"Irvine, CA",63,670,605,3.0,10/11/2012,"Inconsistent service. Most of the time, it's been very pleasant; other times, we've been assigned inattentive servers. Our recent visit was very S-L-L-O-O-W-W! It wasn't busy (3 P.M.), yet it took 1:15 to be checked on after our initial order was delivered. When I requested more water, my glass was only 1/4 filled. We've decided to hold off on returning to BJ's for a while."
Peter P.,"San Clemente, CA",0,10,2,1.0,10/7/2015,"The WORST possible service. Not only is the whole hostess unplanned, but once you are actually given a table, the waiter is always slow and literally takes forever to show up. After this fiasco, you have to wait for much to long to actually get a drink. Plan for 35 minutes from arrival till you have a drink in your hand - at best"
Riggz D.,"Irvine, CA",0,3,,1.0,5/13/2014,"Let's start off by saying, BJ's lives up to its name, it sucks dick. Most servers (in this location) are snobby, uneducated, selfish, and self entitled imbeciles. I cannot believe how careless they are about their customers. For instance, my girlfriend asked for Parmesan and ended up asking the hostess. How is that appropriate? Come on give me a damn break, Blow Jobs! How can you treat or let your servers commit to such atrocious behaviors? Maybe you should send them to server boot camp to actually hone their skills in serving customers properly not carelessly and idiotically.  Another instance, I was there with my grandparents for their 70th anniversary for dinner. Our server took forever to take our orders and drinks. This server had curly blonde hair. After 20 minutes, she finally takes our order and by then my grandparents were very irritated. When the food came, I was very happy until I found a curly pubic-like hair on my fries. I was absolutely disgusted and it ruined my dinner with my grandparents. I honestly cannot stand this location. Just passing by it makes me vomit. Please close down or fix your staff because it's extremely negative for your business. I will never come back here again....hope the general manager reads this because it is urgent."
Brandon C.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",1,34,1,4.0,10/4/2014,"This location represents what  BJs is all about. Service was great, way better than the Rancho location which we stopped going to months ago...even though it is right down the street from our house.  Ordered kids meals, chicken salad and a pizza. We went for lunch, the service was great and very attentive, even when it was getting busy. Finished our meal with pizookies and everything was great.  The management and team training is far superior at this location compared to Rancho which is a total train  wreck.  This experience will bring us back to the BJs chain."
Shawn B.,"Irvine, CA",17,114,24,3.0,12/31/2012,Went here for the first time ever on Christmas Eve with my very large and loud Chinese family. Probably the best way to try a ton of items off the menu all in one meal.... We started with calamari and spinach dip.... Meh. Wouldn't order them again there. Tried the BBQ chicken and Thai mango chicken salads (I think) which were good. The ribs were good. We got an all meat pizza and a BJ house special pizza I think and they were ok.... I wasn't a huge fan of the crust.  We skipped dessert but my cousins swear by that cookie ice cream monster!
Courtney M.,"Irvine, CA",1,13,1,1.0,4/9/2015,"Tonight is just the straw that broke the camels back, as much as I love there food I am not going to spend the money if every time I go in I receive below average service. Last two times I have gone in I ordered an appetizer and yet again tonight, just like last time our entrees came before our appetizer. Then the server says I am sorry we can make it up w/ a free dessert and it took 15 minutes for the dessert that is supposed to fix the first mistake to come out. Worst part is the dessert tasted like it had been sitting Ready to go for a while, and the ice cream was basically a puddle. And lastly you think if the manager is notified the guests service has gone wrong he would make an effort to come over and apologize or make sure we are okay, but nope instead he just comped the cheaper dessert and left us to pay the more expensive one. Overall just so disappointed because there is nothing worse then loving a company's food but being drove away by continuous poor service!"
Yazeyn P.,"Tustin, CA",0,2,,5.0,11/8/2014,Best Beginnings Appetizer Combo is delicious I love!!.. The Avocado egg rolls :D....  The whole thing is good :D.....
Allison M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,3,,4.0,11/6/2014,Went in for dinner with friends. Our server seemed like a know it all but we made it through that and he was actually pretty attentive to us. The pizza is one of my favorites so keep it up. It was crowded but that's expected.
