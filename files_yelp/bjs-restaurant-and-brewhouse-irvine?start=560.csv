M L.,"Irvine, CA",379,413,196,4.0,8/10/2012,"I remember when I first heard of pizookies, I thought, what a stuuupid name. But I've fallen in love with them. I don't care how ridiculous it sounds. Nothing has me salivating like BJ's chocolate chip pizookie. Nothing. This is my hands down favorite dessert because it is so simple, yet so delicious. I just wish they served it with a glass of milk. If you don't know what it is, it is a fresh out of the oven, warm, gooey, giant chocolate chip cookie, with a couple scoops of french vanilla ice cream.  The pizza here is pretty good too. Not Chicago style, but decent deep dish pizza. It is a little pricey though for what it is. It is a very light and fluffy pizza, rather than dense and thick. They charge a dollar for toppings on a mini pizza which is ridiculous. Because that's like 3 pepperonis, and 5 jalapenos for me.  Minus one star because the servers here seem to constantly be on their period. More often than not, they are pretty bitchy and unpleasant."
Emilio G.,"Santa Ana, CA",127,20,7,2.0,1/4/2012,"I have been a client of this particular location for many many years now, I have been here at dinner time, lunch time and brunch. I have been at this place waiting outside in the cold for over 45 minutes when they are slammed, I know quality and service at this place, that's why I have to give them this particular harsh review. THere are 2 things I like about my food, my food being fresh and I like asking questions about my food so that I can educate myself and the person who is waiting my table educates me, it is a give and take situation for me. I am very open minded and tolerant when it comes down to food, and since I have worked at waiting tables before, i know how difficult it could get.  During my last visit, I noticed it was not very busy, not a lot of people eat out on a tuesday night. I had a great date at the Laguna play house and I thought I would close the date by having dinner in a place I knew and introduce my date to something she had never experienced, that went sour really fast. It took a very long time to get our drinks ordered and since my date was new to the place and BJ's brews their own beer, I asked the waitress to explain the differences of beer to my date, the flat out answer was "" beer is just beer, just darker colors"". I felt offended and I thought about leaving inmediately and ask for a manager but my date asked me not to. Next thing, was ordering an apetizer, I love the avocado egg rolls here, but that night, they came with ice, that's correct, you read correct, the sliced carrots that came with my hot egg rolls had Ice in them, when I asked where the ice came from, I was told it came from the freezer.  I asked for my bill, got up and left. I ended up in tacos de anda in downtown santa ana that night eating burritos and drinking horchata and happy. I will never come back to this location on a tuesday night. I hope people who run this place train all of their staff to be poeple friendly and give proper explanations of the products they are serving."
Kevin L.,"Fontana, CA",338,20,13,3.0,6/28/2014,"I like BJ's, but this place was just ""okay"" in terms of food. However, my review is based on just the food itself. Our waiter and waitress were very friendly, (though I wish that they had noticed my empty water cup more frequently) but they were very accommodating even though we came around 11 PM with a group of almost 10. Located in a nice area, maybe it was just that day that the food was just ""okay"""
Dom R.,"Irvine, CA",0,1,1,1.0,8/16/2013,"Worst BJ I've ever had! First of all my soup came out before our drinks. It was cold. Sent it back only to have cold soup in a burning hot bowl. Microwaved? Yeah probably. Then when we got our food, our server was no where to be found. I was scared to finish my drink knowing she may never return. Then the most important part. What the hell happened to BJ's pizza? I was expecting a thick crust pizza, not a piece of cardboard with toppings. Never again will I throw money away like that. Next time I want BJ'S ill stay home!"
D M.,"Chino Hills, CA",0,10,,1.0,8/22/2014,"Worst customer service I've ever had . I went there at 6;00 n after waiting for 30 min  The waitress didn't even greed me . After we got seated , the menu that I got was very greasy n oily . Waiting for 30 more min n nobody even stopped my our table or even offer water  Seriously I will never go there again ."
Liz O.,"Anaheim, CA",0,5,,1.0,9/19/2015,"Management is the worst.  Horrible service. A few weeks ago I came in, the water glass was filthy and had all kinds of stuff floating in it.  Last week my daughter and I came in for a bazooki and pizza, someone broke a glass in the patio and the server lead us to walk right over it. This week, we are watching the USC-Stanford game, they change the game on the 4th qtr and refuse to chage it back. Who does that?  Terrible service too many times, not quite sure why I even came back today. Won't make that mistake again."
Emily K.,"Irvine, CA",291,13,2,1.0,7/25/2015,usually when I come here I don't have a bad word to say. however yesterday's visit was something I had to let off some steam because it still isn't sitting well with me.  so my boyfriend and I came here for a late lunch around 3 and it was dead. we got seated pretty quickly so that was good. however no one brought us menus or took out drink order for at least 10-15 minutes. then after we order drinks it took another 10 minutes to receive them.  then out waitress never came around to take out food order until much later. when she finally did she seemed really rushed even though it was practically empty. our food came out at an okay speed. not the fastest but nothing too extreme. our waitress came by once to ask how everything was we said it was good but asked for a glass of water.  well she never returned with our water and after we finished we sat there for another 30 minutes waiting for our bill. we finally got so sick of waiting we put down some cash thinking it would more than cover it. food was good. but the service is what killed it for us. horrible wait staff. we couldn't even get a simple glass of water or even our bill. very subpar and disappointed overall
Sarah C.,"Redwood City, CA",335,284,124,2.0,1/11/2012,"This BJ's is definitely better than the one back home in Tanforan. Every time i've come here it's been really clean and there has never been a wait. The food is okay too, but if you really want to score a deal come for happy hour. Ah yes, happy hour! Half off deep dish pizzas, a couple dollars off of appetizers, and depending on the night really good deals on drinks. My only problem with this is that i've never had good service when i've come for happy hour. I understand the bar area gets busy but it's still no excuse for bad attitude, messing up on orders, and extreme waiting times. On one occasion our waitress gave my party serious attitude and then decided to complain about us to the bartender. WOW. You do realize we're sitting a few tables away and that we can hear what you're talking about right?  The second time was more recent and my boyfriend and I went to happy hour for a few snacks. The waiter was obviously frazzled from all the tables he was dealing but that's no excuse for forgetting to put in an order! I ordered a tomato and mozzarella salad it never came out. I know you think you're cool and you can remember people's orders but if you're going to screw up you should probably write it down in the future. I also asked for ranch and he completely forgot about it until I reminded him and he was like ""oh yeah you asked for that"".   The manager was going around some of the tables asking about dinner. He went to the table next to us and the people complained about long waiting times. It ends up the waiter forgot to put in their order. Too bad the manager didn't swing by my table, I would've complained about my missing order!"
Teresa P.,"La Habra, CA",308,197,273,3.0,6/22/2010,"Went here for a birthday dinner. Birthday girl was expecting 20 people. We got seated at two parallel tables in the back of the restaurant. 11 people showed up at the reservation time. Birthday girl elected to hold off on ordering to see if some stragglers would show up. Our server repeatedly checked on her to see if she was ready to start. Finally, an hour later (in which only three more people had appeared), he told her that he wasn't going to start taking orders until she gave the go ahead. Thankfully, she finally gave the go ahead. I paged through that thick menu over and over. I never found the secret cheaper menu. I ordered the parmesan chicken and a side cup of clam chowder. Our server was very cordial, and took the time to answer my questions about the soup. He even moved closer to me so he could make sure he heard what I was saying. He even smiled and said he liked the parm chicken, and that he usually felt sleepy after eating it. I really really liked him. Unfortunately, a few minutes later, he introduced his replacement, since his shift was ending. (Remember, we waited for an hour before ordering, not his fault). His replacement was indifferent. She brought the food and not much else. I saw other servers milling around, including one guy who looked perpetually surprised. He was fun to watch, until I realized that he just always looks that way, and that there wasn't anything continually surprising him. One of the girls from the other table came over and sat with us for a while, bringing her drink with her. The restaurant is so loud, I couldn't hear what she was saying. I ended up watching dads bring wayward kids out to the back walkway to burn off energy. (BJ's really needs a PlayPlace at the back of the restaurant). The chowder came very quickly. It was tasty, thick and meaty. Not too salty. I couldn't identify what they'd used to thicken it, though. The parm chicken also came quickly - shortly after I'd finished the soup. It was better than I thought it would be: two big flattened chicken breasts with a crispy golden parmesan coating. Served with a paltry amount of broccoli and a nice mound of white cheddar mashed potatoes. The lemon butter sauce under the chicken was quite tasty. I liked it a lot, but there was too way little of it. There was also too little of the grated cheese and tomatoes. Parts of my chicken tasted just a bit off. I ordered a pizookie to go. Because of this, our server held my table's check. Once one of the guys finally convinced our server to bring the check, I noticed that the drink of the girl who had joined us had been added to our bill, while remaining on the other table's check. It was a big hassle to get it removed. Our server brought another server, who didn't want to deal with taking it off and said she wasn't authorized to take it off. Eventually it got taken off. I needed a to go box. Our new server took initiative and brought two boxes for the couple who'd ordered pizza. She bypassed me completely. It was like pulling teeth to get service out of her. The couple ended up up using one box, so the server gave me the other. The pizookie to go was packaged with the warm cookie in a bag, and the ice cream in a cup, separate from the cookie. In short, food's okay, with large portions. Service varies from pretty good to awesomely awful. Food comes out quickly at least. This isn't a place I'd choose to visit, but if people want to celebrate here, I'll probably come."
Chris C.,"Los Angeles, CA",3239,810,14322,4.0,9/10/2013,"Have you ever heard of the infamous Pizookie? If not, then what planet are you from?? The Pizookie is a fresh and warm baked cookie (white chocolate, macadamia nut, chocolate chip, etc.) topped with ice cream and served in a mini pizza style pan. BJ's Restaurants Inc. is credited for creating this mouthwatering dessert that most of us enjoy. Not to mention the fact that this restaurant and microbrewery chain (with over 130 locations nationwide) also creates some enticing entrees that makes me cringe as to whether I should be eating something with such high calorie content. The Irvine location is always packed in the late evenings because the city is such a quiet community, that everything closes before 10PM. I've never really had any issues with the service here, except that they do sometimes rush you since there's so much foot traffic waiting to be served. The only other problem is finding something to eat, meaning I categorize my decision based on - Should I eat something fattening or go with something healthy? And the word healthy in this case, isn't all that safe and sound as you think. HERE'S YOUR BJ * Pick your style of pizza (deep dish, flat bread, hand tossed, gluten free thin crust). They're known for creating some delectable pies and these are my favorites - California Club, Black & Bleu, Great White, and BJ's Favorite. * Appetizers - Spinach & Artichoke Dip, Avocado Egg Rolls. * Roasted Turkey Cobb Sandwich - Roasted turkey breast, tomatoes, avocado, Applewood smoked bacon, bleu cheese dressing, lettuce and Dijon mayonnaise. Served on a toasted garlic cheese French roll. Don't forget the pickles, potato wedges, and ranch dressing. * Fresh Atlantic Salmon - Flame Broiled or Blackened Salmon fillet served with Lemon Chardonnay butter sauce, rice pilaf, and steamed vegetables. * BJ's Brewhouse Blonde Shrimp - Lightly fried Panko Crusted butterflied shrimp (made with BJ's Brewhouse Blonde beer batter), served with thin fries, creamy coleslaw, house made tartar and cocktail sauces. BJ'S AWARD WINNING, HAND CRAFTED BEERS * LightSwitch Lager, Brewmaster's Reserve Blonde Lager, Brewhouse Blonde, Harvest Hefeweizen, Piranha Pale Ale, Hopstorm IPA, Jeremiah Red, Nutty Brewnette, P.M. Porter, Tatonka Stout, Brewmaster's Reserve Imperial Red Ale, Annual Grand Cru, Oasis Amber, Nit Wit, Oktoberfest, Pumpkin Ale, Field Day IPA, Pook's Pilsner. PARMESAN CRUSTED CHICKEN For some strange reason, this dish always moonwalks onto my bill. Marinated chicken breast coated with Parmesan cheese and crunchy Panko bread crumbs, lightly pounded and pan fried till it's golden brown. Paired with white cheddar mashed potatoes, I add onion strings to replace the steamed broccoli. All topped with Lemon Chardonnay butter sauce, sun dried tomatoes, fresh basil, and Parmesan cheese. It's what I commonly refer to as - THE GAME CHANGER."
andrew c.,"Englewood, NJ",0,19,2,1.0,7/10/2015,This place is garbage.  The female blonde manager at the bar wouldnt accept a photo ID of my passport for a beer and didnt even glance at my ID. I have graying hair and some gray on my beard. Really?  Also told the dumb manager I was Veteran. Will never go here again. Also the bartender kept brushing me off as if he didnt want to bother serving me and my wife. First and last experience for a restaraunt named after a wholesale supermarket. Pure garbage service.  For my veteran brothers Do Not Waste Your Hard Earned Money Here!  Blacklist!  I will do all in my power to make sure nobody I know goes to this establishment!
Andrew M.,"Los Angeles, CA",485,513,127,4.0,7/25/2010,"Sure, it's not really a special restaurant. But after not going here since senior year of high school, I was enthusiastic about coming back. Service was fast and really attentive. My friend and I ordered a medium barbeque chicken pizza and it was every bit as good as I hoped. I actually liked it better than the pizzas I had at California Pizza Kitchen; I guess I just prefer deep dish pizzas more. The pizza was really fresh from the oven and the ingredients were all tasty.  Pizookies are awesome! Try the mini trio to get a taste for variety."
She M.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,35,2,4.0,7/25/2014,Had happy hour there today. What a great way to end a very stressful week. The bar area has open seating and allows for both large and small groups. Great place for impromptu meet ups.
John M.,"Orange, CA",0,8,,5.0,9/27/2015,"OLU homecoming dinner was great for the kids and the bar food doe parents. The wings, pizza, and old fashion made the night very enjoyable for all."
Carlsbad Family F.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,6,,1.0,2/18/2016,"Getting worse and worse every time we visit. First of all, the first time we ate here, we walked in at opening which was 11am; we were told to wait for a table. They did not want to sit people right away, all the tables were available, not until we ""heard"" the manager tell the hostess ""start sitting people at tables."" The next time we ate here, we arrived at 11am, we were told there are no servers available so we would have to sit at the bar area if we wanted to be served. Really? Then, I ordered the all you can eat soup & salad lunch special, I order a second bowl of tomato soup. The waitress tells me, ""sorry, we don't have any more soup ready, their making it in the back it'll be awhile.""  This location of BJ's is unprofessional, not ready for customers when they open, they don't have what you order available, my husband and I will NEVER go back to BJ's on Jamboree Rd., I predict in time this location will go out of business."
Herald L.,"Irvine, CA",457,52,49,4.0,5/15/2012,"FEAR NOT. SHE HAS NOT LEFT US. My favorite waitress is still at BJ's (see previous post). Chalk it up to bad luck that we haven't seen her for months. She was pissed at me for the last post and she asked me to do a major edit, so per her request, I add the following: She NEVER slept on public couches while waiting to check in again. During the course of the Reno bender, she vomited in her own pants. Update over. Lemon, out."
Eric M.,"San Diego, CA",41,69,24,4.0,1/29/2012,"So BJ's has hundreds and hundreds of reviews, we all know what kind of place this is and what it brings to the table.  The reason i feel the need to comment is this.  Typically this is a three star place, my review is based on Happy Hour when mini pizzas are half off and beer is discounted.    Mini pizzas have the perfect amount of everything, i honestly think they taste way better than the full size pizza.  They are a taste anomaly, they shouldn't be as good as they are.  Yet they still manage to be mouth watering.   As far as beer goes, Jeremiah Red is a good one, my go to beer when at BJ's.  A Pizookie is a must, its a fat kids dream haha.      So like i said, this a 4 stars only during happy hour when everything is discounted.  Otherwise i usually tend to pass on it.  On second thought, im giving the Pizookie 5 stars on its own.  Those things are just damn delicious, lets go get one right now.  Your buying."
Kristin T.,"Irvine, CA",0,8,,1.0,7/12/2015,"Servers were very friendly ""when you cld find one"". Order came out all wrong. Took them FOREVER to bring out the right stuff. I think they make their food at another location & ship it here!!!! Also manager is an idiot. She came to tell us sorry then comped us for a meal we never got!!! Why the heck wld I pay for a meal they never gave us!!!!"
Capabel P.,"Newport Beach, CA",32,68,1,4.0,5/1/2012,"New to the area so tried out BJ's since it was close.  There was a NBA game on so the house was packed.  The wait for 2 was 30 min so we found a seat at the bar.  Tiny seats, but no waiting so it's all good.  Tried the beer sampler and it was really good.  Then we ordered the Buffalo Chicken Pizza.  I was surprised it came out in 10-15 min because there wasn't an empty seat in the house.  The waitress was cool, but didn't bother bringing a spatula for the pizza.  No big deal just dig in and grub.  Pizza was really good and the thick crust was great.  Needed a little extra sauce and although we asked for some it never arrived.  Seems like the waitress was new so -1 star for that.   Tired a pazuki (however you spell it) and it came out fast and was pretty good.   I always enjoy BJ's and this new location was just as good as the rest.  Hopefully I'll get a waitress that's on the ball next time!"
Jamie W.,"Marina del Rey, CA",680,959,356,4.0,6/2/2010,"We have this running joke at our house where every time I see something going out of business or a ""for lease"" sign up in RSM I always say, ""Hey... maybe they should put in a BJ's..."" Doesn't matter what it is either. I will stand by the idea that the under performing church on my street should be renovated into a BJ's immediately. We've been going to this BJ's in particular since we moved to California. The food is always good, the service is decent and the prices are okay for a trendy brew house. My favorites are the Cobb salad, the chicken strips and of course any of the pizzas.  The only things I don't care for is the parking situation and that it's always stupid busy (doesn't matter what time). Because of this I go the take out route once in a while.  It's interesting that they put a Lazy Dog Cafe in the same parking lot. I'm sure the people at BJ's were less than impressed, especially since it's half way decent.  Anyway, I'd probably weigh 500 lbs. if there were a BJ's within a stone's throw from my house so it's probably a good thing that we have to travel to get to one."
