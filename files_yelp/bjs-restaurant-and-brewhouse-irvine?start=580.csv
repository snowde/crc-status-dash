Zul C.,"Irvine, CA",12,4,2,3.0,9/8/2014,BJ's in Irivine feels pleasent and inviting when you first enter. You are greated warmly and attentively. So the people working here are great. The food here leaves me wanting. The several dishes I have tried here is not very tasty. Especially the pasta dishes.
Fred B.,"Glendale, CA",507,122,,3.0,11/20/2011,"TIP:  Iphone users - this BJ's is one of those special ones that has an app that you can download and reserve a table from the comfort of your home!   (I wish the BJ's near my house had this)  We arrived on a Friday night, and were told there was a 40 minute wait.  (Damn group of 45 ahead of us.. always makes things interesting)  We were waiting next to the host check-in table when two ladies walked in and got seated immediately.  Which made me ask questions right away!  (Queue:  Iphone app)  We had some beers and a party platter pizooki.  (Perfect for parties of 5 or more...) Our party of 3 killed the entire thing.  I'm still licking my chops...  Remember the Iphone App (Wonder if Siri can do that) and the Party Pizooki!  TFR"
Rick G.,"Tustin, CA",0,6,,3.0,9/5/2015,"BJ's is a nice place to go if you want to watch a game and have a couple of beers, or to just meet some friends for a get together. Will be back."
Mabel T.,"Irvine, CA",0,8,,3.0,7/27/2015,Bj's is falling thru the cracks. What used to be a good restaurant with a nice atmosphere is now becoming outdated with its eight page menu and appearance. But much  worse then that is their lack of keeping there restrooms and dinning room clean.
Brian C.,"Irvine, CA",38,122,24,4.0,8/22/2011,"went here saturday nite for my first nephew's birthday.  it was a good dinner everything was great except for the dum expeditor brought our two pizzas to the wrong table next to us... i dont mind the mistake, we all make them, but upon hearing from the party that the pizzas were not theirs, she continued to let the pizza just sit there while laughing and talking up a storm about how the numbers got all mixed up. i mean, by all means, get the pizza off their table and to our table immediately. dont let it sit there while subjecting it to other customers' and your saliva spray while in the meantime getting it a bit cooler.  fortunately, that other party was a party of gentlemen and gentleladies they knew it was ours and just smiled and did not say much other than answer ""no"" to the expeditor's questions. so it was only the expeditor's saliva spray we had to worry about. however our server was a smart and quick guy. someone i suspect would be moving on to other better professional jobs and higher positions just on the basis of how he worked. unlike that ditzy expeditor; im sure she'll be retiring there."
Chloe H.,"Tustin, CA",26,48,12,2.0,8/20/2015,"This review is based off of one bad experience I have had here. My friends were already seated and had a drink/food order placed before I got there (I was just joining them for a drink), the server came back around once I was seated and asked my friends how they were doing without even acknowledging a new person was at the table and I was sitting closest to the edge with no drink and an open menu (clue that maybe I want to order??) Well she started to walk away still without even acknowledging me! I had to flag her down and let her know I wanted to order, I understand she had a lot of tables but she didn't even let me speak before trying to walk away. Also once she walked away my friends mentioned she had quite the attitude which was very apparent! She had the attitude of she did not want to be working and was not trying to make our experience enjoyable. Before we were ready to leave we mentioned it to some woman who was walking around to tables (she was a fill in manager or from another location - cant remember exactly) and her solution was to offer us free dessert, which granted that was nice but we had said we were full and would pass, well she came around two more times trying to get us to take the free dessert! After multiple times of telling her no she finally brought the check and said she was sorry for our bad experience and that they had sent the server home (which they did - we saw her out in the parking lot). We were surprised she didn't comp anything off the bill as we didn't take the dessert. This wont stop me from coming back to BJ's in general but I will be avoiding this location from now on."
Anita D.,"Huntington Beach, CA",52,187,65,3.0,6/14/2012,"Plan on rushing in and out and focus solely on food and ordering if you come here. The service is very rude and impatient with a lot of forgetful, inexperienced staff members.  Food is okay, just like Cheesecake factory with a huge menu selection, but not the best food quality."
Sarah H.,"Yorba Linda, CA",2,26,3,2.0,1/3/2014,"Honestly, this used to be my favorite place to eat in Irvine. Now I don't think I'll return. Last time I was there, the service was terrible, the restaurant was so loud that I couldn't hear my friend talk, and they had gotten rid of one of the few things I can eat there as a gluten-free person: the potato. The only things on the gluten-free dinner menu were ridiculously expensive. I ended up with an overpriced, mediocre steak. The server wouldn't work with me at all on my gluten-free diet restrictions. So disappointing."
Jannelle W.,"Tustin, CA",33,26,13,1.0,11/24/2013,"This event happened a year ago, but I didn't notice that the review failed to post until now. What prompted me to post it after so long is the fact that this restaurant made me wait 45 minutes to process my payment, added back an item that was complimentary removed by the manager, and had the audacity to add gratuity after the server forgot to do so the first time he came by with the check. I went here for my close friend's 21st birthday party. This is by far the WORST dining experience I have regretfully not enjoyed. First of all, there was a hair in my avocado egg rolls. I politely told the sever, so they removed the item, and the manager brought out a new avocado egg roll. So that was perfectly fine. However, we asked to split the check for a party of 11. The server informed me they don't split checks for parties of 8 or more because it is ""easier for the servers."" I politely asked for it to still be split since I know it can be done. I waited 45 minutes for this split check to be done and charged. My boyfriend had to go to the hostess podium to request someone over to charge our checks. On top of all of this? The manager apparently charged the avocado egg rolls AGAIN after removing them on the previous check. Thank you to our server, Rob, for ruining my friend's 21st birthday."
David W.,"Santa Ana, CA",22,44,63,3.0,11/7/2010,"This was my first BJ experience and I was left a little disappointed.  I figured since it's a brewhouse, I couldn't miss with a house beer.  So I ordered their seasonal Pumpkin Ale and it was very mediocre, at best.  My brother ordered their new IPA and he said it was poor.  Even their porter, which the waitress obligingly switched it out for, was just fair.  I sent my beer back and went with a Hoergaarden in the bottle because I knew it would be good and, in all fairness, they have a strong selection of excellent beers brewed by others. I ordered their Jambalaya for dinner.  I have never been to Cajun country, so I can't compare BJ's to one from New Orleans but I can say it was the best Jambalaya I've ever had!  The shrimp was cooked perfectly, with just a bit of crispiness but mostly tender.  Of course, you can't go wrong with Andouille sausage and the chicken was blackened, which added a nice flavor.  The vegetables were cooked down into a delicious, spicy sauce but not so much so as to become indistinguishable one from the other.  The portion was generous enough that I took half home for lunch tomorrow. The servers were friendly and accommodating.  The atmosphere was fun.  I also had a great view of the football game.  All-in-all, it was a fair experience, so I'll likely go for more BJs."
Rama N.,"Tustin, CA",111,40,15,5.0,8/10/2012,As a vegetarian I love going to places that have a whole slew of meatless options to choose from.  My favorite item on the menu is the spinach/artichoke pizza and YES and they can make it for you on a gluten free crust (which tastes better than the real crust).   For those that want options (especially large groups) this is a good place to go to.
Bryan D.,"Newport Beach, CA",0,3,,1.0,7/5/2015,"While I have loved every BJ's experience I've had up to this point, this was a pretty bad one.  The hostess brought us to a booth that had syrup all over the seats, which I conveniently found out after I sat in it.  After un-sticking myself from the booth and walking over with syrup all over the back side of my shorts and shirt to let them know, no one even apologized or seemed to care.  As an employee in the restaurant industry, any classy establishment would have handled differently.  If you don't want to deal with a rude, careless, and standoffish staff, there are plenty of other great options  in the area."
Chris E.,"Palo Alto, CA",38,10,9,2.0,8/21/2011,"We went for lunch this past Friday. I had the California Chicken Sandwich and it was yummy! So why the 2 star review? Because the service was crap. Crap I tell ya. The hostess was rude. And this wasn't isolated to us, I watched her interaction with everyone else that came in while we were waiting. ""Stand to the side"" got the same perplexed face from each guest she threw it at, but she's either socially clueless or just doesn't care because she used the same approach with everyone. And then there was our waitress. She was pleasant enough, but kinda clueless and definitely didn't care. I asked for one of the specialty drinks i saw on the sign in the entryway (the one we just waited in at the hand of the rude hostess). I remembered the ingredients but not the exact name. The waitress didn't know those drinks, which I suppose is forgivable, but instead of offering to go figure out which one I was talking about (there were only 3 on the sign) she just asked if I wanted something different. And then I ordered a salad instead of fries with my sandwich but it came out with fries. Also forgivable, except that the sandwich came out via a runner who quickly scurried off and the waitress didn't do the ""did everything come out ok? anything else I can get you?"" visit.  With so many food options out there I can't imagine we'll be going back to BJ's, though I admit the Pizookie is tempting. BJ's = Meh."
Tiffany L.,"Huntington Beach, CA",38,46,83,5.0,4/18/2014,"I LOVE coming here. I always get the Irish Root beer made with BJ's root beer. Pizza is always amazing. Deep dish is hands down the best. I have eaten the Angel Hair Classico twice already and love it every time. Tonight I drank the Berry burst Cider (fruity and not too much). And always a must is getting a pazookie at the end of your meal. I got the mini, unless you are sharing, get the large."
ChickaPea P.,"Newport Beach, CA",17,418,3,1.0,5/26/2014,bleh- what happened? I used to frequent this place last year but due to my work schedule haven't had a moment to swing by. Decided to order to-go during this holiday weekend and the pizza was awful! it was so soggy and oily and lacked flavor. I should have just ordered papa  johns and saved the money. The only thing that was decent were the wings and dessert we ordered. VERY sad about the quality of pizza we received.
Sonia G.,"Tustin, CA",29,18,1,2.0,12/23/2014,"long wait time to be seated (all the time) & service is ridiculously slow! food is good, but not worth the wait."
Ryan J.,"Tustin, CA",0,1,,5.0,7/25/2015,This place has the best food I would come again.The server that you want to pick is glen he's the best
J S.,"Irvine, CA",86,400,11,4.0,5/26/2011,"Beer is pretty good.  I like the porter.   I also like the beers they have on tap, as they carry a couple of Belgian beers that I prefer. Service is very nice.   They are attentive servers and bartenders. They have a good happy hour.   I wish there were fewer people here, and they were open til 2AM.    Lazy Dog seems like a better place to go to for late night happy hour, and later closing hours."
Mary J.,"Seattle, WA",411,169,230,4.0,3/24/2011,"Food: 4 stars All their Giant Stuffed Potatoes get a 5 stars--- huge, delicious, generous toppings. Avocado Egg Rolls: 6 stars out of 5 :) Rich and tasty Pizookie: 4 stars Fresh hot deep dish chocolate chip cookie with scoops of vanilla ice cream. Mmm. Beer Selection: 4 stars Service at this location: 2 stars I went to get a to-go order, which should take fast since I didn't need a table, I felt as though I had to jump through hoops to get the staff's attention. Hope the experience is better next time!"
Isadora T.,"Garden Grove, CA",1,9,,4.0,1/5/2013,"Steak nom nom nom And the potato fries and broccoli weren't bad either. Dined here for my brother's mission leave, he really enjoyed his pizzookie. Excellent service but was packed."
