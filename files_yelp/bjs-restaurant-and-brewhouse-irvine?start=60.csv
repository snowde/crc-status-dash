John P.,"Irvine, CA",0,1,,5.0,10/31/2017,As someone who works in irvine I can't emphasize enough how great it is to have a place open to get a drink at after 9pm. Miley the cocktailer and Phil the bartender always take the utmost care of us and make our night after work always perfect. We will always be back to BJS in irvine just due to them!
Katie M.,"Irvine, CA",0,5,,1.0,12/13/2017,"Do yourself a favor and DO NOT order curbside takeout here. Every single time it takes so much longer than the estimated pick up time, it's as if they don't even start making it until you get there. They also never fail to forget something out of the order. The last straw for me was last night when they forgot to give me a whole entire pizza."
Stevo L.,"Newport Beach, CA",13,107,20,4.0,7/12/2017,"So they overcooked my burger twice! Yes twice! So why am I giving them 4 stars? Keep reading. I was really pissed and didn't want anything to eat at that point because the others at my table were done eating. So my waiter Sloan saw I was picking at my burger pretty much because I had to eat something. He slides one more attempt onto the table and says, ""Hey if your gonna pick at something, try this one instead"". Ok, nice approach and guess what, it worked. The burger was perfect as I saw on the menu. Delicious and moist and wonderful. They came by to give me a $15 gift card and a free pizookie. To say this was a miraculous recovery is an understatement.  Well done manager Maggie and well done Sloan"
Rabia A.,"Irvine, CA",0,1,,1.0,11/22/2017,"So my friend and I wanted to go to BJs after a very long day and knowing that this place is very crowded, we asked ahead of time to be informed that the wait was only 30 minutes. Because we love the food at bjs, we decided to wait. However, after roughly 40 minutes I asked again and they said we had to wait another 30 minutes. Angry and hungry we decided to go someplace else to eat but on our way there, about 10 minutes later, we got a text from bjs saying our table is ready. This has caused me to lose all respect for BJs and I urge people not to go to this restaurant especially on a busy night. Not only is the wait ridiculously long but the waiters do not know how to manage the wait times. Never going to this restaurant again. Waste of good food. The waiters are also incapable of serving food. They don't give out utensils or napkins and forget about the food"
Britany S.,"Anaheim, CA",85,70,4,3.0,6/27/2017,"I don't know how many stars to give this place... We've been here twice in 6 months and I have mixed emotions. Our server tonight was very nice but wasn't the most efficient... he never cleared plates and the table got very messy and cluttered. We started stacking plates and they still weren't cleared until we were paying our bill. Our last visit the waiter was very nice but very slow and had too many tables so the service took forever... Both times we have come, the avocado egg rolls have been burnt, which is slightly disappointing; but they are still delicious. The pizza tonight was burnt as well and so was the balsamic chicken... maybe the food is spending too much time under the heat lamps while waiting for the servers and runners to take them to the table...?  Overall, I always recommend BJ's but be prepared to wait and eat burnt food..."
Jacob L.,"Moreno Valley, CA",225,13,4,5.0,10/19/2017,"When my family and I went to this BJ's, I think one of their devices/programs were down, but they worked really hard to get us seated and serviced. Once we were seated, our server Briana W. did an excellent job and was attentive and extremely helpful. She gave wonderful suggestions and did not rush us at all. My family and I were very thankful for her service and I think that this service alone deserves 5 stars for the restaurant. The food was very good and came out quickly. Awesome job, BJ's."
Trudy L.,"Buena Park, CA",11,319,335,2.0,9/5/2016,"I loved the quality and happy hour price of appetizer ahi poke. The server even replaced poorly cooked dry rice with avocado cubes and green lettuce which was a surprise! However, that mosquitos bite turned me off, after I felt comfy in an air conditioned area. I'll come back to try other foods but will remind myself to wear pants next time."
William B.,"Whittier, CA",0,23,2,5.0,10/3/2017,"Very friendly  waitress, food was prompt , delicious. They didn't need up on my order (no onions allergic) ."
Steve E.,"Los Angeles, CA",347,5,10,2.0,7/25/2017,"Last and only trip to that location for sure. I've been in fine dining 40 years and had a corner table which gave us a panarama view of utter chaos. Dirty plates left sitting by POS terminal for ages before being picked up. Wrong food going to wrong tables.. long delays between courses, and it was mid afternoon, not rush hour. Over cooked skins, a decent jalapeno burger, the small pizza was good. Pizooki was burned around the edges. Need I say more. Amanda had downloaded your app., And has now deleted it since we were so disgusted. Thank you! Steve"
C.R. V.,"VALLEY VILLAGE, CA",162,37,4,3.0,9/14/2017,"I love BJ's, I really do. I have been to several and can say that they are one of the few chains whose food is consistent. (Consistently YUMMY!) They have a great selection for adults and kids, as well. They train their wait staff very well for customer service, The reason why I am giving this location only three stars though is because whoever buses the tables needs to be trained as well. If someone gets up to use the restroom that is not a queue to clear the table. Seriously!"
Judith G.,"Tustin, CA",7,31,49,4.0,6/26/2017,Always have a good experience here. The service is fast and the servers are very friendly and willing to give helpful tips on the menu. They have specials for everyday in week!
Donna M.,"Irvine, CA",0,39,,3.0,12/7/2017,"I do take out weekly.  The take out staff in person is simply amazing.,,but the whole process needs to be revamped.  The orders are often not ready when they state they are ready (today I waited 25-30 mins over the estimated time) and my order kept on being incorrect (they left items out twice).  The deal of the day cannot be factored in the online orders (you do not get the discounted prices)(coupons also do not seem to work online).  There seems to be a lot of technological errors plus factoring in the common human errors (busy restaurant)...the BJ's take out order  is one too many times a frustrating experience.  The food is terrific and the people seem to have great customer service...But  I don't want to have to be so vigilant on a simple order."
Cristi R.,"Tustin, CA",0,6,,5.0,11/26/2017,"Delicious food and great service. We placed our order ahead of time using the BJ's app. Once we arrived at the restaurant, we were seated quickly and our drinks were brought right out, followed quickly by our appetizers and pizza. As much as we love the pizookies, we decided to try the beignet for dessert this time. I highly recommend it! It was light, fluffy and deliciously covered in ice cream, whipped cream and strawberries."
Suzan L.,"Irvine, CA",23,17,2,3.0,9/13/2017,It's a good happy hour but food service during happy hour was very slow they were not fold the capacity like they have been the past couple years
Mark M.,"Irvine, CA",1,8,2,5.0,10/3/2017,Great happy hour.  Great prices at happy hour.  Great food.  Great atmosphere.  I don't think I could afford this place normally.  I had the bacon wrapped hotdog and it was great.  Lazy dog is open till midnight.  It is lots of fun.  Call ahead and find out the hours.
Ellen G.,"Tustin, CA",0,2,,5.0,9/14/2017,Stephanie was Awesome!!!! She was an amazing server! She was sweet and kind and always had a smile! It's amazing that our bill was low but she still managed to take care of us so well! Thank you!  Thanks friend!!! Note: she always says friend!
Kate B.,"Irvine, CA",233,238,348,3.0,8/1/2016,"Thank you for the reply Howard (GM). We are back tonight: (Monday August 1st) and our server recommended the Barbacoa Chicken to my father this evening. I mentioned my experience last time to the waiter and he said this time should be better. We are anxious to try it again and intend to raise this review to a 5 star. Again, thank you for replying to me and I'll email you to let you know how it comes out this time.   Ok it came out kind of the same. Better but still could be improved.  I've attached pictures of the pizookie and how thin it is. It's not even an inch thick anymore. I remember when they filled the tin to the top. It's covered in ice cream, too much. I googled pictures from BJs website to show the drastic difference in the size of the cookie in the pizookie. Unfortunately, I don't feel any need to raise my review to 4 or 5 stars at this time.  (Previous Review) Bjs is a lot of fun. I like the style of the restaurant. It's spacious and has a cool industrial vibe. Inside is surprisingly quieter than the outdoor patio at this particular location. We almost ate outside to try to beat the wait and it echoed so badly out there that you couldn't hear yourself talk. It was filled with huge parties of almost 30 per party. Probably quieter on a less busy evening. We lucked out and the hostess just put us at the first open table inside that she saw. That was so nice.  We came in a few days ago and I ordered the quinoa with salmon. It was so good that I hyped my mom up on it and brought her back tonight. So I ordered her that and I decided to try the barbacoa chicken. It was served on a bed of brown rice with black beans, sprinkled feta, Greek yogurt creme sauce and cilantro. It came out looking like it had been under the heat lamp for about 5 minutes. The beans looked baked together and there wasn't enough Greek yogurt creme sauce so I requested more which made it a little better.  Thankfully my moms salmon lived up to my hype and she loved it.  We ordered the pizookie trio: blueberry lemon, salted caramel and chocolate chip for dessert. The ice cream overloaded the cookie a little too much for the miniature pizookies and made it real soggy. The pizookie cookies are a little on the thinner side. They would be awesome if they were as deep as bjs deep dish pizza. Service was a little slow tonight and food came out at different times but within 3 minutes of each other. but they were busy, that's understandable.  Salmon was a score. Pizzas are very good. I wouldn't order the barbacoa chicken again though unless it was a little better prepared."
Terry P.,"Irvine, CA",0,6,,5.0,11/23/2017,"My family and I been regulars here for 15 plus years.  We've had some good experiences and some not so great experiences.  A couple days ago we went back, after a couple month absence.  Our server, Andrea, was the most on the ball server we've ever had.  Rivaling many fine dining restaurants, the food was as good as ever.  I fully recommend this place."
Nathan L.,"Irvine, CA",37,1,1,1.0,4/5/2017,Worst take out service I've ever received. Ordered my large pizza at 6 pm and was told it would take 20-30 minutes. Sat and waited for another 30 minutes for my order and asked multiple times for an update and was ignored 3 times. Hostess then asked if there was a name change on the order AFTER she took my payment because she LOST my receipt with my name on it. Manager brought out my order after an hour and when I asked if he lost my pizza he said they were just running behind which was a lie because my pizza was cold. Got home and one slice of pizza wasn't even a BJ's favorite slice. Horrible customer service and communication. They never even apologized for the delay. Not sure how the pizza isn't even a full pizza but it's disgusting to think they threw old slices together in the kitchen. Loss of appetite.
Monica R.,"Santa Ana, CA",3,17,2,1.0,7/2/2017,"Had dinner last night and everything was horrible. I ordered a chicken tortilla soup, which is my favorite but last night was so disgusting. They loaded it up with disgusting chicken and to top it off it was cold! We ordered a medium pizza and was cold as well. We had to have our server warm it up and after she did it wasn't hot. I was over it by then already! I'm a regular here but it seems like their employees are not putting an effort on their food and that's sad. I won't be coming back to this location, maybe I'll give another location a try. Sad, sad, sad."
