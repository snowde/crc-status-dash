E D.,"Orange, CA",2,11,,1.0,12/27/2013,"If I didn't like the food so much I would never be back...the services is the worst I have ever had the last 3 times. First they offered me food that wasn't mine 3 separate times. I had to literally flag someone with my napkin to get the check. I asked for a refill, she filled the glass half up and never came back with more... food was good but the aggravation was not worth it... lazy dog here I come"
Charlene P.,"Irvine, CA",102,146,192,3.0,8/1/2009,"I've been here so many times for birthdays/get-togethers/award ceremonies/going-away-parties/end-of-the-year-parties/socials/ice-breakers... But, I still don't know what the ""BJ"" in ""BJ's"" stands for. And, no. Not that. Anyways, what makes BJ's such a popular place for eating and meeting and mingling? I'd say it's the atmosphere over the food. Lights are always dim (Yard-House-esque) giving off that sophisticated feel, there's a fairly good amount of room between tables, good accommodations for large groups/parties, there's a bar available (it is a brewery, isn't it?), and, let's face it, these restaurants are EVERYWHERE! So, convenience comes to mind when I think of this place. So that's a good plus. But, as for the food... The last time I came here I had: Chips and Salsa -- DO NOT order this appetizer. The salsa's just too soupy and the chips tasted stale and way too salty. Save your tortilla chip cravings for Albatros. Mini Vegetarian Pizza -- A-OK. Not spectacular. If you're looking for a good selection of their deep dish pizzas, don't get the vegetarian. Try the buffalo chicken; trust me, it's a lot more flavorful. But, I guess for what it is, the veggie pizza here does fulfill its purpose and isn't too bad. It's a bit pricey though ($10 for a mini). Pizookie -- Tons of vanilla ice cream smacked on top of warm cookies of your choice (macadmia nut, oatmeal raisin, chocolate chip, etc). I think it's pretty good the first bite, but if you eat too much, you'll fall into a food coma faster than when you ate the deep dish pizzas. The ice cream is kinda whack -- I don't think it's real. But, try it out for a cool treat, if not for the novelty of the idea. At least they give it free for your birthday (if you tell them it's your birthday)! I also had a few bites of other entrees/appetizers, but nothing here has yet to impress my taste buds besides maybe the Avocado Rolls and the Buffalo Chicken pizza. Definitely give those a try. I think that I'll never escape BJ's, just because it's so convenient. But if I had a choice, I'd save my $20. Oh, and service is all right. Pretty good at this location."
Kevin M.,"Costa Mesa, CA",36,111,73,3.0,4/6/2012,"VERY busy!!  Happy that our friends used the BJ's app to get our table before we even left home.  We walked in and only had to wait a minute or two to be seated.  There were others still waiting, so the app worked GREAT! Our waitress was friendly and professional.  We had an appropriate amount of time to chat amongst ourselves.  Beer was delivered briskly.  We split three small plates, Seared Ahi, Fried Artichoke hearts, and Stuffed Mushrooms.  All very good!  My wife and I split the the pasta dish and we still left a little. Solid performance for only our second visit.  Though good, I'm not sure I'd wait too long for dinner there."
Jackie K.,"Kansas City, MO",3,45,8,5.0,6/4/2012,"The only reason I am giving them a 5, instead of a 4, is because everytime they mess up my order (which is almost everytime), they make up for it by taking it off my bill, or giving me an extra of whichever they messed up. I usually visit this particular BJs when I crave their Pizookie. Ive rarely had bad service, and the food is always good. Well, the pizza is always good. I have strayed off the pizza trail a hand full of times and was dissappointed. I do not like their pastas, sandwiches, or burgers. I usually stick to a buffalo chicken pizza, ceasar salad, and pizookie. ALWAYS AMAZING! Their Lightswitch beer is also quite tasty."
Shanna C.,"Pasadena, CA",0,5,,1.0,9/13/2014,Horrible Service!!! The server didn't show up for 15 min after we had a table. And the District manager showed up and he was so rude... what's going on with these people? They are not ready for customers? He needs to learn what the basic service is..We will never come here again!!!
Melanie F.,"Irvine, CA",15,14,,1.0,7/27/2011,"Wow- I have finally reached my breaking point with BJ's in Irvine. If I could give it negative stars I would.  We have dined here several times, and also ordered take out. AND every single time (with the exception of one time) the orders have been messed up.  Our last time was this past Sunday night at 5:30pm. We were seated promptly with no wait. We brought a bottle of wine with us, since they now offer a no corkage fee on the first bottle. We were greeted pretty quickly, and when I asked for a wine chiller for my white wine she said she would be back in a minute with one. Well, 5 minutes went by and she came back and said they were preparing it at the bar. At that point my husband order a beer. So the server promptly got his beer. When we asked about the wine chiller she now said that they didn't have any since the Restaurant only carries 2 wine chillers. WHAT? She just said they were preparing it?? Plus, what restaurant only carries two wine chillers? Obviously this one!  So, at this point I just asked for a wine glass and some ice. She said she would be back with both. She never brought either, but instead came back 10 minutes later to take our appetizer order. At this point I had been sitting there for 20 minutes with no drink and a warm bottle of white wine. So I asked AGAIN for the wine glass and ice. She eventually brought the glass but not the ice. Really? Is this rocket science? I gave up on the ice.  Then to top it off 40 minutes later the manager approached our table to tell us the server forgot to put our order in.....What?? At this point I really just wanted to leave, but decided since we were with my in laws to sit it out. Needless to say I will not be eating here again. This is the reason why I avoid chains. They lack service. They offered us free desserts, but in reality I have no problem paying for my food. I just want good service and a freaking wine chiller.  In past take out experiences, they have left out the dipping sauce for my calamari, left our dressing for salads etc.   Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else like Bandera in CDM or Nicks in Laguna.  They offer fantastic service, the same prices as BJ's, no corkage and plenty of wine chillers."
Steven C.,"Santa Ana, CA",4,3,,1.0,3/19/2014,Rude waiter and asked for my burger with no pickle.. After telling my waiter he took it back to the kitchen and just removed the pickles from my burger.  The bums still have pickle juice on it and yellow/green stains so I knew they just took the pickles out.. Honestly I would expect this service from a mom and pop burger stand not Bj's.. For this reason I prefer Lazy Dog's food and customer service!! Cheaper for better quality too..
Michael T.,"Reseda, CA",6,3,,1.0,8/5/2014,"If it were possible to rate this restaurant 0 stars I would.  This was Absolutely, hands-down the worst service I or my five co-workers have ever encountered!  The server took our order twice, because she forgot. It looked like she was writing it down the second time, however, she mixed up individual orders, shrimp instead of chicken, the wrong kind of beer, and a forgotten beer for one guest. She forgot to place a food order for one guest all together which was delivered to the table after everyone else finished eating. She ignored multiple requests for drinks and water, then tried to make a joke and brought three waters to the one guest all at one time. This server took a desert order, forgot, again, and  asked if we wanted desert a second time describing the deserts, once morel until we reminded her that she had already taken the order. She then told us that she had just been crying in the back and described to us her personal issues she was dealing with as an excuse for poor service. This story even included a Murder!!...Really? All of this while she continued to admit her horrible service, laughing, uncomfortably. Another water was served in a dirty glass. The water tasted sweet, as if there were a drink previously served in the same glass... Yukkk!!.  At that point we asked for the manager who was less than apologetic. We started this evening asking for separate checks which also was forgotten by our server, who had to then take more time to separate our bills and comp our meals while we waited, when All we wanted to do was get the Hell out of there as fast as possible!!!!!"
Lucy R.,"Irvine, CA",0,1,,5.0,6/6/2015,Devin - Is an amazing person and server.  We appreciate her great personality. We come to BJs often with our family and we have had the pleasure of Devin's consistent pleasant service with a smile every time... She also knows how to cater to family's and that helps makes dining with kids a much better experience.  If you take care of any parents kids first and ensure their food comes out fast then the rest of the meal is good for the family.  Also a great positive attitude is not something everyone has - it's either you have it or you don't and Devin is a shining star that helps us to want to come back to BJs.  Thank you for great service !
Coby J.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",19,74,3,5.0,5/1/2012,Love this place everytime i come here i am satisfied. great food and service!
Meg R.,"Irvine, CA",409,558,322,4.0,1/5/2011,"I actually like BJs. for this style restaurant theyre probably my favorite, like, over dave and busters and yard house.  I think they have a great menu and im addicted to their balsamic chicken. mmmm its so good, prefectly cooked, juicy chicken with a sweet and tangy balsamic glaze, served with cheddar mashed potatoes and grilled onions as well as crispy onion strings.  Not to mention the pizookie, have you tried one?? theyre awesome - hot, fresh cookies, with ice cream on top.  parking can be a real pain in the ass here, but be persistent. Overall, good food. though i usually get it to go so no comment on the beer selection or interior."
Dan G.,"Irvine, CA",88,75,61,4.0,7/28/2012,"I looooove BJ's!!!  Hahaha!!!   Always great food at the BJ's locations I've been to, and they have a great Happy Hour! I've tried loads of different items on their menu, and I can't say that I ever found one that I didn't like. I'm not a big drinker, but they brew some pretty tasty beers. Two thumbs up from this guy! Keep up the good work."
C C.,"Tustin, CA",7,4,,3.0,4/18/2014,"BJ's is always great for a quick bite...well not so quick if you're going on a Friday night. Use the call ahead seating option. Food here is decent but can't say it's great. I do like their pizza even though it's not the traditional NY style that I grew up eating.....If you like watching sports while eating, this is the place."
Katie L.,"Irvine, CA",16,193,32,5.0,12/25/2011,"This is a great place for birthday celebration! Especially when you make reservation to do their buffet.  It's a great deal with tons of food.  (All you can eat pizza, pasta and salad plus drinks!)  I've been here for 2 family birthday celebration and I've been very happy both times.   Hubby and I were just here a few days ago for family birthday party.  Great service, great staff and kudos to the management!  They went above and beyond to make sure all our needs are taken care of.  That's rare when you have a big group of ppl.   Great food + Service = I will be back!!! Plus they have Raspberry Fromboise on tap! yum!!!"
Rachel W.,"Beverly Hills, CA",30,14,,2.0,6/12/2015,food is great beer is great but 2 nights ago I had the worst food poisoning from eating there ive ever gotten. not the best experience ever.
Tamara M.,"Orange County, CA",199,475,37,2.0,10/19/2011,"Hadn't been to BJ's in a while because last time I was not happy with the quality of my food. This time we ordered the big nachos to share and it was basically a pile of chips. There was hardly any cheese or chili, etc. For $10 bucks or whatever I expect some loaded up nachos. Pumpkin beer was decent."
Donna C.,"Irvine, CA",2,48,,4.0,5/31/2011,"Try their avacado eggrolls for an appetizer...I've been hooked ever since I first tasted it. Also, this place has really good Mediterranean pizza. It's very different from a traditional pizza, but it tastes delicious.  Strawberry margaritas aren't too bad here either. Fun place at happy hour, and for a night out with friends. They're open pretty late, I think they close at midnight. Some of their hosts/hostesses need to work on being a little more attentive when you walk through the door that late. I was standing around for at least five minutes before anyone bothered to seat me...Some of the waiters/waitresses were trying their best to ignore us for some reason. Maybe they were just lazy or tired?  Aside from that, this place has pretty good food, and the atmosphere has a modern edge to it. Very nice overall."
Paris N.,"Irvine, CA",1,26,14,1.0,9/21/2014,"After a long day of studying and since we didn't have any food at home, my husband and I decided to go to BJ's for a late dinner. We ordered our drinks and an appetizer (fried calamari), and our food. We waited almost 45 min before we called our waitress over to ask her why is it taking so long for our food. She said the kitchen messed up and she apologized and said  they are making our food. She brought another fried calamari.40 mins went by and no food. We called her over again and we asked her about our food, she said "" what food""....OMG I could not believe what I was hearing. I asked her if she was on drugs because this was unreal. We only ate our appetizer (the first one, but we didn't touch the second one she brought) and to make the matter worst, the manager came over very unprofessional, and all he had to say was ""I came over to offer you guys a gift card"". I could not believe what was going on. Not even an apology. We just left without taking the gift card, mad and hungry. I hate this place and I would never go back to any BJ's restaurant ever again. No wonder they only got 3 stars. Honestly they deserve only one star."
Tobi U.,"Santa Ana, CA",49,47,3,4.0,2/13/2014,We eat here a couple times a month. The service is always great. We never wait to long to get a table. We love the avocado eggrolls!! There the bomb!! Food is always great!!  Price is always fair. It can be really loud sometimes!!
Sany N.,"Chicago, IL",325,386,208,4.0,1/22/2013,"Came here to watch the NFC Championship game and it wasn't as packed as I thought it would be. There were plenty of seats and lots of TVs. It was happy hour so we took advantage of their chicken wings deal. Their chicken wings are pretty darn delicious. Their pazookies are always winners. I prefer the original over any other flavor but the raspberry one was pretty delicious as well. The service was quick at the bar, and the server was attentive. I really liked this BJ's over the one i've been to in north SD."
