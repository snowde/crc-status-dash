Kaung K.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",17,6,,4.0,6/25/2012,"So I got invited to BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse, Irvine to celebrate a friend's belated birthday.  (Yes, I have friends and yes, I get invited to parties!) Environment: What can you say, it's in Irvine and at the Irvine Market Place so it is a pretty busy neighborhood with many stores and restaurants nearby. Which is a good thing by the way. I mean you don't want to go to a restaurant that is at a quiet dark corner yonder, do you? I don't think so! You don't have to worry about parking space either because there is a huge lot. I cannot guarantee you will find a spot but since I went there at night around 10 PM, there were many open spaces. It might or might not be the same for peak hours or ""day hours"". Service:  The place is pretty packed even at that late hour! Both outside dining areas and inside are packed! I was just a ""visitor"" so the seat for us was already reserved (by walk in). I cannot really talk about the wait time to be seated (sorry!). But from what I've observed while waiting for my food to come, out of starvation but without hallucinations from hunger, I noticed new customers were seated fairly quickly. Even a large group of 10-13 got seated within at max 5 minutes. So, I guess not much of a wait time. (Again, keep in mind I'm talking about the late night hours). The waiters and waitresses are dressed in the BJ's nice uniforms; they all look formal more or less. I felt like eating at a high-class professional restaurant, except with some noises around from other tables. I mean what can I expect, right? Our orders were taken quickly and the waiter made sure we got everything we need by constantly checking up on us. Very nice staffs there! A waitress even helped put my leftover pizza I ordered larger size out of greed into a to-go box on my behalf! Thanks for that! Oh, the waiters (not sure about waitresses, and NO I am not checking out the guys - I don't swing that way) seem to have mood or Hawaiian or some sort of wrist bracelets. Maybe that's how they keep themselves all cheerful or how they cast yummy spells on the food they served! Who knows! It's a world full of wonders. Yup. Nobody said Thank You or Bye when I left though. I felt ignored. Somebody there owed me a hug! (Message me on here for preferences of the person who should give me a hug! Haha just kidding!) Food (Full Menu Here:  ): They have varieties of food and drinks. Here, I am just going to talk about what we ordered, especially me (no, not being conceited). You can check out their menu in the link I posted above though! Prices are aright for everyone and the food served can be shared too because it's a good size for a nice price! Wine & Beer: We ordered wine and beer. I don't know what kind because I don't drink much and I always let people order for me or jump into the easy bandwagon while ordering by saying ""Same as her/him"". But wine we ordered was pretty good and satisfying, so were the beer few others ordered. Pizza: or PIZZA!!! I ordered their new Gourmet Five Meats (Housemade meatballs, pepperoni, oven roasted ham, salami, Italian sausage and a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese.) pizza small size. Trust me, small is still big considering they have ""mini"" size below it! It came with about 5-6 slices; you can actually check how many slices each size is composed of on their menu, so you can have a good estimate. (Menu in the restaurant for sure, not sure about the online one). It was delicious!!! You can taste the mixture of everything. You know, sometimes the taste of meat and toppings did not sink into the crust/bread so it's like eating them separately. But BJ's pizza, mmmm mmmm!! Oh I think you can special order birthday cakes and have celebration too. Check with BJ's if you do need one! Noise: Just the usual noise you always hear at the restaurants with bars attached. But it is nowhere half as loud as Yard House though!!! (Or Dave & Buster's)!!! I'd say that's good. - Ko (Tweeper @KaungKo on Twitter)"
Frances J.,"Berlin, Germany",2,57,,1.0,1/28/2013,"If you are reading this review and contemplating whether or not this BJ's is worth your time, let this review be the one to convince you not to waste your time. If you can find another restaurant, (which there are alot of in the surrounding area) please do so. If you are dying for BJ's, please go the extra mile and do not give this BJ's in Irvine your service.  I am not giving a poor review on BJ's because of their food, but on their service. BJ's in Irvine HAS TERRIBLE SERVICE. DO NOT GO HERE.Our waitress BRANDY was obviously having a terrible day and was not paying attention to our table at all and was throwing back all types of attitude during our entire stay. Never in all of our lives has a waitress thrown her finger at us to tell us to wait (really?). WE ARE NOT DOGS. WE ARE NOT CHILDREN. WE ARE CUSTOMERS, PLEASE HAVE SOME RESPECT. That immediately was an EARLY indication that the service here was poor. For the rest of our time here, she didn't look us in the eye when speaking and again, was throwing all types of attitude. REGARDLESS of the terrible service, my companions & I remained calm and cordial. She gave us the check and forgot the pizooki (really?) and we waited another 20+ minutes to order, get the check revised, and get dessert. Way before the dessert reached our table, my mood had already gotten sour.  We wanted to complain. All of my companions and I have worked in the food industry and have NEVER been treated like that nor have ever treated any of our customers like that in our life.A second waitress came, she was not too much of an improvement from Brandy. We asked for her name, and she just did not want to give it to us (really?). As we told her the situation from the previous waitress, it was so obvious that she was DESPERATE for us not to speak with the manager.  Regardless, we are calling management soon to let them know of the situation in hopes that another group of people just trying to eat a meal does not have to suffer the same crappy service we did.  I had higher expectations for this establishment and it let me down. BJ's in Irvine was a definite dissapointment. All I was trying to do was have a decent meal with companions in a chain I was familiar with. As I said earlier, if you are wanting BJ's badly, make the effort to eat at another BJ's...otherwise pick another restaurant in the surrounding area."
Mark R.,"Tustin, CA",0,85,5,2.0,10/25/2014,"Most BJs are ""okay"".  This one seems to be particularly busy, so you'd think they'd be prepared for that, but they are not.  The quality suffers.  The service is really not that good.  For To Go orders, the wait is LONG.  I've also ordered from this BJs via delivery services.  The delivery service typically gets a bad rap for the slow delivery - but, in the case of BJs Irvine, it is all BJs fault.  So, dine elsewhere, or order elsewhere, at least until this BJs gets their act together and improves service.  PLENTY of other (and better) choices."
Christina F.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,24,3,2.0,8/31/2014,"I gave this location 2 stars only because I am a regular and 7 out of 10 times I have no issues with the food/service. It's definitely hit or miss and not always consistent. However, tonight I was extremely disappointed. I placed a pick up order at 12am at this location on a Saturday night. The man who took my order seemed winded but still very friendly considering the time of night. I usually try and avoid ordering from places shortly before they close but tonight I got off work late and I was exhausted, suffering from sciatica and not in the mood to cook. I work in food service so I mostly understand what goes through the kitchen staffs mind when they see an order placed an hour before closing which is why I kept it simple. Mini deep dish cheese and tomato only. My usual. My boyfriend picked it up for me and when I opened the box, there was a black film under the cheese that was caked onto the top of the pizza bread. This has happened before and always late night. I had previously assumed it was just burnt cheese but considering this only happens late night, I was irritated. All I wanted was my pizza. I was starving so I still ate it but I had to peel back the cheese and peel off the film. I get it, it's late and the staff wants to get all their pre-closing done but come on! If this film on my pizza is a result of just wanting to get out on time I'm really disappointed in the way management runs the kitchen. I still love their food but I'm probably going to find myself a different late night eatery."
Nick D.,"Anaheim, CA",10,4,4,4.0,6/7/2011,Its a cross between a loud sportsbar and cheesecake factory...The menu is extensive (like cheescake fac.) but you'll be lucky if you can hear yourself talking on a game night. Food is good esp. the pizza. Best beer is Jeremiah Red. Only negative is the wait..always 45 mins on fri or sat nite.
Danny Y.,"Irvine, CA",307,42,1,4.0,7/11/2011,"Great Pizza, Great Root Beer and Great Pizookies!   Perpetually crowded, BJs is one of those places that my wife and I will always crave on a regular basis.  This location surrounded by thousands of residential units give it a built in regular customer base.   I can highly recommend their pizzas which are made with tastey crusts and grilled tomatoes.  I always get garlic with any pizza to enhance the flavor and I am always happy with the quality of their pizzas. I also always order their hand crafted root beers, which they serve in a chilled mug, just like they would a cold beer. Finally, there are few better ways to end a meal than with a warm cookie topped with ice cream.  The warm sweetness of the cookie go so well with the cold creaminess of the ice cream that I wonder why more restaurants don't copy this dessert. Always reliable, great food and great place to catch the game."
Javier J.,"Los Angeles, CA",1656,1996,248,3.0,10/19/2010,"Oh BJ's, the name of the place that you'll have to snicker and giggle about suggesting some BJ's for dinner only to have your significant other roll their eyes because you've made this joke ten too many times before.  I have a love/hate relationship with Chicago style pizza. I hate it because you really can't call it pizza. Not in the same respect you call a flat style pizza pizza. Chicago style pizza is a sort of lasagna with pizza toppings and dough. You even have to cook it differently, so why still call it a pizza?   Why yes, I would like to order a Chicago style pizza. Please serve me a trough of round bread with a bunch of shit in it. Can you make it really fucking slimy and awful? Thanks in advance, Chicago. You're the greatest.  Chicago style pizza is the second most corrupt thing to ever come out of that city. Want proof? Well how about trying what we had this night at this fine Chicago style pizza establishment in the form of a Bacon Cheeseburger Pizza.  Yeah, you heard that right.. we tried the Bacon Cheeseburger Pizza. Yeah, I'm confused by this decision. I mean.. it's for people who can't make up their mind on if they want a burger or a pizza.. and it's Chicago style so add in that you can't make up your mind on if you want a Lasagna either.  The burger was disturbing in the taste. I didn't get much bacon out of the flavor, so that was one misrepresentation right there. You can taste the ground beef and the pickles and cheese the most. Which I'm not sure is the greatest thing to want to taste on a pizza.  Service was pretty average and considering the large party we had, it was pretty attentive all things considered.  The beer is tasty and well, that cuts across all the BJ's board. When you consider that they aren't a bud or miller sort of company, the fact that they are making such good quality beer is a note worthy item.  Over all, it's probably the location most ""date nights"" end up for the folks who live in this suburban sprawl area and considering the alternatives to choose from in chains, it's one of the better choices.. even if the pizza is a pile of grossness."
Candace C.,"San Francisco, CA",141,147,49,5.0,6/22/2011,"I love going here when there is a game on.  I went during the NBA Finals Game 5 and everyone was getting really into it!! (But it's most likely cuz it was a really good game)  I always get the Buffalo Chicken Pizza.  I love that it has a little kick.  The angel hair pasta is my second fav.  I had Daniel as a server :) and he's always workin' hard, lookin' cute. haha.  Oh yeah, I always use their call ahead.  That way I can still get an estimate as to how much longer I can lag to get ready and some stuff done, while I'm ""in line"" All I have to say about their Red Velvet Pizookie is that I wish it were socially acceptable to be draped in velvet. Also, they have this REALLY TRIPPY 3-D TV thing while you wait.  It's really weird/AWESOME."
Sofie Z.,"Burnaby, Canada",20,25,99,3.0,10/31/2013,"This chain pizza joint is an ok rendition to the Chicago deep dish. When you've tried authentic Lou Malnatis in Chicago, this one will have to do in SoCal. The options are great and the servings here are pretty big. We ordered a mini to share with meatballs mushrooms and green peppers. They definitely loaded the pizza with meatballs. I like how their ""build your own"" come with fresh marinated tomatoes, If you like tomatoes this definitely adds that juicy bite to the pizza. I do have to say that our mini was more bready and airy than a deep dish should be, but it was less oily which was a plus. We also orders the nachos that came with no shortage of cheese and a surprise hot beans sauce on the bottom which was a nice compliment. To end, a gluten free pazookie was ordered. It came warm with two scoops of vanilla ice cream. The first few bites were nice but once the ice cream starts melting you realize the cookie is way too sweet. This dessert is what BJs is known for, I'm glad there's a gluten free version but toning down the sugar in the cookie recipe would have been better"
Bailey L.,"Irvine, CA",0,9,4,5.0,2/1/2014,Ok... Been here 25 plus times and the quality is always superb from there pizzas to their Cesar salad and ofcourse their piezo okie
Michael C.,"Irvine, CA",111,40,40,2.0,4/4/2013,"Loud, slow service. Slow to seat, had to wait while others passed us up. Food is decent but the service really is subpar. Waiter spilled water all over table and didn't clean it up."
Jim B.,"Orange, CA",0,4,,1.0,4/4/2015,Went there (Irvine) for dinner and asked for their creamy garlic salad dressing. Got some lame excuse why they do not have it anymore. The waitress needed to stop talking at that time. So we settled for a different dressing. Then we asked for her to bring some rolls with the salads before the Pizza. Then she said no rolls. We left the restaurant.
Georgia B.,"Orange, CA",76,127,37,4.0,9/10/2013,"Came on a busy night for happy hour. Average service, once we seated ourselves at the bar it took around 5 minutes for someone to come around and notice us. Nonetheless, BJ's has a pretty good happy hour! I love their Lemon Drop martini and their Strawberry Mojito. They also have call drinks and beer for $4 (recommend their Oktoberfest), Cosmopolitans and other martinis/mojitos for $5, and wines for $6. Some appetizers like flatbreads and sliders. Also, if you have never had a Pizookie you are a sad sad individual because a FRESH BAKED COOKIE A LA MODE sounds delicious (and fattening) to me! They also have a gluten free option if that's your thing."
T P.,"Orange County, CA",1,510,190,5.0,1/22/2015,"My husband and I come here once every 2-3 weeks.  We have a great time here.  We prefer to sit in the bar because it's more casual.  The service in the bar area is always positive.  The servers are super attentive, friendly and they hustle.  Our most recent trip was this past Sunday when we watched the Seahawks come back to beat the Packers.  What an amazing game, huh? We ordered the spicy buffalo wings to start - awesome!  Definitely recommend!!!! The drinks we had: bloody mary's, margarita's, strawberry mojitos . . . all delicious and fresh.  I had the California Club flat bread and my husband had a chicken burger which he devoured.  Both were amazing! BJ's is consistent: their employees are friendly, their food is always tasty and spot on, the drinks are perfectly made and the prices are great.  Obviously, I recommend and will return.  Great place to watch sports because there are many tv's, the noise level is perfect and the people are professional and you don't have to worry about a bar fight breaking out (okay, maybe over who gets the last chicken wing). Their happy hour is valid when games come on - great savings and many choices!"
L C.,"Irvine, CA",10,9,4,2.0,6/7/2013,"I like BJ's Pizza for well...their pizza....I just LOVE pizza!!!! This location is very popular so it's kinda odd they made the place so small. The food is really good but I'll never forget, I went here for my birthday and since we had leftover pizza we asked for a box. Well the server INSISTED she box it for us and all but two slices fell on the floor. She apologized and brought the check. UM??? No comp no ""well make you another one"" no...on my birthday I walked out of that place with two slices instead of 6!!!   Breaks my heart anytime I think of it!"
Jordan D.,"Irvine, CA",641,171,154,4.0,3/2/2011,"what can you really say about chain places like these?  You know the foods going to be good or else they wouldn't be a national chain so here is my attempt at this. I come here pretty frequently, but never been here for happy hour, but all I hear are really good things.  During Fridays and the weekend you should try and call in because the place is extremely packed, with wait times going from 15 minutes to about an hour depending on your group size.  Good thing is, is that you can go to the bar and watch some sports and drink there while you wait.  Don't want to wait? well you can even eat at the bar if you want to.  Food and alcohol...can't go wrong. This place is known for their pizzas and their delicious pizookies (sp?).  I love the BBQ chicken pizza and their chicken fettuchini alfredo.  The pizza is perfectly made and the chicken not dry at all in both meals.  I love taking the bread they serve and dipping it in the alfredo sauce.  The sauce was rich and creamy but not too creamy.  Id recommend both meals for anyone.  O and you cant have a meal there without getting a pizooki, ice cream scoops on top of a freshly baked mega cookie.  This may be the greatest thing on the menu there.  Cookie is baked to perfection and the entire meal just melts in your mouth when you take a big bite.  SUPER DELICIOUS.  The beers are really good as well.  I personally like the jeremiah red and the tatonka which is very strong and rich, not recommended for people who enjoy drinking bud light or coors when other beer is available.  But for the most part their house beers are all pretty good. Everything is pretty pricey during regular meal hours, but i mean you are getting what you paid for.  The service here is pretty solid and most of them are extremely nice and talkative, making sure your meal is wonderful, except for one time the waiter must have been having a horrible day because he couldn't help making us think that throughout our meal. Other than all that i'm sure I'll be coming back here again in the near future. GO EAT IT!!!   .xxxx.                          |(o)(o)|   (  (__)  )     | (  ) |      NOM NOM NOM!!!    \__/ Jordan"
Joe R.,"Santa Ana, CA",2,55,106,5.0,12/7/2013,I gave them one more chance I tried their pizza and ahi salad it was great. Also the beer was good. They probably had a bad cook the last time I was there. Enjoy the ahi salad it's great
Nazeli S.,"Glendale, CA",43,120,4,5.0,1/1/2013,"BJ's is always good, but this location is my favorite!  They really pile up their salads which is great because the Glendale location really skimps out ingredients so you can definitely see a difference.  As always their pazookie is yummy and the service was great!"
Todd G.,"Orange County, CA",81,22,7,4.0,4/17/2013,"I really like this place and am a member of their rewards program. I have had quite a few things off their menu and have never had a bad meal. Their rib eye steak was really good and their pizza flat bread is good too. Their signature pizza is deep dish but it is really tasty. They also have hand tossed but I have never ordered it. In my opinion their beer is only average and I have tried all of it. So I just order Stone's IPA, which they have on tap. You may like their beer but I'm a bit of a beer snob. The best dish on the menu is the by far the Jambalaya. Remember to order it half spicy unless you want your mouth on fire. I love spicy food and never order something half spicy but their Jambalaya is WAY TOO HOT. Order it half spicy and it is the best Jambalaya in Orange County. Whenever I go to a restaurant I always order Jambalaya if it is on the menu. So I have had it at half a dozen places and theirs is the best. Chaparosa Grill in the District in Tustin used to be the best but they closed. BJs has fair prices and you won't leave hungry. You probably won't need dessert but if you can eat it the Pazookie is great! The service has almost always been fantastic. The only knock on the place is that there is always a long wait unless you call ahead or come in at off times."
Eddie Y.,"Irvine, CA",11,10,,1.0,3/24/2013,"I've never had a problem at any other bj's location but this one seems to disappoint without fail. Long wait times to put in orders, long wait times for food, attitude when you kindly ask them to.change the channel on tv , problems with splitting checks every single time. This is THE WORST managed bjs of any location."
