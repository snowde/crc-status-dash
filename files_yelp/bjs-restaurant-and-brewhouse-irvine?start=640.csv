Kirt F.,"Pflugerville, TX",121,22,3,3.0,10/18/2011,"Good food, good service.  Their Flat bread Pizza appetizer (Basil and Italian Sausage) was EPIC!!!  Their main courses were decent enough.  Although my wife had a chicken type dinner with rice pilaf and the rice looked and tasted incredibly similar to Rice-a-Roni.  Really off putting for her.  The highlight were the drinks, my wife and our guest had a selection of seasonal beers and my son and I had their Cream Soda  Soft velvety smooth delivery that finishes with a slight hint of butterscotch goodness. All in all, not too bad.  Not sure we will make a trip to Irvine again for this place, but if we do, I will order two Flat Bread Pizzas for dinner accompanied by a frosty Cream Soda, served in a frosted mug.  =)"
M F.,"Irvine, CA",0,48,6,4.0,3/11/2012,"Holy crap, does this place have everything or what? Great food, good beer and....TV screens!!! AAAHHHHhhhhhh! Ordered a pizza, the clam chowder and the *warm* avocado egg rolls as an appetizer. Surprisingly good. Have gone several times. Service is good."
Jeri A.,"Gardena, CA",59,20,20,3.0,9/1/2013,Went for lunch yesterday...we usually love the caesar salad but this time there was barely any dressing on it so we asked for a side of dressing.  Then the pizza was ok just needed a little more sauce...and just a suggestion to use regular lemonade and not pink lemonade in the Arnold Palmer drink.   Just a suggestion.   But still all in all ok.  They have great deals!
Alex G.,"Santa Ana, CA",75,51,30,4.0,11/6/2013,food was great. I really recommend the spicy maranara
Lily T.,"Los Angeles, CA",969,528,2780,4.0,6/21/2011,"I don't know about other BJ's, but this one has great service! I've been here multiple times and every trip has been pretty consistent.  I came here the other day with a couple of co-workers for lunch and the wait wasn't bad at all. They have decent lunch menu, which is less pricier than their regular menu. I had the chicken parmigiana and their chocolate chip pazookie. Chicken pamigiana was good and a good portion, not too heavy if you don't plan on finishing the whole thing right before you go back to work.  The pazookie is always delicious and just the right amount of cookie and ice cream! :) Our waitress was very attentive and always refilled our drinks and even gave my co-worker a second order for free because she made a super minor mistake on her original order.  We all left happy and full :) Oh, and their happy hour is not bad either. Starts at 10 pm, $5 mini pizzas! Yumm :)"
Crystal N.,"Los Angeles, CA",667,177,277,3.0,7/19/2010,"Never thought I would have to begin a review with a memory like this one but I cannot believe how my night here at BJ's ended and trust me, you would have never guessed it. I ended my night here helping a 6-year old little girl with a bleeding nose in the restroom. I couldn't find her parents and she refused to leave the restroom to find them with me. There's a time when it's good to be Miss Independent but not when you're 6-years-old AND with a bleeding nose, babygirl!  Anyway, so that was the bloody highlight of my night. Other than that, the food was just mediocre and of course, overpriced just like the many other American chained restaurants.  We started off with a flatbread pizza. The fresh basil with italian sausage sounded amazing but it was the biggest let down ever. I was able to count only 10 little booger sized ""sausages""  with watery tomatoes toppled on the ""flatbread"" with a pathetic amount of cheese. What saved the flatbread pizza was their Crispy Calamari. It went perfectly with the pitcher of beer the waiter recommended to us.  Onto main course: the Southwestern Deep Dish Pizza. It was supposedly one of BJ's favorites. To me, it did not taste anything special. The chicken was too dry and I could barely taste anything but random bursts of spice that wasn't too impressive. The whole time i was munching, i was craving for a BBQ Chicken Pizza from CPK! Then came the mouth watering dish titled Chardonnay Shrimp Pasta. Eh? The waiter claimed that was his favorite dish. Umm, does BJ's pay waiters commission now? I did not taste anything in the pasta but was quite impressed by how plumped, juicy and fresh looking frozen shrimps could be. I left stuffed however. 200% carboOVERload. If only I was signed up to run a marathon the next day, I'd feel slightly better. Overall, I have to give props to the waiter. He was quite attentive and quick with what we needed. Before I left, I went to check up on the little girl. She was still there pinching her nose. You go girl, handle that nose like the independent woman you already are at age 6. BJ needs to give that girl a complimentary pizooki!"
Liz H.,"Irvine, CA",15,167,22,5.0,6/15/2011,"BJs has been a favorite for a long time for me. I've never had bad service, the food is always delicious, and it's a great place to meet up with some friends and enjoy a meal and a couple of beers. Everyone raves about the pizooki, and rightfully so - it's just that damn good. The last time I went I had a balsamic chicken dish on top of fresh arugula - absolutely delicious. My friend had a seafood dish (I'm not sure which one) and enjoyed it. Our waiter was friendly and attentive.  I was going to take one star off because I don't actually think their beer selection is that fantastic, which is disappointing. I've tried all of them and found them rather boring. But their mixed drinks are always strong and well mixed, so that redeemed the star.  If you go, ask to sit in Bill's section. You won't be disappointed."
Rebecca P.,"Anaheim, CA",86,67,,5.0,4/4/2011,First time at this location and it's my FAVE!  Not going to lie it's pretty loud!! but the employees are friendly.... except the 2 girls at the front!! :/ But other than that it was a good experience.... FOOD is DELICIOUS!! I had the Veggie Burger (it's a BIG portion) which could be good or bad!! in this case I ate half and half to go! Yum
Amanda Y.,"Irvine, CA",87,25,10,5.0,8/3/2013,"Good pizza, awesome pizookie! Fun atmosphere. Stopped in recently for lunch and it was super affordable and yummy!"
Spaz B.,"Irvine, CA",93,16,,2.0,5/30/2014,"I came here for dinner on a Friday night. I placed my order and fifteen minutes later my waitress went on break having never put my order in. A half hour or so later, the waitress who took over our section asked if we needed anything else or if we wanted the check. I let her know that we still hasn't received our meal. She was very apologetic and told us that she would put the order in to the kitchen for us and let management know. The manager passed through our section several times without saying anything to me about my meal until I finally flagged him down to let him know I was very dissatisfied with my experience and the wait. The manager said he had already made sure the kitchen was on top of our order, however after waiting for an hour to get our food they didn't comp or discount anything on my bill. Not even the drinks. I am a manager in food service and I would never let a guest of mine leave with an experience as sour as this without at least offering to comp something. Honestly this was terrible customer service on behalf of an otherwise great restaurant."
Anthony G.,"Irvine, CA",8,12,1,3.0,1/12/2014,"I went there for my girlfriends birthday with a party of 10. Made reservations in the morning, but when we got there the hostess said we would still have to wait 1.5 hours to be seated. However, when we talked to the manager about it she was nice enough to seat us right away. The server was very nice, but our order never made it back to the kitchen for some reason. The chef ended up coming out and personally apologizing saying we could have free salad and appetizers while we wait for our food. They also made up for it by giving us a free pizookie platter for dessert. The food was great, the server and hostess should not have made those mistakes but the manager and chef recovered nicely."
Christi P.,"Tustin, CA",3,54,16,1.0,1/2/2013,"Seriously...disgusting.  I think it's just this BJ's location. Been here over 6 times and keep giving it another go, but I think I will not be coming back.  Service is slow, and once the hostess was playing with a packet of bubble wrap the entire time we were waiting- right in front of our face! Once the appetizer came out after the entree, and the shrimp tasted like it was over a month old! Then the pizza came out and it was ice cold.  Just...disgusting.  Do yourself a favor and go to the one in Huntington Beach.  Management, wake up!"
Angel Q.,"Irvine, CA",7,342,70,2.0,8/10/2011,"First time been here and my experience was mediocre.   I am easy going and generally don't get too picky about restaurants.   Well the waitress who served my table had a little attitude problem.  Since i showed up late, I heard someone at my table said something and the waitress hardly came back.  She walked around and talked to other customers but avoided our table.   Doesn't matter if your customers offended you by what they said, you still need to be professional about it.   When you choose to be a waitress, you choose to take crap from your customers and thats just part of going into customer service fields.   If your pride gets in the way of doing your job, then being a waitress is not what you should be doing.   Waitress/servers is the one person who you have the most encounter at the restaurants and is representing the restaurants' image.  What these waitresses do can make or break the view of a customers view of the restaurants.   Really?  I am surprise to shock you little waitress with this new revelation.  I hope you learn from my honest review and take a little attitude check before you annoy more customers.    Over all, i love BJ food even though i think its pricey.  I probably would go to another location more often than this location though.   This is my 2 cents."
Shelly J.,"Los Angeles, CA",680,398,105,4.0,7/2/2010,"Chicken wingsssss!! is so good. Best chicken wings. Pizza, pasta, all good.  I have my reservations about their sandwiches =P Finish off the meal with THE Pizookie. OMG *Love"
David B.,"Lihue, HI",10,72,663,1.0,8/31/2013,"Why do I even try to go to this overpriced poseur of a restaurant? They don't take reservations, the wait is always longer than promised, the staff tries to upsell everything, the TVs are all on different channels, and the food is mediocre. This is definitely my last trip"
Lanna K.,"Irvine, CA",43,197,24,4.0,5/19/2011,"VL and I have a mini obsession with BJ's.  I even crave their house salad once in a while which is really odd but I can explain.  Their lettuce is always really cold and crisp and their ranch is one of the better ones I've had!  I also really like their chicken wings and avocado egg rolls and spaghetti with spicy tomato sauce and.... ok I'll stop.  But really, their pizzas?  Love them!  VL and I usually like thin crust but we make an exception for BJ's.  The crust is the best part because it's crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside.  The only thing the bar is good for are their beers.  Jeremiah Red is my favorite and I always make a point to try their seasonals. The only down side to this place is that there is always a ridiculous wait which is fine because I prefer to sit at the bar area anyways but they just recently made their bar tables TINY.  Ugh.  Also, their service is spotty.  Their servers are not exactly cream of the crop.  They have rude ones, snobby ones, clueless ones.  You name it.  Anyways, for that, I almost gave BJ's 3 stars but I'll give them a break.  Yay chains!  ...."
Lea T.,"San Francisco, CA",24,214,24,2.0,11/18/2012,"I often travel to this area for business, so decided to give BJ's a shot.  I went once and sat at the bar and ordered an appetizer and a couple of drinks.  The food was exactly what I expected - good, but nothing to write home about.  Service was a little dicey.  I had a hard time getting the bartender to notice me when I needed something, but other than that, it was an okay experience. The second time I went back, I went with a business partner and we sat in the restaurant.  We went early, so were seated immediately and I must say, I really like the relaxed atmosphere.  The lighting is really nice and it feels like a great place for a conversation.  I didn't notice this before, but they have the calories of everything listed on the menu.  I found this really depressing as everything worth ordering was chock full of calories.  I ended up ordering something that seemed reasonable calorie-wise, but I have to say I felt like it was not even worth going out once I saw how fattening all the food was and what my reasonable options were.  Anyway, waitress was nice enough but our food was not prepared as requested.  Some will say this is NOT the waitress' fault, but it is her job to check the food before bringing it out (I used to be a waitress) and she clearly did not as it was obvious the food was wrong.  My friend sent back his meal, but I kept mine as it was not that wrong and the kitchen was relatively slow in correcting their mistake.  There was the awkwardness choice of me eating my food while it was hot and then having to sit there with no food while he got his or just waiting for his food to come.  I chose to eat unnaturally slow so that I would have something left on my plate by the time his food came.  And then to be nice, I shared some of small meal with him so he could eat too.  When his food came, he offered to share, but I didn't like what he ordered, so I ended-up with half a meal that night. I was shocked that the waitress made no attempt to compensate us for the problem with our food.  I was expecting a free desert or something given how long it took for them to correct the problem."
Robin W.,"Orange County, CA",382,713,318,4.0,4/2/2011,"This place is always crowded so avoid it at peak times. Stick to the pizza -- it is deep dish and delish. All other menu items are forgettable. But really, all I want to talk about is the Pizookie.  Dessert heaven in a skillet.  Hot, fresh, melty cookie in a pan topped with ice cream. Your choice of cookie flavor. I could easily skip all other food choices and just go with the cookie nirvana that is the Pizookie."
Ashley G.,"Irvine, CA",4,16,4,5.0,6/11/2013,"Cannot say enough GREAT things about this place! Even when slammed pack the food is still prepared delicious. There deep dish pizza's, avocado rolls, actually the ""best beginnings"" sampler is the way to go! Its all amazing, then we ordered the pizookie trio with red velvet, chocolate chunk and white chocolate raspberry macadamia nut. OMG it was heaven in my mouth. The waiter also brought out a peanut butter pizookie ON THE HOUSE because the kitchen accidentally made an extra one. I thought that was awesome of the waiter. Most definitely will be coming back!"
Akta A.,"Orange County, CA",8,36,1,4.0,11/24/2010,"I am a fan of their deep dish pizza. My favorite is the Mediterranean pizza and I replace chicken with some vegetable. I like the other vegetarian options as well. For starters, I recommend their Bruschetta, Artichoke Spinach dip & Mozarella sticks.  I really like the pizookie. It is a must have when you go to BJ's."
