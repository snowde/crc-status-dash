Dee I.,"Westminster, CA",126,271,212,4.0,4/9/2013,"I came here for a pre-game snack with a friend.  This was my first visit and I have to say, it was really good.  I don't normally drink beer - I think the last time I did was 20 years ago in college doing quarters - but thought the occasion called for it.  Had no clue what to order, but the waiter was very helpful and suggested the blonde(?) for this newbie.  It was actually pretty decent...and matched up perfectly with the calamari, the happy hour wings and deep dish pepperoni pizza we ordered.  I'm normally very picky about my calamari.  I want it quickly fried to give it that crispy bite, but not long to cause you to feel as if you're chewing on an old tire.  And that's exactly how it was served.  Crispy on the outside, and perfectly cooked inside.  The sauces, a marinara and a tartar type sauce was fabulous.  If I wasn't in public viewing I'dve picked up those tiny little containers and emptied it out into my gaping maw of a mouth.  Yeah, that delicious to me.  The wings, I guess happy hour style means, just fried...but I liked that.  Often times they drench the wings in sauce, and I prefer the lighter hand when it comes to sauce.  I didn't try the deep dish pizza, that was all his, but he seemed happy with. They've got a pretty good selection of food and although I'm not into big chain restaurants, this served it's purpose and I'll be back.  Those lettuce wraps looked tasty..."
Lauren H.,"Irvine, CA",57,32,23,4.0,6/3/2011,"This place has great food that will accommodate everyone in your party. The main food you MUST get here are the pizookies. Other places can't quite make their pizookies as delicious. They have a wide variety of different types of cookies that you can choose from. In terms of actual food, I would recommend the gourmet pizzas here! All of the other food here is decent, so you can't really make a bad choice. This place has a great atmosphere with very helpful waiters and bar area up front filled with television screens for sports. It is great for parties and hanging with friends, but if you are looking for an intimate place, this is not the one."
Denny B.,"La Mirada, CA",29,102,5,4.0,11/7/2012,"I only get the ribeye steak here.  Its nothing special, but pretty good.  Everytime I order, the steak comes out how I want it."
Syndie P.,"Colorado Springs, CO",101,21,12,4.0,6/1/2011,"Best place for gourmet pizza! I have been to this particular BJ's over a dozen of time's and I even had my baby shower at this location. What I find so neat is that they actually train their employees here and I have yet to get someone that hasn't been awesome. Happy hour is great here too if you don't mind sitting in the bar area and having appetizers. I was at this location once, sitting in the bar area, and this lady was with her husband. She obviously was mad at him for some reason and was hitting him every once in while, she even threw her drink on him once. She had way to much to drink at some point during that day, so the manager came over to try and handle the situation. At this point, the lady was out of control, yelling at everyone and demanding more drinks. So long story short, the manager sat with her and talked to her just to calm her down and he had also called a taxi for her since her husband had left her there. I thought the manager did an outstanding job as far has how he handled the situation. Bonus points there! Why do I always wait to talk about the food last? It's always the best part, right?! Their appetizers are all very good, try to check out one ever time you visit. Their specialty pizzas are the best though, the mediterranean one is my favorite by far. The more bizarre they seem, the better they taste so don't be afraid to branch out. They have a nice variety of food if you don't feel like pizza, so it's really a great place for everyone. I know by the end you are probably stuffed and will be getting a to go box, but you absolutely must try their pazooki for dessert. Those that are beer drinkers, the Jeremiah Red is delicious. They have a ton of beers and specialty drinks, so check them out! They also have a ton of tvs and are always playing the current sport events. Check this place out! I have only her great things from all of their locations."
Gina S.,"Orange, CA",4,7,,5.0,12/21/2010,"This really isn't ""just pizza"" it's more like, kiss-your-baby-daddy-all-night-long- pizza!  Oh, you have to eat it to believe it!  It's super thick, deep dish pizza with something secretly special in the crust.... I call it ""crack crust"" cuz you WILL become addicted.  You keep coming back for more and simply can't get enough!  The toppings are always really fresh.  I go with tomato and mushrooms.  I also get a side of pepperoncinis!  If they are cooked on the pizza, they become really spicy.   My husband gets the shrimp tacos, he says they are fab (he also has a slice or two of my pizza, of course). I wouldn't recommend getting the mini.  It's too small for the ""deep dish effect.""  The toppings sort of fall to the middle.  Nah, I get a small or a medium so I can have plenty to take home and eat the next day.  It's wicked tasty warmed up in the microwave.    And the absolute best part, you can call your name in when you leave the house....when you get there, you will be seated immediately!  I love the dirty looks I get from the waiting customers.  Booyah!  It goes a little something like this:  ""Hey! ....What?...Are you kidding me?...We were here first!""  Or my personal favorite, both arms straight out, palms facing up, ""What the hell?!...How did they...?"""
Dave L.,"Irvine, CA",529,100,62,4.0,11/13/2010,"The decor is open and resembles the inside of a brewery + sports bar but clean and sophisticated.  It you go on a weekend night, you'll have to wait up to an hour. The menu is extensive with lots of choices including healthier items like salads and lettuce wraps.  We go to BJ's once a week and usually split a salad and a pizza. This is the most economical way to go. The salads are more finely chopped with all the ingredients included.  The pizza is deep dish Chicago style with lots of toppings to choose from. My son loves the French Dip sandwich. A huge plus with BJs is their special deserts. The bazookie desert is what they are famous for. It's giant chocolate cookie baked in a flat pan with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top. It comes to your table hot from the oven and you eat them with a spoon. Yum.  Overall, it's a fun and dependable place to have a nice meal. Enjoy."
C T.,"Santa Ana, CA",3,18,,2.0,11/3/2012,"Ugh, this is probably the worst BJ's I've been to.  I don't know if it's just because it was a Thursday evening and it was pretty crowded because they were playing some important game on their TVs, but the service for our table was retarded.   - The hostess sat us down at a table that was 2 chairs short, so my little brother and I had to wait there picking our noses in the middle of the crowded place for a few minutes until they got our chairs, while the rest of my family were already seated. - Our blonde waitress derped on giving us those extra plates to eat our appetizers on, so we had to sit there having to reach over everywhere. - Blonde waitress did not clear out the drink glasses that were finished.  She left those there throughout the entire dinner.  And our family of 6 was squeezed onto a small-ass table, so....those glasses got in the damn way. - Blonde waitress was not on her game when we needed drink refills. - Also the food quality was not impressive that night.   Maybe I was just in a bad mood that night, but BJ's derpy service over there did not help."
Nessa C.,"Irvine, CA",54,89,61,4.0,4/14/2011,"4 stars, but more for service than food. Ordered the fish tacos and it seemed like they just stuffed a fish stick in it and then piled the toppings on. I also got the strawberry lemonade, it was tart and definitely had real lemons in it, but strawberries not so much. Ambience was fun and we were seated in the back patio. The service was top notch and accomodating..food could use some work."
Chelsea C.,"Santa Barbara, CA",8,25,15,2.0,9/28/2014,Awful service. Took forever for our waitress to notice us. Our pizza came before the appetizer. We ended up having several waiters because they were so short staffed. Only good think about the night was the pizookie.
Bobby M.,"Newport Beach, CA",15,56,10,5.0,4/12/2011,"Tons of beers, tons of comfort food and of course Pizza.  I'm sure you've been to a B'Js Pizza before, no need for a deep review.  Enjoy~"
Dee N.,"Fountain Valley, CA",1049,428,85,2.0,3/13/2010,"TRIPOD OF DOOM!!! The pizza pan shook violently toward me when I tried to get a slice of pizza--and not because it wanted to eat me instead, but rather, because the tripod holding the pan was LOPSIDED! Imagine a hot pan of pizza collapsing onto your lap, due to the carelessness of a sucky server! Yeah, not fun! I was a lucky duck that it didn't topple! I found a manager after the scare, and had him trade  the tripod. I would have liked for him to trade the server, too...but I'm not one to cause a scene at a restaurant. Anyway, the white pizza was delish (as it always is,) but the BBQ Chicken pizza SUCKED! The BBQ sauce was burnt--and tasted like ashes! Mac n Cheese was pretty good--great price on that too, but the avocado eggrolls were just okay this time...very bland. Overall, food was a dismal 3 stars, and service was definitely 1 star, so... I'll be sticking to the HB location from now on!"
Chris C.,"Orange, CA",200,80,15,4.0,4/6/2011,"Yeah, I'm supposed to be on a diet since well....... big plans are coming up.  Supposed to be doing the Paleo diet (basically, only natural foods our cavemen ancestors ate). Well, some friends invited me out to BJ's, and I could NOT resist and the diet was over :( Hahaha.  I love BJ's deep dish pizza.  I know there are people like that the thin crust, but nothing hits the spot better for me than when I grab a slice of that Sweet Pig pinapple and bacon pizza, or I sink my teeth into a Great White cheese pizza!!  I love how the crust is nice and think and crunchy and crisp! After eating here, I'm dying to hit up Chicago; Yes yes, I'm sure the pizzas there are different than what I had at BJ's in Tustin, but wow... SO delicious!"
Casey L.,"Tustin, CA",3,2,,2.0,12/5/2014,"I like the food but...Sadly management ""skirted"" their responsibility of keeping a neighboring boisterous and loud large party from disturbing an entire room of customers. The party was so loud I'm shouting still to be heard by my dinner partners, who are less than 2 feet away across the table. We asked politely that the manager ""manage"" the situation and quiet down the party but we didn't observe any action taken or hear an change in the situation after he left. We came to celebrate and felt ""Dissed"" over dollars since the other party was at least double the size of ours....what happened to customer service, leadership and the proprietor...ensuring a quality dining experience for all customers. Managements attempt to try and resolve the issue wasn't followed up on making it an uncomfortable dining experience."
matt C.,"Newport Beach, CA",3,43,4,4.0,8/27/2013,"Was by myself for a tuesday lunch, stopped here around noon.  Crowded but no wait.  ordered the Santa Fe salad with blackened salmon, a glass of pinot (1/2 off tuesdays), was out the door for $26.  Great salad, fun bar, lots of sports to watch, etc.  Service person was a little too attentive, maybe she had read some of the service reviews below?  The pizza that other people around me got looked & smelled great, was wishing I had ordered one until my salad arrived.  Can't find a thing to complain about."
Linda Y.,"Irvine, CA",371,549,21,3.0,4/15/2010,"I never really liked BJ's. I never understood why people rave about their pizzas. Is it really that good? Yeah, they're alright but if I wanted pizza I wouldn't think to go to BJ's. We walked in, easily found a seat, but did not easily find a waitress. That doesn't make sense. Anyway, on to Happy Hour. It's $2 off the appetizers excluding the little plates like kettle chips and bruschetta. $1 off drinks. 1/2 off mini pizzas. The pints of beer are not expensive. They're like $5 each which is a pretty good deal in my book. For 3 people, we ordered 2 mini pizzas (buffalo and mediterranean), potato skins, and nachos. I'm not gonna lie, they were all pretty good. Except maybe the mediterranean pizza. It had olives, sundried tomatoes, feta, pepperoncinis, and chicken. The feta and sundried tomatoes made the pizza taste dry. The buffalo pizza was pretty bomb though. Great buffalo sauce flavor, chicken, celery. The nachos were huge and was topped with chili made with pale ale. The potato skins were pretty good too. I do like my skins crispier though. We paid about $10 each which is great but I don't know... I left feeling full but not satisfied. Nothing is spectacular about this place. I'll go to Happy Hour somewhere else next time."
Jj F.,"Tustin, CA",38,5,,1.0,10/23/2012,If I could give them 0 stars I would. Service was horrible ... There was hair in my food and the plates where dirty... I will never in my Life visit this location again. I love bjs but I guess I'm going to have to love the brea and Huntington Beach locations because management does not have a lid on their basic cleanliness which even a hole in the wall taco joint could get right. If anyone from corporate reads this understand I'm a suit myself and you CANNOT SCREW UP LIKE THIS. It's like if Bank of America lost your money out of your checking account... It's a foundational necessity to be clean in a restaurant.
Andy H.,"Turlock, CA",41,2,,1.0,10/17/2013,"Service started off fine then once we got our food, never saw our waiter again. Took about 50 minutes for them to bring out a coffee... A coffee..... We finally just said forget the coffee and the dessert. Last time I will be coming here. Too bad too because the beer is good."
Carinna R.,"Irvine, CA",32,10,1,2.0,12/30/2012,"Firstly, the calamari was neither crispy or stylish. Just a glut of rubbery squid made for the fast food generation. The deep dish pizza was rotund, thick and packed with stodge just like the fat cats who own this chain. Happy hour more like miserable hour. It can be good though, not tonight Josephine."
Susie I.,"Orange, CA",108,5,3,5.0,11/22/2014,Excellent food and service!  Love their pazookis. I recommend this restaurant to everyone.
Calvin C.,"Irvine, CA",4,82,1,3.0,4/8/2013,I think the overall yelp rating of 3.5 stars is about right for this place. Their burgers are good but doesn't stand out in my mind. Good deals on happy hour and t he pizookie is an eye opener. You'll wonder where that dessert has been all your life when you try it.
