Morgan M.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",174,159,58,3.0,5/8/2011,"I have had wonderful food at the El Toro location, but this time i was not impressed. I ordered the Ahi Salad this time. I had debated with my usual, the sesame salad, and with something spicy, the creole talipa. I definitely wished i had opted for something else! This salad just seemed confused...it didn't know whether or not it wanted to be Italian (based off the dressing), Asian (it had crispy wontons), Mexican (avacado and tomato on the side) or Mediterranean (interesting choice of greens...). The dressing tasted bitter, and the ahi tasted as if it had been seasoned with steak seasoning. I was definitely disappointed, especially because the waitress raved that it was her favorite and their most popular salad. I HIGHLY doubt that. I love BJ's but I will never order this salad again. However, i did order pazooki for dessert: half red velvet, half cookie :) delicious! The pazookie is what saved this review from only 1 star."
Chris C.,"Washington, DC",626,473,249,4.0,2/4/2011,"I've been to about 5 or 6 different BJ's locations, and this one is my favorite. It's a little more spacious than some of the newer ones they've built, and they also have a really large indoor patio area that can seat really large groups for birthdays and other celebrations. I've been here with a group of 25 people before and we only took up maybe 1/4 of the patio.  I really like their house beer selection here, especially the Jeremiah Red and some of the other lighter ones. They have a beer sampler where you can try 8oz. glasses of four different beers in case you're not sure which one you'll like. As far as the food goes, I usually get one of their deep dish pizzas and end up splitting it with someone. It's probably the best deep dish pizza I've ever had at a chain restaurant. My two favorites are the great white and the buffalo chicken, which I think are two of their more popular ones. The fettucine alfredo is decent and so are their sandwiches, but I think the one thing BJ's does really well is the pizza. I also like the root beer floats! But the one thing that separates BJ's from the other similar chain restaurants in my opinion are their pizookies. An oversized, warm cookie with melted chocolate chips with scoops of ice cream piled on top...so delicious. I've come here just for dessert before just to have a pizookie, which is something I probably wouldn't do at almost any other restaurant.  The service is hit or miss here, but i've had more good experiences than bad ones. One time the wait was so long that they actually started bringing out mini sample slices of their pizza for everyone that was waiting to be seated, which is certianly something you don't see every day and I thought it was a nice gesture."
Jeff K.,"Anaheim, CA",1208,940,2711,3.0,1/4/2011,"more like 2.75/5 stars. i came here for my birthday dinner and sadly to say, it disappointed me. first off, they got my reservation wrong.  i asked them to reserve a table for me for a party of 17 for 8pm.  they wrote 7pm.  when i show up at 8pm, they said i didn't make the 7pm time and that we had to wait for the table to open up.  WTF.    i got the full rack of ribs, potatoes with soup.  The potions are pretty filling for anyone.  20$ for the full rack my gf got half greek half great white pizza.  (its cool you can split pizza cuz for indecisive people, its a god send.)  abour 14$ish for the pizza. my friend bought me a snakebite, and it was very delicious.   the server seemed like a new guy, cuz he didn't know what a black/white pazooki was.  black/white = chocolate chips and white chocolate chips with macadamias nuts.  they forgot to give me the complementary birthday pazooki, my friend had to ask for it... and when I did receive my birthday pazooki, the cookie was not cooked properly.  they do not split checks for large parties, but you can always just write how much you owe with your credit card on the back of the receipt.  sat outside, but it was surprising semi warm.   the server seemed very busy, but he forget to re fill up our waters and forget to bring extra water for friends who were missing h20."
Karen Y.,"Irvine, CA",1,4,,5.0,7/30/2013,Here's a tip that I would like to share for those going to BJ's during the dinner hour.  It's tends to get crowded especially during the summer months.  Sign up for the BJ's Premier Rewards and be sure to show your card when you check in.  It doesn't guarantee a wait time but I know we get in a lot faster.  About 10-15 minute wait.  Also don't for get to get a mini pizookie.  It's a perfect size for two or if you're a family then get the bigger one.  Enjoy.
Lauren J.,"Las Vegas, NV",266,296,106,3.0,10/22/2010,"Love/Hate.  Love: I love love love love love the food at BJ's. My favorite pizza is the Sweet Pig without tomatoes. (The tomatoes are huge chunks that probably come from a can). I love to dip it in Ranch dressing. I can put down a personal pizza in about 10 minutes, but it's very very filling.  I am fan of some of the other menu  items as well like the bruschetta and the spinach & artichoke dip.  I cannot say enough good things about the pizookie! I crave these things. Sometimes, I will order on to go and pick it up :) If you are eating dinner with me, you better be prepared to fight me for the  HATE: the service!!! the service sucks at every single BJ's I've ever been to. Sorry to people I know from high school who still work at this location. But, you guys SUCK."
Andrew L.,"Irvine, CA",0,6,,3.0,11/29/2013,"Props to the place for staying open late! The food is ok but even if you don't enjoy the meal, if you have a pizookie, you forget about everything else... so good!"
Gabrielle A.,"Irvine, CA",48,77,29,3.0,4/2/2012,I think you can't go wrong with their pizzas and pizookis. Everything else is MEH or not worth the calories. But between their buffalo chicken pizza and bj's favorite pizza...the bjs favorite is 200% better.
Nate P.,"Costa Mesa, CA",351,8,5,1.0,1/10/2014,doors open so its cold. very long wait. bathrooms are a wreck. food cold. my son's bday gone wrong. he said worst bday he ever had. :(.
Richard T.,"Irvine, CA",3,56,,4.0,5/28/2013,"I am not much of a fan for chain restaurant. BJ is a convenience since its only a mile from home. We do both take-out and dine-in. The food is good and the service is very good. The joint is professionally run including attentive service. The food is not greasy and my kids love it so I am a fan. My 8 and 10 year old sons love the spaghetti with meat sauce. The meat sauce is like catnip to them. For take-out we order the regular size spaghetti with extra meat sauce. I usually boil up extra noodles and mix it in with the extra sauce to feed both the boys. My kids are a fan of calarmari. BJ's calamari is fairly good but the portion is terribly small for even two young kids. When dining in, the child size spaghetti easily feeds each of them. My wife loves the mahi mahi with pineapple fried rice. Our first time experience with this dish included lots of pineapple. This made the dish very tasty. However, when we ordered the dish during our return trip, they sparingly added pineapple to the dish. This totally changed the dish and made it much less appealing.  Their deep dish pizzas remind me of the old Numero Uno pizzas. Thick and slightly sweet breaded type crust with a large variety of toppings to choose from. BJ's beers are bold in taste and also have a big bite to them which I am not particular to. No problem, they have a good selection of common commercial brands available."
Simone C.,"San Diego, CA",32,28,3,2.0,11/2/2012,"A friend and I went to BJ's for a late dinner recently and it was a less-than satisfactory experience.   Starting with the good, our food was BJ's usually high quality, and that's what saved this meal from failure. Now for the not-so-good. We were seated at a visibly dirty table that had pools of fluid and crumbs on it.  The first server who came by put our drink napkins down into the mess.  When she took our drink orders we asked for someone to come clean the table.  The person who did was quick and efficient, and then put the same (now) dirty napkins down on the table.  The server who brought our drinks wasn't the same server who took our drink order.  The server who took our food order was different, too.  As was the server who brought out our soup.  As was the server who brought out our food and first delivered it to the wrong table.  Nobody came back to check on our meal after the food was down, which was particularly bothersome as nobody had brought us silverware.  I went and found someone to give us silverware and brought it back to the table myself.  The only server continuity we had was at the very end and she refreshed our long-empty drinks and brought us our bill. Only the very first server and the final server introduced themselves and it was overall a chaotic and confusing dining experience."
Rick D.,"Irvine, CA",0,5,,2.0,9/23/2012,"Two star rating only because the food and beer is passable. HOWEVER, you can have the best kitchen staff around, but if the servers are rude and incompetent, customers stay away. When we walked in the door to a mostly empty restaurant, 3 workers who I assume should have greeted us and sat us, were busy chatting among themselves, just pointed and said,""You can sit at the bar.""  When the bill came, we paid using a credit card, which the server ran twice. Once for my bill, and another time for someone else's. He could have apologized for the mistake, and I would have corrected it with my bank. Instead, he never said a word, smiled at us and accepted our generous tip. I had to find the extra charge in my bank statement. Food and beer is OK. Rude and dishonest wait staff. Management can do better."
Emily P.,"Cerritos, CA",122,353,39,3.0,8/16/2012,"I have been to quite a few BJ's and this one seems to let me down quite a bit. I got pretty horrible service this time, even having eyes rolled at me and my group when asking about our appetizer that didn't come out before our food or even at all. Then she offered us a pizookie for the inconvenience and charged us anyways .. Customer Service goes far .. I know mistakes happen, but this visit was one mistake after another and the manager did not stick to her word"
Melody L.,"San Francisco, CA",36,517,104,4.0,2/6/2011,"You know, this is another bar restaurant, but I actually like this one. I think because they keep the bar area more separate, and give the same amount of focus to the restaurant area. They are definitely a lot more family friendly. When I've been here, I've gotten a sandwich, and the shrimp alfredo - both were really good. I've had their famed Pizookie too, and I can see why people are such a big fan of it. For me personally, I kind of start to panic when my ice cream is melting and I don't like cookies too much.. But BJ's is always a solid dining experience for me - I've never gotten any bad service. Except maybe the time they didn't return my 4 cents in change after I paid, but apparently a lot of restaurants do this. I don't know why, because it's still MY 4 cents, and if I wanted to leave it as a tip I would do so AFTER I get it back first!"
Danielle S.,"Tustin, CA",18,16,24,4.0,5/15/2013,"I went here for Mother's Day brunch, the food was good, had their baked Italian omelets, nothing special. in general I wouldn't go back for breakfast, rather go to a place that had endless mimosas"
Michal T.,"Tustin, CA",310,65,6,5.0,1/28/2011,"This review is for the last time I went here. The server was a bit of the shy type, but definitely knew his beer and the little hints and facts he gave us were definitely appreciated. The beer recommendation was also solid advice. As per usual, I ordered an off-menu item, which they were more than happy to make, to my enduring gratitude. Simply put, this place is always awesome. I love coming here and whenever I'm back home of if I find a BJs near me, I will not hesitate to take a group of friends with me for a night of good food and drinks. Cheers!"
Kimberly S.,"Irvine, CA",0,2,5,1.0,6/20/2013,"HORRIBLE!!! WORSE PLACE TO GO TO!! I DO  NOT RECOMMEND IF YOU WANT TO GO AND FEEL GOOD ABOUT WHAT YOU EAT!  A FLY in my drink!! AND I DIDN'T HEAR A SINGLE APOLOGIZE FROM ANYONE.!!! They were RUDE about it and obviously just wanted to take that drink from me ASAP to ""clean"" up the mess...  Just came back from a late dinner and had the WORSE service...ruined my day... NEVER want to go back to this nasty place. Went in after 9pm. Not that many people so waited less than 2 mins. to be seated. Our table was messy and our seats were all wet... Had to clean it myself Ordered a drink and some starters.. they came out fast.. but no plates. So I asked my waiter when she walked by for some plates..what does she do?? Doesn't even answer me and immediately goes to this other waiter and orders him to give us plates..  it's fine.. I don't care. I got my plates.. I was about to eat when I see that my starts were CONTAMINATED. the Dishes were not washed completely and I had some residue on my water cup as well!!!  Wait wait... but this is the highlight. Fly in my drink. I told my waiter that there was a fly in my drink, again she doesn't say anything and just takes it away! then this other waiter comes and just asks, ""Do you want another or no?"" WHAT??!?!! no apologies. nothing.  I'm done with this place."
John K.,"Irvine, CA",61,14,2,4.0,4/30/2013,The pulled pork and the pizookies are the best. It's a great family restaurant and bar. Enjoyed watching games on tv here with friends and family.
Karen V.,"Anaheim, CA",2,5,,2.0,10/28/2014,"We came here for dinner and to watch the world series while dining.  I will start out with what went well - the food.  It is consistent with other BJ restaurants that I have been to.  I will also give a shout out to the waitress that we ended up with Tierra (they changed servers after our drink order) - she is the only saving grace for the night.  She was a good waitress and had a pleasant personality and was the only person that made us feel welcome.  Why am I rating them a 2 stars?  First of all the greeters at the front desk - anything but friendly.  I wish I got their names....but they were 2 younger girls.  I hope they don't have aspirations to be much more in life  than where they are sitting - because their attitudes sucked!  They had sour faces when we came in.  All they did was take our name and hand us a buzzer - they are not even the ones to seat people!   I asked if we could sit outside at the patio - one of them said ""yes - if i can find a server for out there.""  Not sure what that meant..... because people were seated out there already.  We searched the bar area, but it was packed due to all the sports events that were taking place...... our name was called in about 10 minutes.  The greeter now informs me that she cant seat us at the patio because a party of 17 will be seated out there (yeah we get it - more $$ - whatever) and she cant accomodate us.   The seater now takes us to our table....which is near a busy walk path and UNDER NEATH the TV screen.   I told her we didnt want this table - the whole purpose was to SEE the TV while we dined.   She said ""i'm sorry.  Are you sure you dont want this table?  I will have to give it to someone else"".    I said ""No, I don't want it and secondly, dont say you are sorry, when I know darn well you could care less where you seat us."" We ended up fending for ourselves and grabbing a table in the bar area....barely.    The first waitress we had in the bar brought us our menus....didnt get her name though... when my boyfriend inquired about a specific kind of beer....she says ""all our beers are listed in our menu.""  - which is fine, we didn't expect her to list the names of everything on the menu - but it was the ATTITUDE and TONE that was conveyed.   if i could guess what she was thinking, it felt something like ""read the menu idiots, I don't have time for this.""  The next thing we knew - SHE wasn't our waitress anymore and our new server took care of us, which was fine.    She was the only person that was upbeat and positive and acted like she CARED. I don't mean to seem trivial and I am not a high maintenance customer - it really all boils down to the ATTITUDE that one person after the next  at this location conveyed while interacting with customers.   These were all primarly the Greeters and Seaters.   If they aren't friendly - who wants to continue with eating there? Service with a smile.  Treating everyone like they are welcomed and that you are happy to answer any questions or concerns..... not at this BJ's. They could care less what their customers want.  Just get them seated, served and out for the next person.    I will still go to Bj's - just not this one."
Sean C.,"Upland, CA",75,6,,3.0,3/19/2011,"I was initially gonna give this place 2 stars, but I reminded myself that BJ's is a chain and it's not their fault if they don't serve high quality food all the time. Keep in mind that this is just a review on the items that I had during my visit and is not a review of its entire menu. Pros: The wait staff was amazing. I know this is hard to believe for some people, but we were taken care pretty well by our waiter. We initially had 6 people in a booth, but several of our friends showed up and we managed to fit 10. Despite it being a busy friday night, our waiters helped us accommodate for our larger party size. I found this quite nice that they brought us more chairs and they didn't seem to mind that we were spilling into the aisles. Our glasses were kept full of water during our entire meal. The waiters were polite and timely with our orders and they accommodated with our several credit cards at the end (all of which is probably not new to most of you who have eaten at restaurant chains). Anyways, the real reason why we're here, the FOOD. Ok, honestly the best thing I had were the fries and they weren't even mine! I know you're probably just thinking ""it's only fries...."" but I'm very picky with my food and I love when the little things are done right. The fries were great because it had a great crisp and crunch on the outside and the taste of mash potatoes on the inside. Perfectly salted and great with or without ketchup. Now on to what I had for dinner, DO NOT get the jambalaya. If you're gonna go to BJ's just stick with their pizza! A little overpriced, but their pizza is definitely what they're known for (although that's not saying much). Anyways, my jambalaya was unbelievably salty! The spice level was good (I expect as much when ordering jambalaya), but everything else was either bland or salty. There was no flavor balance and that's what killed the dish. The amount of food was decent, but given that you're paying 15 bucks that's not saying much. I also had their pazookie for dessert. It was good, but honestly I think you can save yourself a couple bucks and make it yourself. Baking cookies and buying ice cream to put on top isn't very hard. Overview: Pros: staff 4 stars Cons: Jambalaya 2 stars             Fries 3.5 stars"
Diana Y.,"Irvine, CA",480,433,356,4.0,5/23/2012,"It's your basic American fare, Pizza, burgers, sandwiches. I like that they have their own beer and the happy hour deals. Four stars for being close to my house so I can conveniently stumble home any time. Oh and their chicken wings are pretty good too."
