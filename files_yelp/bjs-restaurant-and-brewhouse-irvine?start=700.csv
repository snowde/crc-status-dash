Winnie T.,"Los Angeles, CA",111,332,21,4.0,6/18/2010,"Bjs Restaurant & Brewhouse holds a special place in my heart. It's the go-to place for my cousins and I when we get together for holidays or have a break from school/jobs..  Anyway, we had a party of five and came to this Bjs for the lakers game 6 this past week, and had a great time. We came an hour early to grab seats at the bar before it got TOO crowded for the game. The bar was already full, but a nice lady had a few friends who canceled on her and offered us one of the two tables she was saving. Happy hour at Bjs is 4-7p, and wine is half off on Tuesdays...perfect! Half off mini-pizzas, two bucks off appetizers and a dollar off cocktails. We got some refillable sodas, the mediterrenean mini pizza (my FAV), southwestern mini pizza, mini pizookies, and a couple glasses of wine.  Service was great- waiter came by every ten minutes or so to check up on us even though the place was nasty packed. Our friend's pizza took a while to arrive, so it was comp'd. A tiny fly decided to go swimming in my wine glass halfway through, and they replaced that quickly. Refills came quick and food was delicious. Line was out the door, as hopeful late-birds waited for seats to open. I'm sure on a non-game day it's not as hectic, but I'd definitely come here again to take advantage of the happy hour menu :)"
Lorena M.,"Garden Grove, CA",0,8,,1.0,9/20/2015,"I have never left a negative review on Yelp as I have never experienced such horrible service at a restaurant!  I should've known the minute I walked in!  The restaurant was scorching hot!  The next indicator of poor customer service happened as soon as our buzzer went off and we arrived at the hostess station.  No one greeted us indicating that we would be seated next.  We were just left standing there while the servers talked amongst themselves.  Our section was hot but we just thought perhaps it had to do with the fact that we were seated near a window on a 100+ day.  We later found out that the air conditioning was not working.  Our server was subpar.  I ordered the lunch combo and she said it was unavailable on the weekend. (Then why is it on the menu I thought to myself.). Rather than offering a similar meal, I had to find a replacement while she stood there acting frustrated. Fail!  We suffered through the heat and it wasn't until I got up to go to the ladies room that I realized that I was drenched from the heat.  So, I asked if there was an issue with ac and she said yes, that I was not the first to bring it to her attention.  I told her that I was there to celebrate my friend's birthday and we paid a decent amount for our meal and asked if there was something she could do.  She said she'd get the manager to come over.  The manager came over and he was annoyed.  I informed him about the situation and he gave me a list of excuses and never apologized.  He begrudgingly gave us a courtesy discount for our next meal and simply dropped them off and took off!  This was the worst customer service / experience I've experienced at this type of establishment!  I will NOT be going back to this location and I recommend that you forgo this location and try another one.  I recently went to BJ's at The Block in Orange and the experience was a very pleasant one!"
Janice K.,"Cerritos, CA",0,3,,4.0,10/6/2011,"I love BJ's. I particularly love the ambiance. The lighting is just right and the noise level is also just right. However, the customer service is kind of iffy. But, it's not all that bad.  Out of all the BJ's I've eaten at, I enjoyed my dinner the most at this particular one.  Especially because I LOVE the bruschetta and I've seriously ordered this dish at EVERY restaurant that actually has it on the menu...Therefore, i know what I'm talking about....So basically, what I'm trying to get at, is that this BJ's is pretty darn consistent with everything. Definitely try out this place...plus, the happy hour is pretty amazing. #loyal customer"
Anne M.,"Deerfield Beach, FL",24,274,4,3.0,9/7/2010,"Why, why can't I like this place? Seriously, even with my super lenient Irvine rating scale I can't find it in myself to give this place more than three stars. My friends love BJ's so once again I'm Debbie Downer who reluctantly has to sit through another meal here. So it's a pizza place but the pizza is a strange foccacia, deep dish, CPKesque concoction. I really don't like how bready and greasy it is, but clearly I'm the minority. So I've tried lots of other things on the menu...giant stuffed baked potato with chicken in Alfredo sauce, sandwiches, pasta, soup. Pretty much everything other than pizza.  Thus far, I have only found one menu item worth mentioning and it deserves mentioning in a big way, the PIZZOKIE! Here's something that can't go wrong. Cookie dough baked in a pizza pan served pipping hot with a scoop of ice cream. So after years of trying menu items that have been all but pleasing, I've finally learned to skip dinner and go strait to Pizzokie! This place is always packed so be prepared to wait. The outside patio is a nice alternative and they have generous heat lamps so it's comfortable year round."
Mooki x.,"Irvine, CA",0,332,2,3.0,10/14/2014,We had to wait a little while but that was ok.  The service was just ok.  Not sure if it was because it was crowded or just didn't have a great server.  Ok place if you want loud atmosphere but be prepared to wait.
Gustavo C.,"Orange, CA",1,13,,5.0,7/15/2013,"Recently brought my wife for her birthday here. Wow did we get full and didnt even finish our food. Correction! I did, but I was helping her finish her large spaghetti plate.  The pizookie is awesome!! The waiter was attentive and quick. The staff were all over trying to get those orders out there, turning tables. Overall, for my first experience at bj's. it was great"
Sher M.,"Orange, CA",194,57,10,5.0,1/7/2013,"Im giving this particular restaurant 5 starts solely on their customer service! My friend and I went here for dinner, my friend felt faint and started getting really sick. One of the hostess noticed and she took it upon herself to make sure my friend was ok, they got us seated right away, brought her food and water. They constantly check on us throughout the night. They were so helpful and so nice/caring. Many of the employees where checking on us all night, a couple managers, chef, and servers. I was very impressed!"
Samantha N.,"San Jose, CA",97,61,9,3.0,8/21/2010,"Meh. I don't get why everyone orgasms over the pizookie. It's a warm cookie underneath some ice cream. It's good, but it's not like ""omgwtfbbq!!"" good. Anyway our waitress was terrible. She was incredibly s-l-o-wwww. My drink was empty for like 20 minutes before she came and refilled it. I drink lots and it's not like it was just water.  She was also VERY slow at giving us our bill and picking up our check. I would say it took her 10 minutes from the time she gave it to us til the time she picked it up. We were ready for her to pick it up within a minute of her dropping it off. It wasn't even busy. She was probably just lollygagging around in the back.  The pizzas looked good, but I didn't order it. I got the fettuccine alfredo, which was alright. This place is just meeeh. I wouldn't go back."
Sergio B.,"Riverside, CA",59,3,2,1.0,5/4/2011,"The service here was horrible! They called us for our table but it wasnt even ready yet. We had to awkwardly standing in the middle of the dining room while they finished getting it ready. Our server took our drink order and never came back. It took forever to order. She forgot about us. We saw her take the order for people who came in after we did. By the time she came over, she gave us attitude. Like it was our fault she hadnt taken our order.  They got our order wrong twice. The turkey burger came out a regular beef patty. The peanut butter pazookie came out a chocolate chip.  If you have a choice, dont come here!"
Faris M.,"Irvine, CA",5,3,,4.0,6/26/2011,"BJ's in Irvine is located at a very nice location. The ambience and feel there are very comfortable and cheerful. The food is here is among the best you can get as far as casual dining goes. Whenever you come into this place, you MUST order their Chicago style pizza. It is amazing."
John C.,"San Francisco, CA",386,183,4,3.0,12/22/2010,"I chose BJ's for our group dinner because I've had many positive experiences from other locations. When we walked into the waiting area, someone was serving sample pieces of pizza, which was pretty awesome. However, the service the rest of the night wasn't that great. Some of my complaints include: - There were different versions of the menu printed, so when I ordered a taster of 4 of their beers, the ones I got were different from what I was expecting (they took care of it, so it's not a huge deal, but still...) - We had to constantly ask for more plates/silverware because our waitress hadn't brought the proper amount out; she wasn't very quick about remedying the issue - My cousin ordered a kid's pizzookie for her son, which cost $1.95; all the adults wanted one of the same size; the waitress said they could do it, but they would each cost $2.95. What a farce! We get the same product as the kid, but we get charged more for it!? I've had good experiences with the BJ's chain before, so I don't want to knock it too much, but this particular location wasn't very good in terms of service."
Jay W.,"Fountain Valley, CA",0,12,2,5.0,9/28/2014,Omgosh!  Devin can sing happy birthday in FRENCH! I am sooo impressed!   she didn't have to or even want to sing to my friend but she really took care of us and went above and beyond the call!  Thank you Devin and thanks to BJ'S for hiring such a fun person !
Daniel M.,"Laguna Beach, CA",0,13,,2.0,10/31/2014,"II Never order take out, always online. But, I was between my office and home so didn't have the chance. Wtf, Terrible service, already triple the wait time they told me when I ordered. And, the staff has a whatever attitude about there lack of service. If the food wasn't worth it, I'd walk."
Ann M.,"Anaheim, CA",95,253,2,2.0,11/7/2012,"I've eaten at BJ's - this location in particular - multiple times, but felt compelled to finally write a review after my last two experiences, one of which was last night.  While I generally like BJ's food (don't come here for fine dining or anything exotic but for decent pizza and similar fare it's pretty good), my last two experiences have been disappointing.   About a month ago, my uncle and I came here for an early lunch.  Despite the fact that we were among the first to arrive for lunch at about 11am, service was slow from the get go.  Basically, the staff did not seem ready to start their day, let alone the impending lunch time rush.  They were slow to offer even basic services (appropriate place settings at the table, refilling drinks, getting the check, etc) but the food was OK and we managed to have a decent meal despite the lackluster service. Last night, my boyfriend and I came here for dinner because his mom sent us a giftcard.  Thankfully, the service was greatly improved from the last visit, but our pizza was awful (our appetizer and salads were ok).  When we were presented with the pizza, it was obviously a rush job done by somehow who didn't care and/or wasn't paying attention because it just looked messy - the toppings (pineapple and pepperoni) were not added in anywhere close to even amounts and the distribution was completely uneven.  Also, the pizza was little more than luke warm when it was served to us so it had obviously been left sitting and waiting because a pizza from the oven should at least be hot if served immediately.  Furthermore, upon biting into the pizza, we both wondered if any sauce was even on the pizza.  I pulled off my cheese and saw the tiniest bit of sauce in some of the crevices of the crust - it actually looked like someone put sauce on the dough and then wiped it off.   It was a disappointing visit and a waste of a gift card in my opinion.  I'm unsure if I'll come back to this location again due to the spotty service and food quality.  It's too bad because it's convenient."
Holley L.,"Richmond, VA",122,142,134,5.0,7/25/2012,"Went for lunch, great appetizer specials! I'm not really a beer person but my friend suggested I should try one. I asked the waitress what she would recommend, what she thought would be the most like blue moon. She recommended the Nit Wit, a lighter beer, I surprisingly really liked it. I ordered the fresh mozzarella and tomato salad, it was delicious! My friend ordered the avocado egg rolls and the ahi poke. The egg roles were to die for, especially that sauce! I'm not a fan of ahi...but she said it was phenomenal.          Our waitress was really good, our drinks were filled the whole time and she was very attentive. The other BJs I've been to have lacked in customer service, but not this one :). Maybe I will go for dinner and see if it's the same, hopefully it is! As always, the pazookie...ohhhh the pazookie. Favorite Thing Ever! The pazookie never fails, if all else fails, just order the pazookie and all will be right with the world haha. Highly recommend!"
Lynn D.,"Irvine, CA",0,25,,2.0,3/23/2014,The food is mediocre. I've gotten the ahi poke many times but it's always a hit and miss sometimes being way too salty. At this location our server was extremely rude. I felt like I was not wanted there. I got out as soon as I could.
Steve L.,"Costa Mesa, CA",4,92,2,2.0,3/27/2013,"Slowest service I've ever experienced in a upscale place. 20 minutes for waitress to take our order after being seated, and another 20 for food. On a lunch hour this is HORRIBLE. Btw we showed up at 1:00PM"
Kevin C.,"Irvine, CA",0,30,,3.0,7/30/2013,"Solid choice for a casual night out. First Impressions: The place can get pretty busy for dinners, like 30-45 min wait kind of busy, but if you wait it out it's worth it, because even when it's a packed house, service doesn't suffer and food times don't slow down much, if at all. During lunch it's much more relaxed.  Service: Never had a bad experience here. Friendly, knowledgeable and attentive. Food: The pizza. I've had their burgers, pastas and a handful of other apps and entrees and they've all been tasty, but the pizza is something special, especially with the tomato topping. Definitely one of my favorites around town. Add to that a solid selection of beers (the house beers aren't bad either) and you're in for a good time. Oh, and l'm not really a dessert guy, but the pizookie is too good. Not only is it delicious but the contrast of hot cookie with cold ice cream is very intriguing."
Heidi M.,"Irvine, CA",69,8,,3.0,3/20/2011,"Pizookie, pizookie, wherefore art thou pizookie? Man, I love those things. Have you ever had one? It's like heaven in a little dish. On the seventh day, God rested, and had a pizookie. I'm serious. I should probably tell ya'll what exactly a pizookie IS. Because chances are, if you're reading this, you have not been to BJ's and therefore have not had a pizookie. You have also not yet lived. A pizookie is a thick, hot, melted, chewy, cookie in a little pan with ice cream on top. I know, it sounds like any standard dessert, right? WRONG WRONG WRONG! I don't know what they do. I don't know WHY it is just so good. But it is. You can choose from Macadamia nut, chocolate chip, brownie, and oreo cookies, and chocolate or vanilla bean ice cream. They are all just so fantastic. I know it's just a cookie and ice cream, but I can't help but express my love in this overly extravagant form. My family and I shared a white chocolate chip macadamia nut cookie pizookie with vanilla ice cream and a brownie cookie pizookie with chocolate ice cream. The cookies oozed chocolate and were perfectly hot and delicious, and the ice cream was creamy and complimented them perfectly. YUM. The restaurant in general, however, is pretty meh. It is a chain. It is known for its overpriced but fairly tasty pizza and beer. The service is actually quite fantastic; our waiter was super friendly and prompt with his service. Still, the food is pretty generic, and overall the restaurant itself is a little more buck than bang.  I ordered the Mozzarella Salad for my appetizer, which is this quaint little salad with lots of delicious mozzarella balls, tomato chunks, and thickened balsamic vinegar drizzled on top of a lettuce leaf. I love the firm, smooth texture of the cheese and how the tangy but sweet balsamic vinegar compliments it. The tomatoes also add to the tang, and the lettuce leaf gives it some crunch. I love this tiny salad, which is the perfect size for me, and it's only three dollars! As my entree I ordered the California Chicken sandwich, which consisted of lean, grilled chicken breast, tomato, avocado, garlic mayo, lettuce, and garlicky white bread. They were a little stingy with the chicken, which was also a bit bland; it could have been spiced a little better. There was a PERFECT amount of avocado, however, and its creamy nuttiness definitely saved the sandwich. The tomato and lettuce were fresh and crisp, and the mayo was a nice garlicky touch. And the bread was fantastic. They took white bread slices, toasted them, and added some butter and garlic, which really made it tasty. Overall, it was a decent, rather good sandwich, though at eleven dollars it was a tad pricey. Now, for the french fries. I love thin french fries, so I heartily enjoyed these. They were crispy, and I'm sure they were fried to death, but they were so tasty. A little ketchup and ranch, and I was in heaven. They were spiced well, so they were also delicious without any sauces. The menu itself is fairly limited to generic American food. The calorie contents are displayed on the menu, which I suppose is nice for calorie counters but the fact of the matter is that people don't go out to eat in order to watch their physiques. I found the calorie contents quite off- putting; it's hard to enjoy your food when you're worried about the damage you're doing to your butt. Do us a favor, BJ's, keep your caloric information available, but only upon request. It does not help you to have it right on your menu, especially since the numbers are HORRIFYING. I really should work out tonight..... All in all, BJ's is a solid place. It's not great, but not bad. And it's a wee bit overpriced, but you can't really avoid that if you're eating out. Go ahead and give it a go if you're near the Tustin Marketplace, which is a great location. Just try not to wince at the caloric information. Honestly, I think from now on I'm just going to go to order dessert, and I won't need to look at the menu to know what I want :)"
Arnold W.,"Irvine, CA",710,1580,989,3.0,8/20/2010,"First time I came here back in college was about oh 8 years ago...it was really delicious!! The salmon was juicy and fatty, huge baked potatoes. But ever since I've been here, it's a hit or miss! Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's just okay. The food is okay here. The good thing about this place is that they're great for large groups!"
