Michelle M.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",631,943,154,3.0,2/5/2012,"Service here is really slow, even at 9pm at night! Other than that, this is a typical BJ's with beer and wonderful pizza that we all know and love!"
Maria S.,"Orange, CA",0,10,,1.0,10/10/2014,"My family attended this restuarant for a bday party. We were sat in the outside area and the noise was moderate to bad. The server was overwhelmed and after about 25 miins she got our drink order, she arrived back approx 10 mins later with the drinks ordered and my guiness drink which was just black zero cream head as is per usual. I remarked on the Guinness drink and she responded that 'oh the bartender said we are having a problem with the gas!' I declined that drink and asked for a beer which again arrived delayed and was completely flat so I accepted it anyway. When the food finally arrived one of my daughters was incorrect and my meal never arrived. She finally brought my meal out when we were awaiting our bill and I said well I am not going to eat it now but she did offer a take-out box!!!! The restaurant seemed like a disorgnized mess....I did write a letter of complaint and they never even responded...so we will not be returning"
Kimberly C.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",17,41,4,3.0,12/28/2009,"After being shamed by my 12 year old family friend for never having been to BJs, our families finally decided to hit it up while all of us were home for the holidays. I would describe it as a beer drinker's Cheesecake Factory. The menu is HUGE, and it has lots of photos too, which always wins me over. Each of us had something different but none of them were anything to write home about. I had a turkey burger, but wasn't blown out the water (the cheese wasn't even melted!)  The game changer here was definitely the Pizookie (sp?), which definitely lived up to the hype. The cookie was super gooey and just the right amount of sweet. We were fighting for every last bite, and scraped the pan clean!  So maybe all 7 of us ordered the wrong thing? Doubtful, but overall it was a nice place to be with family, with a delicious dessert to top it off."
CA R.,"Orange County, CA",159,146,23,5.0,9/18/2012,Came here for dinner tonight and it was soooooo good!  Elise served us and she was so attentive and friendly.  Ours salads and pizza were awesome and the triple chocolate pizookie  was ahhhhmazing.  We can't wait to come back again - the best part.... the entire dinner was $20!  Really great value and quality and a great location in the Irvine Marketplace
Brian G.,"Irvine, CA",0,7,,1.0,6/27/2013,"Let me first start by saying I love BJ's food and have never had an unpleasant experience other than at this location in Irvine. And let me add that I have had SEVERAL unpleasant experiences here. First off, the wait time is UNBEARABLE. And unless you go at 10:30 PM you can expect to wait AT LEAST 45 each time if not more. And they look at you when they tell you the wait time as if they're doing YOU a favor. This is a chain restaurant. I am certainly not going to wait that long for a chain restaurant. There is no recognition at this location that anything is amiss. I say skip it! It's not worth the frustration."
Brett I.,"Anaheim, CA",0,20,,1.0,9/30/2014,"What once was a premier eating establishment has now become mediocre, due to the malaise of the management.  There was such a feeling of discontent on our last visit,  my family has decided to take our business elsewhere."
Karen K.,"Mission Viejo, CA",1,26,,2.0,12/30/2011,I was disappointed the last time at BJ's service was not good.  It took the waiter a long time to come to our table.  It was very noisy  and hard to hear our conversation.  I feel that BJ's is not as good as it used to be.  Were they perhaps taken over by new owers??  Karen K.
Alena V.,"Tustin, CA",4,41,,3.0,2/23/2010,"BJ's is a pretty good choice for dinner and drinks with friends. Their food is consistent, their beer is pretty good (I like the Nutty Brewnette, the Porter, and the Red), and they have a ""secret"" menu of specials near the back of the big fat menu. These specials are served ALL DAY EVERYDAY and make eating here very affordable. You can get the SAME  mini pizza as on the regular menu for multiple dollars less. Or you can get half of the giant baked potato with a salad/soup for $6.95! What $6.95?!?!?! Yes, less than 7 American dollars. whoa. And the giant baked potato is truly giant. Even half is way more than I can ever eat and it is GOOD. Also they have the Pizookie. yes, the Pizookie. You may feel ridiculous ordering it but it's warm, gooey, and very tasty.  So why only 3 stars? Even though it's plenty good nothing stands out. Also the wait on just any old night (even mid-week) can be pretty long. And when it gets busy the service invariably slips. And many people are bringing you items, taking orders- sometimes they don't communicate with each other and you don't get what you want."
c s.,"Orange, CA",3,53,16,1.0,6/29/2014,"Rough night tonight. Really slow service, took 25+ minutes for 2 pizzas, fish tacos and a kids meal. Wanted dessert but didn't feel like waiting another hour for them to make a cookie. Even had a coupon for the free pizoookie. Waiters seemed clueless about how to handle unhappy customers.  Food wasn't even that good. Pizza needed more sauce and my tacos were flavorless. As I said rough night. Oh did I mention its about to get worse since they just sat 30 high school age soccer players with huge appetites. Kitchens gonna freak!"
Myung S.,"Artesia, CA",308,222,1444,4.0,3/29/2010,I don't know what they did recently but the quality of everything went up couple of notches especially food. I love their Cajun Pasta. Clam Chowder is always good too. My compliments to the head chef! Great work and thanks for good food.
Brooke S.,"Costa Mesa, CA",0,7,,4.0,9/25/2014,"Everytime I go here, I sit at the bartops because is it self seating and the servers are pretty aware whenever you sit down.  Service is always great, and the food is nothing to complain about either. Their pizza is to die for and you can't leave without their signature pizookies!"
James A.,"Tustin, CA",15,1,,5.0,8/19/2014,I come here all the time after work.  Late night is the best!  My favorite servers are Deven and Bradi. They always take care of me with my picky orders and always get it right.  When going to other BJ's I don't get the same level of service as I do here.  I go out of my way to come to this one for the service!
Michael B.,"Anaheim, CA",111,85,6,4.0,10/25/2012,Amazing salad was so yummy. U have got to try the BBQ salad. Then finished it off with a nice warm cookie and ice cream. The tropical tea is refreshing as well. Love this place. Server was spot on and amazing.
Stephen J.,"Westminster, CA",0,15,,5.0,9/20/2014,"Food was great and service was even better.. we were a large party but Amy, our server, handled it like we were a party of two.   We all had a great experience. .. highly recommend."
Chris G.,"Los Angeles, CA",100,6,,1.0,6/21/2014,"I took my wife and our friend Brea out on a date tonight. We normally love BJs but tonight was another story. We ordered appetizers and drinks and the night started off great. Then we all ordered our food and that's where the normal pleasant experience ended. I ordered a pizza, my wife ordered a pizza with no onion and no mushroom, our friend ordered an Ahi Tuna salad. When the food finally ""arrived"" my pizza was perfect, Brea received an Asian salad, and no pizza for my wife. We sent back the Asian salad and asked for my wife's pizza. They then delivered a poke salad to Brea and a pizza WITH onion & mushroom for my wife. We sent those back and then Brea received ANOTHER poke salad. Once we sent THAT back Brea finally got her Ahi salad that she ordered. While she was eating it, another Ahi salad showed up... My wife, then got her pizza STILL with mushrooms. Our waitress, Mia (?), who said she was new, called her manager stupid at one point and insinuated that one of coworkers was suffering from ""old age"". Another manager stopped by and told us the meals would be covered. My wife FINALLY got the pizza she ordered, after 2 hours! The ONLY pleasant thing about this visit was Nikki, another waitress (not even our waitress) who kept stopping by to make sure we were ok. Mia should shadow and train with Nikki... PLEASE ask for Nikki or her bf Craig (he works there too and is great) if you decide to eat at BJs!"
Selea S.,"Los Angeles, CA",260,41,40,5.0,11/29/2012,"ONE OF MY FAVORITE RESTAURANTS EVER!!!! I seriously love this place so much and it just reminds me of home. I definitely recommend getting the barbeque chicken deep dish pizza. That's my fav. And also the grilled chicken pasta and of course the chocolate chip pizookie! Go here, you won't regret it!"
Kyrk S.,"Burlingame, CA",191,203,18,4.0,11/9/2009,"""I like pizza, I like bagels, I like hot dogs with mustard and beer, I'll eat eggplant, I could even eat a baby deer."" - Homer Simpson I may go to same fancy places, but deep down I'm a simple guy.  I like, no love, pizza and beer.  So BJ's is a no brainer to me.  Their thick, bready, well-seasoned crust is so bomb with just the right amount of oil and flavor to complement their toppings.  Add to the aforementioned delicious pizza a wide selection of beers and you got a recipe for one happy Kyrk.   But pretty much everybody knows that these are facts, the only reason I feel this BJ's deserves a review is that they seem to have better service than the rest.  Most BJ's are, in general, decently friendly, although some can be very ""take your order, deliver order, ask how it is once, then deliver check"" with not much pleasantness.  At this one the employees seem to be much more engaging and nice without being intrusive or slow.  Not only that, when I came here for my 21st, they let me take a dish bucket home in case my I had to gloriously yack out my drunken dinner.  Definitely a proud moment for me hehe...but in my experience most places just give you a crappy plastic bag and send you on your drunken way...not that I've done that...... So yeah, this BJ's knows what's up.  Friendly and cool people working there along with bomb pizza and beer."
Brittani B.,"Irvine, CA",0,14,,2.0,3/19/2012,"I came here with my best friend on Saturday. I was extremely excited to come especially once I saw the stuffed baked potatoes. We started off with 2 appetizers.  First was the Spinach Artichoke Dip. I have never in my life disliked any Spinach Artichoke Dip, Never! This was by far the worst. I believe it's due to the Alfredo Sauce they use. It's insanely bland and really has no flavor at all.  Then we had the Chicken Wraps: These were actually really good. Nice crisp lettuce and the hot mustard sauce hits you like Wasabi. It MUST have wasabi in it because nothing clears my sinuses like Wasabi. It was great! Next I had a ""Wedge Salad"" Now let me say.....I have NEVER disliked Blue Cheese....NEEVER! It was so gross. It was sweet...and tasted nothing like blue cheese. It also had some type of green seasoning in it...Again...I was disappointed.  Then out came my Entree....Chicken Alfredo: silly me, I should have known to change my order once I tried the Spinach Artichoke Dip. This meal was horrible to say the least. It tasted like.....nothing.....it' really had no taste at all. It was a flavorless sauce, with flavorless noodles, flavorless broccoli and four tiny pieces of chicken.  I was going to suck it up and eat it....but then I thought to myself....I paid way too much for this to have to force myself to eat it. So I sent it back and ordered something else.  The General Manager came over, he was VERY nice and approachable. I explained my concerns about the flavorless Fettuccine and my issues with the salad. He brought me out a Bacon Cheeseburger and took the Entree and Salad off of my tab. He did what he could to make it right. But of course ONE last jab...my thoughtful best friend waited for me to get my food before she ate....she ordered her Burger WELL DONE....and it came out bloody....so now here I am with my food....and she is waiting for hers... At this point....the baked potatoes that had my mouth watering in the first place....wasn't even an option anymore....I wasn't in the mood for anymore disappointments. It became so insane that we just ended up laughing about it.....never will we come here again....but it was kind of funny."
gene d.,"Irvine, CA",301,360,143,3.0,1/6/2010,"Where to start? I've been here many times for birthday dinners, dates, and even just for desserts or beer & football.  The food is pretty consistent, but depending on how busy they are, the service can go down (which forced me to give 3 and not 4 stars). One time, the waiter got two orders correct, but had the sides on the wrong plate.  And I've had to try and track down my waiter once for more drinks.  But then there has been other nights when everything is perfect and the waiter is there for everything (was a mid week dinner).  If you go on weekends, be patient and just enjoy the food. As for the food, they pretty much have something for anyone and they are happy to make substitutions as well (salad for fries, rice instead of pasta, etc.). Lots of good appetizers (lettuce warps, wings and beer), sandwiches (meat loaf is a winner), baked potato (all of them superb), chicken (sometimes on the dry side), ribs (really tasty), and of course their deep dish signature pizzas. The crust is well seasoned and the toppings are very fresh.  Oh, and can't end a night without their much copied pizookie (a large scoop of ice cream onto a warm soft and chewy cookie). Yum..."
Moises M.,"Tustin, CA",124,180,82,3.0,12/5/2011,"Come here for there happy hour deals. They have half off their mini pizzas (fatty greasy goodness), $1 off beers all while the games are on. If your a NFL fan they have there deals going as long as a game is on, which is practically an entire Sunday. What mainly brings me here is their beer, a wide varied all brewed in California and distributed throughout the locations. My favorite is the Tatonka stout, it's creamy smooth coffee/ bitter dark chocolate taste that some say is a tad sweet, but it tickles my fancy. The there's their Harvest Hefeweizen, crisp citrusy with light hoppy night that lingers. Both are great beginner beers that I must recommend."
