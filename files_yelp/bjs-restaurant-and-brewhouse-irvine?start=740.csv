Diana A.,"Huntington Beach, CA",170,28,1,3.0,8/23/2012,Hubby and I ventured out of HB for a date night. Staff wass ranging from really nice to rude. The giant baked potato with veggies I ordered was delicious even though there were hardly any veggies on it. My husband ordered the Jambalaya and it was so spicy I thought he was about to bursdt into flames and I choked when I took a bite. The pazookie was to die for of course.
Romey B.,"Costa Mesa, CA",47,43,11,1.0,6/28/2014,"Appetizers were served at least 10 minutes apart. We had to wait a long time for our drinks. The kicker was when I ordered my burger with a Wheat bun. The waiter never explained to me that the restaurant was out of wheat buns until he served the food. Even then, he placed my burger on the table, said ""sorry we are out of wheat buns so we have wheat bread"", and walked away. If I wanted a beef patty on a sandwich, then I wouldn't order a burger. On the bright side, those avocado eggrolls are still amazing. Can I eat this without the sloppy service. I used to go to BJ's in Westwood all the time while I was a student. Service is much better at that location."
Traci F.,"Newport Beach, CA",275,9,3,2.0,6/20/2014,"Went here to celebrate my birthday with some friends. The server seemed to be kind not there. The food was great. I noticed the server was telling her other tables she was handing over the table to another server, which is cool. I'm a server too, I get it. But she decided to keep us. I was still eating dinner when she took our dessert order (which I thought was odd) I figure she would at least wait until I was done with my food before she sent it out. Next thing you know I turn around and they are shoving a pazookie in my face while I have chicken in my mouth.  I was only half way on my entree. I can honestly say from server to server, even if I am in a hurry, or want to go home, I would never send out a dessert while someone is clearly still eating dinner or even make guests feel rushed. It was blatantly obvious she wanted us to hurry the hell up so she could get on with her life. Awesome. Happy birthday to me :/"
The O.,"Tustin, CA",0,36,2,2.0,10/16/2011,"We've been coming to this location for years and have had decent service. The last visit, however, was a different story. A large group of us went for a weekday lunch. It was quiet when we arrived, and we still had to wait to get seated. Our appetizer plates had caked-on food still on them, one-third of us had meals that were not what we ordered, and service was extremely slow. When we asked for the manager, he was borderline rude to us. Our waitress did the best she could. She apologized, and comp-ed us on the messed up items and threw in the desserts. We certainly won't be returning here for a group lunch."
clark n.,"Costa Mesa, CA",3,24,2,3.0,1/13/2011,"It's me again.. 3 criteria (crowd, service, food) I went in during a sunday because that's when they have their game day happy hour the whole day.. $2 off drafts, half off all shareable appetizers & 1/2 off mini pizzas (of course only in bar area). The crowd was fun & family oriented. We got lucky with our seats but it wasn't too packed to find available tables. The service was good, not excellent- we had to ask twice for some things. We ordered many mini pizzas (my fav was bj favorite, cheeseburger pizza- they also had BBQ chicken, & some flat bread pizzas too), the calamari (delish- ask for extra marinara sauce.. A must), and of course to end a meal their pozookie (my fav was white chocolate cookie with cookies & cream ice cream). If u haven't been here ya gotta give it a try!!"
Gabrielle G.,"Menifee, CA",117,101,69,5.0,7/14/2012,This particular BJs has the best service out of all of them. The service in Temecula is consistently terrible and the two in the Huntington Beach area are always so crowded and busy that it affects the service. I love their deep dish pizzas and Caesar salad. Their tomato bisque has always been a lunch favorite too.
Tracy G.,"Irvine, CA",0,12,,5.0,7/10/2014,Thai Shrimp lettuce wraps were very good. My husband had the Mahi Mahi and my son had a deep dish pizza - all very good service by Brady was great and food was fast and hot.
Lisa N.,"Los Angeles, CA",689,708,179,2.0,8/18/2009,"this BJs location is pretty spacious. it was able to accommodate our large party. that's the only thing i REALLY liked here. other then that, it's your typical, busy, hustlin and bustlin kinda place. crowded, loud, chill atmosphere.  the service was..well, it wasn't horrible, but it definitely could have been better. i realize it's hard to serve a big party and it was a busy night, but..i don't know, for a big location like that, hire more workers or something! it took a LONG time for them to actually come around and take our orders...no, we don't want to order appetizers, but can't we just order our food already then? not wait another 20+mins before you come back and take entree orders.  i ordered the chicken and ribs combo, only to be told about 15mins later that they're ""out of chicken and ribs."" well, which one was out? the chicken or the ribs?!? err. that kinda sucked. i don't think i've had many experiences at restaurants where they run out of a certain food...esp not if it's a big chain restaurant like that. ahh. my bf and i opted for a bbq chicken pizza and a giant baked potato.  bbq chicken pizza is really nothing super special. yeah, it's good, but nothing extraordinary. definitely not worth paying $14 for a small one. it wasn't as crispy as i usually like...=( guess deep dish pizzas aren't for me. classic giant baked potato was good, but again, nothing extraordinary. definitely something you can make at home, and again, bacon was not crispy. sniff* i love crispy.  chocolate chip pizookie was heavenly, deliciousss as usual, but again, not something too difficult to make home..it's a nestle toll house cookie with vanilla ice cream.  not worth whatever we paid for it.  and if you drink here, just opt for a pitcher, only $14. it's a better value than just getting a glass. i wish they had more beers on tap though, like other ""regular"" ones. i know they brew their own beers and all, but i'm not adventurous. i'd like a pitcher of blue moon with my food, not some unknown beer that i might not like."
Tiffany D.,"Costa Mesa, CA",229,426,54,1.0,5/30/2009,"Ick. Ew. Blargh. Growdy. Run for the hills!!  Run like you stole something! I actually haven't been back to this place in over a year- that is how bad this god forsaken place is. :P Last I went the service was HORRIBLE, with a capital HORRIBLE. The waitress was a biiiizzzzatch.  Mean little cooo---unt.  Food was way late, I was dying of thirst.. I stopped a bus boy  and asked for a refill...... He comes back after a few minutes.. pour the water in... BAM!... in with my water and lemon is a straw wrapper and bits of food(?). O...M..G... Whatthefuckjusthappened?    That was the last straw (wrapper).   NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER!! NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO!!  Why do you forsake me food lord?!!?!?!? Granted that may have been the wrong person to ask.. but what the fuck is shitty trash dong in the water refiller thingy?!!??"
John O.,"Newport Beach, CA",33,230,36,2.0,10/24/2009,"Bj's is one of those chains that should be better than it is.  Is it the management?  I love the menu and most of the restaurants (except the dumpy one in downtown Huntington Beach) are nice. I experienced something at the Marketplace BJ's that I've had happen to me at numerous Bj's, and that is my appetizer and entree came out at almost the same time.  Isn't an appetizer supposed to come out BEFORE the entree.  And in the case tonight, all we ordered was a salad and bowl of soup -- doesn't that take a couple of minutes to do?  But sure enough, after waiting for a little too long, the appetizers came and then a couple of minutes later so did the mini pizzas we ordered. While I love BJ's deep dish pizzas, mine was screwed up.  When I got the pizza I noticed a couple of slices of pepperoni on my pizza -- but not so much as to think it was a pepperoni pizza since I had ordered a tomato and cheese and the person I was with actually ordered a pepperoni pizza.  When I looked at the bill, indeed TWO pepperoni pizzas had been ordered.  So I'm not sure what I got because if that is all the pepperoni they put on a pizza it was laughable.  At the same time, I really didn't want pepperoni, just tomato and cheese. This is why I eat out less and cook at home more.  Why spend good money for mediocre food and so-so service.  Maybe if there were MANAGERs at these places that gave a damn the food and service would be worth while... Oh, and to the white trash in the booth behind me with the little demon seed that couldn't stay put or quiet, get a BABYSITTER next time.  Not everyone thinks your brat is cute or interesting!"
DOUGLAS K.,"Tustin, CA",0,31,4,1.0,1/22/2015,"Just got take out, order number 319153. I ordered a small classic combo pizza(sausage, pepperoni, and mushrooms) and specifically entered a special request online for pizza to be well done and a small salad with Italian dressing(w/ carrots, cucumbers, tomatoes, shaved Parmesan and croutons). Picked it up at take out counter and cashier confirmed my order, I agreed and he politely put it in a take out bag. I had to ask for a fork, napkins and Parmesan cheese packets. Isn't it just good service if he asked if I needed any of these instead of just handing me a bag and a receipt? Manager problem. Well, stupid me for trusting the cook and the cashier and not checking my order before I got home. I open up my salad and there are no carrots, tomatoes or cucumbers and very little lettuce. Oh well, I think, I'm hungry so I just ate it. Then, I open up my pizza and notice that half the pizza is just cheese, there is only one slice of pepperoni on the entire pizza with a few small mushroom slices and a few pieces of sausage on half of the pizza and it was not crispy nor cooked well done as I requested. Again, stupid me for trusting their competence and that they actually care about quality and a positive customer experience. Again, a Manager problem. So, I call BJs in Irvine and speak to a Manager named Chuck to reiterate my frustration and dissatisfaction as described above. Chuck immediately goes into his trained managerial corporate lingo and actually says,""Sounds like you got the wrong pizza."" Really Chuck? Monday night at 8:30pm? Really? How bout this Chuck? How bout you and the other corporate bean counter managers get out of your office and get your eyes on your kitchen and wait staff to confirm service and quality are consistently being delivered? Just a bunch of sense of entitlement HS and College kids who work here with no work ethic, not a clue on what customer service means, it's just a playtime workplace. And, really no difference in the Manager's competence. So, keep counting your beans, watch your sales and stock price continue to drop and try to figure why your customers are not returning. You won't, instead you'll just find a way to decrease the portions and quality and increase your prices. I'm done. Never again! America, Stay with your local owner operated businesses. Boycott the corporate restaurants! They only care about their profits, not your experience or value received."
alli t.,"Torrance, CA",11,252,229,3.0,5/30/2010,"Today's review is for the takeout, although I've sat down to eat here several times.  Take out is just like the sit down food, except it comes in plastic take out containers. Today's order included Santa Fe Spring rolls which have a tiny kick and come w/avacado cream and a spicy Santa Fe dressing, chicken tenders w/bbq sauce, bbq pulled pork sliders (4 to an order), the bacon cheeseburger pizza and cobb salad.  My favorite today was the bbq pulled pork sliders...soft roll, tender pork, bbq sauce plus fried onions."
Paul C.,"Irvine, CA",70,12,,1.0,8/25/2012,"The food was very bland starting with the steak being overcooked, then the pizza being served cold, and my french dip tasted like leather no matter how much aj jus there was."
Daniel C.,"Irvine, CA",0,4,,5.0,2/18/2013,Very good service and food. Had a blast with my family and they made me feel like royalty! A little expensive but well worth it. Will come back soon.
Sher L.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",597,183,1534,1.0,4/25/2011,"A MUST READ!  You'll definitely regret booking a birthday party here.  I made reservations here for my bf's bday party.  We thought it would be a cool and fun atmosphere and good for all ages since my nephew and his friends were attending and some are just 21 years old and the rest of us are in our early 30's. I had to change the number of guests a few more times than expected as many of our guests weren't prompt with RSVP'ing on the E-vites. Every time I called in to make changes to the number of guests, the rep had to put me on hold for a long time just to get a manager there to verify the bday reservation.  So annoying!  They also told me that if I was over 15 minutes late, they would give my table away. Unbelievable!.. as I had 15 guests RSVP'ing thus far. When we got there, the place was seriously so packed with literally NO tables available.  It was so busy it made the economy look like it was booming again.  It had a really nice casual feel but way too loud.  The hostess walked us to the patio area where all the birthday reservations were held and I noticed that they broke up my party into two separate rows of 10 seats per table as if a cafeteria style.  I was like wtf! How could my guests enjoy each others company if we're all broken up?  So I ask our server if he can move the tables together in one straight line and he said  there wasn't room for that.  He was so reluctant to accommodate us that my guests had to rearrange the tables ourselves. So we all get seated and the waiter takes over 20 minutes to come back for drink orders.  I thought I'd start us all off with a double shot of chilled Patron to kick off my bf's bday. 15 minutes go by and drinks arrive.  The alcohol was so warm and never even  chilled at ALL!  I tried to flag our waiter down again to no avail.  After another 15 minutes waiting for him to return to the table, he re-appears and I tell him that the shots weren't chilled.  He just acted nonchalant and took it back.  By now, everyone's so irritated because the wait was so long that most of our guests had already drank their shots.  The waiter takes my shot back, has it chilled, and comes back with a bill for my bf.   He pleads with us and tells us that he won't be seeing us again and that he's going on a break and asked if we would mind closing the bar tab so he can go.  My bf, being the really sweet guy that he is, paid him about $220 cash and another $20 for tip.   New waiter comes, takes orders, re-appears after 25 minutes and randomly lays down a bunch of orders on the table and left.  So I started asking everyone what they ordered because nothing looked familiar. To my surprise, the waiter only got two guests' orders right and the rest was NOTHING anyone else ordered.  At that point I am livid because the waiter disappeared again and I'm looking around trying to see if I can flag ANYONE down to help us. For the last hour, no waiter came by to check on us or ask us if we needed anything.  Another 15 minutes go by and he finally returns.  We send back all the incorrect orders.  An hour later, half my guests are still waiting for soda!  Some are just tired of waiting and the other half finally get their food.  It was so unbelievable that the waiter disappeared again and didn't even ask anyone if they needed drinks, let alone refills, and or condiments .  My guests just gave up at that point, ate whatever was brought to them with or without drinks and or condiments. There I was, spending 90% of my time trying to keep my eyes open to flag a waiter down again for the 25th time! I finally decided to get up and find the manager.  I waited about 5 minutes near the cashier's podium and asked our initial waiter for the manager.  He immediately asked me if I was going to report him and I said I was reporting the other waiter. Little did he know, had it not been been for the great Facebook group shot he took for us, his ass would be grass too. Manager comes by and I tell him the entire story.  All he did was say he was sorry and to call him next time we come again and handed me his business card.  I told him I would never come here again and it was the worst service I had ever experienced in my life.  It seemed he couldn't care less.   Fed up, we just decided to end the night and close the bill. The bill totaled over $300 with a mandatory gratuity of 20% included.  When my bf paid cash for the bill he added ANOTHER 20% on the bill without knowing it was already included!  It's no wonder NONE of the waiters gave a rats ass.. They were already guaranteed 20% on the bill. Imagine if we actually itemized the bill!  There would probably be a ton of orders that wasn't ours. Too bad we didn't discuss the bill until we got home. I thought about calling the manager but I figure it would just create a lot more stress on us and we were just happy to have the nightmare end. We seriously could've had a better experience at Chuck E Cheese's!"
Alyssa C.,"Whittier, CA",79,54,6,5.0,6/5/2012,"Obviously home of the pizookie. They are all amazing and they have trios if you want to try more than one flavor. Also, their pizzas are on point. The managers sometimes allow happy hour prices in non happy hour areas. I have sat in dining, outside and in the bar area, all service is good, restrooms are clean, I haven't had anything that didn't taste good. My friend swears by a beer combo called ""Jerry Burst"" Jermiah Red and Berry Burst."
Michael P.,"Santa Ana, CA",277,1,,5.0,4/27/2014,Devon and Alex are the best servers in this place. Fun and personable for sure! This place treats you right
Chago M.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,15,1,2.0,1/20/2012,"I have been eating at BJ's for over twenty years. I always get the Bj's Favorite Pizza. Tonight I got the worst Pizza ever. The toppings were all bunched together  and some parts were just crust with no toppings. To add insult to injury, the pizza was sliced horribly so that the pizza fell apart if you tried to serve youself a piece. This ""large"" Pizza was almost $25!  Prices have gone up and quality has gone down. I will not come back."
Lauren G.,"Brea, CA",328,313,101,4.0,12/14/2009,"Had a late lunch, early dinner, even earlier beer thirty here yesterday. Parking sucks in the Marketplace but it wasn't too bad to turn me and my friends away. The wait was lass than 5 minutes and they sat our party of three.  Pitcher of Jeremiah Red for the table and one of us ordered an Irish Root Beer. Said cocktail consisted of Bailey's Irish Cream, Jameson Irish Whiskey, Butterscotch schnapps and one other thing? It looked yummy.  Pizza was a large Spinach and Artichoke which was delish, though I could only eat one slice  Service was speedy, though it is a little pricey.  All in all good food and nice atmosphere."
Jennifer M.,"Tustin, CA",101,13,1,2.0,7/9/2014,"I went here 2 nights ago with my boyfriend. We are barely 18 years old were just on a date. The food is always pretty good here with slowish service but friendly waiters/waitresses. However, since the restaurant has gained speed in service, the friendly atmosphere and amazing food went downhill. Our waitress, Devon, rushed us the entire time. We got an appetizer maybe a minute before our actual food. Then after 5 minutes at most of trying our meal, we were rudely asked if we already wanted dessert and after saying not yet, she quickly added how it would take a whole 10 minutes to make so she needed to know. After another 5 minutes, the same thing happened. I said yes for the heck of it and we got the bill set on the table before the dessert was set down. Not to mention that during the service, we overheard her talking to another waiter about how we needed to hurry up eating and that she was trying to rush us out. So rude! I ended up feeling sick afterwards from having to rush enjoying the food. We were in and out of that place in under 40 minutes - including the time it took to seat us! Ok Food + Rushed + Rude Staff = Not Coming Back."
