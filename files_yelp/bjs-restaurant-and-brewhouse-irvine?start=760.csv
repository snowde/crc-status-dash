Jon N.,"Garden Grove, CA",225,548,58,4.0,6/29/2009,"Now that I have a job I can upgrade my college diet consisting of  Papa John's pizza and Coor's Lite beer to something more white collar like BJ's pizza and micro brewed beer.  As you can see the contrast is absolutely stunning.  Yeah!  Life is good.   Lots of people take their dates here.  I love people watching, especially couples or people on dates.  You can easily see how the date is going by the amount of conversing, hand gestures, eye contact, and facial expressions.  I've seen some girls who can't wait to get out of there, and some where they don't want to take their eyes off their date.  This one time this guy and girl was sitting in front of us and I was watching them.  It was obvious they were on a date but there was no chemistry.  The guy was watching the Laker game most of the time and the girl would try to strike up a conversation but he always responded to her questions with typical male grunts as he was watching a sports event.  He would only pay attention to her during commercial breaks.  Near the end of finishing their meal he went in to casually hold her hand (maybe because the Lakers won??) but she pulled it away.  Crash and burnnnnn... The pizza here always comes out great.  The crust is always crispy but not overcooked.  The verity of toppings that comes with it always complements it nicely.  What I love is that BJ's pizza always reheats up nicely in your oven at home.  I actually think the crust is even better if you reheat it just right.   The only thing I don't like about this place is the long wait and the chicks taking down your name are always a little snobbish, although it's always a different set every time I visit."
Brandon H.,"Irvine, CA",19,8,,4.0,6/23/2012,"I rate this place a 4 stars because I enjoy their food, IF you order it correctly.  As a big fan of chicken wings, I don't really like the way BJ's prepares it, however, if you order them ""TOSSED"" and ""EXTRA CRISPY"" you will get them the way wings are supposed to be served and they are very good. Prices aren't bad during lunch and happy hour, but if you are here besides those time frames expect to be overcharged for an average beer.  There is nothing special about BJ's in general. I do like the bar tenders at the Irvine location, they are friendly.  One major tip... do not go there on a Thursday night and expect to find a seat in the bar area, for some reason it is always packed."
Shannon L.,"East Bay, CA",1354,2575,3295,4.0,6/30/2007,"I love BJ's happy hour!  Mini deep dish pizzas and other appetizers are all discounted.  The pizookie is so yum and I give them many stars since I don't know any other restaurant that came up with this delectable dessert. My favorite is the BBQ chicken or Great White (alfredo sauce) pizzas.  This  place is definitely good for groups or sports fans because they have a couple big screens and TVs all around. I'm not much of a beer drinker and they have a lot of tasty, light beers."
Aaron D.,"Anaheim, CA",421,415,27,4.0,3/4/2009,"Conveniently located near the Marketplace in Tustin/Irvine.  I think I am a bit jaded toward chain restaurants but BJ's has great beer.  As for BJ's - I often avoid going there because I don't really like any of their appetizers. They are not awful they just also are not great. They need to work on more variety in the menu and on adding some complexity to their recipes. Most bars can make the appetizers they are offering. The Lettuce wraps are pretty good. If you eat meat then the Angus sliders are ok. But, in general: the appetizers are not great. Appetizers don't make a restaurant; but if your a brewery you better work on your appetizers or people will eventually quit dropping in for a beer. As for the beer - I really enjoy the refreshing quality and flavor of the Brew house Blonde and the two varieties of Pale Ale. The Heif  at BJ's however has a nasty aftertaste. The Jeremiah red is fantastic. And the freshly brewed Root beer is worth trying. Its also delicious with ice cream as a dessert. On to Entrees. The Salmon is not very good. It could be that its because its farmed and from the Atlantic. Unfortunately many restaurants have not learned that cheap, farmed, crappy, Atlantic Salmon is not every going to taste elegant or amazing. Its going to taste like cheap, farmed, Atlantic Salmon. The clam chowder is pretty tasty. They don't always consistently deliver it hot but when they do its wonderful. The Chardonnay Shrimp Pasta is delicious. They sometimes bring it out with some nasty bacon on top but other times they don't. And some people probably prefer some bacon on their pasta. But, the sauce is fantastic on it. The Jambalaya is pretty tasty here too. They have a fantastic pazookie. Its a giant cookie with a nice scoop of ice cream served right in the middle of it. Its really a bit much for me but there is nothing wrong with that. This location is much bigger than some of the Oceanside locations. The service is pretty good. Some times its very busy but there is a lot of seating. I assume BJ's makes big bucks.  This is a fun place to hang out with friends at."
Robert C.,"Montebello, CA",26,3,74,4.0,5/29/2011,"The pizza is good, great flavor, soft crust, but the service is slow at the beginning. A couple of times it took 20 minutes before anyone came around to take our drink orders. But the pizza is great..."
Philip S.,"Irvine, CA",15,202,31,3.0,1/19/2012,Beer sampler is good but you should split if among two people if you intend to finish it in the time it takes to eat a meal.
Alex O.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,16,,1.0,9/11/2012,"Went to the restaurant Sunday September 1st. Not the first time there or any other.  The server was too busy, the person that brought the drinks was rude and the food did not have enough ingredients. How can you serve a pizza without the main ingredient. Overall experience at this BJ's was bad.  Not going there again"
Marshel S.,"Phoenix, AZ",12,37,6,3.0,3/21/2009,"First the upside... For a micro brewery/restaurant BJs is par for the course.  If I could give it a 3.5 star rating...I definitely would. The Mediterranean Pizza is wicked good.  The Jeremiah Red micro brew is a nice Irish ale, and the place is usually packed---especially if there is a sporting event going on (Lakers game, March Madness, Football game, etc.).  It is all you can ask for in a sports bar micro brewery restaurant. Now the downside...    I had only one bad experience with BJs out of the few times I've been there.  I tried to call ahead to have a table ready for a surprise party for my wife--and they said that they could not accommodate.  By the way...I was asking for a table for 4--not half the restaurant.   They do have this ""call-an-hour-ahead-to-put-your-name-on-the-waiting-list"" thing, which is totally bogus.  So I played their call ahead game, and then they said that they cannot take reservations.  So I called and spoke to someone else, and they took care of it, only to arrive and find out that they didn't put my name on the ""call-an-hour-ahead-to-put-your-name-on-the-waiting-list"".  When we arrived, they took care of it anyway, but overall they took something simple, and made it very difficult. Next time---I'll plan a surprise party at a place that takes traditional reservations."
Valerie P.,"Tustin, CA",9,12,6,1.0,8/26/2013,"Horrible says it all!  Went to enjoy a nice dinner with my husband tonight and it was a huge disappointment.  First the server forgot his salad.  When we asked her about it, she tried to BS us by saying that it comes with the dinner...like we've never eaten out before?!  Really just apologize and get the salad!  Then after waiting over 30 minutes for our food, we asked for a manager.  He went to the kitchen and came back assuring us that we were priority and our food would be right up.  45 minutes comes and still no dinner, while all of the tables around us were being served.  We asked for the manager (Joe) again.  He looked our way, went back in the kitchen and we didn't see him again.  We walked!  Nicely done...we won't be back and we will surely share this experience with everyone we know...and anyone who reads this review."
Jay N.,"Irvine, CA",1,45,,1.0,11/2/2013,"My wife and I try to come here regularly and regularly we are disappointed with the service, poor food quality and out right poor managment. What was once a great BJs is no longer. We came in last night Nov 1st. around 10 pm after the Wasa Sushi was closed earlier before 10 pm and ordered a simple dinner here. .. to our dismay the pizza we were told was made wrong and we had to wait.  It happens so no problem we did the place was full... well after over an hours wait later the pizza comes in and its wrong again.  I'm saddened that the service here is simply terribl. They have teeny boppers running around waiting on tables and managing this place...  the kids need support help maybe some traing with service.  The table next to us had similar issues... when our server noticed the pizza was wrong and we were seemingly upset he said he will bring his manager... well after a 10 min wait his manager he mentioned was busy and couldn't come. Just terrible... we're very limited around the ranch here in choices for good pizza places and had even more issues with CPK pizza across the street before...but looms like we may start going there again..."
Erica C.,"Garden Grove, CA",79,31,1,5.0,3/25/2009,"Always come here for lunch when I'm in the neighborhood.  The first time I came here, I ordered the tomato, basil, sausage thin crust pizza. The manager brought our food and insisted on serving my first slice. As he lifted the first pizza slice off the pan with the spatula, the slice tipped over unto the table. The look of embarrassment that washed over his face was just priceless! He just stared at the sad little pizza slice splattered on the table for a moment.  It was no big deal but he apologized profusely and later offered a FREE PIZOOKIE!!!  Nothing can get better than a free PIZOOKIE."
Karen C.,"Riverside County, CA",2,22,14,4.0,6/16/2012,"Good food, moderately priced.  My daughter and I split an entree (Parmesan crusted chicken). It was delicious and more than enough food for both of us. If you are looking for something lighter in calories, try the balsamic chicken (my favorite).  And of course we had pizookies!  They are SO good.  I think we have tried them all now.  My daughter likes the red velvet and I like the cookies 'n cream (yummy!!). The service was very good as well (alert the media--finally waiters who were attentive and helpful--yay!).  My restaurant experience is SO much more pleasant when the wait staff is engaging and actually appear to care about what they are doing!  Love it!"
Bill H.,"Folsom, CA",9,72,,3.0,4/10/2012,I generally like BJs. Had the classic chicken club which was very good.  Service was a little slow so they get 3 stars. Also the fried cheese was really good. one of the best I have had
Kat L.,"Mission Viejo, CA",312,456,40,2.0,12/12/2008,"Pizookie = good  service = needs improvement location = pretty spacious overall = just right sweet to hit the spot.. although too much of it! lol The Pizookie was a little overdone for my taste b/c each second it got tougher and tougher.. and fast! Still I like the Pizookie and that was the sole reason we came here.  I normally now avoid BJ's like the plague.  My sister is going to kill me when she finds out I went.. and paid for myself without her.  She offered to pay over Thanksgiving and I just scoffed at her O=9 Tonight, I wanted to end the difficult meal with something sweet and good.  A pizookie sounded nice but there were some difficulties in ordering.  Still at least I got my pizookie fill for the whole year.  I don't think my sister will like hearing that O=9"
Keisha V.,"Long Beach, CA",16,67,6,5.0,2/19/2012,"I love BJ'S. Obviously their pizza is amazing. But, I live for their avocado egg rolls and I die for the parmesan crusted chicken. HOWEVER, how could I forget PAZOOKIE HEAVEN! Best dessert ever ahhh!"
Robert M.,"Corona Del Mar, CA",1725,1258,47,4.0,5/4/2009,"This place is insanely popular.  I read an article that claimed that this particular BJ's Restaurant and Brew House location was the most profitable out of the whole chain, and I believe it.  It's almost always packed.   My theory on that is this - once the area around it became saturated with single family residence homes, families wanted a fairly kid friendly place where they could go and get a beer, glass of wine, and martini.  In support of this theory, I'll note you'll often find families here, but there are also groups here (just saw a baby shower here last week), and sports fans in the bar watching the hockey/soccer/basketball/baseball/football game on the big screen.  The food is good, and some of it, like the famed pizookie, is unique.  The shrimp lettuce wraps (new) are nice, and the beers are okay.  The fact that they are open later than surrounding businesses certainly helps also.  For a chain, a nice place.  Service can be wildly varied depending on how busy they are."
Chris S.,"Irvine, CA",8,65,13,2.0,6/28/2009,"I had lunch here once with coworkers, great food. So I tried to take gf there a couple times for dinner, both times I ended up leaving totally unattended because I got tired of waiting for someone to take our drink order, let alone dinner. So I guess that means, horrible service. I guess if you are cool with waiting a really long time to be part of the in crowd of irvine's young people, and being serviced by them (with an obvious hiring focus on looks over ability to do the job, that being serving people) , this is your spot."
matthew p.,"Anaheim, CA",18,252,134,3.0,1/13/2012,buffalo chicken wantons were disgusting sweet pig pizza is yummy chickens tenders and fries on lunch menu is a good bargain service is really really slow at lunch time
Thu N.,"Orange County, CA",347,341,255,3.0,12/3/2008,"This is a pretty balanced score.  I'm not too fond of their overall menu, but if I have a mad craving for pizza, BJ's would be my place to go.  I love my pizza thick, and simple---so I always order their Pepperoni pizza.  2 pieces would put you over the top since it's so thick, yummy! I also hate to sound like a broken record but their Pizookie is superb.  My favorite has to be the Peanut Butter one.  When you combine the saltiness of the PB cookie and ice-cream, that's just PMS heaven for any girl out there =)   Altogether, It's  a scaled down version of Yard House, but their Happy Hour is my 2nd favorite place to go.  Only thing is, it ends at 6.  Their girly drinks aren't as good as Yardhouse.  I would say it's more of a place to chill with your buddies to watch a game, whereas YH is a combination of both socializing with new people and/or hanging out with your buddies.  Wait time sucks anytime of the day.  You're better off stalking those who are seated at the booths in the bar area, and just staring them down until they leave.   Decent local spot, but don't drive more than 15 miles if that's what it takes to get there."
Kathleen B.,"San Diego, CA",128,463,83,4.0,4/6/2009,"Yes mediterranean pizza!! I like that they scoop the pizza out for you - otherwise I wouldn't know how to handle all those toppings.  Yelpers, I may be selling out since I am not reviewing a mom and pop pizza shop.. but I won't deny it.  BJ pizza's are good and plus they were open late when we needed a place to chow.  Everything in Irvine closes at 10 or 9 or 8:30!!! However, I would not come here on a saturday or friday night because of the wait nightmares..  Last night when we came by (sunday night) it was mildly busy and not not so dead that we felt we were inconveniencing the staff by eating there (maybe I'm the only one who gets that way when you're the only group in the restaurant) AND we were able to get a seat quickly :) Claps BJs -- CLAPS."
