Black X.,"Los Angeles, CA",227,692,14,2.0,11/18/2008,"Oh brother.  If I hear one more thing about how great ""Pizookie"" is I'm going to jump off the Fairview Bridge and wave to South Coast on the way down. This place reminds me of ""Office Space.""  The tacky restaurant Jennifer Aniston works in--or ""Clown Burger"" in a movie called ""Don't Tell Mom The Babysitters Dead.""  You cannot believe people actually enjoy spots like this. Their pizza is thick crap.  Just laughable and not half as good as Round table--for twice the price.  Nothing unique.  Just semi-cheesy cardboard. But this Pizookie fascination.  Why?  Go to Border's Books--buy one of their stupid chocolate chip cookies and throw some crappy Dreyer's Vanilla Ice Cream on it.  Wow!  You have your amazing customized dessert. I saved you ten bucks."
Jasz J.,"Hollywood, CA",206,198,155,4.0,5/7/2011,"This is a chain restaurant that I don't mind at all.  Their handcrafted draft is very well stock and the Jeremiah red (A Silver Medal winner in Strong Ales at the 1996 Great American Beer Festival. This Irish-style strong ale is brewed with a secret blend of five imported specialty malts. Not too hoppy in order to emphasize the complex malt flavor and fruity aroma.) is my favorite, very tasty beer and well balance. Perfect location for food and sport game watching.  With their deep dish pizza and pizookie (freshly baked, hot out of the oven, rich and delicious cookie topped with two scoops of vanilla bean ice cream and served in its own deep dish. Choice of Chocolate Chunk, White Chocolate Macadamia Nut, Peanut Butter or Oatmeal Raisin Walnut?) for dessert, oh it's a girl playground any date. Lol!!  As I am a crazy fan of NBA, totally sexy to come here cheering away with the crowd. Lakers all the way!! Good crowd, food and environment make BJ wanted all the time!"
Albert J.,"Irvine, CA",23,32,,3.0,12/19/2009,"I went to eat lunch today with the family.  It's a popular place so I expect a wait.  Today (a Friday) was 15-20 minutes.  The parking lot is always a zoo, but that's expected as well. We took my 5 month old baby girl with us, and she was in a stroller.  I mentioned this as we asked for a table.  Unfortunately, they made us take her out and sit her in a high chair adjacent to the table because of a ""fire hazard.""  However, next to us, there were two tables with strollers adjacent to the table.  Hmmm, you say.  Yes, I say so too. The waiters/waitresses at BJ's are hit and miss.  Some are exceptional and really do try to make the visit a pleasant one by staying on top of what we need.  Today was inbetween.  Things just seemed to drag on and on. Overall, the food was okay and nothing special.  It's a bit of chaotic atmosphere, but that's expected as well.  I wouldn't recommend it as a place to go often, but maybe once in a while."
Loretta R.,"Whittier, CA",10,105,12,1.0,2/25/2012,"Worse bj experience our server only took our order and got our check.  We had to ask for refills, our party of two was ignored except when we paid.  Yea the server came quick then."
Phyu A.,"Irvine, CA",98,52,6,4.0,8/2/2011,"The pizzas are delicious, but I LOVE their pazooki. They actually have a new one called red velvet pazooki which is the bomb dot com! Other than that it's a decent place."
Niloo S.,"Yorba Linda, CA",44,188,234,4.0,7/23/2011,"Always good food, good service, have something for everyone. The pizookie is super popular, im not a huge fan but ill eat it. There pasta and sandwiches are all really really good ! The pizza is good but it can get a but heavy sometimes dont be afraid to try other things there all really good !"
Kari H.,"Tustin, CA",2,10,4,4.0,2/21/2014,"I went to BJ's with a friend that had never been there before.  We had a great time.  We had Bonnie as a waitress and she was awesome!  Friendly, courteous, knowledgeable about the menu and quick to refill drinks.  The menu is large, so most any taste can be fulfilled.  We started with the avocado egg rolls and loved them!  I have the Sweet Pig and my friend had one of the burgers.  Other than having a hard time hearing each other, the experience was great!"
Kristine W.,"San Francisco, CA",2,26,,4.0,7/30/2012,"i thought this place was great! i went to both the Happy Hour bar and dine-in for dinner and both were awesome :) Happy Hour is pretty long from 3-7pm but i'm not complaining! the cocktail i got was perfect for me cuz i like them sweet and not too much alcohol in them. they only subtract $1 off of cocktails in Happy Hour but hey any discount is a good discount. i had their half-off mini pizzas before too and those are really worth it and can fill you up. for dinner, i tried their BJ's traditional deep dish pizza and it was AMAZING. the bread was so light and fluffy and the toppings and sauce was just amazing.i shared a pizza with friends but now i wish i had a whole one to myself cuz it was just that good. yummmmm. and then i had their pizookie and got it half red velvet and half milk chocolate. IT WAS DIVINE. i never had a pizookie this good before and i think it was cuz of the red velvet. the milk chocolate was just whatever but that red velvet cookie was FREAKIN' AMAZING. i was about to gobble it up in seconds but i was sharing it with friends so i had to hold myself back. lol.  service was also really good and very attentive. my only complaint was that that you get a 6-inch pizookie for $6 and i found that really expensive. i expected the pizookie to be bigger so i was disappointed with its size cuz it was so so so tasty T^T i really would give them 5 stars in terms of taste but price and portion size subtracts one star for me. all in all, i do really like this place though!"
Gigi M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",1001,687,2181,5.0,2/19/2009,All I gotta say is 5 stars for the following:  ~PB Pazooki  ~Avocado egg rolls  ~Beer selection  ~Menu filled with delicious of variety of different flavors  ~Chill/sporty/contemporary design  Have never left dissatisfied at any BJ's!
Anne N.,"Albany, NY",126,406,323,2.0,11/1/2008,"I'm assuming this was the place at the Tustin Marketplace... I heard about this place from a friend and ended up coming here for another friend's birthday.  My first assumption was that it was just like Cheesecake Factory-esque food.  I was about right in terms of quality and quantity.  Great food here.  I tried the Parmesan chicken.  That was a delight, loved the sun-dried tomatoes. For dessert our friend got two Pizookies for his birthday and we all shared that.  I know this place is famous for it and everything, but you can technically make the same dessert at home.  Still good I supposed.  I was super full from the chicken! The main reason why this place is a 2 star place, it's the service here!  I wouldn't mind to give it an average rating, but I can't.  We made reservations that one person said we could do.  Another said we couldn't the first time we called to confirm and were told we had to call a half hour before.  Did that and came to the restaurant.  No table.  1 hour wait.  Finally got a table and then we ordered.  Food took forever to come out.  Then the bill took about 40 minutes to come!  Ridiculous. I'm sure other Yelpers have said the same thing, i think it could be a hit or miss with the service (and maybe food, I have yet to try other stuff).  The servers weren't jerks, they were just super busy and the place was packed (as always I'm sure)."
Jocelyn M.,"Inglewood, CA",53,431,238,5.0,9/22/2011,"hard to beat half price mini pizzas, $2 off appetizers and cheap drinks for happy hour and PIZOOKIES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! thats what we got when i went with my friends. mini cheese and tomato pizza, spinach and artichoke dip, drinks (3 of them) and a pizookie. it was heaven, and less than $50, sweet!!!"
Matt R.,"Orange County, CA",20,419,238,4.0,2/16/2012,"I rarely update my reviews and I am not a huge fan of reviewing chain restaurants, period, or chain restaurants. However, I recently moved within walking distance of this restaurant and have the opportunity to experience it on a different level, more often. They have a very good selection of beers on tap. While not huge, they have some decent microbrews, including their own, that most places just don't have. For example: I'm a huge fan of stouts and porters. If I am LUCKY a place MIGHT have Guinness on tap. They have a house porter and IMPERIAL stout (high alcohol content.)  They also have a red ale, which no one seems to do anymore. I guess there aren't enough Englishmen in OC to make it worth the while for most places. They do a happy hour on Sundays with pints around the $4.50 mark. Not bad at all. They do not, however, discount their appetizers during their Sunday HH. The food is ok. I liked the avocado egg rolls a lot. The avocado becomes very creamy and it comes with a sweet and sour sauce that goes very well. Their spinach artichoke dip is pretty good, but it's got a lot of cream cheese in it, almost to the point where it feels like filler. I hate, hate, hate the name 'pazookie'. Did a 7 year old come up with that name? Regardless, it's good. Cookies should be warm and covered with ice cream. I like that you can get three minis and mix and match. That was a fun way to try a few. Their cookies n cream was the best, being an Oreo based cookie. Their pizza still is not good. But, I hate deep dish pizza. I don't like eating a soggy pizza flavored, meat pie. If I want pizza, it should be crispy crust, whether thick or thin. Their menu is way, way too big. It's seriously a dozen pages. It's just tacky. Maybe if they had the bar and food menu separate it would be better, but I have to sit there and study a spiral bound menu for 15 minutes at the bar. I would say they have a 'little' of everything, but they kind of have a lot of everything. I can understand having a couple sandwiches, burgers, etc. Instead they have about 10 kinds of burgers, a dozen sandwiches, several steaks, multiple dinner salads, it's overwhelming and irritating for the customers. Service has been excellent here. The bar staff knows their beer and are friendly and prompt. One of the few places where they are good at letting the customer pace their meal, instead of either rushing them or disappearing for eternity. Their bar area is a little too crowded. The tables are stacked right next to each other with barely room to get in or out. I recommend sitting at the actual bar, if you are going to be in the bar area. Good, cheap beer and friendly service will keep me coming back. Overwhelming menu with average food will push me to other places, but keep BJs in the rotation."
Ryan D.,"Santa Ana, CA",205,2,,5.0,1/2/2015,"We had a birthday over the holidays here for 11 people at 930. When we arrived we had arguably the worst server. She took over 15 min to bring us our water as we saw her standing by the register talking to her coworkers. The restaurant at that time wasn't too busy so there was no reason for it. The wait on the food was normal and the food was good. However several of my friends did not even receive their food or their water. We decided to to talk to the manager Chuck to explain how terrible our waitress was. He apologized to us, asked if there was anything we needed, comped our food (minus alcohol), and saved this bjs trip for us. More than anything though he split (what was left of our) bill, something that she couldn't do. I mean she sees 11 21 year olds and straight up tells us 'no I can't split the bill for you guys'. In addition chuck also brought out spoons and have us a free party platter pizookie. Chuck, thank you for being a good manager and saving our birthday dinner."
Kevin S.,"Santa Monica, CA",1,22,1,4.0,2/12/2012,You always get the high level BJ's standards. I am never disappointed. MMMMM pizookies!!
Annie C.,"Newport Beach, CA",0,4,1,2.0,6/21/2012,I was just here last night and first off bad impression when the hostess called our name to be seated we were walking right behind her then she said oh actually we need to wait longer...our group was big it was hard for us to walk back out without blocking other people at the same time.  After we were seated we waited 20minutes just to have a waitress to order our drinks....maybe our waitress had a bad day but as customers we do not deserve to be a part of it. when she came back out with only 4waters (even we are a group of 9) one of my friend asked for one of them even though he had ordered a beer. another 20mins went by the waitress came out with our beers and one of my friend needed a water she told my friend who asked for water earlier that it was not his water and why was he drinking it...FOR WHAT I REMEMBERED FROM RESTAURANTS EXPERIENCES...ISNT IT NORMAL TO BE SERVED WITH A ROUND OF WATER NO MATTER WHAT YOU ORDER TO DRINK??? I do not recall giving any attitude or problems for the waitress but right after dinner I had a stomach ache... I wish the waitress im writing about can read this because that is why you do not deserve our full 18% tips.
Howard R.,"Corona, CA",9,107,53,2.0,8/7/2011,"Crowds, staff is not very friendly and too focused on the tasks at hand to give you good service.  After three times finding lipstick on my glass when I received a drink...AND the third one was AFTER I told the manager about it, I stopped going here unless friends demand it.  Lazy Dog (across the parking lot) is better, cleaner, and customer service is better."
Jesse G.,"Ajo, AZ",56,158,9,4.0,6/10/2012,Awesome food and excellent beer! Their Tatonka Stout is the shit.
R. P.,"Orange, CA",0,1,,1.0,6/9/2012,"Once was enough!  For $85 you've got to do more than serve good food; in the hospitality business atmosphere is key. If guests are treated well, a decent meal can be elevated to fantastic. Conversely, indifference can cause an over-all great meal to be demoted to unpleasant.  Our family of five went for an early Thursday evening dinner to celebrate a birthday. Although the wait staff loitering at the entrance watched us walk in, no one greeted us. Shortly after arriving, we were seated at a booth so small we had no elbow room. We sat near the doors that lead to the outdoor eating area where wait staff congregated regularly to wipe sweat off their brows and clog the doorway. Our waitress was efficient but certainly not friendly. Our reviews of the food: ENLIGHTENED™ THAI CHICKEN MANGO SALAD - awful. Not a piece of mango in sight and the lettuce was unappetizingly wilted. BREWHOUSE DOUBLE DELUXE BURGER - delicious. CHICKEN FETTUCCINI ALFREDO - especially tasty. SCAMPI PASTA - very good, lots of shrimp. CRISPY CHICKEN SANDWICH - well liked. Pazookie - scrumptious."
Zack P.,"Tustin, CA",217,14,2,4.0,11/21/2011,"Love BJs and this location is no different.  I come here for their deepdish pizza and great variety of drinks and I always leave very satisfied.  It's an awesome place for birthdays, it can manage large groups, or just a few happy hour drinks.  And if you have room after a delicious dinner, their pazookies are awesome."
S L.,"Los Angeles, CA",28,173,,3.0,1/8/2012,The sampler isn't too bad! Good amount of alcohol with good tasting beer.
