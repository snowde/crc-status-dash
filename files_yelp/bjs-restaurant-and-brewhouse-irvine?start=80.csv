Nicole E.,"Irvine, CA",18,80,86,5.0,8/14/2017,"Ok BJ's you have pleasantly surprised me with your brunch. Everyone knows them for their infamous pazookie's, but I never thought they would have a great brunch. I came here at 10:15am this past Sunday and granted it was a ghost town because they had just opened. It definitely worked out in our favor because service was fast and ON POINT, kudos to the Sunday morning team! Mimosa's only 4 bucks, amazing and a majority of their breakfast dishes weren't priced higher then $10 bucks which was also a pleasant surprise. So pricing was a total win and the food was delicious! I had the breakfast tacos and they were just perfect!! Not too much, but not too small, just right! BJS you made me fan :)"
Claudia Z.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",154,374,200,2.0,12/12/2016,"The food here was quite good, this poor rating is a reflection of poor service from a particular waitress.  We came in for a late lunch and was promptly greeted and seated right away, good start. As soon as menus were handed to us, the waitress asks ""can I get you something to start? maybe a calamari?""... um, literally just handed me the menu, I haven't even opened it yet... so I said we need a few minutes, just waters for now. I don't know if she took offense to that or something, but from then on service was SLOW as heck! The kicker was that she brought us the bill before our dessert even arrived!! I'm okay if they leave the bill and say ""take your time"" while I'm still eating my last dish, but asking me to pay BEFORE I even got my last dish, that's just rude, and a sure fire way to cut tips in half. At least the food was decent, otherwise I'd have not tipped at all."
Jonathan D.,"Irvine, CA",715,300,2014,5.0,1/25/2017,I'm really glad there's a BJ's locally. There's plenty of parking which I really like. Location is really big and is walking into large parties. Open late which is a huge plus for those days would you end up working late and still want to grab something delicious. When you come here you can never go wrong with the deep dish pizza or the Parmesan chicken. This location like all BJ's locations gets five stars from me!
Anisa L.,"Tustin, CA",134,2,,1.0,6/26/2017,"Thanks BJs for the worst experience of my life. This past weekend I went to go eat there , they walk us to our booth and while I was looking through the menu a big cockroach was crawling up my foot! I jump up from the table ask to speak to a manager. By the time the manager got there she step on it and took us to a new booth . By that time I was already sick to my stomach. When I look up they had already put a new couple in that same booth to eat....that wasn't the worst part the worst part was that they never clean up that area and left the cockroach there never cleanup! So gross! Never going to bjs again . That whole restaurant needs to been cleaned food was everywhere on the floor."
Erica L.,"Irvine, CA",0,3,,4.0,11/17/2017,"This place is one of our fav spots! Their cherry salmon plate is delicious, it's usually what I get when we dine here. Their pizzas are delicious too. Most of the time the wait is long but worth it! Their churro limited time pizookie was so good!"
Melissa P.,"Oceanside, CA",126,4,,5.0,5/3/2017,Erin C. was our server and she was awesome!! We were a party of 25 and all needed separate checks. She handled it! Very friendly and was very accommodating and patient.  10/10
Al Y.,"Irvine, CA",17,4,2,1.0,5/14/2016,"USE CAUTION,  I GOT SICK EATING AT THIS RESTAURANT!! I made a complaint to the manager about the quality of the chicken being low on a previous visit. I ordered boneless wings and was given breaded RAW CHICKEN!! I sent them an email as a health concern so others don't get sick.  I sent them pictures. I called the next day in the middle of a solid boit of food poisoning trips to the restroom and was told the manager I sent the email to was off sick,  and the on duty manager was just too busy to speak to me. Concerned for public health, I drove to the restaurant ill to speak with the manager   I was told the manager was too busy talking to a customer on the phone! I informed him of what happened, and showed him the pictures."
Elana R.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",247,42,19,5.0,8/16/2017,Wow!!  This BJs is definitely one of my favorite!!!  Our waiter tonight is so on point. Truly one of the best waiters I have ever had!! Thank you Nick for getting our complicated/not so complicated order right!!  When you come here you know the food is always great and normally the waiters/waitresses are too!! But I have to say this waiter Nick tonight seriously is one of the best waiters I have had the pleasure to be waited on by.
Albert W.,"Orange, CA",701,1823,60,4.0,12/24/2016,People come here because it's an all around okay place for pizza and beer.  I'm not a big fan since I tend to like mom and pop but I could do a lot worse.
Bev R.,"Upland, CA",0,4,,5.0,11/6/2017,"I decided to have a surprise party for my daughter at BJ's yesterday. Honestly, I can not imagine a better staff than the ones I met here.  The managers, Al, Maggie and Kaitlin went above and beyond to make this event run perfectly. They worked with whatever I requested and made it seem effortless. The wait staff took extraordinary care of us. Big parties are not easy to handle but BJ's did it perfectly!  Thanks for the great time!"
Sarah A.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",0,5,2,5.0,8/30/2017,"The happy hour is really great and within walking distance from our apartment. Ask for Bonnie, she is attentive and a very personable server. We have somehow become regulars here due to our close living accommodations and the late hours we keep. Tip your sever well and according to the bill before happy hour discounts! Don't be a cheapskate!!!!!!!!"
Matthew A.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",254,27,2,5.0,3/12/2017,Food is great. Restrooms are somewhat clean.  Awesome service. Jordan the waiter was the real MVP here. On top of everything.
Christine L.,"Los Angeles, CA",841,521,1386,5.0,12/17/2016,Gluten Free Pazzookie!?!?!?!?!?!? Life changing! I must eat here again and again!!!! Super gluten free friendly options. Nice service. Comfortable atmosphere. Stays open pretty late.
Brian B.,"Orange, CA",7,25,1,1.0,9/9/2017,I'm not crazy about the greasy pizza they sell here but the other food is marginal at best but once in a while I have to come for the pozookie. It is awesome. However be prepared for consistently poor service especially at this location. I live across the street so it's close but it's worth the drive somewhere else just due to the crappy service and dirty tables!
Kiki H.,"Lake Forest, CA",6,26,4,5.0,8/3/2017,"I eat at BJs all the time all over because I love the food, always have great service, and pricing is affordable but today I had such an amazing experience with my waitress Andrea. She was so friendly, fast, attentive. I didn't have to ask twice for anything. I would come back in this location to have another experience with her."
Joseph J.,"Garden Grove, CA",24,32,1741,5.0,7/5/2016,"I've had Chicago Deep Dish from Chicago and I like BJ's pizza more. It just tastes better. The crust is more buttery. Blasphemy you say? Perhaps, but people always interpret the bible differently. Whatever floats your boat. I am not a purist. I just want something that tastes good to me!  I love their pizookie. A thousand calories of fun!  Is there anything special from other BJ's? If there is I don't see it but that shouldn't bother anyone. You go to a franchised restaurant for consistency and knowing what you want and expecting it.  Come to think of it, if there is anything special it might be the patio. It does have a beautiful view of the vegetation. That is all. Over and out."
Kayla Q.,"Irvine, CA",99,266,203,3.0,10/19/2016,"Pretty good spot. Ive always enjoyed BJ's food and this location is no different. Their queso as an appetizer is awesome. I got a chicken Asian salad that was decent, but nothing fantastic. The people I was with all really loved what they got- the jalapeno burger, grilled ham and cheese sandwich, and turkey avocado club. We didn't get a pizookie this time, but those never disappoint! My only complaint was the service was very slow and it took quite some time to get our food."
Matt K.,"Irvine, CA",12,261,416,4.0,10/6/2015,"BJ's has a really cool vibe, I especially like the bar area.  There are high top tables, bar seating, but also booth seating within the bar area.  I put my name down for a regular table in the dining area for Thursday Night Football, but while waiting I was able to snag a bar booth instead.  It's a great atmosphere and you get waited on just like you are in the dining area, but you get the noise and fun of the bar.   They serve regular American fare such as wings, burgers, pizzas.  I think their deep dish pizzas are just ok, it's nothing like Chicago deep dishes, the bread is thick, but it's pretty full of air.  Not a dense tasty deep dish.  But the other dishes I really enjoyed like their wings and salad.  They have great quantity as well so you will be full. They are also famous for their pizookie desserts.  It's a mini-pizza pan, but filled with cookie and topped with ice cream.  I would definitely try this, it's good to share and it's really tasty and well cooked. Service was really nice and we were even alerted of happy hour deals when we didn't know it was even happy hour time!  Happy with the portions and taste of most items, the deep dish pizza could improve, but I still like the experience you get at a BJ's.  Their craft beers are great too."
Bill B.,"Irvine, CA",3,3,,3.0,10/20/2016,"I don't like this place very much.  The only item on the menu that doesn't make me nauseous is Caeser Salad. The fries or chicken tenders or rather anything that is fried seems like it swam in grease and then was squeezed to death.  My wife likes the Balsamic Glazed chicken and to be honest I can't even get on board with that.  I can cook better at home and given the option of BJs or eat at home, I would rather starve.  I give stars for service and se"
Stacey H.,"Irvine, CA",81,210,13,1.0,10/28/2016,"Food was poor (and only sort of warm) and service has been awful both visits. Servers stand around the computers right next to the booths complaining and arguing.  Will not be back, too many better choices in the area."
