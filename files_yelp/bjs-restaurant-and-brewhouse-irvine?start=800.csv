Cody L.,"Irvine, CA",0,13,,3.0,12/18/2013,Neat place for some drinks and pizza afterwork. They got a fully stocked bar. Wait staff is friendly and attentive but their menu is exhaustive. Takes forever to get cover to cover. I got the balsamic chicken. That was actually really good. Don't forget to end your meal with a macadamia nut pizooki.
Brian B.,"Santa Ana, CA",15,11,,2.0,9/22/2013,"stopped by here for lunch on a saturday (13/09/21). greeted at hostess counter by what appeared to be a manger. he asked how many, we said two, then he directed us to a girl who would seat us. neither asked if we would prefer indoor or outdoor seating. the girl lead us outside, past many open indoor tables. neither of us is a fan of eating outside, but the weather was decent so we settled for the outdoor tables rather than make a fuss. we noticed almost immediately a very sour smell in the air that we determined must have been sewage. it remained throughout the entire meal. we also spotted trash on the floor. we were greeted within a decent amount of time by our server who was very nice, however when my girlfriend asked for the available soups our server was unsure and listed them with no certainty - telling her the soup of the day was broccoli something. when my girlfriend had a follow-up question about the soup/salad combo our server didn't know and actually resorted to taking my girlfriend's menu (i guess assuming my girlfriend had not bothered to look at it herself before deciding to ask the question) to research the answer and ultimately did not find or provide one. while researching she did note that the soup of the day was in fact chicken noodle and that my girlfriend's menu was missing a page. we ordered a water & salad and a club sandwich & iced tea. food was good. the tea tasted funky. not bad really, just strange like it was made in an unclean container with remnants of a previous batch of who-knows-what. it did not taste like regular iced tea should taste. while we waited for our food i felt something on my arm. i lifted my arm and found a small spider dangling from a web on my elbow. i flicked it away. our food came out very quickly which was nice. during our meal though we were annoyed by a persistent fly. with no screens around the outdoor area and with the stench of sewage  in the air the only surprise here is that we only had to deal with one. both of us decided we just wanted to leave and when our server came to check on us we asked for our check. that was the last time we saw her. we immediately put our card with the bill and waited (and waited) for it to be picked up. finally, a server for a nearby table, who i'm assuming saw we were waiting, came over and handled our bill and brought a box for our leftovers. admittedly, we probably should've just requested to sit inside from the beginning, but we feel these problems are problems regardless. we've eaten at BJs many times but this was an exceptionally bad experience. we will not be coming back any time soon."
Ivan L.,"Santa Ana, CA",407,411,30,4.0,6/22/2011,Not bad! It's a chain and great everyonce in a while.... I feel like I gain 5lbs whenever I eat here though.... the beer pretty awesome so I give it 4 stars..... my favorite being the NIT WIT and its in season woot woot.... don't sleep on this flavor
An L.,"Anaheim, CA",45,15,1,5.0,10/28/2011,"I drink at BJ's too much. They have great berry cider. I only like berry cider from BJ's and The Studio Buffet(Las Vegas's M Resort buffet). I've tried others, but I can't find a better cider. They have a new red velvet pizookie now that tastes pretty good. This review will be exactly the same as the one in HB because I was there 3 days in a row."
Mr B.,"Orange, CA",2,96,57,4.0,8/17/2013,Four stars for the late night happy hour. 2 1/2 for everything else. BJ's used to be really good 15-20 years ago but now they are just another huge generic chain that does everything ok and nothing well. The late night Happy Hour is good though. Five bucks for a pizza and cheap pints. The Tatonka Stout and Jeremiah Red are pretty good. Not quite up to micro brew standard but way better than the mass produced stuff served by most big chains. Be prepared for mediocre food and an extremely long wait if you go on a Friday or Saturday night. (1 - 2 hour wait is norm)
Jennifer B.,"Costa Mesa, CA",229,42,6,4.0,8/3/2011,"This is a local Irvine hangout, the waiters and waitresses are very nice. They have very good drinks."
Amy K.,"Irvine, CA",121,337,2,2.0,9/27/2008,"It's really a hit or miss with this BJs.  Thing I love about BJs are they 1) pizookies (who doesn't love ice cream off a steaming freshly baked cookie?) and 2) the variety on their menu. The food at this particular location is sometimes great, and other times just OK.  One item that is always good is their clam chowder...the half sandwich w/soup combination is generally a safe choice.  Their pizza can be a hit or miss. Their service, however, is usually on the poorer side.  Also, expect at least a 20 min. - hour wait about 90% of the time."
Suzanne M.,"Kapolei, HI",152,156,142,4.0,6/11/2011,HH brings in the crowd.  It is a fun place and the prices are great for the food and drink.  I like the flatbread pizzas.  Though I try to change it up and try something new.  Go early for best seating.The bartender is helpful and I think he liked my daughter so he was very attentive!
H L.,"Irvine, CA",13,53,3,4.0,7/13/2009,"I generally avoid chain restaurants, but when my family goes out, this is the only place we can agree upon.  The pizzas are great--they let you order half and half for one pie--half of us are vegetarians, so we get the delicious spinach and artichoke pizza.  The newish Thai lettuce wrap appetizer is great, and always save room for a pizookie.  Best beer: Jeremiah Red  Favorite non-pizza dish: Santa Fe Salad without tortilla strips  The service is usually always friendly, and they do a good job offering recommendations"
Austin S.,"Kansas City, MO",503,732,94,4.0,7/13/2008,"I came to this location the other day, probably for the last time (because I just moved from Irvine back home to Pasadena and my 2 friends from my old church small group who are the only ones I really still talk to wanted to meet up to say ""goodbye"") We came for happy hour and more times than not, we always come for happy hour.  Though sometimes getting a table can be tricky since the bar area is first come first serve and we always try to grab a booth.  This time though, we were lucky that an elderly couple was just getting up, so we waited only a quick couple of minutes. I'm not much of a beer drinker, but the far and few in between times I do decide to get beer, I typically go for Hefs with a lemon wedge. I also got a small size pizza with sausage, chicken, and mushrooms. The service here is typically pretty good, especially in the bar area.  I think maybe once the server was a little slow, but whatever. Our server this time was funny because at one point, all three of us were messing around on our blackberrys and when she came up and saw us, she started commenting on how she just got one and just absolutely loves it and continued to make other comments a couple more trips after that.  Plus she also went along when we were razzing each other about this and that.  I just like it when the server seems like they're really chill and enjoys being there as opposed to just doing their job."
Maganism M.,"Pico Rivera, CA",5,78,15,1.0,12/22/2012,"Was put on hold, after I asked the staff to check for an item  that i left at the store.  The wait was about 18 minutes, and only to be asked by another staff why i was put on hold... highly disappointing"
Gee M.,"Cypress, CA",0,25,,3.0,12/17/2013,Best pizza you can get. The pazooki is AMAZING!!! Service always seems to be just OK. Not sure why but seems to be the standard there. They seem to be slow always.
Jackie O.,"Austin, TX",0,24,8,2.0,3/2/2013,"I went to this BJ's with some family from out of town when I was 8 months pregnant. The place was packed and we waited maybe 10 minutes for a seat... No problem. We got seated and had a middle aged male waiter. Everyone ordered their alcohol, then it was my turn. What I like about BJ's is that they have fufu (non-alcoholic) beverages with refills. So I order some fufu flavored lemonade and as we chatted away, 4 of the 6 dinners come to the table. 10 minutes later the remaining meals arrive. At this point my drink is empty and as my husband is ordering another beer he tells the waiter that I need a refill as well. The waiter looks at us and in a rather annoyed tone says ""you're going to have to pay for the refill!"" I protest that their menu states that my drink has free refills and the waiter stares at us with a look of annoyance as my husband says ok to the charge for the refill. Of course as we were leaving the kids that work the hostess stand were too busy to discuss the charge. It wasn't about the additional $3 or $4 for the refill, it was his horrible attitude all together. Needless to say we have not gone back. Ill go to the BJs in Temecula where the waiters are human and know their menu! Call papa johns if you want pizza, don't waste your time here!"
Troy H.,"Huntington Beach, CA",1041,827,183,2.0,6/30/2008,"Decided to give this place another try.  1st time: Chicken and ribs combo really sucked. Took 3-4 year hiatus before I came back.  2nd time: Service was horrible. Met a friend and her kids here. Took forever to get my damn beer. Took even longer to get the desserts. I even ordered them during dinner, and they came way after everyone was finished with their food!!! 3rd time: Tonight, the pizza was decent. Cooked fairly well. The chicken wings were fair. But again, the service sucked. Don't know what the big deal at this place is......."
Gary Royale T.,"Orange, CA",990,346,107,5.0,1/9/2009,"I have to disagree with one of the reviewers on here about the Pizookie. It is a brilliant idea to add fatty chocolate chip cookie thats the size of a pizza with 5 kinds of fatty ice cream. The guy that invented it deserves mad props, and pregnant women all over love it! I have reviewed BJ's before, you can find my opinions about the food here:  As far as this particular location, I did notice that they have more lunch time specials then other locations. They also offer a 5 for 1 free lunch card as well. On a side note,  some of the waitresses look great from behind in those tight black slacks. Needless to say, I tipped very generously when I am provided with a great view."
Suzie W.,"Irvine, CA",81,30,15,4.0,7/11/2011,"Surprisingly, this place was pretty kid-friendly (first visit with 3-year old). The pizza was good, considering it's not NY style or Chicago style. The mini Pizookie was a wicked good treat after being already pretty stuffed after wine, salad and pizza. Saw gluten free pizza on the menu - will have to come back for a try."
Silver L.,"Orange County, CA",0,6,,4.0,2/3/2009,"Their pizookie is a must have. Every now and then I have sudden cravings for it... For those of you who don't know what a pizookie is.. it's a big big warm cookie topped with like two or three scoops of ice cream.. seriously it's a genius dessert.  Their shrimp scampi is also superb... all the flavors that they put into it blend well. I got full off the shrimp scampi (but I still managed to eat pizookie.. of course) because the portions for it could easily serve two people.  My boyfriend ordered the make it yourself pizza which was really good. The bread they use for the it is super soft and warm.. mmmm.. It comes out in a hot iron/steel(?) pan so it stays warm..  Service was good, no complaints. I usually get a guy server every time I go coincidentally... and they tend to be really funny and nice."
Marti C.,"Canton, OH",48,232,89,3.0,3/25/2011,"When you go to Bjs you should really stick to the tried and true. Usually I get a pizza. The crust is buttery deliciousness and  it's thick and savory. I think over the years I have tried every version of pizza and they are all good. And the perfect end to every meal at BJs the pazookie - my fave is the peanut butter it is melt-in-your-mouth fantastic. Went last night and decided to off roading and ordered the pot roast sandwich with white cheddar mashed potatoes and oven-roasted vegetables. Yea. Mistake. It wasn't awful it just wasn't as delicious as the pizza. The white cheddar potatoes didn't even taste like potatoes all you could taste was the cheese. They were too heavy and overpowered by the cheese. I rated the potatoes first because that is what was most plentiful on the plate. Next came the vegetables: onion, carrorts and celery. They were only lukewarm and still hard. Hardly oven roasted. They were drenched in the brown gravy for the meat that was surely out of a can. Again not unedible just not uber tasty. Finally the meat, for a second I wondered if it it too came out of a can. Maybe the meat and gravy came together, not sure. When I think pot roast I think melt in your mouth meat that comes in big hunks that just falls apart. Well this was in like strips of preformed meat or something. I don't know. Again it was edible for the most part. I left more than half of it on my plate. The service at this particular location is always sketchy. Our hostess definitely thought she was the mostess, but she was not. All attitude, not fun. Our waiter was nice just sparse. He was more interested in flirting with girls at another table.  I gave this trip a 3 based on my memories of the pizza and pazookie."
Edgar ..,"Tustin, CA",3,5,1,4.0,1/19/2014,BJs annual Grand Cru gets two thumbs up and I highly recommend it to all beer enthusiasts.
Shirleystyleshair H.,"Irvine, CA",184,6,76,4.0,7/28/2013,"this restaurant is always hopping great food,the triple chocolate pizookie is to die for and the best beer ever."
