Stephanie L.,"Irvine, CA",57,193,2,4.0,3/17/2011,BJ's specializes in two things: beer and pizza.  I'm happy to say they succeed in both.  Nothing is more disappointing than when a restaurant can't live up to what it claims to be good at.  I come to BJ's during two times of the day: during happy hour and late night happy hour.  They have great specials on their beer and appetizers.  A bonus is when you come on Tuesday and their bottles of wine are half off.  Gotta love a place that's open late with good beer and pizza.
Heather G.,"Indio, CA",14,34,9,3.0,6/18/2012,"Bj pizza lovers beware! Stand up and raise your voices! I will start by saying that my star value on food would have been a 1 but when you factor in service from both the management and our waitress I gave BJs a 3. My husband and I love this chain and frequent it often. Which can be hard since we do not have one within a 60 mile radius. Needless to say we enjoy the atmosphere, the service and the pizza. Sadly we might not be able to say this for much longer. Last night we arrived waited 45 mins for a table for 4 of us, normal for a Saturday night, and we were fine with it. But we were famished once our dinner arrived. The sweet pig pizza looks a little different than normal, dry to say it kindly. After one bite we were all immediately disappointed. And despite how hungry we were no one at more than one slice. The pizza had NO flavor, it was dry and fell apart when you bite into it. Not BJs style. It was so bad that I had to ask out waitress if something had changed. I was not complaining or sending it back that is not my style. I just wanted to know if I was off or the pizza was. I was even a little embarrassed when I asked her. Because really how could a pizza place change their signature dish to something as plain and unappetizing as what we were just served. But sadly I am right, BJs in the Tustin market place is testing a new 6min pizza. Yes I said 6 minutes and that's not a typo! It is a piss poor attempt to fool you the consumer into thinking you are getting a quality made to order pie, when in fact half of the pie is pre made before you even walk in the door! Dominos doesn't even do that! And may i mention Dominos tastes a hell of allot better than this new pizza and is half the price. So if you are eating at this BJs or any or for that matter and the pizza is off don't think the establishment is having an off night. Say something to the manager on duty or we we all loose the yummy pizza that made this chain so popular!  Or if you do not want to risk it simply call ahead and ask if they are serving the 6 minute pizza or their traditional recipe. That's what we are doing. Good luck!"
Jeannie C.,"Orange County, CA",53,175,42,4.0,9/5/2008,"I don't know what it is about Sliders, you know, mini burgers but BJ's has some really good minis. Today, I went to BJ's after work for happy hour with my girlfriend and I ordered the sliders, the cheese and tomato mini pizza and my friend ordered the chicken lettuce wrap. Yes..I love food and I was so hungry. I thought the sliders were perfectly executed. The Angus beef lies in between a soft, small, round bun with just the right amount of ketchup and of course, lettuce, tomatoes and pickles on the side. Gotta love them pickles with the sliders. The mini pizza is a small deep dish but it wasn't too doughy or was it too heavy, it was just right in my tummy. Although I thought the chicken lettuce wrap was decent, maybe cause I was hungry, my friend didn't think it was all that good. I mean you can't expect to eat authentic chicken lettuce wrap at a brewery, right? During Happy Hour, the appetizers are two dollars off and the mini pizzas are half off but keep in mind, this is only valid at the bar area  during the hours of 3PM - 7PM. I don't drink alchy so I didn't pay attention to the Happy Hour special. Sorry. I do recommend you should go there early to grab a table at the bar during happy hour, because it does get packed. My friend and I found two seats by the bar counter and we needed to constantly wave down for the bartender/waiter to come assist us."
Susan D.,"Irvine, CA",0,226,,3.0,10/19/2013,"A nice place to have lunch in the Market Place. The Tuscan Tomato Bisque is quite good and  you can have a refill which is nice.  The Brewhouse Blond Fish and Chips  could  have been  better. Someone mentioned that the BBQ Wings are great , so we might give it a try next time."
Mike O.,"Newport Beach, CA",21,19,10,4.0,4/16/2009,"score! I am a complete convert to this place...used to hate the ""micro"" brewed beers, but have since overcome any aversion to their tastes..or ""finish""... the piranha (sierra nevada), jeremiah Red (my favorite, thinkin' kona brewing co's firerock pale ale) and tatonka (guiness stout) are my fav's with a  ""hops"" content reminiscent that's not too over the top..well, close enough if you're on pints #4 and 5! so...we're cruisin' for some grinds, and nothing decent is open in OC at this hour, and definitely NOT on a weeknight...(I miss LA so much!!)...but we happen to be craving deep dish pizza and behold BJ's is open! oh, and the best part? 10pm til closing is ""happy hour"" again! (as in pricing)  cool staff and fairly packed even on a wednesday night - crowd's cool, and multiple flatty's beaming sports talk all over the room (killer!)...brews are flowing and the samplers and pizza's are apportioned just right, so you can keep consuming (brews) without getting full... ahh...eating and drinking after the dinner crowd is absolutely the way to go...that said, I can't remember eating, playing or consuming before 10pm anyway! :P"
J C.,"Irvine, CA",2154,428,10,3.0,12/16/2008,"I used to go here pretty often, but finally got sick of it.. The burgers are pretty good. The pizza is very good, I rank it higher than alot of other pizza chains. Some of the appetizers are bad, like the spinach dip - one of the worst Ive had.  Also the fries suck here.  The sliders are average - OK, and cheap for happy hour.  The pizookie is usually very good if cooked correctly.  Get the ice cream on the side, as it ruins it for me.   The new dark chocolate pizookie I didn't care for.   I've always wanted to try the party pizookie, but never had the balls to order it.  The price has increased as well over the years. The happy hour is the time to come.  I find the laguna hills location less busy.  This location sometimes you won't find a table available in the bar. With the economy in the crapper recently, it may be easier now.  The place is open pretty late, and my friends like the beer here. I haven't tried it.  Don't expect 5 star restaraunt service, although we usually have no problem getting stuff comped or replaced when we speak up."
Sharon C.,"Irvine, CA",114,175,,4.0,8/11/2008,"I, clearly, have no problem with chain restaurants.  Not even big ones.   The thing I love about BJs is... their pizza.  I LOVE their pizza.  Because toppings mean everything to me on a pizza.  At BJ's, anything more than... 5(?) toppings.. it cost the same!  So I pile it on.  I can end up with 10 toppings sometimes.  I'm generally not a fan of deep dish but theirs, I love. *mouth watering* It's packed on busy nights and it's loud and yada yada yada.  I don't care.  Love the pizza.  Will revisit."
Jonathan C.,"Irvine, CA",79,34,8,5.0,5/11/2011,get a seat in the bar area n get drunk!!  stay away from the outside patio (unless you want to re-enact the crowd noise at the sinking of the Titanic.... never let go Jack..
flo c.,"Irvine, CA",147,775,98,4.0,5/9/2008,"3 1/2 stars. 4 star for Happy Hour, 3 stars for normal hours. A bunch of us yesterday came after work or so. I'm not sure if there was a wait to get a table in the bar area, because I was a bit later than everyone else and they had already secured a table and started ordering. By sitting in the bar area (which has normal tables), we got to partake in the Happy Hour menu. I missed what the discounts were and all my co-workers could remember was that mini-sized deep dish pizzas were half-off and that mixed drinks were discounted.  The service is nice but spotty. BJ's was PACKED to the brim. They were actually people waiting the entire time we were there. Thus, it's a bit of a challenge to find/flag down a server. However, once you get one, they're quite nice and experienced.  I tried: -""What a Peach"": ABSOLUT VANILIA, Dekuyper Peach Pucker, BOLS Peach Schnapps, orange juice, pineapple juice, grenadine and a splash of Sierra Mist served on the rocks.  -Buffalo Chicken Mini Pizza: For Buffalo Chicken Wing lovers - diced celery, red onions and grilled chicken breast marinated in hot and spicy buffalo sauce, drizzled with ranch dressing. Served with extra ranch dressing for dipping. (Incidentally, I never got extra ranch dressing for dipping, not that I would've wanted it.) I really enjoyed both items. The drink was definitely fruity and light. If you aren't much of a drinker, that's a fabulous choice. I mostly tasted juice and nothing else. The served on the rocks thing was definitely true because there was A LOT of ice after I was done, and it wasn't because I drank it super fast. The pizza was good and not too spicy or heavy. I like deep dish pizza, so I could be biased. Final total:  The drink was a dollar off. The pizza was half priced.  With tax, it was a little over $12 total. In the past, I've also had a friend celebrate a birthday here and rented out the patio area. There's a set menu, buffet style, that you can order from with pasta, pizza, etc. That wasn't bad, but it wasn't really exciting. It is AYCE (I think) and for the price, it was pretty good for AYCE."
Jack H.,"Orange, CA",1,2,,4.0,12/16/2014,love the pizza! service is always great! never been let down here... i know theres a wait but its always worth it!
Vanessa L.,"Anaheim, CA",703,683,59,1.0,4/6/2008,"The food at chain restaurants are usually uniform.  This is a review of the service.  The service was horrible the evening that I came.  Granted it was a party of 14 on a Friday evening and maybe our server had a hard time dealing with a large crowd.  But I was really disappointed; our server forgot orders and would come out with three drinks in his hands and ask someone from our table to get up and grab a drink out of his hand and serve it to our table.  At that point, he could have opted not to carry so many drinks. He forgot our orders. He had our table waiting a ridiculously long time.  Our bill came out with a mandatory 17% gratuity charge.  Our table split the order and I paid by credit card and he added an additional 17% gratuity on my credit card charge.  I asked him if he could do anything about it and he said no. He did this with the other two persons paying by credit card also.  I am not surprised to hear that other yelpers have had problems with their bills here. I am not returning here ever again."
David S.,"Santa Ana, CA",164,33,,4.0,11/14/2013,"I've come here quite a few times with different circles of friends and I've never had a bad experience. Their beers haven't really stood out to me but the menu is huge! I actually like having a big menu, some people might not, but I really like the huge selection of food they seem to have. When I've gone there I've gotten their Calzones and their personal pizzas and like I said they've been perfect every time. The dessert ""the pazookie"" is amazing my friend and I usually get it every time we go there... Assuming we have room after our dinner. I've also tried their pasta and it's been perfectly fine as well. The waters/waitresses have always been pleasant... I think I may have had one time where one wasn't all that attentive but for the most part it's been perfect. It seems to get pretty crowded at night so sound may be an issue but it's never really been a big enough issue for me not to enjoy going there with friends."
Rebecca C.,"Orange, CA",11,5,3,1.0,8/31/2011,"I went here last night with my girlfriend and we both woke up with food poisoning! To make matters worse, she's a nursing mom and her baby is sick now too! STAY AWAY."
Kari P.,"Valley Village, Los Angeles, CA",81,46,2,3.0,4/10/2008,"Why do I bother? Oh wait I remember why, becuase you are centrally located in between all my friends! Pretty much that's it. Okay so I will give Bj's kudos for taking my reservation for a large party and actually having a table ready for us when we got there. That was cool, rarely has that ever been the case anywhere I have gone. I thought it would be fun to go to Bj's with 11 lesbians (and 1 straight girl) because who doesn't love the name Bj's more than lesbians...oh the irony of it all. The waiters were quick. I'll give them that. Although one friend arrived late and never got her drink. She was charged and the waiter took it off of her bill but no apology. (I think he figured that for parties over 10 he is getting an automatic 17% gratuity anyways as is written in the policy) A little hint buddy you would have gotten an extra $20 but what ev...    The food, always subpar. No one ever really finds what they want on this menu, yet no one ever finds anything that makes them yak either. Mediocre for sure. I did have the pizza last night and you know what!!!!....It still wasn't good. I managed to get two pieces in the 'ol gullet anyway. Probably just because I had lubed the eating tube with two berry burst ciders first. Now that is one reason to visit this establishment.  So over all. Ok service, Ok food, Great Looking table of hott lesbians...for that Bj's you get 3 stars."
Arthur W.,"Northridge, CA",55,59,15,4.0,1/16/2011,"I love coming here to this bj's. I think this one is more open. Although during the very hot and cold weather, i wouldn't suggest sitting outside. The atmosphere isn't that great and I am very sorry to say but the service is slower than inside. Yet, we have had really good service while being inside. The only problem we had is when they are busy, they do tend to forget things. It was my birthday that day, and i guess my brother reminded our waiter 3 times about my birthday that day, which isn't much of a concern to me, the food was great. i was already planning to order a pizaookie anyways.. but my bro had told me he had to tell other waiters about my birthday and then when they did get it, they brought it to few wrong tables, and yeah. But, Bj's food is good.. i enjoy eating the filet with the 2 choices of sides. or rigatoni with chicken (my favorite dish amongst)...and of course we always have a bbq chicken pizza large as an appetizer.. bbq chicken pizza flavor is very good. it has sweet onions which makes the pizza sweet in flavour.. and has tomatoes.. like big tomatoes that you can see on it.. so as to food,.. they are vey consistent on detail and taste.  I'd wish for the chicken rigatoni.. they have an option to add more rigatoni noodles... instead of me having to order 2 dishes.. lol.. or 1 dinner and 1 lunch dish.. oh well.. thats about it.. !"
Jonathan Z.,"Cypress, CA",595,1179,1175,4.0,9/11/2008,"Good eats is good wherever you find it.  Bj's is a chain, but who cares.  It has some great tasting food.  Have a great greasy pizza and cold beer.  Gluttony at it's best."
Theresa F.,"Tustin, CA",1,20,1,4.0,10/8/2011,"Fun atmosphere, great food. The pizza is pricey but so worth it. It's the closest we have to east coast style."
Rod M.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,5,,1.0,7/22/2013,Unprofessional employees. Caught the server taking about our party to her fellow employees on how she was giving us attitude. Never coming to this location again.
Yralla L.,"Orange County, CA",10,373,,3.0,5/29/2010,"My favorite item to eat at BJ's is the artichoke dip.  I also like their selection of beers.  I have had their soups, salads, burgers, and pizzas.  They have all been okay.  The soups are usually too salty.  The salads are okay.  I found a gnarly pubic-like hair in my cobb salad and that made me want to barf.  Yuck.  The burgers are okay.  I am not a big fan of the deep dish pizza.  It is too greasy and too bready.  I forgot to mention that the pizookie is the bomb.  The food at Karl Strauss and Yard House taste so much better."
Twelve J.,"Anaheim, CA",75,29,7,4.0,3/26/2011,"this location is always busy in the evenings and on the weekends.  the bartenders were attentive and took our order even though we were standing. there were lots of servers, hosts and bus boys  wait for the table was about 30-40 minutes. service was prompt and food came out pretty quick since we only ordered a few appetizers.  pulled pork sliders (4) with thin fries. awesome. even good the next morning! avocado egg rolls with some sweet dipping sauce. they have a slight tang and the mix of textures makes every bite a little different. ordered the new ahi poke, the tuna looked fresh and thick. cubed pieces served on some lettuce with fried wontons. not too soggy but not as scrumptious as a sushi place. had some beers and appetizers with friends on a friday afternoon for about 2 hours. didn't feel rushed even with the crowds."
