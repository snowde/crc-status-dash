Christine J.,"Tulsa, OK",30,205,27,2.0,6/17/2008,"OATMEAL RAISIN PIZOOKIE. Get it to go because it's usually crowded. Other than that, the food is barf, barf, barf, barf, barf, and barf. The end."
J P.,"Tustin, CA",7,22,3,4.0,4/19/2010,"no cork fee!! bring your own wine!!  the mediterranean pizza is bomb but the salads are a rip off. seriously, the slalds are a bit on the ""wee-man"" side i would reccomend this resteraunt If you are trying to impress a girl by taking her here instead of your regular dive bar."
Ryan L.,"Irvine, CA",23,36,,4.0,3/3/2011,"Great beers, great pizza, great pizookies . good atmosphere. This place has it all, just go and splurge on hearty food, lifes to short not to enjoy it! :)"
Pete M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,46,1,5.0,4/19/2013,"Wife and I went here for lunch after a long bike ride through the canyon. Place was packed but we were given a booth near the bar immediately.  I had a burger with side salad and a nice red ale. Wife had a black and blue flatbread and salad combo with iced tea. Food was good and hit the spot.  Beer was a recommendation from our waiter and went very well with my meal.  We both agree this is a keeper and would order our meals again.  The whole lunch was $24 and sooo much better than some of the numerous fast food joints in the area.  No plastic chairs, fouresent lights or ordering from the counter.  Everyone was really nice from greeters, to the runners and especially our waiter Ryan C.  Keep up the good work... We'll be back!"
Judy B.,"Lake Forest, CA",0,10,,1.0,8/29/2013,"I went there because my friend said they had great food. Well maybe, but mine wasn't. I ordered a medium done cheeseburger-how can you mess that up? Well, it came  with no sauce (thousand Island) so I had to find a waitress and send it back, then it came back and of course it was cold and the meat was dry and well done-fries were cold too-yuck-waste of $12."
Jason P.,"Irvine, CA",0,2,,3.0,8/25/2013,"At BJ's you pretty much know what you're going to get.  Corporate style brewery with decent food and pretty good service standards.  Servers tend to be hit and miss but you can tell that the effort is there.  On the last few visits the host stand seems to be the biggest opportunity in the restaurant.  It is definitely a difficult area to manage especially with long waits, but hospitality needs to improve.  They need a little coaching on being friendly, smiling, and treating guests with respect instead of like a heard of cattle."
Dave S.,"South Pasadena, Los Angeles, CA",357,247,11,4.0,11/6/2007,"This is one of the nicest BJ's I've ever been in. I was only here one other time when it was ridiculously crowded, but last night we came after a gorgefest (i'm really into ""fests"" for some reason today) at Honda Ya and it was barren and quiet. I like it much better that way as I'm not a big fan of crowds. at sports bars. ever.  We had come down for one thing and one thing only: Pizookie. For those that don't know what a pizookie is it's a personal pan pizza sized fresh baked cookie that's left in the pan and then topped with three scoops of vanilla bean ice cream. So simple, yet so good. I had the peanut butter cookie, I highly recommend it. So yeah.. four stars for this experience.. good idea, Frank."
Deborah H.,"Medford, MA",0,21,,4.0,8/20/2013,"Solid food, great selection of drinks, and satisfactory service.  I've also held a small event here and all the catering went very smoothly.  Everyone was a pleasure to work with and the food was very reasonably priced."
Cali F.,"Manhattan, NY",0,29,,2.0,8/18/2013,"Hope this gets management's attention - I've been to BJs once every few weeks since it opened with my family and was always happy with the service and food. However, the past few months, especially the last 2 times, have been disappointing in terms of service. It takes way too long to get our food and the restaurant is not even half full. The food still tastes great but waiting over 15 minutes for lunch is not acceptable. Last month, the manager at the time realized the problem and gave us one lunch free. Last time, my son finished his soup and salad before the rest of us got our lunches (just sandwiches and salads). BJs Management - please fix!"
S R.,"Irvine, CA",10,195,88,2.0,10/6/2010,This was pretty bad. All the beers I tried tasted stale and the food was overpriced and tasteless. Service was pretty mediocre as well.
Raymond S.,"Irvine, CA",337,192,30,4.0,10/17/2006,"BJ's has become the obvious first choice when it comes to planning a get-together dinner party/event...or if you really crave Chicago-style pizza.  Why?  There's so many reasons.  The food; the location; the hours; the good times...oh what the hell, who are we kidding here?  It's the alcohol!  Seriously though, BJ's is all about great food and having a good time there while at it.  It's no surprise the stars of the place are their Chicago-style deep dish pizzas and their wide selection of inhouse brews.    The Tustin location is especially large and classy looking, making it the ideal location to host large parties for any sort of occasion or just to hang out during playoff times.  There's huge TV screens at the bar to watch all the latest sports playing.  Just be prepared to arrive early as this place gets crowded on most week nights, especially the weekends.  Service has been good for the countless times that I have been here.  With larger parties that are out in the patio, service can be on the slow side occasionally.  Your mileage may vary.  The food is great.  While nothing particular stands out as the greatest or the best, BJ's does serve pretty good meals that will fulfill your hunger.  Their signature Chicago-style deep dish pies is one big reason to come here and a definite must if you're a first timer.  Their pizzas are as thick as they are tasty - that's how Chicagoans roll.  I especially like the barbeque chicken pizza and blackened chicken.  But even the plain tomato and cheese will hit the spot.  If pizza ain't your thang, then there's the pasta and sandwiches.  I can't really comment on these as I almost always get the pizza when I'm here, but the pastas are quite filling and large.  Pizzas can range anywhere from $9-20 depending on size.  Of particular note: I wasn't too satisfied with their buffalo wings.  It lacked that spicy punch to it but still decent.  Then there's the brews.  A half dozen selections of house beers, hefs and dark ales.  All pretty good but I mainly come here with friends for the ciders.  The berry burst cider is amazing as it's sweet and tangy yet strong without you knowing it.  We order at least a pitcher or 2 of this stuff and then it's all over for us... The cider is so popular, on two occasions they were sold out so we opted for pear cider instead which is equally as good.  Finally, there's dessert.  You can't end the night at BJ's without some pizookie ($4.95).  It's so good, it's deadly.  Literally.  Even though it's really just a big warm and chewy cookie topped with ice cream, one has to wonder just how much sugar they jack into these things cause it's just insanely uber sweet.  I'm sure these babies will make one diabetic in no time.  It's almost ridiculous!...but mmm...so good!  a love/hate thing, indeed.  But maybe the reason BJ's is so popular is that they open late every night till around midnight.  That makes it a good hangout spot late into the night when hunger strikes or for just when you want to eat with your buddies.  Whatever the reason, it's good times fo sho."
Brian L.,"Placentia, CA",0,11,,3.0,8/9/2013,"Giving three because today was an aberration, but today was some of the worst service I've ever had anywhere. We were ignored the first 20 minutes after seating and it took forever to get refills on drinks or anything else we needed.  To be fair the waitress was clearly a trainee but her trainer did nothing to correct the horrible service we were getting.  Food was good as always."
Rachelle L.,"Irvine, CA",81,25,1,1.0,5/18/2010,"I've been to this BJ's plenty of times. Unfortunately, it seems that the last 3 times I've been to this BJ's it has just been disappointing. I thought that now that they have competition next door with Lazy Dog's they'd try a little harder to impress you with the service, but no, they probably don't care.  The last three times, my friends and I have gone to a late dinner around 9:30, which is not a very busy dinner hour, service has been pretty bad. It took over 15 minutes to get anyone to come up to us to take our order. Before that, all the servers just looked at our table without asking if anyone has helped us. It wasn't until after I asked another waitress to send over our server did our waiter come over (after another 5 minutes). On top of the late service, they forgot to get us place settings; they screwed up our order; and they'd drop off food and drinks and walk away so fast that we would not be able to ask them to get us condiments or to tell them they screwed up the order. I'm not one to complain about service that easily, but these servers do not have have the courtesy to ask if you need anything else or even apologize for their mistakes. So I give this BJ's location 1 star, not because of their food, but because of their service. I am probably not going to go to this BJ's location again, especially since there is a Lazy Dog next door with impeccable service and great food and beer."
Johanan L.,"San Francisco, CA",34,213,1,2.0,1/24/2008,"Ehhhh.  This ain't Chicago pizza.  I mean, it's oook.  But don't call it Chicago Pizza.  True Chicago-style pizza has everything inverted except the crust.  It goes like this.  Crust first, then toppings, then cheese, then sauce.  Get with the program. 5 stars for the Bazookie, 0 stars for the pizza, get the average and pretend I suck at math and think rounding down is correct, and you get 2 stars. LOL."
Dee D.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",2,7,,1.0,5/17/2011,"i love BJs.. just not this one.  Theyre so rude, not efficient, and i've been there three times.  i love the BJS in HB and Laguna Hills WAY BETTER.  This location sucks"
Paul A.,"Irvine, CA",700,105,63,4.0,4/25/2010,"Not exactly ""authentic"" Chicago style deep dish pizza (from what I've been told...personally, I have not been to Chicago so can't comment on the authenticity).  The main thing I come here for is the pizza. Authentic Chicago style deep dish or not, I find it to be quite good. My favorites are ""B.J.'s Favorite"" (a sort of 'the works"" type pizza with everything on it) and the ""Great White"" (Alfredo sauce & chicken). I'm a sucker for artichoke and spinach dip so I usually get that as an appetizer, it's good here but I've had far better. They do have a pretty eclectic menu...not as eclectic as Cheesecake Factory but pretty close, they offer a variety of different items; burgers, salads, pastas and such. For many, the main attraction are the beers. I'm not much of a beer drinker (I like my Scotch) but will on occasion partake, I've had the Harvest Hefeweizen, Piranha Pale Ale, and Honey Blonde..all of which I enjoyed. Their Scotch selection sucks. The service here is pretty inconsistent...sometimes good, sometimes bad. Something of an oddity that occurs EVERYTIME I come here is that random servers attempt to deliver food to my table that no one ordered...I think one of these days we're just not going to say anything and take the free food :) This place usually has a mad wait on Friday and Saturday nights, so arrive early or be prepared to wait awhile."
Kenny H.,"Cleveland, OH",220,457,8,2.0,3/26/2006,"If you have 3 hours to kill by going to dinner (or lunch for that matter), then by all means, go here.  Yes, the food at times is great and there's some decent brew here as well. The downside? This location is always crowded (not sure that it warrants this type of attention), the service is sub par, and the amount of time it takes to get your food is obscene. There have been at least 3 times I've been here where I've had to talk to management because they either got my order wrong, forgot something on my order, or it took 30mins+ for a friggen pizooke. Try out some of the other BJs locations, which are much better. As for this one, skip it."

Props to our waiter & waitress, Anna & Chris, who served us right by not only attending to our needs in timely fashion, but also informed us of the best BJ's dishes that us regulars might be missing out on.  The Blackened Chicken Pizza used to be an item on the menu but got taken out for some reason. They still make it however, and is probably the best pizza they have to offer that's not Great White. I love the great white, but sometimes, I'm just in the mood for some marinara sauce and corn on pizza is always good. The California Chicken sandwich is their best sandwich that I've tried. Roasted red & green peppers in melted mozzarella cheese is such a good combo that I often overlook. I suppose it's all about using just the right amount of cheese. You may enjoy the onion strings, which I think tasted Ok. I thought it was too difficult to eat cause the strings were too thin and small.  The APPEAL = 8 Looking forward to coming back anytime, though not anytime soon cause we go there a bit too often. Pizooke!"
James D.,"Woodland Hills, CA",1,21,,3.0,7/8/2013,"This place is OK. Their beers and appetizers are good (not great). But their ""famous pizza"" is a disappointment every time I have it. It lacks in cheese and especially in toppings."
Michael C.,"Las Vegas, NV",39,249,17,4.0,8/29/2010,"Had the chicken fried steak, delicious.  Service is great, and the prices are right.  Although I don't drink anymore, I have had the stout here, a beer smoothie as I like to call it, and it is outstanding.  Very flavorful and will give you a buzz in a hurry."
