Edwin H.,"Chino Hills, CA",2,23,2,4.0,11/25/2010,Went here with my girlfriend. Great Service! They had a new kind of steak on the menu that they asked us to rate (I forgot the name of it) but it was pretty dry. otherwise Great Visit!
Arnold E.,"Orange County, CA",431,583,333,4.0,12/15/2006,"Believe it or not, but BJ's is actually a 'healthy' restaurant. Think about it: oil, grease, and carbs cancelled out by alcohol, fiber-packed veggies, and strenuous talking, laughing, chewing, and staying awake! Pure genius...if you've been reading all the latest research... But seriously, I love this place. The beer is great and is available in several varieties. You can order a beer sampler 'appetizer' or (if you're hosting a small get-together) a mini-keg to wet your whistle. The pizza's excellent...though I only order the BJ's Favorite (I'm not too keen on pizza with white sauce, barbeque pizza, or Hawaiian-style pizza). Pretty much everything else on the menu is good as well. My wife digs the potatoes, the salads, and the bbq, too. If you're into dessert with a pizza-like twist, order the Pizookie (no, it's not one of those crappy cinnamon/sugar pizza desserts from Pizza Hut or Domino's). This BJ's is almost always crowded so expect to wait anywhere from 15 minutes to a week. Just kidding. During football season, Monday nights are hectic. I've been to the ones in Brea, Huntington Beach, and Cerritos, too. Quality's very consistent from branch to branch, so the food's always good. If you haven't already visited BJ's should go soon."
huong d.,"Anaheim, CA",25,18,2,2.0,10/6/2010,"Service was pretty good until the check came....  I took out my credit card to pay and placed it at the edge of the table. No sign of the waiter, the manager walked passed our table at least 3 times and looked at our table and just walked away.  So finally after sitting there for about 10 min. the waiter finally decides to pick up the check.  what wonderful service we had from the manager!"
Anthony S.,"Los Angeles, CA",64,184,1,5.0,7/22/2008,"Sunday morning and you are trying to find a place to soak up last night's booze. Your hazy gaze sends you into the Costco version of a strip mall - The Marketplace. The last thing you need as you nurse a hangover are choices. By the 11 o'clock hour, sober as Billy Graham on a Sunday, or hung over as a red head from Minnesota, the choices are busy. Me and my woozy friend sought out IHOP, but the idea of waiting didn't seem appetizing. Then, like a hidden oasis in the middle of an overdeveloped suburb, BJ's revealed that it now serves brunch. You mean I can drink a pitcher of that luscious beer and have eggs and toast. The gods are smiling on us. Well me, not Alison, she's done after two bites of the toast (which will end up the primer for a new coat of paint on the passenger side of my car). Considering the choices (oh so many, too many for any American) this place should be bookmarked. The servers are eager to please. The booze is there if you need. And the potatoes are sooo f**king delicious."
Andy C.,"Irvine, CA",51,124,7,4.0,1/3/2007,"This place is exactly what OC diners gravitate towards. Comfortable, consistent, unimaginative, yet priced fairly. They have good microbrews for $4 a pint (get the red, blonde or hef) and awesome appetizers (santa fe springrolls, nachos, thin crust pizza). If you get there from 4-7 or after 10pm on a weekday, you get 1/2 off mini deepdish pizzas and dollar off pints too. Their deepdish gets overall thumbs up from most people but isn't anything insanely good or authentic, but it grows on you. I think their classic bjs burger is excellent and the turkey sandwich is good if you drown it in some kind of sauce. The blackened chicken stuffed baked potato is good, and the calzone are crispy and satisfying. There's a lot of little things that are good if you take the time to order stuff other than deepdish. On the other hand, there are some downsides to BJs... If you don't sit in the bar area, be prepared for some slow service, I mean, order 2 drinks at a time because the waiter won't be back for a while. If you avoid going there during peak times (6-8:30) then you should be seated okay, but I prefer finding a spot at the bar, which is first come first serve. As for their food, sometimes their salad is old and gross but just ask for a new one and it they'll get it to you without question. Pasta isn't special at all, so i'd avoid it because meat and potatoes is where they shine. Oh and if you're on a diet... just avoid this place altogether, even their salad is drowned in bacon bits and dressing. I can't say i'm a meat and potatoes kind of person, but I find myself craving BJs a lot more than other restaurants that I'd call great. After 3 pints of Jeremiah Red and a mountain of nachos, there's really no way you can dislike the place, so let yourself be fat and happy at BJ's, it's great."
Farakh Z.,"Long Beach, CA",41,158,10,4.0,8/23/2010,"Food was good service was lacking. Had five different servers so couldn't figure out who was helping us.  The pizza is always delicious and the portions are large.  Wish they prices were a little bit less expensive, but overall you get a good meal."
Gabrielle S.,"Irvine, CA",141,6,,3.0,3/17/2013,i have gone to this BJ's for many many years. i mostly go back just because its a fun place and the food is pretty good. i stick with the classic cheese pizza and the chicken brocolli alfredo pasta. nothing is exceptionally good but i dont think they over price and ive gotten to know a few of the waitresses which is nice. i think the service could be a helluva lot better but thats the food industry today!
Me Y.,"Seattle, WA",43,82,36,1.0,9/15/2013,"call and order the two person party (med pizza, two salads, a big ol' pizookie for $20) - ""your order will be ready to pick up at curbside service in 15 mins.""  I wait 20 for good measure and can't find an empty curbside service parking spot.  Park elsewhere and walk in.  Take out section is full of people waiting.  My turn, I give them my name, ""your order isn't ready yet but I can ring you up now.  oh, I need a manager to ring this up"".  I pay with credit card and see that my order is 3rd in line.   I wait, I wait, I notice that the people who were there before me are getting their food, shouldn't be too long now, more people come in and order takeout, they get their food, I haven't seen mine yet.  I ask ""how much longer for my food?""  guy trots off to go ""find out"".  Don't see him for awhile again.  Mgr comes over and asks if I've been helped and I say someone is checking on my takeout order.  Wait some more, wait, wait, guy comes back, gives some food to some other people that ordered after me, and I ask again ""how much longer for my order?""  he says he'll go check on it.  I wait some more, wait, wait, mgr asks if I've been helped, I say again ""how much longer for my order?"".  He trots off to find out.  By now, it's been an hour since I arrived.  I locate another employee and tell them I want a refund.  She has to trot off to find the manager.  Mgr arrives, re-swipes my card, fumbles with the touchscreen menu for several minutes, says it will take 4-5 days before it drops off my account.  No, I'm really sorry, I'll comp you a pizookie, here's a coupon, this has never happened before, just nothing except a blank face that doesn't even seem to register what just took place.  Nothing near the way a store manager should respond to such a f*&K up.  I'm pretty sure they need a new manager, maybe two or three."
Andy P.,"Cypress, CA",82,728,133,4.0,1/4/2010,"I've been to this particular location many times, mostly for birthday parties. I suppose there's only so much seating here for large groups b/c the wait is impossible, even with a reservation (having to wait for previous parties to finish). The pizza is good here, and so are the fries. Haven't tried the beer here, but heard it's great."
Joseph H.,"Los Angeles, CA",28,103,23,2.0,2/13/2008,"Very good food, but this restaurant really gets dinged by the poor service. Is it just me, or do a lot of the waiters in Orange County kind of have a ""I'm-so-much-better-than-this-job"" attitude when it comes to their occupation? The result is evident at this B.J.'s. Except for being served well one time (maybe its because of the large group + alcohol?), the waiters just don't give a damn.  I swear, most times our food could have been delivered quicker if I got up and fetched it.  It is not uncommon to see a group of the waiters conjugate at the front of the restaurant, chatting it up, only to remember that they have a job to do, not because they want to or are obligated to, but because they would get fired by their manager.  Oh wait, the manager is over there chatting with them too. Damn, I wish I were having as much fun as they were... P.S. lunch is surprisingly good here (tons of lunch-portion menu options).  P.P.S. I must have become tolerant from all the bad service I have received in this County to continually return. At least that's how I justify myself."
Josh S.,"Mission Viejo, CA",185,662,167,4.0,10/23/2007,"Lets get one thing straight, you're not here for cutting edge cuisine so if that is what you expect, go away.  If you're looking for a somewhat generic American menu, with some interesting deep dish pizzas, homemade BEER, a ton of flat screens and last but not least, THE PIZOOKIE, you're in the right place.   I don't come here often but when I do, I'm ok with it.  We were here on Saturday night with the college football and Red Sox Game 6 going, with a group, needing some drinks and food before hitting the Improv.  The wait was long but we stole a table in the bar within a few minutes and gave away our seat buzzer to another group.  I had a pint of the Blonde and another of Hef and ordered their Ribs.  I'm a big ribs fan and had never had them here.  I usually get a pizza or sandwich but this just sounded right tonight.  I have to say, damn good ribs.  Extremely tender, not charred, good BBQ sauce made with their Red Ale beer and they fell off the bone.  What more can one ask for, except some wetnaps.    Plus you finish it off with a pizookie, hot gooey chocolate chip cookie with some vanilla on top.  Great!  This place serves a purpose and does it well."
Char S.,"Irvine, CA",2,14,2,1.0,12/11/2011,"Probably the worst dinner experience we have had in a long time.  Sitting on their patio in the evening is a nightmare.  They seat their large parties there and the noise is deafening.  The service was very poor because the large parties took the attention of the staff.  The large parties did not sit but walked around acting like it was a private room.  Really, really bad!"
mike a.,"Orange, CA",12,31,1,4.0,12/14/2010,"Went by for a quick dinner, really enjoyed the decor and the menu was full of great choices. I had the Italian Market chop salad and a couple of Margaritas, my wife had the pot stickers and BBQ chicken salad. We sat in the bar area which I recommend, try to avoid the patio area, its too noisy...The food was great !"
ashleigh j.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,12,,5.0,10/12/2012,"always good, they have great deals for family size take out and are always open until 11 or 12 at night. perfect for the late date or getting off work late."
Steve T.,"Irvine, CA",0,1,,4.0,4/5/2011,"Never had much food here, mostly hang out at the bar for a few pints. Service at the bar is hit and miss; if you go on a night when Michael is there you're in good shape; if you hit a night when Kim's there, well you've hit a streak of bad luck. Stick with the RED , you can't go wrong."
Eugenia Y.,"Oakland, CA",50,95,1,4.0,4/7/2008,"I don't know why, but it seems all the restaurants in Irvine like to skimp.  If you go to BJ's somewhere else, like say, in Riverside or another more MODEST community, food isn't skimped on.  It's still good though. i enjoy having to use a fork and knife to eat my pizza. Greasy as always, but it's pizza, what do you expect? I usually eat the pizza and rarely eat anything else that is offered.  Their pizookie is awesome! The tastiest thing there. You get a free one if it's your birthday too!  The Beers, i haven't really tried. But everyone I go with loves them."
Maome S.,"Emerson, NJ",28,209,4,4.0,9/15/2006,"Great pizza, beer, and pazooki! Get the peanut butter one with vanilla ice cream!"
Yogi B.,"Irvine, CA",0,37,4,3.0,4/3/2007,"A nice middle of the road restaurant that makes their own beer.  That alone is interesting, and pretty darn tasty.  I wish they had better displays of the brewing process going on and I am a little suspicious of are they actually making the beer there or is it just for show.  Back in the late 80's early 90's there was a terrific brew house ""Gorky's"" in Hollywood.  Now that was FANTASTIC because you could smell the different processes going on to make the beer.  Well the beer at BJ's is good, and that is what matters. The Fish n' Chips are just okay.  OMG the jalapeno pizza was delicious and the worst culinary mistake of my life.  I was crapping fire for days.  I was flaming in a place that really concerned me, but I couldn't mention to anyone.  Did the maniac doing the cooking put too many on the pizza, was he suppose to remove the seeds?  I don't know, but that it is a wicked meal that you will never forget.    Oh wait, I have also ordered their enormous baked potatoes with all of the toppings.  You can't go wrong with that and is a pretty good take home item as well.   A casual place, at a casual price, for a pleasant meal.  The waits are long a peak times, so call to see if they take reservations."
Veronica R.,"Santa Ana, CA",2,3,,1.0,10/21/2012,"So, we get there and they say the rest of our party has been seated, but lo and behold no one is there yet.  Forget to check in to refill our drinks.  Waited forever for appetizers which were cold.  Had to ask for our pizza which was also cold and tasted bad.  Manager discounted our concerns.  Never again."
Jordan P.,"Tustin, CA",42,606,194,4.0,12/1/2009,"Jeremiah Red! Just discovered this beer here and its now one of my favorite beers. 7.5%, happy hour, can't beat it."
