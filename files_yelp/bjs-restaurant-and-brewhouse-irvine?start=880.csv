Traci D.,"Costa Mesa, CA",226,715,21,4.0,11/14/2007,BJs is a pretty cool brewery.  The food isnt anything to brag about but the bartenders at this particular BJs are really cool.   The Pizookies and microbrews are somethings to try.  Also I am giving BJs four stars for their Jerry Burst (a combo of two beers...i dont remember which one or if that is even the right name....but its good).  My friends and I usually go on thursday nights and its not too crowded but it wasnt empty either.
Melody K.,"Irvine, CA",30,211,11,4.0,7/18/2007,"Their food is good all around American mix.  BJ's pizza is really good too, but a bit expensive if you ask me. They have a good happy hour but its only in the bar. Good Luck trying to find a spot to sit in the bar. I once waited a half hour trying to get a table but the wait for a regular table was faster! =/ They brew their own beer that tastes great!! BJ's has them on tap but they don't have any other beer brands on tap. **NOTE** The wait staff does not know which table is which, especially if you sit out on the patio. Your server is not always the person to bring out your meal and I don't know if that's one of the problems. They will either try to give you someone else's food or try to give someone else your food. I have had to flag down the waiters carrying our meals so that they serve it to the correct table. I have learned to watch the wait staff when they walk by with food to see if its mine."
Tim H.,"Orange County, CA",134,336,2,5.0,5/12/2007,"The menu is comprised of mainly simple recipes that might not seem THAT impressive at first but once you've tried it, you'll love it. Honestly, the best thing to get here is the pizza. They serve it in a deep dish pan so the crust is always perfect. This place brews their own beer so if you want, try the beer sampler for a taste of each of their best brews. Finally, you need to get dessert. I don't care if you're full, you need to get the Pizookie. Ice cream on a cookie doesn't seem all that great but once the cookie melts in your mouth with the ice cream, you'll want more.  Recap: Beer Pizza Pizookie"
Alex L.,"Tustin, CA",130,54,1,5.0,8/5/2007,Its obvious that happy here is a greatd deal.  In enjoy the bbq chicken pizza.  The chicken tenders with buffalo wings sauce is a must have for me.  I just like it.   For large groups you cant go wrong bcs of the variety and good food.  It is always consistant.  This location does get really crowded.  The wait can be up to 1 1/2.  Yikes.
Miche A.,"San Diego, CA",5,182,,3.0,9/24/2007,"I'll begin with why I love BJ's 1) Pazookies...warm cookie pizza with Ice Cream = scrumptious 2) All the drinks are amazing, I'm not a beer drinker but I've heard nothing but great comments about the many different drafts they have. And here is where I had the best cosmo EVER...seriously...best EVER!!! 3) The pizza is delicious! And I've ordered many different things on the menu and never been disappointed Now for the bad part...... 1) Wait, wait wait! No matter the time or day you will have to wait. Last week I met a friend there for dinner...5 pm on a TUESDAY and we still had a 20 minute wait... 2) Don't go in big groups, they can't handle it. I decided to have my 21st birthday dinner there and lets just say that it took 3 days of phone calls back and forth and me hounding the manager (they kept ""transferring"" me from one person to another) to get a simple reservation locked down. In total I was put on hold for over 45 minutes.... definitely a let down 3) I have had many rude servers while eating here. Servers who completely crossed the line of appropriate behavior to a girl who just could have cared less...she literally brought the dishes out and just left them on the empty neighboring  table and told us to ""grab which one is yours""....now I don't expect to be treated like the queen of England but isn't distributing the dishes to the right person a requirement of the job??? 4) And the last time I ate there we had multiple problems with the bill. They charged about $30 more than I signed for. And again, I was put on hold forever when trying to get ahold of a manager who could take care of it. AND AGAIN it took about 2 days of back and forth phone calls to get the problem corrected.  Needless to say, I come here for drinks and appetizers (or pizza). They do take to go orders as well. Just a shame, they could easily have 5 stars if they did better at screening who they hire."
Ray R.,"Newark, CA",41,163,7,4.0,10/17/2007,SWEET JESUS. You can feed a third world country with one of their pizzas. And that cookie and ice cream thing; HOT MESS!
Ashley K.,"Irvine, CA",420,38,6,4.0,1/1/2010,"i lovooovoovoe bj's the appetizer sampler is goooooood the piiizzaaa iss so thick and crusty yumm and the pizookies are so warm and gooey and perfect four stars for the quality i would have given five but i just don't like the overpriced menu. i mean, you can bake your own pizookie and it'll cost you less than five bucks but a pizzookie from bjs is at least ten bucks [? not sure] but i know it's expensive ALSO, the service was kinda ehhh...i guess the waitress thought she could be a b-head to us cause my friends and I are high school kids, but we were'nt being rowdy, rude, etc. and we had to wait ten minutes drooling over our pizookies for sppooons. tip: go with a group of at least six we each paid 15 dollars and we got the appetizer sampler, 2 medium pizzas (ithink) and a large pizoookie (note; these were teenagers..with big appetites :] )"
Debbi P.,"Brentwood, CA",33,136,5,3.0,3/6/2008,"Haven't been to Chicago yet so can't really say if this is truly indicative of Chicago-style or not, but it's still good Pizza, deep dish but nothing new or fancy. The service was so average it's not even worth mentioning. The 3***: The desert however, was sickeningly yummy. You know, that kind of 'so-good-I-can't-stop-so-I-think-I'm-gonna-be-sick-now"" desert... it was a deep dish white choc mac nut cookie... (Pakoozie something or other) ...couldn't resist.  I am the cooki monster after all"
Kirun M.,"Manhattan, NY",114,429,,4.0,6/2/2009,"When you have lived in Irvine, you're forced to review chains because that's all they got! For happy hour this place rocks! For lunch, the service is a little slow...but the food is great. I love their minestrone soup! It's so delicious. Their pizzas are SO good-duh. The sandwiches are hit or miss, but you live you learn. Their stuffed baked potatoes are incredib(ly gigantic). What else...their appetizer food is yummy especially during happy hour...why pay more?"
Terry T.,"Placentia, CA",437,14,,1.0,8/24/2011,"Where do I begin... i hate writing bad reviews being in the industry but i know how long things should take and steps of service. if seating in the bar is self seating then bussing should be done efficiently. We waited for a booth for 10 mins. My girlfriends lemondrop martini was severely under poured. We ordered our food and let our server know we were going to be ordering dessert at the end of our meal... the food came out ""likitty split""  but with no set ups. Half way through our meal the check was dropped (big no no) and our server disappeared, we were never asked if we wanted anything before last call. He came back to pick up the check and we informed him that we wanted to order a pizooki he took or order and litterally ran to the kitchen. Only to come back and inform us that the kitchen was already being closed down. At this point he should have inform the manager and have him touch our table, but the manager was nowhere to be seen the whole night. Needless to say we were pretty pissed considering we let him know that we were going to order dessert when we were done with our meal. It sucks cause I know he was in the back doing his closing sidework trying to get out asap and sacrificed quality of service"
Thomas D.,"Irvine, CA",84,238,2,4.0,10/31/2009,"Love coming here with a big group of friends. Food is decent, nothing amazing but good enough. The reason for the 4 stars is the pizzookie. One of the best desserts out there, party platter for me and a few friends or two party platters. Always amazing"
Billie B.,"Garden Grove, CA",70,68,18,3.0,1/9/2009,"Went for lunch today with two friends. Told you I go out often. It's becoming quite insane. :) Anyways we put our name in for the wait. We decided to be 'table stalkers' in the bar area(you linger til someone pays their bill and bolt for the table)...and it worked, within 2 minutes we had a choice of two tabletops and a booth, we took the latter.  We had no setups, aka silverware and napkins..had to go ask for some, after our app. came(wtf?) The app was good-southwest eggrolls..I got the tomato bisque soup-sooooo yummmmmy!!! I totally recommend. Friend got a loaded pizza, I got a mediterranean pizza(delish!!!!), and other friend the chicken fried steak with mashed potatoes and veggies(It was GIGANTIC!!!!!)..and we all 3 got strawberry lemonade...server was obviously super busy, and nobody seemed to want to offer refills, so I asked the server..then waited like 5 min, so I asked the busser and he brought my refill back, then 20 sec. later she brought my orig. refill..oh well...everyone seems to be understaffed these days...damn economy... I love their food...the service was decent. She was busy, but come on bussers and hosts help a girl out...."
Cecilia H.,"Irvine, CA",0,13,,2.0,8/23/2012,Food is okay. I had a wedge salad and it was the worst salad. Very little dressing and two tiny pieces of bacon. Awful! Always their featured beer is expensive. Not worth it. Like bjs too. Oh well.
Alex M.,"Irvine, CA",6,21,,4.0,3/16/2006,"If you love deep dish pizzas, this is the place for you! My family and I used to go to the BJ's in Brea until they finally opened one close to home. But try to go before or after dinner or even lunch unless you want to wait about 30 minutes for a seat. Although sitting at the bar cancels out any waiting unless that too is full. Some of the greatest Deep Dish Pizzas reside here at BJ's. You can get the usual pepperoni, sausage, etc. but it's best to try some of their original pizzas. I LOVE the Buffalo Chicken Pizza which has buffalo chicken, celery, onions, and a side of ranch dressing. Even their standard pizza with pepperoni and tomatoes is great. You can get the pizza in a nice mini size for those who want their own pizza but I like to get small and bring the rest home for the next day. If you're not into pizza, you're in luck because BJ's has some great appetizers and sandwiches. Occasionally I get a Chicken Breast Sandwich on the Garlic Cheese Roll. One of my favorite sandwiches of all time. But you can't forget the Pazooki which is a signature BJ's dessert. They put cookie dough into a deep dish pan, cook it, and top it off with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream. The best thing about this, apart from the taste, is that you can get it in whatever cookie flavor you love. I usually get a Black & White which is half Chocolate Chip and the other half White Chocolate Macadamia Nut. The only small problem I have with BJ's is how long it usually takes for the food. It's best to get  drinks, appetizers, and a few friends so you can forget about the wait and just chill out."
chris b.,"New York, NY",79,200,3,4.0,10/26/2009,"This Bj's is a fun one to go to.  Crowded, lots of TV's, noisy.  Waits can be quite long on busy nights.  Bar seating can help bypass the wait but even that fills up easily.  I like going to this Bj's with big groups at non peak times like weekend lunches.  Or going here in small groups works too for dinner at the bar.  No comment on the food (except Got Carbs?), it's commercial BJ's fair and the same as any other location.  The crowds that move en masse to this BJ's are both the positives and negatives of this BJ's vs all others."
K C.,"Irvine, CA",13,47,1,2.0,1/14/2012,"This place used to be a favorite but the quality of food and service have gone downhill. We went for a birthday lunch recently and were seated quickly, but when I told the server we were expecting 2 more people she said to inform the hostess. So we did and then nothing happened and our guests were actually standing because they had no where to sit. Finally my husband dragged another table over and 2 chairs to add to ours. The whole time we could see 3-4 servers standing around chatting inside while we were managing ourselves. Then my friends order didn't come but the food was so meh that after telling the server and still not getting it, we cancelled it."
daniel b.,"Orange, CA",5,13,,4.0,2/26/2010,"one of my favorite spots to come to late night.  love their micro-brews and i like all of their food.  it's mellow and not too much of a ""scene"", although there is some talent that comes through. the only downside is the seating at the bar gets limited during their late night happy hour (10pm-close) so you have to either get their early or wait around for an open spot.  service is hit or miss, depending on the server; there are some good ones, but the bad ones are really bad. dependable spot if you need a place for solid drinks and food."
James J.,"Tustin, CA",0,2,,1.0,6/24/2012,"Bj's is a great restaraunt.. But im giving it a 1 star for this location because i had visited her one night and i usually come here on a lot of occassions but on my visit for my anniversary i had the worst visit ever I made reservations and still waited 30min for our table when we MADE reservations.. Whats the point of a reservation if we have tomwait as long as the customers who didnt?? The waitress took forever for drinks, gave very very rude attitude, had no respect, made me go to the bar to get my drink, gave me hassle getting the happy hour price, then the bar tender was just an a**hole argued with me on what time it was because i wanted the happy hour price when clearly i showed him the time and he then said i didnt know what time it was but its a dissappoint me i went thru so much hassle for a beer.. Seriously??.. RULE # 1 Never argue with a customer. Find a Soultion first!!  Then we waited an hour for our food... I will never suggest this to people for special occassions."
Walter M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",27,9,,5.0,4/6/2010,We always have great service and good food. We eat there regularly and are always happy to go back. If it is busy the staff always does their best to make it easy on you.  The pizookie is really good.
Aaron C.,"San Diego, CA",48,7,1,4.0,7/19/2010,"Standard BJ's experience. This place has a full bar and all the food selections, unlike the smaller BJ's at the beach."
