Lina K.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,43,3,3.0,7/14/2012,"they're known for their pizookies, so don't leave without getting one for dessert."

Dru C.,"Orange County, CA",658,833,2262,3.0,8/16/2008,"I have a love/hate relationship with chain restaurants. The quality of food and service can be so wildly inconsistent, yet I keep coming back for more. This time around, I met a few friends and co-workers after work on a weekday, and this place was already packed with people stuffing their faces with those ridiculous moon-sized pizookies. I've always been a fan of their house-brewed beer, especially the Jeremiah Red. This and the other flavors go down so smooth, that after a few pitchers you'll have to prevent your face from falling flat in a deep dish pizza."
Daniel w.,"Tustin, CA",10,62,,5.0,3/27/2009,"I have dreams about their pizza. To anyone who points out that their ""chicago style"" pizza isn't chicago style at all... who gives a shit? This is awesome pizza! I rarely try anything else, but when I do, It's great as well.  Now, we get to the beer. Great beer! You've gotta respect in-house brewing. My personal favorite is the Nutty Brunette. They also have tons of flat screens which are viewable from anywhere in the restaurant (except the patio seating), so you can catch a game if you like. In short, I love BJ's..... oh yes."
gretchen c.,"Fallbrook, CA",86,102,11,2.0,6/26/2008,"I stopped coming to this BJ's because the parking lot is a nut house & you always have to wait for a table. If you are in the area, I would go for Opah or Bucca over BJ's."
John R.,"Tustin, CA",0,38,2,4.0,10/8/2009,I went to BJ's yesterday to see the Angel's game and it was a little crowded.  I still waited for a table since their Deep Dish pizza's and hot wings are the best.  I would recommend to everyone to go there for Happy Hour.  I would also recommend getting there early to get a seat @ the bar.
Sean B.,"Livermore, CA",427,31,4,5.0,10/4/2008,They have really good pizza. I went here for my fraternity bid dinner and it was a great place to have dinner.
ROBERT F.,"Tustin, CA",0,22,,5.0,5/25/2010,"This place is always good. We had a waitress, Monica, who was exceptionnel. She was super nice and accomodating. She went out of her way. Ask for her station. I ordered the lunch special which came with a mini pizza and salad--good deal."
Francisco C.,"Garden Grove, CA",5,302,,4.0,6/30/2011,Delicious deep dish pizza and great desserts. I like the ambience and their dishes are reakky tasty. Will definitely visit this place again.
Mari J.,"Upland, CA",8,208,3,2.0,9/27/2006,"I've been the this location a couple times.  The service is ok, and I guess I went in the off hours because it wasn't especially crowded, but the food is thumbs down.  I don't get why everyone loves BJs.  I think the food is very mediocre and the tomatoes on the pizza taste like they are straight out of a can.  I had an all right chicken sandwich once, but wasn't good enough for me to come running back."
Christine C.,"San Francisco, CA",254,195,228,4.0,6/4/2010,been to this place so many times. love their bbq chicken chopped salad and pizzas. and of course the pizookie. only down side is you usually have to wait a good 1 hour before u can get seated on fri/weekend night.  service is usually pretty good as well
Michelle J.,"Irvine, CA",0,61,8,2.0,4/14/2013,"I wanted to give this one star but because I've had good happy hour here i will give it a 2 star.  My husband and I came for lunch on Sunday. We were told it was a 10 to 15 minute wait. After 35 minutes, I told my husband to go ask what happened. he was told we were still on the list. Then they call another party that came in after us. Finally we find out they say their computer system is down and instead of a party of 2, they have us as a party of 4 with a baby! Ugh, so then we get seated and they had the nerve to tell us that it's not THEIR fault, the computer is down. Umm, excuse me but you gave us the buzzer and it never went off, you were still giving other diners the buzzers and also telling them 10 to 15 minute wait. If it's not your fault, whose is it?Then we get seated. The menu pages are stuck together with FOOD. I'm afraid to order food now. FINALLY a waitress comes and takes our order. I figure coffee would be good and a salad. She brings the coffee and my husband's beer. We get our entrees and I ask for a coffee refill. After 10 minutes, no refill, no waitress. I ask another waitress because my husband is ready to go to the bar with the empty coffee cup. She brings the coffee - but no cream! How hard can this be! The servers here have not sense of wanting to actually SERVE anyone! The entrees come and they are just ok. The table next to us has their entrees served wrong - the salad wasn't tossed and the dressing wasn't served on the side - they are complaining. the table across from us gets a dessert that they never ordered - the server is wandering around trying to find where to serve it. Then I get my cream for my coffee.  Here is a piece of advice:  let the servers assigned to the table actually serve the food and take responsibility for their guests. Your serving system stinks!  If you order an appetizer be prepared for it to be served with or after your entree. The timing of this restaurant makes no sense. They have redone the menu and it is very confusing with too many choices and the menu selection is just plain dumb - they have 3 chicken sandwiches?!! Why?  There is a reason the Lazy Dog Cafe next door is doing so well. We don't come here much anymore and now I remember why.  If you just want a pizza and a beer come here. Otherwise, go to the Lazy Dog Cafe next door - where they know how to serve food and drinks.  Also, we looked for any NEVER saw a manager on duty. If you are the owner - you might want to ask yourself where your manager was on Sunday!"
Kyle V.,"Los Angeles, CA",101,339,15,1.0,3/26/2007,"oh boy! i'm going to rip bj's a new one. A few friends and myself decided to go to BJ's after work for a little happy hour action. When told we were in for a 45 minute wait for a table I went directly to the bar and got a drink. After looking the place over now that I had my drink and I was just getting comfortable, I noticed something disturbing. What I had just noticed is that at least 80% of the patrons in this establishment were fat, ugly, white, middle aged, and lame.  DANG!! The quintuple strikeout.  OKAY. At this point I ask my friend why he likes the place. He says, ""It's just a really chill place."" I guess if you consider an Applebee's atmosphere mixed with a hint of McDonald's chill you would be correct.  We finally get our table and the rest of our party arrives. Immediately we are bugged two or three times by our overweight, ugly server for drinks. We had asked her to wait but she didn't know how I guess. We get done with introductions and are ready to order. Fugly comes back an IDs everyone before we order. One friend has an expired ID and she says she won't serve him. Okay, she's doing her job, but do you still have to be ugly and fat?? Some of us already had a drink so we decide to get one round and then bounce. We get a sampler and the dude with the expired license takes a few sips. He is obviously of age (25) and the license just expired. The manager then comes over and recards everyone (wtf) and threatens to kick us out of anyone not of age drinks. Since we are all of age we continue to drink and 5 minutes later the manager comes over and asks us to leave.  If you are into places where lame middle aged, boring, white people congregate to talk about buying new SUVs and their OC watchin' little kid's soccer practices, then GO HERE!!! If you like ugly, boring, fat servers who have no personality, then GO HERE!!  If not, go next door to Opah."
Scott B.,"Irvine, CA",14,40,6,1.0,11/28/2007,"Double billed by BJ's on 11/19.  Good thing I used my AMX and they reversed the charge immediately.  Two years ago, they added a ""1"" to the front of my tip, increasing it by $10.  Once is an oversight, but manipulating my check TWICE is absurd.  I've only been there a handful of times.  I'll never return and I'm reporting them to the BBB."
Susan F.,"Irvine, CA",0,21,,1.0,12/10/2012,waited one hour at the restaurant for a scampi pasta for take out!  and still was charged for the item.  not until we asked the manager for a refund did we receive a credit back!  really?  customer service is severely lacking at this location!
Gayle K.,"Anaheim, CA",6,28,4,4.0,10/31/2006,"Great pizza, for huge sport fans they have a big screen T.V.  at the bar and for dessert the pazooki."
Amy S.,"Anaheim, CA",1,42,2,3.0,5/10/2010,I ordered their pasta with chicken and broccoli. It was pretty good and satisfied my craving for pasta but did not impress me. The price was pretty high too. The thing I went here for was the Pazookie. Everyone tells me about how great it is. Well all it is is Toll House Cookie Dough baked with ice cream on top. Nothing to extraordinary. I didn't enjoy it here.
Marcy O.,"Costa Mesa, CA",56,72,2,4.0,1/24/2007,"Great place for happy hour and to catch a game.  The avocado egg rolls are to die for.  They have personal pizza's on special at happy hour that are delicious and satisfying.  They brew their own 'berry burst cider' - a good alternative to beer.  Although, I always appreciate a good BJ's brew."
Allie R.,"Irvine, CA",38,3,,2.0,3/9/2013,"This has been a go to spot for take out that was not Mexican.  This time the whole experience was terrible.  We called to place an order and took a few calls to get through.  That should have been a warning sign.  When we placed the order they told us it would be 15 to 20 minutes.  We arrived 20 minutes later and there were 3 people behind the to go desk.  One was using the register and the other two were there I guess for decoration since they didn't bother to greet me or use the other register to ring up my order.  After my order was paid for I waited for a good ten minutes and one of the waitresses tells me that she saw my order and it was almost ready.  15 minutes later she decides to check on it and, well, she disappeared...another ten minutes another person goes to check and then comes back with some food, but not mine.  He goes back again and disappears.  Finally after waiting 30 minutes there, almost an hour total, they come out with the food.  They said that they had to redo the pizza after they messed up on it.  Seriously they couldn't go and find this out and tell me?! When we get home we find that the burger we ordered was completely cold, the Santa Fe salad had a blob of something in it, and the pizza was hardly warm.  What ever happened to the service and why was the pizza that they had to ""remake"" barely warm?  They only get two stars because previous experiences were okay."
C T.,"Irvine, CA",0,47,2,3.0,6/4/2012,"after this post and a similar email i received from their website, they quickly emailed me and apologized for the poor service and offered me a $50 gift card to try them again.  that was a very classy gesture and for that i would returned to the same bj's.  i love their food and their pizookies!"
