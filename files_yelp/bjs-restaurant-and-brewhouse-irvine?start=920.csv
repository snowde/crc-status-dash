Lily P.,"Spokane, WA",63,329,53,3.0,12/31/2006,"Why do people wait for hours for your standard food?  It's ok if you don't have to wait, but not worth it if you do."
Troy L.,"Irvine, CA",0,8,,3.0,11/8/2010,"Don't do curbside!  For a deep Dish Chicago style pizza you can't go wrong, and that is the only reason why I come back to this establishment. I understand they are busy almost all the time though the some of the young staff can be so incompetent and lack customer service skills.  I usually order to go as you think it will be quicker than waiting. Though in most cases I have waited much longer than the 15-20 minutes they usually tell me.  So now I go inside to pick up.  One time after lagging 25 minutes to get there I still waited another 25 minutes for curbside delivery. Even after one took my money promptly and brought me change, I had to call again to get them to acknowledge me, meanwhile the food was sitting there getting cold.  After I complained sitting for almost an hour at curbside for my personal pie, I was offered a free soda! Which I declined as I was starving and grumpy by than.  When I got home 5 minutes later the cheese was barely melted, and the meal went back into the oven to be re-heated."
Maggie H.,"Buena Park, CA",214,203,48,4.0,2/4/2010,"the food is pretty good. nice deep dish pizza, variety of drinks. and great service. they happen to forget my order and completely took it off the bill since it came out late. and can you go wrong with a fresh cookie with a scoop of ice cream? i've had the chicken fried steak which was ok (take into consideration that i'm very picky on my southern comfort foods tho, since i use to live in texas). pastas are decent, blackened chicken alfredo fettucine is a dish i've ordered more than once. they have a good selection of mixed drinks on top of their beers."
Jonathan Y.,"Monrovia, CA",61,198,1,4.0,9/2/2006,"Good food, good brew, but yes very busy. It's near UCI so of course there's college kids. But the TVs are huge (main TV is multiple large projection type), so if you're going to lounge and are not on a time limit, come here!"
Michelle N.,"Irvine, CA",42,135,26,3.0,10/3/2007,"Bugger. I read all the reviews and thought this place would be relatively tasty, and it turned out to be slightly good. I got the buffalo chicken pizza (mini) with a salad and then split a chocolate chunk pazookie for dessert.  Salad was yummy (but it's a salad) but then the pizza came. All I have to say to it is 'meh'.  The crust and dough were nice but there was too much salt and spice going on in the topping to really taste anything else and the chicken was dry with crunchy edges. The ranch dressing dip was also bizarre. It sorta tasted ranch-ish with a touch of bleu cheese and, errr, water. I only used this to tame the spice and salt in my mouth and found it left an odd coating. Meh. My friend's pizza (the BJ's fave) looked good, but she wasn't too impressed with the flavours (too salty), and the sandwiches were all right. I give this place three stars though because of the really scrummy pazookie. Dear Lord. We (6 women) decided to split one because we were so full (they were, I was just feeling kinda icky from that dip) and suddenly spoon fights erupted as people vied for the gooey chocolate chunky bits with the ice cream. See, the pazookie is a cookie baked into a small circular tin with two scoops of vanilla ice cream on top, and is the best thing since sliced bread. Seriously.  This place also gets stars because the servers and hosts were super friendly, and they even had the Euro Championship Soccer Qualifiers on, which just warmed my heart.  So, come here for the beer and the pazookie, but just say no to the pizza."
Graham W.,"Sacramento, CA",69,69,1,3.0,5/22/2007,Standard corporate fare.  I thought the amber beer had an unpleasant aftertaste or I woulda really liked it.
John K.,"Tustin, CA",17,105,2,4.0,6/10/2007,This is a great place for lunch. Sit outside if the weather permits. Avoid if there's a big game... unless you like a rowdy crowd. The pizza is a nice biscuit type of crust. Very flavorful.
Christina F.,"Irvine, CA",8,25,1,4.0,6/13/2007,i've always enjoyed eating at BJ's. they have great service and great food!! the kids meals are winners too! happy face french fries!! the kids love it and if you get a seat facing the big screen tv's...it's a great place to take a family. you don't have to worry about the noise level too since it's already lound in there.  great place to hangout and have tasty deep dish pizza. the buffalo chicken pizza is an all time favorite!! the pizookie is also something you gotta have before you leave. the only complaint i have about that is that there isn't enough vanilla ice cream!! not a bad thing! they should open more around irvine since there is always a long wait if you don't go early or make reservations!
marlon e.,"Los Angeles, CA",666,798,128,3.0,11/20/2008,great beginnings as they call it everyone calls it appetizers... most of the time thats what i order just because i come here for beer and some munchies.. i don't expect a really great meal from places like this... don't set your expectations too high so that you wont be disappointed... well the service here gets kinda annoying and slow plus they get really busy... i don't know whats the deal with people loving their pizookie so much... its just so easy to make at home damn it... unless your too lazy to heat up a cookie then pile it up with ice cream!
katie j.,"Irvine, CA",19,20,2,4.0,2/13/2008,"you don't fully understand life until you have had the avocado egg rolls. avocado, sun-dried tomato, cilantro, chipotle peppers, cream cheese. ....ex nay the tamarind sauce and ask for the south west sauce...its an orgy of flavors in my mouth like i have never experienced. same goes for buffalo chicken pizza. and the Oreo pizzooookie and if you go at night about 10 ish. everything is half off? you cant go wrong. the only reason why i give you 4 stars is because you charge me for a class of tap soda water, when i know it isn't from a bottle and should be free. 3 dollars doesn't cut it man!"
Lolo S.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,18,,4.0,8/11/2012,"love this place its great! i love the jambalaya and the southwest salad and the pizza. beer is good not great but good, but with everything combined i love it here. i think the turn around of staff is high because every time we go we don't really see familiar faces so the staff can vary but its never been horrible."
Alix L.,"Newport Coast, CA",337,174,73,3.0,12/19/2007,"This BJs has a really nice bar and private outdoor setting, real fancy... 2pizzas 2bazookis and 6rootbears = $80... WoW.... talk about getting a new job...  Not only does it lose a star for the price... but... the place isnt that sanitary either... and no.. you dont have to visit their bathrooms... just stare at your root beer glass the next time you're finished.... and try to scratch off that lil something in the cup (thats why i dont use dishwashers at home.. )... other than that... great place to hang out with RICH friends..."
jenny t.,"San Diego, CA",5,12,,4.0,4/8/2008,It took me a while to like this place...and I would have to say the food gets better over the years. Out of all the places that serves pizza...I would say BJ's has the best pizza around.... YUM!
tamara w.,"Irvine, CA",171,174,1,4.0,10/6/2007,"Oddly enough, I've already been to this location the same amount of times I had been to the one in Cupertino.  Which is only twice.  But still.  Came here once for dinner and once for happy hour.  The dinner time we shared a BJ's Favorite Pizza and a salad I can't find on their online menu which is okay because it wasn't super great.  The pizza was really good because I was hungry, it was quick, hot, and had a deep crust which is my favorite part.    The time we came for happy hour, we got there a little too early.  So we ended up ordering the appetizer sampler first and two mini pizzas and two pizookies once happy hour started.  The appetizer sampler was perfect for the four of us.  By the time we got the pizzas, I was only able to eat one slice - of the same pizza I had gotten for dinner.  It wasn't as hot but still good.  The pizookies are ridiculous.  One person in our group loves whipped cream so they were stacked with it.  Oh so good but oh so bad for you.   I so want another one now.  Service has been good both times."
David R.,"Tustin, CA",2,60,,3.0,5/10/2009,"Decent food, reasonable prices, but always crowded at dinner time. Pizzas here are not something I would order here considering its ""sauceless"". For me I need some tomato sauce on my pizza to consider it a ""pizza"". Baked stuffed potatos are not bad. Burgers, sandwiches, and pastas are comparable to any other establishment that is like this. Lots of tvs all over the restaurant which is a plus. They do take reservations for big parties on the outside patio too. If you want pretty good bar type food this is a place to definitely check out. Hefz and amber beer is pretty good here too."
Michael K.,"Great Neck, NY",2,95,,3.0,9/16/2007,"Went here for dinner while my fourteen year old bro was playing basketball in the maccabee games.  We were brought by the family that he was staying wth.  The salad was bland but most salads at places like this are.  My brother's friend got some chicken appetizer that he couldn't get enough of.  The shrimp scampi was a huge portion but pretty good for a place like this.  Th deep dish pizza that my brother had was not good at all but I'm more of a thin crust man  myself and I should have had it in chicago first.  The dessert was the best part as it was this huge cookie (about the size of a large pizza) with ice cream on top.  One of the best desserts that I've ever had.  The cookies you could choose from are oreo, chocolate chip, macadamia nut and peanut butter and oatmeal raisin.  Alright place for a night out, but not an amazing meal."
Jack D.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,2,,1.0,7/6/2008,Save yourself the time and hassle and go to Oggi's in Tustin.  Much better beer and their pizza blows BJs away.  Never heard of pizza without sauce - my money goes to OGGI'S in Tustin!
Jason Y.,"Irvine, CA",35,52,19,4.0,1/21/2007,"the waits are usually pretty long for a table, but I like the food. you have pizza, salads, pasta, and a wide selection of food to choose from. pizookie for dessert is a must with the warm chocolate chip cookie and vanilla ice cream."
