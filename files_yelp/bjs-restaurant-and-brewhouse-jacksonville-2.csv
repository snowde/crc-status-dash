Justin M.,"Savannah, GA",65,5,5,4.0,12/20/2017,"The night started out horribly. We were told we would have to wait 20 minutes to be seated. Less than 5 min later, we were rudely interpreted by the pager; get your stuff together, BJ's, we want a clear plan of action. It was a good thing the bartender had poured us some of the smallest beers I've ever seen and kindly waived the cost. We may have missed our table otherwise. While my entrée, an authentic, thin-crust, Extreme Pepperoni pizza, was excellent, another patron in my party received a pepperoni pizza that looked like a rotten loaf of bagged bread with some cheese tossed atop. It was so thick that it arrived in a special pan, with tall outer rims, to prevent the mess of a product from spilling onto the table. It was almost as if BJ's intended on making such a disaster."
Ronnie G.,"Jacksonville, FL",111,10,36,1.0,12/11/2017,"I called the restaurant today and spoke with the Manager on shift. After discussing the situation and how I thought that even if the chef thought it was acceptable to serve the food that way, that the person who brought the food to the table, or even the waitress should know that something wasn't right.  They should have taken initiative to correct the issue. The manager today said I should have said something at that time to the manager since the General Manager is there on Wednesday's. After a few pauses to see what their next move was, I got an apology. Yeah, that's what I kinda expected.  They have one chance to get it right. I mean, I don't want to waste 30 min of a lunch hour waiting for a burger twice. And given another chance to make it right, I got an apology. Even after being asked to call in. Ok. Thanks."
Anonymous R.,"Orange Park, FL",2,20,2,5.0,1/4/2018,"I came in today, sat down at bar, i was promptly greeted by friendly bartender, i ordered a beer and Nashville chicken sandwich... My food was excellent and came out in reasonable time. No complaints! A++++"
Rachel P.,"Miami, FL",13,88,186,4.0,6/20/2017,"I LOVE BJ's.... the restaurant, of course. I usually go to the location in Doral (Miami) but being in JAX for two weeks on business, we tried a variety of places, this being one of them.   Ahi tuna salad was great - tuna and all greens were fresh.  Calamari was a bit salty and broccoli soup was a little bland.  But their new mac-n-cheese cous cous was surprisingly delicious!  And don't get me started on the white chocolate macadamia nut pizookie... that is LIFE. I love the feel of this place and although I didn't try the beer at this location, it's usually great.  Would totally keep coming back."
Alisha S.,"Frederick, MD",0,1,,1.0,12/30/2017,"Personally I love most BJ's but we ended up leaving because the hostess was very unprofessional and inefficient at this branch. We were a party of 4 (which we told her multiple times), but she input us as a party of 2. There were people that came after us who had already gotten seated. When they finally called our name and there were 4 of us, she tried to make us wait some more due to her mistake. It would have been fine except she did not own up to her mistake at all and tried to make us wait more."
Matt D.,"Jacksonville, FL",3,15,6,5.0,6/10/2017,"You can't go wrong at BJ's! Great service as always. The wife and I decided to go Italian this time and let me tell you the Deep Dish Ziti is fantastic. Great flavor and plenty enough to fill you up and take some home for leftovers afterward. The Sirracha Queso dip is a much better option than the spinach dip and at almost half the cost. Only one small complaint, the menus were a bit sticky and need to be wiped down periodically."
Greg Y.,"Chidester, AR",2,2,1,4.0,12/6/2017,"This was the spot for lunch today.  The menu was BIG (about 40 pages), too much, LOL.    I had the ""Brisket- Bacon-Buger"" that was slamming and endless fries (the 1st was the last) Service was excellent, food was ready in no time...."
Ansel Diama P.,"Jacksonville, FL",263,203,166,5.0,11/22/2017,Bjs is actually very good. I would say it is an equal competitor to Cheesecake Factory. The dishes are generously portioned with prices that won't hurt the pocket. Definitely a spot to visit! - Ansel Ponce Doama
Lisa J.,"Northside, Jacksonville, FL",48,6,1,5.0,11/27/2017,"I love this restaurant, EVERYTIME i visit I'm never disappointed! From the service to the food. My favorite desert there is the pizookie (chocolate chip)! I highly recommend this pizza cookie. And the jambalaya is AHMAZINGGGG  please make this a restaurant of your choice esp for date night"
Donny S.,"Holbrook, NY",10,103,27,4.0,8/28/2017,Pretty good spot in Jacksonville.  They have a nice beer selection and a pretty decent menu.  The food is consistently good.
Diana B.,"Hilton Head Island, SC",430,132,260,5.0,10/16/2017,Love BJs Restaurant and this location specifically.  The menu is great because there is something for everyone.  The beer selection is out of this world and the Pumpkin ale hits the spot.  TVs all around - best place to get a game and the service is right on target.  The Ghirardelli pizookie is a dream!  My favorite features are on the app - preferred waitlist and mobile pay get you in and out quickly!
Rory D.,"Jacksonville, FL",1444,457,253,3.0,11/13/2017,"Some good proprietary beers, especially the stout. Great Happy Hour specials, we like the ahi Tuna, the chicken potstickers and their wings. I like the new Nashville Hot wing sauce, and did NOT like the cherry chipotle which was sweet & zero chipotle flavor. Some of their other beers are a bit bland, Bud Light in flavor. They do have an extremely well stocked bar. Drink specials also include a discount off well drinks and their beers are $4."
Genesis A.,"Saint Marys, GA",335,179,531,1.0,5/7/2017,"Decided to give this place a second chance. Just save your money and eat elsewhere. Service is lacking, pretty much non existent. Took awhile to get any kind of drinks, when our waitress did come she took our drink order, I was ready to order also.  She wasn't ready to take our order at the time said she'll be right back.  Ummmmm ok  she brings out drinks which felt like forever. She than took out order, my son got Alfredo and chicken and I got a jalapeño burger(medium) . The food made it to the table in a timely manner. I cut into my burger and it's well done, wouldn't have been a big deal if it wasn't dry. I take a few bites and realize my son is eating with his hands. I yell at him about table manners and he tells me he doesn't have anything to eat with. He was right, our waitress finally comes back and we ask for silverware she said ok I'll be right back. She never came back she walks past us my son yells to her about his silverware. She nods and keeps walking. We waited while he eats with his hands, she never came back. I finally tell him to wipe his hands and go find any waiter/waitress for silverware. When she finally makes her way back to the table, she doesn't say anything about the silverware she was supposed to be getting,  I ask for refills she says ok. She brought my son another sprite but didn't refill my water. When she came back to clear our plates my son ordered dessert before I could stop him. How bad can they mess up dessert so I say it's ok. He ordered the kids cookie and ice cream. That was a huge mistake it took 25 minutes for it to get to the table. Not once did our waitress stop by again. She returned 10 min after the dessert was delivered with the check. Luckily I had my card in hand waiting. Didn't want to give her another chance to disappear. 2.5 hrs for a kids chicken Alfredo, jalapeño burger, sprite, water and a kids mini cookie and ice cream. The place wasn't even busy that was ridiculous."
Greg S.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,4,,4.0,9/16/2017,"Food great, service absolutely sucked the waiter Was more interested in his social behavior than our food or drink had to ask three times for water and tea. Not happy with the waiter"
Antonio F.,"Jacksonville, FL",44,54,1,3.0,11/23/2017,"So, we used to frequent a BJ's in San Jose, CA, as it was just down the street from my work. Good food, nice beer, noisy but not unbearingly so. Went to this restaurant for Veteran's Day to take advantage of their Veteran's Complimentary meals. Unfortunately, it was jammed. Waited for about 30 minutes, then were seated. Noise was horrible. Not only was it crowded, and everyone was speaking loudly, but the music was also very loud. I couldn't speak with my wife. Why is that now many restaurants have to blast their music?  Luckily, Kayla, our server, agreed to let us sit outside. It was so much quieter, but being late evening, it was also pretty chilly.  The best part, after enjoying two beers, a pretty good club sandwich and fries, and my wife having two veggie appetizers (vegetarian), Kayla laughed as she presented the check-- $-3.87... The restaurant actually owed us money. She said the manager also shook his head, but there it was. We didn't take any money, but left her a nice tip. She's the reason I gave 3 stars... otherwise it would have been 2. Sadly, I don't think I'm coming back. The loud music turns me off."
Sheila S.,"Jacksonville, FL",4,13,6,1.0,9/22/2017,"Husband and I went for a nice Friday evening dinner, arriving around 7:15. There wasn't a wait and we opted to sit in the patio since it was a nice evening, not too hot. Our server arrived at our table fairly promptly and took our drink order, as well as an appetizer. She delivered our beverages and proceeded to disappear for quite a while. She finally returned to take our order about the time the artichoke dip arrived. It was fine, taste wise, albeit a small portion.  Drinks were replenished, hand-crafted vanilla cream soda and a sweet peachberry iced tea. Both flavorful with unlimited refills. Our food arrived in a timely manner, about the time the mosquitoes arrived and we became dinner for them! We ate our meal and swatted mosquitoes. The food was just ok. A burger and fries and chicken lettuce wraps. The lettuce wraps were disappointing, lacking flavor and no crunch. Husband says the burger was prepared as requested, but nothing to write home about. Same for the fries. Another beverage was delivered to me, but this time the peachberry tea was not sweet. Imagine the surprise my taste buds had with that. Also husbands glass remained empty and was never refilled. With the mosquitoes swarming, we decided it was time to leave. However, we didn't see our sever, or any server for that matter for at least 15 minutes. We were standing by our table when she finally returned to ask about dessert. Needless to say, we declined and asked for our check, explaining about becoming dinner for the mosquitoes. She mumbled something about being sorry and retrieved our check. We had the card ready so we could exit as quickly as possible, which we did. Poor service and mediocre food. Will not patronize this establishment again."
Danny P.,"Phoenix, AZ",56,13,,1.0,9/22/2017,This placed served my girlfriend rotten lettuce on her burger and tacos was well over cooked got here at 9 didn't get served til 1030 this delayed my trip to Orlando
Kalvin K.,"Orlando, FL",429,1218,2657,5.0,7/29/2016,Always a fan of BJs especially during happy hour! Their specials are second to none and I get to enjoy a lot of food for a price that is easy on the wallet! I had great service here with Jen and will likely return if I am ever in the area again.
Cyntoria T.,"Jacksonville, FL",314,64,34,3.0,4/22/2017,"Food was good . it wasn't crowded which was nice . they had good parking and and there servers were attentive. The food was pretty basic. I had the spicy pig pizza. Ingredients were sparce: bacon bits, limited marinara, pickled peppers, hardly no cheese, thin over cooked crust. To go is to pay more for the restaurant experience and less for the quality of food."
Chad S.,"Lake City, FL",36,113,239,4.0,3/26/2017,"Had dinner here with a fairly large crew and family, over 20 people. They got us in fairly quickly, the hostess was very friendly and polite. We sat outside on the patio that a nice large table for 10 with a gas fire in the middle of the table. Pretty cool concept and well executed. Went for a healthier option for food with the Peruvian quinoa salmon bowl. It was very good. Very well-balanced flavor, and good food temperature. I may go to BJ's restaurants more."
Fun C.,"San Diego, CA",255,366,795,5.0,8/1/2016,"I normally like to stay away from chain restaurants, but glad I stopped in to BJ's tonight. Bartender Erick did a bang-up job, and the food was good. Gonna have to come back for more of the appetizer ribs. Fell off the bone good. Recommended"
Bubber J.,"Groton, CT",92,3,2,5.0,4/27/2017,These ribs are the best I ever tasted. They have different flavors available. I got the regular ones. You can also get the Root Beer sauce. I wasn't crazy about it but it wasn't terrible. This place has a large selection of drinks which I believe are brewed by them. They also craft their own sodas. I highly recommend BJ's Brewhouse.
B M.,"Jacksonville, FL",10,63,53,2.0,1/29/2017,"Had a 20 min wait with many tables empty. Their excuse was they were under staffed. Sounds like a management problem.  So we waited for them to seat us.  Ordered drinks in the group 1 got a beer and asked for a frosted mug. No big deal right? Drinks came beer with no mug, really!!  After she drank half the beer the mug came.... smh....  We had five in the group when the food came out one was missing. Come to find out it was never rang up,  again really!!! When we asked the server that the food brought late would be comped she looked confused.  Over all it was ok. Not rushing back anytime soon.  I hope they staff the place with quality servers."
Ben P.,"Marlborough, MA",0,277,,4.0,8/3/2017,"Stopped here for lunch, the menu is pretty big and there are a decent number of healthier options. I had the Mediterranean chicken tacos and they were very good."
Veda Z.,"Jacksonville, FL",2,93,171,4.0,3/8/2017,"Server Lynn (receipt says ""Cynthia"") was very attentive. She was knowledgeable about the menu. I had the calamari and a dirty martini. Food was great and the martini was great. I deducted one star because the martini took a long time to get to the table and it didn't include the traditional olive garnish. The restaurant wasn't so busy (2pm), so I'm not sure what the hold up was at the bar."
David V.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,9,,3.0,2/15/2017,"Place is hit or miss, most time a miss from dirty tables, menus, and floors, to inattentive service and cold food. They could really be great if given the right circumstances, but the place seems mismanaged and hires some of the poorest servers from other failed employment attempts at other local places. The food is very structured so would be chefs come and go. Is ok for a quick lunch but dinner needs a lot of work. The place needs a top down cleaning and replacement of worn out items. 45% chance you will not enjoy your meal."
Todd S.,"St. Augustine, FL",51,142,185,4.0,6/21/2016,"It's a chain folks so review accordingly. The staff here are great, the service solid and it's a completely reliable BJs experience. I love the food, convenience and ease of payment using the app. It's a terrific stop as you head to the airport. The beer is above average for chains and the menu is staggering in scope Just give up the criticism of chains and enjoy an awesome place."
Wil W.,"Fernandina Beach, FL",5,59,7,5.0,7/4/2017,Always enjoy this place.  Craft beer. Quality food. Great atmosphere.  Staff is great.  Download their app and start gaining points to redeem.  Never a bad meal.
Erikka N.,"Jacksonville, FL",199,241,335,5.0,6/7/2015,"I've been to a BJ's before, just not this location. We were seated promptly...it was pretty dead for a Sunday. I'm assuming it will pick up around the time the NBA Finals start. I ordered the ribeye with asparagus and tomato and mozzarella salad as a side. I remembered to take a pic of my salad, but completely forgot about my steak...that's how good it was. It is rare to find such a well seasoned steak under $40.  My husband also got a free pizookie for his birthday."
Erika B.,"Knightdale, NC",4,15,,1.0,7/9/2017,"I seriously don't understand how this place stays in business.  The service is just TERRIBLE!!!!  I have been 3 times, the last time I didn't even stay to eat but I'll get to that.   The first time my family of 4 visited at lunch and they were not busy at all.  After bringing our drinks and taking our order our waitress never returned until the food came out.  Um I wanted to order a drink and was trying to decide, oh well.  The food came we ate, and then we waited.  She came by, we asked for a box, she brought the box and then we waited some for her to finally bring the check.   The second time it was a similar situation but we had 7 people.  We were constantly waiting on a server who was no where to be found.  Or any servers for that fact.   And last time I was seated and we waited 10 minutes and a server never came by.  Never.  I waited tables for years and this is completely unacceptable.  Any good server knows you at least touch the table within 30 seconds, and at the most 1 minute.  We left and went elsewhere.   The hostesses are deplorable.  That should always be my warning sign to show how the service will be.  If I walk in the door and up the hostess stand and there are 3 hostesses standing there talking you should not simply say ""Hi, how are you doing?"" and then turn back around return to your conversation.  Do you job.  Don't look annoyed to see me.  Take care of the customer.  And when I walk out 10 minutes after you sat me, don't look at me and say ""Have a good night.""  That tells me either you are amused I am leaving or you care so little that you don't remember someone's face you just saw.   On a separate occasion involving only my husband, he was with a party on the patio.  He arrived a bit late and everyone else had ordered.  He looked for a server and never found one.  He asked the hostess to find the server, they said they would, but no one ever came.  He ended up going up to the bar to order his food.  So ridiculous.   Never again!  I hope this place goes under and the these servers and hostesses have to find a job at a reputable location that actually holds them accountable for the job because BJ's obviously doesn't."
Diane W.,"Jacksonville, FL",5,4,,1.0,7/21/2017,Went there for a Anniversary last night.  The service sucked and waited for quite awhile.  It turns out they gave our appetizer to a different table!!!  The waitress acted confused the entire time.  After their screw up never offered a discount off our appetizer or anything!!!!
Barbara R.,"Ponte Vedra Beach, FL",0,2,,2.0,10/8/2017,"This was my first visit to BJ's. We were a party of 5. The restaurant was only half full, but we still had to wait 25 minutes to get a table. It took 30 minutes for our food to arrive. Quality of the food was mediocre. Our waitress had no personality. The only redeeming thing about BJ's is the peanut butter s'mores pizookie or whatever you call it. It is crazy good! My advice is to go somewhere else for dinner, and then swing by BJ's for dessert (but you might want to call ahead to put in your order............it might take them awhile to prepare it!!)."
Patti C.,"Palm Coast, FL",15,3,,5.0,5/28/2017,"Great customer service. Friendly and fun atmosphere. Of course I recommend this fun bar, restaurant if you're either on a date or with a bunch off people"
Ellie H.,"Jacksonville, FL",3,20,,2.0,4/26/2017,"Been here twice, and both times there was something terrible about it. As a national chain, BJ's can be nice. Their selection is great and they do have some unique things to eat/drink, as far as what's listed. However, here there is a major problem with the staff and sometimes the kitchens.  The first time I came with my fiance we were meeting up with a couple of friends. Despite the fact that the restaurant was nearly empty, our waitress took so long getting to us (for the order, food, and refills/to check), that we had to go and get our own things from inside. The food was average, but the beer flights were nice (despite taking 30+ minutes to get to the table), and the pizookie's were genuinely too delicious for words, when they arrived an hour later (especially cookies and cream). The management did try very hard to make it right however, which is why we went back to give them the second shot.  The second time around the wait staff was okay (though they did stand around a little watching a spectacle on the road across the street in plain view of the customers)-- but the kitchen staff all rushed out to participate in the spectacle themselves (which was pointed out to us by the staff watching! I really do hope they washed their hands before resuming work after pushing the cars around). I have never seen that happen before, and couldn't begin to guess why that was acceptable. As a result, it took forever to get our food. When we did finally get the food (appetizers were just okay, nothing too special, but there wasn't anything wrong with them either), both of our steaks were beyond well done, though we had ordered them medium. They were tough as dry leather shoes. The asparagus and brussel sprout sides were on the bland/bitter side, but not inedible. The steaks got taken back to the kitchen, and while my steak reemerged okay (nothing to write home about, but tender at least), my fiancees steak came out with heaping piles of gristle, and somehow half very rare (almost raw), and half well done. I have no idea how the same single piece of steak was half cooked, half not, as I've never had one so unevenly cooked before. The management reemerged, but did not do much beyond apologize (no explanation regarding the kitchen staff). We will not be back."
John V.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,2,,1.0,10/4/2017,Stopped here for dinner on the road. Appetizer came no silverware no napkins drinks were slow although there was hardly anyone there they said they were backed up. Finally the steaks came. ordered it medium it was raw sent it back  forever to get back to us. Service was terrible. Then to numb myself I went to the bar to have another glass of wine. The bartender was awful never go back again. Oh and when I ordered the steak I ordered the quinoa brown rice and the waitress didn't know what it was or if they had it
Jeannie S.,"Virginia Beach, VA",0,7,,4.0,4/30/2017,We stopped while traveling North on a Sunday for lunch  We both had the Peruvian Quinoa w grilled shrimp. This dish was superb. All the food on tables looked well prepared and presented. Alesha was our server both efficient and friendly. I totally recommend
Molly G.,"Baldwin, FL",40,2,,2.0,10/28/2016,"This is a chain restaurant that is from far my choice of return restaurants!  Server offered to help with the menu but was to rushed to stay around to help, kitchen was extremely slow with multiple mistakes, appetizers arrived to our table completely wrong not cooked incorrectly but completely wrong food, soup came out after our meal was delivered and hamburger was over cooked.  Management never come by our table even after multiple mistakes. This was our first time visit and will be our last.   Tips for suggestions:  management get out there and get involved take control of this what could be a good establishment."
John R.,"Philadelphia, PA",14,6,1,5.0,2/22/2017,"From upstate NY. Dinner for 5. With kids. Ordered shrimp taco, steak, ahi tuna and wings. EVERYTHING. Was great. I tried the house beers & family had house root beer. Dessert ( pizookie ) to die for. Highly recommended A++. Tiffany our waitress was spot on."
Dyvon G.,"Jacksonville, FL",72,23,,1.0,9/16/2017,"This place was a joke. My waitress Jamilla was excellent. I used to eat here 3 or 4 times a month but never again. Took my wife out to eat and we are rewards members at this restaurant. We ordered $28 prime rib, side salad and asparagus. Over 1/3  of the steak was lard all the way through, so I cut that piece off and showed to my waitress so she  i went and got a manager. My asparagus looked old, almost brown and it appeared to have been chewed and spit out. The waitress brought me brocolli and apologized for the asparagus. Everybody makes mistakes but to see the waitress take ownership showed me leadership quality.  All if a sudden,  here comes the manager,  Holly. She didnt accept responsability for the  bad vegetables or the steak. Instead, I get an explanation  about how all prime rib has fat and it was a bad cut. She says these kind of things happen from time to time. She tells me she can't bring a replacement piece of steak and continues in to say "" Next time you come in  order a center cut piece"" Is she for real,  I just ordered a $28 steak and 1/3 of it was lard and they expect there to be a next time? Sorry Holly but I work hard for my money .  Let me give you a tip. Take responsibility and ownership of your restaurant. Great Managers take incredible pride in the product that leaves the kitchen in their their establishment. Stop making excuses, it only covers the problem that is still there."
Ralph C.,"Jacksonville, FL",259,1,,3.0,7/11/2017,"I love the Fire Roasted Barbacoa Chicken. For only having 520 calories is actually quite filling and tasty. That being said there always seems to be some disappointment at this particular BJ's. Usually it revolves around my friend that is usually with me. Once he ordered the Jambalaya and it came with grossly undercooked chicken. For my own part, I've decided to give up even attempting to ever order the steamed broccoli. They can't seem to grasp the concept of how to steam broccoli. But recently they told me about a policy that finally made me decide to write a review. I don't know if this is a franchise wide practice or specific to this location. But my buddy ordered (or rather attempted to order) the Tuscan Tomato Bisque. We were informed that they don't serve soup in the last hour. To me that just smacks of laziness. I'm reasonably certain it's because they want to get out early so they stop serving soup so they can wash the associated dishes early. If you are open until a certain time you should be prepared to serve your entire menu until that time. The only time specific items on the menu are in the lunch menu. So yeah, not great."
