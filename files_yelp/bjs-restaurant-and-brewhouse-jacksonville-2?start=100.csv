Jill G.,"Jacksonville, FL",24,4,,5.0,2/12/2016,2/10/16 visit: Delicious food. Quan was our server again on this visit and was just as wonderful as our last visit. What an asset he is to B.J.'s. I'm looking forward to my next visit!
John H.,"San Jose, CA",2,20,2,3.0,6/14/2015,Food was up to normal quality but the happy hour deal on apps slammed the kitchen and food orders took a very long time. The bartender was very apologetic though and comped a beer on the tab to make up for it which was appreciated.
Mark B.,"Jacksonville, FL",193,1617,4312,4.0,6/21/2014,"Tonight I was hungry but wanted to watch the world cup. I thought Boston's then I remembered. So BJ's it was. It is also close to the house and I haven't eaten here yet. I have seen the reviews and our daughter said it wasn't very good. What the heck I'm an adventurous kind of guy. I wondered in and the place is as big on the inside as it looks on the outside. I grabbed a table in the bar near a giant TV. I was quickly approached by my server and he told me of some of the things here at BJ's. I took a minute and perused the mammoth menu and when I saw the bison burger. I immediately thought of Allie and her love of bison. That's me and ordered it I did. It also came with some slaw. It was also on the enlighten menu I was told. I guess my server looked at me and figured this fat kid doesn't want anything from the enlightened menu. But, no I went with it and really I'm glad I did. the slaw was made with a something vinaigrette and was really quite yummy. Now the burger was cooked just the way I ordered it. Mid rare and I kind of questioned my server when he asked me. You ordered the bison and that one you can request a temp. I thought I could order any burger to a desired temp. In whole the burger needed some minor seasoning help from some S & P but was very tasty. I did enjoy my meal and would return maybe for another game soon."
Heather P.,"Gales Ferry, CT",46,50,12,3.0,8/8/2014,"Been to this location twice and have experienced it in two different settings - super busy and not so busy. Had a pleasant first trip to see what they were all about since I'm a big fan of Gordon Biersch that we went to in Virginia Beach frequently.  This past time we decided to go since no one could decide on what they would like to have for dinner and I remember BJ's has a ridiculously LARGE and EXPANSIVE menu - personally I prefer smaller menu choices, but in this case it worked in our favor.  Our friends had gotten the table already and I arrived with my in-laws shortly after. We were seated and our waitress, who I assumed gave her name in the beginning encounter of my friends, took drinks orders for only my FIL. She came back and I unfortunately tried to knock my snark towards her when I interjected if she would like to take my drink order rather than assume I want just water. I guess she meant well, but instead of trying to win us over with her over the top personality she could pay attention to more detail in making sure she asked for everyone's order. Her memory is great for reciting back our orders and the food was really good - though I will say that when they have a server who gets their white button down super dirty with food stains that they would ask them to change because she looked super unkempt and unprofessional for their atmosphere they are trying to produce."
J S.,"Fernandina Beach, FL",0,24,,5.0,8/9/2014,"I have been a fan of this chain for several years and was excited to see it come to Jacksonville.  After the usual startup glitches things seem to have settled down.   Service is getting better.  There are some who are just not suited for the fast pace of waiting tables in a chain like this.  Those that can't handle it are gradually being weeded out. Food quality has always been good as it is controlled by the company.  Consistency of dishes stumbled for a few months but the kitchen staff now has that under control.  The menu is large.  Did I say large?  I mean huge.  If you can't find something of interest on the menu, you aren't hungry."
Lina A.,"San Jose, CA",32,75,26,2.0,6/30/2014,"I usually have a good with the other chains in the bay area.  This one here in Jacksonville, FL didn't seem up to par. I ordered the chicken Parmesan and it was alright drowned in sauce, accompanied with a scoop of mashed potatoes and 3 pieces of broccoli. The service was great my waitress was attentive and always had my drink refilled."
Mathieu H.,"Jackson, TN",3,30,12,5.0,2/16/2015,"Food, service and the beer choice !!! Wow everything was perfect, seriously de need BJ's pub in Canada !!!!"
Lloyd G.,"Atlanta, GA",75,5,,2.0,7/10/2015,Great food!! However we saw 2 roaches on our chair!! The huge ones. And when we told our server she just dismissed it as it it happened often..
Kevin L.,"Jacksonville, FL",5,60,77,2.0,4/23/2015,"Was here about 2 weeks ago hamburger was good ,however fries were greasy .change the oil.... Waitress was less then cherryfull. ...not on my list to get back soon........"
Crystal S.,"Norfolk, VA",80,72,490,2.0,3/28/2014,"We decided to give this place a try even after ignoring warnings from previous reviews. We started off with the calamari. It seemed to have been cooked with old oil. I had a couple bites and couldn't really stomach anymore.  My husband had the Atlantic Salmon with rice and mixed veggies. He asked for broccoli instead, but still ended up with the mixed vegetables. The salmon was dry and tasteless; however, the rice and sauce was good.  I played it safe and just ordered the boneless wings. They were  bit dry but OK. I doubt we'll be back."
Craig L K.,"Jacksonville, FL",6,46,,3.0,7/15/2015,Service was much better this visit even with a crowded house on a Friday evening. Food was as expected.
Tosha K.,"Atlanta, GA",93,196,26,4.0,7/31/2014,Not a bad choice for getting in late off a plane. They have a larger variety of food. I sat at the bar and got service immediately.  I ordered the skinny cosmo. ..not bad! Their house salad with balsamic vinegarette Was so fresh and good! The Mahi Mahi wasnt good at all...if I wasnt so hungry I would've sent it back. It was so bland and didnt have much of a taste at all. I will Never order that again. The service was good though!
Ryan B.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,1,,2.0,5/31/2016,"We used to live on the north side and would go to BJ's on a somewhat regular basis. I remember it being so much better than what we experienced yesterday.  We were in the area and stopped in a little bit before 5pm.  It was not busy and we sat at the bar. The staff was friendly, but the food especially for the price was mediocre at best.  We got the calamari, which was probably the worst I've ever had. The batter was falling off almost completely and those that weren't were pretty burnt. I got the salmon and quinoa bowl. The salmon was crunchy on the edges all around and the dish overall really lacked any seasoning. My wife got the ahi salad and it was better than my dish but had a  considerably smaller amount of ahi than before, and the wasabi was ""hidden"" under the lettuce on the side of the plate. That was a nice surprise for her when she got a mouthful of unexpected wasabi. Overall for the price, I don't feel it was worth it and don't see myself returning again."
George H.,"Lexington, SC",1,54,3,1.0,2/6/2014,I have now eaten there three times and all have been rather poor.  Trip 1. Service is very slow. Not attentive to the drinks. Forgot to bring out the salads. The entrees came out first. Hey sometimes you have a bad day maybe tomorrow will be better.  Trip 2. Service is still slow if not slower than before. Two of the party unwrapped dirty silverware. Got the dinner order wrong for one of the party.  Trip 3. Waiter was friendly enough but never kept a good eye on the drinks and he looked like he had too many tables to tend to. Took him way to long to get the food order and one of the dishes was terrible.  The atmosphere is great. The beers are good. I think there is promise in this place but somebody needs to get the service problems resolved or this place will go belly up. I would love to like this place. There is a competitive sports bar nearby where the food is fast and good and the beers are cold but the ambiance is not of the same quality and neither the beer.
Joe W.,"Savannah, GA",16,20,5,1.0,4/18/2015,Unimpressive!  Our server was inattentive and constantly complained about how busy she was despite the entire restaurant being nearly empty. The burgers were bland and they were out of two of the things my kids ordered. I didn't not get to try their beer as I had a long drive ahead of me. Will not be going back.
Brooke N.,"Saint Simons Island, GA",4,135,417,3.0,5/4/2014,"This was our 3rd visit to this restaurant. 2nd visit to this specific location. Service was fast and food was very good. Before leaving I stopped by the ladies room which was totally disgusting. My husband said the men's room was just as bad. If management doesn't resolve this asap, we don't plan coming back. The restrooms are a reflection on a restaurants attitude towards cleanliness. That should be a top priority at every restaurant."
Jasper M.,"San Francisco, CA",1,6,,2.0,3/1/2015,"BJ's, Not as nice as I remember it to be. I travel all the way from San Francisco to visit family and enjoy the warmth and conversations that can be had over the course of a few courses. 3000 miles and there I sat with the impression my meal would be decent. The whole party thought the meal would be decent. It was not, hence 2 stars. The service was far from prompt. The sandwich, a roast beef dip, so simple, so universal, was so awful. Meat served luke warm on an oversized hotdog bun with an overly  churched up cold broth. They strike me as a business with management looking to cut a few corners with little regard for guests pallets and riding on the coat tails of the BJs name. Now this was the second visit in one week. The first being equally as large of a let down. Eat here with low to no expectation."
Ed S.,"Kingsland, GA",0,7,,5.0,11/22/2015,"Flatbread is a go to for me. They have great drinks. And best of all, great sports bar so I can watch all of the games! What more can you ask for?"
Shane S.,"Athens, GA",10,3,,4.0,11/17/2015,The jambalaya is on point. Calamari was great too. Server was slow on drink refills but the food was great.
Ryan H.,"Denver, CO",126,330,193,2.0,12/20/2013,"Average as always except this time was below average. The first waitress took our order after waiting a lifetime for her to come over to us. As she was taking my order she thought it was a good idea to stop and talk to another waitress in the middle of me telling her what I wanted multiple times. She put our order in then apparently they switched servers on us. The first server that took our order never told the second one anything, and on top of it the first server put our order in wrong. So we ended up waiting forever for my g/f to get her beer which came nearly at the end of the meal. They forgot my caesar which also ended up arriving at the end of the meal. Food was alright and I don't remember what we got. I got some kind of pasta. I've had a better experience at the town center spot, but I'm sure the servers were just annoyingly terrible at their job. The food is always pretty average at these places. I'll probably come back at some point since I live in this area, but it's not high on my list."
