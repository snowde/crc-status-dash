Terry M.,"Jacksonville, FL",14,97,7,1.0,3/16/2015,Service continues to be an issue here. This location in particular is incapable of achieving anything near quality service. Don't waste your time.
Chelsea S.,"Jacksonville, FL",229,257,109,4.0,6/1/2014,if your trying to have a nice date this will be a good spot. A whole bunch of beer selection.
Colour D.,"Jacksonville, FL",80,18,4,5.0,8/24/2015,"I always come here to this location, never been to the others but the food here is always great  . Service is always great ! The drinks are good as well ! I've tried a lot of different dishes & I have to say I have yet to be disappointed! My favs are spinach artichoke dip, fried calamari, rib eye steak, pizza"
Don R.,"Jacksonville, FL",443,203,1014,1.0,1/1/2014,"Made the mistake of coming here for lunch.  Unfortunately,  they are out of a huge laundry list of food items...including french fries and mashed potatoes. ..really?  I talked to the manager.  He professed his experience and apologized.  Not quite the response I was expecting, but it doesn't matter now that we won't be coming back."
Wali G.,"Jacksonville, FL",48,14,1,3.0,6/27/2014,Good but the service was slow This is a picture of our order. A bowl of chili and kale and Brussels sprout salad with grilled shrimp 40 minutes after we ordered. The restaurant is empty. (BTW:So is the picture)
Kasey G.,"Jacksonville, FL",216,229,151,3.0,12/27/2014,"A very average experience was had. My entree was mostly flavorless but my fresh mozzarella salad was good. A few people at my table had complaints about their very overcooked burgers. The staff seemed to have recommended all of the worst items on the menu. When asked about one of the fish entrees, the waitor informed us that he preferred fish sticks. I expected better, but should not have, from a large chain restaurant."
Brian P.,"Condemned Bar, CA",2,140,82,4.0,5/18/2014,"I count 40+ taps. Numerous IPA selections. The Tatonka Stout is really good.  Extensive menu.  Happy Hour 3-7 pm. Half priced appetizers, flatbread pizzas, and individual hand tossed pizzas. Draft beer is $1 off as well.  Many TVs for watching the game. Good music but not too loud.  Bartenders were friendly, attentive, quick, and helpful."
P G.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,10,1,1.0,5/20/2016,While the food was good the service sucked. I placed a curbside order and had to wait for 40 minutes for my food and they still got it wrong. Will not be using this location
Rebecca M.,"Jacksonville, FL",39,14,3,2.0,4/15/2016,"I'm getting fed up with BJ's! It is consistently dirty everytime I dine in there and its a shame because the food is good but it leaves me with NO CONFIDENCE in the kitchen if the staff's appearance(black shirts filthy) and the rest of the restaurant is dirty at EVERY visit! I have had old food hanging off the bottom of ""clean"" plates, the outdoor booth we sat next to had food on it so I stared at that throughout lunch, and the menu was just completely DISGUSTING! I don't want to spend my money in a place that doesn't have staff and/or managers to do throurough cleaning in an eating establishment! Its so empty during lunchtime, which would be a perfect opportunity for someone to wipe down EACH OF THOSE MENUS; you can tell they dont get done! Someone else should be going around and checking not just the surface of the booths outside  (which arent even being done)but in between the  cracks because napkins are being shoved in there...its just gross! I hate coming here!"
Kevin J.,"Jacksonville, FL",19,8,,3.0,9/22/2015,Been here a few times. I would much rather prefer a local owned brewer but there are few options around this location. If you have a powerful thirst for craft beer there are many to choose from and they have a few of their own. The atmosphere is open and relatively nice. The service hit or miss. All the items I have had on the menu have been pretty good. Pricing for the entree's are ok but coupled with a few beers it can get expensive. Might be a good place to watch a game plenty of viewing options around the bar. Not sure about drink specials.
Ernest H.,"Jacksonville, FL",18,6,,4.0,5/22/2015,"My wife went for a date night a while back. We sat at the bar and had a few drinks and cocktails with food. Food was great, drinks were too. Bar tender was very personable and had time to talk to everyone at the bar while moving drinks quickly. I will go back... when I have time ha ha. Try the mac-n-cheese balls."
Russell S.,"St. Simons, GA",0,3,,2.0,4/1/2016,"Service was very poor.  Server forgot to put the order in, took forever for appetizer to arrive. Food was cold when it arrived and our starter salads never came. Of course the manager was nice enough to take them off our bill.  First time there and not eager to return."
Misty C.,"Dublin, OH",1,13,12,3.0,1/15/2015,"Usually never have an issue but today I came to this location and brought my boyfriend  for his first time bc I told him how wonderful this place was. Our hostess was wonderful. However, when our waitress showed up she wasn't so pleasant, just kinda stood there and wanted to know what we wanted. He ordered flat bread pizza and she responded with a simple ""we don't have anymore,""so we asked if there was anyway we could have some type of compensation since that's all he wanted and she just flat out said ""no""...not let me see when I can do or let me talk to my manager. NOTHING! So now we have been sitting here for 9 mins with not a suggestion of what she would do instead. I don't want to bash because I really do like this place and she might be having a bad day, but that shouldn't have anything  to do with us."
David F.,"Jacksonville, FL",72,84,,4.0,1/7/2014,"I've been to the River City BJ's Brewhouse a few times and all of my visits have been really good ones.  This location has been pretty busy since opening up last fall, and yet, they always seem to get people seated quickly.  I've never had a wait over 20 minutes, and when we went most recently, we had a party of 6.   With each visit I have been trying their micorbrewed beers.  This time I tried the Hop Storm and it was  really nice.   Also ordered the corn fritters as an appetizer, again, and they are so very good.   I recommend this restaurant to those who have not stopped in yet."
Scott O.,"Westside, Jacksonville, FL",1,10,27,3.0,1/25/2014,"I have eaten at BJ's a few times and I have tried something different each time. However, I have never had anything ""delicious"". I don't drink but if I did, I would probably like it a lot more because they have a wide selection of alcohol. The atmosphere is nice and the booths are very comfortable."
Kevin S.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,10,10,4.0,7/30/2014,Good brewed beer AND other selection. Food was very good. Bartender was friendly and helpful.
Michael M.,"Charlotte, NC",22,3,,5.0,3/28/2015,"Fantastic for a chain! We had mahi mahi tacos, burger, French dip sandwich, and chicken tenders at the table and it was all fantastic. Staff was very fast and kind!"
Zonnetta T.,"Jacksonville, FL",1,3,,1.0,12/24/2015,"Be careful the manager,Darren or Damon, is not too concerned that Latatiana is a very poor server. Food was great: service was well below substandard. Shame on you both! Made our evening less of a bright sparkle at Christmas. I can cook at home , it's the experience I go out for. Shame shame on you both!"
Justin L.,"Jacksonville, FL",2,4,,2.0,4/26/2015,The food was mediocre the beer selection was good but the server killed it.  She spent the entire night talking to her friend who was two tables behind us and neglected the patrons.  Also the dim lighting made it hard to read the menu.
Bob S.,"Jacksonville, FL",19,269,134,3.0,8/5/2013,"Seated quickly, service was a bit spotty.   Ordered the Chicken Fried Steak.  It was pretty good, very tender, but the veggies were over-seasoned.  Meal was delivered by someone who was not my server, which is fine, but there was no silverware on the table, and my server took a few minutes to make it by to see how things were going. Noise level was high.  It was ok, nothing special.  Essentially an upscale Applebee's, with pricing to match."
