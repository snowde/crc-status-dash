Carol C.,"Jacksonville, FL",11,1,,5.0,3/23/2016,"Great food, reasonable prices, and friendly staff.Large menu offering variety of foods from hamburgers to salmon, pizzas and salads, etc."
Clarence T.,"Tallahassee, FL",1,8,2,2.0,10/18/2015,"Tighten up people, The drinks are way too pricey, imagine that, if I try to go out to dinner with my loved one and had three drinks +2 appetizers didn't even get a buzz and spent $65 where they do that at!!"
Steve R.,"Dunedin, FL",35,5,,1.0,10/27/2015,"The worst ever! Waited on silverware for 10 minutes! Asked to see the manager and the guy told me "" You don't want to do that!"".  Ok I said I said I'll  find the manager. Found her at the kitchen, told me they are low on silverware. It wasn't busy. All but told me to F myself when I said we shouldn't have to wait 10 minutes at these prices for silverware. Will never go to any of their restaurants again!"
Melissa N.,"Oxford, MA",3,43,9,5.0,2/27/2015,We ate at this restaurant ordered a different variety of foods we were a party of two adults and one child. Our waiter was very friendly and attentive. The food was not crazy expensive. And the drinks were tasty along with the food which was really good. We would definitely eat here again if we were ever in Jacksonville Florida.
Mitchell M.,"Jacksonville, FL",8,29,40,4.0,12/9/2013,"This review is based on my four visits here so far at this location. Everything inside has a pleasant atmosphere. The wait staff are very friendly and the food is promptly served. The hand tossed pizza is very good, but I tried the deep dish chicken bacon ranch pizza this time and it was the bomb! That's my new favorite.  My son got the clam chowder soup in a bread bowl and he enjoyed it thoroughly. I would have rated it a 5 star if it wasn't for the loaded baked potato my wife received one evening. You think you would get one with all the fixens, but with butter and sour cream only and it was $8. That was a fail. Everything else we've had has been really good. I will try something else next time."
Donna F.,"Wesley Chapel, FL",0,2,,1.0,10/5/2014,"My sister and I went to restaurant on October 4th, 2014. The service is horrible. The wait time for our soft drinks was 20 minute. It was not crowded that should have been an indication. Our waiter was Kyle who ran his mouth so much at each of his tables that when he walked away they started to converse about his unprofessional mannerism. Kyle we don't care if you were offered a 6 year contract nor that you have no central heating/ air in your house. We came to enjoy a meal and the poor food quality coupled with the poor service made a horrible dining experience. Shame on your manager for not coming around especially when people sent their food back!"
Elise H.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,5,,5.0,3/26/2015,"Wonderful food. Great service. Pretty quiet despite being full, some great acoustics in the building. Very accomadating for watching TV, change to whatever channel you want. My husband loves the house made Cherry soda. Recommend: Pizza, clam chowder, jalapeno burger, frito nachos."
Bobbi A.,"McKinney, TX",0,3,,5.0,2/12/2016,"I had a wonderful experience tonight!!! Just called in for a take out and from the get go, the gentlemen that answered the phone was a pleasure! I didn't have the menu in front of me (I was driving) and he talked me through it! FRANKIE was even better in person when I arrived, even called me by name! I'll be honest, I went to this location during football season and was treated like shit and they let my friends daughter (even though they knew she was not old enough) drink!!! I've managed restaurants for years and would be pleased to have this boy as an addition to my family!! And the food was good too!"
Jake R.,"Saint Simons Island, GA",2,4,,4.0,12/31/2014,It's no five star restaurant but it has good food. It has a great atmosphere and a lot of tvs to watch sports games.
Amanda R.,"Callahan, FL",0,2,,1.0,5/16/2015,"Loved this place when it opened and have given them multiple chances to get it right, but I am done. Soup as dessert, waitress too busy playing grab ass to refill drinks, promises to bring parmesan for pizza then walk by 6 or 7 times ignoring our table. This place seriously lacks in service. Food quality is great, so the kitchen has it together but unfortunately that's not enough to bring a once weekly customer back."
Jerry B.,"Jacksonville, FL",1,26,1,1.0,1/29/2015,This was our first time at BJ's brewhouse and will probably be our last time. Was shocked very slow on a Wednesday afternoon but yet service was horrible waiter kept disappearing. He finally took our order food came out in about 10 minutes but I wife's ribs were lukewarm at best. I ordered scallops scallops were cold and and chewy. It took us longer to pay the bill than  to get our food and eat because once again we could not find our waiter.
Savannah W.,"Boynton Beach, FL",0,8,,2.0,12/27/2015,"I've been to BJ's before and the food quality is below average. The pot stickers were good but for my entree I ordered the kale and Brussel sprout salad and added grilled shrimp. It's pretty hard to mess up a salad but they managed to do it. The Brussel sprouts were soggy and didn't have and crisp. There wasn't any kale at all in the salad. It was made up of predominantly ice burg lettuce and a few pieces of arugula. The ""grilled"" shrimp was clearly not grilled. It didn't even have grill marks. It want fresh and seemed like it was microwaved. I know it's a chain and all but for the prices, it would be nice for them to at least attempt an edible level of food quality."
Joseph R.,"Jacksonville, FL",1,6,1,2.0,5/19/2014,"Me and my family went to celebrate Mothers day. The place was pretty busy that evening, and we were told it would be a 30-40 minute wait. I'd say we were seated after about 45 minutes.  It took our waiter about 5 minutes to introduce himself to us. He apologized and said he had a lot of tables to take care of.  Our salads and dinners came out pretty fast, considering how busy they were.  However, the salads were dry.  Seemed like they put on very little salad dressing on them.  And my mother's dinner came without rice pilaf, in which their excuse was that they had just run out very, very recently.  They were also out of one of their two types of french fries that they serve, which our server did alert us to that fact during our order, to his credit.  But seriously, what else are they 'running out of?' I really want to like this place, as it was the second time I've been here (the first time was a better experience).  But reading the reviews here, and then with my own experience, it's hard for me to recommend this place to anyone else."
Wanda V.,"Bristol, PA",0,11,1,5.0,9/5/2015,The best gluten free pizza I've ever tasted! I've been there twice & both were consistenly delicious. Their entire menu looks great.
Amanda N.,"Jacksonville, FL",100,171,413,2.0,2/23/2014,Was not impressed. The jambalaya was mediocre. The service was a joke. The beer I had was the only good part about the experience there. I was really excited when it opened to have a brew house in the area. But I'll jus go to riverside bc this place sucked
John G.,"Norfolk, VA",59,39,16,2.0,4/17/2014,A better decorated Applebee's.  Mediocre food combined with slow and inaccurate service.   I ordered a soup and was not provided a spoon.  Ordered a salad with dressing on the side and was not given dressing.  Seems to be the place where waiters are trained on your dime and time.
Mike G.,"Jacksonville, FL",72,4,1,1.0,4/17/2014,"Came here the other night and it was ok. Came back again and the service was horrible. The waiter forgot drink orders, and the food order was screwed up. Will not be back again."
Matthew K.,"Port Orchard, WA",0,4,,1.0,11/11/2015,Veterans Day 2015 tried to eat here and take advantage of their special for military vets and was very disappointed to see that there was a 45 min wait and over 30 tables available. Questioned the manager about it and she stated that they didn't have enough staff to take care of the customers. HUGE FAIL. Mismanagement at it's finest.
Rebecka B.,"Fernandina Beach, FL",1,26,2,2.0,1/10/2015,"Had dinner last night. Very surprised that drink prices were not on the menu, nor listed anywhere. The server was slow to get to us. Another server finally noticed and took a drink order. Our server brought the drinks. We ordered 2 salads and a small pizza. All of our food came at the same time. It tasted decent. Our server never checked to see how the food was or if we needed anything. He did keep trying to pick up dishes while we were still eating. The first time, I told him no. The second time, I was literally holding a piece of pizza eating it, and he took the plate. Really? We got our bill.... $5.95 for a draft and $6.75 for a house brand, vodka and tonic. No wonder they don't put the prices on the menu!!! Been there... done that.... Won't go back!"
Ed J.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,4,,4.0,1/10/2015,"Stopped in for lunch today.  I was reluctant to do so.  I had been to this location one time before back when they first opened and wasn't impressed.  Well they have the kinks worked out now.  Got a bowl of broccoli cheddar soup and it was awesome.  Actual broccoli pieces, not specks.  Very cheesy and creamy.  Also had the California burger.  Meat was cooked perfectly and seasoned just right.  I would definitely go back for that!  I'm going to add this place back into my list of regular spots."
