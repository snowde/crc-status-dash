Mark H.,"Jacksonville, FL",50,8,3,5.0,9/23/2015,Always friendly genuine service for us when we go here.  Great atmosphere and some really good ap and beer specials during college and pro games.  Can't go wrong here. Nice menu variety as well. something for everyone.
Jeff T.,"Jacksonville, FL",5,84,17,5.0,5/27/2014,Always so busy!  Always great food!  Shame it can be loud due to design of restaurant.
Allison C.,"Groton, CT",108,12,,4.0,3/5/2014,"The food is nothing extra special, but the service and beer are GREAT. Great selection of beer- the Nutty Brewnette is my favorite. I am a huge fan of sauces, and I tried their garlic aioli on the side with my fries- so good! Our server was very attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable about the beers. Definitely a great place to go if you are into craft beers and casual food!"
Kelly J.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,3,,3.0,8/16/2015,"First of all, I'd start off by saying that the food was great. The menu was very descriptive and included a lot of pictures and choices. They have a great beer selection as well. BUT the service was horrible...the place wasn't packed, there were only 3 tables outside so i dont thibk they were overworked or that the kitchen was busy... Our server came to our table and her white shirt was disgusting and stained along with the apron. Maybe she had been working all day but it looked like she just doesn't wash her clothes. We ordered appetizers right away (calamari and avacado egg rolls) we waited about 10 minutes to order our dinners... after 20 minutes with just drinks, our appetizers were put on the table by food runners. All we had were little plates. NO UTENSILS OR NAPKINS. We started to eat anyway and within less than 5 minutes our entrees came out by the food runners...we hadn't even made a dent in the appetizers. Yet still no utensils or napkins...so we asked the food runner for utensils and napkins and to send a manager since there was still no sign of our server. Manager comes with the server and we explained what happened. All we wanted was  utensils so we could eat! I had just moved to the area yesterday and wanted to go out to eat with my parents. Although the food was amazing, bad service can ruin your entire experience..."
Rumi M.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,6,4,3.0,5/2/2014,My husband love handcrafted Piranha Beer. Happy hour 50% off appetizer and mini pizza. Flatbread Pepperoni Extreme was great but my favorite appetizer is chicken pot stickers.
Bart M.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,3,,2.0,11/16/2014,I have been three times. The food is pretty decent but the service is absolutely terrible every time. Hoping the service would improve since they have a nice beer selection.
Nicholas A.,"Miami, FL",24,6,4,4.0,2/21/2014,Best option if you're on a business trip and want to watch sports and have a few drinks; which was the case for me. I've been to a couple of these and the food is always great regardless of location.
K S.,"Williamsburg, VA",0,26,14,4.0,5/22/2015,Food was amazing !! Service was awful. Literally our guy had the worst personality and it took forever to get our food on a Tuesday night when it wasn't very crowded but the pizzas were amazing. Kids eat free Tuesday helped too. Better service could have earned this place 5 stars
Chelsea W.,"Nashville, TN",83,228,16,4.0,9/21/2013,Visited this BJ's brewhouse while on a business trip in North Jax and I'm happy to say it did not disappoint!  I've been to the Orlando location many times so I pretty much knew what to expect but even chains can have their hit or miss locations.  I was pretty bummed they did not have their pumpkin beer until October (i visited in late Sept) but the Octoberfest was excellent so give that a try.  The buffalo chicken pizza is eh...i've had better and I've had better items at BJ's before so I'd say skip it.  The outdoor seating at this location is pretty nice with some big TV's to watch sports so i enjoyed that.  My server was a little overwhelmed... I think she had ALL of the outside tables by herself but she still was just the right amount of attentive to me and never showed a bad/stressed attitude so I really appreciated that.
Diana M.,"Jacksonville, FL",91,866,,4.0,9/4/2013,"The food at BJ's is better than the average chain.  They have lots of options and I find it hard to narrow down the selection into a category, then into a meal!  The service at this locations is a little bit slow but I think they are still working out the kinks of a new restaurant."
Lisa R.,"Jacksonville, FL",100,14,,4.0,1/8/2014,"Love having Lunch here, the Buffalo Chicken Mini Pizza is delicious!, also the hamburgers are worth coming here"
Bob C.,"Altamont, NY",3,7,59,5.0,9/17/2013,"The seared ahi salad (under their En-light-enment menu) was the best I've had. The greens were towered, they included avocado and crisps, and then layered square-cut tuna on all three sides of a tricornered plate. Dressing, tomatoes etc. all good."
Steve R.,"Hagerstown, MD",0,22,,3.0,10/10/2013,"Had an ok experience primarily due to the noise level.  5:30 PM, restaurant not even half full and the music was blaring loud enough that we could not have a decent conversation at our table.  Request was made to lower the volume and it was lowered just a bit.  Manager's explanation?  The music helps in keeping conversations from being overheard at other tables/booths.  New one on me.   Food quality was good.  Misunderstanding between the waitress and one at our table at order time led to one sandwich having to be replaced.  Food was hot and served at the same time.  Only glitch was one cup of coffee was luke warm at best while others were steaming hot.  Can't figure it out since each cup is brewed individually. We probably won't go back just because of the noise level."
T V.,"Key West, FL",0,15,,4.0,2/12/2014,"One of the best steak salad presentations I've experienced. Waitress was knowledgable about the in house beer selections and was attentive with good intervals. Near the top tier a ""chain"" establishment."
John L.,"Kenosha, WI",2,29,2,3.0,8/15/2013,"Dinner on a Thursday night, very busy around 6, but was able to squeeze in at the bar with no wait. Servers were very friendly. Had the full flight of 8 beers surprisingly good compared to many other brew pubs I've been to, even the styles I typically don't care for were quite drinkable, the only exception being the stout which was a bit on the bitter side. The only dissapointment were the chicken wings having ordered the XXXX-hot I expected to at least break a sweat but in all honesty they were milder than the spicy chix sand at the clown's drive through. The bartender offered a couple hot sauces and a side of jalepenos to compensate, lol, even with the additional heat I'd consider these kid friendly. For a $9.50 app they were also surprisingly small. The burger however more than made up for it. Had the bacon blue cheese burger which was a good size burger perfectly cooked to medium rare. Next time I'd skip the app, but definitely worth a repeat visit for both the beer and the food if this was any indication of the rest of the menu."
