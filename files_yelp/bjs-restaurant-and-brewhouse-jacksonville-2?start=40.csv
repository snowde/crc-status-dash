Sam W.,"Apopka, FL",342,7,,5.0,5/21/2017,"The food and drinks are amazing here. It was my first time and I'll definitely be back. If you are lucly, ask for Anthawn because his service exceeds expectations."
Crystal M.,"The Woodlands, TX",31,2,,1.0,5/6/2017,Was told they could not accommodate my family. We flew in from Texas for my father's military retirement ceremony and wanted to grab a nice dinner. There was 13 of us and I called way ahead to be told they did not have enough servers to accommodate us....at any time that evening.
Maya C.,"Jacksonville, FL",207,524,2099,4.0,11/30/2014,"This is the first time I've been to BJ's and I heard mixed reviews about it. Since it was such a beautiful day we decided to sit outside.  In no time, our server came and we ordered drinks. My mother got a Raspberry Lemonade and I got a Berry Burst Cider. I love trying different kinds of ciders and this one got my attention because I hadn't had a cider made from raspberries, blackberries and other wild berries. It was refreshing. Mom always enjoys her lemonade. We ordered the Spinach and Arichoke dip, which seems to be the go-to appetizer for us. There was clearly more chips than dip which I think is a total waste but it is what it is. The dip was ok, nice big chunks or artichoke pieces in it.  For our entrees, I got the Barbeque Bison Burger and had the option of a House, Caesar, or Mozzarella Tomato salsa. I chose the last one. My mother ordered the Black and Bleu House Burger. Our entrees were taking a long time and our server was so proactive about it. He notified us that there was a party of 20 ahead of us and ours would be coming out after that our was done. When he brought my salad he also chased and swatted a bee away from our table? So brave hahaha. The mozzarella and tomato salad was very good. I love how the cheese was shaped into little balls. Cute. A few minutes later our burgers came out. Both looked delicious. Mom's burger came with bacon which she didn't like. She gave it to me which I happily ate. Her burger only came well done and she's used to having it medium-well, but she ate it and said it was good. My burger was good as well but not as good as Ted's bison burgers.  If we're back in the area, we'll definitely consider stopping by BJ's. Kudos to the server willing to take a bee sting for us!"
Marie F.,"Lantana, FL",227,903,3383,3.0,9/14/2015,"I'm somehow 3 hours early to pick someone up at the airport. (Wrote 11a - should have been 1p). Decided to grab lunch since I skipped dinner and was in the area. I'm place a drink order and then completely forgotten. I'm seating almost 30 minutes writing away in my journal without a soul approaching. If my pen hadn't ran out of ink I might have never know.  I skip out of here now starving and decide to grab some quick bites that I stash to watch a movie. (I'm truthful lol.)Leaving the airport, my guest discusses his horrible flight that had him going over 8hrs across 3 times zones with a 15 minute rushed layover because of late plane. He was hungry and ready for a drink. I thought we might as well try this place again since I'm rarely in the area.  After dumping some layers of clothes, he decides to eat outside. He gets something from the tap. I grab water with lemon and wait to see if this will be a repeat of non existent service from earlier. It wasn't. Avocado Egg Rolls and Stuffed Mushrooms were awesome. He had Jalapeño Burger with bacon and said it was pretty sweet. I was too stuffed for dessert and he rather try craft. He enjoyed both his meal and drink. And we both enjoyed the service.  That's strange. When it was empty I was completely looked over? When it was busy and I have company - great service, quick and good food. But I couldn't help to notice while we chatted away and picked over our food that many annoyed faces from other tables that were probably annoyed by their servers and/or have terrible wait. Maybe this was a bad day?"
Paul M.,"Jacksonville, FL",14,20,,3.0,2/17/2017,Nice place to visit every few months. On the pricey side. It does have a good variety of dishes. It does get full on the weekends. Alcochol is also on the pricey side. Not good for your wallet buy does have decent food.
John R.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,2,,5.0,9/19/2016,Excellent food and service was exceptional. Will certainly  be back! Recommend the French dip sandwich very tender and cooked to pefection. The staff was friendly and prompt!
David G.,"Springdale, AR",59,169,180,5.0,10/23/2016,How dare this only be 3 star overall. Sat at bar and staff was amazing. Ordered the root beer ribs and a flatbread pizza...it was happy hour and they were all half price so I walked out of there with a check so low I had to double take. The flatbread pepperoni was good....BUT...if you don't order the root beer ribs appetizer and claim to be a ribs connoisseur...you need to take a step back...they are epic...nice crowd..great food...a zillion brews...a must stop imho.
David O.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,6,,1.0,7/25/2016,"I was stunned to go in to take advantage of the very frequently advertised 1/2 off large pizza day (Mondays) and be served the driest deep dish pizza ever made.  I would rate this up there with a Dominos Meat pizza with absolutely no sauce whatsoever, and at a premium cost.  Unfortunately I brought this to friends and now I feel so bad, I'm thinking about buying them a pizza from another restaurant to make up for our horrible meal. Unfortunately, I'm not close enough for the restaurant to offer me another shot at a pizza, but George the manager promised to take a better look at quality control. Odd thing is:  I've been to BJs in Tallahassee and brought pizza back from there to Jacksonville on more than one occasion and its always been delicious.  Bad timing, bad night, bad cook I guess.  Check your food out before leaving!"
Samuel C.,"Jacksonville, FL",32,49,12,3.0,6/19/2016,"Terrible steak, I asked for a medium rare, first they gave me a well done steak then the second attempt was a medium. It was close enough but still tasted okay. If you're looking for a steak dinner don't come here.  Service after 10 pm is also okay, they gave me a side salad, and I had to wait for utensils to eat with."
Ellen C.,"Oakland, CA",148,710,23,4.0,10/24/2015,"There are plenty of dining options in the area, especially if you're looking for a chain. BJ's is considered a chain too since it started in CA but it's one of the better ones. I would put it in the camp of Cheesecake Factory or California Pizza Kitchen. The food is always good and they have a wide variety of drinks if you're looking to try some new beers/ciders/wines. They're reasonably priced for the food and their HH is pretty good - half off appetizers and mini pizzas.  I ordered the balsamic chicken with cheddar mashed potatoes and got a pear cider to pair with it. Both were delicious! The balsamic chicken was a bit on the sweet side and the chicken could've been moister but all in all it was delicious when you ate all the components on the plate together. It also came with a small frisee salad which helped tone down the indulgent feel of the meal. What made the dish on the sweeter side was the balsamic glaze which was super sweet, but the savoriness of the chicken and mashed potatoes really helped it balance out. The pear cider was also pretty tasty and we were able to sit outside on the patio, watch some baseball, and enjoy some FL sun. I would definitely say that if I'm in the area again I'd come back for a reliable meal! It's nice to have somewhere you can count on for consistently good food and friendly, happy staff."
Matt R.,"New Orleans, LA",521,512,289,1.0,5/20/2015,"We were there for 15 minutes.  We sat down and the server hastily told us she'd be back... well, she never came back. We weren't really greeted and the server just never came back... so we left!  BOTTOM LINE: We came hungry... and left hungrier!"
Alexis S.,"Middleburg, FL",115,10,2,2.0,12/23/2016,Food wasn't very good. Server was nice and took my food back and took it off the bill. Was hoping it was really good by the way the restaurant looks but was kind of disappointed. Ordered mahi & shrimp that was served in a bowl grease.
Karen A.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,3,,5.0,1/13/2017,"I've been here several times and have never been disappointed. Their happy hour specials are hard to beat. Service, food and drinks are top notch!"
Mark J.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,21,1,2.0,2/25/2016,Food was good. Service absolutely stunk. From the hostess to the server. Very unfriendly and slow in all aspects. It took 20 minutes before our order was taken.  Someone in our party ordered French fries and no Ketchup was offered. Once we asked it took 5 minutes to get it. Drinks from the bar never showed and we were told the bar was running slow due to so many orders.  We've been here several times and this continues to be their theme.
Carlie A.,"Myrtle Beach, SC",60,20,18,5.0,12/18/2016,Wow variety! 15 page menu and everything on it unique. The food was fantastic and the service was spectacular! I had the seared ahi salad and just wow. I will definitely be coming back here when I'm in town.
A T.,"Jacksonville, FL",1,12,,5.0,6/19/2017,"Simply put... Great food and some of the best service ever! We sat in the cocktail section and our waiter was Gary, who's normally a bartender. His customer service was exceptional. Whenever we come back (because definitely we will) I know we can look forward to greatness."
Jamie V.,"Jacksonville, FL",113,197,308,4.0,2/22/2015,"BJs is definitely proof of giving a restaurant a second chance.  I previously visited the BJs at the Town Center and was less than impressed so did not return.  I then came to the City Station location for a quick lunch before a flight and lunch and enjoyed it.  For lunch, I had the honey chicken salad.  It was as expected and filling without being too heavy before I boarded the sardine can in the sky.  Cue last night when an evening of shopping left my mother and I hungry. We arrived around 7pm. The restaurant was packed and I seriously doubted the quoted 15 minute wait time.  At 20 minutes our buzzer went off and I was pleasantly surprised. We started with mozzarella sticks because I had been craving them. For $8 we got 10 large mozzarella sticks, fried beautifully and crunchy topped with shredded parmesan cheese.  My craving was well satiated. For dinner, mom had the fried chicken and wedge salad.  The salad was a big hit with large blue cheese crumbles, bacon and tomatoes.  Her chicken was nicely fried and a very generous portion. She took half of it home. I chose the balsamic glazed chicken and seriously enjoyed my dinner.  The chicken was nicely grilled and served with salad greens, onions, the balsamic sauce and mashed potatoes.  The balsamic sauce was sweet, tangy, and I was dipping chicken along the edges of the plate to get more. So yummy.  Shout out to the cheddar mashed potatoes. Obviously homemade and probably tons of cream and butter which made them very creamy and so good I didn't want to stop eating. I also took home half my meal because of large portions. Our server was Kate and she was just great. Efficient, personable, and attentive without being intrusive.  A large party was seated in her section and she stopped by her tables asking if they needed anything before she started the large party because her attention wouldn't be as available for a little while.  Classy move, Kate.  You're a great server."
Britney J.,"Jacksonville, FL",71,73,488,2.0,12/30/2016,"I'm amending my review from a few days ago to give a quick update and bump my rating up by a star. I want to give some credit where credit is due. Yesterday, I received a call from the general manager of this location. Now, as I stated in my first review, I had previously talked to a manager and she didn't even ask me for my name or phone number to follow up with me. I only received the call from the GM after filling out a survey that BJ's sent me directly via email about my experience that night. The other manager I spoke to initially didn't even notify the GM of my complaint. The conversation that I had with the general manager was a good one, and he sincerely apologized for my experience, and assured me that the issue has been addressed. We spoke for about 6-7 minutes, which is in stark contrast to the ten seconds that the other manager had me on the phone. He sent me a $25 gift card to use at BJ's as well. That's literally all I wanted, for my issue to be verbally addressed with the employee and for me to be reimbursed for my meal. As I said previously, I don't spend my hard earned money at a restaurant to have my non-black server say racial slurs, especially n****r. In the end, I'm satisfied with the response that I received, and I really and truly respect and thank the general manager for calling me directly to address the situation. If I had received such a response from the first manager I spoke to, I'm sure I'd feel a little differently than I do now. Although I appreciate the GM's sincerity and professionalism, I shouldn't have had to fill out a survey for someone to address the issue. I tried to go up the chain of command before posting my review here and before filling out that survey, but that method failed me. This could have all been dealt with in-house. My intention has never been to get anyone in trouble, or worse, fired, but I did want to make sure that it didn't happen again and that my voice was heard. I'm usually a pretty chill customer, and I don't really complain much, even when the food I order isn't all that. I've actually never asked to speak to a manager with an issue at a restaurant in my entire life, until now. So when I do speak up, it's about something that is important to me. In the end, I can sleep well knowing that the situation was ultimately resolved as it should have been in the first place, but I still have a bitter taste in my mouth regarding my whole experience with this BJ's location. I most likely won't be back."
Kenneth B.,"Jacksonville, FL",52,15,1,3.0,11/27/2016,"Beautiful restaurant.  Very friendly service.  The spinach stuffed mushroom appetizer is delicious.  Unfortunately, the cook on duty this night only cooks steaks well-done.  I asked for medium.  I was served leather.  The manager comped half the price of my entree.  I didn't argue because I was on a date and the server was so nice.  I left a good tip.  It wasn't her fault that her co-worker in the back needs better training."
Colleen S.,"Boynton Beach, FL",0,25,9,4.0,11/27/2016,"We stopped here on our way home. The pizza is fresh, thin crusted pizza. It was tasty! I got quinoa and veggies, good for a healthy eater:)"
