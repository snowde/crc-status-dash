Larry W.,"Jacksonville, FL",211,280,621,4.0,3/19/2015,I've been here before for the beer but last night was our first time for dinner since the relocation. The scenery was nice and cozy. We both had steak..I thought it was a tad small but it made up in taste. I had a Ceasar salad and the my Queen had a house salad. Service was excellent as were the drinks. I had a nice Stout and she had a nice mixed drink . One the list.
Jorge Carlos R.,"Jacksonville, FL",5,4,14,5.0,2/26/2016,"Good food. I'm really food critic because a like the food I'm paying for it's really good, friendly staff. The only issue I experienced was they took to long to bring me the brew when the restaurant wasn't that busy. But beside that for me it's 5 star restaurant. Thanks for a good food."
Laurie B.,"Columbus, NC",6,172,9,3.0,9/14/2016,"Service was fast, accurate, and friendly.  Got mini pan veggy pizza.  It arrived quickly considering what it was.  Unfortunately it was mostly just a thick round piece of white bread with some veggies and a little cheese.  Lacked flavor or crispness which pan pizzas tend to have (which is why you blow the extra calories for them) .  Not what I had anticipated.   Had the traditional wings as well.  This is a bar place, they should be good, right?  Soggy and Buffalo sauce quite salty.  Seriously, a chain bar putting out THIS level of wings?!  No excuses for it.  I've seen this chain in many locations, never tried it, won't do so again."
Tom G.,"Marietta, GA",38,11,1,5.0,9/21/2016,Great happy hour ... great bar tender ...  Looking forward to my next visit to Jacksonville
Rosanna S.,"St Augustine, FL",19,272,632,5.0,6/21/2016,I I had the jambalaya and my husband had the steak this evening. All the way around excellent. The meats were prepared perfectly and the jambalaya was good and spicy. They were able to accommodate my request for extra sauce in the jambalaya with no problem. My husband said that the steak was the best he had had in awhile. We both had the Hefeweizen beer because we both enjoy the strong banana flavor. It is one of my favorites lately. We happen to be loyalty card holders here and it's nice when they greet you by name when you check in at the hostess stand. All of the servers are very knowledgeable about what they are providing. They make you feel very welcome. This was one of the better evenings that we've had out in a while. We will definitely make more stops here.
Stacy L.,"Jacksonville, FL",26,98,23,3.0,10/21/2015,"Came here yesterday. Chile verde fries were decent but not hot, so that was kind of blah. It was overly freezing in the restaurant and they have floor lights so I felt like every time I looked to my right I was being blinded. I had to put a menu on the floor. My husband had the chicken wings, they were okay And I had the salmon. Also just okay.  Over priced for mediocre food. Good beer though."
Bijal P.,"Ontario, CA",0,16,14,1.0,4/2/2017,Took 15 mins to get water and 50 mins to get appetizer...1.30 mins to get the pizza. They said they're running slow and there are only 5 guests in the restaurant! Slowest service ever and food wasn't that great. Not at BJs level. The soup was too oily and pizza just tasted Nasty and I usually eat at BJs at least 2-3 times a month.
Miranda K.,"Modesto, CA",0,7,,2.0,9/23/2016,"If you are on your lunch break, skip this place. The service is super slow. I ordered a salad and have been here for 25 minutes... I have a 30 minute lunch break."
J. J.,"Jacksonville, FL",7,150,72,4.0,10/23/2015,Service was good and wasn't too crowded for lunch during the midweek time. Food was great. Had the potstickers for the app and they were very good. The tacos were good and I had a new chicken dish that was excellent. This was my first time there and I will be back. They have an extensive drink menu and plenty of seating. I will try for dinner soon.
Charlene W.,"Jacksonville, FL",7,16,25,3.0,1/1/2016,Trying it again and this time I brought my son.  He got the black and bleu-house burger and I got the Brewhouse burger.  We came during lunch and it was pretty full.  We received both burgers hot!  The wedge fries are good. Service was good.
Pam S.,"Senoia, GA",13,28,52,2.0,7/2/2016,"I ordered the glazed salmon, and my husband had a cheeseburger (sans cheese, as they forgot to add it). Overpriced mediocre food. I wouldn't recommend eating here unless you have quick access to a restroom, as my husband and I both went running for one within 30 minutes of leaving the restaurant."
Jay S.,"Savannah, GA",34,4,,1.0,3/23/2017,"Not good,  food came out cold, the server was bad, she didn't know menu. What a waste of 80.00. Will not be a return customer."
Sanovia P.,"Bowie, MD",1,31,9,2.0,8/19/2016,I had the jambalaya as recommended by the very nice waiter. He was very Profesional but I didn't care for the dish. It was super salty for me. I would go back to watch a game on the big screen and try another dish. We enjoyed ourselves.
Kassidy L.,"Jacksonville, FL",37,22,,4.0,9/18/2016,"Food is subpar in my opinion, but my boyfriend LOVED his burger and wouldn't stop talking about it for days. The waitstaff are lovely and the atmosphere is really cool, it's very art Deco and feels like you're in a different world. The draft sodas are where it's at."
Bobby L.,"Nashville, TN",16,3,,1.0,5/13/2016,"First visit, GF ordered chicken Alfredo and they gave her shrimp Alfredo after telling them she was definitely allergic to shrimp.  Second visit, we were seated in 10 mins on a busy Friday but waited 20 mins for a menu then another 20 to order drinks and another 10 until we were told our waiter will be with us in a few mins.  By then we just got up and left.  This visit, wasn't busy at all.  Still waited 30 mins to be seated.  15 mins until we order drinks and appetizer.  Appetizer came first with no utensils, plates, or drinks. We sat down at down at 9pm.  Currently 10pm and still haven't got our entre.  People next to us arrived after us, seated before us and are already getting to go boxes.  Worse service in river city restaurants. Don't bother."
Giannabrie F.,"Charlotte, NC",166,371,4,3.0,7/31/2015,"For a chain this place wasn't that bad.  I agree with several of the reviews that the service was meh but the overall experience was a-ok.  The menu was huge which I'm not a fan of.  Too many options.  Haven't they heard the expression...jack of all trades, master of none? It was very cheesecake factoryish if u know what I mean.  I ordered the Greek pita with chicken.  I had the brussel sprouts for my side.  The pita was good, the brussel sprouts were rather gross.  My manager ordered the pig lovers flatbread which was very good.  We also ordered the dessert.  It was a trio of various cookies warmed with a scoop of icecream on top.  Delish!! We tried the triple chocolate with vanilla icecream, salted caramel and cookies and cream.  They were all very very tasty!!! Crowd pleaser! Prices were reasonable and no wait during lunch hour so I would come back."
Ken D.,"North Bay Village, FL",327,333,186,1.0,5/14/2015,"Wow. Slowest service ever. Waited 15 minutes for a martini brought incorrectly. Waited 20 more for it to be remade. I wouldn't mind if this was while they were slammed, but it is 5:00 pm and the place is empty. I feel like I'm aging faster than normal. My favorite part (sarcasm implied) is the absence of prices on their cocktail menu. Happy Hour was a whole dollar off. Sorry, BJ's, there's nothing happy about that. In a world where Denny's gets a composite review of 4-stars, is this as good as it gets?"
Luz W.,"Pearl City, HI",1,5,,1.0,8/14/2016,I am being generous by giving this location 1 star. We waited over 1 hour and 15 minutes for our food as everyone around us just got served before us after getting there after us. I will not come here again. I also just received my chicken that was so salty that it had to be sent back. This place is just awful.
Greg S.,"Sanderson, FL",14,29,42,3.0,4/27/2016,Menu is huge. I normally get the spicy jambalaya. Need to get more adventurous on craft beer tap selection. Casual dining and service was slow but friendly. Food was average.
Allison K.,"Ho-Ho-Kus, NJ",0,7,,5.0,7/9/2016,My experience was great! The food was delicious and the service was awesome. My daughter did not care for the dish she got (a little spicy for her) and the waitress immediately removed the item off of the bill and asked if she wanted anything else. I would definitely recommend this restaurant!
