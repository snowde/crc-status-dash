D R.,"Ashford, CT",0,12,1,4.0,7/9/2016,"I stopped in Jacksonville after 14 hours in the car. I had never heard of BJ's so decided to give it a try. I was driving solo so grabbed a small table in the bar area. I sat for about five minutes with no service so moved to the bar. Once seated I was promptly served the house red ale which was most excellent. I had Brussels sprouts and a Mahi- Mahi/shrimp dish which was really quite good. The shrimp were served the way they should be in a dish, no tail shell attached.  The food was very good and the bar staff, three folks, were outstanding. They chatted amicably and made me feel very welcomed. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone passing thru. A tip- if you're looking for something a little unusual give the whole menu a good look."
Mari O.,"Yulee, FL",1,9,,5.0,4/15/2016,"This is our favorite restaurant.  Very good food & nice location.  Staff are all wonderful & awesome.  The place is so classy & clean, a very good dining place for businessmen, families & friends get together.  This place should be ranked top of all in North Florida."
George D.,"York, SC",106,340,109,4.0,7/17/2014,"Ate here for lunch. Waitress was very friendly and very responsive.  Our drinks were constantly kept full - actually, they don't refill, they bring a fresh glass each time - even for water! I got a gluten free menu, could use some work.  It isn't really a menu as much as it is a guide to what on the regular menu has gluten, dairy, etc.   The pizza was very good.  I would like to go back for dinner sometime given the extensive beer offering."
Ashante G.,"Culver City, CA",0,18,2,3.0,6/24/2016,"Went here last week. Service was ok, we had Quan. I asked for my poke w/o sesame seeds numerous times and didnt get it. Jamabalya and our pizza was pretty mediocre.  Happy hr started 30mn before we got there yet we werent given the chance to indulge  even though it was really empty. Would go back if i were starving but not worth 80 bucks."
Shannon C.,"Jacksonville, FL",8,5,,1.0,3/12/2015,"I have eaten here numerous times since they have opened and I have never once left satisfied. We either have a server we never see, our food comes out wrong, my husband's food comes out and mine is 15 minutes behind or its over/undercooked.  Take today for instance, I order Togo online. Something I thought would be very hard to mess up because it's an online order and it wasn't in person at the restaurant. Well I ordered a salad and took off something and added a new cheese, honestly it's hard to mess up a salad so I thought I would be fine. Well no I was wrong. I got home and opened my salad only to see that I didn't have any dressing. What to go worker doesn't put dressing in with an order? I was so angry. I called and asked to speak to a manager. He apologized and wanted to correct it, which is great. But it's really annoying that I have never had a good experience at this location.  I do NOT recommend this restaurant to anyone. Unless you don't mind messed up food, wrong food or crappy service."
Rose M.,"Northside, Jacksonville, FL",121,60,143,2.0,2/28/2014,"Will not be back and here is why: Jambalaya- was literately too spicy to taste anything except the spice. Had to have two glasses of milk to get through half of it and couldn't eat more then that.  Chicken Alfredo- no chicken? How did that happen? Mediterranean chicken tacos- first time came out with burnt pita, second time tasted amazing but took 15 min to come back out.  Only part of our order that came out right was the kids meal but how hard is it to cook out of the box Mac and cheese? The manager came around right when we got our food and before we could answer his question he was leaving to speak to other guests. Rates one star for location and one star for a very courteous wait staff."
Eddie G.,"Jacksonville, FL",15,5,,3.0,3/11/2016,"Nice service, and the place is great, however the quality of the food doesn't match the price, entrees are too pricey, for same price you can eat better in another franchise restaurant."
Patrick L.,"Jacksonville, FL",2,17,29,4.0,4/4/2015,"First timers.  Won't be last.  Busy Saturday nite and we got seated and forgotten.  A server, Rainey and her trainee Ashley, from another area came to the rescue just before we got up to leave. She took over, and she was great.  Food was very good. Will be back to try other items.  Loved the fried artichokes!"
Tesha P.,"Jacksonville, FL",376,141,1110,3.0,3/19/2015,"The atmosphere is casual lots of dark wood color kinda cozy to me. I seen lots if adults a few children enjoying dinner. Televisions are present everywhere so you won't miss the game. We were seated quickly . Tim, our waiter  ( who remind me of LaBron James) took our order promptly. The Strawberry Smash I think that's the name of the drink was way too sweet ( can't believe I said that) I had to send it back or risk going into a diabetic shock situation (on not diabetic). He  returned with a drink called ""A Drink Like That"". Which was more to my taste. It packed a lite punch. My honey ordered one of the many craft beers. We both order the sirloin medium well , which were tender, juicy and seasoned well. I got baked potato fully loaded ( full strips of bacon) he got french fries and we both got crisp salads , house salad with Italian dressing yummy. His Caesar salad was so good he cleaned the whole plate. Our overall experience lead us to add to the ""we will return list"". Bill was under $60. Our waiter was on top of his customer service game."
Jason B.,"Spring Grove, PA",41,18,1,5.0,1/16/2016,Popped in for beers on 01/15. I was blown away by Kate the bartender. She was so knowledgeable about beer in general. She talked beer all night. It was awesome.
Sharde N.,"Jacksonville, FL",112,82,226,4.0,11/25/2015,"I have experienced BJs twice and would return. The last visit I had the Broccoli Cheddar Soup in a bread bowl. It was soooo good, full of flavor and was just the right amount of everything. The first time I ordered the chicken flatbread and it was yummy as well. Cant wait to visit again."
Meiko W.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,2,,3.0,1/23/2016,Went here last night for my nieces 17th bday celebration and what had the potential to be a great experience ended up being disappointing. It was a very nice atmosphere and service started promptly! It took our food over an hr to come out and when it did it was cold. My daughter (7)started eating her cold Chicken Alfredo until I sent it back unfortunately she waited so long she went to sleep. The Portebelo Mushroom sandwich that was suggested by my server came out so black you could not recognize it was even a mushroom and on top of that the meat was cold. Sent that back as well and ordered a pizza which took my wait time to now almost 2hrs. So ended up taking it home instead.  I spoke with a manager (Darren)and he ended up taking those 2 items off my ticket and informed me there was a whole new staff in the kitchen and serving and apologized. He seemed sincere. I always think a great manger is one that listens and cares about a unhappy customer and tries to make them happy. Even if it wasn't removing items off my bill he was willing to understand my frustration and do SOMETHING about it. Hats off to you Darren for caring!!!!  The service was exceptional by one of our servers named Alex. And needless to say I'm sometimes skeptical about giving second chances but I think this place definitely deserves one because they at least care about their customers so I will be seeing them again soon!!!
Kenny J.,"Orange Park, FL",0,12,,2.0,3/27/2016,"Food is OK, nothing special, big menu , service is REALLY REALLY SLOW. Place is only half full too. Probably our last visit here, manager is walking around apologizing to everyone who is eating here. Sad. Also Jumbalaya is the hottest I have ever eaten, ate half of order and lips numb."
Brenda F.,"Williamstown, NJ",2,5,1,5.0,1/25/2016,What an awesome place!  The food was so good and what a selection!!  We all had something different and we all loved what we ordered. Our server was perfect. Anyone who complains about this place is impossible to please.
Jen K.,"Naples, FL",14,21,1,1.0,7/24/2016,"Medium.  All I wanted was a good burger cooked to medium perfection. I saw BJ's Brewhouse near my hotel.  I had never been to one so I thought I would give them a try.  I ordered a Hickory Brisket and Bacon Burger.  When I opened the box, boy was that a rare sight.  I mean, it came as rare as could be.  Oh bloody hell.   Then I thought, wow,  did the word ""medium"" somehow get mixed up with the word ""rare"" because the two are so alike? My usual reaction to this was to just eat it because, hey, I was traveling, eating in my hotel room,  and it was the only food I had!  So as I muddled through the sweet hickory sauce and brisket that was atop. I thought to myself, ""Not bad.""  Suddenly, without warning my teeth hit the actual hamburger, and I noticed it started having that old meat taste.  You know, like when you microwave a leftover hamburger that you thought you could salvage after a few days?   Ugh.  Why, oh why? Thanks to that my appetite was ruined, shattered, unable to recover.  I could not finish it.  I found a nice cozy home for it in the bottom of the hotel trashcan.  Hours later, I was still hungry and had to nibble on the only food I had left.... my three dollar Annie's Cheddar Bunnies, which proved to be much tastier than that particular $12.95 burger.  Thanks for the memory."
Bryan L.,"Murfreesboro, TN",150,296,61,4.0,11/13/2014,"Four and a half? Five? Is it the best food in the world? Maybe not, but it is good and it makes me happy. I love the happy hour!! Great deals on the apps and flatbreads.  Great service every time I've been. Their house brewed bees are delish! They also keep local and popular craft beers on tap, huge bonus there. Love the outdoor seating with the fire pit. On a cool afternoon it's very inviting. The tvs always have the games on and ESPN running to keep me entertained between appetizers.  I keep coming back... it must be good!"
Bill P.,"Fairfax Station, VA",56,473,1198,3.0,11/5/2014,"We went here for dinner because it was close to where we were staying. They had a large bar with a nearby dining area. I had the pork chop entree from their light menu. It came with green beans, boiled new potatoes, and grilled onion. The pork chop had a nice glaze but was a bit chewy. I like vegetables that are cooked but still crunchy. The green beans were crunchy but undercooked. The grilled onion included a ring of the dried skin that normally would have been discarded when preparing the onion. I enjoyed glasses of their nutty brewnette brown and pumpkin ales. Since I was just passing through the area, my return to this location is unlikely. I'll try another location before making any conclusions about BJs, but based on this visit, I'd stop for a glass of beer but not go out of my way to have a meal at a BJs."
Sarah V.,"Brussels, Belgium",33,242,40,3.0,1/28/2015,"Pretty cool place where there's something for everyone. With big screens, you can see the latest games while enjoying a nice meal. We came here after being out for the evening and all enjoyed some good drinks and a meal. I had a crispy jalapeno veggie burger, which wasn't the best I've had but also wasn't bad either. Everyone else seemed happy with their orders and left satisfied. Service was fine as was ambiance. The only reason why I didn't rate this higher is because it's a chain and I really dislike chains and would rather support a local business but hey, other than that this places is pretty great!"
Angie F.,"Virginia Beach, VA",2,1,3,1.0,11/21/2015,"Service at the bar was good but food was Horrible and the drinks EXTREMELY  over priced $15 for a double shot!!  Cheer wiz and instant potatoes.  I talked to the manager and all she said was ""thank you for your feedback""??!  What ??? That's it!  She shouldn't b a manager!!Take my advice and spend your money ANYwhere else but here!!!!!!!!  We will NEVER be back!!  Hopefully people don't make our mistake!!!!!!  Hated it!!!!"
Kelli P.,"San Diego, CA",0,17,1,3.0,8/21/2016,My husband and I got seated right away on a Friday evening. My husband liked his stone brewery beer and we both loved the lettuce wraps as an appetizer. I got a shrimp and fish dish w couscous in red sauce etc. had to season it a lot for me to finish it. The fish was also not fresh. They either really over cooked the fish or it was from the day before. My husband loved his entire meal and the waitress was good. Would we go back? No. But it wasn't all bad.
