Niko T.,"San Francisco, CA",39,3,,3.0,12/23/2017,"Sat night happy hour at BJ's? The 10% BAC signature Gand Cru beer is well made and worth the flavor. Not my fav but well done for the style. The fries are great, duh. The sriracha brussel sprouts fantastic. I dont know for sure, but you probably need to eat more veggies anyways. Totally doable well roasted with spicy mayo right?  SOS leave the sliders alone. My slider minis looked like mishappen elephant  heads. What part of a hamburger is supposed to be crunchy? My pickles looked like Juan beat them out of a canned pinata and I don't even think he works there.  Fortunately that 10% signature Grand Cru had a twin and my yelp fingers work. By the way it's seasonal and said to sell out fast, FYI.  So its been a long 10 day week before Christmas and I'm way out of town on business. I've been working inside Jacksonville FL Costco. BJs is a close opportunity for a hot meal before a night in a crappy hotel. The only gettin lucky for me on this Sat night is Happy Hour  10pm-12am.  As much as I love the idea of 1/2 price menu I have the strong suspicion thats when the old burger comes out.  #1/2pricehappyhour=1/2qualityhamburger #happyhoureintkosherandimnotjewish This chain restaurant is sort of a good idea to offer local pub attitude without all the trouble of actual neighbors making eye contact over the 4 channel sports screen.  The staff does there best to satisfy the high expectations of the under tipping crowd so God bless them.  It's worth a shot when your high in spirit and low in benjamin's. Just don't expect too much, leave a good tip and be glad you have a job.  #donthatetheplayerhatethegame"
Kymberly C.,"Jacksonville, FL",99,38,6,1.0,12/24/2017,"This location is appalling, I felt like I needed a hot shower after the experience. After dragging my husband around IKEA for 4 hours we were starving & needed a glass of wine to settle our retail nerves. My husband loves BJ's & tho I'm not a fan I agreed as a reward for purchasing an entire new bedroom set for the Mother In Law. The hostess first tried to seat us in the very last booth that has only one booth side & a normal chair on the other regardless of the fact there was not a single other booth occupied. I requested to sit in a normal 2 top booth, we get all settled in & unfortunately the way the sun positioned through the large windows I could see what looked like 3 years worth of shmegma caked onto the wooden partition beside me. I moved my purse away from the wall, totally disgusted. The women's room was filthy, a huge box of toilet paper lazily opened & left on the floor after being restocked, the floor sticky on the bottom of my shoes, husband commented that men's room was no better. The server took quite a while to greet the table, in fact we had enough time to decide on our drinks & food by the time he introduced himself to us. We each ordered a glass of wine, another long wait for the wine. Ok, no biggie, we're just happy when they finally arrive.  Then we wait. And we wait. And we wait some more. In this time we don't see the server, no manager has come by to address the wait. Finally after probably 45 minutes the food arrives & it's apparent my two small plates were waiting under the window for my husbands tacos by the film of ""skin"" over my meatballs & the the liquified beets. Annoying.  At this point we order another round of wine, the server comes by with his little carafes & to my horror he pours the refills into our wine glasses incorrectly! Luckily my glass was bone dry but my poor husband was left with a chardonnay-riesling blend that he couldn't even stomach to finish. We didn't even bother addressing this with the server, just paid our bill & agreed that would be our last BJ's experience for a long time."
Michael R.,"Neptune Beach, FL",353,261,1268,4.0,11/20/2017,We came here for veterans day. This was our first time to this location. The outside and inside appear to be kept in top quality condition. Despite the line of people waiting for seats upon our arrival we were seated within ten minutes. The menu is a bit costly.  The food we ordered was amazingly prepared. The recipe they use for foods we ordered had perfect amount of flavor. The portion was a bit low for the cost.  We were only here for veterans day. The service was above and beyond excellent.  If you are looking for a nice meal at st. John's town center we recommend you try this place.
Jeremy B.,"Atlanta, GA",151,334,1179,4.0,9/6/2017,"Boy do I love this place, I've been coming for years when I vacation in Florida & Texas, now we finally have a location in Huntsville, AL; that leaves us in Atlanta waiting our turn. Plenty of tvs for the sports fanatics also!  I first discovered a great Belgian beer here called lambic a few years ! Such a great variety of  to select from and boy do I love the pizookie. I also like the new mediterranean chicken pita tacos, so delicious! Pictured above I couldn't resist giving the warm monkey bread pizookie a try. Topped with ice cream, it reminded me of an upgraded cinnamon roll! It was perfect! I thought just one bite & ate the entire thing! A must try! This place is one of the few places I know that can cook such a variety of good, so well. Everything I've had over the years tasted delicioso!"
Renda H.,"Jacksonville, FL",106,161,267,3.0,1/7/2018,Okay I have to say this was not a good experience... I went to this location last night for dinner yes it's Saturday and kind of busy but it wasn't that busy! the wait was only 15 minutes. We were lucky to get a table in the bar to take advantage of the special half price appetizers and mini pizza that's only offered in the bar area during football games. My real complaint is with the kitchen the waitress was pretty good and the only thing she did wrong was not make sure that she put in the appetizers to come out first we didn't say anything and she didn't ask so I forgive her for that one... but when we did ask her for the garlic knots to go ahead and come out since we were hungry and it had been a long time after we placed our order! she brought them out but they were still frozen in the middle! and there was a piece of plastic stuck to one of them! so obviously the kitchen was not on point then the rest of our order came out together which was the chicken potstickers pretty good and the fried artichokes very good also the chicken bacon mini deep dish pizza was dry on top and soggy on the bottom and on my great white pizza they forgot the mushrooms and it was barely warm so she very kindly asked if I wanted to have a new one i agreed... when it finally came out it was at least better than the first one and then she gave us a free Pizookie (we asked) and a huge discount on our check so it wound up being okay but still I was disappointed enough to have to write this review! And to top it all off it was freezing in there the whole time they had the AC on and it was like 40 degrees outside so that was not pleasant either...
Kevin D.,"Jacksonville, FL",4,68,30,5.0,9/15/2017,"Second visit in two months, absolutely perfect! Lauren was our waitress on both occasions and she is top notch! She is a real pro that knows her menu and really does an excellent job in guiding you through the many selections to get the most out of your visit. It's pretty rare these days to go out to any restaurant and really feel like a valued guest. It's even more rare to combine that level of service with great food. I don't know if I'm just lucky, all I know is what I've experienced on both visits. The food is excellent and the service was impeccable. I choose the unlimited soup and salad lunch combo. My wife ordered the spaghetti and meatballs lunch portion. So as you can tell from the pictures, the spaghetti portion is absolutely gigantic. Quantity is good but if the flavor isn't there it doesn't matter. I can tell you that my wife loves it. I've eaten her meatballs and I thought that they were pretty tasty! This is the second time I've ordered the bread bowl, the first time with chili and the second time with broccoli cheese soup. The soup and bread bowl are second to none and the salad was cold and fresh. What else could I ask for? The facility is clean and well kept. The menu is huge. I highly recommend exploring this place and the menu. It's been around a while and I did visit years ago. I don't know what's changed but it definitely is going in a good direction!"
David E.,"Saint Johns, FL",1,17,1,4.0,1/5/2018,"Great place for happy hour, lunch or dinner. Jeremiah Red is a solid beer, brewed in-house. Wide range of beer choices and really good apps. The full menu is huge ranging from salads, burgers, steaks, seafood and more. Avocado egg rolls are a must."
Elizabeth A.,"Ponte Vedra Beach, FL",42,47,197,5.0,12/1/2017,"Great food with menu updates. Arugula salad with beets and strawberry vinegret. Asian chopped salad is full of chicken-HUGE!!! Quinoa salad with loaded shrimp and spinach and fresh tomatoes. Did not get a pix of the flat bread nachos-fantastic! Loaded yet light, flacky crust, fresh jalepanoes."
Maisha R.,"Jacksonville, FL",1857,947,3614,3.0,4/9/2017,"BJ's is a good place to grab a bite to eat when you're casually dressed and looking for good, solid, consistent food. Having only tried their appetizers, pizzas, and pizookies when I lived in California, I was actually surprised by how expansive the menu was. They have quite the variety of entrees and even a lighter fare section that has lower calorie options. Sitting out on the patio on a beautiful weekend day, we decided to order burgers - the appetizer sliders with cheese and a side of fries and the hickory brisket and bacon burger. We tried the honey sriracha brussel sprouts and the pizookie trio with monkey bread, ghirardelli chocolate, and chocolate chip flavors. The food was all average at best. The brussel sprouts were very underwhelming and they tasted nothing like we expected given the name. There was a light drizzle of some sauce on top that was neither sweet nor spicy. Our waitress found their only bottle of sriracha sauce and she brought it out for us. The brisket burger was actually quite tasty, and much better than the sliders. I added some barbecue to the sliders and to the fries, which made both of them better. I basically only go to BJ's for the pizookie and the trio did not disappoint! Although these were a little softer and gooier than I remember them being, they were still really good! The monkey bread was a unique pizookie offering but it was really cinammony and tasty. The portions were very generous and we ended up packing half of our meal to go. Our waitress was very attentive and accommodating. She even offered to-go refills on our sodas. I took her up on it as their black cherry is really good!  The next time I'm craving a pizookie I'll be back. I may just order it to go though."
Matt J.,"Jacksonville, FL",33,117,106,2.0,5/4/2017,"Great beer, but there needs to be a change to almost everything else at BJs.  The main problem for me with this restaurant is that every time I go, be it day or night, I have to wait so long for my food. I have been a handful of times and it may just be bad luck, but I always wait forever to receive anything that I order. One time I ordered a chicken pasta dish which I waited some time for and it didn't have any chicken in it. The waitress offered to bring me some grilled chicken to put in it, but there was no telling how long that would take so I just ended up eating my pasta without. One other thing is that the food seems pretty inconsistent as far as how well prepared each dish is. I've had really good meals and then come back to have the exact same entree be terrible.  Sorry I had to get the bad out of the way to justify the rating. The good thing is that the in house beers aren't that bad and the service is usually very accommodating as if they know the wait for the food is going to be longer than desired. Some dishes are tasty like the avocado egg rolls and the pizzookie, but I haven't found a consistent entree that I would get more than once.  I don't mean to be blunt but there are better choices just a block down the road in any direction. Unless you have some sort of obligation to go to BJs I would steer away and spend your money wisely."
Gisell B.,"Jacksonville, FL",78,87,200,4.0,4/13/2017,"Tonight was a good night for dinner. There are pages of choices. I landed on the Peruvian quinoa bowl. Hubs had it too, but with salmon. Loved the mix of quinoa with brown rice. I got a side of their peanut spicy sauce. It was delicious with the meal. Gave it a kick I wanted. Food was filling.  They make their own beer. My fav is Totonka stout. Hubs enjoys the Nutty Brunette.  Our waitress was really nice and attentive.  I don't think I saw anyone not working. Our waitress kept our drinks topped off.   Favorite part is getting on the wait list before going there on their app. I can order more stuff if I wanted to, order to go, and I can pay from my phone. Not having to wait for the waitress to come back. Atmosphere is good from couples to large groups.  ------------ So I need to update. Although the food was good for me. Some of the friends I came with didn't feel the same. The service lagged. Our waitress was really nice, but seemed to be stretched thin.  She had lots of people to attend to. We even flagged down another waitress to get our waitress."
Victoria A.,"Jacksonville, FL",3,8,12,5.0,11/1/2017,"I loved how doughy the pizza was, I got the buffalo chicken and the celery mixed well with the texture of the pizza. The flavor wasn't too spicy, it had the right amount of flavor. If you happen to come here, you should get one of their Pazookis, I got the Salted Caramel and it was one of their more favored dishes amongst the customers. I got to try a bite of the monkey bread one and that was delicious and sweet. Now if you are going to try one of their original drinks and you like tarty fruity flavors, then I would get the berry burst cider. It has the perfect sweetness to it and tastes almost like sour strawberry juice."
Kimberly H.,"Jacksonville, FL",18,1,,2.0,1/5/2018,"I have always been a great fan of this restaurant. As a matter of fact, I am a loyalty customer. I brought an out-of-town friend from Houston to eat there the other day. I bragged about the food and service prior to getting there. I wish that I had gone to Cheddars and waited 30 minutes. The service was terrible.  Our server did not check on us not one time. We were seated at 3:07 p.m. last Thursday. We did not get our food until we asked for it at 3:59 p.m. and the server had not given us silverware. I wanted to order another drink from the bar but I wasn't given an opportunity. I tried to talk to the server thinking that maybe she was new, so I thought that I would give her some tips on checking back with her guest. Her response to me was ""Oh I'm not worried because I'm a great waitress"".  I was so upset that I took my food home. I was so embarrassed for my friend. We both stood there with our jaws dropped."
Troy E.,"Jacksonville, FL",208,13,,2.0,11/15/2017,"OMG where do i begin?! Ok, so i was out to dinner with some friends (about 6 of us in total). We all ordered cheeseburgers and it took over 2 hours for us to get our food. Our waiter came by TWICE for refills and he low key had an attitude the whole time, which i didn't understand because we weren't asking for much at all. Anyways, we get our food and NOTHING was right. They overcooked them all, some of them didn't even come with cheese...mind you, we all ordered the same exact thing. BUT, we talked to the manager because we were truly confused about the service and wait because there weren't that many people in the restaurant. She was very nice and gave us half off for our meal and gave us free dessert (reason i am giving 2 stars). I think they just had a bad day that day or something..."
Kaneil Smith S.,"Jacksonville, FL",172,174,441,2.0,11/18/2016,"I was not disappointed after eating at BJ's. That only because did not have high expectations. I went there hoping to prove myself wrong that this was merely another underwhelming restaurant with mediocre food but nice ambience.  The food I had we the epitome of OK.  The deep dish pizza just was forgettable at best and seemingly overdone. "" $5 Hot and ready™ "" -ish. The dessert I had could have been spelled with one S because it was dry [as a desert]. The monkey bread was served with ice cream but the bread was dry making the dessert unappetizing. You know There is a problem when I don't finish dessert.  On to the positives shall we.  The place is great for just having a casual meal with a friend. Aesthetically pleasing.  The service was good, our server did a good job with recommendations and information.  I was not impressed."
Bill L.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",270,529,544,4.0,6/10/2017,"This place has a pretty good vibe and great spot to meet friends for a drink, bite of food and catch up. My brother got married earlier in the day and a few of his high school friends were in town and wanted to catch up and meet the new bride. I hadn't seen either of these guys in nearly 40yrs but they were both just as I remembered.  It was Saturday night, and we were a party of 6 so grabbing a table without a long wait was a challenge and we were left to fend for ourselves in the bar area. We made it work! We pulled a few high tops together and put drink orders in. We stood/sat around the tables telling old stories and a few new ones.  The drinks were good and our server did a good job keeping up with us and making sure our glasses were never empty. After awhile we put in some orders for food. I decided on the avocado egg rolls only to find out after awhile they were not available so the Mgr offered a substitute at no chg. We ordered some pot stickers, a couple of burgers some potato skins and some mozzarella sticks.  Food was all solid and tasty! Lots of rotating seasonal beers on tap, full bar, great selection of appetizers, pizza, salads, entrees, pasta, sandwiches, tacos and everything in between. Definitely enjoyed the night and would definitely go back to this or other BJ's locations."
Shan R.,"Jacksonville, FL",85,70,14,5.0,6/30/2017,"I love this place! Both locations are pretty good in Jax. I've only sat at the bar and ordered beer, mojitos or margaritas. Always good.  The avocado egg rolls are to die for! Excellent burgers. Definitely love coming here."
Sean M.,"Jacksonville, FL",206,471,234,4.0,10/13/2016,I came in yesterday on my day off with my wife and a friend for lunch and had a very good meal.  Ticket times were improved over previous experiences and the service as usual was really good. Only one minor issue of our salads coming out a bit late making getting our lunch entrée a bit awkward.  I really do like coming here though and I like the menu though it is exhaustingly large.
Juliet H.,"Jacksonville, FL",3862,655,3531,4.0,6/15/2016,"Well look at you BJ's! I haven't visited in some time, but I must say that I'm impressed! After a long night, the girls and I landed in BJ's because (to be frank) they were the only ""open kitchen"" option after 11pm on a Tuesday night in the Town Center. But once we were seated and settled, BJ's began to blow our minds a little!  Free ""garlicky"" knots served hot and fresh outta' the oven with softened butter? --Don't mind if I do! And we did... two rounds of it! I ordered a burger and fries and split it with a friend. It was pretty darn delicious and the fries where hinging on a truffle-like situation. Effect: Raised brows all around!  Lastly, as we were celebrating a birthday, Paige (our sweet server) offered us a free ""cookie a la mode"" dessert-- but of course not the Strawberry Beignet, which is my FAVORITE! But, the dessert was tasty nonetheless!  Sadly, BJ's gets overlooked by my crew, but after last night's stellar performance, I'd say that's our mistake!  Touché BJ's... touché!"
Kel G.,"Jacksonville, FL",9,32,41,3.0,2/23/2017,"Ordered: frozen strawberry splash and calamari. The drink was very good but it didn't have much goose in it. The calamari wasn't crispy enough. My friends ordered the avocado rolls, flatbread, and broccoli chicken Alfredo and they enjoyed their meals. I didn't taste it but I'll take their words for it."
Tom C.,"Jacksonville, FL",1,10,,5.0,11/11/2017,"Veterans Day. A freebie. Never been there, give it a try. Crowded, 20 minute wait but predicted to the minute. Wife had CHERRY CHIPOTLE GLAZED SALMON; I had BLONDE® FISH 'N' CHIPS. Both were excellent. The bed of roasted asparagus fire-roasted red pepper, tomato, spinach and couscous with the salmon was very tasty. The batter on my fish fell between crispy and crunchy, excellent. I did come up a bit short on the tartar sauce; ask for more. Only disappointment was they were out of the TURMERIC-ROASTED CAULIFLOWER. I've never had it but it sounded good."
Nicole P.,"Westside, Jacksonville, FL",0,1,,1.0,11/10/2017,"Decided to stop by for Veterans Day and get a discounted meal. Wasn't worth the hour and a half wait though. Overall service was slow and after being seated didn't meet our server until 10-15 mins later. Food was mediocre. Ribs were alright but mojitos had little to no alcohol in them whatsoever. Tasted like sprite and super syrupy, almost too sweet to drink. A waste of a $10 drink..  Honestly if you want good food and good service in that area just do yourself a favor and go right down the street to either Chuy's or the Cheesecake Factory."
Daisy D.,"Jacksonville, FL",308,1485,1829,3.0,4/6/2016,"I got exactly what I expected at BJ's. A decent meal for a little higher than average price. We've been a couple of times to this location and once we're able to connect with our server, service has usually been good. We've tried a variety of things from shareable apps (Brussels sprouts) to a deep dish pizza to a pizookie or two. Nothing stands out as memorable, but we ate everything so we must have enjoyed it.  The beer is on the higher end of the price points, but the brews they offer don't really seem to match. We've tried a couple of their own brews and haven't been disappointed. For a stop on the way home from work BJs is great. As a destination if I'm driving in from the beach, It might make the list every now & then, but not that often."
Khuyên T.,"Jacksonville, FL",56,3,6,4.0,7/18/2017,"Happy hours here half price app. Pricey foods but I think it's reasonable.  Last time I ordered calamari and ahi poke. Being from Hawaii, I was skeptical but it is decent.  Today I ordered Jambalaya, good amount of Cajun spices. Generous protein."
Skyler W.,"Jacksonville, FL",43,53,248,4.0,12/6/2016,"What can I say about BJ's other than if you're looking for a good place for happy hour, this is a pretty decent one to check out. Now while I do not believe their regular prices for their appetizers are warranted, their prices for the same food come happy hour is kind of a steal. I mean, being able to get four different standard sized apps (and the portions aren't too shabby) for almost less than $20 is no laughing matter. And their drink options during happy hour are pretty good too. Please note though, they make a strong rum and coke. By that I mean it's gotta be like 2/3 or 3/4 rum.  I love a good plate of potstickers and BJ's does a pretty decent job. Their Chicken Pot Stickers come with a garnish of carrots and scallions, sprinkled with sesame seeds, and a side of soy dipping sauce.  Along with that I also have a weakness for an Ahi Tuna app; while BJ's doesn't make my favorite version of this, it's also not my least favorite. The chunks of ahi grade tuna and avocado constitute my favorite part of the dish, while the bed of cabbage and dressing mixture along with onions and tomatoes it comes with, I could do without. There are also chips to go with it to scoop it onto, but I find these at times to be ineffective.  ****If you're looking for an appetizer that won't let you down (from my experience) try the California club flatbread. Tomatoes, mozzarella, bacon, chicken, avocado, and garlic aioli drizzled across the top. Never a disappointment and even better the day after as leftovers. It's literally over a foot long.  I recently tried their White Peach Margarita and let me tell you, that is a drink to come back to. I can't even remember what was in it. But if you're looking for a fruity drink that masks the amount of alcohol you're consuming, get that one. I can't even say it tasted that much like peach. Maybe more so like strawberry. But still delicious. I'd get it again. And again. And again.  Happy hour is Monday to Friday 4-7. Make sure you catch those waiters, not all of them are as attentive as they should be."
Angelo M.,"Jacksonville, FL",149,10,6,2.0,12/4/2017,"An all around bad experience. I placed my order via the app to try to cut down on time. However, that proved to be more of a hassle then simply calling in my order! I used the app and tried to pay for my order on it, but it didn't allow me to pay after placing my order. I went into the restaurant for assistance and none of the servers were knowledgeable on how to help me navigate the application. Once I figured out how to pay, the manager shows up and gave a somewhat decent answer as to why the bill wasn't showing up on the application. From there, I had to wait an additional 20 minutes before my food came out, totaling just short of an hour in waiting. Once I finally received my food, it was completely wrong. To add insult to injury, the server who bought it out had a bad attitude because I requested to have it remade. There was no manager to be found and instead of looking to provide good service, all of the employees were busy cleaning up their stations instead of seeing to the needs of the patrons. I like bjs pizza and really like the Oreo pizzokie; However, I don't know if I'll be returning to this location."
Ashton J.,"Jacksonville, FL",364,68,177,4.0,11/20/2016,"This was the first visit that I had at BJ Brewery's since I went vegan. This meant I couldn't eat either l of my go-to eats: avocado egg rolls and lettuce wraps. I tried the super salad and the vegan lentil soup. They were not bad, but definitely not up to par with the other yummy things I've had at that restaurant before. It won't stop me from going back at all though. Next time I go I will just try yet another new thing!"
Scott B.,"Big Spring, TX",13,410,303,3.0,6/3/2017,"I usually enjoy good service and food at any BJ's I have visited, but sadly, the service was severly lacking tonight (not because of a poor server but from a lack of staffing). It took 10 mins for our drink order to be taken, and another 10 mins for them to be delivered. 1.5 hrs later, we finally finished our meal. The Root Beer Ribs were good, and the Sante Fe Salad was large but undersauced. The real star of the meal was of course our Pizzookie Trio sampler. Wanted to give 3.5 stars, or 4 rounded, but just couldn't do it due to the ridiculously slow service."
Christopher O.,"Jacksonville, FL",38,72,82,1.0,4/29/2017,"We had a large party on a Friday night. Some delays were to be expected. Or waitress brought our drinks and then completely disappeared. We had to flag down another waitress for refills. Food finally came an hour later. No apologies. My friend did not like her chicken and didn't eat it. The waitress offered to bring her something different. She ordered the wings. When we got the bill, she charged her for both meals. Would not recommend."
Britney J.,"Jacksonville, FL",71,73,488,3.0,12/7/2016,"BJ's, BJ's, BJ's. What can I say about BJ's? Honestly, I have been coming here for a while and have a huge soft spot for this place for two reasons: 1. We share the same initials 2. BJ's introduced me to the concept of happy hour. BJ's used to be my go to happy hour spot; not because their happy hour drinks are all that great, but because their appetizers are half price. Their specialty drinks are killer, though. I recently had a drink that's a cross between a strawberry daiquiri and a piña colada (I can't remember the name of it right now). Whooo! It was great. The specialty drinks aren't a part of happy hour, though, so I stay away from them for the most part unless I'm in the mood.  One thing I always say about BJ's is that I'm no fan of their entrees (they're overpriced and nothing exceptional flavor wise), but their appetizers during happy hour are pretty good. I've tried the majority of their appetizers. Their wings are pretty standard, yet still tasty. Their calamari is a definite pass for me. I used to love BJ's calamari a few years back, but somewhere along the line, they must have changed the ingredients of their batter because it is seriously lacking flavor every single time I've ordered it lately. My go-tos now are the California Club flatbread, (which I will admit is genuinely delicious and I'm never dissatisfied with it) and the ahi tuna poke. I'm a sucker for tuna poke, and I think I was actually introduced to it for the first time via BJ's. I will say, however, that the last 2-3 times I've ordered the tuna poke, I've been disappointed with it. It seems that it's going the way of their calamari; continuously lacking flavor. I didn't even finish it last time, which is rare for me and tuna (excuse the pun). Their pizookie dessert is always amazing, though! It's a piping hot cookie topped with ice cream. Simple but tasty. I'd eat a pizookie every day if I could. Okay, maybe not every day. My waistline doth protest.  The value at BJ's happy hour can't be beat. You can get full size appetizers for around 5 dollars apiece. Beware though! Happy hour is crazy crowded from about 5:30 until the very end at 7. You may have to stand for a bit and wait for someone to leave before you can scoop up a booth or high chair table. Service at BJ's is also hit or miss. Most of the time it's satisfactory, but sometimes they can get distracted or short with you during the really busy times of happy hour. I had an absolutely horrid experience at BJ's once and I sent them some pretty scathing feedback about it. Seriously, it was one of the worst experiences I've had at a restaurant ever. They ended up giving me a gift card and the manager called me personally to apologize. I truly appreciate and respect them for that, and I really don't mention this incident when I tell people about BJ's because they did such a good job righting their wrongs in that case. The experience actually ended up as a positive in the end. All in all, I know I'll return to BJ's because it's like that dependable cardigan in your closet that goes with everything. It's always there and it serves its purpose pretty well. BJ's is a great place to congregate with friends or coworkers and eat food that's at least decent."
Patricia L.,"St. Augustine, FL",258,244,1434,5.0,6/10/2016,"We love BJ's!  We love the atmosphere, the menu, the wait staff and the prices!  This place is huge, so even when the parking lot looks full...you can probably still get a table.  If not, enjoy a drink at the massive bar! We normally try things from the Small Bites Menu since we normally only need something small when we go there.  Everything is delicious.  Our personal favorite is the Honey Sriracha Brussels Sprouts.  I love Brussel sprouts anyway, but to take a perfectly healthy item and make it so ""apply to the thigh good"" is amazing!  Even if you don't like these normally...give them a try, you'll get addicted! On our last visit we ate a little larger than normal.  My husband had a piadina sandwich with fries and our son had the Hickory Brisket and Bacon sandwich...both were absolutely delicious!  I, however, decided to ask the waiter what he recommended since I couldn't decide.  He said his favorite was the Lemon Thyme Chicken, so I decided to give it a go with extra sauce on the side (just something I do).  It sounded yummy.  We all have different taste buds.  To me, it wasn't bad, just not good, nor tasty.  Something in it was terribly overwhelming...yes, it had thyme it, but something else was like ""WHOA"" or perhaps the combination with all the bell pepper.  I was hungry so I ate some, but it just got to be too much.  I'm glad I got extra sauce on the side since the dish itself didn't seem to have much on it.  The sauce was lovely, but the main dish...not so much.  I was able to dip my chicken in the sauce to make it taste better at least, but I lost my appetite and stopped eating.  I just couldn't do it.  I won't order it again obviously and it certainly wasn't worth marking them down star wise.  All I can say is, if you don't like those thanksgiving type spices (or whatever it is) with a lot of bell pepper...avoid!  I like those things, but this dish is over the top. The wait staff seems to be near perfect or as perfect as you can get.  They seem to have that perfect dance down to make sure you are never on empty drink wise.  And they don't come to see how your meal is when your mouth is full.   OK...drum roll...they give a uniformed discount and they have a free rewards program.  Both are reasons alone to return again!  Of course we'll be back...we love the Honey Sriracha Brussels Sprouts too much to not go back."
Ilsa M.,"Jacksonville, FL",354,283,395,5.0,11/22/2016,"Came here with a party of 15 after our dance concert . I was very appreciative to begin with because I waited last minute to make a reservation and they were able to fit such a large party in at 9pm.    Customer service : our waiter was kind and attentive . He met our needs and strived to make sure we were all covered .   Drinks : I am very content with BJs wide variety of drink options . I had a Hendricks gin and tonic . In my opinion , only great bars carry Hendricks so I am quite happy with the beverage I was served .   Food: for starters we had the avocado egg roll . Just a personal preference ,I like these better when they have more avocado  then sauce . Some of them were made opposite which made it not as good . So that's my only suggestion. For my main entry I ordered the Atlantic salmon which came with mash potatoes and veggies . I Totally recommend it   ! Great balance and the salmon flavoring was delicious .   The checkout process was easy and painless, which is always appreciated .   Location : love this location and the environment is fun with lots of cool decor . I totally recommend this place to anyone ! Thanks BJs!!! See you again ."
Waheed B.,"Jacksonville, FL",296,336,273,4.0,11/23/2015,"Most recent trip was solid. Yes, this is a chain, but that means coupons and discounts and a fancy app. There is ALWAYS some kind of promotion and I like saving money when I go out to eat. Highlights include their ahi tuna appetizer which was surprisingly good and of high quality. I guess my taste buds are getting more sophisticated because I used to avoid ordering items like this unless I was at a sushi establishment. Or maybe I am easily influenced by my server... I have not been disappointed by their pizzas. Bbq chicken is a reliable option. I consumed their seasonal pumpkin pizookie which was good, to be expected from a soft cookie in a skillet topped with ice cream. I mean, how can you go wrong??? Shout out to Dustin--great service."
Ali M.,"Gainesville, FL",35,22,10,2.0,8/4/2017,The food is okay and the service was really slow. I had the Mediterranean tacos which were yummy but nothing to write home about. It took hours to get in and out. Won't be coming back any time soon.
Maggie K.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,15,,1.0,10/24/2017,"Horrible, I see now why it was empty at the peak dining time.  Service was slow and irritating that they are using tablets to take your order.  You are waiting while they search for the item, then heaven forbid you customize it, they then have to search more and write notes .  It didn't help much as my salmon came out well done after I ordered it rare , my husbands' burger was almost raw and he ordered it medium rare.  Not going to return, there are too many other choices at Town center now.  We were regulars there the burgers used to be the best, now mediocre.  They better Step up their game, there's new stuff in town.  As a side note, the bathroom smelled musty like a thruway bathroom.  Cracked tile , certainly not being kept up."
Joshua D.,"Cordova, TN",12,1,,5.0,7/7/2017,I'm not sure why this place has such a low rating. My wife and I dropped in on a Friday night when most every table was full. Our server Shannon was wonderful. She was handling a table of 14 in conjunction with our table and our food came out perfectly. The beer is cold here. The Tavern cut Pizza is great and service is top notch. Stop by when Shannon is working and you won't be disappointed.
Rory D.,"Jacksonville, FL",1444,457,253,4.0,2/17/2017,"Huge menu, great brewpub food, many homebrewed beers. My favorite drink is their Paloma. Good wing sauce, but the wings are fatty with lots of skin on them. The ahí tuna poke is very good. There are better beers in town than theirs, but some are decent. Good happy hour specials, good flatbreads, very well stocked full bar."
Jeff A.,"St. Augustine, FL",1,6,,2.0,6/17/2017,I have eaten here once before on a busy Friday night and it was good.  Today we were seated immediately but had issues right away.  Guacamole was so brown that the manager comped it and replaced with salsa.  The food was horrible otherwise and took us nearly 2 hours to eat a simple lunch and dessert due to the kitchen being so backed up.  The manager and waitress tried their best to make the best of it for us.  We were patient with them and only pointed out the issues that we had with the food and they took care of the app and dessert.  The meal itself was not much better but we ate and moved on with our day.
Amy S.,"Jacksonville, FL",1497,1714,17389,3.0,11/29/2014,"Came here with a large party and had quite the ordeal getting a table large enough to seat all of us.  There seemed to be a lot of confusion between the hostess and the servers as to what to do with us.  I finally stopped a manager and suggested an empty area and pushing all the tables together.  You'd think they could have figured that out on their own. It was later at night, so by the time we were all seated, the restaurant was starting to clear out.  We had just one server, but she did a pretty good job.  I wish she would have been a little more attentive towards the end of the meal.  I had to ask another server walking by to go find her so my friend could order a dessert. As for the food, I ordered just a regular bacon cheeseburger.  I was terribly disappointed.  It was dry and the bun wasn't very soft.  I didn't even eat half of it.  The rest was brought home and eventually thrown out.  Sucks, because I was really craving a good burger.   The reason I gave  3 stars is because hubby really enjoyed his meal of jambalaya.  He said it's some of the best he's had.  I did give it a taste, but I have a very sensitive palate and just one bite lit my mouth on fire.  Hubby did warn me though... I should have listened!  :D The highlight was the dessert my friend ordered, and another reason for 3 stars rather than 2.  I don't recall the exact name of it, but it was a salted caramel something or another.  OMGosh!  It was sinfully delicious!  I would come back here again just to order that dessert! Because hubby loved his entree so much and I loved the dessert so much, I'm sure we'll be back again.  Hopefully, next time I'll be able to find something more to my liking than that pitiful excuse for a burger.   So, BJs will get one more shot with me.  If they strike out again, I definitely won't be back."
Don S.,"Jacksonville, FL",7,29,6,4.0,2/26/2017,I'd go back! I had the deep dish ziti with a garlic knot. Pretty good. The service was excellent. The place was clean and safe. It's a tad noisy but hey it's a bar!
