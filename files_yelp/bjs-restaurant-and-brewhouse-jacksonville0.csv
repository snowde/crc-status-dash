Gilles K.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,8,,3.0,2/8/2015,"Went Sunday after church. Slow to seat us. Limited menu on Sunday. Took 90 minutes to get our food. Had to repeatedly prompt the waitress for drinks, silverware, etc. A very mediocre experience."
Sundi P.,"Hillsboro, OR",50,247,85,4.0,3/15/2013,The lunch deals here are really great if you come on a weekday.   My husband and I both had the pizza/salad deal and loved it.  It was  just enough food and the pizza was great.
Michael G.,"St Augustine, FL",9,5,1,5.0,2/22/2012,"This is one of my favorite all purpose restaurants. Very good craft beers and some pretty awesome happy hour (til 7pm) specials. If you are fortunate to have Tiffany wait on you, you will have no worries."
Abc D.,"Jacksonville, FL",78,1,,1.0,5/22/2012,We ordered calamari and there was literally 8 pieces of calamari on our plate. The food is overpriced at this place!
Dana G.,"Hamilton, Canada",1,138,4,5.0,12/9/2014,After a bad experience in Orlando we were skeptical but after being offered a gift card from head office we decided to try this location.  We are happy we did! Service was excellent my drink was never empty and as someone who drinks water constantly it was great to have the bartenders on top of it (makes it so I can enjoy more martinis;) We had the Mediterranean pizza it is so good! One of the best pizzas I personally have eaten as well as the Buffalo Chicken Pizza which was amazing.  Terrence and Bree were great and the best part was the manager came over to see how everything was making sure this experience was better than the last which I really appreciate!
Debbie C.,"Jacksonville, FL",6,18,27,2.0,4/17/2012,"Went to BJ's on a Thursday night with eager stomachs. The restaurant is visually very appealing. It's modern and sophisticated but still inviting enough for flip-flops or shorts. While the design won me over, the food disappointed me. It disappointed because it was so average. The food was bland at best; as if the chef was afraid of spices. I ordered a bacon cheeseburger and wasn't impressed at all. I've had better burgers at backyard BBQ's.  An order of Mac n Cheese lacked any actual cheese. The server did just the bare minimum so that was a fail as well. It says a lot about a place when the tomato and mozzarella salad was the best part of the meal. In conclusion, Go to BJ's for their brewhouse not their food. Their food is average at best and not worth your hard earned coin."
Amber A.,"Jacksonville, FL",20,112,7,3.0,2/13/2013,"Very loud and there is a typical wait at busy times.  Veggie burgers are good, pizza is above average.  I love the balsamic mushroom pizza.  The rootbeer is worth the trip.  Pasta is mediocre; it's a pizza joint so stick with their sweet spot.  Outdoor patio dining is nice here."
Sebastian C.,"Houston, TX",5,51,7,3.0,1/7/2012,Average food but it comes out fast. It has bar food has football games or sporting events on the tv. Nothing special but gets the job done.
Bingle B.,"Frederick, MD",115,141,186,3.0,9/6/2011,"A couple of reviews ago, I mentioned that my brother worked as a busboy at Carrabba's.  Well, he did for a hot minute, but has since moved onto bigger and better things as an assistant server at BJ's.  WTF is an ""assistant server"", you ask?  Beats the hell out of me.  I'm guessing it's still a busboy, but with a starched shirt and some attitude. My party went to BJ's for lunch on a Saturday and we were seated quickly which is kind of unusual for a new restaurant at the Towncenter.  We were all prepared for at least an hour's wait.  The managers at the restaurant also apparently thought they'd be busier since they seemed really overstaffed.  We wound up having 2 or 3 servers that would cruise slowly past our table over and over again.  When they spotted a half-filled glass of water or an empty plate, they would jump around like eager puppies, shrilly yelling, ""Can I get that for you?!?""  Furreal.  The privilege of refilling the Splenda container is not that serious.  No need to fistfight each other. The menu can best be described as ""just as lengthy as The Cheesecake Factory, except less interesting and without the joy of cheesecake.""  Or maybe ""slightly more creative than Boston's with the added bonus of not being a sports bar.""  There's nothing on the menu that you haven't eaten dozens of times in dozens of other restaurants in multiple reincarnations.  The portions are freakin' huge, but the food is kind of bland.  We ordered the stuffed mushrooms and the fried artichoke hearts appetizers.  Bland and lukewarm.  The GF had the fried shrimp which she said were overcooked.  My friend had the chicken fried steak which needed salt or flavor in general.  I had the pot roast with roasted vegetables and mashed potatoes.  It was okay.  I also had a glass of the peach sangria which had a slight cough-syrup aftertaste.  Definitely not made for chugging, like the sangrias at Carrabba's.  Dessert, in the form of a freshly baked red velvet cookie with ice cream - called the Pizookie - and the baked beignet, were good.  Nobody ordered beer, which I think is one of BJ's selling points. So, to recap: lots of boring food and just as much eager waitstaff.  But I do hope that BJ's steps up and keeps going because lord knows my brother needs the money."
Jett O.,"Jacksonville, FL",10,49,22,2.0,10/22/2012,"Their clam chowder was amazing, but the rest of the food was mediocre. The pizookie's and brownie are really over rated. They have a great beer selection though."
Christine I.,"Jacksonville, FL",91,94,,3.0,9/30/2012,"Went here with a couple of friends to watch a college football game. A great place to just catch a game, have some ok food and enjoy some drink specials.  We sat at the bar so we didnt have to experience a long wait or feel obligated to leave anytime soon. Our server was very attentive, informative and constantly checking up on our table. Their apps were half price in honor of the game so we definitely took advantage of that. Like any casual dining chain, the food was fine and the menu was pretty standard. Good for a dinner after shopping at the town center but nothing too special."
Rob L.,"Jacksonville, FL",146,6,4,1.0,11/20/2011,"Oh boy, where do I start?  Well, we walked in and the decor I liked...we sat down, ordered our drug is and before I could open the menu our server was already asking about ordering appetizers....obviously I advised her I was gonna need a minute...after looking over the extremely large menu, we decided to get the ""great beginnings,"" and the fried artichoke hearts.  My cousin went ahead and ordered the soup & salad, and asked for the salad to come out first.........................they brought the minestrone 5mins later, the salad immediately following... The apps came out and the only two things that looked like they were made fresh there were the avocado rolls and the spinach artichoke dip.  There was very little flavor in the lemon garlic aioli, but thank God for the lemon wedges... My other cousin ordered the crispy chicken sandwich, as a recommendation from our server, but after it came out she then mentioned she prefers it with cheese and avocado....never offered when we ordered....that basically consisted of two chicken fingers, lettuce, tomato on a toasted roll, and some potato wedges, once again probably frozen, and was relatively flavorless...his girlfriend got a chicken Caesar salad....no real complaints from her... I got the chicken fried steak...the entree was huge!  No complaints here! Lol the steak was cooked pretty good, but was a little short on the pepper gravy...the pepper gravy was lacking pepper....it was painfully obvious that the the white cheddar mashed potatoes were instant, and also lacking flavor...they were white, but there was definitely no cheddar in there, or any simple seasonings for that matter....the steamed veggies were good.... As for my cousin's soup and salad, he got a Caesar with some minestrone.  No complaints about the Caesar, and the minestrone was ok, at best.  We were puzzled about the size of the bowl because it looked like a small cup.  Our server said that's the bowl but the soup was unlimited, and he could pick whichever he wanted....seeing that as a bonus, he then ordered some broccoli cheese soup when he was done with the minestrone.  10 minutes later our server refilled our drinks and mentioned she was gonna ""check"" on the soup.....hate to say it, I'd bet she forgot.  She finally brought it out ad I was boxing up my entree, and I couldn't help but notice the shredded cheddar was still in shredded form....absolutely no melting had occurred...the soup was as hot as the bottle of ketchup on the table!  We told the server as we were leaving and her response was, ""oh, I'll have to check the temperature on the warmer...."" When I saw this place opened up I couldn't wait to try it...now that I have, I can't wait to eat somewhere where the food is enjoyable and quality is an actual important factor.....I learned apparently this restaurant is part of a chain....meaning there are more than one of these places where people are looking through the same, long-ass menu, eating the same bland food!   On an ending note, for being a brewhouse, very very few items on the menu actually involve beer in their recipes, which seriously makes me wonder how much of the food is actually fresh made on site......they need to count their lucky stars that they put this location in the St Johns Towns Center....it wouldn't last anywhere else!"
Jason M.,"Cambridge, MA",3,13,,4.0,1/12/2013,"Awesome food, awesome service, great casual dining we will def be coming back"
Laura P.,"Houston, TX",72,102,16,2.0,1/3/2012,"The service is ok. When I first walked in I wanted to get a to go order but after standing there for almost 10 minutes no one helped me. I finally went to the front of the restaurant and once again the hostess wasn't there, I had to wait a few more minutes to get sat. I was very annoyed and now extremely hungry. Our waitress was great and was attentive I just wish the rest of the staff was the same way. I will be back because my boyfriend likes this restaurant so I hope the next time I go the service when I enter will be better."
Chris K.,"Jacksonville, FL",4,28,1,4.0,2/16/2012,"First time there, great beer!  Food was excellent.... Got lucky with a booth on the bar side .... mint service too!!!"
Debra G.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,13,1,1.0,11/8/2013,We've been twice now.  1st visit was ok but really no way to mess up a salad. 2nd visit will be the last.  Ordered the chicken pasta limone and when it came out the pasta was mushy. It looked and tasted like it had been setting in water for some time and hadn't even been drained thoroughly as the plate was full of water....sent it back and asked for the Ahi Tuna salad.  After everyone at the table had finished they finally bring the salad.  The Ahi Tuna was not seared correctly and was mangled and looked like it had already been chewed. It was covered in a weird white pasty substance.  We all got a laugh out of the mangled pieces of tuna but had no interest in experimenting with the odd paste covering it.  The manager was very friendly and offered something else but we declined as it obviously was not going to be our night.  While waiting on the check the other couple realized they had been there 5 times and never really had a good experience.  Everyone at the table agreed that overall the food was just blah.  BJ's lost 2 customers tonight however I doubt they will notice as it seems to always be busy.   Hoping that my experience is the exception and not the norm.
Andrew B.,"Irvine, CA",17,151,1,4.0,12/24/2011,"BJ's is great for a chain. I've eaten at other locations, haven't tried this particular one yet, but I just wanted to compliment the service and attitude of the staff. My mom and I had been out shopping all day, and we rolled in to BJ's around 10:30pm. As it turned out, the kitchen had closed minutes earlier, so we promptly offered to leave. The waiter whose section we were headed to and the hostess both offered (insisted, really) to notify the kitchen staff that they were going to have to reopen for us. We politely declined, but it was a nice gesture. We'll definitely be back in the future."
Kimberly R.,"Neptune Beach, FL",6,9,,1.0,10/24/2011,"Slow service, 2.5 hours and still waiting on the check! Server apologetic but not doing anything to speed things up:( Food was good at least. When we complained to the mgr, he made excuses and rolled his eyes. They were also unwilling to split the bill up, FYI."
Sylvan F.,"Fort Mill, SC",4,111,,1.0,9/7/2013,"Service was horrendous and food just mediocre. Restaurant was dead on a Thursday night yet hey were out of Dijon sauce and Thai lettuce wrap appetizer. Ordered burger without mayo due to allergy, yet it came out with extra mayo. Server was clueless and couldn't remember anything although he didn't write anything done. Pizza was cold and burgers tasted old."
Sandy T.,"St. Augustine, FL",0,3,,5.0,4/18/2014,"The food is just amazing, .. The service is great.  I loved the flat bread pizza. The BJ Irish root beer is my new favorite drink. Can't wait to go back. ."
