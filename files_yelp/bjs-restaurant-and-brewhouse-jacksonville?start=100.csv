Olivia P.,"Jacksonville, FL",147,11,,1.0,2/27/2016,"Placed an online order called to tell them we were in the parking lot and they said the system ""lost"" our order so we had to go in then they found it magically my food should have been ready by 6:15 it wasn't ready until 6:30. Then I get home and two out of the three things I ordered were wrong called the store again and was on hold for 9 minutes but it wasn't on hold the phone was just laid down so I had to call back then finally got to talk to a manager. The whole experience was a disaster."
Kristopher H.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,3,,5.0,4/16/2016,Tasha was an amazing bartender which allowed me to have an phenomenal time at BJs. I wanted to watch a soccer game that was difficult to find but she was dedicated  enough to search tediously for it until she found it. Her beer recomendations were on point as well as her accurate description of my meal. Awesome Tasha thanks BJs
Cindi G.,"Jacksonville, FL",177,11,6,4.0,4/15/2016,"We had several minor issues with our meal, but our server more than made up for that!!! He was upbeat, friendly, and welcoming. I hope we get to have him as a server again!! What a delightful guy!!!!"
Jeniah J.,"Jacksonville, FL",205,140,172,5.0,4/18/2015,"Although they initially messed up both orders and the check, they worked harder than I've ever seen to correct every mistake and ensure we were happy. It was by far the best customer service I've ever seen in a really long time. Furthermore, the drinks and food tasted wonderful. Parking was a bit messy, but it was a Friday night, so that's too be expected. Will definitely return."
To B.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,9,,1.0,5/1/2016,Service on the patio was so bad I would rare this place a zero the drinks are over priced the food was over COOKED and dry this is a hells kitchen show in the making roach dropings
Angel V.,"Orange Park, FL",464,3,22,1.0,10/11/2016,"Invited a group of friends to watch Monday night football last night & service was horrible. They gave me on stick of broccoli, didn't bring ketchup for our burgers until burger was cold guess she forgot when I asked or made the ketchup by hand. Server forgot our drinks & when reminded about the drinks had a terrible attitude to the point where we had to ask for a new server. Manager came to TRY and help (clean cut Spanish looking guy) but even he was bad, when confronted about our water/drink delay he apologized and said he'd get right on it. Took him 15-20 min to get our waters. When we finally decided to leave after the game we asked for our checks (5 checks 6 people) manager brought us the checks and never came by to collect the checks. We ended up getting out of our seats to pay at the bar area. As a business owner this was unexceptable and we will not be coming back."
Carlos S.,"Jacksonville, FL",11,5,13,4.0,5/2/2015,Food is great. Service is timely. Best to come earlier in the day as evenings tend to get really crowded. I'm not much of a drinker but they have a nice variety of craft beers.  I enjoy this place very much.
Breana B.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",70,184,189,2.0,10/22/2015,Ehhh. That's the word that comes to mind when I thinj about my BJ's experience. Maybe they are all the same. The food took awhile to come out and it was not that great. Just basic taste.
Jennifer P.,"Yulee, FL",22,18,1,1.0,9/3/2015,"This once was my favorite restaurant until yesterday.  My daughter & I were having a ""dinner date."" Well, when we got there, no one was at the host/hostess stand and there were no servers to be found. We waited about 4-5 minutes just to be seated. When we finally sat down, the restaurant was so dark I couldn't read my menu. I had to pull my phone out and use my flashlight to read it.  When out server came to get our drink order, it took 10 minutes to get a water and a kids drink. (There were 5 booths with people, not busy @ all.) we also ordered mozzarella sticks. 15 minutes later, we received them and they were old and not cooked. They come with 8, we are 2. I couldn't find our server anywhere, so I went to the manager and told her to cancel our order and explained how bad everything was. She was extremely rude and still charged us $9.52. Unbelievable! Needless to say, we will never go back!"
Brittany C.,"Jacksonville, FL",6,34,1,2.0,9/24/2015,"I just got back from a dinner party here to celebrate my best friends birthday. I have to say, I am completely shocked and unhappy with the experience we all had.  We had a very large party. 17 of us and a reservation was made. When I first called to make the reservation, there was absolutely no problem. I even had to call back and add more people, they were completely fine with it.  Since we had such a large party, there were two waiters that were taking care of us. One waitress, I believe her name was Tasha, was absolutely great! She busted her butt helping our table and accommodating us. Plus, she was super sweet! However, the other waiter that was assigned to the other side of our table was just awful. (I did not get his name) When I first got there and sat down, it took him 30 minutes to even acknowledge me and I had to wave him down just to give him my drink order. Instead of all of our food coming out at the same time, one side of the table got their food and the other side waited almost 30 minutes to get theirs. Two people in our party that had ordered beers and had to wait 45 minutes for another round. One couple ordered an appetizer and it didn't even come out until after they were almost done with their meal. I also brought a birthday cake for all of us to eat and that took 30 minutes to get to our table as well. Tasha helped a lot with that though and went got the cake, plates and forks for us so it wasn't that big of a hassle thanks to her. The manager did come out and apologize, but it was only to one person in the party that was unhappy with her meal. I told the manager what all had happened and he comped our drinks and the one appetizer that was ordered. I personally don't think that was the best that the manager could've done but at least it was something.  The only reason I am giving 2 stars is because Tasha was such a great waitress. If I ever go back,  I'll be asking to sit in her section because I know my table will be taken care of. Other than that, I cannot believe how ridiculous this evening was at BJ's. The food was good, but I'm not sure if I'll ever be back or not."
Kenneth G.,"Jacksonville, FL",1029,23,186,1.0,7/28/2015,"Me and wife walked in to grab a beer and a few appetizers after a doing a bit a of shopping. We decided to dine in the bar area. I ran to use the restroom while my wife selected a table/bar seating. A server/manager walked from out of the kitchen and asked my wife (while I was still in the restroom) how many in the party? My wife said well it's me and my husband, but I am waiting to see where he wants to sit. The server/manager threw menus on the table and stated that whenever you decide to sit here are your menus. Meanwhile I walked out of the restroom and saw my wife sitting at a table in the bar. She pointed out how dirty the space was and asked me if I smelled the sour aroma coming from the booth. She then told me the story of what I just explained. She then said lets go because we are not patronizing a place that treats guests like this.  The sad part about this story is not only the poor service provided but this one incident will prevent my wife and now all of her nurse friends that would frequent this location after a long shift in the ER. We are also restaurant owners and know how hard it is in this business, but a poor attitude and being rude is completely unacceptable."
Terry L.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,19,,3.0,7/1/2016,"Great beer selection, great service. But that great white pizza? Not for me. Just tasted off (to go order). Also had the brussel sprouts app, which got saltier with every bite. Must have been a bad night, as I regularly go there and have not had any complaints."
Regis E.,"Weston, FL",0,63,40,1.0,9/9/2014,"The food was terrible, very inexperience servers, worst BJ's I been to so far, took some co-workers on a business trip and they where all disappointed."
Andrew M.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,2,1,1.0,2/26/2016,"The apps were good, but unfortunately that's the only nice thing I have to say. I was out to dinner with my girlfriend and parents and no one was happy with their meal. Two of us ordered the deep dish pizza and they were both doughy and under cooked. My mom ordered fish and chips that was mostly fried batter with a side of fish. On top of service that was slower than if I'd ordered delivery to my apartment. I would recommend anything over this place absolutely dreadful,"
David H.,"Falls Church, VA",324,1217,1892,4.0,3/17/2013,"Good grilled mahi platter with rice and vegetables is a filling and not ""too heavy"" lunch. Excellent beer selection, huge varied menu, and friendly staff, I'd go back."
M I.,"Jacksonville, FL",1,10,10,1.0,2/14/2016,"Where to start off...  I am writing this while I am still sitting here, waiting for my food. I've been here for two hours. Sat at the bar for 50 minutes before being seated, on a reservation, we even told the hostess that we will wait at the half full bar.  I complained about my wait time 50 minutes later and the response was well we paged you four times, no you didn't because the pager was on the bar, in front of four people. How hard was was it for the lazy hostess to walk to the bar and tell us she paged us when the pager never off???  Even the bartender said your pager never buzzed.   The manager seemed to not care, didn't apologize until I told him that this is unacceptable.   We eventually sat down, ordered our food, waited over an hour and food is still not here. The couple we ended up sitting next to also complained about their wait time and the time it took to get their food.  I am beyond disappointed, completely unacceptable, they need new management, new guide to run this good looking restaurant."
Mike B.,"Chicago, IL",3606,886,2002,2.0,1/21/2013,"Went here not based off of yelp, but based off of going to one in California.  The one in California was pretty good, the one here not so much.  First off, we sat at the bar, because that usually equals better service, this wasn't the case though.  One of the bartenders was too busy trying to clean and close up despite being open still for another 2-3 hours.   The food was also subpar, I got the ""Deep Dish"" pizza, although apparently BJ's thinks deep dish pizza equals just adding more crust.  It was mostly soggy bread and bad toppings which they seemed like they were afraid to add to the pizza.   The beer was ok, if you just want a drink it is not a bad place to go, if you want good pizza, go somewhere else.  I will not be back."
Ashley B.,"Cincinnati, OH",0,7,,4.0,12/31/2015,Food is always awesome at BJs we have one near my work back in Ohio! Staff was very friendly and very accommodating. Highly recommend!
Rob S.,"Boise, ID",51,156,148,4.0,10/14/2014,After several times passing this place finally stopped in for some lunch. The atmosphere was nice and quite. They definitely specialize more towards the pizza side of things but they have a good variety of stuff on the menu. Also a good variety of teas and lemonades.  Wife got a personal pizza she had been craving for a while and I had a taste for a burger. I got the double double cause for 45 cents more u got any extra patty over the bacon burger so why not. It was very good and plenty of food. I went to this knowing I was only going to eat half the rest for dinner. For lunch it was on the expensive side. I would have rather got less for less money especially for lunch. After drinks and everything it was over 30 dollars. That is really expensive for a lunch.  They did have some cheaper lunch options but not a ton.  Service was quick and friendly. Waitress kept the drinks filled and was there when we were done and quick with the check.  Will definitely go back to try some of the smaller lighter lunch specials.
Lizzy B.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,7,,5.0,7/31/2016,"This was our first trip to BJ's. The place was clean and cool. We could hear each other in conversation. Our server, Angela, was welcoming, friendly, and professional. Our drinks were delivered quickly. The ribs were quite delicious and the parmesean chicken was enough to share. We'll be back."
