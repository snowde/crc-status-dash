Nina H.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,2,,2.0,7/25/2016,"Dined here a few days ago and the server was unfriendly and unwelcoming. Barely smiled and never introduced herself, it was a slow night as no one else was at the bar. I ordered a Ribeye, it had no flavor and was tough. Seasoned fries were not seasoned. Only good thing were the pazookie desserts. Had a terrible experience, will not come back and definitely wouldn't recommend as there are better restaurants/service at the town center."
Ariel M.,"Jacksonville, FL",176,5,8,3.0,6/15/2014,This place doesn't close until 2am which was perfect after a late night movie at Tinseltown that let out around 12. We drive there take a seat at a booth by the bar and browse the menu. I asked for water with no ice and a lime. I literally think they boiled the water and put it in a cup. There was practically steam coming out. But anyway our waiter came every 45 secs trying to rush us to order. When we finally ordered and got our food. We weren't even 2 bites in and he was offering to bring us the check. Mind you during those brief moments he was gone you could see and hear him complain to another waiter while sitting at the bar. I understand wanting to go home at 2am when your shift ends but it was only 1230 maybe 1245. We definitely were disappointed with the services. The food was the ONLY reason it gets 3 stars. I had California chicken sandwich and double something burger
Rick C.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,15,,4.0,7/12/2016,"Last time I rated bj's I gave it 3 stars, I have moved it up to 4.  I have eaten there twice since last time and both were very good.  The food has never been a problem, it is the service.  I have noticed a vast improvement lately."
Greg R.,"Jackson, MS",19,6,,4.0,11/1/2015,"The food and service was very good here.  I got the bbq brisket burger and it tasted very good.  I'd say the order was out so quickly that it makes me doubt that it was cooked fresh, and the fries were not piping hot, but they were warm.   The service was prompt and the server was attentive and helpful with menu and beer choices.  I will return and try something different next time."
R G.,"Santa Clara, CA",2,340,8,4.0,10/14/2014,"It's a chain, but it has decent food and good service.  I had the Lemon Thyme Chicken, the sauce was a little sweet for me, but I enjoyed it."
Annie K.,"Atlantic Beach, FL",729,41,393,5.0,3/10/2015,"Came here tonight with a friend from work to grab a bite to eat before we went and had a Mani's and pedi's. It was my first time here and I wanted to stop in just never really had an excuse to. I will definitely be back and I can't wait to try all the great-looking food! Their happy hour is the best because it's half off all their appetizers with great drink specials and the best part is the appetizers a full portions! I wanted to try everything so it helped I was hungry. I had to order the calamari because I'm such a fan of it and I have to try everywhere I go. It was so tender and the seasoning of the batter was delicious you didn't even need any sauces to enjoy it even though the lemon aioli that came with it was phenomenal! I also tried the BLT salad that was so yummy with fresh bacon and egg, blue cheese with a tangy vinaigrette that complimented it So wonderfully with the fresh spinach. I also ordered the Thai wings that were cooked perfectly with this sweet yet spicy sauce they were very addicting but as you can see I ordered too much so there's always leftovers which is great. My friend ordered mozzarella sticks to start and they were so flavorful they did not seem like they were frozen the crust was seasoned and a nice crunch to reveal the Ooey gooey hot mozzarella inside she also ordered for dinner the deep dish cheese pizza that I'm definitely going to have to try next time as much as I love Pizza Hut it kind of put them to shame it was a nice crust buttery outside with fresh toasty cheese on top and you can tell the cheese is a high quality cheese .I also enjoyed a great margarita with my meal. With the food being so wonderful so was the service our server was always stopping by to check on us to see if we needed anything. Great first experience at BJ's and like I said I can't wait for my second trip!"
Beverly B.,"Jacksonville, FL",55,4,6,4.0,12/22/2015,"Good food, great service. The ribs were cooked to perfection. The cookie pie dessert was heavenly!"
Darryl C.,"League City, TX",0,12,,2.0,7/20/2014,"Calimari. Nutty brunette. Creole tilapia. Wait wasnt as long as the predicted 45 minutes. Nutty Brunette was good. I'm a fan of Newcastle, Amber Bock and Yeungling Black and Tan.  Calimari was decent, had to wait a few minutes for plates. No big deal. Gap between appetizers and entree was about 45 minutes. Luckily I had cell phone games to kill time. Waiter finally showed up after 40 minutes to check on us and saw we only had an empty plate of calamari. Someone else showed up to let us know what was happening. Apparently my fish was burnt, so they had to redo it which in turn delayed everyone else's meal. No discount, no free dessert."
Joe H.,"Jacksonville, FL",83,59,24,3.0,10/18/2015,"Loud place , seems busy but the food doesn't seem to excite me after a steak , burger , appetizers over a few trips just not impressed. I don't drink and I think this might be the appeal to most of the visitors."
Jen V.,"McKinney, TX",436,770,113,4.0,1/3/2012,"A yet another restaurant in the town center....I was impressed. When we drove up I was expecting there to be a long wait and see high prices but it wasn't that at all.   On a Saturday night, also NYE, there was little wait for a table for three.  I think there may have been a five minute wait. We ordered two of the small plates, fried artichoke and stuffed mushrooms...both amazing.   For dinner I order the Thai Salmon.  It was really good but the sauce was described as ""spicy thai sauce"" and it was not spicy at all.  If anything it was sweet because of the mango salsa.  I don't want to take away from how good it was, just not 100% what I was expecting. While focusing on dinner and not drinking I didn't try any alcoholic beverages but hear their beer is good and had my eye on the pomegranate sunset cocktail."
Samantha P.,"Jacksonville, FL",103,84,47,3.0,7/22/2014,I have never had a bad cocktail from BJs. The mixed drinks are fantastic every single time. I really loved the Gorgonzola and Pear salad... SO MUCH YUM!
Kathy C.,"Jacksonville, FL",233,553,315,2.0,12/9/2012,"We went to BJs several times for lunch and every time we walked away a little disappointed.  The food wasn't bad per se... didn't wow us either.  But the service is consistently slow.  The first time we went, it was right at lunch hour and the place had just opened.  So we understood the wait and that some rough edges need to be smoothed out.   Second time we went, we purposely picked a very early lunch to beat the lunch crowd.  The service started out decent then went really really down hill fast when the restaurant wasn't even that busy.  I had ordered the unlimited salad and soup.  The server explained that he needs to place an order one at a time.  Ok, well, guess it would be ok if he had came back to check on us.  When I was done with my first set of salad and soup and wanted to try another cup of soup, he was no where to be found.  And then, we had to really try and flag someone down to get our check cause we needed to head back to work. We did go back a third time, thinking that the food was decent and maybe we just hit bad luck when it comes to service.  Nope, still was very slow service.  With so many restaurants in the area, unfortunately I just don't see any motivation to try BJ's again."
Cara M.,"Charlotte, NC",163,31,55,4.0,4/28/2014,"I am a huge fan of BJ's restaurant. They have a huge menu, all with expertly crafted food that really stands out. I have never been disappointed with what I ordered. They also have an extensive ""healthy"" menu, with options low in fat and calories. However, you must try a pazooki. They're on the dessert menu. Basically it's a baked cookie of your choice topped with icecream. Simply to die for."
Kate Y.,"Shreveport, LA",0,2,,5.0,5/10/2015,"First visit...great atmosphere, food, beer, and service. No wait, very pleasant staff! Had the deep dish bacon chicken ranch, salad. Pizza was perfect.  K. Young, Shreveport, La."
Gina D.,"Satellite Beach, FL",0,15,,1.0,5/29/2016,Took forever to get food on Friday night about 8:30pm. No one was outside.  Waitress forget our chips and dip. This is every time we come here.  Trying to love this place but always a new server. What's the issue?
Captain H.,"Satellite Beach, FL",0,37,1,1.0,5/27/2016,"Funny, I hadn't finished my bad review from last time I was here a year ago.  Nothing has changed, service is slow despite they restaurant being half empty.  Don't come here if you're hungry."
John S.,"Jacksonville, FL",71,327,290,2.0,10/26/2012,My date had a strawberry daiquiri that I thought was disgustingly sweet.  There is such a thing as too sweet. The fried mushroom appetizer was good.  I had an iceberg salad and mini pizza which were both fine. I'm not in a hurry to go back.
Karen B.,"Jacksonville, FL",1,1,,2.0,11/16/2016,"On 11/16/16, I decided to go to BJ'S in Jacksonville Fl with my son because it was my birthday. We were very disappointed with our entire meal, and not thrilled with our server. I ordered the auhi poke with the wonton chips. First of all, it took a long time (20 mins) to come, and the chips were oily and cold, and I asked our waiter if it would be possible to get more wonton chips, which he said yes. He came back and said that he was told that there wasn't any more chips. As far as our regular meal, well, my son ordered triple decker with wedge fries, and the fries were cold, my clam chowder soup looked as if it had been sitting for a while under the heat lamp. I decided to use my coupon for the birthday pazookie, and it was basically like eating raw cookie dough with a scoop of ice cream on top, needless to say, we didn't eat it. I've always enjoyed the food at this restaurant, but tonight's meal was horrible. Perhaps, the wrong kitchen crew and servers  were  working. I think that I'll wait until I go back to California to eat at the BJ'S there."
Brooke N.,"Saint Simons Island, GA",4,135,417,5.0,3/22/2014,It was our 2nd visit to BJ's and first to the gate location. Service was quick because we came in early around 3ish for a late lunch. My husband likes the Oasis beer and really liked the cajun pasta. I was very satisfied with my blackened Mahi Mahi fish tacos. We were happy that our 2nd visit was good as the 1st time. We heard they were super slow so we decided to beat the crowd. Would recommend!!
Mark B.,"Jacksonville, FL",193,1617,4312,3.0,11/8/2014,"Well we had a big after party and from sitting in the bar first. Our party got larger and larger so. From one end of the place to the other BJ's sure handled that part of our visit. We finally found our resting spot and started the party. A couple of us ordered apps they did look good. I ended up with their jalapeno burger with some thick cut fries. My wife went with a mini pizza of chicken or something like that. The table ordered many different things for jambalaya to seafood to more pizza. My burger was cooked well but the fries stole the show. They were seasoned well with a combo that I'm not sure that I could put a finger on. On the other hand the wife's pizza was hammered. I really don't know how you make chunks of chicken dry but they have that down pat. I did notice a few of our tablemates say that the food was lacking. At least until the dessert of cookie something, caramel, and ice cream came out. With this everybody was diving in with whatever spoon or knife in my case they could find. it was yummy. Will we go back probably not and there is a BJ's just down the road from us."
