Faren L.,"Jacksonville, FL",11,16,2,2.0,4/13/2014,Haven't had a bad meal there but service is always so slow. Took forever for our drinks and bruschetta to come out
Precious J.,"Arlington, TX",46,273,861,3.0,5/16/2015,"First time here. I went on a recommendation for my sister and ordered the pulled pork sandwich, fries and coleslaw which were all tasty. We had a party of nearly 30 and everything was taken care of in a timely manner. Looking around the table there were a variety of orders from pasta, pizza and burgers didn't remember anyone complaining so that makes for a great dinner     More amazing was that the checks were split without any issues which is hardly heard of especially if groups are not seated together. They also had two waitresses tend to our table making things smooth."
Carlos C.,"Jacksonville, FL",94,131,1243,2.0,8/4/2013,"It sucks that I have to give them a low rating because I've had good meals here in the past but I am rating them on my most recent visit here and a few prior visits. Came here with a friend and sat at the bar. We ordered drinks and food. We started with Appetizers which were the Thai stuffed chicken wontons, buffalo stuffed chicken wontons and the spinach stuffed mushrooms. The starters were very good, probably the best thing of the night. So we then order our dishes, I had the 8 ounce sirloin with white cheddar mash and a wedge salad, and my friend ordered the chicken and shrimp Jambalaya. My wedge salad came out before the main dishes and it was delicious. Our dishes show up and I immediately cut into my steak to see if it was cooked right and it was but after tasting it I wanted to spit it out! It had to be the most bland, non flavorful piece of crap I have ever tasted. I had to slather it in A1 sauce just to be able to eat it. My white cheddar mash was so dry and stiff that you could probably carve out a face into it! Its sad because the white cheddar mash used to be my favorite side when I first started coming here and it was good back then.  My friend took a couple bites of the Jambalaya and suddenly stopped eating, Told me to taste It, so I tried it and it was horrible. The chicken tasted like it was frozen or had been soaked in water to long prior to cooking. We both agreed that it tasted like a ""Healthy Choice"" Microwaveable dinner plopped onto a plate and served with some overpowering spicy sauce. My friend had it remade with the sauce on the side and minus the shrimp, when the remade dish came out is when we noticed that the veggies in it looked pre-packaged and previously frozen, very unappealing to say the least. The skimpy amount of chicken was also now noticeable. The thick and excessive sauce was originally hiding that from us. Honestly, the only good thing about that dish was the rice. I didn't send my dish back, my friend originally didn't want to either because we had been out all day and haven't had anything to eat and we were very hungry at this point. The bar tender was really nice and did her best to appease us but the food just sucked and that of course is not her fault. Our tab was a little under 60 bucks for the two of us. I would suggest you take that 60 bucks and go somewhere else in town center to get a quality meal that you won't feel stupid paying 60 bucks for. Sadly my friends and I most likely won't return here again. We liked it at first but it seems the quality of the food has declined and only seems to be getting worse."
Andy L.,"Jacksonville, FL",21,214,,1.0,7/27/2013,"It's meals like this one that I hope readers give my Elite status more weight than other reviewers.  I'll jump to the conclusion and then tell you why.  I will never eat here again, or give them any of my business, or recommend anyone to go here. My wife ordered a turkey club sandwich for our son.  The sandwich came out with bread that was toasted, which the menu did not specify.  That made us look closer, and we saw that each piece of bread was moldy.  The waiter didn't even notice, and either the cook didn't notice or didn't care.  The manager came over and inspected the sandwich.  He was pretty disgusted and offered a free dessert. We've never had a great meal here, and this experience was the icing on the cake.  We'll never go back and I'll make sure that no one we know goes there for food or drinks."
K U.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,15,1,3.0,6/30/2015,"It was just OK. We had the fried artichoke appetizer. The dipping sauce that came with it was not very good, they were better without the sauce. We also had a large salad but the dressing had no flavor.  The flatbread also didn't have much taste. This was my 2nd time and I probably won't be back."
Little B.,"Beaches, Jacksonville, FL",56,65,145,4.0,5/5/2014,Tomato soup. Trust me. Great lunch place for the Deerwood working set. Easy parking and you can see it from the road... No treks through the covers of St John's TC. Always a very nice staff.
Erikka N.,"Jacksonville, FL",199,241,335,4.0,9/13/2013,"Lots of variety in draft beer, including lots of local beer....food is pretty good too, but beer is more important."
Linda B.,"Jacksonville, FL",77,176,265,2.0,11/15/2014,"This was an after party visit for a late night bite on the way home. I was really sad to have to staff give our large party, which continued to grow as we all straggled in, such a problem with seating. After moving us all over the restraunt, we finally came to rest in a fairly empty section where tables were easily added as folks came in. The table ordered a variety as you can only imagine, for the most part things looked very nice, looks are deceiving. Honey had a  jalapeño burger w/thick cut fries. The burger was cooked properly but the fries were awesome, well seasoned and super yummy. I had a white pizza w/chicken, that was severely over cooked. It was a deep dished pizza but the toppings were very close to burnt. Not something I will order again, especially in a large group. We will have to try this place again at a better time and hopefully a better experience."
Sam C.,"Palm Coast, FL",0,33,3,2.0,12/28/2015,"Not good.... The service was poor (waitress was a zombie). She went AWOL most of the time, when she did stop by the table she was lost in space. After waiting 30 minutes for our meal, she came by and told me they were out of fish & chips   and that I should pick something else. About ten minutes later (waiting for waitress to take my second order) the mgr came by and stated there was a miscommunication, my fish and chips were on the way... It took another 45 minutes to get out of here"
Ashley M.,"Jacksonville, FL",68,71,,2.0,3/26/2013,"Eh.... No.  Really.  Eh.... This is not a place I normally seek out.  I have been a few times mainly because it is nearby, reasonable happy hour and a good place to get a drink late.  Other than that, I can't really say anything about this place make me REALLY wanna go there. The food is mediocre, at best.  Another place on the ""flatbreads"" trend that seems to be popping up.  It is food that fills your belly, not food you crave and makes your tastebuds tingle. Service is usually hit or miss.  Mostly kids that do not understand what service means.  My last trip there a couple nights ago got us a waiter who had an attitude when we mentioned he just disappeared for 20 minutes.  I made sure I pointed out he was socializing with his buddy at the bar - even pulled up a seat. Food is overpriced for what it is.  But I guess you gotta pay those large cable bills for those huge flat screens somehow... Save yourself a trip and go elsewhere for a burger and beer."
Kathy T.,"Jacksonville, FL",11,18,23,2.0,8/30/2014,If you order the lunch quesadilla please know it is made from corn and flour. Not good!! Manager was nor concerned at all.
Jay B.,"Jacksonville, FL",5,29,1,4.0,3/18/2013,"When busy, parking is atrocious. Wait times can be rough too. That being said, their beer isn't as good as Seven Bridges, but is good nonetheless. The last few times I've gotten their fish and chips - it's consistent - so consistent I guess it's prepared well, well in advance. It is, however, quite tasty - so I won't complain. The thin fries are great! Update: Mahi-Mahi Tacos (Grilled) are excellent!"
Billy L.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,14,5,2.0,8/31/2014,"Food wasn't that good. Service sucked. I think the waitress was having a bad day , she spilled a drink on another table and started crying . But she wasn't good even before that.  Won't return"
Kristen C.,"Avon Lake, OH",6,79,4,4.0,1/6/2015,"The food was excellent! Service was very slow however and the restaurant was not very crowded to warrant how slow it was. Our waiter seemed very harried and unsure of restaurant policy. One person in our party had a problem with their drink order and instead of fixing it, he sent over the manager. I would visit again though, as long as time allowed for the slow service since the food was so good."
Angela K.,"Jacksonville, FL",3,29,21,2.0,2/15/2014,Can't judge a book by its Cover***Ambience is 4 out of 5 stars. They don't offer bread or chips to snack on. The food we ordered had no real appeal or memorable flavor. None of it made us moan. We ordered the stuffed mushrooms and they were okay but must've sat in the window because they were room temp. Parmesan crusted chicken was not a big deal at all. The sauce on it was bland. Broccoli served dry and cold but the mashed potatoes was decent. My husband ordered the double bacon burger and was just another burger. He gives that a 5 out of 10 rating.
Candie T.,"Bonaire, GA",1,8,13,4.0,4/2/2015,"We were looking for somewhere to have a late lunch / early dinner. We've always wanted to try BJ'S but never had the time. Today we made time and it was worth it. Mozzarella sticks were hot, fresh and perfectly fried, the fact that they were 1/2 off for happy hour was a plus. I went a bit off course and ordered a burger (jalapeño burger). The jalapeños were fried but good. The burger was a bit too charred in some spots for me but it was still good. My son ordered the bacon cheeseburger and said it was delicious. Service was great; our server was very attentive without being overbearing. Only con: when we arrived we were asked to wait while they grabbed silverware, another couple walked in after us and was seated immediately (ahead of us and without silverware). We were subsequently seated."
Chris R.,"Jacksonville, FL",15,5,,3.0,10/17/2015,"For a vast selection of different beers ranging from Pale Ales to Dark Lagers, BJs is a wonderful place to go and sample different flavors of both domestic and imported drinks. So if you are looking for a good drink you are in the right place. If you are looking for good food however, keep looking. With a few exceptions including the pizookie and avocado egg rolls, there is nothing really worth writing home (or Yelp) about. My wife will normally get the Parmesan crusted chicken with a slightly addicting heavy cream-based lemon sauce that accompanies it, which she enjoys each time. My experience is a little different though, since I have yet to find any one dish that stands out to me as anything unique and delicious, I can't say we share the same opinion. Playing it safe, I ordered a jalapeño burger that tasted like any other burger I can get in a bar or at a Chilies for a little less. Thinking I shot too low, next time we went, I figured I would treat myself and ordered a steak cooked medium-rare, off of their dinner special menu. When it came to the table it looked like it had a nice char on the outside, and was cooked just above medium rare on the inside, yet again however, it seemed like a dish I could order any where else and expect the same quality at a lower price. I couldn't help but think about my cast iron skillet at home, and how only a few days before, it produced a beautifully prepared rib eye that any true carnivore would appreciate. So to reiterate, if you are looking for drinks, pizookies, or avocado egg rolls then you are in for a treat. If you want good quality entrées, then you will find a better steak at Outback and a better burger at BurgerFi."
Diana M.,"Jacksonville, FL",91,866,,4.0,1/21/2013,"At the risk of sounding like a food snob, I have to first say that we don't typically go out to dinner on the weekends to big chain restaurants. There tends to be a super long wait for so-so food and we would rather go to a local restaurant and try something new.  My sister in law sent us a gift card for BJ's so we went in to try it out.   There was a loooonnnnggggg wait even though we called ahead so we got a couple of drinks and settled down for our wait.  We were only there about 15 minutes or so when one of the servers came over and asked if we would like a table at the bar so we jumped on that opportunity! The food was way better than either of us expected.  We ordered a pizza and a Thai chicken salad and both were very tasty.  I loved their Thai dressing, it was a little on the spicy side which was awesome.  We also ordered the red velvet cookie for dessert.  It was good, but a little overcooked for my taste. We probably never would have tried this place if not for the gift card so it was a pleasant surprise for us!!"
Lizzy C.,"Jacksonville, FL",175,80,103,4.0,1/29/2013,"I have been here a few times & it is ""hit or miss"". Tonight I went with a girl friend for happy hour & we enjoyed 1/2 priced wine & appetizers. The service was speedy & attentive & our food came out hot & delish (we had goat cheese/veggie flatbread, avocado egg rolls & chicken lettuce wraps).  There was way more lettuce than filling in our wraps, but nothing to complain too much about.  && the dipping sauces are awesome! With that being said, the previous time I came here I actually got foot poisoning!  I think this was just a fluke, but it has changed my opinion somewhat."
Mike M.,"St Johns, FL",4,31,11,3.0,9/23/2013,Great food and beer. Really slow service. I would have had four or five beers but my cup was empty all the time and the help was no where in sight. This is the third time we've been here and same thing. Food is great and seems to be help is everywhere and service is just slow. I had the jalapeno burger and my wife had the bison burger. great stuff. It just took forever.
