Khristopher B.,"Jacksonville, FL",133,93,95,4.0,4/8/2014,"I desperately wanted to give BJ's a five-star rating and, in all honesty, I may go back and do so in a few weeks. But I'm being stubborn and not doing so now because I'm hurt that they discontinued one of my favorite dishes - the blonde shrimp. Still, this restaurant gets the highest of four-star ratings from me for several reasons. First, I enjoy the wide array of beer, chocolate raspberry being my favorite. Second, I have never received bad service from this place and I've been there more than I've been to any other restaurant in Jacksonville ever (and that includes fast food spots). Third, as a huge NBA fan, a restaurant will always get extra points from me by keeping ESPN or NBAtv on the nearby televisions. It's the same reason why I gave Mellow Mushroom such high remarks. Finally, the place is spacious and clean and still gives me the ability to have an intimate dining experience with my beloved. I've noticed lately that they've changed some menu items, which really brings me a tear, but the Santa Fe spring rolls remain, one of my favorites. Overall, I'm in love with this place - even though seafood, my favorite food, isn't BJ's specific specialty."
Wes C.,"Jacksonville, FL",39,12,,2.0,10/28/2012,"Have to go with 2 stars.  The place is nice, lots of tvs for the games today, and I love their large and varied menu.  All that would have gotten them 3 stars.  But otday the service SUCKED.  We had a party of 7 and were seated at the large corner booth (fine, we have a couple of kids, it works).  Initial service/order went fine, and the two salads ordered were out fairly quickly.  The entrees soon followed and it went downhill from there. First, I ordered the mahi-mahi fish tacos, which is my go to dish.  Last time they were great.  This time, they had sat under the heat lamp so the tortillas got dried out.  Still tasted fine, but I don't like my soft tacos to be masquerading as crispy tacos.  Again, the quality of the food was fine overall. But we hardly saw our waitress after that.  The salad plates remained on the table even after the entrees came.  I did get a drink refill, but again no finished plates were removed.  I was about to ask the manager to turn off the cloaking device, because obviously none of the wait staff could see the growing pile of dishes.  Remember, this is a table fo seven, so the dishes add up fast.  The waitress returned to inquire about desert.  Again no dishes left.  Checks came before the desert did: no dishes left.  Had to wait about 15 minutes for desert (at least, we lost track of time it took so long).  Still no dishes left the table. I'm sorry, but that is one of the basics of service: keep the table cleared of enmpty dishes, drinks full, and inquire if you can do more (hmm, upsale too maybe, huh?) She got my littlest tip of the year, and I'm usually fairly generous.  The wife is sour on the place anyway, so now it's on the 'No!' list. BJs, you blew it."
Kelly C.,"Jacksonville, FL",57,191,51,3.0,10/12/2012,"I've been going to BJs since forever and when I moved from California and saw this place, I was excited! I've been talking about coming to get their pizookie and I finally had a chance tonight!  I don't know if they changed their recipe or if the cook just messed up somehow but the cookie was so nasty! I was shocked and SUPER disappointed.  No more pizookies for me... at least not from this BJs. Outside of that, it was fine.  Our server was nice and always came around to check on us.  We just ordered appetizers and those were fine too.  Nothing to rave about."
Mike N.,"Jacksonville, FL",1,99,1,2.0,8/1/2015,"The Spinach stuff mushroom was good. I probably wouldn't order it again since it is a one time thing item to try. The Hawaiian mahi-mahi was good. The server took about 10 minutes before he even came over to my table. After I order, I waited too long during lunch to wait for my main entree to arrive. I waited about 25 minutes. Total 35 minutes to get my food. I was a bit frustrated since I had to rush to eat my food to get back to work."
E L.,"Jacksonville, FL",7,3,,1.0,8/1/2014,"Went into BJ's tonight expecting to sit down and have a good meal with my family, set down fairly quickly. Which was awesome, the problem came when my server didn't come to the table. She walked past about 8 times never acknowledged us. I had to send my husband to the front to report that we hadn't even been served by that time I was fed up and just left. Thanks for the none service. I guess I have to go to daytona from now own anytime I want BJ's. Disappointed"
Julie O.,"Jacksonville, FL",7,16,6,4.0,8/1/2012,"Pizza is good, maybe a bit of slow waitresses. But BJ's is the only place that i actually allow myself to drink their brewed root beer. Anywhere else, i'll spit it right out. It's that good. Haha that's all i wanted to say."
Jon M.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,5,,1.0,6/19/2014,"The food was less than satisfactory. I ordered a burger and it looked like a mcdonalds beef patty, and I am sure the mcdonald's beef would have tasted better.  The service was lack luster at best. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone."
Deirdre H.,"Fruit Cove, FL",35,43,18,1.0,5/31/2014,"Just say NO. BJs is a big disappointment in Florida. In California the chain was very good. Here, it was awful.  Poor service. Waiter was talking to the bartender about who he was going have a FWB with and the conversation that followed was a little disturbing. Food tasted frozen and boring. I won't be back."
Carla H.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,4,,2.0,6/7/2014,"Surprise there was no wait, but when I got the food I understood.  Salad had either too much dressing for one of my party or not enough.  The cost for the scallops was to expensive for too little food. Taste of the scallops had too much pepper that you could not taste anything else.  Had to ask for more honey lime dressing. Other guest ordered fish and chips but no chips on plate.  It came between 5-10 min later.  Also the scallops was cold along with the chicken on the other guests salad.  Again not enough dressing.  Are they trying to save money on dressings and taste ? Also when dropping off salad make sure the customers have utensils."
Jim S.,"Kitty Hawk, NC",0,2,,5.0,3/28/2014,"In Jax for business for 6 weeks. Needless to say ill be dining out almost every night. I  went to BJ's Brewhouse mostly because it said ""brewhouse."" They have a pretty extensive menu but from the looks of it, pizza was their specialty.  FOOD: The deepdish pizza was not an authentic Chicago style deep dish. That didnt bother me because it was outstanding. I ordered the stuffed mushrooms for an app and a small deep dish pizza. both were outstanding, perfect size.  PRICE: You don't have to break bank to eat here. Appetizer prices are reasonable and same with entrees.  BEER: They have almost every style beer that they brew themselves, plus all the major beer brands. I ordered their lager and then there ""award winning"" beer Grand Cru (Belgian Strong Ale). The Grand Cru did not disappoint. For under $6.00 i got a beer that is on the level with beer that i have paid $15.00+. Ordered it both times i went and will get a growler before I leave.  SERVICE & ATMOSPHERE: Service was okay. I've had better service and I've had worse. Good looking bar and decor.  BOTTOM LINE: Its worth going. Ive gone twice and I will definitely go again."
Anne-Marie B.,"Houston, TX",171,234,121,3.0,6/17/2012,"I have been a fan of BJ's Brewhouse for YEARS. That being said, I was disappointed when they opened one in Jacksonville because I know what we Jacksonvillians like to do with good restaurant concepts; take them and make them obnoxiously mediocre. Had I written this review prior to my most recent visit, I probably would have tacked on an extra star.  Unfortunately, the experience I just had was completely ridiculous. Myself and 3 others went for lunch. Our server walked up as the 4th member was joining. She had no sooner sat down and gone to take her purse off her shoulder when he immediately asked if we were all ready to order. Obviously, we were not, nor were we when he returned about 45 seconds later. This time, he asked and one member in our party said she was not quite ready but she'd go last to order. I was halfway through relaying my order to the server when he interrupted me and said, ""I'll give you some more time"" and walked away. (for anyone who's interested, this was the point in the meal when I determined what percentage of my $10 bill was going to go towards his tip...) Once he finally returned, we ordered. I got the buffalo chicken deep dish pizza, and the rest were simple orders as well. We sat there for an excessively long time waiting for our meal, so the manager finally walked up and apologized for the inconvenience and assured us that our order would be out shortly. About 10 minutes later, our food came. Here's where it gets really disappointing:  Flash back to a year ago when I saw the construction sign that said a BJ's Brewhouse was opening in August. I sold it to all of my friends as a place that was consistently good, straightforward food... ...then came the buffalo chicken pizza. Words cannot describe how ravenously hungry I was at the point that I received my pizza, and by the appearance of it as it sat in front of me, it'd been sitting in the window under a heat lamp for easily 20 minutes. The chopped celery that was on top as a garnish was wilted and dry, the cheese was rubbery and disgusting, and the crust was lukewarm. I was SO disappointed. You let me down, BJ's!"
Nikki R.,"Jacksonville, FL",15,6,,2.0,5/2/2014,"Super slow service!! Managers that walk around like they have better things to do. Being in the restaurant industry myself, my expectations are high. This place missed the mark completely. The place has potential to be great, if it were run better."
Scott H.,"Dallas, GA",0,8,,4.0,6/6/2012,"Looks great both inside and out.  The bar was real attractive with the lit up top shelf alcohol bottles, multiple beer taps (many home brewed), and 4 large flat screen HD tvs. Went with a couple of co-workers and split a large pizza to go with some of their home made brews that we sampled before we ordered them. I enjoyed all:  pizza, atmosphere, beer and the company.  The menu had tons of choices...reminded me of Cheesecake Factory's menu, with so many diverse choices."
Gregg K.,"Jacksonville, FL",14,86,9,4.0,8/18/2014,The wife and I went on a Sunday for lunch. Ordered two flat bread pizzas and two salads. Also beer. I gotta tell ya the flat bread was the best I ever had. California club pizza. So yummy. There tomato mozzarella salad was sooooo good. Service was excellent and we will try for dinner next time.
Super D.,"Ocala, FL",0,3,,1.0,4/24/2015,Don't bother. Service is poor and slow and the food was so so. Over priced. Good wi-fi.
Deepan M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",1392,179,49,4.0,4/6/2013,Blue cheese bacon burger is amazing. 5 Meat deep dish pizza has tons of flavor and stringy stretchy cheese. Yummy!
Lovie T.,"Baltimore, MD",0,13,2,4.0,7/7/2012,"I'm surprised by the bad reviews. Have been there twice and had take-out once. I've been totally happy both time. The first time, our server was awesome. The food was yum (avocado rolls were weird, but good and pizza was great!!!). The second time we sat outside and it was really nice except the smoking, but that's not the restaurant's fault. We had pizza again and it was delicious again. Then, recently we got a pizza to go and it was great even after 10 minutes in the car. The crust on their pizza is the best for real.  It is pretty loud inside. But, since it's so big, I would expect it to be. Their homemade beers are pretty good. They also have homemade root beer, which was yummy.  Overall, I will definitely go here again."
Eric P.,"Daphne, AL",3,27,2,2.0,3/26/2014,"SLOOOOOOOOOW...  This is the second time I've tried BJ's for lunch in two different states and it took me 45 minutes to get my food.  There's something wrong with either their staffing model or kitchen plan, because it should not take that long for chicken tacos the size of tacitos!!"
Pedestrian P.,"Jacksonville Beach, FL",2,35,,1.0,8/27/2013,The bullet: never mind - this place just does not warrant anymore words than necessary. Spend your dollars elsewhere. Staff is inept at best and the quality is mediocre for the price point. I usually don't rate chains but this spot is a definite pass. There are at least a dozen better places to eat within walking distance and that includes Chik-fil-a and Arbys!
Matt S.,"St. Augustine, FL",63,515,58,4.0,7/21/2013,"On a recent excursion to the Town Center, my wife and I were deciding on a place to grab lunch. We generally head to Whisky River, however we wanted to try something new, and we had yet to visit BJ's. I was surprised to see that even as we arrived for lunch on a Saturday, the parking lot was completely full, and there were plenty of tables open, however we opted for sitting at the bar area. The restaurant is wide open, with plenty of room to move about, and the bar area was clean and offered comfortable seats with views of a flatscreen TV with four different channels on it. I am a beer lover, and was fairly impressed with the selection of draft beers available- glad they lived up to the Brewhouse part of their name. Nothing incredibly impressive, but a nice selection of national and even their own craft brews. We ordered some beers and decided to skip the appetizer, but we did see a lot of tasty plates being ushered past us while we were trying to decide our meals. The majority of items on the menu were actually pizza related, with a few chicken, beef, pasta, and sandwiches / burgers thrown in the mix. I chose the california burger which arrived in a timely manner, and it was pretty darn tasty, and exactly as I ordered it. The beef was tender and juicy, topped with delicious fresh veggies, avocados, and tasty cheesy goodness. I also really enjoyed the shoestring french fries that came with it, they were very delicious. The wife and I both cleared the plates and put down a few pints of Samuel Adams Summer Ale, and had  a good experience doing it. Our server was very attentive, got everything correct, and took good care of us- overall, I had a great experience at BJ's. I would bet this place is a nightmare during busy eating hours or during holiday shopping season at the Town Center- however if you can stop in during the off hours, I would recommend it. The food was delicious, service great, and loved the selection of beers. Would have no problems coming back, and I will probably have to try some of that pizza."
