Dotty R.,"Saint Louis, MO",38,141,58,4.0,5/2/2014,"Good, Good, Good! Flew in to Jax and we met up with Vince's pal here to eat. It was pouring down rain, but the views inside/out were still very nice! The atmosphere was family friendly, but there were also a lot of adults and a very nice bar area. There were flatscreens as well and we watched several different games going on. The food was good and also the staff. I will revisit BJ's when I revisit Jax."
Dj S.,"Jacksonville, FL",22,47,71,5.0,9/8/2013,"I like getting BJ's, probably one of the best BJ's I've ever had. Oh the burgers are good  too."
Fred S.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,13,,4.0,2/10/2014,"This really was the best cheeseburger I have had in a long time and worth $10.00. Hand made patty and cooked perfectly to my specs, (well done).  My friend had mahi tacos and I tasted them, they were delicious, I can't wait to go back and order them next time.  Drinks are expensive, but hey have some water!"
Tanya O.,"Orange Park, FL",10,22,5,3.0,12/11/2013,"First time we went on Halloween Wednesday night for our anniversary dinner. Parmesan chicken was excellent.  Loved the service,  great beer sampler. Husband had a veggie pizza but its definitely not Chicago deep dish. Needed more sauce.  2nd time was horrible, Saturday night.  Long wait. How about the staff did NOTHING about the 3 brats who kept playing in the revolving door and nearly hurt Quite a number of guests trying to use the door.  The waiter was nice but it took forever for anything.  By the time I got my soup my dinner was ready. And it was bland. Stick to a weekday dinner if you want better service and food."
Amy A.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,14,2,3.0,5/23/2014,"I have very mixed feelings about this restaurant. They have the most amazing cream soda, orange soda and root beer. I more than drink my full when I go. (I actually se times mix cream soda and orange soda and it's amazing!) the food is pretty good. Now here is where I get frustrated, I have been there 3 different times and all 3 times the service was awful. I have waited on average 1.5-3 hours for my food. Which is insane. I honestly wouldn't have gone back after the first time that occurred but I have a friend that always has his birthday dinners there :-/"
Jim R.,"Orange Park, FL",1,4,,2.0,7/5/2013,"After catching a movie on the 4th of July, my wife and I weren't in the mood to head home and cook.  So, we decided to grab a bite out with our two sons (12 & 14).  I was in the mood to try a place that we hadn't visited yet.  After gravitating toward St. John's Town Center, we ended up at BJ's. Both the exterior and the interior give off a promising vibe.  Going by looks, you know BJ's is a chain; but, it gives the impression of a chain closer to Carraba's than Olive Garden, if you know what I mean. As they weren't busy, we were seated immediately.  Within seconds of being seated, our waiter was at table side asking for drink orders.  At most places, this might be a good thing.  However, BJ's calls themselves a Brewhouse.  Please give me a minute or two to peruse the selection of beers, if that is your specialty. The waiter, who spoke at a pace that would rival the guy from the old FedEx commercials, came back a few minutes later.  I forget the names of the brews my wife and I ordered.  She got a paler one that is recommended with a lemon wedge.  I got the Irish Red.  We also ordered an appetizer of mozzarella sticks.  Fast talker asked if we were ready to order our entrees.  Dude, we barely had time to look at the the beer list.  Give us a minute. He came back a few minutes later with our drinks.  We decided to order one of their specialties, a deep dish pizza with meatballs, sausage, tomatoes and jalapeños.  At this point, everything looked promising.  The beers were cold and tasty.  The pizza looked great on the menu.  Plus, we had fried cheese on the way.  The fast talking waiter was a bit too eager.  But, that that is much better than an inattentive one. The first sign of average, at best, food came with the cheese sticks.  Not that they were bad, mind you.  Just that they were exceedingly average.  I expect that they were of the frozen variety and not hand made fresh in-house.  We were getting pretty hungry at that point and they were passable. Then, the ""deep dish"" pizza came out.  While the pizza looked OK, it also was not like any deep dish pizza that I ever had.  Let me clarify something.  I know that this is a chain.  I wasn't expecting a pizza that would rival the best of Chicago.  I was expecting something at least the equivalent of Pizzeria Uno's. A deep dish pizza should have a nice bite to it.  Not too thick.  But, sturdy enough to hold up to the toppings.  The sides should be vertical, as the dough is pressed up the sides of the pan.  The bottom and sides should have a nice texture that is enjoyable to bite through. This was a limp mess.  I can't even necessarily call it undercooked, as the crust had a nice, golden brown color to it.  It simply had no ""body"".  It was thick, limp and doughy instead of crisp, sturdy and hearty.  The toppings were plentiful except for the jalapeños, which were diced to an almost imperceptibly small size. While we should have sent it back and ordered something else, we were very hungry at this point and did not.  I had a couple of pieces.  My wife and two sons had one each.  My wife asked for a cup of tomato bisque, which came quickly and was good. All in all, a very disappointing experience."
Amanda T.,"Hilton, NY",28,15,1,2.0,6/28/2012,"I was not impressed with the service or the food. This was my first and last visit. I ordered the ""Chicken Fettuccini Alfredo"" with blackened chicken.  The chicken on top was luke warm, the pasta over-cooked, and the worst of all offenses the Alfredo was milk colored water. The server was not attentive to refills. He seemed upset we did not order any beer and gave obviously better service to the next table over. One additional pet-pevee, the small two person table we were sat at was SMALL. My poor 6'4"" husband was not comfortable."
Kendra M.,"Fremont, CA",1,11,1,3.0,9/14/2013,"The food is average, I got the Parmesan crusted chicken which was pretty much flavourless, the boyfriend loved his burger though(: the only reason I would return would be for our waitress, she was great, maybe the best I've ever had! But maybe only for lunch considering both times I've been my food hasn't been worth the price, and I'll have to give it one last try (:"
Ryan H.,"Denver, CO",126,330,193,3.0,11/24/2013,"This place isn't so bad. At least my experiences haven't been as bad as other people reviews. The food is average and I haven't had anything that sent me over the top, but I've never had anything that was terrible. I did have a hamburger that was a horrible concept and I take the blame for even ordering it. Not sure why they have it on the menu because it's a terrible combination and a heart attack waiting to happen. It's a solid 3 stars teetering on 4. The service has always been pretty good when I've been there. It's very open and the decor is nice. Seems clean to me whenever I've been in there and the bathrooms are clean. I haven't tried the new one they just built near my house on the northside, but I will soon."
Christi S.,"Jacksonville, FL",68,39,214,5.0,1/19/2012,"The first time we went to BJs, we went to the one in Orlando and we were blown away with how great the service was. The Jacksonville location is no exception. We dined at BJs this afternoon and had Steven as our server. Steven is as good of a waiter as it gets - he was friendly, attentive and made sure that our entire experience was nothing less than perfect. For our appetizer, we ordered crispy fried artichokes and chicken wontons - both were scrumptious. For my entree, I got ""The Works"" deep dish pizza which was delicious and my boyfriend ordered a pulled pork sandwich which was spectacular. If you're looking for a great dining experience, I highly recommend this place!"
Kara P.,"Jacksonville Beach, FL",19,16,95,3.0,2/23/2014,"I ordered the pulled pork sandwich after asking the waiter if he thought the Applewood smoked bacon burger or the pulled pork was better. The sandwich was ginormous and extremely filling. I had to pick the top bun off it. The coleslaw was a little too sweet for my personal preference but the Potatoe wedge fries were delicious.  My friends and I order the pazooki party platter and that was quite good.  A little pricey but when you're celebrating you tend to not mind so much. The white chocolate macadamia pazooki is the one I had and it was just as good as any other cookie I've had. Not overly special but satisfied my sugar craving. Overall I thought it was a fun atmosphere with several different younger families with children 2 and under there, (so they really are kid friendly) and out waiter was very if not overly attentive to us. I would recommend this restaurant despite some of the negative reviews.  I know I'm going back; I have to try their root beer!"
Ouida P.,"Charlottesville, VA",152,53,311,4.0,11/8/2013,"The Thai Salmon was delicious and our server was great. The parking lot seemed full but we were seated immediately. I have a sweet tooth and the red velvet pizookie was still too sweet for me, the oatmeal one was just right."
Eric H.,"Jacksonville, FL",1,8,5,3.0,3/20/2015,"Good food.  Not great food.  The pizza is my favorite thing here.  In general, the beer and wine prices are high.  I'm not sure about happy hour.  Plenty of seating and large tvs for watching games.  I had the mahi mahi tacos.  They were good, but only served with some corn chips.   Rice and beans would make it more of a meal."
Colby S.,"Jacksonville, FL",26,15,,4.0,8/13/2013,"BJ's has good food all around and a lot of variety. It can be pretty loud, so it feels like a sports bar. They also have pretty good happy hour deals. Pricing is pretty average."
Mr.Nole O.,"Tallahassee, FL",0,16,,5.0,5/1/2014,"Favorite restaurant in jax love the beer, food , and staff been there for my last 4 dates"
Justin N.,"Jacksonville, FL",34,7,2,3.0,8/28/2013,Food was pretty good. Had their bbq chicken pizza. I would get it again if someone else was generous enough to buy.  Beer was crazy expensive. 17.50ish a pitcher? Whats that about. It was nothing that special to demand such a premium in comparison to other local brewers in jax. Service was good.
Larry O.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,3,,4.0,2/22/2016,"bjs has become a favorite of my wife and I, we always have great service and the food quantity and quality is excellcent"
Ann S.,"St. Augustine, FL",0,1,,5.0,4/5/2013,"This place is Awesome! They have a selection of low calorie meals that taste good and actually fill you up.  The salmon and santa fe rolls are my favorite, but everything I've tried there has been amazing. I've never had an issue with service and I go at least every other week."
Debbi C.,"Jacksonville, FL",196,169,169,1.0,1/12/2013,We have been here 3 times and are using three strikes they are out.  We sat and waited for the server well over 5 minutes each time. The food was mediocre at best but we waited over 30 minutes to get it. We ordered soup and house salad the last visit and waited 34 minutes. Then they just brought the salad. Drinks were never refilled. Sad... Sad... Sad.
Michael Z.,"St. Petersburg, FL",150,402,5,4.0,2/18/2013,"BJ's is a chain that under promises and over delivers.  The quality and variety of brews on tap makes it enjoyable to mix and match the different flavors and textures while pairing it with your meal.  The food generally tastes good and the menu has enough variety to be unique, without taking it to the Cheesecake Factory extreme of offering everything under the sun."
