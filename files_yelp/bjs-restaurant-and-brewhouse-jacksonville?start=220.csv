Jeff P.,"Jacksonville, FL",28,113,26,3.0,10/1/2011,This was my third time here and appearantly when they are busy you don't matter as much. The hostes and managers were quite rude and short and if was not for the great personality of our server we would have walked out. I got the BJ's Burger and the thin fries burger was fine but the fries were soggy and not very good. My wife got the pulled pork and the steak fries both were good but not sure if we would get it again. The beers though are really good and should be your main draw to this establishment.
JR M.,"Jacksonville, FL",80,21,,3.0,11/8/2011,Stopped in for lunch in the middle of the week. Service was extremely slow considering there were less than 20 people in the whole place. Tried the BBQ beef sandwich. Overall it was pretty good with a solid BBQ sauce also topped with fried onion straws. The food was fine but the service was lacking.
Deb S.,"Jacksonville, FL",31,39,1,2.0,11/26/2011,Made reservations for a birthday dinner only to arrive and find they didn't know anything about the reservation.  Hostess was snotty and not helpful...actually had an attitude initially when I killed her with kindness.  Luckily the restaurant wasn't busy and they were able to set up the tables for our group.  Food was your garden variety franchise food - nothing special.
June B.,"Saint Johns, FL",0,23,5,3.0,12/7/2013,Appetizer came out slow. In my opinion both appetizer and entrée could have been hotter. Wondering how long they sat before they were served. Food was tasty.
S K.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,26,,4.0,9/8/2013,"Good food, good service, reasonable prices.  I had the pot roast, my wife had the veggie burger.  We both had salads and drinks.  60 bucks which included the tip.  What's not to like!"
Chuck S.,"White Oak, GA",2,4,,5.0,2/7/2012,Food was outstanding and service was excellent.  Completly satisfied today. Thank you Kaylyn for a great lunch.
Elena R.,"Jacksonville, FL",1,7,,4.0,9/6/2011,"Met a friend there for a late Saturday lunch. I have no complaints! The menu is varied, with selections to please the pickiest eater. And, of course, the beer selection is incredible!  The service was very good as well. The waitress was very quick and very efficient. We started out with two small appetizers from the Snacks and Small Bites selection: the fried artichokes and the mozzarella and tomato salad. Both were good.  I had the sesame chicken salad, and asked that it not be dredged in dressing. It came out perfectly, ahem, dressed. The portion was generous; I had to take half of it home with me.  The whole place had an energetic feel to it. This is not an intimate place - you have to speak up to carry a conversation. On the other hand, because it is loud, it's kid-friendly. If the kids are a little on the loud side, they hopefully won't disturb other patrons.  I can't wait to go back!"
Mary N.,"Newnan, GA",0,2,,2.0,12/1/2013,Stopped by here while shopping in the town center and ate lunch. The beer is good but the food was terrible. I had a bbq pork sandwich. It was disgusting. It had way to much sauce on the bread and the bread was burnt. The fries were dry and the server spilt beer on my husband. Not a good experience and I will not return.
Nicole J.,"Atlantic Beach, FL",0,8,,4.0,8/10/2013,"I saw complaints about the staff but when I went here (on a busy Saturday night no less!) we had great service. I tried their speciality root beer and it was very tasty. The balsamic glazed chicken with mashed potatoes was delicious, and I split the BJ brownie with my daughter, two of us together could not finish it!"
Wendy G.,"Jacksonville, FL",33,26,,2.0,4/18/2012,"I was a little disappointed with the quality of this place.  Yes, the outside is appealing and the bar is as well  First off- I dont quite understand why happy hour is only allowed at the bar - What is the difference between sitting at the bar or at the table? What a way to cheap out BJ's!  So after ordering my $11 cosmo which sort of tasted like a mixture of water, sugar, and  a shot of grenadine  - we recieved our Avocado rolls which sounded delicious! - They were mediocre at best - The Avocado rolls were very soggy and drenched in grease - I could barely taste any other flavors except avocado. I love avocado just not deep fried in grease.  Then, on to the main course - I ordered a chicken ceasar salad - It was OK at the best but nothing to write home about - very dissapointing  - you would think for approximately $15 a plate you can do better ! I probably will not come back anytime soon."
Matt C.,"Jacksonville, FL",11,4,,4.0,12/13/2012,"Awesome place overall... The draft beer is pretty expensive though, and they don't have Bud on draft."
Rick D.,"Charlotte, NC",75,249,3580,2.0,9/25/2011,"The Music Was great! Yep that was about it....We waited for nearly an hour and a half for our table, which you know as well as I do if the service and food are great, it doesn't matter. My first impressions is this place was like a warehouse with the warmth of one. Well we got our seat (outside) the waitress was very attractive and friendly, they changed the TV to the college game we wanted to watch and we placed our apps order. The wife and I had the stuffed mushrooms, they were good. I ordered the Knife and Fork Roast beef sandwich (TWICE). It appears they prep their plates in advance and warm them when you order, the key word being WARM. The potato's were think like instant with not enough water added the meat laid on top, the plate looked very nice but it was not hot enough to eat. I let the waitress know she got the manager involved and he made me a fresh plate. Kudos for them trying to make it right and eventually taking it off the bill. The brand new plate of food come out looking like the first (PRE MADE looking) and just as luke warm. Let me tell you I like military and Hospital food and for me not to eat Roast beef, it has to be pretty unsatisfying. The wife had the Flat bread she said not bad but not as good as Black Finn's another couple ordered the pizza and it was not BAD, it was ok. The beer & Wine is over priced. When you take it all together the total of all 8 people at the table it was just OK! So if you live in any other part of town save your money and stay where you live...it really is not worth the traffic hassle to eat mediocre food. If you want good Pizza go to Carmines, Good Roast Beef hit the Metro Diner, Pre-prepped food go to Burger King, or Hardee's. If you feel the need to eat at St Johns Town Center there are many other places to eat better food (Black Finn, Capitol Grill, Ted's Steak House Etc.) In my opinion nothing at this restaurant worth checking out."
A E.,"Fruit Cove, FL",0,33,10,2.0,6/24/2013,"I have been to this restaurant a few times. The beers are quite good and always served cold. If that is all you order there.. Five stars are in order. Service is good and cheerful. BUT the food I've ordered has always been sub par and not worth the 12 to 15 dollars they ask for. I tried their ""light"" menu and was looking forward to some salmon with mango salsa and some veggies over cuscus. It was overly cooked and the carrots looked old and wilted. The cuscus was lumpy and cold, while the salmon was dry and sauceless.. My wife's seared mahi salad was ok.. Not great but just ok. So keep to the burgers and beer! Oh and the stink of propane in their Patio area was borderline intoxicating. When we complained about it, they just said the pilot light on the heaters sometimes blows out.... Um, why on earth would you have the heaters even anywhere remotely on the ready mid summer with even the nights being 85 degrees."
Pat C.,"Orange Park, FL",0,15,,4.0,9/10/2011,"First time to the recently opened BJ's Brewhouse.  Nice beer selection and the bar is a great place to watch sports.  The menu is quite extensive and has everything from nice meals to pizzas, salads and burgers.  There were some great looking meals going by us.  The Thai shrimp lettuce wrap appetizer was excellent.  We will definitely be going back!"
K W.,"Jacksonville, FL",4,3,,2.0,10/1/2011,"we ordered the appetizer sausage pizza.what sausage? it was very hard to find,it was mostly cheese and slices of   chicken fried steak was greasy and tasted as if had been frozen for a looong time.the gravy they put over two pieces may have  been 2 ozs worth.good beer,good tea,good desserts.big portions,good service.the menu is just too extensive.can one kitchen really prepare this variety of foods properly??"
