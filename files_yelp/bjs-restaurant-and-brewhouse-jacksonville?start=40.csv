Cay O.,"East End, U.S. Virgin Islands",0,70,1,1.0,10/23/2016,Here on a Sunday for NFL. Soooo disappointed. Walked in to see a long haired blond manager berating the hostess and the young hostess handled herself beautifully. Tried to acknowledge us even though the manager would not stop bitching at her. She smiles and tried to do her job anyway. Felt so badly for her but her parents would be proud. Proceeded to watch game and get 5 really awful appetizers. Most cold and tasteless. We aren't picky either. Hungry and Want to watch the game and have a few snacks. This was awful. Waitress we got was decent. Gray haired bearded gentleman who seemed to also be a manager ran around while this blond manager was Awful to everyone working. I'll never come back. So gross.
Monique H.,"Jacksonville, FL",173,64,101,2.0,1/5/2017,"I'm happy for this place, for it being so busy. But, the few times we were there, it was just average. Average selection and average quality. I wish I could say I somewhat enjoyed it."
Mary G.,"Jacksonville, FL",97,4,,4.0,4/17/2017,"Went on Easter Sunday so they were a little understaffed, which is understandable.  We love the avacado egg rolls and it's one of the main reasons we go there, but they were out of those  so we got the spinach and artichoke dip instead. It was good but not like the egg rolls. We tried the new prime rib that they had on the menu and it was delicious, however, over a 1/3 of the steak was all fat which was kinda disappointing. They were very nice to our kids and our server John was good.  We've always had a good experience at this particular BJ's. The place is always clean, I love that they have a family restroom as well. It's conveniently located right off of JTB-202 near lots of shopping and other restaurants."
Madders M.,"Flagstaff, AZ",2,37,9,1.0,1/18/2017,"First off let me say that we have been going to BJs for years and we absolutely love it. So last Saturday night we had a date night with 2 of our friends and decided to go to BJs again (we had our last date night there too, the menu is just so big it's always the best bet) so we got to BJs around 7:40 pm and we walked it to about four hostesses at the stand and not one of them greeted us. I had to politely interrupt their personal conversation to put our name in, she said ""40 minutes what's your phone number"" .. nothing else. So whatever, we've all been annoyed at work and had bad days so we brushed it off, I noticed there was open seating at a bar table and let the hostess know that she could take our name  off of the list because we chose to sit at the ""first come first served"" in a bar booth. Well, we may as well have waited the 40 minutes because that's how long it took to even get a menu. ""A"" menu, as in 1 was dropped off at the table with a comment of ""we are out menus"" which is fine but how about a ""hi sorry we are short on menus I'll bring one right over when I can"" anyway, like I said we all have bad days. Our server, I can't remember his name, slender blonde guy, was not happy that we sat in his section. It took a good 30 minutes to get our drinks. Then after that, a good 40-45 minutes just to get our appetizers. Mind you, we like to enjoy ourselves when we go out, appetizers, alcohol, main entree, and desert and we tip very well. We are a waiters dream. And I can say that because I was a waitress for many years. Anyway, our drinks were always empty, and we had to ask for refills that took 30 minutes. The appetizers were cold when they came out, we had the calamari and wings and the other couple had stuffed mushrooms. All cold. Then 20 minutes after that our pizza came out. I couldn't believe what they placed in front of me. I took a picture, and not for instagram, but to put on my bad yelp review. I could not believe that a cook or server/food runner would deem that acceptable. I am not kidding you, we ordered a half cheese/pepperoni pizza. One half literally was nothing but crust, the other had a few sprinkles of cheese and some crusted pepperoni on the crust. It was like a blind man made the pizza, no sauce no cheese, nothing. I couldn't believe it. And in top of that, it was COLD! Our waiter walked over and asked how everything was, pretty frustrated at this point I said actually not so happy, would you look at this pizza. He even looked at it, wide eyed and said ""yeah, wow, that's bad"" he said we can make another one. By that time I was over it, we had already been there for an hour and a half and I wasn't about to wait 40 min more. I politely declined and told him that we would be fine. I ate one slice and was so dissaponted. I am so used to the amazing flavor of your pizza and was truly craving it. Plus it was the last night before my diet so I was extra mad! Anyway, he said he would have his manager come over and we told him it's really not a big deal and he insisted. Well, the manager never came over and then he swung by and said ""I'm going to go ahead and take $10 off your bill"" I'm sorry, $10!? How about the uneaten pizza gets taken off our bill!? We didn't even eat it and it couldn't even be considered a ""pizza"" I was so shocked. After all we ordered, we got a $10 comp. I'm not asking for a free meal, but seriously, take the item off that we didn't eat... anyway, I didn't get to order a pazooki because at that time it was so late and everyone was over it. I just want you to know what a horrible expierence we had, service & food."
Cathrine C.,"Newport News, VA",389,343,506,4.0,9/20/2014,"Oh gotta love this place. I came here with my cousins to eat since both of them have never been before and they fell in love!  I used to go a lot in San Diego to drink with some friends and have lunch,  so I'm glad there's one here in Jacksonville!  For appetizers, my cousins got calamari and a pizza dip served with bread chips. Calamari is always good here,  never have been disappointed,  just wish they put more on the plate. The pizza dip was pretty good as well,  but definitely calls for more bread chips. For the main course, I decided to get the Mahi Mahi Fish Tacos this time. Not the same as San Diego fish Tacos, but was soooooooo good! The taco wrap they used was almost like a super thing,  crispy pita bread and it gave it an interesting extra crunch.  And last but not least,  PIZOOKIES. My cousins got chocolate chip and peanut butter cookie split,  and my other cousin and I went for oreo and white chocolate macademia split (with vanilla ice cream on top of both of course). The portion is definitely more than enough for two people if you have the room for it that is!!!  If you've decided you don't like the food,  at least go back for the heavenly pizookies. Or hit up their beautiful bar and have some drinks :)"
Ashley C.,"Saint Johns, FL",0,38,20,4.0,2/23/2016,"BJ's is always good for their stout 'Tatonka'.  Absolutely love it.  Food is also amazing - everything we've ever had here has been good.  The southern style fried Chicken is our favorite, and we split it since it's so rich.   Great stop while at Town Center."
Vy T.,"Jacksonville, FL",10,65,66,1.0,12/11/2016,"Don't even bother with this place. The service is super slow and we always go late at night when the restaurant is barely half full. The prices are way too high for the service and quality of food you get. Our waiter was nice and all, but just too slow to get our orders and the food took forever to come out. The California Club flatbread ($11) had very minimal toppings and like 3 pieces of avocado. Very thin and not worth the price. The pizookie was the only good thing about this place. Probably will only be returning for the pizookie."
A D.,"Winston-Salem, NC",0,13,9,4.0,9/11/2016,"I went here for happy hour... I was disappointed in the prices of the drinks... Only $1 off of mixed drinks. So I paid $8 (which is typical) for a mixed drink that was good.. BUT it only had a splash of ""spirit"" which sucked after a hard day at work.  The only real deal was on beer.  However, my waiter was extremely nice... And most of the appetizers were half off. The mini pizzas were sooooo good and only like $5 with the happy hour special! I got the buffalo chicken pizza and killed the entire thing!"
Ashlyn M.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,4,,2.0,10/14/2017,"I normally really enjoy this place (the restaurant as a whole), but this location was such a disappointment. We had a 20 minute wait at 8:40 pm when almost half of the restaurants tables were empty. We weren't sure if they had started cutting people early, but there were still 4 hostesses standing around. After our waiter finally arrived at our table to get our drink order, he sat down and began complaining about his day and the day before. We got our appetizer at the same time we got our drinks... 10 minutes for 2 waters?? Our food took forever to come out and neither of us ordered speciality items. Our waiter blamed it on the kitchen, and meanwhile another table was talking to the manager about the same issues we were having. Every stall in the women's restroom was out of toilet paper! As we were leaving, we noticed handwritten signs on the door saying the restaurant was experiencing power outages..... we sure didn't experience any during the hour and 45 minutes that the two of us were there."
David O.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,6,,1.0,7/25/2016,"First, YELP needs to consolidate some of these BJs brewhouse reviews.  The i95 and the Gate Parkway I think are the same restaurant. I was stunned to go in to take advantage of the very frequently advertised 1/2 off large pizza day (Mondays) and be served the driest deep dish pizza ever made.  I would rate this up there with a Dominos Meat pizza with absolutely no sauce whatsoever, and at a premium cost.  Unfortunately I brought this to friends and now I feel so bad, I'm thinking about buying them a pizza from another restaurant to make up for our horrible meal. Unfortunately, I'm not close enough for the restaurant to offer me another shot at a pizza, but George the manager promised to take a better look at quality control. Odd thing is:  I've been to BJs in Tallahassee and brought pizza back from there to Jacksonville on more than one occasion and its always been delicious.  Bad timing, bad night, bad cook I guess.  Check your food out before leaving!"
J T.,"St. Petersburg, FL",0,25,2,2.0,4/4/2016,"Service was pretty bad. Sat at the bar and got a drink while waiting for to-go, bartender was less than attentive, though there were a lot of regulars she talked to. My to-go lacked silverware and anything resembling food"
Jack L.,"Greenville, SC",22,535,342,3.0,10/21/2015,"I was in town on business on two separate occasions, and since my hotel offered a shuttle, I chose to come here because I like craft beers and this was the only game in town. I came here on two consecutive nights one week and had a good experience. I came one night the following week and it was horrible.  The first two nights were great. Me and a co-worker came and sat at the high tops in the bar area and were taken care of. The first night, the draft beers were a little warm, but we were told it was because there was warm beer in the taps due to us being the first patrons of the night. They took the warm beers back and brought us cold ones, so all was well. The service was great. I chose salad both nights and they are the largest salads I have ever seen. I love large portions and always eat everything, but the ration of lettuce to toppings was way off: way too much lettuce and not much toppings.  My third visit was horrible. We made a reservation for 10 people at 6:30. We show up at 6:20 or so to try to get seated and order some drinks. Well, I guess they are fans of Seinfeld, because they ""know how to take the reservation, but they don't know how to hold the reservation. And let's face it, the holding of the reservation is the most important part."" So we had to wait an additional 20 minutes to get the table.  After being seated 10 minutes late, we wait another 10 minutes for a server, and then another 15 minutes for the drinks to arrive. All told, we received our drinks about 35 minutes after we were supposed to be seated. The service was okay after that, a bit spotty, but I could tell the girl was working hard.  The food was okay, seemed to be a little greasy. I would recommend this place for one or two people sitting in the bar area, but I would NOT come back here to sit at a booth or with a group of people."
BJ L.,"Alpharetta, GA",3,44,10,4.0,1/28/2017,We were looking for a sports bar to watch the Senior Bowl and chose BJ's. I had the barbecue bison burger and it was delicious. The Lightswitch brew was great. I had to ask the bartender 3 times in a 25 minute timeframe to get the Senior Bowl on the TV was the only negative we experienced.
J W.,"Chicago, IL",0,9,,2.0,5/10/2017,"I went to a Bj's in Texas once and enjoyed it so when someone suggested Bj's for their birthday dinner I was game. After this experience I will never be back. Since we were a large group and did not want to wait long for a table we opted to eat outside. The ground had food all over the place. I get we were outside but I still expect the place to be clean. The waiter came by a few times but not very often. The wait for the food was painfully long. When the food did come, mine was made wrong. They made me a new salad but the second time the chicken looked pink and undercooked. I would have sent it back but I was starving and did not want to wait for another salad to be made so I just did not eat the chicken. Another dish at the table came out with a hair on it. It was sent back and the second time it came out it also had a hair on it. Very disappointing."
Grace G.,"Jacksonville, FL",4,33,5,5.0,12/15/2016,"Came here with my boyfriend the night before Thanksgiving. It was slow, but the service was nothing less than excellent. We couldn't decide on anything together, so we were able to get personal-sized pizzas and cookies. Not to mention the food was delicious and the happy hour was on point. I will definitely come back here!"
Samantha K.,"Jacksonville, FL",68,145,118,4.0,9/12/2015,"If you're looking for a casual atmosphere with an extensive menu in terms of both drinks and foods then BJs is a solid choice. Prices for the most part are pretty reasonable.  I've been here a few times now, but my review is based on my recent visit. I came here for lunch while I had an hour break from class. When I walked in, I was skipped over twice by the hostess to be sat (I was by myself....maybe that's why? No excuse regardless). I let it go because whatever, doesn't ruin my experience, BUT I only had about 45 minutes and it was a little annoying.  Anyway, Adela was my server and she was great--friendly and totally accommodating to the fact that I was short of time. I ordered the stuffed mushrooms and mozzarella and tomato salad. Both were really good. And, in total it was a really filling lunch for $10. BJs has earned a spot in my rotation whenever I'm looking for a bite to eat at the town center."
S H.,"Flagler Beach, FL",1,47,4,1.0,7/2/2016,Went here for lunch with 4 co workers during the week.  We started off ok getting seated but it went downhill from there. I ordered a potato and soup lunch combo. The server came back and said they were out of potato's? Really?  So I ordered a salad. He asked if I wanted the rest of the tables orders to go in or wait. I said they could put their orders in thinking a salad should not take that much longer.  My co-workers got their food and the fries were cold. One of them got the lettuce wrap but it was mainly vegetables and not much chicken. 20 minutes later the server said the salad would be a couple more minutes because they made the first one wrong. There was no offer for a complimentary appetizer or desert or anything... Just his response that mistakes happen.  Finally got my food but once took about 2 hours.
BO T.,"FL, FL",0,4,,1.0,6/30/2017,"Went today during lunch.  We were showed to our booth and waited 20 minutes for someone to at the very least come to greet us.  After that time, no server, no drinks, we got up and left.  Don't go.  Went to PF Changs and instantly we had a table, menus, drinks and a yummy yet cheaper meal."
Brady M.,"Orlando, FL",2,42,94,2.0,2/29/2016,Overall this BJ's Brewhouse is a decent place to eat at. We waited to be seated for a while even though we had 20+ people and 2 other groups waiting. Once we were seated we got to meet the not so friendly waiter. He seemed very annoyed by us. Once the food came out 4 of us didn't get our food. Soon we found out they had forgotten about us and we had to wait another 20 minutes. Once the food came it wasn't that great. Not terrible but not great.  I really don't recommend this place when in the Jacksonville area.
Erin E.,"Middleburg, FL",3,30,31,5.0,7/11/2016,Ate here this past Friday night and loved it.. our waiter was so attentive and the food was fresh! I tried the beer tester (you get to choose 4) & garlic parm boneless wings = Yum Yum
