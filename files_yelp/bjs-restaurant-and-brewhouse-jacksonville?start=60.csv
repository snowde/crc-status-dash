Chelsea C.,"Jacksonville, FL",55,176,72,3.0,10/24/2016,"I've been here twice: once for dinner and once just to sit at the bar for drinks. It is a good place to go and watch a sports game. Their menu has a huge selection of food and drink items, offering a little bit of something for everybody. My only complaint is the service of the bartenders. The bar was full, but not busy, if that makes sense. At the time I arrived, everybody else had a drink/food and was in the middle of having a private conversation. The bartenders acknowledged I was there pretty quickly, but then it took them a very long time to come back for my drink order. Once the other person in my party arrived, we had the same issue. We attempted to order a food item, and it took almost 30 minutes for us to receive it. On top of that, I had to ""flag"" the bartender down to get the order in. We were sitting at the actual bar... I was far from impressed with the service. But, I am not writing this place off as a spot to go watch football."
Steve S.,"St. Augustine, FL",1,8,1,1.0,6/26/2017,"Went there last night. Slow service, poor food and freezing dining room temperatures make for a bad dinner combination. Last night was our third time there. First 2 were good. Hopefully this was a fluke."
Jeff W.,"Jacksonville, FL",63,144,369,3.0,7/27/2015,Used to be one of my favorite places to eat.  Still like some stuff.  Happy hour is alright. Half price appetizers. Chicken bacon ranch Taverns cut Pizza is good got to have it cooked twice for me I like it extra crispy.  Still miss the hand tossed pizzas though.  3 stars from me.
Sharon C.,"St. Augustine, FL",2,85,71,5.0,8/28/2015,"Wow! Wow! Wow!  I had the best burger I've had in a very long time.  I ordered the brewhouse burger with brisket and bacon and cheddar cheese on top. OMG! That thing was so freaking awesome.  I ordered it medium, it came out medium. Hard to find that in most restaurants. The meat was juicy and the brioche roll was perfect role for this burger.  I am not a sweet barbecue sauce person so I had that put on the side. I added mayonnaise and mustard to it which I'm sure folks would be cringing at. But that's the way I like it!  I cannot wait to go back and have that burger again! The only downside was the pomegranate margarita. It was too sour. However they graciously replaced the drink without question. My friend thought that she could drink hers but could not so they took hers off the check."
Kassie C.,"Jacksonville, FL",200,100,414,3.0,7/22/2015,"I've been to BJ's brewery a handfull of times & ive just never been super impressed. Today's experience was pretty good. Stopped by for a quick bite during my lunch hour. I ordered the berry burst cider which is delicious especially for only $3.50. For my meal, I ordered the mini stuffed crust pizza with one topping & it came with either a soup or salad. I chose the caesar. The salad was good, however I wasn't impressed with the pizza. It basically had no sauce on it and chunky tomatoes which I'm not a fan of. For an $8 meal I guess you can't expect top of the line. The service was good. I was greeted right away & given a drink right away. I asked where exactly the lunch menu was because the menu was quite extensive & he didn't have a clue. He went to the back for a hot minute & I was worried my food wasn't going to get put in with enough time before I had to head back to work but it turned out ok. He checked on me a couple times & asked if I wanted a refill on my beverage.  Overall in my opinion, BJ's is a good place to go to for a few drinks. If you're looking for a meal that stands out to you I would probably try somewhere else."
Diane M.,"Hot Springs National Park, AR",0,13,,4.0,6/16/2017,We had dinner there last night.  We ate at the bar.  The staff was attentive and the food was very good.  The only complaint we have is that the menus were very sticky.  They need to wipe them down daily.   We hoped that wasn't an indication of the cleanliness of the kitchen.  But the food was very good.
John S.,"Jacksonville, FL",275,679,517,3.0,1/5/2015,"We ventured here for an after party and although I really enjoyed my food the experience as a whole wasn't very good. It took a long time for them to find a table for our large party and when we were finally seated, we only had one server...  I must admit that she did a good job up until the end of our meal (she was nowhere to be found when some of our group wanted dessert).  My wife's hamburger wasn't very good, which was surprising because we'd heard good things about their burgers.. We will give it another try in the future."
Tee N.,"Jacksonville, FL",32,61,363,4.0,1/13/2015,"BJ, let's talk Like, you're great. You're always on time, has amazing half-off appetizers during happy hour and never tell me my butt is big. Your house is always  clean and your bathrooms are huge. Like, big enough where I can fit after my many amazing meals. The only request is, please, refrain from having your manager(s) publicly yell at your staff in front of customers. I feel uncomfortable because then they get super sad. They're people too and they work for money just like you and I. Please, don't scold your staff. Other than that, I like you. You're cute."
Kim M.,"Jacksonville, FL",159,180,394,5.0,2/2/2016,"I've been here a few times, particularly when they had recently opened of which at that time, was not too impressed more hype than substance. However, thanks to more recent promotions, we decided to revisit and I'm glad we did. I'm impressed with their quick attentive service from the host to the server. Although the menu is quite extensive, it doesn't lack quality. One thing for me is a good burger, thick juicy yet well done and grilled on an open flame. BJs does not disappoint.  Large selection and variety of toppings served with delicious fries.  As for the home brews, I can't review since I don't drink beer but I can say that the selection of fresh brewed sodas is delicious. Especially the orange cream, it's delicious. Although there's a slight upcharge for the specialty brews, they are still refillable. The place has ample seating for both large groups and an intimate night as well as an outdoor patio with full service. The management is in tune with the service and your experience which may be why I was very pleased and will continue enjoying this spot! Sign up for the club for discounts and upcoming new menus."
Allie A.,"Jacksonville, FL",985,506,5568,3.0,11/14/2014,"I guess it should tell me something (and maybe you too) that I've been to this location, and a few other BJ's locations in the past, but can't for the life of me remember what I ordered, or even if it was any good.  But that wouldn't be much of a review, eh? This most recent trip I had a few selections, and DO remember them, so here it goes.  First of all, my the bottom of my beer lovin' gut, this place get a star just because they make their own beer. I tried a light ale last visit, and it didn't knock my socks off, but it was drinkable, light and refreshing. We were there for a little after party get together, and I missed some of the action on trying to get a table large enough for us, probably about 10-12 folks? but by the time I did get there, everything had been settled, and the service was pretty good throughout this visit.  We just wanted a few light bites to share, so we ordered the avocado egg rolls and the shrimp lettuce wraps.  I was super excited about the egg rolls... (anything avocado immediately gets my attention. When they arrived, I dived right in... the avocado was a little brown... but I figured since it was deep fried, that would probably happen) and I guess I should have read the description a bit more thoroughly. The chipotle in the roll just made it... so wrong. It was a slimy, peppery yucky mess, and don't even get me started on that sauce. Just no. Not a fan.... one and done.  The shrimp lettuce wraps, on the other hand, were pretty good! The shrimp had a nice spice to them, the wraps were fresh and crisp, and toppings were on point. There were four, and plated beautifully, and I didn't really want to share (but I did.)  I'm sure I will venture back at some point, when a picky eater relative makes the restaurant call, so maybe I'll find something else I like."
Suzi R.,"Baton Rouge, LA",194,108,324,4.0,11/7/2015,"Pleasantly surprised! I tried all the meals on the table - spaghetti and meatballs - homemade meatballs were juicy and had just the right amount of spice. Beef Au jus sandwich - one of the best I've had. Great flavor and texture nom nom nom. I had the ahi tuna salad. I've had this same meal at many places, it's one of my favorites and bjs didn't disappoint. Great flavor of the fish, perfectly seasoned with a tasty rice vinegarette. My husband had the guacamole burger. Good guacamole and there was a ton of it. He said the burger could have been more moist but I tasted it and have no complaints. All and all solid choices all around on this large menu. I shall return for happy hour!"
Lisa D.,"Jacksonville, FL",189,498,1051,2.0,2/13/2016,"Based on previous experience I was quick to recommend BJ's for a great happy hour for girls day out. However our most recent experience was much less than impressive so had to knock off a couple of stars, mostly because of service issues. We arrived a little before 4 pm and though there were already several people in the bar area, but we did not see a server for a while. When we did see a few different servers walk by, they completely ignored us. Finally someone did come to take our drink orders. Happy hour for $1 off the beers is not the greatest happy hour special in town, but getting 1/2 price appetizers is a great deal. We went for the avocado egg rolls and the potato skins. Both came out hot and were pretty good so this was still the best part of our experience. When it came time to get the bill, we waited and waited and again could see no servers, not ours, not anyone. We had a time schedule so it was rather frustrating being left alone to take care of the bill. I was going to ask the bartender or the hostess but they were not nearby either. So because service was lacking, we will not be in a hurry to recommend or return to BJs again."
Jy J.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,11,1,5.0,9/25/2016,"Experienced the new addition to St Johns Town Center, BJ's Brewhouse. Enjoyed the Bacon Cheeseburger w/ fries. Great craft beers, friendly environment enjoying the Saturday games with many menu selections. Check it out!"
Madison O.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,1,,2.0,10/16/2016,"We ordered food from here on the mobile app and were severely disappointed when we went to pick up the food. The fries were like salted sticks had a love child with pretzels. The portions were also miserable and the pictures of the food were misleading. While our order was messed up 4 times, the staff were still kind and helpful."
Brian O.,"Pompano Beach, FL",26,58,27,2.0,10/11/2016,"So with all the options that are available in the area, I decided on BJ's. I sat at the bar so I could watch the Nats game. It was a Tuesday night so not crowded at all. Bartender came very quickly to serve me. My drink was their brown ale, nice flavor, good maltiness with a hint of hop. For dinner I ordered the sirloin with wedge salad and loaded potato. The wedge salad cam first, decent size. The salad had a good amount of blue cheese, bacon a little under cooked. I thought it was missing something but ok salad. Then the main course. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT! I had to do a triple take. The steak was the size of a small child's fist. I asked the bartender is this it. He said yeah the ribeye is a little bigger. How about letting me know. I am not a small guy. I probably could eat in four bites. The menu also said some ing about tender sirloin, I have had beef jerk more tender. This is what I get for ordering a steak here. They did not get a lower rating because this is one experience. I have other things that are good, just don't order the ""tender sirloin"""
Jordan S.,"Saint Paul, MN",0,41,8,1.0,4/7/2016,"We first arrived at the restaurant with 5 people looking to sit outside at 7pm on a Thursday night.  The hostess said it would take 10 minutes to seat us outside. We looked at the patio area and 80% of the tables were empty.   The server didn't know what to do or improvise as we had 5 people and there were only 4 person tables.  He was so flustered that he couldn't think of combining two tables or pulling up an extra chair to the table. We actually had to wait 15 minutes before a server had their ""light bulb"" come on.  We went outside and waited 10 more minutes before our waitress arrived.  When she did arrive we had to wait for additional 10-15 before our beer came!!!! We ordered another drink and one of our friends wasn't served because the server said someone else took his beer.  So he had to wait another 5-7 minutes. Good food but slow and horrible service. Needless to say, go somewhere else as there are many other great food places in the area."
Brad H.,"Kirkland, WA",234,971,114,5.0,1/11/2015,"BJ's Jacksonville has an exceptional happy hour. For just under $10 dollars you can get a drink (with spirits), fries and hamburger sliders with tax. That is truly a value you can not beat- but the fact that the quality of these items is top notch makes it even better. Mix it in with outstanding personable service (Even for a large party) and it clearly earns a 5 star Yelp rating. Thanks BJ's for an outstanding meal, quality service and fair prices."
Ana M.,"Jacksonville, FL",55,16,154,1.0,6/6/2016,No happy hour specials even though their website and phone system indicated they do have happy hours on Sunday's. I went because it was on their website and when I called there direct line it also confirmed the happy hour. I arrive and speak to the bartender and they say they do not have any specials on Sunday. They should take the information down if they do not wish to honor it. To me it's false advertisement.
Ron G.,"Lemon Grove, CA",0,30,6,2.0,2/17/2017,Great location and nice area but questionable dining service. I visited this Gate Parkway location for the first time on Thursday 2/16/2017 around 8pm. The atmosphere was cool with a louder sports bar volume level. Unfortunately our server in the dining area was quite rushed. And not just her but her coworkers too. Not sure if they were shorthanded on that particular night or understaffed on a nightly basis. The kicker was she forgot to bring my beer!  I had to ask for it 5 minutes after I started eating.  She was apologetic but not sure if I will return any time soon.
Drew V.,"Englewood, FL",0,25,2,1.0,8/19/2015,"My family and I went to BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse to try their food. The atmosphere is nice and the service staff were good. My dad and I split a deep dish pepperoni pizza topped with crushed tomatoes and my mom tried the top sirloin with sides of New England clam chowder and salad.  The clam chowder was okay (not bad, not great).  It was on the creamy side. I was very surprised at the size of the top sirloin (not in a good way).  It was rather small and I was expecting a larger cut.  Since my mom got the clam chowder and salad, when the steak was served it was alone on the plate.  The plate was large and accentuated the small size of the steak (poor choice on their part perhaps).  The taste of the steak was, again, okay.  Not great, not terrible.  It was properly cooked to order which is very nice.  Way too small though. The low point of the evening was the pizza.  Yuck!  However they cooked the deep dish pizza was a let down.  The crust was way too moist and soggy.  The crust did not taste like quality baked bread; almost had a chemical taste.  The sauce and cheese were very lackluster.  The pepperoni had almost no flavor which was a shame.  The diced tomatoes on top were okay.  No joke, I have had better flavor from a frozen costco kirkland pepperoni pizza, which is very very sad. If the flavor of the food matched the ambiance this would be a nice place.  Sadly, I was dissapointed with the portion size and flavor overall."
