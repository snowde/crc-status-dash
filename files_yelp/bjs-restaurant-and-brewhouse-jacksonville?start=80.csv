Chris N.,"Southeast Jacksonville, FL",0,4,,1.0,5/12/2016,@bjsrestaurants enjoying the disgusting customer service at BJ's. 2 years after having glass in my food Here I regret coming back. Waitress knew nothing about the beer menu. It took almost 15 minutes to get ketchup for the burger that took almost 45 minutes to make for some reason. I will never return here and will continue to tell everyone how awful this establishment is.
Mary T.,"Jacksonville, FL",14,32,215,3.0,9/30/2014,"So, this isn't my first time here, but it's my first time coming here since I've become an active yelper.  Lovely atmosphere. A bit dark though, with one small pendant spot light in the middle of the table.  Made our orders food came out 40 minutes later...  Everything was delicious. My shrimp scampi was a bit bland, but I was satisfied. We finished the waitress came and took our plates and we waited another 30 minutes for the check and the complementary icescream dessert.  For a Tuesday night it wasn't busy, but it wasn't a slow night for them either.  I liked being there but service wasn't pleasing. I'd give them another chance though."
David A.,"Miami, FL",36,19,16,3.0,5/11/2016,"It's exactly what you would expect it to be. Good food and great for hanging to watch some games. Although the food is pretty good, most people come for the beers, which are amazing."
Shana B.,"Jacksonville, FL",96,89,93,2.0,7/15/2016,"I know it's Friday night but our food is taking forever! Also, it's just mediocre at best. And that's not just based on this time being here alone. It's too dark to see the menus to order which was bothersome. Music is so loud spoke are yelling over each other. Just unpleasant all around."
Elizabeth M.,"Jacksonville, FL",228,411,1678,4.0,11/24/2014,"I'v lived near Tinseltown for so long and yet have managed to never come here before, until now.  Went in kinda of late near 11. We were promptly seated and our drink order was taken quick. We knew we wanted an appetizer so we went ahead and ordered the green chili fries with carnitas. They were pretty good. At first I felt that they were lacking cheese but then my husband pointed out that all the cheese was melted and browned at the bottom making a crispy cheese layer that needed to be scraped to be eaten. If this doesn't sound appetizing to you then skip this app but my husband and I like crispy cheese so we enjoyed it. We then ordered out entrees and I got the ribeye with white cheddar mashed potatoes and the tomatoe bisque soup. The soup was very tasty and creamy. When it was brought out I was asked if it was hot enough. I seriously said to the guy ""meh, it's okay"" but before I could even finish my sentence with ""it could use more"" the guy was dashing off. I let it go because my husband was fine with it but when I think of soup I think of something hot and steamy! Which this soup was not.  The ribeye at first glanced looked like this preachers piece of meat that did not look appetizing at all when brought out. The picture I took doesn't even do it justice with how ugly it was but I figured, oh well. Then I cut into the steak and it was well done! Heck no because I had ordered medium. The weird thing was that half was medium and the thinner half was well done. One of the servers did promptly come back and ask how everything was and I mentioned the weird steak and how it was cooked and she was about to grab the whole plate when I said that I would prefer she just bring me a small steak to replace the piece that was overcooked because by this point i was so hungry and my husband would have been eating alone. I also knew it would take time to get a whole new plate and by that time, then I would have been eating alone.  They did do as I asked and the steak that I ate was pretty tasty. Maybe a bit heavy handed on the salt and seasoning but it was very flavorful. The mashed potatoes were very smooth and actually tasted like white cheddar. My husbands burger looked very appetizing and he said it tasted delicious. He also got the fried replaced with broccoli which was perfectly cooked. By the time we were almost finished eating, my new steak with mashed potatoes and all arrived. It was much more than I expected because it was a whole brand new plate! I have to say well done to BJ's because they could have just brought out what I expected of a piece of steak but instead they exceeded my expectations. On to the salted caramel pizzookie! Can we say delicious heaven of a dessert! Salty and sweet and it had to scoops of ice cream! It was demolished! It was also perfectly cooked and not too crispy. Our server was very attentive along with the food runners except for the soup guy. Even with all the hiccups I gave this place a 4 stars because they made it right and me and the husband left very happy at the end of the night."
Toni B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,19,,4.0,2/14/2016,"I really like the taste of the food here. Service is also very quick. I couldn't give it 5 stars because not perfect (what place is?) but it's like right there! Lots of TVs--kind of distracting to me but I can see how it offers people options.  Lunch special was delicious, half sandwich with side (I got steak fries) and a tomato salad. The salad seems super fancy: it's tasty but kind of small. I knew I had to get the steak fries to satisfy me.  My husband got this crazy jalapeño burger something. Really, really good. Thing was huge. He got the shoe string fries. It might just be me, but they are more crunch than potatoes.  I would definitely go back and recommend this place to people. I saw workers there eating for lunch. Great food, decent prices, lots and lots of options."
Keith H.,"Tallahassee, FL",157,18,1,2.0,6/6/2015,"Went here last night for some beer(what else would you do at a Brewhouse?!) and grub. We talked to the hostess and were told that it was happy hour. We sat ourselves in the bar area and ordered the appetizer combo and a round of beers. The beers came quickly enough but we waited 30-45 minutes for the fried appetizer. We made it through a few rounds of beer before running out of chips and simultaneously learning that it was not happy hour--this turned things into sad hour. We asked for more chips thinking they would come right out but then we didn't see our server again for 15 minutes at which time we were told the chips were being made from scratch(you know, grind the corn, process it into chip shape, and fry). Eventually a basket of greasy chips was delivered.  This restaurant is just another chain along the same lines as Applebee's and Chili's the difference being the higher prices for the same food. Sure, the food is presented better and the restaurant has an overall ""nicer"" feel, but don't let that fool you.  BJ's is a basic restaurant for basic people."
James P.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,3,,2.0,1/25/2017,"Over the past several years, I have enjoyed lunch at BJ's Brewhouse more times than I can count.  Lunch today was different.  Over the past year or so, I have noticed a decline in attention to detail by management and the kitchen staff.  Only one of the four meals our party ordered was as expected.  They were poorly or incorrectly prepared (Tuna-Quinoa bowl consisted of a 1 1/2 square of salty, over cooked fish on a 1/2 cup bed of quinoa...all for the amazing lunch price of $12.25).  Management did offer to ""bring out more Tuna,"" but totally missed the point that the portion size had been significantly reduced, without a corresponding reduction in the price.  Time to find another lunch place."
Brad H.,"Brunswick, GA",0,73,3,2.0,6/18/2016,Came in really hungry and ordered the queso and chips thinking it would be something to snack on while we waited for our lunch.  20 minutes later lunch showed up but no queso. I've had better service than what we had today. This place wasn't even busy.  The manager should do a better job of getting the servers to take care of the customer.  Thumbs down in today's visit.
Ruthie C.,"Jacksonville, FL",218,65,72,4.0,7/20/2015,"Whether you are dining for dinner or day drinking with the girls, this is the place to go! Happy hour at the bar has become a new tradition. Drinks are always on special for each of your taste bud wishes: wines, liquids, house made beer, you name it-you can get it. It's a really relaxed environment that keeps you from thinking about the stressful world outside of the doors."
Diane S.,"Fleming Island, FL",0,1,,1.0,6/25/2016,First visit and not impressed.  Slow service. Calamari was like chewing a rubber band.  Pizza was soggy. Won't be coming back. Waitress was very helpful and nice.
Steven P.,"St. Augustine, FL",69,5,,3.0,6/11/2016,"Server was super awkward. While he was a bartender, he didn't know what prosecco was..... No knowledge of the menu at all. Decent food though. One step above Applebees."
Jacob C.,"Nashville, TN",18,119,78,5.0,9/1/2015,Happy hour every weekday is tough to beat. They have great beer and if craft beer isn't your thing they have many other options. The flatbread apps are great and they are half off during happy hour.
Morgan H.,"Jacksonville, FL",51,337,830,4.0,3/24/2015,"I've only been here twice but both times I had good service and I enjoyed both the drinks and the food.  I'd like to come back and try more of the menu. It's rather extensive which can either be great or bad depending on whether or not they do everything well.  That being said, I have no complaints so far."
Susan S.,"Jacksonville, FL",231,221,889,4.0,6/2/2014,"So my friends and i made it here just in time for a few happy hour specials, and that was awesome cause it wasnt advertised anywhere on their website i dont think..we sat at the bar and had a few drinks and appetizers, that were all nothing short of amazing..we then asked to get a table, and then changed it to a table outside.  The hostess was very patient with us.  Our server came right out and was pleasant, knowledgeable about the menu, and quick on her feet.  i had a bison burger that was really good, two friends had steak and one had salmon..ill add pics later because everything looked and tasted so good! the outdoor area is nice and clean, and also has a wind guard glass that i think adds a nice touch when youre trying to eat..overall a really great time!"
Trever P.,"Jacksonville, FL",9,54,55,4.0,8/29/2015,I just got the lemon thyme chicken and I will say the food is yummy just took a long to get the. People working to night are. But if u want some good food check this place. Just note it's kinda slow.. But the waiter I just had was super nice and really good at her job.
Chuck L.,"Jacksonville, FL",60,75,80,1.0,1/14/2016,"Took the family Saturday night as our night out and decided to go to BJs Brewhouse... Not a good choice...unlike our 1st visit this one was not good...     1st our waitress seemed very distracted and not pleasant... Our refills were not in a timely fashion and had to ask repeatedly for them...  One of her friends came in to dine, and she spent more time at their table than with her customers....     2nd my daughter had to send her steak back as she ordered medium rare and it came out like shoe leather... We had finished eating when her food came back out... The waitress said her manager was going to come over and talk to us but they never did... She said for the mix up her meal would be comped but when the bill came was full price she said she forgot but then only took 1/2 off her entree....     Wife's cheeseburger came out without cheese and the mashed potatoes were cold... Overall not a pleasant dinner and won't be back for a while ..."
Tom B.,"Jacksonville Beach, FL",322,346,26,3.0,1/13/2015,"BJ's is alright. It's a big noisy chain restaurant outside of Town Center near Costco. The food is pretty good. I kind of think of it as a poor man's Cheesecake Factory. It weighs in around the same number of calories per dish and amount of sodium you'll take in eating most things on the menu (off the charts hombre.) If you are planning on drinking, you'll want to know the beer is expensive (and you probably will need something to wash down your salty appetizers.) One of the cheapest things you can find is a Dos Equis for $5.25 a pint, and the prices go up from there for equally mediocre brews. They brew their own beer here, but they aren't particularly appetizing. Entrees are all over the place. The pasta is ok and the burgers are not bad. The pizza is alright. I had a ribeye last time that was actually pretty good. It was probably overseasoned, but it was cooked to temperature perfectly and was a decent deal at $20 with two sides. Overall, I can't say I really like this place but it's not bad. The menu is big, so they will have something for everyone. Having said that, I don't think the quality is in line with the price point. If you do make it here, I would recommend the steak over anything else I've had."
Alex V.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,13,8,1.0,12/10/2016,"Called ahead to make sure they were still serving food, they guy said they serve food till 1am full menu. We walk in at 12:20am and the bartender says it's last call and that she can get us something quick or to go. Walked right out. I'll go spend my money somewhere else where they give a shit about the customers. Ridiculous."
Carlos G.,"Evans, GA",8,5,1,5.0,3/26/2016,"The staff was very friendly. The enviornment is open and inviting. The food was great. Day one i had Baked Salmon. The next day I had ""jumbo"" sphagetti. I enjoyed both. My children had chicken tenders and ranch Piadina. The menu has many offerings to satisfy your family...Enjoy!!!!"
