Steve D.,"Katy, TX",13,92,51,3.0,12/7/2017,"The food at this location for B.J.'s is about the same as most of their restaurants in our area. What is lacking at this location is service. The timing of the meals brought out of the kitchen is terrible. Four people in our group today. Two meals came out 15 minutes before the other two meals. Two of us were almost done eating before two of us even started to eat. If they could get their service up to the level of the Sugarland location, they would really have s great place to dine."
Long N.,"Houston, TX",70,117,41,5.0,12/4/2017,"I guess these ratings depend on who is serving you.. I had a great experience at the bar tonight!.. Phil (Vietnamese brotha) was taking care of me tonight and he was great. I made the reverse happy hour (9-11pm).. half off individual deep dish pizzas and 5 dollar house cab. Not a bad deal at all. The food came out timely. The drink and service was more than decent. I got a BJ house deep dish (twice). Pepperoni and italian sausage were seasoned on point. The house cab was okay, but the bartender was very heavy handed and a nice guy. I will definitely be back!"
Mike T.,"Katy, TX",51,116,59,5.0,11/29/2017,"Allows license to carry! Decent food, good atmosphere and plenty of tvs to catch watch the Cowboys lose! Or to catch any game. Servers are hit and miss, just like any other place. Most of the time, I've been very happy with the service and maybe once out of 10, I'd say it was subpar."
Leif H.,"Katy, TX",46,58,48,4.0,12/29/2017,"The food was excellent. I really enjoyed the Parmesan Crusted Chicken. My kids enjoyed the spaghetti and pizza. And my wife enjoyed the soup and wedge salad. The service is ok, but nothing special."
Charles C.,"Dallas, TX",7,5,,1.0,11/2/2017,Service was slow. My waitress decided to go pick up a fellow waitress without telling managment. Then my car was broken into in the parking lot.  Avoid.
Jade J.,"Houston, TX",76,67,44,2.0,11/12/2017,"The Shirley Temples are good, but the steaks are not. I got the ribeye and I got the steak because I was out for a company lunch....not because I thought ordering a steak at a non-steak place was a good idea, but I decided to give it a chance. The ribeye, which was ordered med rare, came out overcooked and tasted burnt. Broccoli was under seasoned. The only slight saving grace was the mashed potatoes."
James Z.,"Houston, TX",11,24,24,1.0,11/11/2017,"Just had lunch here and I was extremely disappointed. Three of us ordered steaks and they all came out lukewarm. I could spend a ton of time explaining everything else that was wrong, but I've already wasted enough time on this place so I won't... *DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE*"
Brandy L.,"Houston, TX",1,9,10,2.0,10/29/2017,Slowest service ever! Food quality is the only thing saving this place.  Management needs to step it up or be replaced.
Stephanie M.,"Phoenix, AZ",12,2,,5.0,10/28/2017,We came in from out of town and asked for a table for 12 people. More added on and it ended up being 23 people on a busy sat night during a world series game. They were able to accommodate us even with our extra people. Staff was very competent and friendly. Awesome experience for my first time at BJs. Highly recommend! PS. Our server Jeffrey was awesome!! Handled our 2o+ top like a champ!
Chris C.,"Houston, TX",26,14,5,5.0,12/8/2017,BJ's is one of my go to favorite restaurants. I love the extremely broad menu and the amazing beer selection .  The staff is always pleasant and the food is always amazing. My favorite is the calamari appetizer and salmon entree. This location is highly recommended!  Enjoy!
Sharifa A.,"Katy, TX",148,2,1,5.0,11/3/2017,"Great food, fast service and bartenders kill it! We usually have Sabrina as our bartender. She's always extremely polite and attentive. Would definitely recommend this place. Plus they have great daily specials!"
Davion B.,"Cypress, TX",402,65,98,4.0,4/14/2017,"Always a good experience at any BJ's. This was no different....the food, atmosphere, and staff were great!"
Anne-Marie N.,"The Heights, Houston, TX",1,3,4,5.0,11/13/2017,"I went here during dinner time and sat at the bar because it was packed. The bartender, I think his name is Phillip, did a superb job getting my drinks made and getting my food out in a timely manner. Will definitely be coming back because of his excellent service. Would also recommend the chicken lettuce wrap and burgers from there! I could honestly eat the chicken lettuce wrap as an entree if I wasn't that hungry. It comes in a large serving size!"
Holly W.,"Waxahachie, TX",26,138,159,4.0,7/21/2016,Always love this place! My daughter and I shared two appetizers--the ahi poke and the pot stickers. Yummy!! We then shared the Mediterranean chicken pita tacos (my usual) as well as a salted caramel pazookie.  For drinks I had a glass of Sauvignon blanc and she had a Hendriks lemonade. Wow -- great dinner.
Max U.,"Katy, TX",8,31,1,5.0,11/13/2017,"I really like this place. I have been coming to this restaurant at least once a month since it opened (sometimes two to three times in a month). I do not understand why there are so many average reviews on Yelp. The servers are notably nice and the food is good. I recommend their pizzas, their burgers and oddly enough their jambalaya. All good. Beer selection is what I would expect from a Brewpub. I can watch a game here or I can have a nice dinner with my kids. Also, you need to have the Pizookie at least one time...by and Large the servers are outstanding; friendly and attentive. I also just recently found out that BJ's does a tremendous amount of support to a few charities and gives back to the community. That's a restaurant that we should all consider supporting..."
Lisa M.,"Houston, TX",0,59,,2.0,11/5/2017,"We were there late Sunday afternoon. We waited about 20 minutes to be seated although the place was 1/2 full. It took a while for my beer to arrive. I asked why. The young man said it was because they give priority to bar patrons. What? Get me my beer.  The wings arrived on the cold side. They were unappetizing and I smelled that strange, fake butter taste on them. The chicken dumplings arrived cold as well. Otherwise they were good. My chicken pita Mediterranean tacos were warm and tasty. They came with a super odd, rice and I don't know what side. It was not edible. The complimentary soup, because of the wait, well, that was cold too. The fish tacos were ok. I finished my beer and was never offered another one. We didn't bother with dessert and won't go back. Fast food, poor management, and cold food."
Raul G.,"Katy, TX",124,43,18,4.0,8/1/2017,"Always a good choice to come here. Chelsea our server is amazing! This place is always busy, but the service is fast. Best service you can get. Atmosphere is dim. Perfect for a date. We started off with some drinks. I ordered the sunset, and she had the apple cider. For an appetizer we ordered the boneless buffalo wings ( not enough sauce so make sure you say extra wet). For an entree I had the club sandwich which was pretty good. My girlfriend ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken which is ALWAYS amazing no matter how many times you order it. Just make sure to order more sauce on the side. Trust me you will thank me later. For dessert we had the trio pazookis(cookies n cream=her favorite, chocolate chip=my favorite, and salted caramel which was kinda gross lol). Overall it was a great experience with amazing service."
Paige W.,"Brookshire, TX",0,1,1,1.0,5/24/2017,"My boyfriend and I eat at bjs frequently and every time the food is good, and service is decent but not very good. Tonight we ordered takeout, and I had the Parmesan crusted chicken and it was good, however my boyfriend got a ribeye steak and there was a big piece of plastic that was stuck on it and cooked with it. He didn't notice it at first and was very confused why it tasted like plastic and then he pulled this big chuck of plastic off of his steak. Safe to say we won't be returning."
Frank L.,"Katy, TX",0,5,,3.0,3/22/2017,"Went on a weeknight during spring break. The place was at 80% capacity but we got our table reasonably soon. Our waiter was super attentive (wife also says he was way cute and had a lovely voice). Our food was very good though we spent a lot of time deciding what to get, as the menu offerings are many. Our only gripe is the prices. I think they're charging too much for the food. If it were portions like some Italian restaurants do, then it would make sense, but this is not the case. I had the beked ziti plate that looked big enough on the menu and I thought I wouldn't even finish the whole thing. When it came, I was surprised to see how small a plate it was. Good food, small sizes, big price. Bad combo, in my opinion."
Jeff W.,"Katy, TX",0,43,24,4.0,6/18/2017,Great place love coming here.  The flat bread pizza are awesome and the ribs are excellent.  But the beer is the star of the show I switch between be Jeremiah Red and the Piranha pale ale. The hamburgers are ok but nothing to write home about. Good service nice atmosphere and helpful friendly staff.
Minh Xuan N.,"Sugar Land, TX",18,20,61,3.0,6/23/2016,"First thing I always notice when my bf and I dine here....the floor. Why is it always slippery? Not good.  Their wings are really good here.  It's always super crispy and oil-less. We always get the same flavors every time because the seasonings are usually pretty consistent.  The dry rub sriracha is the best with just the right amount of heat, then the dry rub lemon pepper sesame.   The two main courses that we usually stick with are the lemon thyme chicken and the roasted chicken and spinach over quinoa because its not only on the healthier side, but also because of the flavors combine so well with each dish.   Their shoestring fries are pretty good, the honey sriracha brussel sprouts are good as well, but the chips and queso could use some improvement.  We asked for ground beef but received none and the chips were extremely greasy.  If you're indecisive about what to eat or where to go, their menu is pretty extensive, so it's good that they have alot of options."
Peter C.,"Katy, TX",30,74,61,2.0,1/29/2017,Nice atmosphere with extensive menu. Service was prompt but got order wrong. Swiss on sandwich when cheddar was ordered also missing garlic aioli spread. They offered to remake but heck now my wife would be eating after me? In addition my burger was burned on edges - I appreciate a little char but this was burned. Manager was apologetic but we will only return to use up the gift card _ maybe on drinks?
Margie B.,"Richmond, TX",5,31,10,4.0,7/14/2017,"Very, very disappointed. We have been here several times with some ups and a few downs. This was definetly a very big down. We took our two grandchildren with us before our granddaughter's art class. We were promptly seated and waited, waited and waited some more. Watching other people seated and someone taking their drink and food orders. After close to 15 minutes of no one coming to our table I finally walked over to the front of the restaurant to let them know we were not happy because we have been waiting and waiting with no one acknowledging us, Finally a waitress came over and took our orders. My food came out on the cool side it was barely warm, my husband got the pulled pork sandwich which was very fatty and tough. The kids meals were okay. We had promised them dessert after their meals but after the long wait there was not enough time. We were actually sorry we even went. Made for a very dissapointing meal and almost late getting Mia to her class. We have had good meals in the past but Wednesday's meals was a complete let down. P. S. Mike the General Manager of BJ's immediately sent me an email the minute he read my review. He apologized and said he was very upset that our guest experience at the restaurant was so bad, He said he would have a full staff meeting and make sure that the things we had experienced does not happen again. We should have been acknowledged and taken care of from the time we were seated, The food should be at the highest standards that customers are happy with the taste as well as the appropriate temperature. Mike went above and beyond and made us feel like we truly mattered. He took care of our bill from Wednesday. And he also send us a generous email gift card when we return, which I might add that we most certainly will and of course we order the pizzookie that we ended up missing out on in our last visit. I Thank Mike for putting things right and am looking forward on going back to BJ's Brewhouse & Restauant in Katy, Texas"
Adeel A.,"Sugar Land, TX",0,23,17,5.0,7/25/2017,Came here with wife and kids on a Friday evening. Was greeted and seated right away - was blasted to see the menu items. They have Duvell beer on the menu not sure I have seen that  anywhere. The waiter was great and kept us updated and carefully listened to our order. The food was awesome. I am not sure why they have two star.. but this restaurant is awesome and so is their service.
Conner B.,"Katy, TX",0,2,,4.0,7/29/2017,Good vegan lentil soup and I'm pretty sure the garlic knots are vegan just order them without parmesan
Daniel G.,"Katy, TX",152,1,2,1.0,11/5/2017,"Food is mediocre and service is terrible. Waiting forever for the appetizer, entree and check. Server rarely comes to check up on us and I absolutely despise the service I was given today."
Geoni M.,"Houston, TX",1,28,9,4.0,5/6/2017,"Honestly, I don't know why this place gets a bad rap sometimes... BJ's is one of my favorite places to eat. Their food and the atmosphere, as well as their service, are always great. Today I went to eat lunch there and the food came out quicker than I had expected. The Italian Market pizza was truly awesome tasting. And I love their fried calamari appetizer, it's the only appetizer I'll ever want because it's quite good. The Pizookies are great, I always try to make room for one whenever I can, but today I could not as I was too full from the food I ate. Oh yeah, and also their orange cream soda is quite tasty. Whenever the mood strikes, I will surely come by BJ's again soon."
Gammie L.,"Katy, TX",440,145,255,1.0,11/9/2016,"Whyyyyyyyyyy?! Don't even know why I bothered coming here for steak night. I mean it seems like a good deal $26.95 for literally a 3 course meal. 14oz prime rib, a starter salad, 2 sides, and a dessert.. thought it would be the best bang for your buck but TOTAL FAIL!! Prime Rib was extremely bland, steaks weren't cooked to correct temperature. It was either well done or extremely rare. We all asked for medium rare.. ugh. Salads were huge as a ""starter salad"" but that was arguably the best part of my meal. It was quite tasty since I like spinach anyways. I ordered the loaded baked potatoes which seemed like they've just microwaved it with 3 pieces of bacon. Barely any bacon, couldn't even see the cheese, and there weren't enough butter. Everything tastes better with butter, BJ! I also got a side of fries but that literally was the last thing to come out as all of my other friends has gotten everything they've ordered. By that time, I've loaded up with salads and steaks.. So I didn't even get to finish my fries. Anyways, horrible decision coming here and it was totally out of the way. Should of made a U-turn and went to Captain Toms! Bleh!"
Melissa J.,"Katy, TX",42,22,,2.0,10/8/2017,"I don't expect great service at this place but this was the worst experience we've ever had here. It's taken two hours in a half full restaurant to g eat our food, drinks, dessert and check.  Our food was lukewarm, the pizzokies were not even warm and we had to ask our server several times for food and drink."
Roxanna C.,"Katy, TX",0,6,3,3.0,6/28/2017,"Always a great place to dine out whenever you do not have many choices to pick. Great food and great service especially when there's an NFL game. I absolutely love the oreo pizookie and sometimes just stop by and just order that. However, it can get pretty busy if there is an occasion that night so expect to wait at least 20-30 minutes if that happens. Cheers~"
Rae H.,"Katy, TX",75,30,10,5.0,9/12/2016,"Clean, good atmosphere, huge menu with tons of options. We ordered the fried asparagus, stuffed mushrooms, chili, hickory brisket burger, the cobb salad and peanut butter cookie (no ice cream and we got that last one to go). All were phenominal. Fair prices. Sometimes I leave restaurants regretting what I paid for how satisfied I am, but that wasn't the case here. We actually went back for a working lunch the next day because I saw other things on the menu I was looking forward to trying.  Our waitress on our first visit was Allison. If they're smart, they'll keep her employed. Fantastic attitude, our drinks were never emptied and she obviously knew the menu. The waitress on our second visit, Chelsea, was just as nice and happy to see and serve us. I was surprised when I came to leave this review - in part because of what stellar service we received - to see so many negative comments about the service. That definitely wasn't our experience either time. I'm excited to bring my kids with us the next time. I know my son is going to be pumped about their deep dish pizza menu.  Frankly, a lot of the chain restaurants in Katy are only so-so and half of them are overpriced. BJ's is a nice addition to the area. We'll definitely be coming back here."
Dave H.,"Houston, TX",4,9,,4.0,10/5/2017,We love going to BJ's. They just do a great job with allot of choices both in good food and great brews!!
Connie S.,"Katy, TX",0,1,,2.0,9/23/2017,It took 45 minutes to get our food. My fish tacos were room temperature.  Waiter did not check back with the two of us. We needed drink refills and had to waive him down. There are too many other restaurants with better service and food in this area. We won't go back.
David G.,"Katy, TX",0,3,,1.0,1/14/2017,"My wife and I we went for a dinner, ""HORRIBLE SERVICE"" place was at 50% of its capacity.  We ordered an appetizer and after we finished our main dishes ""Just because I asked for it, server told us that our appetizer ""burned"" and they are working on new one. Sever never stop to ask if anything else was need it, I asked for a Tabasco Sauce and we never get the sauce.  We were lucky to ordered our ONLY one drink, cuz our server never show up until we finished our dishes. (((( HORRIBLE SERVICE, WE WILL NEVER GO BACK TO THIS PLACE.))) (((VERY DISAPPOINTED OF THIS BJ'S))) Our server ""Josh"" received a $0.00 tip, since he needs  to work to earn it, it does not appear magically. Sincerely, A VERY DISAPPOINTED CONSUMER."
Jason H.,"Richmond, TX",32,19,8,4.0,8/19/2016,"Great beer, red is my favorite and pizza is great. The service was really good . The atmosphere is really good, sports on all the tv's what could be wrong with that."
Mary Francsis W.,"Katy, TX",0,19,4,1.0,2/12/2017,"Had fish & chips. Fish was super greasy. Wedges were floppy & cold. Half my wedge fries ended up in the tarter sauce. Ugh! Server was okay, but he kept wanting to give me Diet Pepsi. Cheese sticks had no cheese inside. It was melted all over the napkin they used to try & drain them.  San Antonio is way better."
Lindy L.,"Katy, TX",39,32,29,4.0,4/29/2017,Came for lunch today. Cheese stick app was yummy with fresh Parmesan sprinkled on top. My husband and I both tried one of their own brand beers and loved both of them. He got the ribs and I got the steak. Both we seasoned well and the steak was cooked perfect. Our server was extremely nice and spaced out the food and drinks appropriately. The only downfall is the booth seating for 2. Most of the restaurant is filled with these so I would recommend asking for a table or going to the high top bar seating which we eventually did. The booths are rather small and the tables are very low compared to a regular table making it a bit uncomfortable to eat. Other than that we enjoyed ourselves and will be back!
Arturo Y.,"Leander, TX",20,124,338,4.0,11/16/2015,Not sure if this review is really helpful - the only items I seem to order is from the appetizer section and beer. This is my first time at this location - it is nice and new.  Not that easy to get to  if you are getting off I-10 westbound - entrance to the BJ's comes up quickly. We to BJ's around 11:30/Friday - the crowds just started to come in.  Our service was timely and courteous - we needed to have a quick meal and we got it. Lemon Peppered Wings was good - no complaints.
Jerry A.,"Houston, TX",999,265,318,4.0,1/22/2016,My team decided to have lunch together. I had a much better experience today. I ordered the Italian market flatbread. It's a thin crispy crust that has the right ratio of crust to toppings when you bite into it. And it's more filling than it looks. I posted a picture. I will definitely have it again.
Katrina K.,"Katy, TX",0,10,,1.0,4/14/2017,"We had eaten here a few times when it opened and enjoyed it very much. But the last time is last time we will go back.  The host DID NOT want to seat us and was very unhelpful or communicative.  My husband and I walked in and here's how it went. (Note: this was a weekday evening at about 8:30 PM) Host: ""Forty minutes."" (No hello, no welcome, nothing.) Me:  Excuse me?""  Host: ""Forty minutes."" Me: ""Are you saying there is a 40 minute wait to be seated? Host: ""Yes"" (My husband and I look around, confused at the nearly empty lobby and we see plenty of open tables.) Me: ""But there's not even anybody waiting?"" Host: ""There is a huge party in the back that you can't see."" We left insulted with the feeling that he just didn't like us and didn't want to seat us because that's all he said.  He was a young, thin African American man who was clearly upset about something and could've cared less when we left. We are local business owners and would never treat our customers this way or hire anyone that would.  Awful customer service!"
