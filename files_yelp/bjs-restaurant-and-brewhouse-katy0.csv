Robert D.,"Houston, TX",67,23,27,4.0,10/4/2014,I haven't gone here for years. I was hoping it would be as amazing as I remember and it was. My wife's pulled pork sandwich was super delish and my chicken bacon pizza was one of the tastiest pizzas I've had in a very long time! Bravo BJs
Mystri D.,"Houston, TX",0,54,3,2.0,5/18/2014,"This place definitely need a lot of work. Long wait, service lacks, food was overpriced for mediocre quality. Had to send a dish back because the presentation looked like someone ate off the plate. Oh and was bought out a different dessert than what was ordered. One word to express this experience: headache! I will probably give this place another shot in a few months hoping it ll be better."
John G.,"Katy, TX",0,1,,5.0,11/27/2015,"Had an absolutely amazing experience at bj's. beers are great, the server recommended fantastic selections. I never had to wait for service, it's almost like the server anticipated my needs. Jessica was very friendly And attentive. I would recommend bj's, but only if you ask for Jessica"
Eduardo L.,"Katy, TX",681,33,7,1.0,6/10/2014,"Today has been the worst experience at BJs. I previously rated  this restaurant. It all started with their website. My co-worker was trying to make online reservations for  a group for a party of 8. BJs online menu kept showing an error message so instead, she called  to reserve and drove to the restaurant. While she did that , I got on to my app and reserved just In case anything went wrong. I arrived later, checked in at the front and my coworker   was still waiting. My name was  called before hers while we waited. The managers and everyone else was still  confused about my co-worker's request so I asked if we can use my reservation instead. We were seated - my co-worker's drinks and food took forever to get theirs.. I was done eating by the time they got their food. My co-worker was frustrated with their service because she even had to ask for a manager to get refills and she looked like she minded. I asked for my check and she minded.. I didn't even get a thank you!  I'm done with this place. I'm taking our group lunches somewhere else."
Steven M.,"Katy, TX",2,1,,2.0,9/19/2015,"The two stars are for the server.  The server was quick, attentive and friendly (all the while being pregnant).  As for the food, it was quite simply terrible.  I ordered two kids meal and one adult entree; We had kids tenders, Mac & cheese, and Chicken Alfredo. The order came out quickly but cold and the presentation was sloppy.  The quality of food seemed cheaper than normal for a chain restaurant. The facility was dirty and extremely cold (a/c had to be 60 degrees). The bottom line is that the Katy BJ's is the worst location I've ever been to and I've been to a bunch across the U.S.; from Oklahoma to Sacramento."
Eli C.,"Houston, TX",3,6,,5.0,8/2/2014,"Great food and drinks.. Big selection of beer on tap and pizzas are hard to beat.  Of coarse, in Katy, anytime a new place opens it's hard to find a seat but once you do you won't be disappointed."
S N.,"London, United Kingdom",3,55,3,1.0,6/21/2014,"Went last night with my husband and two friends...drinks took a very long time and the order was wrong when they arrived. Food also took a very long time, and was cold when it showed up. Had been sitting out for a while. Would go back to try again but not at a peak time. Service was ok-ish but the staff couldn't cope with the volume of people there."
Annie S.,"Houston, TX",3,24,5,1.0,2/28/2015,"So far the service sucks more than I'd care to share.  It's horrible.  When I sit down I expect someone to greet our table and see if we'd like a drink.... maybe that's too much to ask by these waitstaff rejects but I thought being a nice looking food establishment,  they'd want their customers to be happy and content...... we waited so long I placed drink food and meal at same time as I didn't know when is see waitress again lol. The food itself was not great.  The undercooked my steak! !! The drinks were also hit and miss. Not interested in returning."
K S.,"Katy, TX",2,56,7,1.0,1/12/2015,"By far the worst bj's I've ever been to. The one by clear lake was one of my favorite restaurants, I hope they are still doing well. This location is an insult to all the decent bj's locations. Worst staff I've witnessed. Even walking through the front door to meet the poor excuses for hostesses let's you know from the beginning not to expect much. Disorganized and unprofessional seeps from the front podium. 3 times I've had the Unpleasure of  visiting, only once by my own choice. To witness servers and hostesses leaning and hanging out at the hostess stand is an absolute joke, especially when nothing is being accomplish because of the excuse that ""they are very busy"". Te food is fine, I've always liked their menu, but the servers don't know it or the drinks they pride themselves on. The food tasted fine, but the presentation of meals has gone to slop. There is a noticeable lack of control through the kitchen to the front of house and it's sad. I even called the manager at one point to discuss the problems we saw and had, not to demand or be angry, but to assist and point out what we as customers were seeing. Every  statement was given an answer to appease and was noticeably blown off. It was even more evident at our next visit. I even saw some of the same staffers that were involved in other pitiful businesses around Katy. Being a career server used to mean being good at your job, now it just stands for not being able to do anything else and going from one business you ruined to the next. I've given two stars because they still have good tasting food, and I love the beer and their pre printed gluten free menu, someone I dine with is a celiac and it helps. Unfortunately, the servers neither know where or what the gluten free menus are, they can't bring the RIGHT beer, and the food looks terrible. Pitiful excuse for what used to be a great chain. After reading this I've changed it to one star, they deserve nothing more."
Daina M.,"Pearland, TX",0,3,,1.0,2/27/2016,"worst dining experience,  1st i asked for a booth and they said there were none available, when we could see them. 2nd we had to ask twice for a high chair when we had a toddler.  3rd we sat there for 15 min and no one even came to greet  us,  we finally ask and the guys wad like I'm not your waiter but I'll help you in a couple and never came back. we just left this place was nice but 1st and lay time I ever visit"
Christina D.,"Katy, TX",61,61,95,1.0,2/12/2015,"Giving this place one star is generous. If I could give zero, I would. I had read all of the previous reviews and thought to come with an open mind. Boy was I wrong!! We were a party of 5 meeting up for lunch at 11:30 on a Thursday. It was not busy. Our server seemed prompt and we all had our drinks in a few minutes of sitting down. My menu was dirty and sticky, gross. The pages stuck together. We place our order at 11:50 and waited or over 30 minutes for order. They brought one of our party's food first. Five minutes later another of our party's food came. Her wedge salad looked disgusting. The lettuce was yellow and not even green. She also ordered a bowl of soup. It was another 5+ minutes for the rest of our table to get our food and each time our food was delivered it was by a different server than our assigned one. My half turkey classic sandwich was on bread so dry it fell apart in my hands. I ended up eating A SANDWICH with my knife and fork. My fries were ice cold. My ice tea had NO ice. Would I ever come back?? NO WAY!! There are way too many other places to eat with better service AND food! Like Newk's!"
Ben N.,"Houston, TX",0,48,5,1.0,1/24/2015,Keep driving ..... Pretty sure they microwaved everything . Lean cuisine at best . Save your money.
Grace W.,"Katy, TX",0,2,,5.0,10/6/2014,"The pizza is awesome; Hand-Toss is a bit better, but deep dish is good too. Service is great, staff works together to make sure everything goes smoothly and all guests enjoy their visit. The managers are around and make visits to tables, just to see how things are doing. The manager (Chris), very nice an caring. I will say; the Pizookie is one of my new all time favorite deserts. The original Chocolate Chip is so yummy. Although the Cookies n' Cream is soooo good too. I totally recommend good!"
Tram J.,"Katy, TX",0,4,1,2.0,8/8/2015,"I love BJ's but not this location. It was very difficult to book a reservation for a large party. The reservation dept hung up on me twice after being disconnected the first time. When I did get the reservation, the girl didn't take my name so I got a call back from them to get my name put on the party. Upon checking in 15min prior to the event, the receptionist had an attitude and the table wasn't set up. The shrimp scampi wasn't favorable, mostly noodles and a few shrimp. BJ's is great for casual outing but definitely not for family gatherings."
Maria D.,"Richmond, TX",0,7,,5.0,10/2/2015,"Had mixed feelings about going to BJ's tonight, however, everything turned out great.  There were five of us and Jerry our server was very accommodating -some of us are a bit fussy!  Everyone  had something different  and no complaints -all of us cleaned our plates!!   We will definitely return"
Breann W.,"Katy, TX",104,20,,3.0,6/16/2014,"Went in for lunch with a party of 16. I called ahead and they did a great job accommodating our party. I told our two waitresses before we ordered that everyone would be separate. At the end of our meal (the food was good!) they couldn't figure out how to separate all the orders. Other than that, the service was good. I will definitely be going back to try it again."
Random Y.,"Katy, TX",0,28,,2.0,7/27/2014,"Have been here 4 times. We were there quickly after the place opened and had a couple of good experiences. With the start up staff on hand they were all over you. Did not expect that to last but did not expect a service nose dive either.  Last 2 experiences were meh and this past Saturday evening was downright bad. Katy is getting many new places. They need to fix this. Word is apparently out about service as we did not have to wait at a prime dinner time. The staff is very confused. We had the same issue that many have mentioned. Sat too long with no contact. Then a person comes up who is not your server. Appears after that that nobody can decide who keeps the table. Food dropped at a reasonable time but no silver, slow with beer (I only ordered 2) , took ketchup forever to get to the table. Waited too long for check.  Overall sad and a glaring difference from what I experience at other BJ's locations. They were running out of beers and all servers appeared frazzled and running. Servers appear burned out? It's been open only 2-3 months I believe.  Please get it together. It is a great spot for suburbanites like my group. Management needs to take a long look at this opening and now floundering."
Dani E.,"Austin, TX",0,2,,1.0,2/5/2015,"Waitress named Nicole was extremely rude and short with our party of 14. The food took over an hour to be brought out and the checks were brought out at least 30 minutes after the entire party was done eating and ready to pay. Nicole was nowhere to be found for the majority of the night, and the restaurant was not busy at all; it was after 9pm on a Wednesday night. Horrible service, would not return. Would encourage people NOT to go. Food was not worth the wait nor being served by a waitress with a bad attitude."
Jennifer H.,"Katy, TX",0,7,,2.0,8/22/2014,"On our second attempt to try this restaurant, first time took 2.5 hours and we left, we got in with a reasonable wait time for a Friday night.  We were promptly served drinks and ordered our food.  I tried to order a drink made with the house rootbeer and was told they were out of it. I then ordered a frozen drink which upon checkout found out was over $10.  My husband ordered the brewhouse burger.  In the description it says that the burger comes with grilled onions.  When he received the burger there were no grilled onions on it. We sent it back and they had thrown raw chopped onions on it and tried to hid it under some cheese. If it doesn't come with grilled onions then take that description off the menu.  I ordered Shrimp Scampi which was angel hair pasta with no butter oil or seasoning on it very bland. The shrimp were extremely spicy.  My friend had grilled chicken pasta.  She commented that it was like eating the lipton pasta meals that come out of a pouch. The only complaint about the service is that I thought she should have notified a manager when we told her we were dissatisfied.  As a server in a past life I know I would have sent a manager to the table.   probably won't return."
Jenny P.,"Houston, TX",131,7,,5.0,6/21/2015,"Everything I eat here is always good! I love the pizza, fish and chips, jambalaya, and the Cajun pasta"
