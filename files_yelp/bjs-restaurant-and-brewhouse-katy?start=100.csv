Samantha I.,"Katy, TX",45,5,1,2.0,4/17/2015,"Don't order the steak! Had to return steak for being too salty, then they returned a steak to me that was extra tough."
Carly F.,"Houston, TX",175,32,116,3.0,7/19/2015,"Our experience was meh. Wait was way too long, especially w/ a 2 yr old. The place is you typical Bj's big & cramped, but the waitress was super sweet. One of my pet peeves is when the staff brings out new food, please take the starter plates away. Our salads were mediocre, in huge bowls & they piled up on the side as well as our artichoke dip bowl. Plus, check took forever to get & our 2 yr old was over it by then. But, our actual meals were delicious. Loved our main entrees. We may go back, but if it's repeat meh, it's a no go on the 3rd trip."
Andrea G.,"Katy, TX",563,45,119,5.0,5/21/2015,Pre Late night hype. We walked in sat at the bar for a few waiting to be greeted. After Karina finished talking with her friend she acknowledged us and asked if we needed anything I ordered a glass of Pinot noir and my husband ordered his beer. I went to the restroom and when I came back our tab was already on the table. Lol seems like she was ready to clock out. Luckily Jeremy came to the rescue and was proper and helpful attentive and sweet. I'll rate a 5 because the I felt the food was amazing and although the service was rocky at first. Jeremy made up for it.
Paula B.,"Houston, TX",2,13,1,1.0,2/27/2016,"This is by far the worst service in a restaurant I have had ever!  We waited 30 minutes to order, had to go to the hostess desk to ask for a server.  This was after 15 minutes of sitting there with numerous servers passing by our table and not acknowledging our presence!  The hostesses response was ""I am not a server"".  I knew that I again said can you please get someone to come get our drink order.  Finally someone came, took our drink order that he didn't get right!  We ordered an appetizer which the sever brought out 30 seconds before the manager brought out the meal!  I guess our server was going to leave it up there to get cold! We had to ask for drink refills and even after messing mine up the first time...he did it the second time too!!!!  The manager was very nice and comped our meal.  The food itself was excellent and we will continue to frequent BJ's just not this location."
Hannah H.,"Katy, TX",68,3,2,1.0,1/26/2015,"I'd give no stars if I could. I will never go back. We got there with two hours to spare before we were leaving town and it took an hour and a half to even get our food. As We were eating my mom ordered dessert thinking it would be ready by the time we finished  we even ordered it to go. Wrong it took almost  30 minutes to get it. And it wasn't packed to go,  my mom asked if they could pack it up real quick that we were on a time limit and the MANAGER said ""it'll take 10 minutes for me to pack it up or you can take those 10 minutes and eat it"" VERY UNPROFESSIONAL  AND NO IT WASNT BUSY"
Jennifer B.,"Katy, TX",0,3,,2.0,5/25/2016,"We went Sunday afternoon, apparently at shift change & it was terrible. I have a dairy allergy- which always throws a wrench in the works. Servers only know what a gluten allergy is, they look at me with my dairy allergy like I have antenna growing out of my head.  They took forever to print off the allergy menu that I pulled up on my phone. They switched servers on us after we put drink orders in. After we ordered it took a solid 45 min to get my SALAD and his baked ravioli. The waitress admitted they made the wrong food the first time.  My husband had to leave the table on 2 separate occasions to track down our waitress & ask where the food was & if we could have our check. When he asked where our food was, she told him she was busy scooping ice cream for another table.  The only reason I give 2 stars is because they comped half our meal for the terrible service."
Vicky M.,"Houston, TX",0,5,,5.0,4/25/2016,"I was skeptical about the name of this place lol. As soon as I got my first bite of the hamburger I ordered I fell in love. The restaurant has tvs around as well as a bar inside. I have gone with frienda and with mu baby and its comfortable enough. I do gotta say that the hostess was a bit unwellcoming, but the food made up for it. Give it a try!"
Paul E.,"Houston, TX",1,28,6,5.0,6/21/2015,"Best deep dish pizza in Houston.  Good staff, friendly and its newer so very clean.  Their craft beer is ok but they also have a decent selection of market beers."
Catherine Q.,"Key West, FL",0,1,,4.0,10/21/2016,"The location and food are nice, only thing is the service is very slow.  I will recommend it to my friends."
J. M.,"Houston, TX",10,151,14,2.0,1/8/2015,This place is so so poor. Having lived in California for 12 years I've had BJs pizza many times. Usually it's great but here it's absolutely meh. Just tasteless. The BJs Favourite pizza used to be great. Now it's just tasteless mush.  As a lover of deep dish pizza I always want that first. Now I'd rather go to Grimaldi's than come to this place.
Chyna G.,"Katy, TX",31,77,109,2.0,11/26/2014,"I came here a few months back with my mom. The insider of this place is huge. With lots and lots of booths. I didn't really like the food overall. I mean the portions were big enough.. (too big for my liking, but whateves ) But, hmmm...i dunno...something about this joint just didn't Woww me enough to want to return."
Catherine C.,"Cypress, TX",48,92,109,3.0,3/28/2015,"I came here tonight as a ""pit stop"" before Top Golf. I have only been to the location near Willowbrook, and it has never failed to deliver great food, so I expected the same from the Katy Frwy location.  Service was mediocre (?) some of our orders were mixed up... My boyfriend ordered his burger patty cooked medium and it was well done, as for our other friend who ordered the patty well done, and got medium. Also, while one of my friends left to go to the restroom before paying, she said something along the lines of ""did he walk out and leave?"" NOT professional whatsoever! I work in customer service so maybe it was a bad night but there are things you just don't say to a customer.  The reason I'm giving this an extra star more than what it deserves is because of the appetizers which were amazing! The calamari was cooked to perfection and we also ordered the Santa Fe spring rolls which were amazing as always.  I hope this location exceeds in delivering great customer service soon, otherwise it will not succeed. Regardless, I lope BJ's!"
Leanne P.,"Spring, TX",10,46,15,1.0,12/15/2014,"Ugh... where do I begin. I'm noticing a trend with my reviews. I don't seem to be happy with any place I go to eat. I guess my standards are too high with expecting hot food without the fear of being sick for days after eating out. Yes ladies and gents, another restaurant that wants to serve cold, suspect chicken.... more on that in a min.  The good bits of this place- The dining area was clean and well decorated. We went to 4 other places and were told there was a half an hour to hour wait. So it was nice to be able to get a table right away.  The waitress was okay I guess.... she was a little on the slow side, but she seemed to care about her job. The managers were nice and caring. The food-   the chips and salsa were meh... kind of stale and the salsa tasted like it came from a can. My husbands stake was completely under cooked, and my angel hair pasta dish was cold and the noodles were mush. we agreed to let them remake the order. We get the remade dishes. My husbands stake was burnt beyond belief and my pasta was hot mush with cold chicken. I was full on house salad and canned salsa with stale chips, and my hubby was ready to lose his mild manner disposition. We called the manager over again, and he took the entrees off the check. I'm still trying to figure out how 2 sodas and chips and salsa was $13, but oh well you live and learn."
Gil G.,"Richmond, TX",37,5,3,5.0,8/15/2015,Jose C. Did a great job waiting on us. The food was excellent and the waiter was very attentive and quick to refill our drinks and bus our table. We'll be back!
Jennifer D.,"Houston, TX",0,7,2,1.0,10/11/2014,"Downright awful service. Waitress had attitude deluxe. She rushed us to hurry and place an order. Then we waited more than 30 minutes for the food. The food arrived only after we asked another server to check our order.  Too bad. The concept is great with fun environment, nice menu selection and good food. However, we would be hard pressed to return because of unwelcoming service."
Tom P.,"Flatonia, TX",0,8,,1.0,1/17/2016,"Almost   Almost walked out when we sat there 10 minutes before placing drink order.  Almost 20 mins from seated to getting drinks. Chicken on wife's salad was almost cooked through. Raw in the middle kinda counts as almost.  Almost saw the manager about the raw ""crispy"" chicken strips - except that he/she never dropped by.  Almost never saw our server again after that.  Almost certain that there are enough options in Katy to never necessitate another visit here."
Mike G.,"Katy, TX",45,7,,2.0,1/3/2016,"I have been to this location a few times and never really had a problem until today. The problem I had was with the service. The food is pretty good and I enjoy the beer. I arrived and was brought a beer right away and then asked to have a football game put on the tv. Since 90% of all the tvs were on the same game I figured it wouldn't be too much to ask. I was a told all the TVs has been ""requested"" by others. Considering most of them were on the same game I doubt this was the case. I know this isn't a sports bar so I asked for my check and left half my beer. Then on top of it I was shorted a dollar on my change. It seemed as though the manager and my server just didn't care enough to even try. I'll come back for lunch or dinner but never for any sporting event."
Charlie Y.,"Houston, TX",0,97,,3.0,3/7/2016,It's OK fast food+. Good service and clean. Spaghetti and meat balls were good. Flat bread and tortilla soup were OK. Big screen TVs with sports programming.
Okechi N.,"Katy, TX",2,11,2,5.0,5/20/2014,"After visiting a few other BJs here in town and in San Antonio, I was happy to give this new location a try.  Our server couldn't have been better. She brought us refills before even finishing our drinks, was attentive and overall pleasure to be around. The calamari appetizer was a bit bland for my tastes but still tasty.  My BBQ Lunch Platter was AMAZING. Definitely a must try."
B B.,"Houston, TX",0,14,,1.0,2/13/2016,"Food was ok. Main issue was that the hostess took our names, told us it would be 20 min, then said we should go wait at the bar.  After 30-40 min, we went to check with the hostesses and they let us know they gave our table away since we didn't wait in the foyer. They didn't come get us from the bar because they weren't sure they remembered us... Even tho they suggested we wait there. Unbelievable."
