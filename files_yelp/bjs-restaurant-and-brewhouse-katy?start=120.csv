Emily M.,"Katy, TX",0,5,,2.0,10/11/2014,"This was the third strike for this location. Always had bad service before, but this time we went at off-peak hours so our hopes were high.  We used to frequent a location near Dallas and loved the food, so we were VERY excited to have one open up near our new home in Katy.  We arrived at 4 pm on a Saturday.  It was clearly a shift change. I get it, servers are finishing up the lunch shift,  and new ones are arriving for the night shift. But every restaurant has a shift change, and most are able to perform this seamlessly so the guest isn't aware!  We were never acknowledged by a host. Wait, that's a lie....One was sweeping (sidework, clearly) and TWICE asked me to move so she could sweep the spot I was standing on.  Restaurant 101: don't make the guest feel like they are keeping you from being somewhere else. This is a huge pet peeve of mine, but whatever.  Since we weren't greeted by anyone for the good 2 minutes we stood at the host stand, we decided to sit at the cocktail tables.  We were passed by 12 employees, none of whom acknowledged our existence, before my husband went to the bar for drinks. Jamie helped us out, was super nice, and apologetic for the terrible service. Then two seats opened at the bar with Jamie, so we grabbed them! We figured we'd much rather tip this guy than some server who obviously would rather lean on computers for $2.13/hr. Well, Jamie was leaving for the day too, bummer! He was the only person there that seemed to care about his job. The other bartenders were.....meh. One never looked up from the service well. The other just sucked. We ordered one app, finished it, then ordered a second app. Almost 30 minutes later, we had finished our beers and paid out (movie was starting soon) and were still waiting on our 2nd app. Had to ask the guy to box it up. No one apologized, no one even acknowledged the problem.  A simple ""I'm sorry, we'll get those out to you asap"" goes a long way. Hell, a simple ""hello"" when you stand at the host stand also goes a long way. Unfortunately,  the service has been poor each of the 3 times we've been here. Today was just the worst,  and there really was no excuse. It wasn't packed, there were tons of staffers hanging around the POS. It was clear the staff simply did not care, and management was oblivious.  We like the food and the beer, but actually getting service is just too hard. We won't be back."
Luke G.,"Houston, TX",155,18,6,2.0,4/22/2016,"If an average, loud food establishment is what you're lookin for you found the place. Our server seemed to be having a bad day. She was friendly but it seemed forced. My dads beer came barely chilled, the frosted mug no frost. I had to ask 3x's for a sugar caddy for my tea. My wedge salad came after my entree. I had the meat lovers pizza. No complaints there. Lots of meat, warm, great dough and filling. My father had the jambalaya. He commented that is was full of veggies and meat and very little rice which he appreciated. My mom had the baked ziti. It looked amazing and tasted amazing. Refills on drinks took a while and sometimes it just seemed like a daunting task. We tried the beigent. It was luke warm at best. The toppings were so cold that it made the beigent cold. Even cold it was rather tasty. Next time I'm sticking with a pizookie! So to sum up this trip Food= B Service = D would I give Bj's a second shot. I would."
LJ M.,"Houston, TX",0,7,,5.0,3/2/2017,"Our dinner was great. The appetizers were delicious:  crispy portobello mushroom strips with lemon aioli, and the calamari.  I don't eat calamari but the hubs said it was very good.  The mushrooms were surprisingly good - the batter was just right, not too thick or too thin, nor was it greasy, and the dipping sauce was a perfect pairing.  Our entrees were the New Orleans Jambalaya with chicken, sausage and shrimp, and the Lemon Thyme Chicken with rice. (I took half of my lemon thyme chicken home, as you get two chicken breasts and plenty of rice and veggies.) Both entrees were seasoned and cooked well, served hot and prompt. Service was great; in fact every time we've been here the service has been very good. Our drinks were always refreshed without having to wait or ask, and our server stopped by on occasion to ask if we needed anything.  There are so many restaurants in Katy, and this BJ's seems to have stepped it up recently to keep diners coming in.  We love the dining room as well; the big screen TVs and option to sit at the bar. We'll definitely dine here more often to try the large menu variety."
Liz A.,"Houston, TX",16,14,2,2.0,6/9/2014,"I love BJ's! With that being said, the Katy location has terrible service! We went in for the lunch hour and it took over an hour to receive our food. Our waitress was nice to offer us salads while we waited but I thought it was taking too long for a restaurant that had only 5 tables occupied.  Our food was good though. :) If you're ever in the 1960 area, visit the BJ's there, they have fantastic service!"
Shari H.,"Wimberley, TX",1,6,,5.0,2/29/2016,"Ashley S was a wonderful server. Sweet and attentive. Filled water many times. Brought our check out without our having to ask....or wait. Great service!, gold stars for Ashley!!"
Kathleen M.,"Katy, TX",0,1,,2.0,7/9/2014,"The food was pretty good - I had the pulled pork sandwich and coleslaw. The sandwich was good but the coleslaw had no dressing.   The service was horrible! Our waiter took our order, wrote nothing down, then came back some ten minutes later to see if he remembered it correctly! He had not even turned it in. My friend was served her meal about ten minutes before I got mine. The waiter did not come back until it was time to give us the bill. Bizarrely bad service."
Bryan L.,"Katy, TX",1,8,1,1.0,6/27/2014,"Came in on a Friday night was told the wait would be 30-40 mins. After 40 mins I decided to check in to see if they had mistakenly skipped us. Was told there would be an additional 15 min wait as others have ""called in"" and they were required to seat the call ins first......  When someone tells you 40 mins you it's usually UP TO 40 mins. What a waste of time. Not how I want to spend my Friday night. Table service was not any better."
Nicole K.,"Albuquerque, NM",1,10,2,5.0,4/4/2015,"I love BJ's. Consistently good with great service. My favorite salad is the asian chopped salad. Other items we've had are the fish and chips (yum), the calamari (awesome), crispy jalapeño burger (tasty) and the turkey burger (so tasty and a GREAT price)."
David H.,"Katy, TX",1,5,,1.0,7/5/2014,"Have been to other locations and this one is not the same. Service was bad and manager was useless.  Food was good but service all around was bad.  1) asked for a table of 8 on a Saturday around 5:30. BJ put us on the list but couldn't tell us how long the wait would be. The Manager had to be the one to tell us how long our wait would be, he never did. Also only 1 Manager on shift for a Saturday night. Waited ~15 minutes which wasn't bad just no communication from a manager or why a manager was needed to tell us how long the wait was.  2) tried to order one of the common beers on their tap list. They were out of that one and a few others. Learned later that they weren't out of the beer,  it was just that no one there knew how to change out a keg expect for the manager. Which again he was the only manager on shift and he was too busy to change out the keg.  3) ordered our kids' dinner at the same time ordering drinks. We ordered our food after ordering appetizer, about 10-15 min later.  Appetizer and salad came out. No kids food. Our food came out and still no kids food. We asked WTF. Waiteress said there was a mess up in the kitchen. We are pretty sure she just forgot to put the order in. Kids didn't get their meal till we were all done eating.  4) I had ordered a salad and it was finished sitting in front of me. When my entree came I had no where to put it on the table I picked up the plate to hold it while the server put the entree down. I am stuck holding the plate as the serve leaves. I had to get her attention to take the plate out of my hand.        5) to make it up to us the waitress said any desserts we ordered would be comped.  Kids ordered kids dessert and adults ordered theirs. When the bill came out only the kids desserts were comped.  They gave us four $5 coupons, and told both families could use one. We paid our tickets (2) only to then be told that only allowed one coupon could be used at a time. That was BS.  Overall, we spent close to two hours at this place and nothing went right. Asked to speak to the manager and he failed to do anything."
JS L.,"Westminster, CO",0,6,,5.0,7/18/2016,Had lunch today with my daughter. Food and service were excellent.   When we went to leave my daughter experienced a dead battery.  The hostess immediately asked the manager(Mike) for assistance.  He was able to borrow a staff members truck to help jump start my daughters truck.  It was extremely hot and not something he had to do but he went out of his way to be very helpful and even showed her how to hook the cables up ( typical teen won't listen to parent). Thanks again for excellent lunch and assistance afterwards.  This is one of our favorite spots along Katy freeway.
Paco M.,"Katy, TX",76,53,317,4.0,8/25/2014,Great atmosphere. Good food. Excellent service.  Call ahead to avoid the long waits!
Kelly K.,"Katy, TX",53,33,11,4.0,10/23/2015,It's very cold in there and the food is a hit and a miss on whether it's good or not. Service is excellent and polite.
Judy A.,"Houston, TX",0,8,,1.0,8/5/2015,"Went to lunch at BJ's with a co-worker on Tuesday. Asked for separate checks which we received (she was paying in cash), but she got mine and my credit card was charged for hers. Brought this to the server's attention and server said she would correct the error. She then charged my credit card for my meal but never removed the charge for my co-worker's entrée. When I called today (Wednesday, Aug 5 at 5:59 pm, I was placed on hold for a Manager. At 6:15 pm, Manager still had not picked up the phone. I will be going over there shortly. I left a $5.00 cash tip for a $15.00 meal at BJ's. Never again."
Cole P.,"Houston, TX",94,206,58,2.0,6/18/2015,I believe they cut the portion size on the entree portion grilled chicken Cesar salad. It's half the size compared to last time.
K K.,"TX, TX",49,640,63,3.0,5/23/2014,"Experiences in Austin have been awesome, Katy is not in Austin.  Staff undertrained and struggling, enough moons have passed to have a smooth Friday happy hour.  Ladies restroom at 6:00 p.m. out of soap.  How are the employees washing their hands? Thought happy hour prices were the ticket for us, a party of two at a hamster ball for 400 was our first impression.  In this type of crowd we usually head for the bar and can find two stools to squeeze in.  A staff person told us to sit in a booth in the bar area, pretty sure we should have been added to those waiting for an hour.  Noise level was not where you could order without yelling, conversation impossible, nice touch to watch ESPN.   Ordered, happy hour fried artichokes, $4.50, the Mexican spring rolls and sliders, $5.00 each.  The Colorado bulldog (bar slaughtered this and charged $8.00), chased it with a cosmo, meh, non beer drinkers, craft beers $4 until 7:00 p.m. When order was delivered no mustard or ketchup, but plastic bottles were bought out to the table, more purell required.  Asked for the check, $35 deposited and the staff person was polite and did refill our water glasses. Feeling like James Bond we traversed the tightrope out of here, baby stroller parked at a table on the way out, insurance claims will be filed soon. Never coming back.  Parking nightmarish."
Lequita J.,"Katy, TX",1,9,3,5.0,8/22/2015,I freaking love this place is so amazing the food is delicious and the drinks are great. I visit this establishment three out of seven days a week. The ambience is great and the customer service is impeccable. I'm the happiest I've ever been when having an out to eat experience best place in Katy ever.
Jessica H.,"Pflugerville, Austin, TX",8,7,,1.0,5/10/2014,"We arrived to be told it was a 20 to 25 minute wait.  We had a party of 6, not a huge party. People kept getting seated before us. Several were larger parties. When I inquired, I was told they had reservations. And then it would only be another 10 minutes.  Finally after an hour of being told 10 more minutes and more people getting seated before us, I asked for the manager.  He apologized. I explained if we would have known it was an hour wait, we would have gone somewhere else. Especially because we had a 3 year old with us. He said he would take care of an appetizer for us.  After all that we were seated for 6 people with two sets of silverware. After asking for silverware twice, we finally just got our own. The service was extremely slow. Had to ask three times for ice because we had no ice in the tea. Food took thirty minutes to arrive at the table.  When we finally a check, we were charged for the appetizer. I waited to tell the sever, but after several minutes, I finally just took the check back to the manager and he took the appetizer off.  NEVER AGAIN.  HORRIBLE SERVICE. food was great, but not worth the hassle."
Brad G.,"Houston, TX",213,256,221,3.0,9/11/2014,"The food was very good but the service was slow. Had the Pita Chicken tacos and would order them again. Well decorated, great selections, reasonable priced just slow service."
Kim N.,"Houston, TX",277,216,1299,2.0,9/11/2014,"The first and maybe last time... maybe I will come in for adult beverages and pizza, and appetizers. The food service was very slow. I guess I had high expectations for this place since it's in a very busy area with many other restaurants. The prices on on the dishes were reasonable they actually are about the same prices as Chili's. I did like the atmosphere and that it was nice and clean inside. (It's a pretty new location) I got the Hawaiian Mahi Mahi it was pretty salty and the pineapple fried rice was mushy white rice served with ""stir-fried"" vegetables. The vegetable consists of thinly sliced bell peppers,  onions, and carrots. I actually enjoyed the small bite of the kid's deep dish pepperoni pizza more than my meal. The whole pizza dough had texture and taste like pizza huts' crust. (The bread crust was the whole pizza. Airy and crisp) The spinach stuff mushrooms were not bad but I've had tastier at Olive Garden. ( I prefer Carrabas for chain Italian to be honest). My FIL got the thyme chicken he said the chicken was good but the brussel sprouts were under very cooked. (Raw) my hubby got a sad looking half sandwich with a very watery chicken tortilla soup that we had to ask our waitress about 5 minutes after our food came out. Chicken soup is very good and hearty at Jimmy Changas across the freeway. The waitress seemed nice but she did not give good service. I think she had way too many big party tables at one time.."
Ian C.,"Katy, TX",48,15,,1.0,11/23/2015,"I have never in my life experienced such bad service. The drinks came out slow. Then the salads came, they got that right. The appetizer came out wrong and cold and with 1/2 the main course. 5 minutes later we got 2 more plates. Still missing 1 main course at this point and still have the wrong appetizer. It was then that service ground to a halt it took 10 Min to get the correct food on the table. Then it took 30 min to get the check and 20 min to get it returned. During this time I made several attempts to get the attention of the manager including making eye contact and waving him over. He actually turned the other way and went into the kitchen for an extended period. My family and I have been to many bj's and have usually had great experiences but this was terrible."
