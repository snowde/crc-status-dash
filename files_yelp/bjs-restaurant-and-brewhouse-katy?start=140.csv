Edmund E.,"Wells Branch, Austin, TX",22,23,,2.0,10/17/2015,"I have a hard time rating the restaurant. My server Jerry was beyond amazing! He let me enjoy my time while dining alone on a business trip on a Friday evening. I never felt rushed or felt he was annoyed with me.  He was honest and I could tell he had a passion for being in the service industry. However beyond him and the Brussels sprouts this place is terrible.   I ordered a Caesar salad with steak and it took 2.5 hours to get the steak (a sirloin med-rare) correct.  First time it was a still mooing ribeye. Then it was the same ribeye slightly cooked. The. 2 more attempts until it was correct.  When I politely spoke with the manager about the issue his exact words were ""well we aren't a steak house so what do you expect"".  Whaaaaaaaaat?!?! Regardless of whatever your establishment is based upon, you offer a menu with variety.  That being said, it isn't rocket science to cook a steak. Unless no one in your kitchen knows what a cow is, let alone a steak! That is a poor excuse for a poorly run kitchen. I've worked in the service industry for numerous years now and to have this type of excuse handed to me was and is beyond unacceptable. I corrected this manager and the look on his face was pretty priceless. Never in my years of eating out have I had that excuse coupled with a steak salad taking 2.5 hours.  However now we will discuss Jerry.  He obviously cares enough about his guests and his job that after all the dust settled he sat down with me and asked me how he could improve what happened this evening.  I throughly enjoyed the conversation with this young man and I can only hope this establishment learns from their mistakes and can correct them accordingly. I give Jerry 5+ stars but the restaurant 1.  So if you choose to eat here make sure you request to eat in Jerry's section. He will make your experience amazing."
Marv M.,"Katy, TX",184,50,1017,4.0,4/21/2014,I like BJ's a lot. Very nice and friendly place to take your whole family. Even if the adults want to drink more than enough beer and alcohol here. People do not get rowdy very friendly. Can't go wrong with the Pizookie to end your night.
Dorinda O.,"Katy, TX",12,13,,2.0,12/10/2015,"Service has gotten better but the kitchen is still jacked up! We still eat there because we love BJ's Brewhouse but this location lets us down every single time! Their kitchen staff suffers big time! We have NEVER had a meal where the food did not come out jacked up in some way shape or form. Bringing it to the attention of the managers does no good. BJ's Brewhouse use to be a family favorite for birthdays but this year they have ruined 2 with horrible food, slower than normal service and lack of making it right or making it up! I'm not sure we will return to this location despite our love for BJ's Brewhouse. We will just have to go to the Sugar Land location or find a new location."
Jason P.,"Richmond, TX",0,10,,1.0,1/22/2016,"I would not recommend this place. Not only do the wait staff not know answers to simple/common questions, they are not attentive to their customers. Ordered Spinach Artichoke Dip and the chips that come with the dip were so greasy, there was oil collected at the bottom of the plate. Asked for a replacement order of chips and waited over 15 minutes, they never brought the chips. So our dip was cold when our food showed up, and we never got to enjoy our appetizer. When our food showed up, the lettuce on our burger was wilted and brown. The meat was burnt and looked inedible. Needless to say we walked out never getting to eat our food and never getting a refill on our drinks. Biggest was of an hour. Do NOT go there unless you prefer subpar service and low quality food."
Mike M.,"Katy, TX",1,44,1,3.0,7/24/2016,"We used to go to BJ's often and thought most of the food was good, a few things were stand outs like the deep dish pizza, chicken fried chicken, salmon.  But over the past few months we stopped as the food and service has gone down.  Don't know if management changed or stopped carrying but something has happened recently."
Brent H.,"Houston, TX",0,4,,1.0,1/20/2016,"Right off I am a regular patron of this BJ's location & when I visit, 50% of the time it's a to-go order.   I will sit at the bar & place my to-go order there for I know the main bartenders & they know me.  They know how to properly take care of their customers, which I can see in their repeat business for I see many customers coming up to the bar calling them by name.  The experience I am writing about just happened to be a day in which neither one of them were there. I came in on Mon.  Jan. 18 at 5:30pm to order a to-go pizza.  As normal I went to the bar to place my order, which they only had one other customer sitting at it & I sat one seat over from him.  There were three employees behind the bar & they were at the speed well end of the bar toward the back of the restaurant talking to each other (the other guy at the bar & me were at the middle part of the bar).  I figured that in a minute or two they would look up & come over to see what I needed.  After 10 minutes (and yes I timed it), they still had not even acknowledged my presence nor less asked if there was anything I wanted. What made it even worse is that I found out one of the three employees behind the bar was actually one of the location's managers.  During those 10 minutes that manager & one of the bar keepers even walked by me twice without saying anything to me. I actually got up & walked out of the restaurant, while nobody at the bar or at the front door said anything to me, & called home telling my family about my experience while also asking them what they wanted me to do since no one there was interested in me or my business.  They really wanted the pizza so I told them I would go in again for only 5 minutes & if I wasn't waited on then I would leave & we would make other dinner plans.  As I was going in the only other bar patron was coming out shaking his head saying to me he would have walked out sooner if they would have ignored him like they did me.  When I went back in I was the only person sitting, in the same seat I was originally in, at the bar. After about 4 minutes someone who had not been behind the bar came in & actually asked me if there was anything I needed (this was about 20 minutes after I first sat down).  I figured I would see how this whole visit would play itself out, so I didn't say anything other than just place my to-go order. When the pizza came out it was about 6:20pm.  I checked it & found that the kitchen had used a practice involving the hamburger on the pizza that I thought had ended the last time I complained about it.  The hamburger, the tiny bit that was present, was cooked in well done state for meat.  That is because former employees of this BJ's location told me at times the kitchen would take a previously cooked hamburger, cut it up, & put it on the pizza before it went into the oven.  The results ended up being twice cooked hamburger, again what little hamburger there was on it. The main bartenders know I look for that kind of thing & part of their exceptional customer service is to let the kitchen know not to do it, but again they were not there.  Since I still had a bit of a drive ahead of me, I just took it as it was & left letting them know on the receipt, where it ask for the tip, that they could read about my experience on Yelp. When I got home I found the pizza to be ok, but only after taking the hamburger off of it."
Katherine H.,"Houston, TX",0,8,,1.0,7/12/2015,"First of all I had a pick up order. I was told it would be 15 minutes which I though was perfect for the drive over. I get there a little bit late so about 20 minute already and then have to wait another 15 for someone to help me and get me my food. I was asked if I was helped by 4 different people and every time I said no they just walked off. Rude. I have eaten at other BJ's and had wonderful service and food. Usually the siracha brussels sprouts are amazing, from this location they were so horrible over salted I almost vomited.  Pretty much lost my appetite at that point. Will never come to this location again. Would rather make the drive to a further location."
James D.,"Lenoir City, TN",47,18,4,1.0,1/14/2016,It has the makings of a great restaurant and bar. All that is missing is good food and descent service. Shame I had to even give a star.
Walt T.,"Katy, TX",29,2,,5.0,6/17/2016,"Another fantastic night at BJ's. We tried the 2 new appetizers, Portebella and Asparagus they were outstanding and Tori our Server was great. Food, Beer and Service were awesome can one ask for? Walt, Kay and Brian"
Steve T.,"Houston, TX",1,1,5,1.0,10/30/2014,"We need A1 for us steak, first bottle they give us almost empty,im ask give us more,second bottle the same,we ask again then he said no more A1. I dont know this is big restaurant ,why they dont have the A1 for the custommer."
Samantha H.,"Katy, TX",110,1,,5.0,12/18/2015,"Great service! Absolutely loved our waiter, Brian. The food here is always great but the wait staff just makes the whole experience so much better."
Mirra B.,"Houston, TX",1,13,17,3.0,9/7/2015,"Had a friendly and fun waiter, but he was working too many tables at once to be able to be more attentive. Very loud noise level. The BLT salad was drenched in dressing that tasted like sushi puree, making it a flavor disaster. It wasn't good. The spinach stuffed mushrooms were okay. We had a good time, but probably wouldn't have as much if we weren't drinking."
Kaela S.,"San Antonio, TX",13,20,3,1.0,7/3/2015,"Well our waiter made it clear he was trying to get out of here before we even got our appetizers. He told us he had plans before we ordered anything.  When we did get our appetizer it was cold. The bottle of wine I ordered took 30 minutes because it was in the managers office apparently. Our steaks were over cooked and unapetizing and when I spoke with the manager he agreed service was subpar, but did nothing to rectify the situation. They could do so much better and I am sorely disappointed. Go somewhere else. Houston has a lot to offer."
Hakim S.,"Katy, TX",0,17,19,5.0,6/22/2016,I have to say the Honey Sriracha Brussels sprouts were really tasty. It's a huge portion. It was my dinner along with the tomato mozzarella salad. Great service and great food. Been here before and will continue coming back. Big TVs at the bar and quite a selection of craft beers.
Rose W.,"Houston, TX",9,75,33,4.0,6/20/2015,the food was awesome the service was outstanding. Our waiter was brief. the desserts looked good. My hubby wanna go back and try the pizzas and alcohol. Happy hour is 3-11 Sunday thru Wensday. I had the parmesin crusted chicken topped with roasted red peppers with mash potatoes and steamed vegetables. Hubby had the fish and chips. We both had peach tea which was delicious! I wanna go back for the desserts! The wait was only 20 minutes:-)
Chris G.,"Houston, TX",0,6,3,3.0,9/14/2014,This was our second visit. The first was pretty bad. They had just opened and were packed which is fine but after waiting for a table we weren't happy to have to wait an extra long time for food and drinks. The poor waitress then got triple sat after she was already in the weeds. We also had to go ask the hostess for silverware along with all the other tables around us. But the food was great so we said we would go again after they get settled in.  Went back this week. Much better. Sat in the bar lounge. Super friendly and prompt waitress. The lettuce wraps are the best out there and you must try the peach cobbler.  We will be back and hope to get the same service because the food is really good
Grace L.,"Katy, TX",98,53,19,3.0,3/28/2016,"I ordered the blue cheese and bacon burger and the bun was double the size of the meat... Very disappointing.. But at least the server was nice and when I usually come here, the food is great. So 3 stars"
Charles G.,"Houston, TX",0,8,,5.0,4/16/2016,Came Saturday lunch and was really a delightful experience. Food and service was great! Service has improved drastically!
Bryan T.,"Houston, TX",7,6,1,4.0,6/19/2015,"Big bummer last night. Truck was broken into.  Lost my laptop and iPad.  Live and learn, eh?"
