Carmen F.,"Katy, TX",76,30,94,4.0,5/28/2015,I always have good service here. Waiters are great and the drinks are awesome. Everything that I have ordered here has been delicious so far. My only con is that the kitchen is kind of slow. I will still come back.
Silvia H.,"Houston, TX",0,1,,1.0,1/1/2015,Placed an order for curbside pickup. Arrived 45 minutes later and I was told that they had never received the order.  The reception/reservation desk attendants were rude when I asked about the To-Go counter and the manager (who I believe actually took the order originally...sure did sound a lot like him) was a bit dismissive when I asked him to address the situation. I actually had to convince him to compensate me for my wait.  All I got was 25% off my pizza order :( Would NOT recommend this location because of inadequate and inattentive customer service.
Brant B.,"Katy, TX",1,13,2,3.0,3/18/2015,The food is inline with the price. The pizza is very good but the best aspect of the place is the beer. Good atmosphere and a place I'll be going back to.
Melvonna K.,"Houston, TX",13,29,6,3.0,5/11/2014,"First time to try never been to another BJ'S Spinach artichoke dip was great, mozzarella salad was great, root beer was great. Roast beef sandwich was good but had a tinge of stale or freezer bite taste. Chicken fried steak was terrible, chewy rubbery mystery meat. Gonna take awhile for me to want to give it a try again at least for entrees"
Heather G.,"Katy, TX",29,21,3,1.0,6/29/2015,"Where to start. First, just to order drinks was at least 5 minutes, then another 15 for the appetizer to come out. Spinach and artichoke dip. Not the greatest. Then, I ordered a lunch combo with a sandwich. I didn't know the pulled pork sandwich was not on the menu. It came out a full sandwich and I sent it back. After waiting we asked to see the manager. Apparently the pork sandwich isn't on the lunch menu but I wasn't told it wasn't. Whatever, I just sent it back. I'll pay for the bowl of soup (it tasted like it came from a can) and my drink. My friend ordered a Peanut Butter S'more. It came out as a cookie with ice cream. Not at all what the description says it is with marshmallows."
Bob A.,"Houston, TX",1,3,,1.0,1/15/2015,"Poor service and over priced for average tasting food.  The friendliness of the waiter is not enough to overshadow all the short comings.  All 3 times I have eaten here my order has been screwed up.  So, 3 strikes and you're out!"
Emily D.,"Cypress, TX",6,38,42,3.0,3/30/2015,"The waitress was really nice but she made several mistakes on my party of 6's table. The atmosphere was nice and family friendly. I enjoyed the calamari very much, the chicken Alfredo was pretty dry though. And I enjoyed the strawberry lemonade very much!"
Jared B.,"Houston, TX",34,27,9,1.0,3/15/2015,"This place is nuts! Today, my family showed up a little after 11:00 AM. The hostess and apparent manager in a blue shirt were not happy to see us. In fact, we never got a ""welcome to BJ's"" from either. There were 10 of us in total, and I don't think the hostess knew how to set a table in the computer for a party of our size. I heard the blue-shirt guy speak quietly to the hostess - ""we'll just put two tables together - push this button"". Neither smiled or appeared happy. I asked the hostess, ""is there a problem with us being here""? She said no but they didn't have any servers yet. WTF? We showed up when the place was open, but there was no wait staff to take orders??? We left and will not return."
Torrie F.,"Cypress, TX",7,57,27,1.0,11/17/2015,"There service is horrible. A reservation was made for a large party. The 1 star is for accommodating the large party. We had 1 waiter for a party of 15+. 1 ladies food didn't come out for 30+ minutes after everyone was served thier entree. She had to remind waiter. One of the children spilled his apple juice and it took asking 4 different staff members to get it up only for the manager to come out and say, "" oh we were waiting on you all to leave to clean it up!"" So you would rather risk a customer falling then bring a mop? They got the bill mostly right.  The waiter seemed tired and frustrated. A party that large I can understand. The tea and margaritas tasted like they had bren prepared by the Koolaid man himself!  Once we got past the greeters the politeness went out the window. None of us will ever step foot in another one of these locations. The slab of pork ribs had no flavor and was nasty."
Erin R.,"Houston, TX",0,2,,1.0,5/16/2014,"My family and I had a horrible experience. We had called ahead (we were a party of six) and were sat quickly. Our waiter took over five minutes to take our drink orders, ten minutes to get our drinks to us and even longer for beers. Our beers always took a long time. Our waiter blamed his fellow waitstaff for not running his beers for him. Every time a new round was brought out the pours were different. One time it looked as though someone had taken a big drink out of one.  Our food took over 30 minutes, my dish was cold, all other dishes were served on very hot plates (as though they were under a heat lamp) and my sons order was wrong.  We asked for a manager who came over and said he would buy us a round of beer - which we never got but were charged for. I took two bites of my food and sent it away - that food was also on the bill.  This was a Thursday night. I cannot image a Friday or Saturday night. Stay away!"
Caroline M.,"Houston, TX",9,40,2,4.0,5/14/2015,I like going here with family but if I can be honest I haven't been impressed with any dish I have ever ordered except the tomato mozzarella salad. Those are super yummy. Even my mixed drink was not good but my husband always orders the best dishes!  I don't know how that always happens. The Mediterranean tacos are super good and their pizzas are yummy. I just wish I ordered them!
Lynda T.,"Richmond, TX",7,40,14,1.0,9/17/2014,"3rd visit at this Katy location. 1st and 2nd time I thought food was decent and service was poor but it was during lunch and dinner time.. So that was understandable. 3rd and final visit tonight at this location. Arrived close to 10 PM, place is not crowded but service was very slow. Was seated promptly and drink orders taken and served. Asked if we can place our order and was told she's not our waitress. She proceeded to walk away to who I assume is our waitress (standing at register 1 booth behind us) to let her know we are ready. Still waiting for another 15 min. and our waitress finally approach the table to take our orders. Slow service and food order when arrived was incorrect. Have been to the SugarLand location multiple times and service/food there is much better! Sorry but will not return to this Katy location again."
S H.,"Energy Corridor, Houston, TX",0,14,2,5.0,11/4/2014,"I am a huge fan of this restaurant chain in general but I've been to this location multiple times and never had an issue. Service has always been good, beer and food is delicious like usual. This is a great restaurant to take a group because they offer such a wide variety, I love their enlightened entrees section when I'm watching what I eat and I love their pizzas when I'm not. Every dish I've tried has been good. One of my favorite casual restaurants!!"
See E.,"Houston, TX",3,8,5,4.0,4/30/2015,"Drinks were good. Food was decent, dessert was delish! A few mixed reviews but will try this place again."
Victor G.,"Katy, TX",9,59,29,1.0,8/19/2014,"Came for lunch and the were not to busy, I saw many open tables.  I only had a party of two.   The hosted said the wait was 5 to 10 minutes.  I saw many open tables in the bar area and the regular sitting area and it still took them about 10 minutes to seat me. The table that I saw was empty when I arrived is the table they seated me in.  I am not sure why that wait happened.  Some party's of 4 came after me and they were seated immediately. The server way ok, it took forever to get our food, and when the food finally came it was incomplete.  They did offer my wife a salad until the rest of her food came.  It took us 1 1/2 hours for lunch!  The burger I ordered was ok the piece of lettus they put on it was the white hard butt end of the lettus !  The menu also stated that it came with mayonnaise and a special sauce which I had to ask and wait for because it did not come out with the burger.  My wife ordered  the tacos with black beans,  the tacos came out and we're very small,  the black beans never came out to the end of the meal. Very disappointed in this location and this place, i do not believe I will ever be back."
Stuart D.,"Houston, TX",0,2,,1.0,7/13/2014,"REVIEW BY FORMER BJ'S SERVER:  Dining date: 7/13/2014 at 12 am.  Preface: Yes, we ate very late. That is no excuse for poor service. If a restaurant is open, it should be functional.  Let me begin  with our VERY FIRST interaction with the staff. My girlfriend and I walk into the restaurant. The hostess doesn't acknowledge us at all. No greeting, nothing. Instead, she proceeds to grab menus with the most dreary frown that I've ever seen and ask ""So, two?"". Then she sluggishly proceeds to seat us at a 2 top that's only one part booth. Really? In the entire empty restaurant you can't even give us a whole 2 top booth?  Now, if you're not familiar with the duties of Hostess' interaction with guests you're in luck because I am here to demystify the incredibly difficult job of the under appreciated hostess...They are as followed:  SAY HELLO TO SOMEONE WHEN THEY CHOOSE YOUR ESTABLISHMENT. BE NICE TO THEM. YOU'RE THE FIRST PERSON THE GUEST SEES, SO LEAVE A LASTING FIRST IMPRESSION. And for the more advanced hostesses there's this super incredible technique: ASK THEM HOW THEY'RE DOING. Seriously, that's their only job when interacting with guests. As I said, I worked there. And I still work in restaurants. Their ONLY job is to be nice and seat the guest. SHE HAD ONE JOB....And she couldn't do it. She should be fired.  Table Service: Once seated by our lovely hostess, my girlfriend and I picked out what we wanted. We know the menu well, we didn't need time to look anything over. However, this kind establishment was generous enough to give us 10 minutes to decide what we wanted to drink. In other words: Nobody even stopped by the table to say ""Hey, I'm a bit busy, I'll be right back."" NOTHING! We were ready to leave at this point.  However, after 10 minutes(which is an abysmal excuse for service and is completely unacceptable by Bj's Corporate standards) we were greeted by Devan. Devan was the ONLY GOOD THING about this restaurant. I'll admit that I was a bit frustrated already but she handled it superbly. Yet, there's another twist. DEVAN WASN'T EVEN OUR SERVER! She was actually so fantastic that we tipped her instead of our server. This restaurant is lucky to have at least one competent server.   Now, you may be wondering why someone who wasn't our server is the one greeting us and taking our order. Remember, it's 12 am. At this point in the day, management has decisions to make. In order to cut costs, management sends every server home and only keeps on their VERY BEST SERVERS. These are the closers. These people are responsible for making sure everyone is helping to clean up the restaurant and take the remaining tables. Apparently our ACTUAL server was too busy to even stop by and show his face. Now I will say this-the place was fairly busy. But if our server was too busy then management made a very poor decision to place so much responsibility upon one person who is incapable of handling such a work load.  Fast forwarding another 10 minutes: Devan has brought our drinks, taken our order and brought our first course. WE STILL HAVEN'T SEEN OUR SERVER. After a few astonishing moments, we are finally introduced to Tim. If you can even call it an introduction. Tim walks past us in a rush and faces us with his backside and says ""Everything good over here?"" No, Tim...Everything is not good over here. We then proceed to tell Tim that we would like Devan as our official server. To which Tim replies that she's already cut. Instead of apologizing for completely neglecting the people that are supposed to tip him, Tim proceeds to give me half-attempted excuses for why he hasn't been by. He even said that he chose Devan to delegate some of his responsibilities. First of all, that's not how you delegate responsibility. You don't make someone do EVERYTHING and not even stop by to say hi. Secondly, you don't give excuses, you apologize. If you'll recall, Tim is a CLOSER. Not to mention he has a badge that signifies his excellence as a server. This guy is LITERALLY the best this restaurant has to offer. And we saw him a total of 3 times the entire evening. Drinks were empty, plates weren't bussed. We notified Tim that our tip will still be going to Devan because she literally did 98% of the work.  The food was good. Bj's has very tasty food. But this was one of the worst service experiences I've ever had. EVER. Do yourself a favor and vote with your dollar so that these people learn how to run a restaurant."
S S.,"Katy, TX",37,54,42,2.0,12/28/2014,"The Sunday waitstaff is not the best and our food was cold! We arrived at 11:15am, the place was empty so service and hot food should have been a no brainer."
Karhleen T.,"Houston, TX",0,13,,1.0,3/13/2016,"Please do not let Spencer work as a bartender anymore. We come here all the time and the last 2 times we have Spencer at the bar. He is terrible! He does not wait in you he takes his time ( slow) with everything, we had a 25 minute wait for French fries. We had to reach over the bar for a menu ask for silverware and say excuse me to place our order...I could understand if it was busy in here but there was 7 people seated at the bar and about one fourth of the restaurant was full."
Matthew S.,"Katy, TX",0,3,1,4.0,3/15/2015,Just moved to Katy and have already eaten here twice.  Service was a little slow on my second visit but still got our entrees and desert in a timely manner.  Nice variety of their craft beers.  The food was great and the mashed potatoes were some of the best I've had at a restaurant.  Be sure to save room for their poozookie.
Kimberly N.,"Katy, TX",99,33,,1.0,8/30/2015,"Poor service and food. Will not be returning. Went with a party of 5 and sincerely feel like a waste of my money. Calamari burned to a crisp. Food took an hour. Drinks never refilled. Floor and table dirty. Told waitress and she brought me a towel to Put under our feet. Did not offer to have it cleaned. Not impressed. First time I tried BJs it was great but after this experience, I will not be returning"
