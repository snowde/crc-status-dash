Staci I.,"Houston, TX",2,2,2,4.0,5/1/2015,Went here mainly to try the pizookie. I got the salted caramel pizookie. I also tried the strawberry margarita and double berry cocktail which has cider and lindenmans framboise. All of this was great. I kept a lighter entree to leave room for all of this. I got the fried mahi tacos. Our server was helpful. My friend asked for a sweet tea but got served unsweetened. He also forgot to bring sugar. He seemed really busy so its understandable.
Cher B.,"Katy, TX",3,9,7,1.0,1/22/2015,"Awe... I have to give them a star?? First visit we went for my brother's Bday dinner. We endured a slew of BS. Manager lost our reservation Offered no help or apologies! We waited an hour and a half to be sat. With small children this was a pain  Lengthy wait time. Service was slow and that was with 4 servers working our party of 20. Server messed up food & drink orders Service took forever. Had to go to the bar for refills. Added wait time because everyone's ticket was wrong.  *Second visit I went just my family of 4 thinking maybe they were thrown off by a 20 top. I was wrong. We were sat fast.. That was good. But, then it took us an hour before we saw our food. Our waitress disappeared on us. LITERALLY!! So, we had to go back and forth to the bar to get refills like our first visit. Then when we got our food we were told our 2 year olds plate wasn't ready yet. I fed him off of my plate bc by now we have been in the restaurant for an hour and a half before getting food so he was not happy. When his food arrived he wasn't even hungry because he had eaten off of my plate for 20 minutes. So, yeah.. I gladly paid my ticket and got out of there. I knew there was no need to talk to management seeing that they suck just as well. I'm done with this place. I will NEVER step foot in this BJ's EVERRRRR!!! Guaranteed!! For great food, great price, great service, kid friendly environment.. Try Jimmy Changas."
Stephen E.,"Katy, TX",35,51,7,1.0,6/10/2014,"Very disappointed in this location. I have been to the B.J.'s in Sugarland several times and the location in League City several times without issue. Food and service at the locations has always been good. The new Katy location is NOT, I repeat Not what you would expect from B.J.'s. We were seated promptly. Ordered sweet tea to start and received unsweet. Asked server for sweet tea again and was told ""there is sweetener right in front of you on the table"". I asked ""do you serve sweet tea?"" Yes we do, he replied. Then please get us sweet tea. He did so begrudgingly. Went straight downhill from there. Had to ask for plates or anything else you would think is normally done (such as refills). We have been a B.J. rewards member for years. When we got home I went online and wrote a specific complaint. Was advised by a auto reply for comments would be addressed within two working days. When 5 working days had passed I wrote them again including my original email along with additional comments on how I was seeing a mirror image of customer care at the corporate level and the restaurant location had displayed. Once again received a reply that my comments had now been elevated to a ""Customer Care specialist"" and I would be contacted in 3 to 5 working days. You guessed it, it's been 7 days now and nary a word. Moral of the story is ""B.J.'s could care less"". Take your chances, the food may or may not be good, the service may or may not be acceptable and you may or may not have a nice dining experience. The only sure thing is that if you don't, tough beans. They could care less what you think or have to say. Don't bother us with your complaints is the B.J.'s attitude."
Elizabeth E.,"Katy, TX",0,4,1,2.0,4/22/2015,"I've been to other BJ's and for some reason have always had bad waiter service at this one. I would recommend sitting at the bar because the bartenders are great. Servers are not attentive, food comes out wrong or cold majority of the time.  I keep going back because it's a better alternative for a later meal and beer than a crowded smokey bar.  I would recommend servers be retained or service standards be reinstated because the service I receive every time is far below average.  Overall I enjoy the atmosphere and the beer is great!"
Kathy M.,"Houston, TX",9,17,,2.0,6/8/2014,"Was super excited to see BJs come to Katy, but was so disappointed when I finally made it out. Service was terrible, drinks were slow, items were forgotten and when we're finally enjoying our dinner, the server brings us our check. Oh, you're ready for us to leave?! I asked our server why the check wasn't brought at the end of the meal in which he replied ""Our manager tells us to bring the check during the meal."" Not a good idea to tell your customers to leave - no coffee, dessert or final drink offered.  I'll give you some time to get it together before I venture out again."
Shola A.,"Cypress, TX",9,33,1,3.0,7/27/2014,"Service was great!!!! My waitress was really nice and tried to meet all my ""princess"" (daughter's) demands.  The food was mediocre overall.  I got the chicken club.   Nothing special but ok.  The fries were cold.   My daughter got a pizza and it was good.  My son got tenders which I didn't really care for."
Lauren P.,"Katy, TX",115,102,11,2.0,8/15/2015,Nothing special here. Got the deep dish pizza and it didn't have hardly any sauce. Service was ok. Had chicken plate time before and it was under seasoned.  This will be the last time we come here
Brianna T.,"Rosenberg, TX",2,9,,4.0,1/28/2015,"We took a group of about 12 to this location for a staff Christmas party.  We neglected to make a reservation, so there was a wait, but we were seated. The restaurant was very busy, so our waiter was hard to come by at times, and our food took awhile, but we had a nice time anyway. I would go back."
Pomares C.,"South Main, Houston, TX",1,3,,1.0,11/19/2014,"The food was ok, nothing out of the ordinary,  but the service rendered by Mr Brian P, lacked of manners and training. Very poor costumer service. Might never go back again to this place. So many other  places with similar menú and.much better train staff"
Morticia M.,"Katy, TX",14,22,23,3.0,11/16/2014,"Service was kind of slow, food was really good, nice atmosphere very clean. But hubby said he seen a waiter in the restroom that didn't wash his hands after using the restroom. Not sure if we will eat there again"
Conota B.,"Houston, TX",84,18,8,2.0,10/2/2014,"It was a pleasant afternoon and my wife and I  decided on BJ's over Mesquite Grill, just because I generally like the their causal atmosphere. There was a group of young boys in front of us, and one of them decided to take a selfie with his friends and the hostess up front. I believe they retook the pic because the other hostess wasn't in the first one. After that was finished we were greeting. Not the kind of welcoming atmosphere i am used to. I little acknowledgement before the 1st pic or even after would have gone a long way. We were sat quickly and our waitress did a quick table visit, while she was attending to a big top. She was extremely friendly and efficient while waiting us, checking back several times. She apologized for taking longer than she wanted because of her other table, which wasn't necessary, but appreciated. She was by far the best part of our experience. We ordered the Santa Fe rolls. They came out quickly and as usual, they were delicious. For dinner we shared the Brewhouse burger, medium, because for me med-well is too dry. Our burger arrived, I cut it in half and discovered sprinkles of pink in a mostly dark burger. The fries were as over done as my burger, but my waitress returned shortly and quickly went to re-fire another burger for us.  Everything was fine, that happens.  The manager came by our table, which I expected to go better than it did. He began saying they are preparing our burger, then went on to say, ""We looked at it in the back and it was pink to us"". Okay...first, who is we? Second, are you implying that my crispy brown burger was medium. Lastly, are you saying I have it all wrong? After the confusion had passed, I replied that i just wanted my burger medium, which is a thick pink center. He suggested that he can have it prepared under what I want to make sure. To me that meant med-rare. I agreed because med-rare  is better than med-well.  Later, the same ""its not me its you"" manger came to the table with the new burger. I cut it in half and...it was med-well. I expected medium and even med-rare, but not med-well. For the love God! There was a thin line of pink and it wasn't as dry as the 1st burger. I can say the fries were definitely better thou, better the burger as well. It was certainly not medium. But, if the manager doesn't now medium, then what should I actually expected. I said it was fine, it was better. I was visible not satisfied, but  he was happy with that and was gone.  Afterwards, I scanned Yelp and to my pleasant surprise (sarcasm), they had 2 1/2 stars. ""Now it makes since"", I thought to myself. The restaurant is aesthetically pleasing, the beer selection is grand, the service was magnificent, the food mediocre and the manager, slightly pompous.  Will I go back? Its doubtful. There is continual competition in this industry, so why gamble on your dinning experience."
Ray D.,"Katy, TX",72,26,,2.0,8/1/2015,"Ok, so I gave this place 2 tries. My first visit was much better than the second. On my second visit my waitress allowed my glass to be empty for far too long. I hated their lemonade. Plus the waitress broke a mug in front of me and glass went everywhere. I should have asked for a new plate cause I could have gotten glass in my food. The pizookie which is their famous desert was good but other than that I'm not impressed. Oh and don't order the scrimp scampi pasta. Horribly great and bland. I was very disappointed. I didn't make my server take it back because I already did that with my lemonade. I didn't want to be a jerk of a customer but I should have since I paid for food I didn't even eat 1/4 of. I won't return."
Natasha S.,"Houston, TX",2,7,,1.0,5/4/2014,"Horrible experience. The wait time was estimated at 30min, we ended up waiting for about an hour.  Once seated we ordered appetizers, they took 45min to bring out lettuce wraps. Before the appetizers arrived we ordered our meal, my daughter ordered mini burgers (the lettuce was completely wilted). I would have been embarrassed to bring that out of the kitchen.  They brought 1 of the two pizzas we ordered and it was completely wrong!  The other pizza came out shortly and it was so mushy on the inside(undercooked).  30min later they brought out the correct pizza.  With all these complications the waiter was very polite but the other service and the quality of food was beyond poor.  We eat out at least 12 times a week and this new restaurant is down the street from my home, unfortunately we will not return."
Julie Z.,"Katy, TX",0,22,,2.0,6/8/2014,"It was a 30 minute wait but told we could eat at the bar.  So we found two stools and was greeted immediately.  When my husband asked what the seasonal beers were, he was told a list of 6-7.  I asked for raspberry iced tea.  He asked if I wanted it sweetened.  I told him it was on the menu as a fountain drink....he told me I was wrong, they didn't have it.  He came back with the iced tea that was on the menu and told my husband they were out of the beer he wanted.   I asked specific questions about the menu.  He couldn't answer them.  Told me the kitchen changes things all the time.  Didn't bother to go ask anyone my questions.  So I ordered the fish and chips.  Big mistake.  Completely covered in grease and batter so thick, you couldn't taste the fish.  Took two bites and didn't eat the rest.  He came over and asked if I wanted him to remove the plate, never asking if it was ok.  Saw the plate was full but charged me anyways.  I had a coupon for $10 off, with my rewards number on it.  Told me it went through but when I looked at my receipt, he never put my number in.  Talked to the manager, he didn't seem to care about any of this.  Told me if anything was wrong next time to ask for him.  How about you fix this time????? Disappointed big time, as we went to BJ's in CA all the time when we lived there.  Maybe they need more time?"
Josiah M.,"Houston, TX",4,1,1,4.0,11/23/2014,"My server  was wonderful. She was light on her  feet. My friends  food was ok.  and my order  came as I ordered  it.  the vibes in the FOH, was chill  like a giant BWW...  All in all the trip was worth it. And I Will be back."
Samantha M.,"Katy, TX",53,47,10,2.0,3/11/2015,At 447 my friend and I came to eat we walked in and we were not greeted... The hostess and a waiter were sitting there talking.... We were standing there for like two minutes before they stopped talking and asked us how many.... Super rude... The service was ok. I think the waitress was fighting with her bf or something. Mean then nice we never knew which mood she would be in.... The food was amazing like always that the only reason we still come here.
Aneela Q.,"Katy, TX",2,9,1,1.0,9/20/2015,"First time to this BJs. It's a fancy one. Waited 20+ minutes and they tried to fit 10 of us in a booth:( when we protested they said it will be another 20-25 minutes even though we could see empty tables that could fit us. When we asked about those they said they were reserved. My husband got mad so they seated us. Food came super late and was cold. We ordered two medium pizzas and they brought us 4 small without explaining, when we asked they said it's more pizza. We ordered calamari as an appetizer. My daughter had a stomach ache after that and could not eat her entree' which she ordered. French fries were super cold and we asked for hot ones, the server brought some and dropped them onto my daughters plate. Very rude waiters and servers as well as front end people. I woke up with stomach ache and diarrhea in the middle of the night. Will never go there again. TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE!"
Jeremy T.,"Katy, TX",2,26,8,2.0,8/16/2014,"Sad when a brewhouse is out of the two beers which caught my attention.  Service was o.k., slow at times, waitress had too many tables but she was friendly when she was around. Food was not very good the ""Texas Country Fried Steak"" is nothing like the Texas fried steaks I know. If your gonna name it that it better deliver and it did not.  Subpar night probably will not return, shame as it could be awesome."
Monica A.,"Houston, TX",36,227,41,1.0,7/2/2014,"The place is very nicely laid out, the service on the other hand sucks. We ordered pizza and salad but really how long does a salad take. My lunch was taken to go! To be fair we had shrimp wraps and sliders but yea, 45 minutes later and no salad.  They had no problem bringing the check quickly"
Marcus B.,"Katy, TX",50,28,5,5.0,4/25/2014,"Well, I've found my new favorite place! The pizza is INCREDIBLE. The prices are right also. I like the atmosphere as well."
