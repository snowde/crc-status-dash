Pete O.,"Katy, TX",1,60,,3.0,7/11/2014,Good selection of well kept beers  Good looking choice of food on menu At 16:00 on a Thursday afternoon there were quite a few customers and loads of staff. Not noisy- easy to hold conversation at normal voice level (Longhorn Steakhouse next door had only 25% of the number of vehicles parked up compared to BJ's) Had to wait a little while for waiter (Vaughan) after we had taken our seats but afterwards he was very attentive Food is ok- perhaps not as attractive as it reads on the menu-but we agreed it was tasty. Not overly large portion but sufficient- no doggy bag required! One negative: the roast potatoes are horrible!! Chef should be ashamed that the kitchen could not produce better roasties No expresso or cappuccino coffee available to round off our meal- pity
Kat K.,"Katy, TX",0,7,,1.0,6/17/2015,"My kids are home from college and we all chose BJs.  It took FOREVER to get our table cleaned off. Then it took FOREVER to get drinks.  My son wanted a coke but they said they only had Pepsi ????  At the bar do you serve Jack and Pepsi ?????  When he finally received his Pepsi it tasted like diet.  Omgosh it took the waiter FOREVER!!!  I finally went to the bar and asked for one.  We placed our order (stupid us).  My daughter tasted her water and asked my husband to taste it and it tasted like crap!!!  Really the water????  Did I mention the waiters white shirt?  It was gross!!!   Black around the cuffs and gross stains.  Ewe...,.an hour later after everyone around us has had their salads and entrees we FINALLY get our food.  The manager knows and he comes out to apologize.  We were past words.   When we first came in we were talking about ordering Pazookie but Omgosh  that would of taken until midnight.  Holy crap. Never ever ever again!!!!! I tried to send this with ""0"" stars but it would not let me."
Curtis S.,"Katy, TX",18,8,,1.0,10/29/2014,Tried this place tonight for the first (and last ) time. The service was the worst and the food was not much better. There are plenty of better places to eat in Katy. Pass this place up!!! If you don't you will wish you had.
Corey H.,"Austin, TX",0,3,,5.0,6/26/2014,"BJ's did a great job of handling a huge crowd for the US v Germany World Cup game at lunch today.  A storm knocked out the satellite feed at the beginning of the game, but the manager kept his cool and got it going ASAP.  Great service and excellent food!"
M B.,"Katy, TX",0,1,1,1.0,9/28/2014,This place is horrible!!  Our appetizers came out fine. The soup was cold and when I said something about it to the person who brought it out she had an attitude!!  Then our meal took over an hour to come out!!!  I should have known better when while waiting for our tables I witnessed another customer complaining and leaving.
L D.,"Washington, DC",2,94,14,3.0,8/29/2014,"The waiter was very, very nice but the food was just mediocre. On the kids side salad, it was really just shredded iceberg lettuce with a side of dressing and part of a chopped up tomato. My small hand tossed pizza was actually a mis-shaped thin crust pizza. I had stuffed mushrooms as an appetizer. That was also just so-so.  Overall, the food was passable but the service was great. The waiter came by several times to be sure we were okay. Another waiter came over and immediately took our drink orders. Because we needed several minutes to decide what to order, we went past the happy hour deadline. However, the waiter allowed us to received a happy hour rate anyway. Good thing. I would've hated to have payed full price for mediocrity!"
Caroline K.,"Katy, TX",0,11,,1.0,9/11/2014,"Not a fan! We had a party of 3 adults.  Ordered the top shelf margaritas, I don't think any alcohol was added. All you tasted was the mix, sent the drinks back. Only to get more of the same.  The food was bland and not very tasty. The waitress was nice, but disappeared often and we had to ask other waiters to fill our water glasses.  Will not be going back again.  For a new place they need to step up their game and the quality.  Plenty of other good restaurants to go to."
Mark M.,"Richmond, TX",0,37,1,1.0,9/17/2014,"We went for lunch around 145pm to avoid the crowd.  Seating was quick since it wasn't that busy.  It took the waiter almost 10 minutes to acknowledge us.  When he approached I told him I'd like a taste of each of the two featured beers.  He returned almost 10 minutes later with two glasses.  One had lipstick on it so I asked for a taste in a clean glass.  He took it away and returned a couple minutes later.  When I looked at he glass it was clear that he had only wiped the lipstick off and not obtained a new glass.  He returned to take our lunch order and asked if I wanted one of the beers.  I ordered one of them.  Our salads arrived, and then sometime later the waiter showed up to set the pizza stand on the table.  The pizza showed up, still no beer. It's not like the place was busy but it was clear the guy wasn't tracking on his job.  Too bad, I was looking forward to beer and pizza.  Not coming back - this isn't the first time!!"
NC K.,"Houston, TX",0,34,4,1.0,5/13/2015,"The service is going down the drain. I have ordered here several times and serve gets worse with every visit. I called ahead of time for take out. The lady quoted 10-15 minutes, so I got there in about 15 minutes. This place wasn't busy at all and I wait 5-7 minutes just for someone to greet me. There were 2 employees and the manager standing right in front of me and the manager had to tell the girl to help me!! Why the manager has to tell you to say hello and take care of me is beyond me. I waited 10-15 just for my food to come out and it was cold. A girl was coming in on her shift and greeted me, she said she was going to go get my food and didn't return for over 10 minutes. I would have liked for her to have gotten my payment in the mean time even if the food wasn't ready yet bc its more efficient that way. She never came back to tell me it'll be a few more minutes. This won't be a go to place for me anymore. Its like customer service isn't important in sit down restaurants anymore."
Michael C.,"Cambridge, MA",0,47,2,2.0,7/12/2014,"Solid 4 / 4.5 concept, but this location's service is terrible.  Kitchen messes up orders, we had to have one of our dishes remade 3 times and the other twice before we ordered (how hard is it to leave olives off pizza?) and our waters were never refilled. Go to a different BJ's if you can. Hope BJ's management replaces this GM asap."
Linda B.,"Katy, TX",7,3,5,2.0,6/18/2014,Came here for lunch with a group of 10 and the service was questionable.  We tried to order in advance to save time but they didnt accept that.  We tried to make reservations and was told they cant take reservations over six people.  I think they're in need of training.  The waiter was kind of rude in his responses.
B L.,"Houston, TX",0,5,3,2.0,1/15/2015,Ordered BJ's Brewhouse burger on wheat.  What I got back reminded me when we ran out of buns at home.  Instead of wheat buns I got regular sliced wheat bread.  Waitress did offer to replace but with regular buns.  Boo & no sweet potato fries.
Rashelle G.,"Abilene, TX",0,22,4,3.0,7/23/2014,"I had a very similar experience to Stuart, however mine was at 11 a.m. on a Wednesday and my nephew and I were the first two customers to enter the establishment. The main hostess (H1) yelled at another hostess (H2) who was in the 'to go' area to take us to our seats. The H2 said no, so the asked a server to seat us and H2 argued with H1 before finally taking us to our seats with the fakest smile ever. We sat for over 5 min watching a gaggle of servers (about 12 of them) shooting the breeze over in the bar area; mind you we are still the only ones there. A server finally comes up to take our order, I order a water with lemon and my nephew ordered a BJs root beer. The server brought the water, no lemon and told us the didn't have root beer, so he ordered something else. She brought his orange cream soda and them another 5 min later she brought a small plate with two lemons. Another server came and said that they were going to be taking care of us, but still don't know who our server was supposed to be. Our food came with no issue and was delicious so no complaints there. Before we finished our meal I asked our new server to speak to a manager, and he was at out table within 3 minutes. He asked what he could help me with, and have him a quick rundown of our experience and apologized because 1-they DO HAVE root beer, so he brought one and 2- the hostess' actions and behavior were unacceptable. I stressed that both servers were extremely polite and I understood that we weren't their table to work. He offered my nephew a pizookie for free and took off the cost of his meal. I appreciate the attentiveness of the manger and his willingness to make things right. I sincerely hope they take this experience as an opportunity to train the hostess and servers on how to make the guests feel welcome instead of a burden."
Theresa P.,"Glidden, TX",0,7,,1.0,12/28/2014,Very disappointed. Really looked forward to eating here when it opened. The food was horrible. Will not be going back.
Matt A.,"Houston, TX",1,13,,2.0,11/21/2014,"I been thinking of writing the review from my visit back in July, but never get chance to, so here I am. We were used to service from other BJs in california. The service was terrible with long wait in this location. The value for the meal has gone down. They have cut down on the bread that used to be served earlier. It was a total waste of our visit to this location. This restaurant is OFF of your list."
Wendy T.,"Houston, TX",0,7,,5.0,8/1/2014,FINALLY! we always have bad luck with food and going out. But this was the first time in a LONG time that we got good service and good food. Yes the wait kind stinks but when we were finally seated everything was awesome. The server gave his recommendations(very thankful he did). I ordered a steak and it came out perfect. At the end we called the manager over just to say thank you. We'll definitely be back. We'll also be asking for the same server too. Thanks!
Kelli B.,"Houston, TX",0,33,8,2.0,7/9/2014,"The call ahead seating is useless. I was quoted a 45 minute wait then had to wait an additional 45 minutes once we arrived. Several people were seated before us even though we arrived first. There was only 2 of us. I had to remind the hostess we were waiting and she hit the ""arrive"" button on her screen next to my name. Did she just forget to do it the first time when we truly arrived? Once we were seated it took about 5 minutes before we were acknowledged. Gave our drink and app order and waited several minutes for that. The waiter finally came with our drinks and said the bar was on an 8 minute wait. Got the salad but no silverware. Then finally got the appetizer.  Food was great but experience sucked. No plans on returning."
Katie B.,"Katy, TX",0,21,,2.0,10/11/2014,i love BJ's and this location makes me hate it :( food always seems as if it's been sitting there forever..before it gets to my table. the service is slow. even just for drinks. good luck getting a buzz..they rarely come back to your table :(
Lynda T.,"League City, TX",0,14,,2.0,9/27/2014,"It's great if you want your burgers well done, well done or well done. If you want them medium or rare, you're out of luck. Also the lettuce and tomatoes on the burgers were soggy."
Rebeca M.,"Katy, TX",89,12,4,1.0,7/3/2014,"I have had the worst dining experience of my life. This place is terrible, I would not recommend it to anyone. The hostesses are all rude and very unprofessional. I had a party of 7 and waited for an hour for a table, they texted us at 8:40, we got to the host stand by 8:46 since we were waiting in line to show them our txt and they had given our table away. Calette was completely rude and as soon as we told her we needed to speak to a manager she tried to change her attitude. The manager, by the name of Bri was even worst than the hostess was, he was incompetent and did not even apologize for the inconvenience, he said that their ""window"" was 5 minutes and they gave the table away, didn't even say they would try to get us another table, NOTHING, u can tell this guy has no idea what good customer service should be, they must have been very desperate to give him a managing position. After finally getting sat, I ordered a spinach dip as a meal, which never came and the waiter simply said ""it was never made"" after half of my party was done with their meal...my friend ordered a medium rare steak which was completely burned, and another one of my friends ordered a hamburger with the bun being hard rock. The waiter, Andrew was completely careless about the situation & just said he was going to call his manager...Bri once again came by and when he was told what happened with our food and that we wanted to cancel the spinach dip and the burger, he simply said ""ok"", didn't offer anything, apologized, once again, NOTHING. Worst experience ever!"
