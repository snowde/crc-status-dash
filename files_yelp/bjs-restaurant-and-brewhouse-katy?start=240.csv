Candess M.,"Houston, TX",0,48,1,5.0,7/31/2014,"BJs always has wonderful food and service. If you eat their often and remember old menu items, they will usually accommodate you. We are fans of the off menu cheeseburger deep dish pizza, and were sad it was left off the menu. The visiting restaurant manager, a charming man from Austin, made our visit memorable and great when they honored our request for the pizza. The handmade cream soda is also a staple I any great meal there :-)"
