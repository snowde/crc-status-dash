Tommy N.,"New York, NY",154,98,237,1.0,9/6/2015,"Not a great experience. I've been here the times and service has been a hit and miss. During my most recent visit, the restaurant managed to lose my call ahead reservation; the waitress was extremely rude; we only stopped by for desert (pizookie), so she did not pay attention to us or bother refill our drinks - we most likely weren't attended to because we did not have a high-yield order; in addition, they managed to get our one order wrong.  This is a shame, because the food here has great potential. I'm not sure if I'll return."
Quake E.,"Pearland, TX",0,7,5,1.0,11/11/2016,"On my visit to the Katy location (20536 Katy Freeway) on 10/31/2016, the burger came out very dark on the outside from the grill and it tasted very bad.  The order was processed again and I got it right the second time.  On my second burger, I found a metal silky thing inside the burger .  I told the waiter and showed her the metal part, the managers stopped by my table, saw the part, since I wanted to keep the part he took a picture of it.  The manager explained that it's likely that the part fell from the grill cleaning brush into the burger!  He of course waived my check, but I am extremely disappointed as I am not expecting that to happen at BJ!  I do have pictures if anyone is interested to see them... A year ago at BJ Willowbrook (Northwest Houston) location, I found a piece of a broken plate inside my pasta. It looks like this company is having issues with the quality of service and food."
Brianna E.,"Katy, TX",183,6,7,2.0,12/25/2016,"The wait for the food was ridiculous! The server said she ""forgot"" our requests! The pazookie was burnt beyond recognition and all of the toppings that were pictured were not served! First and last time eating here!"
Shourjo D.,"Katy, TX",63,35,3,2.0,4/22/2016,There's a lot that went wrong.  But plz just take a look at the charge for a side of broccoli and the amount of said broccoli.
Nicole S.,"Katy, TX",0,3,,1.0,4/1/2017,"Called ahead to see if we can make reservation for party of 7.  Recording said you could make reservations for 7 or more but once I spoke to the hostess she said I couldn't.   Went in Friday were seated in about 30 min...not to bad for a Friday.    Our server had no personality, took about 25-20 to get our drinks.   Once we ordered our food took another 45 min to get it, waiter forgot to order on of our entrees & it took another 30 min to come.   The food was room temperature & not tasty at all. .  Good thing in the server took the entree off of our bill that he forgot."
Jennifer H.,"Katy, TX",112,119,672,2.0,7/24/2015,I don't think I'll be coming back here anymore. After dining here a good amount I can conclude the best items on their menu are their appetizers. Service is usually a miss. I suggest you sit at the bar if you want any service. Their root beer bloat and orange cream soda are still the best I've found this far.
Marie M.,"Houston, TX",1,41,4,2.0,7/23/2017,Waited until trying this place for a 2nd time before rating. Went to Katy location as well as Sugar Land.  Both were mediocre....like I won't go back. The restaurant as a whole is ok. The building is nice and all but the food is a waste of time. Tried one of the pizza rolls the first time and baked ziti next time. Both were not good. And the waiter wasn't good either. Not a place I need to visit again.
M M.,"Houston, TX",0,13,7,1.0,7/22/2017,"Horrible food horrible service! Came here twice. The first time the food took over an hour to come and when it finally did, the waiter dropped it (so took about another hour to remake it)!! We came here again tonight just for a pizookie and it was burnt!! They can't even get their specialty dessert right. So disappointed!! I would highly not recommend this location!!"
Usha M.,"Katy, TX",12,23,25,5.0,2/18/2017,"We went in a Saturday night so it was crowded.  But we got seated a lot sooner than the 40 to 50 minute wait time.  While we were waiting they brought us cheese pizza to sample which was delicious.  They had plenty of vegetarian options and several of their entries can be made with vegitarian substitutions.  We got their soba noodles with out the chicken, and it tasted good.  Great atmosphere for a Saturday night."
Shaunte'y S.,"Houston, TX",1,6,,3.0,7/20/2017,"As usual food was good service was great, dessert was awesome. The waitress was sweet and accommodating although messed up at the end. While the mistake was not an issue my rewards were unknowingly used to rectify and it was made to seem like a kind gesture."
Frances L.,"Katy, TX",0,1,,2.0,8/12/2017,"Well folks the bloom is off the rose.  We just left BJ's and we put this eatery in the ""Slap me upside the head for suggesting this place"" category. The avocado egg roll was pitiful.  I had to send my fish and chips back because  it  had grease pooling on the crust. The oil was old and dark and clearly should have been tossed.  Our waitress apologized and asked if I wanted something else. I declined her offer to order something else. The manager NEVER came to our table but I wasn't shocked because I've never seen a manager the other times I've been here.  I guess they are doing so well that they don't care if you had lousy food.  See ya BJ's!!!"
Janet M.,"Katy, TX",0,8,,4.0,8/10/2017,"Appetizers are great! Service is good, although sometimes it takes a while getting your ticket when your ready to leave. Love the deep dish pizza!!!!!"
Chang W.,"Katy, TX",20,45,75,2.0,6/18/2015,I went durring a service lul.  I was hoping that I would get good service and good food.  I remembered how good the food was a couple years ago when I visited the Sugarland location. Much to my surprise the food was bla.  Its not like it was.  What has gone on here?  I know its a newer location but come on..... I seriously felt like a group of toddlers made my meal with an easy bake oven. The pizza tasted pre-made and reheated.  Ragu sauce and lousy toppings.   The signature crusted chicken was soggy and tasteless. The tea tasted like the container. For $47and what I remember this location has a long way to go.
Helen C.,"Conroe, TX",3,1,,5.0,2/24/2017,"I ate at this place for the very first time today and I would definitely go again. I have seen some reviews where the fish is greasy, this just proves to me try it yourself and don't believe everything people say. The food was great, I was within a time frame of 1 hour lunch so I wasn't late returning and the service was excellent! Great atmosphere and every one was so nice. If you want the same experience I had today request to sit in a short girls area with glasses, I think her name was Kayla, just the sweetest little girl so polite and eager to please! Thank you Kayla! My apologies if I am misspelling your name, hopefully you will get the customers you deserve!"
Tiffany Q.,"Houston, TX",205,9,15,4.0,12/6/2015,"The only bothersome event of the evening was our drink service. While it took a little longer than expected, my friend and I were patient. The issue came when the two males I was sitting with were assumed the drink that I was actually having. As if a woman can't drink a porter.  Sexism is alive in America and while it's not worth complaining, I was disheartened because my experience was delightful otherwise. A large menu (okay a problem because everything was and is delicious) and nice staff, even with sexist assumptions.  I'll come here and just possibly be snarky about my drinks next time."
Kristine C.,"Katy, TX",9,59,23,5.0,12/30/2016,Good iced tea. My husband said the ancient lentil soup was very good. Fast and pleasant service. This is actually our second visit to this location and the food was very good and service was very good. Ahi tuna salad fresh and crisp. Fish tacos were good.
Tish P.,"Houston, TX",907,408,1021,3.0,4/21/2014,"This is the 3rd BJ's I've ever been to and definitely the best experience yet....probably because the only thing I paid was a tip.  I told y'all free food is always good food (ok not always - see another BJ's review on the Sugar Land location). Came here on their dress rehearsal free meals for a cause.  I ordered the orange cream soda.  Frankly, I found it utterly disgusting, tasted like soap to me.  We all split the pulled pork sammich, 5 meat pizza, shrimp tacos, and shrimp/chicken fettucini pasta dish.  The food was OK, nothing rave worthy.  I will say I enjoyed the pizza much more at this location than the aforementioned SL one.  So s/o to Katy BJ's for making me KINDA see what the rave is about. We topped the meal off with the pizookie trio with the double chocolate, white chocolate macadamia and the salted caramel...I would say the macadamia was the best of the 3!  Good dessert but I have a sweet tooth that won't quit so it doesn't take much. I think BJ's is a cool spot with the full bar and big screen TVs but their food has always needed work to me.  The service was extra nice, as expected for a new establishment..."
Alexander W.,"Houston, TX",999,708,5699,3.0,4/16/2014,"This is a chain restaurant.  Maybe because I am a non drinker, I cannot rate this place higher than 3 stars.  I would like to, but there isn't anything truly outstanding about the food.   Because I part of the electronic rewards program, I got an invitation in the mail asking me to try out their new location quite close to my house.  Your only options were either lunch or dinner time slots, and by the time I called, only lunch time was available.  They said bring 3 guests, so I hit up my fellow yelpers that work in the Katy area.  Latisha P., Janine A and Shawn S. were the guinea pigs with me! This place is very nicely decorated with many screens that were turned to sports.  They told me that since it is a family environment, they will not show fighting pay per views in the establishment.  Since the place has yet to be open to the public, the place is obviously extremely clean. We are there to make sure the waiters can handle the Katy rush that happens whenever a new restaurant opens its doors.  We had a preselected menu and we all shared the dishes.  For lunch was a small gourmet five meat pizza with added chicken for a 6 meat dish.  Next were seafood tacos, then Cajun pasta with shrimp added and then a BBQ pulled pork sandwich.  They even had a Pizookie trio for desert. All in all, the food was just okay.  The pizza wasn't outstanding, the pasta could have used seasoning in the actual pasta and not so much along the side of the plate for decoration, and the tacos were just tacos to me.  The BBQ pulled pork sandwich was slightly tasty, but nothing to write to yelp about...even though I just did.  The dessert trio was tasty, but I am a sugar fiend so that does not count.  Even my orange cream soda was just okay.  One person said it taste like soap, and asked for another carbonated beverage instead. I heard that their wings are really good, so one day I will go get some from them.  All in all, looking at the amount of money we would have paid for this meal, I don't think the portion size and value is worth that type of money.  I do know that you should sign up for their e-club and wait for food deals to come to your email to ensure a fair value for average food.  Give them a try, but don't have your expectations too high...it is a chain restaurant."
paul b.,"Lamplight Village, Austin, TX",0,8,24,1.0,4/23/2016,"Mediocre food and service. The food quality at BJs has gone way down from where it was years ago. This location in particular has sketchy service and inconsistent food.  Our visit included lack of service from the waitress, double charges on our bill and a 3 dollar charge for 2 oz of broccoli."
Don C.,"Jersey Village, TX",124,547,278,4.0,4/19/2015,I love the Hefeweizen and the food is good- ok maybe a tad pricey but I haven't had anything I didn't enjoy here- great appetizers too.
