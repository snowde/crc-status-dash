Daniel K.,"Imperial Beach, CA",271,7,4,3.0,7/18/2017,"I called the GM. The GM Mike was professional and prompt in his response in hearing my disappointment by the restaurant's service during a special family moment. I feel that the GM listens to the customer. The GM offered to comp my bill and a gift certificate to try the restaurant again. I am a bit hesitant, but the professional demeanor and handling of my situation by the GM made me change my mind about the restaurant. I got the impression that the GM really cares about the customers in the professional actions taken to listen and resolve my situation while off the clock and handling personal matters. I felt that I, as a customer still came first. I intend to try the BJ's restaurant again and will update the review."
Tyler L.,"Katy, TX",136,53,49,3.0,3/11/2016,"In the beginning I really liked Bjs. I ordered the Santa Fe salad, and it was good. Just good. After dining here over the past couple months, either my taste buds are boring or their food is not as good as the hype. And my taste buds have been around with some good grub.  The menu is huge, and overwhelming.. But if you like options, this is the place to go to! Not everyone likes salads, so I'm going to go by my recent experience with their avocado burger. It was awful. I really wanted to like this place, because it looked cool and unique, but the avocado burger was sloppy, soggy, flavorless, and packed with way too much avocado (is that even possible?!). Go next door to uncle julios, or grab some wings... Bjs does have nice wings and deep dishes."
Brandon B.,"Katy, TX",119,43,2,2.0,1/12/2017,"Over priced mediocre food, they suck you in with a great atmosphere, and serve you low quality food for too much money. Never coming back."
Michael W.,"Houston, TX",25,58,42,4.0,8/29/2015,The jalepeno burger add bacon and avocado. That's enough. Worth mention: Hot Wings. The California flatbread pizza. The flatbread pepperoni.
Daniel K.,"Rosenberg, TX",0,13,,4.0,3/26/2017,"Below is our old review... had a bad time that evening, however today was very different. We heard from Mike the GM after our last review, he sent us a gift card and asked us to try again. Well today was great! Hostesses were great, server was great and the food was awesome! We will be back... thank you! OLD REVIEW:Very disappointed with the hostess staff tonight. They forgot about us which wasn't necessarily that upsetting. When they did seat us the young lady explained that it wasn't her fault that I didn't put our name in I explained I had and she proceeded to throw our menus down and get angry. I don't work all week to go to a restaurant and spend hard earned money to be treated like crap. We promptly left and won't return. Shame on you for your poor service..."
Fast H.,"Richmond, TX",3,23,50,4.0,3/4/2016,My wife and I like this place and have been here several times. She really enjoys the pizza and I enjoy the variety. We both enjoy the homemade beers.  Have never had a bad experience.
Ravi K.,"Houston, TX",0,35,,4.0,5/4/2017,"Great food. Great service and great beer. We go there a lot. I would recommend this as one of the better BJ's. I have been to some other locations where the food has disappointed. However, this location the food is consistently good."
Ma S.,"Houston, TX",202,171,336,4.0,1/19/2016,"I don't think I quite understand why this place has such little stars. I'm going to go ahead and give it four stars!  I've been to this particular location about three times now. I first came to this location for a business lunch. Great place quick service and definitely a lot to choose from. They even have a healthy menu option. They have a lunch menu and a dinner menu which helps with portion control. They have a wide range of both entrées and appetizers. When I say full range I'm talking about items from Pizzas, burgers, stirfry, fish etc.There's definitely something here for everybody to choose from!  I have tried the quinoa salmon bowl and it is absolutely delicious. This comes in both lunch and dinner portion. The pizza is also delicious. The appetizer platter is very big and in fact you will have leftovers. The service is excellent, I could not ask for much better service than this. The servers are very knowledgeable about the menu and can make great recommendations! The venue is open late, and it is a very good atmosphere for either business or fun!  I highly recommend this place and Will definitely be going back on a regular!"
Kyle C.,"San Jose, CA",74,13,4,1.0,7/29/2016,Horrible Management and everything in the restaurant is dirty (Silverware Tables Menus Floors etc.) Food takes forever to come out. Don't leave anything in your car unless you want it to be broken into.
Tracy R.,"Katy, TX",331,13,21,3.0,4/23/2016,Friendly environment food was good I had the Mahi fish and shrimp with rice instead of couscous the pink Cadillac drink was delicious!!
Monica B.,"Houston, TX",128,52,13,4.0,1/22/2016,"Went here late one Friday night after a long week of work in need of good food and libations. I most certainly left satisfied.  We were seated immediately even though it was a Friday night. After getting our drink order, the waitress was very informative and gave us great information about the menu items and helped us make our selections.  I ordered the Ahi Tuna Salad, and the tuna was seared rare perfectly. I also ordered one of their pizookies. It's a pie/cookie creation with ice cream on top, and although I'm sure it gave me diabetes, it was delicious and totally worth it.  The atmosphere here definitely makes it a great date spot, and the staff is super friendly. Even if you've eaten at other BJs locations, I absolutely recommend you give this one a try!"
Meghan W.,"Houston, TX",126,2,1,5.0,8/9/2016,Great Bar staff! Jay and coworker were awesome. Kept those drinks flowing with that Tuesday wine special
Kevin T.,"Alleyton, TX",0,2,,1.0,9/23/2017,"Seriously they have definitely gone downhill. Ordered the Pot Stickers and when they arrived they were barely warm and the last  be was actually cold. Had a small Buffalo Chicken pizza and asked for the celery on the side as my wife doesn't care for celery. Saw a guy with a pizza walking all over the place, even walked right past us then returned back to us with the pizza he was walking all over the place. Again is was barely warm and when he walked away he said he was going to get the celery. He never brought it to us. Ordered a Porter beer and a pizokie (sp)? The beer came out but not dessert until I was almost 2/3s finished with the beer and yes I was sipping the beer not chugging it. Asked for a box to go for the 3 pieces of pizza left and asked for some ranch dressing to go for it. No problem we were told, got the box and no ranch. The company needs to figure out what's going on at this place or is it at all of them?"
Kylie M.,"Katy, TX",0,2,,1.0,9/9/2017,"awful fucking service been sitting here for an hour and a half, and a kid threw up and they didn't even disinfect the seat, they just wiped it. disgusting"
Johnny P.,"Houston, TX",6,29,7,4.0,2/21/2016,"Great place, good food and better beer ! TATONKA STOUT w/nitro is my ""necessary"", others are good but this one brew DOES better  . Good burger, so far all waitstaff have been super. BJ's is good to go to ..."
Brandon T.,"Katy, TX",2,31,20,1.0,12/10/2015,"Another Bust! The service & food has rapidly declined recently. One plate was prepared wrong, the second was served cold. Our refills came with more liquid but never any ice. The table & seats were dirty and obviously overlooked for days. I highly recommend another establishment close bye, many are around with much better options."
Lana O.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,19,9,1.0,3/17/2017,"We've been here 3 times, third times the charm! And still is terrible... where is the service? We sit at the bar and the bartenders are way too interested in their social life or servers at the well.  Manager walks around (older gentleman, bald) and can clearly see tables are upset yet-lack of awareness or concern."
Jada L.,"Katy, TX",0,5,,1.0,10/14/2016,"Service was horrible... food sub par First of all, the waiter got my order completely wrong. By the time I got my food, everyone else was done eating and it was still wrong and the waiter didn't even apologize. It took forever to get refills or drinks from the bar and it wasn't even crowded. The waiter left all the plates from the appetizer on the table throughout dinner. This was the first time eating there and I won't go back in the future."
Jeremy L.,"Richmond, TX",1,90,14,2.0,1/16/2016,Soo had no wait 5 star Great app 5 star  Asked for marinara sauce  on pizza extra even didn't get it got some green  sauce zero start Pizza came without a spatula to serve zero star Pizza was not cut all the way zero star Spoke with manager he got a new pizza on the works  Came out again with extra green sauce not the marinara  Told manager that was what the problem was again didn't seem to care Triple pazuki to the table 5 star 47.24 dollars waiting and getting it wrong Plus 6.55 tip  53.80  That being  said the server was nice friendly  and polite
Todd Z.,"Houston, TX",36,15,2,4.0,2/25/2015,"This place is consistent if anything. Always good food. Great beer. Good public atmosphere. Service is normally on par. Busy nights will leave you left alone for a while. But this place does get busy! Even with a big parking lot they can get packed.  Get here at the right time, between 5-630pm and you'll be seated right away. After 630 it can get dicey. If it's a 15-20 min wait, worth it.  Try the pazookie. It's just ice cream on a giant cookie but MAN it's good!"
