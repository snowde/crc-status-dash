Adam S.,"Katy, TX",174,447,603,3.0,12/6/2014,"BJs is another sports bar that is trying to redefine itself as a restaurant, but coming up a bit short.  Great appetizers, desserts and beer.  Main courses are ok. Other Yelpers are right on about this being a chain restaurant.  Not all chains are the same, though.  Houston-based chains such as Landry's/Pappas/Ninfa's are very popular and delicious.  National chains such as BJs don't quite hit the same quality mark.  Houston definitely knows good food. Anyway, I came to BJs for my birthday dinner with the family.  It was Black Friday and the place was very busy.  We only had to wait about 15 minutes, which was nice. We had a booth near the bar area and started with the fried artichokes and spinach/artichoke dip.  The fried artichokes were very tasty...would definitely order them again.  The spinach/artichoke dip was ok...have had better. I ordered a Tatonka stout beer.  This was a tasty stout...slightly sweet, and full-bodied.   I would definitely order one again.  The porter also looks good.  BJs has a good list of beers...they brew almost every type of beer you can think of. BJs has a fairly large menu...many types of burgers, pizza, and pasta.  I ordered a sirloin steak medium-rare, but it came out medium-well.  They fixed the order, but when I received a better steak, my wife and daughter were almost done with their meals.  The seasoning on the steak was good, but the meat quality could have been better for the price.  The steak was probably a 6-ounce cut.  I also had a wedge salad with the steak that was tasty, but the wedge was very small, probably a third of the size of a normal wedge. My wife and daughter liked their entrees of Mediterranean Chicken Tacos and Grilled Chicken Alfredo, but again nothing special about the taste.  The Alfredo portion size was large, and we had leftovers to take home. We tried the Pizookie Trio for dessert, which is basically a cookie with a large scoop of ice cream on top.  Three cookies are served with the trio (duh!).  The Pizookie is a must-have.  My daughter and I liked the macadamia nut cookie and my wife enjoyed the peanut butter cookie.  BJs packaged-up our desserts to take back home. Service was ok.  We had to wait a bit at times, but overall was not bad.  With tip, we spent about $30 a person overall.  A bit high for what we received. I am not itching to rush back to BJs, but when we do visit again, I will definitely have an appetizer, a pizookie, and a beer.  If I have an entree, I will probably try a burger."
Jessica P.,"Katy, TX",1,4,,3.0,1/29/2017,"The food is good, but whoever Kaila is, she sucks as a server. We were seated right away, but had to wait for 15 mins and our server didn't show up. Someone else had to pick up our order."
Michelle C.,"Houston, TX",173,17,9,1.0,5/31/2014,"First time at Bjs, and probably will be my last. Waited 30 mins for a table for a party of 2 just to find out the whole back section of the restaurant was empty. But they had to wait to seat customers because their staffs can't handle more than couple tables at a time. Really?? Then a waitress came over and told us she wasn't our waitress but she would take our drink orders. Waited 15 mins so she could come back and tell us "" I guess your waiter isn't coming, I'll just take your order""!!!?? What?? So much for team work. This restaurant needs to get their s### together! So unorganized, staff are not experienced, very unprofessional! I really wanted to like it.  Oh well."
Tam M.,"Missouri City, TX",358,583,613,4.0,7/22/2014,"In the words of BJ's ""Wow, I love this place!"" is most certainly a true statement from my experience here!  I've been to BJ's before and knew they had an extensive menu--perfect for various taste and ages, but I still like to do my research before I take people out. Perusing the yelp reviews, BJ's had an average middle of the road rating. Basically, hit or miss.  Since this place is relatively new, I decided to give it a shot. So glad BJ's was a hit!  Our party of six arrived around 3 pm on a Saturday.  Parking lot was packed, so I decided to get out and see if there was a long wait for a table.  Wasn't a wait at all, so me, Mom, and my four nieces ranging from 4 to 14 piled out the car to get our eat on!  We were lead to a spacious corner of the restaurant that had a round table--perfect for me to keep an eye on the teeny tots and to keep them out of people's way since we had the adults on both ends of the booth. Of course, they had their moments crawling on the floor under the booth trying to recover crayons, but pretty mild behavior.  Once more, my teenage niece was able to watch all the sports to her heart's content on the many screens around the building. So far so good! As far as the food goes--I would advise anyone knowing that they are going to dine here to look at the menu online   so you won't be puzzled as to what to get.  I will say that I would pass on the spinach and artichoke dip--I've tasted better, plus it wasn't very big; split between six people  (three of them being under 10) we only had one good spoonful to share with a few chips.  Besides, your entree portion is so massive, you probably end up taking it home because you'll be full from eating the app.  Save room because the main dishes are a home run!  Mom and I decided on burgers and sandwiches respectively. She had the sliders--thick and well seasoned, cooked to her specs. Only thing is that the adult slider does not come with tomato--ask for it if you desire--no extra charge. I kind of wanting the chicken fried steak, but my experience at a different location made me apprehensive. I asked Jackie, our server,  to help me choose between it and the pulled pork sandwich. She emphatically exclaimed the latter. So glad I did! Massive bun with delicious, sweet, and moist pork lion topped with onion strings. I decided to make my sandwich even more towering and pile the crunchy coleslaw inside to experience a slew of textures for my taste buds. They were impressed--so much so that I barely ate half of the sandwich! Blame it on the fries--crunchy and golden brown with a soft interior. These fries were too delish to pass up and let get cold!   My oldest niece decided to get the Cajun pasta which has peppers in it versus the Fettuccine Alfredo. However, she did not want the tomato-based sauce. She subbed the Alfredo instead--without a charge--and still had a yummy dish with ample succulent shrimp folded into the pasta. She did ask for more Alfredo later on, but the flavors were there! Her drink selection, however, was a little of a miss. She initially decided to get the raspberry tea, but it tasted off--almost like it was going sour. Her second choice was the cream soda because they were out of regular root beer. Jackie convinced her that it was better than regular root beer, so she tried it. At first, she was excited about the new discovery, but she did not drink too much of it. I cannot recollect what her final drink selection was, but I think she would not have had to go through so much trial and error if what she really wanted was in stock.  What really impressed me was the the kids' menu. On the back of the activity page, there are three columns: main entree, side, and drink. Main entrees things such as mac and cheese, corn dogs, mini sliders, chicken tenders. Sides: fries--thin or steak fries, side salad, veggie plate, mash potatoes. We went with the chicken tenders and sliders for the kids paired with mash potatoes (one wanted cheese on hers, which was not an extra charge) and steak fries. When I saw their kids' plates, it almost looked like a meal for an adult! Way more than enough food for them to nibble on at the restaurant and for later on. Plus, the cups are too cool. They're clear plastic and come with a different neon colored straw that help the kids easily identify whose cup is whose. No more bickering on who has my cup at BJ's!!! Even though I was full, I had to make room for the pzookie!!! Chocolate chip cookie al la mode with ice cream on top!!! Only reason I shared it was because I could not eat it fast enough to keep the ice cream from softening the cookie. Everyone really enjoyed the rich and creamy taste of this desert, but  beyond the food, what really made our visit exceptional was our server Jackie. She was so attentive, punctual, and sweet. Gave her the biggest tip I can even remember giving a server because she was just that good!   A must try place in Katy!"
Homero B.,"Fulshear, TX",14,34,54,5.0,10/29/2015,"This is one of my favorite places to go.  The menu selection is quite extensive.   There is a nice selection of beers.  I usually start with a Brew House Blond and see where it goes from there.   My favorite pizza -  Gourmet Five Meat pizza with extra tomatoes , (House-made meatballs, pepperoni, oven roasted ham, smoked bacon, Italian sausage and Parmesan cheese).  The extra tomatoes so the pizza is not too dry.   Salad - The Seared Ahi Salad is pretty awesome. Appetizers - Ahi Poke, BJ's Original Chicken Wings, Crispy Calamari, Mozzarella Sticks Desert - The Pazookie, you gotta have a pazookie."
Lorena T.,"Houston, TX",196,212,574,3.0,10/6/2015,I prefer the one at Bay Area blvd.  Service is faster...and food taste better for some reason...Wont return to this location.
Kar B.,"Katy, TX",21,13,113,2.0,5/19/2014,I took my daughter here on a Monday night about 7:20 pm. It was a special night because she received an award for Honor Roll on stage at her school that night.  We were seated right away. We ordered our drinks and they came right away. But after that things got real slow. Our waitress was nice but seemed to be spread very thin. We ordered a Pizza 16' to share. It took longer than normal. This was our 3rd visit here.  The pizza was not cut all the way thru so I had to cut it myself and the cheese was falling all off the pizza and did not have much sauce at all. With as long as the pizza took we did not want to send it back because we were hungry.  I knew that would take forever to get it correct.  It took forever for our waitress to come back to our table. When she did appear  we ordered the famous pizookie for our celebration.  It seemed like the cookie was not cooked enough. Kind of raw cookie dough.   So this visit was not up to par like before. I do believe they need more help and to cook the orders correctly. We are on a schedule on a school night and it took way too long to cook a pizza and an uncooked cookie. Really. The only good thing was the ice cream.  Not feeling it here like before.
Erick J.,"Katy, TX",0,10,,2.0,5/15/2015,"First things first... I represent ""The Distinguished Order of the Growler"", a social club dedicated to the enjoyment of good food and especially good beer. During our visit to BJ's tonight.....: Pros: great tasting burger. Got the Bacon Cheeseburger add jalapeños, mushrooms, and avocados. Hold the onions. Stuffed mushrooms and Mac and Cheese for appetizer. Tried to pair with Stone Ruination IPA, which they did not have. Second choice was Piraat Belgium Ale which was excellent. Server was attentive but a bit absent minded. Cons: They forgot to add the mushrooms to my burger. They brought me some microwaved mushroom in a small cup when I told my waiter that my burger was missing the mushrooms I requested. The Mac and cheese lacked cheese and was very dry as if it had sat out for a while before serving. They were completely out of the Stone IPA though it was still on their menu. Worst part of today's visit.... Waiter brought a bottle of Piraat and no glass to pour it in. Surely a place named BJ's Brewhouse would know that good beer should always be poured into a glass and not drank out of the bottle. Ordered desert, they were out so I'm not going to mention what we ordered.  The experience wasn't a total loss, but it was indeed disappointing. Shame on you BJ's..."
Earl A.,"Katy, TX",336,357,689,3.0,6/8/2014,"My family surprised me with an early birthday celebration here. I was truly surprised. They got me!  Little did they know I had lunch here early yesterday my first time here since they opened.  I was told they were able to make a reservation and they said even though it was last minute the manager made it happen. Good customer service.  We had a party of seven people and in the beginning the service was very good we got our drinks and appetizers an ordered our main entrees. Well they forgot one of the entrees so that person had to wait longer to eat.  I ordered their lettuce wraps for my appetizer and it was delicious. It was a dish I had at lunch and I knew what I was getting. Our party also ordered their flatbread pizza appetizer and all enjoyed. Maybe since it was during peak time the service was a little slow so I'll reserve that for another visit. At lunch service  was superb  My entree was their ribs which were just ok. They were not as good as the ones I had at Applebee's earlier this week, I also had a chili soup which was very good. In the end we had to wait a long time to receive my free birthday cookie with ice cream on top which was very delicious also so I guess it was worth the wait. All in all a very enjoyable night by me an my party the ambiance was nice with multiple TVs all around the restaurant. If my wife would like to go back I will add them to my list."
Renee S.,"Austin, TX",6,34,,1.0,5/2/2015,"The low reviews which complain of bad service are correct.   Server took a long time to take our order, then we never saw him again.  Food was dropped off without a word by a different server.  Steak was overcooked, pasta dish was dry and very unappetizing.  Nobody ever checked back with us, so we didn't have the opportunity to change our orders.  We never got a drink refill, and ate our yucky food without any beverage.  We had to flag down the waiter after our meal to ask for check and told him our complaints. He gave us our bill without an apology or any kind of discount, and actually seemed a little angry that we complained, although we were very nice and polite about it.  So we had bad service, bad food, and bad reception to our complaints. Great. The worst part is that I wrote to the company and told manager about the whole negative experience  He offered to email me a gift certificate so we could try the restaurant again. The gift certificate never arrived. Poor management trickles down to a poor customer experience. I will never return to this location. They don't seem to care in the slightest about their customers."
Jack K.,"Richmond, TX",15,8,1,1.0,5/8/2015,I know you can't bring dogs to a place that serves food in U.S. according to FDA but that wasn't the case at BJ's. Some lady walked in with a toy dog on a leash along with ooohs and awwws from hostesses. When I asked our waitress if people can bring their dogs in here I was told only service dogs were allowed. That was not a service dog!!! This was my first time at BJ's and from the looks of it it is also my last time since I wouldn't eat at a place that sanitation and customer's health are less important than keeping a dog owner patron happy. I don't know if I would have gotten the same treatment if I brought my dogs in.  P.S. I have 2 Rottweilers
Darrell K.,"Katy, TX",85,74,124,3.0,4/30/2014,"I like this place but... The new location in Katy still has to work out their issues since they just opened. Service was very slow, but friendly.  The food took forever to come. My wife and daughter had Mahi Mahi and Salmon and they were both dry and over cooked. They never brought the extra sauce for the fish that they asked for. Hamburgers were decent but they couldn't seem to bring me enough Chipotle sauce for my jalapeño burger. They would only give me a tiny side of it each time I asked! It's still a good place and I am sure it will get better otherwise I won't be coming back.  They have a nice assortment of beers on tap as well as lots of different kinds of pizza! I will most likely have pizza when I come back..."
Rachel D.,"Cypress, TX",142,81,27,1.0,5/15/2016,"I really want to like this place but it's been a disappointment every time.. I tried their lettuce wraps with chicken, and the little cup of chicken was filled to the brim with oil. Gross! I've also stopped in for lunch one day for clam chowder soup. Let me start off by saying my bowl of soup took 45 minutes to get out to me. The first bowl I got was so salty I couldn't eat it. The second bowl was so sweet I still couldn't eat it! Next thing you know, I've got like 6 bowls of clam chowder in front of me and each one tasted different and they all tasted nasty. Even the rest of my party agreed. Sadly, I won't be returning."
Ceron C.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",67,11,1,1.0,7/22/2016,"I took my sister & niece to this BJ's because it so good in California but I was shocked by the level of food! It was  super salty and I chose the light menu lime/lemon chicken! Honestly, it's a good thing it's less than mile from memorial hospital, because if you eat the food you are certain to suffer from hypertension! The chef staff needs to do better, and make sure the food is more balanced!  *5 thumps down for the food seasoning and presentation BUT ***** 5 thumps up for the waitor! Boo BJ's fix it!"
Kristin M.,"Katy, TX",3,11,4,1.0,1/15/2017,"I was disappointed with BJs for a variety of reasons. We had to wait for a bit even though there were many tables available.  The menu had food all over it (very off-putting). My salad came out on a dirty plate- I didn't eat it. Anyhow, when our main food arrived, my daughter's order was wrong, part of my son's order was missing, my husband's order was wrong (and still wrong when it came back out the second time), and they completely forgot mine. They didn't even notice that I was sitting there without food. I figured it was on its way out, but nope... I had to ask a waiter nearby and he said he'd check on it, but I watched him and he never did. When the waitress eventually came back, she said she'd check on it. When she did, she told me she couldn't find it. Eventually it came out when my family was half done eating. My mashed potatoes were completely cold upon arrival and my meat was disappointing. I did not eat it. Everyone else's food was mediocre. Our plates stayed in front of us for a long time. Everything the whole evening was SLOW. My daughter's dessert took almost 30 minutes to arrive. It took almost an hour and 45 minutes from walking in to leaving. Never once did a manager come over after NUMEROUS issues. That would have made a big difference! Where was the manager? The waitress was nice, but clearly the wait staff had too many tables to cover and they to be more attentive. I walked out feeling annoyed and hungry! We won't be back."
Keith R.,"Houston, TX",26,34,25,4.0,4/21/2016,"Solid staple for good food with continually evolving entrées and appetizers. Always safe and friendly, positive atmosphere... And try their beer! For anyone that's not been to BJ's... anywhere, it's a close-knit national chain with proper management and proper BEER! ...Jeremiah Red is a national treasures!"
Vic C.,"Katy, TX",65,198,222,2.0,4/30/2014,"Some-what disappointing.  Wait was over an hour long around 10pm. Didnt get seated till 15 past 11ish...  Then the presentation of the food was not all that great. Felt like I got ripped off. I ordered freis and a burger... When I got the food, it looked like it was thrown on the plate in a rush, the bun was and patty/meat was falling off, it looked like it was smooshed together. The fries where everywhere... Did not look appetizing at all.. But my friends enjoyed their food."
Jessica D.,"Austin, TX",8,31,32,5.0,4/18/2016,I could try the entire menu and never get bored. The food menu alone is as big as a great novel. And the beer selection is outstanding. I try to sample a different beer each visit. One day I will get brave enough to try that beer sample deal. Six different beers!
Edward B.,"North Aurora, IL",4,59,23,5.0,4/16/2016,"Spencer, one of BJ's primo bartenders, is the best thing they have going here. His customer service equals the awesome food and drink at this BJ's. We always feel welcome and at home when we visit. Definitely worth the trip!!"
Dave M.,"Fulshear, TX",3,60,40,5.0,4/3/2016,Had a great experience. Had jambalaya and my wife had spaghetti and meatballs.  We sat at the bar. The bartender Brandon was very attentive.  We met the manager Mike who was super nice.  Their new monkey bread dessert is delicious.
