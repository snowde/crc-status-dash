Joeily F.,"Saint Cloud, FL",22,1,1,4.0,12/21/2017,"I have been here plenty of times with the most recent time being last night. Diana is the sweetest server and very helpful if you have any questions. Many many options of drinks and meals. Below are  things  i've tried: Appetizers  1) Chicken spotters- (outside of dumpling shell) very good starter, kind of feels like you're eating an egg roll, with chicken inside it, comes with an accompanying sauce, didn't really like the sauce that much.  2) Chicken Wings- they have different flavors to choose from, they add just enough of each sauce and the chicken is not too hard or too bland.  3) Flatbread- have not had in a while, but I remember it being good. 4) Artichoke and spinach dip with nachos- my favorite appetizer- love the the creamy dip, warm with the nachos it makes for a great start!  Meals  1) Egg, tomato, lettuce, Avocado burger - this is the first burger I had there, if you like all the ingredients mentioned above, this is for you. (Also, do not think that's the actual burger name)  2) Pasta- oven baked ziti- warm, warm, lots of tomatoes sauce  Drinks 1) Blood orange sangria- has cinnamon, orange, pomegranate, pretty firm flavor and strong. 2) Patron Margarita-  taste like an orange soda. Has tequila in it.  3) Blue vodka and lime drink- a nice not-too-strong drink, that makes for a smooth sip, while still tasting the vodka. 4) Alabama sunset-  for some reason I don't like anything about this drink except how it looks  Dessert The cookie pan with ice cream is a sweet sweet delight!"
Renee B.,"Orlando, FL",26,8,,3.0,12/10/2017,"The food has always been amazing however I realize it is a Sports Bar  It's so loud in here, I remember that's why I don't come as often :(. The music is too loud you have to shout.  We have not been waited over n for 10 mins About to leave !"
Nicole S.,"Kissimmee, FL",0,12,,5.0,12/6/2017,"PIZOOKIE, the only dessert you ever need!! The new PB s'mores one is FANTASTIC!! Nice happy hour app pricing. Manager has been very kind on numerous occasions that we have been there. Potato skins are the best and really love that they have gluten free pizza options"
Erin G.,"Orlando, FL",88,90,430,5.0,10/24/2017,if we are down by the Loop near happy hour for BJ's (usually 10 pm or later plus games) we stop for their deal.  I belly up to the bar and Tina Y is frequently the bartender.  She provides great service and is delightful.  She remembers you and is attentive and you get your drinks and food quickly.  Half price mini pizzas and shareable appetizers. Good deals for happy hour Great service from Tina Happy Customers plus they have high def TVs in the bar
Travis J.,"Winter Park, Orlando, FL",535,143,414,5.0,9/7/2017,"BJ's is one of my favorite restaurants thanks to the variety of food they provide and the fact that they brew their own beer. I've been to a few around the area and never reviewed one. But I can honestly say that I've never had a bad experience at any BJ's. The service is always good as is their food.  I had orederd their hangover burger which came with an over medium egg and bacon and was served open faced along with a side of fries. The burger was cooked to my liking and I couldn't finish. Thankfully I didn't because I later received a surprise dessert that I've never seen on the menu and apparently a secret item. Well the secrets out I guess! It was a beignet topped with ice cream, whipped cream and strawberries! This is a must have!"
Ashley B.,"Orlando, FL",191,200,1143,5.0,7/18/2017,"We stopped here for a late night experience and we were impressed. The late night weekday happy hour starts at 10 pm and offers $1 off beer and half off appetizers along with other deals. My boyfriend can't have wheat and thankfully for him our server Katie was able to find a delicous beer he can have.  Our server Katie was amazing. She had a wonderful personality, very attentive and knew the beer on draft and on the menu inside/out. With her help he ordered two beers.   I got the ahi tuna app for half off making it only $5 and the 10 piece wings for $5 as well. You can't beat these late night happy hour deals and the food is awesome. Overall awesome experience."
Janet G.,"Middleburg, FL",7,8,,5.0,12/23/2017,"Yesterday, my adult son and I stopped in to BJ's.  I'm pretty sure it was at this location. Our server was Matt! He was such a wonderful young man. Courteous, professional, yet personal. I have never been to a BJ's restaurant before yesterday. The food even tops my favorite all time restaurant ( which I won't name). I ordered the Mac-n-cheese.   I thought, 'this is what Mac- n-Cheese must taste like in Heaven.' During our visit, a young man stopped by our table with a tray full of individual size ( in a shot glass) Rootbeer Floats. He gave my son and I one. YIKES!  Man that was GOOD!!!! We also got the small dessert name,Pazooki for free because we downloaded the restaurants app. I got The Macadamia Nut one and he got the Carmel one. We were delirious with delight. Our entire dining experience was DIVINE. Thank you so much...and a big hug and shout-out to Matt( our server). Thank you"
Aileen C.,"Orlando, FL",160,150,306,4.0,11/16/2017,"Ordered the appetizer sampler which came with boneless wings (which we had tossed in glazed root beer) - I was a really big fan of the flavor... avocado egg rolls - this was delicious!!!, mozzarella sticks - standard, and Spinach artichoke dip - standard. There was a lot of food, enough to share with 3-4 people. I got the BJs mini deep dish pizza. It was good but a little too doughy - but I guess that's expected since it's deep dish. My fiancé got the prime rib dinner weekend special. It came with soup, the clam chowder we really good, the prime rib with green beans and cheddar mashed potatoes, and a pazooki dessert that we had to ask to take to go since we were so full. His entrée was for less than $30 for tons of food. Not bad!  I will like to come back again and try different things."
Bonnie B.,"Inverness, FL",62,26,12,5.0,12/11/2017,This place is amazing OMG second time here but two different places it's a chain. I want to try everything on the menu can't wait for our next trip here.
Jennifer T.,"Orlando, FL",79,45,61,5.0,12/11/2017,Came in just after 3. Happy hour weekday in bar area. 1/2 most appetizers and drink specials from 2-4 bucks. Had the tacos. Did 1 shrimp and 1 fish both grilled. They are one of my favorite menu items. I always leave happy and full. Go in and try a BJ's handcrafted beer. Plenty of choices! Bar tender Justin was amazing!
Lisa S.,"Whitby, Canada",62,334,26,4.0,3/31/2017,"After two days of driving, our large group ended up meeting at BJ's for lunch before we were able to check into our rental property. I went inside to see what the wait was like and they took my phone number and told me they'd text me when our table was ready, about 15 minutes since there was 6 adults and a baby. Not too bad and the text thing was super handy. The menu here is super big, that's why I chose it - simply because with 6 adults and at least 3 of them being picky eaters, I knew there would be something for everyone and almost all of us were sick of burgers and fries by this point. One of my buddies wanted to try some of their beer but didn't know what kind, so they brought him three to sample before he chose! Cool! I ended up ordering the bacon brisket, which turns out is a burger (duh) with a caesar and a fancy drink. The drink was good but nothing to write home about and not a ton of booze in it either. We all got some artichoke and spinach drip, which was really good, and my friends got the fried artichokes, which were awesome!! Yum! The burger was good, not what I was expecting but nice and tasty just the same. The salad was good if a bit soggy, could have used less dressing in my opinion. I guess this is a Canadian thing, but a bunch of people ordered chicken tenders and when they asked the waitress for plum sauce, she had no idea what that was and didn't know what sweet and sour sauce was either!!  I would definitely come back to BJs, the menu size alone is a huge plus, anyone can find something, and the service was prompt and very very friendly."
Alex R.,"Celebration, FL",583,227,1073,3.0,2/27/2017,"I like BJs, it's a great restaurant. The service is really good. One thing I love is their shoestring fries. To my surprise they took the shoestring fries off their menu. I was just there 2 or 3 weeks ago when it was on the menu. The new fries aren't that good. From 1 to 10, I would say a 3. As far as their other food that's good. I had a chicken bacon sandwich and it was delicious. The calamari is always delicious. I still can't believe they took those shoe string fries away."
Heather W.,"Orlando, FL",361,207,163,4.0,5/1/2017,"A friend and I stopped into BJs Friday after work with no idea what we would want but within minutes of being seated, and after seeing the seasonal insert, we had decided!  On Friday and Saturday after 4pm and Sunday all day BJs is doing Prime Rib meal for $28 that comes with a soup or salad, Prime Rib, two sides, and a pizzoki. After spending some time looking at my options I choose the Broccoli and Cheddar soup which was honestly my favorite I have ever had. It was a smooth, but hearty cheese soup with nice sized pieces (I find most places have time specks) of broccoli, and packed with flavor. I ordered my Prime Rib medium rare, and while it came out slightly more rare than medium rare, it was like a party in my mouth! The meat belted like butter and the seasoning that they use on the outside gave a nice kick. My sides were steamed broccoli (a bit on the raw side, but I like it that way) and a baked potato and both were just you normal sides. For my pizzoki I got the regular Chocolate Chunk rather than a fancy flavor and it was the perfect end of the meal. Also, I ended up saving him a bit of each course and I had plenty to take home and warm up for another meal which made it well worth the almost $35 it ended up being with tip. My only qualm was our server. She was nice, but sadly we had gotten water after working all day in the heat and we never got a refill and rarely saw her so we didn't have many opportunities to ask for more."
Melinda B.,"Saint Cloud, FL",264,243,930,4.0,1/15/2017,Yelp 100 challenge 2017!  33/100  For a franchise restaurant this place is pretty good. They have a variety of craft beers. The best thing to do is get a flight to try a few different beers. They have a large menu. I prefer a burger with my beer. The burgers are pretty good. The dining area is really large and they have a full bar. I have had some events with large groups. They usually set aside one side of the restaurant and provide a buffet or a set menu to chose from. The wait time is average maybe 10/15 minutes unless it's a Sunday afternoon.
Laura H.,"London, Canada",17,76,14,3.0,3/13/2017,"I dined here several times while staying at a vacation rental close to the Loop. This franchise was new to me and overall I had better lunchtime experiences, but overall I would say this was better than average fare for a restaurant that serves ""everything"". The restaurant space itself is massive and offers both booth and table options. There is a large bar area as well. Lunch: I loved their endless soup and salad combo ($9.5). I started with broccoli cheddar soup and the wedge salad. Salad was a touch skimpy on the blue cheese, but still very fresh lettuce and a decent amount of cherry tomatoes. The broccoli cheddar soup was comparable to ones I've had at Panera Bread. When I found myself still hungry, I ""refilled"" my soup with their chili. It was hearty, a bit of a kick that was tempered by the sour cream garnish. On another occasion I tried their tomato cheese salad. It was my least favourite of the options I tried, but still fine. Their grilled cheeses were great ($7.25). Huge portions. Root beer ribs were a bit sweet, but tender. Lunch prices are very reasonable.  Dinner: Less successful. No endless soup and salad available. I had one of their ""enlightened"" entrees: the Peruvian chicken quinoa bowl. ($13.5) It was my favourite entree here. The chicken was very moist and the tomato/onion/mushroom/spinach compote it sat on was nicely spiced. I tried their Portobello mushroom salad ($5.75) that didn't come with the asparagus as described. I alerted the staff who brought me a bowl of asparagus. I had mostly finished the salad at that point so not a great solution. And the worst entree I tried was the Jumbo Spaghetti and Meatballs ($15.75). Yes, there was a lot of food. The garlic roll was the best part. The pasta was mushy, the sauce was bland and the meatballs tasted like sawdust. It said ""sausage blend"" but I would have guessed chicken meatballs from the texture. Beer: Solid. I liked the Brewhouse Blonde. There are lots of choices. It is a brewhouse so you're expecting good craft beer. I was not disappointed. Service: Hit and miss. Some servers were great. Others ok. One literally left our table and disappeared. Never came back. Someone else had to bring us our meals and bill. Odd. Overall I'd recommend for casual sit-down meal."
Thom M.,"Kissimmee, FL",0,20,,4.0,9/7/2017,"Been going to BJs for a while and everything is so consistent. Only once had to send back an item and they were great about it. Best Happy Hour prices on food and drinks. Great Parmesan encrusted chicken and Jambalaya on the entrees. So many good appetizers like avocado egg rolls, ahi poke tuna and blonde asparagus. They also have great burgers.   If you're going to go frequently I advise you to join their rewards as it adds up quickly."
Barbara Librie H.,"Celebration, FL",17,13,,5.0,11/10/2017,"BJ's is a lunch favorite for us. We always enjoy a Ahi Poke appetizer and they accommodate my request for no onions so we know it is always fresh. Today we shared the Prime Rib dip sandwich with fries and it was more than enough for us. Mom had the classic grilled cheese sandwich which she really enjoyed. Our server was very attentive and checked back often to make sure we were okay. And, best of all and in spite of the noisy atmosphere, our grandson slept through the entire meal! We had lunch again today for Veteran's Day. My husband's lunch was complimentary as a thank you for his service. The restaurant was quiet crowded with other Veterans and their families. We both had the BBQ Bison Burger medium rare. Both were perfectly cooked and delicious. I ordered mine with no bun, pico or aioli. It came out served on a bed of lettuce with coleslaw and was exactly what I hoped for.  I love being a rewards member and having the ability to view and pay my check on their app as well as getting points to use on a future meal."
A R.,"Orlando, FL",1,45,77,5.0,7/22/2017,"Went back to Same BJ's & had the same server, Andrew. Once again, great experience. This guy is good. No complaints. Food & service above average."
Doris R.,"Kissimmee, FL",94,101,111,5.0,6/19/2017,We came here a few months back with my family. We weren't sure on what to order but the waiter we had made it easy for us. He had amazing customer service and made us feel like family.
Arisnet P.,"FL, FL",89,15,16,4.0,6/9/2017,First the avocado egg roll is amazing!!! I've been here a few times and the service is always great. The waiters are super nice and very attentive. I've had the deep dish pizza which is always yummy. However last time I went I had Mediterranean tacos and they were not my favorite but the cookie dessert after made up for it.
George W.,"Woodstock, GA",27,197,194,4.0,3/16/2017,"Beer choices were very good they had local brews and other state craft brews. Would certainly attend again, the menu kind of reminds me of the cheesecake factory with page after page after page of different foods to eat this can sometimes be overwhelming. I enjoyed my food, it was well cooked and served appropriately, the only challenge is picking what I wanted"
Marcus H.,"Chesterfield, VA",55,75,26,5.0,4/20/2017,"My first time here, my girlfriends been here a few times, we came to watch the college game. I took my time to check out the menu and there were tons of options everything from salads to steak to pizza and tons inbetween. The service was awesome, fast and friendly. We never had to ask for anything, it was always offered to us. There were plenty televisions around to be able to see the game from start to finish and just enough sound, not the overbearing sounds of the television when your trying to have a conversation. I would recommend this place to others wanting to enjoy the games or just a nice evening out."
Jason P.,"Saint Cloud, FL",24,61,149,4.0,3/25/2017,"Decided to take my mother before she headed back to PA.  We got there at about 4:30pm and sat right away.  We all enjoyed our meals and dessert.  So, we started off with their potato skins and fried calamari.   We love their potato skins, reason being how crispy they are.   Calamari was a first and we were very happy with those.  One guess got their homemade rootbeer, he said it was really good and got a 2nd glass.  For dinner, one guess got a pepperoni pizza and loved it.  Second guess had the roastbeef dip, loved this as well.  Third guess got the Ahi tuna salad, liked the salad but was very disappointed with the size and of the Tuna size it self.  They were maybe the size of a thumb nail each.  Picture is very misleading.  (Would not order it agian).  I got the chicken  tacos, very good and would get them again.  We finished our meal with the three pizzookie dessert.  Had cookies n cream, monkey bread and PB bread.  We highly recommend these to finish your meal."
James O.,"Gainesville, FL",18,352,16,4.0,9/17/2016,"Fancy bar-food is the best way to summarize BJ's.  This is the place to go to watch a game, to catch up with friends; pretty much any activity that is done over beer and greasy food. The plus side to all of that is that the food is actually pretty good, and you get waiter service.  But this is definitely a bar/restaurant to take friends to.  Not a date."
Beverly O.,"Kissimmee, FL",20,7,,4.0,5/21/2017,The sound is loud but the food is excellent...soups are all good and burgers are good ...menu is super extensive.  House beers and ciders are great.. The prime rib dinner is top knotch..served after 4 pm everyday . Sunday all day. Comes with two sides and soup or salad and dessert. A great meal....I'll could eat here several times a week
Lee L.,"Naples, FL",157,12,3,2.0,11/10/2017,"Ate at this location tonight and it was a horrible experience. Our female server who I will not name on here needs to find a new line of work because she doesn't know how to do her job. Not only was she lacking personality, after she took our order never once did she check on us to see if everything was alright. I was sucking down ice cubes because I was out of Pepsi. When I finally hunted her down I had to ask her for drink refills. When it came time we wanted our bill I had to ask another server to find our waitress and tell her we want our bill so we could leave. Five minutes later she showed up. On a good note our pizza was the best pizza we have had in a long time! I would get it again but next time I will get it to go. We will not be back to dine there again. For the price they charge there and to get the worst service it's not worth our time and money. I would recommend Bahama Breeze and Cheddars down the road! They have great service and food!"
Rafael F.,"Kissimmee, FL",0,5,11,4.0,5/14/2017,Wow...awesome food..and the ale was real good..had a picture of tatonka stout..wow very strong and tasteful..will order again..I had the ribeye stake and it was om the money..my son had full rack babyback ribs and he said they where finger leiking good..service was very satisfying..the waitress was very professional and very knowledgeable..definitely will return...
Dennis M.,"Lorton, VA",250,187,569,4.0,6/11/2016,"I'm from out of town so when my cousins say  ""Let's go eat at BJ'S"" I'm thinking  ""These ghetto chicks want to circle the free samples over and over at BJ'S Wholesale Club""  But I was wrong when I realized BJ'S was a restaurant.  Beer deserves 5 Stars. Their craft IPA called Hopstorm was fantastic. I'm a huge IPA fan and this certainly is up there with the best so try it.  I ordered the calamari and it was pretty messed up. Most of the pieces were stuck together so after you detached them you were left with just squid and separate batter. What a mess.  If you're looking for good beer though come here. Just order 4 rounds of their delicious craft booze THEN order food. It'll seem better drunk. Beer selection website. "
Jamie B.,"Orlando, FL",51,37,6,4.0,3/3/2017,This is a great place if you don't know what you want to eat for dinner. They have everything. Tonight I shared a deep dish pizza with my son and we ordered the bj's combo. Wow was it delicious. I purposely ordered a bigger pizza than I knew we could eat so we had some to take home.  My wife had a ahi tuna slaps and she thought it was good.  Stop in when you can. The staff is friendly and the food is great.
Louise S.,"Kissimmee, Orlando, FL",341,549,2622,3.0,2/23/2016,"35/100 of 2016 challenge This is usually a good place to go. The wait for a table was not very long and we were  approached by our waiter fairly soon after being seated. That is where the good service stops. Our order for drinks was taken within 5 minutes of us being seated. It took us another 15 to get our drinks and by the way, we were seating in a booth in the bar section. We were there just afternoon time on a Sunday. The food itself was cooked well and tasty. I had the portabello swiss burger, one friend had shrimp tacos and the other grilled chicken. It just took a long time to get. We placed our 2nd drink order once we had received our 1st one because we knew it would a while to get it. We also placed our food order at the same time. It took 45 minutes to get our food and 20 to get our 2nd drinks. The service was clearly slow. Our waitress Victoria only came back once to check on us to see if we needed anything and once to see if we were ready for the check or if we were having dessert, in that order. Yep the check and then asked about dessert. Our waitress was pleasant enough just not attentive enough. Maybe she had too many tables but I felt she should have checked on us more often. The restrooms were clean and maintained well.  The noise level here is loud and louder and its not because of the TV's I feel. I would go back again and give them another try. I think it was just an off day. Again the food was good."
Brenda L.,"Downtown, Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,5.0,7/11/2017,Best happy hour in their Hunters Creek area. Food is awesome they have lots of choices the only negative I would say is that during football season they do not have the volume Up on the TV
Natalie M.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",26,31,51,5.0,5/1/2016,"This review is based solely on the food, not the craft beer. First time at this place and it won't be the last. They have a little bit of everything to choose from. My  best friend and I had the fried calamari, we asked for it to come with a lemon garlic aioli and our waitress happily brought it out  (thank the lord). We followed that with fried brussel sprouts, a side of mashed potatoers, and a small deep dish pizza - the BJ's favorite. Everything was absolutely delectable.   I'm coming back for that monkey bread dessert."
Jana D.,"Kanata, Canada",155,591,622,5.0,1/16/2016,"Maybe only a 4.5 - based on effect of the food on my bod, which was not prepared for such spicy Brussels sprouts! But they were tasty... And then the spice kicked in! I ate maybe half the order. What the heck - I'm on holiday; wanted to try something new! Service here was good, patient and friendly. This place is a bar which also serves food (which is a good thing!) They offer a large enticing menu, with plenty of choices. I had a brunette beer. They offer several combination beers that looked really good - a blend of 2 beers. I topped off my meal with broccoli cheddar soup, and had no room for the desert I had my mind on! They are doing a fund raiser for children with disabilities - by offering cookies. However, these come with ice cream so I couldn't take it to go. Next time, I come for desert only!!"
Andrea H.,"Orlando, FL",10,82,2,3.0,6/12/2017,"This place is hit and miss. Tried several different items from their enormous menu. The recommended chefs pizza was not good. Super oily and greasy. No good flavor developed on the pizza. The Mediterranean tacos were not good. The pita was charred and didn't taste good. Their sauce was not a good replica. However their grilled ham and cheese is awesome and their appetizer potato skins. Service is bad or great, just depends. One time we waited for 1.5 hrs for our food. The kitchen here comes out with food a lot slower than other restaurants. Have time available if you are going here. No quick in and out."
Henry B.,"Milwaukee, WI",0,20,,5.0,1/31/2017,"Good beer and the food is a level above most restaurants, chain or not.  We especially like the pizza including the Sweet Pig with ham and pineapple.  The BBQ Chicken pizza with cilantro is excellent.  The beer selection is large and the beer is fresh; never had an off tasting beer here. One of our favorites in the Orlando-Kissimmee area; have been here many time for the past several year during our yearly winter visits in FL.  I wish we had a BJ's in Wisconsin.  I was told that they are moving toward the New England area and I hope the upper midwest is next!  There are places comparable in concept to BJ's in the Milwaukee area but BJ's food is a quality level above them.  You know that a restaurant's management is thinking about quality when they locate the men's room hand drying towel wastebasket near the door handle."
Allyson H.,"Kissimmee, FL",0,1,,2.0,5/26/2017,"Bad experience all around. Our waitress was nice as can be and none of it was her fault. When we walked in, we were ignored. It took almost 10 minutes for someone to acknowledge us. We were seated after and opened up our silverware, it was dirty. Asked for a second pair, dirty. We told the busser and he didn't seem to care & just gave us our third, which was finally clean.  Our food came out on time, but it wasn't great. unfortunately everyone around of us was having a bad experience so after we ate, we paid for our meal & we left immediately. I'm not one to complain, but this was awful. Hopefully it was just an off night."
Nicole M.,"Glen Oaks, NY",12,33,103,5.0,9/10/2016,It's a really good chain restaurant. We don't have one in New York near me at least but we always try to stop here when in Orlando. Friendly quick service and has a really nice atmosphere. My dad loves all the different beers on tap as well plus it's cool to see the beer being brewed through some of the Windows.
Kinya L.,"Clearwater, FL",11,41,355,3.0,3/13/2016,Waiting time was estimated at 15 minutes and it was exactly that. Loud environment with slippery floors. Be careful. It seemed like a bad day for whomever kept dropping dishes. I heard about 3 items breaking within my two hour sitting. Food came out cold and in pieces. Appetizers were served with my entree. The waiter was pleasant and attentive. The food was tasty and would have tasted better had it been served hot.The cookies served with a scoop of ice cream was AMAZING.... I recommend  that if you enjoyed a nice baked treat.
Andrea N.,"Kissimmee, Orlando, FL",131,5,2,2.0,4/23/2017,"After a spotty history with this location, we were giving it another chance. We ordered ahead, we waited an hour at the bar and were told ""we were waiting on fresh fries!"" An hour for fresh fries? Cool. So we don't order ahead through the app anymore. Today it took 45 minutes to get the order placed at the bar and when we got it home, my roast beef dip had nothing to dip it in. Cool. The bar/service staff is so great so I just can't understand the disconnect between management and back of house and meeting the front of house standards. Back to BJ Brewhouse hiatus."
Staci L.,"Granger, IN",119,5,,5.0,2/16/2017,We were so happy to randomly stumble upon this place when we rented out a house down there. The atmosphere was cool and they had a full bar plus their own beers so choose from. We all ordered mini pizzas and devoured them! The first night we were there the server (I believe Rachelle) told us about the amazing happy hour deals and that's when we wished we had one in our home town! We went there again a couple days later for brunch and it didn't disappoint! I believe that was the best mimosa I've ever had! Our server Darcy did a phenomenal job and helped us along with our order and guided us thru more of the menu. We each had sandwiches of some sort and they were delicious! This is a place we were so happy to find in the little time we spent in Orlando.
