Enrique C.,"Miami, FL",6,138,383,4.0,10/11/2010,"Beautiful restaurant and AWESOME flat screen TVs.  The beer is GREAT!!!  My family had the pizza and bruscetta appetizers and they were very GOOD.  I had the potato and sandwich entree, my wife had a spaghetti plate and my daughter had the burger.  All were very tasty.  The service was good.  I highly recommend this restaurant.  It is located in The Loop shopping area.  After eating you can guy shopping or to the movies.  Lunch prices are affordable."
Marc G.,"Altamonte Springs, FL",537,49,1,3.0,11/13/2008,"Clients had suggested that we meet there yesterday.  I generally am not interested in chain restaurants, but must say that this was quite pleasant and the food was very good, in particular because it was a chain.   Service was very good as was the food.  One guest had the pumpkin ale and he was quite pleased with it.  We all enjoyed our meals and I was quite pleased.  I expected it to be so-so & it was quite good.  I'd even think of going back with clients."
Anil R.,"Orlando, FL",0,6,,3.0,8/1/2011,"The food is good, the atmosphere is great but I was sitting at the bar a few months ago with some friends and the bartender and his favorite patrons decided that we were ""in there way"" and pushed us out of the way.  Not the way physically and verbally, we were not expecting to be treated this way so not going there any more."
Ricardo R.,"Orlando, FL",19,29,41,4.0,4/27/2010,"Hello Guys, Here is my first actual YELP review, YEAH! Met with my good friend for lunch at the LOOP mall in Kissimee, Fl. Decided on BJ's Rest and Brew House. From the outside the place looks very inviting, walking in, (A revolving glass door met us at the entrance, cool hugh?). We entered the restaurant, met by a greeter, (She was cute) and was brought in to a lightly lit, great looking restaurant. Sat at a booth that was not too tight ( I am a LARGER person, lol.) Our server met us with her trainee just seconds after we where sat, and apologized for making us wait, introduced herself and her trainee, (I decided to leave the names out). Again, our server was very cute, made a few suggestions for us , took our drink order, and gave us a moment to look over the menu and make a few decisions. Price wise the menu prices seem to fit the area and the décor/atmosphere. I decided to start with the suggested Clam Chowder for an Appetizer, and ordered the California Burger for my lunch entrée. Food was delivered in a short time after ordering and we where NOT interrupted more than twice during our meal ( A personal pet peeve). We where not able to leave room for dessert, but I am looking forward to trying the BJ's Pizookie. I am not able to say much about the price as was not privy to our total, (Thank You ""S"" for another great Lunch.) I am guessing the amount is/was close to $20ish/$30ish($25.00). I would defiantly suggest going here again and even though it is a chain, the food did not taste, look as though it was JUST a chain. Try them out and let me know what you think. Descriptions are from the official websites Menu:   CLAM CHOWDER New England-style chowder loaded with clams, potatoes, onions and spices. Large bowl or carved-out sourdough loaf. CALIFORNIA BURGER* Our half-pound patty served on sourdough bread, topped with avocado, roasted green chilies, pepper jack cheese, chipotle mayonnaise ranch dressing. BJ'S FAMOUS PIZOOKIE® You're never too old to enjoy our freshly baked, hot out of the oven, rich and delicious cookie topped with two scoops of vanilla bean ice cream and served in its own deep dish.Your choice of Chocolate Chunk, White Chocolate Macadamia Nut, Peanut Butter or Oatmeal Raisin Walnut."
Gabe S.,"Orlando, FL",6,34,30,3.0,9/8/2010,Good for a chain and with kids. Atmosphere is hi-energy with lots of tvs for sports and a setup over the bar that is any guys home entertainment fantasy. Food is so-so. Recommend sticking to salads & burgers.
Justin C.,"Orlando, FL",0,12,,4.0,5/30/2013,"As I wrote in my review for the Millenia location....go to this location (The Loop) if you have the choice.  Millenia service is hit or miss at best, but we have pretty much always had good luck at The Loop location.  Service is consistently good.  Not our favorite place ever or anything, but everything is solid here.  One little annoyance...the bartender (white, bald, middle aged) that looks like he used to be a bodybuilder...stop always screaming and howling!! You'll  be sitting there eating and having a conversation and all of a sudden out of nowhere you hear ""WOOOOO!"" (loud!) from behind the bar. I mean it's startling! Go there once when he is working and you'll know in a quick minute what I am talking about.  You can probably hear this guy anywhere in the restaurant and it gets annoying fast!"
Nathan K.,"Kissimmee, FL",0,2,,4.0,3/17/2013,The food and house beers were very delicious. Food seemed to take a while but could have been that it was packed on a Saturday night. Will definitely visit a BJ's again.
Asha J.,"New Brunswick, NJ",0,52,8,3.0,10/11/2009,Best deep dish pizza that I have had in a longtime ! The dough was buttery and the service was very nice:-)
Debra S.,"Novato, CA",2,45,,4.0,11/16/2008,"For the price you cant beat this food, its good and fresh and tastes very good, I love the potstckers, and normally have the appetizer with a sald, but my very fav is the veggie burger, the service is good, the only one issue i have is sometimes the people who go there are so out of control and behave badly and the music blares in your ears, so you really have to eat and go."
W Brian F.,"Orlando, FL",2,3,,5.0,6/8/2011,I love this place!!!!!  Excellent food and even more excellent drinks.  I can't get enough of the Tatonka Stout.  Be sure to try the BJ's favorite Chicago style pizza.  My family and I go to this location at least once every two weeks.  Don't change anything!!!
Marcel M.,"Kissimmee, FL",0,9,,1.0,2/10/2011,The layout of the restaurant is great:wide open. However the food was disappointing.We went there for happy hour when appetizers were half off. We ordered nachos with their home made chili.The nachos were terrible.The chili tasted like it was out of a can:it was blend and almost like a puree.To make it worse the chili was all the way in the bottom of the nachos.You literally have to push away the chips to get to the bottom of the plate and try to get it .And then you can not pick it up with the chips since it is not chunky. We also ordered calamari.This was blend also.I had to put loads of salt an pepper on it to no avail.The zesty marinara sauce and lemon garlic sauce simply didn't live up to their names. After being disappointed with these 2 items we decided to leave without trying anything else. What really made me go there was the attractive look of their building and to try their own beer.I was expecting for the beer the be reasonably  priced since they make it themselves but boy was  surprised:4.95 for a pint. Not my favorite place.
