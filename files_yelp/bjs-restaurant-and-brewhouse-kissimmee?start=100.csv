Kim J.,"Orlando, FL",66,1,,2.0,12/21/2015,"Steak dinners were ok, but half way through our meal we ordered what turned out to be a very weeny flatbread pizza that was described as a yummy thin crusted pizza with lots of meat.  Reality is that there was meatballs on three pieces, four slices of pepperocini and three slices with almost nothing on them...it took over 45 minutes to get a flatbread that took five minutes to make and it cost a whopping $15.  Boo Hiss...not again"
Tim W.,"Leesburg, FL",4,15,60,4.0,8/23/2015,"Absolutely fantastic spot to take a big dinning party to. We initially informed them that we would have twenty dining with us, they told us 40-45 mins and sure enough it was approximately 35-40 mins. So glad we didn't go to The Cheese Cake Factory, the wait would've been almost two hours on a Saturday evening for a party of 16-20. Angelia ""Angie"", was the best, she basically handled our two tables alone and did a superb job. The pizza is fabulous, chicken potstickers with ginger soy sauce was a fantastic starter, great alternative to the pork. All the food came out in a timely manner except one brisket burger, Angelia immediately corrected the problem. This was our third time dinning here, can't wait to go back. TW"
Mark K.,"Bloomfield, CT",0,6,,4.0,3/3/2016,This place is great!! Nice bar. Great food!  Had the ribs. They fell right off the bone. Very nice service
Nataly L.,"Kissimmee, FL",2,4,1,3.0,11/13/2014,"This is a great place for some beers and great food. I mainly stick to the fattening finger food, such as: California flatbread, chicken tenders, jalapeño burger, bjs favorite pizza, and so on. The last few times though, have not been as great as they usually are! My bf ordered the jalapeño burger, and to his surprise, the avocado was so hard he couldn't even bend it with his fingers! This is the second time it's happened to us! Also, I ordered chicken tenders and French fries, after waiting what seemed like forever, they came out cold and soaked in oil! We thought we could order the pazookie, cookie of your choice with ice cream on top, to make things better. Yet, we received an undercooked cookie with ice cream on top! Needless to say, the food was not up to par but the waitress was great! That's the only reason we may attempt to go back again !"
Kelley H.,"Kissimmee, FL",0,1,,5.0,4/7/2016,We are loyal guests to BJ's. Love the Pizza and Beer. Last night we had family in town from Atlanta and asked them to join us for Dinner and they were impressed not only with the food but the service. There were 9 of us and our server did a fantastic job.
Cin S.,"Kissimmee, FL",0,4,1,5.0,1/20/2014,"I wanted to try a nice place that wasn't quiet and boring, and i was not disappointed. The atmosphere was upbeat and the food was really good. I had the pineapple mahi mahi and it was really good. The dish wasn't heavy and it was a decent portion. My husband had the scampi linguini and he loved it as well. It was packed when i got there and i thought my waitress would take forever but she didn't, wait staff was attentive all around as far as i can tell.  I'll def be going back.. Don't forget to ask for beer samples"
Marcy E.,"Portland, OR",5,16,,2.0,11/24/2013,"I've been to this BJ's twice and both times were terrible experiences.  The first time I went with a friend to try something new. We got in and were seated immediately, which actually didn't matter because a waiter didn't show up for 20 minutes, and the other waiters who passed by us didn't bother asking if we needed help. We ended up getting up from our seats and were about to walk out the door until the hostess suggest she bring out the manager and he would help us. He treated us to a free appetizer, the ahi poke, which was pretty good. The rest of the food still took a very long time to come out and wasn't anything amazing.  The second (and final) time was last Friday with my husband. He's a fan of breweries and we both wanted somewhere good to eat. I figured I'd give this place another shot but soon realized that was a big mistake.  We're first greeted by a very pushy host about the reward card. I had actually filled one out last time but - surprise! - wasn't in the system. And I definitely wasn't filling out another card before my meal.  Once again, it was packed and once again the food and service was really slow. I wonder if they're always packed because it takes them so long to bring out food (maybe half those people are from the lunch rush??). And this time the food was terrible. All of our food was lukewarm; we got the two appetizer bites dishes, a pasta dish, and shrimp tacos (everything that should have been coming out hot). The waiter was also slow getting to our table, which I'm not sure why since we only saw him go to our table and the two on either side of us - what else could he be doing?  All in all, this place gives the chain restaurant a bad name. Better stick to local breweries for now on."
Dan L.,"Orlando, FL",0,8,,4.0,12/22/2014,"Nice place that won't disappoint.  We ordered tons of apps all of which were quite good.  Happy hour special is decent with a friendly staff.  Their menu is huge, which makes ordering difficult.  Seems like they really don't specialize in anything since they offer everything you could think of.  Dessert is a must."
Beverley M.,"Kissimmee, FL",42,5,4,3.0,5/15/2015,Food always good love the tuna salad! Last time though host was not at all helpful with 20 people standing outside and benches wet. We ask for a towel and was told busers dont have many so cant help. Made me think then what are the cleaning tables with!!!  So he stood doing nothing while i went into bathroom to get towels  and cleaned them myself. I work in a large restaurant and know how things run. Server was good. But may not come back due to host!! We live 10 minute away. Too many other restaurants near by to deal with rude staff
Janine R.,"Kissimmee, FL",8,22,1,5.0,4/1/2015,The Mahi Mahi tacos are amazinng. The jambalaya is fantastic. Always great food and service.
Dilo G.,"Orlando, FL",20,117,24,2.0,3/24/2015,Been here a few times because is closer to home and service and food seems to be ok but on my last visit my server was kind of rude and was MIA most of the time. He literally seem mad when I ask him to make a drink specifically like I wanted. I ordered their salmon and it was literally burned. I ate it because food took forever and I was really hungry. Yes they were busy but not a reason for server to be MIA must of the time. We literally ask him to make 2 drinks at a time because we knew he was no where to be found. I probably will be back if nothing else is open. It just an option but not a restaurant to think of when you hang out with your friends. Another reason I don't do chains that much
Luke S.,"Danbury, CT",10,13,2,4.0,2/17/2015,"Great food, big portions, great service. I got the shrimp scampi, I am full. Waitress was quick, food came out fast. What else do you need?"
AnitaDrink D.,"New York, NY",0,19,10,5.0,6/9/2015,"We first went to BJ's at The Loop a few months ago and we've been back three or four times since. It's a huge trendy restaurant/bar, perfect for large groups or an intimate meal. I've had steak and chicken entrees, meats cooked to perfection albeit a bit peppery. Large selection of beers, wines and cocktails to complement the meal. What sets this restaurant apart is the service: courteous, attentive, friendly servers, like David P., who served us today and made my birthday dining experience special. We will definitely be coming back for their good food, relaxed ambiance, and excellent service."
Mark V.,"Orlando, FL",2,23,,1.0,3/16/2016,"Start with a dark, empty warehouse. Large industrial a/c ducts hanging from the ceiling. Add a bunch of dark booths. A couple of TVs tuned to sports. Then add to this brooding, Batman type cave some totally random gold chandeliers and mirrors. Did I mention it's dark? Can't see the menu, can't see the waitress, can't see your dining companion. And for ambiance add loud, screeching metal music. This is the most unpleasant building I have ever been in. The food? who cares? you just want to eat and leave to escape the hellish atmosphere."
Jeremy L.,"Kissimmee, FL",91,79,126,4.0,12/24/2014,"During a busy day of Christmas shopping, my family and I decided to drop into BJ's for an afternoon recharge. This place is a nice blend of modern edged sports pub and  brew house style burger joint.  Flat screens abound, multi-level seating is ample and good food and drink are plentiful. For such a big place, it's not that loud, even though it appeared to be roughly 70% full.  I had no problem hearing and keeping up a conversation with my dinner mates. Our server, Kendal, was a rather handsome fella with a super outgoing personality who immediately took our drink order and gave  us time to contemplate appetizers.  We ordered three - fried artichoke hearts, Cantina fries (smothered with sauces that made the whole appetizer taste like a big taco chili  - DELISH!) and calamari. ALL were delicious, served hot and well flavored. After noshing on appetizers, we ordered lunch - ME : BBQ pulled pork slider with a BBQ chicken breast and fries. MY THREE DINNER PALS: bacon cheeseburger, quesadillas and a personal pepperoni pizza with a Caesar salad - good American comfort food that certainly provided us with the much needed energy to take on the Christmas shopping adventures ahead of us.  Would I come back to BJ's? YES, based on the following - great staff, great food and a cool atmosphere fit for a date night or an evening out with pals. Yeehaw!"
Joseph A.,"Trenton, FL",4,10,5,5.0,11/18/2014,I just love this place the food the people it doesn't get much better when in need of a luscious GLUTEN FREE pizza.
Fernanda D.,"Campeche, Mexico",30,216,745,4.0,5/18/2009,"The food is delicious! I always order the salad and the parmesan chicken, yummy!!! The service is not always good, depending on the server you get, I heard some people complain about their food the last time we've been there but we always got lucky with our dishes but not always lucky with the service."
Pam F.,"Orlando, FL",19,72,1,4.0,8/23/2013,"Every time I have been to this restaurant its been happy hour, half priced appetizers.  My friend and I ordered flat bread pizza, potato skins, and wings.  The food was very good.  The bartender warned us the portions were large, we didn't listen and over ordered.  We had leftovers. Great place for happy hour.  Prices are very reasonable."
Nancy R.,"St. Cloud, FL",30,20,6,5.0,1/2/2015,"Do not miss out by sitting in the dining room. The bar tender is amazing. Andrews's knowledge of the menus and beer selection is incredible. Great experience,!!!!"
Kris C.,"Orlando, FL",4,37,37,5.0,9/9/2013,"I really hesitate to give ANY restaurant a 5-star rating and this particular place does have 1 negative (wait time for food), but it just doesn't outweigh what a great experience me and my family have every time we go here! We have tried may different dishes (and I highly recommend the Buffalo Chicken Pizza and the New England Clam Chowder!!!) and have not had a bad meal yet. From the appetizers to the pizzas, all has been delic! It is really nicely decorated and comfortable - very family friendly; it's fairly loud (which may be a negative to some) so noisy kids will blend right in. My husband is a beer aficionado and loves the different selections they have (I can't go into this too much, my knowledge is just at the observation level!) Now, about those negatives; regardless if we go when it's busy or not, there is usually a pretty good wait for the food. What makes it bearable is the friendliness of the staff, the TVs, excellent people watching, and of course the company of my hubby!  Give it a try and maybe it will become one of your family favorites too!"
