Aylin A.,"Orlando, FL",10,3,,5.0,12/10/2013,"We frequently go to this BJ's because the variety of the menu is incredible that pleases everyone in our family. Sunday night I tried the new Salmon dish.. the spicy one it was really good.Desserts are really yummy too. Besides this the personnel are really professional yet warm, welcoming.. matching the cozy atmosphere. Sunday night I had forgotten my tea infuser that was very precious to me and thanks to our server CJ, the Manager David ... and probably other employees responsible for cleanup saved it until I realized I lost it on Tuesday and when I called I thought it would be gone forever but David told me he had it. THIS RESTAURANT AND THEIR PERSONNEL ROCKS !"
Unique M.,"Orlando, FL",135,57,9,3.0,6/23/2013,"I've never had a Pizookie before and I wasn't sure what to expect but it was yummy! The food isn't amazing but it isn't bad. The service was really great and that's probably why I'm giving it three stars. One of the managers went around and checked on all the tables, which I loved but I wasn't 100% crazy about their products."
Randy H.,"Sandy Springs, GA",207,299,682,3.0,2/4/2013,"This place is typical to any other BJ's in my opinion but it was still great nonetheless. The service was great, food came in a timely manner and everything. I went during the a typical dinner time setting. I had the Buffalo wings and the Buffalo chicken wontons. Nothing special but definitely gets the job done and filling. The wings were a little dry but well covered in buffalo sauce. I would say if you are looking for a good chain restaurant with various beer choices and a great selections, it's well worth taking a stop by at least once!"
Kerri B.,"Long Beach, CA",134,128,39,4.0,2/9/2013,"Excellent selection here! The food isn't amazing, but it's good. I had the California burger here, which was really good, but the Jalapeño burger was dry and flavor-less. I've had pizza here that was tasty as well. I had some type of avocado rolls as an appetizer, but I'd skip them in the future. This is definitely a place to go when you have many tastes amongst your group or an undeceive group, as they have plenty of choices. Their bar is nice and the dessert choices are good- if you have room after your meal. This location is at The Loop, which I've mentioned in other reviews as a place full of kids. Lots of kids may not bother most, but I'm a teacher in the area and don't enjoy running into students everywhere I go. Save your trips to The Loop for week nights and you'll get more enjoyment from this place :)"
Kimberly D.,"Tampa, FL",15,40,16,3.0,10/31/2012,"I was happy to finally try something at BJ's restaurant.  Comfortable atmosphere.  The French Dip was ok, but  the fries were tasty.  They do serve a great sweet tea."
Joe M.,"Kissimmee, FL",6,27,58,2.0,1/1/2013,"OK its New Years day at 6:30 P.M. but soggy tostito chips, no wiessen beer, not a mushroom in sight on the flat bread, 2.5 hours between arrival; seating; service and leaving. Have been fond of the place up until today...never again for dinner. AND smoking allowed ,and encouraged of the bar patrons, outside the front door in the over flow waitting area."
Philip C.,"Brandon, FL",108,145,11,4.0,7/28/2014,"Solid beer and solid food makes for a great lunch! Burgers were yummy and the tacos were sweet and tangy. I had there Amber ale and my brother had their pale ale, both us were happy with our choices. They have great lunch specials that I would recommend as well. They have a dynamic atmosphere where they are able to meet the needs of the older crowd and the younger crowd as well."
Chris P.,"Orlando, FL",0,2,,5.0,12/25/2015,"One of the best for beer and food, excellent variety for all taste buds... The bartender Andrew is awesome, he's always on top of things and very good at taking care of business."
Amanda M.,"Clermont, FL",3,21,,2.0,9/22/2015,"Not all NFL games are available. The corporation buys only what they think are the most popular games, instead if a full season pass in an attempt to save money. Better call if you're going there for any regular season game and make sure they have yours. Also, the happy hour appetizers are a limited list and anything with meat isn't half price, it's just discounted. Food is typical meh food service. Staff is nice but there's a reason they're always hiring."
Bill P.,"Jensen Beach, FL",1,10,,5.0,12/15/2014,Stopped there for lunch on our way home from Disney. Excellent service and even better food. The deep dish pizza was incredible. Prices are reasonable. We will definitely make it a point to eat there again when we visit Orlando.
Alex L.,"Miami, FL",60,34,13,3.0,7/28/2014,What can I say about this place. It looked really promising. The place looks decked out. The server was really good. I didn't really enjoy the pizza because it looks like it was a frozen costco deep dish pizza and was kind of pricey. My family seemed to have enjoyed their meal. Maybe I will come back and give it another shot and order another dish.
Jo B.,"Kissimmee, FL",125,2,,2.0,6/14/2014,"Made an Yelp account just to make a review about this place. TERRIBLE SERVICE. I would warn you about the waitress that provided this subpar service, but she didn't even tell us her name. The 2 stars are strictly based on the cheeseburger that I ordered and the delicious dessert. Besides the food, absolutely terrible. Won't be dining here in the near future."
Christy P.,"New Port Richey, FL",1,8,,3.0,12/5/2014,"This restaurant provided a nice outdoor atmosphere for our work function. The service, however, wasn't optimal. Our party of 17 was only given 1 server. The incorrect food was brought to the table, and we had to ask multiple times for drinks. The food was better than just your typical bar food however."
Arynn I.,"Mililani, HI",292,416,217,4.0,8/15/2010,"Yup, still like it!  I again, had the Root Beer and even got one to go when I was leaving! Tried one of the mini appetizers, bruschetta. I really like the pesto sauce that they serve with the bruschetta. Yum. Again, had a mini pizza- the sweet hawaiian pizza...Ugh, just cause it has pineapple doesn't make it hawaiian.  Anyways, it was still delish! I do enjoy eating here. It makes my tastebuds smile."
Joanna R.,"Washington, DC",91,171,,4.0,3/6/2012,"For a chain restaurant, this place was pretty good. I went to BJ's on my final night in Florida with my mother, sister and two aunts. We were seated right away in a spacious booth in the back.   The selection of beers on tap was a very welcome surprise with selections ranging from their own brews to Yuengling. And bottled beers?! This was even more of a surprise both for their selection of imported beers and affordability.  The food menu is extensive- pizza, burgers, salads, pasta. Most entrees are priced around $10. We ordered salads and burgers, everyone was satisfied and enjoyed their choices. Even though the portions looked massive each of us completely finished our meals.  Our server was great, even took pictures for us at the end of the dinner. Overall, nice way to end my trip!"
Carlos A.,"Orlando, FL",39,37,8,1.0,11/9/2014,The employee walk around like they don't care especially the take our guy I believe his name is Daniel!!! Comes out chewing food and has horrible body language. Management really needs to take a look at this place. I used to come here all the time and this will be my last time coming. To bad the place was great at one time.
Todd P.,"Kissimmee, FL",53,4,18,5.0,1/15/2010,"Well when my family and I tried BJ Brewhouse for the first time we were a little leery. We really didn't know what to expect from a new restaurant from Santa Ana, California. To our surprise the host and the servers were top class and efficient.  My family have come to love the friendly service and great food that BJ's has to offer. So the next time you decide on a restaurant keep BJ's on your list of choices. And definitely try BJ's Flatbread appetizer Pizzas (California Club) LoL we order it every time we go to BJ's it is wonderful."
Michelle C.,"Kissimmee, FL",5,13,4,4.0,6/6/2012,"For me, BJ's is about the pizzas and the beer. Although, their other menu items are also worth trying but these 2 items are definitely their highlights.  I love coming here for happy hour mostly to eat. I believe it's 4-7 on weekdays and then maybe 9 til closing. During Happy Hour their appetizers are all 50% off and so are their mini deep dish pizzas. Totally bang for the buck at this point. Their drinks aren't discounted as much as their food during this time but it's still cheaper than the regular prices.  I like their Bacon Cheeseburger Mini Deep Dish Pizza. It tastes exactly like a BACON CHEESEBURGER. The toppings include: sausage, bacon, red onions, pickles, and cheese. I believe the marinara sauce on the pizza acts as ketchup.  During Happy Hour it's only $5.00. If you don't want so much carb, you can also go for their flatbreads. Also, discounted during HH. I like their Chicken Club and Chicken Pesto. The Shrimp Lettuce Wrap is really good. A tiny bit spicy but really yummy and low cal. The Ahi Poke. When I first had this, the quality of the Tuna was good. It tasted fresh and the portion size was good for appetizer. It's also around $5.00 during Happy Hour. Comes with fried wonton chips on the side to scoop up the tuna. I don't know what happened, but recently, their fish quality went down. It's completely noticeable and I refuse to order it anymore. The Beers: I'm not an expert in beer but I was determined to try every specialty beer they carried at BJ's. So I just went down the list every time I went back to Bj's. I really like the Blonde Beer. It's not as bitter as the lagers, good flavor still, and refreshing."
Kai R.,"Elgin, IL",125,345,55,5.0,7/10/2014,"I love BJ's food and atmosphere, but I am feeling it is not for families with young kids. It has nothing to do with the staff, but the other people that come here to eat. They look annoyed, when our kids are too loud, start crying or even look in their direction. Again, we get that in most restaurants. I love BJ's food! It is a chain, but it feels like you are eating at a diner. A great place to eat!"
Brad B.,"St. Cloud, FL",1,2,,5.0,9/13/2014,"Wow they have happy hour pricing for all nfl games! Sunday, Monday night and Thursday nights."
