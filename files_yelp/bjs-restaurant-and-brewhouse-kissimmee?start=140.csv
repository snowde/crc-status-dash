Darrius T.,"Clearwater, FL",98,3,,5.0,7/29/2014,Great service and even better food!!!! The cook made a mistake on my order instead of throwing the food away the manger gave us both orders the mistake and the correct order... The waitress was great
Ivette R.,"Miami, FL",268,1047,251,5.0,10/6/2014,I should've been yelping for a long time even though I've been yelping for a year and yelp started in 2006 or a little earlier.I actually came to this location in December of 2008 which was 6 years ago.I went with the family on a Friday night place was poppin a lot of people for Happy Hour and for dinner this BJ'S is located on Osceola Pkwy Kissimmee in The Loop the parking is spacious but can be an issue.So anyway we sat down that day and were greeted by our waiter and he was really nice if I wish could remember his name all of our food was great that day
George S.,"Hagerstown, MD",2,34,,5.0,5/7/2014,The food and the beer was excellent. The  Bartender Andrew's personality was fantastic he knew his beer. I would definitely recommend this restaurant even if you're not a beer drinker.
Allie C.,"Winter Garden, FL",114,2,,5.0,6/4/2014,I go here at least 2 times a week and never have a problem. The food is out of this world and I always get the salted caramel pizookie because it is the best!! Love the service! Love the food!
Suzanne P.,"St. Albans, United Kingdom",5,3,14,5.0,5/31/2014,Great food and wine and excellent service and had a thoroughly enjoyable evening. Interesting set up with all the TV sets. Good value for money.
Regina V.,"Madison, WI",0,20,,4.0,12/29/2014,"This is a mall restaurant, which was packed at 7:30 on a Monday night! After a short wait, we were seated in an awesome circular  booth. Service was prompt. Highly recommend the watermelon feta salad - delicious! I had the lighter fare scallops - very good and simple. My kids had the spaghetti with meatballs - great! The garlic bread served with it was yummy. My hubby had fish tacos, which he deemed very good. Also, my mojito was just right. My husband had the Hefeweizen, which he enjoyed. High marks!! Fast service and very kid-friendly."
Dan G.,"Hollywood, FL",43,50,45,2.0,8/18/2011,"By the name, you would think any GUY would like this place but I have to say to me it was just meh... It is incredibly loud, probably due to hardwood floors and high ceilings. They have an extensive selection of beer so if your into that you will probably enjoy. I am more of a martini drinker and can't drink beer due to the carbonation so I went to try the food. This turned out to be a mistake... The menu is large and the wait staff thinks you should know what you want within the first 3 minutes of sitting down. I ordered spinach and artichoke dip as a starter to keep the waiter busy while I looked over the menu. I ended up getting a BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad and it was sub-par from other restaurants I have had it at. There was some sort of vegi in the salad that was like bamboo and the salad could have done without it, whatever it was.  To sum it up, don't go thinking you will be pleasured in the end cause you'll end up let down and wanting something more. I will pass on it in the future for sure..."
Rhema A.,"Anchorage, AK",0,9,2,2.0,3/5/2016,"Just to start I was honestly expecting some good food because I always have a preconceived notion that breweries will have above average food. Especially bar type food like buffalo wings and drinks. Well I was beyond unimpressed with this place. I had the buffalo chicken grilled cheese sandwich. Not only was it blatantly obvious that my food had been sitting for quite a while, the cheese was hard already and the bread a bit soggy, but it was also obvious that the chicken was definitely NOT made in house. It tasted like  frozen buffalo chicken from a bag. In addition to this, I had a strawberry lemonade alcoholic beverage, I can't remember the name, which was straight alcohol and ice and tasted like straight alcohol or watered down alcohol. The service was nice enough but we sat for white a while before ordering and when waiting for the check. I wouldn't recommend this place and definitely will not be returning."
Ciara T.,"Clinton, MD",0,4,2,4.0,8/8/2015,"First time visit here, and it was great. Reminds me of Cheesecake Factory. Service was great and so was the food. Our server Terrance was great and quick. I would definitely go back. The prices were reasonable not cheap it not unbearable."
Mimi L.,"Philadelphia, PA",135,272,1941,3.0,8/19/2013,"This place is nice. Great food. The waitress was great. But when the food was served the food runners or servers came to deliver. We had a party of 12. And the foods got mixed-up. I had ordered the corn fritters (delicious). The appetizer sampler was good too. The main course for my husband and I were the ribs and chicken meal. All was dandy until I cut into the chicken. The chicken was not fully cooked. Smoked chicken is not fleshy pink when you cut towards the center of the chicken. The waitress looked and said ""she'll get her manager."" This probably happens a lot there. The manager came back with it looks like that because its smoked but I'll have them cook it for another 7 minutes. To me if the chicken is fully cooked why would you have to cook it for another 7 minutes. I end-up not eating that but just ate my sides and took the chicken home and didn't eat it. We spent $255 on 6 adults and 6 kids. Gave a $60 tip. Was not looking for hand-outs or freebies. Just felt like it was a typical line that was used to go back to cook the chicken longer so they were not at fault for serving raw chicken. The desserts were great. Tiny cookies serviced with ice cream. Chocolate, red velvet and rasphberry and white chocolate cake like cookies in individual cookie tins. That was good."
Joe M.,"Winter Garden, FL",13,98,192,2.0,2/23/2014,"Have not been back in a while to this location...service was great the food was ok.. Pork sandwich was a little cold,coke slaw was not good... The bathrooms needed attention the smell am over flowing urine is horrible..outside waiting area was horrible with cigarettes butts am over flowing garbage cans ..2 pm lunch on a Sunday and they looked understaffed with a few open tables and a wait times o 15 to 25 mins...I think I will pass this place if we are in area again ....."
Chris V.,"Rosemount, MN",0,8,,5.0,6/30/2014,"The hospitality at this restaurant was simply amazing!    I have a vegan diet and didn't see anything on the menu but really wanted the brew pub atmosphere.   When I called and talked with Melissa she indicated that their pasta had egg, but that brown rice would be a great option with some vegetables.   I sent a list of veggies via e-mail and Melissa confirmed with the chef that a vegetable stir fry could be prepared for me.    Upon arrival, I asked for Melissa who had my request and ensured that it was sent to the kitchen.   When the dish arrived it was amazing!   It included: Mushrooms, Jalapeno Pepper, Onion, Scallion, Red & Green Peppers, Ginger, Spinach, Pine Nuts, Carrots and Garlic stir fried in a light oil served over brown rice. I'd recommend BJ's to anybody looking for a restaurant that truly cares about creating a great guest experience."
Stephen O.,"Austin, TX",280,111,194,5.0,7/3/2011,"My only complaint is not really even a complaint, it was the servers voice and way she ended each sentence like on a high pitch, as though we were a couple of toddlers. Aside from that the service was great, we had someone come by and remove plates as soon as they noticed I was finished (even appeared to be another server). Hand crafted beers were a nice touch and I enojyed the atmosphere very much, what a great find."
Daniel C.,"Gainesville, VA",330,139,188,2.0,6/7/2011,Was hoping this place was going to be GREAT.. but as for our experience... was terrible.. food took over 30 mins to come out.. maybe 40 mins... that's just sad. and the food wasn't even spectacular or anything. The table next to us also got all their food wrong. Cold. Tastes funny... just bad experience overall here. Maybe next time will have to give it another shot. But definitely going to ask for another server. Cuz ours didn't even apologize for taking forevers to get our food. The decor is nice. The beer is good. That's about it.
Jeff G.,"Rockledge, FL",48,9,3,4.0,2/22/2014,Tina is a great bar tender.  Awesome food.  Beer prices can be on the high side except for happy hour which is in effect for any NFL game.  Saturday night can be very crowded and loud.  My favorite place near Kissimmee!
Athena B.,"Poinciana, FL",0,21,11,4.0,4/29/2014,Great crafted beers and wonderful food! Great lunch menu also! Very friendly and helpful staff. Lots of tv's so you can watch looking in most directions. Will definitely come here again
Betty J.,"Miami Beach, FL",66,154,435,5.0,5/18/2013,"LOVE THE HAPPY HOUR!  I come here for late 1/2 lunch and a beer and thank you to the cute manager for the FREE beer :)  The bartenders are always sweet & very cute this is my new local favorite, there are always friendly people at the bar."
Trajan N.,"Irvine, CA",118,146,150,4.0,5/14/2013,I've really come to like this place. The interior is modern and the food menu is diverse. The food quality is consistent also. Service is always great. No complaints.
Katarina M.,"Sunnyvale, CA",14,104,14,5.0,8/9/2011,"Come here for the yummy food. Nothing gourmet, but all just good hearty food. My family and I come here very frequently. Service is usually spot-on. We've had a waiter or two who were less than perfect, but in general, service is good. Alright so back to the food. Dishes we've tried and loved: Parmesan Crusted Chicken (comes w/ broccoli and delicious white cheddar mashed potatoes)...the deep dish pizzas including the Great White (alfredo, garlic, chicken, mushrooms, tomatoes, Parmesan) and the Sweet pig (ham, pineapple, tomatoes), BJ's Favorite, Buffalo Chicken, and the Tomato and Cheese...the flatbread pizza appetizers (we like all of them except the sausage one is really skimpy on the sausage...the Margherita, the California Club, and the Grilled Chicken Pesto are all good.)...Italian Market Salad...Grilled Steak Salad...BBQ Pulled pork sandwich, Balsamic Glazed Chicken... Dishes that we haven't liked so much: New Orleans Jambalaya, avocado roll appetizers (way too much avocado), BBQ beef sandwich (it was ok, just not great like our other usuals). AND THE BEST PART OF THE MEAL...DESSERT: pizookie. A pizza cookie. They make the cookies in the dip dish tins that they make the pizza in. So you have a large cookie, topped with a big scoop of ice cream.  Yummmmm. We really like the chocolate chip, the Ghirardelli triple chocolate, the peanut butter, the Oreo...I always get the peanut butter with chocolate ice cream (usually comes with vanilla). We tried the red velvet one one time when it first came out, didn't really like it. Oh the white chocolate macadamia nut one is good too. Also the Apple Berry Crumble is really good. Just a good place to come. Oh, also, no one in my family is really a beer lover (parents don't drink), but they also make their own Root Beer and it's really good."
Britt C.,"Orlando, FL",91,76,8,4.0,12/3/2013,"Been to this location only once but will definitely return.  Sat at the bar and the bartenders were very attentive and helpful. I had the Mahi tacos and they were really good. They didn't come with the chips like it said on the menu and the only reason I noticed was because another guest down a few spots ordered the same thing and actually got the chips. Oh well, I didn't need them anyway the tacos were filling enough by themselves.  I ordered a margarita that said it was made with fresh juices so I decided to try it being the super picky margarita drinker that I am that hates sour mix. I can honestly say that is the only time I have ever returned anything at a restaurant and felt terrible about it but it was literally like drinking lime syrup, definitely wasn't fresh lime. Oh well, guess I learned that I should stick with beer while at BJ's because that is always good."
