Clara S.,"Orlando, FL",38,270,39,4.0,5/15/2011,"Yay! I'm a fan of the Beer!!! I'd give it a 3 for the food as of the last visit though.   Let's talk about the Beer first,.. they have a pretty decent selection ranging from their own brews to many hard to find as well.  Was very impressed last time I was there. As for the food,.. I had a calzone the filling wasn't what you would find in an Italian place nor was the crust??, but then again I was not at an Italian place was I? My friend has the pizza, now that was pretty amazing I had to say myself! Another one had the Jambalaya,... I had some it was decent but nothing to write home about. This place is very popular,... every time I have gone at night there is a wait just be prepared!"
N B.,"Orlando, FL",18,267,38,2.0,5/22/2011,"This will be a quick review....  out of 5 stars greeting: 5 stars   (Hostess where very welcoming)  Food: 4 stars     ( food was good) service: 2 stars  ( I think our waitress  was in the weeds, so we didn't get  the best service out there, i saw her like 3 times all night) bartender: 0 stars  (obnoxious  and loud for no reason, I was seating at a table next to the bar, and he was yelling all night like he needed some attention)"
Christine C.,"Kissimmee, FL",0,17,2,4.0,7/21/2013,It is very good considering its a chain. My favorite is the Pizookie. Ice cream on a warm cookie. The food is fine. I read some negative reviews.....hello people its a chain not a 5 star restaurant.
Libby W.,"Orlando, FL",504,296,74,4.0,11/16/2010,"Since my last review of this location service has improved 100 percent, however we have had the same server twice in a row now, So she may just be the best server there and we are getting lucky but I'm happy to report that we haven't had the terrible service we've had in the past. Bj's has an extensive menu in which they have just added several more dishes. The place surely has something for everyone. We had the new Ahi Poke appetizer. The ahi was good, light in flavor, and would appeal to those who don't want to get stuffed. It's served with chopped up lettuce and wheat tortilla type chips. My only complaint would be there are too many chips for the amount of ahi you get.  Another new item on their menu is the Pork Chop Entree which comes with two Porkchops, marinated teriyaki apples,  green beans, mash potatoes, and a small amount of stone ground mustard on the side. Delicious. The apples with the pork really work well together. The mustard is wonderful but can be a bit over powering at times but over all wonderfully done. I'm also a fan of their fish tacos, the avocado and southwest rolls. They have some great sandwiches and for dessert you can't pass up the pizookie."
ed P.,"Jackson Heights, NY",3,107,45,3.0,5/24/2013,"Ordered a variety of things here and the order came out late and backwards, cold entrees, then the salad and finally the appetizer  WTF!!!  OOps. Ironically, the managers were very apologetic and accommodating.  They really did try but were having a  bad staff day. I have been out enough to know it happens.  They credited several items on the check so we knew that they were sincere.   The burger was delicious but a little cold.   The chicken marsala was tasty but overcooked with soggy green beans, I like mine a little crispy or crunchy; these probably came from a can.  The dip was tasty but late.  The beer flight was fantastic. All that being said, the food was well prepared and well seasoned.  Everything tasted fresh.  I will return on my next trip to try another burger."
Natasha S.,"Homestead, FL",1,4,3,1.0,6/1/2013,"Second time I try a BJs Brew house and I have finally learned my lesson.  Having to ask a passing waitress for side plates after the appetizer was delivered should have been a good sign to run screaming. 45 minutes later we get a cold overcooked burger (and the lame ""the burgers are so thick it takes longer"" excuse was more insulting than anything especially since they weren't even that thick). The delivery of the mayo and ketchup after we had already given up eating was ridiculous.    At least the waiter's admission that he just plain forgot about the garlic bread was refreshing.  Never again for ANY of them - consider yourself warned."
Carolyn S.,"Miami, FL",0,6,,2.0,3/26/2015,"Good beer,  crappy service.   And since when is there oil in an au jus for a french dip.  WTH?"
Bonnie I.,"Oriskany, NY",52,32,7,1.0,3/17/2013,"We only came here because we had a party of 7 and thought it a safe choice. We were told a wait of 30 min.....but when they finally seated us at a small round table we were too squished, so we ended up sitting at the bar area anyway. 30 min wasted. When we finally ordered, it took over 30 min for our food to come out, and then it did in stages...2 orders at a time. Burgers were overcooked.....potato wedges were ok. All in all I wouldn't go back."
Chris B.,"Mason, MI",30,3,14,3.0,11/4/2013,"The overall atmosphere of this place was very welcoming. We shared a Great Beginnings platter of appetizers, and each ordered a soup and salad combo. Everything was very good, but the pacing was not relaxed. We had barely started on the appetizers, and they brought out all the other food. We felt rushed, the server seemed to hover around our table just waiting for us to finish. I didn't think that was necessary considering it was a Monday before 6 pm and there were only about 4 other tables filled."
Janice J.,"Lucan, MN",0,2,,2.0,2/22/2014,"Not impressed.  I had the roast beef dip and husband had a bacon cheese burger.  Both were VERY dry and flavorless.  We did enjoy the corn fritter appetizer, this is the only reason I gave them a 2 star.  Also, not a place you want to go if you don't like to wait.  Not sure if the price of microbrew is more than the norm, but they ran 5.75 each and well drinks were 6.75 which I believe is very high."
S W.,"Christiansburg, VA",0,99,47,3.0,1/2/2015,"Busy on  12/27/14 around 4. Our first visit.  Told 10 minute wait and it was nice enough to sit outside.  We finally were seated and took several minutes to be greeted by server, Heather.  Heather was personable and answered questions.We asked for recommendations on the menu.  The menu is large and hard to decide.  BJs crafts some of the sodas. Heather recommended the orange cream soda.  It was horrid and had an alka seltzer aftertaste.  The black cherry was good enough to get a refill. Daughter had cheese mini pizza which she said was delicious.  Me and hubs had BJs Favorite pizza no black olives.  It was good but nothing special.  It is thick and has to be eaten with utensils.  The pzookies were very good also.  The restaurant is nice, clean,  and bathrooms were clean.  Dinner for three came in at $75."
Sarah H.,"Orlando, FL",124,215,5,5.0,2/6/2013,"Gluten free pizza is amazing :-) they have a decent gluten free menu, including a berry burst cider and redbridge beer."
Krissy M.,"Sarasota, FL",663,833,22,5.0,10/8/2010,"Many a date night were spent here when we lived in Orlando. Always consistent fast and friendly service, paired with yummy food, no matter what you order!  We particularly enjoyed the pizzas (seriously, you cannot go wrong) but also enjoyed open-faced sandwiches, the nachos, avocado egg rolls and of course, their famous pizzokie. What is a pizookie, you may ask?  Well, it's a deep dish cookie 'pizza' served in a cast iron little serving platter topped with indulgent complementary ice cream.  Ahhhh, yes, chocolate chip ala mode with vanilla bean...ghiradelli double chocolate with, yup, you guessed it, more chocolate!  Muhahah!  The best way to experience this taste sensation is to order the triple serving, that gives you three minis to choose from, like the oatmeal, peanut butter, chocolate chip and double chocolate!  Best of all, as it is indicated in the menu, a percentage of proceeds generated from the sale of this dessert go to charity, so dig in and pat yourself on the back for helping out others =)"
Amanda J.,"Davenport, FL",4,77,,4.0,3/11/2011,"If your near the Loop in Kissimmee this is a great place to try.  It has a great happy hour from 3-7pm.  All of their appetizers are 1/2 price and great drink specials as well. We sat at the bar on a Monday afternoon and had a very lively bartender wait on us.  Either he loves his job or he is a very good actor.  Very knowledgable about the food and all the drinks.   I tried the fried artichokes which were great.  Becareful of the dipping sauce...yummy but full of garlic. I also tried the shrimp lettuce wraps.  I wasn't sure how these would be but was pleasantly surpised.  All the ingredients were fresh and the shrimp was cooked well.  The sauce is excellent.  I really enjoyed these. My boyfriend had one of the mini deep dish pizzas that are also on the half price app menu.  He had the loaded one and really enjoyed it.  It had a crispy crust with a gooey middle. The chicken potstickers were certainly good but nothing spectacular.  Next time I go I would probably skip those just because I liked the other things better. I don't drink beer so I can't talk about those but they have a large selection and will let you ""try before you buy"".  I do how ever like Root Beer and the one they have on tap is goooood."
Marvin M.,"Kissimmee, FL",134,273,265,3.0,3/27/2013,"I am one of ""those people"" that stays away from anything that resembles a chain or that is a chain. But when there is family in town and friends who want to come to places like this i cannot say no. Plus a piece of me is curious about what the big deal is. When in with wifey and @xobejm. Place was packed. Service was okay. I ordered the Jambalaya, but i requested more heat. I needed it to be more spicy. The server looked at me like I was strange. I guess no one had made this request before. He went in the back and came back and said the chef will do it. I said awesome. The jambalaya came out and i took a bite and it was nice and spicy. La Familia had the usual, pizza, flatbread, pasta. The food is pretty good. It is a bit pricey, but the portions are big."
Patrick B.,"Jensen Beach, FL",0,2,,1.0,12/13/2015,"This place has always been one of my family's all time favorite places for eating, however today we encountered a number of problems. First off it took 45 minutes to get our food. Only 3 out of 4 dinners came out. And one of the dinners was the completely wrong one. It took an extra 20 minutes to get our last dish and then another 10 minutes to get our food that was sent back for being wrong, and when it came back the chicken was very raw. We weren't offered anything as gratitude, and we were charged twice for one of the dishes we had once. We were expected to pay for the full dinner that was an absolute abortion. The manager didn't feel the need to say a single thing to us and that reflects on the professionalism of a restaurant. We were very disappointed and nobody cared at all. You couldn't pay me to go back to this poor excuse you call a restaurant. They lost loyal customers for life."
Cristal C.,"Orlando, FL",4,13,8,3.0,8/6/2014,I have been to other bj's and enjoy their food. However I came to this Bj's for lunch and the service was very slow. A lot of us ordered soup & salad and it took almost 20 minutes.  Not sure how long it takes to make a Cesar salad & already made soup .... But I wouldn't come here if you want a quick lunch.  The pizookie however is always on point.
John R.,"Apopka, FL",20,45,4,5.0,11/2/2012,Best mash potatoes I have ever had!  The Parmesan crusted chicken was also awesome. I normally don't eat chicken when dining out but I will be back for more next time I'm around a BJ's.
John S.,"Orlando, FL",10,35,22,2.0,5/23/2010,"My daughter and I were out running errands and I decided to stop at this one for lunch. I usually meet friends at the Conroy location and this was my first time visiting this one.  The place was basically dead that afternoon so waitstaff standing around and helping each other out, well almost everyone except for our server.  I'm sorry, but even though I haven't posted a poor review this location is going to be my first. The service was just lousy. Granted, it could have been someones first day, but we were the only ones in their section, maybe their rhythm was off a bit. Dunno. We bussed our own dishes and they sat at the edge of the table for 15 minutes or 10 passes by our server - yes I was keeping score. For a $$ price tag for this place you would expect something that would keep you coming back.  We won't be going back to this location for a while and will temporarily place it in the same category as Friday's - which they do favor only with more seating and updated amenities in the dining room. I'll update my review if I do."
Matt M.,"Fort Worth, TX",9,1,,2.0,6/30/2013,Came with family in vacation. They forgot to put my hamburger on the grill and everyone else's food was cold. The manager offered to remake all the food with no offer for any type of compensation.
