Chris V.,"Orlando, FL",66,10,,5.0,5/28/2013,We went the other night with a large group (20+). We had 2 servers who split responsibilities for the table and they did awesome. Not one person had an issue with their food or waiting for anything. One of the servers even chatted with us for awhile while we were watching the Miami heat playoff game! Def would recommend this location again to our friends when the visit from Miami again.
Tim J.,"Venice, FL",8,28,2,4.0,12/12/2012,"Great food and really great craft beers, the menu is enormous and they let you mix match and create your custom order.  There is a ton of their house brews plus domestic and foreign beers to choose from, so you have endless possibilities to try.  Great ambiance and a decent price however being pricier isn't a bad thing I always would rather pay more to enjoy my dining experience without screaming children and non involved parents that are usually attracted to the cheaper establishments.  All in all BJ's brewhouse is worth it give them a try"
Henry W.,"Gainesville, FL",0,41,,4.0,7/11/2012,"Have been here a number of times in larger groups and found the noise level over the top.  Last visit we came at 11:30 and beat some of the rush.  Took a booth at the front and it was very pleasant.  The lunch menu was very moderately priced with an excellent fried chicken for $6 my wife had the potato and soup and it was more than she could finish.  Pleasant atmosphere, very clean, comfortable seating.  Worth a visit."
Shawn S.,"Kissimmee, FL",0,6,,5.0,9/23/2014,"They have a great happy hour during football season. Half price appetizers and drink specials during the games. The bartender Tina was also very nice and helpful. I would definitely go back. Good craft beer selection, my favorite is the Jeremiah Red."
Caroline J.,"Kissimmee, FL",4,22,,5.0,2/20/2013,"I love this place. The food is really good with a lot of options (the menu is close to Cheesecake Factory proportions), the beer selection is amazing- the sampler flights are fun, and there are plenty of good cocktails if you're not feeling beer. Prices are moderately high but reasonable, especially when you consider that the portions are huge. I like the brewpub-style decor and ambiance, booths are comfortable and tables are large enough to accomodate more than a salad plate. It gets noisy but that's just about every casual dining restaurant. I've had really good service and just okay service, but never poor service. Overall, this is a great place in an area where good restaurants are few and far between."
nicholas n.,"Orlando, FL",26,62,14,3.0,8/29/2010,The Beer here has quite of bit of different kinds you could say. I like the Pear beer of some sort that i had a few months ago. I think i am going to stop out here in a couple of days to find out exactly what kind that was. hehe Very nice inside and out. Very roomy and nice selection on appetizer's and entree's. Happy Hour is after 10 p.m.  Service was okay but could use some work on being more attentive. I will try this place at least one more time to give my final thought. Let's see how that goes. :)
Jim B.,"Celebration, FL",85,125,42,5.0,3/14/2014,Thanks to Yelp I found this BJ's.  I have been another BJ's in the Orlando area but have driven by this multiple times and didn't even realize it was right in front of my nose.  With the vast menu there should be no reason you leave here hungry. I had the appetizer pot stickers that were very good along with a pint of the abbey normal beer.  I had plenty to eat just with those 2 items.  My wife ordered the Parmesan Chicken that had a chardonnay  butter cream sauce that was absolutely delicious. Our server Sonya was one of the best servers we have had in a long time.   She went out of her way to make sure our experience was perfect.  (we had to tip 30% she was so good).  Since I had gotten full I didn't get to try 2 other beers I had wanted to.  Sonya brought me a taste of both beers so I can make an informed decision next time.  We also told her Bj's was a longer drive than what we like to drive to and we were only in the neck of the woods because of a shopping need.  She told us about a new BJ's that is closer to our house that opened a few months ago.  We will be going to BJ's a lot more often.  If only Sonya was there.
Darrell O.,"Winter Park, FL",0,15,1,3.0,2/27/2013,"Arrived around dinner time. The service was pretty good, she had our beer out to us rather fast, and friendly. I ordered the jambalaya, which was very good and extremely spicy. I would return to this location. The beer and wine selection is wonderful."
Chef Oj C.,"Miami Beach, FL",52,100,18,3.0,6/27/2012,"Great place to hang out and eat an ok meal, they do have a good selection of domestic and foreign beers. Its a bit pricey for the quality of the plates they offer. The way I see it would be like an overprice imitation of the Ale house."
Natasha C.,"Eugene, OR",131,229,113,4.0,7/8/2009,"Try the root beer-- it's excellent! There's a good variety to the menu, and we've always had good service when there-- look and see what their specials are from day to day, as you can get a good deal and eat well for not a lot of money. Their loaded baked potatoes are really good and HUGE. Yes, the microbrew beers are a bit pricey if you're used to drinking crap beer, but they're worth it. If you're not sure you'll like them, there are the samplers available for a smaller price. Personally, I've liked most of the ones I've tried so far, and I'm not a big fan of ""standard"" domestic beer. If you like darker beers, try the Jeremiah Red or the Tatonka Stout. I also like their Hefeweisen and some of the seasonal beers they've had lately."
Peter G.,"Orlando, FL",69,21,,4.0,1/4/2013,"Large scale menu a'la Cheesecake factory, with some good fresh ideas. Another place been to a handful of times without ever having to send anything back. Small pizzas very good."
Julie L.,"Orlando, FL",35,13,4,1.0,1/27/2015,"My hubby and i often go to bj's by the millenia mall. Over there service is great. Never had any problem. But this location sucks. I heard so much bad things about this bj's but never went there until two day ago. And yes service is terrible!!!! I had the worst service ever. And that was the 1st time i tipped that bad. Usually if service is horrible but nice, i would still tip 15 to 18% but this time was not even 10% and still that's way too much for the way she acted. I should have even called out the manager. Our server gave us attitude the whole time especially when we asked questions about the food. Then we saw her smiling and being nice to her other customers. Later, she came back to our table to grab the plates. And right after she left, not even 30 second after, she made her coworker give us the check because she supposedly went to the bathroom? Wth!!! And the register was located right behind us! That night wasn't even a busy night. My hubby and i even noticed that the server of the table behind us was really rude too."
Mike S.,"Orlando, FL",22,55,21,4.0,6/7/2009,"We really like this place.  The food is good.  The menu is huge!  You could take anybody there and find something to eat- salads to meatloaf to pizza.  We have tried a little bit of everything and have always liked it. The place is a little expensive though.  Especially if you want to try the beers.  I understand that they are micro-brewed, which I love,  but $6 for a draft is a little steep.   Anyway, very good place.  Try the pizookie for dessert.  Huge cookie treat to share."
Kaila J.,"Orlando, FL",61,96,79,3.0,2/14/2011,Great Tuna Poki and Avocado rolls were great! Fish tacos were okay. Slow service and staff in not knowledgeable about menu items.
Katie K.,"Groveland, FL",5,28,5,3.0,2/29/2012,"This is the third time I've dined here. The food is just okay and since I don't drink the beer is not a draw for me. On Feb 26, we took some out of town guests there and the service was awful. It took at least 30 minutes to get our food and barely saw our waitress during the visit. I would expect this if the restaurant was crowded, but it was actually a slow night. I gave it three stars because we've never had a problem with the service before."
Scott P.,"Brewster, NY",21,112,8,5.0,3/19/2011,"One of my favorite things about my annual trip to Florida is going to the chain-you-have-never-heard-of restaurant.  Why stick with popular chains like Chili's and Red Lobster when you can make your way to a BJ's or an Abuelo's?  You can pretend you're in a neat trendy bistro, even when you're stuck in Chainland, Florida. Anyway, BJ's was a really pleasant surprise.  There was a 45 minute wait, and we decided to stick it out.  They served us beers while waiting and gave us some really great deep dish pizza samples.  Very thoughtful.  Maybe it was just that I was hungry, but it was among the best deep dishes I have had. We snuck into a table at the bar once one opened up.  The bar is cool spot with a big wall of TV's - great for watching a game.  Our server was excellent and attentive.  Nice selection of their own beers.  I went with the Brown Lager and the Porter...both were really tasty. Went with the flat bread pizza appetizer - nice choice.  For dinner, the choice was tough.  Their menu was a extensive and a bit overreaching.  I went out on a limb and went with the pot roast.  Even better choice - the pot roast was tender and melts in your mouth. Even though I was stuffed to the gills, I had to try to pizookie.  Now, I don't OMG much, but OMG.  Warm white chocoloate macadamia cookie in a pie tin topped with ample amounts of ice cream.  Right up my alley. Highly recommended.  So...next time you're in Florida, why go with that tired chain restaurant you've been to a million times?  Chain it up in a new way with BJ's!"
John F.,"Orlando, FL",15,16,,5.0,10/8/2009,"There is one reason to go to BJ's Brewhouse. It's not the deepdish pizza, which is excellent, it's not the jambalaya, which will rock your taste buds, it's not the hamburgers, which will redefine for you what you think of as a hamburger. It's not even the microbrewed beers, for which BJ's is justifiably famous (Try the Red Ale or the Heffeweisen).  No, none of those excellent features are the reason to come to BJ's. It's just one word, Pizzookie. It's a cookie (your choice), baked in a pizza tin, served hot and topped with ice cream. Heaven! The location can get busy, so take advantage of the call ahead seating or enjoy the wait in the bar area."
Christopher G.,"Homestead, FL",10,5,,5.0,8/19/2012,"YET ANOTHER Great BJ's that Ive been to. Fantastic food and atmosphere right in the emerging ""The Loop"" area on Osceola. Food was fantastic as always. GREAT place to go for sports and great food and some great beer."
Rachel F.,"Orlando, FL",134,10,,3.0,8/20/2011,"Cool atmosphere, good for grabbing some beers and an appetizer. Beer selection is very good. Eh--- Food- not so great, or hot. Burger definitely sat under heat lamp for a good 15 minutes I'd say by the looks of it. Also came on a greasy, toasted thick piece of bread that they advertise as sourdough. Not good. I like a stacked juicy burger, but you wont get that here. Go to Millers Ale house if you're hungry, and I dont usually say that."
Toby M.,"Orlando, FL",1,3,1,1.0,6/28/2014,"This was supposed to be a special occasion but it was awful from the start. We were seated and given silverware rolled in cloth napkins. The knives each had some nasty crusty hard dried stuff on them. The server came over to take our drink orders. He left for a while and didn't return for a long time to take our lunch order. He served the few tables around us but was difficult to get his attention. We finally ordered and the food took quite a long time to be delivered. We asked for hot sauce for the chicken tenders but it didn't come with the food so we had to wait for it while the food got cold. Waiter nowhere to be found.  Hot sauce never delivered. No refill on drinks were offered. Blue cheese dressing on salad was sour and tasted awful. We showed the server the dirty silverware and he never returned with clean knives. It was turning into a bad experience for us while others seated near us had come in after us, been served and left. Their server was running all over the place. Ours gave dumb excuses about the kitchen. Not acceptable!  Finally the manager was notified. He comped the meal but he kind of had to. Nothing was right. I wrote to their corporate office but after a week haven't heard anything. Sorry, but not going there again!"
