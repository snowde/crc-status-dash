Zoe N.,"Kissimmee, FL",1,2,,5.0,6/7/2016,"My family and I dined here tonight and our server Brandin was outstanding, as always. We've been coming here regularly for about a year now and always ask to sit with him. As usual he was very attentive and made sure that our food came out fast and hot. We will definitely be back and will definitely ask for Brandin again!"
Jeremy T.,"Kissimmee, FL",14,9,1,5.0,3/7/2017,Delish! Great Deep Dish Pizza right here. Not overly saucy either.
Natalie B.,"Atlanta, GA",103,10,2,5.0,6/2/2016,This was my first time ever hearing of this restaurant. I went during happy hour and everything was so inexpensive. The service was great and I am thinking about going back for lunch !
Emily B.,"Reunion, FL",94,105,14,4.0,4/1/2015,"I have been to 3 BJ's now, and honestly didn't care much for the other 2 locations, but this place is great!  I have only ever came for the late happy hour, half off apps and flatbreads plus discounted beers starting at 10pm.  We always sit at the bar and the staff is always exceptionally nice."
Laura S.,"Orlando, FL",25,19,6,2.0,11/30/2016,"While in the past we have had nice experiences here I am afraid that tonite was not one of them. We arrived for dinner at 5:50 pm and were not able to finish until 8:10 pm. The kitchen was exceedingly slow. Our waitress was very pleasant and made sure to keep us updated about the delays, but it still took over an hour from ordering for the entrees to arrive. The food her is good though comparable to any chain restaurant. My personal favorite dishes are the calamari and the ahi poke appetizers. My parents very much enjoy the flat breads. I am not sure what was going on this evening with the delays but tonite was a 2 star experience."
Alissa B.,"Orlando, FL",97,2,,5.0,8/19/2016,"My husband, myself and a friend of ours stopped in last night and sat at the bar for a few drinks. I had a side salad. So nothing special that I can write about the food (even though the salad was fresh) but I can definitely tell you that the manager on shift was on top of his A game.  Observing the way he worked with his staff and helped them when help was needed was  the staff were all super friendly which tells me this place is being ran right. Nice work to all."
Theo T.,"Danbury, CT",463,109,92,5.0,2/17/2015,"So in comparison to a Cheesecake Factory, I much prefer the decor of BJs. They have TVs, exposed ceiling, deep U shaped booths, and an interesting wood floor that uses multiple shades of wood to create a pattern. And!!!! They take reservations! It has a great selection of beers and food. While there is variety in the menu it is not overwhelming like ""CF"" so in this case less really is more! I recommend the Berry Burst Cider and the Crusted Chicken Parmesan."
Donald H.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,5,1,1.0,10/5/2016,Visited this location yesterday for group-work lunch with over ten people - we called the restaurant the day before to give them a heads up that there will be a large party having lunch there - we get there and there is only one server to our group's table who was also working other tables - the service was off and the food was late and to top it off the management staff failed to even come to our table to apologize - never will visit there with a large group again. I'm also contacting their corporate office regarding their lack of quality managers.
Paul P.,"Pompano Beach, FL",41,411,2592,3.0,11/23/2015,I like the place but the service is ALWAYS so slow. Here now waiting over 10 min just to get a iced tea ! Not very busy and I'm on a lunch break. Not very good at all
Juan V.,"Broward, FL",17,7,11,5.0,12/19/2014,"I love this place. The food is delicious and service is great. One of my favorite plates is the Parmesan Crusted Chicken. The crust on the chicken is nice and crunchy, and goes very will with the sun dried tomatoes. Personally, I don't think the basil garnish on the chicken does anything for this plate besides just add some color contrast. The side of White cheddar mashed potatoes is very well balanced and has a tart but subtle cheese taste.  For desert, this time we tried the Smores Pizookie. Overall, I would give it an 7/10 if you have a pallet for traditional. Expecting a Smores desert, I would have liked a graham cracker to show up somewhere, but alas it was absent. The substitute, peanut butter , while creative made it very rich and almost impossible to finish after a meal. If you are one to mix flavor combinations its a great 10/10"
Lisa A.,"Orlando, FL",121,215,199,4.0,8/22/2014,"This is our go to place especially during happy hour! I'm a fan of half price appies! NOTE: it's only Happy Hour prices in the bar. Try the cheese sticks and wings...have a pazookie for dessert!!! (Think fresh baked, deep dish cookie with ice cream on top)!  Handcrafted beers and ciders on tap!  Friendly staff! Beer, appies, dessert and friendly people...All the makings of a great night!"
Doug G.,"Atlanta, GA",184,250,144,3.0,6/16/2013,"A great selection of beers and the food was pretty good for chain restaurant! I was expecting a little more atmosphere, but it may be this ones location. Overall, a decent place to have a few beers and enjoy some food.  I would highly recommend the avocado spring rolls! A must get here!"
A C.,"Orlando, FL",0,47,37,5.0,8/3/2016,Excellent menu choices especially during happy hour. Great service and value. The appetizers are very nice presented and portion. Great atmosphere for friends and family too
Gustavo U.,"Orlando, FL",3,22,28,2.0,7/16/2016,Worst mozzarella sticks I've ever had and I've eaten the ones McDonalds used to serve. The rest of the food is mediocre at best. The deep dish pizza was bland and the service here is ok but just not worth the money.  There are better places to eat at in this area and this will be my last time here.
Pippin L.,"Douglasville, GA",69,5,,5.0,5/1/2016,I can't say enough great things about BJ's. The food is fantastic and only matched by the service. David the manager is the nicest guy ever. He noticed I had just came from the hospital and stopped and ask if he could help with real genuine concern. He the bought our drinks and brought spit snacks for my to girls. What a wonderful experience!
Sandy M.,"England, AR",67,71,35,5.0,11/5/2015,Vanessa is great ! Absolutely loved her personality and costumer service.  Food came out warm and quick.
Cori S.,"Saint Cloud, FL",60,2,,2.0,2/28/2017,"I went to the restaurant Sunday evening for dinner with my boyfriend and his mother.  We waited at a booth in the bar for 20 minutes and not one person came by to clean off the table or get our drink order.  My name was still on the waiting list so we ended up sitting at that table in the restaurant once I received a text.  About 20 minutes after that we got our drinks.  Overall, the food was bland and not warm.  I have been to the other BJ restaurant locations in Orlando and the service and food were much better than here.  I feel like I threw 100 out the window.  Very disappointed.  Will not return."
Samantha E.,"Davenport, FL",0,16,1,4.0,8/1/2016,"1st time and saisfied as a family dinner out. Great choices, clean restaurant & bathroom, large enough where a very long wait isn't needed!"
Mandy C.,"Orlando, FL",170,115,255,4.0,10/14/2015,"I'm seriously addicted to BJ's. I don't know if it's because everything I've gotten to eat there is always so freakin' good, or because I've just been going there since I was in high school, but BJ's has my heart. Their food is comforting, and the pizookie's are so necessary upon every visit, so you better save room for dessert! Their craft beers are also really good, and you can even taste them before ordering, or order beer flights! Sometimes the service is a little slow, but I can overlook that because I just love my food almost every single time!"
Brandie A.,"Vicksburg, MI",40,11,,2.0,7/6/2016,Food was ok. Place was NOT busy on a Wednesday night but we waited over ten minutes in the bar for a waiter.  Apps came out fast. The mozzarella sticks were great. Teen boys got a deep dish pizza. They thought it was good. Burger and French dip weren't bad. We really liked the French fries. The problem here is not the food. It's slow service but to be fair our waiter was really great once we got him.
