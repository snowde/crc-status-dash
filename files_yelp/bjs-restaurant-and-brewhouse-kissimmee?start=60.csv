Kalvin K.,"Orlando, FL",429,1218,2657,2.0,6/1/2014,"I've probably been to this BJs location over 30 times since it opened. I'm actually surprised I haven't reviewed it before. My family and I came here on a Sunday and the wait was the standard 10-15 minutes. We sat due  and waited 10 minutes before someone greeted us. After the waitress greeted us, we were obviously able to order everything since we were sitting there for 10 minutes. The four waters came 5-7 minutes after the waitress greeted us.  Our appetizer came 20 minutes after that and entrees came 30 minutes after the appetizer. I'm no expert but I wouldn't think it takes 30 minutes to make a burger, a salad, a pasta dish , and a kids pizza.  The service and preparation time were unbelievable. Zero stars for the wait and service. The stars for this review are strictly for the food taste.  Not coming here again."
William A.,"Kissimmee, Orlando, FL",90,20,1,1.0,2/20/2016,"Had my worst restaurant experience ever! Yesterday I was in the mood to eat dinner and picked a place here in Kissimmee. I was promptly sat down and given a menu. 5 minutes later another customer sits down at an adjacent table. In the time I was sitting at the table the adjacent table had not one or two employees stop at the table but three! It wasn't until the third person realized that we were sitting there and not being attended that she said did someone assist us yet. Ok, progress! So the person comes over and takes our drink order of: an iced tea and a blueberry Sea Dog. 5 min later they returned with the tea and told me Sea Dog is a seasonal beer. (It's not a seasonal beer. They have a brewery in the Disney Springs vicinity.) So I ordered a Sam Adams. The guy disappears and now it's 10 minutes later... This just turned into a wtf moment! The adjacent table had their drinks well before I even placed mine. Hmm... The other adjacent table that was there prior to me arriving was just departing from their meal and it was a party of 8. I looked over at that table. It wasn't being bussed but instead there were two employees standing there conversing. One has using the back of the chair to place their weight on to use it as a crutch to support their front weight.  Now here's the questions. 1) Server - where was this person? Why wasn't I greeted promptly? What happened to my drink? Why weren't a small party of two people served the drink at the same time? How long does it take to pour a draft beer?  2) Staff -  Why were you standing around in public? Can't you do that out of people view? How is it that the manager/assistant manager/hostess did not see all the lack of professionalism that was taking place at your establishment? If you know the place is packed or not why isn't there someone there to pickup on overflow? I didn't know that acquaintances get preferential treatment, such as being greeted by various members of staff yet bypass other customers which makes it appear like the other customers don't exist? 9pm isn't a busy hour on a Friday evening. Yet it felt like no one had the intention of serving me. It felt like whoever was in charge of my table had called it quits and made enough money for the night. Being a server is part of hospitality and extremely important to the success of the business. Anything less will not keep your franchise afloat.  To make matters worse I eat healthy and I saw some great items on the menu that I would have tried. Now I will never try them because of this fiasco. Eating on a consistent timing is of importance to me. So after 30 minutes of getting nowhere I plainly got up and walked out. I wasn't going to make a fuss. Instead I headed over to Bonefish Grill.  Bonefish proceeded to sit me down and have the server at my table 2 minutes after being seated. Not only was I greeted promptly I was also recommend drinks, appetizers, and a main course. The difference between establishments were the difference between a preschool diploma and a doctorate diploma.  @bjsrestaurants you need to retrain your staff. It was not only embarrassing but laughable. I would pick any other restaurant/brewery over your lackluster Kissimmee location. Btw it won't be the last time this will be said."
Aleksander B.,"Kissimmee, FL",0,1,,1.0,7/24/2016,Terrible service. The children got their food 30min before the rest. One of us didn't get his food and the waitress was only avoiding us. Never this restaurant again.
Rizwan A.,"Philadelphia, PA",82,199,32,4.0,4/28/2014,"Such a chill, laid back experience here, the perfect Sunday hangover cure with a quiet and quick lunch service. Absolutely no complaints.  We ordered the ahi tuna app along with the stuffed mushrooms, both of which were awesome and very fresh tasting. The mushrooms were hot and very flavorful with the right amount of cheese and seasonings.  My wife and I split a buffalo chicken pizza which had a very smoky BBQ flavor to it. I didn't much care for that, I think I would have proffered more traditional buffalo sauce but my wife loved it.  We also ordered one of the draft cream sodas and a triple pazookie.... Which a lot like my wife-- is out of this world."
Amanda T.,"Winter Park, FL",0,5,3,2.0,1/14/2017,"The only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars instead of 1 is because their ""pizookie"" was delicious. Myself, my friend and my daughter came here on a Saturday night and were told the wait would be 20 min. When our table was ready 25 min later we were brought to a regular table when I specifically asked the hostess for a booth and told her I wouldn't need a high chair. We were told to go back to the hostess stand and a different girl told me that we would have to be put back on a wait list because I ""didn't request"" that. Shortly after that they seated us but things didn't get better. We got different drinks than what we ordered, were served cold food, and my sandwich was not good. Needless to say we will never be back. Take your money elsewhere!"
Fabien P.,"Celebration, FL",40,20,9,1.0,3/14/2015,"I don't do chains much. BJ's strikes me as a reasonable choice though. I have been to a few locations before and usually find the food acceptable.  In this location, however, between the sticky menus and the horrific bathrooms, I don't know what to say. Why does Yelp force you to give a star at all? In the restrooms, the floor is clearly dirty and sticky around the urinals, there are paper towels everywhere. The soap dispenser is empty and there is no paper in the stall I could look at. I guess the food tasted ok, but who know how clean the cook's hands were... Omg I ate here..."
Karen O.,"Miami, FL",87,32,17,4.0,5/28/2016,"Great service and good food. Meals are large portions. Call ahead of possible, because I waited a long time to sit."
Courtney L.,"St Cloud, FL",11,13,1,3.0,2/28/2016,"Food is okay. This is the fifth time we have been here. We have had to wait 10 to 20 minutes every time...just to be acknowledged by our server. If your in a hurry or want good service, go somewhere else. If you just want to chill and do not care, the food isn't bad. At least the service is consistently bad."
Stacy C.,"Orlando, FL",19,11,9,4.0,6/15/2015,"This was my second time eating at BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse the The Loop (I am new to the area) and I have no complaints about the food selection, and the way the food tastes!!  My mom and I were there for a quick lunch and a movie--or so we thought!  We ordered a flatbread goat-cheese, veggie appetizer and California chicken club sandwich. Yummy!! The appetizer was very flavorful, and it had plenty of veggies on it! The downfall was that on this particular Sunday, it was pretty busy, and we were not served our meals promptly.  Our waiter was very sweet, and offered a cup of soup because it was taking so long; we just wanted our sandwiches so we could get to the movies (we declined the soup, it was over 90 degrees outside). We eventually received our food, and the sandwich was also very tasty...it was like a toasted BLT with avocado and chicken, and I would definitely order it again!! It did take about an hour to get our meal served, and the waiter was very apologetic. It wasn't his fault, and we told him so. However, the manager came over to check on us, and offered us free movie tickets because we missed our movie due to the slow service...very unexpected, and appreciated!  We ended up going to a later movie that day. We appreciated the concern from the staff and for them making things right. This is the kind place you definitely want to return to, time and time again. Thank you BJ's manager for the movie tickets! ;-)"
S E.,"Orlando, FL",0,4,,2.0,1/3/2017,"I love the system they use for waiting in line. You put your name in then they text you when you table is ready. The wait staff seems to be a little slow. I've been to this location In the past year at least 10 times. During that time I've had maybe 2/3 good waiters/waitresses. Most times the staff take to long to check in and take drink orders. They don't come back and check on you. Many occasions I've had to flag them down. I've spoken to managers a total of 5 times, the problem still persist and don't seem to be getting better. Watch and see how they always put there fingers on your plate as well as the inside of your to-go containers. Bottom line, I've given this restaurant far more chances than they deserve and will not be coming to this location again!"
Arian G.,"Miami, FL",0,8,2,5.0,11/6/2015,"We had amazing food with amazing service. I ate the ribeye and it was delicious and cooked to perfection. My girl ate the Parmesan crusted chicken, and she loved it. The cheddar mash is a great side and they give you good portions.  The drinks were great too, we had hand crafted Margaritas and Dark Castles (Half Guinness and Half New Castle) it was awesome."
Alyssa S.,"Tampa, FL",539,236,169,4.0,1/8/2015,"I love BJs as much as the next person and most BJs are just about the same. Same decorations, same food, same weird picture of people farming on the wall.  What makes this one stand out is the service.  My fiancé and I came in sort of late (for dinner) on a Friday and were seated immediately. Caleb was our server, he was very friendly. Made jokes, checked in on us, gave us advice and made us really feel welcome.  Most times servers at places like this just go through the motions and don't really care, but this really stood out.  Hopefully he can be recognized for this, he deserves it."
Dawn V.,"Milford, MI",8,10,33,5.0,8/2/2015,"In Orlando with the family. Looking For somewhere to eat that hopefully wouldn't let us down. Lately everywhere has bad food and horrible service. The food was great and our server was very good. Was so pleased with the experience. And to top it off, it was one of our cheapest meals our whole vacation.  Will definitely go back."
Ank S.,"Orlando, FL",5,58,3,2.0,1/10/2016,Been here a few times and usually like this place for good beer and food. Today we went for dinner and it wasn't busy yet the food was delayed in the kitchen. Our potato skins came out burnt after being made twice since the first time was wrong.  Our food had a ton of salt and my wife and I both felt sick after eating a pizza here. How do you mess up pizza? Bad service and food. Will think twice before coming back again.
Jodi G.,"Austin, TX",12,7,3,5.0,1/11/2016,Amazing deep dish pizzas!! Our waitress clued us into a Monday night deal for 1/2 off Large pizzas and it was a total win. So delicious and such great service. Enjoyed the brews too!
Dennis P.,"Orlando, FL",1,31,6,5.0,6/28/2015,We just ate there today around 3:00. I always like this place.  I've been there many many times and the food and service is always great.  I want to point out a special server today. His name is Oscar.  What a great server.   He gave us the kind of service you would expect in a 5 star high end restaurant.   I plan to ask for him the next time we go there.  Which will be next week with the family!! Keep up the great work.
Gus F.,"Orlando, FL",154,217,220,4.0,2/7/2015,This place is located inside of a medium size shopping center so keep that in mind when going at peak times. The craft brews are good and so is the food. Service has been up and down over my last couple of visits but I still give them a good review. Happy hour by the bar is a must especially with co-workers
Joe O.,"Westwood, NJ",0,50,55,4.0,12/29/2015,"Place is very noisy. Service is good and food/drink selection is excellent. When meal came out, no dressing on the salad, no napkins/utensils. Had to ask. We enjoyed our meal. We would return."
Nelson D.,"Riverview, FL",16,10,8,3.0,6/23/2015,"It was our first time on this particular BJ's, however on other BJ's our experience was way much better. Tonight the restaurant seem to be understaffed, because drinks and food was very slow. In fact, our pizza arrived warm, by the second slice it was cold. The flavor was like Pizza Hut, nothing special. We really hope this was just a glitch and not the rule, because we like BJ's."
Jeffrey P.,"Orlando, FL",7,51,8,1.0,11/25/2015,"The only good about this place was the waiter and the internet that I am using to write this review.  Food cold, food delivered late, food was generally marginal, on a level with what you would expect from Friday's or Chilies.  Just more expensive.  For a big company this should be a better product.  When we spoke to the manager he was less then helpful.  He didn't ask what he could do, just said he was sorry.  Why do this guy have a job.... Ok now I have an end my review they took off the the dishes that were poorly executed"
