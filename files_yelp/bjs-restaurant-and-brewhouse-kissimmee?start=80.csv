Nicholas I.,"Orlando, FL",32,56,127,4.0,7/31/2013,"I can't say that I was ever disappointed during my visit to BJ's Restaurant. So, let me elaborate on that point a little further... The service was pretty great. Our waitress was prompt, and quite funny. She wasn't some bland food servant of any sorts. The other waiters and waitresses who were near us on our way to our table greeted us nicely and were welcoming as well.  The food was also quite impressive especially for a really, really busy chain restaurant. I ordered the Chicken Fetuccine Alfredo and, while not as good as Olive Gardens, it was well prepared and quite tasty. The rest of my family was also pleased with their dishes. This isn't the first time we've been to BJ's, and it definitely won't be the last."
Iris G.,"Miami Beach, FL",0,8,,1.0,2/14/2016,"You know when you are so hungry that everything tastes good? Well, apparently I wasn't hungry enough. Everything tasted like it was reheated. Even the soup was less than mediocre. How do you mess up soup??!! I was really disappointed and felt ripped off. I even over heard the table next to us complaining about the food and service. I don't think I will be visiting this restaurant again."
Chuck K.,"Orlando, FL",6,56,61,4.0,6/15/2013,"Bj's has a great selection of their own beers (Jeremiah Red is my choice) and the food on the menu is brought in good portions and reasonably priced. The Hawaiian Mahi-Mahi is my favorite. Staff seems to turnover, which will sometimes create a small problem with service."
Man G.,"Bethlehem, PA",60,4,23,5.0,12/30/2014,"When we go to there, the mini size pizza has an amazing half price discount, so we only use 80 which tips is included to cover the dinner of 4."
Ashley V.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",18,7,5,5.0,12/20/2014,"This was our first time visiting this location. However, the food and atmosphere lived up to the standards we have come to expect from BJ's Brewhouse. We were seated quickly and our waitress was attentive and courteous.  We ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken with lemon Chardonnay butter sauce, sun-dried tomatoes, fresh basil and Parmesan cheese. Served with white cheddar mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli. It was wonderful! The sauce had a nice tang to it, the chicken was crisp on the outside while remaining moist on the inside. And don't get me started on the mashed potatoes! They were probably my favorite part of the dish.  For dessert we got the Peanut Butter S'mores Pizookie. It was very rich and definitely something I would recommend splitting between maybe 3 or 4 people. Overall, our experience was very enjoyable. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting the area."
Cyrus P.,"Kissimmee, FL",204,38,43,5.0,10/29/2014,"The left side of the restaurant (location of the bar) is self seating. No reservation needed. Very good food, full service bar, and friendly servers. They make their own beer (microbrewry) and I am very please of their selection.  The menu is vast to appeal to the masses. I have been coming here for years and haven't been disappointed. I have read that the service is slow and the waiters weren't attentive. However, I have not seen it and I have been coming here for the past 10 years. I would suggest it may be an isolated incident. It is a nice place to go after hours when most places are close. I think their kitchen closes late. I want to say 11pm or 12am, but don't quote me on that."
Liza H.,"Baldwin, NY",0,3,2,2.0,8/5/2016,"Some friends of ours brought us here for dinner. Our server Simone was great, she saw that all the other waitstaff kept ignoring us and stepped up and took over the table. Drinks were great but the biggest issue was all of our dinners arrived cold to the touch. Managers were apologetic and offered to not charge us but we decided to pay for the drinks and appetizers and just leave."
Claudia S.,"Chicago, IL",463,438,684,2.0,9/18/2012,"I don't even remember what I had from here, that's how memorable this place was.  In fact, the only reason I came here is because I got out of a movie late and didn't want fast food, didn't want to make dinner while my family was asleep and mostly because I was very hungry and very tired.   Tried their hoppiest beer and it was gross.  I think I only finished about a quarter of it, which is unusual for me because some of my favorite beers are Hop Slayer and Hopslam.  Don't remember the other drink I had some sips of, but it was a mixed one it was also bad.   As far as the food goes, I can't remember what I had except for the appetizer.  They had some sort of avocado egg roll and since I LOVE avocado, I ordered it.  The waitress swore there was no cream cheese (or rather, if there was, you could barely taste it) and sure enough, I spit it out.  I actually didn't want the appetizer, but the waitress convinced me it was one of the best things on their menu and because I wanted some avocado, I believed her.   I remember walking out of there and feeling bad that my mom's cousin just paid for that because none of it was good.  I know I had a sandwich and I know it lacked flavor.  I'm sure people around here aren't used to good food (I'm not even being mean, aside from Abuelo's, there is nothing but chain food!), but this isn't a step up from any of those places."
Chris B.,"Palm Beach Gardens, FL",17,116,81,3.0,9/25/2014,We stopped here on our way out of town. We were seated right away. Once we ordered it took over 45 minutes for the food to show up and some of us had ordered salads... It made for some very cranky and hungry people! Once to food showed up everything we good. Overall not a bad place but they take too long to get their food out of the kitchen.
Jason G.,"Philadelphia, PA",4,3,,2.0,10/2/2015,"The service has been slacking lately, but usually this is a pretty solid place for decent food and great beer. Tonight, however, a server accidentally tripped and spilled food all over us. Pretty gross, a ruined shirt, but no big deal, we've all been there before, right? We didn't say anything, but hoped that maybe a manager would pop out, apologize, and maybe pay for a round of drinks or something. Did that happen?? Nope. Which tells us that the management really sucks or that the servers are afraid of the management. Either way, this was really bad customer service."
Frank L.,"Celebration, FL",641,759,2254,3.0,6/15/2012,"Although I am not typically a fan of chains, you can't beat BJ's happy hour from 4-7...  They have $1 off their draft beers and half off appetizers.  The food is actually pretty good.  I highly recommend the lettuce wraps.  My favorite beer here is the Porter..yum!"
John K.,"Kissimmee, FL",39,20,8,3.0,9/2/2015,Hadn't visited BJs for several months and thought I'd give it a shot for lunch today. Not overly impressed as you can see from the 3 star rating. The lunch menu leaves a lot to be desired....not many choices at all. The pricing seems to have increased since my last visit. I had the cheeseburger which at best was mediocre. I might give them a chance again for dinner....buy won't be back for lunch.
Jahaira L.,"Orlando, FL",1,24,,4.0,2/20/2016,Beer is great here. Recommend PM Porter and Jeremiah Red as their best selections.  Their egg rolls are amazing with their avocado cream. I also recommend their flatbreads and wings. Staff is cute which is always a benefit and the environment over all is pleasant. Not too many children and they
Anwar A.,"Marina Del Rey, CA",6,6,24,3.0,8/30/2013,"Want that good , the hand toast pizza was less than avenge  The deep dish pizza was not good , too much Dough, and row  Serves is good ,  although price is ok"
Fully I.,"Kissimmee, FL",2,47,82,1.0,7/31/2015,"After MULTIPLE failed attempts to receive excellent service here, we've thrown in the towel! We've been to this restaurant over 2 dozen times and we can't remember one good experience. We had joined the reward club and various deals had brought us back to ""give it another try"" but today was the last straw. Being ""loyalty members"" we are often given surveys after our meals and EVERY time we've been we mention how EXTREMELY SLOW the service is. This has not been fixed since we started visiting over 2 years ago.  Today, we entered and were quickly seated (not greeted but seated) as it was not busy at all. After sitting for several minutes the server made her way to the table. She did not ask how we were or exchange any pleasantries whatsoever, but went straight into asking for our drink and appetizer order. We placed our entire order and she disappeared for the duration of our very long wait for our food. When our food finally arrived over 30 MINUTES LATER, it was missing a sauce it comes with. We waited an additional 5 minutes for the sauce as all the tables around us (who had arrived after us finished their meals and left). We finished our meals, unvisited by our server for the duration as well as 10 minutes after. When she returned, she asked if we'd like dessert, to which we declined and asked for our check. She returned 10 minutes later. Honestly I would've loved to pay by phone (on the app) but the check hadn't been updated. Another 10 minutes goes by before she decides to peek her head out of the kitchen, myself now standing at our table actively looking for her to return my credit card. We are finally able to check out, exhausted by the whole experience. We will not be back."
Matt M.,"Orlando, FL",68,626,318,3.0,7/13/2012,"Been here a few times and had fun each time, but every time I come I always keep expecting more.  Never had the best or quickest service, but never really been bad enough to complain. Their beers are pretty good, but it's not like they're being brewed in the back and they're not $2-$3/pint better than nationally produced beers. The menu reads like an encyclopedia and maybe there is where BJ's goes slightly wrong.  They go way beyond just bar fare with burgers and flatbreads and pastas and calzones and salads and pizzas and ... well, it just doesn't end.  And while I've never complained about the quality of the food, I've also never ordered the same thing twice, as nothing's blown me away. The Loop location is very nice and well-kept.  The TVs are everywhere, allowing great views of all the sports action of the day. 3-stars for a good place, but nothing really spectacular."
Lauren B.,"Orlando, FL",46,13,,5.0,9/18/2015,Fast and friendly service. I've never had a bad experience at this restaurant. The food is always good!
Sherry M.,"Oakland, FL",0,5,,1.0,1/11/2016,"We had the Mahi and shrimp dish with tomatoes and couscous.  The dish was ""covered"" with Calamari olives.  The waitress was inattentive and never came back to check on us before it was too late.  The shrimp were raw and the fish was very mediocre for the price.  The server finally did get the manager who offered us something else.  Reeeely? after all of this time and we were ready to leave. The server had so many BS excuses to take the blame off of her.  When she found out the manager was not doing anything, she did go to someone and took $3.63 off the price of a $14.50 dish.  Whoopee  What a ripoff. We will never go back there."
Steven G.,"Kissimmee, FL",0,2,,2.0,5/15/2016,Went for my birthday dinner. Took server 10 min to take drink order. Took another 15 min for her to take food order. Ordered 2 bacon cheeseburgers well done. When meal was served one was well done and one medium. Their usually good burger was also very bland.  Had to go find server to ask for mustard and low and behold she was at the servers station on her cell phone.  After eating waited 15 min to be asked if we wanted desert which by this time we decided to decline. Took another 10 min to get check.  During entire time we were never offered or brought any additional drinks or water.  Good spot for lunch but BEWARE for dinner.
Mike C.,"Long Beach, CA",743,435,731,4.0,2/23/2012,"This place is clean, the service is friendly/attentive and the food is okay.  Yes just okay.  I would like to eat here more often but chain restaurants aren't usually my first choice when it comes to grabbing grub.  Despite that fact I can't help but return here because of its location in the Loop and it's superiority over Chilli's and the other few restaurants in the area.  Superiority= Draught beer selection and T.V.s"
