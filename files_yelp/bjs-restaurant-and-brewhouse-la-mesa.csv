Enrique G.,"La Jolla, CA",8,102,70,5.0,12/23/2017,It's just GOOOOOD comfort food with a very large menu that has something for everyone to try. It's all tasty and fresh. Highly recommended for a quick bite or an after hours  visit
Jerry P.,"Escondido, CA",74,94,87,5.0,11/12/2017,"I'm a huge fan of BJ's restaurant.   I enjoy the beers they brew, almost everything I have tried on the menu has been fantastic, and I have never had bad service.   The place is popular, so when you go, prepare to wait.   The Stout and Red beers they have are amazing.  I just tried their IPA and wasn't that much of a fan of it.  I like Double IPA's b/c they have more of a bite to them, so that may be why I didn't enjoy it as much.   I tried several of their pizza's, but think the spicy chicken is my favorite.  I had their spaghetti and meatballs more than once and love it.  The portion sizes are large, so I always have the remainder the next day.   They have Pizookie dessert,  which comes in several different flavors, and you can mix two of them...  they are to amazing.  If you download their app, checkin with it, they will give you one for free. I've been to the North County location, Mission Valley, and now Grossmont Center here in California as well as a location in Maryland.   I have never had bad service, in fact, every employee I dealt with had great attitudes, excellent sense of humors, and were very prompt and attentive.    I definitely recomend this place."
Marissa D.,"La Mesa, CA",239,53,123,3.0,10/26/2017,My mom wanted to get lunch one afternoon and we decided to pick BJs because of the huge menu they have! There's something for everyone and more!  We were seated immediately but the server took a while to greet us.  I ordered the half rack of ribs with a side salad and mashed potatoes which was right around $20. I'm a HUGE fan of anything bbq so I was so excited to try them!  Once the salad arrived I took a few bites and it was just drenched with dressing so I had to be that annoying customer that asks for a new one with dressing on the side and you could tell that the server was irritated. I received my new salad and after that she wouldn't make eye contact with me.  But I got my ribs and they were to die for! And it was a Tuesday so the pazookie was only $3!!!  I'll of course be back at some point and I hope I have a better experience then. I'll go back for the food but not the service.
Yuleni D.,"San Diego, CA",25,92,92,4.0,11/23/2017,"Food was very good! Server was super on top of it,especially considering one of the servers was just taken away by ambulance. We had ordered a deep dish buffalo pizza and it was super good. (Could have used a little more buffalo sauce though) I really liked the dough and tge flavors mingled well together. We also had a flat thin market pizza, Italian something. It was also very good. Only thing that sucked here was that we had to ask fir for the channel to be changed 3x before it happened. It was the manager who was in charge of it but it felt like we didnt matter to him. By the time he changed it we were almost done with our pizza. Oh well kinda sucky.Anyway the server was good and so was the food. I'll definitely come back."
Audrey M.,"San Diego, CA",172,147,148,4.0,8/7/2017,"We go here about 4-5 times a year and must say it never disappoints. The wait can be long, but most of the time it is 15-20minutes. If you don't want to wait, just have your meal in the bar area.  My favorite thing to order is their chicken Parmesan. It is always moist and has a super crispy breading. The serving size is also huge, you get two big pieces of chicken parmesan, huge scoop of mashed potatoes and a huge scoop of veggies.  We always end our meal with a pizookie. If you are sharing with people, get pizookie sampler!"
Mansour S.,"Rancho San Diego, San Diego, CA",119,220,1008,4.0,4/21/2017,"Havent been here for almost a year , i always get burgers here with some of their best beers And it havent failed me , today since i was on a diet ( trying to lose some pounds) so i had to search for lowest calories , so i choose peruvian qinuoa bowl with shrimp (550 calories) & my friend ordered lemon thyme chicken with extra lemon thyme sauce , my meal was ok it was full of shrimp but shrimp was salty and i felt it needed to have more qinuoa and maybe little less shrimp   i liked the flavor, next time i wouldnt go with it , lemon thyme chicken was good yet no extra sauce i might choose this one next time if i am ordering low calorie meal , overall food is ok i deducted a star because its not that perfect. Our waitress was nice and took care of us , she kept our glasses full without us asking . Again if i am not on diet i will choose burger for sure."
Charles C.,"La Mesa, CA",54,200,754,3.0,11/2/2017,"Corporate owned and managed restaurants are pervasive in San Diego and elsewhere, and they can have a value when you seek the experience they offer. That value is usually one of consistency, of meeting expectations. You know what you will get and what you will NOT get.  All I wanted was to sit quietly at a large booth in an uncrowded room, sip white wine and nibble on something familiar. No challenges or unnecessary interactions.  I was intending to attend the 5:30 p.m. All Saints Day Mass at Our Lady of Grace Roman Catholic Church in El Cajon on Tuesday, so I wanted to eat at 3:30 p.m. in the area.  I knew BJ's Restaurant [where I have been before] was just down Fletcher Parkway from the Church at Grossmont Center, so I decided to eat there. It was very quiet when I entered BJ's at 3:30 p.m. The cheerful hostess greeted me immediately, and led me to a large, semi-circular booth, as I had requested [there are only five such booths in the restaurant---ask for them]. I inquired of the hostess if the Happy Hour applied only to the bar, or if it also encompassed the dining room. She stated it was in the bar only, adding ""but I am sure your waiter will be able to accommodate you since we are not busy"". When the tall waiter arrived at the table, I inquired about Happy Hour wines and he stated ""He did not have the menu and he would need ""manager approval"". I replied ""Don't bother"", since the hassle and effort was not worth it. Regardless, the regular price of the House Chardonnay at BJ's is only $6.50, which beats a Gaslamp ""Happy Hour"" $10.00 wine price any day.  While I was looking over the menu, another waiter was in a loud personal conversation with another server which was distracting. Happily, after about five minutes of my hearing all about his life, that waiter went back to work.  The WIFI works perfectly.  I noted the restaurant seems fond of squeezing twosomes into tiny booths squashed against a divider, even though there were many more commodious tables available. The menu is presented in a plasticized spiral ""notebook"". On the cover of the menu is a photograph of a large dessert [""Salted Caramel 'Pizookie'""]. I do not like to see a photograph of a dessert on the cover of a menu from which I am ordering my meal. It makes it looks like a dessert menu.  I ordered the Chicken Club Sandwich on grilled sourdough, served with French Fries, which was delivered with lightening speed.  The after-dinner Irish Coffee was properly made."
Adrienne J.,"San Diego, CA",155,78,6,5.0,12/27/2017,"We've been coming here FAR too often for FAR too long, and that's ok with me!  Every time we are disappointed (which isn't a lot), the service team and/or management ensures that we are taken care of appropriately.  Case in point, last evening....the kitchen was a bit on the slow side and our kids received their pizza far after we had our food.  The manager acknowledged that the time of making our food was ridiculous, mentioned that we were long standing patrons, and immediately removed ALL the food from the bill.  THAT is top notch, folks!  Their servers have become like family to us, and we have NEVER been made to feel unwelcome there.  Kudos, BJ's...you keep doing you!"
Jennica S.,"Chula Vista, San Diego, CA",639,405,1362,2.0,12/30/2016,"This review is a bit late, but better late than never. BJ's was one of the restaurants participating in the Veteran's Day specials, so I went to this location with my sister and brother-in-law because the wait for the Chula Vista location was too long.  The Vet's special at BJ's was a free entree (for up to $12.95) and a free beer. My bro-in-law got a deep dish pizza and was going to pay the difference, my sister got a flatbread, and I got a burger. The food took a really, really long time to get to us. We waited patiently, and we understood how busy it was, but our waiter didn't really check up on us. Other people got their food before us, as well. Not to mention, our waiter took a long time to get us our waters, and forget to give us our lemons despite us asking several times. He even had the chance when he gave us our appetizer, but forgot. The food was delicious, and we were all very satisfied. The main problem was the customer service. Davis was our server, and not only did he not check on us a lot, he messed up on the bill multiple times. He failed to do the Vet's special (for the entree and the beer), so we had to remind him. Also, he didn't make one of the beers free. Then it was the wrong entree that he took the money off of.  There were multiple mistakes, but after having him fix it (and take long to pick up the check), we just let it be. Another note! When we called the Chula BJ's location, the person who answered the phone was sweet and you could hear the smile in her voice. Whereas when calling the Grossmont BJ's location, the girl who answered sounded rude and impatient. Although it's busy, customer service is still a thing. I don't think I'd come back to this location, but at least the food was good."
Amy S.,"Spring Valley, CA",0,12,3,1.0,12/28/2017,Very bad no organization at all. We put our names and what would have been only 10 to 15 min took 1/2 hour so we left and went to Claim Jumper.  I will no longer go to BJ's
Alyssa M.,"San Diego, CA",54,153,102,5.0,8/3/2017,"Dining at the bar on date nights, always speedy and friendly service! When taking the little ones and dining at a booth - same kind of service. The food is always well prepared, everyone is always pleased with what they have picked and it never skipped out on quantity. BRING BACK THE GROWLERS - seriously - WHAT HAPPENED. They have a neat cooler for their 6 packs but dang $$$$$$$$"
Sheryl K.,"San Diego, CA",0,3,,1.0,10/6/2017,"We had been here once before, enjoyed ourselves and the food so decided to come back again. I am not a complainer but they need to know when something is wrong so they can fix it. As an appetizer we decided to split the Seared Ahi Salad. It came to the table split which was nice and I asked the food runner for some soy sauce to go with. He told me they did not have soy sauce, I said really, can you check please? We took bites of the salad while waiting for soy sauce for the Ahi, the salad was very good HOWEVER the Seared Ahi was still frozen!!! Really???? It tasted hard, ice still on it and extremely fishy. The Runner ended up finding some soy sauce in the back, but when he came back to the table we asked to have the manager come over to speak with us. We told her about the frozen Ahi on salad, how it was horrible and she apologized, did not charge us for salad and said they would pay special attention with the rest of our meal and that dessert would be on the house. It took quite a while for our main course to come, our server never checking on us, finally when it did come my husbands Salmon was quite good he said but the sides, rice and broccoli were ice cold. My Prime Rib Dip was ice cold, French fries were good though. Our server never came to check on us and by that time we were so hungry we ate it anyway. We ordered our dessert ""to go"" because we just wanted to go home after all the trouble we had, the Triple Chocolate Cookie thing and Salted Caramel one too, ice cream on the side. Too funny when I got home to see that dessert was not what I ordered at all, it was the Monkey Bread cookie thing (hard as a rock, inedible) and the Macadamia cookie. They did include the choc chips and chocolate sauce for the undelivered Triple Chocolate cookie thing though! Dessert went in the trash. I do need to mention that the bathroom was very messy with no toilet paper in it either!  All and all, after a hard work week, just wanting to go out, relax and feel you got your money's worth on a nice dinner was all I wanted. BJ's was a huge disappointment and we will not be returning."
Nette B.,"San Diego, CA",1628,1009,1992,3.0,10/2/2016,"Came here on a Sunday morning for breakfast and to watch a little bit of football. We sat in the bar area.  Food:  I ordered the short stack pancakes and a side of bacon cooked soft or undercooked and Tupac had the 2 eggs with bacon and toast.  He thought his breakfast was alright.  For me, the pancakes were delicious.  Unfortunately, the bacon was not done or  cooked the way I wanted so I didn't eat it but Tupac ended up eating it.   With that said, I asked our server how the kitchen prepares the bacon.  I kinda knew already but had to ask.  I asked if they prepare the bacon all at once and leave it in a container as people order.  She responded with ""Yes, that's how they prepare it.""  So I then said, this is the reason why I ordered it soft and undercooked because my bacon was extremely hard like jerky and covered in oil.  Don't get me wrong I'm okay with the oil since it's bacon but I didn't want jerky type bacon.  She did offer for them to make me another batch of bacon but I said it was not necessary that I'm done eating.  The good thing is she did remove the bacon charge so kudos to her.   BJ's is a chain restaurant so I'm sure I'll be returning.  Beer and Bar food is always better."
Christine N.,"San Diego, CA",0,17,2,1.0,9/3/2017,"Can anyone tell me what is this? We ordered a monkey bread pizookie. And this is what we get. We came in on sunday night and I  can tell it's crowded. We ordered blood orange sangria which is soo goood that it became my favorite. We sat down, figured out what we want, closed the menu as a sign that we are ready to order. Yet nobody came by. I had my hand up. And nobody came by. Until I had to stop one of them , then my supposed to be waiter for the night finally showed up. Got my ordered. My drinks came out fast. But took them more than 30 mins or more to get a monkey bread pizookie and a California club flatbread out. How disappointing to see this. I understand the bread is hot. But to melt the whole 2 scoops of ice cream down takes a while okay? Now the bread is soggy.  I dont even want to touch them. Way to ruin the day."
Isabella A.,"El Cajon, CA",107,16,,5.0,12/3/2017,I've been coming here for years and my favorite bartender is Brian!! He always recommends the best dishes and beer pairings. I really enjoy the Thursday ribs special!!!
Veronica T.,"San Diego, CA",9,47,199,5.0,6/4/2017,"Great service! The waiter was super sweet and kept checking up on our orders! Food came out quick! Was with a big group and we ordered a whole bunch of appetizers including favorites like the chicken pot stickers with soy sauce, guacamole egg rolls with sweet teriyaki sauce, chips with a spinach and parmesan dip(was kind of watery but still okay ), boneless hot chicken wings (MY FAVE) with a side of deep house ranch and last but not leastttt two small deep dish pizzas: the first was a pepperoni sausage deep dish  which was so good and the second was a combo veggie with another side of ranch for dipping!"
Giena L.,"Mid-City, San Diego, CA",375,398,856,2.0,3/8/2017,"Wasn't busy at all when a group of 6 of us went during HH, but literally had to wait an hour for our food, until one of us spoke with the server and then all of a sudden all of our food came out quickly. Unfortunately, we were on a time crunch, so we were kind of rushed to finish.  Upside- the server was able to provide separate checks, no biggie."
Lennard O.,"San Diego, CA",117,177,145,4.0,4/20/2017,Enjoy this place since it's in our neighborhood. Avocado egg rolls and small deep dish pizza are always a good option. Service has always been good when we go.
Andy G.,"North Hills, Los Angeles, CA",0,26,12,3.0,6/24/2017,"I ordered the root beer glazed ribs with sides of tortilla soup and mashed potatoes. Starting with the tortilla soup, taste was there however temperature was not. Seemed more like a room temperature / somewhat cold. The ribs tasted good, but was really hoping for great. Too many burnt char edges and unfortunately threw the taste buds off. Mashed potatoes could've also been better, tasted a little bland. Sticking with 3 stars, as my server was great and took care of me every time I needed something. Thanks Lilliana!"
Suzanne C.,"San Diego, CA",19,70,27,4.0,11/18/2017,The food is good. Our server was very sweet and attentive until we got our meal but that all changed when she notified us that she was going on her dinner break and another server was going to take over. He only showed up after we were finished eating. We ran out of drinks by the time he showed up. We then ordered dessert and it took about 20-30 mins for us to get it. During that time no one picked up our empty dinner plates until he brought the dessert out and by that time we were out of drinks again. Then we had to wait forever to get the bill. Thankfully BJs has an app that allows you to just pay through the app otherwise we would probably still be waiting for our bill.
Jeneva C.,"San Diego, CA",10,134,85,5.0,8/4/2017,Now this is why I love this location as oppose to my last bad visit in hazard center. Tonight Donovan was our server and he's probably been the best server we have had in a long while and we go lots of places and encounter plenty servers and waitresses. From the very first second he's been nothing but polite and attentive. Answered all of our questions and just overall superb. My son insisted doing a yelp for him. There are some people who enjoy their job and value customer service and he is the perfect example of one of those people. Keep up the amazing service Donovan! Service sometimes means more than the food to me. You could have a great meal with crappy service and it won't even matter that the food was good. Luckily bjs has good food to top off our visit :)
Lori A.,"San Diego, CA",0,12,,2.0,11/17/2017,"Great foos, good service. HATED our table by the elevated server station. It was a gathering place, and one server stood looking over & listening to us for 20 minutes. Certainly something could have been cleaned or she could go take her break somewhere else."
Ro S.,"Los Angeles, CA",51,109,4,1.0,6/13/2017,"Yelp! You need a zero star option. I am currently sitting here, as I have been for almost three hours. Either the slow dining movement has made it's way to BJ's or I got punked. Either way, something in the milk ain't clean, boo boo.  Came for a graduation party for about 20 and sat for over an hour before getting our entrees. And everyone still didn't get their food at nearly the same time. And once we got it? It was cold. Or the order was wrong. Ultimately, it was not of the same quality as other BJs.  And, as if that's not bad enough, we walked into the middle of BJ-gate. Basically, that's the equivalent of Biggie vs. Tupac of the serving world. I hope they can work it out because their rivalry, while entertaining, interfered with a family celebration and made it awkward.  And to add insult to injury, the bathroom isn't clean?! Nah. That's just nasty. Almost EVERY surface was wet. They tried to make it up to us by giving us free dessert. And guess what?! They even brought that out late. Free is too high a price at this BJ's. My suggestion? Stay home, watch any of the Real Housewives if you want drama, and eat a cold bowl of cereal. That would be better than this."
Lesley M.,"La Mesa, CA",161,500,1403,3.0,6/1/2016,"I guess I've never reviewed BJ's before. Huh. The service here is usually good. This is not my restaurant of choice to be honest, my son likes it here.  I'm not a fan of their pizza. I think it's way too doughy, the sauce is too sweet, and it lacks flavor. If we come here I usually order soup or salad. Don't shoot me, but I also do not get the hoopla over the famed pizookie either. It's way too sweet. To me it kind of tastes a little disgusting. I'd rather go out for gelato.  I think I prefer coming here during lunch. It's way too noisy at dinner time. I mean seriously noisy, and the drinkers get obnoxiously loud. I don't care to hear their opinions on sports or women's breast sizes shouted into my ear while I'm trying to eat. Especially if they're commenting on my server. The restrooms are clean and located by the entrance. There is plenty of parking as this location is in Grossmont Center. You can also order take out here, they have a separate pick up counter as you walk in the door, it is immediately to the right."
Bianca D.,"San Diego, CA",209,98,55,2.0,12/26/2016,"We came to this location after doing some furniture shopping and need to get something to eat. This was my first visit to this site and it was probably one of the worst. To begin, when we first got in the joint the guy up front was very nice and told me that we would be seated in five minutes- it took more like 15 but no big deal.  The table the we were seated at was in the back however our table was cleaned off in a rush and most of the food from the previous guests seemed to still be on the floor.  Getting stuck to the bottom of our shoes, but hey- still no big deal.  Our server was very pleasant she was a younger gal and got our orders right away. It took 10 mins to receive our drink and she forgot mine, no big deal. We asked then she received. Then about 45 mins pass by and we still haven't gotten our food- we look around and the table sitting next to us gets their food, mind you their party was seated a while after us. Finally our server asked the food runner where our food was because by that time it had been 1 hour that we had been sitting there waiting for our food. He apologized and our food was brought to us shortly after that. He explained that the kitchen was cray and we were understanding. Now, although everyone was pleasant I still feel the employees could've been a bit more attentive and at least let us know the dilemma. Other than that the food was delicious per usual. Just not the best day to go to BJ's I guess... ):"
Alice C.,"San Diego, CA",401,6,,4.0,11/19/2017,"I am a huge fan of BJ's restaurants, and this location is our definite favorite to go to in San Diego! For the most part, we get really awesome servers and the food is always really good. Also, this location is never usually too crowded so we get seated pretty quickly."
Matthew W.,"San Diego, CA",4,70,29,2.0,7/31/2017,"Came here on a Sunday night around 8pm.  The place was full of people which was nice, as there's not much open in La Mesa on Sunday night.  We were seated at a table in about 10 minutes, sweet!  Our server was very attentive and made sure our order was placed quickly.  I ordered a couple of drinks and the spaghetti and meatballs, my friend ordered the fried shrimp salad.  We were both rather underwhelmed with our dishes.  My spaghetti looked dull and tasted like spaghetti-os.  The meatballs were burned and pretty small.  My friend's shrimp salad was basically fried shrimp ontop of a plate of iceberg lettuce.  The shrimp were gross and uncooked underneath the fried batter.  Neither dish looked anything like the pictures in the menu.   We may come back in the future, if only because there's a patio, and not really else open at these hours.  The food and drink left much to be desired."
Ed P.,"San Diego, CA",60,173,109,5.0,1/10/2017,"Had the sobe noodle and ziti dishes off the charts! Toby is an very good server, very attentive and made sure our drinks were refilled he offered desert but no room!!"
Sarah S.,"La Mesa, CA",267,48,32,3.0,10/14/2017,"The food is decent. Not much in the way of Vegetable and Vegan options other than salads. The vegan lentil soup is quite tasty. I used to dine in but recently tried curbside. BOTH times I've ordered curbside, I've had to walk in and go get the order. No apologies from staff, nothing. If I wanted to do that, I would have selected Carry/Take out, not curbside. Makes me wonder if their delivery services are late too."
Sophia D.,"Santee, CA",2,18,51,2.0,2/25/2017,"My husband and I came here on a Saturday around 4pm so it was busy as expected. We were told the wait would be 10-15 minutes so my husband went to get a beer at the bar where he was served immediately. Our name was called for a table and the hostess seated us.  I'm not sure if the servers in the section thought we were already helped since my husband had a beer on the table but nobody acknowledged us or came to take my drink order for 10 minutes.  We ordered a classic deep dish pizza, only the 9 inch since deep dish is denser and more filling.  I understand that deep dish usually takes longer to cook so we were prepared to wait. When it arrived 40 minutes later I was disappointed because after all that time the look and taste was comparable to a frozen DiGiorno pizza. Nothing like any true deep dish I've ever tasted. We decided to order a mint chocolate pizookie which tasted good but in my opinion overpriced. Basically $7.50 for a cookie with a scoop of ice cream.  I guess it's the novelty of it.  Overall, this is a good place for friends to meet up, grab some drinks and food but not a place I would go again for a date night."
Dominique C.,"Alpine, CA",0,10,2,4.0,11/6/2017,Went in for a quick lunch with my best friend. Our server victor was awesome. We were a little obnoxious and he laughed at our jokes and got our food out in a timely manner. Best buffalo wings and the garlic knots are amazing
Michelle H.,"Santee, CA",16,21,8,3.0,12/3/2016,Update: After reading my initial review the manager contacted me and provided a gift card to return to the restaurant for another opportunity to try their food. Thank you Braxton for following up with me and it's reassuring to know you care and want to provide excellent customer service at your restaurant! I will visit again soon. I will also change the stars from 1 to 3. And if all goes well on my return visit I'll update again. Thank you! Friday 11/25/16: I ordered 3 pizookies to go for my son's 13th birthday. All 3 were burnt. Very disappointing given the fact that they are $8 a cookie. Not worth it! Had I checked them before leaving I would have returned them. I'm honestly surprised they felt ok serving them knowing they were all burnt. I even left a complaint online and they never reached out to me. They obviously don't care about their customer's experiences or satisfaction (or lack thereof). I won't be returning.
Sandra G.,"Lakeside, CA",0,2,,1.0,12/18/2017,"Not happy with the service.  Took my daughter for her birthday dinner tonight. The server,Summer, was very distracted with other tables that she ignored us.  We ordered an appetizer that never came, our water glasses were never refilled and when Summer brought my daughter her the complimentary dessert she just basically tossed it on the table and walked away without even saying a word.  The food was just ok. Kinda pricey.  Very disappointed because I like BJ's."
Jamey A.,"Escondido, CA",406,145,220,3.0,4/27/2016,"My husband and I came in for dinner with a few friends on a Sunday night. There was a 5 minute wait for our party of 4 which wasn't bad at all. We were seated at a booth near the front and after I sat down I noticed that there were dirty utensils and napkins underneath the table still. It wasn't really an issue to me and we just had them clear it out of the way. I really like that BJ's has a separate gluten free menu available with a variety of choices for appetizers and entrees. They also have my favorite GF beer, Omission as well as as the BJ's berry cider and another pear cider. My husband and I ordered the broccoli cheddar soup, caesar salad and a GF pizza to share. Our friends' ordered the wedge salad, sriracha mac and cheese and the grilled salmon with rice and asparagus.  The salads were both good. The lettuce was crisp with not too much dressing. The soup was terrible. It got cold really fast so it was thick and goopy and I couldn't eat it anymore. My friend loved her sriracha mac and cheese. I wish they had a GF pasta option so I could try it! Her bf loved the salmon too but thought his asparagus was weird because it was really skinny and soft. Our GF pizza was just okay. It definitely was not the best GF pizza I've ever had. I've honestly had better GF pizza from Dominos. The crust was too thin and hard and the toppings just fell off the crust every where. It was really disappointing. I didn't have enough room in my belly to try the GF pizookie but I hope to try it the next time I come in."
Lindsay M.,"Carlsbad, CA",154,2,,5.0,10/23/2017,"This BJ's location is my all time favorite, but what made it even better was Andres P, our waiter. He was super friendly and made my family who is visiting from NY, where we don't have this chain near us... he made them feel so welcome and was super polite and attentive to all of their needs, which sometimes can be a lot at once. Lol. The 5 meat pizza was awesome and he kept our drinks coming. Excellent service. Thanks so much!"
Kaiou Q.,"La Mesa, San Diego, CA",0,12,5,3.0,7/28/2017,"Sat on the patio next to an obnoxious 8 top That was running out server ragged. Food wasn't that good. Had boneless wings and a flat bread. Flat bread was good wings not so much. Service was slow but understandable , Wasn't his fault. Patio was filthy and throughout our entire dinner no one attempted to prebus or bus any of them.  Recommend for something quick and easy not for a date or special event"
Doria F.,"BONITA, CA",3,3,,1.0,7/17/2017,"I know this is late, but I never thought of doing this until one of my guests said "" you should put that on yelp""! I have always liked BJ's, thought they were a great place to go with family or friends, and that is why I decided to have my fundraiser there.  Got in touch with the proper people, got it set up, the day finally came, and all my people and their friends and family came. So I thought this is going to be great! I'm going to have a nice check for our donation to Alzheimer's San Diego group!! So, the day came and went, I waited and waited for any kind of email or phone call. Nothing!! The day of the event came, and I asked them if there was a donation, no, no donation from BJ's!! I hope no one else has had this hard of a time getting their donation money!  Needless to say, none of us will ever patronize them again, don't ever try to have a fundraiser there you won't get your funds!!!"
Joanne A.,"Spring Valley, CA",61,35,332,4.0,6/21/2017,"We were a party of 6 at around 5:30 pm and the place looked a little busy.  I was told the wait could be around 20 minutes.  The staff at the counter offered to text me as soon as a table was ready.  We had a table ready in less than 10 minutes which was great! I wanted to take advantage of the happy hour menu but it turned out that we had to sit by the bar to take advantage of that.  Our server showed us the daily specials and today, Wednesday, the special was loaded burgers with unlimited fries.  We ordered the portobello Swiss, hickory brisket bacon, guacamole deluxe on a veggie patty (yes! vegetarian burgers were also an option) and a couple bacon cheeseburgers.  There was no need for extra fries because our meals very very filling. As busy as the place was, our server made sure we had our glasses refilled when needed and checked if we were enjoying our food.  Today was also one free pizookie per table day.  Oh, how I missed this dessert.  The warm gooey goodness of chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream did not disappoint.  We also ordered the white chocolate pizookie.  I have to admit, that was clever marketing I saw on Facebook.  I'm such a sucker for free food ads. That was the main reason I came here.  However, I was hoping to save a little bit more money by also taking advantage of the happy hour menu.  Nevertheless, we still enjoyed our meals. I should've Yelped this before when we came here months ago but one of the servers named Toby was top notch.  I'll never forget how he made our party felt when we came here for my client's birthday.  He had a great, personable demeanor. He alone being our server that day would've been 5 stars had I posted a review back then so I'm mentioning this now."
Kat N.,"La Mesa, CA",0,23,,5.0,10/12/2017,"We can always count on BJ's for good food and outstanding service. Servers are all very friendly, which means management cares about its employees."
Kim U.,"San Diego, CA",15,30,3,2.0,8/7/2017,"What on earth is happening to this BJ's?  Could it possibly be the extremely rude, dirty, unapologetic female manager with apparently no managerial or hospitality training and no social skills whatsoever is ruining everything???  Here's the lowdown about BJ's La Mesa; The stores GM, Braxton is truly fabulous.  He genuinely cares about the customers and the restaurant.  I have no doubt he's doing his best with what he's got to work with.  Also, the food (when and if you get it) is usually pretty decent.  We've had a few bad servers once in awhile and some messed up orders here and there, but the real complaint is with ""that"" woman manager.  Why and how she still has a job in the hospitality industry is puzzling.  We have seen her put her fingers in food, throw her servers under the bus, treat busboys horribly, had her been rude to us, make unprofessional comments, ignore guest requests and more.   I haven't taken the time to write a review because some of the experiences we've had are just unreal and I didn't feel it was worth my time.  I'm only writing now because it's my last straw and this latest fiasco didn't even involve us.   So the man and woman seated next to us apparently had cold, not great food.  They let their waitress know and were both very nice about it.  Waitress was super nice, promptly apologized, offered to replace their food and was letting the manager know.  It took 10-15 minutes and guess who comes out?  Yep-""that"" manager.  The guests explained the problem with the food to her and added a nice compliment about their waitress.  Manager spent all of one minute speaking with them in a not friendly tone whatsoever, offered ZERO apology, completely ignored the kind words about her wait staff and simply said she would take it off the bill and walked away.  Even with our past experience, our jaws hit the floor.  I turned to look at our neighbors who just looked dumbfounded.  It took another 10-15 minutes for them to receive their check.   Having ""that"" manager treat us regulars crappy is one thing-but it was entirely different seeing it happen to someone else.  We will be calling ahead to make sure she's not working before going back.  Pretty sad from a group that used to visit 1-3 times a week.  :("
