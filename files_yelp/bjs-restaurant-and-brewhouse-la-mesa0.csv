Nadeem R.,"La Mesa, CA",51,44,59,4.0,8/12/2015,"I have visited this restaurant, specially this location so many times for the past few years, because they open late, they have a good food and close to my house. But I have never thought to review it on yelp, until last night. This review is for the great service we got from CAITLIN, as a person works in the food industry and have been in so many places, I could say this is the best service I have ever had. She made our visit so pleasant, all my friends were so happy and talking about how great she was. Thank you CAITLIN."
Alan D.,"Chula Vista, CA",31,34,23,2.0,6/17/2016,Solid appetizer.. but it took forever and a day for it to come out. COOKS fault not server I understand that. So moving on to entree server forgot my drink 3 times and then got my order wrong. Bad experience just gonna order app from now on and call it done
T B.,"Sonoma, CA",21,13,3,2.0,11/17/2016,"We've been coming to this BJ's for at least 10 years, probably longer. I'd say we average eating here 25 times a year and we've always had great food and great service, with a few exceptions throughout the years(it happens). Tonight we had a play at the kids school that didn't end until 8 so we decided to use curbside pickup for the first time. Order was supposed to be ready at 8:15, we arrived at 8:10 and called to let them know we had arrived and to pay so we could get the kids home, fed and in bed(they're 6 months, 7 & 9 years old). They didn't come out to take the card until 8:20 and said the food will be right out. 8:35 rolls around and the guy comes out with just our card, no food, and says they messed up the kids cheese pizza(didn't put cheese on it?), he said we took those off the bill and the food will be right out. 8:45 he brings the food and we head home. When we get home I noticed my pizza was missing the garlic and cilantro and my wife's baked potato had no topping on the side. No sour cream, butter, cheese or anything.... and of course the only meals that were hot was the kids pizzas. Very disappointing having to microwave our meals after sitting in the car waiting for 35 minutes with a baby screaming and daughter crying because she's hungry and tired. Overall very disappointed with the curbside experience. Will it stop us from coming back? Probably not but might take a break!!"
Teresa M.,"El Cajon, CA",32,6,2,5.0,5/18/2016,"We visited tonight 5/18 for an early dinner 5:45pm. The hostess staff was very friendly. Right away they saw we had a young child with us and sat us with a high chair and kids packet. Our waitress also brought us a ""kids starter"" which is assorted fruit and a bread roll. (I wish I took a picture). We each had salad, and then shared a pizza and pizookie. Everything came out at an appropriate time and was up to our standards. We love their pizza. We will be back, definitely family friendly service and food!"
Chelse G.,"Santee, CA",73,11,9,1.0,3/11/2016,So disappointed! So the last 2 times I've been here I've had an issue with hair in my food! Gross! And the second time the waitress bent down next to my table and told me that there's a bunch of old ladies who work in the back who don't tie up their hair or give a shit about the rules. Um fire them then! She said they are asked to wear hairnets and a hat but they don't. Or they don't know how to take care of themselves. I've got my meal for free each time but I don't care at this point I'm not coming back. Hell no. Get your shit together bjs. That's absolutely disgusting.
Shawn H.,"El Cajon, CA",59,13,10,1.0,2/26/2016,This is the second time i have had terrible service tonight they forgot to put in are food order and we sat there for an hour I will not be back
Ronnie D.,"San Diego, CA",0,13,,1.0,12/11/2016,Consistently horrible.  I've eaten at numerous at different locations.   Service is always terrible.   Food is disappointing. Steer clear
Lena L.,"La Mesa, CA",8,115,9,4.0,3/31/2016,"Love BJs!!! Love the parmesan crusted chicken, Pot roast, love the Ribeye steak, the jambalaya is bomb, chili, clam chowder all yummy, & pizzas are pretty good (not enough cheese tho). I LOVE LOVE LOVE almost all the pizookies. So sad s'mores pizookie is NLA. One of my fave pizookies ever! I would give this location 5 stars, except food is sometimes inconsistent. I think dinner chefs makes yummier steaks...cooked perfectly per request . We had steak for lunch a couple times here and they weren't cooked as well. Asked for a medium today & received a well done steak. Still yummy, but was overcooked. The same thing happened a few months back when we ordered steak for lunch. Overall food/entrees during dinner pretty much tastes better than during lunch hours. For lunch, maybe we will stick to their pizzas."
Jen H.,"San Diego, CA",484,237,1113,4.0,12/6/2013,"Yeah- it's a chain restaurant. And a pretty dang good one ! Ever not know what you want to eat??? Promise you'll most likely find something here ! They have a fairly huge menu! I think I have been here at least 20 times and had only great experiences. There was a few times when slower than usual - but that's understandable given how busy this place can be - and that's really just a few times out of the many many I've been.  Came here for the bajillionth time two days ago for lunch. Lunch specials are 11-3 Monday to Friday and they have a great selection ! My favorite is the Southern Fried Chicken for $6.95- it's the perfect portion and it's soooooo delicious. It's delicious mashed potatoes garnished with corn ...a delicious tender fried chicken is nestled on top and a delicious sauce is poured over. This time I got the spaghetti and meat sauce for $7.95 and it included a salad or soup. I love pasta ! Pasta was al dente and sauce was great- huge portions for lunch. Also included two garlic breads. Score! I got the chilli...it was mediocre at best ... not horrible but nothing to rave about. It was a simple chilli- not much flavor to it. I also tried the corn fritters appetizer. For $2.95 ... I couldn't be disappointed no matter what. This appetizer though was amaze-balls(literally !) - it was corn balls with bacon aoili..... Sooooooo good. Came with 4 pieces. Definitely recommend this - esp at such a great price. Knocked down a star because while all their food is pretty good - a lot of it can also be pretty bland and flavorless. Easy classics like spaghetti, Alfredo , soups , and breadsticks are good but just not that great. Luckily great prices and atmosphere make up for most of that :)  Always a hostess/host at the front which is nice. I never once had to wait and look around for someone. Great other selection of food (including their famous deep dish pizzas), unique beers with a great selection, and of course their famous pizookie dessert ... Yum.  All around a great place for lunch, dinner, and happy hour. Service is always pleasant. They do their job- nothing extraordinarily spectacular. Nothing less. Pizookie - go for it !"
Vera R.,"San Diego, CA",0,6,,1.0,12/8/2016,"Horrible service, deplorable women's bathroom - no TP at 6:30PM soiled diaper on the floor body fluid drip marks on the tiled walls...DISGUSTING...I call out Management! Get your act together."
Jessica R.,"La Mesa, CA",45,32,52,3.0,7/16/2015,"I'm not going to lie...I've been to this location a handful of times...and never had good service. I had pretty much given up on this place. But I went there 2 days ago...and the service was awesome...our waitress""Tina"" was great. She was super friendly, got us everything we needed, and above in beyond. She has renewed my faith in this place. There buffalo chicken pizza is my favorite. But honestly all there food is good. And the ""Pizookie's"" are amazing!!!!"
Anaka B.,"San Diego, CA",1,1,,5.0,2/11/2015,"I've been here a million times and have always had mediocre service. The past three times I've been in, Trevor was our waiter. I have to be honest, he is the reason I'm writing this review. Trevor is the exact definition of an exceptional server- his section is always packed and by packed I mean 10-15 tables at one time. Every time he's helped us out, he's been the only server in that section and has still done above and beyond.  Of course with that many tables, there's gonna be a bit of a wait. Trevor does the best he can with his time- takes our order, drinks come out right after, food comes out in a decent time, checks up on you multiple times and still waiting on ten other tables at the same time. I'm in the industry and from experience I can say they service he gives is not only consistent but beyond what you'd expect for one server in a packed full bar.  Kudos to you Trevor, you're a beast waiter!!!"
Will K.,"San Diego, CA",518,541,110,4.0,4/16/2014,"We did NOT want to come here.  It's not that I'm 'anti chain"", just that lately, it's been fun to eat 'local'.  Stuck due to timing and location, we defaulted to coming to BJ's.  We had a good time.   - The apetizers are pretty good (not great). - Prices are a bit high. - Service is phenominal, and quick.   - Thier house brews are great tasting and a good variety of them on tap.   For a place that just screams ""box store"", it's pretty good."
Rachel S.,"El Cajon, CA",1,51,4,1.0,1/25/2016,"Super over this place changing their menu!! Boo!! No more thai mango salad, mahi mahi with fried rice, chicken noodle soup, and corn fritters. All things I order which is annoying!! Clean up the nasty stuff on the menu not the delicious stuff. Rude"
Wesley L.,"San Diego, CA",3,15,7,4.0,3/20/2016,Had the ham and cheese sandwich. It is really good I would recommend. Must have come on a busy night took 25 minutes to get seated. When we were seated food came out at different times. Had to wait on condiments for several minutes and only had one refill the whole time
Heini L.,"Santee, CA",62,7,12,5.0,5/24/2016,I had lunch with my mother today . We had a great experience ! The flatbread was delicious . Our waiter was polite and very attentive . His name was Alex. We will definitely be back!
Jeff L.,"Goodyear, AZ",2,2,1,5.0,9/25/2016,"This BJ's is great. We came in on a busy Sunday night and we're seating promptly. Our waitress, Sam, was awesome. Our order was correct and food was delicious. We had a Cobb salad and the Parmesan crusted chicken."
Nick W.,"El Cajon, CA",92,6,,1.0,1/18/2015,Last time it was 2 hrs for a pizza and a soda (never got a refill)... This time 2 hrs for a burger and a soda (thankfully got 1 refill though I asked for more)... The food was cold. Order was wrong. Wife's pasta was frozen and rubbery. Then we waited another 30 min because the check was rung up incorrectly .... Spent over 3 hrs at this dump. Hire more than 1 waitress to run your entire patio. Fool me once shame on me fool me twice and I'll never return.
b j.,"San Diego, CA",1,26,1,2.0,12/8/2014,"Staffed mostly by inexperienced high school and college students. Pastas are bland, but decent portions; steak is poorly seasoned and tough.  During our first and last vist: Twenty minutes after placing our order an asst mgr came by with the server to tell us they were sold out of the dish one of our group of four ordered. We chose an alternate dish but 30 minutes later still none of the dishes were out - they were holding all of them hostage till the steak was ready.  When served, everything but the steak was cold. They were not special orders... The uninterested manager who left his personality at home, removed 2 dishes from our tab. In the end, it's hard to blame the kids running the restaurant; heck what did I know at 17..."
Martin S.,"El Cajon, CA",0,30,4,1.0,4/23/2016,Totally mismanaged restaurant. Two and a half hours of a dining experience in a slow afternoon is not my idea of a good restaurant. I understand cutting back on staff is important but not at the expense of bad service.
