Kristin D.,"Santee, CA",2,14,,5.0,5/14/2017,"Absolutely love this place! Is my go to for weekend dinner date nights with the hubby. We had an astounding waiter tonight who exceeded customer service expectations tremendously. When arrived, I was greeted with a Mother's Day pin, and our waiter Toby C was very attentive, & kind. He was very personable and pleasant, I would say probably the best customer service I have ever had. Definitely will be back!"
Katy'sgirl F.,"Lemon Grove, CA",0,43,42,3.0,10/20/2016,"I ordered a Margherita flat bread, it was ok and needed tomato. The side salad of greens with goat cheese, cranberries and dressing was great! Their mild lager beer was delicious too. Customer service is good. Doors needed a wipe down. First appearance is important expecially in a restaurant."
Rob Paradise ..,"San Diego, CA",3,115,1,4.0,4/1/2017,"Shrimp pasta and Cobb salad = filling and tasty. Our server, Andres, was TOP NOTCH. This guy was friendly, and attentive. Found a coupon for $10 off $35 in the L.A. Times - made the visit even better."
Bree E.,"El Cajon, CA",0,1,,5.0,9/9/2017,Came today for a late lunch and my experience was great!! I got the Parmesan crusted chicken which was amazing! although one of my pieces was undercooked the server took care of it and also had the manager come and apologize. They had it remade and taken off the bill and was very attentive after the fact. Great service!!! Definitely how it should be. :)
Joe Y.,"Brea, CA",15,47,6,5.0,2/23/2017,"Stopped by while in the San Diego area for cocktails and appetizer's. We enjoyed our experience. Our server, Paige, was attentive  and pleasant."
LyKai J.,"San Diego, CA",1,17,3,5.0,5/7/2017,"Love this place! Great food, fun and customer service. Me and my hubby love to come here. We are also apart of the reward program and it has great perks. Yay!"
Melad T.,"Spring Valley, CA",1,6,17,1.0,4/16/2017,Horrible service. Yes it was a Sunday but it was not busy at all. It took 45 minutes for bringing out a cali club sandwich and the waiter brings it out with no potato wedges. They also mixed our wing sauce wrong and everyone who got there after us left before us. You bet they didn't get a tip!
Billy M.,"San Diego, CA",74,7,,1.0,1/28/2017,"Terrible services been waiting for ages for everything my drink has been empty for the majority of the time, food is mediocre, no frozen mugs for the craft soda, I'm paying for the experience not the food because the food is no where worth the cost, so if the food and the service sucks why is it so expensive."
Chris A.,"Bonita, CA",123,63,8,2.0,3/11/2017,"Where to begin...I would have just written this off as a bad experience that was a serious comedy of errors by the staff of the restaurant, but I noticed that many other customers also had similar complaints  So what's the problem? Leadership and training.  From the beginning of the ""call ahead"" where we were told there was a 50 minute wait from the time of our call (turned out to be an hour and a half). Prior proper planning prevents poor performance.  The fact is that they didn't have a table and it appears that in an effort to prevent walkways  they give a time that they cannot live up to.. I knew there was a problem when the hostess told me that they were trying to get a table from outside to put one together for our group..finally we were given a choice of a booth for our group of 7 or wait around until a table became available. Having waited for so long my wife wanted to take the table (I ended sitting in a chair in the isle. So they are trying right? While I appreciate effort from the hostess (they were embarrassed) it got worse.  As we were sitting at the table my wife slipped and fell on the floor.  In an effort to turn over the tables quickly they did not clean up properly. Again this  is not  an anomaly, other patrons have complained about the same situation. The floor was wet and greasy.  While the effort was made to clean it up the experience at this restaurant was just going from bad to worse. So we make our order and we wait again. So...food on a busy night one should expect some additional wait time.. no big deal, but when it comes it should be hot and ready to eat. My wife's Pizza was barely warm and so I asked them to warm it up. They took the pizza and we waited again...10 minutes...15 minutes...20 minutes and finally the pizza. The young woman tells us that they dropped our other Pizza and had to remake it. No one came to tell us and so we waited. By now half of our party was done with food and we were staring at a large Pizza and we had had enough. The only reason I gave 2 stars was that the manager or supervisor came by and apologized and gave us a gift card for all the mistakes. In summary, the restaurant does not have bad food not great but it's what you expect when you go out to a chain establishment. But even a chain establishment should be organized in such a manner that they should be prepared for this type volume of service. Training, training, training. As a business owner and a manager of service personnel I would say that there is a deficiency in the area of organizational management at this establishment. The other reviews appear to back this up. Whomever has the opportunity to read and consider these reviews should rethink their training program. There's an old saying that anything worth doing is worth doing well and as of right now you are not!"
Glenn W.,"San Diego, CA",0,39,,2.0,4/11/2017,"I ordered the pulled pork sandwich, big mistake. Imagine leaving a handful of shredded pork on a hot sidewalk for 3 days, then putting it in a sandwich. That's what this tasted like! Very tough, very dry, tasteless. The waiter came back to see how everything was too soon...before I had a chance to take a bite. Then didn't see him again til the check was due. Not even a water refill! Normally, I would have tracked him down and sent it back, maybe try the pizza or another dish. But I had a date and didn't want to look like a whiner or make her wait for the exchange. She had the chicken alfredo, didn't say much about it but only ate half the plate. Maybe she didn't want to look like a whiner too (?). Two stars instead of one because: (a) last time I ate there, it was ok -- not memorable, but good enough to try again, and (b) the fries were good."
Morgan B.,"Jamul, CA",1,21,,3.0,4/7/2017,"We loved our waiter but unfortunately the food took foreverrrrrrr. Great food, nice workers, just unfortunately very long waits."
Cindy V.,"San Diego, CA",0,7,,5.0,4/26/2017,"I love love my bazookies, they are so so yum yum. And the pasta thing in the deep dish was so Good! . I'll be back for more."
Roslyn T.,"Lemon Grove, CA",1,40,38,2.0,10/21/2016,"Went for dinner on a Friday night around 6:30 and it was packed, but not overcrowded.  Ordered the shrimp penne with green beans. That is thee most terrible dish I've ever had at BJ's. Not seasoned well, green beans were hard. I honestly don't know what I was thinking, shrimp and green beans don't even go together. Chef BJ, that dish is a fail. Flagged down the waitress to order something else (first time EVER sending food back to the kitchen because it wasn't good). I ordered the blackened salmon which was DELICIOUS but the waitress forgot to bring it and blamed it on someone else. It took 20 minutes to get my order. The manager was nice and brought me a salad while I waited. We ordered a chocolate chunk pazookie which most of the cookie was stuck to the bottom of the pan and we had to dig it out. All in all not a good experience."
Mica J.,"San Diego, CA",0,2,2,1.0,8/31/2017,"Don't bother making a reservation, they won't honor it. After waiting over 30 mins past our reservation time, the manager decided to get very sassy about not being able to do anything. That's apparent you can't even manage a restaurant."
Freddy B.,"El Cajon, CA",2,14,2,3.0,3/9/2017,For some reason it just feels like their food is dropping in quallity. I am just not as satisfied as the first day I went there. They are not bad but Im not a fan. Overall its ok if you have no where to go.
Wilson S.,"El Cajon, CA",180,17,2,1.0,12/31/2016,"First time dining here with a friend, and it didn't go so well... Even though we were seated swiftly, we were left with two menus with which to entertain ourselves. Followed by 20 minutes of neglect, we were forced to go next door to Casa De Pico... While I admit it was moderately busy, it was quite pathetic and embarrassing. It was only until we decided to exit did the host attempted to service us... Not a good impression BJ's, especially since we were seated, had drinks delivered, and had food in about the same amount of time next door."
Peter M.,"El Cajon, CA",107,3,,1.0,11/20/2016,"Im not one to complain...ever, but tonight we experienced the worst service i have ever had at a restaurant. And a corporate restaurant where money is spent to properly train each worker rather than just throw them on the floor and see how they work out!.. My wife, her friend,husband and child and I chose Bjs in La Mesa and once we walked in the door around 10 p.m we were greeted and seated very generously by the hostess. Then took our server about 8 minutes to finally greet us and take our drink order. Then it took about 10 minutes to receive half our drinks and not even the child drink yet ,the child drink and the rest of our drinks came another 4 minutes after that! Again we came in at 10 p.m and restaurant was not busy and there were plenty of servers on the floor since Bjs is open till 1 a.m. We ordered an app and our food, then that was the last we seen of our server..(till later on in the story). 10 min later our app comes,by expo.(ok timing) 20 min later again only half of our dinners came,by expo...then finally another 15 minutes the other half of our dinners come,by expo and since the first half waited to eat till the rest came ,their food was cold.. And none of us at the table have complained or asked why the time issues and where is our server yet, we were just trying to give them the benefit of the doubt and think maybe there is something happening we dont know about that is causing them to have food time and or server issues. By this time our drinks are empty and we have dirty plates crowding the table from the app. about 10 minutes after we are trying to eat our cold dinner without any condiments cause we havent been checked on and no drinks to wash anything down..we see a HUGE party, 35+ people walk in and before i knew for sure everybody would be busy i finally get up and seek a manager and simply ask for assistance at our table. And at this time i see our server walk out from the back and go straight to the party. So a manager and another server come prebus our table and just bring the condiments we needed 20+ minutes and about 6 more glasses of waters and tea that instead needed to just be  ""re-filled""..so now we have more stuff crowding our table again. Then didnt see the manager or any server for about another 25 min. Finally the ""expo"" comes and takes our plates and the manager comes and ask for any more drink refills from the bar, seriously? Way too late now! But friends husband orders a dessert and gets that brought out in about 12 minutes. Finally we get our check..from our original server!?!.and 1 check! when we asked in the very beginning to please split only 2 ways and he even took the order split in his notepad. So i wait 7 min for him to come back and ask him to fix it. But he never comes back so i get up and ask the manager to check me out and i mention that it was supposed to be split but im just going to pay the whole bill so we can leave now and specifically not to split it anymore. I go back to my table and then the original server walks up to the manager and has her split the checks and brings them back to me. Then i got a lil angry and told him i told the manager not split it and just run my card for the whole bill..he already ran it for half!!! So now he goes back and runs it again for a  second time for the other half of the bill!!! Then he proceeds to stay at the table and explain there was nothing he could do to of been of more help to us cause he was busy with the HUGE party! Then i got a lil more angry and said who was in charge of assigning the party to you and not assigning another server to take over our table? He said the manager but there was still nothing he could of done. Are you kidding me? We paid the full bill a lil over $100. We didnt even ask for any comps..we didnt even get an apology."
Sammy T.,"Spring Valley, CA",32,25,48,4.0,5/29/2016,Good atmosphere and food. They have the best chicken wings in San Diego. They are very flavorful with just the right amount of sauce. Try the traditional wings.
John P.,"Spring Valley, CA",0,41,7,4.0,8/22/2017,We returned here after a couple of years and fortunately had Ashley as our server again. Another great experience.
Marcia P.,"San Diego, CA",0,18,,5.0,3/30/2017,The food and wine were great.  I was there last Saturday. My friend and I had wine and flatbread.  It was the best food I had an a long time.  Definitely I will go back.  The service was fast and friendly.
