Cheyenne W.,"El Cajon, CA",255,3,,5.0,3/29/2017,"Went back, after a not so great last time there, was served by a guy named andrew who was absolutely flawless. a really understanding and patient guy with a great seat on the patio! definitely need more servers like andrew, as our last server was not anywhere close. definitely will be back and will makes sure to ask for him!"
Betsi C.,"La Mesa, CA",0,10,,5.0,3/27/2017,"We went to BJ's on Saturday March 25th. We had a reservation for 8 people. Our server Andre was delightful! He was very helpful with the menu and extremely patient with the kids (3 grand boys). We frequent this BJ's since we live in La Mesa. It is our go-to restaurant. The food, beer and handcrafted sodas were delicious. Andre made this experience very enjoyable. He deserves a raise! Thanks BJ's as always."
Nick T.,"La Mesa, CA",1,24,2,5.0,8/21/2015,"Jessica is a great server! Really nice and funny, she knew a ton about the menu. Food was fab-U-lous per usual. Can't go wrong with a pizookie and a brew. Was slightly off-put by Renaissance styled baby paintings across from my seat, but otherwise an excellent experience.  (Not to be a total narc but hostess was openly on cell phone)"
Mark G.,"La Mesa, CA",0,2,,1.0,2/25/2017,Atmosphere was fine but the WORST deep dish pizza ever!  It was like a big loaf of bread with a very modest amount of toppings.  Simply terrible and pricey to boot.
Jonathan P.,"San Diego, CA",42,6,4,5.0,5/16/2017,I went there in a large group with children and they were very accommodating. Our waitress Sam was very attentive and informative and was excellent overall. The food was fantastic and the wait was relatively short despite there being an evening rush. And since it was my girlfriend's birthday they put a candle on a pizookie that she ordered. Its a great place for dinner thats reasonably priced and their craft beer isn't to shabby either.
Melissa A.,"San Diego, CA",34,81,6,2.0,12/26/2016,Too loud and slow service at 1pm.  Waiter was very serious and I felt rushed to order.
Dabrena S.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",36,215,52,4.0,8/1/2015,I've been to a couple different locations and they never seem to disappoint.  This last time I ordered the Brussels Sprouts appetizer and the Ahi salad and both were delicious. I would highly recommend them.  I would not go here on a lunch break if you only have an hour though. They tend to take a while and seem to be pretty busy with the lunch rush.
Margherita T.,"Big Bear Lake, CA",0,2,,5.0,2/10/2017,Richard went above and beyond! Greatest experience at Bj's so far and it was all because of him!! Thanks Richard!
Amber Z.,"San Diego, CA",4,7,,5.0,1/19/2017,"Brought my team here for a holiday get together and Braxton helped us get set up on the patio.  It was pretty much private, the food was on point and our server, Princess, was very attentive.  Our whole team felt relaxed and we had a great time - thanks guys!!!"
Cathy S.,"La Mesa, CA",0,1,,1.0,11/3/2016,"I'm so frustrated!!  I ordered my lunch on the mobile app, and drive to curb side pick up.  I used Mobil pay, which I love.  Now the frustrating part, I drive back to work to enjoy my lunch in my car and there is NO eating utensils!!   WHY would you not place utensils with a to go order? Why?????"
Max M.,"San Diego, CA",0,2,,2.0,2/13/2017,"The service was the best part, and it wasn't great. Food is mediocre at best, and the prices are quite high. I'm definitely not coming back"
Shirley G.,"San Diego, CA",224,706,1124,4.0,7/14/2015,"It was my first time coming to BJ's with my boyfriend by ourselves as to always coming here with a group on numerous occasions. Anyways, sat in the bar area and ordered the sriracha roasted brussel sprouts as an appetizer to share and it was pretty tasty. For my entree I ordered the gluten free crust which I added ham & pineapple as the toppings for $1 each. It was my first time trying out gluten free crust and I was happy that it tasted pretty good! It reminded me of a thin crust because it was crunchy and overall was a decent pizza. My boyfriend got a burger which he devoured and washed it down with a cold beer."
Marissa D.,"Spring Valley, CA",0,6,9,4.0,1/15/2017,"I went there on January 15th of 2017. I had a table of 4 and it took us about 10 minutes to wait. I got seated and ordered boneless wings as an appetizer. I had to wait over 40 minutes for it but when it finally arrived I also got the rest of the food I ordered. The waiter was very friendly and told us the kitchen was backed up so I understood why I waited a long time. I was luckily occupied by their kids menu, so I was able to play all the games on the paper. Overall the food was great and the dessert was delicious."
Desiree V.,"Lakeside, CA",0,12,5,5.0,1/5/2017,My daughter and I had a wonderful experience at BJ's bar and grill! Our server was named Ryan B. If you ever go to this location request him he was awesome! He was on top of everything and even saw me looking at my phone at a coupon and made sure to put it on my check before I could even show him myself!! I love this restaurant and their food is phenomenal I highly recommend coming to this location!!
Megan L.,"El Cajon, CA",5,47,4,5.0,5/31/2017,"This is an update on a past review which I was not happy. After my initial review, Braxton, the manager contacted me via Yelp with apologies and a voucher to come back and try again. Really appreciated that. Now just leaving from dinner and everything was great. Our server, Sarah J, was AWESOME. She deserves recognition for sure."
Dave F.,"El Cajon, CA",101,2,40,1.0,6/28/2017,Its been many years since ive been to this restaurant due to the fact that 2x I was served pizza with raw dough. My wife wanted to go and so I agreed. About a 10 min wait no big deal. Then we were seated right next to the service doors to the wash and cook area. Every time someone walked in or out a foul stinch would emit from the cleaning/cook area. Then I happened to look inside one of the times (and quite a few times after) and saw the messiest area ive ever seen in my life ontop of the smell. So that grossed me and my wife out. So then to finish the waiter charged us for two drinks for our two kids that was suppossed to be included also charged us adult price for the kids cookie desert they have. Will I go back?  Nope. I never worked in a restaurant and can understand things get dropped and dishes pile up but this was beyond.
Sue M.,"Alpine, CA",0,3,,1.0,7/15/2017,"Have been there many times and enjoyed it. Our last visit was terrible, not the food, but our waitress and then the store manager who came to our table twice. We had a couple things go wrong with our food, their error. And store manager was sooo rude and never even offered a complimentary dessert or anything. Had that been offered, I wouldn't be writing this review.  But she's DEFINITELY in wrong business bcuz she has absolutely NO PR skills at all. It was soooo bad that I called Corporate to report what went on, and I've never done that before. So.....never going back and telling everyone I know about horrible experience."
Kelle R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,26,7,4.0,12/4/2016,"Our server Sarah was amazing.  The food at BJ's is good,  but it's the staff that makes it a great experience.  The wait was long (about 35 min - it was Sat night) but once we were seated,  the meal moved quickly.  I had the boneless chicken wings in garlic cheese and they were delicious and a large portion.  We also had the ahi appetizer, which was fresh and filling with the wonton chips. My watermelon basil Margarita was refreshing. I know the red and October beers were a hit at my table as well."
Ed G.,"El Cajon, CA",21,138,1990,4.0,8/15/2015,"Tonight was one of the best evening meals I've had in a while!    We ordered from the appetizer side of the menu to keep it on the light side. We shared the Flatbread California Pizza(8pcs of deliciousness). It comes with diced chicken, chunks of real bacon, fresh diced avocado and tomatoes on a thin crispy flat bread crust.  The 4 sliders with fries was the perfect sharing size. In fact, 3 were eaten and the fourth went home for a midnight snack. An order of the 10 piece Root beer glazed chicken wings were just the right amount of spicy but I personally couldn't taste any root beer flavoring.  Topped the meal off with a chocolate chip chunk Pizookie(baked in a tin, is a chocolate chip cookie with vanilla bean ice cream ala mode)."
Tea J.,"El Cajon, CA",62,155,102,3.0,10/22/2016,Went to eat lunch for my son's 18th birthday. Both him & my friend got a burger they said it was really good. Service was ok .. Bathroom was kind of dirty . But of all everything was good.
