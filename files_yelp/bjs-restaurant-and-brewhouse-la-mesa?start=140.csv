Lizzie R.,"San Diego, CA",228,167,1316,2.0,2/14/2015,Okay so other than taking far too long for a phone order. I was facetious and didn't check the order before I left. I got home to discover the Buffalo chicken pizza was not that at all it had bacon on it which totally killed the entire dinner mood since a guest didn't eat pork. Had to drive back and wait another 20 minutes to get the correct pizza. The only saving grace was that they threw in a pazooki for the inconvenience but I will never go back to this establishment!
Cheryl S.,"La Mesa, CA",1,19,5,3.0,6/5/2017,"We come here quite a bit - today was such a disappointment. We were seated immediately (off to a great start). It took almost 4 minutes to get acknowledged that we had been seated. We ordered and 24 minutes later we got our food. I actually spoke to the manager who apologized for the slow service and said they were short a cook (yet it was not a busy day). Then we heard a server yelling in the back. He came out from the doors went right back in and yelled ""this is me yelling"". It was quite the experience and I can't say it was a great one. Late for work waiting on food - had to take it to go and a half asses apology and yelling!!! Wow BJs get it together."
Nadia S.,"El Cajon, CA",27,5,1,1.0,3/11/2017,"This evening we went in for dinner with a party of 9 at the Grossmont BJ's we ordered 5 house salads to start with we were served the smalls house salad I have ever seen we come often to Bj so it was quite of a surprise to see the portion they served us since I have ordered these items before I asked the waiter why these portions were so small he said that the manager  told the people in the back to portion them to smaller amount. I asked to speak with the manager her name was Nastasia  she was very rude passed me twice and pretended not to see me until I got another waitress to get her for me she seem frazzled, annoyed, irritated, could care less,I explained I am a regular customer who comes often here with my family and I was surprised that there salads were so small for amount we payed for them and if I knew they had changed the portion I would never had ordered them. She blamed corporate for the change and removed only 2 out of 5 and walked away I just felt she should have removed all of them and at that point the next time I come I would not order them anymore. But I will say the waiter Toby was a sweet and patient and very helpful with us with our order and when he went on break Summer took over and she was also sweet and very caring to finish us up. I just feel your manager could get better training how to handle customers was very disappointed this evening."
Brenda M.,"Spring Valley, CA",0,3,1,2.0,6/1/2017,Just left BJ's after waiting for our final check for 40 minutes. I had 3 kids on the table asleep because it took so long for the waitress to add up our 3 tabs which we had labeled using the number system she suggested. The waitress was super nice and extremely apologetic. Poor girl I thought she was going to walk out a few times! I can't believe management would assign her 3 large parties at the same time! One person in our party received the wrong order then had to cancel it because it took so long to come out. Waitress was nice enough to deduct the plate and wrap it up. Ultimately I would not recommend this place for big parties. We were celebrating my daughters graduation and I left apologizing to our family for the long wait. Management should have anticipated big graduation groups and had more staff on call.
Malissa B.,"Santee, CA",39,19,3,1.0,6/21/2017,"The service started out good and then it slowly turned to crap. We came here for our 4 year wedding anniversary because this was where we had our first date when we were dating . By far the worst service we have ever gotten and to top it off we were charged for our dessert which was the cookie with ice cream. I'm so upset that we got such bad service that we most likely will not be back they ruined our anniversary dinner. We never got checked on it took 2 different times to get a drink even after We got our food our server still didn't check on us even walkin by us 4 different times it took us to wave him down in order to get refills on our drinks.  I'm disappointed that even though our server knew it was a,special night still treated us like crap.. I will be calling in the morning to speak to a g.m about this as well."
Joseph D.,"San Diego, CA",52,2,,4.0,11/10/2016,Pizookies are so good! Great service tonight from Carly G. Super attentive and helpful. Thanks!
Nicole S.,"Kearny Mesa, San Diego, CA",0,2,,1.0,8/2/2016,"This place has the WORST service! Staff is lazy and forgetful. Took over 10 minutes for someone to take our drink order, and it took over an hour to get our food. The manager is just as bad. It took a week and a half for her to return my call. I'm only giving them 1 star because I can't post a review with zero stars. Never going back there again."
Rachel H.,"La Mesa, CA",171,179,47,3.0,3/9/2016,"Big issue, their policy about wait staff wearing perfume or cologne, it must be ""tasteful"" but that's the point - customers who are trying to taste their food shouldn't have to smell cologne or perfume. Our waiter tonight has some nasty smelling cologne or hair gel that just makes me feel nauseated. The wait staff here are generally pretty good though, with some exceptions. I just ordered a bison burger without bbq sauce and it came with sauce, so had to be sent back."
Jeri H.,"Santee, CA",6,21,,2.0,11/6/2016,"While making a reservation we were out on hold forever, then got hung up on. Called back and was told it was too busy so the manager would call us back, he never did. When we called again the Manager argued with me about how it was my mistake. We ordered for 10 of us and all but 3 of us got our food. All the other tables around us got their food. Our bills were a mess and we were late for our meeting. Horrible, horrible service."
Jessica S.,"San Diego, CA",235,920,2051,4.0,12/24/2013,"My BJ's Restaurant count stands at 3, with this most recent visit being number 3. Despite the fact that it was the last Friday before Christmas, and the fact that we were in a mall setting, the restaurant had a table for us surprisingly quickly. The answer to our question, ""How long is the wait for 2?"" was ""There is no wait."" Can't ask for more than that! The restaurant was pretty packed - and loud - so I was amazed that we were shown to a booth towards the back of the restaurant after less than five minutes. Our waiter was at our table within a minute, and he had our drink order back to our table within two minutes. The best part? I asked for water with lime (because I can be finicky), and when our waiter (Benjamin) came back to the table, he said that they were slicing new limes, and that he'd bring some more by in a bit. Being the cynical ass that I am, I immediately wrote that comment off as fluff, and resigned myself to having one teeny-tiny lime floating in my glass with the ice cubes. Lo and behold, not two minutes later, Benjamin comes back with a ramekin filled with lime wedges...all for me! Sometimes, it ain't so bad being wrong. =) For dinner, I ordered the Moroccan Spiced Salmon and my husband got the shrimp tacos. It was kind of a light meal for dinner, but we were planning on sharing a Pazookie for dessert, and neither of us wanted to order a heavy meal that wouldn't leave room for dessert! The food came out relatively quickly, and I must admit, though I was initially a bit disappointed by the looks of my plate, I changed my mind as I started in on it. I mean, come on - the plate is 550 calories, so it's not going to have food dripping off the edges. There were three small salmon medallions, a small scoop of couscous and steamed veggies, and a red sauce poured over it all. It smelled divine, but looked sad. But once I started eating, I realized it wasn't sad at all. There was enough food to satiate, and the flavors were surprisingly good. Though, I will say that though I could smell the cumin in the spices, I couldn't really taste it on the fish or in the sauce. I think it just got lost with all the other flavors. My husband loved his shrimp tacos. I guess it's his ""go-to"" dish...though I question having a ""go-to"" dish at a restaurant we rarely frequent. At any rate, we did end up ordering a Pazookie: the Holiday version, and boy howdy was it delicious! The flavors of the peppermint ice cream worked really well with the rich chocolate of the Pazookie batter. It wasn't too over-powering, and one dessert was perfect to share. I will say that I was surprised by the service. Benjamin was very friendly and patient, and knowledgeable about the menu. I know he must have been busy that night, but he never made me feel rushed (I couldn't decide on a dinner entree for while!), or crazy for asking questions or the things that I ordered. That goes a long way with a person like me."
Andrew L.,"El Cajon, CA",66,66,11,3.0,1/20/2015,"We've been here a few times every now and then and while the food was good there was always a service issue going on.  Our waiter was great this time around. He checked in regularly and was very friendly throughout our stay. However, the food took a long time to get to our table. 20 minutes for appetizers and over 30 minutes after we ordered for the main course. This all would have been ok, since the restaurant seemed pretty busy that day, except for the fact that the kitchen completely forgot to make a salmon plate that someone from our party ordered. Poor guy had to wait until everyone was almost done to get his food (another 15 minutes). The waiter apologized and the manager came over and told us he would take it off the bill. Everything was handled well.  I ordered the Cajun Pasta with shrimp and it surprisingly tasted better than it did with chicken (how I had it last time I was here). The reason for 3 stars is because each time we come here the wait for food is too long for a casual outing. There's a good chance I'll be back, but not very soon."
Huy D.,"San Diego, CA",33,119,198,5.0,3/1/2016,"I've been to La Mesa's BJ's so many times already and just finally decided to write a review. La Mesa's BJ's is located within the busy Grossmont Plaza. The parking lot is huge but parking can be hard to find at lunch hours as there are so many stores in this center. Ordering to go is a snap with their online system. I've dined in as well as ordered online for togo. The restaurant is big with multiple seating options so large parties can celebrate here. Service is prompt and efficient. The staff has always been friendly and welcoming. The menu is huge with many options to satisfy various cravings. Healthy eaters will be delighted by the enlightened menu with entrees scaled down in calories. Portion size for those entrees are run a little smaller on average. On this recent lunch trip, I ordered a bison burger meal that came with a side of my choice. I had the bison meat cooked medium rare and opted for grilled asparagus. The burger was delicious. The bison patty was cooked a bit over medium rare though. I enjoyed it but would have liked it more if it was right at medium rare or a bit under. The portion size was filling and could have passed for dinner as well. The price for this meal was very good at 11.50. You would be hard pressed to find a bison burger meal with a side at sitdown restaurants for that price.  5 stars BJ. Good food, good price, good service"
Lacy W.,"Henderson, NV",1,31,2,3.0,10/16/2016,The bison burger is pretty good but the bartender makes his drinks way TOO SWEET! Stick with the beer.
William M.,"Palm Springs, CA",1,2,40,3.0,5/18/2016,"The cheese sandwich was ok but nothing to write home about the quality. On the other hand, the won tons were very good, and I would order them again. The main course of top sirloin steak was over cooked, but tender. The bake potato was only warm to Baotou melt butter. Overall I would rate this experience as just OK.   I would say that I would come back here and give it a second try as the beer is good and the atmosphere friendly."
Diem L.,"San Diego, CA",78,34,9,4.0,10/13/2016,"We came here to celebrate my stepson's 15th birthday today and the Chargers's game was on. Bad idea when there is a game at any restaurant.  Too late now since we are seated and hungry. Our sever was great, however, he mentioned the kitchen is behind..great. I was being patient and understanding until I realized it's been 45 mins. I have two young children getting antsy. Food comes out and they forgot the birthday boy's dinner! Annoyed. He was apologetic. The manager comes by, Ricky, and again apologized profusely. He comp my son's dinner and also took care almost our entire tab... we still left a good tip. I really appreciate the customer service given here. Just wish they had more staff in the kitchen for crazy days like this.... food was great over all. I would come back again but def' not on game day!"
Dennis H.,"Chula Vista, CA",2,56,131,4.0,3/7/2015,"BJ is always a great place for lunch.  Usually my ""go to"" is the Cesar Salad with Shrimp or Chicken (trying to keep it lite) but I thought today I'd forget the diet and get the Grilled Chicken Alfredo fettuccine. Good choice.  My daughter had the Flame-broiled Atlantic Salmon entrée with rice pilaf and vegetables. Both dishes excellently prepared. Our server was great, iced tea & water were filled constantly. Of course you can forget dessert mini Pizookie!"
Nancy T.,"San Diego, CA",11,9,,1.0,8/13/2016,We have been giving Grossmont BJ's Bar and Gill a chance but it has never recovered from management changes and staff changes.  It use to be our favorite place to eat.  Now you need to eat a snack before going if you are hungry because it takes forever to get your food.  The menu has a lot of the same things on it but when you order your favorite things they have been changed to where you don't like them anymore it's time stop going.  Sorry to have to look for a new favorite place.  I hope all BJ's haven't changed like this one has.
Kelli S.,"Honolulu, HI",1902,1170,9782,4.0,11/12/2014,"I've been to this BJ's La Mesa location twice since moving to San Diego, and because I went by myself (twice), I never had to wait long. The first time, I went on ""National Pizookie Day"" to get my free Pizookie ... the second time, I just went to try the new ""S'Mores"" Pizookie that had recently debuted. Because I went in the late afternoon/early evening during both trips, I didn't have to wait long to get seated and served.  Here are my thoughts regarding the ""S'Mores"" Pizookie, as well as the classic ""Original"" and some of the other Pizookie creations I have tried thus far: ""BJ's Peanut Butter S'mores"": I have to admit, I was a bit doubtful of this ""S'Mores"" Pizookie because I don't like lots of marshmallow ... in any of my desserts. But I was pleasantly surprised and delighted with BJ's take on the classic campfire treat because THIS version featured a layer of creamy peanut butter. That's right--the BJ's twist features a Ghirardelli triple chocolate cookie (one of my favorites because it's super chocolaty) topped with a peanut butter layer and completed with marshmallow fluff that's baked to a golden finish and vanilla bean ice cream. I thought the marshmallow layer would be overwhelming and too much for me to handle, but I was wrong. I rather enjoyed the toasted marshmallow layer and was able to pair it nicely with the rich, chocolate cookie and rapidly melting ice cream. I felt that the vanilla ice cream melted quicker than usual while I was enjoying this treat, but probably because of the added heat from the torched marshmallow fluff. I very much enjoyed this ""S'Mores"" Pizookie and hope it won't leave the menu anytime soon. The peanut butter layer truly revolutionizes this treat and makes a world of difference. I think the only thing that would make this dessert even better is if graham cracker crumbs were used somehow, maybe to sprinkle the top of the Pizookie. ""Cookies 'n Cream Pizookie"": I've ordered this Pizookie once to share with a friend, and it was definitely reminiscent of OREO cookies. This creation features a rich, moist chocolate cookie that seems to be infused with OREO bits (or at least, it had a more cookies 'n cream-ish flavor). It's then topped off with three scoops of vanilla bean ice cream and a dollop of creamy mousse. While I'm not a huge fan of mousse, this cookies 'n cream mousse wasn't too bad and the dollop was small; it didn't overwhelm or suffocate the entire dessert. I loved the OREO-like flavor of this cookie--definitely a different texture and taste from the other Pizookies--and it was just perfect when paired with the vanilla ice cream. I think the only way to make this treat even better is to actually use cookies 'n cream ice cream instead of regular vanilla.   ""BJ's Original Pizookie"": When I'm not feeling all fancy and just want a tried-and-true favorite, I just go for the ""BJ's Original Pizookie."" Though you can choose between chocolate chunk, peanut butter and white chocolate macadamia nut when it comes to the cookies, I always do a hybrid of chocolate chunk and peanut butter (you CAN do half and half). I usually just leave the vanilla ice cream alone, but you can also substitute the vanilla with chocolate, if you prefer. But really, this chocolate-peanut butter cookie medley truly brings out the best of both worlds when it comes to Pizookies.   ""Salted Caramel Pizookie"": I've ordered this dessert to share twice, and I have to admit, my first experience getting it was awesome, but the second time, this Pizookie was too salty for my liking. I would expect the dessert to have a sweet-and-salty balance, just because it DOES include salty caramel, but I think the second time I had it, someone went overboard on the salt, which makes this sort of a hit-or-miss Pizookie in my opinion and I would probably opt for one of the other sweeter varieties instead. But it features caramel cookie dough (which was very delicious), pretzel bites (great addition) and white and dark chocolate chips. Already, this Pizookie has a lot going for it, since it features many elements not present in the other Pizookies. It's topped off with caramel sauce, vanilla bean ice cream and a Ghirardelli SQUARES dark chocolate. I'm not sure where the chefs went wrong the second time I ordered this sweet-and-salty treat, but I felt like I was biting into a salt mine. However, I'm glad that I did have a great first experience tasting this salty caramel treat. The cookie itself was great, and I enjoyed the crunch from both the pretzel bits and the white and dark chocolate chips. The ice cream paired nicely with the dish, while the salted caramel sauce added just the hint of saltiness that the sweet treat needed to make it unique."
Stephanie M.,"La Mesa, CA",0,12,,1.0,5/21/2017,The staff is nice and the food is decent.  The issue is that the restaurant is not very clean.  We've been there twice in the last couple of months.  Both times the cleanliness has been unacceptable.   The bathrooms were disgusting.  We actually had to let the hostess know both times!  This last time the dishes weren't clean either. We will not be back.
Tara J.,"San Diego, CA",279,9,,2.0,1/24/2016,"This review is only for the curbside pick up.  Tried twice to order food and pick it up, but both times were a disappointment.  Both times, the food was soggy, semi-cold, and tasted microwaved. We've always waited for at least 20 minutes once we've parked and called. Last time we went they missed half our order, but brought out the pizookie and ice cream 15 minutes before the rest came- so of course the pizookie was cold and the ice cream was melted. Overall just really disappointed, because I've never had a bad experience with BJ's.  I have eaten inside at this location, and it was fine, so maybe just avoid ordering from here for pick up!"
