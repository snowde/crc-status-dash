Linda F.,"Santee, CA",0,6,,4.0,5/4/2017,"My first time here. I'll be coming back! I had the Sante Fe Salad. It had just the right amount of spice and plenty of tender chicken. A good amount of avacado too. My sister had the tacos and said they were delicious. Our server Jade was real nice, very efficient and attentive. I would have given 5 stars except that the restroom needed a better cleaning . Plenty of parking!  Overall a great experience!"
Angie G.,"San Diego, CA",1279,430,1612,4.0,9/22/2014,"Their happy hour prices are great! The mojitos are wonderful! But stay away from the ""lite mojito"" it has no flavor!  They always have new items on the ""500 calories or less"" menu. Including the Scallops, it was really good! Considering it being BJ's and pizza is what they are mainly known for.  The bar area gets pretty crowded fast! Try to get there early."
William W.,"La Mesa, CA",34,16,3,2.0,5/2/2016,Not good!! Very loud. Under staffed. Burgers just average. Will Not be back. There are so many good places why waste your money on very average.
Cassie P.,"El Cajon, CA",5,80,145,1.0,6/29/2016,"9 of us walked in to have dinner after an extremely long day. I walked in and requested a table.  The lady in the front said she had to see if the tables were ready and disappeared for close to 10 minutes.  While she was gone,  I asked a kid behind the takeout counter if they had a kid's menu. This guy didn't utter one word to me. He left me standing at the counter and walked away.  Apparently he had to go to another desk to get the menu. He came back, handed me the menu, and still,  said nothing.  The hostess finally came back,  grabbed some menus them started screaming.  I looked up on the counter and there it was crawling slowly,  the biggest roach I've seen in a long time.  A waiter ran, grabbed a cloth napkin, snatched up the roach and no one said a word to us about it. We just turned in our menus and walked out.  We won't be back here again."
Elizabeth F.,"El Cajon, CA",3,8,1,1.0,10/10/2016,"My first time at this BJ's last Saturday and so disappointed. Called to make a reservation for our group of 8. What we originally wanted 6:00pm wasn't available but they offered 6:30pm so we adjusted our plans. Arrived to be told there was no record of our reservation and wait time would be 50 minutes. Spoke with a manager who apologized and said would work on getting a table together which brought our wait time down to about 20 minutes. Took at least an hour to get our food and another hour before we could flag down our server, who in the mean time sat down with a couple dining to chat for awhile, to bring us our check. Check was wrong, we were never offered dessert. Ordered a steak medium but was extremely well done when it came out but afraid to send it back since it took so long to come out in the first place. Maybe service is better mid week mid day but we won't be returning to find out."
Weekend W.,"San Diego, CA",0,2,,5.0,4/7/2017,"The menu is a full book, so many choices!we ordered ribs :  deliciously slightly spicy and caramelized,  Ahi poke and some lemonade vodka drink , we loved it all. Place was packed but the wait was decent , service was great, the manager Nastasia even assisted us, she was courteous and professional, we will come back."
Daphyne S.,"San Diego, CA",0,9,2,3.0,4/3/2016,It was okay.  The baby back ribs there were frickin' DELICIOUS!!  I know because i tasted my boyfriends ribs.  However my entree was okay.  I got the Mahi-mahi and shrimp dish that was supposed to be served over couscous.  But it really a stew and little pasta balls swimming in the stew rather than couscous with sauce glazed over it.  The broccoli that they brought out to me was super dry and looked so pitiful.  I had to ask the waiter for a different plate of broccoli and they brought more without a problem.   I would recommend you go to the one in mission valley.
T C.,"Lakeside, CA",44,7,18,5.0,10/2/2016,"Thanks to a great server (Sarah)  I was able to eat a gluten free burger. The bun was sweeter than a regular burger bun, but it added to the flavor and was portioned well.  The food was great from the salad to dessert.  Also the server's was timed right and we didn't feel rushed, but had the right amount of attention."
A M.,"San Diego, CA",15,4,14,5.0,11/11/2015,"My fiance and I went out on a date to celebrate Veterans Day at BJ's Restaurant and we had a wonderful experience.  Our server, Evelyn was amazing.  Her service on top of the new burgers was great, her persona was inviting and sweet.   She even gave my fiance a free mini pizookie so she could try one cos my lady couldn't decide on dessert.  Evelyn was happy to give that and my entree for free since I myself am a veteran. Our wonderful server, the food and surprise dessert on the house made our night.  I would recommend this BJ's restaurant to my family and friends."
Teddy B.,"Spring Valley, CA",0,4,,3.0,4/6/2017,"nice waitress, the food took a little long but came out hot and super tasty!! always love bj's! ROUND TWO!!! came back a second time and it was good.. service was a little slow but food still bomb!"
Sylvia H.,"El Cajon, CA",6,26,1,5.0,8/26/2016,Oh my it was so good plus Kristyn my server was the best. She gave me the best service and help me order the best sandwich grill ham and cheese
Danielle B.,"Bonita, CA",3,12,10,5.0,3/11/2017,"My husband and I decided to take our kids here for dinner. We usually go to the BJ's in Mission Valley because it isn't that busy but the Grossmont location is much closer to home. We called ahead to put our name on the list. When we arrived, we waited about 5 minutes and our name was called. From the moment we sat down, our server Nathan was AMAZING. He was so attentive, polite, caring, and genuine. He checked in on us to make sure we were doing well and that my kids had everything that they needed. He even asked if we wanted our kids food right away or if we wanted it made shortly before our meals so their meals had time to cool down before coming to the table. He was so sweet, funny, sincere, and all around an awesome server. These days, in all fields of work, people lack customer service skills, but not Nathan. People are too quick to complain when they receive bad service, but don't take the time to give praise when they receive great service. I spoke to Nathan's manager and wanted to write this review to applaud him for his service, attitude, and work ethic. We will definitely go back to this BJ's location. Thank you so much for making our last minute outing a great one!"
Lisa W.,"San Diego, CA",2922,1852,5900,3.0,1/7/2013,"Big chain restaurant like the cheesecake factory or what not. I came here for lunch, they have happy hour menu for the brews and some appetizers.  I love all their brewhouse beers and their selection of alcohol. I also shared a cheeseburger pizza deep dish. Weird that those are 2 of America's favorites: cheeseburger and pizza combined into one. It was pretty good, I thought they kind of cheap out on the beef/meat. There wasn't too much and it was like flakes of it, not big big clumps or anything. Their salad wraps are always a good choice as well.  BJ's is a good chain restaurant. Decent service, great bar area, good selection of beers, and all types of different dishes to choose from. And they have the pazooki, I looooove their pazooki. Its the best ""cookie"" dessert I had."
Michael J.,"Lakeside, CA",30,195,2,2.0,7/31/2016,"The food was very good as always. We had a large party and so we knew service might be a little slow, but wrong service was not expected.  Undelivered apps, wrong orders, and not a sorry in the whole thing. Just plain indifference was what we got."
Mari H.,"El Cajon, CA",193,5,,5.0,8/16/2016,"This was not my first time at BJ's, but this was the first time that we had an incredible waiter. Toby was very attentive to what we needed and always served us with a smile. He brought water to our table without us even asking and made sure that everything was up to par. We had a group of seven for my moms birthday and since we were such a large group he was kind enough to bring us two mini birthday pizookies because he probably knew one would not be enough. At the end when we were ready to leave he made sure we were satisfied with everything and of course we were. When we were leaving he even shook all of our hands with gratitude and to me that just shows that he was actually happy to be our waiter. This is one of the best experiences I have had at this BJ's and I hope Toby gets noticed for his hard work! Thank you!"
Jasmine K.,"La Mesa, CA",91,4,,5.0,8/25/2016,I sat at the bar and my bar tender / server was amazing so kind she kept herself busy but still payed so much attention to the people in her section she is such a sweetheart thank you Michelle !
Thuy N.,"La Mesa, CA",117,119,191,4.0,9/19/2015,"At first I loved BJ's for their pizookies! However, it's become a very fond tradition for my siblings and I. This is the one place that we always agree on whenever we crave sweets in the La Mesa area. We typically get the white chocolate macadamia nut cookie, and the three of us can actually share one order. I know, that sounds blasphemous considering how DELICIOUS they are ...but we're trying to lose 5 pounds.... See what I did there? :) #MeanGirls My little brother and sister share a love for their new burgers. The extra dose of guacamole won them over. Personally, I've grown to really love the wings here. They are crunchy to the right amount, and I love the seasoning here. They have new flavors for the dry wings, and they ALL tastes great. Everyone needs to check 'em out!!  I docked one star because the service at this restaurant is never consistent. We've had some of the crappiest waiters, and some of the best as well. I typically let it slide because one offsets the other. Regardless, I enjoy this place, so I'll be coming back often with my favorites! FYI: Between the 3 of us, the check usually comes out to $45-$60 total!"
John R.,"San Diego, CA",0,27,,5.0,7/17/2016,"Since I come to this BJ's quite often, I rarely think of writing a review.  This was an exceptional visit and deserves a 5 star review primarily because of our server, Sandra.  Same old sliders that I always get, same old flat bread pizza that my wife always gets, but the difference in service is the reason I'm writing.  Night and day difference from our previous visit where Mr. Lackadaisical was our server.  Wish I had gotten his name, but I remember the face.  He took so long for everything, I finally had to ask the hostess if she could find our check.  Who do you suppose was chatting up with the hostess, Mr. Lackadaisical.  He was a little embarrassed but not much.  If he ever shows up at my table again, I'm either moving or leaving. As for Sandra, she took care of business in the nicest and most efficient way.  She noticed my military ID when I opened my wallet to get my member code.  I never even knew they give a 10% discount to military.  No delays, no hassles, no BS.  I rarely think of asking for a particular server, but will always try to get Sandra from now on.  I hope the manager is checking these reviews.  Sandra deserves a bonus."
Wendy R.,"El Cajon, San Diego, CA",0,8,,1.0,4/5/2016,"We used to come here ALL the time and we always brought large groups, but NEVER AGAIN! I can overlook bad service if the food is amazing. But when it takes more than 30 minutes to get your drinks, and then the manager doesn't even come out to apologize for it taking almost an hour for our food to come out, and then the food you FINALLY do end up getting is worse than a fast food restaurant, then one star is what you get."
Marty H.,"San Diego, CA",40,20,3,1.0,7/28/2015,"I would have posted this sooner, however when I origonally posted this on my moble, for some reason it went to the wrong bussiness.  This was back on March 9th, 2015.   So we showed up at the La Mesa  BJ's for dinner at 6pm to celebrate  a birthday the wait wasn't too long we had a party of 10 we sat down the server took our order and was supposed to bring us our drinks silverware and appetizers and then she went on a dinner break without bringing us anything the second server wasn't really any better and we had to remind him about our silverware appetizers and drinks, and the dinner order was messed up. If it wasn't for the busboys the entire dining experience would have been ruined, will not return to this BJ location."
