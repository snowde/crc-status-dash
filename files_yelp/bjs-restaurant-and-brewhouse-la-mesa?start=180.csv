Keirsten H.,"Poway, CA",65,2,2,4.0,7/13/2016,Went in yesterday after wedding dress shopping  with my mom our server was so welcoming and very sweet! First time for my mom and i and we were a little worried about how the food was going to be after seeing the book of the menu but she loved every bite !!! We ordered a build your own pizza and a Santa fe salad .. I don't think I can come in here and not order that salad it is delicious !!!! And to finish our meal we had to get a pazooki so we had to do the trio and finished every bite !! Thank you for the good service and delicious food we will be back !!!!
Jack L.,"San Diego, CA",539,275,48,5.0,5/27/2015,"Dude, for real? Where do I start. My God... I mean for real,  are they for realy?? I had to sit myself down at the bar when I walked in. I mean... Gawd. Doesn't anyone ever just guide you  anymore to the bar???? I mean it isn't like we are in  Boise, Idaho or Amarillo, Texas. Can't we have a hostess that just grabs our hand and walks us to the bar ?!?!?!?: Is that too much to ask?? Anyways.... Then to have some smug cute as a kitten bartender  come up and have the nerve, THE NERVE, to ask if I'm okay at the bar and if, As IF, I have any questions about their beer selection... God. What?!?!? Does it look like my name is Frank Battistone and that I have clue about BJ's beers?!? Whatever Cassandra, *Btw call me sometime cute bartenders **winks So yeah.... I order a beer. Probably not what ""Frank"" would suggest *winks But yeah i got my beer and it was good.  I guess I shouldn't complain.  I had a seat at the bar.  I had a beer. It wasn't obtrusive. I didn't have the heat of the sun bearing down on me, As I sat enjoying my pizza, I thought. What would you do if a Tyrannosaurus Rex ripped of the top of the roof and grabbed you and your pizza? I thought about this while drinking my raptor red which i have been told is not a raptor red.  I decided I would pull out my machete and cut off his little useless arms to use as toothpicks when i finished my pizza."
Andres L.,"La Mesa, CA",0,8,1,1.0,8/17/2015,If you value your safety don't eat here!!!!! The biggest problem came when they brought out desert with a melting bowl of ice cream on the side. We were told the ice cream machine was broken and that the dishwasher was also broken so they were running out of dishes. As they had no intention of taking the item off our receipt we ate it.  This morning both of us woke up with severe stomach pains and after going to the doctor found out we had food poisoning from dinner last night because that was the only thing out of norm we ate.  We've now missed an entire day of work hopefully it will go away in a day but this is the worst food poisoning I've ever had even from eating at hole in the walls around the country.
Amanda E.,"Concord, CA",0,31,25,2.0,4/26/2016,Why stay open late if you're just going to be shoving customers out of the bar as fast as possible? Barely ordered and they're already cleaning the entire bar as we and several other couples are still seated at the bar waiting to be served. Waitress/bartender asked us if we wanted another round of beers when we weren't even halfway done with our first round. Jeez she just wants us out of here so she can go home! Food is satisfactory.
Alyce C.,"Pasadena, Los Angeles, CA",39,3,,2.0,6/29/2016,We go here probably once every two months and it has never failed to make us wait over 40 minutes for our food. Why is that?????
Steven D.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,2,,5.0,5/5/2016,"Never thought I would write a review but this experience was great. Went to bjs late and was greeted by our server. Was the best server I have ever had. The most genuine, whole hearted, all around good guy. His name was Fredrick. Went through all the menu changes and recommended things that were good. Was very accommodating and very attentive the whole night. He was a really nice and caring person and after the crazy night we had before we came in, it was so nice to have such a great person taking care of us. Thank you Fredrick. I hope you read this cause it meant a lot to have you tonight. If you go to this bjs location make sure to ask for Fredrick."
Benjamin C.,"San Diego, CA",2,1,1,2.0,11/13/2015,"I used to be a regular customer of BJ's, moreso while living in Los Angeles. Based on a few experiences at this location years ago, likely would have rated ~4 stars for price, food quality, customer service, and overall value. Unfortunately, this was a BJ's experience unlike any other I've had. Arrived at ~8:10pm this last Monday night, and was promptly seated; It was not a busy Monday night. Drink orders went fine and delivered in reasonable time. Entrees were ordered by ~8:20pm. A little after 9pm, began to be concerned regarding where the food was, especially considered the restaurant was largely vacant. Food arrived a couple minutes after complaining. My friend and I had both ordered the Mahi Mahi taco plate, and substituted one of the two fish tacos with a shrimp taco. Seconds after my friend had bit into her fish taco, she exclaimed ""this fish as BAD!"" Having worked in a high-end seafood restaurant for years, I was unwilling to take her word and took a bite of my own fish taco. Yep, it was bad alright. RANCID, would be the correct term for this spoiled, not to mention cold, fish. This review would be a solid 1 star had it not been for BJ's management offering to purchase a replacement meal. Because if was 9:20pm at this point, I declined and received a gift card for future use. Based on that I debated between giving 2 or 3 stars, but as Yelp describes 2 as ""Meh. I've experienced better"" and 3 as ""A-OK"", feel that 2 is more appropriate."
Christine B.,"La Habra, CA",1,7,,3.0,8/5/2016,The only reason I am even giving them 3 stars is because the food is AMAZING here. Other than that the service is terrible. I've come here twice in a few months and it's always the same thing. They seat you and then it takes the waiter forever to come assist you or even ask for a drink.  Tonight we got our starter salad and had no utensils to eat with it. I asked the server for some place settings. The one I got had a terribly bent prong on the fork. I waited forever for a waiter to walk by to ask for a new one. He agreed he would. I never got the fork. He came by 10 min later to ask how we were doing. I reminded him that I still needed the fork and he made some joke about forgetting.  Our food was great but we had to ask every time to get our drinks refilled. I also had to ask three separate times to get a side of dressing. Management really needs to take a look at who they are hiring or how they are training because all the servers I have encountered here are horrible and incompetent.
Mercy B.,"San Diego, CA",595,415,83,4.0,4/14/2015,"I used to go here a few years ago when I first moved to SD and was in La Mesa for a few months before moving to OB. I loved their Parmesan Chicken back then and I had to make sure they still had it before I walked in. I had a dr's appt in the area and knew I was going to come in here for lunch while out this way. The server said it's still their most popular dish and customers would revolt if they ever took it off the menu! Two nice size pieces of deboned chicken breast, lightly breaded, seasoned very well with shaved Parmesan and a wonderful lemony buttery sauce on it. Still delish. I am a saucy girl, so I asked for a little extra sauce on the side to dip my broccoli and mashed potatoes in. Broccoli cooked perfectly and comes pretty plain, so the sauce was a good dipper. Their potatoes though.....so dense and not a lot of flavor. I do remember them like this and I wonder why they can't make a lighter version, would be SO much more appealing. I think next time I might just ask for fries or a baked potato if they have it. Lost a star for that.  Service was spot on, but I went at a very late lunch hour, so they weren't busy at all.  It's gone up a couple of bucks since I've been there, but at least they didn't change the recipe!"
Ken L.,"Atherton, CA",14,3,,1.0,8/20/2015,Almost left after being seated. This restaurant is extremely unclean. The smell was a definite indication that this place needs a deep cleaning. Looking down the partition wall next to the table it was clearly ridden with greasy handprints and head prints.  The food was ok but it was hard to enjoy wondering if the kitchen was worse than the Dining area. The tile floor to the kitchen entry was extremely dirty as well.  I've been to other of their restaurants and they are great. This one needs help.  I would advise eating elsewhere.
Kathleen W.,"San Diego, CA",8,99,103,3.0,6/8/2016,"Excellent food!  We bought tons of it and had literally just finished eating when the manager came over and kicked us out since it was so crowded, even though it was only a Wednesday night."
Andrew F.,"El Cajon, CA",142,4,1,2.0,4/24/2015,"The food was alright. The service was really disappointing. My girlfriend ordered a strawberry lemonade while clearing pointing  at mine, and instead was brought a few slices of lemons. We also asked if we could have two separate checks but she only brought us the one. If she had not been trying to walk away while we were asking her of these simple tasks, maybe she would have got it right! Side note! The railings and dividers next to us were really dusty, like they hadn't been cleaned in days."
Kabeth H.,"Lakeside, CA",89,40,18,5.0,7/7/2016,"Love this place. Jacob and Fredrick are the best servers we have ever had! the many times we have been here they by far have stood out going above and beyond to make us feel welcome. the food was great and not to mention the great pizookiesssssss! although its sad the peanut butter smores is gone, salted caramel and monkey bread are amazing! this place is great for a late night dinner"
Carolyn C.,"El Cajon, CA",26,18,1,2.0,7/6/2016,Been  here a few times and it always the same story... too many tables not enough waiters or cooks. Tonight we waited 45 minute for a salad and a pizza.  The salad itself was comparable to a jack and the box salad and left me wanting much more. Pizza was ok but not worth the 45 minute wait. Dissatisfied and disappointed.
Rayleen A.,"National City, CA",0,2,,3.0,1/22/2017,My order didn't get put through because an item on the menu was no longer available! So when I went in to go pick up my order at the time it said ready I was told I had to wait an additional 25 mins because of the fact my order didn't get put through smh never again going to order take out from this location
Julius N.,"San Diego, CA",20,55,9,5.0,6/20/2015,"Love this place. Great variety, delicious beer and a fun environment. Be sure to order the Avacado egg rolls and a BJs classic pizza. Don't forget to leave room for dessert- nothing like a gigantic warm cookie with a couple scoops of cold vanilla ice cream."
Atena C.,"Santee, CA",50,12,,5.0,7/18/2016,"I love this place! I come here so often with my friend and every time we fall more in love. The service is always very good here too and I value that a lot in a restaurant. The only minor criticism I have is that sometimes the service can be a little slow, but that's not often and the food makes up for it. I haven't tried anything I don't like yet."
Olga A.,"El Cajon, CA",24,2,,5.0,7/30/2016,Had a good experience are waiter was on point with are drink and are food was amazing !!!!
Maura H.,"El Cajon, CA",77,1,,5.0,7/17/2016,The Chicken Tortilla Soup brings us back to BJ's all the time.  Today like always it was delicious.  The team working tonight was awesome.  It was a busy night for them and they provide excellent and fast service from being seated and bringing our food out. Thank you BJ's for a great experience.
Paul B.,"Los Angeles, CA",571,296,1441,4.0,2/6/2015,"BJ's has been around a while, and haven't stepped inside for years.  And I'm glad I did. And maybe it's time you should, too. I always like a good flight of beers. And these beers take flight. Tall, generous taster glasses, not skimpy wimpies.   I always like a good HH w/ attractive prices. All was good here.  The apps and entrees are consistent gourmet quality, and attention paid to detail all around. Service superb with a friendly & patient approach. She took time to help this rookie pick just the right pizza.  You can tell that mgmt is serious about creating an xlnt experience for the customer. It was the best overall restaurant experience I've had in a long time. HH is 3-7pm. Come get happy."
