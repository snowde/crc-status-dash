Carlos R.,"El Cajon, CA",17,4,,1.0,3/19/2016,Not my favorite place anymore. My cup is being empty for more than 30 min. It took them 40 min to get my appetizers. An hour had passed and no drink or food.
Angela B.,"La Mesa, CA",0,5,,2.0,2/7/2015,"Service was really bad last night. Our waiter had no personality and after he took our order he did not come over once to refill our drinks or ask how we were. Another server comes by and tells us our waiter left for the night. He did not even have the decency to tell us himself. We told our new server how the waiter did not come around to us once that night and she apologized but acted like she could care less. If you are not a people person, then think about getting a job in a different industry maybe.  The food was just ok and the lite Cosmo drinks we ordered were not good. No flavor at all. Too bad because I used to really like this place and it's close to where I live but after last nights bad experience I have second thoughts about ever returning."
M S.,"San Diego, CA",0,6,,5.0,2/7/2016,"I met a friend here and we had a glass of wine, appetizer, and a dessert.  It was very good.  I would go back there definitely. Michele"
Vanessa B.,"San Diego, CA",228,211,123,4.0,1/15/2015,"Went here with my boyfriend last night at evening happy hour 10pm til. Our server was Ashley & we had the BOGO coupon. He had the BYO pizza (hand tossed) individual size was 8.75 & I had the California burger w/ thin cut fries (10.75) & a caesar salad. (3.25) It was a busy night & Ashley did amazingly. The wait was a little long, but it was understandable. She was still smiling throughout the night. Not everyone can understand it's hard to keep a smile on your face when people don't ""believe"" how busy you are (Serve for a night & then talk). Burger was amazing (Had to get a side of red onions w/it, YUM!) I didn't try my boyfriend's pizza. & the caesar salad isn't their specialty, I get it, but I wish they didn't charge 3.25 for a small side of it."
Judy C.,"San Diego, CA",0,5,,1.0,1/19/2016,"I will never go back to BJ's.  This was the 3rd time I have eaten there.  We were at the restaurant at 4:30 and the bar was way to noisy so we decided to sit outside.   There was no one eating outside since it was a little cold.  The waitress was very friendly and talkative.  I ordered a side salad and a piece of salmon.  The side salad was a joke.  It took up 1/2 of a small plate, and veggies were minimal.  I had to move some of the lettuce just to find the two small chopped tomatoes, and two tiny tiny pieces of cucumber.   The food runner kindly brought me a bit more veggies.   They should have been embarrassed to call it a side salad.    After 4 or so bites the salad was finished (super small serving)."
Jerod K.,"El Cajon, CA",0,9,,4.0,10/11/2016,The food is good but the beer is better.. They also mix some of the beers together and they are really good.if you make it by try the jermiah red mixed with the tatonka.
Kimberly R.,"Jamul, CA",55,1,,1.0,5/11/2016,"Went to the restaurant for my sisters birthday. Of course our party was a little big but the girl at the front let me know that it would be a 30 min wait, no problem because we were still waiting on a few people. She gave me the buzzer to let me know when are table to be ready. Almost an hour later and we were still not seated....i went up to the counter and asked how much longer for my party to wait, turns out they had forgotten about my party...my party of about 10 people. Horrible. We all went to Casa De Pico instead, they seated us faster."
Rami H.,"El Cajon, CA",78,134,362,4.0,3/7/2015,"Nice restaurant, good service, free parking, TVs, food taste very good. busy busy busy."
Ryan M.,"Yucaipa, CA",3,108,44,3.0,9/3/2016,Typical chain service. Server gave my pizza to another guest.  After 15 minutes of watching the rest of out table eat she recognized the mistake and didn't so much as apologize?  She offered to make another pizza which takes 15 minutes to prepare and informed me to take it home with me to eat later. But what about now?  I'm hungry now!  She didn't credit our bill or offer a free desert. I would offer less stars but the pazookie was descent.
Jasmine L.,"San Diego, CA",141,3,,3.0,1/12/2016,"If I could rate this place 3.5 stars I would, but unfortunately Yelp doesn't allow that. We came here 11/10 kind of spontaneously, the parking wasn't terrible. We got there and the host was very nice, we were seated immediately at a booth. 5 minutes later we were greeted by a nice server, we decided to order nachos. They're no longer on the menu but they still make them, the chips were kind of burnt and the cheese was sparse but overall the nachos were decent. My boyfriend and I both ordered burgers, I wanted mine cooked Medium and he wanted Medium Rare, but when we got the burgers they were both well done. Kind of annoying but the burgers were still tasty so it was alright. The server was pretty attentive and the prices are decent for what you're getting. Probably will be coming back here sometime in the future."
Erica G C.,"San Diego, CA",1,6,4,5.0,3/25/2016,Jared J was the best bartender I've ever had at BJs! I had table service for dinner with my girls and decided to end my night at the bar. I love the beer samplers and Jared went to town recommending me beer mixers and cider mixers. I will definitely come back to see him!
Ray C.,"San Diego, CA",6,31,17,5.0,2/21/2015,"Amazing service from Matt !!! At the bar section. Employee of the year material . Food was great as well . Ordered clam chowder , couple beers and calamari . Best visit we had here At bj .thank you matt !!!"
Guillermo S.,"Lemon Grove, CA",2,15,28,5.0,7/5/2015,Great food and good customer service!!! Had the fetucini alfredo with the shrimp... The beers are good tatonka stout it hoppy but very good and unique in taste the summer ale is pretty good as well. They get pretty busy on weekends so call ahead and ask for wait time. Staff really friendly and easy going
Nick B.,"El Cajon, CA",81,35,18,4.0,11/9/2014,"We've been coming here for years, but I've never posted a review! I just wanted to note that the service was excellent. Dominique was very nice, attentive, and ran out to the parking lot to catch us after we left our credit card on the table. The beer and food were tasty, too. With all the breweries in San Diego, I admit I sometimes forget about BJ's. Their beers are all solid examples of the styles."
Alastra A.,"San Diego, CA",153,158,40,1.0,11/2/2014,Can the service get any worse? I'm sitting here writing this after it took someone about 15 minutes to come greet me. Waiting for my coke still it's been about 10 minutes. Service gets worse and worse Everytime I come here... Never coming back here again. Shame on management. Take care of this issue there is obviously all these bad yelp reviews for a reason
Stephanie A.,"Palm Desert, CA",160,47,7,5.0,9/29/2015,The Brussels sprouts with the sriracha cream sauce are really good and different. Taste like homemade potato chips!
Khalifa A.,"La Mesa, CA",0,8,6,1.0,2/23/2016,Most of the time I go to Bjs and wait in curbside. The last time i have ordered sliders with extra cheddar and onion and 2 jambalaya no sausage  The sliders  has no onions and the cheese looks sad and covered less than quarter of the slider.  The jambalaya it has sausage  when i called they put me on hold for long time. The manager spokes to me saying that the sausage its 100% chicken it's not pork. This is not the issue its said no sausage. I feel bad I didn't take a photos of the food.
Amandor S.,"Lakeside, CA",3,17,2,2.0,2/22/2016,"I never go here on my own accord, I only go because I know people who like to go to here which I have to ponder, why? There are so many better breweries to go to!! I went here the other day and waited an hour and a half for cold food. I don't understand. I ordered a burger and fries, and my boyfriend ordered a pizza. Both cold. We didn't get dessert because I didn't feel like waiting around another 30min but hahaha we ended up waiting that while waiting for the check. Oi. I've had their pizzookie before and it's just an undercooked cookie, why do people like it? Go to Panera across the parking lot and get a good pastry! I wish people would stop wanting to go to here T_T"
Sophia Y.,"San Mateo, CA",816,1408,2385,4.0,3/26/2013,"PIZOOKIE PARTY!!! I don't know how we ended up with getting that, for I think we actually came for something else. Good choice on our part though. Four flavors of warm cookie topped with scoopfuls of ice cream on top. We got red velvet, raspberry white chocolate, cookies in cream and regular chocolate chip. It was delicious the first few bites. The combination of warm cookie and cold ice cream was SO good. Who would of thought hot and cold ever go together? The sugar eventually gets to you though as it is a humongous dessert. The red velvet was good but was definitely the sweetest. The raspberry white chocolate was good. We only got a hint of raspberry but the white chocolate definitely complimented it. The cookies and cream kinda tasted like a flat brownie. It's good if you like flat brownies. And surprisingly, the normal classic chocolate chip was my favorites. The cookie had a half baked taste but who doesn't like cookie dough and cookies? And I loved the warmness of a fresh out of the oven cookie. We had to wait a little longer because they actually burnt our first one. They came out and let us know that it was going to be a little while longer because they wanted serve us a good one. Fortunately, we didn't mind the wait and found it funny that they burnt our cookie. Like the description says, it's good for a party of 5 or more. That probably holds true as our party of 4 could not finish ours.  Overall, a good dessert! I think we were just in over heads by ordering so much of it."
Kim P.,"Pasadena, CA",384,1149,327,4.0,11/21/2013,Not fancy. Nothing special. Outside the movie theater.  What is nice about this place is that it serves good beers and has a great and friendly wait staff. Open late-ish so you can hang out and drink after a movie.
