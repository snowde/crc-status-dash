Kelly P.,"San Diego, CA",106,52,15,1.0,8/5/2014,"I dined here tonight after hiking cowles mtn. We were seated quickly and our drink orders were taken by our waiter, Matt, quite promptly. Unfortunately,  things started going downhill. Our beer and appetizer, the avocado rolls, we're delightful. My partner ordered a burger and i wanted the sirloin. We both requested them medium. When they came, his was well done and mine was medium well. Back in April this happened to my partner who ordered his steak medium and got a well done one. In April we complained to the waiter who brought the manager out and he made things right by getting him another steak. Since the issue was resolved, I did not yelp about it. This situation was handled differently. I'm not sure if it was due to how many tables Matt needed to tend to, or the lack of communication between wait staff, and management. When I told Matt about my displeasure with the food, he said he would have the manager come see us. My partner finished his meal and still no manager. So I sipped on my water and Matt tells us that the manager is in the back cooking (hmmm, could he be the one who cooked my steak?). I tell him it's okay and that we would just like the check. He ask if we want to wait because ""it will only take a few minutes"". I informed him that we may wait but we would still like the check.  The real kicker was when he turned to my partner(who is male) and tells him explicitly that ""I'll get the check for YOU"". Not you guys, just my partner, I guess the assumption is since he is male, he must be paying. It really turned me off, as it was me asking for the check the whole time, and also me who planned on paying for the food his manager overcooked, and also for the tip that I left him. At that point, I really wanted to wait for the manager, but a few minutes after we had paid and we're still not seen by the manager, it was decided we'd better just leave.  Long story short, if you want your steak/burger medium, order rare. And avoid this place unless you are okay with customer service inconsistencies. If you read my other reviews, I gloat about many establishments that I am pleased with,  but tonight BJ's wasn't one of them. I wouldn't have written this review if the manager had addressed my concerns while i was there."
Monica M.,"Lakeside, CA",0,2,,3.0,9/23/2016,Menu is a bit high priced but enjoy the food and service.  I usually spend $100 on a dinner for 2 so we don't go as often as we like.
Eric J.,"San Diego, CA",4,8,1,5.0,2/14/2016,"This place is amazing, I love the Santa Fe spring rolls. The atmosphere is great and the staff is really nice and friendly. BJ's is great place with great food."
Sabrina O.,"La Mesa, CA",2,15,8,4.0,5/30/2015,"I have been here a few times , this time around I ordered the southern fried chicken, it was absolutely delicious. The chicken was juicy and the mash potatoes and corn were very good. I really love their peach ice tea it is one of the most flavorful iced teas out there. The service was good, seating was fast for a Friday night. I didn't have any beer this time but their beer is really good. Gets one less star because the bathroom in this place is really bad, 3 stalls for such a huge place, I wish their bathroom would be bigger."
Jackson H.,"Santee, CA",14,36,,4.0,7/29/2015,"My mother came to town and wanted to try a new place, but not a real expensive one as she was going to take the whole family out, 9 people all together. My son suggested this place.  I tried to get reservations at the Mission Valley & La Jolla ones but they wouldn't take them on a Saturday.  But this one did.  They were very nice to us.  Everyone had a great time & really enjoyed the food."
Toni C.,"San Diego, CA",0,6,2,5.0,10/31/2015,"Don't go there starving like I did lol!!I ordered extra items because their menus have the best pictures. I will be back.  Great environment, got to watch the Laker game while eating my delicious deep dish pizza too..Yum"
Will M.,"La Mesa, CA",0,89,,3.0,1/21/2017,"Nothing special, but not bad if you're just looking for a place to eat & can't think of anywhere better to go.  A typical corporate mall parking lot restaurant w/ a kind of (in their better days) TGI Friday's feel.  A little pricey for not being great.  First, the appetizers... they did have really good potato skins... nice & crispy & a good amount, but the wings weren't very good.  We forgot to order them naked & the sauce was too sweet.  For a salad, we ordered the Golden Beet & Arugula salad... my wife enjoyed it, but I didn't much care for it (it wasn't bad, but just very ordinary).  The deep dish pizza was a real disappointment.  Deep dish is deep dish for a reason... good dense pizza.  Although it was thick, the texture was light like a Pillsbury can of biscuits you cook at home... that doesn't make for a good pizza crust for any type of pizza, much less deep dish.  The cheese, sauce & toppings were bland.  Again, the pizza didn't taste bad, but certainly not good either.  The Rib-Eye steak was descent.  Could have been a little hotter, but it was a good size & cooked the way the way I like... a little more medium than rare & little more rare then medium.  The beers were descent, but nothing to write home about... especially in a city like San Diego with over 600 breweries.  Last, the service... nothing to complain about there.  Great service!"
Cassidie P.,"San Diego, CA",159,15,,3.0,8/16/2015,"We come to bjs a lot and always ask to be seated in Stephens section! He makes sure we have everything we need and even took the time to ask my boyfriend and I our names! I mean what server really cares? Lol my boyfriend and I are both servers as well and if your looking for a nice server who doesn't seem to hate his job ask for him!  Only thing I hate about this bjs is the hostesses will let you stand there without even saying hello until they're done having their conversation about makeup and boys. I've had this problem three times here now, all different girls. Don't you have to be 21 to work there? I was a hostess in different restaurants for years and it's not hard to pause and greet customers when they walk in! I mean you have one job come on... Other than that food is amazing! And I like seeing a manager around checking in with tables! It's nice knowing they care about the dining experience! I want to give Stephen 5 stars! But those hostesses just make me want to walk out"
Hopey B.,"San Diego, CA",108,26,2,1.0,11/24/2015,"Why? Whyyyyyyyy does my husband choose this place? Total of times at BJ's over a span of 15 years=4. Service is slow (no matter what location), they get orders wrong, and you have to flag them down for EVERY.THING. It bugs me even more that they respond with a smile. I'm here right now and they forgot the cheese on my kid's burger. It took almost 10 mins. for it to come back out. No asking if we needed anything else, but they sure are fast to bring the check. Holy!!! Wait a minute... She just came by to pick up the check. And we didn't even need to flag her down. Ok.... I see how it is.... This place sucks. I hope this is the last time we ever eat here. -5 stars!!!!"
Jeremy R.,"San Diego, CA",5,9,6,1.0,4/5/2016,"Where do I begin?  I have been been a patron at BJ'S in La Mesa for at least the last 12 years.  It has been the only late night happy hour spot in the area, and I have gladly rolled with the ups and downs of the quality of bar food.  However, I have noticed in the last year a steep decline in not only food quality, but I don't even recognize any of the servers anymore.  (not a good sign, I go here a lot)   Tonight was the last straw for me.  I brought a group of 10 on a night that was clearly slow- the majority of the tables were empty and servers were hanging out up front.  It took 35 minutes to have our drinks delivered, and almost an hour to get appetizers!  2 of my friends left without their orders because of the time, and when we recieved our food it was terrible. This was NOT a busy night, and we never received even the slightest apology from the server or any managers.  I will NEVER eat at BJ'S in La Mesa again."
Joe O.,"Spring Valley, CA",728,82,36,5.0,7/4/2015,Gluten Free Pizza.  Booyah!!!  It's really good too. The best gf pizza I've had and my gluten eating peeps like it a lot too. It's got great atmosphere and the other dishes were great too.
Courtney L.,"Pine Valley, CA",1,5,,1.0,7/26/2015,"We just took our son for his birthday dinner and for $100 my husband and I got nothing. We ordered the rib eye to split, medium rare and it came out rare. They put it back on the grill and nothing. Out of a 21 ounce piece of meat only 4 ounces was eatable. We ordered a pizoockie and it was one small layer of uncooked cookie. We were looking forward to a good dinner, the people we were with were great but  the food was nasty!"
Mary K.,"El Cajon, San Diego, CA",540,703,1410,5.0,9/7/2014,"My favorite thing from here is the parmesan crusted chicken. HEAVEN!! 2 pounded chicken breasts crusted with breadcrumbs and Parmesan with sautéed broccoli and a bed of mashed potatoes. I treat myself to this sometimes. Absolutely delicious. Service is usually good, sometimes alright. But that chicken will have me coming back no matter what!"
Madison B.,"La Mesa, CA",8,21,2,4.0,11/6/2015,"My boyfriend and I come here pretty often. Good food and the waitress we had tonight, Brooke, was the best we've had here! She's awesome and totally on top of it despite the rush hour."
Jenn P.,"El Cajon, CA",0,11,,5.0,5/11/2016,Sarah wqs our waitress and omg she was so amazing. The best server i had in a long time. Hold on to thos gem.
Gerardo G.,"La Mesa, CA",62,43,3,3.0,6/15/2015,"I really like this restaurant, I often find good food, good customer service, and an adequate price tag when the check arrives. The parking lot is always a nightmare, but that could not be the fault of the business, since they are not the only store around.  Last Sunday we went to BJ's for lunch, and we left not really enchanted by our meal experience. The dilemma is that my food was fantastic (I ordered the awesome Santa Fe salad), but my wife's quinoa bowl was puzzling. The word ""meh!"" Comes in mind to describe it, as it is lemon juice and salt, the only flavor that involves the dish.  Our service is often great, but our waitress (Gabriela) decided to go AWOL and we did not see her until she brought out check. Maybe the young staff needs to be reconsidered for a more seasoned and well prepared replacement.  I'll go back for the NBA finals, and hopefully get such amazing service, my review changes from 3 to 5 stars."
James R.,"La Jolla, CA",40,40,8,5.0,11/2/2015,Brought my volleyball team in after our victory for BJ's! (inappropriate) Short notice on a Friday night but the crew was able to squeeze us in and take 23 orders with only one flaw (one coach is a picky eater it's really not our servers fault)
Kandee H.,"San Diego, CA",115,146,417,3.0,9/21/2014,"First time stopping by this bj's to watch the game with some friends.  Much smaller than the one at hazard center.  It wasn't that busy however the waiter went to the table next to us and asked them if they needed anything but didn't come to our table...Yes,  a friend of ours was already at the table and ordered some items but he could have acknowledged us.  But after we flagged another staff member down, our service was good.  The food was good, no complaints there and they had an adequate amount of tv's.  The bathrooms have only two stalls so a line can form quickly.  I think I like the hazard center location better,  but not like i wouldn't come back."
Shanel S.,"Sterling Heights, MI",704,827,917,4.0,1/15/2013,"This is our Christmas Eve dinner go-to. It accommodates everyone. Especially now that they have healthier choices like wheat crust, gluten free, etc. Plus it's becoming more bistro-like so we can feel a little fancier.  They also have great service. Our waiter always does a great job with all 15+ of us. Order suggestions: BJ's favorite and artichoke hearts. Gosh I love those things. Plus the artichoke hearts come with a yummy dip that you can use for your pizza since I'm not really a fan of their ranch. My boyfriend also loves their BBQ pizza."
C M.,"San Diego, CA",1,293,169,5.0,12/13/2014,The fried calamari is super good and tender. Yum salads. Yum beer. Pizookies are amazing! Happy hour Monday - Friday 3-7! The vibe in the bar is best. Love this place.
