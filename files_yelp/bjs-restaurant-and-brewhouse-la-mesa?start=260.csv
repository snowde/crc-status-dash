Josh C.,"Santee, CA",114,89,91,5.0,12/26/2012,"This place is in Grossmont Center next to Casa de Pico. It is great for brunch, lunch, or dinner. It does have a covered outdoor eating area if you are looking for that. The pizza is great with thick dough. The sandwiches and burgers are great and are served with wedge cut or crispy fries. The salads are good if you are looking for something healthy. If you are looking for something not so healthy they have a thing called a bazookie. It is a chocolate chip cookie that is cooked fresh and served with ice cream and a chocolate on top. It is the most amazing desert you will ever have.  One tip would be if you are catching a movie at the theater on the other side of the parking lot you can get your order to go and the movie theater will let you take it into your movie with you.  Another tip is if you call BJ's when you are on your way to the restaurant they will put your name on the waiting list.  A final tip is that they have great happy hour specials on pizza, beer, and well drinks. It is great for hanging out with people after a hard day and the bar is open seating all the time so you don't have to worry about wait lists."
Rupert W.,"East Village, San Diego, CA",61,12,1,1.0,11/8/2015,Food is great but hostess' are super bi***y. They come at you with attitude when you ask them a question. Rude rude rude. Terrible.
Tom S.,"San Diego, CA",0,75,,1.0,8/13/2016,"Sat at the bar and ordered a pizza to go. Server brought it and as soon as I picked up the box, a small roach fell off the bottom and ran across my arm. BJ's: My next call is to the health department."
dawn s.,"La Mesa, CA",46,96,40,5.0,7/21/2015,First out waitress Lathena went above customer service buy helping my husband out with understanding you guys beer selection even letting him taste a few of them....she was really cool. The kinda of customer service that brings you back.
Natalie B.,"El Cajon, CA",1,28,11,3.0,4/28/2014,"There are barely any options for vegetarians. The salads suck. And pasta was the only other option. Not all vegetarians want pasta all the time or bread. I think that all bjs needs more selection for us vegetarians:(  Other than that, I love the pazookies!!"
Amber B.,"Santee, CA",10,15,6,5.0,11/17/2015,"I come here about once a week and the service is always good, but yesterday it was excellent. Her name was Caitlin , and she went above and beyond to make us happy.  She was very engaging and deserves a pat on the back from management.  Thank you Caitlin for the great dining experience! Also, the stuffed mushrooms and fried artichokes are to die for!"
Caleb C.,"Santee, San Diego, CA",1,6,1,5.0,7/24/2015,"Wow their new loaded burgers are grreeeaat!!! I had the guacamole and bacon one and loved every bite of it. Best of all my lovely server Hannah was awesome! Very prompt at taking my order, my dirty plates were gone, my drinks kept coming up.. Great way to end a long work day! Will definitely come back!!"
Tanya O.,"El Cajon, CA",2,22,6,2.0,12/17/2015,I'm only giving 2stars because of the service. The food was good when it finally arrived (our server forgot to put it in). Our meal time was over 2 hours because of the wait. I will say that the manager discounted our bill and was apologetic but our server never even acknowledged the mistake. A very long disappointing dinner.
Julie M.,"Santee, CA",6,3,,3.0,7/18/2014,"Food was good, the service was something to be desired for a Friday night. Out of a party of 7, my dinner was forgotten, 20 min later it arrived.  Water was not offered and when the check arrived, the waiter did not ask if we wanted dessert.   Overall, food good, service could be better. Was hoping to have my plate free due to having to wait 20min after the rest of the party was nearly finished with their meal."
Joseph L.,"Spring Valley, CA",0,15,35,5.0,11/7/2015,"dig the beer , my favorite is dark side of the moon , also love the pumpkin ale with fireball whiskey .damn ! the food is just as good and the vibes when i'm with my wife , what can i say .damn !"
Diamond K.,"La Mesa, CA",8,48,20,4.0,9/13/2015,"One word! Pizookie! It's a cookie freshly baked in a mini pizza pan topped with ice cream!  This desert is an instant crowd pleaser!  The  warm perfectly baked cookie contrasting with the icy cold ice cream scoop is an explosion of happiness in your mouth! I prefer the macadamia nut Pizookie however, the chocolate chip and double chocolate are spectacular as well.  As for the foods served here everything is good.  The California club sandwich Is one of the better clubs I have tasted. Their calamari is crunchy and perfectly fried. Very tasty though I think the sauces could be more adventurous in flavor. The pizza is always tasty as well. I recommend this place if you want an amazing dessert! It's everything you could want in a cookie and more"
Kyle F.,"El Cajon, CA",11,277,92,1.0,3/2/2014,"I would give this place negative stars if I could. First off I ordered one of their beers. It took about ten minutes to get it and they brought me the wrong beer...I ordered the Abby normal and they brought me a porter. What the heck?  Then, we ordered food. My girlfriend watched as the server brought our food to the table behind us. The table denied ordering it, so instead of asking around they brought it back to the kitchen. It took about twenty minutes to get our appetizer. After that our food was brought out after another long wait. So far nobody has checked on us minus bringing the food. After we get our food, we didnt see the waiter again until we got our check. No refills, no check ups, nothing. My girlfriend had ordered a second drink and the waiter acknowledged it. We had both finished eating and sat around for about ten minutes before he even realized he forgot to bring it out. He then gave me a free (correct) beer.  The lunch costed me $51 and I received the worst dining experience of my life. Their tip fell faster than an anvil from a 30 story building.  I used to be a fan of BJs but I dont know that I'll be back to this location any time soon."
Alex K.,"Moorpark, CA",0,12,,5.0,7/17/2016,"Had BJ'S last night for dinner with Sarah M as our waitress. Her service was exemplary! She was not only quick and attentive, but also gave great suggestions and was very friendly. Make her a manager!"
Brandy B.,"Bonita, CA",0,30,2,1.0,4/11/2014,"Review based on one menu item** We ordered dinner for pickup this past week and I was very disappointed to discover that I 1) ordered the wrong, not deep dish pizza and 2) the pizza that I did get seriously sucked! It reminded me of chuck e cheese pizza. Day old chuck e cheese pizza. And at $16+?!? I don't think so. If they can't do non deep dish pizza well they really shouldn't do it at all. I tossed the leftovers!"
Trish C.,"Lakeside, CA",0,4,2,1.0,6/23/2015,"Food was decent... Crappy service. Shame on waitress Carla for her behavior; shame on manager Ryan for allowing it.  My husband and I went to BJ's at Grossmont for an early dinner last Friday night. It was crowded but we got seated fairly quickly.  On our table was a card advertising happy hour specials. We checked the time, we were within the time frame, so we decided to order drinks off of that menu. To be clear, the happy menu was on our table in the dining area, and there was nothing on the card stating that that menu or those prices were only available in the bar area. It took a while for the waitress, Carla, to actually make an appearance at our table. When we tried to order off the happy hour menu, she said we could only get that menu/those prices at the bar. The difference in prices for the drinks we wanted on the happy hour menu versus the regular menu was about $10. I asked Carla if there was any reason we couldn't order our food through her off the regular menu, but get our drinks ourselves at the bar. She said we could do it, but clearly did not like that idea.  And here's where our experience at BJ's turned bad - After my husband went to get our drinks, Carla, the waitress, pretty much stopped waiting on our table to the point of rudeness.  When my salad arrived, the silverware set at my seat was dirty - I mean the fork was crusty-dirty, it should never have been wrapped up. This was not her fault, of course (unless she rolled the silverware) but it was her job to replace it once it was pointed out to her.  It took me a while to get her attention to the point she would come over to the table. I finally flagged her down and asked her for clean silverware. Not only did she NOT apologize for the dirty silverware, she left me sitting there for several minutes with my salad in front of me and no way to eat it - all while she went to other tables in the section, smiling, chatting with other tables, other customers. Me, not so much. Without slowing down, she finally scooped up the dirty set without stopping, on her way to somewhere/someone else, and several minutes later, dropped ( and I do mean ""drop"") off a new set, again on her way to someone/somewhere else - all without pausing, all without a word. It was obvious at this point that she was punishing us for getting our own drinks.  The food was brought by the expediter. Carla never once checked back at our table. She avoided our gaze, never made eye contact, never stopped to ask or inquire if everything was OK or if we needed anything else. She would avert her eyes when walking past our table. I am not kidding or exaggerating, I wish I were. She was that rude and nasty. Meanwhile, she was smiling and seemingly happily waiting on every other table in her section. The difference in service between our table and the other tables was very noticeable.  At the end of our meal, after we had been sitting there for some time with empty plates in front of us. She finally came up and without looking at me, addressed my husband and asked if we wanted our plates cleared away. And when she brought the bill, she again addressed him, ignoring me, and gave him the bill. I picked up the bill, put my card into the folder and set it down on my side of the table. She picked it up with out a word, and when she returned it for signature, she AGAIN placed it on his side of the table, ignoring me, not making eye contact with me, not speaking to me.  She never thanked us, never said any pleasantries, nothing. IMO, with that attitude, she had no business waiting tables in a sit down restaurant.  Before leaving I stopped and spoke to Ryan, the manager. And, although he apologized for the bad service, and even said that it wasn't a big deal to order off the happy hour menu in the dining room, I felt at the very least we should have been offered something, some kind of compensation, but that didn't happen.  Carla, it was obviously your intention to give us bad service and to negatively impact our meal and our night - and you succeeded, so good for you. Do you feel better now? And shame on manager Ryan for allowing this kind of service in his restaurant. If it happened to us, I'm sure it has happened to other customers as well. Shame on both of you. You're in the service industry, have some pride. I'm not quite sure what number of stars to rate this place, as the food was decent, but the service we received was really awful and rude - how does that translate in stars? I finally decided on one star, because the crappy service had such a negative impact on our food and evening."
Nadine P.,"San Diego, CA",0,14,,1.0,10/30/2014,"We were seated for about 15 minutes before a server came by to take our drink orders. Took another 15 minutes to get our 2 waters. We ordered a small pizza, and a chicken dish. We asked if we could have some silverware, since there was none on the table. About 45 minutes later, our supper arrives, and she takes off, before we can ask her AGAIN for silverware. Luckly, we caught another server as he walked by, and he grabbed some right away. Unfortunately, our pizza was slighly doughy in the center when it arrived to our table. I had asked for light pepperoni on one side of the pizza, which to them must have meant two layers of nothing but pepperoni. Boyfriend's dish was lukewarm and flavorless. What a waste of time and money."
Kimberly C.,"San Diego, CA",185,35,4,1.0,7/3/2015,"The food isn't too bad, but the past few times I've gone here the service has been horrible! Seriously, the manager needs to re-train their servers or something. It shouldn't take 15 minutes for a glass of water to be brought to the table... Today, came in, sat by the bar...tried flagging someone down.. NOTHING.....after 20 minutes of waiting for the server to acknowledge us, we just got up and left."
Fernando C.,"San Diego, CA",1,24,,4.0,10/22/2015,"Dammit Alex,5 stars if your service wasn't so bad,maybe you were set up for it to learn how to handle larger groups. You struggled and it was ok at first but then it got worse,at that time you should've either asked for help or should've just been helped by your co workers.And the attitude doesn't help at all. Love the food here,especially the veggie jalapeño burger !"
Brianna V.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,14,7,5.0,6/20/2016,If I could give the first 10 minutes I spent there I would rate 2 stars. The reason I gave 5 was because of the server that helped me named Cameron. He was amazing!
Vicenzio P.,"San Diego, CA",0,14,1,5.0,1/28/2015,Great place Great Service... our Server Austin is awesome.... we ordered the avocado aggroles and theyre bomb... also cadillacs are tight
