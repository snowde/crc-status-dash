Jessica T.,"La Mesa, CA",2,18,2,4.0,9/18/2014,"This restaurant was very great for exploring new options. It was my first time, and I got the Barbecue Bison Burger. A wonderful alliteration for the stomach. It was a new meat for me, but so delicious with the toppings and the crispy bun. Kind of tastes like a more well done burger. Not as juicy, but more flavor than a well done patty would have.  Looks like they're known for their deep dish pizza and pizooki. I've had neither, but I'll definitely be returning to try more! Good deals for happy hour drinks if you want to try new craft beer.  Only thing is it's a bit loud in there. Talking  with my party last night I started to lose my voice just so they could hear me."
Dani D.,"La Mesa, CA",3,16,,4.0,4/29/2014,"Normally I am not a fan of the service here, but Jacob changed my mind! Funny, courteous, not too intrusive. Just right in my opinion! Had the Mediterranean chicken 'tacos' on the light menu- delicious!  If you go to this location, do yourself a favor and ask to be seated in Jacob's section!"
Angela F.,"San Diego, CA",13,6,1,1.0,11/8/2015,Attempted to have dinner here this evening.  Ordered our drinks and when they came the waitress didn't give us straws.  We asked for straws and she kept walking by us and still no straws.  After asking three different times for a straw my husband asked another waitress and was told she would let our server know.  We decided to leave and came next door to Casa de Pico.  I'm done with BJ's!
Kat J.,"San Diego, CA",1,11,4,1.0,2/16/2015,"This is coming from a person that has to deal with customer service daily & knows how dealing with customers can be: Shout out to the waitress for rolling her eyes at me and getting frustrated because I canceled a dish. Went to the bathroom to cool off and come back to my boyfriend letting me know ""she was sorry for getting frustrated."" I'm pretty sure I deserved that apology personally. I hope you enjoyed your dollar tip. If you don't have customer service find another job. Ps. circling the tip amount isn't helping the situation."
Kimberly F.,"El Cajon, CA",1,11,,2.0,12/10/2015,Went here for lunch yesterday and was very disappointed  The food was disgusting. This is a first for me at this location. Seems to have gone downhill
Gonzalo C.,"Clairemont, San Diego, CA",1,35,8,3.0,8/17/2014,"We decided to try BJs considering we wanted to grab a bite to eat before we watched a movie at the theaters. We got there, was given a table and 10 minutes later and no server had gone to our table to give us any service.  I saw other group of people coming in after us and were given service right away. Something didn't seem right to me after another couple arrived after us and the same thing happen, they were given service before us. It seem as if we were being ignored. So I got up and had to get a waiters attention and let him know the situation.  He right away send me a server name Dominique. She apologized for the inconvenience and told me that she would serve me even tho she wasn't assigned to the area we were in. Dominique was very pleasant and polite and made sure we got good service. She's the only reason I'm giving this place 3 stars or else I'd given them none if I could."
Mike R.,"La Mesa, CA",9,28,8,4.0,10/11/2015,This place is a really good spot for some good food and drinks. You can always get a seat and everyone is super nice that works there. They have great craft beer as well. Great choice for a bite and a drink.
Carolyn B.,"San Diego, CA",0,3,,5.0,6/15/2016,Wonderful service from server Ashley. Asian salad was great. FABULOUS dessert.  We plan to return. ..this is our second visit.
Julia R.,"San Diego, CA",2,66,,5.0,10/4/2015,This is one of my favorite restaurants.  Their rootbeer chicken wings are mmmm but a little bit spicy.  I'm totally hooked on pizookie - the triple chocolate - ghiradelli is the very best!  It was a great experience from start to finish.
Christopher L.,"Westminster, CA",17,362,,3.0,9/20/2012,"The roast beef dip sandwich was excellent. The meat was tender and the caramelized onions balanced out the flavor of the dip. Thin crispy fries were interesting. Overall, a bit pricey but a good meal. Update 5/1/14: Today I tried their new blackened mahi mahi and parmesan crusted scallops dish, which was pretty good. My friend's shrimp scampi pasta, however, was lacking in flavor and the clam chowder reportedly was mediocre."
Bianca S.,"El Cajon, CA",4,20,15,4.0,5/4/2016,"I've been here before for my birthday and had the sweetest waiter that gave me a free pizookie party platter that was around $20 for my birthday and it was also pi day. The food was great then and the food was even greater today. We went to dine at Bj's for my sisters birthday today and made reservations and were quickly seated, although the food always takes long. Our waitress was completely rude and inattentive. My cousin asked for a Coke refill and didn't get her refill until over 20 minutes later after we had to remind the waitress again. The waitress did not even check up on us and we had to ask another waitress to call our waitress over. Even though we had a very rude waitress, my cousins, friends, and I noticed that almost every waiter/waitress working were very sweet and seemed to care about the people they were serving...except for ours. I will definitely be coming back, but hope to get a different waitress!"
Alex H.,"El Cajon, CA",13,13,,3.0,8/23/2015,"I would give it 5 stars had I not received such poor service. The last 3 times I've been in here I've had clueless, unorganized, unprofessional servers. On all 3 occasions my waitress has forgotten our order, screwed up my drink order, and was not attentive."
David M.,"San Diego, CA",0,2,,5.0,5/16/2016,"Sarah M was an awesome server! Her hair is on point; (she's a hair dresser too!) she was friendly, efficient, and ensured a pleasurable dining experience! A plus!"
Greg D.,"Spring Valley, CA",39,24,1,4.0,7/8/2015,"This is a cool place like kind of bro-y but it's big so you don't have to be too close to other people it's in a mall so It's like movie theatre date crowd but that is cool I think they do a decent job of everything and I have not YET had a bad experience. One time I ordered a drink and the waiter was like, oh do you want this? But he didn't mention it was an up charge and I was like, sure. Then when I got the bill it was like triple the price but I still drank it so whatever.  Still go eat here if you never have. The food is not poison and as of a few weeks ago, the staff are not total jerks. I'm sure I'll go back before I'm 40."
Steffanie R.,"Oklahoma City, OK",286,657,204,4.0,4/25/2014,"To be honest I have a love not just ok experiences at BJ's . My sister was moving to Missouri, aka misery.   I know who leaves paradise right?  We are natives and we always end up migrating back. Anyways  I asked them to pick 3 places they wanted to go to, and then since I have celiacs I'd pick from those places.  My husbanded was hoping for Mexican but my mom who gets killer heartburn vetoed all Mexican options. 9 of us were sat quickly at 7pm.  Server was really sweet, sadly I don't remember her name. My only real con it that they don't offer more gluten free options for appetizers! Me and my sister decided to split the new Kale and Brussels sprouts salad and the thyme chicken!  Both blew me away at how good they were.  The thyme chicken did have A LOT of liquid in it, stock I guess, that Maude it messy and as if the kitchen was rushing to plate it.  But besides that it was really good.  We were both impressed at how good both dishes were.  Don't care for their gluten free pizza so I'm glad they have newer and better options.  Ohh and their pizzookie is to die for!!! But I was full and didn't need the added 12000000 calories, ok it's only 1200 but still."
Jessica R.,"Chula Vista, CA",1,13,,4.0,10/17/2015,"Good beer at good price. The pizzas are awsome if you like the Chicago deep dish stile. They have the anchovies pizza!!! Burgers and wings are great as well. A casual place to go have some comfort food, relax with friends and watch sports."
Gwen N.,"San Diego, CA",67,263,263,2.0,8/2/2012,"We came here earlier in the evening. It seemed like there were a lot of people there for happy hour which didn't make a lot of sense to me since the drinks we ordered only consisted of about three sips.  The food seemed like it was trying to be upscale and classy but the ingredients weren't anything special. It was nice that they had some cheaper options (under $5) but the three-to-five bite portions definitely made up for it.  Terrible service, teeny-tiny sippy cup drinks, and fluffed up standard tasting food. Not really worth it."
Paul S.,"Spring Valley, CA",127,414,2830,4.0,6/17/2012,Went here for Father's Day.  Gave a free Father's Day glass to all the fathers.  Nice touch.  My wife is addicted to the nachos.  Wished there was a half order but doesn't stop her from ordering it.  Always a good time.
Danielle S.,"Rolando, San Diego, CA",3,1,,5.0,10/5/2013,"My boyfriend and I came here for dinner after failing to find somewhere to eat at Oktoberfest. I've eaten at this BJ's plenty of times but never had such great service!  George W was our server and was super kind and speedy! He made Greg recommendations and was prompt in getting refills and anything else we needed.  The best thing George did for us was when I ordered the delicious Fettachini Alfredo I asked if it came with garlic bread and he said it did which I replied with, ""Oh good because I reaaaally want garlic bread!"" To my surprise, he brought me EXTRA garlic bread which made my experience even better.  I recommend if you come to this BJ's you ask for George as your server!"
John J.,"San Jose, CA",385,506,737,1.0,1/9/2012,"This is the second 1-star I have ever given, because this place has rubbed me the wrong way. I never ate here because I was precluded from that possibility on my birthday. I was excited to come here for the free pizookie on your birthday as was advertised, and so believing in their credibility, I came to BJ's. While I had no intention to dine in that night, I was very clear to the front of the house that I just wanted to receive the free pizookie. The front said OK, that I could get it at the bar where it was open seating, since the house was packed. So I sat at the bar. The bartender asked me what I'd like, and I said the free pizookie. Then he said that I actually had to dine-in in order to get it. Perturbed, as the ad did not mention any such stipulation, I proceeded to ask what was the cheapest thing on the menu. The barman said it was probably chips and salsa for $7. After that, I decided to leave. Essentially it was $7 for a pizookie that was supposed to be free.  Even though I wasn't going to eat here, I was offended at their lack of credibility. The front and the bar told me contradictory things; the free pizookie was in fact, not free at all! For $7, I can just make a dozen pizookies at home, and I wouldn't have bothered coming here at all."
