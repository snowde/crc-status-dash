Dana R.,"El Cajon, CA",118,283,189,2.0,4/1/2014,"This used to be our go to place for family events as well as date nights. We've decided never to go back again, and not to just this bjs but any bjs. It's too bad because their huge menu made it easy for us to make everyone happy. After pineapple found in my Mac and cheese and undercooked chicken resulting in me missing days of work due to salmonella poisoning has made me too weary to cross the threshold of this establishment. No follow up from their home office or local management regarding my food poisoning. After talking to friends about my situation, I've found I'm not the only one. I do miss their signature root beer and cream soda, but not enough to chance it."
Cory F.,"Jacksonville, FL",5,5,6,5.0,6/12/2015,"Great waitress, quick to receive food, amazing food!!  The only issue was the strange coleslaw side salad that comes with the bison burger.  The burger was cooked to perfection and the beer is delicious.  We had the hopstorm IPA, the porter, the blonde and the light lager.  (Forgot the names sorry) a perfect atmosphere to go with the perfect food and service!  Would definitely recommend to anyone!!!"
Nina S.,"Pomona, CA",476,273,245,3.0,9/18/2011,"The waitress recommended the Grilled Chicken Pasta. It was alright. Something I could've made at home. The portions were big, but I started losing interest and taste in it after a few bites. My friends got the Crisp Potato Skins which was pretty yummy. The highlight of my meal was the Pizzookie. All my friends would tell me how great it was. The cookie itself was still a bit mushy. But all is forgiven since the rest of the cookie was nice, hot and wasn't all gooey. Thank goodness I shared the pizookie with my friend because we didn't even finish it (don't worry, there was just a bit left).  Our waitress was wonderful. We came in a group of 13. Make sure to call in for reservations as a just in case. It was pretty crowded the Friday night I was there with my friends."
Sonny G.,"Encinitas, CA",25,25,9,4.0,5/14/2015,"I'd give the place four stars. Actually surprised. Thought the food was gonna be basic. I'm here for happy hour. Cheap drinks and a few other food dishes. I'm having wings, pretty crispy and good."
C C.,"Yucca Valley, CA",0,13,2,4.0,9/16/2015,"I go here often, but I have noticed that sometimes the pizza is overcooked especially when it is very busy. I used to go here A LOT but I like my pizza cooked the same every time. They stopped serving my meatloaf too so I am disappointed, please bring back the meatloaf it was to die for!!"
Amanda P.,"El Centro, CA",61,1,,1.0,5/15/2016,"Worst BJ'S I've ever been too!! If I could give it negative stars I would. My husband and I were visiting from out of town and we decided to take our brothers and his sister here...first of all we were outcasts in the back corner with no one around us. Then it took thirty minutes to get someone's attention just so we can order drinks. I repeat FOR DRINKS. And all I wanted was water because I was so thirsty from our previous time at the beach.  Then when we ordered food our waitress corrected my husband twice in a condescending tone and as soon as she went to me she asked if I wanted to be skipped as soon as I was going to talk because she was rushing. When my soup came out it wasn't even warm!! Good but come on who likes cold soup. And by the time we got our entree we were so hungry and as soon as we start to dig in we realized none of us have silverware and napkins!!! And of course our waitress was gone. The manager was nice enough to knock off 25% off our bill and throw in two free pizookies but it honestly should of been completely  free. I mean if we're willing to pay $17 a plate which I could make in the comfort of my own home for way less then I don't expect to get worse service than a fast food restaurant. And when we ordered the pizookies we asked if she could bring spoons since our silverware doesn't come with them and we said it all nice and then of course in a rude tone she was like it comes with it so do you want extra silverware? I was all nice and said no but in my head I was thinking well she must think pastas and spaghettis are finger foods because we didn't get silverware for that until we asked. And when we told her about the pizookies being free for us she said again in a rude tone really? Because he didn't tell me that. So we were like just go talk to him because we were so fed up with her. And she was like I will. Of course she came out all like I'm sorry he didn't tell me. Then the pizookies were cold!!! I only had pizookies at the BJ'S in LA but every time I got a pizookie (which is a lot) it was fresh and so warm that when you take a piece of the cookie the chocolate chips were melted and gooey. If your reading this I'm sorry it's so long but if you think about it, if my post is this long that means to many things went wrong. I'm sure not all the staff is like this but this was our experience and that one waitress honestly ruined BJ'S for me and I've been going there for years. I had never had such poor service and never want to go there again. Maybe the one in LA but never this one"
CL M.,"San Diego, CA",0,17,,5.0,7/1/2015,"All the stars are for our waitress, Victoria.  The hostess was horrible, but Victoria's great customer service turn our dinner into an awesome time.  She was so polite, friendly, and helpful!"
Regan W.,"Poway, CA",182,3,,1.0,3/8/2015,"SHARP METAL IN FOOD!! I went to dinner tonight at this location and when I bit into my salad, my lip was cut by a sharp piece of metal. After showing it to the waiter, the manager came over and told us that it was a piece that had broken off of the mechanical slicer in the kitchen. They took the salad off of the bill, but I will not be returning to this location."
GlutenFreeS. D.,"San Diego, CA",40,88,,1.0,9/21/2013,"Two and half hours.  That's how long it took the four of us to get a simple one-course meal.  To be fair, we did ask our waiter two simple questions:  1) Was there a way to make a vegan pizza (my step daughter is vegan), and 2) did the kitchen take special care not to cross-contaminate for gluten free options during preparation.  We then ordered some appetizers and waited for our waiter to return with our answers so we could order our meal.  Well, the appetizers never arrived.  And neither did our waiter.  After about a half hour a new waitress appeared at our table (our first waiter was still in the restaurant, just pointedly avoiding us).  Our new server seemed completely unaware of either our appetizer order or our food questions, and she got busy getting those resolved. ....Another half hour and our appetizers arrived.  But still no answers to our questions.  So I went in search of a manager.  After standing for ten minutes or so by hostess station, ""Sean"" finally arrived.  I put my questions to him and, to my shock and amazement, he couldn't answer either one.  ""I'll have to check on that,"" he said, and disappeared.  I got the distinct impression that ""Sean"" was not the sharpest tool in the shed to begin with, and that perhaps the stress of his management position was a little beyond his capacity.  So I waited a few more minutes, and, when it was clear Sean wasn't returning anytime soon, I returned to our table.  At long last the waitress was now taking our order. Since we couldn't confirm any info regarding our dietary needs, I took a risk and ordered a GF pizza, and my step-daughter ordered a salad.  Another half hour later our main entrees began to trickle in...not together, but separately over a twenty-minute period.  It was ridiculous.  Then, as we approached the two hour mark and the last order (my step-son's regular pizza) hadn't yet arrived, I waived down our waitress.  ""Oh no!"" She declared, ""I completely forgot to put in his order!"" You get the picture. This wasn't the worst dining experience I've ever had...my GF pizza was actually pretty good and everyone else was happy with their meal as well (once the dishes finally arrived).  But the service was incredibly bad, even for San Diego's low standards. Lastly, I would also warn against ordering at the bar.  The bartender had little training and no clue about any of the drinks we wanted, or how to customize a drink, or even how to fix a drink he failed to mix properly.  My margarita was truly disgusting. So...we won't be eating at this location again, but hopefully this review can help the folks somewhere in the BJ management chain realize they have a self-destructive spiral occurring at this location."
Jack M.,"San Diego, CA",5000,4064,27983,4.0,7/24/2011,"I went to BJ's thinking I was going to have a quick light meal, but when I saw they had Black Agnus Country Fried steak, I could not resist. It took a about 10 minutes for my meal to arrive, and when it arrived, my eyes were popping out. It was huge! There were two huge crispy fried steaks sitting on a mound of very good mash potatoes, and served with a melee of steamed veggies. I added a photo for reference. The fried steak was very good but the breading could of used some more aggressive seasoning. The potatoes were delicious and the veggies were cooked perfectly and had a nice crunch. Overall the meal was very filling, given I ate the whole thing. It cost $12.25 which for most people, it could of easily served two. The waiter was attentive and polite."
Priscilla O.,"San Diego, CA",26,52,15,3.0,7/14/2012,"One word draws me to Bj's and that's Pizookie!  It sounds dumb, but a cookie with ice cream is probably one the best ideas ever.  Besides this delectable desert, Bj's is know for it's vast menu. You could get almost anything here and I think that makes it a great place to take large groups. It gives everyone plenty of options and you won't have to hear anyone complain about how they don't want to eat anything. You might, on the other hand, hear that they don't know what to eat because there is way too much awesome stuff to eat and drink. By the way, their beers are very tasty :) As for service, this place is usually top notch, but on busy nights it can be sub-par. I usually let it slide because it's never been that bad.  Waits do get long though, especially when a big movie is playing at the mall theaters. Speaking of the mall, this is an awesome location because you can build up an appetite with shopping and then satisfy your hunger, and thirst, at BJ's."
Kevin O.,"Clairemont, San Diego, CA",160,69,109,5.0,2/13/2014,"Went there Wednesday night with my fiancée and daughter. Christina H was our server. Took our order promptly, food came out fast and hot. Main reason for going was my daughter had a free psookie coupon. When we got there we realized the coupon doesn't start for a week, Christina acknowledged that it was for my daughter, and she went out of her way to get her one. Even got a 6 pk of beer to go. Was expecting at least a hundred dollar bill. Was half that so left her a 40% tip. Thanks Christina. Great service"
Kari K.,"San Diego, CA",212,31,126,5.0,1/21/2012,"I love this place! I have been a big fan of BJs Restaurant for 10 years.  I love their lunch deals. My favorite is the half flatbread pizza with a side salad for 6.95.  I ordered the California flatbread with cheese, bacon, chicken melted om top with ranch dressing drizzled over the toppings. The side salad came with some fresh dark greens, including spinach, chopped onions, thin carrot slices, tomatoes and balsalmic dressing.  Add a side of happy face potato fries with ranch dipping sauce for yourself or your kid. They are moist and delicious! Long island: good beverage with lots of booze!"
Taylor P.,"La Mesa, CA",90,55,13,2.0,11/7/2013,"Oh BJ's..... You owe me a BJ after tonights visit.  Came in this evening for dinner and sat in the bar. We ordered drinks, and app and dinner. We ordered 3 dishes and 2 salad's. 1 salad never came even after we asked the waiter. The food came at least 40 minutes after we input the original order. 2 of the plates were cold. We let the waiter know but we didn't have to wait around another 30 minutes while they recooked it. The fries were cold. Which SUCKED.   I do give 2 stars for the deep dish pizza, this was wonderful, perfectly cooked, which was probably why our other two plates were cold.  The service from the waiter was fine but the manager of this establishment is obviously doing something wrong. It really shouldn't take 2 hours for dinner.  We provided feedback to the waiter, and I realize it isn't it fault. But this place needs to step up their game if they want return customers."
Monique O.,"Spring Valley, CA",6,79,,2.0,5/2/2015,"Service is slow and the pizza is awful. .all bread, hardly any toppings or sauce:(((( makes me sad"
Denise T.,"El Cajon, CA",5,45,26,2.0,12/31/2014,"Horrible takeout experience. The food was supposed to be ready by 10:15, it wasn't ready until 10:45. The takeout server's assistant was rude, continuing to talk to other servers instead of greeting guests. He said my food wasn't done cooking and would be out later. What? He stocked napkins instead of taking care of guests waiting to order. When the takeout server asked him to go get mushrooms added to my pizza -which came out wrong, he said no! Anyways l'll probably be avoiding takeout there."
Lisa De Jesus - Realtor D.,"San Diego, CA",104,65,177,3.0,4/7/2015,"3 stars for service. Ordered a bison burger medium well and it came out with its heart still beating. Freshly murdered burger. No thanks. So they take it back. The server was embarrassed because he knew he had put in the right order. My daughter finished her mahi-mahi and I still didn't have my burger. Cancelled that and just hung out for dessert. All in all, not impressed. Towards the end of our meal there was a slight smell of pee wafting thru the restaurant. Yech."
Sandra G.,"Poway, CA",59,23,22,4.0,12/18/2013,"AFTER a lecture on the phone from the person next door at Casa de Pico (the fake, commercial, loud Mexican place next door to BJ's) because I SHOULD HAVE CALLED TWO WEEKS AGO (according to the rude person on the phone at Casa de Pico), I decided to call BJ's to get a reservation for my mother's birthday lunch.  Already dreading PARKING there, I called BJ's because my mother had been to an anniversary party there and said the pizza was fantastic.   BJ's WAS A GREAT EXPERIENCE!  The person on the phone was so kind, positive, and helpful.  Said they don't take reservations, but at 3:00, it was not a problem for four of us to get seated.  We arrived and had to wait for the other two guests.  The girls offered to seat us, offered a glass of water, and were as kind as can be!  They gave us a choice of seating, with a smile, and were so sweet to my mother, who was celebrating her 82nd birthday.   The food was pretty good, but the SERVICE was amazing.  Kind, prompt, not too much, but the BEST.  I recommend BJ's at Grossmont Center!  (But get there as early as possible, because PARKING is the only problem in that busy lot.)   Great people!!!!"
Tim H.,"La Mesa, CA",19,41,,3.0,3/11/2014,"I've never been super excited about BJ's. Decent pizza. Decent appetizers. Good selection of beers. Service isn't always fast but usually when I've been there its been busy and it's been a happy hour situation. Only eaten dinner there a couple times, not crazy about it. I think I had jambalaya. Average. The best thing they have is a pizzooki. Cookie dough baked in a pizza tin, topped with ice cream. It's warm, gooey and messy. The pizzooki easily deserves 4's. Based on it alone I would up my rating to 3.5's but I can't so they get 3.  My ratings... 5= great 4= good 3= average/ok 2= below average 1= didn't finish/ leftovers didn't make it in a to go box."
Audrey C.,"San Diego, CA",347,1172,345,3.0,10/25/2013,Don't like their pizzas. Very doughy.  But the pizookies are really really good.
