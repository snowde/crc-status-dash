Catherine C.,"San Diego, CA",73,49,55,3.0,3/4/2014,"BJ's is a pretty decent chain. The food is regularly good, the drinks are tasty and the service is prompt. This location unfortunately on the night I went was lacking in the service department. Granted it was a very busy Sunday, however even then, we were not checked back on regularly. Our food took a long time and the waitress did not come alert us to a back up, but instead just left us alone for a long period of time.  My deep dish pizza was perfection and my Strawberry Splash drink was tasty and not watered down.  I would come back again, in the hopes that it was just an isolated incident."
Harriet J.,"Redwood City, CA",63,14,20,5.0,6/12/2015,"The waitress that we had was right on the ball. Took our order for drinks and came back within a fair amount of time to place our order, give them good and outstanding"
Blair C.,"San Diego, CA",151,61,130,4.0,2/9/2015,"We had dinner there this evening and it was seriously wonderfully delicious. I had the chicken bacon ranch pizza which is always to die for. My boyfriend had the New York steak with cheddar mash potatoes and clam chowder. He wasn't very stoked with the mash potatoes or the soup. He said they were both very basic and bland, with the potatoes being a little on the cold side. But he thoroughly enjoyed the steak saying it was cooked perfectly and tasted delicious. We also got the Santa Fe spring rolls which were good but not the most amazing ones we've ever had. Cheesecake Factory does them much better. These were fairly basic, small with a good taste but nothing to die for. But the main reason I always come to BJ's is for their amazing deep dish pizza which is always the best and their amazing selection of craft beers. Their seasonal double IPA on tap right now is pretty superb. Besides all the food one of my favorite parts of the experience was the service. Our waiter was so friendly and attentive! He was constantly there when we needed him and even when we didn't. He knew all the beers very well and was able to recommend a few beers to both my boyfriend and I based on what kind of beers we normally drink and let us taste them to choose. And my favorite part, the pizookie!!! Delicious and perfect no matter what BJ's you go to:) I loved it!!! We had a great experience and look forward to coming back."
Realtor Karl B.,"San Diego, CA",59,1973,16,4.0,3/10/2014,"Great lunch spot where most combos are around $7 and there is no crowds. Start with the deep dish pizza (dipped in ranch) and end it off with a beignet for dessert. Come on a weekend night, and you will be stuck waiting for a table and everything is full price. This is when your bill can blow up if your group is sitting around drinking heavily while watch sports on all the beautiful TVs."
Corie M.,"East Windsor, NJ",0,8,7,3.0,3/6/2016,"Went in for a quick drink. Ordered a double so I could have 1 great drink instead of 2 mediocre drinks. The drink was 7.25 and I was charged 8.50 for an extra shot. If I knew it cost more to make it a double I would have just had 2 separate drinks. I asked the bartender about it, she was very pleasant and had it changed to the price of 2 regular drinks. But again I would have liked to try a different flavor drink if I knew it was going to be the same price. The price was not on the menu and I guess I should have asked about the price but I didn't want to be that cheap ass / I'm a bartender and from my experience it has been cheaper to get a double than order 2 drinks. Maybe if you don't offer a double price you should tell the customer when they order. Either way the drink was good and the menu seemed to have a wide variety of options."
Brad L.,"Spring Valley, CA",0,13,,3.0,5/24/2015,"We've been to this restaurant many timeS over the last several years. Food is consistently good but does not wow you.  Atmosphere also good bar can be noisy,  in general lighting and sound, and cleanliness is good, Occasionally menus are dirty.  Service is hit and miss. Last go-round the food was delivered but the food runner  took off before we could ask him to bring the silverware, likewise appetizers served without appetizer plate. And a common problem today is when the servers clearing the first course they will ask me to hold onto my dirty fork so I can use it with dinner. Then expect me to lay my dirty fork on the bare table. This has become all too problematic in service today.  Just need to include two forks in your silverware roll ups."
John S.,"San Diego, CA",1,23,,5.0,5/22/2015,Still the best. Everyone should go at least once in a lifetime. Good job guys. My wife  and I used to come often before we moved. I had a time to  stop by today and it was great.
Kenneth C.,"San Diego, CA",10,13,19,3.0,3/17/2015,Birthday party for a friend.  Waitress was awesome. The server was never around to keep drinks full. Coffee was cold. Took 90 minutes for the pizza to arrive. Server dropping silverware on guests. Priceless.
Tenishia K.,"San Diego, CA",1,16,,4.0,6/24/2015,"Clean, friendly staff, lots of parking, but difficult to find a space open. The food is great, but they almost always seem to get some detail of my order wrong."
Maria C.,"San Diego, CA",7,9,,2.0,6/22/2015,"Wait staff was really great and their Happy Hour is just okay, but the worst is the bathrooms.  The baby changing station was so gross and the floors had an rim of dark filth on them like nobody had done more then sweep and take a quick dirty mop to it in MONTHS (the sink and mirror area was just as bad)  Like get some bleach in there asap and fix this.  If you have a child DO NOT go here. GRoss Gross gross."
Paula C.,"Santee, CA",0,5,,1.0,6/21/2015,"TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE.  Last night, my family and I got take-out BBQ chicken salads and a pizookie which both were very unsatisfactory. The salads consisted of old lettuce, corn, and a few pieces of dry chicken which is 3 of the 8 things the salad was supposed to have on it. The pizookie was very hard and looked like it had been sitting for a few hours.  We then returned to BJs for a refund or remake of our food and were treated horribly by the young girl at the take-out counter. It then took about 10 minutes for the manager, Ryan, to come out to remedy the situation. Ryan was very rude and did not apologize for our experience. We decided to get a refund after he said it would take 20 minutes to prepare two salads and a pizookie. He did not seem willing to refund us, but after an ""I guess we can do that"", he took about 10 minutes to find our order on the computer and give us our money back. We tried giving our unappealing food back to the young girl at the take-out counter, but she replied while looking down and chewing her gum, ""nope, you can keep it"".  Overall, BJ's service has greatly declined and I can say without hesitation that they have lost our business. Both Ryan and the girl in takeout were very rude and were not apologetic in the least.  I would not recommend going to this location let alone this restaurant."
Frances L.,"South San Francisco, CA",2,33,1,3.0,2/11/2014,"The food isn't anything to write home about, but it's not that bad either. I had their Ahi Tuna Salad and I have to say that it was actually alright! Granted, it took more than 20 minutes for it to come out, but definitely still good. Restaurant salads can tend to have too much dressing but it turned out to be light and surprisingly delicious instead. I also had their famous Pizookie, a warm gooey cookie topped with ice cream. Doesn't matter where you go, a dessert like this will always hit the spot :).  In terms of service, I don't know if it was just that night but it was incredibly sloooooow. We only ordered salads & pizza but we were there for 2 hours, spending most of it waiting for everything. Food took awhile, bill took awhile. You get the picture. To give credit where it's due though, our waitress was incredibly nice. When my friends didn't like their salad (mysteriously their Caesar salad didn't taste like Caesar...) she made sure to get them a different salad of their choice (free of charge) AND had the chef in the kitchen make a whole new batch. Professional, right? Best of all, she didn't make a fuss or give us a hard time about it. I was going to give BJ's only 2 stars because of the slow service but our server was so professional I had to bump it up to 3! Overall, I'd say this place is good if you're getting together with a group of friends and just want something to munch on. BJ's might not be mind blowing (or my cup of tea) but I think there's something here for everyone."
Betty W.,"San Francisco, CA",0,4,,4.0,3/29/2016,"We had a coupon for a large discount, but we could not find our BJ's card.  Krystyn helped by Hailey spent time checking the computer base to finally find our common name and finally our BJ's number.  We appreciate all the service and attention Krystyn gave us. Thank you so very much."
Skylar C.,"San Diego, CA",33,59,32,4.0,1/21/2015,Very extensive menu which I love! Gotta always save room for the pazokies. I love that you can get mini ones as well because for me the regular size is just too much got me
Riggorus N.,"San Diego, CA",0,9,,2.0,9/2/2014,"Service and food is ok but the food here is a bit overpriced with small portions. Recommed to go to CHEESECAKE FACTORY, instead for the prices that they charge with bigger portions.  I got to admit though, their avocado egg rolls are bomb!"
Manny G.,"San Diego, CA",0,10,,4.0,6/10/2015,"LOVE their in house craft beers. Come during Happy Hour and a pint is just $3. can't beat that with a stick. Food is decent, nothing special. Great place to hang out after work!"
Shannon C.,"Lakeside, CA",11,18,4,3.0,12/30/2014,I'm not impressed with the customer service here or the curb side (un) service. They need to get rid of it altogether or have someone REALLY responsible for the task. Everyone wanted to pass the buck on who was going to help me AFTER I got out and went inside. Mind you I placed the order at 11:45 for a 4:15 pick up?  Had pizza in hand at 4:45 :( not impressed and the pizza was less than the service. Very skimpy on the toppings!  Not sure about going back. Lesson here is eat there or order to go when you get there then your expecting to wait.
Karan A.,"San Diego, CA",0,3,,1.0,4/26/2015,"I have been here twice, and the service is not upto the mark. They dont accept International driving permit which is really annoying. We had to go all the way home to just bring our international passport. Secondly, the service is really disappointing, it takes so long for them to bring the starters that we ordered. The waiters are so busy that they are not free to even listen to what we are asking them for the order. I would never go to this place again."
Cheyo P.,"La Jolla, CA",0,3,,5.0,6/4/2015,Great place for brunch. This is my first time here and its delicious .Excellent service
Jonelle O.,"Olympia, WA",180,472,534,3.0,11/18/2013,"I don't know, it's BJs. I don't like to review chains but I should note that we had a fantastic Google Deals voucher that got us two salads or soups (we chose wedge salads), any medium pizza (we chose the BBQ chicken), and any P'zookie thing (we chose chocolate chip) for $19.95. I mean, come on! How could we not go there and eat all that for $20.  It was pretty good and well worth the $20 but that's my main gripe with BJs. The food isn't that bad, but just like all these other chain restaurants, they charge way too much for the quality of food you're getting. If every item on the menu was about $3-$5 cheaper we'd probably come here for a quick bite more often. But as it is, paying $16 for meh fish and chips is not worth it to us. We'd rather go to a locally owned business and spend the same money there for halibut fish and chips. You get my drift? It's not bad food, but there is much better food to be had for the same amount of money or less. Their beer wasn't that great either. I mean, it's nice that they're trying -- what with being in San Diego, the land of craft beer. But nope. A big miss. No bueno."
