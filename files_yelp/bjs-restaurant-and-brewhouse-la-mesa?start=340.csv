Mitch B.,,543,303,1,3.0,12/11/2012,"I'm not big on reviewing chain restaurants. That said, BJ's gets a serviceable three stars specifically for the Parmesan Chicken and strong pours at the bar. Oh and the Pizookie!. I really haven't had a pizza that I thought was any better than Papa Johns and their house brews are soaked in meh. Having go to dishes here and the proximity to my house dictates that I wind up here a few times a year. WHEN YOU GO- you'll wind up at a BJ's someday. When you do don't get stuck on just pizza. There's quite a few good dishes on the menu besides Italian as well (Chicken Fried steak and all the chicken dishes are good). I've never had below par service which is surprising as they are always packed."
Lynn H.,"San Diego, CA",169,98,90,5.0,2/18/2011,"I really like BJ's mainly because they serve good food with a large variety to choose from.  I'm amazed on how good their pizza is here though, no lie they serve some good pizza and I love it.  Mainly because I'm not really a pizza person but I love their pizza here :D Their pasta here is good too (: I love their Spicy Spaghetti with chicken and their Grilled Chicken Alfredo.  The Spicy Spaghetti can be a little too spicy at times but I enjoy my food spicy. The service here is very friendly and the servers are so kind and happy.  I always feel welcomed when I come here.  BJ's is a really good place to go with your friends or even to watch a game :D"
Bonnie M.,"Lakeside, CA",0,3,,1.0,3/18/2016,"Worst Service Ever!!! I guess we should have know better than to go when we called 3 weeks ago for a 6:00 reservation for 11 people and was told we couldn't because they had a party of 50 coming in. We took the 5:30 reservation and the nightmare soon began. We were basically ignored through out the whole dining experience, when they would come and bring a few plates at a time they would place them down and hightail it out of there. It seriously took me 10 minutes to flag anyone down for a glass of water. My sons steak was ordered med/rare and came out med/well again another 10 minutes to get anyones attention. The steak was reordered and it took 20 minutes to come back to the table, by that time the rest of the table has finished their dinner.  It took us 2 hours to get out of there. I can go on and on about all the things that went wrong but this review would turn into a novel. Lets just say this is probably the second time in my whole life that I didn't leave a tip and I honestly don't even feel bad about it. Needless to say I will never go back!!!"
Send I.,"Spring Valley, CA",117,31,159,4.0,6/23/2011,"This spot is definitely my BF and I routine after a visit to my OB/GYN. We love their happy hour! 3-7 on weekdays. Mini deep dish pizzas are only $5. The works and sweet pigs w/ bell peppers are must haves.  Avocado Egg Rolls are buttery and crispy and will melt in your mouth. I'm hungry just thinking about it.  We've had their stuffed mushroom with spinach too and they were amazing. We always end our late lunch with a pizooki (half/half: double chocolate, white chocolate and stacked with two scoops of vanilla ice cream). Not only do I get to look forward to seeing my lil boy with a sonogram, but I get to dive into some guarantee delicious lunch too. So my doc's visits are always great news."
Imran K.,"Walnut, CA",3711,725,48,4.0,11/20/2012,"This restaurant is located close to a large shopping center. Huge parking lots and walked in were greeted by smiling employees. San in the bar under their $80,000 multi-channel Panasonic viewing screen. This is a amazing experience and one can view four channels at once. For lunch had their Turkey burger this is enormous and good enough for two people the dressing with the burgers is spicy and  delicious. I could not finish this. Had their strawberry and lemonade mix this is awesome sweet and tasty.  The people serving us were superb felt like I was at home. Awesome would return."
Ryan M.,"El Cajon, CA",0,4,,2.0,4/6/2015,"Food was good server wrote down my order correctly and when it was brought to me it was completely wrong. I asked for no veggies on my burger and shoestring fries, I got everything on my burger and wedge fries. The kitchen staff failed, I'd expect this at McDonald's but lately they've gotten my order right. I can't say that about this place."
Eilona K.,"El Cajon, CA",32,7,5,2.0,8/6/2014,Went late and the service sucked. Our hostess didn't even give us menus and our waitress was SO shitty. If it wasn't for the other helpful waitress that brought out ALL our food I would have left. The food was really good though as always.
Malia P.,"San Diego, CA",467,623,174,4.0,11/29/2010,I've celebrated many of my birthdays here. Maybe more than once a year. A-ha.  Did someone say free pizookie?
Jeff L.,"San Diego, CA",158,219,69,3.0,9/14/2013,"This review is for the bar area only.  I went here to watch a game and grab a few drinks. For Thursday there were happy hour specials as well as specials during the nfl game. I think the beer deal was 3.50 for their house brews, which was pretty good. I got the blonde ale and it was really smooth.  The prices outside of the happy hour menu were a little on the high side but not outrageous. We paid $17-18 for a half rack of ribs. The ribs were ok but not worth 17-18 bucks.  The real deal is that if you are going to watch a big game, they will have a huge tv dedicated. That is really cool but the atmosphere was pretty lame. Maybe the game was just pathetic but honestly the crowd was too eclectic to have any passion behind it.  Bottom line is that for an nfl game we got good drinks, average food, average service, and an average viewing experience. For all that, we paid $50 which doesn't seem like a lot but considering we got the ribs and that took up almost 40% of our bill we could have gotten a better value for our money."
E J.,"Serra Mesa, San Diego, CA",0,21,,1.0,7/1/2014,This place has gone down hill.  I used to come here weekly with my family. It was always a nice experience until today. Waited for water had to go ask finally. Was treated like we were wasting their time when ordering. Waitress was very inexperienced and was overloaded with tables. Never got the extra ranch I asked for. I think the new hires lack the same care and training I've come to expect from the veteran staff.  It was the antithesis of everything I had come to expect from this BJs after being a regular for so many years. This will be the last time I'm coming here ever.
Cay C.,"El Cajon, CA",0,12,,4.0,4/24/2015,Service was great and fast eventhough the place was full when we went there. I didn't like the bbq pizza as well as the Parmesan Chicken and I like their watermelon salad.
Heather F.,"El Cajon, CA",58,8,,5.0,12/30/2014,This is only my second time coming to BJ's and i am very impressed. Started with the avocado egg rolls which were to die for. Then I had the Cajun pasta which was delicious. My drink was the berry cider which was very tasty. The service was excellent as well.
Gabe H.,"San Diego, CA",677,610,811,3.0,9/28/2010,"Had a quick lunch this weekend here.  The waiter was a little obnoxious, but he was thorough.  If I had to choose I would take obnoxious and thorough over unattenive and absent.   I had the BBQ pulled pork sandwich and Mike had the chili cheese burger.  I enjoyed my sandwich it was flavorful and delicious.  I had the wedge cut fries on the side, unforuntatley these aren't super flavorful, but a dish of ranch makes all better. It was about 11:00 and we went straight to our table.  Speed of service was awesome because we were in and out and on with the rest of our day.  Overall it was a decent lunch.  Not overly impressive, but it fits the bill.  We will be back :-)"
Susan H.,"San Diego, CA",53,30,2,3.0,2/27/2015,"Cheers for BJ's ""Enlightened"" lower-calorie menu selections!  Truly appreciated.  I should have had one of the beautiful salads for lunch today, but opted for the grilled salmon.  Presentation was very nice, but the food was almost too salty to eat.  High  sodium is just as much of a problem as high calories!  :- /  Hope they'll see this...."
Ryan S.,"Chula Vista, CA",15,21,5,2.0,1/22/2014,"Definitely some kitchen issues tonight. Looks medium to medium-slow and I watch the server put our order into the computer and it was still over 25 min for our appetizers. Then entrees came out less then a minute later.  Also, two drinks at the table were forgot and never brought.  Food still tasted good though."
Kelli B.,"Santee, CA",5,7,8,2.0,1/21/2015,The food was alright. The service was shitty. My drink was empty for a good 15 minutes before the group of waiters and waitresses standing around chatting did anything. They only get two stars because their calamari and fried artichoke was actually pretty bomb.
Lani C.,"San Diego, CA",94,7,1,1.0,4/5/2015,"Been here several times & usually receive good service & food. Not the case tonight. We were told to wait 10 min so we found a table in the bar.  Took about 15 minutes, which didn't bother us since it was a busy Saturday night. After seating us, I  immediately asked to move as we were seated next to two swinging doors that the employees use to enter & exit the from the dining room to the kitchen. After moving, we got two cold beers & ordered dinner. However, the waitress couldn't multi task or  organize herself to handle more than one table at a time after she got a few more tables. At this point, we barely saw her. Someone else served our dinner which came out quickly & tasted good!!!! After the dinners were brought out, my husband immediately signaled for the waitress since his beer glass was empty.  The waitress kept rushing by empty handed but kept putting her finger up saying she needed a minute. We did finally flag her down & corner her but she never brought the 2nd beer my husband ordered due to the fact that she said the keg was getting changed. By then, my husband's meal was long gone. Interesting enough, the busboy never picked up our empty plates. He walked by often enough but only seemed focused on clearing & setting empty tables. Our dishes stayed until the end of the meal when the bill arrived. The waitress came over & said she felt bad & offered to take off my husband's first beer, which never happened. We paid the check up at the hostess stand as we were tired of waiting for her & spoke to the manager. Just thought he'd want to know....NOT THE CASE. He apologized  robotically & stared at us. I was so embarrassed by his lack of warmth or concern for our lousy service. Hey, I just thought he'd want to know. I got the feeling he felt we wanted free food or a discounted bill, which is clearly not the case. Lousy, lousy service & I'll never go back. Customer service is obviously not a priority at this establishment."
Vero G.,"La Mesa, San Diego, CA",0,11,,4.0,4/3/2015,"Always a busy place, but never got disappointed by their great Avocado Rolls! Service is always on point, and food is delicious. Love their small bites menu and their famous Pizookie is out of this world!!!"
Maria P.,"San Diego, CA",0,15,,2.0,8/30/2014,"It never ceases to amaze me how companies these days have put customer service on the back burner. I've ordered food to be delivered many times, and it always arrives cold and limp.  You figured I'd learn, well I have.  After sitting on hold for 10 minutes waiting for someone to take my order, I finally hung up. As convenient as this service is, I will no longer waste my money and time at this restaurant!!!  PEACE OUT BJ's!"
Magdalena P.,"La Mesa, San Diego, CA",37,4,35,4.0,9/26/2012,Piranha chili in a bread bowl was very tasty! Traditional calzone is very good as well. Favorite beer: piranha ale!:)
