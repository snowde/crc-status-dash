Roger N.,"Calipatria, CA",26,63,15,4.0,7/3/2014,"Great burgers, cold beer, amazing appetizers and very attentive service. This place always leaves me looking forward to the next trip.  The selection of beers is great. The Black and bleu house is my personal favorite.  Love that burger...."
Jess W.,"San Francisco, CA",66,554,528,3.0,6/11/2011,"I enjoy all the flatbread pizzas. I feel that I can't go wrong with them. Yes, I know they're famous for deep dish, but after one bad experience, I haven't been able to transition back.  Speaking of going back, I don't think I can go back to this particular location. I went home with a killer stomach ache that lasted till morning."
Johana T.,"San Diego, CA",477,556,1264,5.0,4/18/2011,I LOVE the food here! the pizza is delicious! and the service at this location is almost always the best :)
Taylor S.,"Murrieta, CA",161,96,5,3.0,11/6/2014,The hostess was so rude from the minute we walked in she had her eyes rolled at us. And our server has the worse attitude which totally sucks cause we came here yesterday and had the best service ever... I wish I got there names... Learn costumer service people!!
Nathalie G.,"San Diego, CA",2350,172,628,3.0,5/10/2013,I like this one better than the one in La Jolla.  It's bigger and food taste better.  I always order the Thai Shrimp Lettuce wrap because it's light and taste awesome.  Their pizza and wings are okay nothing and not a must have.
Shouka S.,"San Diego, CA",128,312,197,1.0,5/14/2014,"Never coming here again. Our server messed up on my order and wouldn't own up to her mistake. She tried to play it off as if it was my fault then tried blaming it on the kitchen, even though out receipt had the mistaken food item on it. As an ""apology"" she offered a free pizookie. But of course it wasn't an apology for mistaking my order. Also, I wasn't even halfway done with my food when she asked what kind of pizookie we wanted. My roommate received her food 20 minutes before me. I felt so pressured to quickly finish my meal. Even after we were done eating, our server did not pick up our food. My roommate and I decided to try the new salted caramel pizookie. It is WAY too rich and sweet for my liking. All of our plates were still on the table when we left. Would've been nice if the table was cleared when attempting to have dessert. Or even then, have a clear table to pay the bill. Again, she rushed with the bill and didn't bother to say take your time or anything. She just dropped the check off as if she wanted us out ASAP. Totally felt pressured once again. Ten minutes later, my roommate and I have both became terribly sick. Not sure if it was the lettuce in our salads or the pizookie. Regardless, the service was horrible and the food quality was horrible."
Kris G.,"El Cajon, CA",0,20,,1.0,10/24/2014,I always get the jumbo here cuz it's so good. Well tonight I don't know if the cook must of been having a bad night cuz the chicken and sausage was so dry u couldn't eat it. And I even had them bring me a new bowl in case I just a bum one and the second one was just as dry. Well maybe next time they will have it right:(
Margaret D.,"San Diego, CA",822,730,90,1.0,7/3/2012,"My group arrived around 5:30 with plans to see a movie at 8:20 at the theater. We had already purchased tickets, so we just needed to walk over. Three hours is plenty of time for dinner, right? It was my mother's group Mom's Night Out and everyone was looking forward to relaxing and eating before the movie. The hostess said we weren't getting seated until 6 because the patio server did not arrive until 6. I got a drink in the bar. When I went to settle my tab, paying for my single drink took about 10 minutes because I couldn't nab the waiter. It was not overly busy-- a Monday night with many empty tables at 5:45. He rang it up for a non-happy hour price, which he caught and corrected immediately.   The hostess then allowed us to sit out on the patio a few minutes early with drinks from the bar.  When the waiter arrived, a couple of women asked toward the beginning for separate checks, waiter said he would do that. There were 2-3 additional servers helping out, so they were not short of staff. People had trouble getting drink orders early on. A friend who arrived later went out of the bar and bought her drink-- she is a waitress and said she hates it when people do that, but felt it was quicker. Waiter asked if anyone wanted apps. We said we were ready to order dinner and did so. Three people got apps, one to eat as the main course. The women indicated they wanted the apps at the same time as the main course. They set out app plates for everyone and brought the apps out before the main. My friend ordered a sirloin, medium-rare. It was well-done. Like, very well done. She waited for someone to appear so she could tell them, but no one did, so another friend went out and grabbed someone. There was a group of servers just inside the door who were not doing anything, though not assigned to our table. The waiter brought her another steak, also well-done. She brought this to their attention again. Finally the manager came out and said the waiter had written down ""medium well"" instead of ""medium rare"" and they had just figured it out. By the time they brought Steak 3, she was full on potatoes and green beans. Another annoying bit: when they gave her a new plate, they did not clear the old. So I stacked them up for her after I was done with my plate.  I got the ""Maui pork chop."" It was supposed to have a spicy glaze but it was dry and hard on the outside with no flavor. My roasted red potatoes were soggy and some of them cold. I did not point this out because it seemed like it would completely overwhelm the staff . The lady across from me got the Hawaii Mahi over rice, and she was salting it heavily and pouring lemon on it because it was bland.  After the disappointing entree, I wanted to order dessert, but nobody ever came by for the order. The lady beside me ordered dessert, grabbing the waiter as he went by. No one else got a dessert order in. 25 minutes later, she had no dessert and asked where it was. He said it was coming and brought it out 30 seconds later.  At about 745 we asked for the check, figuring that 15-20 minutes was plenty of time to pay. It was not. The guy had not separated the checks and went around asking what everyone had had and writing it down. So by 810, we still did not have the checks. Once I got mine, I went out front and got the manager to ring it up. He said the problem was that we asked for separate checks. ""When you ask for separate checks, it takes longer for our system to process it,"" he said. Really? It takes your system almost 3 hours to process it, because that was asked for at the beginning. Also, if they do not want to do separate the checks, that is fine; the restaurant can just say they don't want to. It is unacceptable to agree to it and then not want to do it. And the waiter and manager did know we needed to leave before the checks came. And separate checks have nothing to do with service. I did not argue because all I wanted to do was go see the movie. Anyway, it was a big hot mess. We got movie seats, but down in the way way  front."
Vincent M.,"San Diego, CA",32,17,23,1.0,10/20/2014,Came in on a Monday Night and got no service. Wife and I stood at counter for a couple minutes waiting for someone to greet us and got nothing. So I will spend my money next door at Casa De Pico. I will never go here again.
Jean R.,"San Diego, CA",0,3,,4.0,1/29/2013,"I love BJ's!  There I said it.  I usually stop here for lunch after shopping at the mall.  They have great service, great food and a huge selection of craft beers.  Their Piranha Pale Ale is excellent.  I've tried the P.M. Porter, which was okay, My favorites are the IPA's:  BJ's Hopstorm is good, but the Green Flash IPA is the best in my opinion. Oh yeah, the food:   The Santa Fe salad with Cajun shrimp is my favorite.  Tons of fresh vegetables with crunchy tortilla strips.  I usually ask that they use a little less spice on the shrimp.  Otherwise, it feels like my ears are on fire.  The clam chowder is superb.  I recently ordered from their lunch specials.  Tried the 1/2 black and bleu flatbread pizza paired with spring greens.  Was worried the pizza might be too rich, but it had the perfect amount of bleu cheese and steak.  All for $5.95! Cons:  They took the pesto flatbread pizza off the menu.  Please bring it back!"
Dung N.,"San Diego, CA",2112,1692,7180,4.0,4/8/2011,"I had the BBQ chicken pizza and it was half off because of happy hour. Since it was my friend's bday and he doesn't like chocolate, I had the pizookie all to myself :)"
Ryan S.,"Escondido, CA",1,129,25,1.0,12/4/2014,"Only came here to try something different from eating at casa de pico when we are in the area. BIG MISTAKE. For starters it took 10 minutes  after we were seated for anyone to acknowledge us. Once we were finally greeted we were already ready to order. 44 minutes after they took our order our food came. My fries were missing. My gf pizza was cold like it was sitting out for a solid 20 minutes. The server knew somewhere along the line a worker messed up firing our order and he messed up not putting my fries on the order so he told a manager to come talk to us. So I'm thinking, here comes the time to save us as customers and split the bill with us (which was only $34) and he goes ""I heard your pizza was cold and it took a really long time to get your food. So I'm going to take the pizza off the bill. You have a good night"" and walked off. Awesome. Not. Ended up paying $27 for a cold 6"" pizza a grilled cheese sandwich and a broccoli soup and two sodas. That will teach me to stray off from my regular restaurant."
Josh R.,"La Mesa, CA",42,17,9,3.0,12/2/2014,"I love getting a burger here, my girlfriend really likes the vegetarian options, even though she's not vegetarian. Good cold draft beers. Had a pie last time it was alright.. service is there, young usually. It's ok though. I always just sit in the bar area since its first come first serve."
Angela B.,"San Diego, CA",370,160,1412,4.0,3/30/2013,BJ's has a great enlightened menu for those of us who are watching our caloric intake. I absolutely love the California flat bread pizza and the Hawaiian Mahi mahi. I go to BJ's in grossmont center frequently and everyone of the waiters and waitresses I've had have been superb! I am removing one star because it is a bit pricey.
Deb B.,"Ocean Beach, CA",17,128,1,5.0,8/14/2012,"Three things your should know... White Shark Pizza Cantaloupe Martini White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Pizookie ... that's pretty much the best part, beside the grip of beer on tap. Chill atmosphere, similar to any middle class restaurant, sports are always on in bar and I think all locations have outside seating. I'd take this over gordon biersch everytime."
Matt T.,"San Diego, CA",0,2,,1.0,2/12/2015,"We just finished having our wedding rehearsal dinner here in a side room. We specifically asked if we would have the room to ourselves and they said we would. We wanted to give speeches for our guests and and have it be an intimate time together. However, when we showed up this evening they seated us then began to seat another group in the same room!!!! I called over a manager and asked why there was another group with us. he informed me that it was because we had under 50 people. Then I informed him that that is not what Ryan, the guy I previously spoke to said. Then he said, and I Quote, ""yeah we really don't tell people about that.""  i feel LIED to. This was my wedding rehearsal dinner. It wasn't just another  birthday party which comes every year. I feel very let down and BETRAYED. I also encourage you to seriously think twice about booking any important event at this place. They lie."
Deb G.,"Crest, CA",73,339,3,5.0,8/27/2012,Came back for Dinner on Friday with the Hubby (Date Night)  We had to wait about 15 minutes for a table but it was well worth it.  The service was amazing and so was my food and drinks.  I had a pasta dish with sun dried tomato's and the mushroom fries as an appetizer - Can you say Yummy!   My hubby and I loved this place that we are coming back very soon!  Our server was a delight and want to give her 5 stars also.
Sal M.,"Las Vegas, NV",5,78,54,4.0,6/4/2014,"It was my first time at this BJ's, every time I go to BJ's I do get there's awesome wings, they were a bit spicy this time but my gf really enjoyed the flavor they are great and original wings, I usually get random items off the menu, pastas, or chicken fried steak, but since me and my gf were not to hungry we agreed on a Pizza, and wow it was moist, thick and full of flavor, we were full after a slice each, and even the next day microwaving it, it remained just as flavorful and moist, not the hardened pizza you usually get from Pizza Hut and dominos left over, it's always a very lively atmosphere, can be an excellent date location or just a place to have a dinner with friends, although I do warn you, parking is horrible at this location due to the weird set up of this mall parking lot. But the wait staff was friendly and welcoming."
Sean L.,"San Diego, CA",230,302,536,4.0,6/25/2010,"I'm not from Chicago, but I have been there and I've had deep dish.  I have to say, BJ's is one of the closest I've come to finding similar deep dish here on the west coast. Mom and I stopped in a few days ago for lunch, debating between here and Panera.  BJ's made our choice easy for a few reasons- Panera is WAY overpriced for a sandwich shop.  At BJ's, you can sit and have a server take care of you.  Panera makes you stand in line and your food comes out on a plastic plate and surprisingly, for the same amount (or more) than BJ's weekday lunch will cost you!  I ordered the personal 1-topping pie with a wedge salad, which from 11am-3pm Mon-Fri costs a whopping $6.25!  Definitely made the right choice.  BJ's does something magical to the wedge, and it's all in their dressing.  It's a sweeter variation of a blue cheese, along with bacon, onions and tomatoes, the wedge is a winner every time.  And my pizza: thick, buttery, hot, cheesy and crispy, just like I like my women... Not in the mood for pizza?  Fine, BJ's also offers salads, sandwiches, burgers, ribs, fish, pasta... and if that's not enough, how about one of their giant baked potatoes?  Top it with chili, alfredo, cheese, broccoli, blackened chicken.... the possibilities are endless. You may have also noticed ""Brewhouse"" in their title.  Yes, that means they brew their own beer, and do a damn good job of it.  Porters, wheat, red, blonde- if you can think of it, they probably brew it! During happy hour, your visit gets even sweeter.  Half priced apps & mini-pizzas, as well as discounted cocktails and beer!  A little too late because it's not on the menu anymore, but the blackened chicken pizza came with a special surprise.  On your happy hour bill, it would read ""Black Chix Special"" (which may have something to do with why it's no longer on the menu).  I would order it just for enjoyment of sharing the bill with my friends and even the servers who never paid attention to it before. Oh and like I even need to tell you about the Pizookie.  If you live near a BJ's and have never had one, WTF is wrong with you?  And shame on your friends for hiding this from you.  Freshly baked cookie (chocolate chip, white chocolate, peanut butter, or oreo) topped with vanilla ice cream right out of the oven!  Can't decide?  Go half and half, OR get their giant 3-cookie Pizookie to provide fun for your whole table, or a stroke for one person. BJ's has it all, and their food is a step above most brewhouses, which try to direct our focus to their beer in an attempt to slip sub-par food down our throats without us noticing."
Pam P.,"San Diego, CA",2,45,4,4.0,6/21/2013,One of the few restaurants that I always get good service and great accomodation for gluten free food.  I LOVE their GF pizza (I am a sensitive celiac) and their GF Pizookie is FABULOUS!   Enjoy!
