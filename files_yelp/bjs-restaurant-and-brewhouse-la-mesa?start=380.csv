Bruce H.,"San Diego, CA",14,25,5,5.0,8/19/2012,"My wife and I have always enjoyed BJ's.  Never once have we had a bad experience and the quality of the food and service is exceptional.....however we visited on Saturday Night and this time is was different.....IT WAS OUTSTANDING! A very busy night with a party of what looked like 20 before us...the wait was all of about 10 minutes.  Food was incredible!  I had the steak, my lovely wife had the Pot Roast and our son had a pizza.  What really made the night OUTSTANDING was our server. If you go to BJ's in La Mesa call ahead and make sure you ask for Loni.  This server rocks!  Now I don't normally single out specific employees in reviews that are public but this server had us at, ""Soooo it's Saturday night what are you all doing tonight to have fun""...after that we could tell this was gonna be GREAT and it was! If you have seldom had 'out-of-the -park' home run hitting service in a restaurant, go see Loni....she is an example of what great service is all about. NICE JOB BJ's AND LONI...KEEP UP THE HIGH STANDARDS."
Mark G.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,8,,3.0,12/19/2015,Placed an order online and set a reasonable pickup time allowing time for food to be prepared. It is almost 30minutes over pick up time. The take out system at this BJs isn't too organized.
Brent N.,"San Diego, CA",7,56,2,4.0,9/17/2014,Fantastic food. Love the pork chops and their blue cheese dressing is the bomb. Good attentive service.
Michelle B.,"El Cajon, CA",0,17,2,1.0,1/12/2016,I'm jealous of all these good reviews. I have given up on BJs a long time ago because of poor service. Once my boyfriend and I ordered our food and waited for 2 hours (possibly longer it was our 2nd date) and never got our food. The waitress forgot to put in our order or something but she kept bringing us drinks. I called the next day and they gave us  a gift card which was nice but the service remained terrible the next time. They have brought us other people's food including a birthday dessert with lit candle and all. They like to give us our appetizers AFTER our food which is interesting.... Tonight we went to BJs because we got a gift card for Xmas. It was awful. Had to ask 2 different people to refill our drinks. We waited a good 30 minutes after we were eating for our check.
Alexis D.,"Santa Cruz, CA",419,310,1198,4.0,5/26/2010,"I came to this BJ's for the first time for a friends birthday dinner a few months ago.  I've been to the BJ's in Chula Vista so I knew what to expect.  Hands down, this location is much bigger than the one in Chula Vista. I didn't get a chance to visit the bar, but, just by looking at it, it looks bigger and better than CV's. I was feeling the vibe on a Friday night.  Our party was outside on the patio. I think we had about twenty or so people for the birthday dinner.  My girlfriend and I ordered a small BJ's Favorite pizza which included oven-baked meatballs, pepperoni, Italian sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, black olives, white onions and seasoned tomatoes. The pizza is perfect for one really hungry person or for two people. The pizza was REALLY good. My girlfriend and I both enjoyed every bite of it. And, for dessert, we ordered their new pizookie trio. We had to choose three out of the five. So, we ordered a chocolate chunk, White Chocolate Macadamia Nut and Cookies 'N Cream. Whooooooooooooo! They were all amazingly deliciously good! Our favorite was the White Chocolate Macadamia Nut. Oh man! Seriously, its so warm in your mouth with a soft chewy cookie and to balance it out, vanilla ice cream.  Customer service was good. The waitress did a good job for being a busy Friday night and, especially with a twenty+ party to attend to.  I wouldn't go out of my way to drive out here just for this BJ's, but if an event or special occasion came up, I wouldn't hesitate to come here again.  Mmmmmmm Pizzookie I miss you!"
Sandra F.,"San Diego, CA",227,82,1524,3.0,8/13/2013,"Food was great, watermelon arugula salad, Thai won tons, macaroni cheese. The server was a total airhead, I asked what the happy hour specials were and she blanked out."
Dana A.,"Lemon Grove, CA",0,18,46,3.0,10/27/2014,"I go to BJs all the time, Its a safe food place for be me. But today I decided to venture out and try their new beef fettucini,  blah! Yuk! No bueno. They gave me a review card to fill out and give them my opinion.  I couldn't find anything to say to describe how awful it was. Oh well,  I'll have to stick with what I know here. Other than that, service is great, beer is tasty, the rest of the familiar items r no Brainers."
Amber M.,"San Diego, CA",80,74,34,3.0,10/26/2014,"Tables are small not much room to eat unless you're a party of 2. Our food wad slow. We ordered for our kids almost immediately and their plates were last to come out. I think a lot of this has to do with football. However, we came in time for happy hour cheap stuff! Ordered chicken bacon ranch pizza and it was the bomb. I always love bjs pizza."
Ashley T.,"San Diego, CA",421,43,374,4.0,2/24/2011,"I really enjoy eating at the BJ's location in La Jolla. Of course, everything and ANYTHING on their menu is delicious. They have a variety of things to choose from to be able to accommodate different people with different tastes and preferences.  I particularly like this location. It is larger and roomy. The only thing about this place is the parking. It is in the Grossmont Shopping center so parking is difficult. People are trying to park for the shopping center, the movie theaters, and different stores and restaurants around there. But it is worth it.  Their pizza is amazing. I LOVE their giant baked potatoes. You can customize them to your liking and it is enough to fill you up as a meal (that is, of course, if you dont mind eating a whole plate of CARBS for lunch/dinner) :) I especially liked their Parmesan Chicken!  But im sure no one will let you leave without having the BEST dessert to end your meal. PIZOOKI- large warm cookie of your choice, freshly baked topped with a large scoop of vanilla ice cream! The great thing that i love about this is that you get to have a variety of cookie flavors to choose from! AND on top of that, you can ask to get 1/2 and 1/2. I always get 1/2 Chocolate Chip Cookie and 1/2 White Chocolate Macadamia Nut! They compliment each other very well! :) ENJOY!"
Kelly O.,"San Francisco, CA",0,16,1,5.0,10/23/2014,Went for happy hour but they were packed. They let us order from the happy hour menu from the regular seating. Food was good! Drinks were good! Our server Adam C was on point. Haven't had service that good in forever!
Ken R.,"El Cajon, CA",49,420,28,3.0,1/7/2013,"Great beer, great servers but the pizza could be better. All of their beers are fantastic and I have never had a waiter who wasn't super friendly and great at their job. Their pizzas have great toppings but are a little dry and are skimpy with the toppings, hence the 3 stars. I would never say no to a BJ but I wouldn't come running for this one either......"
Lynette M.,"San Diego, CA",31,99,10,4.0,4/18/2012,"Great dinner, great service. - Had the low cal menu and it was great, I had the chicken with veggies and rice. The stuffed mushrooms and the side salad. All very fresh and tasty ! Zach was my waiter and he was very professional and made my dining experience really nice. okay he was very handsome as well, that's what I really wanted to say."
Beth W.,"San Diego, CA",118,210,18,4.0,4/1/2012,"BJ's is certainly not on the top of my list, but for a chain restaurant its pretty good! It has an extensive menu that should please almost everyone in your group - young and old alike. The decor is standard and honestly, if you've been to one BJ's you've been to them all.  The bottom line is that they have a great selection of beers and tasty pizzas. The atlantic salmon filet (blackened) with lemon chardonnay butter sauce, rice pilaf and steamed vegetables is also surprisingly good and the pizookie (a large, hot, melt-in-your-mouth delicious cookie topped with a scoop of ice cream) is a must have.  The La Mesa location is filled with families and is far from being a hot spot. However, if you want to have a low key evening, try sitting in the bar area where the servers are on point and they have several tv's to view from almost every seat. Three and a half stars but I'm rounding up to 4 because of the pizookie."
Aaron H.,"San Diego, CA",0,2,,5.0,6/16/2014,I came in with a group of four guys and had wait a bit longer than usual for our food. Before we noticed the long wait time Colleen the manager came out and let us know that our meal was paid for by her. Great customer service. She is the real MVP
Princess L.,"Chula Vista, San Diego, CA",115,27,21,5.0,7/27/2015,This trip to BJ's could have gone really really bad but the staff completely made up for it. A girlfriend and I came in to celebrate my birthday. We ordered a pizza and a bacon cheeseburger. It took over 45 mins to get our meal. I wasn't as irritated because I had good company and we were talking up a storm but after 35-40 I started to get a little curious. The waiter felt our anticipation came over and explained our food would be out in a few moments due to a computer error. She then apologized and came back with our food in about 5 more minutes. After we were done a manager came to us and reminded us of how long we waited and continued to apologize for our meal taking so long gave us a birthday pizookie and then told us he comped our meal and was sorry about the mix up. No restaurant I have ever been to has ever taken responsibility for their inability to provide great service. We are very thankful! I wish I remembered their names but we were very pleased about how the situation was handled.
Aki K.,"Sydney, Australia",1,57,,3.0,10/31/2013,"Good food and a huge menu, it's so hard to pick because everything sounds good.  I love the alcohol drink specials here too, Strawberry Breeze is yummy."
Thayne L.,"San Diego, CA",330,295,43,5.0,1/6/2010,"Whoever said a restaurant thats in the same parking lot as a mall couldn't have good food needs to re-evaluate their standards!  BJ's is a cool place.  I used to come with my boys here every sunday after work for drinks and apps.  Tonight, I came with my girl and we brought our friends on a double date after going bowling.   I got my traditional app here, the Santa Fe Spring Rolls which never disappoint, and a mini pizza w/ artichoke hearts.  As Rachel Ray would say, Yum-O!   My girl and her friend shared the sampler platter and got some fruity cocktails that they loved.  Also helps my good friend Allie was bartending and she is an awesome bartender.  Not bad on the eyes either.    My boy Keg-O and I were drinking beers.   He had the Red and i had the Buttery Ale which has 10% alcohol so its pretty strong and has a nice taste. Their full menu is very extensive and awesome.  They have all kinds of food from italian, to steak & chicken, salads and even some seafood.  Can't ask for more.  I really like this place and I never leave dis-satisfied.   They have a lot of nice looking women working there also.  Best part, the hot female bartenders are cool as hell and will have a real conversation with you, not just blow you off or treat you like your just money in their pocket.   All in all, this place rocks and is worth coming to if your ever in the area.  The pizza rocks too, so if your hungry and want a good meal, why go to some shit place in the food court and have some 15 year old spitting in your burger when you can come here and have a good meal."
Roger M.,"Mission Hills, San Diego, CA",3523,527,12341,3.0,10/14/2007,"I enjoy coming here from time to time with friends during happy hour for their deep dish pizzas.  They look small but will def fill you up and also taste decent. The wait time isn't so long as there is plenty of seating inside.  The patio area is a cool spot to sit at and also less noisy than sitting inside as many people packed up the bar area and chat loudly. The nachos plate is huge and can feed up to 3 or 4 of your friends and is a good choice to start off with. And for you dark beer lovers, BJ's has a good selection to choose from, so you can wash down that meal you just had :P"
Angel F.,"San Diego, CA",3,66,15,4.0,11/24/2010,"The pizza here is pretty good considering they serve up plenty of other specialties on the menu. I like an OG pepperoni  and mushroom. There a pic so check it out.  The bartenders and waiters/waitresses are very friendly and always keep my cup full and cold. They are attentive and usually mention any special and are more than happy to recommend a new item or something that might be of interest to me. They serve up a mean pazookie but watch out don't try to move the pan like I did and burn your fingers. For those who dont know what a pazookie is, its a freshly baked cookie topped with ice cream and it is enough for two so I encourage you buy one if you want to share something with your date er pal...haha."
Tina H.,"La Mesa, CA",18,110,441,5.0,11/13/2010,"BJ's lunch is from 11-3 and the beers are $3 and mini pizzas are $5! You can't beat that!  My friend ordered the Berry Burst Cider and let me try it-OMFG.  Tastes like kiwi strawberry goodness!!  Or as she said, a capri sun.  I ordered myself one and it turned into 3!   And a little research while I waited on my tardy bestie, they have the nutrition content and the highest was the bacon cheeseburger pizza with a whopping4673 calories, 11272 mg sodium, and 392 sat fat grams!!  How'd ya like THEM apples!???"
