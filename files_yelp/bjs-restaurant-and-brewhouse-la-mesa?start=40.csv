Art L.,"San Diego, CA",1,8,,2.0,9/25/2017,"Food is good, service just slow in general. But  Took them more than 15 minutes to bring our dessert."
Laura C.,"San Diego, CA",70,7,5,5.0,6/22/2017,Really great food and service! My kids loved the pizookie! $4 craft beers on Wednesday nights!
Rachel B.,"Lakeside, CA",0,7,,1.0,12/3/2017,"We have been here many times before but lately service has been less than satisfactory. Tonight we made a reservation for a party of 8 for 6:30. We arrived around 6:25, and when we went to check in we were told by the hostess we would have to wait about 30 minutes. We argued with her a bit and were able to get it down to 20 minutes. We were seated in the back, our waitress was friendly but didn't seem to know what was going on. She mixed up some of our drinks and at the end mixed up our checks as well. It took them two reminders to get them to bring us some utensils. One person in our party didn't get her meal until we were all almost done. And one of our drinks was served in a cracked glass. The last time we were here we had a similar situation where a pizza we ordered was made incorrectly and then the new one didn't come out until everyone was finished. The manager was not very understanding and she did comp the pizza but we could tell she didn't want to. The menu is good and the wait staff is usually nice but the service just isn't worth it. Will not be coming back."
Karena V.,"San Diego, CA",47,1,,2.0,9/29/2017,"Ordered the Hawaiian chicken deep dish and a mozzarella and tomato salad. Boy was that a mistake. I'm a Midwesterner, and if you're going to make deep dish pizza, at least do it right. The pizza was nothing close to what a deep dish is supposed to be. It was more like a pan pizza from Pizza Hut but Pizza Hut gives you way more toppings. Tomato and mozzarella salad was even worse. Literally threw shredded basil, 3 chunks of tomato, and like 4 mozzarella balls together.. It was the plainest tasting thing ever. It was a waste of $30."
Seany F.,"San Diego, CA",1,12,,5.0,6/16/2017,"The Seany Foundation has been lucky enough to have food from BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse at many of our events throughout the years. From orders serving 20 people to orders serving 200 people BJ's has always come through with exceptional food and service.  In addition to what we've done with them over the years, over the past 6 months BJs has provided food for a monthly gathering for children affected by cancer. Each month this pizza is delicious, and the ever- rotating pizookie flavor is more delicious than the last. Though we must admit- the monkey bread is probably one of the best desserts we've ever had! And it is something the kids look forward to month after month.  Their pizza is hearty, and delicious and the pizookies are fun, sweet and tasty!  Not only is the food great, and consistent in quality, the service is always exceptional. The servers are always friendly and helpful to all of our needs.  The Seany Foundation could not be more pleased with the great food BJs has delivered throughout the years. And we would definitely suggest ordering from BJs for your next dinner out or big event.  Thank you to Braxton and the entire BJs team for your continued support of The Seany Foundation! The staff and most importantly, the kids, are incredibly grateful!"
J E.,"Lakeside, CA",0,14,,4.0,5/26/2017,"So I am editing /adding to a review a did a little while back (when I had really poor service), the general manager from the restaurant contacted me and was very engaged, he changed a very negative experience to a positive one with helpful customer service. I was impressed by his follow through and interest in making a difference with a pissed off customer.  Today my family and I went back to the La Mesa location and the food and service were both excellent. The calamari rocks as do the avocado eggrolls! And Lyndsy our server was great! Thank you and we will be back."
Kathrine B.,"La Mesa, CA",0,1,,5.0,10/3/2017,"My roommate and I went for a late night food run after I just out of my night class and he just got out home from work. We went to Bj's because it was close to us and and open late. Our server was Richard and he was absolutely wonderful! He was real with us from the start, gave us his honest opinion when asked about drinks and certain food items. The food come out amazing! The presentation was great and the taste was even better."
Kent-Janice J.,"El Cajon, CA",21,7,,4.0,9/26/2017,"Always enjoying going here.  Great brews and appetizers (which we enjoy when having a beer).  However, at our last visit, we were disappointed to learn that the flat bread, our favorite, is no long on happy hour.  It has been substituted with pizza, which we don't eat.  (We prefer the more healthy choice.)  But Happy hour continues to be a great value plus extended hours. We enjoy the bar/pub area. Always fortunate to find a spot (no wait) but it is popular and busy.  (Which says something for the business!) Have been in the restaurant area only once but it, too, was good."
Menzil A.,"San Diego, CA",0,3,,1.0,11/28/2017,actually 1 star is too much for this particular place. i regret for coming here. staff and manager sucks.
T R.,"San Diego, CA",0,56,11,5.0,9/6/2017,I love this place.  My husband and I moved here from the Bay Area recently and we have gone to this place almost every week.  The food is so good and the wait staff is amazing. Everyone that has waited on us has been very friendly and accommodating. I've made a lot of requests to have this replaced in my dish for that and it's never been a problem.  They do it with a friendly smile. We have also ordered take out and it's been really good.  The prices for the all day deals are great!   1/2 off large pizzas every Monday all day. Can't beat that.   I'll be going back as I have been. We can't get enough of this place and all the friendly folks working there!
Sonny B.,"San Diego, CA",31,3,1,1.0,6/14/2016,Normally I'm a huge BJs fan...but this was the worst experience I have ever had here. All I wanted was some clam chowder and and a Pizookie. About 20 minutes after I ordered the clam chowder the manager came out and told me that it would be at least 30 minutes because the clam chowder was still frozen. I told him to forget it. I ordered my usually white chocolate macadamia nut Pizookie. When it came out it had some crappy regular vanilla ice cream not the yummy vanilla bean ice cream it usually comes with. I usually eat a whole Pizookie in about 5 minutes but I only ate three bites of this one and that's it.  Truly disappointing to say the least...
Lizabeth G.,"San Diego, CA",1,18,2,5.0,8/28/2017,PEOPLE ARE CRAZY if they're leaving a bad review for this location. I literally have been to multiple locations and the customer service and food is ALWAYS best here. I will drive the extra 30 min just for this one. It's that great.
Ali B.,"Valencia Park, San Diego, CA",1746,526,4594,3.0,10/24/2015,"Today was a treat coming to BJ's.  I haven't been here in a few years so I was excited to try it again.  The restaurant was clean and decorated nicely.   We were greeted when we entered but had to wait a minute or so before anyone came to seat us.   Once seated the waitress (she didn't give us her name) was quick to take our drink order.  I tried the ""Skinny Margarita"" and my husband ordered BJ's Brewhouse Blonde beer.   The margarita was a little on the sweet side but still very good.  My husband enjoyed his beer. The menu has a variety of options:  various pizza dishes, sandwiches, salads and I noticed a breakfast menu, desserts and more.  I chose the Tavern Cut Italian Market Pizza and my husband ordered the Gourmet Five Meat Pizza.    My pizza was so good it had a thin crushed Italian herb, five cheese blend crust  and it was loaded with the house made meatballs, diced pepperoni, ham and peperoncinis. I didn't sample my husband's pizza but it looked amazing and it was loaded with the house made meatballs, pepperoni, oven roasted ham, smoked bacon, Italian sausage and Parmesan cheese.   Sad to say that our waitress performance was a three star:  it was lunch time and the restaurant was busy but our services could have been better.  We had asked her for the pepper and parmesan cheese shakers and she never brought them to us (we finally asked another waitress who passed our table).  She also took her own sweet time to bring my husband a ""to go"" box for his pizza.  The food and atmosphere was great but the service was poor."
Marcella H.,"Lemon Grove, CA",0,1,2,2.0,9/17/2017,"I was at BJ 's with friends and two of us ordered the burger with barbecue brisket. It took a while for our order to come. When it got to our table it looked NOTHING like the picture. It was a burger all right but we had little bits of brisket(?) sprinkled on our burger and a little barbecue sauce mixed in that. We looked for our waitress and couldn't find her so we flagged one from another section and she was apologetic and offered to get us more brisket and barbecue sauce. We waited and when it arrived it was more brisket scraps that barely covered the bottom of the bowl and that was supposed to be enough for two people. We divided our brisket crumbs and used the warm barbecue sauce to save our cold burgers. The burger itself was good but you could barely taste the meat. Until BJ's is able to do brisket better than Arby's and Jack in the box, they should take that burger off of the menu. The beer was good."
Andria M.,"San Diego, CA",5,4,1,1.0,6/6/2016,"This place deserves 0 stars...  Our mishaps started a few weeks ago I placed 3 orders to go, I got home and one order was missing, drove back and it was STILL the wrong order.. (You may be asking why didn't I check before I left the 2nd time, well the order was for some kind of deep dish lasagna and I got some other red cheesy pasta which looked like lasagna until you but into it). The manager gave us a gift card for 30 dollars for our mishap.. GREAT!!  TONIGHT: i decide to put my gift card to use.. Placed another order to go.. This time i checked everything!!! Bacon and cheese on burgeR .. 2 orders of fries .. 3 main dishes .. I just glanced at the ice cream that came with the pazooki through the lid to make sure it was chocolate and not vanilla (which is my fav dessert of all time) ... Everything is great at home until I eat the ice cream.. First there was a small piece of plastic in one spoonful, I just shook my head and disregarded it cause shit happens I guess (that's the understanding side) but as I kept eating a HUGE PIECE OF PLASTIC WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ice cream.. At this point I'm disgusted.. This is a huge safety issue for small children.. Thank god this happened to me and not a child..  I will not be revisiting this location.. There have been other issues with service but I'm tired of typing.. Be weary going here.. The mission valley location is only 10-15 mins away.. That is where I'll be going to get my beloved pazooki from now on.."
Amanda B.,"Austin, TX",187,79,,3.0,2/8/2017,"Came here starving after a hike. It was a Friday afternoon, and very crowded. We went into the bar for a beer to wait. Eventually got seated out in the covered patio. Our waitress was extremely unknowledgeable, unable to assist with beer selections in a brewhouse. Service was subpar as well, taking a long time in between checking on us, and forgetting condiments and such. All in all, it's a chain restaurant with chain restaurant food. It's good, but there is so much better. Except your pizookie, I love you forever."
autumn m.,"El Cajon, CA",88,6,1,1.0,7/23/2016,"Opened the napkin to eat my cold, dry, hard appetizer, and look....snot? Vomit? The waiter quietly took it away but I decided to let the manager know after they left me and my family sitting in the corner waiting for our check for over 30 minutes. When he came over, he apologized and was embarrassed. He said he would comp our appetizer and dessert. They came out with a complimentary dessert for my husbands birthday. I noticed the receipt had the complimentary dessert amd that price was comped. That was hardly a 'comp' for this disgusting, filthy establishment. I am very disappointed and already have alerted many people about this, they will not come to BJ's either. You can see my picture below"
Sam M.,"San Diego, CA",14,11,8,2.0,5/2/2017,"Always enjoyed BJs. First time at the Grossmont location. Wife ordered blt salad. Came missing the blue cheese and tomatoes. And hardly any lettuce. She normally gets this. She was disappointed. They did remake it and it was much better. Waitress asked my son, do you want wedge fries or regular. Asked for wedges. Food came, wrong fries , plus they were room temperature. Waitress took my drink away with still about 1/3 left. Took 5 minutes to get a replacement. This is not typical bjs service . . . Maybe just this location. By the way, I got the soup and salad. VERY GOOD chile."
Sam G.,"El Cajon, CA",4,33,5,2.0,6/11/2016,Lovely food and atmosphere but lousy service. I  choked before I got someone to get me some water. It felt as if we were in the middle of the desert  I forgot to mention my wife's pasta came cold from the fridge :(
DC D.,"El Cajon, CA",1,10,,4.0,4/26/2017,They have a wide variety of food and the service is always good. I would have given them five stars except their beers are always warm or room temperature at best. *Had to make it a four just on responsiveness alone. That is service. I'll change it to a five if the beer is cold next time. I appreciate the quick response... caring goes along way.
