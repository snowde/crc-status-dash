S N.,"El Cajon, CA",2,8,,2.0,7/23/2014,"I'm surprised at all the great reviews. Potato skins tasted like they had been reheated, greasy sloppy mess. The corn fritter taste was good, after wet picked off the burnt edges...to be honest I loved BJs food before their ""new and improved"" menu. Quality had taken a dive."
Patty O.,"La Mesa, CA",0,9,,5.0,11/4/2015,I would like to compliment a waitress that we recently had.  Her name is Caitlyn and she worked the outdoor area.  She was so pleasant and kind and was very helpful to my friend and me.  She did an amazing job and I hope we get her next time.
Sarah L.,"El Cajon, CA",26,15,,5.0,7/19/2015,"Allie was the mvp of today! She was very attentive to ours needs even though the place was so crowded! She made sure we were well taken care of and answered every request with a smile and a ""my pleasure!"" Way to go Allie! You will definitely be requested next time!"
Brian C.,"San Diego, CA",5,154,81,2.0,5/19/2012,"After reading the other reviews, yes, It was just a bit loud on a Saturday at 6:30pm but not bad. By the time we left around 8:30 it was absolutely packed with a waiting line & very noisy. Our waiter was not particularly friendly, he didn't want to be working or something. Totally corporate, perfunctory service. The wait for dessert was very very very long. Skip the blue cheese wedge salad, it was lame. Skip the steamed veggies, tasteless frozen bagged stuff with no seasoning. Strip steak, ribeye & salmon were just not memorable. 4 people, 4 entrees, 2 beers, 1 wine, 1 soda, no apps, $133.00 with tax & tip. Should have done the food court."
Janelle M.,"San Diego, CA",142,97,42,1.0,12/20/2011,"I have been a long-time fan of BJ's.  The pizza, the pizzooki, the salads... all incredible.  So when it  came time to plan our company Christmas party, I thought of them.  This location has a big covered patio attached to it where private parties are usually seated...perfect.  So I sent my bosses over there for lunch to try the food and to get a feel for the place.  The manager was very nice and accomodating.  He said we could have the patio for our party which was to take place on a Monday night.  We planned to do it buffet style with pizza, pasta, and salad.   I called back a couple days later to give them our food selections and they had no record of our reservation... (Red Flag #1).  So we re-reserved and submitted our order.   On the day of the event, I called to check that we were still on and that everything was okay.  They assured us our party of 20 on the patio was reserved and we were set. When we got to the restaurant, the patio was packed with a different party.  (LAME.)  The put us in 3 tables lined against a wall in a tight space.  Not buffet style.  The food was supposed to be out and ready when we got there.  It took about 15 minutes for our pizzas to show.  And each table got one of the 4 pizzas we ordered.  So even though there was a big variety of pizzas and pastas and salad, none of us got to try anything but what was set in front of us...  bummer. The food was good.  But it was supposed to be unlimited everything.  Mind you for the buffet group price, you pay about $18.  The pizzas were eaten and not replaced with new ones even though we asked.  It was disappointing.  I know they were busy.  But we didn't have a dedicated server.  We definitely won't bring a large group back here again. The Pro's:  - Good food - Clean restroom The Con's: - Unprofessional management (lost reservation, seating area given away...) - No server - Service was REALLY lacking - Charged hefty price per head for service they did not provide and that was not bottomless/refillable, as advertised. Summary: Good for a night out, NOT good for big groups."
Jessica L.,"San Diego, CA",0,37,3,4.0,9/20/2015,This place has delicious pizza! I always get the BJs Favorite. The servers are hit or miss. Most are outstanding. Some seem like they just don't want to be there. There usually isn't a wait. It is noisy inside. The parking can be tough.
Erin B.,"San Diego, CA",185,27,,4.0,7/19/2012,"My boyfriend and I go here frequently for their Jeremiah  red and wild berry mojitos. The dishes here are delicious and you can't go here and not order a pizookie!  As for the service, it seems pretty consistent. The servers are pretty good at filling up your drinks and taking away plate but there have been a few times at this location that I've had a server completely forget my order entirely."
Kaitlyn L.,"San Diego, CA",77,46,38,5.0,6/15/2014,"I love BJ's!!! The food is always spectacular. On my last visit, however, they not only messed up on my pizza once, but twice!! I wasn't even the slightest bit upset, but the staff, managers included, were extremely apologetic, gave me both pizzas for free (which were delicious, by the way) a free pazookie, AND a $25 gift card to come back. I know this was a kitchen mistake, but the staff was extremely polite about it, and their service impressed my family and I. My fiancé and I are going back this evening and I'm already trying to decide what I want to order :)"
Lisa S.,"El Cajon, CA",74,12,2,2.0,7/30/2014,"This location is for dining in only.  I had dinner there one time, and the deep  dish pizza was superb.  I have ordered it three times since, to go. Two out of three seriously lacked.  The first time was ok. Just ok. Nothing to complain about, but no bragging rights. The second time, I ordered deep dish and got the wrong pan type pizza, and it sucked.  I complained and was given a courtesy card, with $20 on it.  I used that card tonight and received a deep dish pizza, as ordered.  It was, however, doughy, tough, and not cut all the way through. Not a good time. And this will be the last time I order take out from this location. I could do better with a meat  lovers pizza from Pizza Hut."
Laura T.,"San Diego, CA",138,188,120,3.0,4/24/2014,"Sit on the heated patio, it's delightful! I love BJ's! I love that they serve Mt. Dew, I love that they have ooey gooey pizookies, I love the potato soup and the chicken alfredo baked potatoes, however, I do not love the poor service we received on the night of March 28th. We brought our friend here for her birthday. She is here from Inner Mongolia learning English, and likes to try new places. We brought her here because she wanted pizza, but we knew the menu has lots of options in case she changed her mind. I told the hostess it was this young lady's 17th birthday and she said she'd ""be sure to tell our server"". We sat for a short while before our server came up and introduced himself. He took our drink order and offered us appetizers, and as he left the table we noticed the table next to us who had been sitting since before we had, and they got his attention. They told him they had not yet been helped, to which he responded, ""I don't know who your server is, but I can help you"". To me that was a good attitude, not looking to place blame somewhere and not trying to pass the buck, but seeing an opportunity to make another tip and hopefully salvage this couple's experience. We received our drinks and ordered some appetizers and dinner. He checked on us once while we were eating the appetizers, but we didn't see him again until he brought us the bill. A nice young lady brought us our pizzas and unfortunately, our young birthday friend likes ketchup for her pizza, which we didn't know when ordering or we would have asked for it when we ordered. Anyhow, not one single person came to check on us while we were eating so she ended up eating half of her pizza but was displeased. My drink had been empty since our dinner was delivered and I was hoping for at least one refill. Our server offered us to go boxes and dessert, but we declined, because by that point there was no salvaging the night for any of us. Needless to say, the hostess did not tell the server we had a birthday girl, the server did not make sure our meal was tasty and complete, and BJ's moved from the top of our ""Let's go there for dinner tonight!"" list, to about mid-way down. The parking can be a real bear, especially on a Friday night, the wait can be long, unless the heated patio has availability, and the trouble is not really worth it when I'm paying to have dinner service but being ignored.  We are not the only ones who left disappointed that night, as the couple who was sitting next to us and had no server for a while would also attest. I'm going to go out on a limb and guess the not so strong service staff works the patio in anticipation that not many people will want to sit out there. Maybe not, but that's certainly the way it felt that night. BJ's is normally quite tasty, and the service is normally pretty good, both reasons why this review got 3 stars instead of the 2 it actually deserved."
Andrea T.,"Lemon Grove, San Diego, CA",73,21,4,1.0,2/20/2014,Went there for lunch the other day and although it was not crowded we had to wait awhile for a table. Ordered the fish tacos and a chicken strips lunch. Haven't seen food like that since lunch break at high school. The meal was so bad we complained and ordered a pizza instead. That was moderately better but still not any better than cafeteria food. Not going back any time soon.
Brian B.,"Tulsa, OK",86,171,,3.0,7/15/2012,"This was a pretty good bar/restaurant. The beer sampling was great.  Also try the calamari rings, it was a great appetizer.  I just wish it had true bar hours and didn't close at midnight. The TV set-up is great for any sports fan.  If you want to watch the game I'd stop in here."
Angie Q.,"Rolando, San Diego, CA",0,6,,2.0,3/1/2014,The service sucks here! It's takes about an hour just to get food... And the waiters and waitress suck
Mary W.,"San Diego, CA",45,79,,3.0,3/14/2012,"As a chain restaurant I should give BJ's more credit. But for me, the pizza was crummy, had small portions and wasn't all that reasonably priced. The beer selection is decent, but the restaurant itself is really small, so a group of more than 5 will feel really cramped. Also due to the size BJ's is really really loud (like bar loud), which makes you almost have to shout to chat with those you are eating with. Staff was friendly and helpful, which was lovely, but I couldn't get over the food."
Greg M.,"El Cajon, San Diego, CA",1,14,9,4.0,2/4/2014,"My family and I frequent BJs often. Mainly the location in La Mesa at Grossmont Center. I have sampled many menu items over time, none of which have ever disappointed. My personal favorites by far are the margarita Fresca flat bread style pizza ( a light bite ) they also make a very tasty Ribeye and Sirloin Steak!! Our regular waiters are efficient, fast and very friendly. BJs has been a great place to frequent since my first visit in La Jolla in 1986"
Kaylee H.,"San Diego, CA",21,188,41,4.0,5/12/2012,"No matter what happens at this place, it can be ear-shatteringly loud, I may have to circle the parking lot for an hour and wait for another 45 minutes for a table, if they keep the Parmesan crusted chicken on the menu I will keep returning, drooling like Pavlov's dog. God this thing is awesome.  I tried to recreate it at home but the Parmesan crust all fell off.  You get two pounded chicken breasts with a dark crust of Parmesan cheese, a dollop of super yummy mashed potatoes, and yummy steamed broccoli (I LOVE broccoli).  I don't like huge portions, and this is just enough.  I leave feeling full, but not as if I want to barf.  Perfect. I get the complaints about the noise level, the parking issues, the wait, etc.  I do get it.  But come on, I would practically walk through cut glass on my eyelids for this stuff.  It is that good. Must have more, NOW. PS-Minus one start because I think the glasses of beer are a tad stingy, but then I'm also addicted to wheat beer.  And the servers don't serve it with the required lemon slice.  Come on people!"
Isaias A.,"San Diego, CA",0,6,1,1.0,9/21/2014,Do not order for take out! My wife ordered a simple deep dish pizza and they told her it would be ready in 20 minutes. She arrived 10 minutes after the time they told her it would be ready just so she knew it would be ready to go by the time she arrived. They made her wait another 30 minutes taking a total time of an hour just waiting for a simple order to be ready. Busy or not they shouldn't tell you your order will be ready and have you wait half an hour while everyone else is picking up orders .
Barrett V.,"La Mesa, CA",0,2,,1.0,8/4/2015,"False advertising of delivery. Every time you try to order delivery, they say they don't have a driver."
Jeff S.,"San Diego, CA",521,691,896,4.0,11/7/2011,"I am a huge fan and always end up going here.  They have a great menu and excellent staff.  I don't think there has ever been a time where I have been disappointed by the staff, they are always helpful and friendly.  Their pizzas and burgers are excellent and I've tried several other items from the menu and am yet to be disappointed.  I'm not a big beer drinker but I gave their pumpkin ale a shot and it was pretty good, solid beer taste with a little hint of pumpkin.  The place can get busy and loud during sporting events so be prepared if you decide to go when there is a game on.  This place is definitely one of my ""go to"" restaurants."
Rachel L.,"San Diego, CA",79,38,5,4.0,9/5/2011,"Decided to grab some lunch with friends in Grossmont Center. I am not a big fan of chain restaurants, but when in Rome... Had great service by a waitress named Summer. She was so sweet and attentive. She kept the refills coming and had a great positive attitude. I always stick with the BBQ Chicken salad and it never disappoints."
