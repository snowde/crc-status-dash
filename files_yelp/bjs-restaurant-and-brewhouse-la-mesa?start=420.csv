Sarah C.,"San Diego, CA",47,81,11,1.0,8/4/2013,"Ok so I have been here twice. It was recommended by a co-worker of mine. 1st time was ok nothing special. Food wasn't even that good. But the second time I went last night was what did me in.  My bf and I brought our friends along with us. his homeboy my homegirl. We decided to treat them out for the night. So we were seated down at a table very fast which was nice because it was packed. Had a great waitress to begin with until she went on break and we got a new one. Her name was and yes I WILL  name her in the review Carolyn. She was not as friendly or nice or sweet as the waitress we had when we first got there and ordered our appitizers with. I felt a not so good vibe off of her. I had asked to change my order in a good enough amount of time they said even after I told them it's not a problem if you can't or it's to late. First waitress said it's totally fine and she would make sure they changed it. Well the waitress CAROLYN had a major additude about it and for the rest of our night. We finally ordered desert and it just happened to be my boyfriends bf so he got a free one well Carolyn brought it right out and then left and then came back 10 mins later to tell me they didn't have the Binet I craved for about a half hour. 10 MINS LATER after bringing my man his!!!!! I jokingly said to my bf that she was making it up bc I changed my order and I could tell she wasn't happy about it even tho it didn't affect her in the slightest. She wasn't around when I said it so I know she didn't hear me bc no1 else at the table did either. so we were there probablly for a few couple of hours laughing talking enjoying our dinner. then she brought us our check and then we looked at it she left right as I was trying to tell her we needed 2 checks because one was paying cash and the other card. So she comes back 20 mins later we then explained that we needed two but we understand that it wasn't her fault because the first server didn't tell her that. Then she comes back 20 more mins later to give us the checks 2 seprate ones leaves the table comes back and takes my card for mine and my friends and my bf's $100 bill for his check for him and his friends dinner.  So I just happened to look at the suggested Gratuity b4 she put them into seperate checks which was 12 comething. We got our change back and my card i signed and my bf left her a 13 dollar cash tip for both of our checks. ONLY to find out this morning on my account was BOTH charges!!!!! So not only did she pocket the 48 dollars. But my card was charged twice and I was never told about this.  I called the manager this morning very upset and after having me on hold for 20 mins while he looked it up saying his system went down(Trick they use to get people to calm down) he apologized and said he takes full respoinibility for her F up! I told him why are you taking the responsibility she fed everything up. He then told me well she probablly just did everything on 1 card as 1 bill I told him NO bc then I wouldn't have 2 charges and then he told me the charge was reversed right away.SO THEN WHY THE HELL DIDN'T SHE TELL ME SHE MADE A MISTAKE SHE WAS GONE FOR LONGER THEN 10 MINS WITH MY CARD!!! i also told him well thats not true bc my card doesn't reflect that, I still have 48 dollars missing out of my account!!!!!! Then he asked was it a debit card I said yes but so what he then proceeded to tell me well the bank must be holding it and they will deicde when you get it back. He did say this should have never happened and then reiterrated that he takes full responisibility which made me even more mad! WHY THE HELL isn't CAROLYN BEING HELD ACCOUNTIBABLE!!! An why isn't anything being done for my troubles!!! That means I have to do all this work for something that wasn't my fault! They have until Tuesday to give me my money back shoot I might even go back there 2mrow night and raise hell bc everyone I have talked to says that my order should have been comp'd for all of this trouble and I know it should have been I WORK IN HOSPITALITY! Bottom line is they really don't give a crap about thier customers and they let thier employees treat them like crap. I will be filling a lawsuit if I have to!"
D W.,"San Diego, CA",1,91,,2.0,12/2/2012,"I want to like this place but have had more than one negative experience.  The location is very convenient bit not particularly cool. The bar is cool though and has lots of sport-watching cache.  The menu is American-eatery standard so doesn't get any points for creativity.  The burger looked good and i'm a stickler there. But, i had some fish tacos that tasted like the grease they used to fry them was found in King Tut's tomb. On another occasion, the waitress gave me someone else's bill twice and tried to charge me $1 extra per instead of the already outrageous $6.00 (during happy hour no less).  So, they just don't measure up."
ashley b.,"San Diego, CA",374,3,,1.0,7/8/2013,"I seriously HATE THIS PLACE. The ""chef"" is a complete douche bag. Hate to resort to name calling but there really is no better way to explain him. I have given this place several chances and every time is worst than the last. The experiences that stick out the most are as follows.  1- a few friends and I went out for dinner out food was ok at best but what made this time stick out was the fact that my vegetarian friend asked for the veggie burger and got a regular Burger, then she sent it back, after sending it back she got a cold veggie burger with an unmelted slice of cheese, we asked to speak to a manger and that's when the ""chef"" came over and just kinda rolled his eyes. And had then sent it back. My friend had been her quit a few times like me trying to give it a chance and she has worst story's. so she told him that this was not the first time she had something like this happen that's why he told her well if you keep getting BAD service don't come back. The kicker, she got her burger after the second send back and all they did was throw another piece of cheese on it. Wtf 2- my same friend actually was dumb enough to have her fiancé's birthday here. Well needless to say after telling us they didn't have room for us indoors they would manage something outdoors but we had to wait..... Ummmmm she had set reservations in advance. Don't act like you didn't know we were coming. Well we had a few guest that had to feel like outsiders because they had to sit at a completly separate table away from the group. Then after putting us outdoor on a cold day they said they would turn the heat on. Gee thanks. Well when we ordered our food  and the people who were isolated ended up never getting their food when we asked about it the waitress said she forgot to order it.... So I was very upset about this I asked to speak to the manager again and again he was a douche. And after lots of arguing with this guy he gave them there dinner HALF off. Seriously none if them even ate their food because we were all done by then and actually still sitting and waiting for their food to arrive so they just had it packe to go.  3- the straw that broke the camels back. So my family and I went in one day and we have an elderly grandmother (97) who is very picky about her food. Well all she asked was to not have mushrooms in her dinner. They server said he would take care of that. But when our food returned there were mushrooms. We asked about it and he said rolling his eyes well the chef said he is not rooming them so she is gonna have to herself. I was so shocked seeing how I was in the food industry and ya I have felt with my fair share of egotistical chefs and have been given this line before... They don't are about your tip... But guess what I cared about my tips and my clients being happy so I would take all the mushrooms out myself. Needless to say I'm sure that chef was the same dough bag as before.  So you ask why I have been so many time?!? Ok the food ok when it's made right or you get it. And I honestly thought I would for once have a decent dinner here.... Nope.  Also I think the servers are all just overwhelmed, they are understaffed and not trained well. And that chef is the worst. I'm sure that he is hell to work for and this is probably why all the servers look so overwhelmed and undertrained because they don't care to learn bc try hate their boss. I hate this place and even worst HATE THIS CHEF. sorry guy your not that cute and you work at Bjs no need to have such a big head.  Your not down town or anything or at Mr.A's so don't act like it."
Julie B.,"San Diego, CA",0,9,,4.0,12/28/2013,"Our family loves BJ's, and as a gluten-sensitive diner, I enjoy the number of choices I have on the menu. We've eaten there a number of times now. Service is always excellent. The food is very good, the only problem we've had is that it has come out cold or lukewarm, especially the french fries, but when told about this the waiter took care of it, and the fries hot out of the fryer are great. The chicken al fresco was awesome. Definitely recommend."
Pro Cut Tree Service P.,"San Diego, CA",0,24,20,5.0,4/20/2014,"Service was slow at first, but picked up after I was seated. The unlimited soup and salad was good and my server was pretty good. The outside arrangement is nice during a nice sunny day."
Leticia B.,"Descanso, CA",6,104,7,1.0,2/9/2014,"I went there today about five hours ago. Ordered the shrimp tacos and they were so so ok. But now, I'm having an epic case of the runs!. Oh my goodness, drinking lots of liquids. I'll just have to s#it out.  No more BJ'S for me, never again."
Yaya S.,"Rolando, San Diego, CA",18,20,37,5.0,3/16/2014,"I love this place, food is always great. Service is great.. And if u ever want to place an order for pick they do it. You can place your order online, plus they have pick up designated  parking."
James B.,"Santee, San Diego, CA",8,25,5,1.0,1/4/2014,Although they have updated their menu the food is still lacking! Ordered a kids cheese pizza and it was not edible. Appetizer was decent and the hand tossed pizza was ok. Staff was friendly and we were not charged for the kids meal. I am not sure why this place struggles with quality control but I don't think we will be back.
Pam B.,"El Cajon, CA",5,169,27,4.0,6/5/2012,"My husband I and really enjoy BJ's pizza's.  The beer is tasty and a good compliment to the pizza.  The quality of their salads can vary widely and that is disappointing.  Usually there are pleasant and efficient waiters,  but occasionally they become too busy and you are ignored for drink refills."
Savannah S.,"El Cajon, CA",0,2,1,1.0,1/8/2015,"Had the absolute worst experience here last Wednesday night. Mind you, a friend and I came in around 10 on a Wednesday night which is usually pretty late but we had just gotten off of work and were hungry. We got greeted by a host right away and asked if we were wanting to sit in the dining area or the bar area since it was happy hour. We decided to sit in the bar area with probably one or two other tables. Before sitting down I walked to the restroom and noticed there was hardly anyone in the dining area as well. After about 10 minutes of waiting we were introduced to our server (really wish I would have remembered his name) and he took our drink orders. Our drinks arrived promptly and although we were ready to order, he rushed away quickly and was not to be seen for another 15 minutes. When he finally arrived back he asked if we were ready and we ordered. My friend and I both ordered a side wedge salad (with a side of balsamic vinegarette and asked if we could have the salad chopped in the back, which they usually do without a problem) , nachos which were on the happy hour menu, and a medium pizza with pesto, sundried tomatoes, garlic and basil. About another 15 minutes went by and another waiter dropped off our salads. They were not chopped and we didn't receive any balsamic vinegeratte as well. It took about 10 more minutes to find someone (not our waiter who was nowhere to be seen) and asked if we could have a side of dressing and some silverware. He brought them quickly and we began eating the salads. Five more minutes passed by and the same guy dropped off our nachos. They were NOT appetizing at all, it was mostly more of a bean dip and after two or three bites we both gave up and decided to just wait for the pizza. Another 15 minutes later... our pizza arrived and we noticed that instead of basil and sundried tomatoes, they instead put pepperoncinis and artichoke hearts. Luckily, being as hungry as we both were we ignored the fact and dug in. The pizza was probably the highlight of that dinner because it all went downhill from there...  After noticing we were finished, the waiter came back and asked if we were finished and if we wanted to place a dessert. Wanting to get out of there as soon as possible we simply asked for the check. ANOTHER 10 minutes goes by and he drops it off to our table. It came out to be 30 something dollars and I put down a $100 dollar bill. A few minutes later he comes by and says he would be right back with some change. He then drops off the change and tells us to have a good night. By this time, my friend just nodded her head in annoyance to the extremely poor service we had just recieved.. and as I'm counting my money back to myself I realized the change he gave me was short 7 dollars. I could not find the server again for the next 10 minutes so I asked the busboy if he could get him for me. The waiter then comes and says word for word ""okay guys what did I f*** up on now"". By this moment I should have asked to speak to a manager but I was so annoyed and in a rush to leave I just explained to him that he gave me the wrong amount of change back and that he owed me 7 dollars. He then began to tell me that I was wrong and to check it again. He went back and forth from the computer checking the math and then realized that he had ""accidently"" added something to our ticket that was meant for another table. He apologized and said ""so what I owe you like another 5 dollars"". I am in such disbelief that any establishment would allow their employees to be giving this type of service, which seems to be a regular thing as I have read most of the other reviews on here. I myself am a server at a restaurant, and have been for the last 7 years and have never seen anything like this nor would I give any customers a reason to leave me anything less of a 5 star review on yelp. This was just outrageous and you can guarantee I will not be giving this restaurant my business again."
Justin G.,"San Diego, CA",74,635,,4.0,4/2/2014,"I went here for lunch with my girlfriend.  The lunch specials for $7.95 include like two things, so that's a bit misleading.  But I had a good parmesan crusted chicken sandwich that I would definitely get again.  My girlfriend got a flatbread pizza that was ok.  Those were at a decent price, but I definitely got the better meal."
Jeannie H.,"El Cajon, CA",18,26,,4.0,11/30/2011,"I think this is the loudest restaurant I've ever been to.  It's frustrating because I can't have a conversation unless I'm leaning across the table and screaming at my boyfriend.  So, I knock off a star for that.  Also, the waitresses are super nice.  The waitress was trying to have a conversation with me and I was interested, but could only hear half of it because it was so damn loud.   Their pasta is bomb!  They have such a huge selection on their menu.  Definitely check it out, it's always busy for a reason!"
Fredd S.,"Chula Vista, CA",120,71,15,3.0,9/1/2011,"The deceiving name conjures up images of sexual acts, so if you're looking for something along ""those"" lines look somewhere else. Well the waitresses are very cute, so if you're good at that I guess you could give it a shot, if you're not and you actually want to get some food read on. This Bj's is like any other BJ's out there but if I left it at that, this wouldn't be a good review, and if you've never been to BJ's you wouldn't really know anything new. So, I came to this particular BJ's and the hostess was really friendly told me about being so excited to get out (she'd been working for six days in a row) and how she planned to get sauced afterwards lol. The waitress was super awesome and had the food out fairly quickly I ordered the mozzarella and tomato salad and the grilled salmon. The salad was amazing, and the salmon decent, but it felt kind of dry and they white sauce it had on it was super bland as well as the vegetables which were not only bland, but also waaaaaay over cooked. I've had the pizzas, which are pretty decent when you have them with a beer, which their beer selection, although nowhere near magical, is actually nothing to look down at. Next time I come, I'll make sure to order some bar style food like a burger, pizza, wings or even pasta. Stay away from ""complex"" dishes like salmon, which they can't really handle, and make sure to try a beer. You won't regret it. Staff super friendly. Food mehish at best I met a friend of mine for lunch"
Jeff N.,"Alpine, CA",1,52,4,5.0,5/18/2014,"Our group of 12 went after my daughter's graduation from SDSU. Everybody ordered something different, and every order was given great compliments by the one who ordered. I had BJs combo mini pizza, and shared my wife's Atlantic Salmon. Both were superb. Our waiter, Aaron, did a fantastic job of managing our special occasion. Five well-earned stars."
Jim G.,"La Mesa, CA",63,14,1,1.0,9/4/2013,"Deep dish pizza was horrible. Wings were like McNuggets. Mash potatoes were inedible. Salads tasteless. The pizokki thing was nothing special. But at least the service was slow. And yet, it doesn't seem to matter in La Mesa. The place was packed. La Mesa is full of restaurants that are not only bad but aggressively bad. BJs is just another bad La Mesa eatery."
Shawn T.,"La Mesa, CA",16,37,5,5.0,12/25/2014,"I have been eating here for years!! I did go through pizookie rehab about 8 years ago..I haven't had one those crazy delicious desserts in awhile!!  But my most recent experience started off a little rough with the waitress not knowing what I wanted to order...It simply wasn't her fault..I ordered the spaghetti with the meat sauce and a cup of  spicy sauce on the side...She told me they no longer carried the spicy sauce, which I was prepared to hear from a server but I know they could make it... Then she said they couldn't make it..I know, I might run into this problem before I even got to the restaurant...So me and my date decided to leave...:-(..... I guess you wonder why I'm giving this place 5 stars..Well as we were leaving the Manger asked me was everything ok..I explained to her what I wanted, she smiled and said don't worry seat back down we can make that special sauce for you!!!! I was thrilled that we didn't have to go somewhere else!!  I can't remember her name but she was awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Chris T.,"Santa Barbara, CA",1,2,,2.0,7/31/2014,"Sitting in BJs now for 20 minutes waiting for a waiter. This really is lousy service. Not that busy either. Too bad, next time I will try the nearby Hooley's pub for their customer service."
Tracey S.,"El Cajon, CA",2,51,,5.0,6/20/2014,"I love their Pazookies!  They keep changing them and believe it or not they keep coming up with great flavors.  The server Kaitlin St Clair was amazing.  She kept our drinks filled, she was knowledgeable about the menu and just really friendly!  I especially love to go here with large parties.  They are super accommodating to giving you multiple servers if needed."
Shae L.,"Colorado Springs, CO",35,21,3,1.0,6/17/2015,"After waiting 15 minutes for a table we were finally seated. After we were seated no one ever came to our table to take our drink order or food order. After 20 minutes of additional waiting we walked out. We told the hostess person and she just shrugged her shoulders and didn't care. This place has been going down hill this past year. There have been times we go and the place is half empty and they tell us it will be a 15 minute wait.  Really?  When there are at least 10 tables open?  Yet, we still gave them a chance because our kids really like it. Tonight was the final straw though and we will not be returning. Such a shame because we had a ton of rewards points that we won't use now."
Christine F.,"La Mesa, CA",28,17,,4.0,7/9/2013,"I like BJ's very much. I always have a nice waitress who suggests the best dishes. The pizzas are good, thick crusts and doughy. I like the burgers and fries, too. There'a a lot to choose from on the lunch menu that isn't just sandwiches. I would recommend if you've never been. It gets busy in the evenings, so if you want to avoid a wait, go early or for lunch."
