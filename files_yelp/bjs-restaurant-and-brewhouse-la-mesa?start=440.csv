Raven R.,"El Cajon, CA",12,33,6,2.0,11/2/2013,"The food is okay nothing to write home about. Service was okay. The pizookie is okay. Needless to say, I wasn't impressed."
Theresa G.,"La Mesa, CA",78,15,28,4.0,9/16/2011,"My husband and I go her often for dinner and happy hour. We've found that there are so many restaurants out there that are mediocre with only one or two items on the menu that are good. Everything we've had at BJ's has been really good to fantastic and we've tried quite a few items on the menu, pizza, pizzuki, flat bread pizza, salads, pork chops, pot roast, lighter fair and so on. The best time to go if you want pizza is happy hour in the bar area as mini pizza's are 50% off! SO great! Their home made root beer and orange soda's are awesome and I never get any other sodas there because of it. If you're going during regular dinner hours with a large group be prepared to wait a bit. If you're going with a smaller group at that hour try looking for seats in the bar. It's not always hard to find seats right away in their and you can eat from the full menu. The only other issue is the noise level. It's not always the best place to have great conversations as it can get loud at times. Not for the hard of hearing!"
Lynda R.,"Sonoma, CA",96,102,62,4.0,8/7/2013,"My daughter & I went here for dinner when we first arrived in town.  I had grilled fish tacos and she had chicken marsala & a root beer.  Their root beer is the best!!!  Chicken marsala portion was quite large and very good.  Would definately order again.  Fish tacos were good, but had very little fish. I probably wouldn't order again.  But I'd go to BJ's again.  Service was great.  We sat outside which was really nice."
Terry D.,"Alpine, CA",0,34,7,4.0,4/26/2014,"The food is always good.  The service is usually pretty good.  The only neg experience I had was when we went for my daughters birthday and they told us her pizzookie would be free and then they charged us for it.  I don't mind paying for anything, we always leave a good tip, but it bugged me."
Lauren L.,"La Mesa, CA",0,19,,5.0,12/28/2013,BJ's is a staple dinner restaurant for my family. I also love their lunch specials!
MariGrace B.,"San Diego, CA",61,23,,2.0,4/15/2012,"Very disappointed in my visit to this location of BJ's.  As a chain it is one of my favorite places to eat.  With a menu that can satisfy almost any craving and deserts that are scrumptious, and custom drinks that are killer, what more could one ask for.   How about some decent service?  It started as early as when I was being seated.  I was being seated at a table for 2 - one of the small booths.  There was a section of 4 of them empty, 3 ready to go with silver wear and everything and one that had nothing on it yet and was soaking wet.  The hostess takes me to the wet table.  I mentioned that it was extremely wet and she just said, well yes they just cleared it.  I did not sit and with a sigh she said would you rather sit here.  I cordially said yes.   At first the server seemed pleasant and decent, but then it seemed things were taking a really long time.  He had to be asked for refills of the non-alcoholic beverages and this wasn't only at our table.  The one next to us was out of water and he stopped by both tables and never bothered to fill any water or bring more pop without being expressly stopped and asked.   Also he completely missed one of the items we ordered, and never brought the lemon for my water.   Then there is the quality of the food.  I have never had an issue with BJ's before.  It has always been great.  The avocado egg rolls were as they normally are - yummy.  But then came my Fresh Mozzarella and Tomato salad.  The balsamic on the plate was crusted and dry - seeming as though the salad had been out for a long time.  Also there was a lot of some thin liquid all over the plate - I believe it may have been tomato juice, but not positive.  Next came the pizza, a mini cheese and tomato.  Normally this is my absolute favorite item,  This time it came with one clump of tomatoes directly in the center of the pizza, and not a lot of cheese.  I had to spread the tomatoes out myself, and their texture seemed a little off.  My friend said her salad was good. Then we ordered desert, which took forever to get out of the kitchen, but the runner who brought it was very pleasant and was joking with us.  We had a few bites, but were pretty well stuffed so for the most part we left it.   Overall this is probably my worst experience at a BJ's.  Had I not been to other locations previously I would be inclined to never eat any of them again.  I certainly will not return to this location.  Very disappointing."
Tee P.,"San Diego, CA",122,80,42,4.0,12/4/2013,Our waiter A.K.A Eddie made a horrible trip to turn out good!! I hope you go far with your lyric's cause somebody need's to sign you!!!
Desi N.,"San Diego, CA",64,351,10,2.0,7/30/2013,"The service was great, the wait staff were professional however, the food was simply OK."
Amy D.,"San Diego, CA",105,158,5,2.0,3/14/2013,"wednesday night dinner. about 16 of us. we're an easy going crowd. we know service isn't going to be lickety split lightening fast.  appetizers and dinners were actually brought out pretty quick. or maybe we were just enjoying each others company and time escaped us. food was good. no complaints there.  let the complaints begin here! our waitress was obviously flustered. who wouldn't be with a large group? a couple asked for some lemons and she asked if they could share the lemons that another couple was using. i (jokingly) said that the gal had licked all of them. she glared at me and proceeded to get couple #2 their own lemons (which should have been done in the first place) and said to me, ""don't lick them all.""  someone was bumped in the head with a plate with no apology and another person had their plate of food slammed down in front of them. the waitress was overheard saying how much she hated this place while walking away from our table.  on the up side, only 1 person had their food entirely forgotten and it was comped for her. also we each received individual checks without the mandatory 18% tip added in for large parties (they no longer do that). and thank goodness because she didn't deserve 18%!!!  all in all the food was good and the service was not."
Amy B.,"Lemon Grove, CA",14,9,29,4.0,3/16/2014,Friendly service.  Good food. Moderate price. Kid friendly.  Quick waiting time to be seated.
Lisa B.,"San Diego, CA",0,7,,1.0,10/22/2013,"Rude service! We've been at this place few times and it was decent, nothing special, but the last couple of times we had horrible experience with the food and service! We asked for those bread rolls they offer with dinner on both of our last visits and we never got them even though we asked the waiter for them few times but he just ignored us. The pizza was cold and the soup was horrible! We're never going back again."
Croccifixio D.,"San Diego, CA",5,5,1,3.0,4/26/2011,This place has a decent atmosphere usually young college types entertaining their dates on the cheap. Their menu items are moderately priced and the food is okay. Nothing spectacular but if you don't have deep pockets and you don't wanna seem cheap BJ's is a good option. The servers can be hit or miss a lot of times though which has been my gripe with this place. One day I will get outstanding service and the next day I get crappy service. Too many girls and guys trying to be cool and talk to their friends on the job. Beyond that if you get a good server it is a decent place to take a date.
Luckey D.,"La Mesa, CA",2,58,15,2.0,5/1/2012,"Hubby and I went with my Aunt and her 3 grandkids as a thank you for doing some work for her.  We got there a few minutes after them and they had already been seated.  We asked the hostesses if a woman had come in with twins and a girl and they had no idea but let us walk around and find them (we found them in the second booth from the hostess stand). The family had already ordered the quesadilla appetizer and it was good.  Hubby and I ordered the small size Sweet Pig deep dish to share.  My Aunt ordered the mini vegetable pizza but was brought the small deep dish vegetable pizza because they ran out of dough for the mini (at 5 pm? you can't just pinch dough from the larger size to make a smaller amount?).  But they only charged her the mini size price so that was fair. The kids ordered from the kids menu--ribs with fries and extra fries, Mac & Cheese (which I swear was just blue box Kraft) and chicken tenders. My aunt didn't want the kids to have dessert but offered to pay for my husband and I to have one.  We tried to explain this to the waiter but he didn't grasp the concept of adding it to the bill but serving it after they left. So, about our server...I wish I could tell you his name but they don't wear nametags--he had a faux hawk and light brown hair.  They also don't write down orders.  While it's impressive to remember larger orders I find it unnecessary in a casual place like BJ's and actually just more annoying for the servers to have to remember all that stuff.  Our server got our orders right but presented my aunt with the wrong, $20 higher, bill.  He corrected it and said ""I think you'll like this total much better"" but he forgot to include the dessert we wanted and my aunt ended up giving us $5 cash. I asked the server for a menu to pick our Pizookie and it took forever to get a menu.  Then we saw the calorie count on the Pizookie (1,000-ish calories depending on flavor) and said forget it!  We took our $5 to See's and got a few pieces of candy to last a few days instead of having to ingest and extra 500 calories each at one sitting."
Will H.,"Ramona, CA",43,80,,4.0,2/10/2015,"Been here a dozen times, food is always great. But when it gets super busy like it usually does on the weekends, you sometimes get forgotten or drinks dont get refilled at a timely manor. We always call and get on the wait list, before we go in. It seems like it helps but sometimes it feels like you pushed to the end of the line, while people who walk in get called first. Pizza is my fav and the wings. Beers are always good and they have different beers on tap as well. Def coming back."
Kara M.,"San Diego, CA",6,43,,4.0,4/19/2011,"Two words that come to mind when I think BJs: PIZZA and PIZOOKIE! The pizza is my favorite thing to order. I prefer the vegetarian pizza and the field of greens salad. The field of greens salad is so fresh and delicious, it comes with greens (obviously), candied walnuts, bleu cheese, and fruit. So good! And of course, the pizookie is to die for! Chocolate chip is my favorite, it just seems to melt in your mouth more than the other kinds. If you have a huge party of 6 or more, get the party size pizookie...it's HUGE and very delicious! :)"
Jeff H.,"Parker, CO",2,40,2,4.0,9/16/2013,"Stopped by tonight and had a very good dinner.  We tried the black and bleu burger and Hawaiian mahi mahi.  Both entrees were very tasty with the clear winner the mahi mahi.  I would return just for the mahi mahi.  Minus one star just because the service seems slow, however they made up for that with the friendliness of everyone we encountered.  Minus one star for how freaking loud it is in there.  WHAT???  I can't hear you.  Why in the world is this place so much louder than anywhere else?"
Kurt D.,"Livermore, CA",221,124,140,3.0,7/11/2014,"Good in house brews, Jeremiah Red is the go to, also decent seasonal selection. Pizza isn't Phenomenal, but not bad either. Parking kinda sucks at this location on weekends."
Ronnie S.,"El Cajon, CA",61,87,106,5.0,6/2/2011,"Oh BJs how I love to me some.  BJs Restaurant is bodacious. the food rules, and they have great soups, avocado egg rolls have the ability to make you orgasm. one of my favorite things about this place is the beer. try the Jeremiah red. you can now buy kegs of bj beer and six packs. if your felling saucy try a Irish root beer"
Steven R.,"El Cajon, CA",0,11,,2.0,6/5/2015,"Have tried this place 3 times. Each visit has always been a relatively long wait.. Wide selection of food on the menu. All 3 times food has been OK. By no means bad, but I always wonder why such a long wait to get in. I'd probably go back if we can't decide on a place to go because of the variety on the menu, but definitely not if there is a long wait."
jennifer j.,"Santee, CA",4,20,2,2.0,4/17/2011,"So... here's the thing I have loved BJ's since it opened here at Grossmont Center.  I love their beers, their Berry Cider (enjoyed the Linde-Berry), their apps, and Pizookies.  BUT I can't tolerate the poor service anymore. Tonight we got there and were seated by 6:15pm - we didn't have to wait for a table.  Part of our food didn't get to our table until 7:34pm - we had to ask for the rest of it, and the salad came out wrong.   I'm trying to figure out what part of our order was the hardest - or did our waitress not put our order in for a half hour+ after she took it? Here's our order: 2 root beers 2 kid's milk 1 Calamari 2 kid's mac & cheese with applesauce 1 small Mediterranean pizza 1 wedge salad (minus onions w/ranch instead of blue cheese) 1 small bowl of chili I give it two stars for the delicious food.  No stars for service.  We sat there for an hour after ordering with our two kiddos who are very well mannered, but were incredibly hungry and restless after sitting for so long.  We literally tapped our diaper bag for snacks to feed our youngest during the wait.  Our kiddos ate some of the mac & cheese before going to the applesauce... only we had to sit and wait for another 10 minutes for our waitress to pass by our table so we could ask for spoons.  Our waitress never apologized for the wait... and even asked if we saved room for dessert as we were standing from the table in an effort to get our check.  I would've LOVED to have shared a pizookie with the fam... but how long before we would've seen it?  We didn't get our check until after 8pm. This is a place we have enjoyed going to... but the service has taken a sharp decline in recent years.  Our experience tonight wasn't isolated.  We've come here less and less frequently due to the poor service not only with the fam, but also with friends.   Tonight we left so disappointed.  I can not imagine that we will be going back to BJ's in the future."
