Angela A.,"Mid-City, San Diego, CA",314,522,777,5.0,11/1/2011,"I haven't felt the need to review BJ's, I believe that it is has a strong patron following and if it's your sort of place you have been here.  But the other day I ordered something unusual for me and I HAD TO TELL EVERYONE.  I ordered a childhood favorite, tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwich, except this one is made for us older ""kids"".  The Tuscan Tomato Soup and Grilled Ham and Cheese sandwich lunch deal.  HOLY SH** is this good.  The soup is excellent even on it's own.  It is thick in consistency and flavor.  You can see the fresh tomatoes in the soup, it was fabulous.  The sandwich however was over the top.  Why have I never thought to do this.  They take the sandwich and spread a Parmesan cheese mix on the outside before grilling.  So each and every bite is melted cheese inside and crunchy awesomeness on the outside.  This was great, but then you dip it into the soup and OMG can anything get better than this.  I know this is an old time favorite, but this little twist makes it my new favorite comfort food. Other items I love on this menu are any and all of their flat bread pizzas, the avocado spring rolls and their Ahi Poke appetizer, YUMMY. I can't tell you what the main restaurant is like, we always sit in the bar.  It's always quick seating, great service and a quick escape.  If you want to take your food home, get online and place your order, they give you a pick up time and the food is always ready and on point."

Urthelyn D.,"El Cajon, CA",3,5,,3.0,3/7/2014,"The appetizers were good, my Jambalaya was good, my drink could have been stronger, the service was good."
Diana C.,"San Diego, CA",9,75,2,4.0,1/12/2014,"My husband and I are on a diet and we ordered the buffalo burger on the low cal menu section with lettuce instead of the bun.  It was so tasty!  The food came out quickly and our server was nice and attentive even though he had a lot of tables.  We signed up for their loyalty club, because we will be back."
Jeremii B.,"La Mesa, CA",12,28,30,4.0,4/9/2014,"Food and service is average. Some menu items are better than others. Some of my favorites include Crispy Jalapeno Burger, Fried Mahi Mahi Tacos, Jambalaya, Club Sandwhich, or any of their pizza because their pizza's are the best part about the restaurant. For appetizers I think they have the best spinach artichoke dip in San diego, the avocado egg rolls are good, or if you're with a few people try the sampler platter. A lot of their chicken and steak entree's are kinda dry and flavorless. Their bazookies are amazing! BJ's signature beer are mostly all good, and they have a large variety for everybody. One downside is the restaurant can get extremely loud, especially if there's a game on. All around I like this place, i just try and avoid it on big game nights"
Josh And Steph G.,"El Cajon, CA",25,14,,1.0,2/25/2015,"I'll never be back to this location because of one of the managers (Ryan) this guy is a joke of a manager. Myself, wife and 3 kids waited 2 minutes to be seated. Fast right? Then 38 minutes after ordering we got one pizza and chicken tenders. We decided to order dessert. That was a mistake. 24 minutes later I decided to cancel the dessert. The waitress tried to force it on us 5 times before saying okay, then 5 minutes later she still sent out to our table where my wife and kids are no longer sitting. The manager Ryan tells me he took it off the bill, really? We didn't eat it. I then told him how long it took and if he would wait that long? His response ""of course not"" he then told me it was already order and being made but wanted a family to wait 24 minutes? All he kept saying was ""sorry"" 7 times to be exact. That was his response to all. I'm sorry buy you don't manage anything in that kind of manner. I have a shop 6 miles from this location so your not only losing me as a customer but the thousands of customers I take care of will not be recommended to this location ever again."
Nicole T.,"Paso Robles, CA",107,79,23,5.0,3/3/2013,Obsessed with this place I'm a regular! Great service and great food. I always get either a salad or the Great White pizza! Of course I always get a pizookie! MUST GET one of those you will not regret it!
Tien N.,"San Diego, CA",449,362,72,5.0,11/9/2010,To be honest I only used to drink beer as a rite of passage toward manhood shortly after I hit puberty.  Luckily I was 23 at the time so I was legally able to buy AND drink it myself. Since then I've been a recovering beeraholic but when it came to BJ's I just couldn't say no. As the rest of our group ordered samplers I had no choice but to join along and chug and burp along with the rest of them.  Now I don't know what they do at BJ's but each one went down smooth and tasty that even after 8 I had only puked three times. My burger melt was flavorful was equally as satisfying as it come up. Highly recommended for bulimics.
Rosie B.,"San Diego, CA",65,39,,3.0,3/17/2014,"BJs is great for large parties and for having a wide selection of yummy food! Their only downsides are their not so friendly staff and the fact that you cannot prepay online or by phone for a to go order. (And when I called to ask about that their manager couldnt even be bothered to speak with me) I will definitely keep going for sit down dinners, but I wont order to go again."
Cindy H.,"San Diego, CA",257,252,203,4.0,9/30/2011,"Came here the other night and did the 2 for $20 deal with a friend. We both started out with ceasar salads, then for our entree had the BBQ chicken pizza, and for dessert a chocolate chip pizookie. The salad was alright, the pizza good, and the pizookie so good! Of course the pizookie was all we really came for. We actually came with a group of about 40 people, so they gave us one of the side rooms. The service was pretty good despite our large size."
Darlene B.,"Phoenix, AZ",97,653,794,4.0,9/12/2011,"Never can complain when there's pizookie's on the menu. That's the main event at BJ's, so make sure you leave room in your stomach to have one. This places has great service -- enthusiastic waiters/waitresses and hostesses/hosts.  If they screw up your order, even just a little bit, they always give a complimentary pizookie, which i love! Great lunch menu during the weekdays as well as the happy hour menu."
Danny D.,"San Diego, CA",3,121,34,3.0,2/13/2012,This review is based only on the bar area. GREAT BEER SAMPLERS AND AWSOME PIZZA WHEN YOUR DRINKING. This is definetly a great place to have some drinks with your buddys.
Jessie A.,"Dallas, TX",82,315,200,1.0,8/31/2013,Really terrible food and service. I avoid this chain point blank.
Mari D.,"San Diego, CA",154,220,119,4.0,10/13/2012,"Chain restaurant...I know shame on me. My buddy I hadn't seen since high school wanted to reunite and I was left with the decision to choose a place. So at this point I'm like WOOHOO...no price limit cuz you left it up to me to choose a place. Looked through a bunch of great restaurants and most were in downtown and hillcrest...sigh...On a Saturday night....I wasn't even going to bother.  Not only am I challenged in the art of parallel parking but there is also the little problem of parking being non existent in these areas.  Plan 2 comes into action. I'd been dying to go to BJ's Restaurant ever since I found Casa De Pice (next door) after it moved from Old Town (yeah, long time ago) Point is...yeah, parking is still scarce at the Grossmont mall but it's nowhere as horrid as it is in downtown/hillcrest.  Ok...fine story time over and on to the real stuff about the restaurant. We went Saturday at 2pm and were seated right away. That was pretty cool...I'm sure the night gets really crowded so I'm glad we didn't want to that.  It's horrible of me that we got seated so quickly that I can't describe anything about what the restaurant looks like...I really zoned out...plus I was busy catching up so had no time to focus on my surrounding (good thing there wasn't a crime and asked to give a description of the events that took place) Anywho, our waitress was super nice and un-intrusive (that's probably not a word) but we got enough attention to where nothing was missing. On to the food, we shared an appetizer sampler. Basic restaurant foods, cheese sticks, taco thingers and what i really wanted to try, the artichoke dip. All of it was good and filling. Nothing particularly stood out to me but it was all definitely good.  We made the mistake of ordering more after the huge appetizer. I got the ""gourmet mac and cheese."" It was really good. At first it looked small but you find out the hard way that it's the right size. I ended up taking half of that home. Everyone raves about the pizzokie and we didn't get to try it, but I'll be back. I want to try the chicken bbq pizza since everyone I asked about the restaurant recommended it. The menu is huge!!!! I also want to go back for potato skins and the boneless wings...maybe even a drink and maybe someday the pizzokie. Bj's, I totally approve!"
Natalie M.,"San Diego, CA",174,187,5,5.0,1/28/2011,"I have been to BJ's twice and was very impressed both times. The menu selection is a bit overwhelming for one, but that's good for groups especially when you know not everyone is going to want the same thing. They have everything from Pizza and Pasta to Burgers and Tacos.  First time I went, I had the Tomato Basil Bisque with a HH Cheese Pizza (1/2 price) and dipped the crust in my soup...mmmmm!!  Second time, I had the veggie burger on sourdough bread with the thin shoe string fries. Beware, there burgers are very big and come with a ton of fries. I'm not complaining at all, it just a lot of food and I had to take half home.  Both visits were wonderful service wise and the restaurant (and bathrooms) were clean. The beer selection is mostly their own since they are a brewery too. The Wheat Beer was my favorite.  Definitely plan on going back many times to try some more goodies.  HH is from 4-6 M-F, I'm not sure about the weekends though.   Discounts on lots of apps, 1/2 off mini pizza's, 1/2 price bottles of wine, $1 off pint and specialty drinks."
Allison F.,"Lemon Grove, CA",6,7,5,5.0,1/23/2015,One of the best dinning experiences by far. Me and my boyfriend came in on a busy Friday night. The host was really friendly and we didn't wait that long which was great! We had Tianna W. as a server. She took really good care of us and the food was delicious! We will be coming back and asking for Tianna again!
Tim S.,"Surprise, AZ",111,1122,1495,4.0,9/3/2010,"More like 3.5 stars but Ill round up and here is why.............. The wife and I went out for a date tonight and decided to come here.  They have a killer deal right now where you can get 2 salads, a medium specialty pizza and a pazookie for $19.95.  Whether you like the place or not, thats a super deal! We started off with wedge salads which were pretty damn good.  We got ranch dressing and they top the wedge with tomatoes, onions and bacon bits.   Next up came the pizza.  We got the ""Pig"" pizza.  Basically a Hawaiian pizza.  Tomatoes, pineapple and ham.  This was the first time eating BJs pizza and I was impressed.  Its a tad greasy but it didnt kill the stomach.  Side rant........  (If you can remember back to when one time Pizza Hut had decent pan pizza.......I know its tough to think back that far.....its been crap for decades now....anyways........it reminded me of that but better.)  Finally to top it off we had a chocolate chip pazookie.  If you unleashed me in the room where they make the pazookies, I swear I would wreak havoc back there.  I could probably eat about 3 of them in one sitting.  Yes I am fat.....yes they are delicious!  Ice cream is my favorite dessert in the world and when you pair that with a large, hot, delicious chocolate chip cookie....... That my friends = heaven! This place is loud as a mofo and people tend to flock here like its the greatest thing since sliced bread......its not...I wouldnt wait longer than 15 minutes to eat here and I guarantee some people were waiting 30 min to an hour to grab a table.  But for 33 bucks after tax and tip, it was an excellent meal.  Our waitress was cool, the food was good, the price was right and the pazookie ranks up there with the greatest desserts you can find in this here great state of CA."
Greg B.,"San Diego, CA",74,298,200,3.0,1/12/2009,"BJ's FTW! This place...I really enjoyed this place.  The food, the service, the drinks....all were outstanding.  Now, in all fairness, I did have some alcohol so I was really, really happy and I couldn't ding them on anything at the time.  Thinking back, there's still nothing I can ding them on.  I had a really, really good time."
Landa S.,"Vista, CA",15,42,41,4.0,3/31/2011,"I know, I know. Another review of BJ's! It is a great restaurant and I'm glad it has expanded around San Diego county. Hubby and I go here often because they usually have good food and good atmosphere. It's also located near a shopping mall and movie theater so convenience is great.  There have only been a couple of times that we've had an issue, which is to be expected when you frequent a restaurant.  Pizookie all the way!"
Stephanie C.,"San Diego, CA",2,11,,1.0,4/20/2013,Just left without eating. We sat in the outdoor patio area and waited about 20 minutes without a single server stopping by our table while every other table around us was served. We stopped by to check in with the hostess on the way out and she was hardly concerned. Horrible service. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.
