Alex L.,"San Diego, CA",152,25,,1.0,5/13/2011,"I hate this place. There service is like too many people I know. They act all fake and pretty much want to use their customers. I went there for my 21st birthday, I had extra things added to my bill that were deceptively asked while I was placing my order. Don't worry, I subtracted the extra cost out of my waiters tip. I heard a lot about their beers being great. It didn't meet my expectations  I went there for my sisters birthday, in la jolla. That was the longest wait I've ever had. i was so disappointed that I wrote bjs a letter. I didn't get any response. Basically the waiter didn't want to give us our change so he made us wait 45 min. He wanted us to leave.  Don't go there for your birthday. In fact, don't go there!"
Katie F.,"El Cajon, CA",14,14,1,4.0,1/4/2014,"Food is always great. One downside is the service is always hit or miss, most of the time miss. I understand it is usually always busy but even when its a little slower it takes much too long to get even a drink refill. I'll continue to go back just for the avocado egg rolls."
Jeremy T.,"Santee, CA",53,138,30,4.0,12/13/2012,"Just fyi, they ran out of their ""house"" IPA. How do you run out of your own brand on a friday nigh at 6 pm? Tacos were great though!"
Gina D.,"La Mesa, CA",24,75,1,4.0,3/30/2011,Service is usually very good. We've had one bad experience in the bar. Chairs are very uncomfortable and the service was slow. Also anything ordered with blue cheese dressing is ruined by the brand of dressing they use.  Love the lunch menu. Great strawberry lemonade. Really good clam chowder. Fries are nom nom! Pizookie is heaven.
Norman B.,"La Mesa, CA",0,14,,1.0,8/18/2014,"I've been herw several times and the service is hit or miss.  With the exception of the seasoned bartenders, the others are not as attentive.   Today my food order never came out.  I typically bring it to someone's attention but today the bartender (not one of the experienced ones) didn't even notice that my food didn't arrive, she was oblivious and even admitted  to not noticing that the order never came out. The manager was nice enough to comp my bill but they are still LAME."
Jennifer A.,"El Cajon, CA",63,2,,5.0,7/19/2014,I cannot express how amazing my experience here was. We decided last minute to have my daughters birthday at B.J's. When I spoke to Ryan (who is probably the most amazing manager I have ever met) he was very generous and open to work with my budget. He actually outdid himself! The food was fantastic the patio was ready for me when I got there and they even helped me set and clean up the mess we made. Family and friends loved the food and the service. It was such a great experience that I would definitely recommend this place for any private party.
Alex B.,"El Cajon, CA",153,3,,4.0,5/12/2013,"I go to BJ's every year on my birthday, and I am satisfied every year! The food is amazing and the service is pretty good the majority of the time. It is always very busy so the servers do seem flustered sometimes, but remember how many people they are trying to take care of!  I recommend this to everyone!"
Dalyn C.,"San Diego, CA",38,55,9,4.0,1/5/2013,It was my first time ever coming to Bj's and the serivce we got was really good. I ordered the thai mango chicken salad which was delish! my husband ordered the jambalaya. It took so long to get our order because i guess they ran out of rizoto for the jambalaya so the manager came and asked us if we wanted to continue to wait or if we wanted to subsitute it for something else so we decided for pasta jambalaya. My husband was a bit disapointed because he wanted to try it with rizoto. But it wasn't bad with pasta. The part that really impressed us was the manager removed the jambalaya from our bill. He didn't have to do that but he did. Because of the wonderful customer service we will be coming back here again soon. A co worker recommended bj's to me and i am glad she did.
Henry T.,"San Diego, CA",126,516,36,4.0,11/14/2010,"Gotta say that I think the best way to enjoy a place like BJ's is to go on happy hour on a Saturday night. As Khann and I did last night. We were seated quickly in an area off to the right of the entrance and a lot of the menu was very cheap. $2 off appetizers, which we ordered in the form of two plates of chicken wings and a plate of Santa Fe spring rolls. The wings were good, not oversauced or spicy, and the spring rolls were like open-faced, Mexican-flavored egg rolls. There was very little taste from the guacamole dipping sauce provided but that wasn't too bad. I was in a pizza mood from two days ago, so we ordered two mini-pizzas, both of which were half off during happy hour. The ""BJ's Favorite"" pizza was okay, a little more cheesy than I expected and had olives, which I didn't like, but the crust was firm and the size of the pizza was manageable. I ordered the meat special pizza, which we weren't able to finish but is now leftovers sitting in my fridge for later. Since it was happy hour, I figured it was only right to order a beer so I went with the darker beer. It was tasty enough, but I could only finish half of the beer. I admit that I'm a weak beer drinker, certainly not the drinker Khann is. I had to switch to Pepsi, which was also very tasty. I'm a big fan of Pepsi so it probably would've been better if I just stuck with Pepsi throughout the night. We were debating getting dessert and I admit that I wanted to try the Triple Chocolate Chunk pizookie, but we were both stuffed by that point so that was a no go. $46 for all that food? Not bad. The bar area, I liked very much because there were hi-def TVs all around the area tuned to various college football games. The table we chose was a little small for the amount of food we ordered but the seats were comfortable. I had issues with the small men's bathroom here. One stall and one urinal? I had to save going to the restroom for later because the guy in the stall was taking longer than I expected."
Walker S.,"San Diego, CA",13600,511,2167,3.0,6/24/2010,"My daughter treated me to a father's day lunch at any restaurant, my choice.  I enjoyed this special day very much.  The service was excellent, outstanding really.  The food was average.  The noise levels at this BJ's are a little high.  Parking is always a challenge here.  Overall, 3 stars, but remember this was the restaurant I picked for Father's day."
Caryn C.,"La Porte, IN",50,1,,3.0,1/18/2015,"Our first visit to the La Mesa BJ's 1/17. We had a party of about 25, which we made reservations in advance for. Members of our party did not arrive all at once so some of us had ordered drinks while we waited. We decided we wanted to get some apps so we let one of our servers know and said that we would have separate checks. She informed me that because she had entered drinks that she couldn't separate anything. As someone who served for several years I knew that that was untrue. (If this is how BJs systems operate then some upgrades are severely needed!) She also told me that I did not indicate multiple checks when I made the reservation. I let her know that I was not asked our preference. In the end, we ended up writing our checks out individually ourselves and she divided them up on the computer. It took her an hour of our time to do so. I think the manner in which she handled this was very unprofessional. I was pretty disappointed with our service here especially because it was a special occasion. I also think that the area for large parties is understaffed. We were one of three large groups and there were only two servers taking care of everyone. I give our visit three stars because our food was great and our male server put candles on the cake we brought and served it to us."
D T.,"La Mesa, CA",5,100,57,3.0,6/27/2013,Beer rating is 4 stars. Food rating is 3 because the quality is dropping and I'm concerned. This used to be my favorite place but last night's boneless chicken was mostly fried breading. The food arrived cold. The service was less than attentive. I've been spoiled by BJs and hope the honeymoon is not over!
Monique S.,"Escondido, CA",6,7,,3.0,8/1/2014,"Met up with friends for happy hour on Thursday.The craft beers for $4 during happy hour were great! Loved the stout! My friends got the sliders and fries offered at happy hour,they were good as well.The service was not so good.Very slow coming around around.My friend ordered wine and they brought it to her.A few mins later the server returned with another glass of wine and told her that they had given her the wrong wine.So my friend ended up with 2 glasses.Then it happen again to another friend who ordered beer and she ended up with 2 glasses. Really?? Who is dropping the ball here? Server rarely returned to check on our group.My friend's ice in her ice tea melted ions ago.......Then my hubby was half way thru his beer when he discovered a bug in it.- ugh! Of course trying to get the attention of our server was something else,had to flag down another server to find her.The server said that she would replace the half full glass with a half full glass.,and that's what she did!  I guess we're lucky that she didn't just hand over a spoon and tell us to fish the poor critter out.How cheap! The beer and food were good,service was horrible. A big dislike were the tall chairs and tables in the bar area,they were all tall! What is a disabled person suppose to do?"
jaime R.,"San Diego, CA",0,20,35,1.0,2/22/2015,Smells like an old rag. Food is good but the smell of old carpe kills it. The place is ok but just that smell of old rag makes it very unpleasant. They could replace the old carpet wit wood floors.
Kelly H.,"San Diego, CA",38,49,1,3.0,7/22/2013,"Pretty standard. Nothing spectacular, nothing awful. Good place to go if you have a variety of people and their taste buds. I ate the jumbalaya. That was yummy with a decent kick of spice."
Blu H.,"La Mesa, CA",18,15,15,2.0,1/9/2015,"I used to LOVE this place. The food and service used to be so good, but the past few times I've been its one thing after another going wrong. Tonight I went with my husband and in laws and our 3 kids (ages 7, 5, 18 months). I know it's Friday night so it's busy and they told me the wait would be about an hour, but they would see if they could call us sooner. I'm fine with that. After we were seated everything went downhill fast. Our waitress took half an hour before she took our order. We ordered an appetizer to hold us over and that took another 20 minutes to get to us, and they never brought us flatware so we couldn't eat it till it was cold, and we asked for small plates and they come out wet and covered in grey goo. Yuck! I asked for a small bowl of fruit to hold over the baby who was getting cranky. She devoured that quick so I asked for some cubed cheese. It came shredded. Not a big deal, that's manageable. Well now it's been 45 minutes and our food still hasn't come out. Food comes and we have to send a plate back for the taste being so awful. We ordered a desert and it came but they only brought 2 spoons for 7 people. Had to ask a bus boy for more spoons bc we couldn't find our waitress (again). Spoons that were brought were wet and covered in grey goo. By the end of everything we talked over how awful it was and realized we were never even offered refills on our drinks! We weren't brought condiments and had to try to flag down anyone we thought worked there for the service we needed. I won't be going back. So disappointed."
Marquette N.,"San Diego, CA",37,93,1,5.0,8/29/2011,"This place is always great (always has a crowd), but always great. Been here plenty of times and not sure why it has taken me this long to write this well overdue review. I love sitting at the bar/bar area to enjoy football games and in the restaurant to enjoy good company. The drinks are good and not watered down. Good selection of beer too. I like the Razz Martini the best. The food....loving it all. Never had a bad meal here at all. Here are some personal favorites though: Giant stuff potato, mac & cheese, pizza, guacamole spring rolls.  Give this place a shot, its worth the wait. OH, and don't forget to finish the night off with one of their famous pizzookies!!!!"
Daniel R.,"Marina del Rey, CA",6,28,,4.0,8/29/2011,"Came here on Friday night about 30 minutes before closing, which was probably the best time to come!  There were only a handful of people there, our food came out very quick, our server was great, and the food was delicious!  Based on this experience alone, I will definitely be coming back here! And I highly recommend the mac n cheese as well as the fried artichoke (especially for a late night snack!)"
Jen G.,"San Diego, CA",2,25,2,4.0,1/7/2011,"As far as chain restaurants go, this is as good as it gets. The pizza here (Chicago-style deep dish) is delicious. My favorite is the Mediterranean.  Great selection of beers, of course. I think the most commonly ordered is the Brewhouse Blonde (it's like a German Kolsch), but I love the Jeremiah Red. Any beer enthusiast must get the Jeremiah Red. The servers here have always been friendly and on the ball. Even when it's busy, service is quick. The contemporary industrial interior is nice. I think it was designed by the same group who did Ruth's Chris Steak House, among others."
Donna C.,"San Diego, CA",18,93,34,4.0,6/7/2013,Try the mahi mahii tacos & bison burger.
