Richie W.,"Richmond, VA",295,419,81,1.0,7/12/2010,"Bad experience.  Firstly, I felt really rushed. I had sat down for about 2 seconds and then the server wanted our drinks order. Then while looking over the menu, I had to twice ask her for a few more minutes. Secondly one person ordered shrimp tacos. They arrive and the shrimps were still pink and cold - totally raw. We sent it back and 20 minutes later after the rest of us had eaten the second attempt at shrimp tacos arrived. They were exactly the same, not cooked and translucent in color. The server called over the manager and she said that was ""how they cook them here!"". I explained that when I cook shrimp at home I usually can tell when they are cooked by the change in color. In the end we walked over the street to Rubios. The shrimp tacos were excellent and a third of the price. This place is good for beers and a snack, but not a meal. I know people who have worked at BJ's in the past and said that there is a large row of microwaves in the kitchen. Most stuff is frozen and just heated up."
Brad J.,"McAlester, OK",196,1,,5.0,10/16/2013,"Wow. I hadn't checked on here before heading to this BJ's location and I'm laughing now after reading Danielle's review below. I came here to leave a service review for George and it seems he's a popular guy. Guy just knocked it out of the park. He had me almost leaning towards the blonde with the way he described it but saw I was a Red Sox fan and asked if I wanted a Sam Adams. As if I would drink anything else during a sox game! Real nice guy, knows his stuff. Attentive and knowledgable. Our dinner was awesome.  Told me his buddies call him Eddy so Good Job Eddy!"
Carmen C.,"San Diego, CA",351,86,119,4.0,5/3/2011,"pizza is good and good drinks. I like coming here for some ""girl"" time. Place is nice and clean, very friendly, nice outdoor patio seating w/heaters and just a good time. There were a couple of times that we had to wait and was handed a beeper for when our table was ready, but all worth the wait. After a great dinner, The Grossmont mall is a nice place to stroll and work the food out. Great family place."
Cammy L.,"Santee, CA",269,267,171,4.0,6/17/2010,"Love BJ's!! (That's what he said! It's okay to laugh, I got it like that)  Love sitting out side on the patio in the summer.  I come for three things... (Now that's what she said...) anywho, Avocado Egg Rolls are to DIE FOR!!! and Berry Burst Cider and A Drink Like That.. seriously that's it's name... A Drink Like That... More than one or five times I've had a few of those and found it quite difficult to walk out the front door appearing sober. I'm not a beer drinker but they also have a I believe 7 or 8 beer sampler, gives you a few ounces of different beers... everyone I know that drinks beer loves it! Don't like dining in the main dining room, it is SO loud all the time and for some reason, don't know what kinds of people are sitting in these booths (probably VERY LARGE people) because 3/4 of the benches are sunken... I'm barely over 5 feet... so in these booths basically my chin is one inch above the table. Talk about feeling like a kid again. So to get it right go on a warm summer night, sit on the patio, sip on a delicious ""Drink Like That"", Berry Burst Cider, any multiple of their signature beers or any of the other classics that they serve (fully stocked bar), and enjoy an Avocado Egg Roll appetizer...  GREAT for Happy Hour!"
Ann F.,"Alpine, CA",12,37,,4.0,6/24/2013,"I just have to say the to go service is excellent. They offer curb side pick up,but besides that convenience the service was great. I was served my drinks while I waited (which they refilled),the girls offered ideas when it turned out what I wanted was out, and they did not miss anything in my bag to make my meal complete. Everything was packed nicely and seperatly. They did not have it this time, but if you haven't tried the giant stuffed chicken baked potato with Alfredo sauce, do it!!"
Jackie B.,"San Diego, CA",165,124,832,3.0,8/17/2012,good appetizers but the main entree's are just ok. The servers are friendly but very slow. it took us 1 hour to get our food and 1 hour for our check which they calculated wrong so he had to do it again which took additional 20 min on top of that hour. good thing we were very patient that day.
Jennifer M.,"San Diego, CA",83,65,21,2.0,11/9/2012,"To sum it up: Good food, but terrible service for a large group! If you'd like to read more, see below.  I recently had my birthday dinner here. We had reservations for 20 people. I'll never do that again! It was an hour after arriving that we received water and almost 1 hr and 15min  before we received our  drinks (beer, cocktails, sodas, etc).  At this point my guests were already annoyed, but we stayed because we had already ordered our dinner. Upon complaining to the server, we were told ""well, that's what happens when you all wanted to order your food right away (nevermind that he asked, ""would you like to get started ordering?""). And the bartenders are really backed up. I'm sorry but your drinks will be here shortly."" I was in shock that he managed to place blame, rather than just appreciating that we were frustrated. Later after our food arrived, I'd say about 65% of the orders were incorrect. The pizza crusts were switched, pizzas that were not supposed to have cheese came out with cheese, toppings were all switched around. We were so frustrated. By this point, I had to cancel my other plans for the evening because dinner had already taken 2+ hours and we were barely eating. When complaining about the mistakes for the food, the server was defensive (again) and not all that friendly. He blamed us for having ""complicated orders"".  The manager had spoke to me multiple times by now, apologizing profusely and saying he was embarrassed and couldn't believe this had happened. In the end, he took quite a bit off the bill, which we all appreciated, however I did not plan to spend my birthday evening chatting it up with the manager. I would've rather been chatting with my friends and enjoying my birthday dinner. I had to argue with the server (who by this point was pretending we didn't exist and only showing up when we actively flagged him over), that I wanted to eat dessert. About 20 minutes after the check had been paid, I reminded the server that it was my birthday (and that the manager promised me a free pizookie, to ease all the troubles of the evening). The server argued about if I could have the small or large pizookie. Sigh, unbelievable. Finally I got my bday dessert, but by this time over half my party had left.   On another note: the BBQ Chicken pizza on gluten free crust use to be amazing, but for some reason they felt like they needed to mix BBQ sauce and marinara sauce together now, so I wouldn't recommend ordering that.   In BJ's Pizza's defense,  EVERY other time I have gone there the service has been stellar, food delicious and no mistakes.   Go with a small party, don't order anything complicated and make sure you have plenty of time and you'll love this place. Otherwise, steer clear."
Nikki M.,"San Diego, CA",104,220,21,5.0,9/10/2010,"BJ's absolutely gets 5 stars from me for having the yummiest gluten free pizza I have ever had!!!! We come here often now, and its always a hit for the family or friends because of the full bar, enormous menu and fun atmosphere. I know its a chain, but its a chain that I freakin LOVE, and I dont say that about very many places. BJ's continues to impress. Oh and this location's curbside pick up is the bomb. They always have us in and out quickly for a pizza on the go!"
Mariah C.,"El Cajon, CA",4,20,,5.0,7/4/2010,"I give this place 2 thumbs up. It has awesome food, everyone thinks that they are just known for their brew and pizza, NO! They have epic Italian meals that I would go back and devour time and time again.  BJ's has its' own delicious, innovative spin on your favorite foods, including deep dish pizzas, salads, sandwiches, pastas, steaks, baby back ribs and so much more. And of course, everything tastes better with BJ's own handcrafted beer. I would recommend for dessert at the end to get a big fat Pazookie!!! its a freshly baked cookie with ice cream time on top. It is amazing."
Andrea F.,"La Mesa, CA",61,24,2,1.0,9/9/2013,"worst meal ever. What has happened to this place!!???? seriously disgusting, slow service and our booth reeked like dirty socks.  It has gone so downhill it makes me sad...new management??!! who knows but I will NEVER go here again"
Kimberly T.,"San Diego, CA",528,24,3,3.0,7/7/2011,"We have been going to BJs across Socal for years because of soccer events mainly.  It has such an extensive menu tho!  Thats good and bad with so much going on back in the kitchen.  Favorites: Pulled Pork Sandwiches Mini Pizzas Improvements: larger pizzas have way to much breading and not enough meats and veggies as in the past.  It used to be portioned better!! Took a friend and he wont go back because most the pizza was dough. =[   You get a better bite on the mini pizzas. Also would like to see them bring back the potato chips with Parmesan and garlic. Why get rid of a tasty treat everyone I know ordered! great for games and before a mean snack!  Another reviewer mentioned check your bill. YES check it. Its been wrong many times especially if you added later or changed your order. Service is hit and miss, but always friendly once you get service. Kids love the cookies/ ice cream deserts!"
Andrea P.,"Oak Park, San Diego, CA",30,40,9,5.0,12/27/2012,"Such a fun place to go for the whole family!  The brewhouse is nice to get adult drinks, or get the root beer for kids!  Plus the whole family loves the Pizookie! I am not big on desserts but you can't go to BJ's without getting a pizookie!  Delicous and fun night at BJ's, I see family coming back often!"
Boozefighter C.,"Fredericksburg, VA",89,118,6,4.0,5/2/2011,"Cute girls work here! Just a bonus.  The food is great.  Burgers are killer, and the pizza is some of the best we've ever had at a chain food place.  Good beer too, real good beer.  Prices are more than fair.  One of the fav's.  Stamp of approval. -TGBJ"
Kerra A.,"San Diego, CA",1756,495,588,3.0,2/9/2011,"Best Beginner Appetizer Combo = BOMB! Comes with Spinach & Artichoke Dip, Mozzerlla Sticks, Avocado Egg Rolls (yummm), and Sante Fe Egg Rolls.  I guess theyre known for their brew and their HUGE deep DEEEEEP dish pizza's, I just picked off whatever everyone else ordered.  I tried the Tatonka Stout brew (only cause it reminded me of a movie line from Dances with Wolves that my hubby says so well: Si Tatonka Obachi"" lol). Sweet dark and a little bitter, i can taste hints of the chocolate, brown sugar & molasses...def can taste the roasted barley oats. I'm not a beer specialist...but it was a'ight.  I got to try a little bit of pizza. They bring them out in the deep dish thingy's they're cooked in, and set it on some kind of pizza pan holder. The slices are thick and loaded with toppings!  PROS: Big Menu & Good Eats Big Portion Sizes Good Atmosphere CONS: kinda pricey Waitress forgot at me, so I didn't bother tipping her Went here for a birthday on a Sunday night, they close at midnight on Sunday.  They also had big screen TV's by the bar mostly set to sports channels (which is a plus) They also have a Kid's Menu (somewhat similar to Applebee's and Chili's): pizza, chicken tenders,  mini burgers, corn dog, spaghetti, mac & cheese, grilled chicken pasta, grilled chicken breast & ribs. I'll def take tha Hubby and tha Kiddies with me here next time, but only for special occassions cause the prices are a lil steep for my taste. Oh, they also have a Gluten Free menu"
Chenoa A.,"Jamul, CA",11,14,2,3.0,8/12/2013,"Went here for dinner and drinks on a Saturday night with an old friend. As we were looking thru the menu for drinks we both agreed the menu has too much selection for food and drinks making a decision hard. Also, we sat at the bar since the wait for a table was very long. It was very loud in the bar making conversation very difficult. The music was up way too high causing everyone to have to shout to hear one another."
Raj K.,"San Diego, CA",4,19,1,5.0,5/28/2012,Good beer and good food. Nuff said.
Sara Y.,"Escondido, CA",217,493,62,4.0,2/25/2010,"DISCLAIMER - we did not order the Pizookie, so don't tell me that I should've ordered it because it is ""soooooooooo GOOD!!""  I get it, I have heard it, we still passed.  Deal.  Moving on... I gathered Mom and Sis for a belated birthday/VD dinner.  I suppose the thing that sets this place apart from a TGI Fridays or Chilis is that it is a brewery.  I did not sample the beer so I cannot tell you about how it tasted (wow...this is shaping up to be a pretty pointless review, maybe).   What I can tell you is that my mom's turkey burger looked yummy, my sister's sandwich looked really tasty and I opted for minestrone soup and Field of Greens salad sans chicken.  Our waiter gave us the Book 'o Nutritional Stats with the menus and I was guilted into being good.  I scoured that novella and mentally computed the calories in my head.  All in all, I think my meal was approx. 750 calories.  Not bad for eating out. Both the soup and salad were fresh and delicious.  I think I am going to recreate that salad at home because the flavor combinations were delightful.  If you are watching your waistline, you can stay informed and still enjoy a tasty meal.  The family will love this place!"
Vicki A.,"Chula Vista, CA",20,86,29,3.0,4/9/2011,Not Bad Not Bad The Great - The selection of food and beer & Beer Sampler (yay) The Good - The semi enclosed patio The Bad - The bathroom was dark and dingy The Ugly - Chipotle egg rolls Seems like food is pretty standard here  - nothing out of the ordinary so no big dissapointments or surprises.  The Service was friendly just a little slower than expected - but it may have been obvious we were in no big hurry.  The beer sampler was the best of Oggies & Gordon Biersch  I'll go back happily sometime
Ellen M.,"San Diego, CA",3,32,,5.0,4/5/2011,"Went here last night for my husband's birthday. We were a party of 11 & everthing went pretty smoothly. Food was hot when it came out & there wasn't a long wait for it,like I have experienced at other restaurants with a large party. Try the Lightswitch Lager, great taste,light but not ""watery"". Plus it's low in calories. Everyone enjoyed their food. We'd recomend the Turkey Cobb Sandwich, Jambalaya,Giant baked potatoes & believe it or not the Cheeseburger pizza! Pickles & all! We had a couple of kids in our group & they liked the mini corn dogs (good size portion of 8). Whatever you do you must have a Pizookie!"
Bre L.,"San Diego, CA",8,10,2,4.0,11/19/2012,I love the roasted turkey cobb sandwich with the potato wedges!! and the pizookie is simply delicious!!(:
