Melissa D.,"BONITA, CA",13,6,1,1.0,9/7/2014,"Was extremely disappointed this morning when we stopped in for brunch. We were seated quickly but it took 15 mins for the waitress to come to our table to get our drink order, which consisted of coffee,mimosa and a lemonade not that difficult right and btw we also placed our food order at the same time! So another 15 mins pass and we barely get only 1 drink with the other 2 drinks following 2 mins later. We didn't get our food until 1 hour after it was taken by the waitress! it was stone cold and so overcooked that we decided to leave without even eating! Ridiculous gave them so many chances and always the same results horrible service when the aren't even busy, will never go back! Mangers don't know what to say being that their staff is so lazy when they only have 2 tables!"
Raechel S.,"San Diego, CA",433,987,384,3.0,5/30/2012,"As you might have read from my previous reviews, I'm simply not a fan of chain restaurants.   That being said,   BJ's is one chain I don't mind coming to.   I think it must be the Pizookies!    Imagine a large, freshly baked, delicious smelling cookie (you can pick from Chocolate Chip, Peanut Butter, White Chocolate Macademia Nut and Oatmeal Raisin) that's got a HUGE scoop of vanilla bean ice cream on top.  THAT is a Pizookie...and it really is as wonderful as it sounds.  They have a new flavor, the Red Velvet, that my friend enjoyed but I'm not much of a Red Velvet person.    We also ordered the Thai Chicken Mango salad, the Hawaiian Mahi Mahi, and the Blonde Shrimp Entree to share.   I can say nothing bad about any of the dishes...the service was also very friendly but not hovering, and she came back frequently to check up on us.    I wouldn't bring out of towners here to sample the ""San Diego culinary lifestyle"" but it's definitely a place to come when you're craving those Pizookies...mmmmmm...."
Jeremy M.,"El Cajon, CA",3,24,3,4.0,9/6/2010,"The food here is usually pretty consistent, but this review is more to give props to the service.  I went to dinner with my family & the in-laws last night, and our service was top-notch. First off, our waitress (Felicia or Alicia...can't remember) was AWESOME.  She was attentive, checked in often without being annoying, and humored us with our lame jokes.  She got drinks when we needed them, and compared to our negative experience at Soundwave earlier that afternoon, it was very refreshing. Second, my klutzy brother-in-law slipped and dropped a slice of his pizza right after it arrived from the kitchen.  When a waitress saw it, she immediately stopped and helped him pick it up, and even offered to bring him a mini pizza to replace his slice - on the house!  The manager also dropped in to check on us, and made sure we knew the mini pizza was on the house.   Now, keep in mind that we didn't even ask for a free slice or mini pizza.  We would have been content to just laugh at my brother-in-law and that would have been the end of it. Someone ought to call up Soundwave (formerly Canes) and tell 'em that this is how you win customers for life."
Monique H.,"San Diego, CA",363,228,31,3.0,8/2/2010,"We had my Aunties Surprise Bday Party at the La Mesa location over this past weekend. We had booked a very large party for the patio. Over 40 people, you figure they wouldn't double book the patio, especially when the 2 totally clash. A bday for a fifty something yr old lady and all her crazy family and friends with a 1 yr olds family bday party! Those people sucked and were no fun, it was like Dungeons & Dragons couple had a baby and invited all of their Lair to come out and celebrate with their white trash family. Ugh... They were in no mood for us , and well myself and cousin were in no mood for them.  The Spread they served up for our party was awesome! 8 different deep dished pizza's, I don't recall which kinds, but a good variety. I'm not a big fan of there pizza, its far to greasy oily greasy for me and the tomato's they put on are just giant chunks of gross can'ness, mainly its all the oil they use.Im still on a mission for a great deep dish pie in SD. Makes me miss Chicago big time! I heart their Cesar salad, its great , fresh , Parmesan cheese is rad and the croutons are homemade there, so that's a plus. I think they also had a Alfredo pasta, nothing to special about that either. No real flavor unless you added salt and or pepper to it. So I opted for salad and beers galore!  Berry Burst cider I think you are wonderful! They gave me their version of a snake bite, it was with there Berry Burst Cider and there Nut-brown Ale, it was OK. Not a true snake bite, but it was good. I just settled on the cider itself after while. Oh they also have they best savory to die for yummy delicious beer from Belgium. LIndmen Framboise - its divines! Like drink a glass of strawberry's, its sweet a dessert beer , you could pour it on ice cream and be stoked! Drank one of those to finish off the evening.  The staff was very helpful and accommodating to our large party, the bartender was super personable and attentive. They have 2 happy hours a day . The first during normal happy hr time, and then a second after 10pm. Prices aren't bad and staff is awesome. Oh another crappy thing about this place is parking, You'd think since it was in the mall parking it'd be great - wrong its hard to find parking at dinner and lunch times! Good luck and don't get parking lot rage!"
Omar M.,"San Diego, CA",31,2,1,4.0,6/6/2013,Great Beer Good Food Fair service.  Parking here  sucks so don't spend twenty minutes looking for a close spot. There is usually a 15 minute wait but theres always a spot at the lounge
Michael R.,"Louisville, KY",242,217,55,4.0,11/5/2007,"I've only been to BJ's twice. On my first visit. I was not impressed. It was crowded and loud, and the food was mediocre. In my head, I lumped it into the Chile's/TGIF/Red Robin category. I only went back because my roommate said they had cheap lunch specials. They DO have good lunch specials, and it's not even remotely busy during the week at lunch. I like that. Still, based on the food alone, I'm not inclined to praise this place. I give four stars for the service I received. To go with my half Turkey Cobb Sandwich and salad I ordered something called a Jerryburst (don't remember the exact name), which is some sort of berry cider or something mixed with beer. It sounded interesting, so I thought I'd try it. A few minutes later, our server came back to let me know that they were actually all out of the Jerryburst. She recommended Wyder's Pear or Peach cider. I like the pear a lot, so I requested that. A few minutes later, she returned, saying that unfortunately, they were out of that too. She asked if I'd like to try the peach, and added that she'd be giving us a free Pizookie for the inconvenience. Well, I hadn't tried the peach, but I was more than willing, and who can argue when free dessert is involved! Also, their Pizookie is probably the best thing they have to offer. All their food seems pretty standard, but a huge cookie with ice cream on top? I'm in! Our receipt came with a customer survey, and you can be damn sure I went on-line and told BJ's corporate all about what a great experience I'd had there. Hopefully, the praise for our server trickled down and she was acknowledged for her positive attitude and great customer service skills. One last thing to note: Ladies, when you visit, be sure to use the bathroom and check out the art. It's not just some lame print you can buy at Ikea, or whatever usually ends up in public toilets. It's some half naked guy! Makes me wonder what's in the Men's. I almost went in to check!"
Ron M.,"La Mesa, CA",2,2,,4.0,9/11/2012,"Really a fun place to got for good food and beer.  Visited this place 3 times and left feeling very good 3 times!  Good service, good food, great variety of beverages, and very nice staff."
J A.,"Stockholm, Sweden",3,33,1,3.0,8/12/2013,"Nice restaurant. Price range $$ - $$$. Sat out on their patio which is nice. Ordered from their special menu that only consists of 4 pages. Had the share-plate for $20. You get ribs and chicken plus 2 sides. Ribs and chicken was good, cole-slaw was only ok and the potato salad did not taste good at all."
Genevieve A.,"Spring Valley, CA",46,72,70,4.0,5/24/2010,"Fan of their beer (Jeremiah Red), PIZOOKIE, and pizza.  Great place to go with a group bc they seem to know how to handle a group very well. Come on a weekend and expect to wait. Typical American food, hamburgers, sandwiches, ribs, deep dish (Chicago-style) pizzas, and an array of different pizookies. If you don't know what a pizookie is check it out for yourself, no one can say no to BJ's ;)"
Al J.,"San Diego, CA",40,55,16,3.0,3/23/2010,"BJ's has a great atmosphere, but for some reason the food choices or lack there of, really disappointed me. I'm not a picky eater, but the menu was confusing to me. Nothing stood out, I even asked my friends for recommendations on what to get and they were just as indecisive. I found myself looking through the menu for 45 minutes before I even made a decision on the Jambalaya. And even then I wasn't to sure I wanted that, I guess I just settled since all of my friends had already ordered.  As for as the food is concerned, the Jambalaya was mediocre, a bit salty and way to much paprika! I sampled some of my friends entrees, and they were just ""OK"" as well. Nothing that my taste buds went crazy for. BJ's brews there own beers, which are pretty good. I had a pint of the Red and also the Blonde. I'd recommend the Blonde if you like the lighter beers like myself.  I would have probably gave this place only 2 stars based on my food experience, but our waitress was really helpful and friendly. We were celebrating a friends birthday, so it was rather a large group, about 12 people. She was prompt and made sure we had everything we needed. Customer service is everything to me, It elevates the experience regardless of the product or service you're purchasing. I'm a true believer in that.  I'm still up in the air about BJ's. I guess you'll just have to give it a try for yourself."
Dr. J.,"Spring Valley, CA",3,19,27,1.0,9/8/2014,We came for the pizookies and was so excited but our server Kayleigh was obviously tired wanted to go home and prematurely dropped the check before we even got our dessert. She came by to check on us after we got our dessert and it would have made more sense for her to drop the check then but instead we felt rushed. She didn't even ask if there was anything else she could get us. Poor service is a reflection of poor management and this isn't the first time I've gotten poor service there. We spoke to the manager and he seemed very new and more bothered that we were even talking to him.  He had no idea what to say. Explains why they were both working late Saturday night. Thank God for their pizookies or I'm not sure they would have any business! I still tipped her bc I'm in the industry and bc I felt sorry for her. I will not return to that location. I will drive 20 minutes to their Fashion Valley location. Sorry!
Christine J.,"Provo, UT",127,86,129,5.0,2/25/2010,"WOW, this place is gorgeous! If you're a fan of BJ's like I am then your jaw is gonna drop to the floor when you step inside this restaurant.  The place is very big, spacious, and has a cool urban-modern decor.  Seriously the best BJ's I've ever been to, and I've been to a few! ;)   I went on a Monday night and the place was fairly empty.  Which was nice because it allowed my boyfriend & I to have an intimate dinner together.  We ordered the ""Sweet Pig"" pizza which was delish, although it was only warm not hot.  Eating the Ghiradelli Triple Chocolate Pizookie for dessert totally made up for that tho! :) My only warning is that the tile floor is a bit slippery, especially if you're wearing heels.  So ladies, hold on to your man or stroll carefully with your girlfriends when walking to your table!"
Emily R.,"La Mesa, CA",22,118,1,4.0,4/6/2012,"Service was ok, it was a friday night and busy so that was to be expected. I think our waiters switched during the evening, took a little while to get our drink orders. I orderded a ""skinny"" girl margarita and sent it back, first one was good, second not so good. All in all food was good, taking care of our bill was easy as well, since we were with a big party it wasn't a hassle. They do have really good avocado rolls, which we didn't have this time, but will be back again for those."
Lynn N.,"San Diego, CA",101,4,,5.0,8/5/2012,"Went tol Bjs La mesa for the first time, could not believe the outstanding service and the standard in which they hold all their employees. The food was incredible and the manager Brian made us feel so welcome and had the whole table laughing. We will definalty be back and rave about this place to everyone!! Thanks for the wonderful evening!!!!"
Trang N.,"San Diego, CA",161,127,46,4.0,11/8/2010,"Okay, when my husband and I go out on a Sunday and find a place that has happy hour at 6pm, we are happy.  On Sundays, during football season, they have really good happy hour specials. $2 off appetizers, 1/2 off mini pizzas, $2 off drafts...can't go wrong.  I had a mini pizza (deep dish and delish: pepperoni, bacon, meatballs and jalapenos) and added a wedge salad. I was in heaven and to me, I love Bronx pizza, but this one was different! Gotta love the semi burnt cheese around the crust as it gave it flavor. My husband got the rack of ribs.  He seem to have enjoyed his dinner quite a bit. We ordered their Chili which was really good as well. And their Pizookie!!  Off the hook!!!  It's a must try if you've never had it!  I recommend this place as they have great happy hour 4-7 Monday-Friday and I think they have late night happy hour from 10pm-close."
James E.,"San Diego, CA",0,4,,2.0,6/24/2011,"The food and beer at BJ's is great.  No complaints there. The problem recently is with the service.  The last couple of years it has been slow slow slow and is only getting worse.  And make sure that you check your bill at the end because they will add a round or two if you're not careful.  They'll take it off when you call them on it, but still...the fact that they try says it all. So eat, drink and be merry, as long as you're not in a hurry.  And keep track of what you order, because they won't."
Kayla C.,"Santee, CA",249,16,8,5.0,4/3/2013,"Ten minute wait, Tons of different selections on the menu, vibrant noise level and lots of good drinks. We got drinks, two appetizers, and two entrees. Totaled out to $60 which is legit. Service was great! there was a tad mix up on the sides on one entree and they fixed it hassle free and fast."
Dan H.,"Chula Vista, CA",21,86,6,3.0,10/18/2012,"I've been here a few times before for lunch (usually at a friend's request) and I don't know why I am surprised that BJs remains mediocre. I mean take Chilis, add in some Applebys and throw in a dash of TGI Fridays, mix well and you have BJ's. I do give it 3 stars as the microbrews are decent. As for the food and service, apathetic in both areas. This place has potential but they don't really strive to get better."
Jeanette S.,"San Diego, CA",404,129,2903,2.0,11/8/2013,"When I first moved to San Diego, I used to love ordering the pizzas, salads, and pizooki's from BJ's.  I still like coming to BJ's from time to time, but this location is probably one I won't be coming back to any time soon.  For my sister's birthday dinner, my brother-in-law decided to make reservations here since BJ's is one of their family favorite restaurants.  Our party had reservations for 8:30pm, but we ended up waiting until almost 9pm before the hostess sat us to our table that was supposedly ""being prepared"" for us.  Um...sounds like a bunch of bull to me, but we were happy to finally sit since it was a very busy night.  The night started and ended horribly.  We were sat on two tables that were super lop-sided, that we did make a complaint.  Earlier, I asked for a booth that was right next to us, but the hostess denied my request because it was being saved for another large party that was also arriving at the same time.  That party never came.  We decided to turn our table around to help the lop-sidedness, but there was nothing that the restaurant did to rectify that problem.  Then, my mom receives cold and soggy potatoes that tasted like they totally forget to cook and was served defrosted.  They served my little niece's entree last and forgot to put the cheese in her cheeseburger order.  Our drinks kept getting confused with the tables next to us.  The manager came to apologize for the numerous mistakes happening at our table alone, and promised to comp my mom's meal since it was really bad.  We finally receive our check and then it turns out that there were a bunch of drinks that we didn't order....about $40 worth of liquor we didn't drink, plus still charging us for the promised comp meal.  The food was okay, but service altogether was extremely horrible.  Our waiter tried his best to rectify the ongoing mistakes, but it was just too much for one night where we were supposed to be celebrating my sister's birthday.  My sister and her family come here pretty often, and this has never happened before, but even they too were super disappointed with the whole evening.  It was a night of many sorries and many mistakes."
Kim G.,"El Cajon, CA",19,29,,4.0,8/26/2010,"Just had a business lunch at BJ's and I really appreciated the above average wait staff, the good mini pizza lunch, the comfy booth, and the quick service! This place is a favorite for me for business lunches in East County.  None of my customers has ever had a bad meal, and they are very attentive without being in your way. Good selection of beer too..."
