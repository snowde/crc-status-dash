King P.,"San Diego, CA",18,31,27,4.0,8/10/2013,"I like this place.  Nice place just to hang out and catch up with buds.  They got some OK beers and a nice bar with lots of flat screen TV's.  Very good pizzas, above average poke, I would order the poke again, burger was OK and the chicken wings were OK.  But the environment and beers would get me back to this joint.  Try the Lightswitch or the Blonde."
Jessica H.,"San Diego, CA",107,54,2,2.0,2/7/2012,"First off I will say the beer sampler was good! I like beer, it was beer, so it was pretty damn tough to screw up THAT part. BUT.... Took 15 minutes for our server to even notice we were there. The guy seemed new or nervous or hungover or hell I don't know. The service was awful. We ordered the veggie burger and veggie pizza, and WOW if you love food that is EXTREMELY okay tasting, then totally try these items out. I understand that this is not a restaurant that caters to vegetarians but if you're going to have vegetarian items they should at least be up to the standards of the rest of your food. The veggie burger was almost entirely rice and literally had no taste (thank heavens for onion and ketchup, I would say the cheese helped but I wasn't offered it for some reason). The veggie pizza actually tasted like something if you poured a gallon of red pepper flakes on it. I had passed this place many times and thought I'd give it a try and I really regret wasting my money here."
Shirzad F.,"San Diego, CA",116,91,27,4.0,10/12/2010,"I love the Bacon Cheeseburger pizza!!!  I recently discovered BJ's, and am hooked. the staff are very friendly and fun. Ask for Yesenia, she is the best!! I tried their spaghetti and meatballs the other night and have to say it was good, but nothing out of the ordinary.  They have phenomenal signature drinks that you should try. My favorite is the root beer with some kind of liqueur. This is a great place to have a birthday or any other celebration dinner."
Jen B.,"San Diego, CA",0,32,4,4.0,5/6/2013,"I like this place. The beer and wine are good. I always get apps for food, which are yummy. Their dessert are yummy too. The only negative thing is it is very loud very much so."
Samantha A.,"Sacramento, CA",29,29,,4.0,4/29/2012,"These stars are strictly for the delicious food...cuz let me tell you, the staff is 98% d-bags and Bs. The food keeps me coming back....not to mention the pizookie (om nom no mm mm)"
Julio L.,"El Cajon, CA",215,25,20,4.0,12/19/2012,PIZOOOOOKIE with a harvest hef after a movie makes a great dessert ending to a night.
Stephanie H.,"San Diego, CA",31,41,2,2.0,6/8/2010,"Had a horrible experience at this place. First of all, although the place is huge, there wasn't any seating anyone. Had to wait just to sit in the bar, and then waited an hour and a half for my sandwich I had ordered because the server, who must've been new, put the wrong order in. I was irritated because everyone that was with me already ate and I was still waiting for my entree when she didn't even have the decency to let me know what had happened. Meanwhile I just sat and waited- for a very long time. When I got my sandwich is was very cold, and sloppily put together. By this point I had drank way too much beer as thats all I could get the server to ever bring me- which still took her about 15 mins to get."
Cami M.,"Chula Vista, CA",14,35,,4.0,12/15/2010,Out of all the BJ's locations that I have actually been to this is by far one of the best locations. I can't begin to say enough about the Pzookie. I swear this is the whole reason that I go here is just for the Pzookie. I love the white chocolate macadamia nut or the Oatmeal Raisin with vanilla ice cream. I have wanted to try the Oreo one but not sure if my blood sugar could handle it.  Other than Pzookies the waitstaff is awesome. Which is necessary when needing to figure out what to eat and to enjoy what you have ordered. Randomly I like to choose to try other items on the menu and I always look to my server for options. Definitely worth the drive to La Mesa and since it's Christmas you can eat and then do a little shopping!!!
Dillon N.,"San Diego, CA",284,29,,5.0,10/26/2010,"I've been here a few times after ceremonies, for birthdays and on my birthday and I have to say, it is a blast. It is top dollar in terms of taste, service, and drinks! For me, I get satisfied very easily but they aim to please and they hit the bulls eye dead on. The deserts and the accommodations as well as the casual atmosphere make me feel very comfortable. I am very glad to live right by it off of Grossmont Center. I plan to go again. The menu is amazing as well! Just try anything and it's definitely going to leave a lasting impression. A good place to take a date as well :) Fantastic!"
Dorothy B.,"Santee, CA",134,108,20,4.0,2/11/2012,"this is a really good place, as far as chain restaurants go. really good variety, great beers, and HAPPY HOUR!!! i'm never disappointed in the food that i order. i've had pastas, salads, burgers, pizza, and lots of different apps - and it always comes out timely and tastes good. some of my favorites are the great white pizza (chicken and alfredo sauce on a pizza, YUM!) and the seared ahi salad...so good! some of my girlfriends and i come to happy hour frequently and they have some good food specials ($2 off appetizers and 1/2 off mini pizzas). there are different drink specials, but the one i'm most familiar with is tuesday nights when its 1/2 off ALL wine, including bottles!! we usually get the chateau st. michelle riesling which come out to $11/bottle....which is insane for wine at a restaurant. such a great deal. the reason it loses 1 star is b/c there have been an occiasion or two when i have gone, and service was not up to par to what it can usually be. infact just recently my husband and i went for dinner and sat in the bar. we sat ourselves and waited for someone to acknowledge us...about 15 minutes passed and i ended up getting a menu for us b/c nobody came over. it was about another 10 mintues before a waitress came over to take our drink order. i get it, it was busy - but at least come over to our table and let us know someone will be with us soon. it is so much worse when you just ignore your table.  anyway - i still love this place and will continue coming here!"
Christine S.,"Lemon Grove, CA",0,13,,5.0,5/3/2012,"I came here to celebrate my great friend's success at a dance performance with some grub, a little liquor and to try the rumored best dessert ever.. The pizooki. Well the 5 star is the highest  I can go.. The drinks are good and strong, meaning they don't skimp on the liquor. The food.. Delist. The stuffed mushroom appetizer.. Yum. And the pizooki... Oh my god you guys. Oh my god you guys... The pizooki... Was the best thing ever!! Toss in good company and an awesome show, could not have ended that night better!"
Jessica O.,"San Diego, CA",292,184,287,3.0,1/26/2012,"I love BJ's in La Jolla, maybe at another time I could even like this one. The waitress waited 15 minutes or more after our large party put in our order to tell me that they were out of potatoes (Which was what I ordered.) As a result, all of the people I went to dinner with, were halfway through their meal before I was even told that my food was coming up shortly. I might come back, but I will for sure steer clear of the waitress that ruined dinner for me!"
Joanna P.,"Chicago, IL",64,96,130,5.0,3/15/2010,Don't be fulled by the HAPPY HOUR! It is pricy!
Margaret W.,"Ewa Beach, HI",35,270,1,3.0,8/5/2012,"Great bar with great beer and appetizers. There is ample parking and a large outdoor seating area. I hope to come again for happy hour, but the prices are reasonable even without a discount. I loved the avocado rolls and beer sampler! There is nothing fancy about this place so if you want sophistication look elsewhere but it is a solid place for a drink and a snack."
Cycle P.,"Spring Valley, CA",31,10,9,5.0,3/22/2013,I always choose to eat here when we are looking for a place to eat.  I always order the patty melt and the nutty brewnette (one of BJ's brewed beers).  You can't go wrong with this place.  The service is always good too!
Maureen J.,"La Mesa, CA",11,44,2,5.0,9/27/2009,"My husband and I just moved into the Grossmont area and were driving around looking for a place to eat. When we passed BJ's and saw ""chicaco style pizza"" on their building, we decided to try it out and were pleasantly surprised! First, the two of us love brew houses. Though my husband was side tracked by the Guinness on tap, I had their hefeweizen. It had a wonderful citrus taste with a light, warm, bready follow up. One of my favorite house brew hef's. Very pleasant. The second time we went in I had their seasonal Oktober Fest brew. It wasn't anything special, but still very tasty. The hubs had their Tatonka stout and was not happy with the results. But after having some of their home brewed root beer, we forgave them for the lack of flavor in those two brews. On our first visit we had their ""two for $20 deal"" which gave us each a soup or salad, medium specialty pizza, and a pizzokie dessert (cookie with ice cream). It was a great deal! We had the vegetarian pizza which was the best I've had here in San Diego. Better then Oggi's by far. The crust was light, soft, and buttery and the veggies were wonderfully cooked. My husband even enjoyed it. Not to mention that their ministrone soup had big chunks of awsomeness in it! For dessert we had the cookies and cream pizzokie. The cookie was sooooooooo warm, gooey, and delicious! It was topped with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, and cookies and cream mousse. Our second visit (to watch the Bears game) I had the egg rolls which were light, crispy, and game with a sweet dipping sauce. I also had one of their well known gormet baked potatos. They are giant! I ate half of their veggie one (which came with alfredo sauce... two thumbs up!) and was pleasantly full. This place is a great stop to wach football at. Though Hooters is fun, we all know that if you wanna get in and eat and enjoy the game, you have to be there about an hour or two before the first game of the day. We would rather not deal with the crowds and the hours of waiting. This is a great alternative. Not to mention this place has the best service I ever had at a resteraunt. After the first visit I thought it was just a fluke, but they proved me wrong. The staff is so friendly, fun to talk to, and very attentive."
Paul D.,"El Cajon, CA",11,10,194,2.0,5/12/2012,Service blew chimp. Took 40 minutes to get our order. And it was still wrong. The food was uninspired and uneventful and did I mention cold.
William U.,"San Diego, CA",69,115,9,4.0,8/21/2010,"Again, as ""anti-chain"" as I can be, I can't deny loving BJ's.  I've been coming to this location since I first moved to San Diego 10 years ago, and even now, I never turn down an opportunity to return. So many delicious choices, from Deep Dish Pizzas, to Grilled Chicken Pasta, to my favorite, the Parmesean Crusted Chicken with white cheddar mashed potatoes... BJ's is just a fun place to come with some friends or family for a non-stuffy delicious meal, throw back a couple of tasty craft beers, and if you're smart enough, save room for a delicious pizookie!"
Johnny D.,"San Diego, CA",0,50,,3.0,3/10/2013,I give the food 2 stars but the service is excellent. Place is also very good.  This place used have great food few years back.  Food is not fresh and tastes very manufactured.
Joe U.,"El Cajon, CA",20,17,,4.0,8/3/2009,"Are you a sea food connoiseur? well if you like clam chowder in particular you will definitely have to try bj's delectably enticing clam chowder in a bread bowl!  I have tried other dishes but this particular dish is the reason why I return time and time again. I've tried all kinds of clam chowder and this tops the list!  not too expensive, nice little environment and usually pretty good service. damn! now I'm hungry. ugh!"
