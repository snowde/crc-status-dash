Sarah L.,"San Francisco, CA",61,56,32,2.0,9/10/2013,"Ate here tonight for my birthday, only two of us. Less than I expected. Started off pleasantly. We were seated promptly, then a bright smiling waitress took our drink and appetizer orders. She then informed us she was going on her dinner date and Trevor would be taking over. Seemed a normal thing. We promptly got our root beer and waited eons for my Berry Burst Cider. Another table beyond us, large party arrived after us, had already received all their bar drinks before us. I stopped Trevor as he finished orders at another table and said I think my Cider was forgotten about. He then brought it in a jiffy. I ordered blackened salmon without the sauce due to an allergy. Trevor said he understood and he made the blackened style recommendation too. Food came a reasonable time later. To my dismay, the salmon was covered in the sauce along with the vegetables. *Sigh. Sent it back and the person said she'd tell my waiter. He came and apologized, along with shortly after a gentleman in an olive shirt and tie that didn't identify himself. Waited another ten minutes, food came and was correct this time thankfully. Dress shirt and tie guy came back to check, still didn't know his name or position. By now I was starving and the rest in my party had finished her salad already so I was eating my salmon alone. Desert was correct too. Check came, I honestly expected a discount on my salmon snafu, since I had taken the time to be meticulous about its preparation and my allergy, received confirmation and yet it was still wrong. No discount. I tipped 10%, out of kindness. It didn't meet my expectations and I'm not sure I'll be back, too bad because I'm a local and loooove their berry burst cider. A small discount on my salmon would've completely turned around my opinion, yet that didn't happen. Did I meet the manager, who knows."
Jennifer W.,"Murrieta, CA",211,267,231,4.0,11/4/2011,"Great lunch specials, and I absolutely love their Tomato Bisque soup! You get a big portion for what you pay for. We sat on the patio, and our waitress was really nice, and had a huge smile on her face everytime she checked up on us. When our food came out, my soup wasn't as hot (temperature wise) as I would have liked it, but it still tasted delicious. My boyfriend seemed to enjoy his California Chicken sandwich, and thin cut fries. To end our meal we got a Red Velvet Pizookie. It was so good! I like this location, but parking can be lame since it's right across the parking lot from a mall."
Oanh L.,"San Jose, CA",264,251,73,4.0,7/29/2009,"for a chain restaurant, i really like BJ's! their pizza is yummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmo. and the best best best best best part? half off all their personal size pizzas after 10pm and 2 dollar off appetizers. my favorite pizzas are the BJ's favorite (think of this as combo/supreme) and Buffalo Chicken. last time me and a girlfriend got their bruschetta and it was fresh, light, and a great way to help stretch your stomache a little before you get the pizzas . damn you La Jolla location for not having a bar (no happy hour). dont worry about ordering too much, reheating it in your toaster oven until its crispy.. tastes even better. i will come back soon for their hyped up baked potatoes."
Bob W.,"El Cajon, CA",4,99,9,1.0,2/7/2012,"Ate here three times and was not impressed.  The first time was at lunch some lazy Sunday.  I ordered the turkey sandwich.  When it arrived it has two thin slices of meat and not much else.  I asked if that was all I got and she said yes then dissapeared for the rest of the visit until she brought the check.  The second time I had a pizza that was seriously lacking both substance and flavor.  The third time was a steak.  Cheap piece of meat and overcooked at that.  how do these lackies get jobs in the kitchen anyway?  No wonder they're paid minimum wage (or less).  Anyway, haven't been since and will never go back unless I'm craving a pizookie (white chocolate with vanilla ice cream please)."
Ryan L.,"San Diego, CA",3,12,,4.0,11/12/2010,"We ordered a split pizza, one half Southwestern style, the other half bacon cheeseburger.  Although the largest size was a little small it was SUPER yummy!  The bacon cheeseburger side tasted similar to an In-N-Out burger and the Southwestern was equally as tasty.  I would definitely recommend either of these pizzas, but just note that the large size is only big enough for about 2 people. Our waitress kept our glasses full and was very friendly as well!"
Kalyan P.,"San Diego, CA",11,51,,5.0,9/8/2009,"Love the mini pizzas and the Happy Hour 1/2 off on mini pizzas is outstanding. Their beer is very good, IMO this place is what Gordon Biersch wishes it could be. Pizza is amazing and the beer is good. Never had a problem with the service. If you're a single guy, you'll love their waitresses and waitstaff, they're beautiful.  Have a great time at BJs, sit down for a beer or two and have a pizza. Their entrees are pretty darn good as well, back when I ate meat I constantly craved the Blackened Chicken Fettucine Alfredo.  The Avocado Egg Rolls are also to die for.  Sit outside on the patio or sit in the bar, the service will be exceptional regardless of where you sit. While you wait for your entrees order some wedge cut fries: very tasty."
Niki L.,"Austin, TX",95,104,23,4.0,3/10/2010,"We went here the other day to grab a quick snack. I wasn't excited but if it wasn't for the fact that it was a brewery, I wouldn't have wanted to stay for ambiance alone. It reminded me of a fancier oversized TGIF's... There was nothing amazing about the food but in all fairness we only ordered 6 appetizers and a Pizookie. It was all good. I got one of their beers (Pirahna Pale Ale ) which made me give this place an extra star. The service was OK, the hostess got hit up by my fashion designer friend to be a model, and we all had a good time shoving our mouths full of mediocre fried foods. All in all a good day."
Angela M.,"Manhattan, NY",162,135,1,4.0,11/9/2009,"Ok, I admit it....I initially decided to go here because the name made me giggle. Getting that out of the way...I left this place giggling too...like a happy fat kid. It was good.  I went for a late lunch and got the 1/2 sandwich and salad combo. I opted for the BBQ chicken sandwich and the Ceasar salad, The service was super quick and the portions were perfect. Actually, I wished they would have been smaller so I would of had room for the Pzookie that all the kids are talking about.  I guess I will just have to go back...and with service and food as good as theirs, I most definitely will!"
Pj B.,"Imperial Beach, CA",141,277,1,4.0,4/28/2010,"TWO words... STUFFED POTATO! WTF.. that's a dinner all by its self.  I have had all of them, not at once mind you i can hardly finish one on my own and I'm a big ass dude. ANYWAYS the appetizers i have had there (don't remember them all ) have been good as hell and the beer, freaking awesome. I have yet to peep just the bar area, but maybe soon enough. A really good place to get some good food that's for sure."
Yvette L.,"Lakeside, CA",27,9,1,3.0,10/24/2012,"Foods good! Don't sit on the patio unless you don't mind the temperature outside. The wait staff kept passing thru and leaving the door open and it was freezing outside - not too considerate.  There seemed to be plenty of room inside the restaurant but they put us out there, we were celebrating my mom-in-laws birthday. If the food wasn't good then there would only be beer to redeem this place."
Brian R.,"San Diego, CA",201,215,29,4.0,7/30/2009,"I went to Grossmont center lookin' to waste time and ended up gettin' some BJ's. I'm never one to turn down a BJ when I see it so I had to check it out. I slid in and got comfortable. I knew that this was a good BJ so I wanted to be prepared for the long haul. While I waited, I had a nice Jeremiah Red (beer) to keep me busy. I mean whats better than BJ's and a beer!? The staff was great they. They waited on me hand and foot and...and they made sure I was pampered. Y'know, treated the way I wanted to be treated. This BJ was very good considering the BJ's I had dealt with before. I'd come back here for BJ's anytime. The service was quick and I was able to finish for what I paid. What can I say other than I'm a fan of BJ's..."
Alyssa G.,"San Diego, CA",148,174,483,4.0,4/21/2010,"My favorite part of this BJ's?  THE BAR!  I like that it's kept separate from the rest of the restaurant.. just enough distance so there's no b*tchin about bar patrons getting too loud over the game.  Granted, it gets pretty loud in the main dining area too.  Hypocrites! ;P Service is usually good but don't expect VIP treatment.. it gets pretty busy after 6PM.  And service on the patio is iffy. They could use more TV screens, or at least install larger ones, in the main dining area, and the patio doesn't have any at all.  But I guess you'll just have to deal with the view through their windows.  Boo."
Mike M.,"El Cajon, CA",97,106,,3.0,6/27/2014,"Had it not been for the hostess Rebekah's great service at the door and my waiter Ryan I would not be back,. First way too loud for me, 200 people all talking at once and yelling to be louder than the next table. I looked up the menu in advance, go to order the Chicken Fried Steak and told they do not carry it on the menu in California AFTER Ryans checks on why I saw it online. Doesnt sell. May be because they have way too many menu items and customers could not find it. I Get Chicken Fried Steak across the parking lot at Claim Jumpers and they tell me it is a hot item, go figure. So I Ryan being great as he was  made some recommendations but I opted for an new item, an 8 oz Sirloin not bad price 13.99 I think. First thing wrong was it was cooked medium instead of medium rare, barely pink, I can deal with that. For the first time in 30 years in San Diego eating a steak I used steak sauce. A1  never ever at any other place have I used any. Steak had no flavor what so ever  As I said Rebekah and Ryan would be the only reasons to come back but wait.  I sent a complaint to the BJ Customer service on line. I got no response. No Phone call or email from Customer Service, No GM's call to see what was wrong with my meal nothing, and nothing to indicate they let Rebekah and Ryan know they received a compliment  Wow the onoy good thing I have to say about them and they dont let the employees know they got a compliment  Amazing Now I know I will not be back"
R M.,"San Diego, CA",5,81,50,2.0,5/11/2012,"I've eaten at other BJ's Restaurants all over California, but this was the first and possibly last time at this location.  First impression, the noise, very loud but I was sort of expecting it as other locations are about the same.  As a party of 2 we were seated pretty quickly, especially for a Friday evening.    BJs is pretty much known for their deep dish pizzas but I thought I'd stray from that this one time.  I got the sirloin/lobster combo special fully aware that it was only $21 and well.. this is BJs, not a steakhouse.  Got a house salad with the deal as well but it was pretty bad.  Not fresh at all.  The steak was pretty much on par with buffet steak.  Kinda bland (had to add some salt) but it was cooked as requested.  The lobster tail was a puny dried out 3 or 4 ouncer.  This came with a side of green beans and mashed potatoes.  The mashed potatoes were decent but the beans were tough and were probably old.  Overall, both the steak and lobster were edible but they reinforced the the old saying ""You get what you pay for"".  Also, I was expecting to get a little bit of drawn butter with the tail but got nothing.  We asked the waitress for butter and she returned with a little dollop of butter that you'd normally spread on bread.  I didn't even bother to say anything because it was time to cut our losses and GTFO (Google it).  Oh speaking of bread, you don't even get that here. So... moral of the story.. if you ever get dragged to BJs for a B-day or some other random celebration, just get the pizza.  Hopefully they don't screw that up! One last thing, the parking here sucks."
Cynthia C.,"La Mesa, CA",272,209,194,4.0,6/16/2009,"I really enjoy coming here but have decided that if you're looking to have a decent conversation with someone this is not the place to be. Last time I visited was a Friday night, met some friends for some drinks. I love their drinks but only because you can't really taste the alcohol which probably means you're getting just a little ripped off. I would say 1/10 alcohol, the rest juice??? I spent the whole time either yelling so they could here me or leaning over like an elder because I could not hear a thing! BUT they have some good pizza here. Wow I'm such a sucker for that cheesy greasy goodness. Their minestrone is decent as well. Nice place to come and have some fun."
Odie O.,"San Diego, CA",2,1003,63,3.0,2/28/2010,I really didn't care for the atmosphere or the food at all but I've been here a couple times to eat and drink with people who wanted to go here as there was nowhere else to really go in La Mesa. I really didn't care for their chips and dip nor their pizza and would not bother to go back again as it was only OK and reminded me too much of a typical California type restaurant like California Pizza or Chilis.
Alan B.,"San Diego, CA",1009,454,829,4.0,2/21/2010,"This restaurant has been a family favorite since 2002, and we always order the same thing...Spinach artichoke dip, BJ's favorite, Mandarin orange salad, and the pizookie.  They never get old, but I've tried about 75% of the menu items and I can't steer away from our faves."
Nichole W.,"San Diego, CA",74,21,,4.0,9/2/2012,Good place to go with a group of people...especially if you have kids with you.  It's noisy enough that the kids don't make too much of a distraction.  My bridal party and I went here after shopping for a wedding dress in the La Mesa area...it was perfect.
Bob B.,"El Cajon, CA",1,6,,3.0,6/6/2014,Food is good. Service is slooowwww. Wait for server. Wait for food. Wait for check. Don't go if you have somewhere to be.
Pete C.,"San Diego, CA",232,167,98,4.0,5/13/2011,"I LOVE BJ's.....the Brewhouse and Restaurant you sick freaky Yelpers, get that nastiness out of your head right now!!! This place is crackin from their own handcrafted beer AND root beer to the pizzas, salads, and of course......the PIZOOKIES!!! Remember pizza + cookie = pizookie and my favorite is the white choc. macademian nut....Mmmmmm. Here are some of my fav. entrees at BJs: Appetizer, spin and art dip pure awesomeness. I would gouge my eyes out if I could have a BBQ Chix Chop Salad or the Honey Crisp Chix salad everyday of my life. You can't go wrong with the BBQ ranch dressing the chop salad, and the freshness of the lettuce, tom, and almonds with honey mustard dressing in the Honey Crisp Salad. You can even get lunch size portions too! Sourdough Burger all the way friends, you can't go wrong with sourdough bread, 1000 dressing, lett, tom., paired with crispy thin or wedge cut fries. Def. a fan of the country fried steak, although hearty, but satisfying. And also a fan of the pot roast, one of the best comfort food menu items at this place!! I do have to say that the customer service....is annoying! Now hold on, hold on, I said!!! I don't have problems with their customer service, in fact the service here is on point. What's annoying are the things they have to say when they greet their guests! I don't want to be bombarded with beer options, appetizers suggestions, and asking if we've made our ""selections"" all in the first greeting! These are servers who work hard for their money, not ROBOTS! It's the one thing about corporate restaurants that I do not like. But I get it, some people don't know about anything that is offered at BJs, but MOST people have some inkling of what they would want in a restaurant, so LAY OFF ON YOUR WORKERBEES CORPORATE! Overall, a place for any event in your life with good food, beer, and environment! SYU states ""Wow, I love this place...not all the time, but when I feel like it, how about you, do you love it, are you Wowed?!??! Where am I going with this?"" pom pom"
