Kari S.,"San Diego, CA",155,224,180,4.0,2/18/2010,"I love BJ's! My friend and I were out for a girls sneak away for the evening and couldn't figure out where we wanted to eat. Some quick thinking was done and we ended up at BJ's in Grossmont Center. Of course, because it was just the 2 of us we decided to sit in the bar area.  I love the fact that I could order an ice tea, side salad, and the super healthy grilled shrimp taco plate and walk out for $15.00. Good food, good company, and a good place always makes for an eventful night."
Matthew S.,"Hartford County, CT",20,134,36,4.0,3/16/2010,"Yummmmmmmmm. We headed out here a few days ago and I wasn't sure what to expect.  Verdict? I have never been in a pizza brewery as nice as this.  The decor is impressive.  Very spacious with a huge bar.  The bar has a selection of bottled beer which is second tro none.  Chimay, Chimay Special, Lambics, and the liquor options are broad enough to fill the desires of even the pickiest Yelpers. But even better than the bottled beers are the beers brewed for BJ's which are served via taps.  We had their special IPA, which I HIGHLY recommend.  Also, not being a fan of red beers, theirs is very good and easily the best red I have ever had. For food I got the lunch special personal pizza with caesar salad.  Salad was average.  Pizza was super good with a Chicago style doughy crust which was soft and delicious.  As a fan of thin crust, this was really good. Service was superior.  Our bartender/server, Valerie, was the best I've ever encountered.  The perfect blend of freindliness and professionalism. -1 star because of the corporate atmosphere.  Although I see the purpose of consistency, I prefer my five-star experiences to be slightly rough around the edges.   Regardless of that, I'll be back.  And hopefully Valerie and an ice cold IPA will be there waiting for me!"
Elizabeth K.,"La Mesa, CA",67,71,66,2.0,2/16/2012,"Well...I will go to BJ's for beer or a few appetizers. I agree with the other reviews, service is lacking. I have only sat at the bar area and it takes some time to get service there it seems. One time I actually came here on a date and was sitting next to to women. They were in deep conversation with the bartender (slowing down our drinks) and their conversation became so comical that my date and I were mocking them while listening to the ridiculous conversation...not long after the bartender came around from behind the bar to give one of the girls a massage! Oh it just got weird. But overall service is slow in the bar and I usually stick to beer because their cocktails usually taste like pure sugar."
Jennifer R.,"San Diego, CA",13,25,,4.0,7/18/2012,"The mahi mahi with fried rice was low-cal and absolutely yummy! There were lots of other delicious sounding items on the menu which I would love to try on my next visit. We had to sit on the patio because we were a party of nine, which was very hot (no a/c). Next time I go to BJ's I plan to sit inside. Parking is terrible. Plan to circle the lot many times."
Bethany B.,"La Mesa, CA",34,24,5,5.0,9/3/2009,"I LOVE this place. I've been to other locations and they would only get 3.5 stars.  The service here is always great. Especially if you sit in the bar area- Brian is amazing every time!   The beer (I like Nutty Brunette) and drinks (honey likes the Mojitos) are always delish, and cheaper if you go for happy hour.  Our faves: Parmesan Crusted Chicken (get double mashed potatoes; the steamed veggies are 'meh;' and get the mushroom gravy for them- you'll be glad you asked!) with extra of the de-licious lemon butter sauce, or the Pot Roast Sandwich (much better with double mashed potatoes- on the side instead of on the sandwich.) Pizookies are always good- I never have room after the yummy dinner though! Their appetizer pizzas are also pretty danky.  Always a good go-to. Take out is always made right and packaged neatly too."
Jess H.,"Los Angeles, CA",70,148,64,4.0,5/20/2009,"I LOVE BJ'S!!  (^_^) I've been here quite a few times with friends, co-workers, celebrating special occasions...etc...It's an upbeat and hoppin place to be, There's music, TV's, a Bar - its a fun place to meet up with friends, get your drink on, enjoy some appetisers and have a good time. One of my co-workers warned me about their Spinach & Artichoke Dip. She said it was AMAZING and one of the only things she'll order when she goes to BJ's. She's a tiny girl - probably 5'4 and 98lbs, and she doesn't care if she looks like a pig eating an entire bowl of this dip by herself! If you haven't tried their Spinach & Artichoke Dip - You Must! It's the best anywhere and one of the only things you'll want to eat! When not eating their Spinach & Artichoke Dip, or recommending others to try it, I've had their BBQ Chicken Pizza, it was also really friggin good!  Next on the List: Gotta try those Pizookie's everyone's talking about, I've always been too full!"
A C.,"San Diego, CA",67,4,,1.0,9/19/2012,"We had a horrible experience at this restaurant....twice. Unluckily, we got the same waitress both nights. The first night she was not terrible, but not good. Last night, it was so bad that I almost walked out. I do not undertip and I respect waitstaff, because I put myself through college as a waitress. However, this was horrible. Both times, we had some sort of issue, and NEITHER time did we get to talk to a manager about it. The smell in the bar/kitchen area is overwhelming. So much that we couldn't eat anywhere near them. Last night we got sat away from those areas. However, from the second we got there, it took about 10 minutes for a waiter to come take our drink order.  Now, I understand people get in the weeds and need help. So, he was helping our waitress, got our drink orders and brought them to us. Then, from the time we got our drinks to the time we ordered, it was about 20 minutes. And not once did we get a ""i'll be right with you"". Then, 35 minutes later our 1 flatbread pizza and 1 pasta dish.....(seriously) came out. My husband ordered a Jumbalaya dish that was super spicy. We had our waitress walk by about 3 times before she offered a drink refill (and it was out). So, he stopped eating because he needed a drink. Then she grabbed his glass, took another tables order, put that in, came back with a check for another table, gave them to go boxes, grabbed more to go boxes and boxed up their pizza for them, then went and got their check, grabbed the other tables credit card/check...ALL WHILE HOLDING HIS GLASS. So, 10 minutes later, his food was cold and he still didn't have a drink. Needless to say, our appetites were ruined, and the entire experience was awful.  The food was not horrible, but my order was incorrect, and for the sake of time, I didn't send it back. It was mediocre at best though. Overall, if you want a busy, lackluster experience, here's your place. If not, stay away. There are like 10 other BJ's in San Diego. The time you spend driving, you'll save in waiting on food."
Megan T.,"San Diego, CA",0,6,,5.0,11/29/2012,"I love this restaurant.  I love the avocado eggrolls and crisp potato skin there :)  I don't care much for the buffalo wings though.  I also love their beer.  The service is good.  I love the atmosphere.  The wait can be a little long , about 30 mins, on the weekend."
Enrique R.,"Chula Vista, CA",2,30,7,4.0,1/27/2010,"I love this place for its great Deep Dish Pizzas, beers, and Salad.  When we eat here we (A family of 4 and a baby ) usually always get : A deep dish pizza (GREAT WHITE®, or SPINACH & ARTICHOKE (our favorite), or BJ'S FAVORITE) with a large italian chopped salad, and top it off with a BJ'S FAMOUS PIZOOKIE!   I also like to get a beer sampler for me and Pear Cider for my wife. This is the life!!!!"
Jeffery A.,"La Mesa, CA",53,48,6,3.0,4/9/2012,"Always greeted with a friendly smile! The staff is always up beat and happy. Food is always good. The only thing I can say that is so so is the speed of service, been here a lot and sometimes it's great and others it's slow."
Brad O.,"Santee, CA",0,2,,1.0,9/15/2013,"Have been to B Js in several different cities. Have always had good service, decent food and cold beer.  Went to the La Mesa store this afternoon.  Terrible service, came in, put our name in, waited just a few minutes to be seated, all was good.  We waited and waited and waited, no server, no nothing for 15 minutes, finally we got up, went to the front desk and let them know we were leaving.  The whole attitude was one of who cares."
Chris D.,"Chicago, IL",0,152,,4.0,8/15/2012,"2nd time I have been here. It's definitely gotten better. :) Very laid back atmosphere. Good service. Great drinks. Sports on TV. Great food (huge portions, and the fries are awesome!!). Hey, all just what a growing man needs to stay happy. :)"
Mark L.,"San Diego, CA",462,244,87,5.0,12/23/2009,"One of the nicest BJ's i've been to in California. Like my previous BJ's review in San Bruno, the best stuff about BJ's is their late happy hours that are great for folks that are up hella late, need a break, and the afternoon hours for happy hour are too early. Come here to relax, enjoy some cheaper prices for beer and food and go home happy!"
Corey H.,"El Cajon, CA",57,195,37,3.0,8/7/2009,"I've been here a few times now so I think i can give an accurate review. The micro beers are really good. The first few times i went to this place, everything was awesome from the food to the service.  The last time I went wasn't so good. I went for lunch and I ordered a medium pizza and my friend ordered the cobb salad. My pizza came, and it was the size of a tiny personal pizza, so much for taking any home. There was barly any sauce on it so this wasn't a good pizza. They brought my friend the half cobb instead of the full even though he clearly stated he wanted the full. They took the salad back and so I waited to eat my pizza. I asked if they would want to take the pizza back and place it under the heat lamps to keep it warm but they insisted that it would be fine. By the time the salad came back out, 5 minutes later, my pizza was getting cold. They didn't really appologize nor did they offer to give us a discount. I was very unhappy with this."
Dustin R.,"Berkeley, CA",6,25,,3.0,6/2/2010,"good pizza, but slightly buttery greasy, and somewhat pricey.  Still, if you have never had Bj's before, you MUST try it. if your lookin to save some money, you should go during happy hour. pizza is good, other menu items are hit or miss. best thing about this place (besides the beer) is the PAZOOKIE."
Frank C.,"Jackson, OH",6,17,,4.0,3/30/2012,"Since living in La Mesa, I've frequented the Bj's brewery somewhere close to 15 times. Out of those times I've only actually waited to be seated 4, with wait times varying from 5-30 minutes. So, I can't add much input on how quick you are to get seated. I usually just drift over I the open seating bar area. Never have i had trouble finding a seat there with a party size of 2-4.  The customer service is spectacular. Maybe it's because I'm so good looking ;-) but, I always get greeted and treated like I'm at Hooters! The bartenders and waiters/waitresses are second to none. Smiles from the time I sit down until the time I sneak out after leaving my cell number on the receipt along with a MUAH! And a generous tip. =) Any place with a menu that is 10 pages long, with 5 of those pages consisting of just mixed drinks(which are amazing and a wide variety), wines, and craft(A++) domestic, and imported beers, is always a winner in my book! I've yet to have a bad meal here. This would be 5 stars if the jambalaya would have been more spicy. I enjoyed it but, if a guy from the great state of Ohio says it needs more spice, then it needs more spice! Other than that, this is a great place to go sit at the bar watch a ball game and relax with friends!! Love me some Bj's!"
Bobbi S.,"San Diego, CA",1,24,3,1.0,2/11/2013,"Actually I was a little disappointed in this place. The pizza was just OK and pricey for a ""small"" medium! We had the new chicken bacon. Now the most imprtant part! My sis and I shared a pitcher of their blonde beer and it was reallllly light! A bit too lite like a bud light. Not the best for a ""craft"" beer! Now on the other hand we were still able to drink more so we had a taste of the porter and IPA. The IPA was awesome, but the porter was terrible. So, we both had a ""pint"" of the IPa. I have been to many breweries/pubs etc. and I can tell you right now their ""own"" beer glasses are NOT 16oz. On the menu they are advertising a pint, so we asked our waiter to bring us a ""real"" pint glass (almost the size of their water glasses) but he said that our glass was a pint and the water glasses were 18 oz. The beers they brew are in a diiferent glass than their ""guest"" beers which we saw and again definitely not 16 oz. I say they are 12 oz at best! Shame on such a brewery!!   I guess I wont be going back unless I can bring my own pint glass! and not for the porter!"
B J.,"San Diego, CA",23,22,,4.0,3/20/2012,I LOVE BJs. This location is always busy at nights so there is usually a wait but its well worth it. The food is great and the service is great. ONe thing that stood out to me was when my boyfriend and I had a 30 minute wait along with about 20 other people. The restaraunt was courteous enough to give samples of pizza to everyone while we waited. The best thing about this place to me is their homemade root beer. Yum Yum Yum.
Mitzi T.,"San Diego, CA",76,24,17,1.0,9/19/2013,ok first of all this is where my friends took me for my birthday. it was my first time there i was excited. but the moment we get there we were rushed to the bar?? idk why because we wanted a big table for the group but we figured that where they wanted us ok.. and it gets worse we get rushed every min by a waitress name karolyn.. we order and SNATCHED!! the menus like seriously! anyway.. she then gets our order wrong.. but we told her it was wrong gave us a look like she didnt care but we told her we would eat it because we dont like to waste food..then wen we are about to pay and im gather everybodys money she comes and SNATCHES1!! again!! with the bill seriously this will be my first and LAST visit at BJs! the only person we enjoyed having around was the bartender he was very polite
Joshua M.,"San Diego, CA",204,1480,170,4.0,11/13/2011,"Despite how noisy the bar is, the happy hour here is pretty good.  Personal pizzas are tasty and their homemade rootbeer is a worthy contender."
