Maira B.,"La Mesa, CA",2,35,27,5.0,8/2/2017,Came in for lunch and went to bar area.. pretty busy lunch rush but server JESSICA was super friendly fast and efficient. Let me know about lunch specials and new beers and drinks.... though I had work and couldn't have any alcohol it made me crave some for a later time. I ordered a lettuce wrapped turkey burger with a side salad ... it was pretty good! Turkey had lots of flavor and fresh ingredients. Jessica didn't come over every second and still was able to see when I needed a refill on my green tea or looked like I needed something. That is a quality a great server has! I will be coming back to this location. Thank you JESSICA for making my lunch at a busy restaurant an easy and delicious experience!
Johnny G.,"Rio Rancho, NM",6,108,7,1.0,1/18/2017,If I had to pick between this BJ's restaurant and eating next door at the Mexican joint I'd go to the Mexican spot everytime.  Food is the same old bland corporate bs that proves they don't care and the staff follows suit.  Server and Bartender acted like we were taking their free time away by being there to enjoy the food and drinks.  Wont be back to nom nom nom anytime soon.
Franco C.,"Mission Valley, San Diego, CA",44,103,8,3.0,1/24/2017,"I hadn't been here for about 12 years. It's definitely changed, more for the good.  We came here last night for dinner. My fiance had the salmon and I ended up having a dessert. The salmon was very good. The asparagus was awful. My fiance almost choked on it. It was inedible.  The sangria she had was to die for. She said she finally found a place that knows how to make one.  My dessert was so so. Although the vanilla bean ice cream was amazing.  Our service was excellent. Very courteous waiter and didn't forget about us ever.  We will come back and try other things."
Sharon H.,"Temecula, CA",40,15,3,5.0,4/12/2017,"Normally I love coming to this BJs. I drive down from Temecula. I always order my usual. Seared Ahi Salad. Today was no different. Pure perfection. The reason for my 4 stars is because my Date was freezing. We asked our server at least two times to turn down the air conditioning. I had goosebumps as well. Still freezing, my mom had to order hot tea to warm herself up. Adding insult to injury, we were charged $2.95 for her iced tea and another $2.95 for the hot one. Update:  Just a few hours after I posted this review, BJs General Manager contacted me. He was very apologetic about the cold temperature situation. This was part of his response:   Thank you so much for the reply, I apologize again about the temperature. I know it's not at all comfortable when you are trying to eat and enjoy a meal and you're cold. I forwarded you're yelp review to my management team. Please tell your mother I apologize as well."
Juliana E.,"San Diego, CA",41,57,5,1.0,1/3/2017,Panda express could of done a better job... Don't trust their take out unless you want to sit there and inspect every container... I have a sick child at home and wanted to skip cooking diner... Thanks BJ's I still had to cook because the crap food went straight into the trash... Also the avocado egg rolls were all the way brown by the time we got home... Fresh cut avocado shouldn't be turning brown that quick... The drinks were watered down... Huge disappointment...
Denise F.,"San Diego, CA",14,13,,5.0,11/7/2017,"Good customer service is hard to find but great customer service is even harder, The experience I had last night was awesome. Toby C. did a great job of taking care of me and my party and had a great attitude. It was truly a pleasureful experience and oh ya the food was great too!"
Jason W.,"Lakeside, CA",11,64,,5.0,7/12/2017,Large selection of food and drinks. Prices are on the higher side but the food is delicious. We tried both types of steaks and the ribs. All were delicious. The cheese potatoes are a really good side. A little too salty but still tasty. We had a white chocolate macadamia nut pizookie for dessert and it was awesome. The service was amazing. We will definitely be coming back.
Tom S.,"El Cajon, CA",0,19,,5.0,8/14/2017,"I do not write reviews of chains, as a rule.  However, this restaurant is consistently outstanding.  Despite the fact the restaurant normally has large crowds (gee, wonder why?), they provide tremendous service and their wait staff is spectacular.  Always friendly and attentive, without being overbearing.  They also have some great budget savings specials that are tasty and (relatively) easy on the wallet. Like many these days, I tend to shy away from red meat.  That said, their prime rib special (weekends, check it out) is a cut above.  Pun intended.  One plate, with sides, easily serves two! My wife and I go at least once a month.  Give it a shot - but be prepared for some parking challlenges, depending on when you go.  It is Grossmont Center, after all."
Mike W.,"Lemon Grove, CA",0,7,,5.0,10/25/2017,"We are regulars on Thursday night for the ribs and Pazookie special.  It is my favorite meal in town.  On our last visit on October 19, we had the absolute best service ever from our waiter Toby.  For a chain restaurant, this place truly has their stuff together.  It is consistently excellent, and I can't wait until tomorrow, which is Thursday again!"
Linda W.,"San Diego, CA",0,6,,2.0,11/3/2017,Just finish eating here at BJ's food was OK but service was horrible. It  took forever just to order drinks . It took even longer just to pay my bill. It was extremely busy but I still feel that service could've been better.
Jazmin E.,"Spring Valley, CA",0,11,2,2.0,11/7/2016,"Our family has been coming to this restaurant for Friday night dinners for months now, not every Friday but enough because  the food is good, and usually the customer service is also. But this passed Friday we went to celebrate our friends bday, I called in advance because we were a very large party (18 people). They made the reservations no problem, we arrived alittle early just so we all were ready when they called us that our table was ready. Our Reservation was at 830, I went in about 8:15 or so just to let them know we were here just hanging out outside so they didnt think we didnt show up.  I knew we were a large party so I was not stressing on them seating us at EXACTLY 830 but roughly around it would have been nice. 8:45 rolls around i go inside and just ask what the status was on our table. one of the hostess informed me that they were just setting up the table for us. and she would come on out and get us as soon as they were done. Few minutes went by and they came and got us.  Sat down, and a waitress immediately started taking our drink orders. I thought wow thats awesome. After taking our drinks it took her FOREVER to bring us the drinks,and when she did some of the sodas were watered down almost like they were served and sat ona counter for a bit before she brought them to our table. I get it its one of her 18 of us. But i mean dont they know how to pace their time? this is what she does for a living? we couldnt have been her first LARGE party table before. Ask for help? I say this only because the resturant by this time was not busy  where i dont know why she didnt get help.  There was a bus boy which i wish i remembered his name seemed to be the one helping us with our needs because our waitress was no where to be found. he came and removed plates, gave us refills. at one point we asked out waitress several times for Napkins and silverware there were NONE on the table. when we sat down. then some other girl heard that we needed silverware and started to bring some over. I guess she ran out and said she would be back with more. She disappeared also, and when i seen her standing near our table she was on her phone.  all in all, the food was great but the service was the worst i have every experienced before. I am VERY disappointed."
Destiny R.,"San Diego, CA",53,4,,5.0,7/17/2017,"We were one of Davis's last tables of the night. We walked in with a group of 10 people and he did an amazing job of being timely, attentive and FREAKIN AWESOME! He had the best attitude and was just really good at his job. I am big on great customer service, and Davis really embodies that. Thanks again!"
Benjamin P.,"San Diego, CA",93,135,129,4.0,5/28/2016,We come here often for several options for our picky kids. Gluten free pizzas. Sliders. Salads. And even tasty desserts. Enjoy!
Linda J.,"San Diego, CA",738,911,4236,4.0,3/10/2016,"Went to BJ's last night for the first time to have dinner with a friend. I was kind of surprised at how large this place really was it didn't look that big from the outside. We were created and sat in a booth seat at the window with in less than 8 minutes. Our server Lily was absolutely adorable. We ordered crunchy fried artichokes, calamari, a chicken Caesar salad, and a Ahi salad with Romaine lettuce. All of the food was delicious and priced at a good price. The waitresses and waiters we're all very friendly and double checking on each other's tables. I felt like a truly valued customer. I had a great experience and I would definitely come back here again. The prices are on the picture that I posted so go check them out. And if you come here to this place no it's not just a regular burger joint and I hear they have great beer. Thanks Lily for having such great customer service!"
Melissa M.,"San Diego, CA",189,10,,3.0,7/2/2017,"Service is normally great, but the kitchen takes waaay too long. All the time. If you like waiting 45 to and hour for your food, perfect place for you."
Valerie D.,"Elk Grove, CA",331,57,26,1.0,3/23/2016,Got there waited for my food for 30-40 minutes then waited for my soda then never saw the waiter until 30 minutes later!!!! Ordered steak didn't even offer us sauce then when we asked it took him 20 minutes to give us the empty ass bottle. Then he Said he was gonna refill our yeah been 30 more minutes he is still not here I'm writing it while I'm here been here since 9:30 it's 10:51pm Had to pour my own water because our waiter ditched us with the pitcher and when he came back 30 minutes later with our pizookie out icecream was super melted
Marissa P.,"Lakeside, CA",103,46,,5.0,6/10/2017,I love their avocado rolls and buffalo pizza the most! I've never had a bad meal here. Drinks are usually strong and get the job done :) pazooki is a must at the end! Can't go wrong with chocolate chip!
Jennifer B.,"San Diego, CA",19,16,1,5.0,10/1/2017,"We came in with a large group and the manager was so accommodating and sat us in less than 15 minutes. Our waitress, Jaquetta, was the sweetest! She was attentive and had an amazing attitude the entire time we were there (2 1/2 hours). Thank you!"
Steph B.,"San Diego, CA",2,16,2,4.0,12/3/2016,An hour and a half after reservation time and we are still waiting..... several parties continue to be seated..... I hope the food is better than this initial wait Thank you for the appetizers and the quick response! Everyone in our party enjoyed their meal and the service we received after being seated was top notch.
Lisa B.,"San Diego, CA",0,4,1,1.0,10/7/2017,"This restaurant has gone completely down hill. We have been eating here for years, and it was always good although a bit over pricey..we didn't mind..the last couple of times though, I noticed the quality of the food and the service has gone completely down hill. The portion sizes have been cut, noticeably on the chicken lettuce wraps, wilted lettuce and hardly any chicken in the mixture. Not enough for all the wilted wraps, especially for a whopping 11.95 appetizer. The honey crisp chicken salad had half the amount of chicken it used to have. Last night We ordered 2 meals through grub hub. We were charged full price but only received 1 meal. Supposingly BJs  told the driver that they were out of Prime rib but didn't bother to let the Customer know this! No one called to ask us if we would like something else. We waited over an hour for our meals, to only receive 1 of them. The food we did receive, soggy slaw with the  over cooked dry and cold tiny 5 piece root beer ribs . I had to call grub hub to complain and ask for a refund on the meal I didn't receive! They had to call BJ's to find out 'what happened' and ask for a refund on the Prime rib. I still got stuck with the 12.00, 20% tip I paid for 2 meals..I will never eat at this BJ's again. this is No reflection on grub Hub..It's all on BJ's LaMesa..I should have known better than to order take out, when eating at the restaurant was terrible the last time..and I am not a complainer."
