Jeremy J.,"La Mesa, CA",34,51,1,4.0,7/6/2012,"The Beer is great. The menu has some gems, like the Ahi salad and the chopped salad. For a chain restaurant this place is great."
Trisha Eve J.,"San Diego, CA",62,121,6,4.0,6/14/2011,"I went to this place for my friend's wedding rehearsal dinner. I have to say, this location is much larger than the one in La Jolla. The pizza is good as always, and their new item, the red velvet pizookie is AMAZING. Also, I was really pleased with the way the bartender made my long island with the premium liquors. PERFECT :)"
Robert R.,"El Cajon, CA",2,26,,4.0,2/21/2012,"I've been there several times and have never had a bad experience. The service and food has always been great. My wife always orders the mini bruschettas as an appetizer. Keep the dipping sauce. It's great on the pizza. Their beers are really good and have a great selection. The 103 inch tv in the lounge is awesome for watching sports. The lounge is loud when it's busy and if you get a 2 seater table, the tables are  small. barely big enough for the pizza and a couple of plates. But I have never had a problem with the food or service."
Jes E.,"San Diego, CA",25,88,8,2.0,8/5/2011,"This place is LOUD, no matter where you sit. We went there for a birthday deal. The food was okay, the waitress was not. We had to ask for refills several times. At dessert time, she brought out the birthday pizookie, and took dessert orders. 25 minutes later, no dessert. She told us ""One dessert is done! We just want to bring both of them together!"" 10 minutes later, one dessert comes out. Not even the one that was ""done first"" either. 15 minutes later, another dessert followed. She should be working at Seau's with her level of terrible customer service!"
Kelly G.,"San Diego, CA",95,80,29,4.0,4/18/2009,I love BJS simply because I am a huge fan of the macadamia nut pazookie.  You must try it! I like that they have a combo that is half a baked potato and a side salad. Its just right.  The service is hit or miss. Mostly miss. and by miss... I mean you will miss your server because its difficult to get them back to your table. Sometimes I'm just not in the mood to deal with it... and not even the pazookie can get me there!   Its unfortunate because this place could be just perfect. But that one detail just stands in the way.
Brian C.,"Lakeside, CA",15,306,23,4.0,4/3/2011,I've experienced two sides of BJ's. Coming here with my friends and putting down some beers. As well as coming here with my wife for a nice dinner. I had a great time with both. I just have two suggestions. One try the Sweet Pig pizza paired with a nice cold Jeremiah Red beer and second try to get there early the parking lot fills up quick and you will end up having  to park  on the other side of the mall when it does.
Crystal D.,"Santee, CA",16,33,,4.0,1/26/2012,"Great service on a busy Sunday night. Hubby and I needed to use a gift card. Food was delicious. Mini great white for him, mini vegetarian gluten free for me. Both were delicious and more than enough portion wise. Minus one star for having to wait for longer than they quoted us when we first arrived."
Doncarlo A.,"San Diego, CA",225,13,1,5.0,10/14/2011,"Came here while on one of my 50+ mile bike rides, because I was craving a pizza and it was right there and open at 10pm on a Saturday night. Well they confused my pizza order (incorrect toppings), and after I pointed this out, they promptly cooked up another one, after the shift manager came out to personally apologize and make sure I was otherwise doing all right (which I was). The pizza I eventually did receive was hot and super tasty, as were the house lager and the caesar salad I also had. The whole staff were very friendly, and the atmosphere was clean and relaxed. I just wish the food was a little cheaper, but I got what I paid for. And that was before the 5% military discount."
Molly F.,"San Diego, CA",2,9,,4.0,6/4/2012,"Definitely a fan! Husband and I went here about a month or so ago and just LOVED the selection of beers and the service was great! She was so patient waiting for us to  make up our minds because the menu is as extensive as the beer choices. It was fantastic. I'd go 5 stars but I don't know.... seemed a bit loud (I know they can't help that) and the food itself was a little pricey but still, pretty dang good for a chain!"
Blazin S.,"San Diego, CA",0,5,1,4.0,8/20/2012,"Had a great dinner @ BJ's after the Charger/Dallas game. Server was super friendly and outgoing. My wife lost her phone and it was turned into the manager, who returned the phone to my wife.  Great food & drinks."
Brett W.,"Spring Valley, CA",1,12,,4.0,2/5/2009,"My wife and I are new here and so far there are only a couple of places that we like and this is one of them.  We have been there two times and both times it was really good and the service had been really good both times (once when the place was busy and once when it was off peak) The first time we went we had some kind of California Sandwich and both types of fries and the second time we went we tried their really big salads (I had the california cobb and my wife had some kind of salad with chicken strips in it ... both good).   This will definitely be a ""go to"" place for us when we want good portions and quality."
Jack G.,"La Mesa, CA",15,71,,3.0,3/24/2009,"We have tried the local BJ's a couple of times now.  I have tried most of their brews and am not a big fan but they have Fat Tire on tap so the beer is good.   Service has been acceptable, nothing exceptional but they are pretty much always busy, and the food is good."
Andrea P.,"San Diego, CA",42,63,11,4.0,2/16/2011,"I've been here a few times for various occasions and every time I come here I always get greeted by happy go-lucky servers.  Today, I went here with a friend for dinner..we hadn't each other in a while so we thought this would be the perfect place to meet and catch up. What's cool about this place is that they have almost EVERYTHING, from sandwichs, to burgers to pastas to even tacos!  FOOD: I got the Chardonnay Shrimp Pasta and there was a good ratio of everything from pasta to shrimp to tomato's. Also, came with two bread sticks. And the portion size was HUGE, let's just say it was enough to take home and eat again later on. From the looks of everything they aren't skimpy on the portions..you really do get what you pay for.  SERVICE: It was good, our server was very helpful in everything, came to check up on us at the right times and asked if were okay AFTER she saw we didn't have food in our mouths. She asked if we wanted re-fills and didn't automatically just try to grab for our cups. A+ on that!  Even though this place is known for the brewhouse, I'll have to wait a couple more months before I can try their beer's but it looks good! haha"
Nick D.,"La Mesa, CA",3,19,1,3.0,5/21/2010,"I like BJ's, mmm...     Back to my review, I like this place but I agree with other reviews, it lacks TV's and a great menu.  It does have an excellent pizza though, my wife loves it.   The bar and the restaurant are separate from each other and does separate the adults from the families.  They have a great happy hour and is filled with other business casual patrons that are fun to talk to. I have not had bad service just service that seems to be short of waiters, You can sometimes lose your buzz before your next drink is ordered and brought to your table. The beer taster is great!"
Paul S.,"La Mesa, CA",0,1,,3.0,8/6/2012,"Well Bj's its been fun , but after going here for 11 years I will not be coning back of my own accord. How the hell do you get rid of a basket of fries and turn it into a side plate of fries? How did we receive tasteless avocado egg rolls with out a side of sauce? I am sorry, but your food has gone down hill in the last couple years. The only reason I kept coming back was for the fries , pizza , avocado egg rolls, and the Jeremiah red. You restaurant cannot even get it's main dishes correct .I gave you three stars for the Jeremiah red  that didn't taste like soap this time."
Ryan A.,"San Diego, CA",0,1,,1.0,4/23/2014,We tried to make a reservation on Saturday at 6:30.  I was told that we were in and a manager needed to call back (they were in a meeting at 7pm at night).  I never received a call back.  So I called back the next day to verify  our reservation.  I was told that they never take reservations on Saturday between 6:30 and 9:00.  They let me know that they could get me in when we show up...they just could not tell me  how long it would take.  Yes - I get that...anyone can show up and wait!  So much for G-ma's 80th birthday Pizookie.
Matt M.,"Los Angeles, CA",159,285,,4.0,1/4/2012,"They recently expanded their taps! Lots of great local beers and pretty decent food. if sports are your thing, they have a ton of huge TVs in the bar area. Will be back for sure."
Brianna F.,"San Diego, CA",30,109,,4.0,2/26/2012,"Really good for a chain. Cider, calamari, stuffed mushrooms, and pozookie were all great! And the service was super quick and prices were fair."
Matt S.,"Roanoke, VA",59,24,5,4.0,2/24/2012,"Dinner was a little on the pricy side, but the food was good!  I had a 12 oz. rib eye that was delicious.  The burgers also looked very good and big, but it was mainly because the buns were about twice as big as the patties.  The best part though, were their pizookies!  They are all hot, fresh, sweet, and all come with a large scoop of vanilla ice cream!  I liked the white chocolate macadamia nut pizookie the best!  Oh, and their servers were very polite and helpful."
Gabriel M.,"Lakeside, CA",48,210,94,3.0,2/27/2009,It can get EXTREMELY PACKED. So Reservations or showing up early is a must. Staff has often neglected groups on more than one occasions earning themselves a weak tip. The Jambalaya is nothing close to southern. It is just hot for the sake of hot no real flavor a total let down to fans of southern food. When is the joint is slow its a great atmosphere with nice decorations and soft lighting. The out door seating in the summer is very pleasant before a movie at the mall
