Joe C.,"San Diego, CA",16,11,,1.0,12/17/2013,The service is good and their food is good. But they get one star because they took their bacon cheeseburger pizza  and crispy chicken sandwich off the menu.  Didn't find out until we sat down. Now I have no reason to ever go back.
Hula R.,"San Diego, CA",1124,291,60,4.0,9/16/2008,"I AM ALL ABOUT THE PIZOOKIE! So, I went to BJ's tonight and really had a good time!  Too be honest, I was all about the pizookie but was pleasantly surprised and also disappointed by a lot of things today! SURPRISINGLY GOOD: - The appetizers!  I had the pot stickers and the lettuce wraps and all I have to say is DAMN!  Very tasty! - The friendliness of the hostess, manager and waiter!  All very friendly and willing to help out! - My entree!  I had the salmon and it was delicious!  The rice was a bit overcooked but I ain't no Top Chef judge so I am not complaining! SURPRISINGLY BAD: - The cleanliness of the place.  There were a swarm of small nats that kept flying over our table.  Talk about annoying and gross! - The amount of time it took for the waiter to take our drink order, food order and check!  It took 20 minutes from when we sat down for our waiter to greet us and get us drinks.  By the time the check came, it took our waiter 15 minutes to get us change! OVERALL DELICIOUSNESS: Has to by far go to the pizookie!  Thank you BJ's!  I LOVE THE PIZOOKIE! Out of 5 full belly's (5 full belly's being AWESOME, 1 belly being DISGUSTING), I give BJ's 4 full belly's- you better thank whoever created the pizookie!"
Andrew F.,"San Diego, CA",151,90,72,1.0,1/29/2012,This review is based on their so called Deep Dish Pizza. One word...joke!  All bread and no sauce or much of anything else. It's a shame. They have all the right ingredients and cooking equipment to make a great pizza but they fail miserably. Life's to short to waste hard earned money on bad food.
Joshua A.,"Los Angeles, CA",85,126,,3.0,11/1/2008,"When placed in a category with Bennigans, TGI Fridays, and other clones, BJ's shines like a beacon of awesome. But, when compared to other local spots to grab a beer and a bite, or order a pizza, BJ's is about as exciting as The View, and just as interesting. I've been here a few times, ranging from a few years ago to quite recently. My friends love the pizookie, but I don't have much of a sweet tooth. I've had some pretty blech food here in the past, so when they convince me to go I usually get a flight of beer and pace myself while they gorge on unremarkableness.  The only thing that saves this from a two-star rating is that the prices don't seem exorbitant and the service has been consistently good.  I'd say it's a great place to go just to grab some conversation while filling your caloric needs, but it gets too loud for that."
Joe C.,"La Mesa, CA",231,45,12,3.0,9/11/2008,"Went for a late lunch.  We missed the big luch rush, so I was able to find parking right out front, got seated immediatly, and were waited on promptly. The choices on the luch menu were good, and the prices fair.  I ordered a ''Don Julio"" Margarita, and was met with a frown and 'oh really' from the server.  I inqired about her reaction, she replied ""I don't like it, it has coke in it"",  I looked at the menu description, and said 'oh really, it doesn't say that here, it says it has ginger ale in it"".  She replied back ""yeah something like coke"".  I changed to a Pomergranite Margarita. Ordered the BBQ Chicken Choped salad, my partner ordered the Grand Soup and Salade, Ceasar, and Chili for the soup. My partner's Ice tea hit the table within seconds, and in just a short time, our food was on the table.  The BBQ Salade was outstanding.  I found my self scarfing it down, really tasty,.  My partner commented that the chili was really good, lots of flavor, and just enough spice to liven it up, but not enough to overpower the tase. I was about 1/2 through my dish when my partner commented, within earshot of the passing server, ""didn't you order a margarita?"".  The server spun arround and said ""oh yeah I forgott that"", and darted off. I was 3/4 through my meal when it finally hit the table. So here's the nutshell; Good food, great location for lunch (if you come a little off peak time), weak service, really loud inside. Stars would be higher if the server wasn't such a flake, and they put some sound baffles up in the cieling."
Chardá F.,"El Cajon, CA",258,260,46,4.0,11/30/2010,"Good place to stop for lunch while doing some shopping as Target, Macy's &  Walmart are just a skip, hop and jump away.  Not to mention how the hospital is conveniently just across the street so if you are one to go watch a football game and have a deep dish pizza and decide to get insanely wasted while you're at it and catch a bad case of alcohol poisoning you will be taken care of because the ambulance is literally across the street. On a serious note, friendly service and laid back atmosphere (we did go on a weeknight so this could be diff on the weekend) the bill came to $35 total so about average in prices. It was freezing cold in general inside and out so we changed our mind from eating in to ordering to go. We got 2 burgers, 2 fries, kids meal, and an oreo cookie pizookie. This was certainly not my first time here but I hadn't been in a few years and didn't know they had the oreo cookie pizookie now, I've had all the others so decided to try this one with the hubby. It was awesome, like a milk and cookies party in my mouth! I loved the oreo mousse that it comes with that is the icing on the cake that sets it apart from the other pizookie's. For me, I'm not a burger girl but I felt daring so I tried the grilled burger melt and it was delish...a tad hint of sweet (probably because of the carmelized onions and special sauce) but still savory with the two cheeses. For the hubby, California burger substituted a turkey patty instead of beef for less calories, he said it was very juicy and flavorful. I prefer the wedge cut fries as they are well seasoned and very filling compared to those wimpy shoestring fries. Portions were decent and the food was pleasing. Don't forget to sign up on their website to get a free pizookie on your birthday every year! I'm sure we will be back here soon, especially since they play football on their tv's, woohoo Go Chargers!"
Bradley B.,"San Diego, CA",2,14,3,5.0,11/23/2011,"5 Stars. I've been here multiple times recently and every time has been a pleasure. The menu is extensive without making you feel like it's too much, as a 21 year old I've made the choice not to have alcohol in my life(straight-edge for anyone reading this who might know what that is) but I can also appreciate it's alcohol selection which is basically the first half of the menu. From, salad to pizza, from pasta to steak there is everything in between for almost anyone you bring to enjoy. I even came here a little while ago and one of our apps, (avocado rolls) were taking a good bit of time to come out, so they were asked about, and within 1 minute our server had either a supervisor or manager at our table who apologized and comped the app for us. THATS quality! They recognized that something either happened or it was simply just taking too long and took responsibility for it. I wish a lot of restaurants could learn from this one little(HUGE) detail. Prices are just right and it's always moving here, plently of seating to choose from, plenty of parking and you can bring 3 or 4 friends in and not have to worry about being under-dressed or a little too loud, it has just the right amount of class to just say, ""Hey let's go get some good food really quick."" The servers have always been great and polite making sure you're being taken care of. If you're in the area of La Mesa or Grossmont and need to hit the mall or are thinking about dinner and a movie? Drop by BJ's grab some food or a tummy filler before a movie and then walk across the parking lot to the movies. Sounds good enough to me!"
richie e.,"San Diego, CA",1492,148,31,4.0,11/16/2008,Server was super nice even though we had coupons for free pizzokie.  Food is better than TGIF's for sure.  There is also more selection.  I've also been here for a large bday group and had no hassles. Honestly the only thing going against the place is that the ambiance feels pretty cookie cutter.  I need to get over my own prejudice about normal looking places =P
Russell B.,"San Diego, CA",0,16,,2.0,6/15/2012,"Ok. So I came here with the guys and our waitress took us as a joke. We were having a good time, laughing, telling stories and what not. She was short with us and had no personality whatsoever. By the time we all got our food, half of us were done eating and the others were just starting. It was disappointing, since we all don't get to hang out all together often."
Julia C.,"San Diego, CA",277,131,46,4.0,1/1/2009,"I like going to BJ's with a bunch of friends. Great beer and buffalo chicken wings (appetizer) are do die for! I'd say best chicken wings hands down!  Thin crust basil pizza is delicious as well.  Overall, I would give BJ's food - B.  Friday and Saturday nights are always very busy... so be prepared to wait 30-45mins to be seated.  Last time we went, we ordered hot brownie with ice cream, kind of like pizzookie style, but brownie....OMG... it was heaven in my mouth!"
Dana S.,"San Diego, CA",145,346,23,4.0,1/11/2009,"MMMM BJ's.  You're delicious!  After a wine tasting excursion in Temecula I somehow found myself here craving a beer and NACHOS!  Alas, you provided me with friendly service, served me quickly and the food was out of sight (perhaps because i had beer goggles on, er make that wine). The food is consistently good, prices are reasonable for the amount of food you receive and their menu can accommodate even the most distinct of tastes. If you haven't been here you've gotta try it.  Everyone needs a little BJ now and then."
Dulce M.,"Oceanside, CA",40,229,18,4.0,10/26/2011,"I always love this place.  The service is always great, friendly, and fast.  The deep dish pizza is ding dong delicious!! They have good happy hours.  They recently changed their avocado egg rolls and put this cream cheese filler...yuck! The pizzookies for dessert are sweet, rich and flavorful. I recently tried their potato skins and was happy to see they deep fry the entire thing. Kinda reminds me of the Aussie potatoes you get from the fair. I LOVE them. mmm! The place is huge and has a fun atmosphere! Oh and the bathrooms are always clean which shows a lot in a restaurant. I just wish this place was closer."
Venus L.,"San Diego, CA",43,83,2,2.0,9/10/2009,"This review is based on my two trips to BJ's: one back in May and the other a few days ago (and will explain why my friends and I will probably never go back there). The first time here was back in May for a friend's going-away party.  We had a group of about 20 come into the restaurant.  The servers were  really nice and efficient to our large group.  Overall, it was a good dining experience; everyone had a good time and the food was also amazing with the pizookie to end the evening. Fast forward to four months later.  A small group of us (eight in total with some who were also there at the first visit) decided to take on BJ's special which was Dinner for Two for only $19.99 (includes an appetizer, a pizza and a pizookie).  So we all meet up at the restaurant where we were told it would be about a half-hour wait... which then turned into 45 minutes.  I started to get a little concerned as I saw parties close to our size getting seated right away while we were still waiting.  One of our guys decided to speak to the front and we were finally seated. So we get a table out on the patio which was not crowded at all (wonder why they just didn't seat us there in the first place) and start ordering.  The first thing we order were appetizers which I thought seemed like it was taking forever just for those to arrive.  We started to notice that people who were seated after us had already ordered and were getting their food before us.  Does it really take more than 20 minutes to make a salad? A while later, appetizers finally come (after being brought to the wrong table - twice).  What really bugged me was that not everyone got theirs at the same time.  Only half of them came out and were already eaten by the time the other half's orders arrived.  A few minutes later, pizzas start coming out with almost all of them except for one (which took another 10 minutes to get to our table). When it came to paying the bill, there were still some mistakes.  We all got split checks; however an item my friend ordered was on another check and not his.  After that, two of the guys decided to speak to the manager about our dining experience.  I'm not too clear on the details but it seemed that the manager had feared that an experience that we had would happen due to some new staff and such.  They apologized and we left.   Had I written this review based on that night alone, it would only receive one star.  However, the food was good (on both occasions) so it's getting two stars.  Still, any restaurant with poor service is one that I'll probably never go to again."
ann T.,"San Diego, CA",2,14,,5.0,1/17/2013,"Do you like beer?  Do you like pizza?  Do you like to get out with your family and friends?  If the answer to any three of these questions is yes, BJs is worth giving a solid try.  I have eaten here at least a dozen times.  They have a wide variety of hand crafted beer to suit any taste.  Personally, I am not a big fan of thick crust pizza which BJs has; however, they have a hand crafted thin crust pizza that is wonderful.  I have had several of the menu items as well and so far there is nothing I would not order again.  The service is consistently good and sometimes excellent, tonight Steve did a great job (thanks Steve).  BJs is a large restaurant, so it can be a bit loud.  They have happy hour that goes to 7.  What can I say, BJs is now our number one place to go!"
john k.,"San Diego, CA",49,222,27,5.0,6/17/2009,"The deep dish pizza here ROCKS! I got a deep dish pizza for takeout because my friend grew up nearby and said the pizza was good.  It sure was AWESOME!! I came back and ate in this time and was surprised to find that pizza was only a part of the menu. They also serve pasta, burgers and a whole myriad of other items.  You WILL find something you like on their extensive menu. I was also pleasantly surprised with the various demographics of the customers.  There were families, couples, and groups of thirty-somethings.  BJ's has great general appeal and I think that says a lot about their food. They have microbrews that are made on site, I believe.  I enjoyed my beer. BJ's isn't convenient from my place but it's worth the trip once in a while."
Aaron S.,"Spring Valley, CA",94,82,26,2.0,7/11/2011,"I had heard wonderful things about this place.  So sorry, I just don't get it.  The place was completely crowded and the service was not great.  We initially had two servers who were unaware of each other.  And once they straightened that out, we ordered and never saw our server again.  Our meal and appetizers arrived simultaneously. Their jambalaya tasted very little like something I would get in New Orleans despite the selling point.   Our beer was pretty good though.  Did not leave angry or anything but wasn't impressed at all."
Eddie P.,"San Diego, CA",900,709,158,3.0,8/4/2008,"Sitting at the bar is always a sure bet. Cheap food and drinks. Dining in tends to get a little complicated. While I've never had a bad night there at BJ's, the service hasn't always been the greatest. It's a very decent place for smaller groups. I've had large parties here before and it doesn't work out so well. Usually, you split the party up, or wait a long time for them to make you a proper table--mind you, this is WITH a reservation.  If I ever go to BJ's, it's usually just for appetizers and drinks. The food isn't bomb enough for me to take a date there.. I mean, it's not 1996 and I'm not in high school anymore, so who the fuck am I trying to impress by taking a girl to BJ's? Am I right fellas?"
Maurice A.,"San Diego, CA",45,174,1,4.0,6/28/2011,Ambiance is fun love their happy house specials. The Mediterranean mini pizza is good with a cold one....and under $20! Score. Service is always very friendly and always get seated quickly. Menu has lots to choose from.
Caroline L.,"San Diego, CA",25,6,2,5.0,1/13/2013,Great pizza. We had half buffalo chicken and half chicken bacon ranch. Soooo good. And our server greg was awesome!!
Ash M.,"Charlottesville, VA",1,61,3,2.0,9/7/2013,"Average chain restaurant experience.  Big menu with a focus on quantity of food, but not necessarily quality.  The restaurant is noisy and service is slow.  It's fine for groups or to watch a game, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go here."
