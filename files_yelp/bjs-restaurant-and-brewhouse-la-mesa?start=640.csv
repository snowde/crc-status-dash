Abby W.,"San Diego, CA",0,7,,3.0,11/1/2011,"We've been coming here for about 4 years, and we've been slowly starting to avoid it.  It's loud, whenever you order something it takes about 30 minutes for your food to arrive (this includes dessert), and the servers are only sometimes helpful.   On the plus side, I was VERY excited to have so many gluten-free options, like pizza AND a pizookie! The pizza is thin-crust and seasoned, but still very delicious, and the pizookie tasted exactly the same.  Very pleasant dining experience, the service is just sometimes lackluster."
Truda P.,"El Cajon, CA",94,138,29,3.0,10/25/2008,Pros large portions full bar Cons food is so so crowded & noisy
NICOLE H.,"San Diego, CA",46,22,9,4.0,7/7/2011,"Absolutely love this place. Great place for families, dates, get together with friends...there's a lot to choose from on their menu. Try their Mediterranean pizza. It's delicious!"
Cruise L.,"Pearland, TX",0,73,84,4.0,5/9/2011,"It it wasn't for the amazing Jeremiah Red, chips & salsa, and stuffed mushrooms we had, I'd give this place 3 stars. The atmosphere was really really LOUD at the bar area. We went during a Lakers game and there were people cheering for and against, quite loudly with a lot of yelling at each other, we thought we were gonna be in the middle of a fight between fans!  (Your experience may vary!) The tables were really close together and the wait staff seemed too busy to bother refilling our drinks. It also took a long time to find parking around here. But like I said, the Jeremiah Red made up for all of that. Try it if you haven't! They have free Wi-Fi as well, so enjoy! (BTW, if you live closer to Chula Vista their BJ's is set up much better, and I've never had a problem finding parking or with the wait staff!)"
Jen V.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,55,,5.0,6/19/2010,We've been here several times and are never disappointed. Word to the wise: call ahead to put your name on the wait list on busy nights and you'll have a much shorter wait. The food is delicious and the staff is always very friendly.
Luis F.,"San Diego, CA",5,24,,3.0,7/28/2009,"The pizza bread is really greasy..the kind of bread that is really puffy..it looks better than it taste. Not a bad taste, but nothing spectacular.  The beer: The Jeremaiah Red is probably their best brew. It goes down smooth, full flavored,..the beers are suppose to be ""hoppy""..but it barely crosses the ""hoppy"" line.  The service was decent..forgetfull waiters, but they were nice"
rebekah c.,"La Mesa, CA",3,40,,2.0,6/27/2010,"I've tried 3x to like this place. I can't. Its just not for me. Everything feels really corporate and forced. I hope restaurants learn that customers don't like hearing a poor waitress recite the drink specials and appetizers. Its uncomfortable for everyone involved. The food tastes like any other chain restaurant. The beers are fine..I guess. I feel bad giving this place 2 stars, its not like I had a traumatic experience, Its just so bland."
Steve G.,"San Diego, CA",122,60,3,2.0,4/11/2011,"We had never been here before so we wanted to try their pizza- I mean, who doesn't love pizza, right?! I was disappointed that it was so run-of-mill. The ""deep dish"" crust was a result of airy bread. They were really stingy with their toppings, too. Once you start deviating from real Italian pizza, you need to be clever (life Lefty's or Bronx) with your goods. BJ's didn't cut it. They're beer selection is wicked good, though. I think I'd try a burger next time and skip the pizza."
Lisa T.,"San Diego, CA",41,67,1,4.0,11/15/2010,"Tina and I decided we needed to go in again...everything was just like we remembered...they now have their own berry burst cider on tap and that is real real real good...needless to say, we got hammered up! love you bj's!"
Toan T.,"San Diego, CA",45,138,82,4.0,4/3/2011,This is a good place to go get food and drinks with friends. Always busy but the service is pretty good. The pizzas are pretty tasty. The Jeremiah red is a great beer. I highly recommend it. Also don't forget to get a pizzookie!
Tony L.,"La Mesa, CA",95,74,,4.0,7/17/2008,"I love reds.  I love red heads with their alabaster skin and fire hair...and if she's tall, all the better.  I love the color red, as it is evocative.  And I LOVE BJ's red.  I could drink that stuff by the liter...wait, I actually DO drink it by the liter!! BJ's is a great spot if you're having dinner/drinks with a few people.  It's not the sort of place you really want to take a large group and expect to socialize with everyone.  The food and drinks make up for this though. I love it as a happy hour spot.  Order up some killer appetizers and a few pitchers, and I'm good to go. The main thing that SUCKS monkey balls about BJs (mixing my metaphors), is how crowded it can get especially on Fridays around happy hour.  The other majorly sucky thing is the utter lack of parking.   Try this: go there in the early afternoon, get comfy and drink your ass off till the sunsets.  Then leave when the rush starts.  It's damned dandy."
Jenny W.,"La Mesa, CA",2,37,3,5.0,8/20/2009,"My favorite restaurant in San Diego!  My boyfriend and I go here every chance we get to spend a little extra money and have a night out.  Great food with generous helpings at moderate prices.   My all time favorite is the fork and knife pot roast sandwich.  French roll with pot roast, mashed potatoes, and gravy all piled on top of each other.... mmmmm.  And you just can't go wrong with their pizookies!  Best dessert ever! It has a young and modern feel to it.  Dimmed lighting, brew house feel.  Most of the people in their are young and loud.  I enjoy it, but I can understand some who don't.   Absolutely love it!"
Amy S.,"San Diego, CA",574,897,101,4.0,5/4/2008,"This place is pretty good for being a chain. The thing to get here is the BBQ chicken sandwich; delectable and rather large making for a good meal or two afterward. The only downside to this place is that the waitresses seem to neglect the fact that sodas need frequent refills, especially during long waits for food. And at times, it's beyond loud in here that you are shouting into the ear of the person next to you; that always irritates me. But overall, I've never had any bad experiences here and this place stands as one of the only good places in La Mesa to eat."
Michael M.,"San Diego, CA",12,14,,4.0,10/21/2011,"Great food, decent beers. Is an ok family environment, I have brought my son here without incident. Staff is always friendly."
Dan S.,"San Diego, CA",10,39,,4.0,9/30/2013,Their pot roast dinner was cooked perfectly. A little fatty on the meat but it was really flavorful. The waitress rushed our drink order to make sure we go the happy hour deals so she was excellent and got an extra tip because of her better service. I bet she earns more than most at this place.
Ainokea B.,"La Mesa, CA",1,117,22,4.0,4/3/2011,"Came here for a drink--sat at the bar.  Friendly customer service by Maddie (sp?).  Gave us a few tastes to help us decide on a drink.  Had the street tacos--chicken and barbacoa beef.  Drinks are a little pricey, but then again, they usually are at bars, I guess.  We'll definitely come back here."
Ryan M.,"Virginia Beach, VA",8,19,10,3.0,5/4/2011,"Service was poor, the waiter took 30min to take our order.... it might not be the establishments fault , the food was aright portions is something lacking."
Jacklyn K.,"Los Angeles, CA",414,76,16,4.0,6/22/2008,"How do you start reviewing a place like BJ's?  Love the food, everything I've had...been extremely satisfied. The Potato skins are definitely my favorite. The pizza's a great, burgers are amazing, and the Pizookie...there isn't an adjective that could begin to describe this amazing creation of a dessert.   Great beer, I'm not much of a beer drinker but my boyfriend is. Out of all the beers he loves the PM Porter.  My one complaint...and this is out of BJ's hands, but it's always busy not matter what day you come to eat. In direct result, the restaurant is always busy and the food and service is not as prompt as preferred but it's a small price to pay for the food.  Highly recommended."
Alex T.,"Spring Valley, CA",23,23,,5.0,2/25/2011,One word for the roast beef dip AMAZING. Definitely coming back. Wife and I really enjoyed our dishes.
Loretta F.,"San Diego, CA",0,20,,1.0,8/19/2013,"Went last night 8-18-13 with my daughter,niece, her son anyway there were five of us. First the womens bathroom is HOT and dirty, a real turn off when you are gonna have dinner. Seated fast, got the menus and waited, waited, waited, finally a waitress took our drink order. Waited...got drinks, wanted a gluten free menu we needed..waited. took our order, waited 45 minutes for our food, witch was not right for one of my nieces with the gluten free order. Didn't fill the water glasses...NEVER AGAIN Too many places to go eat in San Diego, good places and we pick BJs!! First time there..NEVER AGAIN...CLEAN YOUR WOMENS RESTROOM!!"
