Fiona T.,"San Diego, CA",157,316,50,5.0,6/12/2008,"One of my favorite places to eat =]  I love this place   1) Because their one of the ONLY places that carry Raspberry Vinegrette!  2) It's a fun enviroment 3) GOOD SERVICE 4) Always busy=good stuff  No cons about this place what-so-ever.  Reservations are BEST...if you're eating in a big group, than call like a week ahead of time! =) Love the margaritas!!"
Jenifer P.,"La Mesa, CA",1,111,,4.0,3/30/2011,"I love the food here and the service is great! Their microbrews are also pretty good, be sure to get the sampler. They get crowded on the weekends so make a reservation or get there early. If I had one criticism, it's that their prices are a little on the high side."
Dee D.,"Alpine, CA",65,235,5,4.0,2/12/2011,"BJ's is good for pizza - the rest is OK.  This particular location is very large and WAY too noisy.  Always crazy crowded, and I don't really know why.  I like the La Jolla location better.  Small but quiet and the same god pizza.  If you have room, the pazooki is amazing."
Josephine Z.,"San Diego, CA",607,245,81,3.0,3/25/2007,"We had plenty of birthday dinners here, but never mine. The food is average, the service is OK,  and the seating is somewhat prompt.  As mentioned by another Yelper, their pazookie is absolutely sinful. The pizza isn't too authentic, but that's what you get for going to a chain. I recommend making reservations. Parking can be a hassle, so arrive early or you'll end up parking by Target."
Erica H.,"San Diego, CA",31,51,17,4.0,2/22/2008,"**UPDATE: went here for take out dinner the other night, and they up and earned themselves another star from me! The new tomato soup on their menu rivals that of Nordy's...which is a feat unto itself! Great job BJ's...I'm so proud. ;) ________________________________________________________ Lettuce wraps here are good (on a few occasions they were a bit too oily) but overall have been a good choice for me. I know people rave about the Lettuce wraps at PF Changs, but I really prefer these.  They also have a pretty good clam chowder. I've never ordered the bread bowl though. I've gotten thier other soup once before,  just for a change of pace (minestrone?) and it was super bland and boring.  My other fav here is the Garden Medley salad - I've ordered with salmon (it was okay) and with chicken (also just okay) but what I really like is the Balsamic dressing - very tasty.  Lastly, thier coffee is superb. Great flavor. The little plastic 'shot-glasses' of creamer do cheapen it a bit though. ;)   My BF and I are in agreement that we are not in love with the ambiance, so we've started to order to go more often here...plus it's close to home so it's easier and faster.  Honestly, if it wasn't, we'd most likely not make the trip unless we had other business in the area."
Melissa S.,"Crestview, FL",308,427,64,4.0,5/4/2007,"4 stars, just for watching my friend get drunk off long islands and a buttery niple. Birthday dinner on a Friday night, across from a movie theatre, the day Spiderman 3 comes out. Crowded. But maybe this place is always crowded... We called on Wednesday and tried to make reservations but they said they weren't taking any...but when I requested reservations through   we got reservations...interesting. Party of 12 @ 630pm. We didn't get seated until 7, but that's because we needed half our party and they didn't come until 650. Strawberry lemonade is good anywhere. Potato Skins, Cajun Pasta that tasted like spaghetti, the white pizza(GREAT WHITE) is pretty good. and of course the PIZOOKIEEEEEEEE, half white chocolate, half peanut butter topped with vanillabean ice cream. MMMMMMMM  drunk birthday girl, ""Want some of my POOKIE."" Highlight of the evening, watching my friend drink 3 long islands, first she drank one and she was a little tipsy, and her bestfriend told her to drink ""water"" but handed her another long island, then gave her more ""water."" She loves me, I'm her partner in crime. Noise level(1-10): 9.5 Parking: Bad(but we got lucky) Wait(If you don't have reservations): Long Food: Average ""Once in awhile place"""
Melissa G.,"San Diego, CA",33,18,,5.0,2/20/2008,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! food here is awesome!! from the ginormous BBQ chopped salad (add avocado), to the deep dish works pizza!!! its just too yummy!! and dont skip out on the chocolate chip pazookie(sp?)  the service here was super & it was a busy saturday night too! i go at least once a month and i always have the same great, fulfulling experience!"
S V.,"San Diego, CA",0,11,8,3.0,5/8/2013,"Came in for the pizza and football. We were seated right away and ordered.  It seemed like we waited forever to get our pizza and then someone finally came out and told us our pizza dropped....so they're making another one asap. The manager asked if we wanted appetizers. We had ordered plenty already! I was soooo hungryyyyyy. I guess the manager saw how pissed I was and took the pizza off our tab. I was going to give a 2 star rating, but the manager turned the dining experience around. Now that's good service. :D"
Mireya V.,"San Diego, CA",160,145,60,4.0,11/1/2008,"Despite reading good reviews about BJ's salads, it is against my religion to order salads at restaurants. Therefore, my BJ's faves are the stuffed potatoes (they're huge!) and the BBQ chicken pizza!  For dessert, the chocolate chunk pizookie and brownie are delicious! Who doesn't love ice cream and warm chocolatey goodness?!   Tip: If they sit you in front of the kitchen, you get a free dessert!"
Rachel B.,"La Mesa, CA",142,116,8,3.0,9/23/2007,"The pizza is really good. Especially the specialty pizzas. I usually get either the Barbecue Chicken Pizza or the Great White. I've never gotten anything else there except the chips and salsa (which are not bottomless,sadly) and the wedge-cut french fries. Both were good and a nice way to start out the meal without being too expensive. The large pizza's are only a few dollars more than a delivery from Pizza Hut but much better. The famous Pizookie makes it all worthwhile. They have at least four different varieties to choose from.  Unfortunately the atmosphere at night is extremely loud and is a little too sports bar reminiscent to me. People are being so loud that it is hard to carry a conversation without shouting.  The one time I went during the day it was much quieter and a better experience all together.  I would suggest it as a lunch option or maybe a dinner during the week as opposed to the weekends. Overall good food but just a little too loud."
Geoff H.,"Austin, TX",100,129,2,4.0,9/26/2007,"We often came in here for a drink after work at the Urgent Care across the street so I have many good (blurry) memories. Given it's close proximity to the hospital, it wasn't unusual to see people in scrubs in there in decompression mode after a tough shift. I really liked their Amber and the Porter. If your not sure what beer to get, order the sampler- I watched one nurse plow through one of those and then get another one. I guess she just wasn't sure. A few nights before closing we were asked to quiet down or leave. I didn't think we were THAT loud, but my judgement may have been slightly askew. They were nice about it, at least. Great pizza, and the pizookie should be banned. Anything that good is probably deadly."
Alan N.,"San Diego, CA",29,17,4,4.0,1/17/2011,Pretty good place. Spacious and comfortable. Try a pazookie!!! I didnt like their house beers as much.
HP C.,"San Diego, CA",0,29,,3.0,5/24/2011,"Another spot we visit fairly often. We always sit at the bar - when we can get in. Happy Hour is very popular here, probably due to both the specials and being so close to the mall & movie theater, so it can be difficult to get a seat even midweek. They also added huge additional TV displays, so a big game will bring a crowd as well.  Service at the bar is usually good in that we don't have to wait too long to be acknowledged and a couple staffers even remember what we like. But yes, the obviously forced sales pitches are brutal - there's nothing more obnoxious than having a server recite the menu to me. No, I don't want any avocado egg rolls or spinach and artichoke dip. Stop asking.  Decent food for a chain-style restaurant, with a pretty large menu. They recently added more taps, but their own beer is worth sampling: the Nutty Brewnette is good, and the PM Porter is fantastic. Even if everything else was awful, the Porter would still bring us back.  Not a spectacular evening out, but a good option for a weeknight dinner."
tom c.,"Arcadia, CA",0,15,6,5.0,8/9/2009,"Service is very good, especially if you get Lisa. The food is exquisite. The prices aren't too bad. It's a loud place but that's because everyone is having so damn much fun. I had the BALSAMIC GLAZED CHICKEN and aichiwawa it was good. We had a PIZOOKIE but couldn't make up our minds about which cookie so Lisa mixed two for us."
Sherral B.,"La Mesa, CA",0,37,,5.0,7/28/2013,I love BJ's in La Mesa.  This is really a great place to go for a nice healthy lunch.  They have a lot of different salads that are all amazing!  The staff is really friendly and you can get in and out of there in a reasonable amount of time.  I would recommend this restarant to anyone.
Sarah T.,"Santee, CA",229,38,,4.0,7/5/2010,"As good as I have found for gluten free pizza.  It wasn't deep dish pizza, but it was divine.  And it's only $8.95 for a huge personal pizza.  My kiddos can share it (11 and 8) and I couldn't finish one by myself.  Great deal if you want yummy gf pizza!"
Kate B.,"Laguna Hills, CA",333,66,41,5.0,11/5/2010,"My family has always gone to the BJ's in Laguna Beach, ever since I was a child. Of course when I was a kid I always got the pizza. I still think it's amazing. And now that I've moved from Seattle to San Diego and have gone on my own I know they have other good things too! Haha. They have so many good things I could go on and on. I've only had one thing I didn't like, and I am the pickiest eater I've ever even heard of, no one has ever been able to tell me of someone worse, and I LOVE this place. They also have take-out which can be very convenient. They'll even bring it to your car, which is great if you have a dog in the car and it's too hot to leave him/her in there or some other circumstance. Try this place, you won't be sorry."
Nikki S.,"La Jolla, CA",0,5,,1.0,7/9/2011,"I usually go to the one in La Jolla, even though it is smaller and I will continue to do so after my visit to this La Mesa location. To start off, the waitress was wearing an bracelet that stated, ""I love boobies"". Really? I am trying to eat, not think about boobs. There are other ways to support breast cancer research. Anyway, I was with my mom, we were seated promptly and the waitress got our drink orders, (2 iced teas). When she brought me my drink, the straw had a sticky substance all over the tip. Lip gloss! I was totally disgusted. Either they are reusing straws, or she gave me someone else's refill. Gross. The menu was changed and they no longer have the pecan salad, which is what my mom wanted. Oh well. I ordered a soup and sandwich (yum) and mom did too, but hers also came with fries, which she didn't want. She asked for a healthy alternative, like fruit and we were told that they only serve fruit on the weekends. Huh? Our waitress says she will try to get them to do fruit, but will give veggies if they don't have any. 5 minutes later, my mom's soup arrives. Not my soup, not our sandwiches, just her soup. She set is aside and we waited another 10 minutes. Finally they bring out the rest of our food, no fruit, no veggies. My mom asked the guy who brought the food where they were and he said he could bring out veggies. He brought a steaming pile of cauliflower with a few broccoli. The were no refills of our drinks, no checking in from the waitress, until she brought our bill. The service was horrible. 1 star rating because: -dirty straw: gross -lack of service: waitress unprofessional and MIA -Poor timing of food brought out: was I supposed to sit there and watch my mom eat? -no fruit on weekdays: that is super lame. Frankly, I will never go back there again."
J W.,"La Mesa, CA",5,4,6,4.0,4/20/2011,Very good food and service in the bar area. No complaints. Always a big crowd. Beer is amazing.
Erreck S.,"Lemon Grove, CA",2,11,1,1.0,11/21/2009,"Be sure you check your food meticulously before eating it, especially if you order pasta. My brother spit out a screw the last time we ate there. and that was the LAST time we ate there. and they had the gall to send my brother a gift certificate to eat at BJ's as a gesture of apology. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?"
