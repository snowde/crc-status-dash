Ashley A.,"San Diego, CA",0,19,2,5.0,8/28/2009,"The food here is really good!! Also, it is a great place to go for a late night happy hour with your friends!! I highly recommend the Buffalo Chicken Pizza or the Meatloaf sandwhich!"
Alexis W.,"Oceanside, San Diego, CA",0,17,1,2.0,1/26/2013,"So, my fiancée and I came here 3 or 4 times with no complaints. Then we came on New Year's Eve. Long story short, the waiter spilled a whole drink on my lap, our wings came boneless when we ordered regular, and then the pizza we ordered with no onions came loaded with them. We brought all of this to our waiters attention, he said he would get the manager. He came back shortly after and gave us the bill...with everything on it and never spoke to the manager for us. So I took it upon myself to go find him, he was very friendly and made it right by us, which was great. So two weekends later we decided to go back because we love it there. I got a daiquiri, and it was disgusting, so sour I couldn't even drink it. I went up to the bar to ask for a different one and I told the bartender what was wrong. He made me a new one, I watched him dump the sour mix in it, and it was worse than the first one, so I just said thank you and gave up on that. We ordered BBQ wings, and we were brought buffalo wings. We ordered a cheeseburger pizza with no onions. It came out with no pickles, but lots of onions. But much different from our previous visit, our waitress was fantastic and fixed our order by bringing us the correct wings and pizza. Our pizookies were almost raw both times too. And not in a good cookie dough like way. I don't know if we will be back to this location!"
Brianne A.,"Santee, CA",22,117,,3.0,8/3/2008,"The food alone would get three and a half stars, but I had to dock them on their wait time and the horrible parking at grossmont center. It's a good place for happy hour, or when no one can decide what they want to eat. You know how it goes......Me: Where do you want to eat? Hubby: I dunno, what do you want? Me: I don't care, it's up to you. If I rated them on the pizookie alone, it would be 5 stars all the way."
Miss H K.,"San Francisco, CA",446,959,1946,5.0,7/1/2007,Food: Delicious! I ordered the lunch portion of the spaghetti which also came with a side of chili. The chili was wonderful...I loved it. Service: Friendly Price: Not bad at all! Pretty cheap for lunch! Location: Located outside of an outdoor mall in La Mesa. Parking is in a lot. Atmosphere: a nice size restaurant. Wasn't too loud or crazy when we were here. Everything was fine.
Cyndi S.,"San Diego, CA",3,79,,3.0,5/22/2007,Many in my family like this place.  For me it is okay.   The Pizzookie is fun and the atmosphere is good.   General food and worth what you pay :-)
Shannon D.,"Tacoma, WA",47,72,49,5.0,6/20/2007,"When I want to go out for pizza, this is were I go. It is just really really good. The soups are good. I LOVE the bar be que chicken pizza. Even their steaks are decent. If you love rootbeer they have some great ones. Only draw back is it is VERY loud inside due to music and talking. Great place to take a date or a group."
Jay S.,"Vista, CA",11,61,2,4.0,4/14/2010,4 stars for the beer and the pizookie. Food is good but nothing that blew my mind. I'd definitely go back or consider this place for dinner before a movie or something like that.
Monica G.,"La Mesa, CA",44,43,,4.0,11/2/2006,"Bj's is fabulous for their Heffenweizen beer and their late night happy hour specials. This is a favorite gathering place for friends after work when beers are about $3 and mini pizzas and apps are at half price.  The bartenders are cool, especially Rudy who empathizes with the late-night-just-got-off-work restaurant crowd. Just be respectful and try not to stay til closing on weekdays because for those of you who have never served or bartended -- it sucks waiting on a bunch of inconsiderate people who have paid their tab an hour ago but won't leave to let you clean up and close."
M L.,"Westminster, CA",107,11,10,4.0,11/28/2010,I love this place. But my Husband and I went yesterday and it took forever to get our food. At least almost 45 mins for 2 small pizza's. But the pizookies are delicious!
E W.,"New York, NY",9,58,,3.0,8/1/2007,"Since we didn't want to wait 15 minutes to be seated, we chose to sit outside on their patio.  The ability to just go sit down in either the bar or patio area was a nice option which we appreciated. The patio is right off the bar and the music in the bar was BLARING.  Thankfully the patio has doors so you don't have to listen to the noise the whole time.  However, whenever someone walked in or out of the patio, the music and noise were pretty deafening.  That was a bit of a mood killer. My husband had the bbq chicken salad which was huge and he said it was very good.  He was totally pleased with his dinner.  I got the salmon entree.  I ordered it blackened and it was a bit too much.  They overpowered the fish with seasoning so I couldn't actually taste the fish.  And there was so much seasoning/dry rub on the fish that it became a crunchy, extremely salty layer.  I could only make it through maybe half of my fish and then I was done.  It was so bad that I declined the to-go box to take it home. To sum up:  our server was nice, we were able to sit down at a table right away, and my husband loved his salad.  The music coming in from the bar was overwhelming and intrusive and my salmon was pretty bad."
Steeney G.,"Mars, PA",3,60,7,4.0,1/21/2010,"I'm definitely a fan of Bj's!   I'll make it easy for ya. Pros: 1. Food- Tasty,delicious and they give you huge portions!  My fav appetizer are the avacado eggrolls.  Recently I tried the thai shrimp lettuce wraps.  They were so good but a little hard to eat because the shrimp falls out of the lettuce. 2. Drinks-as far as mixed drinks they have a ton of different types-huge selection. 3.Desserts-Wide variety but the Pizookie is the best! 4.A ton of seating so usually the wait isn't too bad unless it's fri or sat night. 5.A patio room seperate from the main dining area to have group parties or events. 6. The bar area which has quite a few tables if you want to just have a quick drink and some food with your friends. 7.They are open late.  Do you ever find yourself at 10:00 at night wanting some good food and nothing is open or everyone is closing?  Well not BJ's.  They have late hours which is good for just getting some dessert and a drink late at night or good for a late night craving. The cons:   1.The service can be a little sketchy.  Sometimes it''s good.  Most the time it's ok.  But it hasn't been bad enough to stop me from going there. Most the time it's only so so because they are so busy.  I've worked at a restaurant and I understand how things can so easily get messed up during the dinner rush. 2.The beer.  Their own beers are not good as far as I'm concerned.  The Jeremiah red is decent.  The others just are gross to me and I love beer.  I mean I appreciate beer, no coors,bud or miller anything for me.  3.The atmosphere.  You don't go here to have a one on one talk with your sweetie or your friend or anybody for that matter.  It's loud and sometimes hard to hold a conversation when It gets really busy. 4.  The weekends here are horrendous.  I would so recommend going during the week.  Apparently this is the only restaurant in San Diego on Fri and Sat nights.  Not that it's necessarily the restaurants fault, but you should know that you will often drive by BJ's on the weekend and see the sad faces of those sitting,standing,slumping or crouching people waiting outside to find a table.  If there are that many people outside, there are most definitely a ton inside waiting also.  Just a warning if you have never been before. Overall I will continue to come and enjoy Bj's.  Great food and great desserts. I tried it once and was glad I did.  Of course so are they because they get the check from me :)"
Amanda G.,"El Cajon, CA",52,31,2,4.0,7/22/2010,"This place is great!  There are so many good choices on what to eat, I don't think I've gotten the same thing more than twice.  And I go often!  The drinks are always good and the pazooki is amazing!  The service is always pretty good, too.  My one complaint is that it's usually pretty busy, so sometimes we have to wait a while if we don't want to sit at a bar.  They should expand!"
Tim W.,"San Diego, CA",17,110,13,4.0,7/21/2010,"Usually I would not rate this type of ""brewery"" very well as I don't get the feeling they brew their own beer, they just slap their name on it .  Lots of food that is appealing when I drink. There is something about the location, the setup of the bar, the pizookie!!! that makes me throw them a 4. I don't give the Chula Vista location a 4."
Kevin M.,"San Diego, CA",1,5,,4.0,3/19/2013,I love love love pizza. BJs is seriously the best place for it. I would recommend getting half bacon cheeseburger pizza and half buffalo chicken! Don't forget to get a pizookie for dessert. So bomb!
J A.,"San Diego, CA",0,22,,3.0,3/12/2011,"Very good food, service is pleasant.   I am only giving it 3 stars because a place that has brewhouse in the name should have decent beer; their beer all seems to have the same unpleasant aftertaste, something I've found at other BJ's as well.  The Jeremiah Red is the best of a less-than-mediocre lot. The best thing they could do is fire their brewmasters, destroy their beer-making equipment, and start over.   Or else just buy their beer from one of the many GOOD breweries in the area.   The one just down the street has much better beer."
Michael P.,"La Jolla, CA",0,13,,1.0,3/9/2013,"We have tried this restaurant in La Jolla on Villa La Jolla Drive 5 times and the most recent takeout is the last. It is rare to find food that you just can not eat but this place has this covered. We ordered Chicken Parmesan, took one bite and spit it out. We contacted them via their corporate website and received no response. The reason for this review is to let people know how bad the food is while informing the public that management seems not to even care. This combination is a basis to not eat at BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse."
Theo B.,"San Diego, CA",229,290,50,3.0,3/11/2010,So much better than the one in Chula Vista.  Props for being the OG and having a better vibe.  Can't go wrong with the popular red or blonde beers.  I'm not too impressed with the stouts or porters though.
Zachary G.,"Los Angeles, CA",16,57,4,4.0,7/2/2009,"Was here last night for B-day party of 20 people. Had to wait a bit for a table so we wouldn't be stuck outside with the sun in our eyes, but after about 30 minutes, got a big table and the service was fine. Beer was great, only $3.75 during happy hour (until 7?). 3 of us split the large Mediterranean pizza and subbed the shrimp for chicken (told me it would be $3 extra, then charged us $4.75, but removed it when I asked). I'm a NY pizza snob, but it was pretty awesome. Had to try the 1/2 peanut butter/1/2 choc chip Pizookie and that was great, too. The rest of the food looked like standard white people fare, but the pizza was really good. I wouldn't go out of my way to go to a mall and deal with the crowds, but it's good for a group party or B-day, for sure."
Meghan N.,"Encinitas, CA",29,53,,4.0,4/30/2009,"i get a lot of shit for this...but i like this restaurant. if you have never been, take at least this piece of advice: sit in the bar area...at the actual bar if possible. this is where you are going to get the best service, hands down. if brian, the bartender, is working then i would suggest having him take care of you. he's never messed up my order and he keeps your adult beverages coming...which is muchly appreciated  :)   this place has their own beer and i always get the jeremiah red...yummy stuff! their hefeweizen is pretty good too. they have some tasty appetizers if you're just coming here for snacks with friends. delicious choices: spinach & artichoke dip, southwestern egg rolls and the pot stickers.  my favorite entree from bj's is the sante fe salad...get it with blackened salmon (they also do it with chicken or shrimp)...it is fucking tasty. also good: turkey cobb sandwich, chicken alfredo GIANT potato and the great white pizza. this is a swell place to go with a group of friends for some cold brewskies and good food. this place is also a great choice since it has a pretty big menu so everyone can find something that they like.  soon, you will learn to like bj's too. (hehehehe...dirty.)"
Shauna P.,"San Diego, CA",0,4,,4.0,1/10/2011,Pizza is to die for! Service was excellent. A bit noisy but overall great experience. Dont forget to try a pizooki.
