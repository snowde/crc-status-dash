Arlene S.,"Alpine, CA",0,10,,5.0,12/18/2012,I had the seared Ahi salad and it was the best salad I've had. Alittle noisey but a great place to hang with friends
Jae A.,"San Diego, CA",42,153,12,4.0,6/20/2006,"BJs is always good times. The place can get  a little busy, but nothing intolerable. The dining room is pretty big, suitable for dinner with friends, families, birthdays, etc. And the bar is always bustling with friends grabbing a few brews at happy hour, late night or after work. The service is good, considering how crazy it can get at the bar. And the food is always fresh and tasty. I recommend having their wings. Yum!"
Nikki G.,"San Diego, CA",623,46,20,4.0,1/22/2010,"I've been to BJ's several times. Usually to watch football, have some drinks and to eat. The last time I was their my waitress made me a Mango Mojito and it was pretty good. I also tried the thai shrimp lettuce wraps and they were bomb.  I was teetering on the edge of ordering another round of them but decided to order a mini pizza instead because they were on sale for $5.00. However, I will be back soon to munch out on them again because they were just that good."
Fonso P.,"La Mesa, CA",78,98,19,4.0,3/2/2009,"You know what? I like BJ's, I'm actually a big fan of BJ's (pun intended). I've had some pretty good times here on several occasions over the years. One of the main reasons that I dig this place, goes by the name 'Nutty Brewnette'. It's a delicious brown ale with a hint of sweet, nutty flavor and a solid, smooth taste. The BBQ Chicken Sandwich is also very appetizing and is sure to satisfy. Order both for an awesome beer/sandwich tag team. It's the best tag team since the WWF's Bushwhackers. Then, there's the famous Pizookie, need I say more? And, the icing on the cake (or should I say: the scoop of vanilla ice cream on the warm, over-sized chocolate chip cookie), is their late night happy hour and watching sports on one of the many TV's."
Charlene R.,"Oakland, CA",56,151,,4.0,6/16/2009,"Came here for some drinks and appetizers when we were completley ignored at the Mexican restaurant next door.  I wasn't digging my strawberry margarita (it tasted like a daiquiri, yuck) but BJ's redeemed itself with the Pomegranate Margarita.  That ish was on hit.  Delicious. We ordered the spinach artichoke dip and appetizer sampler platter.  The spinach artichoke dip was good, it just had hella big pieces of artichoke in it.  The appetizer sampler came with egg rolls, mozzarella sticks and avocado rolls.  The egg rolls and mozzarella sticks were average, but the avocado rolls were soooo good.  So good, we ordered another round of them.  We ate and drank so much, that we were waddling out of the restaurant.  It was actually hard to sit up straight, and I felt like I had rocks in my stomach.  But it was well worth it."
Trevor F.,"Bellingham, WA",41,16,,5.0,3/2/2009,"Ok, so I'm a little partial to BJ's cuz it's the place I took my beautiful wife on our first date, and the rest is history. Their microbrews are great, I'm a big fan of the Jeremiah Red, but the pazooki is where it's at. So simple, yet so delicious, I wonder if that's the reason my wife fell in love with me. The fact that you can get it split half peanut butter, and half chocolate chip will keep our marriage in harmony for years to come. The menu is great with a ton of pizzas, and lots of other things, but these are really more of an afterthought when you have great beer and pazookis. If you want your marriage to live in harmony, BJ's is the place to feed it."
Melissa G.,"Bonita, CA",8,49,4,4.0,2/9/2010,"My husband and I love to come here. We bring our 2 year old daughter every once in a while. Bringing a little one isn't hard at BJ's. The servers are very friendly and the atmosphere is comfortable. The beers are good. They have great appetizers and for the root beer lovers, they brew their own root beer that is chocolaty and lovely. The pizookies are a fun treat at the end of the meal if you can fit it after your meal."
Matt R.,"Orange County, CA",20,419,238,2.0,7/30/2009,"Nothing like eating at fellacio's for lunch... who named this place? Seriously?!?! Ok, so I can get past a name. But the food is absolutely AWFUL at this location. How can you screw up pizza you ask? It's hard, but they do it with flair. I got a cheese pizza here. Cheese pizza. It - had - a - bone - in - it. Really there's not much more to say about this place than that. The pizza, even without a bone in it, would have been pretty bad. I would never eat here again. Someone else was paying for it, the time I went here, so they get 2 stars out of respect for that. Otherwise, you get a bone in your mouth... maybe that's why they call it BJ's?"
Eric N.,"San Diego, CA",38,22,,4.0,4/21/2012,"Good Food, Good Price, avoid friday/saturday nights due to parking issues, Great place to hang out during happy hour mon. threw thur."
Alyssa K.,"San Diego, CA",40,144,20,3.0,9/22/2009,"first time i got the stuffed potatoes with chicken? i forget, it was super huge. friend got the pizza, okay, cripsy. boyfriend got the Parmesan Crusted Chicken which was THEE bomb! pizookie was ok.. i can make that myself. hahaha but we kinda got the pizookie for free cause i had the $5 off coupon. second time, came for a friend's birthday. large group, but good service. the strawberry lemon aid was refreshing. my boyfriend & i shared the piranha pale ale nachos, huge & good. the cheese sucked though. i also got to try the chicken wings. it was good :)"
AL S.,"San Diego, CA",206,579,218,3.0,8/30/2009,ONE WORD PIZZOKEE (ok so i cant really spell it) a huge gooey warm cookie with ice cream on top. Their  food is awful but its all about the pazooooki. im pretty sure they use kraft dressing or some crappy substitute on their salads. mediocre at best. again...PAZOOOKIII
Brian D.,"San Diego, CA",0,55,,3.0,3/17/2009,"Here is my main gripe about this place is waitress comes around ok what will you have to drink? Ok the Jeremiah red sounds good sorry we are out, ok then the pm porter will do sorry all out of that one too, then I ask ok what do you have left? Then I settle for something not even close to what I wanted.  If this happened once I wouldn't bring it up but its happened a number of times, when I worked in La Mesa we use to go here for happy hour at least once a week it would happen all the time. I would just think hey you guys make this shit right? If you think your getting low on a certain type of beer or its really popular maybe you should make some more of that shit that everyone orders!  The food is good, pizza is a little over priced but everything is done very well. Overall a good place but don't go out of your way to get here."
Roberto B.,"San Diego, CA",71,116,,3.0,7/26/2010,"BJ's is a great place for group of people. I recommend this place to celebrate any special occasion such as birthdays, and more. They have excellent variety of beers and they are great quality. Then the food is okay, but I recommend that you have dinner somewhere else, but for sure have some drinks in BJ's."
Eric C.,"San Diego, CA",276,98,41,4.0,10/10/2008,"I have to say I had a great time there with my friends. We were greeted in a very polite manner. The wait time took about five min. We were seated in a very good spot. The noise level sounded great. Our servers were very helpful in our orders.They have a lot to choose from, you will be happy with the selection.  We choose the new specials that were just added. Wow they are great! The food that they served is well worth the price point! How can you forget the beer. I asked for a sample of a few of them, no problem. I had a great summer ale.WOW! Chocolate chip with ice cream. We could not finish it. Had food to take home. All in all we had a great time and will go again."
Virginia M.,"El Cajon, CA",40,15,7,3.0,11/10/2008,"I do not frequent this establishment, but it in nice to go once in a while.... Their pizookie is what usually gets me in the door, lol. Service is usually good and I have found some surprisingly good entrees also. Oh yeah and the beer is good too ;) Today I got a half turkey sandwich that came on a toasted garlic french roll w/ avocado, bacon, lettuce, tomato, onion and a blue cheese dressing. Included with that was fries and a wedge salad for only 6.95! Great deal for lunch! Try it out there is actually quite a bit of good food there."
J H.,"Grand Rapids, MI",2,47,1,3.0,2/18/2009,"My husband and I decided to try BJ's since the sign outside said ""Chicago Style Pizza"".  Being from the mid-West, we can appreciate a good Chicago style pizza, but what we got here was NOT Chicago style pizza at all.  It was just a typical deep dish, which if you've had Chicago style you know the difference.  To me this seemed like false advertising and distracted from how much we may have enjoyed the pizza if we hadn't felt misled.  The pricing also would have been perfectly reasonable for true Chicago style, but was a bit overpriced for what you actually got.  Other than that, we enjoyed our meal with overall good quality ingredients, I especially liked the complimentary chunks of tomatoes on the pizza.  As for atmosphere, this place is pretty loud on a Friday or Saturday night. Not an ideal place to have a nice conversation. Just know what you're getting and you won't be disappointed!"
Marwan A.,"San Diego, CA",380,126,5,4.0,1/12/2009,"Great place. I don't live to far, and for my late night cravings I find myself here (not too late). Recently I have gone to the late happy hour (after 10pm), and feast on appetizers. There wings are excellent. And yes their deep dish pizzas are great, but I think I like their think crust Pesto something or other pizza (it in their appetizer menu)...this is so freakin' good! Pizzookis are awesome. I can't remember ever having something here that I didn't enjoy."
Hope W.,"Chicago, IL",11,60,13,2.0,2/24/2009,"They brew their own beer. That's how they got the two stars... it certainly wasn't from their food or service.  I've gone here for lunch a few times and my order is always messed up. Today I went in for takeout and no one even acknowledged me. I was there about 45 minutes, missing my entire lunch break and was late for work. Why? Because they messed up my order. Won't be back. ever."
Mark F.,"El Cajon, CA",71,56,18,4.0,9/6/2008,"This is one of those places with a ton of servers running around where you are never really sure which one is yours. That being said, our dinner last night here was great. We started off with a pitcher of Octoberfest. It was a good, very drinkable lager. My kids enjoyed their meals. A plate of spaghetti that even an adult would enjoy and a small deep dish pizza that (with the help of some of dad's fries) filled up an 8 year old. We had hot sandwiches that were big and tasty. A macadamia nut pazzoka sealed the deal."
Rich J.,"San Diego, CA",0,35,,4.0,4/27/2007,"Good solid comfort food.  BJ's is a chain, but they are a good chain. I'm not too fond of the atmosphere, since it tends to be a bit loud and open. I'd rather it feel a bit more private, but you can't have everything. The food is filling and very good. The Jambulaya is excellent and is worth waiting for--which you'll do if you come here on a Friday evening or weekend. Try it with their heffenweizen for a great combo. Of special note is the pazookie, a kind of huge warm, soft cookie with icecream on it. Big enough to split with your better half, but you'll probably want one all to youself."
