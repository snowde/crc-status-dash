Courtney G.,"New York, NY",20,73,12,4.0,4/17/2009,"When I first came to California a friend brought me here cause she loved it, and now I bring people here cause I love it. I've never had a problem with getting a seat or getting my favorite beer at all. The waitresses are always nice and the food is always yummy. They now also have a half price  appetizers & pizza :)"
Miguel V.,"Miami, FL",93,436,92,4.0,10/9/2008,"I'll be completely honest, this place only gets the fourth star for the pizookie. You can't beat that thing. I absolutely love all of the different kinds. We usually order the half and half because I am adventurous and my wife sticks to the chocolate chip. Of course, neither of us can finish one by ourselves so we share. As for the food, my wife really loves the chef salad, which is pretty simple and standard, but they do not screw it up, so it is very good. She also loves the loaded baked potatoes with the works! I mean sour cream, bacon, chives, butter, and any other form of cholesterol you can think of.        For me, I really enjoyed the salmon salad, which was very big. Actually, I believe it was the southwestern salad with grilled salmon on it, but it was very, very good on each occasion that I tried it. I believe it includes corn, beans tortilla strips, a smokey, chipotle type sauce, and some very moist and delicious salad. I have also tried the ribs, chicken and some other type of grilled bbq meat combo, which was anything but impressive. It was a little dry and tough, and the bbq sauce had been thrown on post hoc (e.g., not marinated). the ribs were especially difficult to eat and hardly worth the mess. They are also a brewery so try the sampler, figure out which you like and enjoy. I like the darks and the reds too, while the wife prefers the blondes.        All things considered, why do they barely earn four stars? Well, aside from the reasons noted above, they are often crowded, difficult to get seating as they do not do reservations, difficult in large groups because they won't split checks, etc. They can be a real pain about this kinda stuff. So go early, not on weekends, and not during events."
Sue L.,"San Diego, CA",1,20,,4.0,8/4/2011,"I am addicted to their chicken wings, and I never even new I liked chicken wings until I tried them here!  Otherwise, most things on the menu are pretty good, not great.  My husband is a huge fan of the Jeremiah Red beer."
D T.,"Portland, OR",14,43,18,5.0,11/28/2012,"So was looking for a casual dinner with some good beers and stopped in. I was  sat a table and quickly attended to by my server. I have eaten at Bj's before but have never had a server who did much more than take my order, refill my water and give me my bill. That is fine but i really appreciate when I receive outstanding service.  That was the case this time my server in think her name was Jaclyn (SP?) tall with long dark hair was very informative with with regard to my questions about the menu and which would go best with my beer (Tantonka Stout .)I initially chose to drink.  I was not planning on getting an appetizer but Jaclyn talked me into trying the avocado egg rolls which I was not sure I would like,, wrong they were delicious. She made several  entree suggestions  and of those I picked the grilled pork chops a great match with the stout. The entree was prepared very well other than the veggies being a little over cooked. Jaclyn made sure my beer or water were never empty  and she quickly got me a new knife after I knocked my first one to the ground. FInally although I did not need it I was sold that I had to try the Red Velvet Pazookie, hot moist  and tasty. Overall the food was good to excellent, the beer was full bodied and flavorful, but the most outstanding aspect of the meal was the top notch service. I will be back and hopefully I get sat in Jaclyn's section again!"
Alma W.,"West Hollywood, CA",13,167,16,4.0,3/28/2009,"Oh Bj's... why are you soo far from me? You need to be in north county! From the beginning to end, everything was excellent! I tried the scampi pasta, delicious! The chicken wings are to-die-for. The patio is comfortable and just has a very relaxing vibe. Most definitely coming back soon!"
Daniel R.,"San Diego, CA",141,37,1,4.0,9/6/2009,"Visited here on a Friday night at 10:15pm.  The entire bar was packed out.  The restaurant was about half full.  Very loud and energetic atmosphere.  Friendly waitress, Stephanie was her name.  Ordered the signature Porter and the appetizer of sliders.  The beer exceeded my expectations.  Chewy, dark, rich, smoky, and a hint of chocolate, just like a good porter should be.  The appetizer took a bit longer than it should have, but it was well worth the wait.  Four good sized sliders (for a slider that is) accompanied with a generous portion of wedge cut fries.  Lettuce, tomato and pickle were on the side, nice.  Delicious and hot.  After about 45 mins the place filled up to standing room only.  I'm not sure what was going on for it to be this crowed on a late Friday night, but it added to the atmosphere.  Kudos to BJ's.  Will return soon."
John S.,"San Diego, CA",26,63,12,4.0,9/11/2008,"Yeah, this place is good. Pizza is decent, salads are great but LOVE the Beer! I defiantly like to sit in the bar and eat (faster service). Cool place to meet up with friends and throw a couple back! Will return for sure!"
Leah H.,"La Mesa, CA",0,11,,5.0,9/4/2011,"First of all, we had the nicest server ever.  The menu was so good, I wanted to try a bunch of different things.  It was really priced well for the portions you get.  The appitizer was huge and so delicious.  The salad was big and fresh and they didn't scrimp on the good stuff.  I am really picky and BJ's is so good on all counts.  Price, quality, service and taste!  Love it.  Will be back soon."
Dawn B.,"Sacramento, CA",26,159,2,4.0,11/26/2007,"Maybe it was because I was already drunk by the time I got there, but I thought BJ's was pretty good.  I'll skip the details that were already mentioned (it's loud, feels like an Applebee's, and is crowded with families with kids) and get to what I believe makes this place worth a stop.  The happy hour specials.  In addition to drink discounts, they've also got half price mini-pizzas in the bar and discounts on all of their appetizers.  Sweet Jesus, I'm in heaven.  With the holiday season approaching (and all of the stress that goes with shopping) I'm sure I'll be saddled up at the bar on a regular basis."
Maria G.,"El Cajon, CA",0,3,,1.0,10/5/2013,"Went to bj's last night, 10/04/13 around 9 pm, to kick off my birthday and it was completely horrible! Our server, long blonde hair in ponytail and glasses, was no where to be found half the time. The kitchen messed up our order and after she came to clear the table her response was ""oh i know, I'll take care of it for you"". Nothing was comped, and she didn't offer to have them remake it. She knew it was wrong when she brought it out but decided that would be ok? The whole party was constantly waiting for drink orders and refills while she kept walking past the table. The hostess,dark skin girl with the ends of her hair dyed blonde, was standing in between tables texting on her phone and dragging her feet instead of working. This was the least busy I have ever seen it and also the worst service I have ever received there. The food was cold, and we essentially had no server. I had to go to the bar just to get my drink. The bartender,garret?, was fast and friendly. I probably won't be back to say the least, made a yelp just to write a review about the terrible service."
Nikki N.,"La Mesa, CA",1,13,,5.0,5/29/2008,Love BJs!  there have been more nights than I would like to admit I have dragged my daughter up there just to have the PIZZOOKIE!!!!!! It's a girl thang...
Dave G.,"San Francisco, CA",351,137,1,5.0,9/18/2006,"The Jeremiah Red is is one of the most violent beers on the planet. Four pints of these will turn a pacifist into a blood-thirsty cannibal. Some of my friends have been arrested after drinking it, on charges of savegery and mayhem. The buffalo chicken pizza is also amazing."
Scott S.,"Twentynine Palms, CA",19,113,1,2.0,12/8/2008,"let me start by saying that the service was horrendous.  we had a table of 8 people.  i asked the waiter if we could get our drinks refilled.  he came by with a a carafe of water and refilled my drink and only mine.  the rest of the table all had empty glasses and got nothing.  10 minutes later, the waiter hadn't come back yet so someone had to go get some random dude to get us refills. this was how most of the meal went.  someone ordered a diet pepsi and got nothing.  half of the toppings i ordered on my pizza didn't show up on the actual pizza.  dessert took a good 20 minutes to make it out of the kitchen despite the restaurant not being busy. and to top it all off, one of the people in my group had their car broken into while we were eating because grossmont center is a frigging craphole. this place gets two stars, though, because the food was actually really good.  the pizza is buttery and delicious.  the meatball sandwich was great.  the dessert cookie things were really good too. good for food, bad for service and safety of your vehicle."
Sky G.,"San Diego, CA",0,59,,2.0,10/25/2013,"I've been here a couple of times, and always remember after I get there why I don't go more often.  First of all, even though the place was virtually empty, they tried to sit my BF and I at one of those cramped booths.  I asked for a bigger booth, and she let us have the table next to the window that seats four people.  Much more comfortable.  Food was okay, but my BF said his Black and Blue flatbread didn't have much taste, and after trying a section I agreed.  My chcken quesadilla was much better.  When the waitress dropped off the check, she told us to take our time, but TOOK AWAY the hot sauces that he was using!  He still had half his flatbread on the plate!  Later when she came by she had her left arm full of dirty plates and tried to pick up our now empty plates.  She was having trouble doing so, and in the meantime my BF had this pile of dirty plates next to his face.  I don't know if she was in a hurry to leave or what, but it did not feel relaxing while we finished up our drinks.  She was very pleasant though, but I don't think I'll be putting any points on my loyalty card."
Nichole B.,"San Diego, CA",6,91,,4.0,10/17/2007,"This is a great place. The wait can get pretty long on the weekends. I'm not a beer fan so I can't comment on their beers, but they do have a large selection. I have always had good service."
Jelly F.,"Seattle, WA",36,52,,3.0,1/3/2008,Decent sandwiches and pastas. The thing to try is the beers & pazokies (small cookie cake with ice cream). Their home brewed root beer was refreshing and their beers are pretty tasty.
Tejasvi K.,"La Mesa, CA",0,1,,4.0,10/10/2013,iam in love with service definitely going back
Kari S.,"San Diego, CA",78,385,43,2.0,2/22/2008,I'm really not a fan of BJ's. I think that their pizza crust is too greasy and the lettuce in the salads hasn't been that fresh. I do like the garlic bread appetizer and the pazooki but over all not worth the price.
Gene H.,"El Cajon, CA",10,144,,4.0,11/17/2008,"I think this place has enough reviews, but i haven't read anyone raving about their open face meatloaf sandwich, mashed taters, gravy, deep fried onions........heavenly, great beers, good mini pizza's special price at happy hour, noisy, Pirranah pale ale..........yeh, it's good........."
Joe C.,"Chula Vista, CA",29,10,,1.0,12/21/2009,"Went there for my b-day dinner and had the worst experience ever.  First off the order was wrong i got a burger and a pizza, the pizza was delicious.  The burger was ordered WELL done and it was pink in the middle and cold also the fries were colder than cold,  after trying to hunt our waitress down for almost 10min i had a few bites of the burger.  About 20min later our waitress came back to ask how everything was and i then explained the fries were cold and the burger was pink in the middle and pretty cold, so she was kind and said sorry for everything and would speak to the manager and fix it, well a few min later she brought the bill over and explained she could't do anything cause i took a bite of the food and went on to say it was not her call but the managers, i totally understand they need a managers approval so i asked to speak with her manager and she kindly said yes ill go get him. Anyhow he never showed up to apologize or to speak to me and as were leaving the restaurant i see her speaking to the manager and i knew he was the manager cause i went to approach him and he stormed into the kitchen!!!! WOW talk about being unprofessional i asked the waited whats all that about your manager doesnt care about customer service? She again apologized and said her manager said he was too BUSY to deal with us,  i just said ok and walked out, im sorry but thats is absolutely unprofessional i eat there maybe once every few weeks but im positive that will be the last time. To get treated like that in a restaurant  wow im done and to top it off it was my b-day!!!!! never again will i give bjs business thanks to there ""BUSY"" managers!!!!"
