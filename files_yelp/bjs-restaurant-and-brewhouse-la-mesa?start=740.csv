steve m.,"San Francisco, CA",1,30,4,5.0,12/31/2007,"Great pizza but save room for a Pizookie.  I usually order a pepperoni with grilled chicken.  The only downside is it could use more sauce.  All types of Pizookie are great so come with a group, order them all, and pass them around the table."
Paul F.,"Virginia Beach, VA",14,23,4,5.0,11/20/2010,Great food awesome beer try their nutty brown!
George C.,"San Diego, CA",26,128,29,4.0,7/30/2007,"Food was good, I have the grilled chicken pasta, everything was good about it.  It came with broccoli and garlic bread and of course the chicken.  Nothing to complain about.  Service was great, she was on top of everything.  Completely satisfy."
John F.,"San Diego, CA",0,53,,4.0,10/13/2007,"When this place first opened the food was absolutely horrible and we sat so long without any service (like 20+ minutes -- I timed it after it started getting ridiculous) that I finally lost amusement from timing it and had to go tell the manager.    I did not go back for several years.   Nowadays the food is actually very good.   The pizza is definitely worth a try and I also like several of the sandwiches.   The ""fries"" are really good battered potato wedges.   The downside is it is SOOOOO noisey.    You can't hear people speaking very loudly right across from you because the entire place has an open floorplan and everyone is yapping, tv's are going, etc."
Tyler T.,"San Diego, CA",0,9,,4.0,2/1/2011,Good beer. Good food. What's not to like? Try the California chicken sandwich.
Kyle J.,"El Cajon, CA",0,18,2,4.0,4/9/2009,"BJ's is cool. Their beers are really nice, the Hef is awesome. The Balsamic Chicken is my favorite thing on the menu. Like one other person said, do not try the Cajun Pasta if you are not a fan of spicey. I LOVE spicy food and it was too much for me.  Oh and the oreo pzookie makes panties come off Go There!"
Jeff F.,"San Diego, CA",57,51,10,4.0,7/20/2009,"Don't let the name fool you, this chain restaurant doesn't suck. I've been here a few times with big groups and it's always been good. The signature beers they brew are great. I'm a big fan of the ""Jeremiah Red"". They pose as a Chicago-style pizza place but the only thing ""Chicago"" about their pizza is that it's deep dish. The dough lacks the necessary blend of cornmeal and water from Lake Michigan that gives Chi-town pizza dough it's truly unique flavor.  All the other items on the menu are delicious. I've had sandwiches, salads and pasta there and have never been disappointed. The prices are VERY reasonable too considering how huge the portions are. The servers are friendly and helpful. I gotta give a HUGE shout-out to Garon, who was our server on July 13th, 2009. This guy was awesome; energetic, genuinely happy, friendly, and worked his ass off to accommodate our large group. If you're going to BJ's, request to sit in this guy's section. He deserved every penny of the +20% tip that I left."
Alessa S.,"El Cajon, CA",53,99,58,3.0,3/6/2008,"The pizza's good.  The Caesar salad has tasted old and wilty every time.  The last time my sister and I got strawberry lemonade and it tasted like nail polish remover.  The waiter insisted that nothing was wrong with it.  The next time my sister got root beer and they said there were no refills (they gave refills the other times she got it).  Usually I leave feeling insulted by the waiters.  Not my fave.  Oh, and it took me 3 years to actually read the menu and see that it's called a Pizookie, as in a pizza cookie.  All the time before I thought people were ordering Bazookies..."
Reico P.,"San Diego, CA",0,49,19,5.0,9/2/2012,"every time i go here i get wasted and spend to much money, got there today and had what I usually have a deep dish pizza and the 8 beer sampler to start with. good food and great loation."
Elizabeth H.,"San Diego, CA",1,18,3,5.0,1/30/2008,"How can I not give it 5 stars when the food here is always great?  This place is always busy and for good reason.  Considering the crowd, BJ's is always noisty too.  If you're looking to engage in soulful conversation, this isn't the place for it.  Consistenly good food and quick service are the main reasons for BJ's success.  They have good happy hour prices in their bar (mini pizzas half price, $2 off other appetizers).  Lettuce wraps are always superb!"
Lena C.,"San Diego, CA",57,19,1,3.0,8/17/2008,"So..I got a few funny stories about BJ. The food is always alright, not the best but not the crapiest.  However, I look their pizookie.  Heaven on earth. A few years back, service sucked bad.  I used to need to hail down 3 different servers before I could get ketchup.  don't believe me...first time was the waiter, I asked for ketchup, he never came back.  I hailled a guy who was walking by.  he told me ""i'll go get your server"".  for ketchup?  That's messed up.  My server still didn't come back.  This was after 10minutes...so I hailed down another server.  And HE told me the exact same thing.  I still don't see my server coming back with ketchup.  so I got fed up.  I got up and stopped another worker and told him to pass me the ketchup that I saw was stocked behind the counter.  besides looking at me a little weirdly, he did as I asked.  after 15mins I finally got my ketchup and able to eat.  That was the last time I was there for a 1 1/2 years.  Of course, on my drive there (1 1/2 years later) I was telling my friends about the crappy service but the good pizookie (whole reason why I even wanted to go there).  We only about 15mins to get drinks, and after that service picked up.  triple time better than a year ago.  Seeing how I enjoyed their service again, I decided to keep on coming back.  Good choice on my behalf.  The last time I went there, I got a free pizza.  And the time before that, I got a freel meal. however, those stories will be told after my ratings. 1 star for service.  awesome service these days, I recommend going back there just for it. 1 star for food...I usually give 2 stars if it's good...but 1 and it's just for the freaking cookie. 1 star for atmosphere.  Very large and roomy.  I have a lot of breathing room except when the couple next to us decides to makeout the whole time during dinner. price is a little on the expensive side.  but it's bearable.  their jack is 12 a pop...for a double shot and it wasn't a double shot. now back to my stories..for those who wants to hear. my free pizza was simple.  The server had messed it up and got us another one.  But before we had to wait another 15 after our 20mins wait he gave us a free dessert.  Awesome.  Had lots of left over that night. My free meal was unbelievable.  my friend and I were just ordering 3 appetizers, 1 entree, and 1 dessert.  we wanted to take some home that night.  Somehow the waitress messed up and gave us some birthday special which was a free meal, minus the pizookie that my friend had order at the last minute to take home for her boyfriend.  Of course, we did not take advantage of her, we left about $60.  Our meal was going to be $60 anyways and I was not going to pay less just because it was free, if I knew I was going to spend that amount, I will.  What she did with the money is up to her, but it frees my conscious of ripping people off (even though they make a lot of money).  Overall...my last few encounters at BJ has been interesting.  Who knows what will happen next! :)"
Greg W.,"San Jose, CA",34,34,,5.0,6/14/2008,"BJ's just might be my favorite restaurant. I'm not as big on the Grossmont location as I am the others because the bar area is always jam packed at night, but it's still a great place. Parking is also very difficult at this mall on the weekend.  BJ's makes really good beer and has a big selection of other imports and exports. I had BJ's Hefeweizen on my 21st birthday and it was the first beer I ever actually enjoyed, paving the way for all the others and my growing beer gut (worth it). The food is pretty good, the pizza is fantastic. If you come for happy hour, you can get a mini pizza for $3. The pizooki is amazing, but I usually can't eat one because I fill up so much on the entree and beer. I go to BJ's more than any other place."
Mike M.,"Honolulu, HI",10,24,,4.0,5/2/2008,"This restaurant is a regional chain from the LA area.  I used to frequent the ones up in Oxnard and Woodland Hills. Seeing as I liked them up there it was a pleasant surprise to find that they had a franchise down in La Mesa.  I immediately stepped in and enjoyed the same great beer and cider (Berry Burst) I was used to up in LA.  The food is very good, although I have had better.  You also get pretty good-sized portions.  I just wish it was closer.  Oh...and as weird as this might seem...they also brew their own root beer.  It is very good and puts A&W and all fountain root beer to shame.  Lastly, they are famous for their ""Pizookie"" a fresh-baked deep dish cookie (Choc Chip, Peanut Butter, White Choc Macadamia Nut, or Oatmeal) with a big scoop of ice cream on it.  Great for 2."
jaslyn h.,"El Cajon, CA",1,13,,5.0,1/31/2009,"I've been to BJ's more than a few times and I am never diappointed. Some people detracted a star for wait time and lack of parking. Well, you wait because everyone else is there cause they know it's good too...and you are parking at a mall next to a Target and Casa de Pico. Whaddya want, a parking structure dedicated to BJ's? Anyway, their beer is outstanding. I am a beer girl. I love the piranha pale ale. While we waited last time we just went to the bar, got some great service, and were seated in 25 minutes (this is at 6pm on a Friday, so not too bad really). Had chips and salsa to start...their salsa is really good for an all-american joint. And of course the BJ's Favorite deep dish pizza was sooo delectable, even the next day when I had it for breakfast :) I saw that they have a sunday brunch thing going on, i hope to try that out in the near future."
Jeanae K.,"San Diego, CA",1,35,6,3.0,11/1/2009,"it was okay, the salad was nasty,the food was nothing special but They have great service and good drinks!"
Jess J.,"La Mesa, CA",0,3,,4.0,8/3/2009,"BJ's sounds like a dirty name for a place to eat and drink. But it is actually quite clean and delicious. They have decent happy hour prices and even have a late night happy hour for night owls. It's a great place to go for an appetizer, beer or dessert before or after seeing movie at Grossmont Center...I recommend the frambois drink...a tart, fresh cider that makes you smack your lips. I also LOVE their chocolate chip pizookie...a fresh-out-of-the-oven chocolate chip cookie in a shallow pan with vanilla ice cream on top...mmm so sweet and humbling! Their Minestrone soup is a bit salty, but I adore the spinach and artichoke dip, the chips and salsa, the mini pizzas, and especially the baked potatoes (vegetable medley is da bomb!) BJ's will leave you feeling completely satisfied. The only downfall is how noisy it is in there. Don't take your hard of hearing grandparents to BJ's or you'll be yelling the entire time!"
Dean E.,"La Mesa, CA",54,12,,4.0,1/14/2011,"fun little place, good grub and great service!"
catherine r.,"El Cajon, CA",0,7,,5.0,10/18/2010,"What a great place to go for lunches.. get the halve sandwich, salad and thin crispy french fires.. We loved the deal, and the food was really good. Sure get a lot for your money on their lunch specials..Hubby and I found another new place for lunch."
K D.,"La Mesa, CA",0,60,,5.0,3/20/2010,"Love, love LOVE this restaurant. The food is SOOO good! And the dessert (Pazookis?) are to DIE for. The restaurant is very classy looking and the waiters are all clean cut and very helpful. My husband and I are regulars at this place. And there is a lot of seating, so not a bad wait usually! But even if there was....it would be SOOO worth it! Try their bbq chicken pizza....SO good."
Mira K.,"San Diego, CA",8,186,3,3.0,9/18/2009,the food is awful. drinks are acceptable. dine elsewhere and come here for pizzookie! delightful.
