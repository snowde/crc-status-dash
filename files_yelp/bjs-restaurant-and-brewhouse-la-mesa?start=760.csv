tyler k.,"San Diego, CA",51,35,8,5.0,6/22/2010,good food good service and great fun!!! if thats on your list for going out to eat then i would tell you to goto this place... my favorite is the deep dish cookies with icecream on top but the cookies are not deep dish tho.. but also the no gluten pizzas are really good but i like their reg. pizza dough with pizza sauce. :) Hope you have fun!!
Barry H.,"San Diego, CA",288,235,8,3.0,6/19/2008,"Went back last night with dad.  He sprang and he really likes the place.  It was hopping as usual.  The service was pretty solid-not like a 5 star fancy restaurant but good for a beer/burger place. The greeters and seaters were nice, friendly and cute.  The waitress was pretty pleasant.  She came by to take our drink and appetizer order and when we briefly wavered on which appetizer to order she disappeared for a while.  I thought it would have been nice if she had said, ""let me give you a moment to think about it and I'll return"" but she just turned away and left.   We had the potato skins (dad's favorite) and artichoke dip and chips.  Then I had my usual BJ Cobb.  I forgot to order the lunch size so there was way too much.  Dad ordered the Cobb sandwich  There was way more food than we needed and I simply laughed when she was clearing our half eaten plates and asked if we had any room for dessert.  All in  all a pretty solid experience once again.  Don't expect haughty cuisine but a tasty meal."
andrew s.,"La Mesa, CA",0,6,,1.0,7/6/2010,"I hate to be a negative Nancy but omg this place stinks like tuna!  I took my lil cuz and some of her girls out for a few drinks for her Bday.  worst choice i have made in a while....I work in the industry so i have a awesome eye for epic joints.  also born and raise in the finest city so i know this town and the best places to have a blast and receive service. my douche bag of a server brad saw that his five top wasn't going to score more then a few cocktails and some apps. turned into king sour puss.  He actually ""tush"" at me when he left the table.  i have never pick up such bad vibes from a dude. let alone a server in a brewery.  I was so pissed at this kid i called the manager over for a lil chat. Scott was the dudes name and he asks me ""what seems to be the problem?""  I reply BRad!! is a horrible server and treated us like monkey poop!!!  I felt like I was a bum and because i wasn't eating dinner i shouldn't be sitting in brads precious section.  Scott replies ""brad is one of our best servers.""  I couldn't believe my ears.  this kid couldn't give service to a bunch of school girls in plaid handing out free.BJ's.  First off he didn't know an ale. from a larger!! how do u serve in a microbrewery and not know your beer.  he didn't even help me pick my beer or offer samples.  This brad guy isn't serving me any more i told the dude.  I couldn't have that guy come back to our table again.. i wasn't going to let a loser attitude punk kid ruin my lil cuzs night.  so a chick with a nice smile finished off the night with great service.  my advice to you is if your looking for a night of shitty service bad vibes bland food and flat beer...head for bj's.  the spot in La Mesa for brew and eats is Johnny B's burgers and brew.  Eat some raw hops Scott and Brad cuz u bitter.  learn how to create an atmosphere of good times and cheer.   The customer is always right man haven't you heard!"
Christine J.,"San Diego, CA",2,129,,3.0,6/2/2009,"I had an epiphany this weekend.  BJs just doesn't have any good beers!! I am from the Czech Republic and I freakin know a good beer.  I ordered the sampler and was unusually disappointed by every brew.  I give them credit for the pizookie and their artichoke dip (although the dip portion seems to be getting continually smaller).  The pizza is quite overpriced even though the flavor is good.  The bottom line is if you are a brewery, you should have fantastic beer, whether its a stout or hefeweizen.  Gordon Biersch surpasses the beer factor at BJs even though the food there is worse."
Bubba N.,"Alpine, CA",129,284,3,4.0,3/28/2009,"1 of my favorites. i give 5stars to places that are perfect taste-wise/service-wise consistantly for years.  happy hr is great: half-priced mini pizzas, & drink specials.  staff has never been rude & has only gotten more friendly/efficient over the years.  very attractive staff(female friends say the dudes are hot as well).  i love to get buzzed before or after a movie at grossmont center. would give BJs 5stars if it was godlike food you could get from little italy in NY , IL, or SF."
Anna L.,"San Diego, CA",192,158,5,3.0,3/26/2008,"With a pitcher of Nutty Brewnette in front of us, I made the mistake of daring my boyfriend to slap me (thinking there was no way he would.)  That's right, gentle readers, I got bitch slapped in the middle of BJ's.  I am a fool.  After a delightful Santa Fe salad (lettuce, blackened chicken, corn, tomatoes, cheese, red peppers, tortilla strips, avocado, and awesome spicy chipotle dressing) I had a Tangerine Tango drink from their specialty menu (I appreciate that underneath each drink synopsis the employee who invented it is given credit.)  On a separate visit, I ordered two of those drinks, but they were completely different from each other, and our server would just not have it fixed for me.  But on the particular night in question, we had a cool girl as our server.  She was funny, she kept us updated on the status of our meal's preparation, and she kept close enough eye on us without coming around too much.  We played a little joke on her, after bf slapped me silly, and convinced our darling little waitress that we had met on EHarmony, and I would be writing a letter of complaint to them about being slapped by my date.  She was sure it was true, even when we came clean."
solar e.,"National City, CA",107,74,42,2.0,12/11/2008,i have tried this place twice and both times i have been unimpressed. the wait time was horrendous and the food is not worth the wait.  the service was nothing spectacular and the only thing i could look forward to was a beer.  after my first time being there i thought it was just a bad experience but tried it again for the second time and it was no better that the first....i can tell you now there wont be a third.
Miss S.,"La Mesa, CA",21,81,2,1.0,6/13/2008,"This was my first and most likely only time at BJ's. I gave it one star because we were seated quickly despite the long line. We went for lunch on a Thursday. We were seated at a booth and the seats still had crumbs on them. After this, the whole experience went down hill. It was around 12:30 in the afternoon and they were out of some of their appetizers. We ordered simple lunch size portions of their pasta/salad and soup/sandwich. Twenty minutes after getting our drinks we still had not been served our appetizers, soup or salad. We noticed people getting served before use despite arriving after we had been seated. We left without eating when someone brought us food (appetizers) that we didn't order. We don't think our server put in our order correctly or was competent. She had brought us wrong condiments for our appetizers (ketchup and mustard does not go with potstickers). It shouldn't take 25 minutes to make a caesar side salad and ladle up a bowl of chowder. We might not have left if the server had checked up on us and apologized for the delay(just so we knew that food was coming and they had not run out or that she messed up our order)."
