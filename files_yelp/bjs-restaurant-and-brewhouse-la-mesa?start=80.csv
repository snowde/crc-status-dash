Sharlet P.,"San Diego, CA",2,11,15,5.0,6/27/2017,"In all honestly I was look for an excuse to come back, they have an open bar dinning area good food great people ."
Amy M.,"San Diego, CA",16,8,32,5.0,5/12/2017,Pickup orders are a breeze!! Kiana was so great and helpful. Even got a free iced tea!! Easy and fast. Parking can be hard but the food is consistently great and I can't wait to come back and enjoy it again!
Katy D.,"Santee, CA",55,2,,1.0,7/14/2017,"I have been here for 3 hours. Just my gf and myself are here for dinner. We waited a long time for our waitress to even ask us what we wanted to drink, longer for our food order to be taken, and even longer for our food to come out. I sat staring at half of my plate of disappointing pasta that I wanted to take home waiting for my waitress to appear once I finished eating. I almost didn't mention the free mini pazookie that I ordered because frankly I didn't want to wait and guess what? I waited awhile for that too..I almost just tried to pay somehow and leave because I am so tired of being here. It's loud. We're watching parties around us get their food and leave before we even got the check. I won't be coming back here again. I'd rather cook my own food and relax for the amount of time I spent here and mediocre quality food."
Michelle C.,"Vista, CA",37,113,182,3.0,5/10/2017,"On May 5, 2017, I was with my hubby family side for lunch.  We all got there around 1130-noon. It was 8 adults and 2 kids. My point of view I don't know why we had to wait to get our table. It wasn't as busy yet.  After awhile once we sat down we all orders our drinks. I'd order dr. Pepper, once we got our drinks I had a sip of it. I realize it wasn't dr.pepper, I made my hubby try it and he said it was a diet drink so then I waited for the waitress to come back and tell her. They finally got the right drink. We all notice at the table there were no utensils at the table. They finally provided us the utensil before the food arrive.  My hubby utensils was dirty which had food still stuck on the forks and knives. My sister in law, mother in law ordered some type of salad which had no dressing on it. We all asked if she wanted dressing but she didn't want to fuss about it, so she said no.  The waitress were next to non existence throughout our time there.  At the end of the meal I asked for my drink in a Togo cup she never brought it to me, so I was like whatever. That was the worst customer service I ever had there. The waitress name was Paige b. So I finally saw my email which showed a response to my review that I posted. I read it and the manager Braxton wrote back, saying  he wanted to talk to me. So I decided to call him back and see what he wanted to say to me. He said he apologized for what happened, and wanted my feedback to improve the restaurant for the near future.  I was surprised what he gave me because I told him it wasn't just me that was in the party.  He gave a good amount of gift cards. I provided him my email address so that he can email me the gift cards. He understood the situation which greatly helped the situation and experience."
zack V.,"Salt Lake City, UT",1,26,2,2.0,6/4/2017,"On our first family vacation to San Diego we fell in love with BJs brew house! After our experience last night, my wife stated ""this love affair is over."" From the start: somehow we lost our spot on the list. I don't know how, I have theories, although it doesn't really matter 'cause it happened. After standing around like morons for far too long, we asked again about our wait and were told that we were not on the list... The front door staff got us seated shortly after, so, ok... Then after waiting for what now seemed like eternity, I finally got up and stopped one of the waitresses that were doing their best to skirt our table and asked if she could find who our server was. She reluctantly said that ""apparently she would be our waitress..."". Again, ok. Our food was all pretty simple: burgers, fries, salads, pizza, etc. after 45 minutes and the last of my hair falling out, a different server brought our meals. The burgers seemed to be the hold up, because they were pretty fresh. Everything else had obviously been waiting for the burgers, because it all pretty much sucked... We usually hit this place a few times while we are in town, but it is time to find a new spot. I feel like I'm losing an old friend, but I can't go on paying $80+ for such a poor experience. The two stars, well, I had one of the burgers that was pretty good.  And I still have fond enough memories to not issue a one..."
Lauren S.,"Murrieta, CA",0,1,,1.0,6/30/2017,"2nd time ordering from BJ's for curbside. 2nd time not receiving fries with my burger. The first time, sure I thought maybe it was me. 2nd time, I checked to make sure the website said that my burger comes with fries and it did. I'm paying $12 for a burger, I would think fries would come with it. But if course, no fries. Again. My curbside lady was super nice and I gave her a $10 tip. I live 14.5 miles from the nearest BJ's. To order curbside, drive that distance, and not even get what I ordered is completely disappointing and makes me feel that my business does not matter whatsoever. I'm sure it goes without saying, I will definitely not be ordering or going to any BJ's because apparently, they cannot get it right."
Justin N.,"San Diego, CA",5,7,34,1.0,11/20/2016,"I came here with my Mom for Sunday's dinner, ordered New Orleans Jambalaya. My Mom order Salmon Quinoa. Both were disappointed, it was so salty, that we can't even eat it. I have to tell the waitress to send it back. Very disappointed, it was my Mom first time here."
Aisa H.,"San Antonio, TX",154,276,238,5.0,1/19/2016,"My boyfriend and I went in on President's Day because I just wanted to have some of their pizza and my boyfriend has never been to a BJs restaurant! We got there and had about a 15 minute wait (not bad considering no reservation on a holiday night). The staff (from those that greeted us, seated us, waited, served and said good bye to us) we're very friendly and helpful. It felt like we were seated in less than 15 minutes.  Our server, Trey, was very nice and attentive throughout our meal (even though he was serving a big party and serval smaller parties around us).  I ordered one of my favorites, The Great White, in a mini pizza and had their root beer (one of the only places I'll order root beer really). My boyfriend ordered the country fried steak meal with an Ultimate Long Island iced tea (also a good choice and can hit me pretty quick!). We didn't have to wait too long for our foodies to come out and our server was still good on trying to keep everyone's drinks filled. The foodies was hot and tasted like foodies I was craving (translation=it was good lol). My boyfriend enjoyed his drinks and country fried steak (also took a nibble and liked how it was made). We also made enough room for some pizzookies! We ended up ordering the trio so we could try different flavors (the triple chocolate, cookies and cream and the salted caramel). All of which were awesome and satisfying to many people's sweet tooth.  Overall, even though this location got pretty busy, the service didn't suffer and the foodies was good. I highly recommend a pizzookie whenever you do decide to drop in to BJs!"
e.m. N.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,2.0,9/28/2017,"I ordered curb-side pick-up and when I got there, not only did I have to wait for some time for the server to even come out with the check, but I had to wait again for her to bring back my food. When I got home, I discovered they'd forgotten half my order! I called and the lady who answered asked If I wanted to come back and pick it up - well, duh. What else was I going to do? I paid with cash, there was no way for them to reimburse me. When I returned, I called  the curb-side number and the man (boy) who answered was very unhelpful - he told me to wait, he wasn't working the curb-side area. So, I waited, finally my food came out  - but aside from apologies - they didn't offer anything to make up for the inconvenience or for the fact that my food was now cold. Really unprofessional.  I like the food, but the service is pathetic."
erica b.,"San Diego, CA",2,59,68,2.0,9/2/2016,"The only reason im writing this is because something truly funny happened here today when my hubby and I were having lunch. My hubby ordered the endless soup and salad. He ordered Clam Chowder.  When the server(who was not our waitress by the way) bought out his soup.. He asked my husband did he need HOT SAUCE!!!  Uhm.. Who eats hot sauce in clam chowder??? Well I guess since Beyonce got ""hotsauce in her bag swag"" all BLACK PEOPLE eat hot sauce!! OMG!! All we could do was laugh.. Stereotype much??? So ridiculous.  The food was good the reason for the 2 stars. Hey BJ's... Train your servers that all black people dont eat HOT SAUCE!"
Maira M.,"Spring Valley, CA",9,25,16,4.0,1/27/2016,"Good location, happy hour could have better specials with a discount on craft beer. That would get me in here more often.  Great service with friendly servers."
Erin P.,"El Cajon, CA",141,60,98,4.0,8/23/2017,"Had great service last night and I want to give our waitress, Sabrina, props! I used the call-ahead-and-get-on-the-list option and was seated exactly at 6, with a text alert to boot. That was nice to have something go as planned. The rest of my week hasn't been that way at all! Once seated, one of our party was late and Sabrina came over and we told her we were trying to make a movie at 7:20, but our friend was late and should we order or wait for her? She recommended waiting and promised us she'd get us to our movie on time, looking at her watch. We put in our drink orders and she was right back. Our friend arrived and we ordered. I asked Sabrina what kind of grains were in the side for the Mediterranean chicken tacos and she told me and let me know they aren't considered very good. Yesssss! Thank you for giving me the honest scoop. I'm on a diet and don't want to waste calories on something that sucks and doesn't fill me up. We substituted black beans. The rest of the meal, Sabrina was extremely attentive, filling drinks, checking on our progress. Everyone was super happy with what they ordered. Nice to have good service and thanks, Sabrina, for your candor!"
Dena M.,"Rolando, San Diego, CA",0,7,3,5.0,8/21/2016,My Gentleman of a server Victor attended to all of our needs . He was calm throughout the rush that came in and kept a smile on along the way!  The new snickerdoodle pazookie was a long time coming ! Yay Delicious!  Thank you Victor  We will be back!  -us
Peter S.,"El Cajon, CA",4,6,,5.0,5/15/2017,"We went there for my sons 18th Birthday, food was great service was amazing. Bryce was our waiter, he was awesome!! We will definitely be going back."
Kilee P.,"El Cajon, CA",83,12,,5.0,5/11/2017,"I went on Sunday to BJ's with my family. This is one of my absolute favorite places to eat. We spent a good amount of money there as we always do, but i don't mind because i LOVE the food. Well on Monday night , i was craving the little garlic rolls, so my husband ordered me some prior to going to the movies, and i was definitely a happy pregnant woman eating them in route to the movies. Well on Tuesday, i tried to order some and after being on hold for 10 minutes, the lady said she couldn't sell me just the rolls. I didn't understand why because i had literally purchased them the night before and money wasn't the issue. Hell, i would have paid 10$ for a half dozen. That's over a dollar for each roll.  I am pregnant, and anyone who knows anything about pregnant cravings know when you want something, that's just what you want ! well yesterday, Wednesday, my husband called in and tried to order them again, because that's all that i want, and after crying on Tuesday because of the fact that this damn place denied to sell them to me, an employee by the name of ARIA J, was able to inform me, that they offered 4 rolls and marinara sauce for $4.95. I was very close to literally never ever eating here again, and i was going to do a horrible review because i am an emotional pregnant woman who was refused some rolls. lol But Aria made it better for me. Because of her, i will continue to eat here, and i will make sure next time i order rolls, they honor it for me.  Thank you Aria, for making sure that the customer is satisfied :D You really made me and my unborn child a happy camper yesterday. You are truly the best ! - Customer service at its finest"
Monique S.,"Santee, CA",61,2,,1.0,1/27/2017,I'm super disappointed with this BJs. My family and I went in for dessert and it was a huge disappointment. It took a while to be seated which was understandable because it was Friday night around 830 but when we were finally seated it took someone about twenty minutes to even acknowledge us. Long story short it took about and hour to get the Pazookies we ordered and they were burnt . BJs needs a better management team and a more attentive staff.
Drew k.,"San Diego, CA",0,41,3,1.0,2/2/2017,"Horrible service from the moment we arrived last night. Moderately crowded, we put our name in for a table. A small group of rude teens tried to cut in front of us, it was obvious they were friends of the host and hostess at the podium. They were then promptly given a table before we were despite arriving after we did. 30 min later we inquired why we weren't seated yet, the other hostess said she didn't see our names on the list. Really? So we had a drink at the bar, waitress gave a long rambling excuse why she didn't want to add our bar tab onto our dinner bill, basically because other waiters were too lazy to keep track of it. At least she was honest I guess. Whatever. We were eventually seated and a waiter took our order... nice older gentlemen with a cross around his neck, but that was the last we saw of him until he delivered our bill. And then he never came back to pick up the bill, so we just paid the exact amount in cash, no tip. The food itself took a very long time to arrive, the manager did come and apologize but offered nothing in the way of compensation. Apology was hollow. NEVER GOING BACK."
Victoria E.,"Lemon Grove, CA",0,1,,1.0,2/8/2017,"So, I actually normally love BJ's but last night, not so much. The service and food were great...until I found a hair in my brussel sprouts, unappetizing to say the least. I made a mention of it to the server when he dropped off the check, who didn't seem bothered by the fact that I had left half my meal untouched. He offered a ""sorry about that"" asked if I wanted a box (really?) and returned with my receipt. Don't know if I'll be back anytime soon."
Betsy M.,"Vail, AZ",71,456,525,4.0,2/21/2016,"I like BJ's.  It may be a chain but they always deliver on service and food no matter what location I visit.  We came here for a late lunch, so it was nice and empty/quiet.  We received great service from drinks to appetizers to our dessert. There were three of us so we decided to split some appetizers and the Hubs ordered a cobb salad which is no longer on the menu apparently but they were happy to make him one (nice service touch).  The Honey Sriracha Brussel Sprouts for so delicious, I could have eaten another order all by myself.  We also did the Avocado Egg Roles (good) and the Sliders (better than good) They also had this new cocktail -- Hendrick's Cucumber Lemonade, but being Vodka drinkers we asked they make it with Grey Goose.  It was really delicious and hard to not just gulp it down. For dessert we had to pass, given we stuffed ourselves on the above."
Joniene S.,"La Mesa, CA",340,161,194,4.0,12/31/2015,"We ate in the bar on Christmas Eve. We called ahead to put our name in. We were greeted but then we opted for the bar upon arrival.  Our server, a female with dark hair was attentive, polite, and personable. We had the okay calamari, served with ranch and a weak cocktail sauce. I might just be a sucker for spicy and flavor. A little tabasco helped.  I had the Jeramiad Red, or what ever it's called. I'm not sure what my friend had but he liked his. I was ready for bed after to JR's and a personal dish pizza. (All on happy hour, while the game (Chargers vs. Raiders) was on. The Chargers messed up long enough for us to end our meal with a Pazookie. (My earlier self would not admit to eating this), but over all it was a great price for a fun atmosphere. Who knew I would enjoy frequenting a place called BJ's? What's that mean anyhow?"
