Bethany O.,"Flagstaff, AZ",0,5,,5.0,10/16/2017,"Great food, quick service, and nice servers. I came on pizza Monday so I got half off so a great price too!"
Todd G.,"San Juan Capistrano, CA",0,18,6,1.0,8/18/2017,"Called three times to get setup for my daughters birthday. All three times we were told to ""just call ahead"" when we were on our way. We called ahead (40 minutes before arriving.) When we finally arrive with five 13 & 14 year olds -- they have no tables and tell us it will be at least an hour. This place could care less about customer service. The rely on location alone for business. STAY AWAY!!! Update: Below is the response from Alice F at BJs ""BJ's doesn't take reservations because the location is so small; the best we have is call-ahead, and even then, we can't hold tables for longer than 30 minutes.  Even that doesn't guarantee you a table, it just guarantees that you jump to the top of the waitlist.  The place isn't built for large parties, so it's pretty much luck of the draw with parties of over 7 members.  It's not our fault that you're stupid."""
Dino M.,"Santa Ana, CA",4,70,40,2.0,7/17/2017,"Based on two different experiences.  The first visit was last year during off season.  No wait and the food was decent. It's very small and can get very loud.  No bar.  Location, location location... Sit by the windows!  Second visit was last weekend with my hubby. We walked in, obviously during tourist season and during the weekend.  So there was a wait - ten minutes not bad at all. We were sat right by the to go bar in a tiny table. It was ok.  Not intimate and very loud. Our server was very dingy. He forgot our drinks, our salads sat ready for 10 mins and then he tried to give our dinner away. It's like we were in the movie 50 first dates.  Food was good, but not as great as BJ's usually is. The managers didn't seem helpful at all. Bus guys were awesome, otherwise our plates would have sat there in the half corner we are on. Females handling food, had their hair down and to the side :( it was so gross. Seems like the food handling procedures could use some serious over hauling!  2 stars for overall experience at both venues.  Never go during tourist season or weekends. Their staff can not handle quality food and service. It's both, not just half ass on both."
Semaj C.,"Corona, CA",1,3,1,1.0,12/3/2017,This experience was really horrible been waiting for 20 mins not once did anyone come and ask what we wanted to drink or eat. The restaurant was only half full and one of the employees is just walking by.   In order for me to get service I had to speak with the manager (Danny) just to get someone to take my order. When we did get our food we noticed a couple that just came in only waited 7 mins. I don't know if what I said helped or not. I don't think I will be coming back to the. BJ's they need better service and proactive employees
Hala L.,"San Francisco, CA",0,2,,4.0,12/30/2017,We came here because we were so hungry and looking for fried calamari; the fried calamari was fresh and tasted great!  We also ordered the shrimp and asparagus pasta which turned out be great!
A S.,"Irvine, CA",0,16,49,3.0,7/2/2017,Good Food  Excellent location  Services is  Just OK  . Server can not even smile . Not good for restaurant . Will look for different options next time where people are more happy:(
Katherine N.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",155,106,1,4.0,9/4/2017,Good pizza. Good service. Kids love the pizookie. [Wish they had a better wine list.]
Andrea C.,"Irvine, CA",154,147,47,2.0,2/6/2017,"Came here Saturday night with a couple of friends. The pazzokie didn't taste the same as it usually does at other locations. I was a little disappointed. The server was friendly. If you want to go to Bjs, go to one of the bigger ones. This one is too small and the food tastes different.  There was only ONE bathroom stall and I really had to go.. There was a weird smell in the restaurant as well.  If you're in Laguna Beach, you might as well eat somewhere else since thee are many restaurants in that same area!"
Kathryn Y.,"Marina, CA",98,101,407,4.0,3/13/2017,I have come to love this pizza place. The pizza is good and everything else. So many choices from burgers to salads. Excellent service and yummy beers on tap.
Will J.,"Orange County, CA",0,7,,3.0,11/9/2017,"Decent beer and artichoke dip, good prices during happy hour. Picked up a pizza to go, and it was definitely sub-par, especially for the price. I'd go back for the happy hour, though."
Alyssa M.,"Pico Rivera, CA",1,3,,2.0,8/13/2017,"Went on a Wednesday night and the wait wasn't too bad. The server was great at first but towards the end started ignoring our table (group of 6) and were practically the last ones left and had to ask someone else for our check. BUT that isn't the part that made this experience terrible. Food was good going down but 30 mins after I was done I had the worst stomach pain. And after 45 mins of what was the worst drive ever, I had food poisoning. And I know it wasn't anything else I had that day bc I hadn't eaten anything 3-4 hours prior. Also another friend of mine got sick. Never going back. Only gave it 2 stars bc of the other nice people who worked there. If you hate throwing up then beware"
Mario S.,"Santa Ana, CA",5,105,73,1.0,8/13/2017,This place does not come close to the BJs in Orange at the block that's my favorite restaurant this BJs in Laguna Beach sucks they only have pizza and a couple of other things in the menu it doesn't compare with the BJs in orange what a shame steps from the beach right in the art community this bjs suck I just can't believe how horrible its is service wise and the food taste like S%&#! If u happened to be in the area and get hungry keep going don't go in this place u gonna b disappointed especially if ur a bjs fan.
Hang L.,"San Diego, CA",53,210,536,1.0,7/16/2016,"Placed smelled like stagnant swamp water and I'm from Louisiana so I KNOW swamp water.  Couldn't eat, had to go. Peeee-yeeeew!!"
Nathan F.,Australia,217,344,2244,4.0,12/6/2016,"I'm choosing to give BJ pizza a solid four as they managed to feed a hungry crowd of South Africans and Australia'a for a reasonable dollar. The six of us rocked in and we were walnut welcomed and introduced to menu and drinks as I'd expect in this part of the world, our waiter did well with everyone's accent and sense oh humour and we were advised not to over order, or under order and we got just the right amount. The house beer was fine if not remarkable, the wine list basic but decent choices were available; we certainly had a good time."
Sara M.,"Seattle, WA",29,304,54,2.0,7/14/2016,"I've been to a handful of BJ's locations in various states but this was my first time here. The service was great and so was the calamari but our salads were very disappointing! We ordered the Santa Fe salad which was completely tasteless and lacked any ""Cajun"" seasoning whatsoever. Never saw any fire‑roasted red peppers either. We came because I had a BOGO lunch deal which was going to expire but we won't return."
Michael G.,"Mission Viejo, CA",97,7,1,2.0,7/15/2017,"Avoid. The wait to get in is insane. They totally discriminate in so many different ways. The servers are slow as molasses. Food is good, but you should definitely drive to the next nearest one. It will be faster and better service. Oh and the beers taste very watered down. If you don't believe me, then try for yourself. There is a reason it only has 3 stars !"
Andrew W.,"Temecula, CA",8,32,,1.0,12/13/2016,"They close at 1030 Monday- Thursday. I showed up at 10 at night on Tuesday Dec 3rd for a pazooki and we couldn't get served because they ""closed early"" today."
Jessica A.,"Redlands, CA",0,7,5,2.0,2/24/2017,"My family went to BJ's this last week and enjoyed the food and atmosphere being right in Laguna. However we were so shocked and disgusted at the lack of sanitary codes here. One of the customers had a dog sitting in a highchair at the table with them. The dog was pushed up close to the table and was able to put his head on the table while the customers were eating. Multiple waitresses and waiters (including our waitress) would stop to pet the dog as they walked by and then would continue serving people. I watched our waitress pet the dog and then walk over and grab our salad and bring it over to our table. I was grossed out. When they left the highchair was not wiped down, but placed to the side for someone else to use.  We ordered a pizza and my sisters got hamburgers. They are gluten free and we were very impressed with the gluten free menu and breakdown of what many dishes contain for ingredients. The pizza was good and my sisters loved the hamburgers."
Ilya K.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,2,2,1.0,7/31/2017,"At the entrance we met a disgruntled girl, the waiter brought the bill when we did not even ask for it despite the fact that the dirty dishes are still on our table, but the food was delicious, thank you!"
Kiet K.,"Gilbert, AZ",2,2,1,5.0,7/6/2017,"This is by far the best BJ restaurant we had frequent.  We always patronize this one, great service and food for a decent price in Laguna Beach!  Special thanks to Mgr. Joseph and server Marina for going the extra mile to make us another plate of salad after we mentioned the portion of portabella mushroom in my salad was a little small.  Exceptional service and for sure we will return.  Been here 4x in 2 weeks already!"
Jason W.,"Las Vegas, NV",3,40,52,4.0,7/12/2015,"***THIS REVIEW REVIEW'S TWO DIFFERENT NIGHTS!! PLEASE READ ALL OF IT*** Ok, so, we have found, that anything less than 3 dollar signs, in Laguna Beach, pretty much closes down at 9pm. For us, being from Vegas, that's a bid deal. It was a Wednesday night, we had just got done watching the sunset on the beach, and were by now (8:30pm), were quite hungry. Our hotel was on the South end of Laguna and we were hoping to find a place within walking distance. We had Ruby's a little further South, but, meh'.  We got on Yelp* and saw that Wine Gallery was still open. Off we go....to the door. We open the door and it's pouring outside! All of a sudden, it looks like Domino's.  We decide to wait for a little bit to see if the rain lets up and in about 20 minutes it does. Off we go. We get to Wine Gallery at about 9:25. Unfortunately, their kitchen had closed at 9:00. Bummer.  Back to Yelp*.  There is a couple of places close to Wine Cellar, but again, 3 dollar signs. All of a sudden my wife says she saw a BJ's when we came into town. So we look up BJ's, they are open til like 11:30. Disco!! Onto the trolley we jump and off to BJ's we go! By the time we got done looking online for a place to eat, waiting for the trolley, and getting there, we got there at about 10:15ish. We were seated immediately, ad were given a choice of seating. We took a seat by the front window. We like to people watch and don't mind people looking at us eating.  Our server was Jeff. Jeff was, well, freaking awesome! What a great guy. Was very friendly and helpful, wasn't afraid to engage us, and was on top of our order top to bottom! BJ's would have gotten a 3 star (right on par for a franchise eatery), but Jeff alone was worth giving them 4! My wife ordered a create-your-own personal sized deep dish and was very happy with it. I had The Italian Market thin crust pizza. Mine was great! I love pepperoncini's and this was a really great pizza.  For drinks she had a glass of wine and I had the HopStorm IPD. Loved the IPA. I am a traditional IPA guy and really like this one.  Now, fast forward to Thursday night (the next night). We really wanted to watch the sunset on the beach again, but now knew that dinner was going to have to be really early, or we were going to be stuck again. Well, fortunately, we now know that BJ's was open late, so we were in business! Thursday, was 7/2, the day before a 3 day weekend beginning for the 4th of July. We knew that the ""strip"" was going to be WAY busier that it was the night before, so we were ready for it. Many of the reviews on BJ's have griped that they are slow and can't handle the business. That didn't thwart our plans though, like I said, we knew it was going to be crazy and we were ready for it. If BJ's has anything going against it, it's that it is small on the inside. I'd guesstimate they have a seating capacity of about 60. Add that, the fact they are right across from Main Beach, that they are a well known and popular franchise, and that they ""less expensive"" from other options in a tourist locale, and they're screwed when it gets busy.  People who have been on the beach all day, are baked from the sun, dehydrated from drinking alcohol all day on the beach (yeah, yeah, I know, it's illegal to drink on the beach. It's illegal to go 55 in a 45 mph zone, but does that stop anybody from doing it? be real people), and are starving, all seem to gravitate towards the restaurants at the same time. And these people, are usually the ones who have zero patience at this point, and love to take it out on the people who are there to provide a service to them. I think that that is where most of the negative reviews come from on BJ's. If people tried to have a little compassion and patience, life might slow down a little for them, and they could take some time to relax and enjoy their surroundings. Such behavior was needed this night.  As the trolley got closer to Main Beach, the sidewalks got PACKED. The restaurants all looked to have 40 minute waits on them.  We got up to BJ's and knew we'd be waiting for at least 40 minutes. We told the greeter that'd we'd like a 2 person table by the window again, preferably one of the 3 that are stand alone, and that we'd be willing to wait for it.  While we were waiting, we overheard, the manager talking with the greeter, (we were being nosy) and they had gotten slammed earlier, which backed them up to the point there were at now, they had had someone walk off the job just a couple of hours ago, and had had someone call out sick for the mid/closing shift. Basically, the bottom had fallen out for them on the busiest shifts on the eve of a major holiday weekend. With that being said, did our service suffer? Was it slower than the night before? Yes. But was our server any less friendly, even tho he was slammed and a little flustered? No. He even recognized us from the night before (it wasn't Jeff, as he had worked an earlier shift) as he was the grett"
Richard H.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",0,5,,3.0,10/8/2017,"Great food, but may be the loudest restaurant ever (maybe only Chuck E. Cheese's is louder). Not sure if it's the floor type or the cool ship-like shape of the ceiling, but avoid if you're looking for comfortable conversation, or go when it's not too busy."
Amy C.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",43,22,90,5.0,6/4/2016,"This place has been consistently awesome since I started coming here as a teenager. Same level of crowded, same level of noisy and always great tasting food and drinks. Something on the menu for everyone in your group :-)"
Paul H.,"Las Vegas, NV",329,548,656,3.0,7/24/2016,"This is a location at the beach! Food and service were great. Waitlisted and was greeted by name by the host. Great service brought up the rating.  That being said they really need to focus on cleanliness. Every mirror and picture on the wall was dirty. If they were near a table they had kids hand prints on them. The overall cleanliness was very poor - build up along floor edges, under tables, bathrooms dirty. I get that it's busy and near the beach - but take some pride and control the things that can be controlled like overall cleanliness."
Erik L.,"Coeur d'Alene, ID",101,9,,5.0,6/25/2017,"I ran restaurants for most my career life and have never experienced such great service as I did o. Saturday June 24th, 2017! Food was great but service by Dana was what truly made it great!"
Dave P.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",12,30,3,5.0,3/21/2017,"Recently ate here. Tasty food, super polite staff. Marina was my server. She went the extra mile. Thanks BJ's !"
Ilaha H.,"Orange, CA",2,2,,5.0,6/2/2017,"Cozy place with excellent location and friendly stuff. If you are there try Chicken Bacon Ranch, this was the best pizza of my last years. Beer is also good there"
Lori B.,"Mission Viejo, CA",90,15,11,4.0,4/7/2016,"Had lunch with a friend here today. This is the second time I have been to this location.  I had the new Honey Sriracha Brussels Sprouts  to start. Wast of money! They were very bitter and overcooked. As for the honey Sriracha sauce couldn't taste it becauae of the bitterness of the sprouts.  For lunch had the Avacado, bacon, tomato sandwich. It was ver tasty I really do recommend it.  For dessert was the new Monkey Bread Pizookie. Did not disappoint must try. Service was very friendly and mostly on point.  However the hostess hung out more in the back talking to the men on the staff and not really working the door. All in all good luch I would recommend this location, but be warned it is a very small store and you are very close with other customers."
Yasaman J.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",4610,317,1580,4.0,10/7/2014,"I have never been a fan of big chain restaurants thus BJ's was no exception or that is what I thought!!! My family and I decided to go walk around Laguna Beach on Sunday early evening. We had eaten a very light lunch that day so we decided to have dinner. As we were walking and talking about our options, we decided to go to BJ's. My husband had never been to the restaurant and he is a big fan of pizza so we decided to give it a try. It was around 7 o'clock and we thought that there would be at least 15 mins wait but to our surprise as we walked up to the hostess, she informed us that they have a table ready for us....SWEET!!! I have to admit that the restaurant was busy and it was loud but it is a restaurant and a brewhouse after all. Right? My dad and husband decided to order beers and we started figuring out what pizza we want to order. After couple of minutes of discussion we decided to order a Large (18 inch, 10 slices) Pizza half mediterranean and half Bj's Special. The Mediterranean half had fetta cheese, olives, chicken, sun dried tomatoes and cheese of course. The Bj's Special had pepperoni, sausage, bell peppers, tomatoes and cheese.  When the Pizza came out everything looked sooooo yummy and it was. The pizza was just cooked right and it tasted fresh. At the end of our meal, we ordered the Cookie n cream Pizzooki which was just delicious. Our waiter was so nice and helpful as well.  We had a great experience at this restaurant. Will I ever come back to this location? YEs Ofcourse.  *** The reason that I deducted one star was because the pizza dough tasted a bit salty to me. I am very sensitive about salty food so I am not sure if it was just me or their dough is too salty. I noticed it more on the Mediterranean pizza more since it had fetta cheese on it as well..."
Michael R.,"Rancho Mirage, CA",53,85,35,4.0,7/11/2016,"Nice place for a lunch, they have their own brews also, had the Amber. Had chicken Pitas. So it is right across from the beach, can't beat that. They also have a real cool rewards program."
E B.,"Dana Point, CA",0,6,,5.0,7/26/2017,"Popped in for a quick snack with one of our granddaughters who's 10 and we loved it. Joshua was quick, courteous and attentive. The food was served and displayed well. Better yet it was good beyond  our expectations of a chain restaurant, ESPECIALLY considering the touristy local. Don't ignore this place because of preconceived notions of a chain. Good stuff. Hi"
Dan W.,"Anaheim, CA",145,494,505,5.0,6/1/2016,Went in for a late snack while walking around town. The service was good and the snacks were great!! This is a great place to stop in for a late meal or snack. We did not have to wait for 2 people. I am not sure how long the wait would be for 4 people. If you need a snack go to this location!!
God I.,"Riverside, CA",0,5,,5.0,7/30/2017,"Amazing service from a very very very awesome manager. I went for a dinner with my wife and sister-in-laws on Sunday July 30, 2017. The manager greeted us on the door and seated us. His great smile made us feel so welcomed. My wife was not happy with her seat because it was a corner seat, without mentioning it, he came a offered to move the table (amazing guy). He really made our day. Thank you BJS for highering great people!!!"
Hutch H.,"San Clemente, CA",145,170,293,4.0,6/17/2015,"This review is strictly for a late night ""Pizookie"" visit. You can't beat the location right on PCH in the heart of Laguna Beach. Inside is a little cozy, but we got right in around 9pm. Service was quick at facilitating an insatiable craving for PIZOOKIE. If you haven't tried this, you must! If you need to skip a meal tomorrow or send your fit-bit ticking off the charts, so be it.  Your cookie base can have two flavors, so we split the baby with traditional chocolate chip (they have gluten free also) and the salted caramel cookie. It's topped with vanilla ice cream, some caramel drizzle and other little chocolate pod-like sprinkles. It's divine and diabolical at the same time. Pizookie, a glass of wine for the Mrs, and some 2‰ milk for me was just under $15 before tip. Wow.  It's been so long since I've tried the pizza, but desert will bring me back, even if I ate dinner somewhere else like I did the night of this indulgence."
Abubaker D.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,6,,5.0,6/25/2017,Food is so fresh here. The leaves in the Kale and Brussles salad felt like they were just picked from the farm. And their deep dish Pizza tasted super fresh from the oven.
Alondra J.,"San Diego, CA",73,37,102,1.0,6/8/2015,"Worst service ever! I didn't think a BJ's restaurant could be so bad, but this one proved me wrong! Although they were really slow it took forever to get our food, which was mediocre at best. One thing I found odd and especially annoying was that the waiter never gave us any napkins, took forever to return and when we asked he gives us 2 tiny bar napkins. Like really? You don't have normal napkins??   Then the people at the table next to us happened to spill a side of ranch which made a very loud noise everyone could hear. It splattered all over the walls, booth and floor and was a huge mess. Yet every server and person working refused to acknowledge it or Ever clean it up. It sat there a good 30 min or more before we left and it was still sitting there. If you're in the area I definitely Would Not recommend this BJ's. In fact, I'd recommend every other place nearby over it."
AL B.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,18,,1.0,11/17/2016,"I didn't have a huge amount of time for lunch so I stopped into BJ's for a bowl of soup. Soup is fast. It's already made. After waiting 20 min. for the bowl of soup I called the waiter over and asked what the problem was. He told me the soup was coming right away. Five minutes later - no soup - I walked out. It was around 12:30 on a Thursday, prime lunch time, but BJ's was almost empty. Now I know why. They set the Gold Standard for bumbling incompetence."
Cole B.,"Newport Beach, CA",0,16,,2.0,7/5/2017,...gone down hill...used to be somewhat unique...pizza quality has fallen off...why go unless you're a tourist who doesn't know better
Neil M.,"Lake Worth, FL",0,14,3,3.0,10/26/2016,"So, like most of the BJs the food is good and consistent.  The issue I had with this location is that the service was a bit slow - not a big issue, but at 9:30 at night there were SCREAMING CHILDREN! Not just for a few minutes, but the whole time I was there Nothing was done, and it dramatically degraded the experience to a point that I considered a 1 or 0 star rating. I love BJs, but I will not come back to this location."
Jenny L.,"Philadelphia, PA",357,107,191,2.0,12/25/2014,"I just want to begin by saying the food is just as any other BJ's but the service and parking/traffic is just terrible.  This BJ's is located in the heart of laguna beach, off laguna avenue. The roads get packed and they're really narrow. Parking is a hassle and costs money. I parked in a lot that cost $2 an hour.  On to the restaurant itself. As stated earlier the food is same as any other BJ's. I got the chicken wings (spicy buffalo) and BJ's favorite small pizza. The chicken wings were not spicy at all. But this was enough for a light lunch for two. We also ended with a mini macadamia pizookie.  The service is what gives this place 2 stars. It was a Friday afternoon, and the restaurant was half full yet our server was slow and a mess. First off we were seated at a table with a big liquid puddle on the table. Which was not wiped off. He put in an order for calamari after we specified chicken wings. He never cleared our small table after we were done with the chicken wings. He took forever to bring pro of even those could see it sitting at the kitchen ledge where they pick up food to bring to the tables. He apologized for his lack of good service because ""they were really busy."" The restaurant  was half full."
