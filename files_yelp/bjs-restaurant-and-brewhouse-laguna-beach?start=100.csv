Sara B.,"Wheaton, IL",12,1658,13,3.0,8/5/2011,"There menu is HUGE. Too big in my mind. There is so many options you get lost in sitting down. Good home brewed beers. Enjoyed a slice or two of a portobello and fontina cheese pizza. Don't let your eyes speak for your stomach. The slices are HUGE! The servers seem a bit over-busy. They forgot a couple things we asked for...simple things, like water... Good view of the water...but I don't know if I would go back."
Mary L.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,12,4,1.0,3/22/2015,"Im a huge bjs fan and this location is just awful, food was not as great as other locations also the waiter was polite but very bad cigarets smell. Left our food on the table as is. :("
Sean S.,"Anaheim, CA",0,4,1,4.0,3/20/2015,I was put off by the reviews about the service being terrible but honestly the service is not bad at all. The atmosphere here is wonderful and the food was just as good as any BJs. Overall if you want a nice little meal with a view of the sea then this place is worth it.
GG M.,"Los Angeles, CA",83,684,140,2.0,8/23/2013,"Very small tiny ass place, just like everything in this city Only place on a friday night without a 1 hr wait, shoulve gone hungry for the night. Pizza=very thick crust, literally scraped off 1/8 inch of toppings and cheese off, and ate the crust areas, the middle is doughy nastee poo-poo. Terrible pizza overall. Only thing I liked were the tomatoes. Barely any sauce, not baked well, all I taste is dough. Not cooked deep dish proper, which should be golden schmolden all the way through. Wow this was so bad. Clam chowder=tastes ok, but extremely thick and salty. Chicken wings=really the only item this place consistently serves that tastes ok. Strawberry lemonade=pucker up loverboy, more sugar than a def leppard concert.  $45, good night.....good grief."
Holley L.,"Richmond, VA",122,142,134,4.0,9/20/2013,"I finally went here for lunch today with my mom and my grandma after years and years of driving by it. This is by far the smallest BJ's I have ever been to. It's located in the heart of downtown laguna beach, absolute prime location. Our server was named Morgan and he was a good server . Food-wise I usually order their delicious pizza but decided to branch out so I ordered the boneless teriyaki wings and they were good, not the best. I wouldn't say they were spicy per se, but they definitely had a kick to them. I'm a wuss but let's just say if I didn't have my sprite to drink my eyes would have been watering up and my nose running, but I'll say it again...i'm a wuss. I think if or when I go back I will go back to my normal pizza order because that's what they're known for. My grandma ordered the quesadilla and it was presented well on the plate, not to mention she said it was pretty tasty. My mom ordered the crusted chicken sandwich and it wasn't what she thought, she said it was alright but probably wouldn't order it again. Overall it was a good experience and I would probably go back. I hear it's insanely crowded at night and I believe it, the place is TINY for that amount of traffic! I also like the way the interior is set up, although it's small it gives off the impression that it is bigger than it is. 4 Stars: Yay! I'm a fan."
Crysta L.,"Laguna Beach, CA",1,16,7,5.0,3/18/2015,"My boyfriend and I are locals and this is the restaurant we visit the most. The waiters are always attentive, so good service! The food is great and comes out quick and the beer sampler is very fun! Also, it's more affordable than most downtown restaurants. Oh and the the salted caramel Pizookie is the best thing, ever! Definitely recommend!"
Charles M.,"Monrovia, CA",0,24,1,4.0,4/19/2015,Good pizza next to the beach. Great beer.  Next time I'm in Laguna I'll eat here again. Good service from our waiter.
Ryan M.,"San Jose, CA",253,26,2,2.0,12/31/2013,"My wife and I decided to go to BJ's in Laguna Beach this week and we have had decent experiences with BJ's in the past (different locations).  Our experience wasn't the greatest at the Laguna Beach location.  I didn't get the name of our server but she had dyed deep red hair simply didn't pay attention to us.  She brought us our drinks and would go back to the kitchen and laugh her ass off with her friends.  When the food arrive, she refilled the drinks but never took the glasses away.  That said, we had a total of 5 glasses on the table built for 2 with a pizza and 2 plates for the Pizza.  During the dinner, she never stopped by to check to see if we had everything we needed or refill any beverages but I sure could see her bright red hair laughing it up with her pals in the kitchen. We needed a few slices boxed up and she handed my wife a box and walked away....still leaving the five empty glasses on the table, the plates etc.   When the bill came, she was very quick and attentive.  She brought it back fast and then finally cleared the table for the next guest.  Of all of my experiences at BJ's, this one just sucked."
Charlie H.,"Laguna Beach, CA",14,139,88,4.0,3/16/2013,"What a difference a server makes. Really enjoyed the experience tonight. Had the California burger, soooooo yummy."
Shaun B.,"South Jordan, UT",10,2,,1.0,6/21/2014,"Worst service I have ever experienced! The server screwed up everyone's order and blamed it on all of us. Save yourself the time and anguish, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!"
L N.,"Laguna Beach, CA",0,11,,5.0,5/9/2013,"I've read so many negative reviews, but was is the area shopping and thought I would drop in. I can tell you, the location is fantastic, directly across from main beach, I was there at sunset and it was gorgeous. I just had a salad. The place was packed. The staff very curtious, even though they really busy, but the beer was too awesome to give this place a poor rating. Try it for yourself."
Wildbull Z.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,62,17,3.0,8/23/2015,This place is kind of small.  Homeless people pan handling on the street outside.  They seated us fairly quickly but we sat about 5-10 minutes before we were acknowledged.  There was a shift change and once we met our waiter he was very good.  They only serve beer and wine.  The blonde beer I had was good as was the pizza.  Everything was ok but not great as I expected.  It hit the spot but nothing above average about it.  It's right across the street from Main Beach.
Sara R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,,1.0,7/23/2014,"I will never get back for sure! The service was one of the slowest ever experienced. We waited more than one and a half hour for the food (a very long time considering the kind of place & food and the late time). The place was freezing and even though we repetitively asked for the AC to be turned down, they always ignored our requests. Furthermore the payment was a nightmare: they mixed all the credit cards and tried to make us pay more than actually needed.  Food wasn't great, service even worse."
Vivian W.,"Irvine, CA",149,11,2,1.0,7/2/2012,"Let me just say that this place is exceptional... Exceptionally bad. I almost never have a negative experience at a restaurant but this was just terribad. I came here after going to Laguna Beach with my twin and we were starving. 20 minutes after we ordered, the new waitress who served us apologized and said there was a holdup in the kitchen, and then proceeded to make senseless small talk but it was just awkward. It made us feel uncomfortable. That's excusable, and she's new, but it took more than FORTY minutes for our food to arrive. We would have liked to receive a free appetizer or something, but she made no such offer. Still, we were in a good mood so we would've been okay, if it weren't for what happened next. My fries were cold and stale so when she asked me how my food was I told her nicely. She said she would try to get me another hot plate of fries, and I was like okay cool. Then right after, when we barely even dived into our food after waiting for so long, she put the check down next to us and said ""take your time"" without even mentioning the fries. Really? Are you trying to be bad at this? Ten minutes later we asked her about it and she just went ""I know. There's a hold up in the kitchen."" and sort of set the water down hard. Are you effing kidding me?! Oh helllll no. Our entire experience & mood was ruined by the slower-than-a-snail speed & bad service. Before we were even finished with our food she tried to take our plates from us without even offering a to-go box. At least when my fries finally arrived she offered us a free pizookie for our trouble, that made it a bit better. We tipped her two dollars, to show her we were irritated but not cheap. Still, never coming here again. I expected better from a nice American place, especially next to the beach. Before dinner we were debating between Johnny Rockets down the street and BJ's. Should have chosen JR's... would've gotten home at least 45 minutes earlier too."
Lisa V.,"Glen Rock, NJ",11,73,9,1.0,8/19/2014,"The calamari was good, the beer was good, the wings were good. The service and the pizza were AWFUL.  Not to mention the bizarre crowd this place attracts. Don't do it. Laguna has SO many better places to offer."
Ruth R.,"Redondo Beach, CA",3,12,,1.0,7/5/2014,"This was my first time visiting a BJ's Restaurant and based on the experience, I have no desire to visit again. I ordered the California Burger which comes topped with avocado, roasted green chilies, pepper jack cheese and chipotle mayonnaise.  This ended up being one of the blandest burgers I have had in a long time.  The patty was unseasoned, the chilies flavorless and the mayonnaise watery without any chipotle flavor at all.  The bread was soggy when the plate arrived.  That says a lot of how long my order was waiting in the window.  The fries were soggy and unseasoned too.  The hardest part was paying more than $10 for this. My husband ordered the jambalaya.  His plate was just fine.  The shrimp, chicken and sausage were well seasoned but the vegetables were not fresh.  For this dish, a stew was prepared and served over white rice (instead of cooking everything as an integral dish).  This is not food I will want to have again (or pay about $17 for it). The ladies' restroom was completely disgusting.  I do not want to go into detail of what I saw but the lady who was going to use the facilities after me left with her two young daughters after seeing the conditions.  I hear her complaining to the employees about what she saw (with reason!).  Now, I may be able to tolerate bad food but not dirty places.  After reading other reviews about this particular restaurant, I believe they have some hygiene problems."
Odette K.,"Orange County, CA",78,62,20,2.0,7/29/2014,"Service was s-l-o-w though food was alright. But our server could hardly ever be found, and we had to hurryupandrequestrefillsornapkins before he scurried away again. Don't think I'll be going back, no matter how delish that chocolate chip pizookie was :/"
Christine H.,"Pasadena, CA",252,773,409,4.0,9/14/2012,"So check out photo number 13, that's the right BJ's. It's funny how the corporation inserted 12 of the same photos on ALL locations. It's a bit misleading until number 13. I'm not really sure about the history of ownership about this place. I remember as a kid they did serve chicago style pizza here but it wasn't called BJ's nor did BJ's exist then so I'm guessing they bought it up. Regardless, it's still pretty good pizza even if it is chain. It is small and there's always a wait but just because it's by the beach, it's worth it dammit. Just come in for lunch so you get served for dinner lol."
Emily M.,"Wylie, TX",0,24,27,3.0,6/7/2015,"Ehh it's alright. Honestly, I'm a pretty big fan of BJ'S Restaurants and this location really isn't that bad - it's just not great either. It's a really small location which makes it REALLY loud whenever you come here. The service can tend to be pretty slow, which I don't fully understand because it is a small location so there aren't that many tables to cover. The food is pretty decent, but like I said, service is hit and miss. There is one server who is awesome though so I do feel like he deserves a shout out. His name is Ish and he is awesome. He takes care of you and he is one of the servers that is pretty quick and covers everything. Not to mention he is super friendly! So if you can somehow get him as your server, you'll probably have a 4 star experience :) Overall, this is a good place to come if you want good pizza and aren't looking for anything with a great atmosphere. Otherwise, it's alright."
Lucy G.,"Irvine, CA",17,8,3,4.0,1/18/2015,Good food and service over Martin Luther King weekend around 1pm however in the summer do not go unless you wish long waits over the top errors and poor service In the summer it just gets insane here and you are better off with take out
