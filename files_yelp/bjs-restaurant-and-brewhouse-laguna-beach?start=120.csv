H Q.,"Placentia, CA",153,715,1751,4.0,8/31/2012,"I came here because I was with friends and they had to go somewhere that was kid-friendly. We took forever to order and I'm sure it was frustrating for the waiter. We did end up ordering a crap load of food. More than we needed, which was okay because I got to take home the leftovers.  No complaints about the food. I love their calamari and certain specialty pizzas. The restaurant is smaller than most BJ's and more cramped.  Parking.... well, it is Laguna Beach in the Summer. I'm glad I don't have kids because they waste so much food and make huge messes. I hope a big tip was left since I didn't pay."
Marilynn L.,"Los Angeles, CA",126,1229,132,4.0,6/19/2012,"This BJ's is the best location 've been to (out of Boulder, CO, Tempe, AZ , and the one in Los Angeles). Maybe it's the location and the Laguna air but I also swear that of the 6x we've gone, the hostess is always sweet and the service is very friendly. Love their deep dish pizzas with perfectly crisp dough on the outside and fluffy, buttermilky flavor on the inside. Buffalo and barbecue are my favorite flavors. It's lots of flavor without being overkill (barely). Great quality for a chain."
Gita A.,"San Diego, CA",1,15,,1.0,3/16/2014,"Complained to manager Brian about lack of hygienic service (servers dropping forks on the floor and dragging across to kitchen with foot) and he said he would send me a g.c. to apologize but never did, also complained to head office and never heard back.  Poor service in restaurant reflected by poor management that doesn't care about customers once they get their money. Like their namesake BJ's blows but not in a cool sexy way."
John M.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",0,5,,1.0,1/14/2015,"I normally like BJ'S but this particular location really gives the franchise a bad name. Austin our waiter didn't actually identify himself as our waiter for at least 25 minutes. He was too busy flirting with some teenage girls sitting across from us. When he finally introduced himself, he seemed really clueless. In fact, while he was charming the young ladies, another employee who was not a waiter, came over to our table and did his best to take our order right before Austin finally showed up. The food was fine, but the service was far from adequate. The restaurant just wasn't that busy for a Saturday night and there was way too many employees not interfacing with their customers. Eventually, Austin found a few other women to converse with. I felt like a teenager at Al's Dinner from the ""Happy Days."" But instead of feeling elated from the 50's ambiance, I found myself angered by the aloof service. I wasn't looking to hang out at BJs three or four hours to socialize with my high school buddies. Just wanted to eat and be on my way as one would expect from a place that's serving pizza. Not sure how this location continues to function, but someone from the BJ's franchise might want to take a gander at what the hell is going on at this restaurant. I really wish I would have looked at the Yelp reviews first as I would have never given the restaurant my business."
Matilde S.,"Bologna, Italy",2,4,,3.0,9/21/2014,"The place is very convenient since it is open later than any other restaurant in Laguna Beach. I ordered a salad with brussels sprouts, nuts, kale and raisins, which was really special. My friend ordered a tuna dish which she enjoyed. Beers were also very good, a selection of IPAs and more, not the usual tasteless beers you may expect to find in a franchise like this."
Doug S.,"Long Beach, CA",4,20,3,4.0,7/26/2014,"Surprised by so many bad reviews. Wife and I went here before going to the art show down the street and had a great dinner. I had the Brewhouse burger with shoestring fries and she had the Kale salad. My burger was excellent, and the Kale salad was really good too. Fast service, good food, good prices and great location...what more could you want?"
Stephanie W.,"Tustin, CA",0,1,,2.0,7/2/2012,"Never coming back here again!!! After spending an enjoyable day at the beach, my friend and I were starving and decided to grab a quick dinner at BJ's. The restaurant wasn't too packed and we waited about 5 minutes to be seated. The waitress we had seemed a bit awkward or a bit uncomfortable/unhappy to serve us but that was excusable since she was new.  My friend ordered their Jalapeno burger with fries and I ordered a Scampi pasta. After 20 minutes, the waitress told us that the kitchen was backed up and that our food should be arriving soon. It seemed a little odd since the restaurant wasn't full but  we were in a happy mood so we didn't really mind. Another 15 minutes passed by and  I politely asked one of workers about our food. The worker seemed really surprised and asked for our waitress.  We finally received the food after a few minutes and my friend's dish came out stale and luke warm.  Really?! We waited over 40 minutes for luke warm food? We informed the waitress about the meal and she said she would replace it for us. She then gave us the check without mentioning anything about replacing my friend's food. Again, really?! We haven't even eaten yet and you're already giving us the check!?  I couldn't really enjoy my pasta since I felt really irritated by the wait and the service. By the time I was half way finished I asked her if we were still getting the food replaced and she said it was backed up and sort of slammed my glass of water on the table. I'm usually a really laid back person but that PISSED me off!  We finally got the food but decided to take most of it to go since we spent way too much time waiting around!  I think she got in trouble or something because she came back and offered us a free pazookie when we were ready to leave. It didn't really matter considering we were already pissed and the restaurant was practically empty.  I'm usually all about the food but when the service is crappy it just kills the whole dining experience. Long story short: We came in really happy and left really angry. Way to ruin our trip to Laguna Beach!"
Susan L.,"Dana Point, CA",382,25,15,3.0,6/2/2014,"Went on Sunday night and it was pretty busy but did get seated right away. When we sat on the bench seat we all sank down and were looking up at the folks sitting on chairs across the table from us. Had to ask for kids menu several times, had to ask for silverware after food arrived.  Pizza was good, sliders were ok. Overall just ok."
F B.,"Banning, CA",1,30,,4.0,8/25/2014,I visit this place several times a year and never dissapointed. The place is small but cozy. The staff has always been polite and professional. This place can get quite busy on weekends and holidays so that's something to consider if you stop for lunch. Food is always very good and not overpriced. It can get noisy when busy so I recommend visiting on a weekday. Will definitely be back.
Shaela F.,"Broken Arrow, OK",8,17,23,3.0,8/13/2014,"It was very cramped and small, but it is Laguna so I understand, very very loud drunk people filled the place, I used to work for ABLE commission so I know when over serving is over serving, our waitress was very cold, not rude but obviously had drinking tables she would rather wait on...the food was ok, appetizers were typical heated up microwave style, burger was fresh and good, the soup bowl I had was AHHHMAZING tho...it's definitely not my favorite place in Laguna, and I probably won't go back...but there are restaurants in Laguna that can compete with the best in the world so BJ's doesn't really have a chance next to 5-star restaurants, but it's a great place to go to drink and eat casually..."
Emily L.,"Los Angeles, CA",12,18,4,3.0,8/25/2012,"I went in for a late lunch last week and got a $20 special where they gave me 2 small salads, a medium specialty pizza, and a pizzookie. Great deal!!!  The food was delicious as always. I got a caesar salad and the chicken bbq pizza. Both great. The only reason I'm not giving 4 or 5 stars is because our service wasn't as good as the food. I felt like I had to track my server down to get my water refilled. Overall it was a good experience, and I will be back."
Tiffany L.,"Los Angeles, CA",670,221,1576,3.0,1/31/2010,"I cam here at around 4 o'clock in the afternoon on a Sunday, and the place was only half-filled with people. Derek J was my waiter for the evening. He brought out the food very quickly and always made sure that we had everything that we needed. Awesome waiter, overall. Today, I ordered Bj's buffalo wings, Italian Market Salad, and a small Spinach and Artichoke Pizza. The buffalo wings were really delish; the skin was perfectly crispy and the hot sauce had a nice zesty flavor. The salad was also very tasty. I liked the combinational of mozzarella, chick peas, tomatoes, olives, and lettuce. To me, their pizza was not that good. I thought that that the there was way too much dough. In each bite, all I could taste was dough. I don't know, maybe I am just more of a thin crust fan."
Keith B.,"Lakehurst, NJ",3,131,6,4.0,4/9/2014,I had the black and blue burger which was delicious.  My love had the California chicken sandwich which she loved.  The Irish red beer was good.  Service was not the greatest.  Good prices for being at the beach.
Ali S.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",1,6,3,5.0,8/24/2014,Very delicious deep dish pizza. The buffalo chicken pizza is awesome. Affordable and great for the price.
Anthony A.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",779,1013,99,2.0,7/9/2009,"I don't know why this BJ's refuses to stop sucking so much. Every single time I've gone there the service has been total crap. Either my server forgets things I've ordered (because, you know, they're so smart they don't have to write my order down) or they disappear forever, only to have someone else equally inept take their place. At least the food is good, but when everything leading up to the meal has been disastrous, does it really matter anymore? The food is pretty good, but they have a menu that's half the size of most locations. I don't know why. Is it because this location is smaller than the others or something? It's irritating. And don't even bother going down here during the summer. The place needs a tourist enema to get all of the non-locals out so I can grab a bite to eat. My friend's wife just got a job here, so I might return to this location sometime. Although, at this point, I'd rather just go in and get a pitcher and do some people-watching than sit down for a full-on meal."
Kathy W.,"Market East, Philadelphia, PA",0,3,,5.0,7/23/2014,Gluten free cookie dessert is a must ! It was so good I thought the waiter made a mistake and brought me non GF. Delicious!
Justin K.,"Carlsbad, CA",2,46,2,2.0,7/26/2013,"We only ordered two pizookies and a quesadilla, yet even with an almost empty restaurant, it took 50 minutes to get our food. The pizookies came out cold with the ice cream melted and the waitress forgot to put in the order for the quesadilla. We were one of three groups eating there, yet we still barely saw our waitress. Everything just seemed lazy and unorganized. If for some weird reason I'm ever craving BJ's, I'll take the extra time to drive to an inland location with a better reputation."
Natalie T.,"Newport Beach, CA",0,4,,5.0,7/12/2015,Bj's is the place to be. My family and I not only come here often because of the fabulous food but because of the most caring and nicest servers. The manager Ricky is amazing! He understood all of our problems because we have such a large party and sat us as quickly as possible. Definitely recommend this place!!!
Megan K.,"San Diego, CA",25,99,15,3.0,4/5/2011,"Came here after a nice morning hike nearby on Saturday.  (Definitely a fun way to start the day! I recommend it for everyone!) The beach was a little crowded (probably cuz it has been raining for the past couple of weekends) so it was a little difficult to find parking.  BTW, the parking meter takes credit card! We ordered a large bbq chicken pizza for the 4 of us which was definitely enough food.  (We also got a small soup, pitcher of beer, and small pizookie for a total of $56 w/o tip.) Food was good, but I thought the pizza's crust was too thick.  It was like eating bread with toppings."
Robert H.,"Denver, CO",164,634,1935,3.0,12/21/2010,"If you are a hands-on eater but want to dine in a nice location then pizza on the coast is an obvious choice. Bj's Restaurant & Brewhouse is terribly crowded, small and the parking situation is laughable. Once you get inside and have your first bite of pizza, none of that matters anymore. The whole restaurant turns into a scene from Lady in the Tramp, substitute pizza for the pasta. The deep dish pizzas are amazing no matter the topping combination but the pizookie is just divine. Wait, What is a pizookie you ask? Pizookie is an old latin term for the ""best dessert in the world."" Rough translation. You take a small deep dish, bake a cookie inside (pizza-cookie) and drop a few scoops of ice cream on top when finished. Stop by to build Your own deep dish pizza that is lightly sauced and prepared with BJ's signature blend of five cheeses. Once you're done consuming the delicious pie, snack on a pizookie and then stroll for a walk at the beach or nearby shops. It'll make for a great date night or time out on the town with friends."
