Cheryl P.,"Vancouver, WA",115,62,6,1.0,7/28/2011,"The space of the restaurant is severely cramped and tiny - not to mention some seats are practically knocking on the men's bathroom door.   Although the food is the same as in every BJ's location - beware the service you'll receive while sardined in this eatery.  The servers employed will be your local pot smokers of America and it clearly shows when they're working. I had a few roomates who worked there a few years ago.  Wondering what goes on behind the counter?  Ever seen the movie Waiting, with Ryan Reynolds?  You should probably watch it before taking a trip to this particular location.   Still in the mood for BJ's?  Try the one in either the Tustin Marketplace or close to the Laguna Hills Mall.  You'll receive much better service."
K H.,"Los Angeles, CA",51,6,,1.0,10/11/2013,"Waited 15 minutes to sit down...not bad...after being seated waited 20 minutes then asked a busboy walking by to tell a server to assist...waited another 10 minutes and then decided to move on. While walking out of this fine establishment I informed the two host/hostess in the front and received an ""Oh wow okay""...hmmm I clearly will not be coming back to BJ's...of course prior to my departure I offered some kind words to the dazed and confused staff :)"
D S.,"Brentwood, CA",1,50,2,3.0,11/9/2014,Not great tasting pizza. (We had to ask for extra sauce just to give it flavor.) Their beer is just all right. Food took a long time to come. And only mildly attentive service. I wasn't offended. It just wasn't that good. There's really no reason not to go somewhere else in that area. There's lots of restaurants and this is not one of the better ones.
Michelle M.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",631,943,154,4.0,8/18/2010,"7:45pm on a Wednesday night and it's still a 25 minute wait for a party of two?! Yup, that's right. But, who cares....sit on the little fence that separates PCH and the sidewalk and watch the ocean and people watch for 25 minutes.  No need to look at the menu. Mini Veggie Pizza and a Blonde Beer please. Never fails. Pizza is always brought out hot and tasty. Beer is always brought out fast and cold.  With the right company, this is by far the best $19 I've spent in awhile. Cheers."
Matt T.,"Laguna Beach, CA",10,40,4,1.0,9/2/2010,"I don't understand why this place is so popular?  I mean there is constantly a wait.  The pizza is sub-par to say the least.  I couldn't even taste the sauce on my pizza, and got sever heartburn the only 2 times I went.  The crust was gross.  Too buttery, and chewy.  Pizza tasted like it was microwaved. The beers they brew there are not that great.  I had 2 different beers there and they were both flat, and skunked.  Their pale ale tastes, and looks like a red ale. The staff was friendly for the most part, and know their menu's well The one somewhat bright spot was the Wings.  They were good.  Vey fresh and tasted great.  Why cant they add the sauce to the wings before they bring them out though? Would I go back again?  No, but maybe get an order of the wings to go."
Leo M.,"Moraga, CA",0,32,,2.0,1/1/2013,"We are just back from the place. We went out late on a Tuesday, new year day. The place was lively and packed, as opposed to a burger joint close by, which was open and empty.  Ok, that was the only positive. The kids' food was barely edible: overly greasy corn dogs, the sticky rice wasn't anything like Chinese sticky rice, the pasta was generic barilla spaguetti, the fries were frozen generic fries. The best thing on the kids menu was the kiddie sundae. That's basically the only thing they ate. Grown ups didn't do much better. The veggie pizza was quite mushy, my rice was tasty but the mahi-mahi was grossly overcooked. It had the texture of cardboard.  This is a place for a good glass of beer and some deep dish pizza, if that's your cup of tea. I believe even a Dennis would fair a bit better with the actual food."
Valcat A.,"Laguna Beach, CA",0,2,,1.0,10/26/2013,"The only bjs with the most unenthusiastic, inconsiderate staff and service I have ever had at a restaurant. The moment we step in, no one greets us with a warm welcome, let alone asks us to take a seat until a waitress finally shows up and asks if we had been assisted. It was a cold day and I had requested the door to remain closed since we had been seated by the window. I asked three times and even after the third time the door remained open. None of the staff I had asked to close the door all seemed to not care. When our food was served, I could hardly even enjoy it because it got cold too fast. On top of all this misfortune, we witness one of the chefs wipe his nose with his hand and walk straight back into the kitchen. Never again."
John L.,"Dana Point, CA",71,58,,1.0,8/19/2010,"I love deep dish pizza and it's decent here but I'm not coming back. Host at this restaurant violated the Robert Downey rule and went full retard (cue Tropic Thunder music...), so it almost doesn't matter how good the pizza is because it's extremely hard to get past the first impression. I called ahead to put our name in queue for a Saturday night and was given a 45 minute wait estimate.  I showed up 40 minutes later and was given a 60 minute wait estimate - and that wasn't counting the time since I called ahead. Normally I understand that wait estimates are exactly that: estimates.  However, the sheer difference between the estimates and the fact that several others waiting were overheard talking about their waits being 2-3x quoted times suggest this was not isolated.  Top it off with a loudmouth berating the host and receiving the next table despite arriving after everyone else takes the cake. Needless to say, a bad experience and we won't be back."
Sonia D.,"Alexandria, VA",29,7,,4.0,8/18/2012,The food came out in a timely manner and the service was good. It would have been 5 star but this location is rather small and there is always a wait.  Jalapeño burger was amazing & I can't stoping wanting to try it again.
Kristi H.,"Saint Louis, MO",30,13,,1.0,7/20/2011,"Don't get me wrong, I love BJ's and they have great food. But this particular BJ's had the worst service I have ever experienced at a restaurant. I went in with three of my friends for a good time. First of all we had to wait almost an hour to be seated. No problem, I understand that you're busy. When we were seated, our waiter came over and hurriedly asked us for drink and appetizer orders before dashing off again. When he came back we asked for an order of Spinach Artichoke Dip and placed our dinner orders. He did not write anything down before hurrying back off to the kitchen to place our orders. After about half an hour our food arrived...no Spinach dip. When a DIFFERENT waitress brought us our food, we asked about the dip...just to make sure we didn't end up paying for it, and she said she would make sure it was cancelled and tell our waiter also. Ten minutes later, our waiter came over and said ""oh, you didn't get your dip...do you still want it?"" No apology. Then when we said no he simply asked ""Well, how's the food?"" And before we could respond, walked away. Didn't hear from him again until almost the end of the meal, when we asked for boxes. He handed them to us over one of our party's shoulder, then scuttled off again. Three boxes...two lids. Cool.  I will never go to this particular BJ's again...I have several friends who are in the food service industry and I would understand if it were just the restaurant being busy. But we saw our waiter chatting it up with several other tables...apparently we simply weren't worth his time and effort."
Jeff W.,"Laguna Beach, CA",0,6,,4.0,10/17/2013,"Just had dinner last night. We were in a hurry to get to an appointment, so did not send back the food. But ordered the California Grilled Chicken Sandwich with wedge cut fries. Received a Parmesan Chicken Sandwich with cold fries. On a positive note the server noticed the error and corrected the bill without my having to complain. ***Just realized this is the wrong restaurant but the app will not allow me to delete the review. Just edit it.***"
Scott M.,"Laguna Beach, CA",0,18,,1.0,10/8/2013,"I live in Laguna Beach and this place can be good at times. The problem is I have been to the BJs in Huntington Beach. (Which is fantastic food!)  This location does not deliver anymore, they used to-which means I only go at very slow times. There is no parking in Laguna unless you are very lucky. I ordered to go and got two pizzas. The deep dish pizza is just terrible. Scant toppings and all bread that reminded me of challa bread. Even scraping off the top layer was scant reward. I am never eating at this location again. (You also have to walk through the homeless bums at all times of the day.) Must be a poor manager/owner that is trying to save pennies on the cheese. Laguna Beach has two kinds of restaurants, those that really try and those that serve tourists who they don't care if they ever return. BJs Laguna is the second kind. Locals in Laguna Beach have a few gems, but not for pizza."
J J.,"Los Angeles, CA",337,195,342,1.0,11/19/2012,"Diego the manager was great! Our server Ellis was fantastic!! Remy is a complete rude server!!! If it wasnt for Diego and Ellis, I would have reviewed very very badly for this small BJ's!!! The reason: REMY, yelled at my friends and I for being too loud during the BUSY LUNCH CROWD!! Can you believe that? He had the nerve to tell us to be quiet because we were being too loud for other customers. What?? We weren't even being that loud! Also, given that the place is practically  little hole in the wall, of course its going to echo when there are large groups of people. And just because the couple in front of us (total tourists!) complained about the noise level, DOES NOT, I REPEAT DOES NOT mean that he, REMY, had to come to our table with that look on his face like we're loud buffoons, and practically scold us. HELLO??? We are paying customers who are in the same industry and we know WAY too much about customer service. His actions were unforgivable.  SO, I had to complain to the manager and he apologized, and gave me his business card. BUT so WHAT? No complimentary visit next time comp, or anything of the sort. THUS I am writing this review with not good a heart and giving them a poor rating. * IN FAVOR OF: UMM... The fact that its at Laguna Beach. PERIOD! * AGAINST: INCOMPETENT WAITERS AND managers who can't handle them."
Pishool P.,"Laguna Beach, CA",13,65,136,3.0,9/21/2012,Bj's is my favorite pizza chain! Although this spot doesn't have the full menu of the Bj's ! So no Avocado egg-roll or you here  !:)
Shane B.,"Palm Desert, CA",18,13,,1.0,8/10/2012,We went there today and were seated... Waited about 7 to 10 minutes with servers just walking by blanking us... You can take your chance but don't recommended going there unless you like to wait to be acknowledged!!!!
Nancy E.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",1,14,,4.0,9/14/2014,Very casual. I love that it is open late I have been served by Whitney twice who was awesome. I like that their is a huge selection. Pazookies are a must. I wish they were a little more efficient at the host desk
David W.,"New York, NY",150,833,,3.0,1/7/2010,"This place is okay, but nothing special.  The thing it has going for it is it's the only spot in Laguna Beach that's open relatively late (10pm).  I got the California Grilled Chicken sandwich which was a pretty good price for a good sized sandwich and a massive heaping of fries for about $10.  The bad part is the sandwich was covered in butter which wasn't really necessary at all. If you need a late night spot, with good value come here.  If other things are open and you want higher quality (and more expensive) food, head elsewhere."
Don S.,"Laguna Beach, CA",82,22,5,3.0,5/6/2012,This place usually has a long wait.  It wouldn't be so bad but they are inaccurate at estimating their wait times. Chips are VERY salty.  Pizza is good. Prices are high.
Thomas D.,"Peoria, IL",12,7,,3.0,6/6/2012,"I came in here late one night to place a carryout order.  After walking inside we were told that they were closed, but agreed to take our carryout order anyway.  Overall, the food was okay, but the place was a little dirty.  I waited at an empty table that hadn't been cleared yet from the last patrons.  Despite waiting much longer than the time I was quoted, no one ever came to clear the table.  With that said, the food hit the spot and I was very grateful to the employee who allowed us to place an order after they were closed."
Trent E.,"Laguna Beach, CA",0,21,1,2.0,2/27/2013,"I'm giving this BJ's 2 stars because the food that they DO have is good. Unfortunately, they don't have most of the food that makes BJ's so great at this location. Always overpacked and always undermanned. The beer is good though, and that's a plus."
