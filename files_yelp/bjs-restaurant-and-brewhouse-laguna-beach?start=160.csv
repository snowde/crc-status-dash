Needah K.,"Los Angeles, CA",76,118,18,1.0,3/19/2014,I go to this place after many years. This was place a horrible experience and the food was disgusting we hAd to send it back. The staff is sloppy and the place is dirty.  I'm surprised this place hasn't been shut down by the health department.  I would never recommend anyone to go there.
Sm K.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,7,,2.0,7/31/2014,This place is NOT a BJ's. They don't have the full menu (no avocado egg rolls & other BJ's favorites) and it's a really tiny. Parking is a nightmare. There is no parking for the restaurant only meters around the corner or $20 - $30 daily parking down the block. Not worth your time or money.
Chrystal Anne M.,"Irvine, CA",286,53,23,3.0,1/28/2012,"Love this location of BJ's. There menu is smaller then the other locations but its not that big of a deal, just a mention. Our waiter was awesome. Very friendly and attentive. We had the Blue Cheese burger and a salad. Very good quality and tasty. I don't find many good blue cheese burgers, this place definitely has one that is worth checking out."
Rochelle W.,"Lake Forest, CA",1,9,18,2.0,5/4/2014,"On Saturday afternoon I came to this BJs for dinner with some friends. When we walked up to the host stand a brunette young woman was standing their staring down at her phone clearly texting. We stood there staring at her, and realized she knew we were there but had to finish her super important text message before she could greet us. When she finished she put her phone down and greeted us with the sassiest attitude (since we were such a bother and interrupted her super important text message or Instagram post, whatever she was doing.) She grabbed menus and handed them to the male host next to her so he could take us to our table and then went straight back to her phone. I thought this was so unprofessional. I never bother to post on yelp and probably wouldn't have if she didn't have such a not caring attitude. Service was a little slow but I'm a server and  I understand it was busy. Food was awesome as always. I've never been to this BJ's and really wanted to leave happy but they should definitely get some better customer service at the host stand!"
Marco L.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,4,,1.0,6/18/2014,The worst restaurant ever the  food sucks. Ordered the salmon and got dog food.food sucks just like their cooperate staff still waiting for a callback from tammy.
Anthony M.,"Seattle, WA",1,8,7,1.0,3/3/2012,"Service was great. Waitress was very nice and prompt, but the pizza was horrible. I had the ""BJ's Favorite"" BJ'S favorite pizza must have been a Digornio, because that's exactly what it tasted like....Way too greasy crust and the toppings had to be the same they use at Pizza Hut. Plus 28 bucks for 2 mini pizzas and 4 sticks of garlic bread!?! Call me a pizza snob, but If I want to torture my tastebuds like that again, I'll get a Digornio with garlic bread combo in the freezer section for $8.99"
Elnaz S.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",2,12,,2.0,5/28/2011,"We came here for dinner on a Saturday night.  Everything about this place was mediocre except for the location (Great spot in the heart of the Laguna Beach strip area). The reason for the 2 rating: This particular BJ's location had a much smaller menu than other BJ's (no avocado rolls!).  The wait was long. The food was alright (We ordered the Veggie Burger and the California Burger) The staff seemed very mechanical, nothing memorable about the service here.  If the staff (server/hostess) were more outgoing and friendly, we would have probably given the place a 3 rating instead of a 2."
Ryan R.,"Dana Point, CA",0,1,,3.0,4/2/2012,"So it may not be exactly like the deep dish pizza you would find in the Windy city, it's not a bad place!  My wife and I really enjoy the pizza here and we especially enjoy the pazookies!  I will agree with another fellow yelp user and say that the hostesses are not the brightest nor are they the most considerate as they are sitting on their iPhones while you are standing there waiting for them to take your name.  I'm huge on customer service and our experiences with the hostesses influenced my decision in giving them three stars.   If you feel like a simple meal and not paying top dollar like you would at some of the other locations in town?  Then BJs might be a place you like."
cheryl w.,"Las Vegas, NV",27,58,51,4.0,4/20/2011,"I love this place.... Pizookie is AWESOME!!  We also love the variety of appetizers they have....really good ones that you can make a meal out of.  It's quite small for such a busy area, but we don't mind going in the off hours to have a meal, as the prices are great, portions are awesome and food is just plain good!  Will go back again and again!"
Sahand S.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",555,7,,4.0,9/1/2011,"BJ's is incredible in general, but I especially love this one! It's right across the street from the water and the nice walking areas and right in the heart of Laguna Beach.  The food is amazing just like at any other BJ's and PIZOOKIE is the best dessert known to man!"
Angela P.,"Fullerton, CA",264,30,1,3.0,12/18/2010,"My fiancee and I went here for lunch the other day with our son. Didn't realize how tiny it was on the inside just from looking at it outside. I felt a little bad bringing my stroller and talkative child in there, but luckily it was not a busy Thursday! The wait staff was very nice and attentive. Food was great although I wished we had seen the deep fried artichokes ahead of time! Overall we had a normal BJ's experience. We were in and out of there within 45 minutes."
Xerxes M.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",0,19,,5.0,5/20/2011,"BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse is really a good spot to have a good time at the same time be satisfied and full with the food.  My friends and I picked this place randomly and we were all so happy with our selection. I think it was the best thing we ever decided on. LOL. So as we ordered our food, I noticed the menu has so much to offer. You would be really having a hard time choosing your meal because everything just looks so delicious.  So for the appetizer, we tried CHICKEN WINGS. It's more than a pound of crisp, tender chicken wings, drizzled with hot and spicy buffalo sauce and ranch dressing. Served with celery sticks, extra sauce and dressing for dipping. Wow, that was only for appetizer and we were already so happy with it! So we ordered the BJ'S FAVORITE pizza! Oven baked meatballs, pepperoni, Italian sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, black olives, white onions and seasoned tomatoes. I can't believe this pizza is so good that we were all quiet while we were eating. We're just savoring every moment of perfection. And last but not the least, desserts!! BJ'S FAMOUS PIZOOKIE,  save room for the often imitated, never duplicated, one and only original Pizookie®...freshly baked, hot out of the oven, rich and delicious cookie topped with two scoops of vanilla bean ice cream and served in its own deep dish and my choice of Chocolate Macadamia Nut. Just HEAVEN! We decided that we're going back again here to try some of their pasta, salads, and maybe the build your own pizza!! I'm recommending it to everyone, you should give it a try!"
Carrie C.,"Los Angeles, CA",374,913,295,4.0,5/8/2007,"I'm so going to disagree with all the other reviews for the most part.  Yes, it's a small location and parking can be a bitch to say the least...not to mention the wait you'll probably have in order to get a table seeing as it's so ""wee"" inside.  BUT...the food is exactly the same as every other BJ's I've been too...and the beer is just as delish. What makes THIS BJ's so great is that it IS near the beach on PCH and that gives it some charm.  You can spend a day checking out the shops on Forest Ave. or plopped on your ass on the sand of Main Beach and then head on over for a mini pizza at BJ's. I recommend the mini pizza for one person: Veggie pizza with a side of ranch to dip in.  YUM.  Also...check out a taster of their beers...you can get a four taster OR a 7 taster...can beat the later for $8.50!! Then head on back outside and check out a kick butt sunset over the Pacific!!"
Ed M.,"Banning, CA",0,23,,3.0,2/18/2011,I usually know that I can rely on BJ's wherever I go but this one is a disappointment. It's a small location (about 50 seats) and a slimmed down menu. All beers are available. Food was fine but server really seemed at a loss even with only 4 2-tops.  Choices are slim in this town so BJ's is at least acceptable.
Michael M.,"Denver, CO",9,23,1,2.0,11/26/2006,"This layout is one of the worst BJs around.  So small.  Sure it's in a great location -- but what good is that if you can't sit down.   That being said, the pizza is great.  Too bad to hear a fellow yelper got old oil.   I wouldn't recommend getting BJs for takeout.  Its great right out of the oven."
Caroline G.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",145,111,49,1.0,11/18/2012,"Last night sprinkle of rain and thin crowds for a Saturday... This BJ's is small compared to others in the chain. Has about 20 tables for two and six or seven booths. Manager with goatee and glasses isn't managing the restaurant, he stands out front with sweet hostess and fiddles with the football games on TV but never spoke to employees for the hour we were there. Floor dirty, table dirty, bathroom papers tossed around and crowded kitchen also not clean. 37 minutes for our veggie pizza (ordered it many times before) but the crust was not cooked through. Tired and my son only wanted the yummy chocolate chip cookie with ice cream ( was great) Service friendly and kind from ""Mike"" There were 6-7 servers for 12 filled tables. I think they expected a regular busy Saturday. I won't return. Expensive. The fun part of this place is being at Main Beach and watching all the activity. The mirrors and light fixtures are a nice touch but..."
Brooke K.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",34,4,,2.0,7/25/2012,"Average food, LONG wait time, apathetic server...won't be going back."
Jimmy L.,"Chicago, IL",5,27,,2.0,9/25/2010,"I hate that the first reviews I'm giving are so low, but I want to be honest here...  Service was OK, we didn't have to wait for seating, though the place definitely fills up. We were there on a weeknight, relatively early and it was full. I think I remember seeing something about 'Chicago style', but when we asked about spinach we were told they only had the spinach and artichoke 'pre-mix' (ugh) and don't offer spinach as a topping. Hello? I'm not a pizza snob, but I LOVE pizza, and I loves me my thick Chicago-style stuffed spinach pizza (Giordanos). So we ordered sausage, peperoni and extra cheese, medium pan style. Surprised that there wasn't much flavor. Fresh enough, hot, crust was OK, but just not spicy enough.   For the price, I would not return."
Ellen R.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,21,,5.0,5/31/2009,"My five-star rating is just for the deep dish pizza and its croissant-like crust.  It is delectable!  As a former Chicagoan, I claim some expertise in deep dish pizza (eating, not making), and I've got to say that B.J.'s makes the best.  I've never had any crust like that.  Ever.   We live in Phoenix, so we have BJ's here, too, but the best BJ experience is in Laguna.  Don't bother standing in the those long lines along PCH every night or sit in the cramped restaurant, even though it can be enjoyable on a good day with the shutters open.  Instead, opt for going to take-out and go eat your pizza on the boardwalk at Main Beach.  Just something about that sand blowing on there!   I haven't had much else at B.J.'s  The multicolored chips and salsa was very good.  Didn't care much for the thin crust pizza appetizer.   The Pazooki (huge hot cookie served in a pie plate with ice cream on top) is yummy, but the last one I had, it was uncooked in the center.  However, you get a free one if you tell them it's your birthday!"
Madiya M.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,53,7,1.0,6/5/2012,"This particular BJs sucks!! Always a wait... Most items missing on their menu... Pizza is always cold, hard, or ""messed up"" in some way... Service is questionable.. And they'll steal your belongings in broad daylight and won't let u view their surveillance videos... (one the staff members stole my iPhone and after I used Find My iPhone to track it to that BJs AFTER they had closed, they refused to let me or themselves view any type of surveillance videos)... I would def not recommend going to this location..."
