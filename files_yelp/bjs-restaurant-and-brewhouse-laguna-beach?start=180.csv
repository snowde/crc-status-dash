MonaMona B.,"Cerritos, CA",14,2,,4.0,6/29/2010,I love deep dish pizza with Spinach and Artichoke at BJ's. My first choice here! : )
Austin M.,"Dallas, TX",132,135,62,4.0,1/3/2009,"This place is pretty good. I ate here last year for the 4th of July. It was super busy that day, but we got seated pretty quick. I was really hungry that day, so maybe that's why the food tasted good, lol. The food wasn't amazing, but it was good enough. Our waitress was very nice and polite, and that is always important to me. They have outdoor seating too, but I only recommend sitting outside during the day, becase it's pretty cold during the night since it's right next to the beach. I'd defanitly come back to eat here again. Maybe for July 4th, 2009 ? Lol."
Timothy B.,"Beaumont, CA",3,18,,4.0,3/20/2011,"I love BJ's.  This is a great spot right off the beach.  Their Pizzas are great.  Pizookie's are even better.  The only problem with this place is that is small.  It can be hard to get in, and the tables are small.  So you might get bumped into a few times."
Victor O.,"Laguna Beach, CA",1,47,,1.0,8/25/2006,"This is probably the most over rated pizza joint in Laguna Beach, but it enjoys a great location that leads to lines you can't believe to get in and have mediocre pizza at its best.  As a local, the last time (and I mean the last time) we ordered 6 pizza's to go we ended up with old oil being used to make them - and that is inexcusable.  It is not worth the hour plus wait - and there are plenty of good pizza's in town.  Trust me, we live here!"
Sopla R.,"Chicago, IL",0,247,,2.0,9/25/2010,"I saw deep dish..and it looked charming enough.. but when I looked at the menu and decided I wanted to build my own pizza..I asked the waiter and he told me and I quote:   sorry,  but no you can't have spinach and garlic and cheese pizza because the spinach is mixed with artichokes...ALREADY...so immediately.. I thought .. oh a ""chain"" and I saw the bags of ingredients already mixed and immediately I wished we could have gone somewhere else...but we choose dif. toppings and it came out and it was hot and it was OK.. but for a pizza place to liken themselves even remotely to Chicago style deep dish and not even have  a spinach topping is just well disappointing.. so even though, for the $ the food and atmosphere and service were OK.. I'd never go back..because they tasted like a chain.. nothing special here at all. wasnt the worst pizza but next time I'm in laguna I'll seek out a real pizza place.."
jay c.,"DuPont, WA",0,3,,3.0,3/4/2011,"Well I ventured to Bj's to have a quiet dinner with my wife. Our wait time was not too long and i was able to converse with the host to pass the time  while the wait elapsed. I accidently stumbled upon his conversation with another host in regards to how he kicked a pidgeon? I was very disturbed in regards to this conversation so i returned back to my wife. Debating whether to stay or leave...we stayed.  Around 15 minutes we were seated at a nice booth. The atmosphere was nice, a clear, clean restaurant. The servers all seemed nice and helpful throughout our stay. Midway through out meal, I believe, the general manager approached our table and began to speak with us about our stay and how everything was. At first it seemed like a nice gesture until he would not leave my wife and I alone to enjoy our meals.... It began to consume the majority of the time we were able to stay there and became quite frustrating. I actually politely asked him if he would leave us to our meals but he had hearing aid in so i dont think he heard me.  A few minutes after he left we were able to finish our meals.  We left the restaurant, and as we passed the host we noticed him giving his phone number to girls that seemed way to young for him. Overall a great trip but they have very interesting people in terms of the gm and host. I believe bjs is an equal opportunity restaurant which would explain why they had such an interesting host....didnt seem like the sharpest tool in the shed"
