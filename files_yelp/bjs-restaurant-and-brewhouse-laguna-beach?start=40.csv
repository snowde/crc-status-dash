Julia R.,"Long Beach, CA",61,37,61,1.0,7/26/2016,"Came to the restaurant because it was more reasonably priced than others in Laguna. My husband and I went to the hostess and asked her if we needed a reservation. She said no. I then asked her how long the wait would be. She said less than five minutes, a table needed to be cleaned. We said ok. She didn't ask for our names or for any sort of info. We sat on the bench in front of the hostess podium and waited. Five minutes passed. Ten minutes. 20 minutes passed. No word from the hostess or the other hostesses. A couple of a different ethnic group came up and got seated immediately?? They might have been joining someone inside but it did not seem that way because another couple of the same ethnicity went in before us too. Unbelievable"
Carla G.,"Chicago, IL",0,30,1,5.0,5/4/2017,"I've been here 3 times. Every time I visit the staff members are super nice. I can't remember the name of the waiter we had last time I went but he was so nice to me and my family. The food is excellent, loved the pizza."
Matt H.,"Huntington Beach, CA",4,60,7,2.0,6/3/2016,Didn't actually eat here. We were told it would be a 15 minute wait. We bailed after 35 minutes. Told the manager and he was indifferent. Said he was sorry but made no attempt to help us. Thanks for that. Glad we saw the interior though -- otherwise we wouldn't have seen how cramped and uncomfortable it was. And the bathroom wasn't well looked after. Skip this location of at all possible. Seems poorly managed and maintained.
Jeffrey T.,"Long Beach, CA",31,28,5,4.0,2/14/2017,"BJ's is fairly consistent from one place to another, but we really enjoyed our visit to BJ's in Laguna Beach. Michael, our server, was supremely skilled in customer service, personal interaction and patience. We were never rushed and he had great recommendations and suggestions when asked. He has onviously been doing this for awhile, because his demeanor was supremely friendly withou seeming condescending or trite (something that is all-too frequent in many places these days!). The food was excellent, as always. The new Mandarin Green Tea was a plus...I love iced tea and this one was a palatable revelation! The meal wasn't extraordinarily special, but BJ's is consistent and virtually ALWAYS on point with quality, portion and taste. Above all, the servce staff (like Michael) all seem to work together to deliver all patrons fast, eficient and comfortable service. I wouldn't normally travl from Long Beach to Laguna Beach just for BJ's, but when I am in Laguna Beach and want a predictbly delicious mal at a good price with outstanding servic, I know I can go to this BJ's and not be disappointed. Thanks for a nice lunchtime visit, Michael. You directly contributed to our enjoyable experience, just as much a the food! See you again!"
Ralph L.,"Long Beach, CA",285,404,144,4.0,1/19/2015,"Love the location here in downtown Laguna Beach. Perfect way to refuel or relax after a long day at the beach or hiking the Laguna canyons. It's not even a bad place to take a date after walking around the city, since there are four tables here with ridiculously beautiful views of the beach and ocean. The host was very accommodating to our request for an ocean-view table, the manager hooked us up with a free mini pizookie for signing up for BJ's email spam, and of course, the pizza was good. My girlfriend liked lighter and fluffier crust on this deep-dish, though personally I prefer the thicker, buttery crust you'd find at Hollywood Pies, Rance's, Masa, or Costco. The kale and brussel sprouts salad was tasty, though suspiciously only had one brussel sprout. TL;DR: decent food, great location, recommended"
Jose Z.,"Irvine, CA",0,8,,1.0,7/5/2016,One thing that I can't tolerate is horrible service.  I went in there tonight to get a simple desert with my girlfriend and due to staff being inattentive and very slow we wait for fifteen minutes and not once did any staff come to us and ask if we were ready for our orders to be taken.  The waiter that was in charge of our section of the restaurant also went to the other table three different times asking how there meal was and if there was anything else that he could assist them with. Not once did he look over at us and acknowledge that we were waiting to be served.
Colette T.,"Blue Ridge, GA",162,8,,4.0,9/18/2016,Always fun to eat here in Laguna Beach. Pizza was yummy and the Pizookie is always my fav!
Katie G.,"Carlsbad, CA",60,103,134,5.0,9/17/2015,"I know this BJ's has some bad reviews, but I came for my birthday dinner and had an amazing dining experience. I don't remember the name of the waiter, but he was one of the best waiters I've had at any restaurant in a while.  We were seated right away by a friendly host, and got food and drink menus. If you go on a weekend expect it to be a little crowded. It's a small BJ's compared to the others.  The food was amazing!! I love the lighter calorie menu items, and the red wine I ordered was extremely smooth and rich.  Loved the food, loved the service, and loved the birthday pizookie!"
Thickum S.,"Spokane, WA",0,6,,5.0,9/21/2016,"The atmosphere was very pleasant. It's located right by Laguna Beach, it's small but comforting. The servers were very nice. The food, was fresh, hot, and cooked to my liking. The portion size was great. I had garlic chicken pesto pizza, it came on a thin crust, amazing. My bro and sister's meals were delicious also. I will visit this place again on my next trip to California."
M K.,"Laguna Beach, CA",0,9,,1.0,10/17/2016,"I have lived in Laguna for 7 years and never gone here. ive been to BJ's in other cities and it's ok but I prefer the unique/non chain places that I cant go to anywhere else. Plus it doesnt have a bar and I usually walk down to a restaurant alone and hate to take up a table when I can just take up a stool. today on my walk I stopped for lunch thinking it was time to see what it looked like inside (it is offseason, not busy). it's tiny, but was pretty empty so I didnt feel bad taking a table to myself. my server Christoper S came over and I ordered a glass of merlot (he didnt know what I was talking about, but I guessed it was because he wasnt really paying attention to me, not because it was an odd order. they only have one merlot on the menu so it shouldnt be hard). he brought it back and I ordered a chicken dish. he brought my dish out and it was fine but his service suggested he couldnt be bothered with me. after I started eating he came by to ask if I was done. I wasnt halfway through yet. he then came back to ask if I was done (again!) and I scarfed down the last bites while he stood and waited! I have no idea why he was so impatient. there were only about two other tables full and they werent his. he made me so uncomfortable but then angry. so when he took my plate I ordered another glass of wine (just to piss him off). he brought it and then asked if I would want a third or if he could bring the check!?? I have no idea what the rush was. there was no one waiting for a table. I sat there nursing my wine thinking maybe he was leaving and wanted to cash out (most servers tell you that if they are leaving), but he stayed working. apparently he just couldnt be bothered with me. I routinely visit and support many places in town and regularly tip 50%. im not sure why he chose to be rude to me and rush me out, but I wont be back and my inclination to stay away all this time was right.  bottom line, dont stand outside waiting for this place. go to watermarc, nicks, The Cliff, Gigi's or somewhere else instead.  p.s-the only nice interaction I had was a manager (?) who came over to ask me about email on my phone and chat a bit. perhaps he sensed how rude his server was...sadly for him I was actually already starting this review because I felt so uncomfortable and unwelcome by their server."
Phillip C.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",0,2,,1.0,2/13/2017,Used DoorDash...bjs gave the delivery man the wrong order...I used DoorDash as our baby's room  is over our garage and didn't want to wake him by opening it...we got burned on DoorDash service and tip cost...woke the baby to collect pizza...manager was reluctant to remake us another pizza besides it being 90 mins old...offered no apology...bjs seen last of my business
Gonzo A.,"Irvine, CA",264,11,3,4.0,8/22/2016,"Really great customer service, all of the servers were so kind. Super helpful I didn't have to wait for anything, I got a drink refill when I needed one. I really didn't like the sandwich I got and the server was so kind enough to switch it out for me. Glad I came here tonight."
Amanda C.,"San Diego, CA",312,17,2,5.0,6/14/2016,"I love it!!!  Such a small location compared to others...they don't even have a cocktail menu! (Occupancy 60 ppl...what?????) But the beer was great and our server recommended some pizza flavors that I hadn't heard of and we LOVED them! They were so accommodating and welcoming and sweet and we loved our experience there! Thank you, BJ's Laguna Beach!"
May B.,"Fountain Valley, CA",0,2,,1.0,1/3/2017,Ok the food was really good but the service is horrible i asked a waiter to take a picture of us and he told me i need to be polite three times because i didn't ask him Can you please take a picture .. i was in shock because i didnt say anything ..and i wasnt rude at all .. he was so rude and i will never go to this Location because i don't want to see him again  .. his service is the worst.. like his job is to serve us and be nice
Debbie M.,"Woodland Hills, CA",99,329,95,5.0,6/10/2016,"Very good food and excellent service, this is my favorite spot to come when I'm in Laguna Beach. But I noticed, unless I'm crazy, that it costs a lot more than it does where I live! I got a mini pizza, which is only 4 slices, and it was $11.25! I think it doesn't cost that much where I live, I think where I live, it's seven or eight dollars!"
Joe B.,"Laguna Beach, CA",0,15,,5.0,11/23/2016,Great food and great service. Be sure to get a pizooki at the end of your meal. They are known for their deep dish pizza so be sure to partake.
Ken H.,"West Covina, CA",5,11,8,1.0,2/13/2016,"Bad service. Will not return. I'm sure missing out on a tip will not make a difference, but the horrible attitude and making us wait an excess amount of time for something we ordered was definitely warranted. Your staff seems unhappy to serve customers. methinks management allows this to happen. Hence the numerous bad reviews. This joint will not change. Caveat emptor."
Barbara S.,"Mission Viejo, CA",39,226,2,5.0,4/16/2016,"I can't say enough about this restaurant, manager and server.  We were a group of 16 on Friday.  Shea our server was kind, helpful, and wonderful. We had appetizers, lunch specials, and of course PIzookies. We all felt the lunch specials were reasonably priced and delicious.  The choices amongst our group where soup & salad, bacon chicken padina, chicken Alfredo, spaghetti and meatballs, and pizza. Please everyone stop here for lunch or dinner."
Christine L.,"Pomona, CA",5,6,,2.0,5/4/2017,to be honest i love BJ's but after spending 20 minutes in traffic and looking for parking only to find out this locations doesn't have a full menu was disappointing. we ended up leaving to go to another location offering a full menu.
Tammy G.,"Huntington Beach, CA",319,714,5721,4.0,6/13/2012,"I've never found a BJ's I didn't love. This one is super busy - but the food is consistently good, and the view while you wait to be seated is superb. I love the wings. I love the pizza. Kids love the pazzookie. One of my daughters has worked at a BJ's in Huntington Beach for a long time - and I trust her opinion - she says she loves it all, and still isn't tired of it after eating a meal every shift. I am stuck on pizza with beef, tomatos, mushrooms, onions & bellpeppers...and some wings. And craft beer?  OF COURSE!"
