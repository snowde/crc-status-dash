Adam W.,"Irvine, CA",58,15,7,5.0,6/19/2016,Tiffany B. is an excellent server who provided wonderful advice for beer pairings; she provided friendly service; and she was overall very pleasant. I would hope to have her as a server again when I come back here.
Heather R.,"Ladera Ranch, CA",69,3,,1.0,2/27/2016,This is the worst BJ's I have even been too. We have been several times during the week at lunch time and the service is awful and the food has taken at least 30 minutes to come to the table. No one cares in there and management is no where to be found! I will NEVER go back!!!!
Jordan S.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",10,114,13,2.0,2/28/2015,"We just came in for a party pazookie for the birthday girl and was extremely disappointed! 1/2 chocolate chip, 1/4 macadamia nut, and 1/4 cookies and cream (Oreo). The whole friggin pazookie was burnt. I mean it was hard as a rock.  There were kids in our party, so the server should've brought plates for everyone. Didn't happen. She dropped off 8 spoons and half were seriously dirty. I got up and grabbed plates myself. It just seems like they didn't care. That's very off-putting. 2 stars."
Chiryze L.,"Cambridge, MA",0,8,,1.0,1/1/2016,"Just used online ordering and it was horrible. Our food was supposed to be ready at 7 pm. We called at 7 pm just to make sure it was ready and we were told it would be ready at 7:10 pm. My husband arrived to pick up our food at 7:25 pm and our food still wasn't ready! It was not ready until 7:40 pm. How disappointing! Even worse, speaking to the manager was useless. He said that the online system isn't hooked up to Laguna Beach. As locals and regulars at BJ's, we are extremely disappointed at the incompetence and lack of accountability from the hostess to the manager."
Jane D.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,29,10,5.0,4/22/2016,"This many stars is ONLY for the employee we had that was generous enough to help us when our actual waitress was busy being unavailable for far too long.These stars are for a specific part of the cut in the back by the kitchen, her name was Dana. We appreciated her taking care of our table so willingly and she did a wonderful job at that when she was not a waitress. Thank you Dana your the only reason our experience gave this location 5 stars. She went over and above what it took to give the name excellent customer service when multiple other people had the opportunity. You are remembered and we hope your managers acknowledge the excellence you provide as a team member there."
L R.,"Edwards, CA",0,7,,2.0,4/10/2017,"We were sat down and told our waiter would be present soon. After waiting a bit another guy came up and told us our waiter would be with us soon but we were ready to order..  He told us that the large pizzas were half off today. For that reason, we ordered a large pizza. We waited 30 minutes for our pizza that's when our waiter showed up. The waiter came up and I asked her about the pizookie because I wanted to order one. She gave me a pamphlet and didn't even wait or ask if I wanted it. I was interested but after that and seeing that other customers that waiter was serving were getting just as slow service as us ... we just changed our mind. I will say one thing.. the pizza was good. And the other waiter that was working was working her butt off. After we were done our receipt came back and the pizza wasn't half off. I felt like they were trying to lie to me..very shady... I asked the waiter and she said she had to ask her manager. Came back and it was half off. If I wasn't paying attention I probably would have paid for it. It wasn't even busy.. in there about an hour.. only saw our waiter 2 or 3 times. Didn't ask if everything was okay."
Soomi P.,"Irvine, CA",489,473,92,4.0,5/5/2013,"This location is MUCH smaller than other BJ's I've been to, but I love how it's right next to the beach! The food, drinks, pizookis are all the same as those served at other locations. I LOVE the staff here! They're super friendly and nice! Definitely will be back soon!"
Ria O.,"San Diego, CA",0,9,5,5.0,2/9/2016,"My friends and I always come here when we meet in Laguna beach. Central location, lots of parking nearby, and it's right across Main Beach. Plenty of tvs so you'll never miss a game!"
Bill M.,"Seattle, WA",0,1,,1.0,7/23/2015,"I go to other BJs all the time and generally like them.  The experience here was bad.   Wait staff was rude, the manager unresponsive and his very insincere apology just made matters worse. Won't come back."
Jonathan V.,"Big Bear City, CA",79,13,14,1.0,10/31/2014,Was not impressed with service. It was expressed by our server that I made the error with my pizza. Took forever. And it wasn't even busy. Not too enthused with BJ's lately; they seem to be lowering their standard of service. Bummer.
Christina D.,"Scottsdale, AZ",103,32,3,2.0,12/29/2015,"The only high points are that it is open late and the service was solid. Still in shock that they used canned stewed tomatoes on a pizza and called it edible cuisine. I regretted not sending the food back, but my time is more valuable than mediocre food."
Shahram M.,"Newport Beach, CA",63,200,226,5.0,7/12/2015,"Great location. Great food. Awesome deep dish pizza. Great salads. Awesome brew. And the best manager in town. Rick, the manager, is super attentive to everyone's need. A must go place in Laguna."
Stephanie R.,"Chino, CA",222,10,1,5.0,7/12/2016,"We had a great experience today, was very relaxing and not too pricey. Ethan was a wonderful server and could not have done a better job."
Gale L.,"Dana Point, CA",0,5,,2.0,8/27/2016,BJs is a decent place if you're looking for a chain restaurant in a great area. The wait is usually rather long but it's in a nice area. Parking is hard to find. I recommend a bread bowl!
Jackie H.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",57,16,1,5.0,12/1/2015,"We love this place. It is a frequent date night spot for my husband and me. We always sit at the front of the restaurant by the windows, to ensure we get the same waiter. He is hilarious, the best and our favorite. We get a beer sampler 4 8oz tasters, they are perfect for the entire meal. We normally split an appetizer and the meat lovers deep dish pizza. To die for! Bj's always treats us with respect, kindness, and great service. We highly recommend!! The people watching as well it great entertainment during your meal!"
Otto A.,"La Habra Heights, CA",9,1,,1.0,5/30/2015,If you want the worst service in any Bj's Restaurant franchise then this is the place to visit! The service is bad and slower than a snail and honestly I will never come back here again!
Aida G.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,20,,5.0,1/18/2016,The best pizza i have ever tried! I ate the entire small pie by myself. they have a great menu of beers as well. great view
Cesar C.,"Whittier, CA",163,5,2,1.0,5/30/2015,"Service is horible. The server seemed like he wasn't in the mood to serve our table. We ordered a small pizza and took so long for it to come out. When we asked the server about it he said ""oh ya I accidentally dropped it so I just put in a new order"" then he wasn't too happy we just asked to cancel the pizza."
Darien G.,"Des Moines, IA",0,174,,3.0,6/22/2016,"Was in the area recently for a week and we had a meal at BJs.  I enjoyed their beers and overall we thought the pizzas were good.  I had a deep dish BJs classic combo, which is sausage, pepperoni, mushroom.  Reminded me of Pizza Hut pan pizza!  It is really noisy and since it is family-friendly you get lots of screeching kids.  Service was fine, prices were fine for the area.  I probably don't need to go here again, but it was fine for us.  I wouldn't discourage anybody from trying it, but also won't ever tell anybody it is a ""must""..."
Kate B.,"Laguna Hills, CA",333,66,41,5.0,10/14/2015,"I love BJ's, but this is my favorite one. My family would always come here when I was a kid and we still love it. The food is always fabulous and overall the service is usually good. This restaurant is very small, and very popular, so there is usually a long wait. I would suggest making time to be waiting if you're planning on coming here and to go somewhere else if you're in a rush. But if you can take your time, check it out! And don't forget to save room for a Pizookie!!!"
