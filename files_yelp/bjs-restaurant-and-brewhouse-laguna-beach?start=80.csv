Andrew S.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",71,280,21,3.0,7/5/2015,Meh. Just like all the other BJ chain restaurants. Nothing special. I do like to wings though. And sharing a pizza is nice. But I'd rather get something local if I'm in the area
Chris V.,"Santa Clarita, CA",71,23,1,4.0,9/8/2015,I placed an order for a pizza to go... The restaurant wasn't really busy but it still took about 25 minutes for my order to be cooked. Still it was a good pizza and overall good experience...
Paul M.,"Newport Beach, CA",0,19,1,5.0,6/21/2016,My wife and I had lunch here while in town for our 20th anniversary. I had a grilled ham and cheese which was excellent (they use Havarti which happens to be my favorite cheese). My wife had a chicken bacon ranch sandwich that she loved as well. Totally satisfied lunch experience
Van T.,"San Clemente, CA",0,1,,1.0,6/20/2016,"Was going to Adolfo's but it was closed for fathers day, so we ended up at BJ'S, what a bummer. We've eaten there many times but this will be the our last. I won't say what happened because I never want anyone to get fired but it definitely put a damper on the day. Adolfo's would have been better, cheaper and we would have been treated like family as always."
Kenna G.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",1,35,52,5.0,2/7/2015,Never seem to disappoint. Pricing is reasonable and food is dank af. Their pizookies are obviously top notch and the buffalo wings are bomb too. Ive never had their pizza but it's prob also delish. The watermelon feta salad is fresh af and customer service is always on point.
Karla S.,"Los Alamitos, CA",165,23,7,1.0,3/30/2015,I just finished throwing up one of the most disgusting meals EVER. I went for a broccoli cheddar soup that tasted like straight nacho cheese. Sent that garbage back and went for the clam chowder which I shouldn't have. It tasted better than the nacho cheese soup but not even 15 minutes later after leaving it upset my stomach to the point of barfing! I've never visited a Bj's with such horrible tasting food. Whoever is in charge of preparing the soups needs to taste them before serving it to guest. And check that they're not expired... Baffled!
Sharkbait T.,"Riverside, CA",0,12,,2.0,4/19/2014,"Had a pretty bad experience the last time we went. First, I ordered a mini pizza lunch special, with wedge fries, and my wife ordered a chicken sandwich with the wedge fries. After about 10 minutes, I receive my pizza, and my wife receives her soggy sandwich. She ended up with the shoe string fries, and I had no fries. We told the server right then that we were missing my fries, and that my wife's fries were wrong. They brought out one plate of wedge fries, and we literally never saw or heard from a server again until I had to stop one and ask for our check. My beer was gone shortly after my food arrived, along with my wife's soda, and they never offered or brought refills. After requesting the check, a different person came and dropped off the wrong check. We got our correct check and left as fast as we could.  Overall, not impressed. If you are too busy to give customers the attention they deserve, then hire additional staff."
Candise H.,"Riverside, CA",17,57,30,1.0,6/28/2015,"This is not a REAL BJ's!!!! Don't be fucking fooled cuz half the menu is NOT available. DON'T come here if your favorite appetizers is what you're looking for. WTF, wait 45+ mins for table, just to be seated & discover NOTHING I was expecting to order available here. N.E.V.E.R. will I return or spend a freaken penny in the sorry ass excuse-FAKE ass BJ's."
Matthew R.,"Whittier, CA",0,17,,5.0,3/22/2015,This Bj's is the best Blake helped me and truly believe he deserves a raise will come again ...
Sharon H.,"La Cañada Flintridge, CA",251,4,1,1.0,3/21/2016,"If you think you know BJ's and love BJ's DON'T go to this location! My friend and I stopped by for a quick lunch, and I expected to have the same service and quality of food I usually receive. Unfortunately, I had the WORST service I have ever had at a BJ's. Our waiter Jacob continually threw our plates and cups on the table, making a considerable noise each time. My friend and I kept eating our food and hoped the service would get better, but it continually got worse. After taking away my plate, he comes back to our table to show us a ""magic trick."" First of all, we were still eating and he was disturbing our meal, and second, he dragged this game on for about five minutes. I became extremely irritated at this point and wanted to leave. We received our check and were ready to head out when a different waiter comes by and tells us that he gave us the wrong check. ARE YOU KIDDING? He claims to have caught us in time and he claimed to have cancelled the wrong check. Well, it turns out that they didn't cancel the wrong check and my bank statement now has two charges on it. This is the worst service I have ever received in a restaurant and will never be coming back to this location."
Reese F.,"San Diego, CA",88,66,5,1.0,9/24/2013,"Dear Lord. I shouldn't have ignored the previous reviews. I am a frequent at BJ's, especially the ones in Carlsbad and La Mesa and have always received EXCEPTIONAL service. While we stopped in Laguna, on a Sunday evening, we wanted to go somewhere to watch the game. Although the previous reviews held giant red flag warnings, we went here anyway because BJ's was the only place around showing the game.  First, they tried sitting my party of three at a two person table. Three full grown adults at a two person table? No no no no. No.  Second, the one TV they had there was playing Family Guy. FAMILY GUY during Sunday Night Football. We had to ask three different people to change the channel for us. After a half an hour, they were able to figure out how to change the channel and find the game.  Third, after waiting 30 minutes to order, we finally put our orders in. Randomly, one person got their food ten minutes later, but me and my boyfriend had to wait 45 minutes for our plates. Since we both ordered sandwiches, I really cannot figure out why it took so long!!  Fourth, by the time we got our food, we weren't even hungry anymore due to the lack of service and being filled up on soda. I politely asked our waitress for two sides of ranch. Ten minutes pass and nothing. We could tell she was busy so we flagged down another waiter and asked him for the two sides. He ROLLED HIS EYES. Two minutes later, he slammed the ranch on the table and sarcastically said ""One..."" My boyfriend politely said, ""We need a second one."" The waiter snapped back and said ""I KNOW."" He turned away, grabbed the second little bowl and slid it onto our table saying, sarcastically, ""Two...""  At this point, I LOST it. Before I ripped this guy's head off, I went to the ice cold bathroom. On my way back, I grabbed our waitress and told her we really needed to speak to the manager. I told her it had nothing really to do with her; honestly she was a gem. So, after giving her side of the story to the manager, he came and sat down at our table, listened to our complaints, comped our meal, replaced our entire order and even threw in two pazookies, all to go.  While I believe the manager did EVERYTHING in his power to make us happy, I know for a fact we will never come to this BJ's ever again."
Rho L.,"Chino Hills, CA",4015,1071,1568,3.0,8/30/2011,"In general, BJ's comes across as a so-so restaurant, great place for meeting friends because of the atmosphere and large menu, but other than that, I usually don't fulfil my hunger here. We took the kids out to the beach for the day and the first thing that crossed my mind was where I would be eating. I love trying out little hole in the wall cafes that the locals favor.  Unfortunately, this time at least, one of the kids was insistent on going to BJ's because of their mac and cheese.  This particualr BJ's is teeny, with a very limited menu fitting its small size. There was absolutely nothing that grabbed my attention so we just group ordered a great white pizza, nachos, fried artichokes, with mac and cheese and sliders for the kids. The nachos were a big letdown. I'm not sure how that ever happens cause c'mon it's nachos. Pizza was dry and uninteresting. The fried artichokes were, well fried and that were definitely edible. the mac and cheese was probably the better item off our entire order. To sum it up, BJ's isn't bad for a quick mediocre bite, but had I the option, I would've gone to a hundred other places first."
Courtney L.,"Dana Point, CA",3,100,10,4.0,7/8/2015,Excellent location in the heart of town :) Fun to take the local trolley into town for a nice day trip. Came in for a pizza with my brother on a Sunday and must have came at the perfect time as they were not too too busy yet and we got seated along the window right away. As far as the service no real complaints other then it took awhile and a few reminders to get small things like a refill or a cup of ice. May be a big deal to some but not a big thing for me :) Have always loved their pizza and will be back !!
Alyse N.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,2,,5.0,8/29/2015,"Food was ok. Service was fine. However the manager nick was exceptional. Very hospitable, was attanetive to all the needs of guests as well as his employees. He was constantly visible and came and checked on us to make sure we were having a wonderful night. I have never felt so taken care of by management. You need more people like him."
RC P.,"Los Angeles, CA",34,27,4,3.0,5/18/2014,"ONLY 1 TV in the whole place!! VERY VERY SMALL!! Now for the actual review: 3.5 Stars My cousin & I were in Laguna to chill at the beach. Then lunch came around & we wanted to watch the Heat vs. Pacers playoff game. BJs seemed like the logical choice.  We arrived and they had only 3 tables free. We were seated right away in front of the only TV.  By this time I had noticed the Yelp reviews so I decided to pay attention to all facets of the restaurant. We ordered Mahi Mahi tacos and a deep dish pizza & started watching the game.  We got our food 14 minutes and 34 seconds later. I call that fast. We both enjoyed our food and thought it was good. Not the best BJs but still really good. Michael was our server and provided us great service!! The other servers seemed very friendly and professional as well.  We give this place 3.5 stars: 1 star off for the very small location & not the quality sports bar atmosphere we're used to at other BJs. 0.5 stars off for only 1 TV: seriously there's plenty of wall space to add a few more! I could see how others can give this place a low rating if it is packed and the line to be seated is long. But I put that on a poor size of the facility, which is hard to change."
Sukhraj B.,"Orange, CA",1723,1189,1870,2.0,6/26/2013,"I'm not sure how this spot continues to exist. I've been a few different times and each time has been considerably worst than the last.  My first visit was with friends. We were shopping locally, checking out the scene, and finally stopped here for dinner before heading back to reality. The wait was long but we were assured it would move quickly so we decided to hang out. As we waited, we noticed people walk up and be seated. Did they have reservations? No. After about the 3rd time of witnessing this, we finally said something and were told they were here before us and our turn would soon come. After another 10 minutes or so of this B.S., we finally tracked down a manager who seated us, apologized, and comped the meal.  On other occasions, the service has been extremely slow or orders have been forgotten. This is a tiny spot. There isn't much room to get around and it gets really crowded in there. No sure what they were thinking with that concept. Also, they don't have a complete menu like other chains and the food usually isn't prepared right.  I suggest they just take this down and replace it with something else."
Greg M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",20,7,1,1.0,6/22/2013,"Went here because my girlfriend loves BJ's me not such a big fan, but did the right thing and went on a crowdedbafternoon,  I'll cut to the chase... service not good maybe a 5 on a 1 to 10 but here's the kicker!  3rd piece of pizza in I find a 2 inch long curly black hair : P  So I stop eating, pay the bill (my girl wanted to make a scene but I wanted to just talk to the manager on my way out)    So I get the Manager John Whittaker tell him my incident, the first thing out of his mouth... Oh my cooks all have short hair, almost shaved!  almost looking a me like it was my doing!  Well John why would I pay the bill THEN tell you if I was looking to get a free meal?!?  He had a perfect opportunity to make a lifelong customer by just apologizing, but instead I and my girlfriend will NEVER eat at BJ's again."
Geoff S.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",21,96,10,4.0,6/18/2013,"As you can see from other reviews on here, this restaurant is small. (Most restaurants in that area of Laguna Beach are small too.) There's only one TV in there so there's only one thing to watch. I'm happy with whatever they have on since it's always either the biggest game being played or ESPN.  I've only been here at night when it's been slow at about 9:30 or 10 PM. I've always had prompt service. I always get pizza and sometimes a salad too. The salad is always served well before the pizza, which is important to me. The refills on drinks are usually fast too which is also very important to me."
Isiah R.,"Southwest, Denver, CO",35,5,2,5.0,6/6/2015,"Let me start out by saying yum! So the story begins with a simple right swipe on tinder, and a girl that decided to stand me up... Oh well, I decided to have a pizza party for one. Ellis, a young man who gave up a lucrative modeling career to slang pizzas with best of them, was god's gift to my evening. Side note: he's a freelance magician in his free time so I never knew what to expect. Anyways I'm rambling, so to wrap this up the food was life changing as was the service."
Kevin H.,"Woodland Hills, CA",154,46,,1.0,8/12/2013,"I always love BJ's (but this location bites). In general the dip dish pizza style is very unique and completely worth the trip to most any location. Their own brewed beers are also very good and can satisfy any style of thirst.  This location however I hate because of the size and service. It is smaller than every other BJ's I have ever been to and gets insanely noisy and dirty. The service I had was also utterly horrible in every way. I had to wait over half an hour for a table for two (at lunch), then we had to wait almost another half hour to actually meet our waiter. It then took another 20 minutes to get our drinks, and almost another half hour to get our food. All in all we spent two hours for a single pizza for lunch.  Don't come to this location."
