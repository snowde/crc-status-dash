Nijole T.,"Los Angeles, CA",3080,6372,5149,4.0,1/5/2018,"I really have to give them credit for the amazing customer service and update my review to a much better experience. Their take out is a perfect option for those nights when you don't want to cook at home. We really enjoyed their deep dish pizza, the crust is fantastic and I loved that they have unique toppings such as brussel sprouts and asparagus. The exceptional service really sets them apart from other chain restaurants."
Sayna V.,"Houston, TX",3,2,3,1.0,1/6/2018,"It was the worst service I've ever got my entire life! The server was super rude and unprofessional  My family and I went there Monday night 1/1/18 and we ordered pizza,burger and soup  First we waited so long for our food to get to our table,then all of our foods were cold and when we mentioned it to the waiter he was super rude with attitude and  said"" what do you want me to do"" Im not going there anymore just because of this experience couldn't get any worse! We watch him talking and laughing with other serves and not doing his job but we decide just to enjoy our family time and not ruin it more than he did with the cold foods and bad service so we just ignored him and write down some notes for the manager on the bill!"
Aron N.,"Honolulu, HI",36,246,528,3.0,12/24/2017,"BJ's is one of those places that seems like they might brew beer but in reality they don't. Or at least they didn't the last time I asked. They have a nice selection of draft beers and truth be told - the food is decent if not good, but it's the kind of the place the more you drink the better the food tastes. Finally when you have drank enough - the food is pretty killer at that moment! hahaha! Well, it's your typical, good drinks, decent food, good service kind of place. The type you might want to hang out every week and enjoy the pitchers!!!"
Kayla C.,"Mission Viejo, CA",149,77,115,2.0,10/25/2017,"Come here on a somewhat regular basis and we always sit in the bar as it is first come first serve. It can get pretty crowded so sometimes you have to wait a little bit. The servers are always extremely friendly and helpful but so so slow. They don't check on you often and it seems like they are extremely overworked and juggling too many tables at a time. While like I stated they are all very great, the slow service usually causes you to overlook that aspect.  I love their berry cider and wish they sold it in cans like they do with a lot of their beer! All of their house beers are also really good. Their pizookies are amazing and a must when you go there. Other than that, their food is somewhat pricey and nothing special especially for the price."
Grace L.,"Orange County, CA",914,489,2132,5.0,8/23/2017,"Easily my favorite spot after 9pm because it's one of the few places that still open in this area!!! Be prepared. As you enter this place after 9pm, it feels like there is a party especially around 10pm when all their  Late HAPPY hour deals start. Previously, I did not like how slow they were. They gotten better. Servers carry a new app phone to take orders. Beers and food have arriver sooner! Easy and quick to ask for your bill! Oh and they have a new app! A must download because there's a lot of great deals! One time we got a steak, buy one get one free entree! And free pizzokies!!!! Tuesday is for the sweet lovers. 3 bucks pizzokies all day!!! Oh yeaaa!!!! Their beers are great. I love their Tatonka. It's a dark stout. Not so hoppy. It is smooth and has nitro! Enjoy! This has been the spot to be when everything is close in this area!"
Anthony N.,"Irvine, CA",1,45,22,4.0,1/8/2018,One thing you can't ignore at this location is the friendly and amazing service all the time every time.  The restaurant is clean and inviting.  The food comes out in a timely manner and always at the proper temperature.  Just an overall great atmosphere for young families but it can get pretty loud after 9pm when all the happy hour specials hit.
Joshua W.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",0,2,1,5.0,1/10/2018,I came during the dinner rush. To pick up my curbside order. I was thoroughly impressed by the manager on duty. (weds evening) for a wonderful customer service experience I will refer everyone to here. I'm never disappointed. Thanks bjs
Luna C.,"Irvine, CA",26,27,44,2.0,12/21/2017,"Summary: while the decor and place was clean and beautiful, the wait, service, and food was not up to par.  It was about 10pm on Tuesday night when me and my friends arrived to BJs. There was about 30 people eating inside at the time when we came. When we all sat down and made up our minds on what we were going to eat, the waiter was no where to be found for about ten minutes. Once our order was placed it took 25 minutes to come out. I ordered the hottest chicken wings and when I took a bite I could not detect a hint of heat, not even exaggerating. I had a feeling this would be the case so I asked the waiter before hand to bring extra hot sauce for the chicken wings. The skin of the chicken was soggy and after I finished the whole plate, it left me and my stomach with a gross feeling. The waiter never checked up on us once and the check came 20 minutes after we were all done eating. We ended up staying at BJs for 2 hours, not because we were slow eaters but because of the slow service. Thank you but no thank you."
Jenny L.,"Mission Viejo, CA",39,15,7,5.0,1/8/2018,"Me and my friends came here for dinner yesterday. It seemed to be busy at that time but we immediately got the table. Our waiter was friendly and professional. We got our drinks pretty fast. We didn't wait too long for a food. For appetizers we ordered Avocado eggs rolls, it was delicious! For myself I ordered  Shrimp scampi pasta and my friends got pizza. Everything was very tasty. We would definitely come here again!"
Charlene L.,"Capistrano Beach, CA",166,91,321,3.0,7/28/2017,"Starving so we decided to try BJ's.  I've been their many times with ok food and ok service.  My stomach over rode my brain.  Very nice hostesses greet you as soon as you walk in. That was very pleasant and a good way to start. They tried to seat us and we decided to sit at the bar.  Are bartender was Hannah and she was a smiling & a friendly bartender. Again another good sign, no red flags yet. Here we go We both ordered soup, chicken tortilla and cheese and broccoli. My cheese and broccoli was cold they sprinkle cheese on top which wasn't melted and it kind of had a a gritty texture and the  tasted like it  came from the freezer.  The chicken tortillas soup was also cold with stale chips on top and it was crazy spicy. Didn't taste like a chicken tortilla soup to me nor my friend.  The last time I ordered a BJ's pizza it had no sauce or  cheese. I asked the bartender to add more cheese and sauce to hopefully get a real pizza. After paying three dollars to get more cheese and sauce it actually was OK. It's sad that I have to order extras to make a decent pizza there. My pizza turned out to cost me $19 for a small pizza. That's crazy! I ordered the dry rubbed wings with a Suraci rub and those were really good probably one of the best things I've ever eaten there. During happy hour they take two dollars off of appetizers so that was kind of nice. My friend ordered the ultimate burger and it was huge and the flavor it was just OK. All in all the food was edible. I gave the extra star for Hannah are bartender. She was very pleasant.  Thank you Hannah do you"
Patty A R.,"Mission Viejo, CA",426,276,348,4.0,9/14/2017,Good experience mostly. Had to wait on refill of water more than ice is my only complaint. Had the quinoa dish with shrimp and it was pretty darn good. The chocolate chip gluten free pazookie was a nice dessert option! Parking is tricky here and there is always a wait. People that work here are friendly though. Portions are big so if you're not sharing you're probably taken food home. One more suggestion: turn up the lights! Can hardly see menu without my phone flashlight
Davina B.,"Santa Ana, CA",411,84,33,3.0,11/18/2017,"I gave 3 stars bc the food was good, but poor service by Simona, Sat afternoon.  1) I waited a very long time until she finally came to my table after I asked another employee in the bar area, who my server was. I actually got my own menu since it was taking so long.  2) I wasn't given silverware until AFTER my food was served. 3) My water glass was empty for a while. She said she'd come back with some, and never did. After quite some time another server refilled my water glass. 4) After I finished my meal, I moved it to the 2 top beside me with a napkin on top of my plate, waiting for my server to drop the check. Once again, waiting for awhile until she came by, maybe 10 min, I asked her for it. She was extremely slow and/or unaware of her lack of being proactive, serving...her job..."
Chi P.,"Orange County, CA",65,213,1106,3.0,4/1/2017,"Yelp 100 Challenge 2017 41/100 Couldn't decide on a place for lunch with the family so we ended up here, mainly for the pizookie dessert. The food isn't as good at this location as the one in Cerritos. My niece said the bacon burger was meh and she didn't finish it. She's usually not too picky about her burgers. The onion strings took forever and were soggy instead of crisp. The chicken tortilla soup was salty. I liked the stuffed mushrooms but my shrimp asparagus penne was just okay. The cookie in the pizookie wasn't good like usual. Felt like something was missing and it wasn't hot enough. It tasted like an old cookie reheated more than once. I rarely come here but my family does often and the sister said the food is usually better here. Our waiter also seemed unhappy to be at work and we had to ask for things like plates and water refills multiple times. The empty dishes kept piling up too."
Jimbo T.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",5,162,3,4.0,11/9/2017,Sat at the bar.  Came in for late food and cocktails.  Good service.  My wife didn't care for her drink and they removed it from the bill.  She picked something different and all was good. Food was delicious.  Very nice visit.  Thank you!
Erica D.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",106,78,316,3.0,3/26/2017,"We went for the first time two weeks ago. Since we had a great experience the kids wanted to go back yesterday. It was like two different restaurants. The first time we walked in we were kindly greeted, yesterday when we walked in the hostess just stared at us. I said hello, she said nothing.  Even though the restaurant wasn't busy, we were seated directly in front of the service doors. Our waiter seemed annoyed that we needed more time to look over the vast menu.  My daughters bacon cheeseburger came out with NO bacon or cheese. My husbands Black & Blue burger was a horrible mess. It was so soggy he had to eat it with a fork. I think we'll only be going back for dessert."
Teri C.,"FOOTHILL RNCH, CA",29,87,51,3.0,10/11/2017,Service 2 Food 3 ( cold because of the wait). Flavor 4 Came for lunch. Great lunch specials. Wasn't super busy. Ordered drinks...took forever to get.  Ordered food...took 45 minutes. Repeating the order I had To correct him twice. We could see our waiter at another table having a long conversation. He went back and forth many time but no food. We ended up ordering more drinks from the bartender.  Food was cold.. but we ate it anyways.  The last two times was a great time. But this time the server wasn't great.
T W.,"Laguna Hills, CA",0,47,14,2.0,1/9/2018,Food excellent when you finally get it. Service not so much. Worst bar waitress ever. She sucked. Even before it got busy. Took her forever to bring menus and our drinks.
D C.,"San Clemente, CA",15,128,45,1.0,10/19/2017,"Oh man I haven't seen this much disorganized restaurant in a long time getting orders. Were there business lunch with few of my colleagues. First had to order salsa few times with the chips and it was given to the wrong person. Then when my food came it was short of two items that I clearly order. Good thing there was a manager that took care the issue.  We had to wave our hands to just to refill the soda.  I understand that it was a lunch out and they were busy but that's not a excuse for getting the Oder short or wrong and it's just not me- few of our people didn't get all the items they order. And if you short handed, you can always hire people right? Lot of people looking for jobs these days."
Sk H.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",1,31,14,4.0,11/5/2017,"A good spot to go to for dinner on Friday and weekend dinners as wait isn't very long. For 3 about 15 min and 6  people about 20-30min wait, which is much shorter compared to other restaurants. Love Bj's deep dish pizza and cocktails!  Only problem I've had that 1-2x my order came out wrong ie no tomatoes chunks in the pizza or the wrong type of wings .  Not too much of a big deal.  They do take it back if not done right.  Wish they would offer a free dessert or take off the appetizer for making the mistake though.  Servers and hosts are kind and friendly. Never had a problem with service."
Casie S.,"Lake Forest, CA",6,14,6,3.0,8/24/2017,"3 stars because I do enjoy the food when it's made correctly and of course those pizookies are pretttty good! But based on my visits the service is usually sub par. One time took me flagging down 3 different employees to be greeted and ended with a manager taking my order  no one knew who my server was supposed to be. I placed a togo order tonight hoping I could skip the service and even though they use these fancy stickers with my name and entree and special instructions printed right there - still was incorrect. The food keeps me coming back,but its togo's from here on out for me and I will always check my order :)"
R M.,"El Toro, CA",0,8,2,3.0,8/19/2017,I have always liked BJs but I think the food quality has gone down in the years. Tonight I ordered a salad forgetting to say dressing on the side. BIG MISTAKE. It was like soup. Does anyone like their salad drowning in dressing? It's hard to really judge the taste since it was overwhelmed by sweet honey mustard dressing. Half of it was inedible. I was offered something more lettuce (but it couldn't be fixed) or something else from the kitchen. The servers (bartenders since I sat in the bar) are great. I just ordered a Pizookie- I guess since I couldn't eat my dinner I saved room for dessert.
Steve C.,"Lake Forest, CA",93,45,67,4.0,10/20/2017,"Good selection of craft beers and other drinks at the bar. The pizza is okay but the burgers are great! Place is always packed so you might want to get a reservation if there are more than a couple of folks. Also, get ready to raise your voice if you are in the bar area. Loud doesn't come close! Still A lot of fun."
Jim T.,"Laguna Hills, CA",578,621,132,2.0,10/7/2017,"The service isn't up to par. Server spilt an ice tea on my son, apologized then said he'd replace the ice tea. He never came back. The waitress brought another ice tea after being reminded. Clearly ordered sweet potato fries but they brought out regular fries. Asked them to replace them and they brought it out just as lunch was finished. They use a tag team method I am seeing in other restaurants and it results in mistakes and disorganization. They hand out an insert at lunch for prime rib but it doesn't say after 4pm. Terrible training and lousy procedures. Points to bad management. Prime rib French dip sandwich was excellent though. Also, we told them it was my granddaughters' birthday and they did nothing about it."
Sleepy A.,"Cypress, CA",0,14,4,3.0,11/4/2017,"Friendly and knowledgeable servers, but the floor was so greasy that we were actually slipping and sliding as we walked to our table and when we went to the ladies room around 11pm, we tried three different stalls-none of which had toilet paper.  We finally took some new toilet paper rolls out of the little storage closet ourselves"
Lynn W.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",0,6,3,4.0,12/16/2017,"Came in on a Saturday night. Got seated within 15 minutes. Our server, Sean, was polite and attentive. The manager also came by to check on us. It was great!  Definitely recommend it."
Jeff K.,"San Clemente, CA",472,246,619,3.0,8/25/2017,"Not a fan of the massive corporate feel! I had my first BJs pizza on my 16th birthday at the Santa Ana location (no longer there). That was 37 years ago.. eeek. I was a huge fan then and BJs was what I compared all pizza to for many years. It's still good, but their menu has expanded exponentially losing focus on what mattered. The beer on the other hand is as important as the pizza of course! They've done a pretty good job on their Jeremiah Red, but that's about as dark as they go. I'm more of a porter fan. I wish they would make a porter instead of following this weeks IPA trend. LOCATION & AMBIANCE (Rating 3.5) The location is huge and well done, although there is nowhere for the throngs of people waiting to be seated to hang out comfortably. The bar area is seated like normal tables so don't expect seating there either. Usually, the wait is not long though because it's a huge establishment. SERVICE (Rating 2) It's not often we get good service here. They are just too big and too busy. I constantly have to flag waiters down as they scurry by helping the other thousand people there. PIZZA (Rating 3.5) I usually get the ""Sweet Pig"". It's great and I like the thick crust. While their pizzas are called ""Chicago style"", they're not. I've been there and enjoyed what ""Chicago Style"" really is and they missed it. But that doesn't matter because BJs was one of the first on the west coast to introduce their own style based on an interpretation of Chicago Style and they did a great job. I just wish they were more consistent these days. Sometimes they are a bit undercooked, sometimes a bit soupy and others just right. They are overwhelmed with business and with a menu almost the size of Cheesecake factory, staying focused is pratcially impossible IMO. PiZZOKIE (Rating 5.5) It's not often I'll give more than 5 stars, but it's my rating system and I'll do what I want! This thing is bliss! I order the ""Black and White"". It's a combo (half and half) of their ""chocolate chunk"" and their ""white chocolate macadamia nut"" WAY TO GOOD!"
D. C.,"Irvine, CA",0,8,,2.0,12/17/2017,"I ordered ahead online for pick up.  It took me 30 minutes to get to the restaurant and ended up waiting another 15 minutes for my order.  When I got home, the food looked like it was cooked and prepared for pick up in 10 minutes.  Half of my pizza had most of the pepperoni slices on them with some of the slices not separated.  Can you picture this...  1 slice of pizza had stacks of pepperoni, some of which was not separated.  The rest of the pizza had portions with little to no ingredients.  The restaurant was busy but that does not excuse them from cutting corners by ignoring quality over quantity.  I am giving an extra star simply because the host at the counter was very attentive to the needs of the customers including me."
Bill V.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",10,69,61,1.0,10/1/2017,"I hate to leave this review because I know how hard people are on restaurants but honestly they deserve this one because we just ordered $70 worth of dinner for three people which is an insane amount of money for the quality of the food we just tried to consume. My wife got the salmon and said hers was just OK, my daughter got the Parmesan chicken which seems as good as you get a Denny's and I got a steak and potato of which was cold and the potato was like rubber. It  must have been sitting out for hours on end. Complete junk food that is wayyyy overpriced"
Jeff M.,"Mission Viejo, CA",69,37,6,2.0,10/1/2017,"So I guess the pizza is supposed to be deep dish, Chicago style? Well, Chicago style deep dish is not like this. There was little, if any sauce on our pizza. It was mostly dough. Not impressed at all.  The wings were excellent. Nice flavor along with big and meaty. I give the wings 5 stars. The avocado egg rolls were good too. Not awesome but good.  So, overall I would give this place three stars, but the cost is what makes it 2. $6.25 for a pint of beer? That's ridiculous. We ordered two pizzas, four beers, two cocktails and some apps and our bill, with tip was over $200. That's way too expensive for pizza, beer and wings."
Persila N.,"Irvine, CA",670,396,594,4.0,3/17/2017,"Came here to grab lunch with a large group and they were able to accommodate us easily.  Got a mini Great white pizza and split avocado egg rolls between myself and two others.  I ended my meal with a mini pizookie (classic, chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream scoop on top).  My only real complaint is about the server.  He didn't fill up our water cups one time, until we complained and he handed us a whole pitcher on our table to serve ourselves.  He was kind of dismissive and didn't want to tend to our requests.  In the end, he made up for it by splitting the check several ways which was nice of him.  Although the food was good, I would hope to receive better service next time.  You can never really go wrong with ending your meal with a pizookie either!"
Kelly W.,"Los Angeles, CA",471,642,695,4.0,10/4/2016,"This is a nice location that I've been to a few times before. My friends and I got together for dinner Sunday night and it was pretty busy. I think a lot of people were here watching football.  We got an array of dishes ranging from pizza, pasta and steak. With the exception of one person we all really enjoyed our dishes. They are pretty consistent at all of their locations and I really like that. You always know that you're going to get a good meal.  The highlight of course to any trip to BJs is their pizookies. My favorite is the peanut butter one. I also have a rewards card with them so I earn points towards free meals in the future. The service here was great. We never had to wait for anything. Will definitely be back here again!!!"
Mai T.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,64,1,2.0,9/16/2017,"Came here yesterday. My pizza was cold when it came out. It took over 30 min for the food to come out. I think it's because they waited for my boyfriends food to be done. By that time, pizza was cold. After I told them about the cold pizza, they offered free desert which also took a long time for it to come out.  Pizza isn't as great as I remembered it before. Very sad."
Jane R.,"Mission Viejo, CA",42,109,257,3.0,9/6/2016,"It is what it is- a typical chain restaurant/bar but at least they stay open till Midnight unlike most of the places near to Mission Viejo that close at 9 or 10!  Popped in for a couple of drinks last night and a portion of Chicken Wings. The Wings were ok, I don't think they should be drizzled in the white (ranch?!) sauce it looks ugly and makes them soggy. Speaking of the white sauce, if it's Blue Cheese it doesn't taste that way  Our server was helpful and attentive but also the place was mainly empty as it was already 10pm  A reasonable selection of craft beers but of course the one we wanted (displayed on the chalk board) wasn't available .. They should probably remove it, will take 20 seconds!"
Todd R.,"Lake Forest, CA",22,200,280,3.0,2/24/2017,"Took someone out for their birthday, they wanted to go to BJ's. Cool. A slew of food from Jambalaya, Pepperoni extreme pizza, Potato skins and a BJ's Brewhouse Burger came on out with a pizooki afterwards. So full... The things worth mentioning was that the kitchen loves Salt... They were probably watching Salt when they Salted the food. Even the pepperoni was very Salty. A request for less Salt on the jambalaya was put in, nope. Salt...  I think what I'm saying here is, the food was very Salty. I did enjoy the Firehouse 805 beer though. That wasn't Salty..."
Julie P.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",253,106,78,4.0,8/18/2017,"This location of BJ's often has the same service related issues, but the food is good and they always pull through in the end. They unfortunately leave trash and plates on the table between courses which is disappointing but the host was friendly, they were responsive to requests and the food came out quickly."
Sarah A.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,5,3,1.0,12/24/2017,"If you like hair in your salad this is the place to come, if also like frozen meatballs you can also come here this is the worse experience I had first of all they told us 15 min. Wait then it went up to 45 min we ordered salad and a meatball and the meatball was frozen and the the was big long hair in the salad!! And the manager his name was Evan has the guts to say can we offer you another salad or a soup . We will never go head again"
Faz N.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",9,21,3,2.0,1/27/2017,"I ordered a chicken club sandwich through DoorDash and it was disgusting. The bread was fortified in oil and grease, they didn't bother including my avocado in it and the fries were soggy string fries. I ended up throwing it away and when calling to speak with management, they just directed me in DoorDash's way.  Talk about deflecting responsibility. Regardless of the medium I purchased it through, they need to take responsibility for poor food. The management seemed disinterested in having genuine feedback. Work on customer care. There are a plethora of places to eat on a Friday night, so now you've given me even more reason to avoid BJ's and eschew disappointment. It's a shame because I have always like BJ's food in the past, but just felt the indifference toward my experience fell extremely short of expectations."
D K.,"Lake Forest, CA",0,58,65,4.0,8/30/2017,"My son and I came today to enjoy nice dinner and our server Jason was hilarious, great change in service! Very attentive and funny. Made our dinner exceptional!!  Update 8/30/17 ordered the 1/2 baby back ribs with mask potatoes and it was horrible! Ribs and mash soo dry disappointed!!!"
Elvia J.,"Riverside, CA",152,9,1,5.0,11/6/2017,"Came here for the Monday deal which is 1/2 off a large pizza ended up getting the avocado egg rolls and Oreo Poozokie (sp?)  Everything was BOMB dot com. Our waiter Trevor was very attentive we did t have to ask for anything because he was on it even though the restaurant was pretty busy. Peter the manager, is great at addressing any concerns. Will definitely be coming back!"
Tara P.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,9,1,2.0,11/11/2017,"After multiple bad experiences this will be my last visit here. The last 3 times my food has been luke warm at best. The service is unbelievably slow EVERY time. Waited 30 minutes for my entree today, it was cold when it came out, had to wait another 20 minutes for a replacement, which I was charged for. Ordered pizookie--not cooked AT ALL in the middle. Like completely cold batter straight from the fridge. For how the food is priced, you think it would be better."
