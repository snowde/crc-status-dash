Mick C.,"Santa Ana, CA",18,15,3,1.0,2/13/2016,"What a disaster... We called in 20 minutes ahead of time to secure a table in anticipation that we would be very hungry by the time we got there. They let us know when we arrived that it would be a 20-25 minute wait. So we waited and plenty of large parties were seated in that time; 35 minutes go by and finally someone comes to tell us that they messed up our party size and that we would be seated next...two more parties were called before us. When we do get to our table we wait another 15 minutes until we meet our server, we all order drinks and entrées and wait some more. 15 more minutes pass until we see our drinks and while the iced tea was decent, the ""craft soda"" was very flat. My wife who had ever-dipping blood sugar by this point was too hungry to send her food back, but the ""specialty entree"" balsamic chicken was too tough to cut properly with a knife and as rubbery as can be. While the burgers were also decent, I don't understand why there is a premium price for a healthier option that was half the quality of a burger. Service was mediocre. We will not be returning to this establishment."
Tom B.,"Saugus, MA",0,17,1,4.0,6/30/2016,"I can only speak from my own experience. I have never had a poor meal, at any time of day, at BJs. From time to time it's really crowded but we've learned to time it well. The crowding alone tells you something. The quality of the food and service is what makes it such a great restaurant, great restaurants have a tendency to be crowded. As Yogi said, "" It's so popular nobody goes there anymore""  It's a great menu at BJ's and it suits us very well. We're fortunate that we've never had to wait more than ten minutes."
Eddie J.,"Lake Forest, CA",104,2,,1.0,3/7/2016,"Customer service is very bad at night.... Employess take long to greet you or sit you down, our Waiter Cory R was just very rude and unpleasant just kept rolling his head, like thinking to himself hurry up and kept walking away when we were trying to order and when we asked about something just quick rude answers like we dont have that or just quick fast no, place also smells, when you see clean the tables they just toss the rag over the table and to wipes done... worse experience than when he came to ask how we are doing or dropping of check he just put it down and walked away and said something but so fast we couldnt evem understand what he said"
Rosemary T.,"Tustin, CA",533,677,2406,3.0,3/18/2012,"This is one of the largest BJ I've ever seen.  I love coming here for their dessert, but I honestly think their food can be better.   This is the first time I saw avocado roll on their menu so I decided to order it.  I'm very familiar with this item as its always one of my go to items when I eat at cheesecake factory.  And.... It sucked!  For whatever reason, the wrap they use to fry their avocado in is extremely hard, doughy and dry.  Also, the sauce they use to go with their roll does not complement each other at all.   I also ordered chicken wings, and I would have to tell you to go to buffalo wild wings if you want some good wings.  I think it's good, but not as good as buffalo.  The BEST PART of the meal is always the dessert, and this is the only place you can find pizzokie!!!!  I got the trios, which is a great way to try different type of flavors.  I got the red velvet, macadamia nuts and white chocolate, and Oreo and cookies.   OMG! It was to die for!!!!  I love it! Bottom lines, this is a great place to come for some beer and dessert.  But as for their usually dinner meal....  Not my kinda food."
Nancy P.,"Anaheim, CA",56,301,36,3.0,1/20/2015,"I love the avocado eggrolls here. I think BJ' s Avo Eggrolls are much better than cheesecake factory. I also, think their bbq beef sandwich and sweet pig deep dish are yummy. They make a refreshing hef that is absolutely delicious with 3 lemon wedges squeezed in."
Wizard N.,"Irvine, CA",30,4,3,1.0,5/12/2014,"I tried their Baby rib, it ruined my dinner. Tasteless !!!! And !!!! Dry like eating wood!!!"
Stephi S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",558,282,792,3.0,12/28/2013,"This BJ's is in a great location, next to the Laguna Hills Mall. An old friend and I came here for dinner on a Friday night. It was already busy, but we were able to get a table within a few minutes from arriving. The restaurant has a warm and inviting ambiance, but it is a little loud. I ordered the Balsamic Glazed Chicken and it was delicious. It was served on top of spring green lettuce, and had a side of mashed potatoes with fried onion shoestrings and a balsamic drizzle all over. Every bite was so flavorful. They do not offer bread, so we ordered some on the side. The server provided us with two small slices of the garlic bread they typically serve with pasta. Looking at the bill, they waived the charge, which was nice. Our server was ok, not genuinely friendly. He was not too attentive and we had to flag him down when we needed something.  I felt like he was not thrilled that my friend and I were spending a little extra time catching up. He was quick to set the bill down and walk away.   Overall - great food and location. We spent a little over $40 for two meals and two glasses of wine.  I think it was just a bad night for the server."
Marcel C.,"San Clemente, CA",100,19,7,5.0,9/28/2015,"Great service great drinks and food, definitely prefer this location over RSM Everytime that we've been in our service has been excellent, drinks tasted cold, tasty and right.  Food was hot a delicious Staff super friendly and smiley and helpful, this BJ's is doing it right!"
Fran C.,"Laguna Woods, CA",0,26,1,2.0,12/13/2016,Service is fair to poor depending when you go. Too many times the orders are cold incorrect or partly brought to table and waitpersons have to go back to kitchen. My last time there with a group was a nightmare. I won't go back and it's right near my house. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because a few times service in the bar section was okay.
Toni D.,"Paradise, CA",54,8,4,3.0,7/1/2016,"My family and I have been eating here for quite some time now with no problems and I can honestly say I'm very disappointed with the service today.  We came in and they sat us pretty quickly (which was nice) but then it slowly went down from there. Our waitress didn't even say hi or come by our table at all for almost 20 minutes. When she did come by she took our drink and food order. We all got water and it still took her almost and additional 15 minutes to get the drinks.  The food was brought out almost all at the same time; soup, salads, and entrees, even though we asked for it to be brought out separately.  When we asked our waitress for refills she completely forgot. She came by our table and at one point I'm pretty sure realized she forgot and didn't say anything to us. It wasn't until another waiter, Wes, came by and gave us our refills and apologized. Wes was very nice, helpful, and apologetic about something that totally wasn't his fault. Then it took a ridiculous amount of time to get the check. Barely saw our waitress at all.  I tried to have some understanding because, although it wasn't packed, it wasn't empty in there either. After a certain point though, when you pretty much ignore an entire table, it becomes ridiculous.  On the plus side, food always has and was amazing"
Jennifer B.,"Houston, TX",178,304,160,3.0,3/13/2014,"This BJs was a pleasant surprise. I had a great four course meal here yesterday. We started with cocktails. I had an excellent strawberry cocktail. It's featured about halfway done the cocktails page. We followed up with some wine. I had a glass of moscato and it was delicious! I recommend these drinks to all the girls drinkers out there. Next, we had an avocado wrap. I was surprised at how good this was! There was cheese with a little bit of kick in it. Well worth every bite.  The entree was bad. We had the mahi mahi tacos and chicken tacos. The meat was a little dry. The spices weren't anything to write home about. Last up was the pazukis. These are the BJ specialties. If you're a first timer, I recommend getting the trio so you can try different kinds. We got the triple chocolate (my long standing favorite), the white chocolate with macadamia nut, and the lightly salted caramel. The first to lived up to my expectations, but the last wasn't worth it. I wish they would bring back the red velvet!"
Susan L.,"San Francisco, CA",168,181,38,5.0,12/27/2015,Avocado Egg rolls were pretty fantastic. Great place to go with a large group. Service was pretty good. The wait was non existent. Will I be back? Yes.
Arash S.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",2,34,,5.0,6/4/2016,"Have the BJ's app and placed name on wait list and took about 10 minutes to be seated upon arriving which wasn't too bad.  Thought would have been quicker.  They have a great offer of 2 for 25 which includes soup for 2, medium deep dish pizza and pizookie but this expires on June 8th.  Not advertised so just ask for the deal.  Our waitress (aalie) was very friendly and attentive.  Had chili for appetizer and was amazing.  deep dish Hawaiian chicken pizza tastes very good but very filling.  Salted caramel pizookie finished me off and now I need to hit the gym for about a week to work off dinner."
Christine K.,"Orange County, CA",73,137,1071,4.0,4/22/2014,"My mother in law had the chicken salad and she kept saying that it was the best  she's ever had!  Frankly, I thought that's because she doesn't get out much.  As for the rest of our meal, Mahi salad, burger, fish & chip...were good.  No complain there, however it didn't stand out, not memorable like the chicken salad.  Good service.  Not my frequent hang out, maybe once or twice a year."
Elizabeth D.,"Lake Forest, CA",14,10,3,1.0,3/6/2015,"Today I went to lunch with a few of my coworkers and while the food was ok, the service did not meet expectations. We were seated fairly quickly, within 5 minutes and when the waitress came over to take our drink order, we were ready to place our actual food order.  My one friend got her side salad within the next few minutes however it took an additional 20 minutes for us to get the rest of the entrees delivered. I ordered the Thai Mango Chicken Salad.  The salad looked a little underdressed however there was a lime wedge on the plate so I used that.  I ate roughly half of the salad before the waitress returned to see how we were / if we needed anything, etc.  Upon her checking in, I asked for a side of dressing.  Once I got the dressing, I realized that there was nothing previously on that plate which matched that color or flavor - my salad wasn't previously underdressed, there was no dressing at all.  Now that I'm thinking of it, the salad didn't have chicken on it either.  There was plenty of lettuce, mango strips and avocado but I was so distracted by the lack of flavor, I didn't realize that chicken, a key ingredient, was not present... During the course of the service, we were never offered any refills and it took us maybe another 15 minutes (post dressing issue) before we could flag our waitress back down and get the bill.  The food did have flavor (when served as ordered) but post lunch rush, there's no reason for it to have taken 90 minutes to get one salad for myself, one baked potato / side salad for a co-worker and one burger / fries entree.   I would not recommend if you are limited on time.  There was no sense of urgency and there were plenty of empty tables, even directly in our section.  The service left something to be desired."
Sandy P.,"Orange County, CA",166,218,37,3.0,12/21/2014,"""Who's on First?   What's on Second?""  ""I don't know who's on third"" That about sums up the service today.   Came in after church about 12:00.   The restaurant seemed quiet with customers seated in various spots.   This is a big restaurant so we could only surmise that they were accommodating about ten servers by allocating customers per station.   OK,  we can play.........While being escorted to the patio our host stopped and said ""you can sit anywhere you want.  It's a free world""   so we sat..........apparently in the wrong area.   Waited about 10 minutes for someone to notice that we have been ignored and to stop and give us menus and take a drink order.  One minute later another server stopped to take our drink order.   Five minutes later yet another server stopped to tell us our drinks were about ready.   We went from zero to hero in about 8 minutes! Bloody Mary's were poor at best  Most likely this was because they were Brunch Specials for $4.00.   The lunch, however, was quite good.   I enjoyed the BBQ chicken salad and BF had the jalapeno burger.   Food was fresh and tasty with abundant portion sizes.    All in all a decent albeit comical experience."
Jenn C.,"Dana Point, CA",7,25,465,1.0,3/25/2015,"Why does this place smell like vomit? No joke, when you walk in the stench punches you in the face - I should have known and just left right then.  Ordered 2 salads, both came out and the dressing wasn't on the side like we specifically asked for. Brought to the servers attention and he got all fussy that he had to have the salads remade even though we made it very clear about dressing on the side. It's like, hide the fact that you're annoyed like a smart person instead of showing your frustration so your tip isn't compromised...duh! Get it together, BJ's. And FIX THAT SMELL!"
Soren I.,"La Mirada, CA",2,101,3,4.0,10/1/2015,"Went here for pizza and pizookies and was not disappointed. We were seated fairly quickly, although the server was not super attentive. However, the restaurant was very clean. If you want to have a conversation at dinner, this is not the place to go. It's very noisy. I had the chicken bacon ranch pizza and a cookies and cream pizookie. Both were very good and consistent with the taste of normal bjs. I would definitely go back here."
Shadi H.,"Livermore, CA",34,49,14,1.0,1/9/2016,Service is always horrible... Takes 20 min to place order and another 30 min to get the food. One thing that's always consistent is the horrible service.
Dennis B.,"San Francisco, CA",0,52,,1.0,10/21/2016,Nothing worse than having people who came in 20 mins after you get their food first.  No excuse.
