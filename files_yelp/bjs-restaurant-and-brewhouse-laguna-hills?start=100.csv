Jose B.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",0,3,,5.0,9/11/2017,"I love this place because everything is amazing. That services is great every time. The server Daniel M, He's the best server."
Amanda K.,"San Clemente, CA",91,68,6,4.0,1/31/2017,"A great BJs. Large, clean, and always serving up their usual favorites. The pzookie is a must!"
Mario D.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,37,4,2.0,5/3/2017,"Read the recent reviews. They are mostly poor. Think twice before going here.  The good:  Great pizza.  Generally nice people.  Decent grub.  Good beer.  The bad:  EVERY TIME,  THERE'S A WAIT EVEN WITH 30 OPEN TABLES. I'M SICK OF IT! The details: This BS method of making people wait forever in order to appear popular has to stop. They ARE already popular.  Why punish customers at 5:30 on a Wednesday?  TWENTY MINUTE wait for a table for ZERO REASON.  I CAN'T TAKE IT ANY MORE.  3 sets of people, as did my party just left after 15 minutes.  They had a ton of waitstaff. It's just an 'image' thing.  It's like it's a privilege for me to dump $75 on a frigging Wednesday for 3 people. Their bathroom was broken too. A sign said to go to the TIRE STORE if you had to go.  Again,  this has happened ONE TOO MANY TIMES.  After 15 years coming here with my family.  ADIOS BJ's. NEVER AGAIN."
Natalie F.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",0,3,,1.0,5/2/2017,"Local here. To be accurate,from Dana Point. I wanted to spend 2 minutes of my time and say.. HORRIBLE service! If I wasn't mistaken, it has to do with racism. Took 30 min to get TWO waters and talking to the Manager. Will be going to the location in Laguna Beach from now on."
Colin H.,"San Clemente, CA",409,53,3,2.0,3/5/2017,"The boyfriend and I came here for dinner. Our server was relatively friendly and greeted us almost immediately. We both asked for waters and ordered an app. The appetizer came before the waters did, probably because our server forgot. She made up the excuse that someone was suppose to bring them out, but I was watching her running her own drinks out all night. We got our waters after we finished the app and she left our appetizer plate on the table. Maybe she wanted it to collect dust idk but it was in the way. She didn't pay much attention to us to be honest, maybe because we are gay. But who knows. Our meals were great. Baked ziti and the brisket and bacon burger were so tasty and you have to get the monkey bread pizookie(idk how to spell it)! Anyways, two stars for the food. Three knocked off for the awful service."
Jacqueline B.,"Costa Mesa, CA",185,38,,5.0,4/3/2017,"I always have a good experience here. Also Kyle, one of the bartenders, is freaking cut and fun to look at."
Bailey B.,"Porterville, CA",0,3,,1.0,6/14/2017,"In my life, I have never experienced this level of awful service from any restaurant. The manager, Michelle and her staff were very unprofessional and extremely cruel with us. We asked about a discount that unknown to us, was expiring, and Michele looked at us like we had committed a crime for asking about it. She said to our family, ""You should've known better than that"" and continued to belittle and scold us for inquiring about it. Normally it takes a lot for me to feel offended by anything, as I am a pretty friendly and reasonably understanding person, but I have to admit, it was some of the worst treatment my family and I had ever received from another human being in general. We had given them our business and then treated like dirt in return. Honestly, it wasn't going to bother me either way whether we were able to receive the discount or not. I would have been just as happy to receive a normal response as simple as, unfortunately we are not able to honor that discount. It's a shame that they feel like they no longer need to be friendly to their customers anymore and at the minimum, treat them with simple human decency. No appreciation for what they have. It's very unfortunate, I hope people start to go someplace else, and that Michele and her staff are humbled some day by their terrible actions to all the good people that have gone there."
James K.,"Costa Mesa, CA",0,5,1,1.0,4/15/2017,"Ok this is the 5th time I have had horrible service, the servers always mess up our orders.  To top it off they put us near the kitchen where my 2 daughters had to listen to people cursing the whole time!!!"
Chantik R.,"Anaheim, CA",19,78,57,1.0,6/21/2016,"Came here yesterday around 2:30pm. We waited 15-20 min to be seated, not sure why because the place was only about 15% full. While waiting to be seated, about 6 employees were standing at the front just chatting- hanging out  doing nothing. So we finally get seated and the service was sooooooo slow!!! I was looking for our waitress to refill my water and I noticed she was in the bar area standing there watching tv chatting away with about 5 other employees .  I can understand slower service if the place was busy but it wasn't!! No one here seemed as if they were motivated to work!! The food was really good which is sad because I won't be back only because the service sucks!!"
Hasti P.,"Mission Viejo, CA",1,9,1,5.0,4/8/2017,"It has a delicious food. Also, the restaurant is really clean with great and friendly workers. The price of the food is a bit expensive, but I still love this restaurant..."
Karen H.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",0,1,,3.0,6/23/2017,We came here looking forward to happy hour and crafted beer. Unfortunately we got a waitress (blonde hair in a ponytail) for our waitress. She spent a lot of time (up to 5 minutes at a time) chatting with one table. The tables on either side of us were served before us and attended to regularly. We sat there with no drink refills while she talked endlessly with that one table returning many times to those two people. A manager never stop by as they have in the past. I was so happy to leave the restaurant. If you go there hopefully you won't get stuck with that waitress.
Greg D.,"Beverly Hills, Los Angeles, CA",113,32,3,5.0,7/31/2017,Thought that the food good and the service was excellent. Taylor was our server and she did a great job. I don't live in the area. Was visiting my parents. I can see why they like this place so much. Very good and reasonable!
Crystal P.,"San Clemente, CA",46,55,5,3.0,7/17/2017,"Review for TAKE OUT SERVICE only: First things first, we ordered the ribs and lemon thyme chicken and both were delicious! Even had a mini pizookie to go and it was excellent hours later. However, the to go service was AWFUL! When I called in the order I was told the food would be ready in 20-25minutes. However, it ended up taking 40minutes. All of this waiting while my two year old is complaining how hungry he is. Not fun. Supposedly what was taking so long was the baked potato. I'm really not sure why that would be the thing that would delay the order by an additional 15-20 minutes. When we finally got the food home there were no utensils included and no wet wipes included (these are generally included whenever ribs are ordered). It was just a sour experience regarding take out. It's set up to be super convenient and easy. Call the restaurant, place the order, drive to the restaurant, call the number on the sign at your parking spot, and have your food brought to you. Unfortunately, it was one of the least convenient experiences. I will not be ordering take out from there again."
Yana K.,"Mission Viejo, CA",90,5,,1.0,2/8/2017,"I have been meaning to call the manager but I have lost my voice for the past couple of days. I ate here around 10pm on Monday night with my co workers to celebrate my birthday. I ordered the shrimp and asparagus penne pasta, overall I give it a 7/10 but as I finished the dish I noticed the last piece of shrimp was uncooked.... I was hoping it was only that one and that I didn't eat one that was in that condition but 4 hours later I could not stop puking and I found myself with food poisoning. It took me out of work and school for over a day.  I will be calling the manager as soon as my voice is back."
Herman T.,"San Juan Capistrano, CA",0,2,3,5.0,3/20/2017,"I've been here twice in the last week and spent over $100 dollars each time, and each time they have forgotten to add my reward points. I came here in December and spent $130 and my reward points were not added as well. The workers always keep reassuring me that they will be added, but it only results in disappointment."
Sarah V.,"South Coast, CA",231,17,6,2.0,2/22/2017,"While I love the food at BJs, the service at this location has been terrible the past few times. This will be the last time we go to this location. Aside from overhearing their servers using profanity loudly, while complaining about guests and the hosts, we have also experienced having a server who completely ignored us after bringing our drinks to go hangout with her friends who were dining in the bar area and kept walking past us, completely ignoring us. We finally just left a 2.00$ tip for a Sprite and walked out after talking to the manager."
Janiza B.,"Orange, CA",4,63,54,1.0,7/7/2016,"What is it with south county and incompetent, lazy employees. Came with my family and was embarrassed at how long the wait was...yet the place was only 1/4 full. I got more and more upset at how all the employees were more concerned with socializing than doing their jobs. Won't ever return."
J A.,"Coto De Caza, CA",0,5,,2.0,8/14/2017,"We went here for the BJs beer dinner but we're extremely disappointed. The beer was ok (but the guy running the beer dinner was super stingy -- no seconds!). The food was ok. (Salmon over cooked, couscous weirdly seasoned etc).   The guy who was introducing the beers into the mic was super serious, not well informed on the beers or beer styles) and looked miserable - he didn't smile once. It made the experience less than satisfying. It was super disappointing. We won't be back."
Nicole N.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,4,1,5.0,1/30/2017,"My best friend and I went to BJ's to celebrate amazing news. We wanted to have a fun girls night and we did just that, thanks to our amazing waiter Octavio. Couldn't ask for better service. He definitely deserves to be recognized!"
SM J.,"Dana Point, CA",0,6,,1.0,11/19/2016,"Been here many times but recently the service and pizza was unacceptable.  We were there at 5:00 and ordered salads and a pizza.  50 minutes later, no food.  We spoke to our waiter and he said he'd check on it!  About 5 minutes later he came out with the salads;  the pizza followed quickly.  The pizza was barely warm and not thoroughly baked. A very disappointing evening!!!"
