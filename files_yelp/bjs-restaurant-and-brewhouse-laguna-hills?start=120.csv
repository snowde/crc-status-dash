Ash Z.,"Mission Viejo, CA",125,246,108,3.0,10/5/2015,This location always seems to be busy on Sundays. We didn't have to wait too long for our table tho. We got a few apps and meals and ended with a pizookie. I ordered the BJs favorite pizza and it was OK. My all time go to is always the tortilla soup!  They do have a deal running for two salads or soup and a medium pizza and dessert for 25.
Scott B.,"Ladera Ranch, CA",1,17,4,1.0,1/14/2017,"This place. Wow. What a mess. Horrible. Examples: the chips that came with at luke-warm spinach artichoke dip were undercooked, greasy and nasty. The service took is over two hours for pizza. Two hours! The fastest thing they did was take our money. Even their ""famous"" Pazookie dessert was clearly sitting somewhere getting cold enough for the ice cream not to melt. And the cookies tasted old, almost having that stale flavor. How do you mess up the two things that your most known for? They did. The issues we saw from front of the house to service to food quality are a reflection of poor management. All this was us giving this dump a second chance after a similar experience the last time. We will not be back especially when we have choices like Selmas right around the corner."
Mahesh S.,"Irvine, CA",807,382,260,4.0,4/6/2016,"Say what you want, but it doesnt take that much to impress me. If your staff is honest and smiling, and food is good, and drinks are cold, I am sold! This place always has the best service. Never once Have i run into a staff with attitude. Everyone is super cheerful, helpful, and nice. on Tuesdays, its half of wine nights. My friends and I usually go for their champagne splits! so its champagne tuesday thanks to BJs! after 10 the happy hour has half off deep dish pizzas. if you are nice and talk to the staff, they will help switch that to a flat bread pizza and get the same happy hour price! Salina works at this location, and she is like the bestttttttt! We love her! she is so prompt, and makes sure to check on enough times, but still make you feel like you have your own time there!  I also like their brunch menu on weekends. the egg white omlete with fruits is my favorite!! if you want to goto BJs goto this one, even if you live across from Irvine Market place. that bJs is the worst!."
Jenifer O.,"Temecula, CA",10,9,1,5.0,1/12/2017,"Great experiance. The Baked Ziti was absolutely my favorite. Fast, friendly and very accommodating to my coworkers VERY specific requests. Our waitress Tanya (I think that was her name) was such a delight."
Jett P.,"San Diego, CA",0,11,,4.0,2/20/2017,"I was quite satisfied with this BJ's location. I have been to many before, and my only complaint for this location is the time waiting for the food. It took quite a while for our food to come out. Like always, the ambiance is very nice. Our waiter, Lubna was also very helpful, and kind. She fulfilled all of our needs, and did it with a great attitude. I am always impressed with the service in the BJ's chain. The food tasted great, but again it took a while for it to come out. Overall, the experience was great! 4 star review."
Kevin J.,"Dana Point, CA",2,120,92,4.0,11/18/2015,"Came her for Veteran's Day, have never been here prior to.  There was a long line of course, but they were kind enough and thoughtful enough to bring out pizza for the waiting parties. To think about the people outside waiting and giving them a sample of food is not only going beyond regular service, but it also makes for a more pleasant experience for customers and servers.   Meal Chicken Club Sandwich, delicious seasoned very well, not over cooked and a pleasant meal.  Wish we had ordered the pizza as this is what they are known for.  Crispy Jalapeno Burger, cooked medium well, loved the battered jalapenos on the burger, it was a memorable hamburger. A lot of restaurants who offer meals to veterans tend to get the business back because as veterans we appreciate the fact that they are honoring us, and it give the establishment a chance to display their fares.  The service and the food was both excellent, we definitely will be back."
Alvin T.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",0,58,27,4.0,1/23/2017,Great place to eat. Good vibe but the Lighting is a little too dark. Food was great defiantly will go back!
Andrea S.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",0,2,,1.0,8/1/2017,"I was at the restaurant on July 27, 2017 with my daughter and a friend and we sat on the patio. It filled up quickly and I had my back to what was going on behind me.  A very careless, thoughtless young female tried to carry a wooden high chair between the tables and there wasn't enough room and she hit me in the shoulder very hard. I got a very insincere ""I'm sorry, the chair was too heavy for me!"" Needless to say she used very poor judgement and furthermore lied to her manager EVAN. I told him about the incident as I left and he said he didn't know who had done it when she walked up. She said she only scratched my arm! That was an outright lie and he said he would take her aside and talk to her. She showed no remorse, like it was the highchairs' fault for banging into me!!! Then EVAN put ME on the spot by asking what could he do to make things better. Very poor customer service and resolution all the way around."
Jenny W.,"Canyon Lake, CA",0,6,9,1.0,1/1/2017,"If there was the ability to give a zero I would. We made reservations for 7pm when we arrived they had not recollection of our reservations. So we we're told to wait and we would get the next table. We waited and after about 15 minutes we checked back in and we were told only 10 more minutes and we would be seating, that our table was being cleaned. It took till 730 to be seated for a table of 7 when we only had 4 people!! When we talked to the manager he dismissed our wait time and told us ""your table is ready right now"". It took 30 minutes to find us a table as other guests are being seated, with no regard of concern from the manager.  Once we were seated it took 10 mins for the waited to come and take our drink orders. It ruined my family's New Years, the customer service was terrible, didn't even get an apology which would of went a long way. I get that it was crowded, but it doesn't take a lot to have some concern."
Dusty D.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,2,,1.0,1/17/2017,"Last Friday, January 13 my wife slipped and fell to the ground hitting her head on the floor and breaking her finger nail at BJ restaurant in Laguna Hills.  Floor was very slippery and the several hostesses who witnessed the incident never gave any assistance or even asking her if she was alright, they were just watching.  There was no manager around as well. It was the worst experience we have had in a long time.  The fact that the hostesses were careless is what makes this restaurant the worst experience."
Patricia G.,"Santa Fe, NM",0,19,,3.0,12/29/2016,"I took a friend to BJ's for lunch today and we shared a  1/2 rack of ribs. We also each got the unlimited soup and salad. The soup and salad were great. The ribs were the most pathetic I'd ever seen. The bones themselves were very tiny, very skinny, almost like chicken rib bones and what little meat there was (on such tiny bones) was dry. Extremely disappointing. I did not complain at the restaurant because I did not want to embarrass my friend. I did call the restaurant when I got home and the manager Matt was very cordial and offered to compensate me in some appropriate way. I thanked him and declined his offer. Just wanted him to know.  I will probably return but will never again order the scrawny ribs!"
Luis C.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,13,2,1.0,4/16/2016,"Place is like any other in the chain, but because of its location you'll tend to see many over 60 years old in the restaurant, nothing wrong with it right.  Well my experience was with an overcharge I received on my bill  for drinks I ordered but never got at the end I asked to cancel them, apparently they didn't and  as many of us do I didn't review the details and paid extra. About 35 dollars. Later the same day  I notice the overcharge and returned the next day to get it resolved.  Management response was not helpful for the contrary I was told server remember giving me the drinks and because of that I could not be reimbursed, I even asked them to look at the videos to confirm what I say they have videos but it was a long process, I said I wait I waited for 3 weeks returning and calling  every 3 days or so and management ( spoke to 3 different ones) never started that process.  THEY DID NOT BELIEVE THE CUSTOMER AND WAS UNFAIRLY OVERCHARGED.  Hope other customer leaves without paying the bill And they get the Karma"
Vivi F.,"Columbia, SC",0,8,,5.0,7/23/2017,"Excellent service from Jeff Almada (sp?). Fantastic waiter, fantastic service. Everything was prompt and the food was fantastic. Evan, the manager, was absolutely amazing and was very accommodating. I absolutely recommend BJ's."
Ana N.,"Mission Viejo, CA",14,12,18,3.0,7/7/2016,"Came here last night for a late birthday dinner with my bf's mom and aunt. The waiter was not very plesent or nice, after he left for his break the second waiter was better. He was charming and nice and tried his best. The pizza I got was very good. But after the deserts took so long to come out that we almost just canceled it. Although I did feel bad and embarrassed caused of how much my bf's and especially his aunt act as she has no patience and I could tell it made the waiter nervous. In the end my complaint is for the first waiter we got."
Raita T.,"Las Vegas, NV",14,11,57,1.0,7/5/2016,"Well me and my family really desappointed for our dinner, this place really sucks. I ordered calamari and came out over cooked and shewed, return it and the same ... main entree I have salmon mediterranean but salted and not good. My husband same meal with Mahi Mahi and didn't like it either, my son has chicken Alfredo ouhhh ... Tks god they didn't charge it, son loves pasta but this one he even didn't want it eat ... Really bad experience, service is good but kitchen need some serious improvements ..."
Bob G.,"Laguna Hills, CA",0,5,,2.0,12/31/2016,"BJ's was always a place that was desirable based on its location and speciality beers. However, the Bar area at BJ's in Laguna Hills is lacking that minimal service and attention you would expect in such a nice area. Basically, the servers seem to be too pre-occupied with their friends when they are gathered around the bar. Unfortunately the Bar table service is far below par. Nothing like getting to a table and having to wait 10 min while the server shoots the bull with other servers, the bartender, and the off duty employees at the corner of the bar. I have noticed this lack of service in the past but it seems that this place looses customer focus from time to time. Very disappointed today. We had to sit at the bar and flag the bartender over to get service. They can do better."
Fanny Y.,"Anaheim, CA",2,61,23,2.0,3/31/2016,"Came here for a Thursday lunch with some coworkers (party of 10). Ordered a Roasted Salmon Quinoa Bowl. Beware: the size of the salmon was half of the picture shown. Besides the size, the fish was tasty. Well cooked and moist. The quinoa was served with sauteed red onions, mushrooms, asparagus, and bell peppers. I really enjoyed this dish. My complaints: The service was ridiculously slow. It took a total of 1 hour from the moment we arrived to the moment we got our food. Ain't nobody got time for that! When a complaint was made, one of the guys (maybe manager?) tried to make excuses as to why it could have taken so long. In the end, he did seem apologetic and gave us a discount on our meal. Not a very clean restaurant. My cloth napkin was so gross. I did not dare to wipe my mouth with it. Also, my menu came with someone's leftover food. Either I am watching too much Downton Abbey or these guys need to shine their silverware. Our drinks never got refilled... I was so thirsty... Uneven portions. I looked over at what other coworkers ordered. Some of their dishes were so small... What is this? A meal for ants? The meal has to be at least 3 times bigger than this!"
Ellen M.,"Irvine, CA",182,104,33,1.0,3/12/2016,"If I could leave no stars, I would. Alexandria/Alecandra was our server and the whole table felt like she was tired and was upset that she got another table. We all feel so uncomfortable that we don't want to come back. She didn't talk to us except to quickly our order. We all just got off our serving shift and we were so shocked with her unbelievely horrible service we didn't want to tip. Dropped off the check while we were still eating and didn't clear any plates and didn't refill us. FELT SUPER RUSHED. Rude."
Mark F.,"Lake Forest, CA",43,62,58,2.0,2/28/2016,"Food wasn't too bad, but this place is super dirty....check out the pics. It was pretty disgusting"
Ted S.,"Lake Forest, CA",199,448,970,2.0,7/26/2014,"I would recommend not going to happy hour with food in mind.  As an afterthought perhaps, but just that.  Basically, the offerings are not at all good. Drinks: $5 cosmos is not a bad deal, and they tasted okay, but came out unchilled.  That was strange but, again, not bad. The lemon drop martini was basically lemonade with no hint of noticeable alcohol, so scary if you don't know it's in there.  Gin martini was okay too, but kind of meh. Sliders: plain little burgers.  Not bad, but not special either. Kind of boring, with lettuce and pickles on the side.  The fries that came with them weren't bad. Calamari: $10.25. Not on the happy hour menu, but we ordered it because we like calamari.  It was all tender and good, but the batter was only a little crispy on the tentacled pieces.  The rest of them had soft batter, like they had been sitting out for quite some time. The tartar sauce was pretty good, but I didn't care for the warm marinara sauce.   Southwestern spring rolls: Why is it that anything around here that has ""southwest"" in it's description has the exact same flavor no matter what it is? These looked great, and were fried to a nice crispiness, but I took one bite and put it back.  Cumin anyone?  Blah. Mini pizzas: Doughy, not at all hot.  How can you make a fresh pizza and have it come out with cheese that's already congealed and separated from the ingredients underneath? Why aren't the tomato bits and sausage fused with the cheese?  We had both a pepperoni and sausage and a BJ special.  Both were pretty bad.  I think they must do a pre-thing to them for happy hour. The pepperoni and sausage were both standalone bland.   I've been to BJ's other times, not for the happy hour, and I don't recall not liking anything before. In this case I really didn't like much of anything, except for the calamari, which wasn't really that good either. On the pizza, we agreed that Little Caesar's was better (I don't like Little Caesar's), and you get a whole pizza there for the same price as this tiny, soft, miserable thing. Not to knock BJs as a whole, but don't expect good eats for happy hour.  Go for the drinks, and order from the regular menu for food."
