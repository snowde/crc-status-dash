Chris S.,"Los Angeles, CA",23,11,,1.0,2/16/2016,"simple order of 1 beer & one order of mahi mahi tacos took 40 minutes. 1 of the two tacos had no meat. Order returned after i complained with chips and guac dip that i assume should have been included the first time. Also rude hostess, walked in behind her and made eye contact with me and turned letting the door close in my face...  Snobby would be an upgrade."
Michelle Z.,"Irvine, CA",94,3,1,1.0,9/29/2016,"This review is for customer service. I'll preamble this by saying: I don't really require a whole lot from my wait staff. Usually just that they get our orders right. Even when they get them wrong, I don't make a big deal about it, as long as they own up to the mistake and fix it. Tonight, friends and I went to BJ's for dessert and drinks. There were 9 of us total. It was around 8:30 or 9 pm when we came in and were seated within 5 minutes. Being a Wednesday night, it was relatively quiet. The evening was off to a good start. Our waitress tonight got our waters right away. About 10 or 15 minutes later brought out our drinks, and then another 5 minutes later our desserts came out. One of my friends didn't get her monkey bread. We mentioned it to another waiter passing us by and then the waitress came along a short while later and said she would bring it right out. It came up basically when everyone was ready to pay their bills.  The waitress asked us if we were paying separately or together. We said separately, and I mentioned I was going to be paying for the birthday girl as well. She seemed fine with that and brought out all our checks. I found a book that had two checks but my order was split into both checks. One check had my monkey bread listed and the other one had my drink, another drink, and another dessert that I assumed belonged to my birthday friend. This was my mistake for assuming because it turned out the birthday girl had only ordered a drink.  I gave the waitress my card paid the check.  A while later she came back with our receipts. One of my friends didn't find her check was trying to be honest and let the waitress know that she forgot to charge us for her dessert. The waitress said she was wrong and at that point, we realized it was accidentally on my check. My friend asked if she could reimburse me and charge her instead. The waitress said no and that it really wasn't that much money anyway. It's true. It was only a 5 dollar dessert and I had already told my friend it was totally fine but I feel like she could have resolved the issue but instead chose not to. Then, before leaving the table the waitress said, ""So no one is going to claim this monkey bread? Fine. I guess I'll just throw away the receipt since I brought one of them late."" She was kind of giving my friend who got her dessert late a look. Which made my friend uncomfortable because she was in fact being charged for her monkey bread and had her card already swiped. I had a receipt for monkey bread (the first check) in my check book so I assumed she had already charged me for mine as well. So we were both confused because we were the only two people who ordered that and as far as we knew, my friend was being charged for an extremely late dessert. And I was being charged for another person's dessert, on top of the two orders I was already paying for. I honestly shrugged off the comment and didn't give it another thought but my friend was uncomfortable by the fact that the waitress made a comment that implied one of us was trying to skip out on our monkey bread payment and then acted like she was doing us a huge favor by throwing out the check. So she wanted to clarify that she was in fact paying the late monkey bread. I thought she had a valid reason for being upset. At this point the manager stepped in and said he was going to investigate the situation further. He came back and said no you guys didn't pay for the late monkey bread. My friend showed him the receipt and said, I just paid for it. He then proceeded to say something along the lines of, ""well that's your fault. You shouldn't have offered her your card"". Then she explained, ""well, she only offered not to charge us for the monkey bread after she charged us. He got really defensive and was basically implying we were lying to him. Then he went to talk to his waitress and then came back and told my friend she didn't get charged for her monkey bread.  I then decided to double check my receipt and realized the I didn't have the receipt for the monkey bread that was included in the checkbook I was originally handed. The waitress must have not realized my card was supposed to go to both checks in the book. At this point, I realized what happened and tried to intervene and explained the situation to the manager. He, however, VERY RUDELY stopped me in my tracks and said, ""This conversation doesn't concern you. It's between her and I."" And then continued to speak to her in this rude tone. He escalated this situation and further agitated us when his job should have been to step in and do the opposite. I understand it was a confusing situation but being in the position he is in, he had an opportunity to turn this into something positive but instead made this a very negative experience. In the end, I forced in my explanation and he threw away the check. But made us waste 20 minutes and caused several members of our party to get upset over his attitude."
Jen R B.,"Lake Forest, CA",46,183,83,4.0,10/13/2016,Me my family here for lunch today. It was a busy lunch crowd.  Our service was great.  She had a great attitude and checked on us to make sure our food was good and see if we needed anything else.  The food came out in appropriate timing -served hot and tasted great.  I had the Meat Lovers Piadini.  We had leftovers to go.  Our son was a little rowdy and didn't eat much but our server was pleasant with him. We would definitely come here again.
Allison G.,"Lakewood, CA",0,14,10,2.0,1/1/2017,"The wait time to be seated was great, we didn't have to wait long at all. To be served to get our order took 30mins...meaning for that entire time no one came to ask for our drinks or nothing... poor service. Highly disappointed"
Maddison B.,"Lake Forest, CA",247,25,,2.0,12/27/2016,"HORRIBLE SERVICE!  1) took 10 minutes to get waters 2) our salad came and we sat for 20 minutes without silverware  3) we asked about a type of pizza and we're ready to order but our server walked away 4) we asked for more salad dressing, when it finally came 15 minutes later- we were done.  Food was good. Server was nice, but service was bad. Granted we were in the bar, but shouldn't have to ask multiple times for things."
C C.,"Fullerton, CA",17,111,3,1.0,1/28/2016,"I'm writing this review on my second day of suffering from food poisoning from a side salad I ordered to accompany my pizza. I've both dined in and ordered takeout from many different BJ's locations, and never had an issue.  I am fairly certain the salad was the culprit, because I remember thinking the lettuce looked wilted, and discolored. After about three bites, I bit into grit, which tells me the lettuce was probably not washed at all. I stopped eating the salad immediately, but the damage had already been done, and I've been extremely sick and had to call off of work for two days. Be VERY careful when ordering anything other than pizza from this location...there are obviously standards being overlooked in the cleanliness of the kitchen."
Aerial A.,"Los Angeles, CA",19,604,67,4.0,9/19/2016,Came here again with a friend. We got a large pizza half bacon ranch and half chicken philly . The chicken philly is a new flavor and it is really yummy. The spinach dip is delicious and pizookie trio is a great deal. I highly recommend the cookies n' cream pizookie and the monkey bread one.
J N.,"Dana Point, CA",0,22,,1.0,3/4/2017,Had lunch with my daughter. We shared a small deep dish pizza which was nothing special. I had the seared ahi salad which was terrible. The fish tasted fishy and the lettuce was limp. It was obvious the salad had been made hours and hours earlier - possibly even yesterday. My daughter had some soup which was just ok. Our server didn't check on how our meal was. It took over a half hour to get this food and it was very disappointing. We won't ever go there again.
Peter L.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",41,82,59,4.0,4/3/2016,Food was OK and server was OK.  I had a little trouble with paying by app and the Manager was great and took care of issues right away.
Kristin Y.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,4,,1.0,6/11/2017,I have been to BJs a few times and every time I say the same thing-their service is seriously lacking. Something as basic as having someone to provide customer service at the take out desk and it was non-existent.
Da W.,"Mission Viejo, CA",1,26,18,2.0,10/28/2016,Our server was all over the place had no clue. The front can't never get when you order your food trough the app. Food is ok not my favorite. Took so long to get our drinks..
Hayley W.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",0,3,,2.0,6/10/2017,So very disappointed.  Always loved the French dip beef sandwich. Now they charge more money because changed it to prime rib beef. You have to add the cheese and carmalized onions. Not the same and not half as good as it use to be. Won't be returning . To bad it was the best around
Ryan C.,"Irvine, CA",0,9,,5.0,8/6/2016,"Specifically writing a review on the manager Tommy . My wife just had a baby at saddleback, went and ordered food to bring it back. The order was completely wrong, called in and was told by employees that they were sorry and that they could call me back, as any normal response would be I asked to speak to the manager. Tommy answered the phone, professional and attentive. After we spoke he said he would personally fix the issue and run the food over to us. 20 minutes later we have a knock on the door with our food.  Thanks tommy!"
John C.,"Newport Beach, CA",11,209,5,4.0,4/23/2017,"We were not expecting much since it was chosen by a grandson. Yet we were surprised by how tasty the food was. The prime rib , served only on Fridays & Saturdays, was as good as any priced more than twice as much without the included soup or salad plus the specialty dessert. The wait staff was attentive. The place does get crowded towards the evening. This place provides good food for the money. Do note that you cannot get there via El Toro road but via a side street off El Toro. I had posted this review erroneously for the Irvine location. Since I have not been at the Irvine one, I do not know if those visiting the Irvine location would share our experience. Mea culpa."
Vince M.,"Fountain Valley, CA",8,45,14,3.0,4/8/2017,"Went here for a business lunch from the beginning, we felt rushed. I though the quest looked plain, as it turns out it was served without chili, no one asked if it was ok to make this choice for us, the server checked back but we didn't get what we needed til afterwards, now here is the clincher for me, I'm familiar with scrips but if I'm still eating why are you asking us if we want desert? Not a great experience! I"
Schel H.,"Greater Los Angeles, CA",658,1756,1544,4.0,12/2/2014,"Ok so who hasnt been to BJs? My parents love to come here and I tolerate it as I found a great item for myself on the menu. it is a typical BJs chain shop. You get the typical corporate food servers and order takers. They work like robots most of the time delivering you decent but not outstanding food and service. Perhaps it is just efficient for the most part. Regardless of the number of check ins I have here, I have about 15 that I can think of off the top of my head...  Pro Tip: Try the pizza, BJ's beers, and the Maui Glaze porkchop from the light menu. I have been getting the Maui Glazed porkchop the last few times that I have been here. Sadly my daughter steals about 1/2 or 1/4 of my meal and I dont get to steal back from her as she almost always gets mac n cheese... *SMH* kids... like you had no clue she would get that? haha None the less its decent for what it is and i enjoy eating here for the most part... im still not thrilled about the overall experience, but its better than most chains, so i will eat here, but primarily it is for my parents happiness as they enjoy most chains and that means this one..."
Kristin Leigh M.,"Las Flores, CA",702,1127,1788,2.0,11/3/2013,"Like my original review, my food was not hot. No. Barely warm. Again, like it had been under a heat lamp for ages. I was going to send it back, but the gent who dropped it off wasn't our sever, and I didn't see the server again until about 20 minutes later.  I should have asked if they were going to comp the iced tea, since we spent the entire meal thirsty. No refills, until it was time to ask for the cheque. What I don't understand here: they always make you wait (even a few minutes) event if the place isn't full. Maybe they are always short staffed?  The one (and only?) promising thing about this location: the mozzarella sticks are always top notch, piping hot, and seem fresh (or as fresh as mozzarella sticks can be). Next time I am craving BJs--which isn't very often--I'll find another location to go to."
Rob D.,"West Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",291,15,2,5.0,10/9/2016,"It was packed but still no wait, the servers are all running around crazy which we thought was funny but the service was so good that it actually made sense.  This place is great"
Michael B.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",945,264,620,5.0,1/5/2016,Great happy hour specials early and late. And open late always and James is the man with a smile and a game to keep your beer full. Great half off mini pizzas.  Always love the avocado egg rolls yum the sauce rocks. Pizza is great here especially if you love deep dish. I never had a bad experience here ever and I have been here 30 times. Parking is full in front but always parking available a row or 2 deep for free. Bathrooms always very clean too.
Conor B.,"Chatsworth, CA",163,1350,106,5.0,1/5/2015,"I love this location. It's spacious, clean, inviting, and the staff is always very friendly.  Let's just highlight something that happened on my last vist:  I came here over the holidays & was excited to see that they had their special year end brew. I ordered a glass, & the waiter came back shortly after saying that with my pour they had exhausted their keg. I was bummed. THEN he said as an apology, he got the clearance to give me an individual bottle & the accompanying glass that comes with it...for free! So I ended up getting the half pour they got out of the keg PLUS an extra bottle. That's what I'm talking about! And it's things like that that make me love this location over other BJs."
