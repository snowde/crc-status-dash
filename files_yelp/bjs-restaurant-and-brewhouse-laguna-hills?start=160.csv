Sharon O.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,1,,2.0,5/10/2017,"Not sure what's up with this BJ's!?  I keep going back hoping for improvement but leave feeling it was worse than the time before.  It's time to fire and hire new staff that show respect for customers, each other, and take pride in what they do. Manager(s),  Please find a way to improve your food and service before it's too late!!  PLEASE!!! Thank you."
David S.,"Garden Grove, CA",0,19,26,2.0,9/2/2016,"Arrived Saturday (7/30/16) at 6:30 PM. Sat in patio with family of 6. Service was poor from the get-go. We received our waters, but waited over 10 minutes before server came. She then messed up our simple drink order and brought the wrong appetizer. Someone in our party had the wrong dinner entree too. The place was busy, but I'm not sure why. I'll certainly not visit here again."
Thomas C.,"Laguna Woods, CA",0,6,,3.0,4/9/2017,"BJ's is the go to spot when looking for good food, friendly service and the opportunity to watch great sports on their wide screen TV's.  I had a party of 6 and they were quick to provide seating without those long wait times."
Shannon P.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",8,3,,1.0,5/14/2016,"My daughter has celiacs, made sure the server knew. He assured her that the food was prepared in a gluten free area. My daughter barely made it home because she was so sick. Her birthday has been ruined because she was glutened."
Felix L.,"Los Angeles, CA",1022,558,15565,3.0,3/23/2013,"Good: 1. A handful of TVs are available by the booths, at the bar, and in the patio area. BJ's is a solid alternative to traditional sports bars for those who want to catch March Madness games without sacrificing on the food quality. I believe BJ's carries Direct TV network. 2. Plenty of seating, significantly more than the Tustin Marketplace location. The patio features open seating and can accommodate at least 10 large parties. 3. Lunch specials start from $5.95 (chicken quesadilla). A flatbread and salad is $6.95. Unlimited soup and salad is $7.50. A specialty lunch salad is $8.95. A variety of lunch size pastas is $1 off the regular menu price. You CAN get a lunch for under $10 here (under certain circumstances). 4. For health-conscious customers, I recommend the flatbread/salad lunch special (575 calories). The choices for flatbread included ""black and bleu"", ""roasted vegetables and goat cheese"", ""california club, ""fresh basil with italian sausage"", and ""margherita fresca"". I ordered a half margherita fresca flatbread and half mixed green salad with balsamic vinaigrette. The meal felt very light. All ingredients used were fresh.  Bad: 1. Flatbread was lukewarm. 2. Slow service. This is not an ideal restaurant to get in and out quickly for a quick lunch break. You need at least an hour for the entire experience. If you have less time, get take-out or look elsewhere. 3. Soft drinks were $2.95. This makes spending under $10 for lunch a fantasy if you cannot restrain yourself from ordering a beverage."
Meghan G.,"Broomfield, CO",108,45,7,3.0,2/24/2016,"It is a typical chain restaurant. The service was friendly and nice, but the steak was over done and not really all that good. However, what the rest of my party got looked fine so maybe just dont go there for steak."
Scott G.,"San Dimas, CA",4,79,28,5.0,1/31/2016,"Great service, great food, great brand.  I've never been to a BJ's where anything was bad.  The pizza is amazing, deep dish. WOW! Haha no need to say anything more."
Maziar J.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,2,,1.0,6/14/2016,"This place is terrible for take out. A month ago I ordered a medium pizza for take out. When I got home I noticed they gave me a small pizza. I let that go. I ordered take out again tonight, same medium build your pizza. This time when I got home, opened my food to see they give me a 4 slice mini pizza. While both time they charged me for medium. Once, I'll accept it could be mistake. Now twice, I can only say it's something they do hoping to get away with it. I'm done with this location and will strongly everyone to stay from this location as well"
Ken M.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",82,64,,1.0,5/6/2016,My wife and I stopped by for a beer.  We received an alert from Capitol One  that our tip seemed large for the purchase.  It was doubled by someone at BJs.  We confirmed it with our copy of the receipt.
Jimmy J.,"Ladera Ranch, CA",0,3,2,1.0,9/25/2016,"Place has gone way downhill. Not this location per se, but all of them. If you think they have good deep dish piazza than you're new to OC and never had one back in the day before they went public and expanded to the ""brewhouse"" concept. I can't argue with their success, they always seem busy, but I feel cheated every time I go hoping it will be better . It never is. Soggy nasty pie."
Jose M.,"West Covina, CA",43,5,1,1.0,8/13/2016,"We went to lunch here yesterday. We got there as soon as they opened, yet they sat the 4 of us outside with the cooks who and kitchen workers who were also having lunch. They never asked us if we would like to sit outside in the heat or inside in the AC. They walked us straight there. The restaurant had just opened!!! There was plenty of tables available. Was it because we were Mexican-American? Was it because we were in the uniform? I can honestly say this is the first time I have EVER felt discriminated against because of the way I look. The waiter, who was also Mexican-American, gave us good service. I will never eat at BJ's again."
Ana P.,"Laguna Hills, CA",1,7,,5.0,9/21/2016,"Come here almost every month! Great place to catch up with friends, family dinners, or just catching desert! Never a dull moment, food comes pretty quick and the employees here are always friendly and welcoming!"
Catherine W.,"Port Orchard, WA",16,6,7,5.0,8/9/2016,"The cooks amazed me with making my food the way I needed it, I have food allergies and they rocked my food!! Thank you!!"
Scott A.,"Costa Mesa, CA",39,65,70,5.0,12/1/2014,"I got the mini 1 topping pizza lunch special. 4 bucks off the regular price.    Service here is always friendly, and the food is delicious."
Heath L.,"Costa Mesa, CA",39,7,,1.0,8/6/2016,"I was very disappointed in the service tonight at the BJ's on El Toro. I was eating at the bar. An Indian gentleman and his father in law sat next to me. They tried to order a couple of beers. The bartender asked for ID. The father in law (55 years old and looks every day of it) left his passport at home. The bartender in a very condescending way said ""I don't know about your country, but we have a thing called ABC. I am not leaving in handcuffs for serving you"" the manager came by a few minutes later and supported the bartender. The patrons left. Horrible customer service and incredibly bad use of discretion!"
Charles R.,"Irvine, CA",163,167,271,5.0,12/3/2014,Great lunch specials with great prices Young lady named Rudi gave excellent service.
Neil K.,"Yorba Linda, CA",19,32,,1.0,8/2/2016,"Second shot, again a catered office luncheon. Tried the fish and chips. They forgot the malt vinegar I selected. Both the fish and the fries were horrible, both greasy tasting and mushy rather than crispy. Everyone else's lunches, like pizzas were also soggy looking, and were to their dismay. Next time someone selects BJ's for their birthday luncheon, I'm going out for McDonalds ... and least I know that won't be soggy and would be edible at least."
Denise L.,"Aurora, IL",3,5,1,2.0,9/2/2015,"Disappointed with our trip to BJ's tonight. We usually love going here. We love the pizza and the handcrafted root beer.  Tonight the pizza was great, but the root beer didn't have the same great flavor.  The staff left much to be desired. The waitress who took our drink order was quick and responsive. The server over our area was very friendly, but did not stop by very often.  When our pizza came they didn't bring plates and we waited for almost 5 minutes for them to bring some. By then the pizza was barely warm.   We finished off dinner with a pizookie that came to our table after a very long wait and the cookie wasn't even warm.  We will be trying a different location next time. No one goes to spend that much money for cold food."
Jules D.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",3,12,4,1.0,7/11/2017,"Usually this place is okay for late night food and drinks but definitely don't recommend here if you're in a rush. Had 3 drinks here tonight and each one took a minimum of 15 mins to come out. The food was quick once we were finally able to order considering they were over staffed with food runner and bussers, while they only had one server for an outrageous amount of tables. Saw him for collectively maybe 90 seconds throughout the hour and a half we were here. I don't blame him as he was running around and trying to get to everyone but being in the service industry myself for 7 years, i know there is only so much you can do at once. Management is definitely working this poor guy(Ryan I assume from our check) to the bone. He looks extremely stressed and it's shocking that a manager of such a large corporate chain would not know better than to staff appropriately as we won't be back after seeing the conditions they are willing to put their employees through, despite the insane wait time of everything. I've been here multiple and never waited 20 minutes just for my check to pay so I can just get out of this place."
Cameron L.,"Lake Forest, CA",173,18,13,5.0,6/12/2015,"Just got off of a long server shift and decided to go to Bj's to enjoy a sit down dinner and a beer with my girlfriend . Got the Bm porter, delicious, not a fan of many restaurant brewed beer, but it was perfectly balanced.  The food was delightful, the bleu cheese burger was great, the bleu cheese wasn't too potent, wasn't too weak, another perfect balance. My girlfriend got the gluten free pizza, she enjoyed it. And to top it all off the gluten free pazooki was amazing with the vanilla bean gelato/ice cream. Highly recommended, can't tell its gluten free The best part of the night was the 'A' level service provided by Chance, rocking the man bun, very friendly and accommodating. Whoever the server was assisting him was also phenomenal. Unfortunately Bj's no longer carries their lemon chicken pasta. But the burger made up for it. Overall a very pleasant experience, will be back soon to request, Chance as my server!"
