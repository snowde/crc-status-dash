Dawn F.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",123,94,72,3.0,6/13/2016,"We are locals and usually come here for the deep dish pizza and pizookie. Delish! This review is for the service today, which is an important facet of a restaurant's reputation.  Today, my son had out patient surgery close by at 10:30am, and I knew by the time he was finished, it would be lunchtime and we'd all be hungry. I decided to try BJ's take out service ordering off my phone. Pretty easy and efficient, I must say.  When I arrived, I went right up to the take out area. Chris was the cashier. Although it was only 11:45am, he seemed overworked and bothered by customers. He was curt to the customer before me that asked a question, and then asked me 'what I needed'. No courtesy at all. As he rang up my pizza order, I mentioned that I used the online ordering system and that it was great, and also that I noticed it was free pizookie day tomorrow, June 14th, and asked if he could verify that? Nope, he said he didn't know anything about it. Then I mentioned that I had the most delicious pizookie ever about 2 months ago-the monkey bread pizookie, but noticed that it wasn't on the online menu-was it still available to order? He then said (which surprised me) ""I wouldn't know"".  What?!!! You wouldn't know? Chris, you work here!!! Part of your job is knowing what's on your menu, especially if you are the one positioned to answer the phone go take out orders. So, while I like the pizza, the service today lacked big time."
Phillip C.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",0,2,,1.0,2/13/2017,Used DoorDash...they gave the delivery man the wrong order...used door dash because our garage is under our babies room and didn't want to wake him...had to wake him...take the burn on the DoorDash cost and tip...manager offered no apology and was reluctant to make me another pizza even though it had been sitting there 90 mins...bj's just had the last of my business
KC S.,"San Juan Capistrano, CA",0,8,,1.0,10/30/2016,"Tonight's dinner and birthday celebration was such a fiasco, it was almost comical.  Our waitress, Maria, was undeniably the worst waitress I have ever witnessed.  The manager came over to our table, twice, to apologize and partially comp us for such horrible service and some of the items that were barely edible.  Dry pasta, a horrible club sandwich, soggy noodles.  There must have been at least fifteen errors from the table we were sat at (too small for six) so we had to move, to forgetting orders, the bill came while our dessert was being prepared so after we figured it all out, another bill came, then double crummy food was delivered...I could go on and on.  Even the floors are slippery.  I will NEVER, ever, ever, set foot in this crummy restaurant again."
Paul K.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",0,4,2,1.0,1/14/2017,"Another evening of bad service at BJ's.  And this time a wrong entre was delivered and had to be remade.  By the time the correct entre came out, the rest of our party was finished eating.  Every time we go to BJ's I promise to never return.  And then we show up again to give it another try, and just repeat the disappointment and bad experience.  The waiter acknowledged and apologized for the mistakes and deficiencies.  Lots of opportunity to make any kind of small adjustment on our bill and nothing was comped... total insult.  Is that how the waiters and waitresses are trained at BJ's?  I felt like leaving zero tip, but I didn't want to be mean, so I still left a decent tip.  Will never return again."
Kimberly J.,"Powder Springs, GA",50,43,7,5.0,4/3/2016,"We celebrated a friend's baby shower here this afternoon and not only was server Preston very professional, but he went out of his way to make sure we had everything we needed through the entire meal and after. Manager Kevin was very generous and sweet with the kids. We had a great celebration and will have great memories because of our experience! Thank you!"
Mike P.,"Irvine, CA",4,91,385,1.0,4/30/2014,"Service was horrible at least eighty percent of my visits.  Chiefly, the Yelp user and service staff employee (Ryan R.) who inspired my negative Yelp tip always seemed to find my table.  This psycho created a Yelp account, per his 'compliment', solely for the purpose of sending me a childish insult in response to a tip I posted.  Psycho LOSER stalker alert! If you want to increase your odds of avoiding a bad experience, you should sit at the bar in front of a bartender.  I am amazed at how poorly this place is operated considering the owner(s)' substantial investment.  How much can a manager cost? Doubt I will return due to sustained terrible service :( ...don't want another waitress stalker either..."
Jason C.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",232,14,5,1.0,4/16/2016,"Food is terrible, service is terrible, the whole dining experience is miserable. I suggest to not waste your hard-earned money at this place. Last night I ordered a pink lemonade and after two sips I found at the bottom of my drink a crumpled up receipt. Once I told the waiter about it he just laughed without an apology. And to top it off, my wife orders an appetizer and the appetizer came out after our meals. The waiter said nothing about it and then when we told him we didn't want it, that it was cold he struggled to get it taken off our bill."
Mel H.,"Orange County, CA",285,417,2654,5.0,9/19/2012,"Simply amazed that I continue to have AWESOME service @ this BJ's locations.  I can't believe it's been only 9 days since I signed up for the rewards program and now I'm back tonight to redeem MORE points!!! :)  A disappointment that turned into a FREE appetizer! The Avocado Egg Rolls were seriously undercooked.  When we bit into it, a chunk of white flour was all stuck around the edges as if the oil didn't even touch it when they fried them. There was seriously an inch of flour all crusted around the edges of the egg rolls.  So we called the waiter who took the plate back... The Manager came and apologized. They made a FRESH NEW batch of the appetizer!!! This time it really was THE BEST BATCH of Avocado Egg Rolls ever!!! It was warm, crispy, chewy and packed w/avocado goodness!!!!  No sight of white flour :)  I ordered the EnLIGHTened Thai Chicken Mango Salad. But I shared my concern w/the waiter because the first time I ordered this dish, I explained that the chicken was bland/rubbery/not tasty at all!! Kind of tasted like weird fake chicken or something.... So my waiter suggested that I substitute ""BLACKENED CHICKEN"" instead of ""Grilled"" chicken.  This time the chicken had a better flavor and did taste like chicken!!  Yay!! I was happy :)  Now onto our Mediterranean Pizza. It's a DEEP dish pizza or choose gluten-free. For some reason I didn't know that BJ's doesn't have  thin crust!?!?!!?   The crust was a little too thick for us as it was almost like eating bread. For 4 role the medium was more than enough to share...  The Mediterranean is interesting with sun-dried tomatoes, olives, peppercini, chicken, pesto sauce and cheese. it's really good but you can never go wrong with BJ's pizza!  Overall a pleasant evening, great food, and I'm 10 points away from redeeming a FREE PIZOOKIE!!!!!"
Chris L.,"Brea, CA",163,79,124,3.0,5/17/2016,Not a very good alcohol variety. Happy hour is not a bad deal. Food is ok nothing special. Pazookie sounds cool but totally hype. Service takes long.
Viann C.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",220,124,287,4.0,4/27/2015,Came to drink and we did!  We were seated in the bar in the corner which was great because it wasn't that loud.  The atmosphere was good but the drinks were better.  I got the Tinkled Pink!  It was very fruity!
Steven M.,"Dana Point, CA",3,60,,1.0,4/27/2015,"A few years ago I went to this Laguna Hills restaurant for a business dinner, and all five of us had a bad experience with food quality and service. I wrote to the restaurant Manager twice and received no reply. I wrote to Corporate and also received no reply. It's bad enough if you have a bad dinner and experience, but when you bring business people there it is an embarrassment! Last week I went to the Irvine location and had a pleasant experience and when I mentioned my past experience they suggested that I contact the restaurant Manager again. I again wrote twice and received no reply. The moral of the story is, this chain is not inexpensive nor the best when you expect decent service, and the Laguna Hills restaurant should be avoided at all cost."
Stella M.,"Mission Viejo, CA",3,3,11,1.0,3/23/2016,"This review is about the service and not the food,and I am referring to the  manager. I do not know his name but I do know he was Caucasian and had a country accent. So today, I came to Bj's with my boyfriend and some friends to have dinner. I also brought along my micro Pomeranian puppy with me. We didn't have any complaints from anyone around us since he was quiet the whole time. After we were done with our meal and about to pay,  this manger walked up to our table with an attitude and a harsh voice and said, ""you guys need to leave! You sneaked that dog in here and we know he's not a service dog!"" My boyfriend got pissed off and asked him why he had to walk up to us and speak to us in a disrespectful way.  To my surprise, this manager continued to raise his voice and say that we sneaked the dog in and that some customers and waiters have seen the dog the whole time.  So I asked him how does he know if he isn't a service dog and he said ""because he doesn't look like it! "" I was puzzled on how he could just assume that my dog wasn't a service dog when he never bothered to ask us if he was when he approached us in the first place. Long story short,  we paid the bill and walked out even though i shouldn't have because I was later informed that he told us to leave in the beginning with no explanation or questions; however, I didn't want any chaos so I told him I would leave a bad review and that i wasn't coming back to this location AGAINNNN!  PS: my boyfriend took a picture of him so I will post it when he sends it to me."
April D.,"Omaha, NE",35,27,14,5.0,9/26/2015,"The service was fabulous! Sat near the bar, served within 5 min, and food came out quickly! Yum!"
Ashley M.,"Fair Oaks, CA",13,214,12,1.0,3/26/2016,"Came here last night and it was pretty busy being around 9 pm on a Friday night.  The food didn't take long but I think I know why cause the food wasn't cooked all the way, cause both me and my husband were both in the bathroom all night.   Doubt we will come come here again if it's super busy cause we won't want to risk it with the food and doubt we will order the same food items either."
Jana Rae A.,"Irvine, CA",299,36,19,4.0,7/12/2015,"This place was poppin' on a Saturday. I was already grumpy since I was hungry, so walking up to the doors i thought it was gonna be a long wait. Fortunately for a table of 3 we only waited about 10 min. Thank goodness!  The restaurant was packed with people of large parties, but surprisingly all the servers and hosts were very positive and friendly. I definitely felt like everything was under control.  The food was pretty good. Had calamari as an appetizer (very tender, delicious) my dad order his usual rack of ribs (meat falling off the bones) mom ordered a salad (its a salad), and I got a BBQ Chicken deep dish pizza (it did its job). Overall very satisfied with the service, especially during peak hours on a Saturday. The food was good, and we had no complaints whatsoever."
Kaylee D.,"Los Angeles, CA",12,104,27,2.0,3/5/2015,"Why does BJS always have consistently bad service? We came here for a birthday and our server Jorge C could not have been more rude. We didn't order drinks so maybe he didn't take us seriously. We were also the only non white table, so maybe that's why.  My boyfriend and I ordered appetizers, and he cut us off and left before anyone else could even order. Seriously. He didn't even bother to ask if anyone else wanted anything. Then, he spilled water on our table and didn't apologize. We always had to flag him down when we needed something, and when he did come around, he always seemed irritated and had a permanent scowl on his face. IF I WAS THE JOKER, I WOULD PUT A SMILE ON THAT FACE OF YOURS! He was always smiling and joking around with all the other tables, so I guess he just doesn't like mixed race tables. Prick. Then when it was time to order dessert, my friend asked to see a menu. He tossed the little triangle that's already at the tables at her and said that's all they have, which is NOT true because they only had pizookies featured on there. So I told him we wanted to see a regular menu because we wanted something other than pizookies. Finally we were fed up so we told the manager what happened, and she also did not care at all. She just started at us with a confused look on her face. Worst management I've ever encountered. It's no wonder he's such a terrible server! His own manager does not care about customer service!  Needless to say, everyone regretted coming here for dinner and left in a terrible mood. Poor birthday boy!"
Dawn G.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,2,,1.0,1/7/2017,"My husband and I have been coming here for years.  It has always taken a long time to get food but it was ok because we sit in the bar and watch whatever sporting event is on the tv and enjoy our cocktails.....tonight we came in around 6:00pm, found an open booth that hadn't been cleaned and sat down.  Took a while for someone to come clean the booth(I get it, it was busy)... turned out to be our waiter.  He wasn't overly friendly but acceptable.  That's the best I can say about the evening.  Our food when it finally came to the table was cold. I ordered a second cocktail which didn't arrive until after I had finished my meal!!!  don't think we will be coming back any time soon:((("
Barbara M.,"San Clemente, CA",19,13,,5.0,7/24/2016,I love the cherry  salmon chipotle !! As long as it's hot. Last time it wasn't and had to send it back but normally it's fabulous!
Simone K.,"Mission Viejo, CA",2,22,10,3.0,8/5/2015,"*GLUTEN FREE REVIEW In short the 3 stars are for the limited options of gluten free foods. The quality of the food and menu is extensive for customers who don't have the specific allergy I have, and the food was cooked to my liking and my mother will not allergies LOVES this place.  My mother and I ate dinner here last night and I have nothing to rave about but I wasn't disappointed.  To start off it is always really nice when a location recreates a menu for gluten free customers, which BJs does. The menu doesn't have many gluten free substitutes but there are options. The menu consisted primarily of soups, salads, and meat.  My mom, who is not gluten free, ordered a salad and loved it. She has a full second meal from the leftovers.  I ordered a sirloin with my two sides as the tomato bisque soup and broccoli. I asked for the soup prior to my meal which was no problem and it was DELICIOUS. I'm not sure if this was intentional or just by chance but the soup was perfect temperature. I'm not sure if I'm the only one, but it drives me nuts when soups arrive WAY to hot to eat. The steak was cooked perfect, medium rare to my liking, but taste wise wasn't much different from any other steak I've ordered. Broccoli is, well, broccoli.  For dessert my mother and I shared a gluten free pizookie which was really good and amazing that they had a gluten free option.  Again, all in all, I can't RAVE about the dinner, primarily because I am now gluten free. I know if I had eaten here before my gluten allergy came about I would be SO thrilled with all the menu options!! Gluten allergies are a tough one.  I would come back here,but not frequently due to the small menu option for my allergy, which is why I gave 3 instead of 4 stars.  They do also have gluten free beer, which isn't common in most restaurants."
Anastasia A.,"Lake Forest, CA",8,12,5,4.0,5/22/2016,Would have given 5 but they were out of the Santa Fe rolls so I had to order something else as my dinner. Louis was a great server though.
