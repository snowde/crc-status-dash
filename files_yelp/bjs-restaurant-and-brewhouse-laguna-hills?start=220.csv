Chales S.,"Los Angeles, CA",22,9,,1.0,6/2/2016,"Second time taking my family here for dinner. The first time I thought that the service was extremely slow and we had to ask for basic things. So, we tried again. Same location, same poor service. The waitress would be gone for 10+ minutes, over and over again. We had to wait about 8 - 10 minutes to meet our waitress the first time, and then another 5+ minutes again to get our drink order placed. They showed up about 10 minutes later. Sigh. Someone brought our salads, and left quickly. I had to go find someone to get silverware and napkins. Shame, shame. Meals came much later, and once again food delivered with no question of 'did we need anything else'. Yes! We needed the missing items, and is it possible to get ketchup for our fries? Finally got everything. Finished eating without seeing waitress....again. She came by and asked if we wanted dessert. Kids ordered the pizookie trio and refills on drinks. Once again 10 - 15 minutes went by. Finally got pizookie, drinks and the check. By the time we got there and finished it was one hour and 45 minutes.  Never again. 2 times with same poor service is enough for me. As we left, the people at a table 2 away from us was complaining to the manager, that didn't seem to be taking the criticism very well.  What ever happened to courtesy?"
Larry B.,"San Juan Capistrano, CA",0,6,,4.0,11/6/2016,"My wife & I went to BJ's in Laguna Hill after a movie. Glad they were open until midnight. Food was very good, service was marginal, Trevor is slow to come by after the food for refills but is quick to pick up the check. We had him twice and same performance each time."
Jorge B.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",2,6,7,1.0,1/27/2015,"I would not recommend this place for lunch. Especially if you only have an hour break from work.  We came here for lunch. The restaurant seemed quiet and most tables were empty. We were three and ordered from the lunch menu, which you'd think it would be ready in a timely manner since they are smaller portions. -- It took them 45 minutes to get our order out. This was after we asked them about it and they went to check.  I couldn't tell you much about the food because we devoured everything in the last 5 minutes we had before we needed to get back to work. Not a really nice experience to be honest, and I wouldn't generally write a review here for a one-time incident like this but this has not been the first time that this has happened."
Kylie G.,"San Clemente, CA",157,29,12,2.0,7/11/2015,"One-star service for our dinner party of 6 -  beer glass was brought 5 minutes after the bottle of beer, our entrees came out over a span 20 minutes, they forgot our side salad and then brought two, waters were left empty, and we were charged for two bottles of wine instead of one. If you can't handle switching servers halfway through a service without causing chaos, don't do it!! Food would have been three stars: flavors were ok, but don't advertise salmon on quinoa then bring pearl couscous and think nobody will notice - this is Orange County, we know our superfoods ;) I've always loved BJ's as a go-to group place but this trip was a dud."
Benjy M.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",0,4,3,5.0,4/22/2016,"5 star experience because of Shane the server, the guy is all time, great guy, good looking, and great service, hands down to him, exceptional... Just simply exceptional..."
Daisy T.,"Lake Forest, CA",3,7,13,5.0,4/12/2015,I love this place! The food is great and so far our waiters have been great. The calamari is always crispy just how we like it. The broccoli cheddar soup is to die for. I usually get the grilled chicken alfredo but this time I went for the BBQ pulled pork sandwich w bacon and avocado and I have to say it's delicious!
Shannon M.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",301,16,11,5.0,3/26/2016,"BJ's is great, especially for gluten free customers. Gluten free salad options, gf pizzas, and gf pizookies - I have never had a bad experience at BJ's. The staff is always friendly, too."
Steve O.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,28,1,1.0,12/30/2015,"Unimpressed to say the least. It has been awhile since I have been here and it will be awhile before I return  (if ever) given the experience tonight. We were celebrating mom's birthday as a family.  Her fries arrived cold, my wife's pizza was burnt on the bottom and the cheese wasn't even melted. Aren't they know for pizza? My brothers spaghetti was supposed to be spicy but was actually bland and lacking any flavor. Lastly never once offered refills on drinks.   I spoke with the manager who was very nice and apologetic which was appreciated. He offered to adjust the bill but I told him it was not my intent.  Even then the server should have comped the burnt pizza that we had to send back.  My wife ended up having to take  the pizza to go as she had to feed our newborn and it already been 2 hours and we were on 2nd attempt at a pizza   So in closing dinner took two hours, my wife had to take her meal to go, I paid full price for a mediocre meal, and it did not make for a memorable birthday dinner for my mom."
Madalyn R.,"San Clemente, CA",80,30,4,2.0,10/20/2015,"I used to love this place but I feel like it's gone really downhill. The table was really dirty when we sat down and they didn't offer to clean it and there was something gross on the inside of my water glass. It Kind of makes me lose my appetite when I feel like the restaurant is dirty.  I ordered the fried artichoke hearts for an appetizer (I've had them before and they were amazing) you could tell the artichokes came from a can and they were mushy. The worst part was that they were cold in the middle :( My friend and I both ordered the lunch special baked potato with soup or salad. The Cesar was decent, nothing special. The broccoli cheddar soup looks unappetizing but is actually really good.  I chose the classic baked potato. It's good but could be a little warmer.  My friend was so full from her soup that she's taking the veggie potato home for dinner which is a plus.  Overall the service was good but the quality or the restaurant has definitely gone down. Personally I get grossed out when a restaurant feels dirty. I won't be coming back to the BJ's but will definitely give others a shot. -also the toilets aren't flushing today"
Becca H.,"Lake Forest, CA",72,201,131,3.0,8/13/2013,"Came here recently for a birthday dinner. Party of 10 and we got seated right away so that was nice- and we didn't make a reservation. The service was OK- seems like every BJ's restaurant the service is about mediocre. Our waitor only checked on us to take our order, and to drop off the food- nothing about refilling drinks, extra napkins, or anything. Food was great as always and so was the ultimate amazing Pizookie! Overall good food- mediocre service."
Kelsey M.,"Laguna Hills, CA",141,276,239,4.0,11/14/2014,"I love the BJ's favorite deep dish pizza. I get it every time. The small is perfect to split between 2 people (there are 6 slices total, so 3 each). FYI - They don't have a corkage fee! So if you bring a bottle of wine, they will give you glasses and pour the bottle for you for free. If you want to have a 2nd bottle of wine, it's only a $7 corkage fee. FYI - You can only get happy hour at the bar. We came here for happy hour beers/appetizers and waited for a table, then once we sat down our server told us that they only offer happy hour at the bar."
Eve A.,"Lake Forest, CA",1,11,,1.0,5/30/2016,We are only here because my daughter won an award at school and gets a free meal. The food is okay but pretty pricey for bar food. The one star is for the service. Our server seemed irritated to be working today. Mid-meal she asked us if our food was okay but then turned her back towards us as we tried to answer her and walked away. The food is way to expensive to give service like that.
Regie P.,"Laguna Hills, CA",28,36,246,1.0,11/5/2014,"The WORST dining experience I've had in a very long time!    Coffee mug had lipstick and pieces of food stuck to it and when thus was brought to the attention of our server,  her response was,  ""Oh, ok.""  45 minutes later, another server took away the mug and brought a fresh mug of coffee.  We had to ask for replacement forks, as they were sticky with set food and fat. Now the REASON why this was the WORST DINING EXPERIENCE,  a gluten free pizza (with no cheese) was brought out WITHOUT pizza sauce!  All the toppings fell off the top of the pizza,  which is how we realized that there was no sauce.  When this was brought to the attention of the server,  she told us that the gluten free pizza DOES NOT come with sauce.  I can understand if the sauce had gluten in it, but normally that's not the case.  When this was brought to the attention of the manager,  a replacement SMALLER pizza was made quickly,  but they STILL CHARGED us for the smaller replacement pizza and the coffee. Having worked in the food and hospitality industry for years,  thus is an OUTRAGE!  This is how you guarantee to LOSE customers.  Will never patron a BJ's EVER AGAIN!"
Cesar T.,"Lake Forest, CA",11,25,6,2.0,11/16/2014,"I had never visited a BJ's Brewhouse before. I have seen these places all over and we were curious to see what it was all about. After eating here I have to tell you...I wish we had just gone elsewhere. The salad I ate sits in my stomach like a brick and I had to take a few Rolaids to aid the pain in my gut. If you were to judge this place on appearance alone I would give it 5 stars. However, we don't visit a restaurant for the appearance alone.  I had the BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad. First of all the salad was mushy. Lettuce, tomatoes, Jicama, tortilla strips, black beans, corn blended together in a BBQ-Ranch dressing. It sounds like it should be great right? Far from it...Imagine all of these ingredients mixed together into a mushy, unappetizing mess in a salad bowl. It tasted OK overall but maybe just because I was hungry. Maybe if they mixed this all together with about 50% less dressing it would be better. Maybe if the lettuce were not limp and lifeless and almost ""water logged"". I can't put my finger on why this salad was so bad. All I know is that I sit here with my belly still aching from that mistake. It does not stop there. My son ordered a burger...a double deluxe burger. It comes with 2 patties, bacon, cheese, etc. He says the meat was crumbly, the bread was almost soggy and overall the burger was super greasy. He also is experiencing a sore belly on account of this meal.  The place was packed so they must be doing something right. Maybe the beer is great and maybe the appetizer/bar food is good. However, I can tell you that we will not be returning to this restaurant for lunch or dinner anytime soon. There are so many places to eat out here there is no reason to."
Kim R.,"Laguna Beach, CA",120,59,90,3.0,2/5/2015,Tried the kale and roasted brussel sprout salad this evening. Quite tasty except they forget the brussel sprouts!  Oh and they don't trim the lake. So beware of looking like a goat!
Dalila A.,"Mission Viejo, CA",28,19,5,5.0,1/18/2016,"Just tried their new honey siracha Brussels sprouts and some Parmesan stuffed mushrooms in the small bite snacks appetizer section, absolutely delicious!! Then I waited for their happy hour to order some ribs (it was 15min before 10pm so why not!) Best combination ever... Service: Outstanding! Jay was very efficient. Did not even have to ask for water, she was polite and a great server overall. keep it up J! My son had a pizza and a mini pizzookie, we were both taken care of in a perfect way and we could not be more thankful!"
Angie M.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",160,1230,4820,3.0,10/25/2011,"I have been to this restaurant more in the past few months, than I think I ever have.  Not sure why... just has ended up that way. The food has been good...  the service, not so much.   I was with a group, two of us arrived and two were late, so we were seated and the waitress was very awkward, and seemed annoyed by us.  We ended up ordering before the rest of the party arrived, so we werent just sitting at a table wasting space.  The others ordered as they arrived. Another time I was with a group of 4 adults and two children and our waitress asked if we needed a few more minutes, we said yes.  She came back after 20 minutes... way longer than anyone needed to decide.  We had asked for boxes for our leftovers 5 different times... so as I said, just not the best service."
Temenah C.,"Anaheim, CA",393,1040,3,3.0,4/23/2013,"So before I was really into the beer scene I would come to BJs and order cocktails. Now that I see the error of my ways (who goes to a brewery to order wine or a cocktail?) I've come to realize why I never ordered beer here. Now, I love that BJs has guest beers but I feel like if I'm at a brewery it's only right to drink the house beer. I tried the Jeremiah Red and it was decent. My bf ordered the IPA and it was not. I know their beers have won tons of awards and the beer market is saturated but there was nothing that made that beer outstanding to me.  Everything else is predictable at BJs. I think the only reason we went here was because my sister lives in BFE in NY and they don't have BJs. So, she and my infant niece (who loves pizza) wanted to come here. Don't ask me how a 9 month old told me she wanted pizza. She did and auntie buckled and took her. That kid owes me one."
Riley W.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",0,4,,5.0,9/24/2016,"Oh where do I begin... My girlfriend and our other dating cohorts went here for our 25th anniversary expecting a wonderful time. BOI were we wrong! To explain this experience I should probably begin with my girlfriend and my friends girlfriend. We all met during the war. No one knows how bad the war really was. Our females were fighting the enemy and got their hair-dos severely injured. My male friend and I were nurses so we met them when they came in for treatment. Luckily, we healed their hair-dos and kindled our relationships there. Now how this all ties in to our experience is, there was no hair in our meal. We appreciated that greatly. Unfortunately that was all we were able to appreciate. The waitress couldn't even spell her own name, she insulted my girlfriend by not knowing how to spell, the ravioli didn't taste like Chef Boyardee, they let some putrid infant cry near our table, and they maintained a rude tone throughout the night. Saying all this, I was delighted that my friend turned out to work here. He's a cool guy. So 10/10 experience. All thanks to him. Wish he was our waiter. Maybe next time.  - 5/28/32 never forget"
Jeremiah T.,"Laguna Hills, CA",40,66,16,1.0,6/26/2014,very unorganized.  I have never been more disappointed with a Bj's.  Corporate needs to take a look at this one.
