Jim L.,"Farmington, MN",774,351,8279,5.0,6/28/2013,"I totally love this place, great staff, super service.  The pizzas, burgers and ribs are all good.  The home-made Root Beer, Cream Soda, Black Cherry and Orange is awesome and all-you-can-drink with free refills!  They also make about 12 beers there and they are fantastic too!  The Pizookie is a giant cookie dessert topped with Ice Cream!  It was delicious!!   I am going back to Minnesota tomorrow but I would definitely come back here again and again.  If I lived here, I would always be here.  I would just have my mail sent there.  LOL"
Jous I.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",24,9,27,1.0,5/31/2015,I don't know if they got a new cook or what but to say the food was just awful not flavor it was just bland. I had the shrimp scampi with grilled chicken in garlic sauce with angel hair pasta. It tasted as if they took the pasta right out of the boiling pot and placed it on my plate. The shrimp and the chicken didn't even taste like garlic. It's was just bland.
Warren C.,"Gardena, CA",458,1141,123,3.0,1/13/2013,"Can't really find too many places to get deep dish style pizza, so I guess for a chain, BJ's does an okay job of that. This particular location does get pretty busy for dinner. Expect a wait on Fridays and weekends. I love the calorie counts next to every item on the menu, the number of items in the quadruple digits makes the dinner feel super guilty!"
Ron M.,"Irvine, CA",246,131,243,3.0,10/28/2015,"Customer service was great, but the prices went WAY up, no warning whatsoever (I'm a regular). Their draft beers almost doubled in price for ""happy hour""!!! Boo (scary high prices, just in time for Halloween???). I've been a regular for years but this just feels like BJs is going the way of Yardhouse and other overpriced chains. Bummer."
Chris H.,"Santa Ana, CA",113,35,3,5.0,7/12/2016,"First, I've never had a bad experience at BJ's. I've been to all the ones in OC and out in the IE and I keep coming back because I know they have consistently served me well. Let me tell you about the first time they made a mistake. I was at this location on Father's Day this year. My dad and I decided to go here because it was close to his house and we both love BJ's food. It wasn't terribly busy and we were seated within 5 minutes. Our waiter was quick to our table to get our drinks order and consistently attentive. I ordered the surf and turf special and my dad got the Mediterranean tacos. When out food came out after a few minutes everything was good except that my steak was cooked well done and not medium rare like I had ordered. It was a big plate of food so I ate around it until I made a comment about it and a manager overheard. He was nice enough to have another order put in for the same plate for us for free. Another whole $22 meal for free. That's next level right there and I was very pleased. The waiter was apologetic and courteous about getting my second meal out. We went on to order a small monkey bread pizzookie after lunch because why the hell not? It came out timely, however they made another ""mistake"" and brought out a regular size one. They gave my dad a commemorative pint glass and we were on our way. They made our day."
Florence H.,"Huntington Beach, CA",94,68,121,1.0,8/2/2014,"Worst BJ's I've ever been to.  They served me wine in a cracked carafe, the waiter apologized and said the next two would be on him.  When he brought the check he only credited me for one. The service was sloooow!!  We were sitting on the outside patio during happy hour, however they don't honor happy hour prices unless you're sitting in the bar.   My boyfriend and I were seated at a table with my sister and her husband.  When ordering dessert, they got theirs but we didn't get ours.  I LIVE for dessert so I was extremely disappointed that the waiter never put in the order. Our relatives on the table next to us had Chardonnay added on their bill even though no one ordered it.  *** DOUBLE CHECK YOUR TAB!! *** I handed my Premier Rewards card along with my credit card when paying the check.  The waiter didn't add in my reward points, so I had to go online to enter it myself.  I don't know if he was just lazy, didn't care, or was new.  In any case, he got a 10% tip from us for the crappy service, and he's lucky he got that much from us since our bill was nearly $100. The only reason this location is getting a star at all is because the food here is good, especially the pizza and the avocado rolls.  So go for the food, but don't expect stellar service from the help."
Brittany M.,"Westminster, CA",19,178,10,3.0,8/3/2014,"I've been here a lot. I live close by and it's convenient. I like BJs menu and the diversity that can be found on it. That being said, this particular BJs does not hit the mark. I've had quite a few meals either be wrong, undercooked, or overcooked. The service is not on point. I've been here when it's been busy and when it's been slow and regardless the service is just not there. Multiple times I've had to track down a waiter or waitress and many times drinks have never been refilled, plates haven't been cleared, etc. I'm not saying the service is /always/ bad, because it isn't. Sometimes it's great. But I'm giving three stars because the good days are few and far between."
Pat R.,"North Olmsted, OH",0,3,,4.0,8/16/2016,"Stopped here while on business travel, I had the steak which was a little on the small side for the price. The asparagus was very good and the mashed potatoes and steak were above average. The beers were excellent. Sat at the bar and there were a few over intoxicated locals there, I thought the staff should have kicked the one guy out but a manager was nowhere to be found. I believe that to have been an isolated incident and would go back."
Jeff L.,"Newport Beach, CA",22,271,2059,2.0,6/9/2013,"So, I have been going to BJ's for years for happy hour, dinner, lunch and even their breakfast is quite good. I think with the expanded menu (even the waiter said ""novel""), they might have lost their way.  We started with the buffalo wings (boned, not boneless) and they were good, 8 pieces, crispy with buffalo and ranch dipping sauce.  We shared the BBQ chicken chopped salad and kept wondering what was wrong with it, their seemed to be bbq sauce, but no ranch or was it Italian - couldn't place it ? I have had good BBQ chopped salads and honestly it was just tasteless, just bland. I couldn't tell what was missing because everything seemed to be there but just bad and a rip off for 14 bucks. I asked the waiter if they changed their menu and he just said, ""no"". !?  The BJs favorite pizza (a staple) was sub par with very few toppings, very dry and kind of doughly. I am used to it being fluffy and bready(light, all be it), but to was just average.  With these 3 items plus lemonade and a tip 50 bucks out the door was just not a good deal - this was lunch. The service was good but everything else..well to be desired."
Erin R.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",2,53,35,2.0,10/19/2015,"I should've listened to these reviews... I always try to give it a chance, despite what others might rate a place.  My husband & I came in w/ our 1 yr old for an early dinner around 4 on a Monday. As soon as we walked in, I smelled that mildew mugginess that people had mentioned here in their reviews. I'm assuming it has to do w/ the restrooms being there by the front doors.... But the smell! What do they clean the restrooms w/?.... A homeless mans shirt? (by the way, there actually was a homeless man sleeping in the side of the restaurant under a tree w/ his shopping cart full of stuff). The hostess was not very inviting or .... Happy? It was 4 in the afternoon, so it wasn't busy at all. We got seated right away. We were starving, so our waitress took our orders first time around. Gave us our waters & didn't see her til our orders came out. We ordered the lemon pepper wings & a large pepperoni & mushroom pizza. Once the food came, we ate. Wings actually didn't taste like they seasoned it at all & the pizza was ok. If you're craving deep dish, it'll do. She never refilled our waters though. Passed our table several times to attend to other tables, but never asked ir checked on us. I think drink refills are important in the restaurant business. Ida customer is dehydrated, they're not gonna continue to eat or stay there."
Carlos M.,"Pacific Beach, San Diego, CA",0,1,,5.0,2/24/2015,"Awesome time last night at the BJ's/Rogue beer dinner! Tim the host and manager always is so welcoming and inviting. I feel like he is always just making sure everyone is taken care of and enjoying themselves! Extremely knowledgable on all the beer pairings and styles. Good time! Definitely recommend everyone going to the next one! Make  reservations, they fill up quick!"
Robert F.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",0,50,50,3.0,11/27/2015,"Been here many times and belong to their BJ's FREQUENT FLYER PROGRAM. The menu gets a few changes, once in a while, to keep it exciting. Anytime a football game is on, it's Happy Hour. I'm a coleslaw aficionado and can name many hot spots with killer slaw, this isn't one. As an example, Bonefish Grill (Tustin) has refreshing slaw, Woody's Boathouse (Lake Arrowhead Village) and even El Polo Loco."
Carol H.,"Irvine, CA",0,5,,2.0,1/31/2016,"I am writing this reveiw based on the service.  I have worked in the restraunt industry for many years as a waitress during my youth and feel that attentiveness and friendliness is very key for servers to provide a great experience for their guests. I come here and eat on various occassions, and feel that every time I come the service is usually below average.  If the server is not ready to be sat hosts should be aware and not sit tables where the server does not appear for at least 10 minutes.  I feel rushed when I order many times, and feel it usually always  takes awhile for refills, as well as the food to be out on the table.  The food is usually tasty, and of course I love the pazookies!  Maybe if Bj's took some time training their servers to be more professional this place would receive 5 stars!"
Colin E.,"Santa Clarita, CA",137,28,18,5.0,5/29/2016,"went to bjs last night and the service was swell. we asked to change the channel on the tv to watch a different game and they did it with no problem. i got the chicken alfredo and it was amazing. i ordered it woth put broccoli and had no problem there, i dont think anyone i was with had any problems with there food. the parking was great and id be glad to go back again. overall rating 10/10"
Daniel P.,"Lake Forest, CA",0,38,1,3.0,7/6/2016,"The food here is always delicious, and definitely worthy of 5 stars. The service, however, usually leaves something to be desired. Most servers are ok, but the food here takes a ridiculous amount of time to arrive after ordering. Since this is a pretty consistent thing, I blame this on poor management. About a year ago, we ordered curbside take out and it took them an extra 20 minutes past their quoted pick up time to bring it out despite us being there a few minutes early. Today, I had another terrible experience. As usual, it took a while for us to receive our food, but this was expected. A few bites into my first cup of endless soup, our waiter asks how everything is and I ask for a second bowl of soup. About 15 minutes later, the waiter checks on us again and I ask him to confirm that my soup is still on the way. He comes back a few minutes later saying that they ran out of tortilla soup and had to make a new batch, which was the reason for the delay. I figure one of two things happened: 1) he forgot to put in the order for my 2nd soup and made up an excuse that makes him look like the good guy or 2) the kitchen management is terrible because they both ran out of soup and didn't inform their wait staff that there would be a delay. Additionally, it took another 15 plus minutes after asking for the check despite me having my credit card ready to hand over once he brought the bill. Bottom line: Come for the food if you have time to spare, don't come here if you want quick, efficient service."
Nicholas H.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",14,11,11,5.0,10/24/2015,"I'll start off by saying that we don't usually come here often, but we decided to have a family night out.  We came here for dinner on a Saturday night and the food was outstanding. Even though it was slammed, the staff still provided friendly service with a smile.  I don't remember the young lady that helped us, but she was great - attentive and polite.  I just had to leave a review because the food and the service was awesome!"
Anne M.,"San Clemente, CA",5,53,58,4.0,9/29/2015,Food was good. Service was awesome. Had one horrible beer and one really good one. But overall a pretty good time and experience at BJs!
Patrick R.,"Mission Viejo, CA",13,3,,3.0,5/9/2015,"Friendly service,  good food, but slow.  How slow?Expect it to take 45 mins to get food from the time you sit down."
Jenny Y.,"Irvine, CA",168,152,676,3.0,6/22/2012,"This is a pretty good BJ's. I think it tends to be slightly less busy than the BJ's in Tustin/Irvine, so you might have less wait time. The food and service is pretty much the same across both locations, so no real difference there. BJ's used to be our go-to place for big group dinners, but we've kind of gotten over it recently. They only take reservations for 12 people or more, and if you do have that big a party, you're usually seated outside and in my experience, the service has been pretty average/below-average out there. You might have two waiters serving you, but they tend to avoid checking on big parties and it takes a long time to get their attention if you need something. If your party is less than 12, I think you can find a better place for your dinner.  We came here on a Wednesday night with 7 people and were told that it was about a 45 minute wait, but it ended up only taking 20 minutes, which was nice. Unfortunately, we were squeezed into a booth that is really made for 4 people so we were kind of cramped and uncomfortable the entire night. I'm not really sure why they thought 7 people could fit into a 4-people booth, so watch out for that.  The food is always the same at BJ's - good selection of burgers, sandwiches, pizzas, pasta, salads and entree dishes. The food is good, but tends to be high in salt and calories. Portion sizes are pretty big, so you might want to get a dish and share or else save half for later. I've always been a fan of their pizzas - I usually get the Classic Combo w/ pepperoni, sausage & mushrooms, or the BBQ Chicken Pizza w/ BBQ sauce, red onions, tomatos, cilantro and BBQ chicken. For pasta, I've tried the Grilled Chicken Pasta, which is good but really it's just your typical pasta you can find anywhere. They have some good lunch specials that are much more affordable, so if you can find time to go during lunch, I'd recommend that.  Recently, they have a new section on their menu called ""EnLIGHTened Entrees"" with dishes all under 575 calories. I've been experimenting more with this menu and so far I like what I've tried! I've tried the Mediterranean Vegetable Pasta, which comes with roasted vegetables, sun-dried tomatoes, capers and Kalamata olives and is topped with pine nuts, basil, Parmesan cheese and parsley. It's a nice, light combination that fills you up. I've also tried the Hawaiian Mahi Mahi which is served with roasted pineapple fried rice, snow peas, red bell peppers and sesame seeds. I am definitely a fan of the Mahi Mahi - perfect portion size, great mix of flavors, and the fish is delicious! It was a little dry but it still tasted really good, and I left feeling a lot better than my friends who ate 1,500 calorie burgers.  Of course they're known for their pizookies, so don't leave without getting one for dessert. My favorite is the oreo cookie or oatmeal raisin pizookie."
John G.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",0,1,,1.0,5/17/2015,"Empty glasses, cold food, salad after dinner. I have had many great experiences in my travels - this location is not one of them!"
