Natalie H.,"Laguna Hills, CA",0,5,,2.0,6/26/2016,I normally have a good experience at this restaurant but the kitchen staff must have been having a terrible night. We ordered the rib appetizer and a salad. The ribs came out with little meat on the bone and the salad drenched in dressing. We returned the food and the ribs came out ok but then there was a hair in my salad. Kinda lost my appetite after that. Even the guy next to us ordered a steak that came out rare when he asked for it medium. Once they fixed his problem he returned it and said it was the worst steak he has had. Not a good night for this restaurant. The wait staff was great and they didn't charge us for the food. We paid for our drinks and went and grabbed burgers. Don't know if I'll be heading back after pulling an 7 inch hair out of my mouth.
Shauna M.,"Irvine, CA",0,1,,1.0,7/17/2016,"I have been there twice now and both times the food was horrible. I went on Saturday there and ordered boneless wings and if was bland, hard, and smelled funny. The waiter had an attitude. I will never eat there again. Plus the website says one thing and u go in and you find out they don't have what you want. I am surprised it has lasted this long when there are better restaurants that are closing their doors. This place should go away. The BJ's in Laguna hills is the worse. Don't go here and the one in Tustin if you want your food cold and an hour later go there. Boooo!!! I give you a rate of -100 as a score!"
Mai T.,"Orange County, CA",30,37,2,1.0,4/5/2015,"Bad service.  Came here for lunch and we were waiting to be seated, but the host ignored the party and continued to finish her conversation with a co-worker.  Don't order the ribeye because it's more of a sirloin.  Food did not have any taste and very bland.  Definitely will not recommend or be back."
John B.,"Ladera Ranch, CA",6,3,,1.0,5/31/2015,"Went today for lunch, service was absolutely terrible we were even waiting by the front door to be seated with several staff standing around before even acknowledging us. Waiter took forever to come and take our order but took everyone's around us. We ordered the deep dish BJ's pizza it was okay but it was cold and took what seemed like a half an hour to get to us they didn't clear the plates from the salads so our already small table grew even smaller, and my wifes ice tea was never refilled and sat empty for the remainder of the meal. We later began having nuesea Needless to say my wife and I will not be coming back and hope others read this review and heed my warning to not eat at this establishment unless your wanting to be treated terribly and get sick from the food then by all means eat here."
Jeff S.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",104,152,36,1.0,7/29/2015,"Restaurants overall I would give a 3 1/2 star rating. This location it's a one based on the service and the food. Starting with the drinks. The beer came out warm and flat. It seems as though it was sitting at the bar for about four minutes before it was brought to the table. This made the beer not a very pleasant drink and I ask the server to have it replaced The food. For a party of seven, two of the items came out were in edible. The thin crust pizza was called in the steak was rare when ordered medium.  The server took the food to the back and brought it out after being cooked some more. The pizza was now as hard as a cracker and jokingly, I balanced a knife on one side while holding the other and it did not bend or break. The steak was still cooked rare. The server brought out some french fries to hold us over while the food is a remade. These were also overcooked and taste burnt. They were darker than the other french fries on the table from another order. The server was friendly and you can tell she was genuinely embarrassed about the chaos that was going on with the kitchen and the bar Overall the restaurant get to one, food gets a one, it's one, server gets a three which equals a one star for this place"
Leia A.,"Mission Viejo, CA",2,81,,5.0,10/6/2015,"Came in for lunch with a girlfriend and we were greeted with Taylor. It wasn't even 11 yet and there were 6 tables, people sitting at the bar. Taylor was the biggest sweetheart! She was so friendly, sweet, knows her menu in and out. She didn't look stressed at all continued having a smile on her face and was working so hard. Thank you Taylor for an amazing experience!! We will definitely come back and sit in your section! You are a gem!"
Chris J.,"King City, CA",11,14,1,3.0,12/29/2015,"The chicken was delicious. The cookie ice cream was tasty. They needed more staff the night we were there. December 26, 2015. But the food was great!"
Kevin M.,"Lake Forest, CA",293,51,11,5.0,8/20/2014,"Gotta say, I have never been disappointed till the last time I went and got curbside service. They forgot part of our order and I spent 20$ on their one appetizer dish. However, the manager went above and beyond to help us out again. With excellent service from all waiters and waitresses the only suggestion is to smile a little more! :)  Fantadtic food as always ad great lunch specials!"
Cole M.,"Costa Mesa, CA",2,22,,1.0,5/19/2015,Wow I have never been so surprised to have such bad service. This place had a 25 minute wait time at 10pm on a Tuesday! They said they didn't have enough coverage for the tables. Absolutely ridiculous.
Kevin T.,"Mission Viejo, CA",183,11,8,2.0,6/17/2014,Its been an hour since we ordered and sat and no food has come out. Wish the server would have updated us or offered some compensation.
Diana O.,"San Juan Capistrano, CA",114,25,56,1.0,5/10/2015,"The service was horrible, we asked three different waiters to refill out drink and no one came until we had to leave towards the end."
Lia P.,"Mission Viejo, CA",1,11,2,1.0,10/30/2015,"So, I am at the BJ's Laguna Hills mall sitting at the bar as I type, one of the bartenders accidentally dropped a glass behind the bar and two pieces bounced up and over the bar and landed on my lap. There was also another piece that landed on the draft beer drain area, and a few shards that flew to the floor. The amazing thing is the bartenders said there is no mat behind the counter. If there were a mat, it would have absorbed the shock and lessen the chance of glass flying everywhere. The manager just came over and I told him what happened, all he offered was an ""apology""...and a scripted one at that! Having been in the customer care industry in various capacities for 30+ years, I could have written a better one myself. The poor guys/bartenders working behind the counter were much more apologetic and sincere then the ""manager."" If I were not for them, I would cross BJ's off my list!!!"
Rob W.,"Lake Forest, CA",1,18,,1.0,10/29/2015,"I arrived at lunch 12:50 and sat in the bar at a table. After 50 minutes of never being approached by a server. ""Had to get up and go to the bar twice to get a glass of wine"". I asked for a manager...Robert Wardell shows up and offers nothing. In fact, did nothing except have a waitress come by for an order. Seriously...that location needs to go back to the basics of restaurant operations and training. Thinking any restaurant one off or chain NEEDS to understand SERVICE! Sad"
Sean S.,"Tustin, CA",2,12,6,2.0,8/20/2015,Everything was great until I received my food. I order the same thing every time California flatbread no tomatoes blackened chicken. When my flatbread came out it had tomatoes and I asked for it to be adjusted. Food runner did not seem happy and my food came back a minute later. Flatbread was covered in ranch and could still see some of the tomatoes that were scrapped off. Server never asked anything till the end of meal. I was a server at a corporate resteraunt and rarely say anything but this was ridiculous.
Vy N.,"Lake Forest, CA",1,31,,2.0,2/21/2014,"The food is good, atmosphere is good. Unfortunately, service is terrible. They always seem to be understaffed or not well-managed.  We used to go to the Huntington Beach location all the time until we moved closer to this location and were sorely disappointed with the service at this place. We kept trying this place once every few months hoping they would have a new manager so the service could get better, but no such luck. So 4 stars for the food, drink, atmosphere, -2 for the service; therefore, the generous 2 star rating."
Brian M.,"Laguna Hills, CA",3,185,1,3.0,8/9/2015,Nice huge restaurant. Menu though large is limited in the heathy selections. I do not like deep dish and the thin crust tastes more like matzo crackers softened. Beer selection seems small for a brewery. Or maybe I didn't see the whole menu for beers. Mediterranean pizza was salty from the Kalimata. Had major gas next day from the pizza.
Joe L.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,16,11,5.0,8/7/2014,Great happy hour great pizza and lots of beer on tap. Come here all the time for happy hour only.
David E.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",38,843,,3.0,6/15/2014,This is a 3.0 or 3.5 chain eatery depending on what you order.  I would never sniff a pizza here but for sandies and salads I wouldn't turn up my nose.  I haven't tried the beer in ages but likely will since I'm trying every porter or stout (other than bitter Imperial ones) I can get my hands on. I had a BBQ CHICKEN SALAD and it was pretty good.  You won't compare it to Tender Greens but for variety and proximity it is just fine.  The service was good and the look and feel here is a little nicer than the one I recall from my old hood. Unfortunately we have so many dining options in the OC this is the first time I've made it here in the 7 + years I've lived here.  We'll see if I can get back here in less than another 7 + years.   :)
Cathy S.,"Newport Beach, CA",651,230,1788,4.0,12/23/2011,"HURRY and get your Grand Cru while it lasts! They don't normally release the Grand Cru until 12/31, but not this year!!! Served to you in a really cool Grand Cru glass too!  As quoted by Brewed for Thought  Just love the BJ's Favorite PIzza ~ The Works! Oven-baked meatballs, pepperoni, Italian sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, black olives, white onions and seasoned tomatoes. Quoted from their menu.  Also had their Spinach & Artichoke Pizza ~ A rich, creamy medley of spinach, artichoke hearts, cream cheese and mozzarella topped with our fresh tomato basil blend and Parmesan cheese. Quoted from their menu.  Seriously some good for little moola during Happy Hour!   You can become VERY happy here!  Service at the bar - 5 Stars! Ambiance - 4 Stars - like the ones in NoCal better... Food - 4 Stars - yummy for the tummy!"
Sandra Y.,"Dana Point, CA",1,5,,1.0,11/15/2015,"My Daughter and I stopped in at BJ's after an appt. in Laguna Hills on Friday.  I had never been there before and she had only been once for Happy Hour.  First, let me be clear, I love eating in restaurants...would eat out 3 times a day if I could afford it... and I didn't gain weight! I will never return to this restaurant(?)!  We both ordered the luncheon special:  a southern fried chicken breast/gravy, mashed potatoes, corn succotash, with a side wedge salad.  The wedge salad was unlike any I had ever had.  It had a runny blue cheese-like dressing, chopped white onions (rather than green), no chopped egg, and...worst of all...when I cut into mine, I discovered the big core of lettuce attached! The main entrée wasn't much better...the mashed potatoes and succotash were good; however, the piece of whatever part of the chicken on top was uneatable!  I tried to cut into the tiny thing trying to find an eatable bite, to no avail.  It actually resembled the tail of the chicken, coated, and deep-fried.  My Daughter's looked about the same. My Daughter paid for the meal and I didn't call for the Manager as I didn't want to embarrass her...if she wasn't with me, believe me I would have!  My Daughter did advise the waitress of the poor piece of chicken, but she totally ignored the complaint as if she couldn't care less.  It had to be one of the worst meals I have ever been served in a restaurant."
