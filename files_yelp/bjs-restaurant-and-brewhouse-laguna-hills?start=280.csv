Phoenix A.,"Seattle, WA",921,737,37,2.0,1/9/2012,"Ok!  Starting '12 off with a raving review! I am officially over BJs, not because their food sucks or the service is bad.  It's just that what was a once a special lil' pizza place in the Belmont Shore has now morphed into some off-clone of The Cheesecake Factory or that glutton's paradise, The Claim Jumper. I came here over the holidays and the place was packed.  One very nice thing that they did while we were waiting was pass around an appetizer tray of little pizza bites.  That was way cool. We ordered a calamari appetizer, the bf ordered the angus beef sliders with fries, his bro got the chili, and I was only one who ordered pizza, which was a mini BJ's Favorite.   Prior to food, I ordered the 8 beer flight.  The taster glasses were the largest I had ever been served.  They were so large I had to share.  Unheard of, right?  That's one of the 2 stars right there.  The rest?  A big MEH. Our service was fine if not excellent, but there was a chorus of: 1) I never have to eat here again, 2) Yeah, I'm not really fan, I was just being polite, and 3) who picked this place. So, sorry, BJs.  There are just so many more appealing options out there.  You were once great, but it's time for me to remember you for just that."
John T.,"Lake Forest, CA",29,4,,1.0,4/18/2014,good beer horrible food. I had the Southern Fried Chicken that was awful. the chicken was fried in oil that had the burnt taste of rancid oil. Waitress delivered wrong food twice to my wife.  they have a long way to go before I return for anything but a drink. what a waste of money
Kas C.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",97,24,,2.0,12/30/2013,"Their food tastes average (think something like TGI Friday's or Cheesecake Factory), but I do like the drinks BJ serves, especially their hand-crafted root beer is the best! But this review is about my last experience there.  I ordered their root beer like I always do, along with a couple appetizers and a pizza. Well, at the end of my meal, the bottom of the root beer glass broke off and root beer spilled ALL OVER my lap. The manager came over and explained to me that every now and then the glasses crack when somebody puts a warm glass inside the fridge. Uhh okay, so why do your employees keep putting warm glasses in the refrigerator if this is a common occurrence?  I am giving 2 stars because she deducted the pizza from our check, however she did not apologize for the situation, only deducted the pizza and nothing else from our check (not even the root beer!).  The only reason I am unsatisfied with that, is because I went to Ritz Carlton one time, and the server accidentally spilled wine in my lap. The manager came over, apologized profusely, and deducted our ENTIRE $300 check. At BJ's, you only get a $20 pizza deducted from your bill, and not even the root beer that the caused the whole fiasco in the first place.  And don't give me that crap about Ritz Carlton being a more expensive and upscale restaurant. BJ's is PACKED every time I enter this restaurant, so I KNOW they MUST be making more money than Ritz Carlton at times.  So, only 2 stars from me."
Sharon O.,"Newport Beach, CA",0,47,2,1.0,4/6/2015,"This BJ's location used to be one of our favorite restaurants but last night will be our last visit.  The beer was good but that was about it.  Terrible service - three appetizers were delivered quickly, but at the exact same time as the entrees! They did offer us free dessert for the mistake but the food was so bad that we declined. The steak was tough and tasteless, the fish tacos were very low on fish and the pasta was not good. We just wanted to get out and not come back. Time to find a new family restaurant."
Tahera C.,"Mission Viejo, CA",508,25,29,2.0,12/29/2013,I love bjs but don't come when they're busy. The service goes down the drain. I give the 2 starts for location because the mixed drinks are not strong and the jip you on the amount.  Not very satisfied at all.
Christine B.,"Lake Forest, CA",0,12,,1.0,6/3/2016,Super disappointing! The service just seems to decline every time we visit this location even though we are always hopeful for a good experience! Really really slow service!
Steven S.,"Irvine, CA",0,4,1,1.0,10/18/2015,"Run fast and Go somewhere else. The service at this BJ's is the worst, and I mean worst service we have ever experienced at the numerous BJ's and the manager was not much better. Waited over 30 minutes without one person stopping by our table and we where in the bar section watching football on Sunday morning. How is that even possible? Don't watch football here, no sound on games, the had blank screens for 15 minutes (could be more though we finally just left). Drive the extra distance and go to the Tustin location if you want to eat at BJ's. We will never go here again."
Hari N.,"Mountain View, CA",71,31,1,1.0,12/21/2013,Food was pretty good but service was pretty bad. The waitress was not happy with our 10% tip (because the initial service was mediocre) and pretty much threw a doggie bag at us when we asked to take home the leftovers.  Me and friends were appalled at her behavior. We would never visit this place again.
Tragedy D.,"Orange County, CA",102,176,176,2.0,10/18/2013,"Today's visit was a bit disappointing: We were seated at a small booth right away. + The menus were sticky. - Greeted by server...10 minutes later. - Ordered our drinks, appetizer, and entrées; server went out of his way to check on a certain dish (unfortunately it's no longer available even though we used to order it and it wasn't on the menu then either). + Salad came to the table quickly but not our drinks; had to ask the person who delivered the food to check on our drinks. - The avocado egg rolls were tasty but the presentation could use improvement. Six rolls vastly separated around the sauce bowl. (Tip to BJ's: use a smaller plate or put another 2 egg rolls to the plate.) + The server came by our table to inform us they were out of baked potato. (Tip to BJ's: please communicate with staff. The customers need to know before/when ordering a meal if their side or main dish is not available.) - Main courses were great: Steaks with horseradish mashed potatoes. The sprinkling of the parsley around the plate is unnecessary; if you've ever watched 'Kitchen Nightmares with Chef Gordon Ramsey,' you'd be scared of plates with parsley scattered all over the plate. No need to decorate/garnish the plate with all the wasted parsley because the food should be the art. + The main reason for heading to BJ's was for dessert: bring on the pizookie!!! We asked to see the menu so we could see the choices and the server just stood there. He said there was no need for it and recited the options from memory; impressive but come on, you really aren't going to give us a menu and a minute to decide? Talk about pressure. - He asked us if we needed a to-go box and said he'll be right back. But about 10 minutes later our dessert arrived and the guy  asked if we wanted a box. I told him that our server was getting one but never came back. The guy was really kind and brought back a box and also cleared our stacked up dishes. + I like how the rest of the servers try to pick up the slack of your main server. My generous tip was for everyone combined. However, if I had to give a single tip to our main server, I would have given the minimum. This location has slowly gone downhill. Kind of reminds me of the gradual decline of Black Angus. At least this time, we weren't seated by a hostess with incredibly horrible foot odor."
Holland M.,"Irvine, CA",3,29,3,1.0,5/2/2016,"I was really disappointed with the Management here. I was dining at BJs on Saturday night, and our party left the table, were gone for 5 minutes in the bathroom, and on our way out, I realized I had left a present on the table. I ran back for it, saw the busboy cleaning up, and it was GONE! The busboy denied seeing it. I had several waiters searching for it, along with both managers. They searched through the trash, through the dirty dishes, etc and nobody could find it anywhere! Mind you - I was only away from the table for 5 minutes, and there were staff watching my table - and the only person who went to the table during that 5 minutes was 1 busboy. So - they never found it - and the one manager was really defensive about it, saying that his staff never steal, etc. But he refused to search that busboy's locker.  I just didn't think the flow from the Manager was appropriate at all."
Sonja J.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",0,7,1,3.0,7/13/2015,"Came here for HH, BJs craft beers $4 on tap. Would recommend the hefeweizen (I usually order a pilsner).  Got the strawberry mojito, ($5) and it was disappointing (but was it? How much can you expect from a BJs?) Had to muddle the few sliced of strawberries and ~4 whole mint leaves that came in it myself. It also left an artificially sweet aftertaste I was not a fan of."
Court D.,"Yucaipa, CA",5,43,15,1.0,2/11/2015,Gave them a second try for lunch and they STILL suck! At least 10-15 minutes to get a drink and 45 minutes for food. Horrible service in the bar yet again. Only good thing was the food does taste good and it comes out hot. The table next to us (same server) left their half empty drinks and walked out.
Ryan P.,"Fullerton, CA",143,324,24,4.0,12/13/2011,"My only experience with BJ's has been in Brea and was not good. This location was much better as it not in close proximity to loud, obnoxious college students, but as other people have pointed out, the service leaves something to be desired. I don't know where the server went at the end of our meal. My grandma and I wanted to pay the bill and this guy was missing in action. We had to go up front and then they had to find him, which I didn't understand. I was thinking, why do they have to find him to settle our bill? (-1 star) I'd definitely come back though. The ambiance is really modern and cool, the food was good and I like how they give you the caloric information. I don't like deep dish pizza because I think it's a carbohydrate overdose, but they have an extensive menu with even flatbread pizzas and a very impressive beer list."
Kendale H.,"Addison, TX",5,36,17,1.0,12/9/2013,"Service was absolutely terrible!  I swear we had three different waiters throughout our dinner.  The first one was so slow in getting our drink and food order.  Took 15 minutes to bring back some water! One person had to ask three different time for her drink and it finally arrived after our boss went to the bar and ordered it. No idea where our first waiter went, just disappeared! Different waiter took our food order finally, and it took 45 min to come out.  My food was ok, but it was undercooked and at this point I was too hungry to care. One guy in our party didn't even get his food and had to flag down a passing waiter to find out where it was. We finally got a good waiter towards the end of our meal and the poor guy had to go around and rewrite everything we ordered to make our tickets.  Apparently large parties (we had 10) confuse the staff."
Koosha A.,"Laguna Hills, CA",0,13,,1.0,1/18/2015,"I went there for my birthday and although I had my id with me, they wouldn't serve me beer. So ridiculous"
Catherine P.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",213,153,161,4.0,3/3/2014,"The buffalo chicken pizza is DELICIOUS!! OMG. It's something about the crust that's so scrumptious! It's thick crust, but the bottom is buttery and flakey and the dough is always cooked amazingly. This pizza is a must try for sure.  The happy hour is awesome too. Great selection of house beers. We sat in the bar and the service was blah, nothing special...that's why I only gave it 4 stars. Sometimes the servers here can be so overwhelmed (or seem like it) and they just stand around and talk to each other. So that means they don't really talk to you.  Oh, and the fact their wedge salad is not that impressive. The blue cheese dressing was like, watered down or something. Yuck. I didn't appreciate that at all. But I'm telling you, most of the other stuff I've tried on their menu has been great and the pizzas are absolutely delicious!!"
Kimber D.,"Irvine, CA",96,5,,3.0,6/24/2014,"Pizza was amazing as always, no matter how many toppings you get in every bite the crust is always fluffy dankness.  The beer is super cold and delicious.  The service here is always hit and miss, usually it's okay but nothing out standing or worthy of an amazing tip. Seems as if they don't care or are to busy to.  Apparently they were out of the mini size of pizza today, not sure how that even happens but it did tonight."
Daniel C.,"Huntington Beach, CA",37,3,,4.0,9/16/2015,"Great food with a vast selection. Only con from today's visit was the waiter wrote down the wrong appetizer. However, the customer service was on point and would recommend it to those who like micro brewers and a wide food selection."
Lee A.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",9,18,11,2.0,10/11/2013,"This place......such a shame how it sucks in service. I'm never happy when I pay for my meal At bj's. No matter which restaurant I go to they all suck. I've had me pasta served Undercooked, stiff and Un eatable 2x and they take it back and expect my wife just to wait until I get my meal back. Terrible!  Last time they comped or meal cause of this. It was amazing I got my pasta 2x in that same visit with the same consistency, I won't be going back here."
Jackie T.,"Long Beach, CA",43,17,37,5.0,10/16/2013,"So when I first walked in, I was greeted by all the workers. They took my name down then immediately sat me down in a nice big comfy booth. My server came by and introduced himself (Felipe) and took our drink order. Usually places take a while to bring us out drinks but it came out within that minute. Since we ordered the 2 for 20 special he took our appetizer order so I ordered the chicken tortilla soup and my guest had ordered the salad. The food runner brought me my soup and brought her the salad. Right on track, my server came to check on us. Everything was tasting great . Then he came back took our empty plates out of our way and took our pizza order. He was very helpful on making our pizza the way we both like it and made it half and half. Shortly after that it arrived, looking just as it tasted: amazing. He gave us our plates and put a slice on both our plates so we didn't burn our hands (which was a first at all BJ'a for me!!). Also without me even having to ask he brought us both refills! After we were done with the pizza he handed us a box an since we both wanted different pazooke's  he brought us 2 mini ones. I never even knew they could do that! He was so helpful an then he brought us that soon after. What a nice touch on the meal! Super filling! Then he thanked us and handed us our check. All in all, I had a great meal ( shout out to the cooks!! Meal was amazing!!). And the service was outstanding, I don't think I've had better service. Great job BJ's on your employees. You really do a great job, and a big thank you to my server who provided excellent service and actually looked like he loved his job and cares about his customers! You don't get that now a days. Thank you again, Jackie."
