Rohlin A.,"Mission Viejo, CA",174,801,3655,1.0,7/5/2011,"This was one of the worst experiences I have had at a restaurant.  We went to this location on the 4th of July for dinner with my two stepchildren and their friend.  The service seemed a little slow considering they weren't especially busy.  We ordered one speciality calzone, one traditional calzone, a french dip sandwich and two personal pizzas.  I also tried the black cherry soda the restaurant makes. For starters, the black cherry soda was okay.  It is no Dr. Brown's.  Can't really comment on the food taste, didn't eat any of it.  The specialty calzone was burnt on the bottom.  Where is the quality control?  I am not talking dark brown or burnt in one area, the whole bottom was burnt.  The calzones were very small compared to other restaurants.  The personal pizzas were ordered as white pizzas with alfredo sauce.  The pizzas were supposedly brushed with alfredo sauce which no one could taste.  The manager basically blamed the people who ordered the food for the error, only offered to take the calzone off the bill and had offered to remake the three entrees.  What exactly were the other two people supposed to do for ten minutes while the other orders are being remade?  By the time the manager had ""resolved"" the situation, my calzone was cold. Needless to say, we left without paying and will not be returning.  Horrible experience."
John M.,"Lake Forest, CA",1,7,,4.0,7/2/2015,"Attentive service. Great selection. Well prepared food. A bit too noisy, but it fits the vibe."
Smorga M.,"Mission Viejo, CA",38,397,307,2.0,11/4/2013,If you are between the ages of 18 to 25 then yes this place is for you.  No offense intended at all. If you are looking for good food and a dining experience then this is NOT the place for you. Average service.  A bit too slow for me.  Sticky table tops which equals germs. Noise level higher than most places.  Food is average to below average.
Andrew W.,"Gardena, CA",0,12,,2.0,8/17/2014,"I have been to this particular restaurant in the past and the food was somewhat good. Today I ordered the Mahi tacos and the shrimp scampi and both of these meals were less than enjoyable. The Mahi tacos tasted like fish sticks that suffered freezer burn and overcooking.  The scampi had way to much garlic and didn't taste fresh. In a positive note, the avocado rolls were delicious and I would def recommend."
Lourdes O.,"Capistrano Beach, CA",0,6,3,5.0,4/28/2016,"Always a great place to have a nice family dinner. Great service every time. The food is delicious and well priced, come here all the time. For sure get a pazooki for dessert."
Adam N.,"Cypress, CA",321,354,267,3.0,2/13/2014,"Good old BJ's. I'll keep it simple: get the pizza. Any pizza, they are all good. Pasta sucks, beer is great, burgers are good. Sooo, pizza and beer is the name of the game for this place. I swear, if you don't make Alfredo from scratch it's garbage. Same case here along with a dozen other places in the area. Oh well, great white pizza for days!"
Lindsay B.,"Cary, NC",1,37,8,4.0,8/10/2014,"I have been coming to this location for years, and am a big fan. They get very crowded, but the wait usually isn't too bad. The servers are extremely nice and helpful.  On my most recent visit I came with my family on Saturday night. Three of us eat gluten free (two of us have an allergy) and the fourth does not eat gluten free. I made it very clear that I have an allergy to gluten and cannot eat it, so I ordered a burger wrapped in lettuce. Their fries share a fryer with breaded items, so they are not gluten free (luckily the server knew this), so I got a side salad. The server was also educated about what salad dressings contain gluten. There was some sort of mix up in the kitchen though because my burger came out with bun, but we pointed out the mistake and they quickly fixed it. The waitress came over and apologized then the manager came over and apologized as well.  They don't have the most gluten free options, but they do have pretty solid selections (including GF pizzas and pizookies - both delicious)! The wait staff is very aware of gluten and how to handle gluten allergies, maybe the kitchen staff just needs a little more training. Overall, I love BJ's and it remains one of my regular spots!"
Paul A.,"Anaheim, CA",394,1075,513,4.0,11/3/2011,"this may contain a contradiction, the four stars and what is about tobe written, but here it goes...I found a Hair in food today of the black curly type... Here is where this takes a turn, I took that item and its surrounding food out and then ate the salad...I am sure the rest of the salad was fine. when I pointed out the ""quality control"" issue the server apologized and the manager delivered our bill with a free salad- this wasnt necessary and although a kind gesture, it was not complete, because I am sure my guests matching meal was concocted, no pun intended, in the same bowl... I do love this place and the happy hour is the best."
Joy L.,"Long Beach, CA",195,33,16,3.0,12/22/2014,"Great food, and the servers were nice. However, the hosts/hostesses at the entrance need a better way to keep track of the parties who are waiting. There were multiple parties under the same name and party size, and they had no way of knowing who was first."
Kelsey S.,"Philadelphia, PA",121,9,2,1.0,8/3/2015,"First time ever coming here and having a horrible experience, well bad experience. From being seated to the check. When being seated we were seated at a table that still has water and food on it, plus a fork underneath, so I asked to sit at the table next to it. No one came to clean the table or grab the fork. And another group was seated there and stated 'oh there's a fork here.' We ordered our appetizer, chicken potstickers, and wanted to order our meal but our server just walked off to input the order. So we sat and waited. Once getting out potstickers both my cousin and I were so excited yet very disappointed as soon as we bit into them. They were cold and the plates were dirty. So we returned them and asked for a new set. Well out main course came out before we got our new order of potstickers. We were told 'they were given to a different table.' Out main courses were delicious and great temperature. But then again once we got our potstickers, they were cold again. Plus on top of it all I had to ask for a refill on my water that had been gone before my meal arrived. Then when refilling our waters our server almost spilt the whole pitcher on my cousin. Also I overheard the table next to us (dirty table) return one of there meals because a tomato bisque was brought out and not chili.  So did our server piss off the kitchen? Was he just not having a good day? Or was someone screwing with him?  Either way misfortunate events happen. But I'm still butt-hurt about my potstickers. We were SO excited. I'm sad that it was such a bad experience."
Rachel H.,"Ladera Ranch, CA",745,954,13280,1.0,5/26/2013,Our server smelled like cigarettes our food was undercooked and the manager really didn't care about the situation and was kinda rude. We won't be back and that saddens me as I've been coming here for a long time.
Rani D.,"FOOTHILL RANCH, CA",19,48,2,2.0,3/15/2014,"Beer = A- Avocado egg rolls = A Deep dish pizza = D- Pizookie = A So can you tell me why this place is famous for its cheese less, sauce less, pile of goopy dough as a deep dish pizza even considers it in their name?   Service was ok. Not horrible, not great. I keep getting reminded on the once a year I get invited here, why I avoid this place. Way better Chicago style pizzerias close by for much less, better quality, and service that you feel appreciated.  BJS, you sold out to corporate America."
Court A.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",83,19,3,4.0,1/16/2014,"Sometimes it's really really hard to find a decent server in the bar section of a restaurant, it's busy and loud and crowded. Not the case at this BJs, the food is always good and comes out timely, and the service is phenomenal. Michael is a great server, I ore ordered a drink for when mine ran out and he was PERFECT on his timing. I was finishing my last gulp and started looking for him and there he was with a new drink already. This is my go to BJs in the area, I recommend to everyone!!!"
Bmango R.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",0,10,,2.0,1/15/2015,"Usually get deep dish pizzas here because they are some of the best and usually consistent.  Last night though I decided to mix it up and try their Chicken Alfredo, which I do not recommend in the least bit.  Flat taste and chicken is grilled and just thrown in with the boring Alfredo sauce and pasta.  Chicken really needs to soak up flavors of the sauce and not be so dry.  Sauce was the main problem, Alfredo when done right and from scratch is mind blowing but I'm thinking they went cheap on this and wondering if this was this some sort of frozen deal? We had a new menu appetizer, some sort of Mexican French fry deep dish concoction, that too I would not recommend. Wife got usual chicken salad which in my mind doesn't look appetizing.   Service was really poor last night. Server never came by for drink refills so we only had our original empty drink on the table the whole time.  He also took way to long for check.  Nice guy, but really stressed out because he had too many tables while so many other  employees were just standing around in bar area. Hard to justify a return trip."
Craig N.,"Newport Beach, CA",0,17,,2.0,8/30/2013,A very sloppy experience.  I am very sad to write this review. Raw chicken with blood showing through.  Then they served us raw doughy pizza to replace the raw chicken. This place is not going to last unless they make major changes. I used to really enjoy eating at BJ's.  not any more.  I will never go back there.
Jesus S.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",49,12,2,1.0,11/8/2014,"Worst dining experience of my life.  The service was atrocious.  I've given this place 3 opportunities and all 3 times they have failed miserably.  The servers were inattentive and rude.  While the food was good, trust me, it is not good enough to make up for this type of service.  All 3 times I've waited over 45 minutes for my pasta, and that's not counting the 15 minutes it took the server to greet us, on top of the 10 minutes of waiting for my drinks.  I can safely say I am never setting foot at this location ever again.  If you are considering this place.  Avoid at all cost."
Kari S.,"Laguna Hills, CA",4,23,6,1.0,10/26/2014,"So what can I say about Bj's last night that's good, service was ok. They however had so many excuses for all the problems that were going on.    First of all 3 of us in my group have been sick all night from what were thinking is because what we ate we all had the same thing, the new Mediterranean chicken pita tacos. We have been in the bathroom all night and 2 of us are still  in bed sick with major stomach aches. First of all when we got are food all of us had different dishes for are side rice thingy, I had the smallest square dish with very little in it, my friend had a soup cup full, and my daughter had what looked like a small soup bowl. The dish was so spicy I couldn't even eat it, the chicken was cut up so small I am not kidding 3 1/2 pieces of the smallest pieces of chicken I've ever seen, and had pepper sauce covering it. I had to scrape it off so at least I could eat my pita. Which this morning I wish I never ate, I haven't felt this bad in a long time.   My other friend had the spaghetti and meatballs that were stone cold, the pasta was so nasty looking it was stuck toghter and hard, I think we were just pretty much done at that time. She didn't say anything when the waitress came to check on us but that's mostly because she checked on us about 20 minutes after we got our food and the kids were ready for dessert.    At that time I overheard the table behind us complaining about there food too, which to me was kinda nice we weren't the only one with crappy food. Even though I know it's so not ok everyone is suffering with crappy food. There waitress told them she was sorry when she came into work, it was just a big mess everything that could go wrong seemed to be going on. I have to say not the best thing to tell your customers, but at least you know it's just need not your table.   The kids were so happy to get there pizokies, however when they came it looked like they had dumped milk on top, I said what's with the white puddle on top, she said someone left the ice cream frezzer open and all the ice cream is melted, really? There serving warm cookies with melted ice cream, was this a joke?? Where was management, why didn't they step in and at least tell there staff to let people know before they ordered that the ice cream is melted and your dessert is going to look like crap. Could they not run to the store and buy more Ice cream?  So overall a very bad meal ok service, and a family that will not be back anytime soon."
Cemone K.,"Peoria, AZ",372,276,1110,3.0,11/25/2013,"Just like any other Bj's good food, good beer, decent prices, decent service, shareable portions.  Favorites include: Calamari, BBQ chicken pizza, buffalo chicken pizza, pretty much all of their small bites, and who can forget their famous pizookie.  They added mocktails on their menu too, the raspberry one is delicious!"
Scott O.,"Chicago, IL",59,2,1,1.0,10/12/2014,"Really bad service here. Asked for a booster seat for my kid, they forgot the request. Asked for Mac and cheese for my kid and to bring the dish out first and they forgot about it and brought it last. Never asked if we wanted a refill, never offered ketchup for my fries. Waiter had to end his shift so we waited a long time to get the bill and 5-10 minutes to get my credit card back! What's going on with you guys? Do you have a bad manager? Get you stuff together!!"
Tigerlilly P.,"Lake Forest, CA",1,16,13,5.0,4/7/2015,We have  been coming here for years now. Service is hit or miss. BUT overall experience  is awesome. Not to mention the huge menu selection. Happy dining everyone
