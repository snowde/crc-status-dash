Sophearith K.,"Laguna Hills, CA",98,43,31,4.0,2/19/2015,Love the Jeremiah Red.  I have one every time I come to to BJ's.
Mike N.,"Sparta, WI",39,39,38,1.0,6/1/2013,"My wife and I came here on a Tuesday for dinner.  After about 2 minutes of sitting, we were sat at our table...Given the menu, few minutes later our waitress came back and we gave our drink orders.  About 10 minutes went by before our waitress came back to inform us that the drinks will be ready soon.  No big deal.  She finally brought our drinks out and gotten or meal orders.  The food came out about another 15-20 mins later.  My wife's Texas style chicken fried steak was bland with little country gravy.  My parmesan crusted chicken was a little above average, better compared to my wife's dinner.   Overall not satisfied with the slow service, specially being on a Tuesday (I can understand if it was a holiday or the weekend) or the food.  Maybe we came on a bad day or had a bad cook...but this place wouldn't be my first choice of restaurants  Don't expect to have a quick meal here...or even drinks..."
Pam F.,"East Bay, CA",121,197,468,4.0,12/17/2013,"My friend and I visited later in the evening, and I found both the staff and hostess very welcoming and helpful. I am happy to know BJ's is open till midnight.  I don't know if this dessert combination is seasonal but their peppermint chocolate pizookie in the smaller size is delicious but the peppermint ice cream could be richer! i found it odd that all the peppermint candy bits were at the bottom of the peppermint ice cream scoop sitting on top of the cookie. I ordered the Black and bleu flatbread pizza and found it to be utterly delicious! perfect size if you're going to eat it by yourself!"
John P.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",101,102,161,3.0,9/6/2014,BJ's always seems to be a busy restaurant... Not sure if it's the location or the Jeremiah Red beer (extremely good beer that's brewed by BJ's) that pulls the customers in?  I'm sure it isn't the consistently slow service or the wrong orders they turn out that pull in customers .  I gave this place a three because of the beer.
Michelle S.,"Cupertino, CA",782,346,982,3.0,9/17/2013,"After driving from Northern California for a good 6 hours, my boyfriend and I were starving and came to BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse to satisfy our hungry stomachs. The interior of the restaurant looks a lot better here than it does back at home in terms of elegance, at least with that huge, pretty lamp that you see hanging from the ceiling when you first enter the restaurant. One sad part was before my sister cancelled on us that she could not make lunch with us, she still reserved us a table and the staff STILL made us wait 10 minutes until we could be seated. Um, isn't the point of a reservation so you don't have to wait at all? I was pretty upset with that, especially when we were coming all the way down from a tiring roadtrip. When we got to our table, I noticed that the utensils were not even on the table and I had to request them when we got our meal. No biggie, but just something to point out for others. Also, I just got the vibe that the workers seemed very disorganized or not confident in their work, as they seemed to forget things a lot. In other words, we'd be kept waiting for a while until we could actually take our order, receive our order, etc. I thought this was a little bit unnecessary, especially when I felt that it wasn't even that packed when we got there. The food though was good, like always whenever I dine at BJ's. I got my famous Avocado Eggrolls, which tasted amazing. We also ordered a California Pizza Flatbread (my boyfriend loved it), chicken quesadilla (which tasted bomb), and a Chocolate Chunk Pizookie (tasted like perfection). Overall, I feel that the food far surpasses the service, and I was more upset with how we weren't seated on time. Probably will never go here again in SoCal, but in NorCal, yes."
Alfred L.,"Bellevue, WA",3,71,,3.0,9/29/2013,"There's nothing really wrong with BJ's, yet nothing really exciting or great about them either. It's fine and exactly what you'd expect. Being such a huge chain and such a huge restaurant that serves hundreds (thousands?) of customers a day, I usually feel like customer #5141241 each visit. I arrive, do the buzzer system, obligatory X seconds of small talk to the table, receive no special acknowledgement, sat, served, billed, and out the door without leaving the faintest impression of even existing to any of the staff. One time they messed up our order exceptionally bad, and suddenly had to pay attention to who we were. And ironically, that was our best experience here in the machine that is BJ's."
Jason D.,"Lake Forest, CA",21,61,60,2.0,12/29/2013,I used to like this place way back when. The only reason for the two is they really need to clean this place better..dirty place... Carpet with ground in food...servers are really slow....
Cliff C.,"Nara, Japan",58,261,1262,4.0,11/29/2011,"I know BJ's is a chain and all that, but they do know how to do things right here and that's alright with me.  My family comes here maybe once a month to take advantage of the Simon's Mall Kidgets promotion where kids eat free (which can shave quite a bit off the total bill), so it's really worth it. The food is pretty darned good; the only time I was ever served a bad meal (the fish in the fish tacos was way overcooked), they quickly brought me another make-up order. A few of my favorite dishes include the Cuban burger, the turkey Cobb sandwich and the chicken parmigiana with spicy marinara sauce. Really, it's all pretty good. Funny, the only thing I really don't bother with are the deep-dish pizzas for which BJ's is known, but only because I'm a thin-crust guy. I'm sure their pizzas are good, too. The service also deserves special mention as they know how to deal with attention-challenged toddlers (and maybe even adults, I don't know); making sure they have drinks right away and keeping things moving for the parents, always checking to see how everything is going. Despite their general youth, they seem like they're well trained and genuinely helpful. Oh, and BJ's serves great beer and cocktails, and has a bazillion monitors with sports on them around the restaurant.  Seriously, what's not to like about this place?"
Nicole N.,"Fountain Valley, CA",0,8,,5.0,3/14/2016,Amazing deep dish pizza and ahi salad. The service was excellent as well as the food! I will make this specific BJs my regular restaurant with my husband.
Nichole P.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",266,118,6,3.0,10/30/2013,"This location is pretty decent. The food and service are always great. The best is really there happy hour, the tiny bites section and pizzokie. 1/2 off of the price for the mini and $2 off the drinks. I believe it is $2 off appetizers are good. One of the good appetizers are the chicken or the tiger shrimp lettuce wraps. That is a must try! Pizzokie is always a craving. cookie and ice cream= yum"
Jake B.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",0,15,2,1.0,10/9/2014,Seated in 5 minutes but we waited 15 for a server to actually make eye contact and take a drink order.  Management here is incredibly poor.
Carlos C.,"Tustin, CA",70,33,14,1.0,6/10/2013,"I usually like this place (when i go to the one i usually go to, TMP) being in the area i decided to try this one out. The service at this one was just incredibly bad. We were sat almost immiditely, but that is pretty much al that happened.  I had a friend visiting from Australia and he really wanted to eat here, so i took him, we were sat all the way in the back corner, where we waited for about 20 mins without any ackowledgement, i flagged down one of the servers and she was pretty nice, but did not apologize, when she brought our waiter he didnt seem too happy to take our orders and when he brought our food out it was cold. We had to keep flagging him down to ask for water, which is very inconvinient. Maybe it was just a bad day for everyone?? Not sure but this was definitely the worst experience ever."
Michelle E.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,40,,2.0,1/28/2013,"The food is average, ok.  It's a chain.  But it's decent.  Beer is awesome.  But we don't go here, because the service is TERRIBLE.  Only decent service is if you sit at the bar.  Sit in the bar area, and expect to wait.  And wait.  And wait. Happy hour is not good either.  Come on!?!?!  $1 off beer and half price mini pizza?"
Emily P.,"Tustin, CA",0,7,,2.0,10/14/2015,"Let me start by saying I never write bad reviews. Being a server myself, I am usually overly understanding when it comes to mediocre service if I see that the server is working hard and doing their best. But our service today was inexcusable. Our first server was fine. No complaints with him. But our second server was a little less than friendly and clearly took into account that my boyfriend and I are in our early 20s and not buying alcohol. It was completely evident that we were being ignored/avoided. When our pizza came out wrong, there was no apology, she just took it away and said she would bring out another one. Which is fine if she was busy, but I could tell she was not. She meandered about her 4 tables (I counted) and spent all of her time tending to the tables full of older couples throwing back their beers and racking up their bills. It was obvious that she wasn't wanting to help us at all seeing as how we waited 5 minutes for ranch and sat with our drinks empty for 15 minutes until we decided to leave, still parched. I understand that we were only their for a quick snack and didn't have the biggest check, but we still deserve to be served with a decent attitude and with some sort of alertness, if not only to get us out quicker to get a bigger table in our place. Even as we walked out, we walked right by her and she looked us both in the eyes and continued past us without a single standard ""have a nice night"" or ""thanks for coming in"". It is a shame that our bad tip will be chalked up to our young age rather than her blatant lack of service. I love Bjs, but I will not be back to this location anytime soon if Clarissa is on the floor. The only reason I give this review 2 stars is because the food was great, as usual, but the service was sub par."
Dan W.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,6,,1.0,3/7/2016,BJ's used to have a wonderful happy hour. Not any longer. Regular hours a glass of house Cabernet is $7.75 really. I can go to Lucilles get the wine cheaper better and with better service along with better crafted  food. What are these corporate idiots thinking. Sayonara we gave you a second and third chance no more.
Dan K.,"Orange County, CA",1,28,,5.0,7/16/2013,"This place has a great server: Perri.  (How do you forget a name like Perri?) I go to a lot of restaurants in Orange County and experience a lot of servers, both good and not so good. Well this server was probably the hardest worker, most cheerful, and pleasant server I have ever seen. I was in a group of four and the order was very tricky...Perri got it correct and served it all at the same time.  She came back to check on us, and convinced all of us to order desert (we never do that)....it was just a real pleasant experience.  We hope to get her again."
Mimi S.,"Laguna Beach, CA",651,497,522,4.0,8/18/2013,Excellent pizza and dessert.  The alcohol though...I love!  Try a couple of drink from the off menu  Wicked Caramel Apple and a Rainbow Sherbet Martini.  I always miss their happy hour...but I just love their food and everything they have to offer! Prices are ok.
Carl L.,"Lake Forest, CA",5,55,3,3.0,7/16/2013,"I've been here many times over the years.  The food is always good and the place is always busy.  I usually sit in the bar so I don't have to wait for a table and I also get to choose who is or is not at the seat/table next to me. On my most recent visit I went there specifically to watch a particular baseball game that was not on broadcast TV.  According to Direct TV this location has the MLB package.  Either the staff don't know how to use it or something.  But they could not find the game I wanted. This resulted in a lower tab, but otherwise I was happy with my visit and I'll of course go back.  Where else can you go for a 1000+ calorie salad?  Seriously?  Ouch."
Michelle L.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",193,25,14,5.0,5/30/2015,"Had the lunch portion of fried chicken, cheddar mashed potatoes, gravy and corn succotash and it was DELICIOUS!  The extra crisp crust on the two chicken breasts (small ones) had a peppery zip to it and was excellent and satisfying.  The potatoes were creamy and wonderful.  Loved the corn, just wish there had been more of it.  The price was under $10 and was a great deal for the money.  I'd return in a heartbeat.  Went there for lunch yesterday; can't get this great meal off my mind."
Era W.,"Las Flores, CA",66,89,12,3.0,9/4/2013,DECOR: Nice Brewery style restaurant. Has nice bar area and a lot of space inside as well as a covered outside patio area. SERVICE: ALways thought the service at this location has been good. Never had a problem with the staff here. The Rancho Location on the other hand....not so good! FOOD: Pizza here is VERY GOOD! Love coming here for a Pizza and Snakebite. They hace some other good items on the menu as well and their prices arent too bad.
