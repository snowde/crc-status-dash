Chris H.,"Laguna Woods, CA",17,12,77,3.0,11/20/2013,Lots selections of beers which are worthy to try.  The food is ok but the whole atmosphere is good for a casual or business lunch.  I always choose here to talk with partners for biz.
Engie Y.,"Irvine, CA",217,55,16,4.0,8/10/2014,"Lemon Thyme chicken, no sauce, sub veggies for rice is uhhhh-mazing! Didn't even feel like I wanted a slice of my friends pizza or pizookie!"
Hannah K.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",148,85,21,3.0,2/24/2013,"I would recommend coming to Bj's only for lunch. Every time I come here for dinner my friends and I have to fight for a place in the bar area or wait hours for a table. The food and service is typically good but my last couple of visits to this particular Bj's have been a disappointment. Definitely would NOT get take out here again.  I placed my order online and they said my order would be ready at 6:50 (keep in mind this is 30 minutes away from when I placed my order). I got there maybe a few minutes before that time and when I went to pay the girl was having issues getting me the receipt I have to sign. She had to have the manager come and print it out. The girl said my order would be out any minute. I took a seat and by the register and expected my order to be there soon (I only ordered a simple soup and salad). Ten minutes passed and everyone that ordered a pizza got their order right away. I was kind of confused on how everyone was walking out with pizzas with no wait, but my soup and salad had taken 40 minutes to make now? I ended up waiting a total of 25 minutes for a freakin soup and salad! (plus the 30 minutes I waited at home) Finally the girl in charge of the take out told me she was going to go get my order and ran to the back. She was back there for about 5 minutes. I FINALLY got my order and when I got home I could tell they made my food in a hurry because my wedge salad had less than a teaspoon of each fixing (bacon, blue cheese, etc.) This entire take out experience has made me not really want to come to Bj's again. I paid 12$ for basically a head of iceberg lettuce cut in half and a cup of soup. I've ordered this before but ate in the restaurant and it was way better. I'm giving them 3 stars based on my past experiences and the food is good whenever I go there for lunch. It seems they need to be more organized and not be running around the place like chickens with their heads cut off."
Nazi G.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",5,72,29,4.0,1/3/2015,"The food was great, our server was very nice but it took too long to make the food. They said there was only one person making the burgers and he was backed up. But all together good experience."
Gabe P.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",321,961,698,3.0,6/16/2013,"Man, this place is always packed on every day of the week! Came here because of a $5 Google offer, but been here before with friends, it's a convenient location and easy to agree with pretty much everyone, they can all find something to like here. Great for after work happy hour or any kind of friends gathering. Had the Happy Hr Flatbread enough for 1 person, chicken letuce wraps, good to share, and a Texas style chicken fried steak, just because I felt like having a chicken fried steak! The steak was good, the mashed potatoes were OK but the sauce was bad, just swipe it to the side and ignore it. Get the Pouzuki dessert since everyone else will, or just get something that you'll actually like. Our server was great and everything was nice, but nothing stands out here, it's up to you and your friends to make this get together outstanding!"
Kaytlin K.,"Newport Beach, CA",304,207,280,3.0,10/15/2014,"Service here is typically slow, but the pazookies and large beer list make up for it! They have everything you can imagine, a little bit for everyone on the menu. Great deep dish pizzas and some tasty appetizers to share. The restaurant seems so large and so understaffed constantly!!!"
Courtney F.,"Lake Forest, CA",31,23,7,4.0,5/8/2013,"The food is always good, though I tend to get the same thing every time I go. Mini Sweet Pig pizza! The caesar salad is also ""the best"" in my boyfriend's opinion. This is our go-to pizza place in the Lake Forest area. By the time the waiter/waitress asks if we'd like some pizookis we're too full for dessert. As far as the service goes, it tends to be on the good side. I've never had a bad waiter, but there are certain times where they get really busy. I don't blame anyone for having to wait for your food to be cooked properly. Mid-week dinner hour seems to be the best time to go. Friday night and Saturday are a little crazy as expected. It's a great place to go if you don't mind having your meal buddies looking at the big screen TVs over your shoulder. The bar space is pretty nice, good for happy hour if you just want to have an appetizer and a beer."
Cathy L.,"Ladera Ranch, CA",63,100,6,3.0,2/5/2013,"Trying the under 575 calorie ""enlightened"" menu. Tacos! The tacos were good, very small but that's what I expected . The veggie Flat Bread was very tasty too. Service is always good."
Ash T.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",54,24,12,5.0,8/18/2011,"My favorite restaurant.  Only place I can get the beer I like. PM porter is my favorite beer here, but they also have great brewed root beer and other refreshing drinks. Food is regularly outstanding. Atmosphere enjoyable for casual or more romantic times. I always have a good time here. Service is a step above as well."
Vikki B.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",4,12,4,1.0,11/18/2015,"Decided to come here for a birthday dinner since there is always something on the menu for everyone. We had reservations for 6:30. We arrived at 6:25. The hostess greeted us and I told him that we had reservations under my dad's name. He then prompted us to sit at a booth. As we waited for the rest of our party a waitress asked us if we were with a table across the way from us, we said no. So it turns out the hostess had absolutely no idea what he was doing. The rest of our party arrived and we were offered drinks. After 20-25 minutes of looking through the menu, our waitress approached us to take our order. We all ordered an appetizer plate and our meals. We waited 45 minutes for our appetizer plate to show up. Nothing on the plate was hot. As we munched away at our measly appetizers, we all sat there with empty glasses. Long story short, the table who were seated after us had there food before we did. We waited an hour and 25 minutes for our main courses. There were about 5-7 servers hanging out at the hostess stand, just chit chatting. I do not plan on returning here, which makes me sad because I used to love coming here. This place needs a serious wake up call in terms of the service."
Ashley Y.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",5,15,2,5.0,11/17/2014,I went to this location on Sunday for lunch and had Ryan as my server. He suggested the deep dish lasagna and it was a great choice! He was very attentive and we didn't have to wait too long for anything. Amazing food and great service!
Bettina K.,"Irvine, CA",68,24,4,2.0,9/21/2012,"Normally I love BJs but not so much after our take out experience this week.  We ordered online and the pick up time the site gave us was 1/2 and hour, so we got there in about half an hour and our food was cold. I understand take out won't taste as good as dining in, but come on for it to be that cold should not be normal.  We ordered spinach artichoke dip, the BBQ chicken salad and the BJs classic combo pizza. Spinach artichoke dip was cold and they barely gave us any in the to go carton. I've had it in the restaurant  before so I know that the serving size should be larger. The BBQ chicken salad was a major bummer because they forgot the crispy onions, that's my favorite part! They did a good job at not putting on the beans or tomatoes that I had asked to be left off the salad, but nowhere on the online order did we put no onions. So for 14 bucks it was a bland salad. The pizza was cold. Major bummer. There wasn't enough sauce so the pizza was dry and the pepperonis were not toasty like they normally are. It seemed like they rushed making the pizza. The vibe I got was that they rushed though our order and it was done way before our 1/2 hour time frame and that is why it was cold. I am giving 2 stars because my experience dining in had  been much better. For over 40 bucks our meal sucked and I wished we had gotten take out from somewhere else. Another annoyance was we ordered after 8, and when we went in the place was pretty empty so I have no idea why they didn't take their time."
Ashley V.,"Lake Forest, CA",2,23,8,5.0,1/13/2014,I love this place! I go quite often and the food is always extremely great ! I enjoy the California chicken sand which and the pizzas are all delicious!! I love this place no RSVP needed so that's pretty cool! Our servers are all really cool We enjoy going to the bar as we'll just sometimes that does take a little long to recieve service. Thanks you !
Ken W.,"Lake Forest, CA",0,28,1,2.0,6/22/2014,"Food is still good, but the staff are letting the place go.  Were taken to a dirty booth and asked to have it cleaned off.  The host brushed off the food that was within arm's reach and left the rest.  Crumbs still on the  table, crumbs in the booth, actual chunks of food on the corner caps of the booth. Pretty sorry."
Dermot B.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",18,19,4,1.0,7/19/2014,Tried again tonite as the family wanted to go there. Glad to see that I'm not on my own with other reviewers also commenting on the continuing poor standards of service at this restaurant. We were sat at a table again that wasn't ready with a pizza and stand on top of the table. Drinks and food service was slow and when the appetizers arrived we had to ask 3 times for cutlery. The waitress went past our table 3 times after our request and forgot. We asked a manager who told us it was not her job to get silverware for the table. At this point we told her that we had already asked and been ignored so she went and got what we needed. Food was ok but again the second drinks order sat at the main bar for 20 minutes. Waitress was rude and not interested and could not cope with managing her tables.  Clearly management are not interested in constructive feedback or they would respond to yelp reviews although it seems they pick and choose who they respond to.
Dominic G.,"Los Angeles, CA",141,52,13,1.0,7/17/2012,"And finally it is here, my first rant. See now, my friends know that I like to complain about things. A lot of things. Most things, honestly. But in my defense, I complain because sometimes I believe that things can be better. That things can work more efficiently and be more effective. Well, this is a perfect example of what occurred this past Saturday night: So all that week, I had been jonesin for some pizza. So where else would I go, besides BJ's Restaurant and Brewery in Laguna Hills. I hadn't had BJ's Pizza for quite awhile and was really excited to taste the deliciousness once more. I pulled up, parked my car, and walked into the restaurant. There was no wait, and my party got seated immediately, without any time wasted. This instantly struck me as strange, being that it was 8:00p.m. on a Saturday night; Yet, my mind moved on. I would find out later, why this was the case. After ordering the ""Chicken Bacon Ranch"" pizza with added ""Buffalo Sauce"" and a side of fries, the ""Jeremiah Red Ale"" came and the night had begun (But damn, I didn't know it was to be the worst restaurant experience of my adult life). Let's get something straight real quick. I've worked at a restaurant at the Irvine Spectrum. I understand busy nights and 1-hour long waits. I understand who cooks the meals: the chefs, who takes my orders: the waiter/waitress, and who fixes issues: the manager. So for the entire meal, our server (Sadly, forgot her name), was good. She wasn't amazing, and she definitely wasn't bad. She was almost exactly what I want in a server. Now, she brought us the pizza, cut it for us, and I bit in. 'Damn I had made a good choice putting the buffalo sauce on the pizza', was the first thought in my head after I dove in. Twisting and smashing in my mouth, the bacon, ranch, chicken, sweetened crust, and buffalo sauce made me satisfied and left me without any buyers remorse. I take my third bite. Well, to put it plainly... I bit straight into a piece of metal. Initially, I had thought it was just a really crispy piece of crust. That was until I bit into it once more and it didn't budge, only hurt my tooth. Sadly, I spit out what was my beautifully tasting pizza, and find a piece of metal, no smaller than a BB-pellet. Clearly, and for reasons not needing explanation, that alone was bad. But the night had just begun. In the restaurant business, that's a huge deal, obviously. Nonetheless, I assume, and know, that these things happen. Thus, I wasn't angry at that point to be honest. As I've said before, I worked at a restaurant with non-stop traffic; So I understand that shit happens. But here's where things started to tail off... I told the waitress what had happened, and she immediately apologized and told me that she would bring the manager right over. 10 minutes later. No really, ten minutes is what I waited for the manager to come over. That, in and of itself, is ridiculous. To think that it took a manager of a restaurant, 10 minutes to a approach a customer who had just bitten into a piece of metal in a pizza made by one of his restaurants chef's, is baffling. That would have never happened at the restaurant I had worked at, let alone ANY respectable establishment. ""Oh, wow, yeah that's bad. I'll bring you gentlemen another pizza."" What you just read above, is all KEVIN (the worst manager I have ever met) said to me when he came over to see what had happened. He walked away promptly after he said the word, ""pizza"". (I didn't hear from KEVIN for the remainder of the meal, until... Well, you'll read)... But really? No, honestly. Really? I don't even have your respect to receive an apology. No sign of remorse that a customer had just bitten into a pizza that had a piece of metal in it. A piece of metal, that luckily didn't shatter my tooth. Jesus... How did you get your job, Kevin? Especially at this time, we have loads of unemployed members of society looking for work, who would be clamoring for your position, and this is how you act?

Pishool P.,"Laguna Beach, CA",13,65,136,3.0,11/11/2012,"There are exact items that I like in their menu.  1. Bj's Favorite, thin crust 2. Red Beer 3. Avocado egg roll Other thing are average quality and over priced.  The happy hour which all the mini pizzas are half off, it's a great deal which I always go there for just the happy hour. It''s also good for a group of 10 or more for a birthday party or friendly gathering."
Al S.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",1251,506,242,4.0,6/24/2012,"Somebody... tell Erin, our server this Sunday when we sat in the booth in the bar section..... that I'm giving her location 4 stars. And that's not because BJ's ""the cumulative experience"" was truly 4-star, but because Erin was actually interesting, genuine, and attentive without being a bother. We only ordered a Frisco Burger, the common name for a burger on sour dough with cheese. It was OK, and satisfied. My wife had a chicken and rice entree, which I didn't care for. But she doesn't eat red meat, so if she likes ""any dish"" at a restaurant, we're in good shape.  My 4 star review for Laguna Hills is actually a ""3.5 plus 0.5"" The PLUS 0.5 goes to Laguna  Hills....... FOR NOT BEING ANYTHING LIKE THE RANCHO STA. MARGARITA disaster. As Stevenen has said...... ""...if you're hungry, you'll leave filled."" (paraphrasing). Mary R. said, ""....... she can stop drinking any time she wants...."", and if her group is going to satisfy their thirst after work, she'll go along to ""watch out for others, and maybe be a designated driver."" (OK, so, is it still paraphrasing if you don't exactly relate what one has said..... or even get close??!)  We've eaten here since we got to So.OC, and have never had a bad meal. I just pray that whatever ""condition"" the RSM store has, LH has been immunized, and won't be getting that way........ EVER!"
Anna F.,"Irvine, CA",23,20,2,1.0,8/31/2012,"I used to go to this BJ's every Thursday with part of my soccer team (usually 6-8 people), but the service has gotten so bad that we've decided to move on to a place that can get food to us in under an hour so we can enjoy the rest of the evening talking, instead of shoving food in our faces so we can get home in time to get some sleep. Tonight was the final straw. We were sitting in the bar area during happy hour, and the service was absolutely horrible. We were unlucky enough to get a new girl who looked like a deer in the headlights while she was trained by a guy who couldn't stand still to listen to an order. All I ordered was water and a thin crust pizza with mushrooms and olives. It took over half an hour to get my pizza, and when it got to me, it wasn't the Gluten-free thin-crust pizza that I ordered, it was the flatbread pizza from the appetizer menu, which isn't gluten free. When I asked the server to clarify what I was given, he said it was the flatbread, and that he didn't hear me say ""Gluten Free."" ... Okay... So I might not have said the entire ""Gluten-free Thin Crust pizza"" but I ALSO didn't say ""flatbread"" And at this point, I still didn't have my water. I had to ask for it three times, and it took nearly an hour to get it. When I asked him to take it back and fix the order, it took another 30 minutes to get it. I'm sorry, but when I'm at a restaurant, and THEY screw up my order, I expect the corrected order to get to me ASAP. I had to ask for a box to go by time it actually got to the table. And to top it off, I was charged full price. I'm not the type of person who sharks for free food when there is a mistake, but when that mistake has me sitting at a table for an hour and a half with no food, it's a little insulting to pay full price. Other problems with my group's experience is that someone asked for the cheese pizza bread from the smallbites menu and buffalo won-tons. She never got the won-tons (luckily, they weren't on the bill), but her pizza bread came out as a mini pizza, and then when she got the actually pizza bread, it had pepperoni on it.  AND, the waiters only did one round of refills in the hour and a half we were there."
Jonathan P.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",33,47,17,5.0,11/23/2014,We were at dinner last night and there was a small issue with service and our order. Our waiter it seemed wasn't to interested in our table. Well that is when another server (I believe her name was Selena ) stepped up with no incentive as we were not her table and took care of us. We spoke to management and peter (one of the managers) was very helpful (I see why he is a manager). Thank to Selena and Peter they turned a poor date night into a great date night. Thanks bjs as we come here often to enjoy the food and sports. USC lost :(
