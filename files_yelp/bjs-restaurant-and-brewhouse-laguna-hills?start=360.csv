Darlene J.,"Gig Harbor, WA",48,309,25,3.0,9/3/2014,My one complaint is putting the bill on the table when people are still eating! That's just rude.
Tim T.,"Lake Forest, CA",112,4,1,2.0,1/25/2016,"Had dinner on Thursday 1/14/16, and ordered a the cheese ravioli dish. While the food was just alright, I kept getting smelling hints of what I can only describe as sour dirty dishwater or a dirty oven, but I couldn't tell what it was. About half way through eating my food, it was really starting to bother me so I smelled my silverware and that seemed fine, then I smelled the food and was able to hone in on the deep dish pan itself. The pan had a lot of char on the outside which is what I presume was holding the odor. I had my friends at my table smell the dish and all agreed it had a funk to it. So I asked the waitress if it was typical, and she even smelled the dish, and by the look on her face I think she agreed. She showed her manager that happened to be walking by and he smelled it and said it was fine, nothing wrong with it and that its maybe just the char on the outside of the pan. However, I was amazed he didn't acknowledge the smell, and he continued and walked away. I had the waitress take the dish away because I had lost my appetite from the smell of the dish Only reason I gave this 2 stars is because the waitress who provided great service and was nice enough to offer a pazookie  to our table, but someone else at my table took it instead."
Lisa C.,"San Clemente, CA",4,51,,1.0,8/18/2012,"Have't gotten our food yet but all the servers seem like they are having a really bad evening. No smiles. No customer service. No personality at all. I know we aren't here to be friends with the servers but I would expect them to at least be pleasant. I won't be back to this location again!!! Ok so when the food came, it was absolutely horrible. How does a restaurant that specializes in pizza not get the pizza right?!?!? I ordered a vegetarian pizza. There was no sauce of any kind and it was hard to find the veggies. It was just pizza bread. I have to admit, the avocado egg roles are really yummy!"
Stuart S.,"Oakland, CA",0,6,,2.0,1/24/2016,"Service is a big part of the dining experience.  Not so good the night i was there with my mother and father.  93 and 89 yrs old.  When you bring a bottle of beer to woman of that age you also bring a glass.  Really?  We had to ask, and we had to ask two people and wait too long to get the glass.  Also, when you bring someone a burger and fries, you also bring the ketchup and mustard.  I should not have to ask for it.  Poor service."
Amber B.,"San Juan Capistrano, CA",19,19,,3.0,11/6/2014,"Sat in the bar area for football on Sunday with my husband. We were there for quite some time.... And at first, the service was quick and efficient. But, after we had finished our lunch (we planned to stay longer) our waiter didn't even come to the table to check on us. The bar was NOT busy, therefore I was not able to find a reason for the service diminishing after our lunch. We will return again, in hopes of having great service throughout our entire visit."
Elle C.,"Irvine, CA",63,670,605,3.0,2/18/2013,"It's confirmed, this location serves incredibly weak drinks ('thought I'd give 'em another try). How unfortunate, as I love the interior of this location. Cost doesn't justify what one receives."
Natalie B.,"Mission Viejo, CA",4,10,4,2.0,12/4/2015,"My boyfriend and I regularly go to the BJ's at the Tustin marketplace but being down in Mission Viejo decided to go to this location for a pizookie and a drink! We were seated quickly and got our drinks fast and our pizookie shortly after. Both tasted great. Unfortunately our service was beyond rude. Our server Alex came to our table once and then after that returned with the check. Not once asking if we needed a refill or what have you. Didn't even get the chance to order a second drink. She stood at the table behind us talking with friends and other coworkers who had just gotten off and it was very irritating. She stood there talking for about 10 minutes and continually came back to the same table completely ignoring us and I'm sure her other tables. Tbh this experience ruined my opinion of this BJ's and we will not be returning. Your servers need to learn customer service and their place in a restaurant setting, whether they are on the clock or not. No tip was provided because it was definitely not deserved."
Jay R.,"Lake Forest, CA",50,9,,1.0,11/26/2014,Never go again. Went with a party of 11 and three were young.  We asked that the kids be giving food first as it was getting late. The kids were the last to get the food.  My food did not show up and when it did you can tell it was sitting under lights as it was now over cooked.   They did not charge us for my meal however the gave me one to take with us.   When I got home I found it was raw so in the trash that went.  My suggestion go somewhere else to eat
Eric R.,"Salt Lake City, UT",40,90,94,4.0,12/20/2012,"I found a table at the bar and was helped right away. Things were going well! I had the Bacon Cheeseburger Pizza which was aweseome!! I have always loved thier pizza and food, however when it came time to get dessert the waitress took forever... I could've had a BJ for how long it took to get my pizookie.... Other than that it was a good Wednsday night dinner!"
Beachy K.,"Laguna Beach, CA",1,41,,2.0,3/22/2012,"Typical mediocre corporate fare.  Low quality food and service.  If you're a big beer drinker (I'm not) than you may like the sportsbar atmosphere and drinks. But my friend and I agreed that the food appears to be an after-thought.  I've given them 2 chances: once in Chula Vista, when they screwed up our pizza order -- we ordered a deep dish with sausage, mushroom, and green peppers, and they brought us an incomplete pizza without tomato sauce and tomatoes -- that's like building a home without a foundation! The thing was as dry and tasteless as cardboard.   The next time we were in Laguna Hills (El Toro) and my date ordered the beef dip. which was stale bread with meager bits of mystery meat.  I ordered a salad and stuffed baked potato, which was disappointing because of the minimal amount of ingredients. $8 for basically a plain baked potato - ridiculous!"
Jim B.,"Dana Point, CA",27,34,8,2.0,8/27/2012,"The food here used to be much better. I think it is under new management or something. I hate the drive, but the food at the RSM location is much better and you get larger portions. The pizza last time around was almost inedible. The dough is just not right lately.  I stick to the parmesan crusted chicken anyways ;)"
Robert M.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,3,,5.0,12/17/2014,This has been my go to for great pizza for years now. Friendly service and quick to get me through line and on my way.  I love the variety of ingredients and types of pizzas that satisfy the most picky of eaters. Until recently they made a mistake to my order.  Tim Miller- helped me satisfy the mistake quickly and trouble free. This made me very happy to know they stand behind their service and quality of food.
Amy M.,"Dana Point, CA",38,27,13,3.0,8/2/2014,"BJ's is a typical chain. Not bad, not great. Good for groups.. there is something for everyone."
Dave N.,"Newport Beach, CA",0,14,9,1.0,2/20/2014,"Hands down worst BJ's! Bad service, inconsistent food! I love BJ's, but this one has been this way since day one! The staff will readily agree with you if you complain about the service."
Tay D.,"Corona Del Mar, CA",27,64,76,1.0,2/18/2013,"So this is a bit of a mixed review. First I just want to say that the entree's were very good, generally always are. Their Pizza is great and the Jumbalaya is even better. However, the service was absolutely atrocious. The waiter was too cool to serve us, and anytime we asked for something it was a burden on his soul. I know it's a bit much to ask, but can I at least have some ketchup for my 4 day old french fries? Oh, and my empty glass will refill itself Im sure. Too bad I'm not more of a dic#, or I might have gone behind the bar to get a refill myself!  At any rate, I will not be returning to this BJ's as the final icing on the cake was that he gave us the wrong flavor of Pizooki we ordered to-go (unless of course Raspberries taste like chocolate chips now). Normally this would not be a game changer, but it just sort of tied a bow on the whole experience. My advice: only eat here if you want bar food, and sit at the bar. If you want good pizza and friendly service go to CPK, or better yet Peppino's!"
Jerod L.,"Hemet, CA",0,4,1,1.0,10/18/2014,"The server Isaac was very unprofessional.  He took forever to get us our appetizers and checks. Seems he had an attitude from the start. Management, please look into this. I've always liked this particular Bj's. I'd like this looked into."
Al M.,"Irvine, CA",0,3,4,5.0,10/11/2013,This place is great. Food is always awesome. Miss our favorite server Lauren. The best part of this place is the consistancy of the food . The mark of a good restaurant.
Nicki F.,"Oakland, CA",218,446,73,5.0,11/29/2012,"I love BJ's. Got late night snack food here after watching Skyfall (which was good) and I had forgotten how good food was at BJ's! We ordered a medium regular hand-tossed Great White pizza and it filled three people up. I had my doubts, but I had to force myself to finish the last half slice.  Place is also known for their famous pizookies, but we were too full from pizza to eat one!"
Caliah G.,"Vista, CA",1,5,,5.0,11/26/2014,Went here with my son and grandchildren the food was so delicious fast and friendly the shrimp tacos were out of this world desert menu tried them all
Bill K.,"Irvine, CA",1,19,,1.0,2/25/2014,Well new Menu.  Prices up about %10.  This place is doing the same as Gordon Biersch did.  Just nickel and dime till you kill the business.  Portions get smaller and smaller.  Eventually it just ends.  I give it a year and it's closed.
