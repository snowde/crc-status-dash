B T.,"Chicago, IL",1,24,,1.0,8/27/2015,"Something's happened to this place and it is really bad. DIRTY plates, glasses, utensils. RUDE service. Food just sits there until it gets cold before they bring it out to you. Do you like cold pizza you've been waiting a long time for already? Nope, me either. So annoying. I'm never going back."
Anand S.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",4,110,16,4.0,8/1/2014,"I like this location. The food selection is great and is able to cater to young and old. Beer selection is very good, craft beer too. Service is very friendly and prompt unlike some other locations of this restaurant. Only one large screen tv, in the bar area. And the bar area is first come first served. So if you are headed there to watch a game, plan on being there well in advance."
Berta I.,"Lake Forest, CA",0,5,,1.0,2/22/2014,"We went for dinner and I asked for a chicken plate with no gravy, the waiter asked if it could go on the side I said please but when I got my plate it had gravy all over the chicken.  We asked for the kitchup when we got our plates but we had to ask the waiter for the kitchup when he drove by, never asked how we were enjoying our food or refills on the cokes.  When our check came he asked if we wanted a box for the left overs I told him no since my food had gravy all over, he said sorry and left the check. That was our first time and our last time we will visit BJs."
Jamaica Q.,"Laguna Hills, CA",0,1,,2.0,4/13/2014,"We got a dirty table and right when we got our food,the waiter handed us the check. I've definitely at better service at other bj's but not this one."
Allyson M.,"Seattle, WA",189,669,394,4.0,1/8/2010,"We went here today for our holiday team lunch. Yup, we postponed it until after year-end madness was over. Looks like we survived.  The lunch special I had today was really cheap - $5.95 for a one-topping pizza with a side salad. My glass of strawberry lemonade cost $2.75, although it didn't really taste like lemonade. It was drinkable, though.  We got here at 12 PM and the 8 of us got seated right away without having to call in ahead of time. The service was good - our server came by every so often to re-fill our drinks and ensure we were all doing well.  The lunch specials are really a bang for your buck, though. I've never gone here for lunch before, so I was pleasantly surprised. Still, I probably wouldn't come here outside of company festivities because it is located near Leisure... er... Laguna Woods Village. Hehe!"
Ann L.,"Orange, CA",120,18,17,1.0,6/29/2014,"Rude service. Came here on a Sunday evening didn't have to wait to be seated. Ordered clam chowder to start off, it was so salty it tasted bitter. 45 minutes and still waiting for the rest of our food. I usually don't write reviews but I'm so annoyed at the service that it's a must. Do not come to this location. I finished writing my review and our food is still not here. It's been an hour since the server took our order."
Tanaz S.,"Irvine, CA",8,160,127,4.0,11/10/2012,"This location is the one we usually go to. I really like it because it's one of the biggest locations and the wait is not usually that long. I have gone there to watch a superbowl with family and I recommend it. It'll be fun. I love their Pazzoki, and try their beer sampler."
Lamar W.,"Orlando, FL",68,31,58,1.0,1/3/2014,"This is the worst service I have EVER had. I don't drink, but the host asked if I wanted to sit at the bar since I was alone, and it made since so that I wouldn't take a whole table for myself. I first got there and I sat down I did get greeted right away, I think what went wrong was when I asked for a ""none alcoholic"" drink. Bartenders need to have a good knowledge of a few of theses in there bag. I told her to make whatever be creative. She comes back to me with a frozen drink with a big piece of pineapple and whip cream, my first thought was I should have been more s specific when I ordered, second this was a big slap in my face. It's cold out for one and I'm clearly not a girly guy, but since I don't drink alcohol I guess this is what I get!  So moving on I ask for a menu, my whole purpose for coming there, did I mention I'm a first time guest?! , sorry It slipped my mind. Anyway I try to order an app three people walk by me with my menu in front of me for at least 10-12 mins I know this because that's  how much time the game had left. And I know to watch the time when I'm noticing that service is lacking.  I finally get some attention from a tender and she took the order, food came out and when it hit the table I placed my dinner order, the Flatbread was good, by the time I finished 5-8 mins later my dinner was in front of me. This is when I could not believe the service. I was never asked how was the food while eating, never offered salt and pepper, and NEVER asked for a refill on my drink, or offered water!! .   I ate my entire dinner without one sip of a drink! Wow.  It seems that the tenders knew what they were doing because I heard one say"" She don't care if I don't get anything"" and that's  exactly what I left for a tip Nothing! Places like this can be great, but can also fall short.   The bar was not packed and I can see why a Friday night at 9 pm?!! Late night should have a draw, but with service like this well I see why the bar is empty early.  Ps. Doing side work at 9 pm and not giving guest or should I say me the proper attention probably lead to this review. BJ's I wish u well.  But you will never get a hard earned buck from me again!  Pas. Where is the manager walking doing table touches? Haven't seen that person all night. A hour and a half of hell. At this place"
Trina D.,"Orange County, CA",808,2005,7075,2.0,11/7/2009,"My coworkers and I went out for yet another birthday lunch and decided on BJ's.  The food was ok.  Everyone received their food as ordered.   We faxed ahead our order before making reservations.  Apparently this is a no-no because we had to call and make reservations first.  I faxed in the order at 9 am and immediately got a call 15 min later by a manager.  He seemed irate that we didn't call to make reservations first.  I would have called ahead had I known that someone would be there at the restaurant at 7:30 am.  That aside, the manager confirmed the order and was good enough to agree to put names next to the entrees so as to make things easier for both parties involved.  We also agreed that the food would be on the table at 12:15 and that the pazookies would be out 10 minutes later.   We get to the restaurant and are taken to our seats, which were on the patio.  We had a party of 21 people and yet we were seated at tables that were not put together.  We were at two long tables set up side by side.  My coworkers consist of mostly Asian women who dislike sunlight and wear a lot of SPF.  They immediately went for tables that were in the shade away from the group because the sun was shining down on where they were supposed to sit.  The next inconvenience came where the pazookies came out 25 minutes late.  Following that, the bill was wrong where one of the entrees were rung up as a dinner and not lunch.  I had to speak to a manager since the waiters that weren't assigned to my table weren't able to help me even though they were huddled by the registers as our waiter was busy with another set of tables.  The manager adjusted it for me and we ended up leaving the restaurant later than we wanted.   3 stars for food 1 star for service = 2 stars average  I've had better service at other places when it comes to large groups like this.  I would think that BJ's is the type of establishment that can handle groups of this size, but even so I guess not."
Perro G.,"Garden Grove, CA",0,1,,5.0,10/20/2014,My first time here at this location. Came to watch Monday night football and my brothers b-day. Sat at the bar friendly staff great service. My bartender Jordan was awesome! very accommodating. Had a great first experience here.
Alexis D.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,7,1,2.0,8/28/2015,"I'm a regular here and ordered my usual tonight, a bjs brewhouse burger with thin fries. I picked it up t go tonight instead. I payed on the app and had it set to be ready at 1015. I got there at 1010 and it was ready in a warmer type thing. I drove home (5 minutes), opened up the box, and saw that the food was soggy. The fries were very soggy and like rubber and the bun of my burger was as well. I'm not sure how long it was sitting there (I ordered it around 945, I was at work), but it was terrible, and inedible. I through it away. Never had dissapointed me until now! No more take out for me! It would have been one star but the cashier was friendly."
Nicole S.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,14,,3.0,10/14/2014,If I could give a rating for the food only it would definitely be 5 stars. But since this is about the restaurant as a whole I give it 3 stars. I probably come here at least once every couple weeks. I kid you not every time I come they forget about me while I'm waiting. One time I was waiting for 45 min and then I couldn't take it anymore and finally asked what the heck was taking so long and they were just like uhhhhh??? They totally forgot about me and seated me right away after I said something. ANNOYING. Maybe it's just me. Who knows. But whatever you do don't get a server named Jorge! Probably the worst server I have ever had in my life. He probably checked on us once if that and took forever to do anything. THANK GOD THE FOOD IS AMAZING OTHERWISE THIS PLACE PISSES ME OFF!!!!
Randoll C.,"Los Angeles, CA",582,1424,6023,4.0,7/26/2010,"Yes, I'm a fan of BJ's. Not because of their beer but because of their deep dish style crust pizza.  So many places have moved towards a healthier, thin crust style pizza and it's like eating tortilla chips to me. I grew up eating pizza crusts made with lots of dough so that's just what I like. The Pizookie! The second reason I'm a fan. Ice cream served over a baked cookie.  I haven't had anything else other than pizza and their Pizookies. Well, and their beer. There's so much staff walking around the place that service better be, and usually is pretty good.  The place can get pretty loud - so if you're looking for some intimacy, I'd try someplace else."
Magdalena M.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,11,1,4.0,10/11/2014,"They open until late at night while everything else closed already, so that made it very easy for us . The calamary was good and I really liked the salads. The service was great."
Jack F.,"Ann Arbor Charter Township, MI",0,18,,1.0,1/1/2014,I don't know where they get there in competent waiters. We had the worst service.  The mediocre food took forever.  I left a lousy tip because they deserved it.   The food is over-priced. Never going back.
Ashley D.,"San Diego, CA",2,62,6,1.0,6/19/2014,"This was the wrong dining experience I have had in forever.  It all started two hours ago when we got our wedge salad that we specifically ordered with no bacon and came with bacon on it. Then the food came out and we really enjoyed our crispy dry chicken wings so we ordered another round. The next round came out 45 minutes later and were completely different. They were soaked in sauce, soggy and cold! We asked for the manager and she came and apologized and offered to make us another round on the fly. On the flu was about another 25 minutes later so we just took them to go.  Terrible service, I normally love BJs but their quality at this location was the worst! Never coming back."
Marisol C.,"Spring Valley, CA",0,7,1,1.0,8/16/2014,Disappointed....we were excited to eat their bbq chicken pizza and their claim chowder but it wasn't what we expected. The pizza was dry had to ask for a side of bbq sauce and the claim chowder bread bowl was burnt! Who toasts their bread bowls? Not going back their for food again:(
Sukhraj B.,"Orange, CA",1723,1189,1870,4.0,11/6/2009,"I guess I spoke too soon when I said you never disappoint.   A friend called me up for lunch and we met here.  It wasn't packed but again, what's with all the bad seating choices?  You took us near the back and you wanted to seat us at a table in between other folks where we would be sandwiched in.  Not cool.  We asked for a booth and your server frowned at us but gave us one anyway.   Our drinks arrived and my friend's drink had a few random objects floating in it.  But it was replaced quickly enough.  This time around we went for the Cobb Salads but I got the lunch special with the broccoli cheddar soup and soup was kinda bland and the salad was just ok, not great like before.  Personally, I think the croutons were stale.  My friend's cobb salad hardly had any meat but we got extra meat and some complimentary dinner rolls as well. I'm still a fan though.  I know your pizza is better but today was just not the day to venture here for lunch."
Danny C.,"Foothill Ranch, CA",3,23,21,5.0,1/5/2011,"You can easily gain a few lbs eating the food but it's good food at that. Great starters such as the chicken lettuce wraps, spinach and artichoke dip and my favorite the MARGHERITA FRESCA FLATBREAD PIZZA.  The Halibut fish tacos are pretty good too. A little heavy on the sauce, but very very good tacos.  Now for the beer drinkers. I recommend the Totanka Stout. I call it the adult milk shake. It's a thick dark stout. Very good.  BJs I'd have to say is probably my favorite eatery right now. Great atmosphere, great for groups and big on food and alcohol selection. The only thing I would give bad marks on is the parking. Gets very busy and crowded. Good thing for them. Not so much for us.  Happy eating."
English G.,"Oceanside, CA",323,120,284,2.0,10/12/2013,"My colleagues loved their beers and the food was ok. But we were waiting for 45 mins, after being first told 20mins. They did not program our buzzer correctly. They said they called us but no lights & no vibration so ermm no you didnt! They gave us another one & we had to tell them we had been waiting before for 45 mins earlier! Another 20 mins wait, errrmmm I think not! So what do you know in 5 mins we were buzzed. No communication between staff! Luckily the servers at the bar were very competent & got us served quickly drinks & food before we got seated finally almost an hour later! The bar staff is why I gave them 2 stars. Would not eat here again. Shame as like BJ's ,just not this location. It's a stone throw from laguna hills mall so is real busy and crowded! The staff seem real overwhelmed!"
