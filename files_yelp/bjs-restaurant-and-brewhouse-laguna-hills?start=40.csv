Dr. W.,"Irvine, CA",19,12,13,5.0,12/27/2017,"Friendly local place.  Their kale salad and salmon are my favorites.  Great to watch sports, too."
Rebecca C.,"Laguna Hills, CA",0,8,1,1.0,11/11/2017,Bjs as an establishment is overall fairly good but this particular location does not represent the name well. Our experience started with a wait time quoted for fifteen minutes. We ended up waiting 50 and watched numerous parties who arrived after us go in. When asking the host when we would be seated we were told we were the next party and then watched at least six more parties go in front of us. After being seated we waited 10 minutes to be greeted. The food was average but the wait time and poor service took away from it. Would not recommend. There are better establishments nearby that have tastier food and better staff.
Margaret L.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",1,76,,3.0,6/18/2017,"Good things first. Generous lunch portions and a huge menu selection.  Our lunches: chicken lettuce wraps and salmon entree dish. Lettuce was fresh, the chicken flavored nicely & topped with crunchy wontons. Salmon dish OK.  Our waiter service was good. Front desk needs organization. Restaurant was not full but any more than 4 people waiting to check in seem to unnerve the hostesses ( 3 or 4 girls not exactly knowing what their job is). Told to seat ourselves in upper floor area which happened to be OK but the restaurant had many tables open. By the time we left the restaurant many tables were booked and seemed chaotic and noisy with employees running around in all directions."
Chey P.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",31,327,6473,3.0,6/24/2016,"We only waited around 6 minutes tonight to be seated for dinner. We ordered calamari for an appetizer. It was fine.  My husband had the Barbacoa chicken with rice and beans from the enlightened menu and he liked it and filled him up. My daughter ordered the bigger kids grilled chicken Alfredo with broccoli and garlic knots with a side of mashed potatoes. She enjoyed her meal but did not like the garlic knots. The mashed potatoes are really good. I had the appetizer root beer ribs with siracha slaw. Perfect portion for me and I thought the ribs were really tasty and so was the siracha slaw. I had a side of rice pilaf and it was fine. We also tried the ""healthier"" root beer and it was an okay substitute to regular root beer. We were too full for Pizookie tonight. We had an awesome experience tonight. We waited about 10 minutes to be seated but there was a guy giving out pizza while you waited. The hostess was very friendly and our waitress was great. I tried the gluten free pizza today and I really liked it. The gluten free Pizookie was also good.  My husband and daughter got their usual pasta and chicken and Barbacoa chicken with rice and black beans. We also had the calamari to start with. Food was good and the best part was how the manager Tom came over and introduced himself. Thanks for the excellent customer service you provided today!  Our visit on 6/24- we sat at the patio and I didn't enjoy my meal today. I asked for medium sirloin and I got medium rare and it was cold. They cooked it again and it was still red in the middle. It needed more seasoning and the side broccoli was dry even though I asked if they could add butter."
Anastazia V.,"Mission Viejo, CA",73,344,698,2.0,5/5/2016,"I try to avoid coming to this restaurant because the service - ever since I can remember - has always been terrible - it's not only this location either - every BJ's I've ever been to has slow, slow service.  It's not necessarily the attitude of the server's either, for example, last night our server was pleasant, it's just the fact that everything takes FOREVER.   We stopped by here for a drink and some fries while we waited for my glasses at LH mall.  When we arrived the parking lot was full and there was a wait but we just walked to the bar and seated ourselves.  It was full but there was one dirty high top we sat at and a server came by and cleaned it and promptly brought us menus and took our drink order.   They had $5 call drinks which was nice and it was still happy hour.  Our drinks took a while to come out but the side of fries came out almost instantly (and were delicious!).  We asked for our check as we were sort of in a hurry to get back to the mall before 8pm but it took at least 10 minutes for her to bring it to us. I definitely don't blame the server for the slow service because she was constantly touching tables and serving food.  Bottom line seems to be this restaurant is understaffed.  Management should schedule more staff during busy hours and maybe service wouldn't be so slow."
Faye U.,"Los Angeles, CA",20,164,,1.0,10/7/2017,"We used to come here alot.  It was cool back when Christopher was waiter, then bartender.  After he moved on, the hh bartender was a short lady long straight blonde hair in a ponytail and she, like Chris, took pride in her work no matter how busy it got. Last time we went, we sat at the bar as usual and the service was lousy.  Bartenders were clumsy, spilling and dropping stuff on us and not even apologizing.  Nobody ever bothered to clear away my empty plate.  I complained to one of my dining companions and he chalked it up to them being millenials.  Whatever.  IIRC, Chris was also a millenial, and he was pleasant, courteous and gave a damn.  It's not the fault of when the staff were born, that's all on poor management's lack of training and oversight. This place has gone to the dogs, literally - someone who wasn't even blind took their dog INSIDE of there...yuck!  That's a Health Dept. violation.  One of my dining companions said it was for anxiety, but isn't that what meds are for?!  C'mon, who're they kidding...they don't have agoraphobia, they just wanna show off Fido everywhere.  LEAVE YOUR DAMN DOG AT HOME!  Gift card policies have changed for the worse.  This was never a problem when Chris and the short blondie tended bar.  Now, they try to automatically deduct a 20% gratuity from the card, so there's less credit from the actual order.  First off, these clowns did not merit a 20% tip at all.  2nd, the manager escorted my man out when he told her how upset he was about this.  This led him to believe he'd been comped for his troubles, but NO.   Once we were home, I fell asleep early, but was woken by incessant ringing and knocking on the door.  It was the OC Sheriff collecting on my man's bill.  WTF, why didn't the manager collect it at the restaurant instead of treating him like a dine and dash!  How humiliating and it interrupted my sleep not too long after I fell asleep.  Of course the popo had his info from the gift card.  He gave cash to the cops and will have to check the balance on that card in case BJ's double-dipped.   BJs:  Blow this!    Even before all this, I noticed too much price inflation for the quality of food."
Sia D.,"Brea, CA",52,28,2,1.0,10/6/2017,"Downgrade to 1 star. This is the most inept kitchen staff I've ever experienced in a restaurant. My guacamole bacon cheeseburger had no cheese, guac tomatoes or onions!! Are you f'in kidding me? Inexcusable."
Steven S.,"Lake Forest, CA",34,151,3,1.0,9/4/2017,Last night (Sunday) Worst service in recent memory. The laguna hills location was clean but the server was a moron.
Marissa L.,"Mission Viejo, CA",254,503,1089,4.0,9/27/2016,"I came for a quick early lunch with my Mom on a Monday. The place was pretty empty, but filled up quickly closer to lunch time. We sat at a booth in the bar area. Our waiter, Diego, was very nice and friendly. I wish he had informed me on all their different iced teas before I just ordered a regular one, though. We ended up splitting a BJs Supreme small deep dish pizza with added Italian sausage topping. The pizza was delicious. I especially love their pizza dough and crust here. All the toppings were fresh too. It was a nice and easy lunch."
Brianne T.,"San Diego, CA",26,57,116,4.0,11/28/2017,"Twice coming to this business location. Twice I've had good service and good food. They were lightning fast to get the kid's food to us. They prolly know what's up with kids, hunger, and lack of patience. Our son loved their garlic knots, and their crispy chicken tenders were so crunchy yet so soft and easy to eat. WOW! Fries were good too. I had their shrimp and penne with red sauce. That is soooo good. Would have liked more vegetables and shrimp, though. Hubby ordered the full rack of ribs. ....and ate the entire plate. He's not a big guy just has a big appetite. A huge compliment to the kitchen for appealing to his tastebuds. He was a happy man leaving the restaurant. I did notice that the only friendly people in Irvine are the servers (hosts, too! anyone in the service element). Everyone else are stuck-up entitled little snobs. I won't be going to this restaurant often due to the city's community, but know that this is a FRIENDLY place, and you will find a SMILE at BJ's when you need to come in from the icy, inconsiderate hell of Irvine. Thank you!"
Spencer G.,"Fountain Valley, CA",7,3,,5.0,8/18/2017,"Allyson is a phenomenal server, her upbeat personality and hard working demeanor made for one of the most enjoyable experiences I've had at a BJs in a while. She made my entire party laugh. Also special shoutout to our food runner, Abby who made an extra effort to bring refills and present our order in a timely, and accurate fashion. She will make an amazing server one day."
Joe F.,"Los Gatos, CA",0,5,,2.0,3/31/2017,Good for the appetizer but when it came to the  service and main course it  fell apart. They can't seem to handle the volume of customers. Stay away from this place.
Abdullrahman A.,"Irvine, CA",5,14,14,5.0,7/15/2017,"Really good pizza, a bit expensive but really good. The service is great and the place is nicely designed. The desert is also really good, I tried the triple chocolate and it was awesome."
Maeta B.,"Fountain Valley, CA",0,11,,1.0,7/21/2017,All large groups were sat outside on patio without A/C in the summertime. Seemed like they just wanted to pack in as many customers as possible to make as much money as possible.  Inside the restaurant was nice and cool but we were ushered onto packed patio where all large groups were being seated. No a/c - only ceiling fans were on. Service was horrible - one in our party didn't get what she ordered - then it was brought out and was the wrong item. So finally she got her food 30 minutes after everyone else.
Lori P.,"Fallbrook, CA",0,53,14,1.0,3/5/2017,Just wondering why this restaurant smells like bathrooms. Food is over priced and cheap. Pizza nothing like Chicago style! Don't waste your money here not worth it.
Margo M.,"Dana Point, CA",107,16,1,5.0,5/27/2017,"I booked BJ's for a large party after one of my book signings. They were super friendly and easy to deal with and gave me a nice space on the large patio for our group. Ryanne, our waitress at first said she wasn't sure if they could do separate checks for our party of about 20 people, but when I told her we really needed that, she quickly said she would find a way to make it happen. It was a Saturday dinner crowd, so the patio quickly filled up with other diners and large parties, but Ryanne remained our server through the entire evening and took great care of us.  She was attentive, got everyone's order right and despite a bit of a wait, the food came out nice and hot. Everyone was really happy with the quality, taste and size of the portions. The prime rib was excellent, as well as the stuffed mushroom appetizers, the egg roll appetizers and the spinach dip. I heard someone raving about the ribs, too.  I could not have asked for better service. Ryanne was on top of all our requests and was super fast in getting us anything we needed. Better yet, she presented me with a special dessert to celebrate my book debut and even took time to ask me about my book.  This was an important night in my life, and it could have easily been ruined. instead, they made a great day even more wonderful."
William H.,"Laguna Woods, CA",0,11,,1.0,10/6/2017,Service is consistently bad. Food comes late and is cold. Such a shame and shows the consequences of bad management.
Richard C.,"Honolulu, HI",41,2,1,1.0,9/15/2017,Place sucks if you have a big group... Party of 8 or more.. You'll have to wait longer since they'll assist other people first because of how their tables are set up.
Donald E.,"Laguna Hills, CA",0,1,,5.0,10/13/2017,Great service.  Thank you ED ... I really appreciate  the Great service and attention to my order !
Joe F.,"Los Gatos, CA",0,2,1,1.0,9/23/2017,Nothing looks like the pictures in the menu. Very disappointing. Went for Brunch and the pancakes and eggs and fruit dish were a major let down.
