Christina J.,"San Clemente, CA",0,21,,1.0,9/20/2015,"Highly Disappointed. We have gone to this restaurant for years and throughout the years we have been disappointed. We went a few nights ago and ordered three pizzas, beer, and salads. The beer and salads were fine, however, one of our pizzas was so beyond burnt. They attempted to melt cheese and place toppings on top of the burnt cheese and pizza so we wouldn't notice, but when u picked up The pizza the entire top fell off. It was disgusting and we were baffled that they would even serve something like that. We had it sent back ( which we never do) and it came out 25 minutes later. By that time half of the party was already finished eating. The other two pizzas were not burnt but had no flavor and were cold. We were not compensated anything. This review is based of off several poor visits, but this last one way the last straw. needless to say we we won't be going back anytime soon."
Blake S.,"Redding, CA",1,21,1,2.0,6/26/2014,"Food was good, pizza a little dry doughy, but not bad with ranch. Place is very noisy, & busy for a week day evening. Service was pleasant but slow, had to ask for refills several times. If you want some beer & munchies with your buddies not a bad place, party atmosphere! Not so hot for a date, parents, kids or quite relaxing meal out!"
Alli J.,"Anaheim, CA",0,75,10,5.0,6/25/2014,"My family loves this place! Pazooki's yum!! Enough about dessert, the staff here are great. We had Taylor on June 12,, she is very personable and attentive. No matter what happens (she dropped a drink), the staff makes the best of it and remains professional, even after she dropped the drink, she jokingly asked if we saw it, and let us know it would be a few minutes before she returned as she was soaked. She never appeared frazzled or embarrassed she just took it all in stride and continued! Awesome staff and food!!"
Kel B.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",0,55,26,2.0,9/2/2013,"Oh, and the pizza came out raw when I was writing this review. When I pointed it out to the manager he admitted it looked doughy. His next question surprised me: "" Do you want a new pizza?""  No, I want to eat raw pizza!?!?"
Erin T.,"Irvine, CA",189,396,22,3.0,5/18/2012,"I usually don't have high reviews for chain restaurants and this place is no exception... The food is isn't bad, it's just not spectacular. I honestly don't think there's anything unique about their menu - granted, I came here for lunch with some co-workers. What I can say though is that Bj's, and any other chain restaurant like it are great places for groups of people because there is something for everybody.  We tried the lunch menu and I liked the variety of it: there was pizza, salad, soup and sandwich combos, fried chicken and mashed potatoes, and tacos all for under $12. I chose the Mahi Mahi tacos. There wasn't anything stand out about it. It was a piece of under seasoned mahi mahi and cabbage in between a flour tortilla and served with a lime wedge. I am glad that it wasn't overcooked or undercooked though! It also came with small cups of Guacamole, salsa, and a side of multicolored tortilla chips. I really think the Mahi Mahi could have used a flavorful sauce. Chronic tacos serves theirs with a chronic sauce, which gives a pop to their tacos - Bj's just gave me a lime wedge and apparently wanted me to hide the fact that it's under seasoned with salsa and creamy guac. I may not be a Mexican food connoisseur but I'm pretty sure salsa and guac can't fix everything - even Albatross's tacos have some more flavor. Before I upgrade or downgrade the rating I will probably have to try some other things on the menu. I do think that the service could use some help. I understand that it is a Friday around lunch hour but it's near a lot of businesses, people only really have an hour to eat lunch...it should not take me 20 minutes to get my drink and order and another 20 minutes to get my food.... I'm not sure if it was the waiter's fault or if the restaurant just needs to streamline their lunch hour service - luckily for me my boss isn't a huge stickler for going over my lunch hour because I tend to stay later anyways, but for those who have people counting their every minute....this may not be the best choice for lunch."
Maddy S.,"Laguna Beach, CA",0,4,,2.0,7/18/2015,"I went to this restaurant a few weeks back and was surprised and the lack of service my friends and I received. Our wait to be seated wasn't very long, but my friend was on crutches and they sat us at the very very back of the restaurant. The person who seated us said she didn't understand why the head hostess put us back there, but that should couldn't do much about it. Our waitress was rude when we told her we needed more time and when our food came it was lukewarm and my friends pasta had no sauce on it at all. The only reason this restaurant is getting 2 starts instead of one is because of the kind hostess who sat us and my Pazookie. My friends Pazookie was cold and extremely hard to get off the plate."
Bill C.,"La Quinta, CA",1,22,,2.0,1/14/2013,Food good service still poor  training training   still slow  service the kitchen must ask and ask for things that are forgotten to be served still slow
Alex G.,"Los Angeles, CA",47,14,2,2.0,4/6/2012,"This review is based off of two things: service and gluten free pizza.  Service- It was good, nothing great or special. I would give it 3.5 stars. Server seemed a bit overwhelmed, but managed to get us everything we needed. Our wait was 10 minutes longer than the quoted 15 minutes, meaning I probably should have grabbed a cocktail at the bar for the wait.  Gluten Free Pizza- eek, really not that great. At all. I was rooting for this, hoping it would be a new GF option for me. I would have preferred Udi's frozen pizza crust. I got the vegetarian pizza and added pineapple. The pizza was soggy in the middle, the crust was super thin and really should have been cooked longer. I ended up eating the olives, pineapple and the crust. Major disappointment. Will not be back to eat the pizza.  If there is a next time,  I will try the GF chocolate chip pizookie."
Ali G.,"Irvine, CA",0,25,17,5.0,7/12/2015,"It was my first visit here , I love their deep dish pizza , it was full house , and food was great , server was kind of funny"
David R.,"Lake Forest, CA",9,13,,4.0,11/12/2013,The food here is excellent and i love the brewery. Customer service is great no problem so far I've been coming here for years. Only a few forgivable mistakes.  Careful on the recipe though they put a 15% gratitude suggestion but if you calculate it yourself in actuality is 25% gratitude. Love the pozukis!!
Jeanine W.,"London, United Kingdom",719,183,58,1.0,8/23/2011,"What started off as a decent dinner experience quickly went down the toilet the following day. Literally.  During my first visit here with 4 other friends the place was poppin' from the Monday Night football crowd, and though we only had to wait a couple minutes to be seated, our food took forever. I mean FOR-EV-ER. We asked ourselves multiple times where our waitress/food was. I took off a couple stars for the wait alone, but the stomach flu I had to deal with the next day that left me in bed until 6PM was the nail in the coffin. Now, all my other friends seemed to enjoy their food just fine, so maybe it was just what I ordered. I'll be sure to stay away from the Italian Market Salad at other locations, and make the drive to the BJ's in Tustin next time."
Melissa L.,"Lake Forest, CA",129,30,52,2.0,9/30/2011,"I came here craving Fettuccine Alfredo and pizza, but I couldn't decide between the two so I just ordered the Great White pizza (Alfredo sauce with mushrooms, garlic, seasoned tomatoes, Parmesan cheese and grilled chicken breast.) I was thinkin that this was the most genius decision I had ever made- but I was really disappointed. The pizza didn't taste like it had any of those ingredients in it except for the seasoned tomatoes. I had also ordered a root beer to guzzle with the outstanding pizza I thought I was going to have, but the drink itself wasn't even good. The soda was really syrupy and flat and didn't have any ice- it basically looked like it had been sitting in the kitchen waiting to be discarded.  All in all- MEH!  BJ's can't even get the soda right, so why come back at all."
J P.,"Washington, DC",151,319,52,3.0,7/10/2011,"mmm 3.5.... I love BJs.  This one was huge and seemed ""high end"" so we had high hopes.  Service was great, but a note to management-perhaps you should hire a new kitchen staff as a kitchen crew who can't handle pressure is non conducive to you your business. The manager literally had to come up to us and every other table to apologize as they screwed up every order. in fact, they screwed up our order 3x- til we finally said ""fuck it."" the kitchen was ""backed up"" so food took forever.  -the stuffed mushrooms had onions- alot.  the veggie pasta with no onions- had onions -the veggie pizza with no onions- had SAUSAGE. -then the 2nd time around, the pasta was OK, but then my now sausage less pizza STILL had onions. our waiter was so mortified; we saw him write down the order so we know it wasn't his fault.  They comped is for a free dessert and discounted an entree, but i think it would be better for management just to hire a new kitchen."
Amy D.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",8,148,43,2.0,11/1/2011,"This place is such a hit and miss. I've been here a few times now.  Depending on the day you go, the time, where you sit, and who your server is, you can either get great service, mediocre service or bad service. Saturday night, I was the lucky recipient of a bad time.  I came here to carb load the night before my half marathon run, and to watch the Standford v SC game.  I scored a table in the bar area.  Our server seemed half friendly enough, took our order after waiting a few minutes but that was about where the goodness ended. While waiting over 40 minutes for our food, I was lucky enough to get to listen to a group of servers behind me kind of ""discussing"" who has what tables and who needs to do what.  It was a little confrontational and unprofessional to say the least, since I was a patron and didn't want to be privy to their issues.  Anyways, about 15 minutes later, two girls were kind of going back and forth and I just hear one girl say ""deal with it!"" then walk away.  Yay!  I love having to listen to these types of conversations while watching the game and starving myself before eating. Anyways, when the food finally came out, I realize my wheat crust BBQ Chicken Pizza was not wheat, but I didn't want to wait another eternity for a corrected pizza.  It also was not hot.  Warm, I would say.  The Basil Chicken Pesto probably was good but I hate when hot food is cold so I just shoveled huge forkfuls into my mouse and chewed and swallowed realy fast.  I didn't realy get to taste it.  Finally, the BBQ Chopped Cobb was good, if you like soupy salads.   Not sure if and when I'll be back.  I think I would rather make the drive to the next closes one in Laguna Beach.  At least if I have to hear people arguing, I may witness and awesome bar fight also."
Stephanie P.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,5,1,3.0,6/4/2014,"Food was good but unfortunately the waitress messed up our bill and charged us more than what we were supposed to pay. Little customer services or at least some retraining in the bar section.  Kendra please try not to mess up any more bills, thanks."
Powell D.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",0,3,,3.0,4/8/2013,"NOT BAD AT ALL!  great pizza and beer! nothing much after that. but hey, thats what you know your walking into."
Elizabeth K.,"Costa Mesa, CA",11,7,,2.0,6/3/2015,"Food is always good, but service is just bad at this restaurant.  My mother in law just moved into a retirement home down the street and we have been to this restaurant twice.  The first time our server was so quiet u couldn't understand him and he was so slow I had to get a different server to help us half the time.  One experience I get it maybe he was new.  Today we got a different server, she got my order and my nieces order wrong.  I'm pregnant and had to wait 20 minutes for a new deep dish to be made...not cool.  No meal comp no apology from management, the cook brought it out and gave me a look without saying a word.  This server bleached blonde pony tail was also slow and could not be found all our drinks were empty and we still could not get water from her.  Again, love the food but will not be visiting this particular BJs again two disappointing trips is enough.  Management needs to work on sense of urgency and customer service with their team."
D W.,"Laguna Woods, CA",0,1,,1.0,12/7/2014,"The online-order-for-curbside-delivery experience broke down this Saturday.  The baked potato sides we ordered were replaced without notice by cold, gummy fried potato chunks. The turkey club came on chewy (in a bad way) white sandwich bread reminiscent of the grocery store value brand; that it was toasted failed to conceal the poor quality. The medium rare burger we ordered came well done. The avocado egg roll was yummy. Too many good food options in the area to venture another $40 at BJ's anytime soon."
Michael V.,"Mission Viejo, CA",67,50,2,4.0,2/28/2012,"Bernie and I wanted to try something different, as we were completely burned out of Oggi's and their quality has gone downhill.  A majority of the time we utilize delivery because the twins are in bed by 7:30 and after the amount of work for feedings and baths I don't feel like picking anything up. The new BJ's in RSM doesn't delivery yet so we gave the one in LH a call.  The food was great.  We ordered calamari (delicious), chicken marsala (Bernie loved it and I thought it was super moist), and I had the fish and chips (very good).  I know, not the diet of a guy that needs to lose the same 20 pounds for the past 3 years! One of the highlights was the serve who delivered the food.  He made it a point to tell us the the 10% delivery fee went directly to him as a tip.  I always thought the company kept that.  I was so happy that I tipped him another 20%!   The guy was so nice, and afterwards he said, ""Thank you for your grace!""  Super cool, or maybe I'm super sensitive because I have 2 daughters now. We will repeat."
Marti L.,"El Toro, CA",0,12,1,5.0,6/30/2014,Food is ok.  But our server Troy was the nicest most sincere server ever.  I went late with my daughter and he took such good care of us.  I had to say something nice about him here because he was that good.  Thanks for a great night out Troy. (:
