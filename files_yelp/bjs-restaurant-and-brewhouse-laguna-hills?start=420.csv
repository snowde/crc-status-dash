Karen G.,"Laguna Woods, CA",0,11,1,1.0,4/4/2015,We ordered the new flat  bread pizza- all there was was bread we complained. Waiter did not care but offered  us something else . We got a deep dish pizza- again just dough apparently BJ's cannot afford toppings for their pizzas! More profit for the company sucks
Jennifer L.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",509,501,67,4.0,12/16/2011,"This is my favorite BJ's in the Orange County area. I came here with some of my co workers for a get together recently, and it was a good experience. Every time I  go out to dinner with a large party (there were 11 of us) I always wonder how it's going to end up. We sat out on the covered patio....it seems like they seat all of their large parties outside on the patio. The server that we had (we actually had 2, but the first one that comes to mind...) did a good job of taking care of all of us and also splitting the bill at end between multiple cards and cash...  Compared to the last time I was here, it seems like they have re-vamped their menu with quite a few new appetizers, alcoholic drinks, and entrees. The menu pretty much has something for everyone. I have never had a bad meal at BJ's...I love their deep dish pizzas (any kind, really) , the turkey cobb sandwich, barbecue chicken salad, and a few of the pasta dishes. If you are a beer/liquor fan, you will be in heaven here, since like 3 pages of their menu is strictly alcohol. And the pazookies....OMG! My group had the giant pazookie with 4 different kinds..including a new one that I didn't know they had, red velvet....you have to try a pazookie at least once in your life! Like I said, they really do have something for everyone!! This is a good place to come with a group because of that. BJ's is family friendly, and also a decent place to come for happy hour and to watch a game, since they have multiple big screen TVs in the bar area."
Chelsey V.,"Oklahoma City, OK",336,182,157,1.0,5/30/2011,"BJs has great food but unfortunately the service stinks!  I have been 3 times praying for better service and it never came.  Servers being rude, forgetting peoples food, taking forever to do anything.  I guess I should just try take out?  Until the servers learn how to serve I probably wont be back for a while."
David A.,"Palm Springs, CA",18,46,1,2.0,3/5/2014,"Thank god the beer was really good (Hopstorm IPA - hoppy makes me happy!).  The food however was terrible.  The side caeser salad had wilted lettuce and no flavor and the California Club flatbread pizza was seriously weird, not very hot and I think had three tiny cubes of chicken on it.  On a more positive note, service was efficient - even a little too efficient since they brought the pizza about five minutes after the salad.  Would be one star if not for the beer."
Eric B.,"Orange County, CA",31,99,9,4.0,5/17/2011,"I've been a big fan of BJ's for many years and have eaten at quite a few of them. They are all very consistent with each other. The beers are really good. I don't drink any more, but used to come here when I did. I really enjoyed the Tatonka Stout (an Imperial Stout). The only thing I can really mark them down for is their menu. It's about 50 pages and small. It gets kind of dark in there and the menu can be a little hard to read sometimes. It also seems like the first half of the menu is drinks. Yeah, I know this is a bar, but come on, that's a lot of pages to flip through just to get to the food. Speaking of the food... wait, I'm going to skip to the desserts first. Save room for the Chocolate chip Pazooki! Repeat... Save room for the chocolate chip pazooki. And get some coffee with it. Their coffee is some of the best I have ever had! You will thank me later. I've had a lot of different things on the menu here and have really enjoyed all of it. There hasn't been an item that I have eaten yet that I didn't enjoy. The chicken fried steak is really good, but get some extra gravy because they don't seem to put enough on it. My favorite right now is the grilled pork chops with green beans and mashed potatoes. They serve it with some apples and mustard. Great combination! And their coffee goes really great with the pork (I love that combination). This is also a fun to place to come and drink and watch some games. They have a huge bar area and plenty of TVs spread around the whole restaurant. This also means that this place is loud. And I mean LOUD. So don't expect to come here for a quiet meal. They can also get packed pretty quickly, so be prepared to wait a little if you come here at a busy time."
Jeff D.,"Anaheim, CA",0,7,6,2.0,7/24/2014,Food is excellent but mixed drinks are painfully pitiful...guess it's a beer only bar because they can't make a mixed drink to save themselves. ..stick to food and drink elsewhere. ..
Katrina L.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",0,10,,4.0,4/27/2015,"Both service and food are inconsistent...sometimes my husband and I have a spectacular dining experience and other times, not so much. I'm giving this establishment 4 stars rather than 3 because despite a couple of bad visits, we've had a good number of enjoyable visits. The last time we encountered an issue, Jennifer, the manager, was very courteous and prompt in rectifying the situation which we really appreciated. The food and atmosphere are good so we'll be back...we just won't know what kind of service to expect!"
Suzan C.,"Irvine, CA",3,27,4,5.0,3/20/2014,We love Bj's! They have great tasting food and different kinds of food for everyone.  The service was great and the people were friendly.  The bar was the best to sit for entertainment! And of course who doesn't like the pizookies here! Yum yum!
JB B.,"Mission Viejo, CA",1,62,6,4.0,2/23/2014,Ribeye is always cooked to perfection. Love the service and they always get my Midori Sour right! One star off for the hideous parking every single time we go.
Sonya R.,"Monrovia, CA",201,197,1,4.0,10/17/2011,"Short and sweet.  We got there late Sunday night (driving back from San Diego to LA), place was closing up the kitchen, but the staff welcomed us in anyways and sat us down, and several different people made sure we were taken care of in terms of getting our drinks and food to us quickly. The BJ's pizza special was great, and I had to have a pazookie cookie pizza, but only as motitvation tools to get my butt up the next hike. I am letting my body go SOFT, so I can't eat at places like BJ's too often. But when I do want to treat myself to a slice, I will get my juices going at BJs, Wait, somehow that sounds wrong.....  :)"
Amanda M.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",2,9,1,3.0,6/12/2015,"Made a reservation here recently for a large party for a Saturday evening birthday dinner. When we arrived, we were told that there was no record of our reservation and that the wait would be about an hour for a table. This is not the first time our reservations have been lost at this location. After speaking to a manager, we were given a table within 10 minutes. Food was good and service was attentive once we were seated. If you're looking for something on the lighter side, the Hawaiian Mahi is amazing!"
Stephen W.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",91,120,26,4.0,12/30/2011,"Went here for happy hour last week.  Good beer, quality food, and the ambiance is pretty nice.  I had the stout beer that they brew and it is really good.  My wife had the brown ale, also really good.  For food, we had the mushroom/balsamic pizza.  It really hit the spot.   I have been to a lot of BJ's restaurants and this one stands out in my mind.  If you haven't been, it's worth the visit!"
Jason N.,"Lake Forest, CA",43,70,299,3.0,3/27/2012,"I've been here several times and haven't been disappointed yet.  There menu is huge with lots of different choices.   The pizza's are great, piled high with your favorite toppings.  They also have great salads.  My son loves the deserts here.   several different cookies served warm is a small pizza pan with ice cream on top.  what more could you ask for?"
Lauren M.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",191,185,48,4.0,12/16/2013,This is a very large bjs located close to the mall. Bjs always bring back fond memories and I always enjoy both the food and experiences here. I love getting their samplers: you can choose up to 8 of their beers. They always have a seasonal to mix things up a bit. My favorite thing to order is their clam chowder bread bowl . It is soon yummy with the top of the bowl being converted into a piece of garlic bread. I also enjoy their pizzas and lettuce wraps. And the bonus is always their pazookie...delicious! And always a fun time
Archie S.,"Lake Forest, CA",613,452,508,4.0,10/31/2011,"Great place to socialize and snack on good food. Just make sure not to order too much, easier said than done though cause everything looks so good!"
Dave L.,"Mission Viejo, CA",294,31,14,4.0,5/17/2011,"BJs seems like they are trying to be like the Cheesecake Factory. A very extensive menu which means there is something for everyone. They don't have cheesecake desserts but of course, they have Pazooki. Must be eaten there though. Not the kind of thing that can be taken ""to go."" Our service was decent when we went. It took a long time to get our food but we had a larger group (about 12-13 of us). The manager gave us 3 Pazookis because our food took so long but that was only because one of our members asked them to do it for us. Still, it was nice to get for free. Would definitely recommend. Lots on the menu and the food was good too."
J M.,"Foothill Ranch, CA",95,268,50,2.0,10/19/2013,"I am a huge fan of BJ's, but from our last order of food at this location....I'm not too happy anymore.  To get to the point, the Oktoberfest beer is great, but the pizza that we ordered was given to us warm and the crust wasn't the awesome crust I've come to know and love about BJ's pizza.  This time, the pizza crust was soft, no crunch throughout like I am used to.  Don't know why I never thought to complain about it.  Took most of the pizza home.  It'll be better after we put it in the oven."
Erik P.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",4,77,13,4.0,2/20/2014,Always good food and good service.  I'd give 5 stars if there was a better beer selection.  House beers are mediocre and should be priced a bit lower.
Todd S.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,20,,1.0,7/24/2013,"Pizza was cold and the cheese wasn't even melted.  I mentioned it to the server and she said, ""Well I can get you a free dessert"". Wrong answer. Customer Service 101 = The customer is always right.  That goes for any business.  Needless to say dont go to this BJ's location if it appears there are alot of people waiting around.  This just means its over capacity and service is going to be slow."
Ally E.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",0,3,,1.0,3/25/2014,"Just went with my best friend. She ordered a drink, I was DD. No complaints about the drink. We ordered 2 appetizers: calamari and spinach and artichoke dip. Calamari was tasteless, and the dip was alright. Ordered a mini salted caramel pizookie, which was amazing.  The actually horrible part of our experience was the service. We were seated promptly as they were not busy, and our server appeared not long thereafter, if a bit uninterested and droll. He took our drink order, came back with our drinks, and took our food order. Food eventually came out, and our server DISAPPEARED. Never checked on us, only came by once to tell us that his shift was ending, and we could tell he had one foot out the door, and pointed out his replacement who would ""be coming by to introduce himself soon."" Server #2 asked us how everything was going -- 20 minutes later -- and we asked for napkins (note that we hadn't been given napkins OR utensils, before OR after receiving our food). Took server #2 15 minutes to come back with the napkins. Took him another 15 minutes to come by and ask us if we needed anything else. We ordered dessert, which came in a reasonable amount of time, and with the check. It took another 15 minutes for someone to come and take our payment. This whole time, we watched both of our servers repeatedly visiting, checking on, and chatting with other tables. I counted several servers, and it was a quiet Tuesday night, so we can't exactly chalk up the neglect to being understaffed; I can only assume that they didn't take us or our business seriously because our bill wasn't going to yield them a substantial tip.  Won't be coming back. EVER."
