Brooke F.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,16,,5.0,9/13/2012,"I love this place!! Every time I am home on a break I come here at least 1 time. I am obsessed with there tomato soup in a bread bowl. So good!! I am not normally a soup person but I love it here. The top of the bread bowl is toasty with garlic and butter on it, perfect to dip in the soup. I always get it even when it is hot out. The pizza is also good here. I love the sweet pig pizza, it is the Hawaiian. Has ham and pineapple on it.  I always have to save room for the Pazooki. Amazing, would doesn't love a freshly baked cookie that is still a little doughy and warm topped with ice cream . I love getting the peanut butter one."
Luis L.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,19,,1.0,7/5/2013,"So BJ's in general, any of their locations, is one of the slowest Restaurants to serve food. Well, this location Tops them all...1 1/2 hrs to get our food, if it wasnt for the beers, it would've been misserable. On to the other issues: 1) when have you seen a ""yellow"" clam chowder? Well, they seem to think its normal. 2) Your plate with Bell Peppers? They have it! But they won't take the label off the pepper, nice! 3) Buffalo Chicken Pizza? Yes! but you'll get the least cheese you'll ever see!...not much left to say, if I ever go back, it will never be to this location."
Lisa Z.,"Laguna Hills, CA",96,151,51,4.0,7/13/2011,"There's only so many places you can go with your two kids in tow that has pretty good drinks and fairly decent food. I swear I need a break from Island's! So, on the recommendation of a friend with kids the same age as mine (8 & 10), we headed off to BJ's.  I was lucky/smart/naive enough to call before we left and got on the call-ahead wait list, which I highly recommend. We were seated pretty quickly on a Friday night, which is practically unheard of. Our service was great, even with the ""I'm going on my break now so Sue will be taking over"" speech.  There really was something for everyone. My husband was feeling extra gluttonous so he ordered the chicken fried steak. Everyone at the table was asking for multiple bites. It was good and not gristly like most CFS I've had. I hunkered down with some decent grilled chicken and rice and the kids got the ever-popular chicken fingers and pizza. All around good.  As for the drinks, a decent poor - which is really all I ask. It doesn't have to take the barnacles off my hull, just not taste completely like mixer. The real kicker was when the manager came up and said she had one-too many deserts in the back and asked if we'd like one on the house. Well, hells yes! So they brought out this massive cookie in a pizza pan topped with ice cream and all kinds of goodness. We were like jackals at a fresh kill.  We backed in a crane to get my husband out of the booth after CFS & spaceship cookie desert, then headed out. All-in-all a really good experience.  BJ's has been added to the approved dining list."
Sam A.,"Oklahoma City, OK",12,106,13,5.0,9/14/2011,"This place is great!  Great food, great prices and excellent service. Their pizzas are my personal favorite but I also love their grilled chicken pasta dish.  Their beers have unique flavor and are enjoyable, but their seasonals are usually a cut above their year-round beers. The service at this particular location is really great.  They have a ""call-ahead"" program which takes a big chunk out of the wait time.  Their greeters are friendly and efficient.  I have never been let down by the wait staff.  They are very attentive, polite and knowledgeable. This location is really busy so I don't blame the wait staff if the kitchen is backed up, but the way they handle it is really impressive.  Just about every time that I have gone and the food has taken a little long, our watier has always explained that they are busy and working on our food.  That's all I ask--that they act like they care about my experience!  So long as they act like they are attentive, I think most reasonable people wouldn't mind waiting an extra 15-20 minutes for their food. Anyway, great place and great people!  Two thumbs up!"
Marcus C.,"San Clemente, CA",6,6,,2.0,3/8/2015,"Is it just me or has this location under gone  a change for the worst. For years i have been coming to this location and always had great service and great food but in the last 6 months something has changed. Tonight was the kicker... was not greated when i walked in, ok so it was busy and that can slide. The hostess took our name and told us 15 minutes. When they called out name another hostess took us to our table but aeemed she was bothered by her job and no personality.  Usually  we are walked back by a tall alim gentleman that asks us how our day is and has a great smile... makes you feel invited and warm. The server was the next person of interaction. .. no people skills, brings drinks with mo straws ( ok no big deal) but then puts our straws on the table. Since they are not in paper i am not puttinf them in my drink. Food had great flavor like always but was warm at best.  Im not one to return food as i hate pissing off the wait staff.  Next a female manager (that looks like she got dressed in the dark) picks up our plates and asks if we need anything. I requested a box. After 20 minutes i decide im not getting one and the server  offers to bring one. Over all it was not the BJ's experience im used to and it is the 3rd time in a row. I will not go back for at least a few months. Maybe by then it will be back to normal."
Donnie H.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",131,21,3,1.0,10/20/2013,"Called in a simple takeout order. 2 orders of wings and a pizookie. The wings weren't tossed in sauce, nor was there any sauce on the side. The pizookie was supposed to be half chocolate chip, half macadamia nut. Instead, we only got chocolate chip, and it only filled up about 60% of the tin.  Not coming back..."
W C.,"Irvine, CA",5,133,25,4.0,10/18/2013,The beer selection makes this place. One of the few places that carry La Chouffe. It's probably the best Belgian beer out there. And it's well priced for what it is. The open face chili cheeseburger is always my goto menu item when I'm starving and don't mind feeling like a fat slob after I inhale the gigantic plate of food. It's HUGE! You can seriously just split that plate with someone and both of you will get full. I'm usually not a fan of the house brews but the pumpkin ale they had on tap for fall was very good. Give it a shot!
Emily W.,"Laguna Beach, CA",5,9,4,5.0,1/30/2015,William was our server tonight. He was great!!! So attentive and came and checked on us multiple times. It's rare to see such great customer service these days. I wish all the servers I've interacted with at this location were as great as him. Great experience. I'll be back.
Matt R.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",0,1,,1.0,2/6/2016,"Visited on a late Sunday afternoon, restaurant was semi-busy. We we're told 5 mins, turned into 20 mins. We were looking forward to the meal so the wait was not an issue. The young, petite, Mexican hostess took the 2 of us to a table in the middle of the dining area, I asked if we could get a booth & it went downhill from there. After she took a deep breath, she turned around & kicked the chair & proceeded to tell us yeah we could go over to a near by booth. You would have thought this effected her in some way. My wife & I were both blown away by her actions & it made both of us feel very uncomfortable. She threw our menus down & walked away without a word. While waiting for our server we could see the hostess telling over server we had moved from the table to the booth, again very uncomfortable. And to top it off the booth was in the same section as the table for our server. Our server was ok, but we were both so uncomfortable at his point our visit was ruined. We contemplated speaking to a manager about the hostess but no manager ever came by our table. On our way out we did see the manager but he looked to busy hanging out with 2 of the female servers by the bar so we decided our complaint wouldn't make a difference if we interrupted him. We have been to this location several times & have always had great service but we will not return to his location. We have never encountered a hostess that acted this way & still cannot believe she acted the way she did. Someone needs to be aware of the person at the front of their restaurant & make a change before more loyal customers are lost."
Cindy A.,"Orange, CA",1,11,1,4.0,3/2/2014,"Some friend and myself had a great relaxing evening here at BJ's.  The drinks were fabulous, I had a root beer with whiskey and butterscotch.  The food was great.  We had great service also."
Joe S.,"Livermore, CA",44,65,1,5.0,11/8/2011,"I'm giving this BJ's restaurant 5 stars. Why? Because it's clean and more often than not, the food is good.  The service?  Eh, it's hit and miss, as with any restaurant, so I won't really factor that in. Also, the server's that i've gotten have always been nice and attentive. I've been to a many different BJ's Restaurants all over So Cal and this one is by far my favorite. Even the bathrooms are nice!"
Martin H.,"Aurora, CO",0,16,,1.0,2/23/2015,"Waited for someone to take my food order for 15 minutes during the dinner time. After no acknowledgment  I left and went to another restaurant near by.   They were busy, however this does not excuse total neglect of a customer.  Be aware of this problem if you planning a dinner engagement at this location."
Chris C.,"Taylors, SC",0,8,,1.0,4/12/2015,"I ordered mahi mahi from the carry-out menu.  I asked if they could substitute extra vegetables for the fried rice.  No problem, they said.  I also asked them to leave off the ginger-soy sauce on the veggies.  When my order arrived, the first thing I noticed upon removing the lid from the entree was that the serving size was ridiculously small - it covered less than half the plate.  Points deducted for presentation.  Also, their idea of 'extra veggies' definitely wasn't the same as mine.  I'd hate to see what the regular amount looked like.  As a bonus, they hadn't omitted either the rice or the sauce, as I had requested and as was plainly printed on the attached copy of my order.  So I sent it back.  No problem, said the friendly cashier.  But the second time around was little better than the first.  Still no extra veggies, still sauce on the veggies.  By this time I had no time left to send it back again, since I was on a strict travel schedule.  To be fair, the food was of decent quality, but hey - you get the order wrong twice, you get one star."
Tori P.,"Mission Viejo, CA",3,22,,3.0,4/10/2015,"I love BJs but it seems every time I go there we run into some issue, whether it is horrible service from our waiter or our food being cold. The food is always good and they are always quick to solve the problem and are very lenient at discounting when they mess up but it is just a bummer to have something go wrong every time."
Priscilla G.,"Los Angeles, CA",31,153,26,3.0,6/6/2011,"The last couple of times I've been here my group has gotten the same thing: build your own pizza, root beer, and a pizookie.  Their pizza is damn good. We got pepperoni, sausage, and extra cheese. Not much else to say about it other than it hits the spot.  I generally dislike soda, but their root beer is great. Served in a chilled glass, it isn't too carbonated or overly sweet. Mmm, semi-baked cookie with ice cream on top that should be spelled pazookie and not pizookie, mmm. You can't go to BJ's without getting one, it just feels wrong. The service at this location has been mostly good except for our last time here. Our female server had attitude, rarely checked on us, and walked away from us mid-sentence (was it your ""week""?). Not worth complaining to a manager or anything, but irritating nonetheless.  We'll probably go back to this location, we'll just avoid Ms. Crabby Pants."
Edward P.,"Laguna Hills, CA",2,83,1,5.0,1/13/2012,"My favorite lunch place. Sit at the bar during the week and say, ""Hi!"" to Jill. Great service and lunch specials that cannot be beat."
Zac R.,"Laguna Beach, CA",0,6,2,1.0,2/18/2013,"This is under my name correctly. Sorry to Tay below, but I didnt realize he was signed in on my computer. Sorry Tay!  So this is a bit of a mixed review. First I just want to say that the entree's were very good, generally always are. Their Pizza is great and the Jumbalaya is even better. However, the service was absolutely atrocious. The waiter was too cool to serve us, and anytime we asked for something it was a burden on his soul. I know it's a bit much to ask, but can I at least have some ketchup for my 4 day old french fries? Oh, and my empty glass will refill itself Im sure. Too bad I'm not more of a dic#, or I might have gone behind the bar to get a refill myself!  At any rate, I will not be returning to this BJ's as the final icing on the cake was that he gave us the wrong flavor of Pizooki we ordered to-go (unless of course Raspberries taste like chocolate chips now). Normally this would not be a game changer, but it just sort of tied a bow on the whole experience. My advice: only eat here if you want bar food, and sit at the bar. If you want good pizza and friendly service go to CPK, or better yet Peppino's!"
Habib H.,"Irvine, CA",0,3,,3.0,2/14/2015,"The food was good, and the service was great ,but the cook messed up one of the pizzas.when i told to the waiter, he called his boss,and his boss offered to give us a new free pizza, but they never gave it to us. We did not asked for it again. We just left"
Betsy C.,"Lake Forest, CA",15,49,36,3.0,8/12/2013,"Pizza and cocktails are our staple at Bj's. They also have these little fried artichokes that they serve with a house made cream sauce that we absolutely love. The problem is that the service is usually hit or miss at this place. Some days we get good servers and some days... Not so much. But every single time, we find ourselves standing in front of the hostess stand waiting while the staff run around for like 15 mins before even acknowledging us. Also, its been more than one occasion that we have had to ask for some Clean silverware. The pizza itself is good but its signature is deep dish so its bready. Pizookies are pretty bomb tho."
T C.,"San Marino, CA",0,7,,2.0,4/1/2015,"Service is severely lacking at this location. Waitress was not attentive at all. Our orders were not delivered correctly, food was cold, and getting it resolved took a long time. Most of our party was done eating by the time the incorrectly delivered orders were replaced. The kitchen staff brought out our meals while our waitress was no where to be found. Not sure where the ball was dropped but either our waitress didn't write down the orders correctly or they were not prepared as ordered. Forget even trying to get our drinks refilled. Better management and maybe some staffing changes are in order."
