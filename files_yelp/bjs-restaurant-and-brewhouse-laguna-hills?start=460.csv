Kenneth D.,"Temecula, CA",129,10,,2.0,3/28/2015,"We love BJ'S except this one in Laguna Woods, California. My Cajon pasta was dry and my wife had broccoli soap in a sour Doug bread bowl. The soup was nasty. We been to several BJ'S and never had a bad meal until this visit."
Derek N. Emmeline A.,"Pomona, CA",6,1,,1.0,11/26/2012,"Horrible Service, POOR Management! If you are looking for a place to celebrate with family and friends this is NOT the place! reserved months in advance for party of 60 people. we were supposed to have a buffet for our rehearsal dinner. staff was unprepared, food did not come out on time and our guests were hungry! The Female manager there is completely INCOMPETENT, and a liar! to cover her ass and so she wouldn't get in trouble she refused to give me the number to corporate! it wasn't until i raised hell that she finally gave it to me! Do NOT go here for an event they will completely screw it up!"
Dalia S.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",0,3,,1.0,3/19/2015,"The worst customer service ever went there 2 times and will never go back there again , if you wanna through your money in the trash go ahead and go there ."
Pam W.,"Orange County, CA",17,10,2,4.0,11/30/2013,The stuffed mushrooms are ridiculously good! I'm addicted. Great beer selection. The pizza is obviously good but all of the other menu options are pretty good considering the big thing is pizza! And then of course the pizookie...nothing better than a warm chocolate chip cookie with ice cream. yum yum
Mary Ann M.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",209,279,30,4.0,7/24/2013,"BJs deep dish pizza is a staple and it is my go-to place for pizzas.  They also have a great happy hour with awesome hours.  Their small bites menu is also pretty good - stuffed mushrooms ($4.95) and chicken wontons ($2.95).  Note that if you like your cocktails sweet, do not get any of their strawberry drinks!  They are sour like Sour Patch Kids!  I am not really a beer person, I would rather save the calories for a pink girly mixed drink.  My favorite drinks here:  Cosmopolitan (nicely blended with a kick) and the seasonal Watermelon Mojito (you can really taste the watermelon, perfect drink if you're not looking to get too hammered).  This particular location has pretty good customer service, usually attentive and precise with orders."
Mike P.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,11,,1.0,3/18/2013,"Avoid BJ's Laguna Hills - Worst In The Chain! I've never seen a more poorly managed restaurant of this caliber.  The food is actually pretty good (we like the menu variety), but the service ranges from good to flat out horrific (in the gutter terrible), and there's no way to tell which service you're going to get on any given day.  Statistically, it's straight down the middle (50% good, 50% gutter service).  My wife and I came by for a meal after church one Sunday earlier this Month (March 2013), and it turned into one of those gutter service visits.  We had a young male waiter (I won't call him out here in public), who didn't have a clue what he was doing.  He took 10 minutes just to get us our drinks - but the worst part was that our pre-entree soup & salad (just one of each) took 30 minutes (I timed it, due to the inconsistent service we've experienced in the past).  At the 25 minute mark, I walked up to him (since he NEVER visited our table once after taking our order), to tell him that if the soup & salad didn't arrive in the next few minutes, we were simply going to leave.  He apologized and said he would check on it - 5 minutes later, he finally brought them to the table (at least the soup was hot and the salad was good).  He never visited our table after delivering the food - he didn't refill one of our drinks the entire time we were there.  When he finally presented the bill (there was no comp for the horrible service), we graciously left him a 10% tip, since we felt sorry for him, thinking he probably wouldn't have his job much longer. The real problem is the management - not one manager came by the entire time, and this ridiculously inconsistent service is an ongoing (several years) problem at this BJ's location.  I think we're cured of giving them more chances, but only time will tell. BJ's Management - are you listening? Does anyone in your organization have a clue?"
Kristen H.,"Lake Forest, CA",64,18,19,4.0,8/12/2011,"I've eaten here so many times in the past few months that it's time to write a review. I can't say I've sampled much off this menu because they have a great lunch special: a personal pizza & salad for $6! This is such a great deal, not only because it's cheap and enough to fill up my stomach, but because together this lunch special costs less than ordering the pizza by itself! How can you beat that? I guess they make up for the cheap special by charging $2.50 for an iced tea. REALLY? Come on... I know it's bottomless but isn't that a bit steep? I've started to order water instead.  Being from the Boston area I'm not typically a deep dish kinda girl, but the way the crust is cooked, crispy on the outside and really soft on the inside, definitely works for me. They don't over sauce the pizza, either. In fact, they usually add chunky tomatoes; although, I ask for them to remove those. I'm not a big fan of chunky tomatoes on my pizza. So my pizza is pepperoni with no chunky tomatoes, and this is one of the only places that I don't have to ask for extra cheese. The pepperoni is always in abundance and is usually cooked just right. Every once in a while the cheese tastes funny, or the pizza just doesn't look or taste right though. They have a few choices for salads: house salad, lettuce wedge, and Caesar. I order the regular house salad, bacon added, with the creamy garlic dressing. They charge extra for the bacon, even though it comes included with the lettuce wedge option, and I usually ask for no onions. Can't they just do a trade? :-D The creamy garlic dressing isn't overly garlic'y; although, I love garlic so really wouldn't mind. The lettuce is always fresh, as are the other ingredients that comprise your typical house salad. My only complaint here is that the added bacon isn't always cooked thoroughly. Considering it's an option for the lettuce wedge, you would think they would have cooked it ahead of time instead of it looking like an afterthought.  I would love to say that BJs is always consistent, but every once in a while something is a bit off, as described above. In general though, I don't hold it against them because most of the time they're spot on. And the price for the iced tea? Ridiculous.  In general, BJs delivers an inexpensive lunch that's enough to fill my belly that's usually very tasty. I'll definitely be back again and again."
Dave F.,"Laughlin, NV",3,63,1,3.0,8/1/2011,"I ate during lunch and ordered one of the lunch specials. The serving was kind of on the ""meager"" side. It had great flavor, it just left me hungry. The iced tea was mostly melted ice or just too much water. Contrary to other reviews I've read here, the service I got was decent, 4 out of 5 stars. What made the visit worth it was the dessert, absolutely awesome. BTW, the lunch special prices are very good but as I said, not very filling. Best feature: The atmosphere is really nice and the place is sparkling clean."
Tony H.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",0,13,1,1.0,1/8/2014,"Nice selection of beer, if that's what you want. I ordered a New York cut steak and it was the worst cut that I've had at any restaurant in recent memory. I ordered it cooked medium and it came very rare. Dark red meat, and barely even lukewarm. Also lots of hard rubbery fat, little to no seasoning, and basically uneatable. My wife told me to send it back, but I've seen those undercover shows and I see what they do to your food when you send it back, so I didn't. The carrots and broccoli were also barely warm and undercooked. The mashed potatoes were good. Our service was good, but my meal was the pits. My wife and daughter had no real complaints about their meals, but both said it was mediocre food at best. I drove through Taco Bell on the way home. I will not be going back."
Lisa B.,"Tustin, CA",5,32,1,2.0,1/16/2013,"One thing you can count on with this BJ's... horrible service.  Every single time, both in person and takeout.  As I write this, I've been on hold to order a pizza forever.  How busy could they be, it's a weeknight at 5:00?  I'm probably still going to order and I'm hungry, and if it's anything like last time, I'll get home with something other than I order.   :("
Sam R.,"Anaheim, CA",279,99,14,1.0,8/11/2010,"So I ordered 4 large deep dish pizzas to go for a get together. i decided on BJs at the request of my friends. they said they wanted the good stuff! the four pizzas ordered were as follows....  the Great white  BJs favorite (the works)  Vegetarian  Jalapeno and peperoni  long story short, if i did it again i would go with one of the traditional take out pizza establishments. the Great white was great! the jalapeno and peperoni was OK but the jalapenos were not hot. probably would have given BJs 2 1/2 stars if that was the end of order.  unfortunately it wasnt the end of the order. the veggie and the works had big chunky tomatoes that were too big and dirty. when i say dirty i mean that they did not taste right. usually I'm not that critical but i think that YELP is bringing the picky out of me that i did not know existed.  My previous BJ's experience have been good but today the Good Stuff just didnt cut it!!"
Ji-ji H.,"Fountain Valley, CA",1,5,,1.0,11/18/2012,"Worst service EVER!!!  We walked in and no one was at the front, even though there were 3-4 people at the table area right behind.  They saw us and didn't acknowledge us until 5 minutes later, not even asking us to wait a moment.   A man came to seat us in a deserted part of the restaurant and made a rude comment when he assumed my friend couldn't speak English when he heard her accent. When we were seated and our water was served, another guy came and tossed the paper napkins on the table.  We only came for dessert so our waiter, Josh, took our order.  Someone else served our plates.  My other friend said we would be sharing so he could just set them down in the middle.  He threw the plates loudly on the table and just left.   Josh came to give us our bill 2 minutes into our meal!  He says to take our time even though he was leaving the bill at our table.  But he tries to grab the bill the next time he passes our table!!  Of course there was nothing in there but the receipt because we weren't even halfway through our meal!!!   He came to fill ONE persons glass of water, each time only filling halfway because he didn't have enough water with him.   I've never had worse service than this ever, by every single person who 'accommodated' us.  Customer service???  A joke!!! Don't bother coming here.  Go to the BJs at the Tustin Marketplace."
Chris S.,"Anaheim, CA",12,13,,4.0,8/23/2013,"Service was great, beers r always great and  lunch special prices make it affordable, food was great as always but coleslaw was very bland, hope u r not a coleslaw fan like me, overall great place as always"
Brett A.,"San Clemente, CA",17,11,,4.0,12/9/2013,"My husband and I just moved down the street and really enjoy coming here; especially enjoy the call ahead feature. We ALWAYS get amazing service when we get Sarah (we are usually there on Friday nights) and she is great. We have a 9 month old and he loves her. She always has great suggestions, she is quick and always knows what we want...even before we do! We had another server (I think his name was Octavio) who was amazing as well. If you come during the day, it is well worth the wait to sit at the bar. Jill is quick, friendly and makes you feel like you are the only person there. Sometimes we do not get either one of them (night servers), and we have not had the best experience. Overall the staff is friendly, the food is good, and the drinks are strong. I would recommend BJ's for anyone who asks. The only reason I only give 4 stars, is the few servers we had that were not great."
Michelle M.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",631,943,154,2.0,10/18/2010,"I have a love, hate relationship with you dearest BJ's.  Came here over the weekend for a friend's birthday. The first words out of the server's mouth was ""oh shit, you can ask to talk to my manager anytime....."". Really?! Are you having THAT bad of a night or for some reason you seem to think you can't handle a table of 15. Sure, we're a large group, but we understand that it's hard to serve that large of a group, we'll cut you some slack.  It took her an hour to FINALLY take our food orders. Three of my friends never got their second round of drinks. Our food was served cool. She overcharged us by $45....there were some food items on the receipt that no one ordered, but mysteriously were on the bill. In the course of two hours, I witnessed three people fall on the slippery tile floor too. Really?! This can't be good for business or their workers. I think I'll stear clear from BJ's for awhile....major disappointment."
Julee F.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,25,3,2.0,12/22/2014,"Just seems like every time I decide to give BJ's another try, I am again disappointed.  Service and food took forever, then when we finally received it looked as if it was sitting in the pass window too long, cold and old! Looks as if they are cutting back on portions as well... Not worth the price, experience  not up to par! Boo... Won't be back, too many other places to go with better food and service."
Brian B.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,5,,4.0,12/21/2014,"Always excited to hit BJ's up for a birthday celebration, nothing better than the chocolate chip pazookie! It really comes down to location at times, Laguna Hills location always seems to the best over others! Worth it every time!"
Glenn J.,"Irvine, CA",7,13,4,3.0,3/10/2014,Great service. But just too commercial. Food is average or slightly above. Good for large groups and after work happy hours.
Archer A.,"Los Angeles, CA",41,97,19,1.0,10/21/2012,Sent back the jalopeno burger.. was like unseasoned slopped together dog meat covered in a layer or thick cheese.. quite discussing & very unlike the menu pictures.. won't be back.
Anonymous D.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",90,102,1,1.0,6/14/2010,"I love BJs pizza; it's thick, it's gooey and this sounds sexual so I'll stop.  But their service really pissed me off the other day. I called 20 mins ahead to order a pizza and a salad to-go. When I got there, I walked up to the pickup counter where the manager stood and had a 5 minute conversation with one of his employees, all the while, not glancing, not even thinking about looking at me. Way to run a joint! He must have graduated from the Michael Scott School of Mismanagement. Finally, another girl showed up after two employees of BJs, again one was the freaking manager, decided to speak to me. Then, she all distracted, passes me off to another guy that shows up. I tell him my name, all the while burning on the inside. I pay cash, take my change and he doesn't give me a receipt. Meanwhile, another customer shows up, a regular, and he receives a WARM WELCOME from the manager that ignored me for the first 5 minutes I was standing there. **Blood Pressure Rising, Fists Curling Up** So this guy, this customer, has an $80 order (to my piddily $23) and the manager tells the employees around him to take care of this guy and to help him get his food quick. The other employees kind of ignore him (funny) and continue processing the other checks they have. So finally, 5 minutes after I paid, 10 minutes after I showed up, I ask the guy that I paid if the food on the counter that I noticed has been sitting there since I mother-freaking arrived, is my food? He turns around, reads the receipts and hands me the food. WOW! Thanks for making me wait, letting my food get cold, disrespecting me and making sure that I never go to a BJs again. I hope someone from corporate reads this and gives that a-hole manager a spanking. Good luck with those soon-to-be in your future hair plugs. Sidenote: Some of this anger was not BJs fault. I awkwardly sat on my left testicle earlier in the day."
