Tim C.,"North Augusta, SC",19,5,,1.0,5/2/2013,Worst service EVER.... Me and my friend sent our steaks back THREE times.  We ordered mid-rare 1st time came out well and the next two times came our medium. After the third time the manager told use he would not make anymore steak so we could either get a pizza or leave.  NEVER AGAIN... I use to be a server and I have never seen anything like this!!!  If you want BJs don't come to this one.
David v.,"Long Beach, CA",139,517,36,3.0,7/15/2010,"If you had to classify the experience at BJ's, I think nothing captures it more than dining for families with 2 kids, the dog, and the white picket fence living in their safe commercialized suburb like OC. If you are still having trouble relating or understanding, its basically like your Chili's or TGI Fridays. The food is usually ranges from decent to good but nothing to really surprise you... other than the surprise of getting a dish that happens to be better than the Chili's or TGI Fridays version of it. I know what some people are going to say ""well they have there own selection of beer."" Kudos to them. I definitely appreciate them trying to distinguish themselves from the other corporate chains but in the end they are just another large cookie cutter corporation (NYSE: BJRI) offering the same tired stuff. However, we will definitely get to the beer in the review. We get seated and I order a beer... the stout to be exact. My first impressions of it is average. Nothing special. I drink a lot of beer (understatement of the century) from different countries and as far as stouts go is is average and in the grand scheme of beer, I would say its below average. I can see people from Midwest or people who only drink domestic beers liking it more than I did. We order our food: * Crispy Calamari - to be absolutely honest, this had to have been the better calamari I have had in a while. it still had a long way to go before even getting close to the best calamari, but it was pretty good * Spinach and Artichoke Dip - its spinach and artichoke dip... not much to say... its average. * BJ's Favorite Pizza - nothing outstanding it was about average. I have had better pizza else where. After a few more orders of drinks, I noticed the beer getting worse and worse tasting. I don't think it was the beers fault, but rather the beer wasn't cold enough and the glasses they came in weren't cold/chilled either. All beer must be sent out cold and in cold glasses according to the specific beer being served. It wasn't in this case and it actually made me sick to my stomach. I just stop drinking it. I am guessing the beer was cold but the glasses were hot from just being washed and it evened the temperature to almost room temperature. I had someone else try it and it wasn't just me. In the end, the food was average and the beer started out decent, but quickly went downhill from there. It's just about what you would expect from chain restaurant... average food, average service, and nothing to write home about."
Tamara C.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",1,40,,1.0,3/22/2014,"Let's just say from the most recent experience my friends and I had on March 3, 2014 I will not be going back. The food was way under par except for the pizza and the service was absolutely horrifying and embarrassing for an establishment as big as this one. Here's how it went down:  My boyfriend and a couple of our friends decided we would go to BJ's since we hadn't been there in a couple of years and wanted to enjoy ourselves after a stressful day.  It was a Monday night so we assumed it wouldn't be too busy.  We were seated right away which was a nice start to the evening.  Our waiter came to our table to get our drinks and we could barely understand him. This was not a good thing since he was our waiter, but were still optimistic that nothing would go awry.  My boyfriend ordered an alcoholic beverage and we got a round of water.  After 15 minutes my boyfriend still did not have his drink.  Apparently, we were sitting at a table labeled ""ignore us"" or something because every time we tried to flag a person down to help us they would just walk right on by without even making eye contact.  There was finally a waiter that attended to the drink situation and he brought it right away. This was rather frustrating and who should have to wait for a beverage for 15 minutes?  We were finally ready to order our food, but the waiter seemed to be MIA (missing in action).  He finally showed up and we placed our food order which was a mini sweet pig pizza, a burger with an added side salad. Once again we could barely understand him.  When he left I commented to the table that I thought things were going to go downhill from here on out and they all agreed.  We also felt like he was thrown on the floor from working int the back or something.  Our food took so long to get that we looked like we were going to gnaw each others arm off or something.  My friend's burger was okay, but the fries that came with it were atrocious (like many days cold and stale). We all commented that McDonald's fries were better.  The burger came with a side salad and it was the saddest sloppiest looking salad ever made. It seriously looked like it was dumped out of a packaged bag with the dressing was dripping off of the little cup it was in.  We all commented that Carl's Jr. made better salads.  The mini sweet pig pizza I ordered was the best thing ever!  It was made perfectly and tasted fabulous!  By this time we just had to get the manager regarding our experience so far.  That even took awhile to flag someone down to get the manager for us. The manager did attend to us and was super nice at first about our complaints.  We were quite frank with her and told her the service sucked, our waiter was MIA and the food was below par.  She offered pizookies on the house which we welcomed appreciatively. That even went awry. While waiting for our pizookies our waiter decided to appear and ask us how our meal was. My boyfriend made a snippy sarcastic comment that went something like, ""Oh! So nice of you to show up again after being MIA the whole night!  I felt it was necessary to add that we already spoke with the manager.  I mean who does this when our meal was already done?  That WAS NOT impressive at all.  The pizookies that came to our table were mini ones and were not the right ones we ordered.  Our waiter came to our table and said they knew about the mistake and the correct pizookies would be coming out shortly. The pizookies we got were tasty, but by this time we just wanted to leave. We finally got our check and there must have been a miscommunication with the manager because the side salad was not taken off like it should have been and it was not $2; it was $6.  What a nightmare! So we got the manager once again and reconciled this matter, but our manager turned from nice to snippy (kinda mean)  in two seconds flat and that new adjusted receipt came out so fast it was like magic after we waited such a long ass time for everything else.  We also did not feel our waiter deserved a tip so none was given.   Talk about a nightmare, an embarrassment and a true disappointment for an establishment like this.  I feel like the loudness of the restaurant, not enough training and short staff play factors in the horrifying service and mistakes that are made. I feel like good food and service should go hand in hand.  It's unfortunate that the service is that horrendous because the food is pretty good. For all the food lovers out there BEWARE and BE WARY of what you are walking into if you decide to dine here."
Brit D.,"Lake Forest, CA",1,3,,1.0,1/26/2015,"The manager won't EVER apologize for bad food!!!! We brought to her attention how much the portions have been getting smaller and smaller in the sour dough bowls. When you can't fit the of soup in the bread bowl corprite need to be informed. I wasent looking for a $4 discount on my $114 check I was expecting an IM sorry and I'll fix that right away. On previous attempts to eat this location Iv found dirty silverware,hair in my food and bad service. I always give chain restrants more then a few chances. I'm telling EVERYONE I know to spread the word to not to  give this location any business."
Nancy B.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,2,,1.0,2/25/2015,"My friend and I have been meeting at BJ's Restaurant for years and have noticed that over the last 2 years, the food and service have gone downhill. In the past, we always started with the Avocado Egg Rolls. They changed the recipe about a year or so ago so we stopped. I had a craving for them so we decided to give it another try. They were worse than the the last time. Very mushy inside with no flavor and didn't look anything like the picture.We also ordered the wings with extra hot sauce, celery, and bleu cheese instead of Ranch, the Italian Market Tavern-Cut pizza, and the Chipotle Fries. The wings came to us cold and the Italian pizza came without the meatballs. We brought this to the attention of our server who looked at it for a few moments searching for the meatballs. He then replied that our pizza accidentally went to the wrong table and he picked up this pizza.  I really don't like when the server lies to cover up for someone's mistake. He could have just acknowledged the error. He then brought the correct pizza which tasted okay. The Chipotle Fries were just unedible. My friend ate them because he was hungry but that's where I drew the line. We paid the bill and on the way out I spoke with the manager who really didn't seem to care. No apologies, sincere or otherwise. I am now looking for a new meet up restaurant who has higher standards than BJ's.  As a side note: I don't know if our experience only pertains to the Lake Forest location or if this is common to all their restaurants. I may try a different location if I am in the area."
Tina M.,"Corona, CA",35,146,2,4.0,8/13/2010,"BJ's is one of my favorite restaurants! :) I haven't gotten anything here that I haven't liked, but i'm one of those people who likes to get the same thing over and over again at restaurants because they're so good. BJ's also makes their own beers and they're pretty good.  Avocado Egg Rolls- I love avocados and this is a really good appetizer. The sauce they give you to pour on the egg rolls can be spicy if you don't have a very low tolerance, but it's still good. Grilled Chicken Potato- By far my favorite thing on the menu. I would say that at least 75% of the time I go to BJ's, I get this potato. I recently started asking for blackened chicken instead of grilled chicken and it made this so good. The only thing I don't like about this is that sometimes the skin of the baked potato is overcooked. The skin is the best part of the potato for you and I like it, just not when it's overcooked. BJ's Favorite Pizza- deep dish pizza that's basically a supreme pizza. I'm not huge on fancy pizzas with toppings that normally don't go on pizza. This is the only pizza I get here lol. Turkey Cobb Sandwich- I LOVE this sandwich. They give just the right amount of everything. I dislike sandwiches that have too much or something, like too much turkey or too much bacon, even though i'm sure others would disagree with that. If you like potato wedges, be sure to get wedge cut fries! And last but most certainly not least, a pizookie! A pizookie is a cookie that's fresh from the oven and topped with scoops of ice cream. My favorite is the chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream. Definitely a must try if you've never had one. Now while I absolutely love the food here, I'm only giving 4 stars because of the service. I usually come here during non-peak hours but service has usually been slow. Everytime I come between 9-11pm, it's always slow, but it's probably because it's so late. During peak hours, it's usually pretty good."
Laura T.,"San Diego, CA",25,15,2,5.0,9/2/2012,"Pizza, awesome. Pazooki, awesome. Our waiter, Colby, is the BEST!!! He remembered drinks from a week ago!"
Mark B.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",953,78,22,4.0,10/8/2012,"Gotta say that my waitress, I forgot her name.  But whatever.  She was the nicest ever.  Will definitely come back.  The Jeremiah Red beer was excellent.  Oh her name was Jacklyn!  Thanks!"
Melissa W.,"Cerritos, CA",27,134,,3.0,3/24/2011,"Sat in the bar area because the dining room had a wait. Server must have been busy because we kept having to ask other servers for things we needed like when we needed to order our food! Tried something new on the menu-ahi tuna salad. Big mistake. It was terrible and the tuna was not fresh at all. Others in my group had pasta, burgers, etc and everything else was fine."
Tanya F.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,15,,5.0,9/30/2011,"I have been eating at this BJ's for years although it wasn't the first BJ's that I ever had the pleasure of eating at. A friend introduced me to one down in San Diego, which was good-but kind of small and slow. Ever since then I have been eating at this one and have always enjoyed good service. Occasionally the food has taken a while to get to our table but it has never been unreasonable. On those occasions it was usually very busy and the staff still checked in with us to let us know when we should be expecting our food. The only time that it was really a problem, the manager came to our table and handled it very well. We ended up leaving with our whole meal compensated for (and a pizookie on the house!) Favorite thing here? The BBQ Beef Sandwich! The pizza is amazing but I've fallen in love with this sandwich and have never looked back. Also for you pizookie lovers: if you haven't tried the Oreo pizookie, you're really missing out (="
Stanley E.,"Newport Beach, CA",0,1,,4.0,12/28/2012,"An indicator of great customer service is how well the service provider handles an error or misstep.  In that respect, the BJs on El Toro is a shining example of how to treat a customer right when a mistake was made. For Christmas Eve 2012, we phoned in a rather large order early in the day for 5:00 pickup.  The plan was to eat a quick, early dinner so that we could get to the gift unwrapping for the eager kids in the family.  Unfortunately, when i arrived at BJs at 5:00, they had neglected to send the order back to the kitchen.  I would have to wait there while they cooked the order from scratch. The waiter manning the carryout station took responsibility for the problem and saw to it that the order was given top priority in the kitchen.  He also worked with the manager and got the entire order comped due to their mistake.  Unfortunately, in the rush to get home for the gift unwrapping I forgot to get the young man's name, but I want to thank him for his attentiveness. Although the restaurant did make a mistake, they certainly made it up to us.  We'll definitely return to this BJs and recommend it to others."
susan l.,"Rowland Heights, CA",264,750,1646,2.0,1/7/2011,"i wasnt wowed. but, am i expecting too much to be wowed by a BJs? only came here because it was convenient.  what i ate: - lunch special: 1/2 loaded chili baked potato + garden salad: this was pretty standard. exactly what i expected, and it was just right for the price. though, id probably never want to pay full price (dinner price) for either) - loaded veggie baked potato: i thought it was a LOADED VEGGIE baked potato and all we got was maybe 1/4 cup of veggies. it was mostly cheese and sauce. im not surprised that america is obese.  pros: - QUICK: we let our server know that we only had an hour for lunch, and the kitchen was awesome in sending our meal out within minutes! our meal actually came out before our server even had a chance to bring us our drinks. - lunch prices: the lunch menu has pretty good meals for cheap! i mean decent considering its a sit down restaurant.  - beer: i do like their beer! esp their hef and red.  - willing to fix the problem: when we commented on the lack of veggies on our loaded veggie baked potato, she did bring out a bowl of veggies cons: - busy: we went during lunch and it was PACKED and busy! we sat at the bar and our server was no where to be found. difficult to flag her down for anything, but i dont think it was on purpose.  would i come again? probably not."
Laura M.,"Waco, TX",17,11,9,3.0,6/27/2013,"The food is pretty standard for a chain bar and grill style place, and the price is a little more than Applebee's or chili's. Their desserts are amazing, but placing an order by phone for pick up is THE. WORST. They start every sentence by trying to sell you on appetizers and finish by trying to get you to buy drinks or desert. Super annoying. I know it's probably the rules from corporate but they need to stop and just let people order what they planned on ordering when they called in"
Chuck H.,"Mission Viejo, CA",2,35,4,2.0,6/23/2013,Good food nice atmosphere but would come back. Pizza over priced and salad quantity is too small for the price
Aurora P.,"Washington, DC",70,99,,3.0,4/4/2010,"I wish I could give different number of stars for different foods. I like BJS, but I don't love it. Here's why.... I think that their food is mediocre, it's always a hit or miss for me. I either order the right thing, or I end up hating what I ordered and eating off of a neighbors plate. I LOVE Santa Fe salads, but BJs salad was a no go for me (compared to Cheesecake Factory's salads). However! (yes there is a however). The chicken AND pork mini sliders are delicious along with the wedge cut and skinny fries. So, I'd give their food a three. Now! For the Pazookie!! I'd give that  five + stars! We got the party platter with the chocolate chip and oreo flavors. With scoops of ice cream on top.....taste like a sweet swirl of deliciousness in your mouth. I've been to plenty of BJS before, so as for the service at this particular BJS, I would say it was fairly good. The waiter joked with us, was nice, and brought our food out fast. Parking seems like a hassle though, since I noticed there were alot of people."
Todd V.,"San Diego, CA",37,31,15,3.0,8/30/2014,"Tried the location in Laguna Hills off El Toro road when I was in the area for work. Came at 12:15 at the peak of lunch hour busyness. The lunch specials were very reasonably priced and offered many different items including sandwiches, soups salads and pizzas. They even had a lower calorie/fat menu for lunch. I chose the half a pizza and salad. The pizza was a bacon and tomato with a healthier white sauce for under 500 calories. Food was pretty good, not knock-your-socks-off good but worth the price. Here was my issue, service was horrible. After we were seated, we were asked what we wanted to drink almost immediately. Our drinks came fairly quickly and then we didn't see our server for 10 minutes. After she returned to take our order we didn't see her again for at least another 15 minutes. In this time another server brought us our food and refilled our drinks but only after we flagged her down looking for our server. I was glad she helped but if we didn't flag her down we would have waited while our food got cold and had nothing to sip on. When our server came back we asked for ranch and crushed red pepper. She brought back ranch and no crushed red pepper and proceeded to ask ""if were good"". At this point I gave up because our food was already half done and cold waiting for our simple items. I understand servers have to take breaks and such but in the peak of lunch service when you know people have to go back to work this should never be happening. Maybe if I am around another BJ's I may end up trying it again for lunch because the food is pretty good and I'm sure the service can't be like this everywhere."
Gwynnie P.,"San Francisco, CA",735,992,75,3.0,2/16/2008,3 stars not because I like this place but the in-laws from nearby Laguna Woods Village (the village formerly known as Leisure World) picked it and they think the food is terrific.  On a Saturday night we arrived at 7pm and waited 45 mins. for a table. They don't take reservations. You get those pager thingies. No good ever comes of that. The Pale Ale is passable. The deep dish pizza is an abomination of wonder bread with toppings. I had a wedge salad and that was just fine. After sitting in a car for 8 hours you need re-hydration and eating half a head of iceberg is a good way to get it. Note: The BJ's team has ambitious plans to expand across the U.S. in the coming years. They look forward to opening a BJ's in your hometown! (Don't say I didn't warn you)
Tiger C.,"Orange County, CA",169,216,341,3.0,3/2/2013,Enjoy the location and end up eating here with good friends no and again.  Not really impressed with the value in terms of food quality - but it is decent - some things they do well - order simple items - soups are good.
Fred F.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",7,2,,1.0,8/5/2013,"Birthday disappointment!  My family chose to take me to BJ's to celebrate my birthday.  It seemed to take a long time for the food to arrive.  When it did my wife's and son's meals were too cool, they brought me a pizza that was different from the one that I ordered and the forgot to make my daughters meal.  The waiter did what he could for damage control, but I wasn't too cooperative.    I did not feel like waiting another half hour for them to make another pizza.  After my daughter's meal came we finished up and left.  What I expected with this degree of multiple screw-ups in one family's order was for the manager to come over to acknowledge the matter.   Never saw anyone from management.  Like I said the poor waiter did what he could, but BJ's fell short.  Should be zero stars."
