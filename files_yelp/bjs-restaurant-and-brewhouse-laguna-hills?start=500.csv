Larry B.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,6,,2.0,12/4/2014,Short version - the pizza was tasteless. Don't bother going here...
Michelle Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",350,575,17,4.0,12/13/2010,Yum! I used to live in Chicago and I miss their deep dish. Bjs makes a delicious comparable version. Cheese and tomato is the best. Plain simple and tasty! Whatever we order we are never disappointed! I love their veggie burger and now they have a wheat bun! The wedge cut fries are out of this world! The spicy tomato spaghetti is just that! It's mouth searing spicy but it burns only in the best of ways! The portions are enormous and every bite is tasty! Also they brew their own root beer! It's very good but you definitely have to have a sweet tooth. My dad absolutely loves the Jeremiah red and can basically finish a pitcher along with a pizza and be a very happy & well fed man!
Jeff W.,"Laguna Beach, CA",0,6,,2.0,10/17/2013,"Just had dinner here last night. Since we were in a hurry did not send back food . But, ordered a California Grilled Chicken Sandwich with wedge cut fries. Received a Parmesan chicken sandwich with cold fries. On a positive note, the server noticed the error on the sandwich and changed the bill without my having to complain."
John C.,"Laguna Woods, CA",1,58,1,3.0,1/25/2013,Ate here last night with 3 of my big drinking friends! The beers are good variety and I had one. Too bad I like fitness. I had deep dish pizza which was good. Actually pretty good for a chain. The food and service were both good. The problem is that the service and food should be good. I am sorry for only 3 stars but maybee 31/2 would be better. I can quite give it 4.
Ervin D.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",152,101,20,4.0,3/8/2010,"Ah yes, another one of my happy haunts when looking for a good Happy Hour to crash.  So the first review is for the happy hour. Great beers that are house brewed for $4 dollars during happy hour, which is what I would expect.  Their sampler is a GREAT way to try all the different brews, but here's some advice, the servers here are usually cool with letting you sample a beer before you decide to down a full pint, they have always hooked it up, and are happy to just chat beer with you too.   The Jeremiah red is a favorite of mine.  Red, malty, sweet, rich with a full body, and a clean and lingering sweet then bitter after bite, this is what I always go for, unless they have Octoberfest, which is seasonal. All of their house brews are great, and give you a good variety.  I don't really recommend the Berry Burst cider, unless you decide to float Guinness on top, but maybe that's just me.  They also brew their own rootbeer, something great to share with the kids. Happy hour menu consists of $2 off all apps, 1/2 priced personal pizzas, which are AMAZING, and sliders, which I also recommend.  I had pulled pork sliders, came with 3 and fries, and filled me up.  So on to the food - I really enjoy their pizzas; very filling, full of flavor, and a great way to spend time with the family.  I took my family here one time, and lemme tell you, they were in for a treat.  not because this place is AMAZING, but because their Asian mom's and aunts that really don't go out to eat food that is not native to their continent, or heck, their country. We shared a half Great White and half Spinach Artichoke.  Both have really creamy and flavorful white sauces, the Great white with nicely blackened chicken, garlic, and corn, the Spinach Artichoke was rich, creamy, full of tomatoes and artichoke hearts. I love all of their pizzas, and that is why I come.  They have other ""decent"" food, but it's just the typical burgers and sandwiches. Dessert, you cannot go wrong with a pizookie.  Nice and crisp edges, with a soft, decadent center, gooey and topped with vanilla bean ice cream.  I enjoy all the flavors, choco chip, white choco macademia, oatmeal raison, and double chocolate. one piece of advice though, avoid dinner times during the weekends, because it can be a little wait.  Amazing thing is, last time we were waiting, approx 30 minutes, the brought out mini slices of pizza for everyone, which was a nice little gesture."
Jonathan I.,"Frisco, TX",52,32,39,3.0,11/11/2012,The food here is very good with a broad selection. I had the grilled fish tacos from the lunch menu which comes with a smooth avocado spread on the as well as chips and salsa. The two tacos were just the right size for lunch.  They have a fine selection of proprietary microbrews.  I would have given 4 stars were it not for the painfully slow service. It was not our server's fault though and the manager took 25% off our bill without asking
Loraine J.,"Orange County, CA",1,22,2,3.0,9/21/2011,"The wait is a tad long for my liking, but what can you expect when it's always so busy? The food is good. Not spectacular or out of this world or anything, but it's tasty. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive and came back about 7 or 8 times just to make sure everything was okay at our table, which I'll admit was slightly irritating. Customer service is important to me, but actually getting to eat my food with out interruptions is also important. Oh and if you're looking for a really yummy appetizer, I would go with the ahi poke. The avocado eggrolls (which are their most popular appetizer, according to our waitress) are good too, but they're a little too bland for me."
Paul P.,"Laguna Hills, CA",1,4,3,2.0,9/11/2013,"Sat down at a table, waited 15min nobody came. My date decides to ask the hostess for help then miraculously someone came to the rescue. The waiter in this section passed by us 6 times and didn't bother to say shit to us. I love this place but seriously that was sad."
Russell M.,"Lake Forest, CA",5,15,,2.0,7/4/2012,"The beer here is amazing, I love the options and flavor profiles of all of them.  That being said, I can't really say much else positive about this place.  It used to be much better, better food, better service, and better ambiance.  Now of days though it is just slightly below average.  The last few times that I have been here it's been fairly bad, but tonight it was so bad that I decided to write a review.   When we walked in, we were greeted promptly and taken to a really small table for 2 adults and a toddler.   Our waiter came over about 6 minutes later and walked us through a rehearsed spiel that sounded very robotic.  We ordered soup and drinks and said we needed a minute more to select our entrees and off he went.  He came back about 5 minutes later with the drinks and we gave our order.  About another 6 minutes passed and we got our cold soup (presented beautifully by the way).  I swear to god my chicken tortilla soup had 2 pieces of chicken in it for $6.   Our food came out about 10 minutes later - My wife's and mine that is, they forgot the food for my son.   I had to ask them where it was, and it was blatantly obvious they forgot.  When they brought it they STILL didn't bring his drink, and even when I got his drink they STILL didn't give me the water I ordered 3 times.   To wrap this up my food was sub-par, pasta was almost crunchy raw and again for $14 I expected a little more than 5 ounces of chicken.  T finish up the meal we ordered 2 pizookies and got 1 and the check, odd.  Just in case you are thinking it was slammed, we got there at 4:45pm.  I'll go back to drink their delicious beer but I do not think that I will be dining at BJ's again."
Jonathan Z.,"Cypress, CA",595,1179,1175,4.0,9/8/2008,"BJ's pizza.  Oh the grease comes right off the deep dish slices of heaven.  They have a greasy crunch outside and soft tasty inside.  That's a good pizza.   You must try BJ's root beer.  I don't know what flavors they put in it, but it's delicious.  Warning:  the waiter/waitress might forget to tell you it's non-refillable, so don't order 5 of them and then wonder why it cost so much. Another mentionable is their pizookie.  I prefer to make my own at home, but theirs is still good."
James B.,"Lake Forest, CA",0,4,,3.0,8/24/2013,Don't order the grilled steak salad. The greens were good but the fat and gristle were not trimmed off the steak.  This left 2 options: eat and swallow the fat & gristle or cut it off and plant it on a corner of the plate.
Louise Y.,"Sacramento, CA",15,44,8,2.0,7/15/2014,"The Cobb salad was listed on the menu with apple-smoked bacon but we had to ask for it. We sat on the patio and the couch/benches were filthy. The Double Deluxe turkey was delicious. We were seated right away but the service was slow. We asked for a refill on water but it never came. They also advertised a brand new green tea, ice tea but when we ordered it they were out. All in all it was not worth the money we spent."
Sean W.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",117,205,10,3.0,12/21/2009,"Enjoying a meal at this BJ's is all dependent on choosing wisely off of the wildly inconsistent menu.  (For some reason, I have found different BJ's locations to vary quite a bit in terms of food quality and experience.)  The chicken strips and buffalo chicken wings- great The pizza's- inconsistent, looks better than it tastes The sandwiches- I loved the California chicken sandwich, but the sourdough burger was awful.   The pazzokies- hell yeah. At least their is plenty of good beer flowing to help ease the pain if you order one of the many misses on the menu..."
Robert P.,"San Mateo, CA",85,92,39,3.0,11/23/2009,"Firstly I'll start off by saying that this place is probably in my book more of a 3.5 leaning more toward a 4.0 just like the average dictates. Sadly tonight though, I'm going to give it an initial 3.0 from my part. I had been here a few times and the food is always great and just like tonight the pizza does not disappoint. It reminds me of a pizza chain that existed in the 80's called Numero Uno Pizza. I used to go to Numero Uno as a teen with my family and the pizza was great. Nice thick buttery dough with high quality ingredients. BJ's is much like that, great tasting rich dough with fresh ingredients. For a Monday the place was not all that busy but the service was pretty slow, even for me. We don't ask for much and we actually enjoy not being asked every 5 mins if everything is o.k. but there was definitely a delay between visits. All in all though it's a good place for a reasonable meal. It was just an off night, I might upgrade the review at a later time."
Franky S.,"San Juan Capistrano, CA",17,13,,4.0,2/4/2013,"Avg. wait is 15min to get seated on a Saturday night. They have a bar if u have no patients. Food was at avg. priced . I order some boneless buffalo sauce chicken wings for an appetizer ,and some pieces were so small . So then I order a sirloin steak with a side of Caesars salad n mashed  potatoes . The salad was pretty good and so was the Mashed potatoes. The steak was alright didn't give me the OMG! Factor. The service was great , I kid you not that every time I ask the waitress for something she came right back n placed it on my table without me noticing. She was like a ninja. Oh n u must have the pazooki as a dessert  they're the bomb."
Shannon T.,"Murrieta, CA",28,12,,4.0,3/24/2012,Had a great time at this restaurant! I ordered a turkey burger which and 2 off the brewed brewers. Staff was friendly and attentive
Savannah B.,"Brooklyn, NY",26,4,,1.0,2/28/2013,"If I could give this place negative stars, I would. While the food and atmosphere are not bad at all, the customer service is HORRENDOUS!! TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE #1 -  I've heard stories from a ton of my friends about how bad the service at this BJ's is, but I figured they were exaggerating.  I went to BJ's with a group of about 6 people after a rehearsal one night (probably around 10pm). The moment we walked in, the hosts were totally unprofessional and didn't seem to have any idea what they were doing. Seeing as I have worked in the restaurant business for the past 4 years, I usually have a lot of patience with restaurant workers, especially when they're busy, because I know how hard it can get. But it was not busy at all, and yet it took them 30 minutes to seat our ""large party"" of 6 people. Really?!  Once we were seated (and starving!!) it was probably another 10 minutes before we were finally greeted by a server. A server, mind you, who was the most terrible server I have ever had IN MY LIFE (And I've been to Europe!! lol). This girl was rude the moment she walked up to the table, rolling her eyes when we asked for waters, and very short with us. She didn't repeat our order back to us (which probably explains why she screwed it all up), and was just totally unpleasant. When our food finally did come out, pretty much every order was wrong in some way and one person in our group didn't get served any food at all. She didn't return to our table for another 15 minutes (even though we'd asked for refills after she dropped off our food) and when she finally did return, my friend let her know he didn't get his food (we all just ate our incorrect orders because we were so starving we stopped caring). Instead of doing the right thing any good server would do, apologize and fix the problem right away, this woman literally rolled her eyes at us and said ""ok, I'll buy your pizza then"" before walking away. I'm NOT KIDDING!!!!  Another 15 minutes later, she returned with my friend's pizza (the rest of us were done eating by now) and we reminded her for the 3rd time, that we wanted water refills. This girl literally turned around, grabbed a pitcher of water from another server, and SLAMMED it down on our table!!! (I'm not kidding, I though the glass was going to break) I was STUNNED. I don't care how busy you are or how bad your day was, there is NO EXCUSE for a server to behave so poorly. If she really hated her job so much, she should consider quitting. I left her no tip, but then wrote a paragraph on the back of the check (no joke) entitled ""TIPS on serving"" and made a list of everything she did wrong. I didn't want her to think we were just a group of teens who never tip, when I go out with my friends, I ALWAYS make sure a minimum of 20% is left for the server. This was the only scenario in which I left the server nothing. TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE #2 -  OK, so now a few months have passed and I decided to give this BJ's another chance. This time, we were a much larger group (probably 10-12), it was late, after another rehearsal, on a Friday night. Hosts were, once again, terrible, but I was trying to stay positive and told myself they were probably new. Took a while to get seated, but since it was a busy night and we were a larger group, I wasn't bothered by it. When we finally got seated it -- once again -- took a good 15 minutes for our server to help us.  As soon as he approached the table, I let him know that my boyfriend and I were only getting an appetizer because we wanted to leave early (as an experienced server I can tell you that we prefer you tell us AHEAD of time if you want separate checks). I was doing this guy a favor by letting him know before he even took our order. This server was seriously (and I didn't think it possible) ruder than the female server I had dealt with our previous visit! He seriously had the worst attitude, and refused to split the check in any way shape or form. I told him, and I quote, ""How about you pretend me and my boyfriend are sitting at a separate table and are in no way affiliated with this group?"" He gave me a serious attitude and said ""company policy"" said they couldn't split checks (which is called bulls---, this server was just lazy and didn't want to deal with the hassle of splitting checks). After he stormed off, the whole table was so angry we actually just got up and left as he was bringing all of our drinks out. We went to In-N-Out across the street for better food, service, prices, and atmosphere (I'm serious) In conclusion - DON'T GO HERE. The service is so bad it's comical. I actual went back a few weeks ago just to see if any efforts have been made to improve service. The answer is no, it's still terrible. I blame management for obviously training their servers poorly."
Nate H.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",26,40,5,3.0,2/28/2012,"Generally I'm pretty happy with this place. The food is consistently good, as well as the service, usually. This time a group of 10 of us came in and were greeted by a very nice host. We then wandered into the bar and found a table where we were less than ""greeted"" by a very annoyed looking waitress. How dare we enter at 930 pm on a Sunday and sit in her section to celebrate my friends birthday! I'm a waiter myself and I understand that you may not always want to take a table later at night, but at least try and make me believe that you are half way excited that we are spending money and you will get the tip in the end. We try to make a joke or two to lighten the mood; no dice. At least the food runner had a smile on his face when he delivered the food, always a nice touch. Food tasted very good, as usual. had to try the hand crafted root beer this time. I'm not normally a soda drinker, but it was noticeably better than root beer from a soda tap, but falls short of A&W root beer at their restaurants. I think I'll just stick to their regular beer instead. The tatonka stout is a perfect complement to the pizookie at the end of the night. I usually feel 4-4.5 stars but this time felt more like 2.5 because of the service. It was just a one time flaw, next time I think will be nicer."
Kim N.,"South Bay, CA",2945,9796,55587,4.0,8/22/2006,"Another one of those suburban family oriented chains that  knows their target audience. I have no issues with these types of restaurants as long as the food is solid and it's executed well.  BJ's is definitely one of those businesses. Came here on a Friday night with some friends that are somewhat picky eaters and they suggested it since there is basically something for everyone (a near vegan, carnivore, and omnivore). The wait was an expected 30 min, but since this is a full bar and brewpub it was easy to grab some drinks, converse, and catch up, since we hadn't seen each other in a while. Of the locations I've been to, it seems each one is architecturally unique, although the major construction elements are similar across the locations. Lots, of brick, wood, glass and metal adorn the very industrial pub design.  Menus are quite large, spanning pizza, pasta, seafood, sandwiches, steaks, and are pretty much consistent across the locales. Since I have a BJ's near where I live I had already settled on my Roast Beef French Dip Sandwich and Fries that I normally get. My friends had a Cheeseless Veggies Pizza w Extra Sauce and the Fish and Chips. Everything was pretty tasty and the portions though not enormous were  definitely above average. Service was friendly and definitely bustling since the amount of people they drive through an hour is pretty high.  Solid eats and brews, good for groups, and definitely good people watching (this is a Laguna after all)."
E P.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",42,22,,5.0,7/24/2014,I've been to the Laguna Hills location a few times and each time the food has been awesome as well as the service! We went last night and Luis was our server and he was great! I will definitely be back for sure!
