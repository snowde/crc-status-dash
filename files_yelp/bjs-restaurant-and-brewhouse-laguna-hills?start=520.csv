Monique M.,"Mission Viejo, CA",7,7,,2.0,2/2/2014,"Service is not very good, especially when I come with a big group. Food is ok."
Isabel S.,"Costa Mesa, CA",79,502,174,4.0,3/9/2010,Avocado egg rolls. Hard Cider. Pazookie. That's all you need to know folks!
Maria T.,"Santa Monica, CA",690,482,12,3.0,8/1/2009,"I'm sure the service and food, is, well, typical of the hundred of BJ's out there... but in good conscience, I must warn you of one thing: THEY HAVE THE MOST SLIPPERY, DANGEROUS, UNFRIENDLY FLOORS, EVER. I nearly crashed and burned, not once, but twice because of how slippery the floors are.  At first I thought it was just me in my pumps, but then I found out everyone in my group, including men in rubber flip flops--were slipping on the floors and having near-death experiences. This is a total lawsuit waiting to happen!  I don't know who the genius was that decided that slippery black tile would be good in a restaurant where spills happen regularly, but if I could give out a 'bonehead' award, it would be to that guy.  I really hope they fix it, because good pizza tastes best when served without a concussion."
James H.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",2,13,5,4.0,1/8/2011,"I continue to remain loyal to all the BJ's because they do two things very well.   Great pizza - love the deep dish BJ's supreme.   Great beer - I don't drink a lot of beer but when I have a couple I want them to have some substance - not watered down like some big brand beers.  In particular their Jeremiah Red is simply fantastic.  You can have just a couple of Jeremiah Reds and life is good.  Not too filling and has really good flavor. There service has dropped off over the past year, not certain why, but when brought to their attention the manager immediately made good on the bad experience as hence I remain a loyal fan. Great place and good people."
Chelsey S.,"Long Beach, CA",3,12,,3.0,9/2/2010,"The only reason this I give this place three stars is because of their pizza. The pizza here is the only reason I bother to return. (Can't go wrong with the barbecue chicken, if you're into that.) The other menu items I've tried have always been alright, but nothing to write home about. Maybe I need to indulge in some of that bruschetta all these other Yelpers are talking about... Anyway, my personal advice is to throw any diet plans to the wind, turn straight to the pizza page of the menu, and order away. You won't be dissapointed.  What you will be dissapointed with (most likely) is the service. Granted, I have only ever visited this place on Friday or weekend nights, but the service is ridiculously SLOW. You should only plan on seeing your waiter once every 20 to 30 minutes, so if you want a second drink with your dinner... plan ahead."
Elle P.,"Orange County, CA",15,31,6,3.0,12/13/2009,"A-OKAY. That's the perfect word to describe this place. This place is located right next to the Laguna Hills mall, facing the street, so it is very convenient and easy to find. Like everyone said, this place is HUGE! Impressive, but it also SUCKS at the same time. Why? Because our waiter was MIA for almost the whole night.. Lame. He was waiting on too many tables for his own good. He also made a noticeable amount of mistakes: got my order wrong, my drink was empty for 20 minutes because he never came to check on us, OH and when he did come back to refill my Sprite, he poured ice water.. :( Fail. Up side? They have so many things on their menu to choose from. And the food we ordered was pretty good. It also came in a pretty good amount of time. Also, the server APOLOGIZED (sincerely!) and comped a bunch of the stuff off our bill. So, that was nice. I'm actually a huge fan of BJ's and their infamous PIZOKIES! I'm usually very impressed with them, but this certain one was just not up-to-par."
Brittany T.,"Mission Viejo, CA",114,4,20,4.0,8/30/2011,"I am a server at Bjs (soon to be ex-server). I will be perfectly honest about Bjs. It's a great atmosphere, and quality food for a great price. But I think that some of the guest go in there with expectations a little too high. Bjs is one of the more busier restaurants out there. So when you do visit. Expect a wait and expect a noisy atmosphere. Service may be a little slow at times. But the servers have two hand just like everyone else and MOST servers try their absolute best to accommodate every guests needs. Sometimes its just TOO busy. Bjs tries to exude the ""fine dining"" experience, but when it comes down to it..we serve pizza a beer. So if your looking for a casual laid back dining experience. Than Bjs is for you, but if not I suggest you find somewhere else."
S P.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",106,33,2,2.0,12/16/2013,"Good appetizers.  However, I'm pretty convinced now that wait staff has stolen my credit card info on more than one occasion."
Kitten D.,"Lake Forest, CA",8,10,3,1.0,12/3/2012,"Horrible service and worse food.  Both used to be great at this location but now the food is awful, service is excrutiatingly slow and the manager is rude.  Wll never go back."
Jen B.,"Newport Beach, CA",221,604,19,3.0,2/18/2010,"I've been to Chicago and eaten the real deal.  I honestly don't see how BJ's can call themselves Chicago style pizza!  They're nothing alike!!!!  With that being said, I LOVED their avocado/cream cheese/sun-dried tomato fried egg rolls with a tamarind dipping sauce.  Soooo addicting.  Their pizzookie is also really yummy.  I would return just to eat those and skip the horrible pizza!"
Alex H.,"Huntington Beach, CA",29,50,76,2.0,7/17/2011,"I wish there were different stars for different categories: Food: 5/5 stars... Food is always awesome here Service: 0/5!!!!!  BJ's food is always great. However, I recently had a horrible experience there. My grandfather's food was accidentally sent to the wrong table. So while the rest of us ate, he didn't. The manager did come out and apologize, gave him a free cup of soup etc etc. That's not even the bad part. After our meal, I took my grandmother to the restroom. I had to push her on her walker since she is blind and can't walk well. Our table was on the patio so I had to go back into the restaurant. Not ONCE did an employee offer to open the door for me (both the patio door or the restroom door). On our way to the bathroom, employees kept walking right in front of me, no ""excuse me,"" ""pardon me,"" etc. So unbelievably rude!!! I was appalled. Later when I called to make a complaint because I was so upset and the manager was unavailable so I left my contact info. I have yet to receive a call back and it's been over 3 weeks. Just adding salt to the wound, that's all I'm saying."
Suzanne K.,"Laguna Beach, CA",1,10,,1.0,8/10/2012,"DO NOT GO TO THIS RESTAURANT!!!  I Ordered the chicken quesadilla .  After waiting 40 minutes for our food I opened the quesadilla and there wasn't even any chicken in two of the four pieces!!!!!!        The ones with the chicken  were so skimpy it wouldn't even equal 2 oz of chicken.     This is the third time I have given them a chance to get it right!  Every time the wait is a least 30-40 minutes and then the food is either cold, poorly made or both!  Then the wait staff screws up your bill!  Be careful if you pay cash!! Go to Woody's or Kings at least you get what you pay for!"
Andi C.,"Long Beach, CA",1,19,,1.0,3/29/2014,I called for delivery at 8pm.  The driver said he cashed out and was done working.  Saturday night at 8pm?? I'm so done with this BJs!!!
Erin C.,"Temecula, CA",68,334,26,3.0,2/8/2010,"BJ's is a fun place to come with friends, but I think the prices are a little high for the quality of food you get. I love the house beers, especially the Jeremiah Red! And of course, the pazookie is a must have whenever you visit.  You could definitely do worse than BJ's, but it's not the end all be all."
Jameson J.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",74,30,10,5.0,3/16/2013,Love this place. Best potato skins in OC. Buffalo wing pizza is bangin boy! I will return again again!
Tulsa C.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",7,17,2,3.0,7/14/2011,"I love BJs food, but ALL the male servers are COMPLETELY INCOMPETENT and about 30% of the female servers.  Ask for Cheyenne (Cheyanne?) or her sister for top of the line service."
Lynn U.,"San Juan Capistrano, CA",0,1,,5.0,6/26/2014,"We hosted a party for 25 at the BJ's in Laguna Hills.  The service was outstanding  through to the last pizookie AND the food was delicious. Our table was ready before our reservation which was a pleasant surprise for early arrivers.  The wait staff quickly brought out drinks and appetizers which pleased our hungry guests.  Peter, the manager, was amazing to work with while planning this event and he personally checked in to make sure all was well.  All our guests enjoyed themselves and we couldn't have been more pleased and grateful for such a wonderful and seamless dinner and evening."
Ken L.,"San Francisco, CA",88,407,28,4.0,12/30/2011,"I come with the parental units when I'm visiting town. It's the best of the BJ's I've had, uh, visited. They really know how to blow your mind! With pizza. And tazaki, suzaki, pizaki??? You know, the ice cream and cookie thing that can't be called an ""Ice Cream and Cookie Thing."""
Amber H.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",0,6,,5.0,11/9/2011,"This is hands down the BEST place for a gluten free pizza!  We go every few weeks and we've never had a bad meal.  Yes, sometimes there is a wait but once we are seated the service is always fast and excellent.  It isn't the cheapest place for us to go since my husband orders a regular pizza and I order a gluten free pizza, but it's so good that I could care less.  The gluten free cookie is also delicious!  I'm currently pregnant so I haven't been able to indulge in a gluten free beer with my pizza just yet, but I am very much looking forward to that moment.   I don't know of any other place where someone who is gluten free can go to enjoy such a delicious gluten free pizza and beer with friends.  Thank you BJs for being at the forefront!"
Kurtis P.,"Fountain Valley, CA",51,114,3,4.0,1/5/2012,Came in here on a lunch break.  I had the ham and cheese sandwich with the tomato soup and it was amazing!!  They cut the sandwich into strips so you can dip it into the soup.  Awesome!  So tasty!  I highly recommend it!
