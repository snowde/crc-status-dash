Patrick M.,"Mission Viejo, CA",16,15,10,3.0,6/28/2012,"This BJ's gets 3 stars solely because of the pizza and beer. If you like deep-dish pizza and microbrews, it's a good place to eat with friends. However, the service is usually poor (with the occasional exception). I almost always order the same thing: mediterranean pizza with no chicken and feta on the side. I'm pleasantly surprised when they get it right, since it usually either has the toppings I didn't want and/or is missing the ones I did want. One time, they screwed up my order twice in a row. And, since it's so busy, the waiters always seem frantic or impatient."
Amy Z.,"Irvine, CA",15,19,8,1.0,2/4/2014,"My boyfriend and I went to BJs for the first time on a Friday night after work. The place was packed and there was quite a long wait. The atmosphere was great and we we super hungry and excited to have a nice dinner. We put in our names and waited patiently. After waiting about 20 minutes, a nice couple sitting in the bar area (free seating) flagged us over and asked us if we would like to take their booth because they were getting ready to leave. We gladly took the seat and handed our ""buzzer"" to someone else who had been waiting for a long time. We then sat in the booth for about another 15-20 minutes and watched out waiter completely ignore us. As he stopped in our area only a couple times to collect checks from a few other customers, nobody came to greet us, give us a menu, a glass of water....nothing. The seating in the bar area was pretty well ignored by him in general. All the while, the couple to whom we gave our own buzzer was now seated and enjoying their service. Very hungry and a little irritated at this point, my boyfriend walked up to the host's table, explained the situation, and if we could be placed in front of the line to be re-placed into the normal seating area. The host told him that, if we wanted, she would say something to our waiter about it but we would have to wait again if we wanted to be re-seated. To that, we just decided to leave and go somewhere where we felt our business was valued. I can't speak to the quality of food at this restaurant, I can only say how extremely disappointed and disrespected we felt when we tried to experience BJs for the first time."
Patricia F.,"Mission Viejo, CA",6,500,16,4.0,1/12/2014,"Great music to go with the great house brews... Radiohead, Metric... I approve! Their house blonde is great. It was busy on a Sunday afternoon but service was still fast. I like their pizza but also love that they have a lot of healthy options on the menu. I frequently get the baked Mahi-Mahi and it is excellent every time. Tried several of their house brews and liked them all."
Amir A.,"Orange County, CA",193,44,29,3.0,9/22/2012,We were there with a group of friends on a Friday night. The food was OK and the service was slow and inappropriate.
Nancy E.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",1,14,,1.0,5/8/2015,I am writing this purely based on the service. I have never felt so rushed to get out of a restaurant. Our server Salina was so aggressive and was basically going up to her tables kicking them out as soon as it became midnight. My boyfriend and I arrived at 11:15. Our server took about 15min to bring us our water. My bf and I got salads to start and told our server we would order more after we decided. The food was great but at 11:45pm after our server being MIA she comes up and says the kitchen is closing and it's last call for food. I totally understand I work in a restaurant too. So my bf and I ordered a medium pizza. Salina told us that two mini pizzas were the same as a medium. So we got two minis and ordered a pizookie for after our pizza. Our pizookie came out before our pizzas. We asked if they could just keep it in the kitchen for a few minutes until the pizzas came. Salina told us no cause it's last call even though other tables were still ordering food around us. It was so rude. We got our pizzas after being forced to eat dessert before dinner. It was rediculous. I hope I never get this server again. I've never been so rushed before.
Evelyn T.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",1118,915,518,3.0,1/1/2009,"I'm not crazy about BJ's pizza, their crust doesn't do it for me. The toppings are not that impressive, either. I'd rather go to Oggi's in Mission Viejo for pizza. I like but don't love the pizookie here. The service is all right but not memorable."
M R.,"San Juan Capistrano, CA",1,4,,2.0,5/7/2012,"I love BJ's. but not on my last visit on May 6, 2012.  The waitress must have been new as she walked around like a zombie.  Our table was the closest to the kitchen ... she walked out with our water, passed our table, served others, talked to a complaining nearby table and then... dropped the water off.  She barely took our order, NEVER cleared our table (she passed by our table as mentioned we were closest to the kitchen).  Food came out about 30 minutes later, my ribeye, which I never order steak unless at a steakhouse, was luke warm, cold veggies, daughter's order was messed up and hubby's food was luke warm.  She brought my plate back ... and nuked it!  At that point, since we all worked over 10 hours ourselves at our family biz (also hospitality) I just let it go.  Disappointed to say the least."
Gigi M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",1001,687,2181,5.0,2/19/2009,All I gotta say is 5 stars for the following:  ~PB Pazooki  ~Avocado egg rolls  ~Beer selection  ~Menu filled with delicious of variety of different flavors  ~Chill/sporty/contemporary design  Have never left dissatisfied at any BJ's!
Jack L.,"Laguna Beach, CA",0,5,,4.0,7/12/2012,"I frequent this place because I like it - prices are reasonable, food is usually great - haven't had a bad meal yet.. and if it's your birthday, they give you a mini Kamikazi dessert (or whatever it's called) Don't worry, they won't embarrass you with a song and dance. Fish and chips are good.. and I know my F+Cs. Jemmy-red is my fave. Would also recommend the meatloaf. Admittedly, steaks appear to be at high-end prices so I haven't really tried since I can make a pretty mean steak at home.  Service is exceptional. Though we always go to the bar area where there always seems to be seating despite it being busy."
Dena D.,"Salt Lake City, UT",21,146,25,2.0,7/29/2009,"I tend to like brewhouses, but this one left me underwhelmed. I had a fried chicken sandwich. The bread was soggy and the lettuce leaf on it had been dead for many, many days. Seriously, it was brown. The one standout: the iceberg wedge. I don't normally get this sort of salad, but I guess this is one of those things they do well, and I was lucky enough to order it on a recommendation from a friend. It was crispy and delicious. I could have used some of that lettuce on my other dish...."
Michelle S.,"Mission Viejo, CA",1,17,,1.0,6/12/2012,"When I first arrived the hostess was on her cell phone and told me her shift was over so I should ""go seat myself"". After finally being seated by someone I ordered a turkey sandwhich without meat, which is what I usually order. They brought my sandwhich with bacon on it so I sent it back. Then they brought out another wrong sandwhich with the wrong bread and no cheese. The manager and waiter both came over and gave me this look like I was the crazy one and said ""but that sandwhich comes with meat"". I dont understand why they couldnt make a simple sandwhich. I told them dont bother trying to fix it again and I just wanted my check so I could go eat somewhere else. They had the nerve to charge me full price for the sanwhich that I couldnt eat because they made it wrong twice!"
Mimi S.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",11,135,40,4.0,7/27/2009,"This is my favorite type of pizza- tall, greasy and lots of crust! Their sweet pig with jalapenos is to die for. Their Santa fe chicken salad is excellent and their pizookie is one of the best ways to end a meal. They loose one star because service and customer service is lacking so badly.  I would eat there so much more often if I felt they had better service."
Stevo L.,"Newport Beach, CA",13,107,20,1.0,9/15/2013,"Let me start by saying that I used to be a regular customer here in the late 90s and early 2000s. Let me also say that I will never be a customer here again. Four of us showed up last night on a Saturday night to eat dinner. It was a celebratory dinner because one of us got a new job. We ordered a large pizza, a flatbread, and a salad. The food took 45 minutes to arrive. I understand Saturday's can be a little bit busy so we can certainly give that part a pass. When the food arrived, the pizza and the flatbread were lukewarm. If you do the math, the pizza would be the last thing to come out of the oven and the flatbread shortly before that. This would indicate to me that our food just sat there for God knows how long. We couldn't find the waitress for a while because she was somewhere out of view. Once we called her over, we advised her of the problem with our food. She said that she would bring the manager over. In the meantime, she offered us dinner rolls to hold us over. The manager apologized when she arrived and said that the pizza would only take about 10 minutes to cook again. We decided that seeing as we were having some good conversation we would wait another 10 minutes to bring up the pizza and the flatbread. The server brought two rolls for our party of four and said to us that they did not have any other rolls ready. As you could've guessed by now, these rolls were stale. It took another 45 to 50 minutes to receive our pizza. Once the pizza and flatbread arrived, they screwed up the toppings on the pizza. Obviously at this point in our in 45 minutes into our supposedly all we decided to take the pizza to go. My wife ate by herself for most of this meal and they decided wisely to comp us for the food. The server came by again and told us the manager would come visit us before we left. 15 minutes later the manager had not come by and we left. Before I wrote this review, I noticed that other people have had the same experience with food not making it out to the restaurant in an expeditious fashion. I sure hope the owners or the managers read this review, because people will be dropping like flies if they were treated like we were. Never again at this location. I have had many good experiences at other BJ's in the past. Unfortunately will never go back to this one again. There are several things wrong with this restaurant in our experience. The first thing is that once our food took to long to make, someone should've expedited our order. Once our food was up, the manager should've delivered the food and/or made sure that the order was correct. For the server to offer us dinner rolls was inappropriate, because we were waiting for pizza not rolls. Maybe offer an appetizer. It is pretty obvious that the server let our food sit the first time and did not check it the second time. The manager not showing up the second time was just unsatisfactory. Just to make sure that BJ's corporate offices are aware of this, I am cutting and pasting."
T C.,"Oakland, CA",112,791,313,4.0,8/27/2008,"BJ's is fucking delicious!  Yea yea, I seem to be on a corporate, culinary tour. Fuck it, it was great and I'll sing it from the rooftops! Something smelled a lil funny & I started to bacteria-trip over the sticky menus. Regardless of those issues, I enjoyed my sliders!  My strawberry lemonade was a real strawberry lemonade, not just that syrupy mess they dump in lemonade, but real blended, tasty strawberries in a tall, chilled glass of lemonade. I think we all expected it to be pretty mediocre food here, so when it surpassed our expectations, it blew our mother fucking minds. Our waitress had the cutest, raspy voice and was super friendly. Her friendliness was genuine and she was on top of the refills and additional needs. Lots of American Psycho look alikes at this location.  Good ole corporate eye-candy."
Andrew C.,"Laguna Hills, CA",9,39,49,5.0,4/24/2011,"Every time I take my family here, we love the food. Great thick crust thick with toppings - the server can tell what you ordered just by looking at your pizza. We enjoy the chocolate chip pizookies and also enjoy the bustling atmosphere. It's not always perfect of course, we waited overlong for our desserts, but we'll keep coming back. Also - do try the Black Velvet Guiness and Berry-Burst cider, a mouth watering combo."
Fritz C.,"Fort Knox, KY",198,12,1,5.0,8/19/2011,Went there for lunch and the lunch specials selections were pretty good and cheap. I had the stuffed potato loaded and the Tortilla Soup. The food environment and service was enjoyable.
Jamie A.,"Irvine, CA",10,55,,4.0,11/12/2008,"I went yesterday around 2:00 for lunch with a girlfriend. We happen to get there early enough to have lunch and a drink. We sat at the bar as we always do for a late lunch. We had the sweetest bartender who was chatty but still very attentive to her guests and also getting her stuff done.  I was shocked to get our bill and it was $11 and change for a salad, pizza and a drink (of course alcohol). I know right now with the economy hurting EVERYONE is running specials and we will definitely be visiting again. They run lunch specials till 3:00. . . check it out!  The only reason I marked it 4 stars is due to the two at the front (host & cashier) looked up at us as we walked in the door, said nothing as they looked at us blankly and then proceeded to jump back into their convo. Same thing as we left. . .I hate being neglected. Insert sad face here."
Mike P.,"Irvine, CA",0,18,2,2.0,2/15/2013,"Mediocre food, long wait, poor service. Food delayed for one of our party with no explanation or adjustment"
Alex L.,"Anaheim, CA",260,300,156,4.0,4/4/2009,"I remember about 5 years ago eating at the one in Huntington Beach and it was someone's birthday, probably mine. I remember it was a pleasant visit and I remember the food being good.  Went there a couple of weeks back with my aunt and father. Ordered a medium pizza, Chicago-style, of course. The appetizers were sweet onion fries and garlic bread. At first, I didn't think the sweet onion fries were that much, hence the garlic bread. Then, the fries showed up. It was this huge lump of..... fried stuff! It looked like golden-brown fried goodness with the seeming appearance of a bowl's worth of spaghetti with 2 types of dipping sauces. I knew that alone was too much for 3 people. Imagine that and the garlic bread. Good thing that was only 4 meager slices of bread the size of regular-sized hot dog bun halves. So be careful about how abundant these appetizers per order. From what I can surmise, the price is a hint on how much volume you have to deal with.  The pizza, for all of you guys who have never been to this place, you can order the pizza half and half. The types of pizza are too hard to resist. During this most recent visit, the medium pizza is half Great White and half Buffalo Chicken. The great white is a white sauce with various meats, I don't remember what they were. The Buffalo chicken was just that: red, moderately spicy and swimming in poultry goodness. Both had sauces that you can dip the pizza slices in, but, being Chicago-style pizzas, you have to cut them first and then dip them in with forks. These are not the NY-style pizzas nor is this Pizza Hut or Domino's. The Buffalo Chicken dip was ranch, to soften the spicy blow to your gustatory senses. The Great white, I think, was a red sauce, something like marinara.  From a previous visit, two things to try for those who've never tried or never been here: the Sweet Ham Pizza. Just oodles and oodles of porcine goodness piled on top of this pizza. Good stuff. The other is the Pizookie. It's a saucer-sized choco-chip cookie served as if it was a personal pizza and a dessert at the same time. I'm sure this oh-so-goodness is served a la mode. Come to think of it, I think that visit to the BJ's in HB I mentioned previously? I think that was my b-day and they served this to me for free since I was one year closer to death. Yes folks, I never really got why we celebrate birthdays in the first place. But hey, I can't complain about the free dessert.  The one thing you also need to remember about this place is the fact that this place is also a microbrewery. I am not much of a drinker of beer, I rather have cocktails or wine. But at one point, I think it was that trip to BJ's in HB, I had the sampler of each of the beers they had. They were decent to good. If you are a connoisseur of beer, you might want to check it out and see if this places tickles your palate.  The atmosphere of the place was fairly decent. It's reminiscent of an upscale sports bar, especially with a dozen TV screens (not the actual number) flashing various sports and distracting patrons from the conversations that they're trying to have.  Our waiter, he was nice, but seemingly distracted. I got a vibe from him that he couldn't wait to leave our table to proceed to the next one. I wondered why for about a couple of minutes.  So if you are a pizza fan, especially those gut-busting Chicago-style ones, this is a place to try. If you plan to write a review of this place, there is so much to take in, so take notes and pics. I didn't. I should've. I will next time."
