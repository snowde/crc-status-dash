Alex G.,"PRINCE, NY",83,158,41,2.0,4/6/2009,"Okay, so came here for a drink the other night.  Took a while to get the first drink, despite the bar not being very busy.  We were very close to leaving before the first drink. The clientele looked to be pretty solid middle-aged wastrels.  Nothing interesting here. Can't really understand why anyone would choose to get drunk here when you could get drunk in the parking lot.  Or at home."
Tim S.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",0,5,,5.0,2/26/2010,"Last week, after a particularly busy schedule, we stopped in at BJ's for dinner on Valentine's day.  I was pleasantly surprised that we were quickly seated, and totally surprised at the menu options ! I made a selection of an item I had never tried, and it was very tasty and well prepared. The service was excellent, and prompt. I look forward to going back again soon and trying some of the other items on the menu that looked so appealing."
Shannon G.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",135,249,161,4.0,5/1/2011,I don't care for the pizza but I love the avocado egg rolls and the tomato bisque soup.  The mini quesadilla  is also wonderful. It is a bit pricey for me so I don't make it over there too often.
Eric M.,"Savoonga, AK",9,844,434,5.0,6/2/2011,Kevin is back!  Yay!  Food is secondary to great service when Kevin serves!  And so I had a 7up.
Jaymee E.,"Palm Springs, CA",56,87,26,4.0,4/1/2011,"Always a go to place when we are in the area... 30.00 bucks for pizza ... a bit pricey but it is good. Great for a group, great beer selection. Always good service."
Gwen F.,"Laguna Woods, CA",0,9,,5.0,1/25/2015,"i had the baked potato and soup  , what a great deal and tasted great. the service is always good.  really nice atmosphere to."
Mauro N.,"Lake Forest, CA",0,52,1,3.0,8/22/2013,"OK food, ok beer, sneakily reduced their happy hour portions, making it not as good a deal as it used to be, guess I'll be doing more happy hours at Elephant bar....."

M T.,"South San Francisco, CA",0,199,,3.0,9/22/2013,Lots of choices on the menu.  Large restaurant and can be noisy sometimes.  Have eaten here on a number of occasions over the years when I go to visit my aunt.  Prices are reasonable.  Service was good on our latest visit.
Sylvester G.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",0,6,,5.0,12/15/2014,"The minute my wife and I walked in the door we where greeted with friendly smiles and kind welcomes. After noticing how PACKED this place was I for sure thought it would take at least 1/2 an hour to get a seat. But it only took 5 min. So after getting seated our waitress LIZ, who was so friendly and accomadating, took our order. We ordered two main meals with sides and an appitizer. So our sides from the main meal came out and our main meal came out. But no appitizer. But all along LIZ was so kind and apologetic and kept us up to date about the progress of the appitizer. So then then the manager Robert came over and apologized and asked if he could give us the appitizer on the house. Dont forget this place was PACKED so I get it why it took so long for the apps. to come out. But Robert went out of his way to make us feel like he really cared about us. This place has GREAT SERVICE and Robert and LIZ have GREAT customer service skills. So next time you go there ask to waited on by LIZ. I promise you will not be disappointed."
Christine D.,"San Diego, CA",47,112,9,3.0,2/25/2009,Restaurant was spacious and clean. We didn't have to wait long for a table and we got a giant booth for the 5 of us. We had plenty of room.  We ordered the avocado egg rolls. They were delicious and the dipping sauce was very tasty as well. I also split a pizza with my cuz. The food came quickly and the servers were attentive. I've been going to BJs all over so cal for years now. The service and food never disappoints. Thanks BJs!!
Ashley V.,"Garden Grove, CA",0,1,,1.0,9/1/2014,"Horrible way to end my labor day night. First, the lady taking my curbside order did not know the menu at all nor did she take my name, I had to call her back.  It wasn't until I got home 20 minutes later, that I realized my order was incorrect. The BBQ chicken pizza was not a BBQ chicken pizza from BJ's.The pizza had bbq sauce under some tomatoes and in between what was basically a big loaf of bread.  I asked for thin crust, could have gotten better pizza from dominoes. The salmon i ordered came with a white sauce, rice pilaf and veggies. The salmon I received had asparagus and quinoa with some nasty cherry cough syrup sauce. I called in as soon as I noticed, the guy on the phone was unprofessional to say the least. He told me to come in for my correct order, no apolology, nothing else. I called back to speak to the manager, who offered to have the order corrected or she could give me a voucher for the next time. She also told me she would come speak to me when I returned to get the correct order. I arrived 15-20 minutes later and expected the food to be ready like they said it would. I was wrong, after having to wait another 10 minutes for the food I had to wait an additional 10 minutes for the manager to come out. An hour and a half after placing my original order  and speaking with a manager, all I got was excuses and the blame game. Even after letting her know I'd be writing this complaint on yelp, the manager gave me the go ahead to do so. The time spent talking to her was a complete waste of time and could have been spent eating my food, instead it got cold and after getting home I was so over eating the food!!"
K S.,"Murrieta, CA",0,30,,3.0,9/17/2011,Decent.  Mostly upscale bar food.  Can get a bit over busy on the weekends leading to slower service.
Meg F.,"Culver City, CA",3,44,,4.0,2/4/2011,"It's definitely not health food, but sometimes you just need a 1,500 calorie sandwich and a 700 calorie side salad.  Oh, and crispy fries.  Plus pizzokie. I really appreciate this particular location because a group of moms and I have been trying to meet for lunch once a week.  The servers are always very accommodating of us and our four strollers.  They don't sigh when we all order water (oh, the sad life of a nursing mom) and they don't groan when we ask to split the check.  They take great care of us, so we keep coming back."
Cherrie H.,"Laguna, CA",13,94,42,3.0,12/24/2010,"I love the food but the restaurant is noisy and not the atmosphere I would like to enjoy my lunch/dinner in, so most of the time we get our food to go. Now for the problem, while the food is good we have a 50/50 chance it will be warm and the last time we ordered, the fries did not appear to be cooked. So when the food is warm (and cooked) it is great but eating a meal from BJs is a crapshoot - of course this won't stop us because they have a couple unique dishes that other restaurants do not offer (and we must satisfy the occasional craving)."
Josh N.,"El Toro, CA",20,9,1,4.0,5/21/2011,Great happy hour! Jeremiah Red is dangerous!
Jason B.,"El Toro, CA",0,12,,5.0,8/20/2011,Pazookie! That's all I need to say.... Right?
calvin a.,"Irvine, CA",35,81,,4.0,3/7/2010,"A fun place to go with friends or family and watch a game and grab some  chicago style pizza. If your not a fan of pizza they offer an extended menu with many different types of food. The burgers here a very good if your carving one. If you want a starter try the avocado egg rolls their really good. After your meal make sure to save room for their famous Pazookie, a fresh undercooked cooked warm cookie with ice cream on top"
bimali b.,"Laguna Hills, CA",5,99,1,4.0,2/14/2013,"I have been here several times and have liked it a lot. The food is good, lots of choices and the pizza alone is great, if you like the deep dish kind. I dont drink so I am no expert on the beer selection, but my hubby likes them all and says it is a good selection. The Pizooki alone is an experience - who wouldnt like a warm chocolate chip cookie right out of the oven with vanilla ice cream melting on top? It is always good."
Leslie O.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",23,46,10,4.0,8/12/2010,"I am not one for deep dish pizza (which is BJ's specialty), so I've always frowned about this restaurant when my husband suggested we come here.  This time I asked for a flatbread pizza and it was great!  This restaurant has moved up on my list for the mere fact that they have options.  My husband loves deep dish, and I love flatbread!  Now we're both happy!."
