Kelly D.,"Laguna Hills, CA",0,14,,5.0,3/3/2009,"I went here for my 21st birthday. It was delicious. The pizza is thick crust  panned pizza(served in a pan)so if you like thin crust you wont like the pizza here . Also I had the margaritas here. They were really strong. It might have just been the times I went, but after my birthday I went again and got another and 2 made me tipsy, so its stronger than most places I have gotten them including Mexican restaurants.Like I said I don't know if I got lucky.. The service is usually pretty good too. The only argument I would have is there pizza doesn't have much if any sauce. Also the pizookies are really good. It basically like a big cookie served in a pan. I really enjoy the chocolate chip and the Oreo ones.(Oreo one tastes like a big brownie) Enjoy!!"
Sandy T.,"Garden Grove, CA",228,427,35,4.0,4/17/2008,"For my birthday lunch, my coworkers took me here... food was decent but the best part?  Free pizookie on your birthday!  Oh, and on this particular day a couple of hot firemen walked by us a few times. Oh happy birthday to me."
Jason N.,"Orange County, CA",3,36,2,4.0,5/26/2008,"This is a brewhouse but my 8 year old nephew of all people recommended to me. So I took my sister and her family to celebrate my new job.  And it turned out to be a very nice place for family, friends, or a date.  Food was good and affordable - very generous portions. Atmosphere was open and lively, but not noisy.  Service was good.  I'm not a serious beer drinker, but I enjoyed a Hefeweizen - very fruity and light, with a little foam. It worked well with the deep dish pizza and champaign shrimp pasta. I had to pack food home. Oh, my sister ordered a very good New York Steak but the highlight was the  huge baked potato - a size of a little guinea pig! All the food was well prepared. I would defenitely come back to try other menu items and recommend BJ's."
QB K.,"Mission Viejo, CA",2,41,16,5.0,9/9/2010,"Beer, great! Pizza, great!  Asian salad, amazing!  Pazookie,heaven in the form of a desert."
Trevor T.,"Irvine, CA",80,365,27,4.0,4/13/2008,"I like this place, and I'm not ashamed to admit it. I simply love their deep dish pizza, oozing with cheese and topped with chopped roma tomatoes. First time at this location, and the food was good. The service was passable. We ordered chips & salsa to start - nice fire-roasted taste in the salsa. A few of the chips were on the salty side.  Main course: Make-your-own pizza topped with italian sausage, applewood-smoked bacon and green peppers. Simply awesome."
A B.,"Stockton, CA",2,151,,1.0,12/3/2011,"I was a huge fan of BJs but my experience at this location has deterred me from ever coming back. I ordered a pizza over the phone for take out, the person who took my order never gave me the price so assumed it was the usual $25 for a 4+ topping pizza. When I arrived to pick up my pizza, the total came out to me a whomping $48, for a large pizza with several toppings. I kindly asked why the total was so high because I normally purchase the same pizza dine-in for half the price! The manager came out looked at me and asked the hostess if I spoke English. I told him, YES I speak English and I just wanted to know if the prices have changed. He ignored me and told the hostess that he did not understand what I was saying and that she should go over the menu with me. The hostess told him that I did indeed speak English and that I just wanted to know when the price for the pizza had changed. He looked at me, handed me a menu and told me to go home and compare the menu with the one that I had at home and then I can figure out the price difference.  NEVER have i felt so humiliated. YES, I should have asked for the price immediately after I placed my order to avoid any discrepancies. But isn't it the manager's job to answer any questions or concerns a customer may have? Without the customer, there would be no business. Maybe he was having a rough day, but there is absolutely no excuse to belittle let a lone discriminate a customer based on their proficiency in the English language."
Kelly I.,"Dublin, CA",50,341,1,4.0,11/27/2007,"BJ's.  Another one of those places that can please the whole fam and all the extensions (hubby, girlfriends, buddies, etc.).  We make a trip to this location once a visit to get the whole group of us at the same table enjoying the family favorite, pizza.  Every Friday night was and still is pizza night in my family.  Unfortunately my palate has expanded and my Friday nights are searching for new and undiscovered cuisine besides pizza.  But it always has that place in my heart.   The wait can be long here but even with a minimum group of 8, I don't think we've ever waited more than 20 minutes, which I expect on a weekend at a place that doesn't take reservations. The best part of the wait is they bring out sample pizza slices, just lets you know what you're waiting for.  Brillant! The pizza here is consistent and probably my favorite form of thick crusted pizza.  The beer selection is great and I love the pale ale, nice and hoppy!  You gotta love a place that serves its own brand of brew, and is good to boot. The TVs are always tuned to several different games, which is great for my sports loving family.  The Pizookies are amazing and nothing fills my sweet tooth like a warm chocolate chip cookie smothered in ice cream.  Hopefully we will get one closer than Napa in the Bay Area."
Henry P.,"Brea, CA",0,5,1,1.0,1/23/2013,"Long wait time in the kitchen and web the food was served it was cold. Bad service, bad waitor. Disappointed in the overall service."
jessica d.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",0,13,2,1.0,10/31/2011,"I met up with a friend at the BJ's off El Toro road in California on a Sunday night.   She had asked to sit at the bar, but it was full so the hostess sat her at a table.  I arrived maybe three minutes later and as I am sitting down the waitress came to take our order.  I asked for a few minutes since I have not even had a chance to open my menu.  She comes by maybe three minutes later to take our drink and food order. We say that we are just there for a cocktail and we order our drink.  When she returns she ask again what we are eating, we tell her again that we are just there for a drink.  She says we must move to the bar, despite the fact that their are plenty of empty tables around us.  We carry our own drinks to a table in the bar, and sit down.  A girl comes by to say she is our new server and we never see her again.  The original waitress served us the wrong beer, but after maybe about twenty minutes of trying to waive someone else down to get the correct one, we decide just to drink the beer we have.   Orginially we planned on getting a couple of drinks, but since after being there for an hour we only since our waitress once, we decide just to get the check instead of another drink.   My friend ask for a water with the check and like the service all night it takes her about ten minutes to bring it to us.  My friend takes a sip of her water and spits out a huge piece of glass, she continues to fish out maybe five or six pieces of glass.  She shows our waitress and all she says is, ""oh sorry. Let me get you a new glass of water without glass in it"", then kind of laughs.  Not once did the manager come over and apologize.  I think this kind of service is unacceptable and dangerous.  I can't help but question what kind of health and sanction practice BJ's practices if they are not the least bit concerned that there is glass in the cups.  I can only imagine taking a bite of your pizza and finding a bug in it.  Would the waitress have said, ""Oops must have fallen out of the trap?""   I was a frequent visitor of BJ's but I will never be back again because of this experience."
Gabby H.,"Irvine, CA",62,128,7,4.0,2/6/2008,"Another work lunch, and the birthday girl chose BJ's. I've been to this location before, and wassn't thrilled or grossed out. So it was an okay choice with me! It's a very large building, that is for sure. Although we had a large party, we were seated quickly, which is nice for lunchtime. Our server took drink orders quickly as well. We ordered several appetizers to start: buffalo wings, the appetizer combo, and avocado eggrolls. I really liked the eggrolls. They were very similiar to the Cheesecake Factory's version, but not as ginormous. The buffalo wings were different. They weren't tossed in hot sauce, just fried with a little drizzle on top. Good, but greasy. I ordered the calzone for lunch. I chose sausage and onions as my two filling choices, and I was happy I did. It was a pretty large calzone, and was perfect! If you've ever had BJ's deep dish pizza, you know how good the crust is. They used the same crust for my calzone. Very yummy. All in all, BJ's was a decent lunch spot."
Larry Y.,"Aptos, CA",0,13,1,2.0,1/2/2013,"I attended this restaurant on New Year's Eve. I know that is a bad day for any restaurant. They were very busy so as a party of one, I took an open spot in the bar area. My server said she would take care of my beeper with the front desk (that I had put in my name for an open table in the main dining area). My name was later called and I had to get up and tell the front desk that I was already seated. My server seemed to be very rattled and disorganized. She took my drink order and then my food order. I had ordered an appetizer along with my meal. I also added a bowl of soup to my dinner. My soup came out before my appetizer. Actually the person brought out two bowls of soup thinking there was another person at my table. My appetizer showed up only a couple of minutes before my entree. The food was OK but nothing spectacular. I did take the appetizer home to eat as a late night snack."
Ben C.,"Dallas, TX",18,139,24,3.0,8/2/2009,"Went for lunch and typically not a huge fan, but it was good today!  The only thing was the price, not cheap to say the least."
Echo K.,"Ashland, OR",0,13,,4.0,4/17/2009,"PIZOOKIE. Everything is delicious. Everything. Their white cheddar mashed potatoes are the best mashed potatoes I've ever had in my life, and I'm a potato fanatic. Piz00kie. It's usually pretty busy, you might have to wait a while for a seat on a weekend evening, and they always have whatever big sports game is on on their many many big screen tvs, but the atmosphere is fun. and everything I've ever tried on the menu has been amazing.  nay, LEGENDARY. and also... pizookie."
Amy K.,"Irvine, CA",595,754,1040,4.0,12/22/2008,"I went to BJ's with a large party again.  This time I got the shrimp tacos.  YUM!  If you're not in the mood for pizza or a salad, try the tacos.  Delicious!"
Angela K.,"Dana Point, CA",39,80,,5.0,10/22/2009,"I love BJ's. One of my go to places. On any given Friday night, I'll ask my husband, ""What do you want to do, go to BJ's?"" and the answer is always a resounding yes. I haven't had anything on the menu that's bad however some of my favorites are the Buffalo Chicken Pizza, BBQ Chicken Pizza and the Wedge Salad. Surprisingly, this place also has some pretty good chips and salsa. And of course, the pizzoki is a must! (Maybe not every time, its pretty rich)  Love how this place is one of the few places in South Orange County open late. God forbid, you get hungry after its actually dark, you're SOL. (I'm exaggerating but honestly, not by much)  I love all the TV screens in the place so I know we can always see a Dodger or Laker game even though if you're not sitting in the bar, odds are you'll be squinting to see the score.  Quick note though, I'd stick to their own beer here. Although they have a full bar and other beers they can be pretty expensive ($9 for a tiny glass of framboise?!?!?!) or just plain weird (""sangria"" which did not contain wine or fruit, uh, what?)."
Ty S.,"Lake Forest, CA",0,60,,4.0,5/12/2012,"My review based on 4 visits to this location.  Three of the visit were during lunch and one visit for breakfast/brunch in the weekend.  Three of the 4 times, the service was very good.  And one visit was kind of poor.  The service in the last visit was good.  That is for the service.  I am not drinker so I cannot rate their drinks.  The food was good every visit, but it was not great.  The portions are good size here.  The prices are in the cheaper side considering the portion size."
Christina S.,"Laguna Woods, CA",0,2,,2.0,7/13/2012,"We frequently visit this restaurant and the service and food are always great. However, during our past two visits the service has been TERRIBLE. The past two visits Ryan has been our server. He chooses not to write down orders which resulted in our food coming out incorrect during our visit a couple weeks ago. During tonights visit, he again chose not to write down the order and in a panic to get our rather lengthy order in the computer, he completely forgot to take my order (who happened to be the only pregnant female at the table). Miraculously our food came out correct, but refills and parmesan/pepper were never brought. After requesting cheese and peppers from Ryan, it was never delivered and I had to get up and ask the bartender for assistance. Ryan then asked if we wanted dessert in the middle of our meal, he then dropped the check without asking if we wanted any more beers. Once we ordered another beer, we waited a few minutes and the check with the charged beer was brought without the beer, We watched for 15 minutes as countless beers passed by our table and while Ryan continued to take care of other tables. We flagged him down to cancel the beer which he replied, ""yeuh""(not sure what that means). We then left the empty checkbook at the end of the table and Ryan asked if we wanted to split it down the middle. I was confused because we didn't receive a revised check. He then brought us THE SAME EXACT CHECK charged with the beer we never received. I immediately flagged him down and asked for the correct check, which we then received our first apology during our visit. Finally received the correct check and paid out. Extremely disappointed in the lack of attentiveness. All of us work in the industry, service of this caliber should not be tolerated.  I will return in the future, but I refuse to be waited on by Ryan."
Raven G.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",0,2,,2.0,3/23/2014,"Was looking forward to eating here. Really wanted to like this place. Arrived and gave our names to the host, waited about 5-10 minutes or so, not a big deal. The host who walked us to the table was personable, chatty but not fake, told him it was my mothers birthday in conversation (which he relayed to our server) we get seated at a table near the doors to the patio. Our server came over after about 5 minutes or so, never said her name, again not a big deal, immediately asked for our drink and appetizer order, to be fair she also wished mom a happy birthday which was nice. Cutting to the chase, the whole experience was mediocre at best. I ordered a veggie burger and told her that I was allergic to a particular herb, not only did she not check but she asked me if I knew if I could eat a ""Garden"" burger. My boyfriend went Through most of his meal without a refill on his beer. All in all we won't be back, my meal was poor, left most of it on my plate. Service was poor. My mom enjoyed her burger and her complimentary dessert so there's that."
SAMIRA G.,"Philadelphia, PA",20,53,123,5.0,7/9/2011,Big portions for food. The PAZOOKIE (semi-baked cookie with ice cream) came to our table sizzling hot with ice cream. Buffalo pizza was OH HELL YEA (according to one of the Yelper's ratings :P
Denise C.,"Laguna Hills, CA",5,10,,2.0,1/7/2012,"Haven't been here since Oct. might have been my last time. My husband and I used to spent most of our Friday night here but decided to cut back due to the$ we were spending. For the most part, we liked the food but it seems to have gotten a little less satisfying, hit and miss.  When we went there in October the service was bad. We had a server that was training the other. During the service I would say I wasn't sure who was gaining who. I got my regular selection. BBQ Chicken salad, there was some kind of problem, because I ordered half a salad. I guess they don't like you doing that when it's not lunch time. Anyway, it wasn't good. Two of the family members I was with had to go to the bar to get another beer as the servers were not coming back to check on us. They have opened a new BJ's in RSM, might give it a try."
