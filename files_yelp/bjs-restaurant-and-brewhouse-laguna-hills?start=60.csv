Karen J.,"Orange County, CA",1,16,3,5.0,9/6/2017,This restaurant was very good. Service was fast food was excellent. I had prime rib that came with everything including three choices of sides and pizookie. Definitely coming here again. Lots of choices in beers too!
Mike K.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",51,2,,1.0,9/20/2017,This place has terrible service. They forget your order and it takes forever to get drinks and food. They even end up bringing the wrong persons tab at the end and their bill was more. And this happened more than once. Not a fan. Sit at the bar. The one in Irvine is much better
Harry F.,"Mission Viejo, CA",3,56,5,2.0,6/30/2017,Disappointing visit. Let me start by saying the prime rib was excellent. Cooked perfectly and great flavor. Unfortunately the service didn't make for a great experience. The servers walk around with tablets and take your order on it. Ours never looked up. No smile. No conversation. Just thanks and gone. We didn't see her again until we were well into our main course. I would have liked a second beer but nobody came to our table. The salad I ordered never showed up and when I asked the server about it she started tapping her tablet and walked away. Two thirds of the way through dinner someone walked up to the table with a salad not sure what to do with it and then he walked away. With the salad. We won't hurry back.
Susan R.,"Oceanside, CA",84,12,1,1.0,8/13/2017,"We ordered take out . We got two large pizzas , and at $50 for all of it, I would expect better quality. The crust was soft and not crisp , hardly any sauce . I could have gotten a better pizza from a delivery service. The girl on the phone wasn't nice either. Won't be back ."
Maxine D.,"Wildomar, CA",4,102,42,3.0,8/7/2017,"Jasmine was a great server but everything else was WTF.  The hostess blew off our concern about being put by a service door with a ""it's not where food comes out"". Yeah but employees go in and out on break. And the silverware is wrapped so you get all the noise from that.  The appetizer came with half cooked chips.  Before it came back the 2 pizzas were delivered and THEN the salads came out. And finally the appetizer made a return appearance.  Jasmine was so sorry and brought us a cookie.  The food was fine as most BJs are.  On the way out the trash that had been on the lobby floor when we came in was still there.  My advice is ""take some pride people"""
Jennifer S.,"Las Vegas, NV",108,98,162,4.0,2/21/2017,It was pretty tasty. I've never been to this restaurant before and was quite happy with their selections. The service was great and it did not take long to receive it. My only real complaint is that my fries were very cold.  I'd come again.
Vivian C.,"Mission Viejo, CA",36,3,,1.0,9/2/2017,"BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse, Laguna Hills, California Their Take Out Service really Stinks!!!! Last time I went they gave me a meat burger instead of a Veggie Burger after we went over everything at least 4 times and when I picked it up they assured me all was right. I got home took a bite, luckily it was just the bun, saw the meat burger and immediately called them up. My husband got to eat but my burger was wrong and I had to take it back and my grilled cheese would be cold by the time I would get back. So the manager said she would have it all remade. Except my husband's of course. So I went back got the food. All that took 90 minutes to from the time I got there till the time I got to eat. The manager gave me some kind of card toward another meal.  Give us another chance she said. I said Oh I will. Today is the second time I have ordered and they got the order wrong. We went over the veggie burger part 4 times before. No Mayonnaise. I wanted Thousand Island. They assured me 4 times before and two times when I went to pick the order up.   I got home. I had Mayonnaise, No Thousand Island. I called. I refuse to go and get it the food right again. They said someone could take it to our house. I started to give the guy my address and then I gave up!!!! I am done with this company. This is so uncalled for.  The Take Out Service Stinks!!!! I am so angry it is hard to even eat what I received from this restaurant. I couldn't eat it. I had to throw it away. Vivian"
Daniel H.,"Dana Point, CA",107,86,369,4.0,8/7/2016,Very good food.  Pizza is excellent.  Good wine and custom brews.  Have not found a favorite but some interesting tastes   Call ahead because they are always busy.
Priya B.,"Carlsbad, CA",63,363,1079,3.0,7/9/2016,"I got a mozzarella and tomato side salad and kale and Brussels sprout salad as my entree. The whole table also ordered the spinach and artichoke dip and the avocado egg rolls. Both my salads were pretty good, except the Brussels sprouts I felt like could have been softened up a tiny bit. In order to add to the flavor, I asked for some shaved Parmesan cheese and added some chili flakes. My husband got the deep dish ravioli and he really enjoyed it. Our waitress was very kind and we enjoyed being served by her. This location seems like it's a popular venue and was very packed even when we were there. The rest of my table got various types of pizza, which they all enjoyed as well. I'm sure if we are in the area and craving pizzas and mozzarella and tomato salad we will be back to check it out."
Saree C.,"Long Beach, CA",89,185,214,2.0,10/8/2015,"The first thing I noticed when I walked into this BJ's Restaurant for lunch today was the off-putting smell.  It literally smelled like a slight mist of rotting garbage all throughout the establishment.   Appetizer sampler plate: Liked the spinach artichoke dip.  Honestly not a big fan of the avocado egg rolls, but the avocados seemed fresh and the accompanying tamarind sauce made it better. It wasn't spicy at all, if any of you were wondering.   I was not a big fan of the Santa Fe spring rolls, but if you like southwestern flavor, this might be up your ally.  The shrimp scampi was okay.  It has a decent helping of shrimp.  It also has more tomatoes than I would like in a meal, and I honestly think it could do without the breadcrumbs.  I probably wouldn't get this again. Though I'm curious to try the bison burger at a different location.   We were seated quickly. The wait staff were all friendly, and efficient.  The food was served hot.  Our drinks were refilled at least once. I don't like leaving reviews with low ratings, but the smell was just too overbearing for me to overlook."
Jonathon P.,"Garden Grove, CA",0,17,8,5.0,11/15/2016,"My wife & I came in for a lunch date yesterday and were very pleased. We were immediately greeted upon walking in, immediately seated and our server was at our table within about (30) seconds. To say the least, the service started off lightning fast.  Our server, Mark was awesome. Very polite & professional, but didn't just stand there and read from their little script. He legitimately made an effort to make a bond with us and inquired about our day, etc. It was a nice touch and we both appreciated it very much.  Our appetizer (mozzarella sticks) came up incredibly fast & tasted amazing. Mark took the time to explain our menu options and made sure we both got exactly what we were looking for.  My wife & I ended up going with the ""2 for $25"" deal. That deal consisted of two soups or salads, a medium pizza (to share) and a pizookie. In our opinion, a TON of food! It was definitely more than enough to fill us both up! I went with soup for my first course; choosing the Broccoli Cheddar Soup. It was awesome! My wife chose the BLT salad and loved it! We shared the Meat Lovers Pizza and it was incredible.  As our time in the restaurant went on, the flawless service did not stop. Our food came up very, very quickly and exactly to order. Mark made sure that we had everything we needed and insured that our drink glasses were never empty. We both appreciated that he checked on us continually while we are, but not to the point where it became annoying and he made sure to never interrupt our conversation.  Once we finished up, we asked for boxes so we could take our amazing leftovers home with us. Instead of just setting boxes on the table, Mark took the time to box up everything for us. I appreciated him going above and beyond! In closing, this trip to BJ's was perfect. The food was incredible and the customer service was top notch!"
Shannon F.,"Lake Forest, CA",1,19,7,2.0,6/9/2017,"This bjs has about the worst service probably ever. The waiters are very rude and insensitive and profile people based upon looks. As in they pick and choose who to give good service depending on the tip they think they're going to get. I've only met one wonderful server there but the rest are just super disappointing. One specifically being a waiter named jeff, he kept saying side comments to me that was just passive aggressive and not to mention he slammed down the ranch I asked for on the table. I'm only giving it two stars because the pizzas aren't horrible. Yard house over Bj's any day"
Ricky J.,"Laguna Hills, CA",150,17,25,4.0,8/16/2017,Not a bad place to go get some late dinner and drinks. Sometimes it can get really crowded so just make sure to call first. They got some good house beers.
James R.,"Irvine, CA",61,18,,5.0,7/29/2017,"My wife and I came to BJ's in Laguna Hills and our experience for off on a very negative note with a server who was not attentive.  However, after saying something to the manager everything changed for the better.  The manager and another server checked in on us frequently without being overbearing, and really took great care of us.  We didn't expect anything except better service, but they ended up comping our meal completely.  As a long time BJ's patron who has dined at over 20 of their locations across the country I was really impressed with the way the manager (I think her name is Stephanie or Sherry) and the other gentleman server who took over stepped up and took great care of us.  Even if they didn't comp us I would have written a good review based on the way the manager and new server really stepped up and made sure we were tended to.  Great job BJ's Laguna Hills!"
Dennis L.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",44,6,,1.0,4/23/2017,"Usually get pretty good service here. Today, not so much. It started with our drink order. First server showed up and took our drink order. Mostly waters, and ice tea, one strawberry lemonade and one peach-berry ice tea. Seemed like we had to wait a littler longer than usual for our drinks. Two other servers came by to take our drink orders. When the server brought our drinks she brought a peach ice tea by mistake. When she was informed it was incorrect she had no idea what a peach-berry tea was and had to be shown on the menu.  Later we ordered our meals. Mediterranean chicken tacos, no cilantro, arrived with cilantro.  Deep dish Alfredo pizza with just sausage and white onions, showed up with tomatoes and green onions, no white onions. Sent it back to be corrected. More on this order later (it gets better). The Chipotle salmon we order did not show up during the first round of meals. The runner told us he still had to bring it out. It never showed up. When we asked about it we were told the had given it to another table.  The manager did come out to apologize and told us the salmon would be comped. Eventually the salmon did come out, after everyone had finished their meal, except me. I'm still waiting for my pizza. One sever came by and asked what I was still waiting for. I told him they had made my pizza incorrectly and was waiting for the new one. He was trying to be helpful and went into the kitchen. He came out with the original pizza they had brought me. I couldn't help but laugh. I may be wrong but aren't they suppose to through these out, I do know they are not supposed to bring it out to a table. My pizza finally arrived, with tomatoes. Really! I order a pizza with only 2 items and the can't get it right. The offer to get me something else?  Seriously, everyone had finished eating and all I wanted was a pizza that you can't seem to get right. How does getting me something different help.   Sorry, in OC there are lots of places I'd rather spend my money."
Bret M.,"Mission Viejo, CA",122,5,,5.0,3/1/2017,"Great food, great service...  Always good!!!  Robert Wardell and his staff are fantastic.  Manager is the best.   Dine here often.  Beat manager in BJs.   Robert is amazing and his staff is first class."
James G.,"Anaheim, CA",24,8,,2.0,7/9/2017,We waited a while for our server to get our order.  She didn't ask if we wanted appetizers.  We had thought it but since she didn't bring it up we ordered.  She took our order.  That was it.  She seemed preoccupied and lost. Another guy brought our drinks and mumbled something.  Our was brought by another server.  She seemed nice. But our server wasn't attentive.  She asked how we were doing a couple of times but there wasn't that personal connection.  The food was fine. But the service could use some improvement.
Marie G.,"Lake Forest, CA",20,61,16,3.0,10/16/2017,"We went there for dinner 3 weeks ago and the dinner was seriously the bomb!  We had great appetizers, prime rib for dinner and a yummy desert.  My husband and I usually go out to an early date night dinner on Saturday's so we couldn't wait to go back the next Saturday.  The next Saturday we went back and the experience couldn't of been more different.  My husband got the chicken and I got the steak, food was eh, service was just eh, and we left feeling disappointed, unfortunately, I don't think we'll be back anytime soon. The one big plus was you can pay for your meal on the BJ app, so even though we had to wait quite a bit for service, it was nice to be able to just pay our bill and split when we were ready to go!"
Julie G.,"Mission Viejo, CA",2,14,19,4.0,10/20/2016,"I would like to say that I come the Laguna Hills location very often at least 3-4 times a month... this time my sever had such a bad attitude since the moment she asked what we would like to drink. I politely asked for waters all around and she rudely responded, how many... let me remind you there are four menus on the table in a four person table... but I proceeded to answer her by telling her four. She just vibed out bad attitude throughout the night... I tried to brush it off until I no longer could.  I know being a server can be challenging at times, but that should be no excuse for a lowsy service. I could've easily spent $10 on a meal at the in n out nearby, but why didn't I? Because I wanted to have a good time, with good company and good food. But our sever ruined that exerpience for my whole party. Furthermore, we had to keep asking for our drinks to be re-filled and ask for dipping sauces for the food we had ordered. It bothered me when she asked if we would like a box when I had a friend still in the middle of eating his pizza... how rude can that get? Might as well have given me the check the moment I placed the order... when she dropped off the box she also dropped off the check... when she dropped off the check I had asked her that I would like to pay via app and that the account wasn't linked... she demanded to see my personal phone because she said it was linked... when I had already given her my account number... I have no right to even show her my phone it is my personal property. She stood there with her negative attitude and impatiently waited for me, so I can pull up the information that I had just given her... after I showed her ""proof"" of my account she finally went back to link my account correctly this time... before she left I tried to get attention by saying excuse me because, I wanted to add the coupon but she just ignored me.  Let me remind you it was past 10pm on a Wednesday night, it wasn't ram packed busy... At that point I didn't even feel comfortable talking to her about a coupon I wanted to add that I had received via email... so I walked to the front of the house to pay my check. How stupid is that? For a customer to feel uncomfortable to talk to their server? It's not right for me to go through an experience like that. I spoke to the manager at the time and he gave me such a bs excuse that she's ""new"" I'm sorry but if she already has that type of attitude and she's ""new"" it says a lot about the type of standards they are holding here at this location. That should NEVER be an excuse. This was by far the worst experience I've had, I'm very disappointed in the server we had and the ""supervisor"" or manager at the time that helped with my dilemma. He wasn't rude, but his excuse for her was unacceptable.  It only takes one time to ruin it all. And that's exactly what this server did. I will not be coming back to this location. If you are reading this don't bother spending your time or moment here. You receive better customer service at a fast food joint called in n out. Their [in n out] employe standards are apparently a lot higher than this specific location. Should've just gone there but, ohh well too late now... so I'm warning you just to all together avoid this location.  And the cherry on top the food was lukewarm...  Location: Laguna Hills  Date of visit: 10/12/16 (approx 10-10:30pm) Server: Samantha T. *** Update ***  I came back and re-visited this location. Considering the fact that is a good place to watch games. I came back with my boyfriend and some friends who wanted to have a drink and watch the game. I was a little hesitant to do so BUT I'm glad I came back. Tonight we were served by a gentleman named Cameron! He was by far one of the best serves I've ever had here. He was polite, attentive and most of all FRIENDLY. Just because of him I'll definitely be coming back. Keep up the good work Cameron! He was super kind considering the fact that my steak was cooked rare, when I ordered it medium-rare. Without hesitation he got it fixed right away! I loved how he communicated to us about everything; from the appetizers, to deserts he reassured us our orders were placed and on the way. He kept asking how we were doing and refilled our drinks without us ever asking. What more can one possibly ask for?! You [Camen] proved me wrong about this place! Thanks for great service! :-) let's hope I didn't just get lucky with an outstanding server this time; until next time... Location: Laguna Hills  Date of visit: 10/20/16 (6:57pm) Server: Camen (I previously gave this location a one star and due to recent visit, I have updated my rating to four stars after my last visit)"
Zach C.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",1,110,10,3.0,8/6/2017,The pizza here is very deep crust with chunks of tomatoes it's good however it gets boring and bland after the first slice. The salads are very good here however the server was okay but he needs to respect customers also we ordered a large 10 slices but only got a medium 8 slices we asked the waiter he said it's a large so I think we got scammed...
