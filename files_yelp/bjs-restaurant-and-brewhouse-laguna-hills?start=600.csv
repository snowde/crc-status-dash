Louise R.,"Dana Point, CA",0,11,,1.0,12/23/2013,"Ugh..what a dreadful experience.  We'd never eaten at BJ's but went for the pazookie recommendation.  We phoned ahead and arrived early enough to not have to wait which was pretty much the only good thing to come out of the entire evening.  We showed ourselves to the patio after the host said for us to go and see where we wanted to sit and waited for service.  It turned out that waiting for service was pretty much the theme for the evening. Via the ever changing servers, we had to request menus, silverware (twice), napkins and water.  Before we even got the menus, we were asked if we were ready to order?! We waited forever for our entree's and then when they did arrive it was obvious the meals had sat under hot lights for way too long.. the sad crispy vegetables and dry overcooked salmon were barely edible.  When I mentioned it, the server apologized and explained there had been a kitchen backlog (?) and said he'd send the manager straight out.  Over the next 20 minutes he repeated the same thing FOUR times but she never appeared.  We were eventually told they would remove the charges for the salmon meals and offer a free dessert.  We accepted and then had to ask to see dessert menus.  Another ten minutes later, one menu arrived for our party of seven. Even after I told the server that it had been the worst service and meal we'd eaten in a very long time and that I felt the manager should have made an effort to come out, she still didn't bother.  I also asked for the table to be cleared ready for dessert but it never happened..they just set the plates down where-ever they'd fit amongst the dirty plates. I can only say this feels like a poor man's Yard House and would never contemplate returning.  I want my two hours back. Awful, awful, awful."
Pete M.,"Lake Forest, CA",0,37,16,5.0,12/19/2011,"Food is always very good and great selection from full bar.  Several really good low calorie choices. The only bad part is when you try to be seated. I have been there when there is no wait and there are very few customers and there will be 6 or 7 employees cluttered at the reception area talking amongst themselves.  They will take my name, ask us to wait, finish their conversation and then seat us.  This has happened several times.  It is less than professional but the food is good enough that I let it slide."
Monica D.,"Orange County, CA",750,678,46,4.0,1/7/2009,"BJ's is BJ's, let's be honest -- it's been an Orange County staple for as long as I can remember.  Driving all the way up to Huntington Beach, putting up with the long wait in Laguna Beach, suffering through the incompetence of Tustin Marketplace -- for as long as I've lived in Southern California, BJ's has been a basic part of my foodie life.  Deep dish 'Chicago-style' pizza!  Awesomely concocted salads!  Great big giant portions of everything else!  Cool deals on happy hour!  (And once I got old enough, ahem) Decent beer selections! So I'm not really here to write too much on the food.  I came here the other day with some co-workers for lunch and we feasted on the typical lunch specials -- one lady got half sandwich and soup, the other lady got a half baked potato (which, again, was HUMONGOUS) and soup, and I pigged out with a soup, salad, mini pizza AND a Jerry Burst (half Jeremiah red and half Berry Burst Cider -- it's yummy).  Afterward we indulged in a half choc chip-half white choc mac nut Pizookie.  Yums.  The food was brought out in a timely manner and everything was hot, fresh, and, most importantly, correct! However, I DO want to focus on the highlight of our experience -- our server, Josh.  I mean come on -- it's about a three-quarters full house, it's lunch time, and you don't have to be awesome at your job in order to get a pretty righteous tip.  But Josh went above and beyond the standard 'lunch crowd' attitude.  I mean he really took care of us -- always ready with refills, patient, accommodating, and all of this without breathing down our necks throughout the meal.  What a kind and smart young man.  I used to work as a server when I was in college and I remember constantly trying to find that magical balance between ""God I hate my job and I hate serving people"" and ""Man I really need the money and the extra tippage right about now.""  Josh has certainly struck gold with his discovery of that balance.  Seriously, throughout my years of patronizing BJ's, I can't say that I've ever had such an outstanding server. All the other stuff really stands out with BJ's -- clean restaurant, spacious and well-kept bathrooms, great bar area, yadda yadda yadda -- and always has.  However, I wanted to use my Yelp time to sing Josh's praises.  Great job sir!"
Jim B.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,205,5,4.0,6/23/2011,"Went back for the four-beer sampler.  This time I picked the beers that I wanted.  And, they were most excellent!   For food this time around I had the pot roast sandwich.  It was pretty good.  Much better than their supposed Chicago-style pizzas (deep dish pizza is for tourists).  My wife had the sashima appetizer.  She liked it. Since she's Okinawan, that's no mean feat.  At first the beer drew me in.  Now, I'm looking forward to trying something else on the menu."
JJ S.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",23,137,3,4.0,12/26/2008,"Nothing like rewarding youself with pizza and beer after an 8 hour hike!  I forget how pleasantly dark and casual this place is, even with those incessant televisions everywhere.  Their deep dish is always crusty-buttery good.  (Meatball, mushroom, black olive and jalapeno - yum!)  We shared pitchers of pale ale, then the porter.  Both very good brews.  The peanut butter pizookie was tasty, but smaller than I remembered.  Wish I could remember our waiter's name, because he did an excellent job.  I think this is my favorite BJ's in the area.  Laguna is too tiny.  Tustin has rude staff.  Laguna Hills BJ's, you're still just right!"
Ashley T.,"Laguna Hills, CA",66,25,,2.0,8/11/2012,"I like coming to BJs because it's easy in the sense that there's a broad menu and there's something for everyone here. I always have a good time when I sit up at the bar, but this last week I came in for lunch with a friend from college and sat at a table. Service was horrible. I ordered a glass of wine and both times it came out, the wine glass was completely dirty and gross. I work in restaurant... it's standard to polish wine glasses after washing them. I had ordered clam chowder to start, which was ok. I wish it came out with crackers (not sure if it's supposed to and the food runner forgot or if they don't offer them). We waited almost 30 minutes for our lunch to come after we finished our soup (which we ordered at the same time as the soup)... which isn't that big of a deal because we were catching up but if I was in a hurry since it was lunch time I would have been in trouble. I had ordered the half salad and flatbread off of the lunch menu, and asked to sub it with a ceasar salad and a side of ranch for the flatbread. They brought it out with a standard house salad with no dressing on it and no side of ranch. The server never came by to check how the food was, so I just sucked it up. But eating lettuce and carrots with no dressing is gross... I'm not that healthy. Also, throughout service our waitress took my friend's order and would begin to walk away without taking my own (this includes drinks and food). I get that he's good looking, but sweetheart I was hungry too! And I'm the good tipper... I work in the industry. Only reason why I'm giving a 2nd star is because she didn't stop smiling, which I always appreciate."
Davi H.,"Little Falls, NJ",1,83,1,4.0,1/12/2011,"Visited a friend in Laguna and she decided to take me here for lunch. I was pleasantly surprised to get delicious deep dish somewhere outside of Chicago! We shared the BBQ chicken pizza. I was a little skeptical because I usually don't like BBQ pizza since the sauce overwhelms the pizza and it ends up not tasting like pizza anymore... however this wasn't like that. There was a light coating of BBQ sauce underneath fresh tomatoes/sauce and cheese, so it still tasted like pizza, but had a sweet flavor beneath it. Also had the Baked Beignet dessert which was delicious! Cinnamon sugar fried dough topped with ice cream, strawberries, and whipped cream... perfect end to the meal!"
Alan A.,"Foothill Ranch, CA",0,1,,2.0,10/17/2010,"Usually i'm a fan of BJ's Brewhouse but today my friends and i received horrible service. The place seemed steady with many table visibly open.It took us 5 minutes just to get sat when there were atleast 5 workers just sitting around. Little did we know we walked 2 steps over to our table right in the front. Our waiter came up to us within 5 minutes and told us he would be right with us. It took our server 10 minutes to actually greet us and get our drinks. Within those 10 minutes of waiting we all actually made up our minds. Our server seemed nice but his service techniques were horrible. It took our server atleast 10 minutes to bring our drinks out, which were all wrong. On top of that he took another 10 minutes to bring out my side caesar salad but luckily I was distracted by conversations at the dinner table. The salad was half the size they are usually are served and had no croutons what so ever Finally our food arrived...20 minutes on top of that. I decided to try one of my old favorites, the chicken club. Our food was cold, looked dry, and unpleasant. My friends and I already knew it would be very hard to track down our server so once we finally saw him we decided to order our pizookis, knowing that it would take a while.  A while meant another 30 minutes. Our pizookis were brought out and our server just dropped our bill without asking us a single thing. It took him another 20 minutes just to take our transaction to get the hell out of there. Our whole dinner process took us atleast an 1hr 45mins!! We still tipped 15% but seriously the employees need to get their act together. They have so many employees running around but it seems like they are not doing their jobs efficiently. I recommend: Parmesan crusted chicken, Chicken Alfredo Pasta, or the Meatloaf. The tropical tea is the best! And you always need to get a pizooki. I mean its BJs Brewhouse right?!"
Jo H.,"Laguna Hills, CA",0,7,,5.0,10/13/2011,Great Restaurant and fun place to go and watch games on big screen. Good food and staff is friendly. Prompt service.
Melisa S.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",47,3,2,3.0,7/19/2011,"We had our engagement party at this BJs.  We made the reservation for 830 pm and were told we would have access to our tables about 10-15 minutes prior to our reservation time.  When we arrived nothing was ready and/or cleaned.  We had about 40 guests and half of them had arrived by 845 and we still were not seated.  The manager FINALLY got us to our tables and one of the large main tables was still dirty and covered in dirty dishes from a previous party.  We had to decorate the area in front of half of our guests.  Once the tables were cleaned up and the party actually started (food arrived and drink orders going) everything was awesome.  Everybody loved the food and the servers were great.  If you hold a large party at this BJs I HIGHLY recommend booking the site 30 minutes before you actually want people to arrive.  There are other large parties before yours and they do not ask them to leave even though they have a 2 hour time-frame.  The manager was a moron, but the staff, food, and service (after initial problem) was AWESOME!!"
Carol M.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,3,,1.0,7/3/2013,"Tonight, we went out to celebrate our wedding anniversary & ate at BJ's pizza because we've always enjoyed eating there on a regular basis. We waited at our table for over 15 minutes before we had any type of service. We finally called someone over to take our order. When our pizza arrived, it didn't even look like the pizza that we normally order (BJ's favorite). We asked the manager who walked by if that was the pizza we ordered and she said that it was BJ's favorite. We showed the manager that our pizza had some spicy buffalo style chicken on it, which was not on the BJ's favorite ingredients. The manager said that we could get a different type of pizza if we wanted to exchange it. She did not apologize that the wrong ingredient was on our pizza and she did not seem to care. What if someone at our table was allergic to chicken?? We ended up just eating the pizza, which was dry and burnt on the bottom. Honestly, Dominos Pizza tastes better than this pizza did, but Dominos would be a lot cheaper. We were so disappointed that one of our favorite restaurants was so horrible tonight. Throughout the meal, the server was nice, but practically forgot about us for lengthy periods of time. At the end of dinner, we spoke to the manager and explained that we rarely ever complain about anything, but the meal was so below standard that we vowed never to eat there again. The manager did not seem to genuinely care at all. She did not offer any empathy at all. She said that she would talk to the people in the kitchen, but we saw her walk the other way. We were so disappointed, because we eat at this restaurant every few weeks. We were not given any discount or anything to compensate us for the horrible meal. This restaurant has gone downhill."
Ian N.,"Los Angeles, CA",261,29,24,3.0,3/20/2010,"This particular BJ's is very convenient if you come with a party or group of more than 6. The place looks like its built to accommodate large families or parties and I am a really big fan of the large booths that are available, so everyone seats comfortably. I recommend ordering their huge appetizers because they can suffice many with the munchies. I would list all the good appetizers that we ordered when I was there, but  we ordered like 6 appetizers then got a huge pizza. Everyone says the pizza is amazing, but the pizza is ""aaa'ight."" I also recommend getting their house brewed beer (just ask what's recommended to whoever is serving your table).  Their bar is nicely placed in the middle of the place. There's plenty of TVs to watch your favorite game(s). What you really come to BJ's for is for their Pazookies. You definitely have to order one if you come. For those who are unsure of the Pazooki  dessert; basically a freshly baked giant cookie in a pan with scoops of ice cream on top. You can choose from an array of cookies as well. We as  group got the largest sized Pazooki, half chocolate chip, half macadamian, and vanilla ice cream to top it off. Damn, I want one now."
lolo l.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",1,5,,1.0,5/31/2013,"Good food, terrible service for large party.  Don't take a large party here.  We went there sat, may 25 at 5:45 for a 13th bday party with 15 people. There was one waitress for us and 2 other huge parties. She was nice but she didn't take all the orders from all the girls and then when the food came she said ""they were on their phones and didn't give me their orders"".  What the heck?  You are the waitress, you are supposed to ask and if they are on their phones you say ""hey what do you want?"", you don't just skip over them.   Not only that but we went early to try to avoid a dinner rush and it took well over two hours to get done and we had to ask for stuff numerous times.  The management should have had 2 people for each large party and they didn't have enough staff and at a place that is a chain, they should be better managers.  So no I don't recommend this place for a party over probably 5 or 6 people."
Ann M.,"Santa Cruz, CA",0,43,8,5.0,11/10/2007,"This is a huge building, so even if it is crowded , it doesn't really feel like it.  Everything that we tried on the menu was good and we all had very different tastes.  I don't know if I even have enough words for Pizookies....let's see, warm creamy, sweet, but not too rich, delicious, melts in your mouth....kind of like chocolate chip cookies warm from the oven, but since it's served in a dish that keeps it warm, the experience lasts for the whole dessert.  Needless to say, the food is good, but it's just a filler to get to dessert!"
Haley P.,"Laguna Beach, CA",0,17,,5.0,12/16/2009,"pazookie is my favorite dessert! try the oreo one! the cookie is good and if you don't like oreo i suggest you still try it the only thing oreo is the whipped cream. its sooo delicious! also the chicken club and fries is really really good. its a nice place to go with friends or significant other. its relaxing, fun and clean. i love it!"
Rosemary S.,"Mission Viejo, CA",1,10,,1.0,7/26/2011,"While the food and the location are good,  the staff and management leave much to be desired.  To book a reservation over 10 people, you have to speak to the manager. Expect to be put on hold for at least 10 minutes regardless what time you call, and if you say anything about the wait, the mgr will put the blame on you that ""it's a busy time to call"". THAT should have been my cue. After booking my reservation and confirming that my table would be ready 10-15 min before the specified time, I arrive at the restaurant. The host personnel were all busy chit-chatting among themselves or were on their personal phones texting and no one even bothered to acknowledge us. When I was finally noticed and told them I had a reservation, this is exactly what the hostess said ""since your reservation is for 6:30, and your 10 minutes early you'll have to wait"". Who would hire someone that talks like that to a customer. The whole time a male manager was leaning over the hostess box flirting with the hostess. When I was finally taken to our table, the tables that were pushed together were all out of line with dirty silverware and napkins on the ground were guests would be seating. And mind you, the place WAS NOT BUSY!  Obviously. Management change would be wise since it's the top down that is lacking in any sort of customer service skills. And, I'm sorry to say that this was not the only incidence of this type of thing. Out of the four times I've been to this locations, two have been just like this. If you want a crap shoot - this may be your kinda place."
Laura V.,"Long Beach, CA",56,221,,2.0,2/15/2008,"ok, maybe i am a little biased because i am vegan and not 21.  still, i have no mercy for places that leave me with ONE VEGAN OPTION.  yeah, the angel hair pasta with no dairy is alright, i guess.  but for $10?  i'm still wondering if the fries are vegan... they look like they are super battered up.  get with the times, BJ's, and appeal to tha fuckin' masses.  or at least serve me a beer.  jesus christ."
