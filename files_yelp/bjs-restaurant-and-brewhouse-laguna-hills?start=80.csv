Nakisha M.,"Inglewood, CA",40,11,98,5.0,6/12/2017,"I been going here since early 2000's I fell in love with a drink like that, which is the name of the drink. It's a good mix if you wanna feel good, i have tried several things on the menu. They have all kinds of American food, they food is not greasy, it's seasoned well and they have healthy selections if your watching what you eat. I have been to several different locations all over CA and every locations has nice, professional staff. It's a great atmosphere and it's always crowded in the afternoon. But they still won't take long to serve you after you have a sit. I love this spot and will continue to go there. I have never had a bad experience there and it's at the top of my list of one of my favorite places to eat."
Barbara S.,"Mission Viejo, CA",39,226,2,4.0,5/27/2017,"Thursday night is a must. Salad, slabof ribs, 2 sides and a mini pizzookie.   Less than $20.00.  Loved it."
Ericka C.,"Colton, CA",41,1,,5.0,7/22/2017,"I love Bj's, but I've never experienced such awesome customer service as this Bj's in Irvine.  Our waitress, Jennifer A. was AMAZING!!! Very friendly, very welcoming, great with kids.  Great people skills.  Plus, The food is always great. Top notch for sure!!!! Highly recommended. Thank you so much Jennifer"
Scott G.,"Lake Forest, CA",49,1,,3.0,4/2/2017,"Used to have a pretty good burger - grilled to your liking on a big bun.  Had one today which was clearly fried and extremely greasy - even the bun was greasy (and too small for the patty). Had to ask for onions and mustard. I won't be ordering that again.  The service was good, though."
Kristy G.,"Midway City, CA",168,3,,3.0,7/19/2017,This location has gone downhill as of recent in their customer service. Pick up service is a joke now. Orders done incorrectly and not ready to pick up when showing up well after promised time. The woman next to me was waiting for her pick up order only to be shorted an entree and having to wait even longer. Many of us are on an allotted time constraint for lunch breaks which is why we call orders in to be ready.
Chris R.,"Beverly Hills, CA",663,90,37,3.0,12/24/2016,"Looking for an iced cold beer and some thick crust Chicago style pizza? This may be your place. The place has it down- you are usually seated in under 15 minutes and they have a bar area as well.  My favorite salad here is a chopped Italian salad. I don't typically eat pizza but I would here- I've had bites of friends meals and it's pretty good.  For dessert, they are known for their pizzoki chocolate chip cookie pie, topped with a dollop of vanilla ice cream.  This is in my opinion the Applebee's of pizza spots so be ready for food to be fair and not knock your socks off. That's the only reason for the lower review."
Lauren F.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,4,2.0,10/19/2017,"The past few visits I've had, have been disappointing. Two of the three times in the past few months I've seen staff walking around texting with phones up to their faces as they walk through the restaurant. This makes me think they are too busy to be doing their jobs properly. Tonight I placed a pick up order and Courtney who answered the phone wasn't the most pleasant. When my boyfriend went to pick up the order, she was also snappy with him. What seemed to be an employee in training apologized for her behavior which was appreciated. The only reason this isn't 1 star is because we like the food. Hopefully this location can get it together!"
Christopher F.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",26,3,,3.0,7/16/2017,This was my first visit. I found the food to he good. But the restaurant  was dirty. The floors  were slimy and slippery. The lights were very dirty  I kept waiting for the dirt to fall off them. The servers seemed to be almost rude. Overall not shure if I would return.
Andrew M.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,1,,1.0,7/23/2017,"Good food, very poor service.  Waited over 20 to get more water when my food arrived. By that time most of my food was cold.  I use to like Bj's but the service is poor places can have the best food but that can't make up for poor service."
janie d.,"Laguna Hills, CA",0,16,,1.0,9/30/2017,"Ordered 1 item to go said it would take 15 min. I got there in 15, had to wait 1/2 hr. I live around the block 3 min tops Got home, food was completely cold and part of my entree was missing. I don't tip on to go orders until after I get my order so if the girl stalled my order for that reason, she cheated herself. For $23 I should have had my full order & at least be lukewarm."
Mary C.,"San Juan Capistrano, CA",0,18,,2.0,6/16/2017,"Ordered prime rib tonight. I ordered med rare husband ordered rare. They came out exactly the same. They were both medium. I think at $26.95 you should get what you ask for. Asparagus was like rubber, so way over done couldn't eat it. Dessert was horrible. I had their famous. Mine was salt and Carmel cookie with ice cream. The cookie was so hard I couldn't even eat it. I left it. The waitress saw I didn't eat it but said nothing. I totally understand it's not anywhere near high end dining but they can do better."
Gerrie R.,"Laguna Woods, CA",0,1,,3.0,9/14/2017,I often come here to eat. When it's very busy I go to the bar area. The food is always excellent- but once in awhile I get a waiter:waitress that doesn't seem suited to serve the public. Today was one of those occasions. I was at BJs on the off time the place was almost empty. I waited for 15 min before anyone came to wait on me. The people next to me said they had waited a half hour before they got their waitress. Not only was the gal tardy she didn't seem to care about my order. There was a food deliver person named Skylar that noticed my ice tea was empty when she served my meal. She brought me a refill. That's someone who should be waiting on the public.
Sandra M.,"Los Angeles, CA",11,202,7,1.0,4/22/2017,We went for a few beers yesterday and had the worst service ever. Nobody was hungry so we just asked for avocado and chips. It took 40 minutes to get it after asking 3x for our food. After drinking a few beers we started to get hungry so we ordered 3 pizzas. That took ovee 30 minutes. Yikes! The waiter gave us 1 home salad for waiting so long. Really a salad? Also the few times he did pass by our table he never took the empty beers and glasses. Dude really. Worst service ever.
Alexis S.,"San Juan Capistrano, CA",1,31,28,2.0,6/1/2017,"Horrible service!! Apparently my server, Shane P, is having an awful night! Sat in the bar only to be greeted by Shane who carried aggression through his body language not to mention his language in general. As we were sitting waiting for our pizookie, we couldn't help but over hear him speaking to another server through the use of several f bombs. Throughout the entire service, he was rushing us and had the worst attitude never smiled once. Once he dropped off our pizookie, he placed it at the edge of the table and walked away without saying a word. Before able to take a bite, he came back with the check, failing to ask if we potentially wanted anything else. Extremely disappointed with his vulgar service."
Victor U.,"Santa Ana, CA",23,90,13,5.0,5/14/2017,Came here with the family for Mother's Day. Service was great and the pizza was outstanding. Best deep dish pizza I have eaten in a long time.
Angelena G.,"Orange County, CA",42,79,43,4.0,2/4/2016,"I really enjoy the enLIGHTened menu here. Full flavor meals that don't disappoint. The barbacoa chicken is my favorite entree, so far. And it's consistently delicious across many visits. The burgers are crazy good. I don't even like bleu cheese but that black and bleu burger is ridiculous. The beer selection is great, comes out fast and cold. The service is always good. Attentive, knowledgeable about the menu, and they don't seem to mind my little substitutions."
Victoria M.,"San Juan Capistrano, CA",60,21,6,3.0,3/3/2017,Not impressed with food but great service and nice beer selection. Good ambiance if with a group of friends. Not a date spot or really kid friendly
Aaron E.,"Orange County, CA",94,1429,2127,2.0,12/1/2015,"Poor taste passed off as gourmet. It is a chain you have been to and you didn't care for it either. Sticky booths, screaming suburbanites and far too many senior citizens thanks to nearby Seizure World. All of that plus a terrible deep dish. I tried the Buffalo Chicken variety and you are 100% correct, I deserve what I got.  The pie is all dough and no go. Dry and wood-tasting chicken breast chunks are combined with diced celery, red onions with a sloppy drizzle of ranch dressing, buffalo sauce and... well, that is the good part! The bad part is the 3/4 inch of too soft, almost mealy, doughy crust these things have going on. If this is an attempt at Chi-Town pie, BJ needs to actually go to Chicago some day because this is a disgusting attempt at a deep dish.  Bleh.  This pizza stings like a first divorce, or that first Newport... Whichever hurts more."
Ashley A.,"Lake Forest, CA",0,4,,1.0,8/29/2016,"I have eaten at BJ's many times and never had a problem. I was there last Sunday and the waitress was very short and rude. My dip dish pizza was under cook and gooey. And when I asked for something to replace it, she gave me an odd look   I was completely sad if that dissatisfied and angry I just sent my dish back and paid for my drinks. Not very happy with the service"
Araceli H.,"Los Angeles, CA",168,10,,1.0,4/28/2017,Ehhh... that's all I have for this place. Service was ehhh. Food was gross I had to order something else. Overall I would have to be drunk In order to visit this location.
