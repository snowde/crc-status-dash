Taylor D.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,19,14,4.0,11/25/2017,"called the night before to set up a reservation. get there for our time and said our reservation was a ""call ahead"" even though the night before was told ""reservation confirmed"". we waiting about 20 mins to be seated.  anyways the food, ordered a medium pepperoni pizza and two medium cheeseburger pizzas for the 9 of us. probably only had a couple slices of the pepperoni for us. cheeseburger pizza is NOT on the menu anymore, but they still make it if you request it. i highly recommend the cheeseburger pizza if you are into burgers and pizzas. the pizookies, very very yummy: recommend the regular chocolate chip as well as peanut butter.  my boyfriend has celiac so he was able to enjoy the gluten free pizza (which may i add, is also delicious) and the gluten free chocolate chip pizookie (also very delicious) i'd eat both!"
Loren R.,"Anchorage, AK",10,242,262,3.0,12/18/2017,Hmmmmm I wish I had taken a picture of the fish tacos I ordered.  They were really vegetable tacos.   I had to dig deep to find the insignificant piece of fish at the bottom.  It was the smallest portion of fish I've  EVER had in a fish taco.  To add to that....  it was the least inventive boring fish taco I've ever had. And I eat a lot of em on my travels.  NOT. The bj standard for sure  Salmon was good Salad was good Beer was good  Server forgot a beer.  No biggie.  Not the usual  5 star experience I'm  used to here  ------ Note.  I was at the Henderson location yesterday.  5 star experience Had pizza and beer
Reed B.,"Orlando, FL",22,162,55,5.0,11/18/2017,"BJ's is one of those places that you go when you want something dependable, somewhat tasty and with something for everyone in your party.  This BJs hits all of those marks, AND manages to be the best one of the chain that I have been to.   Here's what put it over the top compared to its brethren.  - Quick service.   I have never had my food out that quickly in a busy restaurant.  And everything was cooked correctly!   - Awesome service!  Our waitress was extremely personable and professional.   My personal favorite item is the chicken pita tacos, but the burgers are great as well!  Pizza is actually my least favorite item but is also still quite yummy.  A pizzokie  is a required desert item."
Karen W.,"North Las Vegas, NV",9,74,81,4.0,12/6/2017,"I have been here a few times, but my favorite location is Centennial Pkwy!!  My friend and I had pizzas since they were half priced., and happy hour!  This location (Charleston) doesn't feel as cozy as Centennial.The food was great.  BJ's in general is a great place to eat!  I have had a lot of items on the menu, I have never been disappointed.  Shout out to our waitress ""Franky""..she was great!"
Paul W.,"Las Vegas, NV",340,898,440,4.0,11/6/2017,"Always a solid option!  You looking for this and that?  BJ's provides a little bit of this and a little of that for whatever you are looking for.  I have been coming here pretty much since it opened.  Never a negative experience.  From the service to the constant evolving menu, you can find your favorites and new additions to boot. I am a true fan!  The difference is split between this location and another in the immediate are.  It would seem....I always choose this location.  The parking is in not F$%^@! up and the quality is solid! Enjoy!"
Tiffany Z.,"Las Vegas, NV",1358,228,1847,5.0,7/5/2017,"Another solid meal at BJs. Wait was usual, about 20 mins.  Our server was on top of everything from our extra napkins request, side of this or that, to keeping our drinks refilled. Food was cooked perfect.  Our waitress  Kaitlyn was friendly and service was great! Definitely recommend. Enjoy!! :)"
Jenna T.,"Las Vegas, NV",167,74,120,4.0,5/17/2017,"Great place for good food. From pizza to to burgers you can't go wrong. Bj's is that kind of restaurant were you know 99% of the time your food will come out looking and tasting amazing. Weekly specials* Any weekday you come in they offer a daily special including; 1/2 off pizza on Mondays, $3 pizookies on Tuesdays, $10 burgers on Wednesdays and rib deals on Thursdays.  Rewards program* Every time you enjoy a meal you will collect points for every dollar spent. Rewards include free pizookies, and discounted meals. The more points you rack up the bigger the deals. They also email you specials including free appetizers and restaurant specials. Weekdays are typically slow and weekends you will find there's usually a wait. Today they had an off day but sometimes that happens. We had a few issues with missing items on our meals but a manager came out to reinsure they were fixing my meal to the appropriate standards. Whenever we've run into any issues with food, a manager has always came out and talk to us. It's a nice gesture showing acknowledgement that they messed up and the problem is getting fixed. I come here for the food but the customer service is always extra great!"
Tamara M.,"Blue Springs, MO",6,52,94,4.0,12/10/2017,Great menu food soup was cold .. They have us another the strawberry martini is to die for lots of liquor lol
Barbara P.,"Honolulu, HI",30,100,131,4.0,5/3/2017,"I've never be disappointed in anything I've had here.  I had the Prime Rib French dip...very good!  It had the perfect amount of meat, melted Swiss cheese, great Au jus...French fries w/n ice tea...perfect! Hubby had the fried chicken w/mashed potatoes, lots n lots of flavor.  Of course, he enjoyed the test tasting of different beers.   We've never been disappointed, whenever we come here.  They're pretty consistent so, we know we'll enjoy our meals, always. Our waiter, Scotty, was great!  He was funny, pretty knowledgeable about the menu and drinks.  He suggested the beer and food, he was right...fabulous!"
Meagan B.,"Costa Mesa, CA",0,5,1,1.0,11/25/2017,The worst experience ever. First one of the pizzas was made incorrectly then my brother's pizza ended up having a piece of metal in it... never coming back here ever again
Scott J.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,19,2,4.0,11/24/2017,"Great service and now prime rib!  This was a fantastic dinner that I was not expecting.  First time having more than lunch, service from Kyle was excellent you must try his expertise as he sold this dinner."
Marc F.,"Chicago, IL",505,113,1106,3.0,12/28/2017,"They brew their own Root Beer, cream soda and other soft drinks. I get my sugar fix every time.  This place has one of the biggest menus there is. So many sides too.  something here for everyone. The food is good, Pizza not so much.  So you can't figure out where to go"" just go to bj's"" it's that place. :)"
Sarah A.,"Southwest, Las Vegas, NV",130,141,274,4.0,10/11/2016,"Came here for a birthday dinner on a Monday night. It wasn't too terribly packed but BJ's is always poppin no matter what time you come in.  My bf and I were greeted as soon as we came in & directed to our party. There were 11 of us at the table and were seated all the way to the right of the restaurant. Since it was happy hour, the bf ordered bone in chicken wings (buffalo something & garlic parm) with fries & I ordered the Alfredo pasta with shrimp instead of chicken. The wings were pretty good, we should've ordered it extra crispy or something. I prefer my wings with more of a crunch. The garlic parm was a little too saucy for me but the bf enjoyed both flavors. The thin cut fries are always a good choice! My pasta was super good! The portion was huge so I could only eat half & saved the other half for lunch the next day. I shared a salted caramel pizookie with a friend and maaaan, it was delicious! I loved the entire meal.  Service was okay. It actually wasn't great. I'm not sure if it was cos we had a large party or what. The guy hardly ever came around to our table. I asked for a refill for my water & never got one. He just didn't seem like he wanted to serve our table, honestly. So deducted one star for service."
Elleyne M.,"Las Vegas, NV",52,131,143,5.0,6/11/2017,"BJ's offers delicious eats, a family friendly environment, and courteous service! Our server was very accommodating and we had appetizing meals including buffalo chicken grilled cheese and fish and chips. We loved that the kid's meal side of fruit came with grapes cut in half. This is an extra step, and our kids only eat grapes this way. We will certainly be back, well done BJ's!"
Nicole T.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,9,,1.0,12/8/2017,Every BJ's employee we have encountered this evening has made us feel as if we were putting them out. From the receptionist (Hailey?) who was curt and not friendly when we called for seat-ahead to the waitress who was not happy when we asked to order beers from the happy hour menu - which we were seated in time for. We are not rude or demanding but but we sure felt disrespected.
George C.,"Sandy, Salt Lake City, UT",6,94,108,4.0,4/24/2017,"Right off the bat I was a little disappointed that BJ'a Brewhouse no longer has my favorite Imperial Stout beer. I love in Utah, one of the most alcohol repressed states in the country (although getting way better) and I told everyone how good it was who asked me where to go in Las Vegas. They have a new Tatonka Stout. It's good but not as good.  Our server Woody was excellent. Great personality and he really interacted well with us and the customers he waited on.  Today's feast started with the BJ's HopStorm IPA and an appetizer of BJ's Brewhouse blond beer battered asparagus.  The IPA was good with a light hoppy flavor.  The asparagus stalks were too wide and over cooked. I won't order that again. The country fried chicken was very good and the mashed potatoes was the best I have had. I don't know what they did to the potatoes but it worked well with the chicken. Although I was a bit bummed out that they nixed my favorite beer I look forward to coming back for another meal."
Poco P.,"Las Vegas, NV",1616,372,2558,4.0,8/11/2016,"Deep Dish Pizza .. BJ's Classic is my usual.  The first time I tried this was on Eastern & since then I've only been able to order this lol!  You know when you know what you want, but still you look at the menu?   Love love love this pizza & it melts in your mouth.  Preferably, I sit in a bar booth, but have sat at the bar once & in the restaurant.  Always had good service & when I didn't once the person told me he was new, which I can appreciate."
Debi R.,"Irvine, CA",299,156,57,5.0,3/20/2017,"Our soccer team was in town for a college showcase and BJ's was closest to the hotel the girls were staying.  I spoke with Donna (Manager) and arranged a pizza, pasta, salad buffet for the players and their families.  She emailed me the contract and just like that, we were all set.  When we arrived at BJ's for our dinner, I was surprised to find out that they don't start preparing the food until we get there.  I was a tad bit panicked because the girls had tickets to see the UCLA game, and dinner was already going to be rushed. Not to worry. We were seated and they already had the salad out! The girls quickly pounced on that. Before they were finished, the pizza and pasta started making their way out. Perfection!  We had plenty of time to spare.  But wait!  Better get the pizookies started, so the girls can have them right after dinner! Where is the server?!? Oh? He got the pizookies started already??? Phew! I've never been to a buffet where things ran so smoothly. I thought there would be a problem with the check...as there always is with a large group. Nope!  The check was correct to the penny!  We will definitely choose this BJ's again when we are in town!   Thank you Donna, Ron and your staff for making our dinner so seamless. We will definitely be back!"
Ronen S.,"Redondo Beach, CA",62,3,,1.0,8/11/2017,"If I could give negative stars I would. Awful service. 20 minutes to get drinks, only then did she take our food order. Another 30 minutes to get food. Got some orders wrong. Appetizers arrived after the food: we had 2 littlest kids with us and they got their food last. They orders Mac and cheese. That was kraft mad and cheese clearly. It take 5 minutes to make. Why did they get it last? Asked to see the manager, never arrived, and we waited another 30 minutes for that miracle to happen.  Awful. Won't be caught in this place again even if they pay me. This is embarrassing for their brand, and really, for any restaurant.  Not even an apology from that. Yeah... no."
C W.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,7,4,4.0,12/29/2017,"What I love about the BJ's chain of restaurants is the consistency - which is all good!  From the servers to the food, this place never disappoints!  Only reason for 4 stars- would love to of seen this location, and/or more add a nice outside patio area.  Otherwise they are the best!  Oh, and they never make you feel rushed so its incredibly conducive for conversation, weather its a first date, business lunch or birthday celebration!"
Billie B.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,1,,5.0,12/23/2017,"Came in for quick pizza and beer at the bar and we were served really fast (like unusually fast for BJS on Saturday night). Pizza was great as always. Never had a bad deep dish here. Really friendly bartender named Tiara. She was great, quick and knowledgeable."
Daniel A.,"Las Vegas, NV",20,98,251,5.0,2/17/2017,We ate here for lunch it was pretty busy being a holiday but the staff was still nice the service still great . The food was very good. I always have great experience eating at BJ's this was no exception
Vilma D.,"North Las Vegas, NV",140,73,100,4.0,7/18/2017,"Great place to meet up with friends.  The pros: Food is delicious. I especially love the mozzarella balls and tomatoes and the shrimp Peruvian quinoa salad.  And of course, their pozookie. WOW!  Location is right off the I-215! It's very easy to find.  Everyone was friendly and kind.  It took awhile for the waitress to get our order because they were very busy.  However, we didn't wait very long for our food.  The cons: If your are going here to have a quiet meal, you may as well leave now.  It is very noisy.  I could barely hear myself think. Lol.   Overall, I will continue to come here."
Neil K.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,59,54,4.0,6/12/2017,We had a large barbeque chicken pizza. 50% off on monday. Service was friendly. Beer was cold.
Danielle D.,"Las Vegas, NV",211,100,123,3.0,7/22/2017,"I'm usually happy with my meal and service at BJ's. However this time around I was quite disappointed with the SERVICE, the food was still great! Our server wasn't attentive to us or any of his tables. I started to notice he would just disappear and not check on his section as often as the other servers would check on their tables. It was worse when we ran out of water at our table and it took 5 minutes for him to approach our table and another 10 for him to loop back around to us to refill our waters. This wouldn't have been that bad if we hadn't watched him grab the water container, walk past us refill waters for another table and then just disappear again. I'm disappointed with the service, I haven't had an experience like this in a while and I sure hope BJ's can step up service."
Jessie H.,"Las Vegas, NV",13,13,5,4.0,10/10/2017,"My friends and I always end up going to BJ's if we don't know where to eat and I've never been disappointed yet! I always take the longest time to order here because they have such a great variety to choose from. Some dishes I've tried here is the Chicken Alfredo, the country fried chicken burger, and the ribeye. They are known for their ""pizookies"" which is their dessert. It's a warm, freshly baked cookie that is topped with icecream. Recently I came in and tried their Churro pizookie which is just a bunch of mini churros with a scoop of vanilla bean icecream on it but it was so good because the churros are fresh and warm (It's only offered for a limited time too)!!! Anyways, this place is a great place to go to if you are in a group and you don't really know what you are in the mood for."
Ryan C.,"Las Vegas, NV",105,52,40,3.0,3/1/2017,"Place was ok. The food wasn't all that great. Few things we ordered. Half rack ribs with mash potatoes and fries.  Stuff mushrooms Calamari  Ribeye steak with asparagus and mash potatoes  Ahi tuna and chips Pizza Pazookie ( chocolate cookie with ice cream) The service was great and towards the end of the meal the manager came to serve us, which I thought was weird but whatever. Overall I would only come back if I had too. I wouldn't personally pick this place if I wanted to go eat."
C.j. C.,"Tempe, AZ",117,10,,5.0,9/19/2017,"Had a great experience as usual. Our food came out so fast and thank goodness, because my pregnant sister was starving. Always a great experience. Excellent service. I ordered the barbecued chicken chopped salad it is amazing, always the perfect amount of dressing. A++"
Hal T.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,35,11,1.0,5/28/2017,Terrible.   Appetizers came long after entree.  Entree was not cooked.  Appetizers were overcooked.  Slow service from disorganized and frazzled waitress.  Only the beer was right. Manager never came around. Never again.  Avoid.
Hector H.,"Pomona, CA",54,6,,1.0,6/29/2017,"The food was good. The service however was completely horrendous. Glasses of water went empty, that's if you were lucky to get one. Food came out without the necessary condiments. Example: a baked potato with nothing in it. No butter, no sour cream, nothing. Just the potato. Meals came with dessert, that never arrived.  I've had bad service before, usually it's with new waiters so I am usually understanding. This guy just looked like he gave no shits about helping anyone. If you want good service, go somewhere else."
Ginny Q.,"Henderson, NV",0,31,5,3.0,7/4/2017,"My husband I came to Summerlin location on the 4th of July for early dinner. When we arrived it was slow, the hostess asked me to wait by the steps to be seated. The person who was sitting us had absolutely no urgency he was taking his time to grab the menus and utensil then finally we got seated next to a ditty table and it stayed dirty the entire time we were eating.  We always go to the Henderson location because to close to our house, but today we were on the other side of town and decided stop and have a quick dinner and it was disappointing experience.  Now our waiter was great and the food."
Jordan B.,"Las Vegas, NV",177,6,1,2.0,5/2/2017,"Understandably, my family and I were moved from the bar due to me not having my ID. However, unfortunately the hostess didn't smile when we were seated and my moms food came out inedibly salty, and the manager Ron never came out to apologize. The only saving grace was Keith our serverr, he was kind and polite.  Don't come to this BJs, service and food quality are falling off."
Dan V.,"Henderson, NV",0,15,,5.0,12/20/2017,Always love BJS. Great atmosphere and great food!!!
Kara Y.,"Kapaa, HI",0,3,,5.0,12/10/2017,"Frances made our night amazing!! Her passion for serving is unlike any I've ever seen! She genuinely cares about her guests and their experience at the restaurant, which is something I find so rare since most servers only care about money. She told me that she has been serving since the 90's but I think she should be doing a lot more! Her enthusiasm and passion should have her in a managerial position! Or at the very least her base pay should be raised. BJ's is blessed to have such an amazing employee! I would 10/10 request her every time!"
Kelley R.,"North Las Vegas, NV",28,5,1,4.0,7/28/2017,We enjoyed our visit today! Celebrated my daughters bday and grandkids like the food as well!!!  Good service and food was great! We will be back. Thank you
Daniel S.,"Henderson, NV",988,1138,6855,3.0,2/22/2016,"The neat thing about hiking is that after burning all those calories, there is the guilty free post-hike meal. After hiking on the UYE: Hike at the Potato Knoll, I joined up with Robert. W for a post hike meal at BJ's. It was a hop and a skip northeast on State Route 159.   At 11:20 am, the parking lot, which is at the northwest corner of Route 159/Charleston at Pavilion Center across from Red Rock Resort was nearly full. That is a good sign.    Robert. W and myself sat toward the back of the restaurant where they have the microbrewery. My first impression was olfactory. There was a delicious smell permeating the restaurant. And we chatted and chatted. But when we chatted we were looking at a table minus menus. Where was the server? It seemed like we had spent an equivalent amount of time hiking from the Route 159 parking lot to the Potato Knoll until our waitress came on the scene. She half-apologized stating that she just started. ""Humm,"" I thought to myself, ""what about the servers who had been passing us with no sign of acknowledgement?""     After the waitress handed us our menus, it was difficult making a decision. This is one of those restaurants that serve good breakfast and lunch. I was in a lunch mood. Decisions! Decisions! Should I go for the roast beef? The chicken club? The portobello Swiss? I finally decided on the crispy jalapeño burger. After a 4.5 mile hike, there was no guilt chowing down this 1,350 calorie burger. The waitress never hurried us, and let me take my time choosing the sandwich. Between the time of ordering til the food reached the table, the waitress handed us our drinks. Regardless that this is a restaurant and microbrewery, I went for a Pepsi.    The crispy jalapeño burger was delicious but not exceptional delicious like the Spicy Miso Burger I ate in Bachi Burger last Sunday. The thick burger was topped with the right ingredients: housemate guacamole, smoked bacon, pepper jack cheese, chipotle mayonnaise, red onions, tomatoes, and jalapeños. Equally as delicious as the crispy jalapeño burger was the potato wedges. This burger that is $11 and change includes either string fries or potato wedges. I favor potato wedges over string fries. These were tasty potato wedges. I felt that they could of filled the plate a bit more with the potato wedges.     BJ's was a good choice for the post-hike meal. Robert got to enjoy breakfast and I got to enjoy lunch. Based on this experience, I will Yelp out that BJ's serves good food but needs improvement in service. If I was alone, I would of walked out and reviewed it 2 stars."
Leslie M.,"Summerlin, Las Vegas, NV",584,333,421,5.0,2/18/2016,"Was running around all day and by 9pm I just wanted to have a beer and a little pub food.  I've had some BAD pub food last 3 restaurants!  I've ordered take out from BJs before but haven't sat at the bar. It wasn't crowded.  Tracy immediately came up and offered me a menu and asked about drinks.  I wasn't familiar with any of their beers so I got a few tastes and then decided.  Then I realized they had and did that.  (Thankfully before she poured the big glass... which turned out to be my favorite of the flights) I ordered guacamole and chips and I swear it hit the bar in front of me in 6 seconds.  Thin, fresh warms chips and great guac.  I nibbled on that.  Explored the massive menu.  Worked on my beer flight and decided i was still hungry.  Ordered fried artichoke.  Again... 60 seconds and piping hot.  Amazing. It was fairly slow so I noticed everyone was cleaning.  I don't mean just wiping down the bar I mean the stuff that a lot of grubby places don't do every day.   The experience was great.  Tracy was fast, friend, knowledgable.  I asked a lot of questions and she patiently answered and since I was alone she came by and chatted a bit when she wasn't totally busy.  (I even asked questions about the spoon hanging from the tap because I was curious and other kind of dumb things that interested me.) The whole experience was as good as it gets for just walking in and wanting to nosh and drink.  I love the pizza.  I'm going to have to go back and try something more substantial. Thanks Tracy!  You made it a very pleasant visit for me. (Manager... give the woman a raise!)"
Stephen L.,"Las Vegas, NV",77,5,,4.0,8/25/2017,The food was good as always. Our server Keisha was really nice. We had some minor issues with our order but they fixed it right away and offered us something to hold us out until our meal arrived.
Rae B.,"Las Vegas, NV",5,24,33,5.0,1/8/2017,"Probably one of my favorite places for lunch and dinner with the big, crazy family I have. Tips: Call ahead of time to put your name down on the call list and sign up for their loyalty program, you will not regret it.  I walked in at 8 PM and it was packed. Every single table was filled and there were at least 3 families ahead of mine, but we only waited for six minutes to be seated. It was awesome. Reminder: Call ahead of time.  The server I got was awesome. Juan was attentive towards myself and my family. He always refilled our waters before it hit the ""half-way"" line and always checked to make sure everything was going well.  The food was absolutely delicious. I never have any complaints about their food. The environment was also great. They have huge tv screens for sport fans like myself. I highly recommend this place to anyone!!!"
Big T.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,48,,5.0,5/22/2017,"Ordered the Prime Rib Dinner with the starter salad and also included a regular size Pizookie, gotta say it's a good sized piece of Prime Rib! Server Beni is a very well rounded and knowledgeable server, great in all areas and knows how to treat repeat customers!  Service and food overall was great on the Friday evening that we visited."
