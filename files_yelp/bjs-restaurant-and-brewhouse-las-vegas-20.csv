Carol K.,"Las Vegas, NV",242,855,3812,4.0,4/3/2012,"Our first experience here didn't go very well, the waitress spilled an entire tray of drinks on my husband, they offered him a free T-shirt!  We haven't been back since.  So when my husband decided to give it another try, I was a little hesitant.   We got a couple of appetizers, a flatbread pizza, which had fresh mozzarella cheese and sweet tomato sauce. Garnished with fresh basil and Parmesan cheese.  We also got the crispy fried artichokes.  It was lightly breaded artichoke hearts fried crisp and sprinkled with Parmesan cheese.  Both of these were very good. For an entree, I got a good old bacon burger, smoked applewood bacon, cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato and pickles, smothered with their special sauce.  It was juicy and very good.  I love bacon, so if I would change anything, I would add more bacon! Service this time was very good, I enjoyed the food, my husband was disappointed with his choice of entree, the old fashion pot roast.  He said it was truly ""old"" as in taste, he felt it was the left overs from the night before.   But the menu had some nice looking items, especially deserts that we might have to return for."
Marina S.,"Las Vegas, NV",37,36,22,5.0,11/6/2015,"Was in for an early dinner today.  Been awhile since we have been here. Very impressed with quality of food AND service we received. Got the loaded potato skins and Margherita pizza was very good. Whole family really enjoyed their meals. Best part was our server Jared B. extremely attentive, friendly and went above and beyond for us. In a service town like Vegas it's so nice when you get A1 service!"
Lisa H.,"Las Vegas, NV",213,199,78,2.0,11/10/2014,"Ate there last year for my son's birthday and had great food and service. This time we had the worst waiter imaginable who didn't even bring us silverware. Food and drinks were bad, service was bad, I was pissed that I paid $100 for this drool. Serious indigestion for ALL of us, including our 4 year old! Waiter wouldn't bother to take the time to look up my BJ's card, never refilled tea, forgot to order my son's food which left him sitting there watching us eat for 45 minutes! Ordered my daughter's food wrong as well. Overcharged us for meals and drinks. Barely spoke English and obviously couldn't write it either.  With so many more options now since Downtown Summerlin has opened one would think they would at least attempt to make an effort.  I'm very disappointed and it was reflected in the tip or lack thereof. Having been a waitress in the past, there are a few things I expect such as silverware.  I don't know why this place is packed or how it stays open. Perhaps everyone is parking there to eat at Olive Garden next door."
Jon N.,"Las Vegas, NV",26,47,22,1.0,4/26/2016,"Sat down @ 6:52   , ask waitress for 2 beers happy hour she looked at her phone said sorry it's 7:01.... I told her we were here but waiting till now.. She could not honor the happy hour price, I come her 2-3 times a week.. Just had catering done for work.. Not a happy camper.. We were here before 7:00. Management needs to look at this policy."
Lauren M.,"Las Vegas, NV",48,141,23,1.0,11/25/2015,"I used to love coming to bjs. I recently came here with my family and I'm not sure if our server was too busy but I had to ask him for a kids menu three times. Ok no big deal. We ordered appetizers. Waited waited, finally our main corse got there. I asked him where the appetizers went. Oh he forgot to ring them in. Uhm really ok. Then I got my balsamic chicken, my favorite. The chicken was horrible. It was rubbery and tasted disgusting. Worst chicken u have ever had. I will never go back here again. So many other restaurants that have better service and better food."
Rebecca G.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,2,,5.0,10/16/2016,"Our server, Brian, provided the best service we've ever had at a restaurant. He went above & beyond and was excellent!"
Steffen D.,"Summerlin, Las Vegas, NV",0,3,,3.0,9/22/2016,"As usual for this location, the service was good, but the food is slipping. We ordered the poke appetizer and it tasted fishy and ""off"".  We sent it back. I ordered the late nite burger and the cheese was not melted and the chili verde was lukewarm at best. I'm beginning to think the corporate overlords are ruining an otherwise good place, taking great ideas and doing them halfway. The beer is still good though.  That's brings it up to a 3"
Michelle N.,"West Allis, Milwaukee, WI",9,34,44,5.0,4/10/2015,We tried this spot because of a friend recommended it! We were very happy with the service and the food! This was out first visit- if we lived closer we'd definitely stop again!!!! The pizza was great and my husband loved his burger- all portions were very big which was nice.
Hailey C.,"Placentia, CA",10,41,32,5.0,10/18/2015,Sunday fun day Vegas.   Go Miami go.  Sunday's are looking brighter if they can pull out a string of wins.  Bjs.  Thank you for the good food and big screens.   And Patricia.  If your listening.  Thank you for the great service.
Alexander M.,"Las Vegas, NV",403,1023,2304,4.0,9/25/2014,"Always good times at BJ's! Brought a friend here that was visiting from out of town because for the people who live in Vegas we don't always want to deal with ""the strip"" just to get some good food! Although we missed the lunch specials that end at 3PM we were still pleased with this dining experience! When we walked in there was maybe about 10 people in there! Not busy at all! Happy hour was still in session and because they offer some really good $5 Mojitos I had to participate hehe! If you choose to do happy hour you must sit in the bar area and some of my personal favorites off the happy hour menu are the avocado rolls and the buffalo wings! We were a bit hungry so we still ordered off the regular menu as well! Calamari was a Very good! The Cherry Glazed salmon was a HIT! I recommend trying that if you are in the mood for fish and or watching calories because it's only 550 calories! Friend ordered the Brewhouse double burger with bacon and loved it! BJ's is known for their pazookie's and I personally like the red velvet one! Will be back soon!"
Ori B.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,9,4,3.0,12/13/2014,"good service, OK food, feels like another america food place...nothing special. Asked for a M burger and got well done. hate it when it happens."
Lydia N.,"Las Vegas, NV",214,209,535,4.0,4/9/2013,"BJ's is a great place to have some good food and a great dessert which is a pizookie.  If you have been in the Eastern location, then there isn't much of a difference in the Summerlin location.   Ratings:  Food: (4) Service (4) Location (5) Ambience/Atmosphere (3)  Overall (4) I ordered the Mahi-mahi tacos which consisted of two tacos, nachos and a dip.  I really really liked it a lot.  However, it needed a little more of the sauce to put in.  Brad T. ordered his favorite pizza the buffalo chicken.  Lastly, we ordered a white & chocolate pizooke.  As always it tasted amazing and chocolate-ly."
Nicole G.,"Las Vegas, NV",755,454,410,5.0,12/26/2011,"Came here again after the line was too long at the buffet at red rock. Ordered the AYCE soup and salad for 6.95. what a fantasic deal. There was choice of broccoli and cheese, clam chowder, tortilla soup and chicken noodle.  Brocoli and cheese is the cheesiest soup i""ve ever had, hands down. no joke. order it and youll see what i mean. The tortilla soup they do in this weird way but it works. They bring the chicken, and stuff in the soup bowl but with no sauce. they then at your table pour the sauce onto the dish which leaves the torilla chips in it super crunchy. its delicious. also, its a nice touch that they add avocado and a lime inside for a bit of a kick. The caesar salad is okay, nothing special. Its yummy but i ordered only one. Of the soups i ordered then both again.  For our daughter we order chicken tenders and fries. The chicken was actually a great portion. three large golden crispy tenders that came with two dipping sauces. ranch and honey mustard. the honey mustard was delious but the waitress said its bottled. FYI she says the only sauce they make fresh themselves is the vinegarette. The fries were pretty good. They are super thin but it just meant they got cold uber fast. no bueno. My daughter really liked them. The service was impeccable. Our waitress was named Brittney and she was one of the best waitesses Ive ever had. She made light conversation saying she had a one year old as well. She even asked if while we waited would Leilah like some oranges. She brought a little dish with them in it to keep her occupied while we waited. Awesome. Moms FTW!"
Chuck L.,"Hawthorne, CA",0,1,,3.0,10/2/2016,The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because our waiter was rude and arrogant. The food and drinks was 5 stars . Keith is rude and makes u feel uncomfortable. I asked for prices on some beer and he said oh I don't know I just press buttons its different through out the region. I wanted to get up and punch him in the face . At the end he was trying to be nice even though he was pretty rude almost the entire Time .
Jacob L.,"Centennial, Las Vegas, NV",1,24,3,5.0,9/17/2014,"Love this place! Menu is huge and can make everyone in your group happy. Gluten free menu is awesome! Sports always on the TVs.  Great wine, beer, and craft beer selection."
Vanessa A.,"Las Vegas, NV",259,670,174,3.0,10/23/2014,"I came twice for food and once for the root beer. They have a happy hour from 2-5 (double check that's the exact hours) It includes food and drinks. Menu for HH is limited but they have one. I got a growler when I was at beer fest, so I came here and for $8.00, you get a growler of fresh root beer. It was delicious, however, I wish it had a little more bubbles. The taste was spot on, but I like the fizzyness the bubbles bring."
Linda L.,"Las Vegas, NV",97,34,526,4.0,10/22/2014,"Service is good here. I always come for their appetizers!! My favorites are: avocado egg rolls, Spinach artichoke dip, mozzarella salad, stuffed mushrooms, Mac & cheese, and  fried calamari. They have an excellent selection of beers! My favorite is the Jeremiah red! Their pumpkin ale is a must try during the fall season!"
Suzi M.,"Henderson, NV",26,10,,1.0,9/4/2015,"My husband had a stroke which damaged his voice but otherwise you wouldn't know it by looking at him. Went to BJS on  eastern tonight for daughters birthday...waitress Nicole served us all one beer and appetizers,...after what was to be our second and last /only had had one /she arrived at the table and rudely and loudly announced we could have another but husband couldn't. Never asked if he possibly had drank too much! He was humiliated. Manager was just as rude as he said she wasn't rude(he never heard it) this was the most unprofessional manager in a restaurant, ever -way over his head and horrible people skills. Needless to say our night was  ruined no one offered any apologies. The waitress and manager shiwed total disrespect  and we will never return. Horrible horrible customer service ."
Denise K.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,5,,1.0,10/4/2014,"My husband and I went to BJ's yesterday to enjoy their lunch specials. I gave the hostess my BJ's rewards number as we checked in. My card was lost by a waiter on a previous visit. We were seated in a booth for two. A few minutes later, Nora, our waitress greeted us. She took our drink order and then our food order. I ordered the half sandwich and salad combination with the salad dressing on the side. My husband ordered the same thing except for no tomatoes on his salad. A few minutes later drinks and salads were brought out. My salad had salad dressing on it and my husbands salad had tomatoes on it. Strike one and two. No big deal, we will eat them rather than risk the rest of our food being spit in. Thirty minutes went by. No half sandwiches had been delivered. My husband was ready to get up and leave when Nora goes around, sees that we have not been served  our food and runs away before we can get her attention. She comes back a few minutes later with our food. My fries were cold and the sandwich was soggy on one side and crusty on the other side. It was obvious that our food had sat under the heat lamps for a long time. My husbands food was the exact same way. Nora, our waitress, was no where to be found, so we asked another server to get the manager.  Nora finally came over and went to get her manager. William M, one of the managers, came over to apologize for our food being cold and unsatisfactory. He offered us to remake our food at no cost. We did not have time to waste another 30 minutes for our food to be remade. He said he was going to talk to his staff about the quality of food that is served. Nora knew full well that the food she was serving us wasn't the BJ's quality standards that the manager was talking about. We go back to BJ's because we really like the food. This wasn't the first time our food was served cold or our order was lost or my rewards card was lost. For those reasons, we Will NOT be going back to BJ's. We have given this enough chances to this restraurant. We will take our business else where."
David M.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,121,201,5.0,3/7/2015,"Great first class service when you sign up for a BJs card at the check in desk.  I checked in tonight with the hostess and gave her my phone number associated with my BJ card, and we were escorted right away to our table. There were around 20 other people still waiting in the lobby area for a table.  The servers and manager gave us exceptional service, and catered to our special requests. The pan pizza we ordered tonight from their new pizza menu was wonderful.  This is a great place to go with family and friends for any occasion. The location is easy to access off the 215 freeway and the Charleston exit. ""One customer, well taken care of, could be more valuable than $10,000 worth of advertising."" -- Jim Rohn"
