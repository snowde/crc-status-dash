Kayte F.,"Centennial, Las Vegas, NV",386,27,30,3.0,1/21/2017,"Love the place but they always take forever when it comes to taking orders and bringing our food out, they actually forgot to bring my food out so I had to wait 15 mins after they brought everyone's food out... server was never around we'd always had to ask to refill our drinks."
Geselle R.,"Henderson, NV",907,392,4626,4.0,10/28/2014,"This BJ's never seems to disappoint me. Today we were there for lunch and the waiter was so nice! Our food also came out very quickly today. I was surprised! I got the half pasta and soup or salad lunch combo. I ordered the spicy tomato spaghetti and a bowl of clam chowder. Reason why I got soup was because the last time I had the house salad, I didn't really like it. It didn't have enough dressing, it seemed a little dry. The spaghetti was really not that spicy but had a light kick and a different type of tomato sauce, but it was enjoyable. It was really good price, about $9! My boyfriend got the clam chowder in a bread bowl which was about $8. Their clam chowder is really good! It comes out hot and fresh. He adds a little tobasco for more flavor, and I just like it the way it is. We had calamari for appetizer and it was delicious as well. It was crispy and a pretty decent size. I've seen it bigger at other places but I'm not complaining. This was about $10.25 I believe.  As for dessert, ALWAYS the pizookie! Chocolate chip with vanilla ice cream is always the traditional way to go! Sooo yummy and always hits the spot. Because I'm a BJs card holder, I was able to get $10 off $35 or more, and we had just reached $36. So the deal was soooo good! Imagine if I had 4 people come and everyone ordered off the lunch menu.... What a deal!! This place is clean and friendly and has pretty good food. I've had their Cajun pasta and shrimp scampi, both very flavorful. I've also had the angel hair Classico which is not as flavorful but good if you don't want a strong flavored pasta. Their pizzas are yummy and shareable size! Over all, BJs is one of my favorite places to go!"
Tracey B.,"Las Vegas, NV",11,47,21,4.0,1/18/2017,I have been to BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse many times this location is my favorite. Food is wonderful has a very wide spread selection to choose from. The beer they brew is awesome very tasty love that they give sample flights to taste from in decent size glasses. I was a bit shocked when I found out that they don't offer growlers ( take home beer ) for taking your beer home. They only have growlers for their sodas I hope this will change. The beer dinners are very fun and educational you get to sample different beers not just the beer they brew. The beer dinners often have decorations and good dinner that includes appetizer and desert from their menu. Staff and customer service has always been good and wait time can vary based on the time you get their.

Carl P.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,59,40,5.0,1/21/2017,"Excellent food, restaurant is clean and service was great. We would highly recommend this place to all in Vegas."
X-tina L.,"Honolulu, HI",10,28,,4.0,11/13/2016,"The service was good however we came here because the pizza was supposed to be amazing and it was good if you like 20$ bread sticks. Lets just say we wont be going back for ""pizza"""
Bunny G.,"The Woodlands, TX",840,1160,3986,4.0,5/31/2014,"Redemption!  We stopped in for lunch which I recommend since there are less crowds compared to dinner time and it's easier to find a parking spot-which is only one reason I've stayed away. However, on this visit we were greeted by a friendly hostess and seated right away. The loud music and TVs are expected and this way you don't have to listen anyone else's conversation but your own. Our waiter was friendly and we ordered up a draft beer and and spicy egg rolls and wow what a presentation! Flavors were all there and this was the perfect starter dish. We split the California burger which was loaded with avocado. We ordered it medium and it was a bit undercooked. The bread was sourdough but they used a sliced version which for me on a burger was a let down since I was expecting a bun.  Nonetheless the burger and side of stringy fries was delicious. Overall high return factor."
Bobby Y.,"Las Vegas, NV",571,355,42,4.0,5/20/2015,"Wow BJ's is better - *way* better than I remember. And their happy hour is pretty ridiculously good, too. You're even allowed to add up to 8-9 toppings to a happy hour personal pizza ($6-ish) or pick a specialty pizza to represent your pick. What a deal! Super attentive service. Makes you want to invest in a franchise, but all of these are corporate-owned, just like Panda Express is. That must the secret to consistency and stellar, no-excuses service! Our drinks (iced tea, beer and more beer) were never down to a 1/3rd of a glass. :) It's no wonder this is many people's ""favorite restaurant"" when asked to state one. I certainly wouldn't want to be the Olive Garden next door (which does well, too) or any other establishment sharing the same parking lot. If you haven't tried BJ's in a long time, go. Certainly go instead of to Grimaldi's or to the Cheesecake Factory or even to Dom DeMarco's pizzeria for that matter. It's just so spot on it's hard not to compare. Everything that comes out of their kitchen is super solid, and they won't hesitate to make things right if they're not!"
Peaches D.,"Las Vegas, NV",298,147,353,3.0,6/30/2014,"Ate here for dinner today and for some reason it was super busy. I really love this restaurant and have been coming here for a long time. I love the ambiance and the food is great. I love their signature pizookie's and their rootbeer.  Our waitress was not at all coordinated. She was in over her head I think because it was so busy. It took 15 minutes after we were seated for her to come by and ask what we would like to drink. Then it took another 20 minutes for her to actually come back to give us our drinks. This made me mad since I've never had such poor service at this restaurant before.  We ordered 2 appetizers which came out literally 5 minutes before we were served out entrees. On top of that our waitress was not really attentive to us and was kind of rude when we asked for sauces and other things.  Overall, I still love this restaurant, but I believe that if they do become busy the waitress/waiters should not neglect their tables and not be snippy if ketchup or other things are needed."
Tina L.,"Las Vegas, NV",93,17,,5.0,10/3/2016,Recently came to BJ's for the first time. The host was so friendly and made conversation with us on the way to our table. Our waitress was awesome & very helpful; you could tell she knew the menu well & was familiar with everything. She even informed us about signing up for the BJ's Reward's program & then getting a free Mini Pizookie! I went to the BJ's in Henderson the next week & was not disappointed there either! One of my new favorite spots.
Vanessa W.,"Timberlake Street, Las Vegas, NV",76,13,2,5.0,1/12/2017,"Here with a large group and let me say that these stars are earned from our server Jake! He's super incredible and courteous. Thanks, Jake!! Oh, the food is good, the drinks are good, and I'm sure the other servers are cool too"
Kevin C.,"Seattle, WA",35,26,,4.0,12/21/2016,"Nathan is legit the best server in the world. Typical bar/restaurant atmosphere, solid American food."
Jessica C.,"Las Vegas, NV",1075,275,379,4.0,5/27/2015,"So you walk in and see this huge beautiful restaurant. Sadly we didn't know we were going here tonight so I wore pajama pants. It's not too fancy but nice for a not too pricy dinner as well.  We got seated and ordered our drinks. The first 2, maybe 3 pages were nothing but beers or wines. When the food came it was literally so hard to decide. Such a big menu and so many things that sound really good. I couldn't decide for a while. I got the sirloin steak, an appetizer (fries), and my steak sides were mashed potatoes and clam chowder. The fries were really good, the steak was smaller than the portioning of mashed potatoes (I'm actually being serious I've seen a french fry that was better than the steak), the chowder was hands down the best. Service was amazing and I'm honestly very impressed from this place. Even though the steak was very small, I still got realy full to where I couldn't finish it."
Yellow D.,"New Haven, CT",0,56,14,5.0,7/8/2016,"Interesting place directly across the street from the Red Rock casino. We like to avoid eating in casinos are hotels when  possible as the quality and the pricing usually isn't good so we sought this place out and we weren't disappointed. we ate there twice in the last two days. Beer and appetizers were great as was the food, it has a pleasant atmosphere highly recommend."
Shawn J.,"Henderson, NV",450,792,202,1.0,4/23/2015,"There are hundreds of place one can go in Las Vegas and have lunch in under an hour. This BJ's location is not one of them. When it takes 13 minutes to order a Coke or iced tea, then after another 15 minutes nobody has bothered to even stop by and ask if you wanted to order anything to actually eat, that's a problem. It shows that the staff and management is not in tune with their customer's needs, and after 35 minutes of only seeing one server at our table I got up and left.  Thankfully there was a Taco Bell down the street that even with 7 cars stacked up in the drive through was able to get me in and out in under 10 minutes. I took someone out for lunch intending to give them a nice change from their lunch routine but the inattentive staff at this BJ's location ruined that idea.  1 Star. There's really no excuse for this kind of stupidity by the management team."
Nancy C.,"Las Vegas, NV",82,69,109,1.0,5/8/2017,"So, I walked in with my elderly mother who I'm helping carry her Oxgyen tank. The hostess greeted us I said my father is already here she said he is over there. Now mine you when you walk in from the bright sun light it's dark inside bjs I said to her I can't see where? She was to lazy to move out from behind the counter to take me to my father!!! Than a waitress walked by heard me and she was kind enough to walk us over like wow!!! So I sat down I didn't know my dad ordered his ice tea we where sitting at the table for at lease 4 minutes which isn't long. But a waitress came up to the table and ask if we had been help I said no we haven't with her smart comment said than why is there napkins on your table? I couldn't believe she was so nasty!!! I said I haven't ordered she walked away started talking and laughing at our table. Which was so rude!!! I asked to speak with a manager and never showed at our table!!!"
Jillian P.,"Las Vegas, NV",134,259,945,5.0,7/15/2014,"Although there is usually a wait if you go during the peek times and days, it's worth it.  I usually get their amazing honey crisp chop chicken salad and it is always consistently made, no surprises. That goes with their whole menu. Obviously their pizza is made to perfection, that's a given. So someone at the table has to order a pizza! But please, for the love of god, SAVE ROOM FOR A PIZZOOKIE!!! What's that, you ask? It's a hot giant cookie, still warm in its mini pizza pan, with a heaping scoop of ice cream on top, just waiting to be devoured! You can say you'll only have one bite, but you would be lying. I double-dare you to only have one bite. When a table gets a Pizzookie, it's like watching a pack of starving wolves being thrown a juicy steak. First come, first serve!"
Robert R.,"Summerlin, Las Vegas, NV",100,1,,5.0,7/26/2017,"Phenomenal customer service, i ordered a shrimp pasta lunch plate and at the time of delivery i got no shrimp when i realized it i told the waitress who apologized (which wasnt needed because the chef messed up) and told us shed bring us some shrimp. 3 minutes later the manager comes by and tells me that that plate was on the house and apologized for the minor food setback. The waitress was awesome i unfortunately do not recall her name."
Phil S.,"Las Vegas, NV",58,51,,4.0,6/1/2016,"I've been enjoying BJ's Summerlin since I first moved here back in 2006.  They're pretty quick with their service and they always get my order right unlike some other places that seem to forget little details.  When I say no l don't want lettuce on my sandwich, they don't put any on it!  When I ask for condiments on the side, they'll put them on the side! My favorite item to order there is their California Chicken Sandwich.  I'm not a huge fan of avocado, but the combination of avocado with green chiles and the juiciness of the chicken is just out of this world! Of course, you can't talk about BJ's without mentioning the Pizzookie!  I can't tell you how many of these I've tried, but it's a lot!  They're just the most delectable dessert in the world!  I cannot stress how good they are! Best time to go is definitely a little before the lunch rush around 11:30-11:45 AM or later evenings after 7:00 PM."
Annemarie K.,"Summerlin, Las Vegas, NV",136,378,511,3.0,4/27/2016,"I have been here a few times and I would have to say that overall my experiences have been good. The service is normally fast and friendly. They have a menu with a wide variety of cuisine. There is a wide variety of beers available and a good specialty mixed drink selection. I would have to say that the food at times is hit or miss. I tried to deep dish pizza, and it was soggy in the middle. A few more minutes in the oven would have done it more justice."
