Tony H.,"Las Vegas, NV",41,257,38,4.0,9/23/2016,"Good eats and great service. I had a burger, sounds pretty mundane and typical but it was good. Cooked the way I ordered it. Service was very efficient too. Good selection of house brews too. Their Oktoberfest was very tasty, crisp and clean, as was their ale. Been here many times and it's always good."
Gene A.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,22,,3.0,10/14/2016,"I was disappointed with the smoked hickory barbecue sandwich. Nowhere in the menu description was there mention that the base ingredient is a hamburger patty.  The brisket was layered on top of the patty with bacon.  When a sandwich is called smoked brisket, I would not expect it to taste like hamburger."
Amy S.,"Riverton, Salt Lake City, UT",6,22,6,4.0,5/3/2016,"Had dinner here last night. This was my second time dining at BJ's and first time at this specific location. I went with my tried and true favorite- Ahi Tuna Poké, served with these amazing crisp chips and avocado. Honestly, the Poké here is worth making the drive for alone. It very closely mirrors the quality of what I've experienced in Maui. After sharing that, I order the Cherry Glazed Salmon to go. Both were amazing. The restaurant is in between casual and formal. The bar is well-stocked, and the ambience is really nice. The place is fairly dimly lit, but just enough so you can still see your dining mates and your plate.  We only had to wait 15-20 minutes for a booth, but once we were seated, we didn't have any servers checking on us for another 20 minutes, which we weren't thrilled about. I think that other than being pretty short-staffed, it's a pretty great place."
Alessandra O.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,9,,4.0,1/13/2017,"I love BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse. It is always my go to when I am indecisive about where to eat. There is a large selection of food on the menu... anything from seafood, steak, to vegetarian items. There is rarely ever a long wait even when it is busy and everything comes out fresh. No matter where I may be traveling in the nation, this restaurant is always reliable with great service and food when I am unsure of where to go. Never had a bad experience here, great service."
Tracy S.,"Las Vegas, NV",48,47,87,4.0,5/11/2016,We come to this location often. The service both at the bar and tables are always good. They had a special going on. 2 for $25. It was a choice of salad or soup for each person (2 people) medium pizza and a pizookie. Such a great deal. Not sure how long it lasts. Will be back soon!
Jordan M.,"Las Vegas, NV",37,4,,1.0,7/10/2017,"This location should have a ""no coloreds"" sign in the window so i know not to enter next time. I walk in was seated fairly quick and so after 20minutes of sitting and no acknowledgement from anyone on a half busy night, i go tell the hostess about the situation, she tells me ""oh im sorry about that"" and acts like she goes to look for help, i go back to sit down thinkin someone is coming to take care of us, WRONG, what i see is the people who were seated 10/15 minutes after me being served, meanwhile i still havent even been acknowledged, that was my cue to leave. I would love to think race wasnt the case but theres no proof of that, there was about 5 black people total there including me & my gf, sadly enough the ""manager"" was black one busser and one bar tender. The manager excuse was that shes sorry and that ""they know better"" very insincere and uncaring. After barely giving two fucks and doing nothing about the situation she said she would love us to stay and eat, i declined w no hesitation. Me and my gf are very polite good people we didnt deserve that kindve treatment, &even during this whole thing were never rude spoke loud at anyone or anything of that magnitude. Sad i had to find out this way"
Richard R.,"Bradenton, FL",0,15,,4.0,7/5/2017,"Like someone else reviewed, ""another solid meal at B.J.s"".. we live in Summerlin very close to a variety of neighborhood restaurants and go out several nights a week.BJ's works for us for a quick, substantial meal. Service is always efficient and friendly, lots of items on the menu, quick to exchange items if they aren't to par. Still waiting to get there for the week-end prime rib the staff always raves about'm"

Brent V.,"Summerlin, Las Vegas, NV",55,5,1,5.0,11/18/2016,Great staff who provide excellent service. Has a great group of friendly regular guests. Bathrooms could use an upgrade.
Diana A.,"Sunny Isles Beach, FL",36,19,6,5.0,11/7/2016,First time going to this restaurant and it was great! I would definitely go again! I like the ambiance as well and they brew their own root beer for those who like it!
Nathan B.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,15,,5.0,6/24/2017,"Great food, service and price. The food is always good and the price isn't bad at all. Good casual dining!"
Jessica M.,"Harrison Township, MI",116,97,76,5.0,1/26/2016,"Wow. Really impressed. This is a chain restaurant? My dad and step mom took myself and kids here after a long day of planes, walking and driving. I was famished and would have devoured anything put in front of me. First of all, very nice space. Cozy, yet spacious. Modern, but comfortable. Our server was Xavier and he was delightful. We were taken care of at precisely the right pace. The flow of our meal was perfect, even for my overly-impatient father! Drinks came out quickly, my son ordered the house-made root beer and I stole a sip. Very good! My iced tea was fine and everyone else enjoyed theirs. Xavier made sure to refill my kids' drinks, and asking first if they could have more soda! Much appreciated. My step mom had a coupon for a free app so we chose the avocado egg rolls. We all enjoyed them. 3 whole egg rolls cut into 6 pieces. Just enough to kick off the meal. The menu is huge! It takes a minute to navigate. There is another chain restaurant that has a dessert gimmick (ahem CHEESECAKE) and a very large menu as well. I had a very sub par experience there so the large menu scared me. Glad to see my apprehension was misplaced! Kids meals were modestly priced at 5.99. Both of mine went for the mini corndogs, 8 of them! Fries were yummy too! I ordered the tomato bisque and the seared tuna salad. Wow. I have not one criticism and that is quite hard to do! I would eat these things every day if I could. The bowl of soup and the salad were the perfect amount of food, satisfying to the last bite. I usually ask for the dressing on the side, since almost always they drench it down, but theirs was done perfectly. Ingredients were well balanced and fresh. I was also pleased with the price point. $15.99!? I didn't pay, but I was surprised that it wasn't a $19.99 dish. Easy five stars. I wish I was this satisfied with the value, quality of food & service, as well as the overall experience every time I dined out."
Je S.,"Valparaiso, IN",0,18,1,4.0,11/27/2016,"This place seems to be the spot we always stop at when we get into town which is every other month. Prices are reasonable, wide variety on menu, appetizers, soups, salads, sandwiches, entrees and good wine/beer list. The staff is always friendly, the place is typically busy, we never have to wait more than 15 minutes which is nice. One of my favs is the BBQ chicken chopped salad....the thin french fried onions on too make it so good! Good place for a date, meeting a friend, family dinner or to watch a sports game."
Joe M.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,2,,1.0,9/18/2017,"I always have liked the food here, but the wait staff has become simply pathetic. I went to BJs on a Monday night when the restaurant is less than half full. I had a young (maybe 16-17 year old) Hispanic ""gentleman"" as my server. He never gave his name. He mumbled when taking my order and showed little interest in being polite. I hardly even saw my waiter. He had absolutely no interest in doing his job. The time he was actually on the floor, he was either chatting with other waiters at the bar or chatting with girls. While waiting for him come to the table and split our check, he spent 20 minutes talking with two girls one table, laughing and having a great time. No other server approached the table during this time. I tried to approach the bar to get the bartender to split the check, but he refused. A large, black woman (I assume from her clothes that she was the manager) was also just standing around. My friend made a snarky comment to her about the terrible service as we left; she responded like she was surprised and gave the weakest apology I have ever heard. To give proper credit, a short, white female (that was working in a busser/waiter assistant capacity) was extremely polite. She checked on our table twice and wasn't even our server. Everyone else was either black or Hispanic and couldn't care less. My friends and I were put in the corner and refused equal treatment. If you are non-white, I absolutely recommend BJs. The food is great and the wait staff will constantly check on you. But if you are white (like myself and two friends), the wait staff will be slow to take your order, show no interest in your table and spend all of their time slacking off or speaking to other non-white tables. BJs is just another racist business that hates whites."
Martha C.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,61,3,5.0,11/14/2016,"Their wine here is sooo good! Pizookies, deep dish pizza, salmon with potatoes and asparagus is to die for. Always love coming here staff and service is great as well. Place gets really busy on weekends though"
Mai V.,"Las Vegas, NV",85,85,77,5.0,3/23/2016,"I love this place!!! Especially since they added more low carb options and new menu items! The dishes I am recommending so far are the salmon with asparagus and sweet cherry sauce, definitely I am crazy about the honey Sri racha Brussell sprouts, the ahi tuna salad is delicious as well!!! Also I love how they have the BJ rewards program and all the promotions and discounts they offer, which then would justify why I would eat here more than once a week!!! Keep up the good work! A great place where everybody in the family is happy even the kids!"
John H.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,2,,5.0,12/18/2016,"Just had the Bison Burger and the Margarita Pizza, I have to saw wow delicious, healthy and light. Also had 2 different beers this place specializes in any beer you can think of. I will be back very soon and will recommend. Across the street from the Red Rock Hotel."
D R.,"Las Vegas, NV",48,16,,5.0,11/28/2016,"We've been wanting to try this place for a while but my kid would always choose Olive Garden for their soup. This place was family friendly and seemed like a nice place to come at night with friends. Pizza was delicious, drinks were good. The staff greeted us and sat us immediately. Excellent service and staff."
Ellen C.,"Las Vegas, NV",39,197,83,4.0,12/20/2014,"As chain restaurants go, this one is pretty good. Nice beer selection, huge food menu, and pretty reasonable prices. My husband and I each had a beer (IPA for him, pale ale for me), and they were both really good. We split an appetizer of mini bruschetta, which I thought was pretty tasty. (Too much bread-to-topping ratio for my spouse, but he's not really a bread person like me!) He had the pulled pork sandwich, and I had the Asian chopped salad. Yummy fried onions on the sandwich, and the meat was nicely smoked. He was quite pleased! My salad was fine, nothing special, but the portion size was reasonable and thankfully the salad itself was not overdressed. Our waitress was a little overeager, and the back room was a little cold, but otherwise there's not much to complain about. The food was good; the beer was great; and I'm sure we'll be back when we're on that side of town."
Cherilyn D.,"Honomu, HI",4,99,487,5.0,2/28/2016,"BJ's has a great variety of food - pizzas (including deep dish), fish, pork ribs, pastas, and burgers to name a few. Their pazookie dessert is a must try if you love sweets! I'm not a big alcohol drinker, but there is a wide variety of drinks to choose from as well. We normally don't want for a seat in their restaurant area. They have lots of booths and tables in their bar area so we're normally able to find a seat right away."
