JOanne A.,"Las Vegas, NV",310,413,1302,4.0,3/1/2014,"Decent food but sometimes there's a long wait! She's not a huge restaurant but she's big enough. They have an area in the back that you can have a large party. When I was a wedding planner, one of my brides wanted to have their rehearsal dinner here and they fit roughly 25+ people in the back room. It was pretty tight and rather than being sectioned off, it was one long table. It wasn't very comfy but it was good enough for what was needed. Buffet style menu and then drinks were ordered and paid individually. BJ's is very accommodating with their catering options and if they can't, they'll try to take care of ya the best way they can. BJ's is great for a night out to have some drinks and a meal (if you like) to catch up with old friends or a gathering place to be with family. It's low lighting may put you to sleep (as it does for me sometimes) but it assists when you're trying to have a little more intimate/private mean/drink as it makes it harder to see those around you lol."
Michelle H.,"Twin Falls, ID",0,3,,5.0,4/19/2017,"The chicken Alfredo was great! Our server, I believe his name was Nathan, was amazing!"
L W.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,7,,5.0,4/16/2017,We love this place! We go there so much we have favorite waiter and waitress. We love Nate and Taylor (the student). They are so good. We love the food the people. It's so nice!
Laurie H.,"Las Vegas, NV",300,455,256,5.0,9/3/2015,"I LOVE. BJ's. Think it will be the family go-to. The offer Gluten Free Pizza, a little pricey as it comes with cheese only, every topping after that is $1. Making a small pizza close to $20.  It is good, everything our large party ordered was very good.  The drinks are cold,one was an Irish Rootbeer, tasted like Rootbeer, only made out alcohol. The shits were cold, my Sparkling Strawberry Lemonade Was delicious.   As it was my birthday dinner I had a coupon for a free Pizookie, which is a giant chocolate chip cookie pizza. They made mine GF, and didn't charge an up charge. They come with ice cream on top. Our server Chanel brought us extra ice cream! Without us asking! Very nice touch.  The atmosphere is upbeat and a little loud, perfect for when Kayden wasn't happy. Several tvs on,  and drinking people, all led to a family feel.  Parking lot plenty large, patio area perfect for walking a fussy baby.   12 thumbs up!"
Oscar B.,"Summerlin, Las Vegas, NV",63,85,700,1.0,5/14/2016,"Over the years, we have been happy with BJ.   However today, we had the worst experience ever.   My water glass still have food stain upon delivery.  We order a stake medium rare, it came out well done.  Request to be returned, the waiter didn't even apologize. All he said was ""Do you still want the stake?""  Really nasty attitude!   The Ziti was way too salty.  The salad tasted it was left over from last night.  The salad was soggy. It's a competitive market in this town, the unprofessionalism of the staff plus the cleanliness just doesn't work for me."
Paul H.,"Las Vegas, NV",329,548,656,5.0,8/22/2015,"I have been here several times. We have eaten chicken Parmesan, southern fried chicken, sirloin steak, and the Ribeye. Each and every time the meals are prepared properly and the food is delightful. The cheddar mashed potatoes are a must have. The kids have enjoyed the kids menu items and the pazookies are a wonderful dessert. This is definitely a value to the neighborhood and a regular eating spot."
Susan H.,"Las Vegas, NV",166,162,318,2.0,1/11/2016,I was NOT happy about paying for brisket burger with hardly any brisket basically none it was more of a flavored spread. No waiting area (what's called the greedy design) so everyone waiting is standing near those trying to eat! Servers asking you to please move so they can get by. No double doors the cold wind blowing in... My boyfriend liked his food but I wasn't impressed and with drinks (just beer) and our meal it was about 80.00!! Word of advice the happy hour ends at 7 but if you barely get off work and make it there at 630 like me you'll miss happy hour waiting in the way for 30 min plus!
Lehua M.,"Las Vegas, NV",12,8,6,5.0,4/6/2015,"Perfect atmosphere for casual dining. Considering I went around lunch time, we were seated right away and our server was excellent, very attentive! I definitely recommend the avocado egg rolls that come with a delicious dipping sauce, and the juicy stuffed mushrooms as starters. For lunch I had the BBQ Chicken Salad but I substituted the chicken for blackened salmon  and it was prepared just right!  Also, if you're totally stuffed but you have a sweet tooth... They make scrumptious mini versions of their pazokies, its just the right portion workout pushing you over the edge. This would be a great place for happy hour with all the different TV's and the fully stocked bar."
Barbara B.,"Las Vegas, NV",23,19,18,5.0,8/5/2016,"perfect place for family and friends to enjoy a good meal together, only negatives is slower service then what I gave when I waited tables. I was trained to greet your table within 5 to 10 minutes it was roughly 20. also the manager didn't know the sisters to the yelp questions when I checked in. food is so good it's worth the small wait."
Jessica K.,"Las Vegas, NV",3,10,,2.0,1/31/2017,"Never had a horrible experience while dining in and their food is amazing. One of my favorite places to go get burgers and pasta. But whenever I order takeout online (which I do A LOT more often than dining in), EVERY single time they always forget one or more items! I'm not even being dramatic. It's literally every single time. Whether it's utensils, ingredients, sauces, sides, etc. For example, I ordered three burgers tonight. One of the burgers didn't come with onions when we added it online, only one burger came with a side of ranch when I specifically added three, they didn't add as much bleu cheese on the second burger than they normally do, and only gave us forks when I asked for take out utensils. Another time they forgot two sides of our fries. There has been more experiences of them not fulfilling my order, but those are just some examples. I order their burgers the most out of the rest of the menu and I kid you not, every time I go in to pick it up, they always ask me what fries I want when I always put it in online. I don't know if there's something wrong with the website or what, but as a busy person, it's annoying to have to wait. They're not even apologetic. I always tip well because I'm a hostess/takeout person myself, but the fact that they've always forgotten a part of my order and have me wait makes me not want to tip them at all. I don't know how they do it at BJ's, but at the restaurant I work at (which is a very big, chain restaurant that is very similar to BJ's), I pack everything (sauces, entrees, desserts, sides, etc.) and check everything twice to make sure I have everything. So either they do it differently at BJ's or the takeout specialist doesn't know how read and check the order. This really makes me not want to order takeout from BJ's anymore."
Robert C.,"Deer Park, WA",5,273,,5.0,1/29/2017,Seems like this is always good ... we will return ... we try to eat here every time we are in town
Greg A.,"San Diego, CA",117,27,9,5.0,9/19/2016,"Love the food,  love the service.  They have the best kale and Cajun shrimp salad.  Pizooki is to die for,  and most like will get a heart attack from the decadent density of the chocolate.  But free birthday dinners and great rewards program."
Imafood E.,"Las Vegas, NV",9,136,15,4.0,12/29/2015,They have an amazing turkey burger here. I added cheese to it and it was delicious! Very good service and reasonable prices too.
Ania K.,"Las Vegas, NV",2515,430,5997,4.0,9/6/2014,This is a regular stop for us because it's consistent and near our house. They offer very filling food with good flavors & it's good to have a chilled glass of beer once in a while. We always order the BBQ chicken pizza & a small favorite starter are the corn fritters.  It's a very busy location so be prepared to wait if you come during peak hours. There are tv's everywhere so ladies don't come for romance reasons :)
Jamie M.,"Las Vegas, NV",121,100,96,5.0,12/11/2015,"Chanel's service was 5 star, good fast food! Love the Brussels sprouts with Sriracha sauce and have it on every visit!"
Pamela F.,"Round Mountain, NV",0,14,1,4.0,2/9/2017,"first time here, had the shrimp and arugula pita tacos and seasoned fries with there harvest hefeweizen wheat beer, awesomely good. good atmosphere. will come again."
Christine O.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,20,39,4.0,4/26/2015,"Good service, attentive wait staff. Good food with the usual huge American portions. Reading some of the other reviews, everybody else has pretty much covered it. I'll post some pictures though. I agree it's a good place to go, it's super casual, a little bit loud for the music for my taste, but I think it's for younger people. Huge selections of beer as you would expect in a brewhouse, large selection of wines and mixed drinks.  Adequate food choices from dinners to. pizzas, salads, appetizers, everything was good. We got the corn fritter appetizer, very nice."
Jane K.,"Las Vegas, NV",54,168,202,2.0,9/30/2016,"Food was okay, not great, but it's kind of like bar food, so you can't expect much. The service was great, until the bill came out. He said he would be back for our change and never came back. Okay, then he came back and said he will be right back. Great! I waited another 10 min as everyone else is getting their checks and leaving. By this time we have waited about 30 minutes total for our change. I would have given him all of our change, but it was the principal, knowing the change exceeds the 20% and expecting more than that. So, we asked if we can get our change back. He says, oh, you wanted your change back?He was a bit surprised. Not sure why he was surprised when he said, he would be back for our change. When he came back  to give us our change, he didn't give us all of it back. I still left him 20% tip, but I was bit irritated that I had to ask for the change back and not get all of it back. Hence the 2 stars for trying to take my money."
Michael P.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,14,1,3.0,8/29/2016,Lot's of changes at this place.  Pizza seemed totally different and very bready!! The new checkout system takes too long and the staff gets confused.
Angie S.,"Anaheim, CA",1,4,,1.0,2/2/2017,Worst service ever. Waited for over 10 minutes to even be acknowledged. Definitely going down hill.
