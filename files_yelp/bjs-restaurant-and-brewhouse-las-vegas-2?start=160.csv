Emily R.,"Las Vegas, NV",1770,1649,10800,2.0,10/15/2012,"I've never been a huge fan of BJ's restaurants. They seem to offer all my favorite things, beer and food, but the place has never really grown on me.  On this occasion, I shared a half buffalo chicken and half sweet pig pizza. I enjoy the texture of the pan pizza, but they no longer serve them in the pan, which was a disappointment. Maybe they were just a little too heavy for the servers to carry, but man they really helped keep the pizza warm and the presentation was better. Now they serve them on a plate and it just wasn't the same. I didn't really enjoy either pizza flavor either. I've had both before and they were ok, but this time I was completely underwhelmed. The pizza just didn't seem warm and gooey enough to make up for the lack of flavor either.  I did enjoy my unsweetened tropical iced tea. I'm always happy when places offer other varieties of unsweetened tea. The service was ok as well. Our server was friendly, but she wasn't very quick with the refills, so we sat with empty glasses for a little longer than I would have liked. Overall, it's not my favorite restaurant chain, but it does in a pinch. I just haven't found the menu item of my dreams here yet."
Sandra G.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,3,,1.0,1/26/2017,"Disappointed with the service-had gone here on a Saturday night around 10:20pm. Service was horrible as there were maybe 10 people in the bar/restaurant area total.   It took us forever to even get our salads-as we asked the waitress while she planning on walking right by us after sitting there just waiting & waiting-she then walked right into the back & seconds later came out with them (obviously they had been there for some time).  Our pizza was uncooked & we seemed to be more of a hassle to our waitress than a customer.   I since have contacted the corporate office by e-mail with no return & also verbally left a message on the corporate number with no return, this is definitely bad customer service on many levels."
Monica D.,"Las Vegas, NV",607,440,67,4.0,6/12/2014,"I recently had lunch here (I'd been here before for drinks and also for a work dinner), and BJ's did not disappoint. Every experience I've had at BJ's has been perfectly pleasant.  They were very busy at lunchtime, but we were seated promptly. Our server was very friendly and attentive as well. I really appreciated the variety of lunch specials! There were lots of choices, from pizza to salads, to entrees. I got the BBQ platter, which came with a BBQ pork slider, a BBQ chicken breast, cole slaw and fries. The chicken was juicy and tasty. The slider was also pretty tasty, just messy.  BJ's is a great Summerlin option for lunch. Casual and low key!"
Rachel V.,"Las Vegas, NV",138,33,4,5.0,12/28/2015,"Hands down, best Hefeweizen! Whenever I'm in the mood for a fresh. enjoyable brew, this is my GO TO. Great Bar area as well! Perfect place for Happy hour! I'd recommend the Avocado Egg Rolls and the Santa Fe Spring Rolls as well! And of course their Pizookie is on fire always!"
Cody T.,"Reno, NV",11,32,4,5.0,8/8/2015,"BJs is a classic. Everyone knows Bjs, this is one of those places you go to after a football, basketball, game or your little sisters recital. Place is delicious and satisfying!  The pizookies are so good you let the ice cream melt in your mouth like ice cubes! The burgers are flame flame. The juicyness and the flavor zaps your taste buds like an alien zapping you to outer space! The pasta is nothing but delicious! Don't forget the beer! The finest beers of all the land man they're good! Great place to eat!"
Brianna L.,"Westside, Las Vegas, NV",208,110,64,4.0,3/31/2016,Love bjs! Great food and love the beer selection! We like the poke app and like the buffalo chicken pizza! Also we like coming for lunch for there unlimited soup and salad! Tasty tasty! And only for 8 bucks! Last but not least is the famous pazooki!! Our favorite is the Oreo!! Also the new monkey bread is pretty good too! Overall good meal and good prices!
Karissa G.,"Las Vegas, NV",91,3,,5.0,8/8/2016,"Really good food with a great variety on the menu. The healthy options are good, but the best thing is definitely the pizookie. Warm and gooey deep dish cookie topped with ice cream melting all over? It's even better than it sounds. Trust me, the pizookie does not disappoint!"
Rabea A.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,9,3,3.0,9/18/2016,"Food was ok, nothing to come back for.. service should be more professional.. Xavier was rude"
T L.,"Las Vegas, NV",4,95,11,1.0,3/18/2016,"What happened? Bjs is no longer our go to family restaurant. Service is so slow and unprofessional. Took so long for our server to even acknowledge our party. We had to track down a manager to request some service. Even after we got our food, we never saw our server again....until the check came. Shameful. Food was ok but not good enough to make up for poor service. Too bad. We'll miss coming here. There are many more options were we can spend our money and get better service."
Rex M.,"Richardson, TX",1206,192,2318,5.0,3/25/2015,"Always the right choice...... Because Feast Buffet at the tony and electric Red Rock Resort & Casino had a line out the door, I went to one of my reliable favorites. But in beautiful Summerlin! Because it was a late lunch, it was not very crowded and I was seated immediately in a plush booth. What a relief. No crowds and a restful and restorative dining area with the myriad of flat screen TV's kept at just the right volume for conversation when making new friends. The lunch special of a deep dish meat extravaganza pizza and salad were an ideal choice. The pizza was so hot I had to wait for it to cool. Still, an abundance of stretchy cheese with every slice. The salad was not a wimpy small afterthought. It was a dinner-plate of fresh tomato's, black olives, field greens, sweet red onion, hot-house cucumbers and field greens topped with a refreshing vinaigrette.  Service was five star. My handsome young waiter had just moved from Colorado and was a delight to talk with. He recommended sampling the root-beer. Had no idea it was made in-house, but I had three frosty mugs of it plus a to-go glass. Just a small cat here, so was not able to finish all the food and there was no refrigerator in my suite at The Palazzo. Bygones. Going back to my second home of Summerlin/Henderson/Las Vegas about seven times a year I always put this BJ's on my food ""bucket-list"". So very Summerlin! Highly recommended!"
Victoria Q.,"New York, NY",1379,134,578,4.0,3/26/2014,"Bj's food  is comparable to chili's...not great but definitely not bad. How they set themselves apart from the list of mediocre food establishments is their service. I have never had a bad experience at any Bj's locations. The staff is so helpful and attentive. I've come during happy hours and peak dinner hours and have always received great service.  And even though nothing that I've ever ordered from Bj's has ever stood out to me, I have to acknowledge that they have put together a very extensive menu together for their guests. Their is a dish for everyone in your party. They have a great beer selection... a variety of in house and craft brews for you to choose from. Their cocktails are also great...especially the watermelon mojito. Bj's is a great neighborhood spot to go to if there is one in your area."
Kimberly D.,"Henderson, NV",1,25,3,5.0,7/6/2016,"Been here a few times..always had a good time with good food. Tonight my fiancé and I sat at the bar and ordered two alcoholic drinks, avo egg rolls appetizer and the pizooki dessert with 3 pizookis (yum). Food was awesome and service was great. Bartender was Tracey, and she was very friendly!"
Christie L.,"Las Vegas, NV",1069,859,6625,4.0,3/1/2014,"I always get flyers in the mail for BJ's, but for whatever reason hadn't ever tried it until now. The inside appeared clean and I was greeted and helped right away. The menu had a good variety of options. I wasn't too hungry so I just ordered a ""Fresh Mozzarella and Tomato Salad"" priced at $3.50 thinking it would be small for the price, but I was wrong! There was a fair mix of red onion, tomato, mozzarella, basil and it was topped with a balsamic dressing. I was impressed with the amount of mozzarella in it and it tasted fresh and good. My niece was with me and she chose priced at $4.95 a ""Kids Pizza"" from the kids menu. It was a 6 in deep dish cheese pizza topped with tomatoes. I scored a piece and it was good! I liked the thickness and flavor. The kids pizza also included a drink so it was a good deal and she was happy!  They offer online ordering and you can go inside to pick it up or call the number on the sign in the designated parking when you arrive and they will bring it out to you. If you eat here often you might want to consider signing up for their rewards program."
Marco G.,"Las Vegas, NV",83,77,64,4.0,5/10/2016,First of all I'm not sure why I couldn't find this place on Yelp while I was there. Had to google it then locate it. Anyways... Came here for dinner and can't really go wrong here. Had a beer sampler and they had a 25 dollar special for 2 so my fiancé and I had it. It included either a soup or salad and a medium deep dish pizza along with their famous pizookie. Everything was delicious and our server was wonderful. This place normally doesn't get too crowded and the wait is very minimal. Will def be a regular here.
Adam S.,"Las Vegas, NV",30,17,2,1.0,5/11/2015,3rd time going. All 3 times the food was not very good. Party of 8 and all of us agreed no more going back. Maybe they're known for something that we haven't tried yet. On a side note. The lay out is pretty bad too. Where we were sitting it was so tight we had to keep moving our seat in and out to let people and waiters go by. Not a very enjoyable experience at all.
Avner M.,"Henderson, NV",2620,535,34,2.0,7/18/2014,"1pm & the service is not very good today...been here for a good 5 minutes, the waiter came to take our drink order, 10 minutes & he has not come back, REALLY??? 2 waters, 3 ice teas??? At the 15 mark drinks finally came, orders taken.  Now sitting, drinks empty??? Food finally came and order is wrong???  The manager came over apologized, offered to get the sandwich made over but we said no as we waited almost 45 minutes just to get food.  Also ha to ask the manage for drink refills which were brought by another person. Now 2pm, the place is almost empty, drink is empty, waiter came by but no acknowledgement.  Our waiter, has a great personality but as for attention to detail, not very good. Had to ask for another ice tea. Not sure why it is so bad today???"
Katie Y.,"Las Vegas, NV",19,64,58,4.0,6/7/2015,"Pretty consistent with their food,  great lunch specials and happy hour specials.   Love their pizookie dessert,  it's the absolute best but don't count on vanilla ice cream being available on Sunday nights because their delivery comes on Monday :-(   If you tend to get chilly like me, make sure to bring a sweater because the AC is always on blast.  :-)"
Uriel G.,"Las Vegas, NV",98,4,1,1.0,2/27/2015,"We went to this restaurant for dinner and had a bad experience all around.  First, we waited a long long time (about 15 minutes) for the waiter. We had to go ask another waiter.  When we finally order our burgers, the food take for ever to come to our table.  It was almost like a nightmare. So, I asked for my burger medium cooked, right?, well they didn't just over cooked it, they burned it, it testad like charcoal. We didn't complain, we just are not coming back. why, there ara a lot of good options in Summerlin area. By the way, the restaurante was not busy at all."
Racer X.,"Westside, Las Vegas, NV",0,23,11,4.0,4/23/2015,"We took the kids here for dinner on a Thursday night at 7pm. It was packed, but we were seated rather quickly. Service was great, and the food was excellent! The waiters didn't seem to wear name tags, but our server Humberto did great, even though he seemed over worked."
Ken G.,"Las Vegas, NV",103,15,20,5.0,4/10/2015,Excellent service and the food is delicious. Every time I come here I try something new and so far have not been disappointed yet. I had the ribs and let me tell you! It will be a travesty if you go there and not treat yourself.  It's worth it. Trust me. Thumbs up for BJ's.
