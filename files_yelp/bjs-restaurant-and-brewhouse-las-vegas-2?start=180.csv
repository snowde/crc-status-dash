James M.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,2,3,2.0,7/4/2016,"Lousy host ! Check in at 2 pm no menu presented and just send you to the table.. Sat for 5 minutes, the  server lack of acknowledgement, went to a table next to me 3 times no greetings what so ever..  I Ordered lunch especial, a cup of soup that  was so so.. Instead of a cup I was given a bowl... Then3 minutes later entree comes.. Really!! It's 4th of July half of the room was empty... Service can be rendered better.. Service at BJ's on South Eastern in Henderson Is far better and well executed.."
Jess H.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,11,12,4.0,10/27/2015,"So yummy, I had the California chicken sandwich and it was delicious. And my husband had the country fried chicken, and it was pretty good too. So juicy! And the crafted cream soda was really tasty, I just wish the drinks were colder"
Cerise B.,"Las Vegas, NV",47,93,106,4.0,9/2/2015,"I usually enjoy the food here, but the southern fried chicken I ordered was seasoned with way too much salt (and I love salt!).  My husband ordered mozzarella sticks and buffalo chicken flatbread, which were both very good.  The service was excellent, as usual."
Chad C.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,27,8,3.0,6/26/2016,"Food was ok this time , service was alittle slow being not busy. Everyone was nice though."
Clint B.,"Las Vegas, NV",762,1113,4735,3.0,4/4/2012,"The number one reason to come here is the pizookie. Sure, it's something that I can easily make at home, but I'm way too lazy. It came out in a fairly large (maybe 5-6 inches in diameter) metal dish. In it, a piping hot, moist and chewy chocolate chip cookie at least a quarter inch thick and topped with two scoops of vanilla ice cream. It's simple but when you combine two classics like cookies and ice cream it's a sure fire way to make me drool. It's large enough for three people to share, but my son and I managed to devour it quickly between the two of us. The other food is pretty standard. They've got a big menu that'll make you think you're at the Cheesecake Factory. Full of items not high in quality of preparation or ingredients, but large enough to appease any hearty appetite. The pot roast sandwich may not be good for the heart, but it's good for the soul -- slices of beef on top of toasted garlic bread. If that wasn't enough they top it off with mashed potatoes and gravy. Some random veggies on the side might fool others into believing it's healthier than it is. The wife went with a classic burger. Standard fare, but it hit the spot. The place is great for families. It's loud enough to drown out the sounds of restless toddlers and plenty of tv's to distract you from the average food and service. The kid's menu is full of all the usual stuff -- chicken tenders, grilled cheese, burgers, etc. So, chances are there's something for even the pickiest eater. 3.5 Stars"
Dejan L.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,2,,5.0,8/20/2016,"Awesome restaurant and awesome servers! Deep dish pizza is amazing! Kids have to try Mac 'n' cheese from the kids menu. And what to say about our server Ariana... I am 10 years in hospitality, I've never met better server in my life! I just can't decide if food is better or service! Definitely going back soon!"
Shaolin W.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,,5.0,6/12/2016,BJ's has been my favorite kick back restaurant for years! Today's experience reminded me why I love them. The food was great and service was amazing!!
Tk D.,"Las Vegas, NV",11,13,,2.0,11/11/2016,"Where do I begin .......This particular BJ's is always busy and not only did we have to wait 30 min (they said 20) but once a booth became open in the bar area we had to flag down a waitress to clear off the table (several walked past us without even acknowledging the dirty table but upon observation I noticed a plethora of others had to do the same thing ) once the table was cleaned I notice we had the same waitress as the last  time and I was like ohhh joy (did you catch the sarcasm ) nevertheless I ordered my usual ""Cadillac margarita NO salt (this time I had to say NOOO salt so she can hear me since the last time she screwed it up) wellllllll this time was NOOOOO different she brings my drink out with NOOOO salt and I drink it and welp this time it had no salt but she brought me a grapefruit margarita no salt....after that once again she became sarcastic because of her error... we also ordered two pizookies and had a coupon for a free one, she took the information and 15 min later out comes 1 pizookie, soooooo im writing this to say Nicole N you may need to get your hearing checked because everything we ordered you brought what we didn't ordered (or what you thought you heard )......"
Gracie F.,"Dana Point, CA",64,89,35,5.0,1/22/2015,"Who DOESN'T love BJs??  Great food, never a long wait even when there is a line...cheerful staff and a game playing on TV.  I LOVE the flatbread pizzas!!  Try them all!"
Anik G.,"Las Vegas, NV",13,30,123,5.0,7/11/2015,Great environment n vibe!! Jared B was my server. Although he forgot my to bring my drink that I ordered with my food I gotta give him 5 stars cuz he has a great personality n very friendly. I have been here a couple times but didn't get a server with a great vibe n playful like today. Food was great n drinks cold as I expected. I had a great time today!
Jimmie W.,"Las Vegas, NV",138,23,138,4.0,6/2/2015,"I like this place , the pasta's are good and the cheeseburgers are the bomb  and dessert  are the bomb . Can't go wrong"
Hazel M.,"Las Vegas, NV",273,48,61,4.0,12/26/2013,"LUNCH FOR TWO. First off our server forgot to give us straws with our water, but when he brought water to an older couple next to us he did not forget to give them straws or a cup of water filled with new ice. Our water looked like it's been sitting out for a while because the ice was almost melted.  & when they brought out our clam chowder they forgot to bring out crackers with it & it took forever to flag someone down for it. Did I mention it was my boyfriend's birthday? It was a nice that they brought out a dessert for him, but they brought it out when I was in the bathroom. I mean, couldn't you wait a little bit until I came back out? He was sitting by himself with the damn dessert & a lit candle on it! (he didn't want to blow it out until I came back.) Lastly, I usually get the jambalaya because it's one of the best I've had but today I tried the grilled chicken pasta & to my disappointment, it was totally bland. I understand my boyfriend & I are young but that's no excuse to give us poor service. We still left the waiter 20%, undeservingly. I only bumped it up an extra star because I usually come here & I never had a bad experience until today...on my boyfriends birthday. Such a shame."
Amanda B.,"Las Vegas, NV",496,326,338,1.0,9/15/2013,"Yuck! Worst meal I have had in a long time. The entire experience was bad. I walked in t this restaurant and was greeted by a nasty hostess who had the worst attitude. What a B*&$%!!! I had to complain and the manager came right over and apologized right away.  Ordered the Potato Skins for the app. Since when do you deep fry potato skins? These were deep fried with no cheese, bacon or green onion. Just plain with sour cream sauce. Blah, gross! Next up came the meal. The BF ordered the BBQ Beef Sandwich with coleslaw. It was so bad he could not even choke it down. Usually he can eat anything, so this had to be bad. He said it was the worst tasting sandwich he had ever had. Mine was the Angel Hair Pasta that I have ordered several times here and it is usually good. The chef didn't drain the noodles so the bottom of the bowl was full of water, there was no sauce at all, just a few canned tomatoes and trust me, all I could taste was the metal from the can and a half of teaspoon of feta. This went back immediately. They brought me a bowl of their famous clam chowder to replace the pasta. Hahahah-- famous clam chowder?? You have got to be kidding me.  The only good thing was the beer that we had. They have their October Fest beer now and of course their famous Jeremiah Red. Funny how they are famous for so many things. NOT!!!"
Brian W.,"Las Vegas, NV",582,32,37,5.0,2/3/2016,I've always liked BJ's brewery. They have great food selection at a reasonable price. Today I enjoyed a salmon and broccoli lunch very tasty very healthy. I also like the fact that they offer many gluten free options even their desserts come in gluten-free options. Highly recommend.
Matt T.,"Las Vegas, NV",79,342,,3.0,1/22/2016,"My Dad and I ate lunch in here today.  And it was a mixed bag.  He had the Margherita Flatbread, which he said was great and it looked good.  I had a Chicken Pesto Sandwich.  It had Pesto, Roasted Red Bell Peppers, Grilled Chicken, and I got the garlic aioli on the side.  And it comes with a side salad.  The salad was great.  It had some sort of citrus vinegar dressing.  I really enjoyed that.  However, there was something in the sandwich that set my mouth on fire.  I don't know if they put jalapenos in the pesto, but something was extremely spicy.  I could only eat half the sandwich.  And there wasn't a whole lot of chicken on it.  We each had some of the house root beer, which is excellent.  The service was also good and it was very clean in there.  I'd definitely eat here again, however I'm staying away from the Chicken Pesto Sandwich.  The other downside is that they share a parking lot with two other restaurants and when it is peak eating hours, it can be brutal trying to find parking or dodge bad drivers."
Jonathan O.,"Las Vegas, NV",6,9,2,5.0,4/24/2016,"My family and I LOVE BJ's! The food is amazing, and my only complaint is the wait time...but that's a good indicator of how good the place is!"
Nina N.,"Westside, Las Vegas, NV",96,8,7,1.0,12/4/2014,I can say that I will never eat here again. I'm so disappointed in the quality of food that I ordered here. I get having char marks on your food but my steak was so burnt that I felt sick from the first bite. I went back to get a new order and it's STILL burnt. They need to get a new grill cook or something because this was horrible!
Jeremy W.,"Honolulu, HI",44,22,1,2.0,9/13/2015,"The food was decent, but the service wasn't. We ordered the orange glazed salmon w/ asparagus and the chicken pitas. I would give the food a B. It was brought to our table without much wait. Our waiter was not real attentive and messed up our dessert order. He brought our bill before we received our dessert and we noticed he ordered the wrong dessert and asked him to make sure we received the correct dessert. Shortly after, the manager came to our table and apologized for the mix up with our dessert. We ended up waiting an extended time to receive the correct dessert, which was fairly tasty (macadamia nut cookie with vanilla ice cream on top). The waiter took our bill and cashed us out and never apologized for the dessert issue, even though he or the manager took it off our bill. Kinda sad that the waiter didn't take advantage of an opportunity to apologized and let us know they comped the dessert because of the mistake."
Nicholas N.,"North Hollywood, CA",0,14,8,1.0,4/2/2016,"I really don't know what was going on but we had horrible service. They took my name at the front after being ignored for a bit, and no it wasn't busy at all. They finally called my name within a short period (only good thing that night, but wait there's more!) and walked our party of 3 to our table, though it seemed like they didn't know where to even seat us in a half empty restaurant, mind you. Well we sat down at a table finally and waited for 30 minutes. No one offered us a drink or greeted us or anything. Maybe we forgot to take our invisible cloaks off or something. I guess they didn't want our business. Because even after complaining (respectfully), they didn't seem like they cared at all. So here I am now across the street at Yard House with amazing service and food, writing this review."
Alicia B.,"Montgomery, AL",134,103,73,4.0,8/16/2013,"I wish i could give 4 1/2 stars....... I got a coupon from Facebook for 50% off a large deep dish pizza, you can't beat that!! So we headed up there tonight. Now we come here often it's our go to place when we don't know what we want and I love it!  However, I decided to get the BJ's favorite pizza tonight and its the most bland pizza I have ever had. (Which is why I knocked off a star this time) Pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, peppers, and onions were on the pizza. These can be bold flavors but tonight it wasn't there. I will stick to the BBQ chicken pizza if we get pizza again!  Service as always was outstanding! Our dessert took 20 mins so the manager came out to take it off our bill, which was very nice!"
