R K.,"Las Vegas, NV",63,180,8,4.0,8/2/2015,Usually a pretty good meal at BJ's if you can handle the wait.  Service is friendly but it's often difficult to get your server's attention.  We started with Caesar Salads and asked the person who brought it to our table for fresh black pepper.  She said she would let our server know.  We waited about 7-8 minutes until we finally saw our server and asked her.   Pizzas are always tasty.  But the real reason my kids like going here is for the pazookies!!
Brian S.,"Las Vegas, NV",33,97,,2.0,1/3/2015,"The truth is I have experienced way better for the same prices they have there. Just on 01/02/2015 me and my wife did a order to go, for us and some of our family and kids. The order wasn't big, it was a pretty easy straight forward order.      I spoke to a girl name Brahel if I even spelled it correctly, she was very polite on the phone and took our order, so after ordering she read back what I said to her and then she gave a price and had no problem with it.       We went to go pick our food up and when we came home, the food we ordered wasn't there, only a portion of what we ordered was there, so I looked over my receipt and they charged me for exactly what I ordered, so I called them up stating I was missing items the girl Donna who answered the phone was very rude and said "" don't complain to me I didn't take your order "". She immediately sent me back to the ordering Department, so I was speaking with a manager.       The manager was polite and understanding, he said he would have someone deliver the missing items to our home. I called within 2 minutes of being home and noticing what was missing, we had to wait over an hour just to get the same wrong food....        The company doesn't obviously train people and specially have people listen. I called back and I had to explain again to the same manager that the items that I told him I paid for were still not there and he apologized again and said he would have them delivered, I said forget ir I just won't return."
Jamie L.,"Las Vegas, NV",34,74,28,5.0,6/27/2013,"Call ahead seating!!   LOVE, LOVE BJ's!  It's one of few places that we can go to as a family and everyone is happy and content.  It's less than a mile from my house which is super awesome and I've never been disappointed!!  Yes, I know this is a chain and I am personally more a fan of the local eateries, but BJ rocks!! They have a kid's menu that the girls know like the back of their hands and I like that it includes celery & carrots and ranch or applesauce or a small salad.  Not just fries (since those don't go over well with my kids).   The happy face potatoes are awesome too, but they are not fans.  They now have a great ENLIGHTENED menu if you want to keep the calories down -- my personal ENLIGHTED fave is the chicken ala fresca, but  the Garden Market Salad w/Blackened Chicken is a close second!  We love their pizza - if in the mood for a thick pizza filled with goodness.  Hubby loves their fried shrimp, chicken fried steak and many of their sandwiches.   Breakfast is good too - not what brings me back every time, but it's noteworthy.   Come on your birthday and get a free b-day sized pizookie!! Yum!  They don't sing either which is a bonus, but their pizookies are amaaaaazing!!!  I've never seen one disappear so quickly as they do when placed in front of my kids!!"
Pam W.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,2,,5.0,9/8/2016,"We went for lunch today and sat in the bar area. Dan was our server . He was so funny, friendly, helpful and happy to be our server which is so nice to see now a days. I had the caprese piadina which was really good and my husband had the lunch chicken breast with mash potatoes which he loved. So nice to be at a place where people don't hate their jobs and if they do ... no one is showing it. Lol  Great people and Food! Oh I forgot to mention the Salted Caramel Pizookie! So good!"
P M.,"Fresno, CA",0,45,11,2.0,8/21/2015,I wish they would've kept the pizza the same. Been coming to BJs since I was a teenager. I always order the same thing. I can taste the difference. I hate when people ruin a good thing. Glad the strawberry lemonade and Pazookis never changed
Alison P.,"Las Vegas, NV",17,31,40,2.0,8/14/2014,Pros: We were seated quickly. Practically no wait time. we ordered the 4 beer sampler. I liked the house beers. My boyfriend and I really enjoyed the oasis amber and the house blonde. When we asked for lemon for our water the waitress brought a lot of lemon. Cons: We were starving when we arrived and waited 30min just to order drinks. The waitress rushed off before we had a chance to order food. Another 30min went by before she brought our beers and we were so frustrated from waiting an hour we just asked for our check. It took the waitress another 10min to bring us our check 20 to pick up the check and 20 to bring it back to us. after about an 1 hour and 45min of waiting  I was so disappointed in the service. I might come back and give it another chance. Hopefully it will be better next time.
Michelle A.,"Las Vegas, NV",125,24,11,5.0,3/7/2016,Love this location and the service here. I try to avoid peak times (weekend lunch/dinner). The food is fantastic and I love their craft brews and soda! I've been here 20+ times and they never let me down.
Maryanne L.,"Las Vegas, NV",130,50,68,4.0,7/13/2015,Bj's is always consistent . The food is good and so are the prices.   I have had a few visits with slow or sub par service but again it's pretty rare. The menu has about 4 pages of drinks and beers and lots of appetizers. The lunch menu is by far the best.
Jonny E.,"Honolulu, HI",8,51,89,5.0,10/9/2014,"Generous portions of food that taste great, they accommodated for our party of 9 in no time and the service was exceptionally fast and friendly, would recommend this place to friends and family with small or large parties...the ahi poke and rib eye was excellent!"
Colleen T.,"Las Vegas, NV",206,199,5,3.0,6/29/2014,"This is your typical BJ's, with the giant menu and the cookie pie things. I've been here a few times, and the service is better than in Centennial, you get in and out quickly. I've never had an issue with a waiter or waitress.  They are located by the Red Rock casino so you can always go to a movie and cross the street to eat here, or just get dessert like I do some times."
Mike C.,"Long Beach, CA",4,7,3,1.0,7/13/2016,Take out is very disorganized. Placed order 20 min before I arrived and I still waited an additional 20 min for my order. As I waited there was no comfort from the employees saying that my order is on the way or was still cooking. There were multiple people that came and got there orders way before I did.
Elie M.,"Las Vegas, NV",838,127,74,5.0,9/18/2015,"Had the small pizza and salad.  Pizza was very good.  Mozzarella,tomato with Balsamic dressing salad was awesome.  But the best part was the service. Wait staff could not have been friendlier and I could not ask for better service.  This was my first time but definitely not my last."
Stephen B.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,11,2,1.0,7/21/2016,"Terrible service, terrible food, terrible background music..(loud and blaring)and most of all terrible attitude from the manager...other than that, it was perfect"
Neil M.,"Indian Springs, NV",1,12,,5.0,2/24/2016,Service is prompt and precise! We've been to this location twice and have been over satisfied if that is possible. Price is very reasonable and the food was excellent. We will definitely return again. Highly recommended for lunch!
Amanda H.,"Henderson, NV",156,5,3,5.0,9/23/2015,We love this location. The service we receive from Cinnamon O. is spectacular (being in the industry it takes alot to be amazed by a server). She was friendly right from the get go. She asked us questions and was genuinely interested in our answers. She was accommodating when our party size kept growing. She managed to keep the drinks and the conversation flowing on a football Sunday. This will be our new after work location on Sundays thanks to Cinammon O.
Mel C.,"Las Vegas, NV",237,1503,8255,4.0,10/12/2012,"Located right across from Red Rock Casino and Resort.  Everytime I've eaten here, it's never by plan.  It's always been because either Yard House (at Red Rock) is too busy or I happen to be on that side of Charleston.   As for the food.  Probably tried almost everything on the menu at some point.  My favorites include their Spinach Dip, Salmon, Lasagna, Pazookie, and their Great White Pizza.  If you haven't tried their Pazookie, then you must try at least once. I prefer the Peanut Butter Cookie Pazookie over the Chocolate Chip.   My favorite dish is the Great White Pizza.  Chicago deep dish style pizza that taste like a pasta alfredo.  I love it when they burn the crust a little.  Sometimes I request it.  Service is just average, but really good during lunch.  I have to say, service is better than Yard House across the street.   Any BJ's is a safe bet when your with a group and everyone is undecided where to eat.  One things for sure, getting a table is a lot easier here than in the one's I frequent in California."
Brett W.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,14,1,3.0,7/16/2016,"Im gonna give it 3 stars, more like 3.5 but i round down bc its not quite 4 star. There r a lot of crappy things on the menu to navigate around but they do open at 10am on the weekends. Their burgers r good. I am not a fan of deep dish but my wife loves the spicy pig. I like their sandwiches and the chowder is really good. Stick w those and the desserts and youre set"
Anita D.,"Las Vegas, NV",3,32,68,5.0,6/17/2014,"Stopped for lunch, I love the Honey Crisp Chicken Salad & my husband tried the new Spinach with Seasonal Berries salad + Blackened Salmon...we ended with a Chocolate Chip Pizookie with substituted Chocolate ice cream! Downloaded their APP & saved $5 off the check :)"
Norm K.,"Las Vegas, NV",1027,2258,10709,3.0,8/15/2012,"I went to BJ's yesterday for lunch with a group of 11 people.  There were four parties, including ours, with 10 or more people yesterday and the staff handled it well.  The kitchen was a bit overwhelmed so our orders took longer than normal, but it was fine because we weren't in a hurry. I ordered the soup and 1/2 sandwich.  For soup I ordered the tortilla soup.  The sandwich was the turkey Cobb.  The soup was outstanding.  The tortilla strips are in the bowl and the warm soup was poured overtop so they retained their crispness.  There was also some pieces of avocado and the flavor of cilantro was very present for a wonderful flavor.  I was a bit disappointed in the sandwich.  It was billed as roasted turkey.  Well, it was, but it was luncheon meat roasted turkey and sliced thin for the sandwich.  It also says with blue cheese dressing.  It was there but the blue cheese flavor was not. As for our server, she was really good.  My iced tea was replaced with a fresh glass when I got low.  She did commit a cardinal sin with one of my friends.  He ordered another beer and when she brought it, she picked up his unfinished first glass and removed it before he could stab her with his fork.  That's a big no no!!  She didn't do that with the little iced tea that was left in my glass when she brought the fresh glass.  Wow, were we surprised. Summing up BJ's, it's OK.  It's not a place to which I'd go often.  There are just too many good places to go in this town and this area."
Scott P.,"Las Vegas, NV",679,172,97,5.0,4/9/2014,"I have two words for you: pi-zookie In certain situations there is nothing you crave more than a good BJs. Another review compared it to Chilis and that comparison is probably pretty apt but I think of it more as a cheese cake factory- they don't really specialize in anything (food wise)-they have an enormous menu with a bunch of diverse options, none of which knock your socks off but all of which are passable.BJs is a great compromise spot when trying to negotiate a meal with a large group- it has something for everyone . All that being said we all know what we really love about BJs- the pizookie. If it wasn't for this dessert no one would have heard of this restaurant/it would of gone the way of the dodo. The pizookie is a skillet cookie Sunday that you can get in a bunch of different flavors- both cookie and ice cream. They even have a sampler pizookie that comes with 3 different cookie and ice cream combinations so you can get a variety. However, for the discerning foodie the only real option is the white chocolate macadamia nut one- the cookie comes not quite baked through, very soft and gooey in the middle. This means the white chocolate will be basically molten (be careful you don't burn 1/2 your face off Harvey Dent style by shoveling it in too fast... I know from experience) and though the whole cookie itself is soft the nuts will give you that crunch for textural contrast that is so key.  In closing- PI ZOOKIE MOFO"
