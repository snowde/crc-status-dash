Mishalonte G.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,5,2,5.0,2/13/2015,Great service and food what more could I say. Our waitress Danielle was awesome she kept a smile on her face and made sure we was satisfied.
Nicholas W.,"Las Vegas, NV",169,226,195,4.0,4/15/2015,The best BJs in Vegas! They are always packed full but super fast. I've never had a bad experience at this location and make it a point to stop by when on the west side of town because the pizza is so good.  The sweet pig is the way to go!
Victoria K.,"Las Vegas, NV",73,83,226,4.0,9/5/2014,"This place is our go to spot if we are looking for something close to home. Service is a hit and miss, but food is good. I enjoy the barbeque chicken pizza, jalapeno burger, can't go wrong with a pizookie for dessert. Looking to get a buzz, they do have a great selection of drinks. Haven't had a dish that I've tried and wasn't pleased."
Michael W.,"Las Vegas, NV",59,1,,5.0,12/15/2015,"I have been coming here for years with my girlfriend because of the top notch service we receive. Jillian, our bartender there, always greets us and takes our order promptly and knows regulars by name."
Phillip S.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,25,4,2.0,12/14/2015,Was once a great place to enjoy a great Happy Hour. They had good priced appetizers and a good selection. They changed all that. Prices are higher and portions have shrunk. With over 50 Happy Hours to choose from we won't be going back to BJ's.
Brooke K.,"Las Vegas, NV",194,29,29,5.0,9/14/2015,Jared B. was seriously the best server that I have ever had! He was fun and attentive! The Brussel sprouts were amazing!

Alicia S.,"Las Vegas, NV",51,2,2,2.0,7/16/2016,"I'm usually a fan of bjs but this was my first time at this location and I probably won't be back to this one. First my daughter ordered the chicken Alfredo she asked for NO broccoli when she got it there was broccoli on it. Second I ordered a cherry Pepsi I got that but asked for a little more grenadine on the side it took 20 min to get it cause he forgot about it. Then I wasn't sure what I wanted so the waiter recommend this one burger so I asked if it had there special sauce on it and he said no then I asked if there was cheese on it and he said yes then I asked what else was on it and he said just bbq sauce so I got that he didn't tell me anything else that was on there, well when I got my food it had no cheese it had the special sauce on it and he failed to tell me there was green peppers and chopped tomatoes and onions on it. We told them about my daughters and when the bill came I was still charged for her food. My husband got the triple decker and asked the waiter for No mayonnaise and when he got his there once again mayonnaise on it. I understand there are going to be mess ups and I'm ok with that but on everyone's food that I had with me is a little much if you don't remember what people ask for you sure need to write it down. And one more thing every time if we need anything he never stopped at the table it was just a walk by is everything ok or do u want dessert . Not a good waiter."
Donald P.,"Las Vegas, NV",19,76,,5.0,10/5/2014,"BJ's is always a great place to go eat, and drink if you choose.. Always great service. Nice menu, popular prices. Lots of TV's.  Love their burgers,. Soup and Salad a greart deal. Salads great,  Just enjoy BJ's.   A solid value. What more can one ask for,"
Mercedes C.,"Las Vegas, NV",10,11,6,5.0,9/27/2015,Very nice place. Friendly staff and food so good. Will definitely come back here. Planning allready to celebrate my birthday here soon. Will recommend to my friends and family to check this out
Danica D.,"Westside, Las Vegas, NV",98,21,11,5.0,9/19/2015,The New Orleans Jambalaya was on point! I had to send mad compliments to the chef. Let's not forget how scrumptious the Pizookies are! Yum yum!
Cinthia H.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,7,2,5.0,9/30/2015,"Had an amazing experience, Our waitress Taylor was so sweet and attentive. We will definitely be returning for the delicious food and exceptional service. (:"
Allison L.,"Las Vegas, NV",9,8,1,5.0,3/5/2015,Shawnda is one of the best servers ever.  She's attentive & friendly.  A must have are the avocado eggrolls.
Steve L.,"Henderson, NV",2,45,18,5.0,9/2/2014,"Just had a wonderful dinner here. Kris was our server, and she was absolutely wonderful! When visiting this location, be sure to ask for Kris and you will definitely get great service.  Be sure to sign up for emails to receive special offers."
Lloyd M.,"NV, NV",50,63,198,4.0,3/22/2014,Berry blast cider is the best. I come to this restaurant just for the cider. It is a little on the sweet side but it takes a little sweetness to bring out the fruity flavor of the berries. This is a nice sports bar with plenty of room for group get togethers. The food is good and the menu  is large enough everyone can find something they like. I will go back for the Berry Blast Cider.
Pamela C.,"Honolulu, HI",14,13,,5.0,12/9/2015,"Always good. Get their app, it allows you to get on their wait list, order take out, and decent discounts."
Craig T.,"Las Vegas, NV",24,14,7,5.0,5/12/2015,Always a pleasure. Great wait staff. Friendly and professional. Love the drinks. The beers are greats. Loyal customers. Great food also......
Jack W.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,18,1,3.0,11/26/2015,"I am a fan of BJ's but the quality of food can only go so far.  It seems that every time I dine there the service is passable at best.  There have been times that the waiters(waitresses) take over 10 minutes to check on us. I can understand to an extent if it is very busy as it usually is, but I raise my hand for all those minutes and even if my server is not around there are multiple others that can clearly see me looking for some help that do not come."
Sheldon L.,"Riverside, CA",93,121,18,3.0,3/13/2015,"Food was good/okay . Service was okay. It was a Friday night, so may have had a bigger crowd than normal. Will probably return."
Lindsey L.,"Las Vegas, NV",38,80,27,4.0,2/16/2014,"So this is my new favorite chain restaurant since Yard House has been going downhill with the service and consistency.  With that said, it isn't perfect. We have certainly gotten our share of inattentive servers (sorry to be sexist but the men tend to be the ones that leave us hanging for way too long, the women have been way more on top of their game here) and the hostess/seating people are fairly unfriendly. I always hate that the first experience walking in seems to be being ignored. Oh and the wait times can be insane, for that whole area of restaurants there, especially on a Friday/Saturday night......anyway, let's move on to the good shall we? The pizza - I think it is delicious, and this isn't even my favorite type of pizza, it is more of a deep dish, which I am usually not a fan of, but theirs is almost always pretty delicious. They had this mushroom, balsamic one that was SO FREAKING GOOD and I almost cried when I was told they took it off the menu, but alas, the Sweet Pig is pretty yummy too, so that is what we often get.  The other stuff - I have gotten some other dishes but honestly, I prefer the pizza over everything else. Can't really remember what I have ordered, which probably says something, but the last dozen times or so have been all about the pizza. Now on to the PIZOOKIES - Soooooooo yummy. Little pans of cookies served up warm with ice cream on top. We have even gone just for dessert a time or two, they are really that good. We also joined their rewards club and have earned enough points for free pizookies and $10 off our meals, so that is always a nice incentive to come back. They also run decent meal promos sometimes (something like soup or salad, pizza and pizookie for 2 for $20) so a super cheap lunch is always a good incentive too. The atmosphere is pretty typical for this type of restaurant, generally busy and somewhat loud, lots of TV's going, etc., but I find it to be a perfectly nice place to have a lunch or dinner out."
