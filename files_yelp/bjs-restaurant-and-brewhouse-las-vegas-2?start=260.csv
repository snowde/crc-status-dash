Andrew H.,"Las Vegas, NV",94,64,245,5.0,11/9/2012,"Good place to have an unplanned, spontaneous dinner at. My wife, son and I had the opportunity to do just that and we all had a fun time.  Our server Destiny, was great! She had great recommendations, especially with their seasonal Pumpkin Ale, which was absolutely delicious!  For apps we enjoyed crispy wontons, with tai dipping sauce & fried artichoke fritters. Wontons definitely won that battle. For entrees, my wife enjoyed a classic Bacon Burger, and I had the Parmesan Crusted Chicken, which was great. Its rather large, so just remember that when ordering.  For dessert we wanted a trio of Pazookies, and received 2 of which we ordered, and 1 which was not. They corrected the situation immediately which was nice. The one suggestion I will make is, I would love a brief description on the food after its delivered to the table by the food runners. Always nice to be reminded of what was ordered.  We had a great, laughter filled evening and will definitely come back. Thanks Destiny!"
David J.,"Las Vegas, NV",18,39,2,1.0,11/29/2015,"Not a fan at all... I've been here multiple times because I wanted to like it but I just can't, food is horrible especially the pizza and never once has my order been correct... I'm finished with this place."
Ryan S.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,7,,5.0,10/30/2015,Great atmosphere for catching the game or for a meetup. The pizookie is amazing just like everyone says. Nachos are bomb with some Jeremiah Red. Menu has a ton of options.
René M.,"Southwest, Las Vegas, NV",75,39,20,3.0,6/1/2014,Only reason why I did not give them 5 stars is because of the service. Our waitress took so long to even come to us after being seated that when she greeted us we all knew what we wanted to drink and order. After that it took about 10 minutes to get our drinks. We felt like when we flagged her down we would need to ask for everything because there was a chance we wouldn't see her again for another 20 minutes or so.  Usually get better service than this.  Food was good as always. Fettuccini Alfredo is yummy. I love the small bites. Got crispy artichokes and the bruschetta. If you don't eat a lot id recommend ordering some small bites and maybe sharing an entree with someone. That's a good amount.  As always order the pizookie for dessert! You can't pass on it. Good place to come with a group. Try their beers or do the beer sampler. Overall the food is good here. Service varies.
Miriam T.,"Las Vegas, NV",388,133,361,5.0,12/15/2011,"I've always been a fan of BJ's for many years.....ha ha!  starting from So Cal and now in Vegas. Does not matter which state or city... the atmosphere, the customer service, and even the food are all amazing. I like this location since its across the street from Red Rock Casino and in the Summerlin neighborhood.  Huge menu of appetizers, salads, pizzas, pastas, burgers, steaks, specialty entrees, etc.. I can go on and on. The menu is seriously like a book!  I am the type that if there is a lot to choose from, I tend to get overwhelmed and indecisive! Hmm what does Miriam feel in the mood for today.  I have tried many different entrees during the years and majority of the appetizers, and there is not an item that I did not like. All very tasty. I was craving MEAT recently, and I ordered their new ""Black & Bleu burger"" and my friend got the ""Crispy Jalapeno burger.""  The angus patty was SO JUICY! It hit the spot.  A MUST order is BJ's Famous PIZOOKIE. Pure DELICIOUSNESS.  Lots of flavors to choose from like red velvet, white chocolate macadamia nut, chocolate, and cookies n' cream. Well worth the calories!  I.

Rosanne B.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,13,,5.0,1/23/2015,Exceptional menu. They have everything from soup to nuts. Be prepared to be amazed at the number of choices on the menu. It's a fun environment. Their homemade soda is fantastic.  A perfect gathering place for a family meal.
Matt S.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,12,1,1.0,4/27/2016,"I used to like this place. I live nearby and was a regular. Today I walk in on Wednesday afternoon. The place is empty. They seat me at a small table so I ask for a larger one. The woman frowns, then sticks me in the worst corner table in the place. I walked out rather than debate the situation. You have lost a patron. There are too many good places that offer hospitality as well as good food in this area."
Jes S.,"Austin, TX",1,16,,3.0,7/11/2015,"It's like any other BJ's, it's fine, just not spectacular. Lunchtimes were always slammed and food took forever."
Kathleen C.,"Henderson, NV",83,29,47,2.0,6/11/2015,"First off the two stars are for the food otherwise i would give one star.  Just had lunch here with my best friend and I definitely regret it. It was lunch hour and I understand it gets busy. Out server was Jose R and he seemed very nice at first. He took our drink orders and gave us time to look at the menus. When my friend ordered, he implied there's no lunch special for pasta on the menu.  If there isn't then why is it on the menu saying there is? He must of been offended by our question because he only came by once after that. It took 25 minutes to get our food and we were limited on time so it made the experience worst. for TWENTY minutes we had yet to see a waiter pass by. Not one came and refilled our drinks. We had to get the attention of another waiter to tell our waiter to pay attention to us. Our lunch was ruined by bad customer service. Definitely not coming back to this BJ brewhouse again."
Jared W.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,5,,5.0,9/15/2014,"This restaurant will always be a favorite of mine. Before my father passed away, we used to come in at least once per week and would be greeted by three or more staff members before we were even seated. Seldom did we have inadequate service and the food always tasted great. After he retired, the highlight of his day would be to go to lunch and chat it up with his favorite waiters and hosts while enjoying some soup and salad. Your staff was so friendly and courteous to him, and I thank you for that.   I recently went back with my brother to catch up and, despite many new staff members, it was still an incredibly friendly environment with great service and delicious food. This BJs has a customer for life."
Janel I.,"Las Vegas, NV",21,24,6,4.0,2/24/2014,"I love BJ's restaurants but I have to shout this one out. The staff is always so accomodating and attentive!!  A bunch of friends, about 10 of us, were celebrating a birthday and came in one saturday afternoon dressed up as zombies and they didn't bat an eye! We were taken care of and not rushed at all.  Another Monday afternoon I had lunch with a friend and our server James was so great! No rushing through the lunch crowd, he treated us like we were his only customers. This BJ's is a great place for dinner before or after a movie at Red Rock; or anytime! BTW they have great drinks and specials :-)"
Ann B.,"TRINITY CTR, CA",38,52,,4.0,4/19/2015,"I ordered the roast beef dip, very good.  However, no one came back to refill water or soda, or to check if we needed anything else.  Still love the place, great atmosphere, wonderful food."
Sheila B.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,29,,3.0,1/19/2015,"I've picked up dinner three times; Twice the food was very good, once very bad.  Check your order before you leave; two of our salads were a watery mess with virtually no toppings, just lettuce.  I'm sure they would have re-done them, but didn't want to drive back.  The sandwiches and burgers have been very good, Jambalaya and salads, bad.  The pick up system is very convenient.  Just park in front at the designated spots, call the number posted, and the server comes to your car."
Jade W.,"Las Vegas, NV",677,1185,1232,4.0,7/26/2011,"The BF and I shared: Butterfly Shrimp basket. Came with about 12 big shrimp, coleslaw and fries. These were good, panko breaded and not greasy.  Small great white deep dish- More doughy almost like having pillowy bread with toppings than how Chicago style is. Good though.  Pizookie Trio- we got red velvet, chocolate macadamia, peanut butter. One plus is they don't skimp on the vanilla ice cream. I've never had these before as I don't really ever have space for dessert.  The service was great. Our server seemed to know how to pace themselves well in checking up on people and walking by to see if you need more drinks. The BF didn't know they make homemade sodas, but it was no issue for the server to switch to homemade rootbeer from ice tea. They brought us the check after putting our dessert order in so by the time we got dessert, we were all checked out. More servers need to do this! It's awesome not needing to wait for the check.    It's a decent chain specially if you like beers and homemade sodas."
Karen M.,"Phoenix, AZ",187,504,841,4.0,2/6/2014,"I'm pleasantly surprised by how good my food was here and how nice the servers were.  On previous visits, my food was lackluster and service matched that ambivalence.  Hubby and I wanted some calories NOW as we just finished a gnarly hike an hour prior.  He wanted a place to chill, enjoy a beer, and eat some comfort food.  Since BJ's was kinda sorta on our way home, we decided to check it out again.  I'm glad we did.  Hubby's steak salad was all that he wanted and my turkey burger and wedge fries hit the spot.  Service was nice and friendly.  I was amused to note that the staff who brought our food to our table assumed the ""chick"" ordered the salad.  HA HA.  NO.  I may be fun-sized, but I can put away a LOT of food, especially after a long day hike.  :) We enjoyed our calorie-induced coma whilst watching the Super Bowl on the many TV's in the restaurant.  It wasn't too crowded at all; I think most people were watching the game at home.  Great way to end a great hike."
Daniel L.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,5,,4.0,8/21/2015,"Very good, flatbread is very good. Google has calorie information online, and soon on the menu. The location is usually very loud, unless being in the backnroom. Make sure to order a pizooki."
Dave N.,"Las Vegas, NV",849,434,210,4.0,6/30/2013,"I don't know what took me so long to write a review on BJ's. I've been to many of their locations in the past, but it was never really anything memorable. Perhaps I wasn't paying attention. Recently, a friend and I came to this location for dinner. I like the beer selection (both in-house and other craft brews).  The food was awesome! I had a steak that was cooked to my liking. The best part is my friend got the Jambalaya. She raved about it before we arrived, but I didn't really pay much attention. I tried a bite and was floored at how savory, spicy and perfect this dish tasted. The menu is quite diverse. You'll find something for everyone. Service is good. This is a great ""go to"" spot if you are in the area. Don't miss the jambalaya."
Niki M.,"Las Vegas, NV",42,164,133,4.0,5/25/2012,Busy place in the evenings.  Server was good. Food was good.  I will go back to try something different.
Edith Z.,"Las Vegas, NV",38,70,69,5.0,3/29/2015,Food here is great. The service is always exceptional! I've dined here twice with my family and each time was impressed with the service. I will definitely be back. Thank you and keep up the great work
