Krysten D.,"Summerlin, Las Vegas, NV",42,3,,5.0,4/3/2016,Service is always excellent and food is always on point. And that salted caramel pizookoe ooooohhh :)
Amir A.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,63,9,1.0,4/23/2014,"Ate here a few times and everything was excellent. Decided to dine here tonight and ordered the same thing I always do, Avocado Egg-rolls and Moroccan Spiced Salmon. Egg-rolls arrived and they tasted weird. Couldn't figure out what was wrong with them. When the entree arrived, it looked as if it had been dropped on the floor and then re-plated. I pointed out to the server that it looked like a disaster and her response was ""Yes, they do throw allot of stuff in there"". I took a few bites and it just tasted horrible. Sent it back and within a hour I was sick beyond belief. Not sure if it was the egg-rolls or the salmon but I'll never eat here again. They should have better controls to check the food quality before serving it. It only takes one time to lose a customer, especially when you get food poisioning.  However, the server was very friendly. After I sent the food back she came and told me that it didn't look right (wondering why they didn't see this when they served it to me). If I ever decide I need a full body cleanse I'll make sure to dine here again."
Elizabeth H.,"Las Vegas, NV",181,247,50,2.0,2/6/2014,"Our waiter: I wish I knew his name. I could barely hear him when he spoke. He was whispering/mumbling and we had to ask him multiple times to repeat himself.  We all ordered burgers, which a couple of us sent back. I have never seen a hamburger patty like these. First off, they weren't even circular, so they were falling out of the buns and all over the place. They weren't thick at all, but smashed down and falling apart and so thin in some places. They sent us new burgers after we told them, and the second round came out exactly the same. They hadn't even listened! We left a little disgruntled. Don't get the burger."
Demariyea M.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,8,1,2.0,7/21/2015,"Ordered the chicken fettuccine it wasn't worth the money. Along with there being a small spider on our table , place wasn't as good as people made it seem."
Greg B.,"Chicago, IL",0,33,9,4.0,4/25/2014,"Bar tables are good to see TV and mingle.  Love the happy hour prices Every time we come, we try something different on the menu and are usually pleased with the taste and temperature.  Staff and manager seem to care about making sure things are right.  So if you don't like something, they are usually willing to help make it a better experience for you."
Rachel B.,"Austin, TX",611,473,960,3.0,4/22/2013,"I I really enjoy BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse.  I had actually never been to one until I met my hubby a few years back and boy was I missing out!  I'm glad he showed me the light! The menu for BJ's is quite extensive and has something for everyone in your group.  Their pizzas are fabulous and come in so many different varieties or you can design your own.  My fave would be the White Pizza.  Anything with Alfredo sauce and I am in love.  My husband disagrees and always goes for the Classic Combo pizza.  It is good too, but not as pretty as the White Pizza.  Looks aren't everything, I know, but it is true in this case! They also have a ton of other things from burgers, sandwiches, steaks, brunch (on the weekends), lunch specials Monday-Friday, and even low cal choices.  I don't anything about those because I am a full fat kinda girl, which is probably why I'm not a size 2.  They even have  french fry options!  Now that is just awesome because sometimes you want skinny fries and sometimes you want wedge ones.  GENIUS! And of course, they have a ton of beer!  They make about a dozen different beers and even switch it up throughout the year in the different seasons.  For you non-boozers, they also make their own root beer, cream soda, orange cream soda, and black cherry cream soda.  I always go for the cream soda and I am always happy. The service is usually ok, but it does waver, which is why I gave this location 3 stars.  Food alone is easily 4 stars, but the service knocks it down.  Sometimes you go in and your server is on it, but sometimes, like this past weekend, it was a diaster.  Our food took 40 minutes to come out.  Some of it was hot, some lukewarm, and one had been under a heat lamp for way too long.  We were all so hungry (Warning, do not mess with my family when we are hungry because you WILL get hurt!), we didn't send it back because we were afraid it would take another 40 minutes and we had plans afterwards.  We were not the only ones with this problem either, as I heard the tables around us all complaining about the same things we were talking about.  The manager on duty wasn't particular helpful either and we didn't even see him until we were already 35 minutes into the wait.  We asked him about the food situation and he tried to make a joke and then blew us off.   I would say 80% of the time you will have a great experience, so definitely try it out.  And get some cream soda too!"
Jennifer W.,"Pomona, CA",29,18,1,5.0,3/28/2015,Went in last night with a party of 18. Donna and Courtney are amazing. Thank you for being so accommodating. Was a great experience.
James S.,"Los Angeles, CA",711,1205,474,3.0,8/17/2011,"A better Chili's. This is the type of restaurant that keeps people from fitting into their clothes.  I generally don't go to places like BJ's because everything is so full of fat, lard, fried you-name-it and portions are always large. I realize I am not their target demo here, but still was happy to come here for lunch to splurge a bit. The server gets a Star for the various things I threw at him: Changing which Fries I wanted after already placing the order; Side of jalapenos; and the biggie---- having my California Burger delivered deconstructed so that I could pick and choose what I wanted.  He went one step further and put the cheese on the bread, and had the bread completely separate from my burger. This was a great way to enjoy the burger. The burger itself seemed a smallish 1/2 LB and very thin. Consequently, not terribly juicy --- but not bad. The in-house Root Beer was good and refills came without request. The desserts looked good and others seemed to like them. I did taste the Grilled Salmon which seemed pretty healthy and tasted fine but nothing too exciting. Steak Fries are well-seasoned and a nice change of pace. I glanced at their 'Chicago-style Deep Dish Pizza'. Optimistic thinking, I'd say.  Very friendly staff."
Marlena G.,"Las Vegas, NV",121,22,7,4.0,5/14/2015,"Had take out , and although the avocado rolls are very good I think they had a recipe change because they use to be very sweet and now they are kind spicy. They have very good salads and pizza !"
Clayton K.,"Las Vegas, NV",97,112,2,5.0,7/1/2013,"BJs is as close as you're going to get to pleasing everyone. Neat subtly communist decor in a very large restaurant. Came in on a Sunday afternoon and got right into the bar. Lots of TVs with sports, and bizarrely clustered taps. They have a spectacular selection of beer; including their own which is usually quite good. They have several different samplers, including one with enough sizable samples to tranquilize Nancy Grace during a double murder trial. And they really mean full bar. In fact, they mean full everything. The secret of BJs is it's menu; everything is really pretty good, and that's a feat because they have a huge diversity of entrees. If you have that friend in your group who has specialized diet concerns and can only eat blue foods from islands that don't feature indigenous amphibians BJs can feed them. BJs is great for large groups for exactly that reason: everyone gets what they want. No matter how stupid it is. Mega Bonus: The waiter split our check with no muss nor fuss. Always impressive in the land of the unified restaurant bill.  It may not have a ton of personality, but if you need lots of either different types of food or a huge selection of beer it'd be hard to go wrong."
Jennifer H.,"Las Vegas, NV",35,88,10,5.0,4/8/2015,"This was our first time at this location. We ordered the balsamic chicken, chicken alfredo, sliders and gourmet Mac and cheese. All of the food was fantastic! We had a few requests, and they were given to us with no issues. I forget our server's name, but he was a very nice young man and did a great job. We will definitely be going back."
Love D.,"Las Vegas, NV",176,17,7,5.0,5/12/2012,Friday nights are really packed.  food is great!! a must get is the Pizzookie (sp?)  my fave is the white chocolate macadamia nut.  Another favorite of mine is the balsamic chicken entree off the 500 calorie menu. I can't remember exactly what it was called but it's bomb!  The happy hour menu is ok.  Beer is good! Service is excellent!
David S.,"Manhattan, NY",22,123,,3.0,10/27/2013,"The food is very good, but that's not the big takeaway.  This is NOT a good place for kids, and by kids I mean anyone who needs a highchair.  They do not have functioning highchairs at this restaurants. They have about a half dozen broken chairs, which of course serve no purpose.  This has been for about a year now. The food though is quite good.  Tuscan Chicken Limone is solid, and should be ordered if it appeals to you.  Also, don't leave without dessert.  The pizzas though are overrated.   Enjoy, but leave the kiddos at home."
Necktar F.,"Woodbridge, VA",0,23,,4.0,3/21/2016,Pretty good casual dining. I will repeat.
Debbie N.,"Las Vegas, NV",693,352,1545,4.0,3/23/2011,"To start out, the only BJ's that I have been to before this is across the street from MGM Grand. So to come to this compared to that, this place is impressive.  I came for a baby shower for a friend and we had a section in the back side area, where there were other bigger parties. They had set-up a buffet table so when the food was ready we just went up and grabbed what we liked. I'm usually not a fan of potato skins but it was really good because they were crispy. The other food items, such as wings, pizza, and salad were nothing special.  The best part of the restaurant is the service. The servers were so nice and I felt like it was my very own neighborhood restaurant. I would def come back to try their regular menu."
Joni W.,"Las Vegas, NV",108,130,119,4.0,8/25/2013,"Get 4 finicky female foodies together and you better find a place that has something for everyone.  BJ's usually provides a good fix.  Since we're usually starving by the time we meet up, appetizers are a big deal.  Because there's a BBQ thing going on, we tried the corn fritters with a special aioli (light textured fritters, with just enough corn...not so much that it makes it too dense and chewy).  The calamari was flash fried and tender, with a barely-there seasoned batter.  At first, the chicken lettuce wraps didn't look like it would be enough to share, but we all had at least two wraps each, doused with the hot mustard for some bite.  Good experience, so glad it's in our neighborhood.  Tip:  Send someone in to sign up for a table while you find parking; get a head start."
John F.,"Las Vegas, NV",201,236,26,4.0,2/24/2013,"Weren't planning on dropping into BJ's for a late lunch (or early dinner) but the other place we wanted to go had a long wait. There was a bit of a wait at BJ's for tables but we were able to grab a spot in the bar area with no wait. Server was friendly and food is as expected at BJ's... consistent and fair priced. Ordered two small plates, the mozzarella and tomato salad and the bruschetta bites. Both were really good and were a nice starter at just a few bucks each. Ordered the grilled burger melt with wedge fries and Kacey had the BBQ pulled pork sandwich. Both were good and my burger was cooked just how I asked. Of course one of the best reasons to go to BJ's is for the beer. I'm a big fan of the Blonde... one of best light beers I've had. All in all, good service, good food and good drinks... BJ's is a solid option any night."
Wayne G.,"Las Vegas, NV",207,504,204,3.0,9/4/2011,"Service is good, beers are good but $5 for a small draft beer is a total rip off!  The thin crust pizzas are very good, ribs were just OK, Dave's BBQ ribs are far better.  Good 80s music selection.  Very cool and hip atmosphere. Wayne Gorsek"
Alexy R.,"Las Vegas, NV",357,143,113,3.0,11/23/2014,"Stopped in for a quick lunch today with my family, I had the soup and salad combo (no refills on weekends), wedge salad was watery and small, I'd rather order from Outback. The clam chowder was actually really good and filling, can't complain for $7.95. Next time I'll stick to avocado egg rolls and the pasta which are always good."
Robyn L.,"Las Vegas, NV",119,294,298,4.0,2/27/2011,"Never disappoints. Excellent Chicago style pizza. Crispy on the edges...chewy and gummy in the middle. Yum.  We also had Italian market salad. It was a little overdressed and a bit salty but hearty and flavorful.  I personally love the berry burst cider on draught. Crisp and refreshing.  I don't know when this happened  but they now offer a pizookie trio. This was perfect when the three of us couldn't decide on flavor!  We got three individual smaller versions for $9! Yippee!  4 beers, a salad, a pizza and the pizookie trio cost us $78 with tip.  Always busy in there so expect a wait. The trick is to seat yourself in the bar."
