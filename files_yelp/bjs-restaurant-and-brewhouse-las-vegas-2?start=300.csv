Dirk T.,"Cheltenham, Canada",0,14,,3.0,5/11/2014,"Service was good, food was... Ok. Ordered a medium rare steak which was medium only. The presentation was not so great. Also ordered Angel hair pasta tasted like mr noodles with a lot of oil.  California burger was good but a bit on the oily side.  Kale and Brussels spout salad with blackened salmon was good.  Overall experience was ok, the waitress was friendly and forthcoming."
Hannah S.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,6,8,5.0,5/8/2014,"I've always enjoyed my experience at BJs. I've been going there occasionally for four years and the service has never let me down. They're always friendly :) Plus, there's a large variety of pizza, beer, burgers, salads, pasta, and meat (steak, ribs) to try. And you can't leave without ordering a pizookie ;) trust me."
Andrea A.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,5,,4.0,3/22/2015,"I like going there,  but I would love going there if they would bring back their original ribs. These ribs were so good,  melting in tour mouth and not to sweet,  not spicy, then they changed the recipe and now they are so spicy that I can't enjoy them anymore. Otherwise they have great food,  super service."
Nora F.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,6,,5.0,3/14/2014,"My first time here and it didn't disappoint! The food was delicious. My husband and I got burgers and wings, and the wings were fantastic! They were crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Make sure to order them tossed or they will only drizzle the sauce on top (wouldn't be enough sauce). The burgers were perfectly cooked and were huge! Had to take half home. Next time, we're going to try the pizza!"
Carl S.,"Las Vegas, NV",51,105,3,3.0,12/1/2014,"The beers are very nice.  Always good.  The pizza is deep dish and the pans are nicely seasoned as to give the crust a buttery flavor.  The service here is great.  On the down side, it can get a bit noisy with the high ceilings and hard surfaces, but hey it is casual dining."
Joeli C.,"American Fork, UT",0,8,2,1.0,3/5/2016,"We have gone to this restaurant many times and every time we wonder why. They are so slow and if you have more than four people, be prepared to wait for at least an hour. With all the options nearby, don't go here. Last time for us."
Alice C.,"Palmdale, CA",1851,280,506,4.0,12/13/2014,I must say this is one of the nicest  bj I have ever been in the service  is better than all the others I have been in my waitress was at our table every five minutes to check on us. BJ'S IN SUMMERLIN AWESOME
Kelsey P.,"San Diego, CA",98,197,37,5.0,12/6/2014,"Jared was awesome! This was my first time to this location and it was really nice. Most other ones I have been too seem very crowded and not a lot of space but this location is spacious in the bar and restaurant area.  The food was great as always, the service was awesome and the atmosphere was good.  My aunt goes a lot and she was surprised how empty it seemed to be but even with a few larger parties and people sitting near us, it was not overly noisy!"
J D.,"Anaheim Hills, CA",4957,1982,28926,4.0,10/11/2010,"This is rapidly becoming one of my favorite places to have lunch on Sundays.  They have Happy Hour all day long during the NFL Football games. This visit we ordered the Pulled Pork Sliders ($5.75 happy hour price) and BJ's Favorite Mini Pizza ($5.00 happy hour price).  To wash it down, I had an IPA. The food came out quickly.  I ordered the Pulled Pork Sliders and dove right into it.  They were awesome!  The combination of Pulled Pork, Onion Ring Strings, and tangy BBQ Sauce went well together.  The Onion Ring strings had a nice sweet taste and the BBQ Sauce was tangy and balanced the palate.....the Pulled Pork was very juicy and full of flavor.  Sooo good.  I ordered Wedge Cut Fries with the Sliders and they were cooked just right....not under/over cooked. My Mom couldn't finish her Pizza, so she gave me the last couple of bites.....it was very good as well.  The thick crust was soft & buttery with the edges slightly crispy....hmmmm! Overall, another awesome experience @ BJ's! Will I return?  Hell ya!"
Evy M.,"Las Vegas, NV",42,12,2,5.0,2/23/2015,This place has the best salad by far. I am so not a salad person :) but the Santa fe salad is to die for. I love coming here with the family or on a date night. It is very hard to find places where the kiddos can eat and enjoy being themselves ....you know just kids and this place is on my top for both. Oh and the service is outstanding. On a date night my husband and I had some drinks and where chatting along when we didn't realize that the food was taking a little longer than usual (mind you the place was pact) well the manager came over and apologized for the inconvenience and gave us a huge discount! !!! Way to feel welcome :)
Kristy B.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,1,1,1.0,9/21/2014,"Don't ever make the mistake of going to this place to watch your football game on Sunday!!! I have never experienced such rude people - the bartender and the manager. I could go on and on, just save yourself the aggravation. This place clearly doesn't know anything about football and it's fans."
Kami A.,"Las Vegas, NV",58,22,18,4.0,11/7/2014,We haven't been in a while. I had the fish and chips. Mostly for the fish and not the French fries. The fish was so crunchy and the tarter sauce has some spice to it now which is a yummy surprise. I would definitely recommend the fish for sure!
Jay A.,"Las Vegas, NV",269,439,652,4.0,4/27/2013,"So if you can past the semi obscene name of this place, you are in for a great selection of food and beer. They also have a loyalty program worth joining. To be clear this is not fine dinning but it is often better than the other chains in this space. So if you want to get out of the casinos and go to a casual dinning restaurant and pretend like you live in a normal town, this is a good choice. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"
Ivan R.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,8,,4.0,2/10/2016,"We were there yesterday with a large party of 13 ppl. A lady Toni was our server. I could not believe how professional she was and outstanding service. We were such a headache with our party with like 5 separate checks and people trying to use coupons, but she seems to be on top of everything and extremely nice! Most servers would have lost it. It was my sons birthday and he had a great time. Only reason I'm not giving 5 is because we did have to wait 45 mins to be seated."
C G.,"Seattle, WA",14,154,60,5.0,11/12/2014,Fabulous food.  Parmesan  crusted chicken and twisted blt spinach salad were amazing! Service is top notch. We are from Washington so sadly can't eat here often. Open concept with great music. Great strawberry majors too and beers.
M. L.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,13,3,1.0,5/15/2015,"I am a Vegas native and was a long time customer of this restaurant. I would like to share with you my terrible, and last experience, I will have with this establishment. I met two important people for dinner and we were ""served"" by Cinnamon O. We are familiar with outstanding service.. being connected with several five star establishments and companies. At the end of our meal we decided to mention the profoundly dismissive attitude and lack of regard for our experience with Bjs Brewery. The manager apologized and we appreciated the responsive communication, however, I will not be returning to this restaurant. Please take into consideration that body language, such as rolling your eyes at customers and having a  blatant lack of manners is not what this company expects of its employees. Head over to Yard house or the BJs in centennial area where we have never been mistreated for a better dining experience."
Dickie D.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,28,,5.0,1/23/2015,My favorite place in Vegas!  I get the pizza every time and am never disappointed.  Gluten free items too which aren't always easy to find.  Beer is awesome too.  Can't wait to go back....maybe tonight!
Allen M.,"Las Vegas, NV",1749,309,1481,3.0,6/12/2013,"Can't say anything bad about the place. The food is okay. I brought my daughter with some of her friends there after the movies. They ordered chicken strips, French dip, burgers, and a big cookie desert. They seemed to enjoy the meal. It was a good place to bring the kids."
Jessica M.,"Henderson, NV",20,35,11,5.0,11/14/2014,BJs is always amazing! Tonight we had a server named Jared S. Excellent service :) he was engaging and prompt!!! We waited for about an hour to be seated; it was well worth it to get excellent service!
Kristina O.,"Cypress, CA",98,349,45,5.0,11/19/2010,"I've been to BJ's probably over 10 times, and I've always been consistently impressed by their food. I've had so many pizzas, pastas, tacos, and desserts from their that I've lost count, but I will showcase some of their highlights.  I usually don't get appetizers from BJ's because their food is in really large portions, so I'm full by those alone, but I've gotten their chicken tenders before, and they're really good. They're nice and crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside like you'd expect. They also give you this tangy honey mustard dipping sauce with them which is a great complement. They also come with a mountain of french fries. The fries don't taste too good with the honey mustard, so I usually just ask for ranch dressing for them... because I think ranch is the perfect dipping sauce for fries, not gross ketchup. Their pizza is great. If there is a long wait, and you have to sit in the waiting area, the servers will come out with deep dish pizzas put up into individual bite sized pizzas for the crowd to sample while waiting. I think this is epicly nice of them because I would be perfectly willing to wait, but it's always nice to snack on a little slice of pizza too. hehe.  I usually just stick with pepperoni pizza. It's a classic and is loaded with lots of meaty pepperoni, stringy cheese, and hearty tomato sauce. Normally, I hate tomato sauce on pizza, seriously, the less sauce the better, but with BJ's pizza, their sauce is so flavorful that the abundance of it is fine with me! Their barbecue chicken pizza is really solid as well. I've had it a couple of times. I like CPK's BBQ chicken pizza better, but this is a nice deep dish take on it. Next time I go, I need to try the buffalo chicken pizza to see how that compares to various ones that I've had. Maybe I can persuade my boyfriend to go there this weekend. hmm... The sandwiches are really yummy. Their pulled pork is really tender and not dry at all. The Cobb sandwich is tasty too with the addition of bacon, cause everything tastes better with a littler... err... a lot of bacon on it. The BJ's burger is great, but you should definitely add bacon to this one for the reason that I mentioned above. Their parmesan crusted chicken is delicious. It's very cheesy, and their mashed potatoes are very creamy. Their fish tacos are great too. They go great with a side of strawberry lemonade to drink. So... as if this review wasn't long enough... DESSERT! First off, get a pizookie. I've seen some of my friends' pictures on facebook where they've gone to BJ's and they've ordered something like the apple crisp for dessert. I've shaken my head at those pictures many times. Seriously, you don't know what you're missing unless you get the pizookie! It's the best part of the meal. I always get Triple Chocolate Pizookie with Ghirardelli chocolate. My boyfriend and I split it, and it's pure decadence even after you claim that you're so full that you can't eat dessert.  So yeah... this was a really long review, but I've been here so many times, and I really wanted to share how much I love BJ's. I will definitely be back soon."
