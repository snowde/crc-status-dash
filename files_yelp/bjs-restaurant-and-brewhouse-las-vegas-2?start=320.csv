Stephanie K.,"Spring Valley, Las Vegas, NV",42,2,,5.0,12/22/2013,We took my mother in law here for brunch before a movie at Red Rock. I'm still rather new to Vegas but I'm learning my way around. This was my first time in BJs.  This place was packed and I know why. The food was phenomenal and the price cannot be beat especially for Vegas. 3 meals plus an appetizer and our bill was under 35$. I thought the server had messed it up but when I checked everything was there. By far the best onion straws in the valley. Yes I am becoming an onion straw expert.  The plates are well sized and the food was so good. We will definitely be back.
Taeler H.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,56,4,5.0,12/18/2014,"Great service even when they are very busy. We were seated immediately in the bar area and our server (can't recall his name, started with an M) was great! We redeemed our coupon for a free pizookie too. Great experience!"
Jennifer M.,"Las Vegas, NV",714,98,59,3.0,5/25/2014,"The only thing on their menu that is outstanding are the Avocado Eggrolls. These are a must. All of their food is okay, I guess I'd say good, but it's a bit boring. Something I can't describe. Eat here 10 times (including takeout) and you're burnt out. Takeout is usually ready on time, but there's usually a wait on the weekend which is scary bc this place is scary big. So imagine how long it usually takes to get your food. I much more prefer this place for lunch. They have lunch specials and there isn't usually a wait. Service can be spotty, depends on who you get and wether they're hungover. If you are unfortunate enough to go on the weekend try to grab a seat in the bar if you don't want to wait close to an hour for mediocre food. But make sure you flag a server down or you won't get service for a while (we've waited a half an hour for a server in the bar before)."
Teri C.,"Las Vegas, NV",1629,1012,2245,4.0,4/30/2010,"Happy hour at BJ's Restaurant Brewhouse is worth a look! Offered on Mondays through Fridays from 3 pm to 7 pm, and reverse happy hour on Sundays through Thursdays from 10 pm to closing. $1 off all Draft Beer and Cocktails Half off all Mini Pizzas $2 off all appetizers (BJ's Snacks & Small Bites not included) You can only take advantage of their happy hour in the bar area - so cozy up to the booth or the high tables! For our party of three, we shared three flatbreads and we enjoyed them all! * Fresh Basil with Italian Sausage ""Mozzarella, Fontina and Parmesan cheeses, fresh basil with a hint of oregano, sliced Roma tomatoes and a touch of Italian sausage."" ($8.95) * California Club ""Grilled chicken, crisp Applewood smoked bacon, tomatoes and mozzarella cheese.  Drizzled with roasted garlic aioli and topped with fresh diced avocado."" ($8.95) * Grilled Chicken Pesto ""Basil pesto sauce drizzled over mozzarella and fresh Parmesan cheeses then topped with grilled chicken, red onions and sun-dried tomatoes."" ($8.95) I can't remember which one was my favorite, but I know we were impressed by all of them and happily finished them. I also enjoyed their Double Berry (10 oz) ""Berry Burst Cider & Lindeman's Framboise"" ($5.95), which is part of the HH.  It definitely gets packed though during these hours, so get in there early.  We barely got up from our booth when another party was happy to take it over.  It's a busy restaurant with means the noise level is high and parking can be challenging."
Sheila G.,"Las Vegas, NV",489,690,1218,3.0,10/2/2010,"I've only been to a BJ's once - in San Diego - but had never tried the one in Las Vegas until last night.   It was Thursday night, and this place was jammed - pretty good, considering the economy, so I figured I was in for some super food.  I wasn't blown away by the meal, and the service was sub-par. I had a turkey burger.  I didn't want fries, so I was able to substitute steamed broccoli.  The burger was okay - not bad, but as bland as could be.  It came with Swiss and slices of avocado, lettuce and tomato.   Nothing to complain about, but nothing to rave about, either.  The broccoli, though, was inedible.  It was partially cooked, but not that crisp, delicious stuff that Chinese restaurants do so well.  This was RUBBER.  I had the waitress bring me mashed potatoes instead.  They were good, but too salty (What else is new?).  My friend had the turkey burger, too, and felt the same way about hers - Average. Our husbands both had Parmesan-crusted chicken, and they were satisfied.  Again, nothing to rave about. I just don't get it.  There are so many places in town that have above-average food.  They offer hefty discounts.  And they're empty.  In my humble opinion, BJs, which rarely has coupons, has a menu that's not much different from any other similar chain restaurant, and has food and service that doesn't distinguish itself in any way, has a steady stream of customers.  And judging by the Thursday night crowd, probably has lines out the door on the weekends.  I think it's kind of sad."
Barikzai Z.,"Las Vegas, NV",5,23,2,4.0,5/30/2012,"I didnt know this place existed around here. I absolutely love their fried artichokes appetizer which is totally worth $4. I would also recommend their clam chowder (around $8)  MAKE SURE TO ORDER IN A BREAD BOWL. They toast the bread and make it very tasty. I am not a big fan of their pizza, but overall good food. Very busy especially in the evenings. Make sure to call and ask how long the wait.  ***BE SURE TO END THE MEAL WITH A PIZOOKIE :)"
Jason C.,"Centennial, Las Vegas, NV",10,64,28,1.0,11/22/2014,ate there tonight! Was happy all food was great! 2 problems dinner took 1 hour and 40 minutes from when I was seated! 2 I ordered a house salad with ranch I ate the whole thing it was yummy....... My wings came next I ate those too very good! As I sat for what seemed forever for the 3 small pazookies we ordered for our extremely well behaved considering it took so long children I went to move dishes out of way because no one bothered to clear my table the ranch cup was stuck to table! I lifted it to reveal what I thought was wax! I thought to myself wow good idea to stop from sliding........ Upon further inspection by removing I began to realize a firmiliar smell it was ........ Mint! Wtf? Why was there gum under my ranch cup? Gross asked for a manager he gave us 3 free kids pazookies! Big deal? Was this to make me feel better? It was gross! Never going back ever and calling SNHD Monday morning
Nikki Rose T.,"Las Vegas, NV",277,234,663,3.0,4/27/2010,"The environment can be chill or loud, depending on when you go. They have TVs everywhere, which are great for watching football on Sundays. They do take big groups, but told us they could only separate the checks 4 ways max. Also, parking is a pain during busy evenings/weekends, especially since it is right next to Olive Garden. I do not like their pastas. The pizza is delicious. The strawberry lemonade is fantastic, but they can never seem to make a good batch consistently. The pizookie (white chocolate & macadamia is my fave) is unforgettable. I go here often, usually with friends, but it is far from my favorite. Their food is good, but none that I would ever be yearning for. After you get all the blowjob jokes out of the way, don't forget to order a pizookie. It's the one ""for sure"" dish they have."
Alison V.,"Minooka, IL",762,579,549,4.0,12/12/2010,"Much better than expected.  We got the brush-off from the first server, I guess she didn't want to deal with a handicapped, old, quirky family member that was dining with us. Our second server was perky and funny.  They ran out of both the homemade root beer and homemade cream soda and it was a running joke for the rest of the meal.  BTW, the homemade orange cream soda was great. I had a salad that was huge and flavorful, and the other two diners had fish and chips, which again were an enormous portion.  We split a mini deep dish pizza which we said on numerous occasions that it was supposed to be served as an appetizers.  We even ordered it 15 minutes before our entrees.  Low and behold, it came out at the same time as the entrees. As for the drinks, the Frosty Peach was amazing.  I would go again just to get hammered on the drinks."
Deysi O.,"Las Vegas, NV",5,17,6,1.0,5/16/2014,Food sucked no flavor at all. Everyone hated their food .. service was not their from the minute we walked in .
Savannah R.,"Pahrump, NV",109,322,55,5.0,3/27/2012,"One word: Pazooki. If you dont try this dessert you are missing out! Prices are great, quality and taste of food is excellent, happy hour prices are decent, and the staff is outstanding."
Christina W.,"Centennial, Las Vegas, NV",88,24,7,5.0,3/8/2014,"The food was delicious and the service fantastic! I've been to the Centennial Hills location and it is very good, yet it pales in comparison to the experience I've had today at this location. I'm so pleased that I would consider going out of my way to go here."
Susan L.,"Las Vegas, NV",377,672,1934,4.0,7/31/2010,Bj's is one of my favorite places to go for happy hour 3pm-7pm (I think). Their Garlic Kettle Parmesan chips on the small bites menu is one of the regular items I like to order. It's a good size portion that can easily feed three people. It comes with caramelized onion dip and a buffalo sour cream. I prefer the caramelized onion dip because it doesn't take away from  the flavor of the chips. Their mini deep dish pizzas are delicious and cheap during happy hour. Their appetizer portions are enough to make you so full that sometimes you don't have room for their Pizookie! I also found out that they can make the Pizookie into a half ..half order. It's helpful when you share this with someone who is the complete opposite of you because they can customize it to your liking. I find eating here during happy hour is sometimes cheaper than eating fast food and it's more filling.
John M.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,5,,1.0,5/15/2015,Horrible customer service in regards to seating disabled people! They disregard the disability and seat you where they want not to the needs of the customer. No attempt to accommodate! One star due to I had to rate otherwise it would be a zero! Contacted manager who was more interested in reservations then a now former disabled patron!
Mullet S.,"Auburn Hills, MI",0,9,4,5.0,9/18/2015,"Fucking delicious. I went for lunch and had the soup and salad, some amazing choices.  Great beer selection but priced so you only want to have a couple."
Lions D.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,43,6,5.0,10/10/2014,First time here and decided to stop for lunch. Got the soup and salad lunch special. Great choices of soup and salad. And didn't have to wait like at Olive Garden for soup and salad. Very good and will be back.
Bryan D.,"Las Vegas, NV",157,236,58,4.0,9/7/2012,"A nice place to go to get a steak or salad later in the evening.  Unfortunately, they close at 11pm. I have had nothing but good service here and I prefer this place over the Yard House simply because it is not loud and overbearing at night.   On the many visits here, I've had the Turkey Burger (it was moist and delicious), the Rib-Eye at medium rare (perfect!), the Thai Chicken Mango Salad, (the sweet dressing really makes it POP with bright flavor, and the Santa Fe Salad (the fire roasted red peppers, jack / cheddar cheese, avocado and corn make this Santa Fe Salad one of my top Southwestern Salad favorites out of any restaurant...) For desert, we sometimes get the PIZZOOKIE!  Chocolaty goodness is yours to behold!  Definitely try it if you have room for it at the end.  It's very worth it. The servers are usually quick and on top their game.  The restaurant is very clean and neat.  The ambiance is very casual and perfect for a date. I'll be coming back here for sure."
Kacy T.,"Henderson, NV",91,20,,3.0,6/17/2012,"Went to this restaurant for dinner with the hubby - loved the food but the service could have been better.  I ordered the sampler of beer which was fun. I always love getting the sampler at Yardhouse and was happy to see they had one here as well. As an appetizer I started with the Ahi poke bowl - it was perfectly dressed and the tuna was super fresh. I always order this dish  anywhere it is on the menu and I can say this was the best I have ever had. I had the mini caprese salad next also fantastic - they used a very creamy mozzarella and it was the perfect portion for a midcourse. For my entree I had the buffalo chicken pizza -super thick crust and a nice drizzle of ranch on top. Not only did it look like a work of art but it tasted fantastic too.  Now my husband was not as happy with the meal as I was.Ffirst the waitress convinced him not to order the beer battered shrimp that he wanted and talked him into a pulled pork sandwich which he didn't really enjoy. The biggest issue however was the timing of the food delivery. Or salads were brought out before the appetizers were even half way finished and the entrees came out not even 3 minutes later. We were sitting there with 6 plates of food on the table. W e enjoy going out once a week for a ""date night"" and like to take our time and enjoy our meal. We definitely felt like we were being rushed. Overall the great food way outweighed the lack of basic service and I would go back again. Next time I'll request to space out the courses."
Matthew M.,"Las Vegas, NV",39,2,8,5.0,7/30/2014,Go to place for dinner. Since I don't cook! Lol. Great service and amazing food and drinks.
Jen K.,"West Linn, OR",505,1915,6260,3.0,12/14/2009,"Our trip to Vegas ended with neither a bang nor a whimper and that was fine by me. After spending time at Red Rocks Canyon, we wanted a simple dinner before heading to the airport to catch our flight. We initially went to The Vintner Grill, but that was way too upscale for what we had in mind. We'd been hiking all day and I wasn't feeling (or looking) swanky. While I prefer non-chain options, this brewpub clearly has their act together. BJ's has a sports bar feel and an enormous projection TV above the bar as well as multiple flat screens throughout the large restaurant. Sunday night brought out people in droves, and I can understand why, since this place seems equally enjoyable for families, singles and groups. It was a great place to watch some football and the restaurant just hums with activity. The service was incredibly efficient and we saw the entire staff hustling. What is unfortunate is that the food isn't nearly as special as the atmosphere and service. Mr. K ordered a beer and I had to be different and chose hard cider, but neither was great. One of their specialties is deep dish pizza and again it was only OK. For the standard entrees, portion sizes are enormous and I was happy we shared dessert since the BJ's Brownie is served piled high with whipped cream. For the food alone, this is a three-star joint, but it really doesn't give this place enough credit. It would be a semi-regular hangout if they were located in my home town. Funnily enough, my local sports bar has a very similar name."
