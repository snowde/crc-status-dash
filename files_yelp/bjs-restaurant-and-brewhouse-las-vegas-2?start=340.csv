Vegas J.,"Henderson, NV",2370,87,7132,4.0,2/6/2012,"Thursday night about 9pm it was busy. Parking was packed and is tight lot. The booth was not lit well but spacious. We ordered fried artichoke hearts as appetizer and it came with a mayo type dipping sauce. Only like $3.95 and a must try before meal. We got the new Asian Kung pap chicken. It was supposed to have alot of veggies and snow peas but only had a couple and good rice. But it tasted good with alot of chicken. The the Californificatiin  flatbread, it was good but the mayo sauce drizzle was kinda nasty so I took it off. The tipping were good, The finally was the desert giant pan baked fresh chocolate chip cookie topped with massive scoop of French vanilla ice cream. Sugar shock WOW and bust out the defibrillator. Sweet heaven has arrived. Try it you'll be back for more!"
Brandi H.,"Rifle, CO",0,8,1,4.0,4/20/2014,It's was a nice atmosphere and the food was good. Great service. Will go there again. Nice place to gather with a few friends. They also brew their own beer which is pretty nice :-)
Paolo D.,"Las Vegas, NV",811,977,80,3.0,8/9/2010,"I should finally finish this review I started a while ago. In short, BJ's is a good chain restaurant with good brews. If you like IPAs, I recommend their Tempest IPA, which isn't on the menu. Secret IPA for the win! The last time I was there, it was for the World Cup 2010 Final. We chose this venue because our buddy had $70 in gift cards. It's really not the best spot to watch sports, but it served its purpose. On this visit, I ordered their Jambalaya. I wasn't completely sold on it. I don't mind spicy, but this one was to the point of barely tasting the dish. In the past, I've had their deep dish pizza. I remember it being pretty good."
doreen p.,"Las Vegas, NV",25,16,5,5.0,1/23/2012,"Wow,  had a great lunch special today Chicken Tortilla Soup and Caesar Salad. Unlimited Soup & Salad $6.95 Your choice of soup and a house or Caesar salad (unlimited refills). For some reason I thought I had to order only one type of salad and soup.  When the waiter came back and asked if I would like another soup/salad I didn't realize I could order a Clam Chowder, Chilli or Minestrone Soup.  It was fantastic! They also have snacks and small bites starting at $2.95 so you can have a variety.   Desserts?  Pizookie's to die for!!! You're never too old to enjoy our freshly baked, hot out of the oven, rich and delicious cookie topped with two scoops of vanilla bean ice cream and served in its own deep dish. Your choice of Chocolate Chunk, Red Velvet, White Chocolate Macadamia Nut, Peanut Butter or Oatmeal Raisin Walnut. or BJ's Baked Beignet Their delicious bakery crust dough baked to a golden brown, tossed in cinnamon and sugar and then topped with vanilla bean ice cream, fresh strawberries, a drizzle of strawberry puree and fresh whipped cream."
Adam W.,"Las Vegas, NV",89,20,3,5.0,5/21/2014,"Went here for Mothers Day dinner last week.  It was the first time at a BJs location for myself and my daughter, although the rest of the family had been there in the past.  We had a large deep dish pizza (BJs special) and a medium deep dish with anchovies.  I can honestly say this was some of the best pizza I have had in Las Vegas!  Very fresh ingredients and I liked how they use fresh cut tomato instead of tomato sauce in the pie.  BJs offers an extensive menu and is an excellent choice for a family gathering.  Very kid friendly and excellent food.  I will definately be back and would recommend this restaurant to others...."
Beryl C.,"Los Angeles, CA",228,157,89,4.0,5/11/2014,"BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse boasts a delicious assortment of brews and cocktails. I'm not a beer drinker but occasionally go here for lunch because they have a decent-sized menu, reasonably-priced lunch specials and plenty of tables with almost no wait time. I recommend trying their Southern fried chicken resting on a bed of cheddar mashed potatoes and corn. BJ's also offers ""enlightened"" items, food that's healthy and relatively low calorie. One of my lunchtime favorites is the Maui pork chop. Just one grilled bone-in chop with a sweet glaze, served with potatoes and crisp green beans. Finish off the meal with their famous Pizookie, a cookie baked fresh out of the oven and topped with ice cream. It's to die for."
Jason W.,"Henderson, NV",17,16,,4.0,7/21/2014,"Love the Brewhouse Bacon Cheeseburger! The wedge fries are bomb too. Favorite appetizer is the Avocado Egg Rolls! BJ's is vastly becoming a very regular dining spot! Great service as well. They could offer a better Happy Hour. Other than that, I highly recommend this place!"
Charles H.,"North Las Vegas, NV",2,27,9,5.0,3/27/2014,Recently discovered their curbside service. Just another reason to love this restraunt!
James D.,"Las Vegas, NV",117,12,2,5.0,6/17/2014,"Always eat here with my boys. Love this place. Ate Saturday before Father's Day and had a great experience. I've only had one shortfall in service here once and the one time I did, I didn't have to bring up. BJs staff recognized on their own and apologized on their own!  Great staff and management team here!!!  Always come back!"
Mike B.,"Las Vegas, NV",172,190,111,4.0,12/29/2013,I like the atmosphere in this place...who doesn't like a place to watch games and throw back some brewskis? Food is a cut above normal chain restaurants..not spectacular but good.Besides after 4 or 5 beers everything tastes good anyways. I will definitely frequent this establishment.
J C.,"Lahaina, HI",1,142,38,4.0,6/9/2014,"Love this place.  We live near here so we come here pretty regularly. We like to sit in the bar, we typically get better service if we sit in the bar area.  Food is pretty good for the most part. I think I have only had 1 bad meal here. Chik parm was definitely not very good.  Love the atmosphere. Sign up for BJs rewards and you can get free appetizers and other good stuff."
Marisol J.,"Las Vegas, NV",3,2,,4.0,3/25/2012,"Bj""s  is one of those restaurants I have a love hate relationship with.  Some of the items, I just love some are not so great in my opinion.  First things first parking can be a hassle at times, and your bound to wait re guard less of what night of the week you attend.  I like the atmosphere and decor very much.  The wait staff is pleasant enough, yet often make mistakes with our orders.  In all fairness we usually have rather large family dinners there. Now, the food.  They have great soups the tortilla soup is my daughters favorite with fresh avocados a top.  My son and I love the Tomato Soup, truly creamy and delicious with large homemade croutons.  I usually start to get full with just my soup.  On most evenings we go my daughter orders their Chicken Alfredo, she normally loves it.....occasionally can be dry.  I ordered a little more sauce was charges an additional 3.50 ouch!  My son usually goes for their Jumbalaya which is very delicious and huge portion, or their ribs both are very tasty.  I waiver between their New york strip, which by the way is great! or at times go for their other pasta dishes on the menu.  I personally am not impressed with their pasta  dishes, find them a bit tasteless.  Also their pork medallions with white cheddar mashed potatoes are great..... I can't ever leave this restaurant with out eating desert.  My kids and I are crazy about their warm fresh baked cookie with ice cream a top called Pazooky, I'm sure I've misspelled that....l.o.l. yet  a sinful and  necessary experience!  Dinner there usually can be a bit pricey with appetizers and desert usually about $90 to $!00  for the three of us.  Bj's is always a family favorite, with variety for all offering a huge menu and great to go service too. Bottom line is, if I ask my kids to pick a restaurant to go to, always seems to be Bj's a leading contender! Marisol Juracka, LV, Nv"
Yuna K.,"Reno, NV",294,119,9,4.0,6/4/2012,"I grew up with this restaurant. This was my neighborhood restaurant from middle school even until now, and man, am I lucky to have such a great neighborhood restaurant! I'm a frequent visitor, and I've never tasted anything I didn't like here!  There's the pizookie, which is a given. Red Velvet is my fave! All of the salads are great. Just had the turkey burger which was bomb! The waiters are always accommodating and it's just a great casual place to hang out and visit whenever!"
Kevin L.,"Las Vegas, NV",15,26,18,4.0,10/6/2011,"I never thought I'd see myself reviewing conglomerate type restaurant like BJ's.  However my most recent experience inspired me to take a few minutes to spread the gospel on some great things that most people are probably missing out on. First off their fish & chips have the most uniquely delicious batters I have ever encountered.  I don't know how they do it, but the batter is flavorful, crispy and surprisingly flaky.  It absorbs the malt vinegar or lemon juice while still maintaining its crunchiness.  Every other beer batter I've tried, the vinegar or lemon juice just glides right off and makes the batter soggy.  They've learned how to break the laws of physics with this magical beer batter. Second notable item offered at BJ's is their Irish Root Beer, which is their micro-brew root beer mixed with Jameson, Butterscotch Schnapps, and Bailey's.  The drink comes out frothy, messy, and overflowing like a great root beer float.  If you've never tried it before, you don't know what to expect when you taste it.  The best way to describe this flavor of this drink is with words from that guy in that Daffy Duck cartoon.  BJ's Irish Root Beer is... ""Amazing! Marvelous! Stupendous! Colossal! Tremendous! Gigantic! Astounding! Unbelievable! Spectacular! Phenomenal! And it's good, too."""
t t.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,20,23,4.0,7/21/2014,"Try them for the first time and it was pretty good, my kids love the chicken tender. Service was fast and friendly. Everything on menu are bar food."
Robert C.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,3,2,3.0,9/3/2014,Great food poor service my step mom fell and broke her finger here on my birthday and not one employee offered to help
Emily H.,"Las Vegas, NV",25,66,11,1.0,12/19/2014,"The service is the reason why I almost never dine in and grab curbside. I can avoid the tip that they don't deserve so that's what I usually do. Food is always better fresh so I decided to stop in today. There was a party by us - that had already finished eating by the way, but they also had a different server. My boyfriend and I took about 10-15 minutes deciding what to eat and we had at least 5 servers walk by (including the one who ended up being ours.) Our host came by and asked if we had been helped, and we said no. Our server finally came by and wanted to take just drink orders after 20 minutes? I said no, we're ready to order.. hello lady my menu is hanging off the side of the table. Anyways, I got my salad before my drinks! The manager dropped my salad off and didn't say a word. Not thirsty or anything! Then our food came but was run by someone else (signs this server SUCKED if she can't run any of her food), and no ranch. Can't have fries without ranch, and our server didn't come by for at least 10 more minutes to check on us when she didn't even run our food. I like this place, but not this location. I work in the industry and I just wish I could do the job for these people, it's pathetic. I wish the Centennial location wasn't so far - seems like people actually care about service, timing, and their tips!"
Rick J.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,2,,5.0,8/28/2014,I like this Resturaunt . It's always consistent in its meal perpetration and regardless of time of day I always get a seat. The service is great never had a bad server.  Seems priced right and could easily be my favorite neighborhood Resturaunt
Monica W.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,18,,4.0,4/2/2013,"FOOD= Good STAFF= Great PRICE= $$ This is the best BJ's location in Vegas area & right across the street from Redrock Casino so something to do after lunch or dinner.  Chili bowl, is very good and goes great with one of their house brewed beers. Oreo pazookie is a must have and you might not want to share its amazing!"
Taylor F.,"Las Vegas, NV",232,5,,1.0,5/2/2016,"Let me first start off by simply stating: DO NOT GO HERE. I repeat.. DO. NOT. GO. HERE. The service is horrendous. If zero stars were an option, they would have earned it. I had the worst experience I think I've ever had at a restaurant tonight. They made my family and I feel totally uncomfortable. We actually ended up leaving before our food came. It was THAT bad. Both the waitress (Toni) and management staff (especially David)  acted totally unprofessionally. Additionally, I've been here on several occasions and wait for way too long every time to get seated and receive food. The service is NEVER good, which isn't surprising considering how I'll-suited their manager is to MANAGE. As a business student, I am well aware of how a manager should treat patrons, and this is not it. My family and I have lived here for over 15 years and have frequented this place since I was in elementary school. I vow to NEVER go back. Seriously, take my word for it. Plus the food is subpar at very, very best. It really was just close to our house, that's the ONLY reason. And now I have no reason to ever come back. I have called the corporate office and am waiting for a response. They must know how horrible this experience was."
