Alana B.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,1,,5.0,8/18/2015,"Came here for the GF pizza because I had a craving for it, and it was phenomenal! I had the chicken bacon ranch and the crust was excellent, not dry, and the pizza had great flavor. I sat at the bar and the bartender was very nice, she was attentive and very fun. Loved it here and will be coming back!"
Angel N.,"Las Vegas, NV",26,68,85,5.0,4/18/2014,The atmosphere is amazing. The food is great.  The avocado rolls are delicious.  The Santa Feel salad with the blackened salmon is the best. They have tropical tea unsweetened which is nice for a change. Great customer service and comfortable booths.
Emily F.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,18,1,5.0,8/15/2014,"Their parmesan crusted chicken is the best thing in this world!!! Soooooooo good! And then they have those DELICIOUS cookies with ice cream, they are to die for. Soooooooo good!!!"
Mike S.,"Las Vegas, NV",15,68,4,1.0,11/20/2011,"What a joke. I can't believe I was actually prepared to pay $12.00 for an individual pizza and a small side salad. Ordered curbside. Lady said it would be 20 minutes.  I arrived to find no parking whatsoever. I called and told them I had arrived but there was no parking in the designated ""curbside"" spots.  Lady who answered had no solutions. So just then I noticed a spot, told her I had found one, and asked her to please bring me my order. Well, no one ever came out. I saw a waitress serving other cars, but she didn't bother coming up to mine. After waiting over 10 minutes, I simply left. Went around the corner and grabbed a couple of slices from Roco's for $5.00! They were delicious. Guess what? They never even called me to let me know my order was ready!   You people have some nerve charging way too much money for average food and deplorable service.  Stay away from this poor excuse for a dining facility..."
Pam G.,"Apex, NC",25,287,,3.0,3/26/2012,"We stopped in to BJs for lunch after hiking in the Red Rock canyons. We sat in the bar area and were quickly greeted and had our drink order taken immediately. The service started to go downhill after that. We had a very long wait for our drinks, to the point that we had to flag down the server to see if he had forgotten about them.  He was not polite with his response that he was 'waiting for the bartender to pour them'.  We did finally get our drinks and placed our lunch order.  The first thing to arrive was our friends chicken tortilla soup. They made a nice production of pouring the broth over the soup at the table, presumably so that the tortillas didn't get soggy, but he had no spoon. We couldn't flag anyone down for a spoon, so my DH finally went and asked someone for a spoon. We still sat there for a long time before a spoon arrived. When we finally saw our waiter again,my Dh asked him to bring our friend a new soup (ok, he may have TOLD him to :-)) I think at this point our waiter realized that our service hadn't been great and he brought over a sample of one of their beers which was nice. The funny thing though was that I also got chicken tortilla soup and when they brought it, after all of this, no spoon! Maybe they have a shortage, idk. We knew to ask immediately this time and they did bring it out pretty quickly.  Having said all that, we all really enjoyed our food. The chicken tortilla soup was very good, the mac and cheese was excellent, the chopped salad was great and huge, and they recognized that our service was not good and did try to make up for it. They also made a very tasty margarita, so it's worth another visit."
Lynn S.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,29,,3.0,7/29/2015,Pretty good. My bf loves the lunch menu here. The seating isn't my favorite it's much too open for my taste. Even after they changed it from the time they opened. The menu is ginormous! So I think most of the food is pre made and frozen! The last experience for me wasn't the best. The waiter told me that my flat bread that I ordered wouldn't have bacon on it (the description of the item on the menu did not mention bacon) however as soon as he puts the food down on the table it is almost completely covered in bacon! So I asked him what it was and he apologized and then just took the food bank. Maybe he was nervous for making a mistake but he didn't even ask if I'd like something else instead. So I sat there foodless and unhappy! The hostess walked by and I mentioned this to her and then the manager appeared at our table trying to correct the situation. I did appreciate his efforts. But I didn't eat anything. I was over eating.
Kelly M.,"Las Vegas, NV",85,104,62,5.0,8/14/2011,"I just love this local brewery tucked away in one of my favorite areas of Summerlin. The food is always consistent and yummy, the service is impeccable(you are truly treated like a guest) and we never leave disappointed.   Amazing Bonuses: Their deep dish buffalo chicken pizza Small Bite Menu (affordable and perfect portions-our favorite is the artichokes) The salads (I love the Cesar and market) Lunch Specials Half off wine night on Tuesdays! I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants delicious food in a relaxed environment.  Keep up the consistency, BJ's!"
Hiza R.,"Las Vegas, NV",139,10,2,3.0,12/5/2013,"The food is the only reason I come back here. The service is awful! A dinner for two people should not take over an hour and a half. The restaurant wasn't overly busy either. It took awhile to get our orders and when the orders came out we asked for a side of ranch for our fries. By the time the side came out, we were about done. We ordered a pizzookie for dessert. When we were done we waited a good 15 minutes for our check. There is no reason why a check would take that long."
Randy B.,"Westlake Village, CA",4983,2338,4473,4.0,10/5/2011,"Consistently good; great BIG menu & draft beers; what can be bad? This location is in Summerlin, across from the Red Rock Hotel.  When you don't want to mess with the downtown/strip area...this is a good choice for an alternate place to grab some grub with the locals.   As with all the BJ's, the pizza, brews, salads, and tons of other items, desserts (can you say pizzookie?)...it's all good stuff. Plus, lunch & happy hour, and late hour specials.  My favorite thing on the menu (for years now, and I never tire): the BBQ Chicken Chop...which I feel is the best I've ever had (sorry CPK).  Salads don't travel well, but everything else is served in HUGE capacity and get read for a 'take home' box. The service is very good at this location.  The only downsides is that it gets awfully busy, and parking is difficult to get in the front of the restaurants (shared with other restaurants), so you often have to park on the backside and walk a bit around a large building."
Jennifer L.,"Las Vegas, NV",179,131,531,5.0,6/23/2011,Been here countless times for birthdays and lunch. All their portion sizes are big enough to share since I never ever finish my entree. It's a great place to bring a group if you're treating cuz you'll be saving money. Large entrees that are shareable are probably the deep dish pizzas (yum) and their pastas. I also think their lunch special runs from 11am - 3pm. It is also really nice to just come here and sit at the bar with a beer and watch some games on their tvs.  Service: I'm really surprised at all the negative comments about service. I went during lunch this past Friday and my server was more than beyond courteous and very attentive. He came back to check on us 2-3 times and also made sure to let us know that the food was on its way. I guess you just have to get lucky?
Alisa N.,"Austin, TX",7,100,,5.0,8/1/2011,"Yes, it's a chain-but it's a great chain!  The food never fails to disappoint, and there's something for everyone on the menu.  It's a very family friendly atmosphere, yet you wouldn't hesitate to take a date here.  It's always busy, but service is on point :)  The avocado eggrolls and pizookies are a must-do.  One tip-do check your take-out before you go home.  Once, they left out the very important sauce for the avocado eggrolls.  Ugh! Try the red velvet Pizookie!"
Sunny L.,"Las Vegas, NV",3,60,,5.0,8/13/2014,BJ's prices are fair and we are always happy with their food.  I recently tried the bison burger and was impressed!
Linda C.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,16,2,5.0,8/11/2015,"First I must say, we have been to BJ's restaurants previously, but tonight was the best experience ever and it was due to our server, Courtney. She made the night wonderful and full of fun!  She was very attentive and engaging and because of her, we will be back.  The food was very good, we had the fish and chips, bacon guacamole burger, chicken dinner and a half and half pizza.   For dessert, we had the mini triple combo pizookie and everything was excellent and the beer selection is awesome!  Great place to sit and visit with family and friends.  Great parking and convenient location right off the 215 and Charleston."
Janel S.,"North Las Vegas, NV",370,309,435,4.0,1/28/2012,"Service here was fantastic. Destiny was such an amazing server. She was so bubbly, cheery, and very attentive. She sure knows her brewskies! She helped me find a good brew of choice, and she also made light conversations with us. Such a sweet waitress. Also, I left forgetting my keys on the table and the nice busser flagged me down and gave me my keys back. Thank you sir! The food is a-ok. I think for a lunch special that is $5.95, I really can't complain. I had the chicken quesadilla and my friend had the bottomless soup and salad. the good part about that is you can switch off your soups and salads if you want to try something different. I honestly come for the pazookie. They have the best pazookies, and they bake the cookie the way I lllloooovvveee my cookie! Soft and doughy. My ultimate favorite is the macadamia nut pazookie. I'm really tempted to try the red velvet, but my heart just can't let go of the macadamia nut. I guess I'm just not ready to let go yet...(It's complicated). I also had the Nutty Brewnette which had the very carmelly sweet and nutty. I also must warn you that this brew sure's got some HOP to it. After one drink I was getting quiet and I'm never quiet.  If you are all about a strong roundhouse kick in your brew...try the Piranha...I was about to choose this one then Destiny kind of warned me that it's got a really strong spicy taste to it, and it's got a whole lot of hop to it. So, I backed out on that one. But if you are one who is all about the IPA intensity..go for the Piranha."
Matthew R.,"Las Vegas, NV",16,34,1,3.0,2/28/2014,Usually four stars and the three are probably my fault for trying something new.  Almost always get bison burger which is a delicious low cal option.  Today I went low carb and got the wings.  They came with the sauce on the side and I am a wet wing fan.  The sauce was ok....may have been franks red hot.  Bleu cheese was very thin and no celery came on the plate.  Tracy the bartender always remembers my tea order and is very friendly.
Brad T.,"Chicago, IL",619,416,180,4.0,12/31/2013,I am a huge fan of this Chicago style pizza joint. The pizza is deep dish and solid and their beer on tap is all brewed in house or locally. Service is generally solid and price reasonable for what you get. Personally I am a huge fan of the Buffalo Chicken Pizza which is just the right blend of spicy and pizza if there is such a thing. Also their Jerimiah Red ale is pretty solid also.
Cody P.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,15,,4.0,5/10/2014,Excellent beer and a large menu make this place stand out. The black and blue burger is awesome and they will even cook it medium rare for you. Also try the pazookie if you want desert. The meditteranian pizza is great too.
Theresa M.,"Las Vegas, NV",104,60,17,4.0,9/25/2013,Good beers and service. I love the stuffed mushroom appetizer so dee-lish. They have a gluten sensitive menu you too. The California chicken sandwich is my so good!! Grilled chicken with avocado and green chilies with pepper jack on sour dough. I know it's a chain but this location has a locals feel. Good eats with TV's everywhere. So no one will miss the game.
jonathan r.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,43,,2.0,10/9/2014,"Generally my wife and enjoy going for the good beer and tasty food. On our last trip when we go the bill I noticed that we had been billed for an extra beer. The waitress said she would take care of this. About ten minutes later she came by to say she was trying to get the manager to take it off the bill. Five minutes later we walked to the front and asked to see a manager. A lady who said she was a manager said she working on get the charge removed, but had to get approval from her manager who was busy with another matter. Get your act together, BJ."
Tom D.,"Las Vegas, NV",100,43,19,4.0,3/1/2014,Great food as usual. Either greasy bar food or healthy options this place has it all. My favorite is the Crispy Jalapeño Burger.
