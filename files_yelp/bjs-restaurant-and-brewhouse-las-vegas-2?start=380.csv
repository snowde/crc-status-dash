Nick H.,"Puyallup, WA",15,250,7,4.0,11/23/2011,"A great place and surprisingly good lunch specials were on-hand at BJ's.  We recovered from a long hike at Red Rock with some tomato bisque and toasted sandwiches, and both the price and selections were great.   We had pretty good service, too. I still don't quite know what a pizzookie is.  Perhaps it's best left one of life's secrets."
Sharon M.,"Las Vegas, NV",7,79,5,4.0,2/15/2015,Blackened salmon was tasty.  You can never go wrong with the pizookie for dessert.   Our Server had a great personality which makes dining enjoyable.  For a chain restaraunt its solid.
Jeannie F.,"Celina, TX",6,54,10,4.0,7/25/2011,Only reason I give them 4 instead of 5 is because they can be a bit slow. But I keep going back because I love their food! Great kids meals - and the Parmesan Crusted Chicken - so good. I've turned several people on to it. They have a new rewards program but seems to be a bit bumbly - the hostesses and servers seem to get disconnected handling it - but if you remind the server when they give you the check it usually gets resolved.
Jess P.,"Las Vegas, NV",53,273,59,5.0,1/26/2013,"I LOVE BJ'S! (hey, get your mind out of the gutter! :p) I like BJ's because they have great beers on tap (if it's still January, try the Grand Cru!!) The Grand Cru is a special brew they do at the beginning of the new year and they don't re-brew it until next January, so get it while you still can! As far as food is concerned, don't order anything else besides the Bj's favorite pizza. SO GOOD! It has like everything you could ever think to put on a pizza. Finish your meal off with a pizookie and life is GOOOOOOOD."
Christine M.,"Las Vegas, NV",17,58,6,5.0,11/20/2011,"This is up there in one of my top 5 restaurants. I get excited every time we go here, like a little kid would get excited for Disneyland, lol. Their menu selection is never ending. A part of me wishes their menu was smaller, because I never know what to get! I feel like I am always missing out on something! But, no matter what I have ordered I have never been let down. Their Avocado egg rolls are so good I can barely stand it! I am not a beer drinker, but I order beer here cause it's so delicious. Their seasonal pumpkin beer is amazing. My boyfriend raves about the pazookie dessert, but we are always too full by the time we are done I just can't do it. I told him one of these days we will just come in for beers and dessert and skip the meal, ha!  Give the place a go if you haven't yet. I doubt you would be disappointed, unless you are looking to woo your date with some romantic meal, then go somewhere else. No, it doesn't have ambiance as I saw one person complain about... but this is not that kind of restaurant. It's a busy loud restaurant with sports on the TV's, what do you expect? Go to a classy joint for a romantic night, this is a low to moderately priced brewery people! And a wonderful place to grab a bite of great food and a good beer!"
Karen D.,"Las Vegas, NV",5,77,,3.0,10/22/2011,"Crowded night, lots of kiddies (with lots of screeching).. not the best ambiance, to say the least. However, my pork chops were absolutely fantastic.. I was amazed at how perfectly prepared they were.  The rest of the plate, meh.. but the pork chop I ate was incredible.   The one that hubby ate was also incredible, but not the reason why... his ribs were terrible.  The potato was enormous, ridiculously so.. and his ""smoked"" ribs weren't smoked, they were boiled then some sauce was slapped on and they were finished on a grill.  It was obvious, and their menu was a lie. Will I return?  Possibly... but not for the ribs.  They get a bonus point for removing it from the tab, but they lost a point for him having to resort to eating half of my meal because no server came around to find out how the food was, thus giving him a chance to order something else."
Bryan B.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,6,,2.0,5/22/2012,"***** Service: Our server was great. I wish I could remember his name - he is a young Hispanic kid with a faux-hawk. Seriously, excellent server. **** Kids: The menu is great, with several options for kids. All kids items are $5.99, which includes a main dish, side dish, and a drink.  The only problem I found is that if you have a child who needs a high-chair your wait will be longer because of the lack of tables - their booths are not designed to have a high-chair on the outside. * Food: It is just not very good. My wife got the jalapeno burger and was not impressed, which is saying a lot because she is not very picky when it comes to burgers. I got the Cajun pasta with shrimp and, while the flavor was okay, the pasta was terrible.  At least half of the noodles were stuck together in groups of 2,3,4 and more! Obviously, this makes for some crunchy, impossible-to-eat pasta.  How hard is it to cook fettuccine noodles? It was like someone stuck them in a too-small pot and just left them there for 6-8 minutes and then tossed them on a plate. Conclusion: Unless you are just looking for a place to get a drink and watch a game, go elsewhere.  There are probably 20 other restaurants within a 2-minute walk of this place, most of which will be a better food experience."
Erin M.,"Enfield, NH",95,186,27,4.0,4/9/2011,"We were heading back to Vegas after a day trip to Red Rock Canyon and decided that rather than dealing with the insanity of eating somewhere on the strip, we'd eat somewhere just outside of it.  I pulled up my handy-dandy Yelp app on my phone and found BJ's.  After a few wise cracks about how with a name like BJ's, it has to be good, and then proceeded to navigate our immature selves there. We were seated right away and our waiter was friendly.  We ordered a couple of beers and the potstickers for an app, and decided to keep it simple with a cheese and tomato deep dish pizza.  Both the beer and food we had were quite tasty.  Back home, the only option we have for Chicago deep dish style pizza is Uno's, and this definitely beat that by a landslide.  It made us want to go to Chicago someday so we can try the real deal for a basis of comparison! Overall, it was a nice, inexpensive, quick, and tasty alternative to dining on The Strip!"
C Heisman R.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,29,15,5.0,3/8/2014,Love this place. Great service I go out of my way to find this restaurant. Every dish I've tried has been tasty
Bruce G.,"Las Vegas, NV",49,24,,4.0,11/24/2011,"BJ's is a standard fall back restaurant when we cannot decide as a family on some other place.  We all love BJ's but I just cannot give this type of restaurant 5 stars.  It would be hard pressed for me to give any bar restaurant a 5 star rating so 4 is really good.  My kids love the deep dish pizza and I love several items on their menu.  The balsamic chicken is awesome, but make sure you order it with extra fried onions.  The French dip is also very good.   It's a must to order their pizookie .  This is a fresh baked cookie (warm) in a circular metal tin with a scoop of ice cream on top.  Several cookies to choose from.  They are all amazing.     Great place to go to and watch a sporting event as they have TV's throughout the restaurant.   Enjoy!"
Max B.,"Rochester, NY",2,87,5,3.0,5/6/2013,"If you're looking for a large beer selection, including some they make themselves, this place will do. The food, on the other hand, is not so great. The menu is like that of many chain restaurants in that its huge and covers various types of cuisine. Everything sounds delicious but rarely seems to be.  Deep dish pizza's - 5/10 - more like a standard pizza hut pizza and nothing like a real deep dish pizza Wings - 6/10 - not bad, but would be much better with more sauce"
Chris A.,"Las Vegas, NV",851,405,1336,4.0,11/18/2010,"I really love my NY style pizza...thin, crispy crust...not too much toppings to weigh it down.  But man, BJ's Chicago style pizza gives it a run for its money!  I enjoy the pizza here and apparently a lot of other folks do too.  This place is always packed for dinner!  Very happening.   Went here with the fam, and we had a blast.  It was great hearing the game on the TV, people congregating and laughing, plates and glasses clinking.  The atmosphere is pretty inviting, lots of dark woods and high ceilings almost reminding you of a gastropub.  BJ's has a very large menu that includes appetizers, salads, sandwiches, Angus burgers, sliders, giant stuffed potatoes, pasta, and even a gluten-free menu (no gluten, in a pizza joint?  Come on!  It's pizza!)...but the Chicago pizza is the star. I pretty much perused the main menu and went straight for the heart, BJ's wonderful deep dish pizzas.  They usually have at least 8-9 different pies on the menu and of course you can make your own with any of their ingredients.  Every pizza comes with their special blend of FIVE cheeses.  Their pizza creations include - BJ's Favorite Pizza (The Works w/ meatballs, pepperoni, Italian sausage, peppers, olives, onions, and tomatoes), Mediterranean (Grilled chicken, basil pesto, roasted garlic, Kalamata olives, sun-dried tomatoes, and feta), Sweet Pig (Pineapple, tomatoes, and roasted ham), BBQ Chicken (BBQ chicken, red onions, tomatoes, hickory BBQ sauce, and cilantro), and the Southwestern (Blackened chicken, green chiles, chipotle sauce, cheddar cheese, tomatoes, and cilantro) just to name a few.  They even have calzones, and yes...a gluten-free thin crust pizza!  I feel so sorry for you people that can't handle gluten.  No deep dish for you! We ended up with a large BJ's Favorite pizza for all of us to share.  Just to let you know they aren't cheap, probably around $10-24 each depending on the size and type of pie you get (Mini, Small, Medium, or Large).  Mind you, these pizzas don't look large when they get to the table but they are DEEP.  It's like a good almost two inches thick!  I thought our family of four could finish the entire pie in one sitting but I was wrong!  Our pie had six large slices and we could only eat a slice each!  You definitely have to eat this pizza with a knife and fork...no folding slices in half folks!  The crust is buttery, not too heavy, and completely cooked through without being soggy.  The ingredients were fresh, and the veggies still had a light bite to them.  The sauce was tangy and sweet.  Overall a very delicious slice of pie!  Yes, like pie!  Very good pizza. We rounded out our dinner with a few appetizers, the Crispy Calamari ($8.95) with spicy marinara and lemon garlic aioli, and the Garden Medley Salad ($8.95) with romaine lettuce, artichoke hearts, roasted red peppers, tomatoes, red onion, feta, and balsamic vinaigrette.  Both very tasty. Although we were stuffed (ha ha...like pie?) our server told us we had to try BJ's Famous Pizookie ($5.95).  After rants from the kids on how we never have dessert it ended up being ordered.  Funny how they win and you don't even realize it.  This thing ended up being delicious!  Like sweet crack!  Not that I've tried crack before.  The Pizookie is a hot out of the oven, fresh baked cookie topped with vanilla ice cream and served in it's own mini deep dish tin.  We got a chocolate chunk cookie, but you can also choose, white chocolate macadamia nut, peanut butter, or oatmeal raisin walnut.  So good!  They bake the cookie dough until it's just a smidge underdone so your cookie is still gooey on the inside.  Goes great with the vanilla ice cream on top!  Good way to go to end a calorie busting meal!   I wanted to try one of their hand crafted micro brews but I couldn't fit it in on this trip.  I hear they also have a great happy hour M-F from 3 PM-7 PM and also on Sun-Th from 10 PM-close.  They have $1 their draft beers and cocktails, $2 off most of their appetizers, and 1/2 off all their Mini Pizzas.  I will have to go check this out on maybe a game day!   I definitely want to go back here again soon, good food, good service, good times.  Go here, and enjoy yourself before the crazy holidays!  BJ's has made me a fan of Chicago deep dish pizza.  NY pizza I love you so...Chicago deep dish, you can be my secret mistress!  SHHHHHH!!!"
Mat J.,"Henderson, NV",88,149,13,4.0,11/11/2011,So we go here with my parents a lot. The pizza is pretty good and the atmosphere is generally pretty good. TVs everywhere so you can watch a game and still focus on the people in your group. Their beer is pretty good and very reasonably priced and there is almost always some sort of special going on. My only complaint is that the Vegas locations don't have nutritional guides on hand. They are readily available in California so why not Nevada?
Marcus L.,"Las Vegas, NV",64,115,4,4.0,4/12/2013,"I have visited this location a handful of times since moving out here. I became a fan of BJ's ever since I gave one a try back in Hawaii. Imagine my excitement when I found out they have a few here(And in Cali)! I've taken a few friends here and it's been a pleasant experience each time. Good food, drinks and service. Big fan of their deep dish pizzas. They do have hand tossed as a pizza option now. Prices are about average for this type of venue, not real pricey but not cheap. It is also a brewery, so they make their own brews, even root beer and cream sodas. They do currently have some specials. 2 for $19.95 meal which includes 2 salad or soups, a medium pizza and a pizookie for dessert. Also some lunch specials starting at $6. They do have other items like sandwiches and entrees but honestly, I've never gotten past their pizzas yet hehe. If you have a craving for some good brews n pizzas, definitely not a bad place to stop by!"
Dennis T.,"Las Vegas, NV",608,24,2,1.0,4/9/2015,"The waiter we had was telling us what I wanted to order. I an on a special diet and have ordered this meal for years, no problem. This time it Was a problem and he was not one of the usual waiters that wait on us. We almost walked out until we saw a manager and spoke to him. He said there was no problem and took the order. We also asked for a new server because he had a attitude. He also went  to another table telling other people the same thing, I know they did not look happy. If he is my server next time I will go to another station."
Robert H.,"Las Vegas, NV",12,17,5,5.0,1/10/2014,"The pulled pork sandwich  was really good.  Wife got California chicken sandwich and tomatoe bisque soup which she really enjoyed.  We are here for lunch on a Friday and they are very busy.   All in all, a good place.  They also have a big drink selection. Would be a good place to come for happy hour. They new their own beer and have a huge selection."
Yasmin H.,"Summerlin, Las Vegas, NV",2,1,1,4.0,1/29/2014,It was good. I went to my friend's birthday dinner and I liked their pizza. I didn't order anything because that's what we had.
Amanda N.,"Las Vegas, NV",6,22,9,5.0,9/21/2011,"This place is always poppin!!!! I love it here and the food is great! The one thing i wish was different is the parking... I have been coming here for years and parking is always an issue. Some of my favorite dishes include the french dip, the bbq chicken salad, and the balsamic glazed chicken. The pazookis arent bad either;)"
Brandie D.,"Northwest, Las Vegas, NV",1,8,2,5.0,1/25/2013,"My boyfriend and I went to eat at this location last night and I had such a great experience, as always! Our waiter was quick, kind, and genuine! I can not have gluten so I love going to BJs for their gluten free pizza. Last nights pizza was the best ever. I had a great time and left completely satisfied. Will be back very soon!"
Joe T.,"Las Vegas, NV",45,157,12,4.0,8/9/2013,Always have great service at the bar. Bison burger is good along with the shrimp lettuce wraps. Plenty of beers to try on hand from tap to bottles if u like to try different beers
