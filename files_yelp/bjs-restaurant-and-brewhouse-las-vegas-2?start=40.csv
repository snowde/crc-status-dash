Dawn M.,"Las Vegas, NV",80,84,287,5.0,8/24/2016,"Soooooooo good. Our server Woody was amazing!! I sooooooo love him. So personable and attentive. The calamari, sriacha boneless wings and the pizza were all amazing.  I totally have no complaints. They even have a rewards program. For every $1 you spend you earn points to free food. I also unlocked a free appetizer thru Yelp!  So yes I'm was winning at this restaurant. Stop in and check them out!!!!!"
Rina D.,"Mesa, AZ",1,23,45,5.0,10/7/2017,"Our waiter was Bryce Z.  on 10/7/17 and he was really great! Such a positive attitude, even though they were swamped with patrons because of Homecoming. He was very attentive and served us at a timely manner. Awesome guy!"
Peter B.,"Portland, OR",1,87,3,4.0,3/29/2017,"It's Wednesday afternoon at 1:20 and there's no empty seat in the entire restaurant.  The service at this place is simply amazing. Whoever trains this staff needs an award.  The food was decent. Calamari was overcooked. Spinach salad was slightly over dressed and a little too sweet. (Small portion too.) The tea was good, not standout.  But really my takeaway from here was the service. They even gave me an iced tea to go, without my asking."
Wesley M.,"Las Vegas, NV",14,28,4,5.0,9/20/2017,"This is by faaaar....our best place to watch the Monday and Thursday night NFL games! They have great specials during the whole game, amazing food selection and all of it is delicious! The bartenders are the best, most attentive I've seen! They know what I drink after 4 visits and my loyalty number. They'll all friendly, funny and professional! Tracey, Allan, Tiara and Krystal are the regular bartenders when we're there. We see alot of repeat regulars that make going there an enjoyable few hours!"
love lv f.,"Henderson, NV",8,166,,1.0,8/31/2017,"For a chain restaurant you think their training would be excellent and their customer service would be off the charts... not the case with this location.  We came in at 3pm on Saturday, plenty of open tables but still a decent crowd. We were seated and waited at least 10 minutes before someone came to our table. When they did, she grabbed the pepper shaker to give to another server, did not say hello or even acknowledge us. Turns out, she was our server.  When she came to get our drink order another 5 minutes later, we had so much time with the menu we asked if we could put in our order. All simple food, tacos, wings, soup & salad.  A salad was served at our table, way before our drinks. We then waited 22 minutes for our food. Yes, I timed it because everything else was taking so long. Finally our food came except for the bowl of soup. Refills were done before the soup was delivered to the table. While waiting I noticed plenty of servers at the hostess stand having free time, talking, singing and joking around. By the time my soup arrived, one of my friends had already finished her meal, and a second person was almost done.  We were there over an hour and a half. No apologies for slow service, it was as though it was the norm. I also don't appreciate servers using pet names (baby, honey, love) when taking your order or serving your food and drink.  The food was good, but with that kind of service, it's not worth the time."
Cecy A.,"Las Vegas, NV",31,8,10,5.0,6/18/2017,2nd time that I have been here for dinner and once again I am pleased with their service. Many delicious items on the menu. I'm definitely coming back.
Kline F.,"Las Vegas, NV",228,13,,4.0,6/2/2017,BJ's is a great restaurant with fantastic lemonade. The food is great and has incredible salads that are fresh unlike other restaurants. The service is usually good but can be slow at times depending on the occupancy. Perfect place for catching up with friends or looking for a family friendly restaurant.
Jeanie M.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,7,,5.0,9/28/2017,super good and fast take out. I always call and my order is ready with in 20 minutes. The girls at the front are so cute and sweet! I will forever visit the bj's in summerlin! also you must try the pizza! ( sooo good )  thanks everyone for the a1 customer service.
Theresa C.,"Las Vegas, NV",152,356,38,1.0,12/12/2016,"This location is too busy and not worth it.  We went to the Centennial location when we lived in Aliante and thought the minimal wait was worth it.  But given the wait in Summerlin, I'd rather eat just about anywhere else.  We put our name on the waitlist via the app.  We checked in and were told 20 minutes.  At the 30 minute mark, I inquired about how much longer?  She told us there were 5 more tables ahead of us.  All the while, we waited, she kept quoting everyone 20 minutes....clearly not accurate.  It was so bad, there was a family with young kids that had been waiting over an hour and the kids were crying from hunger.  Other families with young kids left while we were waiting as well.  We also gave up...."
Jon O.,"Las Vegas, NV",33,3,7,1.0,8/30/2017,"I placed an order To go through postmates  when my order arrived, it was completely wrong. When I called the restaurant to see why, she told me I need to go through the app and request help, which I already did so. The manager on duty also told me that I did not order the veggie and I order the beef burgers. She also lied to me on how postmates works as I myself have driven for postmates in the past. If your restaurant makes a mistake own up to it and give good customer service. I understand mistakes happen but to lie and say I didn't order something goes beyond a bad review. I eat at BJs a lot but this will be my last time ever."
Rosanne T.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,6,,5.0,9/9/2017,"We absolutely love BJ's Restaurant in Summerland. The staff & food is spot on. It's one of our favorite places. Parking can be a little crowded, but there a quite a few restaurants in the area so that's to be expected."
D J.,"Las Vegas, NV",352,21,5,5.0,1/30/2017,Nate is a prime example of the best service you could ever get in the food industry! He is killing it in the game as a server... like seriously this guy made my day so great he made my day for tomorrow too lol #GiveHimARaise #PromoteHim Definitely coming back for our guy Nate here!
Israel S.,"Las Vegas, NV",4,54,46,5.0,8/8/2017,My fiancé and I come here almost every Tuesday for the $3 pazookies and a yummy brisket burger. Service is always great and the fries are extra delicious. The food came put pretty fast as well. Kaitlyn and Alga were our servers today and they were really great and friendly. Definitely coming back
Lori C.,"Reno, NV",39,33,75,1.0,7/18/2017,"The service was great and the food was so salty that we could not eat 3/4 if it.  So 3 people left hungry and we paid 78!  Avoid this place.  Even after we told the waitress the manager didn't adjust the bill for the crap food.  So salty we didn't eat most of it.  ...when I think about it, the beer helped to offset the salty..."
Brenda M.,"North Las Vegas, NV",69,18,1,1.0,6/12/2017,"Took about 10 minutes to seat us way in the back. Server then took about 10 minutes to show up. She took the order. We all had soup, salad and a sandwich. It's been about 20 minutes and nothing still. Found a bug in the strawberry in the prosecco. The rest of the restaurant is served and happy. They are not busy at all. We're just in  the back with absolutely no attention. Because we just ordered soup and salad right? Had we ordered maybe a higher priced item we would've gotten the service everyone else is having. So we will wait for our food as it has now been about 30 minutes since the order was so simple. First and most definitely the last time we'll come here. To top it off the server is not too excited to be here. The excuse was another big party was tying to get food. That tip is probably bigger and therefore more important since we are simple soup and salad. Thanks but no thanks."
Marie B.,"Summerlin, Las Vegas, NV",24,60,90,5.0,2/1/2017,"Their moscato mirrasou is the best white wine I've had in my life. Goes amazing with the white macadamia pizookie. Love how they have good deals with half off wine and appetizers! This location has been my go to always. For seafood lovers try their cherry glazed salmon it's so good, I get it with mashed potatoes and asparagus."
Geishamom P.,"Torrance, CA",0,44,15,5.0,8/5/2017,"Made reservations for 30 people for lunch. The restaurant and staff were very accommodating - plenty of room for us and service was outstanding!  Brian and Woody were our servers and they were friendly and responsive. They split bills by family for us, our orders came out correct , and drinks were refilled fast!  This BJ's delivered exceptional service and we would definitely come back again!!!!"
W G.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",35,12,2,5.0,8/17/2017,We visited BJ's today and enjoyed their Happy Hour and dinner menu. Food was great and our server Arin was wonderful. She took great care of us and if we lived in town we would go back just to have her as my server along with the great food.
Sheri B.,"Temecula, CA",100,9,,5.0,8/25/2017,"We made a reservation as we had a large party with four kids. Nate was our server and he was outstanding! Smiling, had multiple tables and our huge, needy group. Never once had to ask or wait for a drink refill.  Very impressed by his superior customer service! We are new to Summerlin. We will be back as Nate made our evening a great dining experience."
