Ami M.,"Las Vegas, NV",66,26,9,4.0,2/9/2013,"Great deep dish pizza! For some reason I thought the smaller pizzas off the bar menu tasted better than the same type of pizza, but larger size off the reg menu. Go figure."
Rey A.,"Las Vegas, NV",4,12,,5.0,1/9/2011,"Much better that I expected from a ""brewhouse"". Although kind of a loud place, the great food at a great price (and of course great beers) while being family-friendly makes it a hit. A great price for Summerlin as well, I expected to pay much more. The casual contemporary decor is also done well, if you like that kind of style."
Trina T.,"Las Vegas, NV",243,499,916,4.0,4/28/2011,"I try to avoid places like this because they usually serve greasy, crappy, frozen dookie on a plate. I was pleasantly surprised by their menu and beer selections. They have good food at great prices. If you want bar food done right with a good beer, stop here."
Ember H.,"Reno, NV",83,24,1,4.0,1/31/2013,"Long wait, but the food has never disappointed.  I give it to the staff though- they started handing out complimentary pizza after we waited for 30 min :)"
mick m.,"Las Vegas, NV",57,145,2,4.0,6/14/2011,"First time to BJ's, glad they are opening a store up north on Centennial!! This place was awosome...Monday nite visit, place was jammed, but only had a 15 min wait. Very nice decor, very expansive therefore very loud. Server was great...beer selection is huge, took sometime to select a few brews. Ordered a two appitizers, potstickers/avacado spring roles both were really good. Ordered a Southwestern pizza, more than enough for two people, actually took 4 pieces home.Finished off w/ a pazookie..1st time it was wonderful. Somehow would like it if the could create a creme brule pazzokie!!...For being a chain  they are years ahead of TGIF,Applebees,etc.......Great for brews and food"
Jason B.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,4,,4.0,5/31/2012,"Yo.  I'm going to go against my own lame criteria and review a restaurant that is a huge chain.  This place is pretty damn good.  I've been there about 5 times and each one has been met with very nice staff, solid food, and great service.   Try the steaks.  I  get the New York strip usually and it's always cooked perfect (order medium usually).  HUGE PORTIONS!!  You may enter a booth, eat, then have to sleep over because your stomach has created a seal against the table that you cannot break.   I'm not a big fan of the pizzas as I think they are too doughy.  But pizza is a thing, much like the name of this restaurant, where I've really never had a bad one.  So, you may really enjoy it.   Also get the rootbeer.  You MAY get diabeetus after finishing off a couple of mugs, but it will be worth it.   So yeah, don't eat for a week before going. Let's all get some BJ's!!"

Bobby S.,"Las Vegas, NV",56,98,,5.0,10/27/2010,"I never have a bad experience at Bj's.  I love everything about it from the layout all the way down to the Pizookie!  The microbrews are great.  I really like how they suggest certain foods with the different beers they offer. The pizza's are great.  I have never been to Chicago, but it's nice to be able to get a deep dish only a few miles from where I live.  The pizza's may not look gigantic but don't let that fool you they are feeling.  The staff are awesome the place is always clean and there is always A nice buzz in the place.  There hasn't been a single time that when someone suggests Bj's I say no.  The place is great."
Will H.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,51,5,5.0,10/15/2011,BJ: Fantastic happy hours. Fast service. Great food. Service:Outstanding. I really have nothing negative to say about BJ!!! Cheers
Arielle M.,"Chantilly, VA",0,4,,1.0,2/10/2014,"It's not a busy day, and I seated myself at the bar for a quick lunch. For the first 15 mins no one wiped the table I sat at, never got handed a menu or silverware. Ever!!!! I got it all myself and I still could have had an attitude.  But I didn't however I will never come here again."
Paul M.,"Columbus, GA",49,36,11,4.0,5/13/2011,"I actually wish Yelp offered a half-star rating, because this place should really get 3 and a half in my book. I came here last night for dinner and left pretty pleased actually. I had a couple of hefeweizens which were quite good but I really prefer mine with a lemon. I had the grilled turkey cobb which was very good and finished it off with a white chocolate macadamia nut pazookie. The pazookie was good, though not as thick as I anticipated. I really enjoyed the vanilla bean ice cream topper though - very nice touch. Service was good and fast. They also have a take out entrance. I'll eat here again, though it was a little pricey for me. I do think the beer was a little overpriced, but it wasn't happy hour either."
Charles D.,"Las Vegas, NV",4,16,1,5.0,1/9/2013,Keisha was our server.  Excellent service and food
Jenn B.,"Henderson, NV",1,49,54,4.0,11/20/2013,Great food and service. I called ahead to make reservations and the host was very informative and friendly. The waitress was wonderful and attentive. A little expensive but yummy overall.
Laura S.,"Las Vegas, NV",107,8,,5.0,11/12/2011,"As a family we love BJ's.  Every time we have family members or friends visit us from another state, we bring them here.  Service is amazing, staff is knowledgeable and fun, and the food is always hot and fresh and delicious. But here's why I recommend them and what prompted this review: BJ's is always busy. (Use their call-ahead program where you can add your name to the wait list before you arrive.) One Friday night, we were waiting in the small reception area for a table, a wait we expected and didn't mind knowing that the food and service would be well worth it. Unfortunately, our wait began going over the initial wait time quoted to us by the hostess.  In fact, it was beginning to be significantly over and the very, very, very, very tiny waiting area was now becoming quite packed with other families and people waiting for their tables as well. Looking over the dining room it appeared that it wasn't the servers' or restaurant's fault.  Many tables had paid checks on the table and were cleared, except for some napkins and lingering drinks.  The guests were just camping out at tables, ignoring the growing group of families with whining, hungry kids. But the managers didn't ignore us.  In fact, two different food runners were sent out to the group of waiting people (both inside and outside the restaurant) with trays of pizza cut up in small portions for the kids to munch on while we waited. Napkins were provided and no mention of payment was ever made.  This act was by far the kindest, most thoughtful gesture I have ever witnessed by a restaurant. As a parent, I was deeply appreciative of this simple, yet thoughtful gesture on the part of  the restaurant. As a 12-year veteran of the industry who has worked as a corporate trainer for two major national chains and is married to a chef, I was greatly impressed by the amazing attention to this matter and quick resolution.  We had been entertaining the idea of leaving and going somewhere we didn't like as much, just to get some food in our crabby, hungry toddler's tummy. But this act on the part of BJ's staff kept us there and our money in their hands. Great job! We were huge fans of BJ's before this event, but whenever asked about a good family restaurant, I quickly recount this story and lay on the great reviews. Thanks, BJ's. We're fans for life!"
Stephanie E.,"Las Vegas, NV",75,34,33,2.0,8/21/2012,"The thing I liked most about this place was the choice of beers.  Other than that it was nothing special.  My boyfriend and I shared a mushroom and sausage pizza and each of us got a side salad as well.  The salad tasted like the ones that you buy in the pre-mixed bags, flavorless and too wet.  The pizza was very comparable to Pizza Hut.  Its a shame they compare it to Chicago style deep dish pizza because it doesnt even come close to that!! I liked the atmosphere and size of the restaurant.  The service was pretty bad.  We called while in the parking lot because it looked really busy but the hostess tells us theres no wait for 2 people.  So we walk in and she says it'll be about 5 minutes.  We could clearly see theres several open tables but whatever.  We stand there and 5 minutes later she decides to tell us ""oh, you can just go seat yourself over there""  Ummm okay.  Our server was very nice but I could tell he had more tables then he could handle because after he took our order we didnt see him again for 20 minutes.  We finished our beer and never got asked if we wanted another.  My glass of water remained empty for about 20 minutes.  If he was a bit more attentive I would've enjoyed my experience a lot more.  Medium pizza, 2 side salads, one pint of beer, and the sampler of 4 beers ($6.00) was $40.  All in all, it was nothing special. It tasted like Pizza Hut on a good night but tripple the price!!"
Tim J.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,3,2,1.0,10/12/2013,"Blown away at horrible my experience!  I'll keep it short as I don't want to waste any more of my time in this place.  I took my wife and her parents and we went on a Sat afternoon - busy but not incredibly busy.  What went wrong??  .....ordered a bowl of soup and received a cup (without soup crackers).  I had to track down server and tell him.  He said he would bring another cup...it never came.  I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich and it came out with LESS THAN ROOM TEMP fries.  If that wasn't enough...the grilled sourdough from the sandwich was COLD!!  Needless to say, I provided feedback, did not accept any other food or compensation and will NEVER return!  Even though I can't stand Denny's I would have rather eaten there!!!  YUCK! Save your money and avoid this place!"
Stace S.,"Pasadena, CA",53,46,9,4.0,6/25/2011,Love this place.  The staff has always been friendly and the service really good.   Parking is a pain in the butt during peak hours.   This is a go to place for us and it's never disappointed.
George H.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,3,,4.0,12/23/2013,This place is always consistent.  Good food and beer.
Amy H.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,19,,4.0,9/15/2013,"We discovered BJ's one night when we wanted to go to Dos Caminos, only to find it closed.  However, BJ's was a wonderful surprise and our new go-to when we want good food and to stay close to home. My favourite beer is the hefewisen (I'm not sure about the spelling).  I mentioned to the waiter that I liked Blue Moon and Shocktop, he suggested that beer, and I'm now hooked.  The pizza, calzones, and burgers are awesome.  My dad even orders a pizza and a burger because they are both so tasty, he takes one home to eat later! The service has always been prompt and friendly, it's not too loud or crowded, the TVs are plentiful and high enough so everyone has a good view of whatever game is going on, and the prices are reasonable, especially for Summerlin.  Our new favourite hangout :)"
Tyler M.,"Las Vegas, NV",31,9,,2.0,11/24/2013,"Placed an online to go order. Ordered a half sandwich and a house salad and a grilled BBQ pasta with a house salad. The total was $24. Yes, $24 for two lunch specials. Specials are typically discounted hence the ""special"" label. They obviously don't get that part or that's why they don't advertise the prices online. Went to pick up my order and found all of the to go order parking spots taken with no one in their cars and no one inside waiting for their orders.  The food was good but not great.  I suggest skipping their online ordering set up all together. It's not worth it"
