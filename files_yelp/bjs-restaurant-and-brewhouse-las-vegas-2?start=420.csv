Shannon S.,"Las Vegas, NV",149,378,17,5.0,8/29/2012,"Love the late happy hour, especially when I'm craving a Jerry Burst! Food and service are always good."
Myrna M.,"Westside, Las Vegas, NV",2,7,,3.0,4/4/2014,"The only reason I'm giving three stars is because of the food, which was amazing, but the service really took away from the overall experience. I understand that establishments are weary to serve teenagers, but that's no reason to be treated like we're below the status of a regular customer. Every time our server spoke to us, I felt like we were being scoffed at. Not every teenager tips just below the minimum, so if that was the reason why the service was horrible, you won't be seeing me or my family here anytime soon. My party isn't stupid, we know the norms of tipping and dining out. I was excited to bring my foreign exchange student here to enjoy the highly regarded burgers, but the embarrassment my whole party experienced overshadowed it all. the waiter actually had the guts to scream at her because she couldn't hear him when he brought all the food to our table. first of all, the place is always filled with people, resulting in a volume problem. Second, she doesn't speak good English! we seriously had to endure him directly shouting at her and giving us attitude when she didn't speak up saying it wasn't her food, even going as far as to say ""you need to speak up next time."" I haven't even stopped laughing because, really, this will be the last time me and my party will dine here after this experience. Bj's should know not every patron is the same, so why were we treated like every other  teenager who dines out? pathetic."
Bill Y.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,21,4,4.0,4/16/2013,"I have eaten there a few times, i have had the rib eye with baked potato, that tater was huge, rib eye had good flavor and it was medium rare as I ordered. I have also had the bbq chicken salad and sante fe salad as well as the wings, all delicious and not only that but the p lace can be packed and you still get your food fast and hot. Worth trying for sure"
Tom R.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,4,3,5.0,9/4/2014,My wife and I go here quite a bit and always receive great service and perfect food. The deep dish pizza is always prepared just right. We usually split the santa fe chicken salad as well and have not been disappointed.
Audra R.,"Orange County, CA",530,858,157,5.0,12/28/2010,"It's odd coming from CA, service at restaurants in Vegas is WAY SUPERIOR.  It's not suzy moron college student serving you, it's people that have spouses and families trying to make a decent living. So yeah excellent service. Layout and seating great at this location. Lettuce wraps were off the hook!  And they now have a child sized pizzooki HELL YEAH!"
Neal S.,"Denton, TX",9,38,,2.0,5/28/2012,"Why go here?   Seriously.   Everything here is about as exciting as the Cheesecake Factory.  And by that I mean there is no taste, no excitement, and no flavor.  But for those of you who like safe dependable food that fails to deliver an iota of anything unique, this place is for you.  As I struggle to find something good to say about this place, I guess I will mention that the service is always bright and cheerful.  Of course bright and cheerful service is over rated in my world.  For those of you who enjoy unblemished mediocrity I encourage you to eat here."
Traci H.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,115,2,5.0,2/11/2013,Great pizza! Love their locally-brewed root beer. Fun for the kids too.
Fred F.,"Las Vegas, NV",50,227,,1.0,8/10/2012,I'm prejudice against chains already but I just don't understand how this place stays busy.  The pizza dough is literally the old Pizza Hut pan pizza recipe.  It's expensive and nasty.
Kailey G.,"Southwest, Las Vegas, NV",18,18,3,5.0,5/21/2013,"My boyfriend and I love going to yard house. The food is great and the service is great as well. Our waiter Name was April sunshine, And she was the best! she had the best customer service, She was friendly and nice. We are definitely asking for her next time we go."
Mike L.,"Seaside, CA",35,151,87,5.0,7/18/2010,"BJs Pizza....In the words of Bret Hart, the best there is, the best there was, the best there ever will be.  There may be a bit of hyperbole there, but damn, I'd be hard-pressed to say that ive ever tried a better pizza and thats saying something since this is a chain. I've been frequenting both the San Jose, Roseville and Las Vegas locations (yeah, i get around) for almost four years and finally have the sense of mind to review it.  Whats nice about this place is that no matter which location you go to, you can always expect consistency.  Great ambiance, great food and great fun are to be had at each location and you can really tell the company strives for it. Where to start, oh yeah, PIZZA!  The pizza is amazing.  It is the deep dish style not to be confused with the stuffed type youd get at Zacharys in the yay area or Giordano's in the Chi. The pizza is baked to perfection, has the right bit of crunch to it and is just generally good all over.  The sandwiches, beer and desserts are nothing to scoff at either.  Please try a Pizookie if you ever get the opportunity.  I'd rank it right up there with the White Molten Chocolate Cake (believe it or not) at Chili's or the Brownie Sundae at MRKT inside the Aliante Casino in North Las Vegas. Do yourself a favor, eat at BJ's."
Thao T.,"Las Vegas, NV",56,58,18,4.0,3/2/2010,"The highlight: Wine half off  on Tuesdays.  That's a deal. It goes for both bottles and by the glass.  I believe the special applies all day long and not only during happy hour (3-7pm).  They have the basics:  their ""house wine"" is barefoot (listed at $19/bottle) but with the special it comes out to be very similar to what you can get it for at Trader Joe's.    I shared the homemade Kettle Style Potato chips ($3): good choice. I also shared the flatbread Margherita Fresca pizza which I don't strongly recommend;  It was $9 and barely any tomatoes.  Mainly just cheese with specs of tomatoes.  I just ate here earlier today and had a great time.  There's a good overall ambiance with the music, the service, and the continuous crowd coming in and out (It's a tuesday evening and it was still crowded by 10PM).  I probably would come back because of it's convenient location, minimal wait and decent prices."
L J.,"Independence, OH",0,7,,1.0,10/21/2014,"Server took ten minutes to come to the table. Spinach dip came out very cold. How hard is it to microwave? Meal came out wrong as well.  Overall, generic and poor execution."
Brandon A.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,13,,5.0,2/23/2013,"I go here a lot, it's one of my favorite restaurants. Everything I have gotten here is amazing.One of my favorites is the Parmesan crusted chicken, the pizza is also great any day. But when you are there you must get the pizookie, it's a gift from above. Deep dish cookie with cool sweet ice cream on top is a great dessert for any time of the year. And to drink they brew their own root beer and cream sodas, also as you may guess it is off the wall good. In my book BJ's is a necessity."
Craig K.,"Las Vegas, NV",33,8,2,5.0,2/21/2013,"So good! This my first time here. Service was awesome. The beers are great. The calamari was good (worst thing I can say). The ribeye with horseradish mash and red wine mushroom sauce was fantastic! Servers name was Carrie. She was absolutely perfect. Quick, on the spot, got the orders right and didn't hover. Great night out with my wife!!!"
Chrisjan Y.,"Las Vegas, NV",58,208,61,5.0,8/11/2010,"It's been awhile since I've eaten at Bj's. I love the Blonde beer. The last time I found hair in my food and the service was great. Yesterday we were there for an early dinner. We grabbed some calamari, avocado egg rolls and the sampler. Then 2 mini pizza's. Everything was excellent! Especially the service! I will be back to eat here again."
Denise N.,"Boulder, CO",38,37,14,4.0,1/7/2010,"We were pretty pleased with the food, drinks & service at BJ's. Typically when me & the hubster are in Vegas we're visiting family so we tend to stay away from the Strip and just relax... which is sometime hard in Vegas. BJ's is so chill it's easy to feel comfortable. Though its a chain restaurant, they've hit the nail on the head with stellar service and strong drinks.   Lots of beer choices and like Ken. M said, they're one seasonal beer on tap is a killer hit (at least with my hubby!) I had one of the strongest cosmos Id gotten in a long time and that was perfectly fine with me considering we were there with the in-laws ;) Nonetheless, when you're in Vegas and either want a break from the Strip or just someplace to feel comfortable, watch the game and put a few back, BJ's should be just perfect!"
Nick W.,"Salt Lake City, UT",26,84,27,4.0,1/21/2010,"BJ's is a great place. Great food, great beer, great hand crafted root beer (according to my son,) and great service. BJ's offers healthy size portions (often enough to keep me in left overs for a day or two at our family condo.) I highly recommend any of the specialty salads or the stuffed baked potatoes, which are a meal in themselves. If you are up for some beer - the 7 beer sampler fits the bill to start. I would recommend the Tatonka Stout if you like dark beer. BJ's also offers some hard ciders and regular mixed drinks. Watch for BJ's happy hour - most mini pizzas and appetizers are 1/2 price later in the evening in the bar.  BJ's is great for kids and offers several kid's selections (that are adult size meals.) Most come with an included drink - my son always gets the handcrafted root beer, which is a lot better than the other soft drinks. Grab a bit at BJ's - you won't be disappointed. They have a great take out too if you want to avoid the line."
Mary Beth A.,"Canmore, Canada",0,19,,4.0,4/8/2013,Excellent service and the place was packed! Our server Christy D. was on it. She checked on us regularly and we never felt neglected though we could tell she was slammed. We requested 2 beer samples and she brought a third she thought we might like. We did and ordered a pitcher of it. We ordered avocado egg rolls & the BJ's bacon cheeseburger pizza and the food was very tasty.
Lindsey B.,"Las Vegas, NV",102,248,17,5.0,11/30/2009,"My husband and I come here probably once a week.  Where do I begin?! Below is what we LOVE: 1. Apps: -Potato Skins -Chicken Pot Stickers -Avocado Egg Rolls -Chicken Wings -Chips & Salsa (yes, their salsa is good!) 2. Salads: -Caesar Salad (with chicken) -Honey-Crisp Chicken Salad -Santa Fe Salad 3. Pasta: -Angel Hair Toscana -Grilled Chicken Pasta 4. Entrees: -Parmesan Crusted Chicken Breast (SO GOOD!  My husband get's this almost everytime!) 5. Sandwiches: -Angus Roast Beef Dip -Crispy Chicken We actually haven't had their pizza, but all our friends say they are delicious!  We always love what we get, so its hard to try new things. If you have room for desert (servings are VERY generous) then you gotta try the Pizookie.  Huge cookie with ice cream. Great Beer & Drink Menu.  Casual, so you can come in your jeans. They have something for everyone... I'm sure we will be there again this week!"
S K.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,24,,4.0,9/9/2012,"I recently moved to the area and while getting unpacked and settled, I grabbed take out from here about twice/week. I tried similiar type restaurants in the area (i..e, Claim Jumper) but have found the quality of food and friendliness of staff much stronger here than other places.  There have a been a few issues - one time, despite waiting to pick up for until the 15-20 minute ready time, my order hadn't been put in yet. Another time, a salad with the dinner didn't make it into my bag (and I didn't realize this until I got home). Both times, however, the staff was super responsive. With the delayed order, the manager comped the meal without a complaint from me. Likewise with the missing salad - I called and asked them to just make a note for the next time I was going to be in (b/c with boxes still unpacked, it was inevitable I'd be in again) but they comped the entire entree. When I went in the other day, they also gave me a complimentary gift card for future orders. I've not eaten in the restaurant, so I can't attest to the service of the waitstaff (as mentioned by several people in previous posts), but the take-out order staff is super friendly, accomodating, and easy to deal with.  The food is pretty good. It's not fancy, gourmet style. It's quality comfort-type food that's much better than bigger chains (i..e, Applebee's, Chili's).  They have the best mashed potatoes in the area. Their salmon is excellent, and the parmasan chicken was really good too. I don't like their fish and chips, but I've not found a local/Summerlin restaurant that does fish and chips well. (But am still looking!)  I'd definitely recommend this place and think it has 5-star potential (but need to eat in to find out)."
