J M.,"Las Vegas, NV",719,11,8,1.0,7/26/2012,Dont do it!!! Food poisoning from the happy hour chicken taco's...i would have rather ran a marathon than get that sick ever AGAIN!!!
Jerome M.,"Santa Ana, CA",118,22,1,4.0,12/19/2012,"The atmosphere here was pretty relaxed and they have a wide selection of beers, which is always awesome. Every time I come here the service is always excellent and the food is amazing."
Jorge L.,"Henderson, NV",1,10,21,1.0,10/11/2012,No good customer service even when restaurant is almost empty!!! Left after 10 min waiting in the bar area and it's not the 1st time!!!!
Marie O.,"Ypsilanti, MI",19,8,13,4.0,11/10/2012,"The BEER is AWESOME! We are beer lovers and this place has a great selection of micro-brew, although a bit pricey at $5 a pint, it is worth it! We ordered the deep dish pizza, half bbq chicken and half white(alfredo), yeah that's right you can get half and half! It was good, although it seemed like is was just reheated to order and not freshly cooked because it wasn't really hot and you could tell that the halfs had not been cooked together, that was a little disappointing but it still had a good flavor. The cilantro on the bbq chicken was a winner for me, I wasn't that into the white side honestly. The Pazookie's though, holy hot cookie with ice cream on top! We ordered the sampler so we could try 3 different flavors and it was heavenly! If you love beer, go here! But be willing to spend some dough!"
Hui P.,"Las Vegas, NV",35,7,,4.0,9/4/2012,"This is the spot to go! I go there for family dinners, watching a game or just gathering with friends! they have a great variety of food and the staff are very friendly! the deep dished oven pizza is a must try! and their famous dessert poozkie!!!"
Andrew R.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,18,,5.0,1/22/2013,"Definitely one of my favorite restaurants. Food is amazing, the pazooki's are to die for, service is usually pretty good, decor is nice, great looking bar. Not a big drinker but i hear the beers are great! This place is highly recommended."
Nick F.,"Ballwin, MO",91,269,2,3.0,3/9/2012,"Its BJs, a chain with a obscenely huge menu, which I feel can be a red flag for not fresh food.  But it is what it is, just decent bar food, good beers, and usually pretty easy to get in an out of.  I dont think I can justify giving a chain 5 stars."
Elbert S.,"Las Vegas, NV",27,68,5,5.0,5/2/2012,Had the crispy jalapenos Burger and wedge fries with a few Oasis beers. Devoured and ravaged this burger. Love this place and its pizookie!!!! Service was good just took awhile to get our drink orders.
Max M.,"Tulsa, OK",14,16,45,5.0,6/2/2011,"BJ's is, and has been for over seven years, my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas; and I have been to A LOT of restaurants all over town. To me, a great restaurant is one that has an enjoyable environment, great food, good service, and fair prices. BJ's definitely has all of these qualities.  To begin, the environment is very welcoming and well-kept. The restaurant has a big city, Chicago style, feel to it and offers both bar/lounge area seating with a full bar and several flat screen TV's all around the restaurant. The dining room offers booth seating for two, four, or up to eight and tables for a small party of a couple friends or a huge party of a high school archery team, (I tried going with something other than football team, you get the point...). The lights are slightly dim to keep the mood somewhat mellow, but the TV's and music keep the restaurant upbeat--it's a good balance for a good environment.  The food at BJ's is awesome! They offer a great selection of appetizers which are perfect to share, as well as smaller sized appetizers, ""Tiny Bites,"" which make perfect individual appetizers or sides. My personal favorites are the Chicken Pesto flatbread pizza, (appetizer to share), and the gourmet mac & cheese, (individual ""tiny bite""). As far as the main entrees, BJ's offers a wide variety of foods ranging from classic burgers to Italian inspired pastas to Teriyaki Chicken to Grilled Salmon and even some Jambalaya. BJ's also has some delectable gourmet salads and wholesome soups. My favorite entrée has to be the Parmesan Crusted Chicken with steamed broccoli and mashed potatoes.  There is a large selection of drinks offered at BJ's, from the full bar to specialty drinks, both alcoholic and non, as well as their signature hand-crafted root beer, cream soda, orange cream soda, and black cherry soda.    Now for the good part--the desserts. BJ's is known for their pizookies. Pizookies are cookies, baked in a pizza pan, served hot out of the oven with two scoops of ice cream on top. They have the classic Chocolate Chip pizookie with vanilla bean ice cream on top as well as quite a few other flavors such as Triple Chocolate, White Chocolate Macadamia Nut, and, newly added, Red Velvet. There's also an Oatmeal Raisin pizookie for those of you who like to feel like you're eating healthy even while having dessert. BJ's also offers beignets and an ice cream sundae as well as a couple other dessert items.  Almost every time I have been to BJ's, the staff has been very friendly. Only a couple times have I ever had an issue with a server or host. If my order is ever made incorrectly, which rarely happens, the server will gladly take it back and bring me the correct order as well as give me some sort of compensation, such as a discount or free dessert.  The prices are really good for a restaurant such as this one. They have lunch specials during the week which are only about 6-8 dollars. As far as the prices on the regular menu, most of the items range anywhere from 10 to 18 dollars with a few exceptions being slightly  higher or lower.  In all, BJ's is a great place to have a quick lunch, to go on a date, or to take the family out for dinner. It is very unlikely that you will be disappointed with this restaurant, (unless, of course, you are a complete restaurant snob who will complain about the most insignificant things), and I do hope that you give BJ's a visit in the near future."
Leah S.,"Las Vegas, NV",40,13,3,4.0,5/1/2012,"Ive been here numerous times. A good place for consistent food and drinks when shopping or errands on that side of town. This review is for Friday night with a group of 7 at around 7pm. We were expecting a wait (it's Friday at dinner rush) so my husband & I got there early and ordered drinks at the bar after putting our names on the list. The wait was an hour - typical for a popular restaurant on a Friday night. We enjoyed a glass of Pinot and a house lager before the rest of our party joined us. We were so lucky- an 8 top table in the bar area opened up and we swooped it up! I prefer bar dining, anyways. We are a low maintenance group that understands the workings of a busy restaurant. Our server was friendly and efficient for how busy she was. We ordered the avocado rolls, calamari and boneless buffalo wings for apps. Everyone had beer or cocktails and started Cesar salads. Everything was timed right and satisfying. We ordered 3 pizzas (theirs are deep dish). My husband asked for no tomatoes on ours and they made with tomatoes- but they realized the mistake and started making one without while leaving the pizza with so we weren't eating after the rest of our group. The server was apologetic and the manager brought the correct pizza out when it was ready.  They handled the situation correctly and we were happy with the service. For some people this would ruin their dinner... But really- stuff happens, the apologized and fixed it! What more could you ask for?!?"
Samantha R.,"Las Vegas, NV",48,75,,2.0,6/3/2012,I am not a big fan of this place always way to loud really greasy food and unfriendly staff.
Natasha R.,"Las Vegas, NV",77,50,78,3.0,9/20/2011,Yum! The food is great especially the avocado egg rolls!!!Of course the pizookies are awesome. Dont count on great customer service. The hostess are almost never nice but I guess it's so busy that they just don't care. Asked about there happy hour and the sever told me that she didn't know. She didnt even try to find out... Awesome.... They have two different type of fries and they almost always bring my bf the wrong one and he usually doesn't say anything but the last time it happened I politely said they were the wrong ones and the food runner jut picked up the plate without saying anything and walked away. Very awkward. So I usually just try to order to go now since it's usually not a pleasant experience. Maybe it's too busy and the staff is just overworked? Not sure and don't really car.
Randy R.,"Chicago, IL",7,178,43,3.0,12/29/2011,"I've eaten here several times and the food is decent.  Not great, but about average for what you would expect from a chain ""brewpub.""  I do enjoy the loaded baked potatoes that they offer and their beers are pretty good."
David W.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,3,,4.0,5/21/2014,This place has awesome food and the prices are very reasonable.  They actually have carry out too.  They don't advertise the carry out much at all because it is a huge costs savings.  I went into the restaurant and ordered food to go and waited for it.  What would have cost me roughly $120.00 in the restaurant plus the tip only cost me about $55.00 out the door.   I couldn't believe it.  Their pizza is the best that I have had in las vegas and it takes a little bit of time if you order one but it is well worth the wait.
Nicole P.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,6,,4.0,9/27/2012,Love this place! The menu as a nice variety of items and at good prices. My whole family enjoys going there. And I love that they add a rewards card.
Jason F.,"Holladay, UT",46,235,119,4.0,9/22/2009,"This southern California transplant is a good, fun restaurant. Located across the street from the Red Rock Casino in Summerlin it is nice and new and in a nice part of town.  They have a huge selection of beers to choose from. The menu has just about something for everyone. They have lots of deep dish pizzas to choose from as well. The pizza is what they are known for. The service was friendly and fast. BJ's has a desert called a Pizookie, which is a baked cookie topped with two scoops of ice cream and served in a dish.You can choose from chocolate chunk, white chocolate macadamia nut, peanut butter or oatmeal raisin walnut ice cream. Totally not healthy and totally yummy."
Hillary S.,"Las Vegas, NV",117,56,7,4.0,9/20/2011,"We eat here so often, it's only fair that I write a review.  When we can't decide where to have dinner, we go to BJ's.  They seem to have something to please almost everyone.  I usually get the Broccoli Alfredo potato with extra sauce... yum!   Good service, good value.  Great place to bump into your Summerlin neighbors. I appreciate that you can call ahead & be placed on the seating list - sometimes the wait can be upwards of 45 minutes, so calling ahead really saves time, especially when I'm with the 10-year old (or if my guy is hungry... and cranky!)"
Jorj L.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,3,,1.0,8/3/2010,The reviews of this place makes me rethink using yelp altogether.  The rumors must be true and you can pay to have bad reviews removed.  This place is a JOKE!   The food.  Uninspired TGIF fare.  Do we really need another restaurant to do chicken lettuce wraps or avocado egg rolls? WEAK! The fact that this place is crowded makes me sad about our little hamlet called summerlin. The decor is horrendous.  A big box warehouse.  It's like eating at Costco.  No disrespect to Costco. The service.  I'll have a double serving of homogenized corporate insincerity. No doubt corporate headquarters has paid the bounty to Yelp to keep this one highly rated.  We'll see how long this review lasts.
D. L.,"Las Vegas, NV",3,36,,1.0,5/15/2013,"I ordered a bacon cheeseburger with well done bacon and american cheese. The burger came out and the bacon was raw so I sent it back 10 mins later the burger comes out, bacon well done but with chedder cheese. The manager comes to the table and said the closet cheese they have to american is chedder so I asked for no cheese the waiter comes to my table and said ""I entered in the computer american cheese"" I explained to the waiter that his manager indicated that BJ's doesn't offer american cheese so I'm not sure how you would be able to enter something that you don't carry??? Liar!"
My T.,"Las Vegas, NV",209,188,156,4.0,8/19/2011,"Since joining Lifetime Athletics, my cravings for carbs have intensified immensely. Growing up in a Vietnamese house hold, you'd think the first thing I go for is white rice or noodles. But you're wrong! My craving is for the Chicken Parm with Spicy Marinara served with garlic toast. It's really the spicy punch of of the sauce and the crispy flattened chicken that scratches my itchin'.  If you can make it out of the restaurant without ordering the Pizookie, you can call it a healthy success with dining out."
