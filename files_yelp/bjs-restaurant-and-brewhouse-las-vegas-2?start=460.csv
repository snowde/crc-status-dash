Christina R.,"Las Vegas, NV",42,19,5,4.0,11/14/2013,"I don't personally love chain restaurants, but at least it's always consistent. Tonight we had avocado egg rolls (not as good as Cheesecake Factory) and an individual sized hand tossed pizza. They let us do half BBQ chicken and half spicy meatball. Some places don't let you do half and half if there are two different sauce bases (which is ridiculous, but I appreciate it even more when they do it).  Both were good, but the best thing is that we got Happy Hour prices even though we showed up at around 7:15! Our waitress told us that if the game is still on (its Thursday night football), the HH prices continue. Sweet!"
Shige O.,"North Las Vegas, NV",508,157,54,5.0,4/10/2011,Food here was totally worth the wait. I must admit the line was quite long. They do not take phone reservations. So i suggest you plan for an off night if your doing a bigger party of 5+. The service here once seated is definitely fast and so is the food. The prices were super reasonable for the amount and the quality of food served. Absolutely one of my new fav. places to eat here in Las Vegas. Dress at your own comfort but i suggest casual as it is not someplace you wana come to in your pajamas. Parking is also very abundant. There alcohol selection is definitely great as well especially if you are a beer fan.
Juan Diego D.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,17,,5.0,1/19/2012,Great place awesome pizza and great beer oh and the red velvet pizookie is out of this world and speedy friendly service
Grace C.,"Oakland, CA",54,225,3,5.0,7/12/2009,"Where do I begin..... I've been to BJ's many times in Northern California and it's a pretty good restaurant. Anyhow my sis and I were staying at Red Rock and wanted something other than a buffet/fastfood/$$$restaurant so we decided to come here. The food is pretty much the same across the board which is great because I hate inconsistency when it comes to chain restaurants. This restaurant has PHENOMENAL service. The hostess that sat us was very sweet and our server [whose name I'm unsure of] was AMAZING. She was attentive, sweet, and just a great server. We ended up getting a pitcher of beer, artichoke dip/bruschetta, nachos, and a parmesan crusted chicken entree all for under $60!  Note: On the check it said our server was Cinnamon. Not sure if that's a birth-given name or a nickname... Cinnamon was the shit!"
Rhonda W.,"North Las Vegas, NV",87,207,22,3.0,7/11/2011,Hmmm the service was really bad the night I came ... We got our appetizers before we even got our waters ..!! The food tho was decent ... If you come sit at the bar ... Otherwise you'll be totally ignored by your server!
Viki M.,"Las Vegas, NV",31,21,1,5.0,9/20/2011,"Best Brewery in Town.  Great Beer, Great Food, Great Service!  We had the Pizza Deal thay have and The Portabello Mushroom Pizza was to die for.......so juicy and yummy!   My boyfriend had the Cheeseburger Pizza, which he loved - I'm not a huge fan,  I pefer a cheeseburger if I'm in thw mood.  However, there is something for everybody there, and a wide variety of beers!  Thank you BJ's for a special night out with my man"
Taylor L.,"McKinney, TX",150,32,45,3.0,1/7/2011,"This is a reliable spot near my house, but it certainly isn't anything special. The prices are a great value, but the wait on the weekends is beyond ridiculous and the parking situation is a deterrent. My favorite thing is the Gourmet Mac and Cheese on the small appetizer menu. Food tastes a little processed and unhealthy, but it is basically all bar food."
Tiana H.,"Austin, TX",1021,568,255,5.0,8/11/2010,"Mmmmmm. Can you say Pizookie?! Giant Stuffed Potato?! Seriously some really good food. Great prices. Currently they have a 2 for 19.99 special: 2 soups or salad, a medium specialty pizza, and a pizookie! I was stuffed, and when I left, my wallet still was. I go here at least a few times a month, and never have been disappointed! Better than Chili's, and come in at a tie with Cheesecake Factory for best cheap, date night eats :)"
Trish B.,"Las Vegas, NV",77,46,37,4.0,6/17/2011,Love the fried artichokes and Parmesan crusted chicken! It's all I order!
Tom A.,"Los Angeles, CA",196,121,1,3.0,5/21/2011,"Bar food style place ... Good service. Note to self: return for the Avocado Rolls, skip the other 3 items in the 4 item appetizer sampler. Pizza is OK, but Chicago deep dish is not my favorite style. Menu is so extensive, I'll have to go back a few times to figure out what I like."
Angelita G.,"Las Vegas, NV",19,31,,5.0,7/21/2009,"Every single time I go here everyone from the host to the servers remember my name and my drink, and I only go there 2-3 times a month. I usually go during happy hour for their half off mini pizzas which are to die for!! The BBQ chicken cannot be beat, I have 99% of the time. Plus, their pizookie is AMAZING!! I will miss this joint when I move back to Green Valley but they just opened a new in Henderson. GO to this place if you want happy servers/bartenders, awesome music that isn't too loud for conversation, and a huge food selection. Like most places, it's a madhouse after 6!"
Jesse K.,"Las Vegas, NV",21,143,5,4.0,7/18/2011,"I'm going to give them a four star rating because of their pazookie dessert.  If you haven't tried or heard about a pazookie you must check it out.  It's one of the most delicious desserts in town.  It's a homemade cookie I. A deep dish pizza pan cooked 3/4 of the way through top end with a n amazing vanilla ice-cream.  The bar is hopping with dozens of beer options on tap and in bottles.  Menu is huge and all over the place, I'm not a big fan of the entrees.  Apps are good and dessert is fantastic!"
Theodora K.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,8,,3.0,1/15/2014,"I've been there twice and looks ok. Nothing special to me, decent food, good beer but I am not going craze for it!. Fried calamari a bit greasy but tasty, fish tacos ok, steak was very good. I love coffee and they don't serve cappuccino. Great service!"
Malcom S.,"Las Vegas, NV",66,12,5,5.0,9/25/2011,Man I forgot how good the pizza was. It was thick crunch yet soft. My wife and I will definitely go back. And the service was good. I think our server was over sat with customers but he did his best to make it pleasant.
Oakley G.,"Las Vegas, NV",7,32,1,3.0,12/17/2011,"Food is fine. Atmosphere is casual. Beer selection was limited. I consider it a decent place for bite but, nothing memorable. They do have a wide selection of entrees if you have a large hard to please group."
Stephanie S.,"Seattle, WA",344,221,27,3.0,12/28/2008,"Good chain. Pretty fast. The deep dish pizzas aren't really deep dish like Chicago (saucy and soupy) more like a pan crust pizza from pizza hut but still pretty good to eat and definitely better than the average Chicago want to be. Haven't had the beer here but they have a great happy hour around 5.  Biggest recommendation would be to order the world famous pizzuki, a giant cookie in a skillet covered in ice cream. Wow."
Bryan S.,"Las Vegas, NV",15,241,34,3.0,2/17/2011,"The pizza is always good, but when you use fresh jalapenos on something use them sparingly!  Went there for lunch yesterday and while they seemed staffed service was slow. At one point it took 10 min to get a refill on water!"
Stacey G.,"Carol Stream, IL",5,19,,4.0,8/22/2008,"I come to this place every time I visit Vegas.  The beers are good. The food is great and reasonably priced  My personal favorite is the pesto cilantro pizza, but I have really liked everything I've had there. It is a really fun place to hang out at the bar.  My favorite bartender there, Mike, is quite the  charmer.  It's always nice to be flirted with, even if you are old enough to be his..uh.. slightly older sister. I had to take away one star because the kitchen and bar close way too early."
Mary H.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,16,1,5.0,10/29/2013,"I love this place! I've been here a number of times and the food and service is always good.  Lot's of different choices on the menu, and their pizookie's are amazing!!"
Richard N.,"Las Vegas, NV",13,54,,4.0,8/20/2008,"Pretty slick place! (I felt under dressed in my shorts, no worries though) Nice room. Will seat 100+. Someone paid attention to details here! Great graphics on the walls, the logo's for their homebrew styled beers are excellent. Meaning they make you want to order and drink them (thats what a good logo does)   Well crafted brews I will add. 7 are on tap year round with an additional 10+ specialty (seasonal) brews. ex: Pumpkin Ale, and Oktoberfest Marzen coming Oct./Nov. It's a large menu. Listing Cocktails and Wines  throughout the Beers, Appetizers, Soups/Salads, Pizza, Burgers, Pastas, Entrees, and into the Kid's Menu. Tip: Dessert, try the PIZOOKIE®!! don't ask, just Do It! Nice Bar too. You are welcome to eat a full menu there. But, before 7pm daily all appetizers 1/2 off (bar only) just an fyi. So I am told. I did not do this this visit.   (Sliders (4) Angus Beef is $7.95 w/ fries take 1/2 off before 7pm)  Service was excellent. Food was good. Interesting variety well executed. Big room, and it was filling to Full by 7pm, noise was very tolerable. So if you find yourself on the westside near Red Rock Casino, BJ's is across the street. Easy parking. And they also have have ""Curbside pick up"" for To-Go ordering  Hours: 11am-10 pm Sun-Thurs 11am- 11pm Fri-Sat No gaming that I saw either. (Nice break) 2 Nevada locations and plenty more "
