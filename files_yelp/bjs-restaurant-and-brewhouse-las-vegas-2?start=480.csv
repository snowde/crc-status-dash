Tina S.,"Las Vegas, NV",44,92,14,3.0,11/10/2010,"Have eaten here a number of times. Their Sunday brunch was excellent, their regular menu is good, nothing too memorable except for the pizookie. Service was excellent this last visit for brunch. Would go here again."
Angela S.,"Dallas, TX",115,51,41,5.0,1/26/2011,Stopped in before work to grab something and they had a veggie burger... It was so good... If you aren't that big on eating meat or just want a good veggie burger... Go to BJ's... The potatoes are really good too...
Candace P.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,24,,4.0,4/12/2011,"Great service, great food and great atmosphere! They have a wide variety of stuff on the menu ranging from bar fare to tapas style smaller plates to specialty drinks and some great desserts. We started with the fried artichokes - crispy on the outside, tender on the inside. The aoili dipping sauce was perfect. I dined on the open faced pot roast sandwich which was super tender. It actually tasted home cooked. It was served over garlic toast and mashed potatoes and covered in a brown jus gravy. Mmmmmm. Seriously yummy. For dessert we had the beignet. Um, yes. YES. It was covered in real strawberries and whipped cream and ice cream and was friggin' delicious. This place was a nice surprise."
Eric S.,"Las Vegas, NV",789,425,57,4.0,5/12/2012,"BJ's is a fun place to go if you aren't on a diet.  I am not certain there is anything on the menu that is a healthy choice, even items listed as a healthy choice.  BUT, if you go there for the food, you won't be disappointed.  From their Avacodo Egg Rolls to their Chicago-esque pizza, they know how to make their food.  They recently added ""small plates"" to their menu, 8 -10 mini appetizers for between 2-4 dollars each.  We decided to sample as many as we could and ordered Thai won tons, meatballs, a mozzerella salad, and fried artichokes.  The Artichokes were surprisingly good with large pieces of artichoke beneath a breading that didn't zap the flavor of the choke.  The dipping sauce was good but not perfect.  The meatballs failed miserably as they stunk like yesterday's laundry.  They tasted ok but the smell really curdled our appetite.  Luckily the Thai chicken won tons were excellent.  Add to that a wedge salad, housebrewed root beer and cream soda, and a kids meal and the three of us got out for under $40.00 with full tummies!  And the kids Pazooki comes with their meal and is big enough fo the adults to sample without stuffing it in."
J J.,"Chicago, IL",0,86,,3.0,11/15/2011,Consistently average. The best part of the place is the beer flights.  For the brews alone it is worth a visit.
Michael H.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,5,,4.0,7/2/2010,This is one of my sister & mine favorite places to munch... We went tonight & only had beers... while we normally we eat & indulge in the wicked selection of draft brews... from their house brews to the wide selection of more comerial beers... I don't think I drink the same beer twice in a visit... as always the service was awesome... never had an empty glass... the check was under 20 bucks for 6 beers.... not bad... now I've never sat any where but the bar so all I can vouche for are the bartenders... but they're good... so
Janell C.,"Henderson, NV",0,21,,3.0,8/19/2012,"We go to BJ's  about every 6 weeks, and I like the atmosphere and the food,  but the service on every occasion I have eaten there is awful !  Why can't they get some decent servers?  It almost ruins a nice dinner.   Also it would be nice if the salads, and appetizers came out well before the main couirse  food, however they either forget them altogether, or you are in the middle of eating your salad when your hot food shows up. They can't get it right, it seems.  Even the manager can't seem to help the situation."
William C.,"Brooklyn, NY",950,826,77,3.0,9/24/2008,"Not much to say. Very typical type of spot. Nice look and feel. Decent food. Didnt blow me away, but maybe that is because I didnt try their famous pizza.  I'll update the next time I am out there, but that is only if I actually feel like going back. I recommend it more as a spot to fit a bunch of friends who want to grab some cold ones and some grub while watching the games."
John O.,"Las Vegas, NV",4,2,,5.0,5/14/2011,"Great beer, menu has something for everyone, and prices are reasonable.  What not to like.  Had the grilled pork chops -- but prepared like the new low calorie dish.  These were excellent. Great spicy sauce. Red potatoes were good too.  Abbey Normal season beer was great."
Jake M.,"North Las Vegas, NV",69,5,1,5.0,9/20/2011,"This is a great place to dine on your lunch break from work or happy hour.Great food and a casual atmosphere.Mostly everything on there menu is a A+.I eat here for lunch,at least three times a week.Pretty Crowded around noon hours."
Alan H.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,16,,5.0,6/30/2013,Great food and friendly service. No wait for a table in the bar area.  Ice cold beer selection too.  Thanks. The giant stuffed potato was great.
Mike H.,"Juneau, AK",15,17,,2.0,6/26/2011,"PROS: +Excellent Service +Pizookie ('nuff said) +Large entrees CONS: -The beer was lack luster and forgettable. If a dessert outshines the beer at a brewery, something is amiss. -This pub is a local favorite so it gets very crowded and noisy around happy hour. BOTTOM LINE Go there for an appetizer and then the Pizookie. If it is your first time, get the mini trio. Do not try to get an entree and then the Pizzokie or you'll be sorry. My wife and I enjoy microbreweries and independents but decided to try this chain (107 restaurants as of June 2011). It was a good dessert experience, but we probably wouldn't go there again."
Justin W.,"Las Vegas, NV",8,55,1,5.0,4/18/2010,"My girlfriend and I went here just last night, and it was amazing like always.  Their pizza is one of the best I have ever had.  They have all of the traditional toppings, but their specialty pizzas are to die for.  I had a buffalo chicken pizza that was spot on and amazing.  Their always seems to be a long wait (and for good reason), so make sure to call ahead.  Also, their desert 'Pizookie', which is a cookie topped with ice cream cooked in a small pizza pan, is a perfect end to a meal."
Ronnie R.,"Lakewood, CA",28,17,3,4.0,8/18/2010,"Love the food and the beer what more is there to say. Oh yea, the pizza is real good but kinda pricey if you get a lot of toppings."
Krystal P.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,31,3,5.0,4/2/2011,"Quickly climbing the charts as my favorite place to eat in town is BJ's! Their menu is incredible, their beer and wine list is excellent, and their service is great! Hubby got a huge burger that he quickly devoured. I ordered the Alfredo pizza (made from scratch) and it was the best pizza I've ever had! The kids got the mac and cheese and devoured it of course! To top off the dinner we had the chocolate chip pizzone, which was to die for! Be sure to call ahead and put your name on the list as this place is always packed, and for good reason! Run, don't walk, to this place."
Akinyele O.,"Salt Lake City, UT",6,22,1,3.0,7/12/2010,"Tasty food and the beer choices are solid. I really enjoyed their house pale ale paired with a tasty, but not spectacular, vegetarian pizza.  This is good place to go with a group, keep in mind that it is impossible to get a table on a Friday night.   I find this place on the spendy side. However, the lunch and happy hour specials are a good deal, so try it hit those if you're a miserly cheapskate like me.  Tenaya Creek offers better beers, Big Dogs boasts more enticing food options; BJ's is a solid choice if you're in the neighborhood.  Minus a point because it is, and feels like, a corporate chain."
Mimi R.,"Tampa, FL",2,80,162,5.0,6/19/2010,"Excellent food, great customer seervice, nice selection of beer. This place is always consistent. They always greet you with smiles at the door. The food is delicious.  I like their pizzas and burgers. The menu has something for everyone- sandwiches, meatloaf, chicken, lettuce wraps, ribs, fish, etc. Everything comes in large portions too. You must save room for dessert! Try a pizookie! It's a fresh baked cookie with ice cream.  They come in different flavors-chocolate chip, cookies n cream, oatmeal, chocolate, and white chocolate macadamia. For drinks, try a snake bite (guiness+pear cider), berry burst cider, or any of their own brews.  Their root beear and cream sodas are really tasty too.  You won't be disappointed.  Its a great place to have dinner with a group of friends. This place is in the strip mall across the street from Red Rock casino/hotel."
Jean Y.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,16,,4.0,2/7/2013,"Excellent food, extremely broad menu selection, fast service, limited parking, very reasonable prices. Accepts call ahead reservations."
Darroe G.,"Las Vegas, NV",4,20,,4.0,7/20/2008,"Great atmosphere, great service. There are many menu items to choose from.  Plus Pizookies are awesome! You get a free one for your birthday ;)"
T B.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,91,2,1.0,10/30/2012,"We go often and the last time it was really bad.  Pizza had no to very little sause and the crust was doughy.  They also changed the crust.  There are better places around.  Staff is nice, but not worth the risk of another bad meal. We will not be going back."
