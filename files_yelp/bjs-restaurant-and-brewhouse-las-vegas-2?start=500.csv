Michael H.,"Pittsburg, CA",42,271,7,3.0,1/22/2010,"Every time I have come here I always get the avocado appetizer and it fills me up so I have yet to try anything else. My wife usually orders a salad, but the beer is what we go here for. While we're not always in the mood for beer, there are only two places in all of Vegas I'd recommend, the first is Chicago's, but this is a close second. Ok, I guess a third would be Gordon Biersch, but whatever."
Liana L.,"Brooklyn, NY",283,321,26,3.0,2/9/2009,This place was OK. My boyfriend raved about it because he is a beer lovin' maniac but I did not have the same strong feelings about it. We went here for dinner one night but I'd say you'd be better off going here to watch some sports and have a good beer. I don't think I'd come back here if I had a choice in the matter.
Julie W.,"Las Vegas, NV",57,213,17,4.0,2/26/2012,"Food totally rocks!  We have eatten here, as well as, have done carry out.  It's almost always crowded on the weekend, but the wait is manageable.  The waitstaff is friendly and always able to give great recommendations!  Wonderful Fish Tacos!  Great portion size too...so you will not leave hungry."
aref H.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,2,,4.0,12/7/2010,The deep dish pizza.   good ambience.  excellent service. are all worth the visit.    we are never disappointed.
J C.,"Las Vegas, NV",67,223,12,4.0,9/27/2009,I went there for brunch on a sat.  It was pretty crowded but we were seated right away and service was good.  I had a hef which didn't come w/ a lemon wedge but it was lemony without it.  I also had their stout which was nitrogenated but still wasn't creamy like a cask Guiness.  I had the breakfast pizza and it came with home fries.  The food was pretty good not the best but reasonably priced.
Ryan G.,"Las Vegas, NV",163,64,7,4.0,7/20/2011,they make their own cream soda. now how can you not like a place that makes their own soda. every time i go here its a blast. the only food i have had is the pizzas and so far there is not one i dislike. i really like hanging out relaxing and watching the sports on the tvs with good friends here.
Robert M.,"Mableton, GA",6,5,,5.0,11/20/2011,I have gone here twice and each time excellent service and food. If you can put your diet on hold go and enjoy BJ's.
Tom J.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,53,,4.0,11/16/2009,I have eaten here several times.  Have enjoyed the white pizza.  I usually order it with extra garlic.  The pizza dough is fantastic.  I have tried the mozzeralla sticks and the avacado egg rolls.  Both were not that great.  And I agree with the other posters that the Pizookie should not be missed. My only quibbles are that the prices are a little high and it is way too crowded and noisy.
Valerie V.,"Las Vegas, NV",17,5,1,4.0,8/21/2011,"after hearing alot about this place & reading tons of reviews. we finally checked this place out. me, my hubby & our 3 month old went here for my birthday. they are kid/baby friendly(one of my worries because i thought since it had a bar that it wouldnt be smoke-free but it was) they provided a sling for our son's carseat which was very convinient not having to bring the stroller inside. i love the ambiance and feel of the place. we were given a table as soon as we got there. our server was soo awesome he was very warm and he really knows what he is talkin about especially when about the menu.(so we gave him a fat tip) they have a wide variety of food on the menu. so we got chips and salsa 5.95 more than enough. i also got the SEARED AHI very small portion 3.95. my hubby got the grilled  PORKCHOPS which was really good 14.95 and i got the JAMBALAYA! omg to die for!! for 15.95 worth it. soooo addicting! good sized portions which gave us leftovers. aaand since it was my birthday a complimentary PIZOOKIE :] soo bomb! they also have a wide variety of beer.. if you guys love beer. we do lol  so overall yes we would def keep comin back here.. all i can think about is the jambalaya as im writing this lol"
Hapi A.,"Las Vegas, NV",7,6,,4.0,6/6/2008,"Move over Pizza Hut! BJ's has you pinned for their pan pizza! If you like Pizza Hut and like their Pan Pizzas then you'll definitely love BJ's Favorite Pizza! Their pizza in my opinion tastes better! mmmmmm! It's a pan pizza with all the fixin's Oven-baked meatballs, pepperoni, Italian sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, black olives, white onions and fresh Roma tomatoes. This pizza is so yummy!  It's nice they have different sizes you can order...mini size, small, medium & large of coarse. This way it suites your hunger and how many will be eating it!  I like it cuz sometimes I just want a taste and I can order the mini! ... I also like their chicken wings too! Luv it! gotta try it!"
Sara S.,"Las Vegas, NV",58,76,7,4.0,5/11/2010,"Despite the fact that they are a national chain, BJs actually has really great pizza.  They have a large beer selection, including a sampler and different seasonal brews.  They have a large menu with the usual apps (wings, southwest eggrolls), pastas, burgers, salads, and pizza.  My husband and I come here for their deep dish pizza- the crust is buttery and cooked to perfection.  Their traditional cheese is delicious and topped with chunks of tomatoes, and they have great specialty pizzas like bbq chicken or spinach and artichoke.  Dessert here is also the bomb- deep dish baked to order cookies called pizookies, available in different flavors and topped with ice cream (my fav is the oreo)."
Amy P.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,16,,5.0,4/7/2011,Everything I've eaten here is delicious. Good service. Excellent pizza and pizookies. It's our go-to restaurant. Menu is ridiculously large.
kawehi m.,"Las Vegas, NV",4,9,2,5.0,9/23/2010,"Haven't been to BJ's in a while and we went last night for the Pary for Two special they have for Sept.  My first time for pizza, the BJ Combo was excellent, couldnt finish it.  I usually have Jeremiah Red but decided to try the Oktoberfest last night, Loved It!  And after the Pizookie, yummy i wanted to sleep.   I love the food, service and atmosphere at BJ's especially the BEER."
Nader A.,"Nome, AK",381,105,62,5.0,4/29/2007,"I only tried one of the beers, their porter. It was decent, but it did not really stand out. The salad I ordered on the other hand was very good. It had candied pecans and a variety of greens. The wait staff was also excellent. Attentive, but you hardly noticed they were there."
forty n.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,4,,5.0,1/26/2009,daryl was the best server i have ever had! he deserves a nice tip every visit
