Toni T.,"Las Vegas, NV",4,34,38,4.0,12/27/2016,"This maybe my favorite restaurant when it comes to chains. No matter what city I'm in, Bj's is consistent when it comes to quality in my experience. The Summerlin location is no different. We always have great service and drinks. I also love the fact that no matter what you're in the mood for, they're a something on the menu to satiate I love the kale and Brussels sprout salad. I always add shrimp and although they're not generous with the shrimp it's an adequate serving. The vegetables in the salad are always fresh. I also like the stuffed mushrooms as an appetizer. Bite sized full of flavor and yumminess."
Jillian W.,"Las Vegas, NV",302,8,9,2.0,10/28/2016,"Does anyone else agree that the best part of a wedge salad is the blue cheese crumbles? I came here for take out just for two wedge salads and they both came with a pinch of blue cheese, so little I could barely taste it. I think my picture does justice. The take out service was alright and I tipped the lady that helped me but this wedge of lettuce and a sprinkle of tomato, onion and bacon is not worth $5+"
Nicholas S.,"North Las Vegas, NV",25,77,111,3.0,1/21/2017,"Stopped in and got the two for special. We got two drinks, then ordered the ultimate pepperoni pizza with peppers, and the cookie dessert.  All while getting to watch some sports at the bar.  Although this place is just becoming as normal as a Chilli's or Applebee's the upside is there is no hipsters hanging out here."
Steve V.,"Las Vegas, NV",126,64,27,2.0,7/17/2016,"The staff Is friendly and the beers are good, but today is not their day for food. We have tried the ""new"" deep fried portobello mushrooms, which looked amazing. Unfortunately they taste like grease.  Then we moved on to the Honey Sriracha Brussels Sprouts...(picture enclosed)...they were burnt, bitter and unappetizing. Very disappointed. Now to the Nacho Flat Bread...looks good, but the crust is burnt.  Whoever is the chef today (July 17th 2016) needs to be fired...or think of a new profession. It is taking everything I have  not to personally walk this back to the kitchen."
Melissa C.,"Summerlin, Las Vegas, NV",244,581,1664,4.0,8/5/2015,"Pizza has always been a specialty here and I've tried a few of the personal size.  The beer is pretty good too. I wasn't sure this place would be good for a date but it was rather fun. We were seated close to the bar which worked out well. It's rather a family heavy crowd in general. The ginormous menu is Cheesecake Factory size, which I find annoying.  I had the Italian spicy thin crust pizza and that was very tasty. I love a spicy pie! The 4 beer sampler I had was good too. My dining partner had a happy hour beer and wasn't offered another before happy hour ends, which a good server should always do! He did get another at happy hour price after asking, so crisis averted!"
Bethany M.,"Henderson, NV",6,8,,4.0,7/30/2017,"We always get seated right away whenever we come to this place. The service here has always been fast and friendly. My only complaint is that the menu is so overwhelming!!! There's always so much to choose from and it's hard to make a decision. Regardless, we always save room for their pizookie."
Naomi N.,"Las Vegas, NV",543,244,1691,3.0,6/14/2015,"SCRUMPTIOUS THICK PIZZAS! I absolutely love BJ's so after a doctors visit we had were hungry & unanimously chose this spot since it was also on the way home. We ordered take out & decided on 2 LARGE pizzas... when we arrived to pick up we noticed on the board that there was a family style package meal that includes 2 Large pizzas, salad, wings, & 2 sides for around $5 more than what we were already paying for the 2 pizzas we ordered & when we tried to mention it to Brianna when paying out she was just super rude about it & also had no idea about this special. "" o... I guess you can...."" in a rude tone of manner i would have to say as we pointed out what their special entails. We also had to witness her being a bit toney w/ another person that was trying to apply to the place... =/  that's my reason for the 3 star...  The food was great though even if it was take-out... by the time we got home it was still hot & delicious. But one thing that really SUCKED was that we had asked for extra ranch on the side for the pizza & when we got home, all we see is the one ranch that came w/ the wings =[ MASHED POTATO - very smooth & rich creamy flavor... I love it when such a simple dish is made perfect.  FRIES - crisp skinny fries Can't complain they're fries. BUFFALO WINGS - the sauce was on the side & it came w/ a good amount of celery sticks. 2 LARGE BUFFALO CKN PIZZA - although I usually go w/ the GREAT WHITE, the Buffalo chicken pizza here is delicious... not too overwhelming & perfect texture to the crust as ALWAYS & the right amount of protein & veggie ratio for each bite!  SANTA FE CHICKEN SALAD - refreshing salad w/ some crisp to it w/ the tortilla strips & the Santa Fe dressing was awesome. Hope to be back to try the dine in experience since I usually go to the one on eastern. Hopefully it will be a bit more friendly when dining there."
Michelle R.,"Las Vegas, NV",4,39,20,1.0,7/16/2017,"Front host was great super friendly. Didn't wait for a table at all. Quick to sit us. (Party of 6) The sever we had was such a nice lady. However the quality of the food was terrible. First we ask for cokes and they kept giving us diet ones for some reason. We order poke bowl - don't get it, it never gets brought out but of course it's on the bill. Then my sister and I order the Nashville spicy chicken sandwich and mine is great, but they brought out the classic chicken sandwich instead for my sister. Instead of making her the correct sandwich they brought out some microwaved hot sauce to put on it. My nephew never got his side of fries (yet again it was on the bill.) finally the booth and the wall behind us was so gross and dirty. Didn't look like it was wiped at all for maybe days?! A spider bit my fiancé. I can't believe this happened to us especially while in summerlin! We spoke to Allen he was very nice and actually cared what was going on. Then the GM Paul came over and blamed all the errors on the waitress. And that wasn't the case. She took our order correctly and the people in the kitchen and servers where the ones messing things up. Along with the bus boys who clearly don't clean properly. He was so unprofessional and quick to place blame and had the nerve to say that we were ""complaining"" I let him know that customer service is his job and placing blame on someone won't solve the issue of the food being poorly prepared and the kitchen not making the food in the back. I let him know it's a difference between complaining vs facts. Facts was, the food wasn't good, the place was dirty and we didn't get our complete orders, yet was charged for them. Paul, as a GM please work on ownership and customer service skills. We will not be back. EVER. #bye!"
Nicole F.,"Las Vegas, NV",117,341,1446,5.0,11/11/2016,"BJ's was treating Veterans Day right, received any meal for free plus our waiter gave us free dessert. Service was great, food was great even being crowded on a Friday night we got seated within ten minutes. Definitely be back !"
Diane B.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,12,1,4.0,9/9/2017,"My husband an I go to BJ's in several places both in California and Las Vegas. The food is very good but my comment is on the service. The server we request is Keshia very nice to my grandsons, very considerate. She is one of our reasons for going all the way to this BJ''s rather than a closer restaurant or eating in our hotel. Also I didn't get her name but the manager was very accommodating when we made a request! I could definitely tell customer service is a priority at this restaurant.  A lot of places have good food but really good service will make you drive a little farther or wait a little longer, a well placed smile and welcoming service keep you coming back. Keisha makes this a welcoming place for us."
Kimberly H.,"Las Vegas, NV",80,37,14,5.0,6/12/2017,"Excellent food & service every time I go. Went in on a busy Saturday (party if 3), during several graduation big parties. We still received excellent service & great quality of food. I will definitely continue to dine here!!!!"
Maria B.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,20,3,5.0,10/13/2017,Just stopped by for a date night with my husband and this was the best part of the night. Our server Lynn in the bar section was so AMAZING!!  She is just so bubbly and friendly. She is the epitome of customer service. She makes you feel like you are the only person around. This place is now our new favorite spot.  The happy hour is great as well. $4 for a pint of beer and $6 for a burger and fried. Plus the pizzookie is only $3 this month. My whole meal with dessert is under $15.    We will be back soon.
Ryann C.,"Las Vegas, NV",209,3,,5.0,12/28/2016,"I love BJs! Alan & Tracey are the best bartenders west of the strip! Friendly, attentive, fun, speedy, just a pleasure all around to come in and see them when I get off work, want a drink, some good food and great service! The wait staff and managers are alsi always so friendly and welcoming! Tonite I had the Black n Blue burger (always good and one of my favorites) my normal Ketal &  Tonic with 2 limes and my favorite, a lemon drop shot....Tracey makes the best! Thank you BJs for always making my experience through the moon!!!"
Marie R.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,30,3,5.0,2/4/2017,Came in first time customer and Nicole N was my server and she was a. Deaths of fresh air super kind to my kids which is a breath of fresh air because they were super busy and she was so pleasant.  I will always ask for her and the food was amazing!
Edith S.,"Las Vegas, NV",137,132,331,4.0,3/19/2016,"It's been a few years since I've been to a BJs since there's just so many places for a late dinner in Las Vegas. First, Krystle, our server, was fantastic. She knew her stuff.  As my husband was choosing his ""Pick 4"" beers (@$6.95 great deal), she could tell what kind of beers he liked and gave him some suggestions. He ended up changing two to try something new. And he was happy he did. Because it has been a while since we've been to BJ's, asked our server what she would recommend as I wanted more of a dip. We went with her suggestion of the Pork chili verde Queso dip, and we were happy we did. Dinner was good. My husband with with a rack of ribs, while I went with the shrimp and asparagus penne. However, because I'm more of a noodle person, our server was okay with me changing penne to spaghetti noodle. And of course, we had dessert. Pizookie! With the amount of options, she suggested that we do a half-and-half. I choose the white chocolate macadamia nut while my husband choose Peanut Butter. Next time, we'll try not to fill up so much and go with the Pizookie Trio instead. And lastly, be sure you get that ""$10 off $35"" deal. It ends on 4/6/2016."
Ginni K.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,41,15,4.0,7/9/2017,Spinach filled mushrooms - super YUM. Also had the cherry chipotle glazed salmon which was delicious. Loved the sweet and spicy flavor.
Robert W.,"Henderson, NV",228,467,380,4.0,2/21/2016,"I've eaten here many times over the years. Today I stopped in with a friend for a post hike beer and breakfast.  A bit slow to start as it seems like our server was just coming on duty. No other server could be bothered to get even a water or drop off a menu. I give those servers a one star rating. Our server was nice, and prompt and gets 4 stars. I've usually gotten decent service over the years...so this was just weird.  Food, as always, is good. Eggs, french toast, applewood bacon....all good. I really like the crunchy chicken salad with honey mustard dressing here as well. Mini pan pizzas are also delish! Never an issue with food quality here. The menu is extensive, and they have a nice selection of beers. Their Hefeweizen is nice. Everything from Pale Ales to dark. They also have on tap the usual favorites Blue Moon, Stella, etc. etc.  I've always liked coming here, plenty of tv screens for sports. There is an offer on Yelp for BOGO. Try it out and see if you enjoy it."
Ashley M.,"Las Vegas, NV",112,1,,5.0,4/15/2017,I visited BJ's last night and was SO impressed! The employees spoiled my one-year-old son with a plate of fruit and friendly service. And even just thinking about the pizza makes my mouth water. Thank you BJ's!
Troy B.,"Las Vegas, NV",4,34,2,1.0,11/18/2016,"When you get seated prompltly at 4:45 with a less than half dining area And wait more than 10 minutes without staff even asking for a drink Order, one asks why give BJ's your business!  And to think We come enough to be rewards members.  Bye Bye BJ's"
Kristine M.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,48,16,5.0,2/7/2017,Love BJ's!  We really like the happy hour - tonight we had boneless wings & flatbread pizza. Great combo!  Our server Alan was fabulous!  Very attentive & but not bothersome!  Pazookis are the best!  Traditional chocolate chip cookie-can't go wrong!  Sweet warm goodness!
