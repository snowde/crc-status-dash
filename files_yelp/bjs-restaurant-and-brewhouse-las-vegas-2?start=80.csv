Lynette C.,"Las Vegas, NV",35,162,285,5.0,2/24/2016,"we opted to come Saturday late afternoon.  It wasn't very crowded....YAY for beating the crowd. We sat at a booth at the bar.  I couldn't decide between baby back ribs or pizza.  I can get pizza anywhere right?!?!  BRING ON THE RIBS!  OMG...super tender, just the right amount of sauce and the French Fries were uber hot and crispy and thin.  Just the way I like them. E of course got the jambalaya.  Didn't he get this before lol.  Yep just checked previous review....a creature of habit he is :) I am so bad at getting the names of the wait staff to include them in my reviews but yep....once again I didn't get it.  Shout Out to the gentleman who waited on us in the big booth on Saturday late afternoon in the bar area :)  He was nice, fast and not annoying checking in on us every 30 seconds yet not taking forever and a decade to come back and check in on us.   Awesome evening yet again at BJ's! idiotic self forgot to use my rewards card....oopsie!  Next time right?!?!"
Steve F.,"Las Vegas, NV",73,4,,5.0,1/14/2017,Food was pretty good. Salad dressing bland. Problem was service. Finally got ketchup as I was done with meal. Definitely need better training for wait staff.
Jay M.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,8,5,1.0,9/30/2016,"Decided to try Bjs out again. Big mistake. Got home and my turkey burger had no toppings on it but onion. It comes with a lettuce mix and cranberries also. That was missing. Once again, bjs can't get their to-go orders together. I will definitely not come back ever again. Such a hassle and disappointment!!"
James H.,"Las Vegas, NV",256,110,123,3.0,5/23/2015,"We've been eating at BJ's on West Charleston since we moved here.  With a large assortment of menu choices, a kid's menu, and a nice beer selection (including BJ's own delicious assortment of brews), there's something here for everyone.   If you've never been before, or you get lost in the large menu, I'd recommend the Crispy Fried Artichokes (artichoke hearts) or the Avocado Egg Rolls for a starter.  Moving on to main course choices, try the Bacon Cheese Burger, New Orlean's Jambalaya, or one of the Tavern Cut Pizzas.  The Spicy Pig or Garlic Chicken Pesto are both favorites.  If you're in the mood for salad as a main course, definitely check out the Kale & Roasted Brussel Sprouts Salad.  There is also a good assortment of dessert options for anyone who is still hungry after the meal.  Finally, there's a gluten-free menu for those who want or need to adhere to a gluten-free diet. In the larger restaurants in the chain, the noise level is slightly above average, and has even been noisy at times, but it's never been too loud. As I mentioned, BJ's brews it's own beer; you have 10 beers and a hard cider available to chose from.  They also carry a nice assortment of others beers as well, so you're not bound to their own brews.  By the way, the in-house root beer is delicious.  Be sure to give it a try during one of your visits. Finally, the West Charleston location is conveniently located near Red Rock Casino and Downtown Summerlin, so consider adding this BJ's to your dining choices if you're out and about in the area.  They're consistently good and worth a visit.  Enjoy!"
Jayson C.,"Las Vegas, NV",95,36,10,2.0,4/28/2017,"Great food horrible customer service, but if good food matters most to you that's all that matters.  Meanwhile if you have kids or a family it might be rough.  Being in Summerlin they like to take care of the Summerlin people and could care less about the regular people.  If you're single and hot you'll get a table quick if you're a family or fat good luck!"
Jon F.,"Las Vegas, NV",52,25,22,2.0,9/16/2016,"I'll have to drop this place to 2 stars. Unfortunately, the service wasn't as great. Numerous mistakes were made. I mean the food hits the spot no doubt. However, sitting your customers in a table where it hasn't been PROPERLY cleaned is another thing. We've asked numerous employees for assistance, but our request was passed on from one to another.  Another issue was upon food delivery, there was no utensils? How are we suppose to eat? Hmm.. also, food order was wrong. Now, I understand that it gets very hectic and all on some occasions. But this is no way to cater paying customers.  Everything was slow, barely any water refills? But when it came to giving out the bill it was hella quick? Cmon now..  Improvements have to be made. Thank you."
Diego T.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,8,,1.0,5/13/2017,Quoted a 1 hour wait. Took almost 2. We were just a party of 6. Saw 50+ people leave. How hard is it to push 2 four person tables to accommodate a party of 6. They did offer to get an appetizer started for us. Thanks.
G S.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,7,,1.0,9/28/2017,"No no no-   Always good service and food......till now! After waiting 15 minutes to be offered a beer- it is a brew house- yes?? Waiter slides us 2 menus and says- ""I'll be back.....no,no, no I said and he looked right at me and gone! When he came back I said that I never wait more than 10 minutes to be offered a cold beer and that it had been more than 20- asked if it would be another 15-20 before beers came - his response- probably! Huh!? You said probably? Yes I did. Requested manager and reported that and she apologized- said she would take our drink orders and handle it-----oh but not to be- another 15 min. wait........Cmon folks.....someone has $millions$ wrapped up in this operation- don't p--s it away!!!"
Jessica U.,"Las Vegas, NV",111,7,3,3.0,11/19/2016,"Went to dinner last night with my boyfriend and we both agreed this location has definitely gone downhill in the last couple of years. We both have eaten at this location numerous times before and have been pleased with the food in the past but something has changed. My only big complaint is the food. I ordered an ahi tuna salad which came out with NO salad dressing... like how does a salad come out with no dressing?! Also when my boyfriends food arrived the man who gave it to him spilled his ranch all over his plate and said ""your ranch spilled on the plate"", didn't ask to help or to get another ranch. We both thought it was pretty rude. Ok service but sucky food!!!"
Doug K.,"Incline Village, NV",0,2,,1.0,6/6/2017,"Waiter dressed like a plumber should have been our first clue - butt crack and all. He was incompetent despite having a tablet that was doing the work - he couldn't find the drinks or the menu. What a surprise - service was even worse. ""I'm swamped. I've got six tables.""  They were all doubles, within arm's reach. We left w/o receiving several items."
Karina H.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,5,3,5.0,5/29/2017,I had the super salad with grilled chicken and my bf had the lemon thyme chicken (he shared lol) and it was bomb!! The chicken wasn't dry and you can tell they we're prepared well and wasn't frozen. The salad was fresh and the dressing wasn't overwhelming. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the strawberry lemonade- it was too sweet. Oh! And the server was very nice and checked up on us :)
Jackie H.,"Las Vegas, NV",28,24,83,5.0,3/28/2017,I came after watching a movie at downtown summerlin and they were so kind and our waitress let us try beer to see if we like it. Service and food is fantastic. Thank you so much
Traci T.,"Las Vegas, NV",267,153,123,4.0,11/20/2015,"Yep, I am a fan. Yep, it is a chain. It's a chain done right and I give credit where credit is due. I enjoy a good beer, and whether it's a BJ's house brew or a guest tap, I always find something hoppy and malty to drink. I usually patronize the bar area, which is my go-to at most establishments, and this one is non-smoking so it's always a good choice. Servers and bartenders are always great and if you can make it to a beer dinner I highly recommend it. Besides beer, I generally order stuffed mushrooms, potato wedges (not fries), salad (they have several that I like) or pizza. On a rare occasion I have a pizzookie. It's an awesome dessert, I just don't do sweet very often.  The mushrooms are probably my favorite menu item. I think they are stuffed with the spinach and artichoke dip, among other things, and I cannot get enough of them. The pizza is great. It's pan pizza, like pizza hut style only really good. Not to be confused with deep dish, it's just a nice thick buttery crust and just slightly doughy. Health food it is not."
Evelyn V.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,13,6,5.0,4/2/2017,Our waiter James was awesome !!!! Very good!! And he recommend the best beer ever for me !!! BERRY BURST.
Rovin C.,"Southwest, Las Vegas, NV",6,9,1,1.0,6/12/2016,"I love BJ's, but I just had a terrible experience here and I hate to bring up race.  I asked to watch the soccer game and it took 10 minutes to switch the Channel. After they switched the channel, a couple of folks, that happen to be white, that barely arrived, complained about the soccer game and wanted to see baseball. The staff immediately changed the channel to the baseball.  Honestly this is beneath me and BJ's, it's the the fact that it happen. The server should have kindly told the couple that there was a request before them, and should have given them alternative accommodations."
Adam W.,"Las Vegas, NV",12,69,1,3.0,8/2/2016,"Service was good, and lots of people in my group enjoyed my meal.  However, I got the chicken and bacon ""Mac & Cheese"" but was disappointed because it was really just pasta with cheese sauce.  If I had known that, I'd have tried something better."
Elisse V.,"Chinatown, Las Vegas, NV",1,4,24,4.0,9/10/2016,Waitress is great... The dry rub siracha wings are my favorite here besides the pazookies
Bryson H.,"Las Vegas, NV",82,184,3,4.0,12/2/2015,"The portions here are surprisingly large. For a chain restaurant, the food quality is quite good. A very, very easy 4-star review. Have no fear about ordering here, you may not be totally wowed by your experience but you'll definitely not be disappointed.  My wife and I both ended up ordering the same thing: Santa Fe Salad. She got chicken, I got chicken and in addition the salmon (typically it's a substitution, I ordered double meat). I ordered mine without bell peppers as well. A bad restaurant would reply to removing bell peppers with ""Sorry the salad is pre-made we can't do subtractions."" BJ's just said ""okay"". That's a great first sight. As appetizers we had Chicken Potstickers and Potato Skins.  Let me just review all the food at once: for the price, I got larger portions than expected; the flavor was great, the food was cooked well, the variety of ingredients in the dishes was as-expected for potato skins, and was a pleasant surprise for the salads. I'm not sure why I don't give this a 5-star review. 4 seems like the right answer. While everything was good -- really good, just what I was looking for and up to my standards -- it is still a chain restaurant, and nothing really *pops* about it in a unique or outstanding way.  BJ's is definitely one of my go-to restaurants for classic, totally solid American-style food (even though I ordered a mexican-inspired entree salad and an asian-inspired appetizer)."
Karen L.,"Las Vegas, NV",40,88,22,3.0,1/20/2017,"I only gave it 3 stars because the fish and chips had an awful coating. 3 of us ordered the fish and chips. Over salted, too heavy and gummy coating. Everything else was great. Nice server. Good beer. This place usually doesn't disappoint."
Jessica S.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,1,2,5.0,4/4/2017,"Buffalo chicken grilled cheese is so good, bf had the bacon burger and BLT salad, started with artichoke dip EVERYTHING IS AWESOME"
