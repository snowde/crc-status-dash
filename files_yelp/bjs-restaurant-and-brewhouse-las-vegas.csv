Rhiannon H.,"Garden Grove, CA",43,106,95,4.0,12/29/2017,"Came for Friday brunch right as they opened,  Empty at first & filled up quickly. But not loud or annoying.  Service was fast! Server was kind,  They have a nice lunch menu. Good food, great seasoning. Good portions. I ordered a mojito & this place knew what they were doing! Not a lot of places can make a decent one.  I'd definitely go back"
Dennis T.,"North Las Vegas, NV",581,846,10004,3.0,11/27/2017,"We returned here for dinner with friends after a long absence.  A bowl of New England Clam Chowder was good but rather floury.  And Diane never received the Oyster Crackers she asked for to stir in her chowder. Chicken Lettuce Wraps with fresh leaves of lettuce, an Asian sauce, and marinated chunks of chicken mixed with pieces of celery and water chestnuts were excellent as always.  My Seared Ahi Salad was also fresh and plentiful.  I would order this dish again.  But it took a long while for me to receive the Soy Sauce I had specially requested. So, other than a couple of nettlesome service errors, this was an enjoyable dining experience. XXX-1/2 stars overall!"
Mike C.,"North Las Vegas, NV",22,25,15,5.0,11/9/2017,This by far our most favorite place to go in North Las Vegas... The food is wonderful and the staff is exceptional.  The lunches are terrific and the Jeremiah Red is the best beer ever.  Go there!!!
Komatsu O.,"Las Vegas, NV",143,52,66,4.0,10/23/2017,I really want to give them a five star! But I want to come back some more to see consistency. We sat at the bar right away.  The appetizers took awhile to come but they were worth it! The spinach dip looked soupy but I was surprised! It was really good! I had the bison burger and my wife had the poke salad. Come from Hawaii the poke was made fr ah and it was oishi (delicious)! The bison burger was so juicy! The sweet potato fries were so good we had to order extra. The fish and chips were golden brown and crunchy. I was very well pleased. Their menu is huge but they don't sacrifice quality!
Sandra M.,"Coupeville, WA",0,1,,5.0,1/10/2018,"My family held our mother's 90th birthday at this BJ's on Dec 23, 2017.  They have an area in the back part of the restaurant for large groups.  From the time I made the reservation through the party, we had a wonderful experience.  We had designated servers who were friendly, helpful and more than willing to do whatever it took to accommodate us, including space for a birthday cake and guest signing.  I would like to sincerely thank everyone for a most enjoyable experience.  We would definitely use this venue again.

S B.,"Vallejo, CA",103,144,41,3.0,12/13/2017,"It was ok enjoyed the root beer ribs , calamari and jambalaya... I've been eating here for years and starting to notice portions getting ridiculously smaller especially when it comes to the calamari which is something I enjoyed here . Time to find a new fav"
Jeff R.,"Natomas, Sacramento, CA",47,134,59,4.0,12/28/2017,"Great craft beer selection, great appetizer options, great happy hour, great menu selection with many options from burgers to pizza and a lot of other options.  It's a chain restaurant so you get what you get but you can certainly do a lot worse than BJ's in the franchise restaurant department.  Recommend the avocado egg rolls, queso & chips, or boneless wings for appetizers.  All the burgers are fantastic and the pizza is excellent!  Jeremiah Red is one of the best beers they have and Hopstorm IPA is exceptional!"
Gracy A.,"North Las Vegas, NV",34,31,47,3.0,10/5/2017,"BJ'S has been our go to neighborhood restaurant since its nearby. The food is good but I've noticed each time we go there's always a difference with taste, quality, or presentation. It'd be great if these cooks maintain their menu the same way its prepared. My husband and I like to order the garlic parm wings and some visits it'll be perfect and crispy. Other times it'll be soggy with no sauce or seasoning?! We enjoy the great white and bjs favorite deep dish pizza.  Great white is an alfredo sauce base pizza with chicken breast, cheese, tomatoes, roasted garlic, and mushrooms... soooo yummy!  Bjs favorite is pretty classic. Red sauce, meatballs, pepperoni, italian sausage, mushrooms, green bell peppers, olives,  onions, and tomatoes.  You can order their pizza by halves so you can try 2 flavors or what have ya!  Three star rating because their service ain't consistent. We would order ahead and put ourselves on a waitlist. Upon arrival, we are still waiting at the lobby.. what's the point of the app sometimes. Well the app is good to download so you can earn points and get discount rewards in the future. Also, an option to order for curbside/takeout if dining in is not an option for you. Pazookies are their popular dessert. It's a Warm baked cookie topped with vanilla ice cream. They got various cookies to choose. (Chocolate chip, oreo, peanut butter, etc)"
Pamela H.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,45,8,5.0,9/27/2017,"We haven't really been back as much since Angel (the bartender) left, but wow! James was so incredible! I thought the service couldn't get any better but seriously? We will go back to coming back here on a regular basis! I highly recommend sitting at the bar and order through James. His upbeat attitude and recommendations were ON POINT! Amazing service!"
Naldo I.,"Las Vegas, NV",6,6,16,5.0,12/31/2017,"Came in for an early New Year's Eve dinner with my family. My wife ordered her favorite Seared ahi salad and the tuna was seared perfect. Our server, Francisco was awesome. Always made sure we were ok. Awesome place for a quick bite and for some drinks,"
Huy T.,"Las Vegas, NV",232,65,185,1.0,12/10/2017,"I want to start by saving I love the fact that there is a BJ's restaurant in the centennial area. This place is usually crowded because of the limited restaurant options this side of town. BJ's is a traditional American style restaurant/pizzeria/Brewhouse and I've been coming to this chain for over 10 years (I've even been to this location a few times). I love the blonde beer and coming here for happy hour (half off mini pizzas). Came here with my brother for dinner and I have to say, we got 1 star service. First, our server BARELY gave us the time of day. She was already walking away while I was trying to ask for barbecue sauce on the side (she forgot the barbecue sauce btw). I ordered a mini barbecue chicken and side of fries and it took 30 minutes for it to come out! (I took a picture of my timer, the timer says 20 minutes but I started the timer after waiting roughly 10 minutes already). The server NEVER refilled our waters either. It was just frustrating watching the server give a lot of attention to all the tables around us, but would barely glance at my tables direction. If the restaurant was packed and super busy, I could understand the neglect, but the restaurant wasn't even busy(I took pictures to show all the empty seats around me). I wanted to order a pizookie (they are delicious) to end my night but was turned off my the service I was receiving so much that I skipped dessert. I love BJ's restaurant but every time I've been to this location I had a poor experience. I think this was my last time here"
Jefferson L.,"Las Vegas, NV",7,70,114,4.0,8/13/2017,"So the family and I enjoy the occasional visit to BJ's and it is a solid choice if you just want a place with a diverse menu and not as swanky as Cheesecake Factory.  Every visit is pretty consistent so the only thing that changes is the level of service.  Our server, was very busy and overall was not bad.  Had the potato skins to start, a blue cheese wedge, pasta with shrimp and asparagus, and the prime rib.  No complaints about the food.  Everything came out hot and fresh and was pretty tasty.  Only complaints were that it took a while, we had no plates and silverware by the time the appetizer showed up, and the menus were a little sticky with crumbs in them.  I understand it's not tablecloth dining, but service is what sets you apart in today's business world.  Last but not least, the Salted Caramel Pizookie is worth an afternoon visit if you've got the occasional sweet tooth!"
Addy L.,"Las Vegas, NV",134,118,80,2.0,7/2/2017,"I'm really not a fan of this place or their food.  However, my husband loves BJ's and it is right down the street. We come here a couple times a month.  I've tried a bunch of things on their menu, trying to find something I like. Appetizer-wise I've had their: sliders, fried asparagus, calamari, and fried artichokes.  The artichokes are my favorite out of these. I've also tried a variety of other things: burger, pizza, grilled cheese, soups, salads, chicken flatbread, etc.  The grilled cheese is terrible.  Not sure how you mess up a grilled cheese?  The bread was so hard I could feel it cutting my throat.  The burgers are bland.  I've had a soggy pizza here twice.   You can't go wrong with a soup in a bread bowl or a salad.  Also, you have to get the Pizookie.  Sometimes that's all I order.  The original chocolate chip Pizookie is the best.  They're $3 on Tuesdays! The last time we came here was actually for brunch (first time- meeting some friends).  Brunch was terrible.  I had their eggs and bacon breakfast.  We were a party of 4, and half of our order was missing.  Pancakes, toast, potatoes, etc.  Something was missing from each person's order. Not impressed.  If it weren't for my husband loving this place, I would not return."
Jamie P.,"Las Vegas, NV",102,430,758,3.0,1/4/2017,"BJ's is an overpriced chain restaurant. It's not bad, but it's not great. They have a vast selection of craft beers as well as a plethora of cocktails. They have a huge menu with about 20 different pages which makes deciding what to order difficult. It took me and my 5 other family members at least 20 minutes to look through the menu and figure out what to eat. We decided to order the chips and sriracha queso while we perused the menu. The app came out quickly, but the dip was lukewarm and the chips had no flavor. Surprisingly the dip was tasty, I just wish it were hotter. For my lunch I ordered the bacon cheeseburger. It was nothing to write home about. My mom ordered a small great white pizza which I tasted and it was sooo dry. It was the dryest pizza I had ever tasted and it was almost $17 for a small! The prices are way too steep for just mediocre food. I don't think I will ever dine at BJ's again."
Susan S.,"Las Vegas, NV",141,51,4,5.0,12/20/2017,"We had a great experience on Sunday.  We ordered the chips & guac, Brussel sprouts ( my personal favorite ) and the club sandwich.  All items were delicious.  Our server was awesome - checked up on us many times. Next time we'll order our favorite pizza."
Steve F.,"Las Vegas, NV",3,67,10,5.0,8/8/2017,"What's not to like?!  BJ's to me is like Friday's or Applebee's with personally, better food, and way more beer selection. Love this place! I'm not reviewing any specific time, just thought I should let the world know that this place is awesome.  Always a great choice for dinner"
Kayy C.,"Santa Clara, CA",115,9,6,5.0,11/12/2017,Kym At the bar was super nice. Best service and really knowledgeable ! Great place for Sunday football. Recommend the jerryburst or the jerimah red beer . Good vibes
Cheyanne F.,"Las Vegas, NV",42,30,32,5.0,12/17/2017,"The food was so good. I spent 79$ for seven dishes. Even the Peach Sunset Tea was refreshing and delicious, I normally can't drink things without sugar but the quality of this tea was top of the line."
Michelle C.,"North Las Vegas, NV",0,22,14,5.0,12/10/2017,Miriam was great. My service was so great. My boys loved the food. Just the right amount of noise that i didnt feel guilty when the little one got riled up!! A go to spot. Thanks again Miriam!
Allison B.,"North Las Vegas, NV",569,244,1446,5.0,10/28/2016,"I have to come back and give more details  and to put a full review but I will say I had a stellar visit here .. Corena(Korena) not Katrina as formally messed up ugh  was our server who was super friendly and made sure we left happy , full and wanting more .. I definitely recommend downloading the app and getting on the wait list first and ask for Katrina .. food is always yummy and the drinks are delicious at every bjs but the service has not ever been this good!"
Angelynn J.,"Lakeland, FL",94,161,343,2.0,6/22/2017,"The service wasn't that good, and there were crumbs still on the table. We asked to be seated some where else and they said no so we dealt with it but I would never go to this location again. The only thing I liked about this place was the dessert, I had the white chocolate macadamia nut cookie and  vanilla ice cream, it was good."
Salvatore M.,"Las Vegas, NV",79,3,,5.0,12/20/2017,"My wife and I enjoyed our dinner. The restaurant was very busy, but we were seated right away. Our server Kym was absolutely great. Hands down some of the best service in town and I have been a local for 22 years. If you are in the Northwest sode of town stop in. You will not be disappointed. The menu has a lot of different options."
Brad K.,"North Las Vegas, NV",9,3,,5.0,11/29/2017,"To Denise T- You're seriously complaining about oyster crackers and soy sauce .... seriously ? Those types of things are easily forgotten, especially if it's busy. You much be one of the ppl that complains about not getting a lemon in your water , so you deduct a star lmao.  Stay home if you're gonna complain about stuff that isn't a huge deal."
Annie H.,"Las Vegas, NV",391,90,445,5.0,3/6/2017,"5 stars all because of our server JAMES! James was excellent. James made recommendations, very professional, had a great sense of humor, constantly checks to see how we are doing, refills our water, there was never once a need for us to ask for anything, James was always attentive. I have got to say, James provided the BEST service I have ever received!  This BJs is not close to where I live but my friend and I just happened to stop by since she had a gift card and while doing errands this was the closest BJs. I would come back because of James amazing service. We ordered the avocado egg rolls. Yummmmo! Jam packed with flavor. Defiantly must order again. I ordered the seared ahi tuna salad, which was very refreshing. Would defiantly recommend trying this salad dish. Overall, had to review this restaurant and give a big THANKS to James for being amazing!"
Chuck T.,"North Las Vegas, NV",0,27,47,3.0,10/9/2017,"Having a gift card was the perfect reason to try out BJ's. After a short wait to be seated, we were in the hands of the attentive staff. The menu was very extensive,  and that might be a problem. I ordered fish and chips. Simple enough, but the fish was very bland tasting. Probably not returning."
Lisa M.,"Las Vegas, NV",52,150,238,5.0,5/1/2017,Love this place. Great food always. Very clean. Seats allot of people. Our waiter James (Bar seating) knew his menu and what the future menu would have on it. He works very fast but talks as he's moving. Very funny personality. I will definitely ask to be seated in his section next time! Don't let the crowded parking lot and long  waitlist turn you away. Hostesses get thru the waitlist quicker than any other restaurant I've been to.
Run R.,"Centennial, Las Vegas, NV",0,17,31,2.0,9/10/2017,I had a bison burger sauce was really runny like the added Lotta water to it to stretch it very sticky. My wife had the pulled pork the pork tastes like it was going bad It had a Texter like Jell-O almost made me puke. I told the waitress the manager came out with all kind of attitude he told me when they get it it has a lot of fat. he told me how they cooked it I guess I just ate fat the waitress was the bomb so nice. Would I go there again never ever there was nobody in the restaurant now I know why need to get rid of the manager put somebody who cares about the food.
Daniel S.,"Henderson, NV",988,1138,6855,3.0,7/25/2016,"3.5 STARS : Very Good    The second best part about hiking is what happens after the hike. That is the tradition of the post-hike supper. A few weeks ago after my brother and I hiked on the Cathedral Rock Trail, this very B.J's served our post-hike supper.    Dining out in B.J's made sense. Earlier this year following Norm K's Hike at the Potato Knolls, my Yelp friend Rob. W and myself went to their Summerlin location for a post-hike lunch. As my review implied, I enjoyed their jalapeño burger and the experience. Now I was returning to their second of three Las Vegas locations.     When my brother and I pulled into the parking lot, we saw that it was nearly filled up with cars. We walked into the restaurant expecting a wait. That wasn't the case because this large restaurant /brew pub accommodates a lot of people. When we walked in the woman at the podium pointed toward the back of the restaurant where we sat ourselves at a booth. Walking toward the booth in this urban style restaurant, we walked alongside the bar to the right and a room of tables to the left. What is unique is that there were zero signs of gaming. On the other hand there were signs of drinking. At the back wall I saw their microbrewery barrels. It is my understanding that B.J's is the recipient of many awards for their beer. Anyhow, we were here for the grub.     A few minutes after sitting down, our waitress introduced herself and soon returned with my glass of Coke. If you are a cola fan like myself they also serve black cherry cola and other unique flavors. At this point in the review, I will summarize the service as being good for a busy restaurant.    Just like the time I visited the B.J's in Summerlin, it was a slight challenge deciding what to eat. Then I laid eyes on their brand new Triple Decker ($11.25).    B.J's picked a winner with the Triple Decker. I was impressed. The sandwich bread was a hoagie. Within the hoagie were sliced roast beef, turkey, ham, and Swiss cheese. Complimenting the cold cuts were lettuce, mayonnaise, tomatoes, Italian dressing, and mustard. Finally, on top of the hoagie were a couple of sliced pickles. The pictures below this review supports the fact that the Triple Decker was loaded with cold cuts.    In reality, this is really a Quadruple Decker. I say this because B.J's gives customers the choice of regular fries or potato wedges. I am a fan of potato wedges. The Potato wedges adjacent to the Triple decker tasted very good. Kudos to B.J's for offering the choice of potato wedges or fries.    In conclusion, B.J's was a very good choice after hiking on the Cathedral Rock Trail. I give it my 3.5 STARS stamp of approval."
Zhen Z.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,7,4,5.0,10/30/2017,"Best waitress, top notch beer and awesome half price pizza on monday!! Can not ask for more with pizzookies at $3 as well just wow! If you enjoy good affordable food thats miles better than any regular diner, this is your place!"
Salvador M.,"Las Vegas, NV",34,124,41,4.0,8/14/2017,"Consistently good food and service.  On this visit we were there on a Friday night, bar area was full (bar itself was not) and they maybe had 2 servers covering it. Our server did a great job, just feel like he could have used some help...some delay getting his attention as he was busy. Beer selection gets this from a 3, to a 4 star review. The wifi wasn't working while we were there."
Kristal L.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,29,1,2.0,11/11/2017,"Great menu. Service not so much. We told the waitress we were ready to order after getting our drinks and she said ""well, I'm not ready"" and walked away. Seriously????"
Brian H.,"McLean, VA",501,162,351,5.0,6/18/2016,"For me, this place is great. Good to find a place that has great food, great atmosphere, and no darn gambling machines at the bar. For those of you that like beer, they have a very large number of beer selections. While I am not into beer, I did notice a crazy drink menu. I can honestly say that this chain might become one of my favorite spots in the LV.  Pros- pricing, menu, drinks, atmosphere Cons- service could be faster"
Lydia H.,"Las Vegas, NV",98,6,,2.0,11/11/2017,"Went to the restaurant last night. It was a little after 8pm. Went to check in and was told there would be an hour and a half wait. We decided to order to go. After ordering was told It would be about 20 minutes.  That wasn't the case. We were probably there an hour waiting. As we looked at the line to eat in the restaurant,  all of the people that were before us and about 5 more people got seated before we even got our order. It seemed like a cluster going on. I even watched a manager give another to go order for free because it was a mess. The food was ok. It was a cold. I don't even live 5 minutes from the restaurant but the food was already cold. I was very disappointed in this visit."
Tim B.,"North Las Vegas, NV",145,4,,1.0,11/10/2017,This place sucks!!!!! Put ourselves on the online wait list and then waited 20 minutes to check in and was told you place doesn't count till you check. Why have an online check in then?!?! Waste of time
James U.,"Las Vegas, NV",12,1,,1.0,11/4/2017,The customer service sucked. When you walk up to ask a question he turns his back to you.  They also said it would be 5 min more and it was 20.  Will not be coming back again.
Chirag P.,"Las Vegas, NV",4,34,129,2.0,1/9/2017,"THE RAITING IS FOR FOOD... NOT FOR PLACE... This is one of our  GoTo place for awesome family dinner... We visit this place often and always have positive experience.  Place is always busy so reserve a table ahead of time else you would be waiting for 30 to 40 mins.  Staff is friendly and helpful. Food is awesome but my humble suggestion is....if you are hungry, don't be adventurous and order new things...stick to what you know...list you know you will finish it and fill up the belly! We (daughter, wife and i) ordered completely different food then we usually get and all we could finish was frys ordered by my daughter... It was not their fault at all... it was our fault... but what we ordered was tasteless... food has no Salut or any kind of seasoning... It was Madeterion Taco...and what ever was on side....Yaak!  Would NOT recommend that to anyone..."
Shana W.,"Las Vegas, NV",36,13,1,1.0,10/10/2017,"If they had a negative star review I'd give it!!!  We have tried this location many many many times sadly always the same bad experience!!!  We keep ""giving it another shot"" because our son loves their pazookie.  The only time we ever have a semi decent experience is when we sit at the bar which sadly then our son doesn't come along obviously.  The food is always off and either is somehow not what we ordered or has a hair, plastic or some other questionable item in it.  They have been served our son raw sliders.  The only thing they have going is they have Racer 5 IPA other than that we avoid going whenever we can!!!"
Melanie E.,"Charlotte, NC",158,873,1175,3.0,5/21/2016,"Solid value. Great kale & Brussels sprouts salad.  Could have/should have left off the chicken. Decent burger.  Cool, wide-open, loud, tv's. Good service.  Lengthy of seat yourself bar tables...share your space & meet new friends! In Summerlin coming back to LV from #redrocks conservation area! Good stop"
Jas X.,"North Las Vegas, NV",0,12,,1.0,10/16/2017,"My family and I had a terrible experience here. We arrived around 6:30 and waited for about 30 minutes. Although our server was very nice, she had no sense of urgency whatsoever. I'm not sure if it was because they were understaffed or what but our entire order was such a long lead time. From the time we sat down and got our food it had to have been about 45 minutes. When we got our dinner it was luke warm as if it was sitting in the kitchen for awhile before it even got to us. In total we were here for about 2 1/2 hrs and we probably only spent about 30 minutes eating. Definitely wouldn't recommend coming here again."
Sherri R.,"Las Vegas, NV",18,4,,3.0,8/11/2017,Sam and I go to this restaurant pretty often.  Lately it has been a bit off.   We have had the food come out wrong.  Or cold.  BUT!!   I do want to say that Miriam and Anthony are THE most amazing servers that do their BEST  to make sure that you are taken care of.  We will definitely go back but will request to sit at one of their stations.  Thank You                                                                                             Sam and Sherri
