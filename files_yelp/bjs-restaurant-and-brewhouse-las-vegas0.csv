Chuck K.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,27,3,5.0,6/25/2016,Stopped by for a Anniversary lunch because we haven't been in a while. Service was great food awesome as always and downloaded their mobile app. Pay with Apple Pay on your phone check your rewards and reserve a seat on your way to the restaurant !! Now that's cool! We will be back!
Amanda J.,"Las Vegas, NV",264,9,,5.0,1/5/2016,"Our sever was named Louis, he was probably the only nice server I've ever had at BJs and he was great!!! Always making sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed our drinks were always full. I'll request to sit in his section next time he was great.  Pozookies were great and so was the beer, and obviously the rest of the food has always been good every time I've gone but the service was always below par until this time."
Richi P.,"Grayson, GA",15,8,7,4.0,5/21/2016,"Came here around 8:30pm.....hardly wait for 10-15 min..server name Anthony helped us out....we were not so hungry so order just an appetizer one of my favorite ""avacado roll"" and ""mohito""......service was good and food was good. ...will come back..."
Elijah C.,"North Las Vegas, NV",26,27,10,4.0,5/15/2016,I don't come here very often but it's always nice when I do. The root beer is fantastic! I've never had a bad experience with service. The food is good but not fantastic. I typically get pizza.  Desert is always good but I'm usually too full to get it.
Jordan G.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,11,,1.0,5/14/2017,"READ THIS DISGUSTING COMMENT. I expected Mother's Day to be busy but service and food were still awful. During my dining experience a little boy threw up EVERY WHERE. It took employees a solid 5 minutes to address it even after multiple people had told them about it. Every employee that walked by my table said gross remarks and gave grossed out faces instead of CLEANING THE VOMIT OFF OF THE TABLE AND THE FLOOR. I then witnessed them using rags to clean the vomit up, put the vomit filled rags on THE FOOD TRAYS and re use the rags to wipe down the table. Again, since I said it was busy they quickly put the tables together for a large party to sit down. NOT AT ALL PROPERLY CLEANED. Working in the EMS field, I know how to clean up contaminated areas and using the same dirty rag over and over is not the way to do it. They didn't even mop! The next large party sat down, poor guy hit his legs on the bottom of the table, throw up was on it. He had throw up all over his legs, gross. No idea what's going on.. the manager then proceeds to play dumb and accuse the restaurant goer of coming in here with vomit already on his pants. Ridiculous. The manager definitely knew about the incident, since he walked the kid out. I leaned in and told the dude there was a little boy who threw up. I'm absolutely disgusted, they cared more about service than the health of their guests. I will NEVER dine here again."
Snook S.,"North Las Vegas, NV",0,9,,2.0,5/13/2016,"Only 2 stars cause the food is good. 35 mins in the heat cause, yes it's Friday night at 6, I understand it's busy. To walk into 10 open tables... WTF... 10 mins for water, while our server Nick was talking a long time to other guests. Almost 17 mins for my kids soda, 35 mins for mini corn dogs and a chicken club. Wow... Asked for water again never got it, never was brought ketchup. Asked for manager who did comp my meal and the app, payed for the 2 beers I waited oh so patiently for and my kids meal, begrudging left 10%, but I also am Industry. Y'all need some service lessons, ALWAYS BRING WATER NO MATER WHAT!"
Steve J.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,3,,2.0,12/7/2016,Just got home from BJ's.  Our dinner experience started bad when the hostess sat our party of 6 people in a booth make for 5 people.  We arrived at the Restaurant at 7:50 and didn't get our food until about 8:50 and the restaurant wasn't very busy.  When our food finally arrived we didn't have any utensils to eat with. We has to ask two different people before getting them.  Overall our experience was very poor and we will not be going back to this particular BJ's.
Kelly A.,"Northwest, Las Vegas, NV",0,16,6,4.0,4/19/2015,This is our first time here very impressive The food was very good and fresh! The server was very friendly. I will come back
Lauren H.,"Henderson, NV",1,53,,4.0,6/2/2016,"Our server was great-bummed I can't remember his name. But our food was good. We got the fried portobello mushrooms and I got a peach margarita: $9.50 for the margarita- can't say it was worth that much. I got a burger which was good and my husband got a steak which he loved, but it was a little burnt on the outside for me. Overall decent place to go."
Garbis O.,"Las Vegas, NV",97,13,21,4.0,10/9/2015,Service was great and the food was delicious Jessica and Anthony were great waiters. Made sure my bloody Mary's were always on point. All and all everything was awesome !! Thank u !!
Abdul H.,"Southeast, Las Vegas, NV",78,28,3,5.0,4/4/2016,I've been to this location a few times and I just have to say the service I had tonight was superb. 5 star to the maximum Luis C our server was top notch other employees need to take notes from him
Ray H.,"Colorado Springs, CO",65,58,12,2.0,4/24/2016,"Been here before and numerous other BJ's. Not sure if I came here on an ""off day"" but neither food nor service was great. Food was just blah this time around and I usually get the same, fried artichoke hearts, chiken  bacon ranch pizza and oreo pizzokie. None of them were as good as I remember them in the past and the oreo pizzokie didn't taste if oreo and it was really salty. Might be willing to try again but with all other options around the area it will be hard to get my business back."
Paulamertha A.,"Suisun City, CA",287,472,617,5.0,4/6/2015,"I'm NOT a huge fan of BJ's food, but this place gets 5 out of 5 stars because of the amazing service we had here! I forgot our waiter's name, but he was effin' AMAZING! Very friendly, funny, attentive to our needs, and gave excellent recommendations in regards to food choices and drinks. Despite being busy, our food was brought out to us rather quickly. After paying for our meal, we spent a little while just chatting with our waiter (yeah, he was that cool)."
Mishka D.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,1,,5.0,5/17/2016,My family and myself were at your restaurant on Sunday.  Our server was Nicholas and he was very attentive to our needs.  One of the politest young men we have encountered in our life.  The food was very yummy.  The kid who brought our food was a doll as well.  Thank you for the fantastic dining experience.  Plan on making this our regular Sunday dining place.  Thank you hiring such a wonderful staff.
Thao J.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,1,,5.0,11/11/2016,"Loved our server, Jennifer! Best wishes to her and her baby girl  Excellent service and great food. Definitely coming back"
Rhaissa R.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,8,,5.0,4/12/2016,"My brother and I came to bjs to try something fresh, after hitting the gym and we ordered the Santa Fe and the Asian chopped salad..we loved the presentation, it looked so delicious and it was so flavorful, we are definetely coming back next week. Great service, great food with an outstanding food presentation that makes you want to get more."
George R.,"Sugar Land, TX",171,205,138,4.0,3/16/2014,"We've seen this place back home in Houston, Tx but had never been. Our daughter took us while in town and I absolutely loved the home brew. Had the Maui pork chop and it was very tasty but the red potatoes that it came with so very dry, but the fresh green beans definitely made up for it."
rickys h.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,38,10,4.0,7/2/2015,"I'd recommend appetizers and drinks for this place. The burger was alright, the appetizers were top notch, and the beer was delicious. I'd also recommend double checking your bank statement. (Don't panic, the problem fixed itself.) The staff gave us really really great service and the manager handled my over billing issue promptly. Thanks BJs!"
Teresa G.,"Sierra Vista, AZ",156,458,687,4.0,12/4/2013,Finally got around to try this place out. I've heard good thugs about this place and wanted to see what it was all about. I came here for lunch with the girls 2 times. The second time the service was slow but all in all the service wasn't too bad. They make their own root beer and cherry soda. How awesome is that! Unlimited refills too. Even better!   I tried the Cobb salad from their lunch menu and it was the perfect portion. Not too big and my too small. I was able to finish it all and still feel comfortable. No stuffy feeling if you know what I mean.  Although this is a bar it's still a nice place to come to grab a bite to eat. If you are in a rush you might want to get take out.  I can't wait to sample other items in their menu.
Amy G.,"Las Vegas, NV",95,4,,1.0,10/5/2016,"Had the worst experience at BJ's last night. It was National FREE Pizookie Day and I was craving one so we ventured out. After waiting almost 50 minutes when we were told it would be 30, we were seated. Ordered basic things along with a ""sprite"" (that is not the brand they have) which we were told the syrup was out and they had no more - we got one from the bar... - anyway, our food came but we waited another 6 minutes before we got utensils so food got cold. Not totally blaming the server but MAN service was bad. Our drinks ran out and other servers noticed and were pointing - 10 minutes later we got a refill. That was the theme of the night - waiting. On the table was a ""flyer"" that said if you download app and pay with it you get a free mini pizookie, we asked if we do that can we get a mini and the free regular. Our server said ""I will just bring you 2 regular ones"" - OK, great! We figured he was making up for our LONG, cold food night. After ordering pizookies then waiting another 20 minutes to get said pizookies - happy at last. I got the reward I was looking for. Finally the bill was dropped off - our server charged us FULL price for the 2nd pizookie we would not have ever ordered. We could not find him or anyone else and it was now 9:pm. I just put the exact amount of bill down - and left. Last time they ever get my business. Horrible service! Not sure if the food was any good as it was cold by the time we got to eat it. The pizookie was awesome - as always but the price was not!! Never again BJ's."
