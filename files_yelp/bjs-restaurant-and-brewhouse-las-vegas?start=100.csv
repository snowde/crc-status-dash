Jordan M.,"Las Vegas, NV",37,4,,5.0,7/10/2017,"After coming from the bjs across in summerlin because of terrible service it felt good coming to this bjs and being taken care of without asking, our server ericka was so on point, and the other waiters were helpful as well"
Angela E.,"Las Vegas, NV",7,15,25,4.0,5/3/2016,"I probably come here 3-4 times a year and tonight the food was really good. We started with the guacamole and chips. It was $4.95! I couldn't make my own guacamole for that price. That's definitely a good priced appetizer. I ordered the Enlightened turkey burger and it was delicious. It said it had Dijon mustard, but it was just regular yellow mustard. I didn't mind though, it was pretty good. It came with a side salad. I'll definitely get this meal again.  Our server was a little slow. We asked for a few minutes to look over the menu and then she just kept passing by us to take care of other tables. It took her about 10 minutes to get our order taken. Then when she dropped off the check she kept passing by us again and again."
Cherie M.,"Las Vegas, NV",46,25,1,2.0,6/4/2017,Lunch date with my love turned into regretting the choice of where we went. Service was meh and the food was not very good. The place could use a lot of work. It's a huge disappointment when the experience is horrible from the every angle.
Sarah H.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,5,3,1.0,5/8/2017,"BJs has really gone downhill. I ordered a chicken salad which included a cold grilled chicken breast, which seemed to have been refrigerated. Service is not what it used to be, we boxed up our own to go food. In the past our servers have always boxed up our food. The waitress was not famaliar with their drink menu and the drinks were not good. My husband ordered a ""drink like that' and it was not made lime it used to be.  Our check came to us wrong and had to be corrected.  BJs used to be one of my favorite places however the food and service are not what I remembered."
Shannon T.,"Las Vegas, NV",91,23,13,5.0,11/23/2016,"Bj's is close to Cheesecake Factory in menu options. There are 20 pages. I finally opted for the lunch menu unlimited soup and salad. Decent sized portions and delicious options of 6 soups and 3 salads. Our server Korina was very knowledgeable about the menu and patient as we perused the menu trying to decide on the massive selection. My wife ended up going with the kale and roasted Brussels sprouts salad, which she had eaten before. Everything was made well, and arranged in a nice aesthetic.  I love the menu variety and the food has been consistently good each time I have visited. It's nice to have a restaurant catering to a larger audience and palate.  I will add that there are many vegan and gluten free options."
Shannon B.,"Las Vegas, NV",8,128,48,4.0,2/21/2017,"Went in Friday night, the wait was 25-30 minutes which we expected. It took about 40 to be seated. I know it was a guess but still it took a while. The waiter was nice and the food was good. I've been twice since we moved to this side of town and service and food has been good. We will be back."
Michael H.,"Las Vegas, NV",1651,83,1304,5.0,1/11/2016,"This is the fastest I have EVER chosen to update my review from barely a week ago. I mention this to further attest to the seriousness to which I attach this addendum to my original review. It is not something I do often (or ever, actually) and I apologize for the need to do so, but given the turn of events, I feel that this update is required and is not done in a post haste mindset.  Now, I specifically said in my original review that the reason that I chose to give BJ's a 4/5 star review was due to their decision to remove a long standing menu item that had been offered in their menu for well over a decade. The menu item in question is their former proprietary ""Cobb Sandwich"" which was removed from their menu approximately two years ago.  After I posted my review, a customer service representative from BJ's commented on my review and said the following: ""Hi Michael, Thank you for your comments. We can still make the Cobb Sandwich for you, the only difference would have to use ranch instead of the creamy garlic dressing. Just let us know and we will be more than happy to make it for you.  Thank you.  Frank Acosta"" Though I have not had the opportunity as yet to test this offer, I am trusting that Mr. Acosta being an employee and public representative of BJ's, is certainly speaking the truth. The next time I go to BJ's I will certainly order my favorite sandwich and can certainly get over the fact that ranch will replace the creamy garlic dressing of the original. This is much more minor of an update versus New Coke and Coke Classic. Yes, I realize that it potentially opens the doors of High Fructose Corn Syrup in CocaCola Classic versus original Coke, but that is a debate for another time (and Mexican Coke, made with real sugar, is all I carry in my fridge anyway).  I personally wanted to thank Mr. Acosta for his comment on my review and thank BJ's in general for twenty years of delicious bar food in a fun and vibrant atmosphere.  BJ's Brea was my headquarters through the mid to late 1990's and I still go there whenever we make it back to the old OC.  Thank you, BJ's for creating the great Cobb Sandwich and for being an all around wonderful restaurant and nostalgic place to socialize and enjoy custom brews."
Gabi S.,"Henderson, NV",54,20,5,1.0,7/14/2016,"EXTREMELY disappointed, came here for my birthday dinner asked for a booth and waited for it.. Got seated at a table.. Asked to be moved to a booth the waiter Justin was TERRIBLE we waited like a ridiculous amount of time to just get water he wasn't very friendly or personable. He catered to a table that came in after us which was extremely frustrating he brought our drinks separately every couple of minutes so we asked for our check and instead of apologizing for the crappy service he gave us attitude and just dropped the check off for the drinks we ordered. I'm not one for getting free things but seriously a 12$ tab for shitty service and drinks we barely drank should've been comped. Won't be coming back."
Aurora V.,"San Antonio, TX",0,3,,1.0,9/18/2017,"I ordered a shrimp and asparagus pasta which I tried and did not like at all. The waitress was nice, but why charge full price for something that I mentioned not liking. She said to me, ""well at least you were a trooper and tried something new"". Did not bother letting a manager know or anything. Great way to fix the problem!"
Mindy M.,"Las Vegas, NV",7,120,19,5.0,3/5/2017,"My dear sister mentioned we dine here on Saturday with my Mom and so glad we did.  They were a little busy in the dining are, so we took the option for the bar seating in a booth (we are non-drinkers) and so glad we did.  Two of us were famished, and the dark haired female server efficiently took our order, brought us a the delicious avocado eggroll appetizer and meals came out promptly.  They have the best Arnold Palmer's here and my sister and Mom mentioned the flavored ice teas here are wonderful.  My Mom had the cherry glazed salmon dinner and loved it, my sister had the Mediterranean pizza and was in awe of it as she said she had been craving it.  I opted for the my favorite chopped asian chicken salad and loved it with the great dressing and veggies - so good!  Check it out if you haven't been here for a while!"
DeShawn A.,"Las Vegas, NV",232,202,209,3.0,11/24/2015,I really like BJ's. Food is great but service is kind of slow. It's like they don't have enough employees. The guy that served our table was great but you can tell he was overworked by having way too many tables. We placed our order and we ended not getting our appetizer just because it was simply too many customers and not enough help.I felt bad for him and tried not to make any requests. I hope they hire more people soon!
Shelly S.,"Las Vegas, NV",4,79,59,3.0,10/16/2016,"Really disappointed that a place that should be great, just is not. The food is meh. Not great, not bad. The server said they are known for their pizza. Really?  It certainly isn't something I would be bragging about. I'm a pizzaholic, and this tasted exactly like Pizza Hut deep dish. Nothing special. Speaking of nothing special, either is the service. Won't return."
Amber B.,"Las Vegas, NV",24,8,,4.0,1/29/2017,It's a good place for happy hour with my friends. Not into sports or beer but their poke is pretty good. Not my favorite but close to my house and easy to get to.
Tee M.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,12,,2.0,5/28/2017,"I've always liked BJ's, however this was my first time trying a burger. I was disappointed. I ordered the sliders minus onion and lettuce. All I got was way overcooked patties between 2 buns. They decided to omit the pickles, ketchup and cheese (paid an extra 1.50 for the cheese). Lesson learned, don't order burgers from here."
Debra S.,"North Las Vegas, NV",2,12,4,2.0,2/17/2017,"Went here just today for the first time and I was very disappointed:( I came with my dad, fiance, and baby. I ordered the fish and chips which I know are inherently greasy but this was a whole new level of greasy! I ate 2 out of 4 of the fish and was nauseous before I even finished the second one. My dad ate one and said it was way too greasy as well, we ended up peeling off the breading completely but by then I was over it. I only ate a few fries they were good but after the fish I couldn't stomach very many so basically that was a complete waste of money. I wish I had asked them to take it away and off the bill but I didn't want to ruin our time out. My dad and fiance both had the rib eye, they said it was good. The place was very nice on the inside and the service was okay."
Tom G.,"Las Vegas, NV",25,22,,3.0,4/29/2017,Excellent food but service is slow.Ive been waiting 20 minutes to get the check and it isn't very busy here.Not good
Monica A.,"Reno, NV",125,15,,5.0,4/27/2017,"Brit was a great server, she helped us make a steak Caesar salad within menu options and was attentive to our needs. Always had a full water which is great."
Leighanne S.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,12,,5.0,4/27/2017,Great ribs and great service.  John was excellent.  We will returning soon.
Jeanette D.,"Las Vegas, NV",143,1,,1.0,8/31/2017,"I am so disappointed with BJ's. I walked in and asked for a gluten free menu and they told me that they no longer have menus that are gluten free but that I had to go online and look at it.  I was totally surprised and when I did go online you couldn't find the menu. It took me some time to find what might be the gluten free menu. I have never experienced anything like this and I wonder if they will stop giving menus to kids or just stop having menus altogether? I know one thing, I will never go back to a BJ's again. In my family when we go out we go to gluten free friendly restaurants since I have the medical condition to gluten."
Tanya V.,"North Las Vegas, NV",1,22,20,5.0,9/11/2016,"We come here constantly and have had other servers, but John is hands down the best. SO attentive and fast.  The food is also very tasty. You can never go wrong with the avocado eggrolls."
