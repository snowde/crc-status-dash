Allan P.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,1,,1.0,8/26/2017,Service is crappy.. how can you make reservations and takes as long of a wait as a walk in? The it'll be ready in 5 mins ended in 45 min wait?
Doug W.,"Las Vegas, NV",4,4,5,1.0,8/29/2015,"In the words of the late, great Arthur Ashe ""Trust has to be earned, and should come only after the passage of time"".  These words should be the foundation that I make my dining selections on when eating away from home. Selecting the BJ's location on Centennial in the Northwest part of Las Vegas should have never happened after the third or fourth time my family and I had a bad experience, but I kept believing that they could earn my trust.  My child, who loves the Pizookie however, makes that choice a bit more difficult. We have experienced more than a few 'let-downs' at this location, but the latest experience might be one of the worst.  The latest implosion occurred tonight. We are rewards card holders and used the app to check in so our wait time might be lessened, but when we arrived we were still waiting, which we understood as it was a particularly busy night.  After an hour of waiting in the restaurant we asked how much longer the wait was. The hostess advised they were cleaning our table right then. Fifteen minutes later, the same hostess approaches us and said that she ""forgot us"" and that she would seat is promptly. Great start, BJ's.  The hostess said she would have the manager come to us because of the situation, but of course that never happened. We had to ask for him ourselves and explained the latest disaster. Our server was very helpful for the most part, which was a good thing, but the potato skins that we ordered for an appetizer took nearly 30 minutes and when it came out it was skimpy to say the least. Two were missing any ingredients other than a hint of cheese (see pics).   When my burger finally arrived (the smokehouse burger with bacon), the top bun looked like it was run over by a bus and the patty itself was as flat as paper.  The wedge-cut fries were mangled in only a way that Freddy Krueger could produce. There was one piece of lettuce that looked as if it was wilted days before it was served. Disgusting and inedible. There was another couple sitting opposite us who also had a burger, and it looked completely fine. Very frustrating.  The manager visited our table on three separate occasions and to his credit tried to make the best of it. He advised that he is trying to make improvements to the location but after 3 years of hearing this I think I am finally listening to my inner-Arthur. The trust is not there and I am fed up.  I have been to many BJ's locations around the country and most have been wonderful. This location is an unmitigated disaster and needs to be exorcised."
Robert S.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,146,,5.0,8/19/2017,"This is your standard casual dining restaurant and it does its job effectively.  We come 2-3 times per month and rarely have any issues.  The food is good, the drinks are done well, and the servers are prompt and efficient.  I would recommend this place over TGIFridays and Chili's any day."
Supatra P.,"Las Vegas, NV",233,19,19,1.0,5/18/2016,"I am very disappointed at BJS tonight .. I never had horrible service here, but today was just not good from the beginning .  I believe I came in around 830 , maybe 9. Regardless, they close at 11.  Service starts from the time you enter the restaurant . The hostess said ""hello"" but it was not welcoming at all . I understand the POS is what you use to see who got sat , who's leaving etc, but that screen isn't going anywhere . She honestly did not look up while she asked me ""how many people, or even when she said hello"" til I asked her why I was getting waited 15 min ( bc I needed a high chair and I need a table that wouldn't violate safety measures, understandable). She didn't smile at all . Even people that were leaving the restaurant , she was still looking at the POS and said ""BYE"" . It was very insincere .  So we waited a little , then we got sat . I think we were the last table this server was gonna have or something? Because we got rushed from the time we sat til we paid out.  I'm not sure if it's because we look like kids,or bc I wanted to do a BJS special promo , but she treated us with such haste , and didn't really check up on us.  The only person that was really nice and made conversation was the food runner.  Even though he came around once, he was human and wasn't like a robot doing his job . I understand rush , but it wasn't busy ..  Regardless of bad service all around , I gave her 10 on 40, which is decent tip. Just want to remind servers , don't judge a book by its cover , don't rush customers , don't assume I'm being cheap bc of the promos you have .  Please, if your shift is over or if you have to go somewhere , let a customer know, instead of not saying anything and giving me the check when I didn't even get my dessert . Even asking for what dessert I want when I'm still eating my pizza . I would understand more if you told me your shift was ending or something . I didn't expect this type of service here .  I came here because of a food promo, but mostly because I wanted the delicious pizookie , but it definitely felt like a home that I wasn't welcomed too .. Thanks BJS."
Ken S.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",33,18,,3.0,4/10/2017,Every meal I've had here has been excellent our only complaint is the service we don't know if it's because the kitchen is so slow or it's because the servers are so slow but every time we've been there the service is been very slow
Mymy T.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,33,2,3.0,11/2/2016,We went here last night to grab a couple drinks and snack on food. Sat at the bar and Alenka?? Was our bartender. She didn't really care about providing a great dining experience. She did cater to her regular customers giving one of them part of our shot that we ordered. The shot glasses that was used to make a Washington apple was definitely not big enough to hold a mixed shot. It is better to use for just a straight or chilled shot. So she gave us the half shot of the Washington apple and  gave the rest of our shot to one of her regular customer two seats down. (I bartend so I know this). That's fine! When we received our pizza she didn't care to ask if we need chili flakes or parmesan because she was busy breaking the bar down at 10:30. I've dined her before and I have to say this is the worse. I do love the food though. Will be back just not sitting at the bar if she's back there.
Melialani A.,"North Las Vegas, NV",1,9,1,5.0,1/17/2017,"5 stars because Anthony our waiter was the BEST! Great food and wine, super tasty, but Anthony made our whole dinner and experience amazing. So impressed. Will be back!"
Jeanie C.,"North Las Vegas, NV",58,43,,4.0,11/13/2016,this is one of our favorite places to go have pizza. They are happy to do the pizzas half and half so we can have a variety. even on a crowded Saturday night the service was still good.
Tara C.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,14,,2.0,3/3/2017,"It's B.Js. I obviously go in with lesser expectations than I would have at a fine dining restaurant but come on just because you're not a fine dining restaurant doesn't mean you shouldn't expect to have  regrets but I always do. I can't complain about the food it's just crazy that it doesn't matter what time of day or night you go how many people are actually in there you are always going to wait wait to get seated wait for your food mostly just the amount of time I wait for even the smallest order aggravates me. You ask me why I keep going. Well because the staff is nice, the menu is so large that everybody can find something to eat. We live in Centennial Hills, the options are limited out here, so I honestly think that's why BJs doesn't step up their game when it comes to production time."
Patrick L.,"North Las Vegas, NV",1,7,4,5.0,3/1/2017,Great food. Excellent service and awesome pizzas. There rootbeer is without a doubt a 5. Lacking consistency in there food and service is why i am giving it a 4. Excellent ribs best in town.
Daniel A.,"Las Vegas, NV",20,98,251,4.0,8/15/2015,Great Service nice atmosphere good food good variety of beer definitely will be going back again
Anita K.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,4,,5.0,8/5/2017,"Great food, great service! Our server Anthony was terrific. His recommendations were spot on and he was friendly, funny, knowledgeable and attentive. We will definitely be coming back."
Robin B.,"Las Vegas, NV",40,18,6,4.0,7/21/2015,"BJ's continues to be a family favorite. The monzarella, and tomato salad is to die for! Their new brussel sprouts with the sriracha sauce, it's okay. The sauce is delicious, however I would suggest blanching them first, and then put them on the grill for more tenderness. My husband had the portebello swiss burger. He said it was really good, less the balsalmic vinegar.  We will continue to come to BJ'S. I love how they are always adding new menu items. Their craft beers are really good.  Our waitress, Rhonda was very attentive, and helpful. Thank you for a  wonderful experience."
Liz F.,"North Las Vegas, NV",47,55,23,4.0,6/5/2016,"I choose this place over BWW any day. More great food selection, great beer and lots of TVs for gameday without the BWW crowd. Happy Hour is great here too. Unlike BWW, they don't have happy hour. Love this place and great location."
Dan M.,"Las Vegas, NV",14,34,,1.0,12/23/2016,"Horrible service!  Not even busy.  The greeter/hostess was insistent on putting us in the bar area, after telling her we'd rather have a booth...then directed us to a dirty booth in the bar area while they sat other parties of two who came in after us.  We did not have menus or a server.  I asked the manager for some service and told him our complaints and was told ""what would you like me to do about it?""...absolutely nothing buddy!  We left and will no longer eat here.  Customer service is a lost art and BJs proved that.  1 star..."
Chris G.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,8,,2.0,7/27/2017,"Very disappointed on this trip to BJ's we got here at 6:10 p.m. seated at 6:35 p.m. it's a Thursday they have the rib special dinner and they were out of ribs! seriously BJ's? At 6:35 Prime dinner hour you think they would have been prepared with their special of the day. We Come here once in a great while it's been about a year because service was terrible the last time we were here. Now I have to say the availability of their specials is definitely not good don't know if we'll be coming back sorry to say. Update as we asked for the check we see ribs being served two other tables this will be the last time we came to BJ's. The server said they found a few more ribs, really."
Danny G.,"Henderson, NV",53,28,67,1.0,3/31/2016,"This reviews a week to late. Server: Unknown  (Fortunately, I have forgotten her name) -Weekday, Dinner, Party of 2 It took approximately 8-10 minutes for our table to be greeted. This I can understand being aware that some server stations are bigger than others, or granted she could have been running another tables food. No biggie.  Greet: (Asking for our beverages) We had to repeat ourselves 3 times on what we would like to order because apparently it was too loud in the restaurant for her and she couldn't hear us. We could both hear her just fine but instead of her kneeling in or stepping closer to us she would just ask for us to speak louder.  -We ordered or at least attempted to order:     -1 Cider      -Taster Set: with 2 out of 4 being the wrong beers.  -She was not familiar with her beers and when she dropped them at our table she put them all down without telling us which beer was which.      -2 waters: which neither of us received.      -Appetizer: Chicken Lettuce Wraps: which we also never received.  Entrees ordered: Received no utensils and or napkins.      -Brisket Burger: Arrived cold and looked very unappealing.  (We have been here and had eaten and seen it before.) Sent Back.     -Medium Pizza: Warm but crust was soggy underneath. Kept because we were hungry. -We did not have the missing food or burger remade since we knew it would take to long. We just ate the pizza.  Server: Was not attentive and although she apologized she seemed very unapologetic. She was MIA most of the time although we were the only people in the section left. Originally it was completely full but we outlasted our stay not because we were hanging out but rather because we were just waiting for food or service.  Check: She brought our check and then offered us water. -_- -She picked up her check quickly, which was upsetting due to the lack of service we received."
Jenn P.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,16,3,1.0,12/14/2016,"Came in on a Wednesday night for my husbands birthday. The wait wasn't bad at all but our service was horrible. We were not checked on until about 30 plus minutes into our meal, our water was empty, we didn't get our ketchup or sauces or anything. My husband had a free pizookie and that didn't come for another 40 min!!! And we asked ahead of time to get it started!! Then we waited another 20 min for someone (who was not our sever) get our check so we can pay. & my husband actually had to physically get up and ask for our bill so we can leave!!!! He didn't even give us our bill!!!! We were here for a total of 2 hours and 30 min!!! Almost 3 freakin hours!!!!!! This was ridiculous & on all days my husbands birthday."
Donna K.,"Wailuku, HI",56,28,2,4.0,10/2/2016,"It was late but we were looking for a place to eat.  It was 30 minutes to closing and they readily welcomed us in.  The food was good, we loved the dessert!  Service was great!!  I loved the ambiance...we will go back again!!"
Elizabeth C.,"Marina, CA",7,11,2,5.0,8/27/2016,"This was the first time my husband and I have eaten here and it was AMAZING.  We are originally from a touristy west coast city and in the hospitality and customer service business, now living in Las Vegas and in similar industry. We have made a habit of at least once a week trying a place we haven't eaten before and then we can pass our opinions on to our customers who may ask what's a good place around here. This visit was on a Wednesday around 6:30.  We expected it to busy, it's the dinner rush, and it was very busy, a mark of a good restaurant.  There were plenty of people waiting to be seated but the hostess greeted us the second we walked in the door.  She told us wait times for booth, table, and bar then gave us a buzzer.  Our wait time was going to be 20 minutes, but all people waiting were seated quickly and it turned out to be less than 10 minutes.   Our drink order was taken as soon as we were seated by a hostess, then our waitress introduced herself as she delivered our drinks a moment later.  Her name was Heather, and she was THE BEST SERVER EVER!  She made some good recommendations, stayed right on top of filling our drinks and clearing any empty dishes.  The food we ordered was perfect, even special requests were done right. (Ranch on the side, substitutions, etc.)  Heather was even good enough to chat with us for a minute when I asked about how long she had been waitressing, and she kept an eye on her other tables without being rude and didn't ignore anyone.   We will definitely return and sample other menu items, and all of our customers will be encouraged to eat here as well. THANK YOU!!!"
