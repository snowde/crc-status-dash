Patti M.,"Northwest, Las Vegas, NV",1,4,6,1.0,5/20/2016,3rd visit not good! Waited for server to bring waters Took her 10min Then server sets them down And takes another table their drinks  Doesn't return until she turns in their order  Then busses another table! We left!
andrea m.,"Las Vegas, NV",98,112,92,5.0,3/6/2016,I come here frequently and usually do the curbside which is solid but tonight I came with the family and dined in. Anthony is AMAZING!! Didn't skip a beat and even brought us sides of ranch and caramel with our dessert! My chicken Caesar salad was awesome as well as chicken pitas!! Great service made this dinner tonight though!!! He is five star!!!
Hanna L.,"North Las Vegas, NV",0,5,46,3.0,5/15/2017,"Food is great, service is slow lots of workers Doing nothing while one server is waiting 7 tables by herself,waitress was giving backhanded compliments when she felt uncomfortable about us getting upset about it taking a long time,hostess would not look at me when she sat us and was giving dirty looks every time she would walk by,I'm not looking for compensation just want you to fix it the problem. I love bjs and have been going here for years."
Brian P.,"Las Vegas, NV",256,643,2561,4.0,2/4/2014,"I'm going to start frequenting BJ's more, because I had forgotten how delicious their beers were! Since moving to Vegas I haven't gone to BJ's much because there are so many other options when dining out. If you're a beer lover, this place is a must try because they are as much of a microbrewery, as they are a restaurant. Sometimes if they're promoting a certain beer, your server may even offer you a sample. Or if you're not sure what to get, opt for a flight of ""samples"". When it comes to food, BJ's is comparable to Yardhouse or other mid-range bar/grill type places. I typically go for a couple of their small plates, which are tapas sized appetizers, to start off and my favorite is the mini-bruschetta. On my most recent visit, I also tried the new corn fritters w/ bacon aioli and an order of their traditional wings, which are pieces of fried chicken with a side of buffalo sauce and a side of ranch. The food is always fresh...the only issue I've had is that sometimes they deliver food to the wrong table because your server is never the person who brings out the food...not sure why that is because that is typically why each table is assigned a server isn't it?  The burgers, flatbreads, pizza, and appetizers here are all usually pretty tasty and sometimes I have no idea what I want to order. If you come Mon-Fri during lunch, there's a lunch specials menu you can order off of with pretty decent pricing...I think it starts at $6.95, but I've never tried it so I'm not sure what the portions are like. The staff here at this location are nice and continuously stop by to check on you. If you're seated in an area where the server is busy, another server will often stop by and introduce themselves and put in your drink order so that you're not just sitting around like an idiot. I like that. They also have a rewards program but sadly you don't get points/credit for alcohol/beer!  This BJ's is always packed when I'm here in the evenings and I can see why! The bar area is nice with both tables and barstools, and many large TVs, making it a good place to watch sports as well. I will be coming back a lot more in the future, even if it's only for beer!"
Margaret D.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,1,,1.0,9/29/2017,"Worst restaurant experience in a long time. Ordered a Diet Coke while waiting for a friend. The soda was flat easy to see no carbonation why would the waitress even bring it out. She was not surprised when I told her. She said I'll get it from the bar.  Food was not good. We both order clam chowder only got one.  Had to wait 5 more minutes for the other soup and then got no crackers. Flatbread was crispy on the edges and the rest very soggy. Never had a soggy flatbread anywhere. My freind ordered a regular  salad  was wilted and looked like it was sitting around for hours.  She was not happy with it. Three different food runners stoped at are table trying to deliver food that was not ours. All of the staff were very unfriendly with the exception of the hostess who was very sweet.  Both my friend had GI distress after eating, we both had the same soup. I had downloaded the BJs app and asked the waitress about it and she don't ask me I don't know anything about it. I have since deleted it.  Will not be going back to BJ's. The other thing specials Monday thru Thursday why not on Friday??"
Cecilia H.,"Las Vegas, NV",95,145,294,4.0,5/6/2015,"Happy hour is great! Went to this location for the forst time and it was a great experience. Happy hours lots of options and great value. Wings, pizza, spinach and artichoke dip. They also have pear cider which is hard to find and it was all great food. Five stars because the food was great, happy hour and the staff was very friendly."
Kelly S.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,2,,1.0,8/19/2016,"AWFUL! Had to wait 40 mins on a week night, but that was fine (the hostess was very nice and apologetic). We were seated and the table was still dirty, the hostess had to clean it off and the table was left wet and gross. We then waited over 15 mins and still no waiter came over, finally flagged one down (pretty bad that I have to try to track someone down when at least 4 waiters walked by us in the 15-20 mins we were sitting there) and he said this was not his table, but he would place our order. My daughter's milk did not come out with the rest of the drinks (explain this to a 4 year old who has already been sitting at a table for 20 mins). Our waiter said he would send a manager over, the manager never came. I finally had to flag down another waiter to ask for a manager and about my daughter's milk. Meanwhile we have been sitting now for 25 mins.  We ordered an appetizer that came out with our food, which took forever. Then we had our food and no silverware. A manager finally came over, but at that point it was just ridiculous. I would have gotten better service at a fast food place. At least we would have gotten our drinks. They took 25% off the bill, but that was insulting because it was not even worth it. Thanks for saving me a few dollars and having a terrible experience and a grouchy 4 year old. Overall terrible and will not be going back. If I ran a business like this, I would be out of business."
Carolina V.,"Sunrise, Las Vegas, NV",109,9,,5.0,10/11/2016,"Incredible!! We had an amazing waiter, Anthony. He was attentive, knowledgeable and incredibly on top of service.  We were absolutely delighted to be seated in his section and will request him by name in the future. The food was also very very good.  Great experience which was again enhanced by service!"
Natasha B.,"Las Vegas, NV",4,41,11,3.0,9/17/2016,"I was really optimistic about coming back here, given that I waited a year.  Sat in the bar area due to it being a Saturday and the wait time for a table.  The bar staff was attentive at first, but once the food was ordered, it's like we didn't exist.  Jamie (the female bartender) was talking poorly about policies, management, and previous disciplinary action taken against her to her regulars. While I understand wanting to vent, this isn't the time or place to do it.  Food came out. Only thing I asked was no mustard on my sandwich. Simple, right?.... Always. ALWAYS. It never fails! When I ask for something specific, such as NO mustard, it comes out with mustard!  While waiting for my sandwich to be remade, the manager was very friendly. He offered a drink or chips. Also offered desert when we were finished. I declined due to not being a desert person.  I was truly hoping for a better experience and don't see myself coming back anytime soon."
staci b.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,15,3,2.0,4/28/2017,"Nothing like being lied to about the wait! Got here at 5:44 & was told that the wait was 25 minutes, well it is now 6:33 and no seat. I don't mind a wait just hate being mislead- won't be back."
Barry V.,"North Las Vegas, NV",41,19,10,4.0,3/23/2016,"Been to this location a handful of times with my wife. Food is consistently very good. Well, I'm not sure about all the food. We usually just get a pizza . Once we came in for lunch specials and we were pleased then as well. Excellent craft beer, Jeremiah Red is my favorite. The pizookies are amazing.  Lastly, on our most recent visit over the weekend. We had a young waiter named James. He was completely swamped, and also one of the best servers we have had at any restaurant."
Loren M.,"North Las Vegas, NV",69,448,852,4.0,11/27/2015,"BOY this place is always packed! They have the booths, tables, and bar area to hold a lot of people, but there is usually a line to be seated. So keep that in mind when you decide to stop by BJ's for a meal. There are enough TVs to keep you occupied. I love the dark interior but there is still a very open feel with all the windows. Now, customer service is where the place could use some improvement. The waiters seem to be so busy and overwhelmed that they barely can catch their breath when they stop by your table. Food does tend to take about 10 minutes to come out but again with the amount of people ordering, I bet getting the food out rapidly is a bit of a challenge. The menu has something for everyone. Even the newly transitioned vegan that I have become can find a handful of items to munch on. Prices are comparable and right on for the atmosphere. I feel BJ's is a step from say Chili's, Applebee's, etc. I could see BJ's being a good place for a first date, a family gathering, sports date, or a work gathering."
Tyler O.,"Las Vegas, NV",11,14,,1.0,1/27/2016,"I've been to this location many times. Often it is tolerable. One time we had a great server, but that was just one time. Tonight was just as bad. We ordered our food. I like these fries they have (or used to have) with pork and green salsa. They removed them from the menu a couple months ago, but when I went in tonight, they were back on the menu - so I ordered them. After several exchanges with the waitress in between about how we think our orders are wrong (and her telling us they weren't), we finally got our bill. Amy S., our server, charged us for pork sliders, which are nearly double the price of the pork fries. I bring it up, along with our points for a discount, and she tells me their not on the menu. I told her they were and that's why I ordered them, and she says they're not and they have to charge me for these sliders instead. I am very disappointed after this trip. I don't see how it's my fault that I ordered what's being shown on the menu.  Absolutely no attempt to make it right, she only told me how I am wrong, then gave me my bill back to pay. We likely won't be back after this. We've had pretty poor service here before, but this was completely unnecessary and frustrating."
Darren H.,"Las Vegas, NV",5,12,15,5.0,9/25/2016,"We go to this BJs pretty frequently. Each member in my family can find something they like and the beer is good too (they even make their own root beer which is really good). I would agree with most posts that their wait staff is substandard; until today. We met Anthony (our server) and he exceeded our expectations. He was extremely attentive, polite and genuinely interested in making our dining experience enjoyable. If you go, request Anthony. Maybe the management will create a training program around his commitment to serving guests."
Celine R.,"North Las Vegas, NV",6,23,73,4.0,7/14/2016,"The food was great, but the pizookie was the best! Every single flavor is so delicious. You have to get one even if you're full and can't fit no more, just make room haha! Over all our waiter was AMAZING! Shout out to James for making us have such a wonderful time. First time meeting him and it felt like we have been friends for a while! He was on top of everything for our group, especially with the surprise bday pizookie for my bestfriend! Never been so happy to give such a big tip. Thanks for the great food and service from James BJ's!"
Nicolle P.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,8,,1.0,4/29/2017,I am a frequent visitor of this franchise but at the local Summerlin location. This restaurant by far has the worst customer service. The hostess have no idea what they are doing while standing at front counter giggling. The restaurant is always under staffed for servers and you will sit and wait for 20 minutes with a room full of open tables. After waiting 20 minutes the hostess lead us down a row of tables to a spot the server advised he could not seat anymore people in at this time! I would not recommend this location for dining.
Damien M.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,7,,1.0,8/26/2016,"Smells like a urine washed subway station in here. Server is nice, but super slow. And dishes (plates included) brought out are dirty. Other Yelpers said so, found out for myself. Yuck"
John V.,"Las Vegas, NV",102,108,98,4.0,11/22/2015,"Always a great place to eat for lunch or dinner or even just grab appetizers and drinks.  This location in N. Las Vegas is always on busy side so be sure to plan ahead on your times to attend. Staff has always been great and service has always been on par even when its a full capacity.  The bar location has bull seating, along with some table tops and booths. There are many TV's displayed around the restaurant but the bar area has the most options. The overall restaurant has many table and booth seating's and even an area for large groups. Park is pretty standard at this location and on busy times you may have to park a little farther out. On this occasion I had early dinner with family. The drink menu is pretty extensive, mostly because they offer a large variety of beers. BJ's offers there own specialty brews, Today, I had the Tatonka Stout, very dark imperial stout, and a Brewhouse Blonde. Two completely opposite type beers but both are always a favorite when I'm in.  With a full bar and beers on tap and seasonal brews your certainly able to find something to your liking. Food has always been pretty good, I've had the steak before and was great and today I opted for more basic with the Chicken Club Sandwich and that was just as good. Chips and guacamole was a great appetizer as well, with the guacamole being a little spicy kick to it, not hot, just spicy.  The other 3 all enjoyed there food and drinks. At the end we decided to go for the BJ's Famous Pizookie, Chocolate chip and of course no disappointment here with vanilla ice cream in the center of of a warm baked chocolate chip cookie pizza!  I have been to another BJ's location in town and of course its just as on par with this location. I will certainly continue to enjoy my beers and pizookies at BJ's!"
monique w.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,15,17,3.0,3/27/2016,"Food okay, service bad. Baby back ribs dry, Asian chicken salad dry as well and the Asian dressing was off.  Asked the waitress what sides they have, she said look at the menu. I asked her what desserts thr have, she said it's in the dessert menu...nobody sings for your birthday .   The dessert was good though..ice cream on a warm cookie, tiny portion."
Toni L.,"Las Vegas, NV",37,2,1,2.0,10/21/2016,"Unhappy with food. Raw. Asked for another came back same way raw,but no fries this time.  Fries arrived 10 min later. Server may have accidentally  through my food down in front of me.  However  the 805 beer was delicious.  :-("
