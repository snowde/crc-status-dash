Kat B.,"Henderson, NV",444,6,,5.0,5/27/2016,I tried this place for the first time tonight because my roommate said it was great.  Let me tell you she was right ! My server Anthony was a complete doll and on top of his game. Would recommend anyone to try this place out ! The avocado egg rolls are to die for
Christina G.,"Las Vegas, NV",64,106,28,3.0,10/9/2015,Service is OK food selection is good and they have a low calorie menu of under 700 calories. I got the mahi mahi and it was DELICIOUS!  The siracha wings are good too!  We came on a Friday night about 7 and were told a 30 minute wait and were pleasantly surprised when it was only about 10 minutes.
Amanda O.,"North Las Vegas, NV",114,56,5,5.0,7/29/2016,"Great happy hour!! Incredible food! I've been coming here for years and no matter what you're in the mood for,  they have something that will for your fancy. I have yet to taste anything in their menu that wasn't delicious!! (And I've pretty much tasted almost all of it) It's a great place for date night or hanging out with friends. And the waiter Kopy is AWESOME!! And don't forget to save room for a pizookie.. seriously drool worthy. I legit drooled on the table during a first date once.. don't judge me. Lol. Seriously,  just go here.  You'll be so glad you did!!"
Emily W.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,21,3,5.0,10/16/2016,Me and my boyfriend came here on a late Thursday night and we had the best service out of all the locations here! Our waiter and busser were so attentive and helpful when it came to choosing things on the menu. They gave us samples of drinks that we were anxious to try and had great conversation. It's the closest one to my house so I will most definitely always come here!
Seidi O.,"Las Vegas, NV",109,8,5,4.0,12/21/2015,After a long day of work I decided take my family out for dinner. We decided to visit this location because even though there is a BJ's closer to my home this location offers better service. Our servers name was Heather and she ensured we received quality customer service. The restaurant was clean and our food was delivered promptly. I will continue to choose this location over Summerlin's as long as I continue to received outstanding customer service.
Daniel B.,"Las Vegas, NV",73,52,2,2.0,10/26/2014,"I like the selection of beers on tap, it's a huge selection. I had their grilled salmon for dinner. It tasted great.  Unfortunately, after dinner and a couple of beers, I was sick in my bathroom for the next two and a half days.  They got the extra star for the beer selection."
Jenny C.,"Las Vegas, NV",47,20,299,4.0,1/18/2016,"This place has never let me down, everything was prompt, hot and delicious, service was great as soon as we walked through the door & on a busy Sunday too"
Maritess B.,"North Las Vegas, NV",28,8,10,5.0,8/30/2015,"Had the quinoa salmon bowl and because of my garlic allergy our server recommended the lemon butter sauce which was heavenly divine.  Our server Anthony totally went over and beyond as a server: super attentive, provided excellent recommendations plus gave us insider news of a new dinner for two coming up in the next month that ensures we will be coming back again and requesting him as our server.  Ask for anthony for your next visit at this location for superb service!"
Steve B.,"Westside, Las Vegas, NV",0,1,,5.0,3/27/2017,"And again service sucks, but let me get this straight "" the servers are excellent "" it's the management !!!! In their efforts to save money (as demanded by the owners)  they cut common sense service with the thought that they are doing a good job saving money when in fact they are shooting themselves in the foot. Wise up owners, your greed for making money is going to put your business ""out of business""."
Kathi T.,"North Las Vegas, NV",33,22,7,4.0,9/25/2016,"Met some friends and sat at the bar.  Jessica was very friendly and very knowledgeable regarding the wines.  Was slightly dissatisfied with the spinach artichoke dip and chips.  More chips than dip and the dip was hot on the edges and cool in the middle.  I stirred it up and it was OK.  Since it was an appetizer, I thought it would be quick to come out, it wasn't.  I probably won't be ordering this again.  Not a very good appetizer."
Ashley F.,"Las Vegas, NV",143,46,12,4.0,7/12/2016,"This BJ'S satisfies with their wide variety of foods. Everything I've had there has been satisfactory- soup, salad, pizza, burgers, pasta, dessert, even their gluten free items! The cons is that it can get insanely busy and, as a result, service can be so-so."
Katie K.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,34,73,4.0,2/21/2016,"Try a pizzookie! It's a giant cookie or a sampler of medium sized cookies, served with a scoop of ice cream. I love the burgers and pasta. They have a great kid's menu and the gourmet sodas are excellent. I made a reservation for sixteen and they got us seated in a timely manner.  The service was good and the food was excellent."
David C.,"Henderson, NV",0,4,,1.0,3/15/2017,Im usually not one to write reviews but this needed to be said. We arrived at 830 tonight and were sat right away. We waited for over 30 min without anyone stopping by our table to greet us or take drink orders. We decided to leave and as we were leaving the manager and servers were all in the lobby talking and having a good time. Will NEVER return to this location.
Paul B.,"Claremont, CA",304,797,3999,5.0,6/28/2014,"Yelp's 365 Review Challenge 2014 #169 - #365 We were with spending time with our family friends and decided to dine out. We decided on BJ's because my Mom was familiar with the BJ's in California and we always have a good experience. Through the huge swivel door, you're greeted into this urban style restaurant that you'll find any other BJ's franchise. The floorplan is almost the same as the one we return to in California but a little smaller. Food and service was ok and there was nothing to fault on. To sum it up, it was just average and nothing spectacular. If I were to come back, I would just hit the bar for some good craft beer and bar food."
Abby F.,"North Las Vegas, NV",0,5,,4.0,9/7/2016,"I love this place! The clam chowder in the bread bowl is so yummy and of course every time I go, I get a pazookie"
Robert S.,"Canyon Country, CA",69,32,5,1.0,7/20/2016,Not sure what's going on here but the managers need to step it up!!! Brown lettuce on the wedge and the roast beef sandwich was like crap as well. BJs is normally very good but it sucks today. Most likely the B team is working today.
Jean B.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,38,2,2.0,8/7/2016,"Went to bjs the other night and ordered fish n chips to go. Got the fish, no chips. The server was kind and gave a free drink while i was waiting for my order."
Rhonda S.,"Perth, Australia",355,332,1833,3.0,9/4/2013,Ordered a vegetarian small Pizza with goat cheese added. It was just meh. I've been here a couple other times and the salads (esp the ahi tuna) are a lot better than the pizza. I think the wines are slightly overpriced but not too bad.  Service was decent the night we went. The menu is huge and I do like the selection - just not the pizza. Crust was a little burnt an no flavor. Hardly any sauce.
Tami P.,"Las Vegas, NV",8,24,10,5.0,9/4/2016,"We have always had great customer service in this restaurant.  Great food and drinks and great atmosphere!  We were in here tonight and had the best customer service ever.  Our server was ""Little Debbie"". She got our order right, even made some great suggestions.  Fast, and very personable.  Thanks BJ's for standing out from the rest!"
Jeremy G.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,17,1,4.0,9/1/2016,Solid place with a great menu!  I think the chicken tortilla soup is so good!  But there is so many varieties and a nice low-cal menu as well.  Service was great the last time I was there.  Flat bread pizzas are really really good.  I like it here.
