Dale E.,"Las Vegas, NV",14,30,3,1.0,6/13/2016,I am totally disappointed in this restaurant. I will never ever ever ever patronize this business again. Just be quiet OK I ordered curb side pick up a large deep dish pepperoni sausage mushroom pizza. That's exactly what I got no friggin sauce on it. Who makes a pizza without sauce they should stick to other things and leave the pizza making to an Italian place. But I'm also pissed because the girl that came out to bring my pizza told me since it was half off on Monday when you order any large pizza my bill was 12 and some change. She asked me if I would like hot peppers or Parmesan cheese I said no then you would have to go back inside then she says I have to go inside anyway to get your change so I said that's OK she says oh thank you very much and walks in thinking I may keep the change when I met I did not want any hot peppers or Parmesan. This was just a fail all the way around I will never patronize this business again never. The pizza tasted horrible now I'm eating a Stouffers frozen lasagna which tastes way better than that crap I wasted $20 and my time. Hell will freeze over before I go to this business again.
Nina M.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,7,1,1.0,8/29/2016,"I was going to eat here but the manager on duty Monday August 29th around 5:30pm was very rude, very unapproachable, and disregarded me as a person. Not how I wanted to start my evening so I simply am going somewhere else as I advice others to do. If I wanted rude service today I would've gone to Dicks on the strip."
Larry F.,"Las Vegas, NV",3,13,1,5.0,1/4/2017,"Thanks Frank. I appreciate you taking the time to take my call. Glad to see you address problems like this rather than ignoring them. The shift manager did honor the coupon after I pointed out you can't impose restrictions that are not specified on the coupon. By the way, the chicken tenders and the thin cut fries are excellent."
Dustin D.,"Las Vegas, NV",26,1,,2.0,1/22/2017,"I ordered the brewhouse burger with bacon and cheese and im pretty sure the cook got the meat from the grease trap and threw it on two burnt pieces of bread. Meat was inconsistent, burnt chunks with raw pieces and a ton of orange grease that puddled on the plate. Explained to waitress who was very nice, however, after getting it replaced, charged me for the more expensive bacon cheeseburger. And didnt get the replacement till way after my wife was finished eating."
Kelly K.,"Las Vegas, NV",157,114,234,4.0,9/13/2014,"I am a fan of BJ's  for many reasons. First it  is nice to have  an urban  hip brewhouse in the northwest, so it is a great location. Two, I love the menu, it is  very well rounded and appeals  to carnivores, vegetarians,  seafood lovers,  small plate eaters, light plates and gluten free like me! Beer lovers will love the vast choice of on tap beers! Three, they have a great Happy Hour and rewards offers that makes it affordable, and even without  your meal will not  cost you a kidney. Last night  I met a friend at 6pm and the parking lot was full and there were 20 people outside holding the BJ  your  table is ready box. We decided to eat in the bar and found two places. We were greeted quickly and given menus and  checked on right away to see if we wanted to order a drink. Excellent customer service for a bar and restaurant that was busy! Kim was our bartender and  she continued to take care of us for the rest if the night making sure everything went well. She suggested the Happy Hour menu items when she noticed what we ordered!  When our food arrived it was delivered by a server and she arrived promptly to offer extra fixings etc...  She has a following and  took care of  her regulars remembering their preferences! Great service! I tried the gluten free pizza and it was really good. I believe it was made from a rice flour and  not the corn crust that tends to taste like cardboard. I ordered the sausage and  mushroom and it was quite flavorful. It did not have enough sauce and next time I will  request  extra sauce.  My friend ordered the  avocado rolls and  said they were really good,  the right amount of spice, they were crispy on the outside, and were cooked to order. It was very busy and I was surprised that our food arrived no more than 20 minutes later!  I will be back soon!"
Anti-glutite R.,"San Diego, CA",10,49,62,1.0,8/15/2015,"Got to BJ's with a group of 10. We're from out of town and we go to BJ's because of the gluten free menu. We have really good service where we live so we naturally thought lets do this.  We were seated in a timely manner for a party of ten at 1:25pmish. It took the waitress 30 minutes to take our DRINK order and get us drinks. It then took another 15 minutes to come take our order. There were 3 tables where people are sat at different times around us (30 minutes later) and they had their food and left before we even were served our food.  THE SERVICE, THE MANAGER were the WORST. The server avoided our table and another server brought us a water refill no soda refills (guess they want to save money). Anyways, I don't recommend this location. Find a different location."
Shauna R.,"Surprise, AZ",16,13,3,1.0,10/19/2015,"Bad service + bad food = me not coming back  Service- first, we asked for lemon for our waters and the waitress came back twice before bringing it. Second, my husband asked for the wedge fries with his meal and was given the string fries. Third,  she asked if he wanted mustard and he said yes. Didn't actually get it until the burger was already on the table. Finally, she said she'd be bringing us water twice and I'm still waiting.  Food- my chicken tortilla soup had good flavor, but too bad it was only luke warm. My salad had hardly any dressing and the romaine had a few brown spots. My husband's burger and fries were both cold. Not to mention his bacon wasn't cooked. I like my bacon medium, medium rare and I wouldn't have eaten it either. He also asked for a medium burger and it came out well done.  Not a great experience overall."
Eric W.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,5,,5.0,2/4/2017,"Food was fantastic, service was impeccable and the atmosphere is great. Our server James, I believe his name was, gave us amazing service as well as one of the best burgers I have ever had. I had the Brisket Bacon Burger. Will certainly be returning here in the future!"
J R.,"North Las Vegas, NV",4,119,149,3.0,4/3/2016,"Came here for the first time tonight with some friends to try something new.  Arrived about 5 and had a 25-ish min wait, which wasn't to bad considering it looked like everywhere in this area had a line. Hostess at the check in station was very pleasant and polite, as was our server Willis despite the rest of the staff who didn't appear to be the least be pleased to be at work.  Willis was as amazing as the menu selections and the house made root beer.  One of my dinner friends is a total jokester and was on point tonight and Willis played along with the cracks and jokes very well.   On to the food we shared an appetizer of the California flat bread which was very good, the garlic aoli would have been good on anything! Two of us ordered steaks and the other ordered the BBQ brisket burger.  I know people think it is crazy to order a steak well done, but I don't like blood or red coming from anything I eat so I ordered my steak well done.  This was the negative of the night, when my steak was brought to the table there was pink juice on the plate I gave the benefit of the doubt until I cut open the steak and it was MAYBE Medium to Medium Well but definitely NOT done.  Willis appeared with in moments and took my steak back to have it finished to a well done.  Glad I had enjoyed my salad with ranch (also very good but seemed house made as it had a different flavor) and my baked potato from my main course to enjoy until the streak came back.  It came back and was done enough to cut and enjoy, I had to add salt to the steak as it had no flavor other than a lot of char.  I realize cooking a well done steak takes some finesse and know how to not burn the outside but get the inside complete, I just wont order a steak here next time.  The other steak that was ordered did get delivered cooked correctly but he also commented that it lacked seasoning.  The brisket burger was enjoyed along with both types of fries were tried at the table and we all enjoyed them both.  Over all there are quite a few things I wouldn't mind trying here, sure we'll be back at some point when my husband returns home because he enjoys tasting crafted beers. I do with there was no beer cheese soup or pretzel with cheese dip; that's one of my favorite things to try at brew-houses we visit.   Do try the Roo tbeer- AMAZING!!! I really enjoyed the orange creme too!"
Katie R.,"North Las Vegas, NV",0,3,,5.0,1/29/2017,love this place!! Justin hands down is the best server. whenever i go there i always have my girls with me (8 teenage girls total) and we know we're a lot to handle. he was very patient with us and obliged to everything we asked for without complaint! would definitely recommend this place especially for birthday dinners!
Ashley S.,"North Las Vegas, NV",0,9,2,2.0,12/4/2015,"Second time at this location and was completely let down. Took about 20 minutes to get seated which isn't bad for a Friday night. I believe the manager was the one who seated us which made me think the service would be great for the night. Unfortunately our waiter didn't come to the table for a good 10 minutes. He took our drink & appetizer orders and left quickly. When our appetizers were brought to the table it was by a different waiter. We finished our appetizers and even cleaned up and stacked our plates, our original waiter filled our drinks and still never took away the empty plates. When it came to our main course order he didn't even bother writing it down and as expected a dish was forgotten and the kitchen was blamed. Our main course meals were brought out again by a different waiter.  This guy seemed like he didn't even want to be at work tonight. If that's the case, clock out and let someone else tend to the customers.  Food was okay tonight, maybe it was the mood we were put in that ruined it for us."
Dee W.,"Las Vegas, NV",11,7,7,4.0,5/13/2016,"I came with my son on Mother's Day. It was very busy, but we didn't have to wait since it was just the two of us. It was our first time visiting this restaurant. I had the Parmesan crusted chicken. It was just ok. My son had the deep dish pizza. He thought it was good. It just needed a little more sauce. The reason for the four stars is primarily for the exceptional service we received. Our server, Matt was the best  server I've had in a very long time. Efficient, courteous, funny, and all-around amazing. That boy deserves a raise!! I will definitely go back and try something else on the menu. Hope we run into Matt!!"
Susan R.,"Las Vegas, NV",5,4,,5.0,7/16/2016,"The food is always good, the service friendly, and now it is also a Pokestop! Love the healthy menu options for me and the childrens menus are a hit with my family. Excellent location for friends and families to share a meal."
Lesley S.,"Pahrump, NV",23,7,,1.0,7/15/2016,"My first, and last visit to BJ's was earlier this week for my 22 year old daughter's birthday.  Finally when someone came to take our order (about 20 mins.)  As we were looking through the extensive menu, I found dried up food on a page in the menu.  My mom's menu was sticky.  When the server came to the table to take our order that was also a lengthy amount of time.  Once the server started serving the food, it took 20 minutes for everyone to be served.  If we would have waited until each person to be served, our food would have been cold.  The portions to way to small for the amount of money each entree costs.  When we were done I spoke to the manager, Heather, who apologized, but did not other any sort of discount or remedy.  Needless to say my family will not be returning to BJ's after this atrocious after what was supposed to be a celebration."
Yvette H.,"North Las Vegas, NV",160,17,31,4.0,6/30/2015,Love  BJs service was great as well as the food that's why we always go back. My. Husband loves the clam chowder here it's the best in town . Took a little while for the food to come but we enjoyed celebrating my oldest Daughters Birthday. Keep up the great work and food and  we will be back soon.
Anita S.,"Las Vegas, NV",117,11,,1.0,9/2/2016,"We had the most irritating experience here tonight. We will probably never go back. First of all our server took forever to take our order, only to discover that they had given us an old menu and I happened to order something that is no longer on their menu. So we had to figure that all out about 15 minutes after we ordered and they said they would just make something like it. Well it had turkey and bacon, but clearly wasn't the same , but that was better than my husband we ended up getting a chili quest dip for his meal instead of the pale Ale chili he ordered. We didn't want to have to wait forever so he just ate a bit of it  when our server finally came around again, we told him he brought the wrong thing so he offered to take it off our bill. Good since he only ate about 3 bites of it. We then asked to redeem our points to get a pizookie, but because it was taking so long we needed it to go. When the pizookie finally showed up, it was not to go!  They said it would take another 10 minutes or so to get another one to go. We said to forget it and asked to speak to the manager. When the manager showed up, we explained what happened, and she apologized, we asked to get our points back from the pizookie that they. Oils not manage to get done for us. We had now been there just shy of 2 hours. We were on a time schedule and could not nor did we want to wait around any longer. We just wanted our money back for the pizookie . The manager came back a few minutes later and e planned she could not refund that because we used their app to pay our bill!, are you kidding me. We used their app as recommended , and to speed up the process of trying to get out of there and now we got screwed out of a pizookie. It is unbelievable to me the terrible service we had there."
Rosie P.,"North Las Vegas, NV",0,2,,1.0,6/6/2016,"Had the slowest waiter ever.. We were there close to 2 hours.. He took forever to take our order and forever to deliver it.. And when it came out,  it was cold.. Didn't want to send it back bc I knew that would've taken even longer.. Had the Rib eye.. The steak tasted really good and flavorful but I knew it would've tasted better  if it wasn't cold.. Then ordered dessert and that took forever as well.. I'm not sure if Pizookie and monkey bread  are meant to be cold or not? But they were cold and hard.. I've eaten here before and never had any issues.. I noticed all the servers tables waited forever for there food to come out and the people behind me sent there food back because it was cold.. Can't remember servers name? Wish I wrote it down.. He was a white male , bald head and wore glasses.."
Ed R.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,7,,1.0,7/5/2016,"If I could give a minus rating I would.  This is the second bad experience at this place and my last.  Three of us arrived at 7:15 we were seated at 7:20 and waited on immediately.  A salad, fish N chips, and chicken tacos.  At 7:55 still no food so we left.  I stopped at the front explained why we were leaving and I left $6 for an iced tea and a lemonade.  They could have cared less, but not a surprise since my last experience.  We went to Red Robin around the corner and let hostess and manager know of our experience with their competition.  It was obvious that they could care less but I will make sure to write a review in the UNLV paper.  Hell will freeze over before i step foot in another BJ's or recommend to anyone. This BJ's and management is a joke and I let corporate know to."
Joel J.,"Las Vegas, NV",2081,203,143,4.0,7/7/2015,"Upscale bar and eatery, great burgers, fries, bar specials and a great bar selection.  Football games, gatherings, sunday after church, it all works.   Business meetings work here...drinking works here, you get the picture.!"
Selina W.,"Las Vegas, NV",248,12,1,1.0,6/1/2016,I really do love this place..but now I'm pretty disappointed . I had a take out order for a honey crispy salad and I asked for various things to be added to it and I didn't receive anything  .i called a few days after and talking to someone that took down my name and number and then said they would give me some type of information that will let me redeem my salad .. Anyways when I was ready to Come get it because I live so far from this location   Come to find out I didn't talk to a manager because no one remembers or wrote down my information for the general manager . Then after talking to the manager frank he was suppose to give me a call back . I didn't receive any call . I called the following days after untill I reached him again and he blamed the system being down and my information was lost ... But I gave my name and number out to another employee the day before . It just doesn't make any sense and I'm pretty much giving up . I just won't be going to this location anymore .
