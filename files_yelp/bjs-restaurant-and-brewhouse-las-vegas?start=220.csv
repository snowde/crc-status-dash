Mckenzie T.,"Las Vegas, NV",76,36,25,5.0,2/23/2016,My husband and I came in for lunch. We had the avocado egg rolls and burgers! The food is always outstanding!Our server Babette was very polite and attentive!
William O.,"Long Beach, CA",0,39,,1.0,8/19/2016,"The service was atrocious.  I can only say two good things about my experience here.  1. The Resturant was clean. 2. The waiter was nice.  Having said that, he brought me an order with shrimp, when I ordered salmon.  When I pointed out the error (respectfully and nicely), I waited 10 minutes for him to return to the table, so everyone was well into their meal),he sent it back and said it would be out in 5 minutes.  It arrived in 15 minutes.  By then everyone at my table Had about finished their meal.  I asked for a box, and a setup, (still no fork), and it took another 5 minutes.  By then, I was hungry, fed up with the poor service, and VERY disappointed that I had not eaten.  The waiter was profusely apologetic, and had a nice demeanor, but he simply did not get the job done.   He took it off my bill. I returned home at 10 pm, which is a little late to eat and avoid a night of heartburn.  I threw out the warm lettuce and hoped the salmon might taste good the next morning in an omelette or such.  This chain needs to either train their staff better or hire more staff to get the Friday night crowd handled efficiently.  Just get the job done right the first time! I realize mistakes happen, but this was just a case of carelessness and not taking proper care of the customer.  No excuses, just own up and take corrective measures, or lose customers..your choice."
Kayte F.,"Centennial, Las Vegas, NV",386,27,30,4.0,10/27/2014,"BJ's my go to spot! I live so close by it it's perfect, they do get pretty busy at this location especially on game days the wait would always be 30 minutes longer if you have a larger group but that's understandable!  The pumpkin spice pizookie is to die for! I love it, not a big fun of pumpkin but the pizookie was so good I wish it wasn't for limited time only!!"
Sofia G.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,8,,4.0,1/9/2016,"Went for a night out with my girls last night and man was it busy! We called ahead to put our name on the list but still waited 30 min! (I suggest you call ahead unless you want to wait an hour on a Friday night). when we sat down we had a great server named Jace, and the clam chowder bread bowl I had was awesome! We will be coming back for more girls nights"
Jen K.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,14,,3.0,10/16/2015,"Decent food, but they are soooo god-awful slow! Expect 1.5 hours on a weekend evening. It could be our particular server, but it's slow about 50% of the time."
James K.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,14,1,5.0,4/9/2016,"The staff is always nice, day and night ....food great never had a bad meal ....love to come here after work and decompress ...."
Raven-Joie R.,"Las Vegas, NV",463,291,157,4.0,4/4/2013,"during the lunch hours, they are fast and have great service. I always go to order off the lunch menu because I'm broke!  I usually order that parm crusted chicken sandwich, which is delicious. Their gourmet Mac and cheese and stuffed mushrooms are great cheap appetizers--I'm always hunting on the cheapest thing on the menu!  But if you want to spend a little money on the appetizer, I suggest the Ahi Poke. It's one of my favorites. They never ask to split the check, even if I'm in huge groups, which is why I took off a star."
Jacalina B.,"North Las Vegas, NV",12,4,5,1.0,8/3/2016,"This is the second time this year that I went here and both times were horrible.  The wait for the food was long above all days, yesterday was my birthday.  Our appetizers were served cold and I witnessed a server chatting with a couple practically the entire time I was sitting at my table.  I asked the employee who served the appetizers for plates.  He got 2 plates and said he would get another plate in the kitchen and never returned.  There was 3 of us.  Some of the items we requested were not available.  My son ordered a burger which comes with fries but the fries wasn't served with it.  He ate half of his burger and I asked the server, can you check on his fries because he is almost done eating.  The server was surprised and went to the kitchen to check on it.   15 minutes pass, still no fries.  I asked another employee again to check on it. Finally, it was served and my son was already done with his burger and he didn't want to eat it.  My son asked for a box to a waiter that was walking by, my son asked, ""Excuse me sir, may I have a box?"". He looked at my son and continued walking without acknowledging my son's request! I really cannot recommend this place and everyone I spoke with had a BAD experience at this particular restaurant. Oh and the restaurant was not even busy!!!"
Jeri M.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,4,,5.0,4/4/2016,"We come to BJ's probability once or twice a week, sometimes more!!  The staff is great and the food is delicious. Last week I lost my wallet there but the manager found it and put it in the safe.  Everything was still in it when I picked it up. Honesty and integrity come with the service!!  Five stars and two thumbs up for BJ's!!"
Elihu Q.,"Downtown, Las Vegas, NV",3,10,9,4.0,2/28/2015,First time I came here and it was great... Deb our server was the best... She knew a lot about the menu and the varieties of draft beers... She made a great recommendation for me... The food was great big portions at decent prices... Will definitely come here again real soon...
Paul S.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,9,4,4.0,5/24/2015,"Very clean establishment. Friendly staff Take out service is excellent. Only stopped in for a few beers while waiting for a Togo pickup  Nice to see the variety of beers even by the bottle. Found gulden Draak and Chimay blue! Friendly staff and quick service.  Food was delicious, not over the top but a darn good veggie jalapeño burger with some amazing fries"
Chelle B.,"Grand Junction, CO",5,1,,4.0,1/14/2016,"I've been to this restaurant a handful of times and every visit is awesome. Their bbq wings are THE best wings that I've had....way better than BWW. Servers are always polite. A little slow service one night I went in for some drinks but other than that, no complaints. Definitely will be back a lot."
Brian L.,"Las Vegas, NV",3,79,7,1.0,7/26/2015,"Well, this place seemed to have gone downhill at a rapid pace. We come here occasionally since living here, and it is not what it use to be.  Today's experience alone was enough. We come in for Sunday lunch, and we wait a few minutes to be seated. The hostess apparently doesn't hand out silverware when they pass out the menus, so after we ordered our entire meal, all at once after our server was finally able to make it over, and I get a salad, I guess the expected me to show them how I eat at Medieval Times, because it took a few more minutes to get some. Then our kids pizza comes out, and the server warns us that the plate is extremely hot (from the heat lamps I am assuming). WHO THE F^€# is going to put a scolding hot plate in front of a toddler to eat off of. Maybe they should have just handed him a steak knife and some fireworks to go along with his meal. Then our meal comes out, and my pulled pork sandwich came out cold. Seriously?!?! So that was sent back, but right before that, our drinks from the bar that were ordered when we placed everything finally come in, and it was only a tap beer and a flavored iced tea. I watched a lot of the servers come and go from the bar pickup, and not a single server chose to help out our server by bringing out two drinks while they grabbed their table's drinks. Then the manager came out with a stone face and brought me my reheated sandwich and simply asked ""is that better?"". Didn't ask anything else or really talk at much.  I didn't even bother talking to the manager about this, since he left his bag of F^€#s at home. Despite all of this, our server was real nice and she was doing the best that she could, but it didn't help that none of the servers seemed to work with each other, and that is the manager's fault!!  If a manager or higher happens to read this and would like to reach out on here, go ahead, but I will most likely not be returning to this certain establishment."
Anthony P.,"North Las Vegas, NV",0,6,1,5.0,5/23/2015,"Great food, great service, great prices, great environment! Rhonda was our waitress and provided great service! The wife and I split a full rack of ribs, 2 bowls of clam chowder, 2 soft drinks for $30.  This was my first visit. I'm very picky about restaurants and have no complaints. I will go again!"
Jessica A.,"Los Angeles, CA",16,55,54,3.0,12/13/2014,"The food is pretty good but the service at this location is a bit off. My grandma purchased gift cards for the holidays and it took a good 20 minutes for the transaction. Apparently the computer had a glitch. That's fine.  We were patient and understood that things happen. With the purchase of $100 you are suppose to receive 4 souvenir beer glasses and a 20% off VIP card. My grandma received the glasses but not the VIP card. So, I hop back in line and the cashiers at the to go section (where you purchase gift cards) were too flustered to even acknowledge their customers. After about 15 min someone finally acknowledges me. They did give me the 20% gift card but then proceeded to explain that it may not work properly because the VIP card was not rung up with a transaction. Know what am I suppose to do with that?! The manager gave me his card and said if I have issues to show his card. The only problem is that my grandma lives 30 min away and barely goes to this BJ's.  Now, on to the food. I ordered the Cajun pasta. It was ok. NOTHING like the Cajun pasta that Cheesecake Factory has. I also had the broccoli cheddar soup. Now, that was GOOD. Looks like I gotta just stick to pizzas, beers, and pizookies when I'm eating at BJ's."
Lostin S.,"North Las Vegas, NV",11,171,13,2.0,1/8/2016,"This place has gone downhill.  I liked about half the food.  They changed the recipes and removed some of my favorites.  Our last visit we experienced slow service although friendly.  I'd give the server 9/10 for trying, but the kitchen seemed to be slow or something.  The fried food was especially greasy the other day when I was there.  Every other time the place had really good food.  The portion sizes have also shrank.  I'll give them another shot in the future."
Rachelle B.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,26,4,1.0,9/27/2015,"The food took almost thirty minutes, in spite of us being one of only a handful of people eating at the time.  When it did arrive, it was soggy, the fries were completely cold and after taking a few bites of my chicken wondering why it was so chewy, I saw that the middle was pink.  Needless, to say we both stopped eating at that point and told the waiter after which he disappeared before we could get the check.  We waited again and only after the manager made his way over did we actually get the check.  I love BJ's but this location disappoints on all levels."
Tony C.,"Las Vegas, NV",12,17,3,1.0,1/21/2016,"If you like crappy service than BJs is for you! We waited to be seated, then when we finally were seated no one came to our table. We waited 15 more minutes before just walking out. No one came by to greet us, no menus dropped off for us, nothing."
Mark L.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,2,,2.0,2/10/2016,"Used to be our favorite place, but the service has gone completely downhill. Slow and inattentive. Hate to say it, but we might find a new spot."
Erika N.,"Salt Lake City, UT",0,13,,2.0,1/27/2015,"Just no.  I've tried the salads, pizza, hamburgers... The only thing that miiiight be worth it is the salmon. But other than that... Just don't. It's not worth it."
