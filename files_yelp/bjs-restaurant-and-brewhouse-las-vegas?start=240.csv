Sharon W.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,2,,2.0,10/15/2015,"We used to love this place but everything has taken a turn for the worse, from the food to the service, even management is lacking. Hopefully they fix things and start taking pride in their product and service again."
Chris A.,"Las Vegas, NV",851,405,1336,4.0,9/11/2013,"Finally got around to going to this BJ's close to my neck of the woods.  Would always pass by it on Centennial and see it was near constantly busy with cars.  Whaddaya know, we like it! Nice building, very reminiscent of the one on Charleston (my guess is that's the point).  Lots of dark wood, intimate lighting in some parts, lots of room at the bar with multiple TV's.  Nice flooring and high ceilings too.  I like the rotating door at the front entrance, good touch.   The night we came it was on a weekend so it was busy at a nice clip.  We didn't have to wait long for a table though, maybe about 5 minutes.  Aisles are pretty spacious so I had no problem getting to my seat. Our server was courteous and well-mannered, took care of us really well.  Even if we weren't first-timers to BJ's he still gave us a nice review of the menu and the specialty types of pizzas they create.  Informative, nice. We've been to BJ's before so we had a good idea of what we were ordering.  There were four of us in our party and we got: *Piranha Pale Ale Nachos - Topped with BJ's Pale Ale Chili, jack and cheddar cheese, tomatoes, green onions, olives, cilantro, and sour cream.  With a side of fire-roasted salsa and extra jalapenos. *BJ's Favorite Signature Deep Dish Pizza (Large 14"") - Meatballs, pepperoni, Italian sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, olives, onion, and tomatoes. *Baby Back Pork Ribs - Flavored with Big Poppa Smokers' Sweet Money Championship Rub, topped with BJ's Jeremiah Red Ale BBQ sauce, and served with two steak sides of your choice (we opted for steamed veggies and the Wedge Salad). Luckily on this day we had a coupon from Facebook where you buy an entree and get another entree of equal or lesser value FREE.  We bought the pizza and got the ribs gratis!  Not a bad deal at all.  Especially considering a large pizza will set you back between $20 - $25 depending on what kind of pizza you order. The food?  Not bad!  Definitely reminds you of a Cheesecake Factory type joint.  The nachos were good, lots of cheese everywhere, and that fire-roasted salsa had some great flavor.  The pizza was good, definitely fits up to being a signature of BJ's.  The crust was thick but still light and airy.  Nice crunch on the outside with a good chew on the inside.  Loaded with good toppings.  After two slices I was done!  Definitely not a NY pie (which I kinda prefer).  The wedge salad was excellent, and would only be that way IF you have a head of very, very fresh Iceberg lettuce.  Topped with creamy bleu cheese dressing, bacon bits, and fresh black pepper, it was a good accompaniment.  The surprise of the night was the pork ribs!  Someone did it right - enough smoke, generous rub, enough sauce (with extra on the side), cooked just right to near-fall-off-the-bone, I couldn't get enough!  I finished half the rack myself.   With that coupon our meal was a near steal.  For the four of us, we managed to get away with an under $50 check (with tax & tip), and leftovers for a midnight snack.  I like a value meal! We were too full, but one should try and get a BJ's Famous Pizookie.  A warm deep dish cookie, topped with two scoops of cool, creamy ice cream?  Yeah you're gonna want one. I'll be back again BJ's, I'll have to try your Happy Hour that goes from 3 PM - 7 PM M-F, or 10 PM - Close Sun-Thur.  That looks like some good eats for cheap!"
Norma C.,"North Las Vegas, NV",116,103,186,4.0,11/14/2014,"Their berry cider is delicious, it is very sweet so I highly recommend it for the ladies, but as well they do brew their own beer, and have a large selection of liquor, so very accommodating for both men and women. There are quite a few tv's all around so it's good to come for a game. I thought all the bartenders and servers were very nice and helpful."
Teresa B.,"North Las Vegas, NV",36,24,6,4.0,9/25/2015,They have a good tuna poke appetizer and the turkey burger is awesome. The service is always good. Prices are reasonable and the beers are exceptional. The pazookies are definitely worth a try. They have a trio that you can pick three different types for. It makes everyone in the family happy to get to choose their own dessert.
Alisha R.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,47,3,3.0,7/17/2016,It was ok at best. My husband and I have been there before and I should have just ordered a pizza because I know they are pretty delicious. We went with some friends and the 4 of us where sat by by a group of 20-25 people. Nothing a restaurant can do with loud groups but it would have been nice if they had made an effort to not cram a bunch of tables around a large party. Our friends and i felt like we had to yell and kept getting bumped into by the large party. Our server wasn't very attentive however there was a good runner you made sure we had refills. Back to the food...I ordered a burger which was ok. My problem is that the burger came out 10min after everyone else's food had hit the table. Server didn't come by to check if all food was ok. By the time I got my burger it was luke warm at best and my fries were cold. Knowing it was busy I ate what I could. Our server never came back to our table so as he was walking by I had to ask him for out check. He proceeded to go take another tables order ring that in and bring another table some drinks and then give us our check. I don't know if I'll be back maybe just order a pizza for take to avoid the mess of the restaurant.
Holly O.,"Las Vegas, NV",10,6,,3.0,1/13/2016,"Great mobile app with nice reward program. Make reservations, dine-in pre-order, carry out and curbside, and group order option. Dining in, the experience and atmosphere is great. I've ordered take-out/curbside several times, and not once was the order correct. After a few bad orders, I was provided a $20 Gift Card to return. I used it for carry out, and that order was the worst I'd gotten. After another failed attempt, I have not gone that route again. Diverse, delicious menu for all tastes including kids, nice bar with great options and TVs for sports fans. I can recommend the dining experience in-house, but carry out is a gamble..."
Angela S.,"Carle Place, NY",0,6,,2.0,8/29/2016,Took forever just to take our drink orders. Table was dirty and the waiter had attitude when I asked for it to be cleaned. Took an hour for the food to come. The deep dish had little to no cheese. Garlic bread was forgotten with another dish. One of the managers on duty had no recover skills. Fix the issue don't keep apologizing for it. Tried to give this place another chance after the last time I went. They failed again.
Luis B.,"North Las Vegas, NV",81,8,1,2.0,2/26/2016,"Same as Chilli's, but now that I think about it, I prefer Chilli's. New Jalapeño Cucumber Margarita was awful too much Minute Maid lemonade and the Mojito, the same; bartender didn't know how to make those drinks. Santa Fe salad, iaaawwkk! :( The chocolate chip cookie with ice cream didn't have good presentation and the cookie was very thin that it was stick to the metal plate in were it was served.  First & last time.."
Carmen E.,"Las Vegas, NV",20,4,7,5.0,8/27/2016,"Had an amazing lunch , our waitress DEBBIE was amazing and courteous, would recommend everyone to come have a beer and hang out. I had the bacon avocado and tomato sandwich, it was fantastic!!"
L G.,"Seligman, AZ",0,4,,4.0,5/12/2016,"I posted a comment on BJ's at Centennial Center in Las Vegas, NV on 5/10/16 in reference to our visit on 5/9/16 (Mothers Day).  Today I got a phone call from the manager, apologizing for the experience my family had.  He stated that the incident was not there norm, and things were not handled right at the time.  He has made note of what has happen and also stated that he wants customers to have a good experience and leave with with a smile on there face.  He was very interested in what happen and I felt that he would take action to make this not a repeat occurrence. I was very pleased with his phone call and comments."
Carolyn H.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,26,66,3.0,8/25/2015,Happy hour 3-7 good time to go before the crowd is 3-4 pm . Good appetizer & drinks . Tried the roast beef dip it's average. Chicken lettuce cups are great. Good service in the bar seating area.
Greg H.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,2,1,4.0,3/27/2015,Great burgers and great beers. I have gone a few times and the food is always good. Love the choices of home brewed beers. The service isn't the best. Each time the server seemed uninterested in serving us. The time to get the food is always slow also. If you don't care how long it takes to get food this is a good spot. Wouldn't recommend to anyone on any sort of time crunch or busy schedule.
Hope S.,"Minot, ND",3,31,12,5.0,7/18/2015,"I always love coming here, especially for the pazookies! Our server Anthony was really nice and catered to our needs well. I'll definitely be back!"
Rene M.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,65,332,1.0,6/11/2014,"We went to BJ's every once in a while because it was close and the food was decent.  However recently service quality has seriously slipped. The waitress was cocky (not in a funny way - rather in an obnoxious way).  The beer took forever. I mean they have beer on tap why does it take like 20 minutes to get one even though the store was barely half-full?  The food is ok, but not great. A little overpriced too.  Probably not going here again any time soon. They need to up their game."
Nicolette H.,"Las Vegas, NV",356,184,46,3.0,5/24/2014,"This place is always popping in the Centennial area, but it's really because people are too lazy to drive further out and come here cause it's close to their suburbia utopia, not because of food quality. The service here is always nice and I never have trouble with them, though the pricing here is not equal to the food quality. Even the beers are just ""meh"". That Strawberry Splash though is the business, can't complain about that. Majority of the time, the pizzas are overcooked and the sandwiches are slapped together with the blandest ingredients cheap budget can buy. Most of the time I'm here I just get some sort of pasta, you can't really fuck up noodles."
Spencer S.,"North Las Vegas, NV",4,30,22,4.0,12/13/2015,Went back to BJ's today for lunch and received excellent service. Food and staff was great. Just as I gave a negative review regarding my first visit I wanted to follow up on my second visit which is only fair.
Stacey G.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,6,,2.0,2/13/2016,Horrible service every time. One time they brought cold food out. I just tried ordering take Out and they hung up on me twice and then placed me on an indefinite hold. I hope the location gets it together. The one in Summerlin is always good.
Nickie J.,"Las Vegas, NV",13,29,25,2.0,6/11/2015,"First let me start off with the positives, the cookie ice cream thing was delish. Their soup was amazing as well, had two pieces of chicken but was still good ( chicken tortilla soup) Which is the only reason I am giving this place two stars.  This was my first time here and I had heard about the service prior to going but kept an open mind. I feel bad cause our poor waitress was either new or just having a really bad day! I was fine with how extremely slow the service was until I started seeing tables that came after us (group of 4) started getting their appetizers before we even got our salads. So I started to get increasingly annoyed by this point. After 45 min we finally asked where our salads were. Which came about 5 min after that. So 50 min just to get our salad. So then our food arrives about another 15-20 after that. Omg the pizza was terrible. It was so dried out that it didn't even look like they put cheese on it. 18 bucks for a dried out 8 inch pizza with pepperoni and olives. OUCH. 85 bucks for the 4 of us and 2 hours later we could finally leave! I don't think I will ever go back here. For some reason it seems to be a trendy place to go but the food and service suck. So if you want to go there to be ""cool"" by all means go. But don't be in a rush and don't expect  your food to measure up to the price you pay for it!"
Shaun B.,"Henderson, NV",2,22,,1.0,5/15/2014,"I have to say we had the worst experience ever , we had a party of 12 go to dinner last night for my birthday and my friends birthday , we arrived and were sat at 745 pm and we did not get to eat until 9:00 ..  Our server was nice and tried to do a great job , but the MANAGEMENT sucks , she was clearly over sat in her area and they came and stood by our table and watched then walked away.  Half of our group is in the food and beverage industry and they even felt as though management did not do there job ..  All I can say is thanks for ruining my birthday dinner , I use to love eating and drinking at your restaurant but I will never recommend or eat at your restaurant again , and I will complain all the way up through your organization ."
Kirk V.,"North Las Vegas, NV",0,36,2,2.0,2/10/2016,I was looking at yelp at the BJ's restaurant and saw that they had a appetizer special free appetizer with purchase I clicked on it and it was only for Tuesdays and Friday well today was Wednesday so that sucks that's why give it a bad review so there next time make it every day free appetizer with purchase day. I got home and unfortunately the pizza was cold. They also forgot to include a spoon with the soup we had six Forks but where was the spoon really we ordered soup you don't put a spoon in ? When I called the Mgr he was very cool about things and after apologizing he said he would send me a gift card. I'll post whether I get it or not.
