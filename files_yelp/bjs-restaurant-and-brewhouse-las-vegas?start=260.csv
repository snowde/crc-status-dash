Roberta S.,"Las Vegas, NV",4,98,4,3.0,11/29/2015,"The last time I reviewed BJ's it was for lunch but this time we went for dinner and it was also great.  We went with friends and all of us had a hard time choosing from their extensive menu.  I had the flatbread margarita pizza and really enjoyed it.  My husband had the parmesan chicken which he said was good.  He also had a cup of their clam chowder which he loves.  Our friends had the deep dish ziti and sriracha chicken/bacon mac and cheese and they both enjoyed their dinners.  Our server, Anthony was one of the best waiters we have had in a long time.  Ask for him.  We had a coupon for $10 off our meal so the price was right."
Cha L.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,4,1,1.0,1/8/2016,"NEVER AGAIN !! We've enjoyed our dining experiences in this location before, it was the place for my family and I to enjoy family time, but our last visit really left a bad impression on us.  They had a 20% off promotion if you order ahead on their app for dine in. So my family and I ordered on the B.J. app an hour before we arrived(we even called half an hour before arriving to make sure they got our orders). Once we were seated, no one served us. No drinks. No plates. Not once had our waitress stopped at our table. We were even ignored whenever we tried to call for any waiter walking by.  A huge group was seated right next to us 15 mins later and they were able to get their drinks before we did, and we were there before them AND ordered ahead an hour before we arrived! Ten minutes after, we were so close to walking out when our appetizer finally arrived, the waiter just placed it there and walked away immediately. At least they didn't fully forget about us. But, with no plates and no service, my family of 6 huddled around that one plate of appetizer to eat. It was horrible. I truly considered using the table or napkin as a plate. I lost track of time after that because it didn't really matter at that point, but we finished picking off our appetizer and we were all thirsty and irritated(still no drinks) when my dad got fed up and tried to get the waitress' attention in front of him. She looked him in the eyes and continued to walk away from us. After trying to get any waiters' attention, he stood up and walked to one of the managers, himself.  Apparently no one knew how to deal with dine ins with online orders so they all ignored us. Why promote something your own workers are not trained to deal with? The manager tried to help out after that and even assigned us our own waiter to make up for the lack of service, which I appreciated his effort, but at that point we just wanted to finish eating so we can get out of there ASAP. Still thinking about it leaves me in a bad mood. Worst. Experience. Ever."
Andrea R.,"Sacramento, CA",173,74,329,4.0,9/6/2012,"Who doesn't like BJ's? Their diverse menu offers something for everyone!  If your a pizza lover, their Chicago style pizza is a must!  The crust is thick and flavorful!  My 2 favorite specialty pizzas they offer are The Great White and the BBQ Chicken Pizza.  If you order a large, it's great for sharing with a small group of people.  If you can't decide on which pizza to order, get half of one thing and half of something else!  Yes, they will do that at no extra charge! Their alcoholic drinks are all very tasty, but for those who aren't big on alcoholic drinks , give the root beer a try!  They make the root beer there and you'll definitely be requesting a refill.    If you're a sweets person like myself, you have to get a pizookie to end your meal!  My personal favorite is the Oreo.  A pizookie is the most delicious, moist, flavorful cookie served warm with vanilla ice cram on top!"
Sam G.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,16,,3.0,1/2/2016,Went to this place for Christmas dinner with staff. The waiter was messing up all the order placed after a long wait time. Desert with cookies and ice cream was good Will not go again with larger group
Josh K.,"North Las Vegas, NV",73,6,,5.0,11/11/2015,"Love this place! The food is always good and the service is great! (If at all possible, ask for Anthony as your server. He's absolutely amazing, extremely nice and his hospitality is second to none.) The beer is great and you have to get a pazooki! Great family place and always a good go to spot!"
Molly C.,"Las Vegas, NV",22,11,8,4.0,7/30/2014,"Decided to have an early family lunch today at BJ's and they were great. We arrived around 11:30 a.m. right after the doors opened pretty much, and were seated within about 10 minutes.  From the moment we walked in the atmosphere was pleasant and warm with friendly smiles from the hostess at the front desk.  My husband and I both ordered a club sandwich (toasted sourdough bread with Swiss cheese, bacon, ham, and turkey) accompanied by a delicious salad. This was off of the Enlightened menu which provides delicious and healthy choices for all under a certain amount of calories (I think it was 700).  Our waitress was sweet and our food was on the table in roughly 15-20 minutes.  When we left we were all talking about how delicious the mozzarella sticks were! These were by far the best I have ever tasted!  Thank you BJ's for a pleasant lunch today! You are definitely doing something right because the flow of people coming in as soon as the doors opened is proof. Molly Cooper"
Alyssa L.,"Woodbridge, VA",48,107,23,2.0,7/26/2015,"I've enjoyed eating here a handful of times and the food has always been good and service has been average. Today though everything was horrible. It wasn't necessarily the servers fault as it appeared she was spread a little thin, but when that busy standing around chit chatting with others didn't help.  It took sitting there 10 minutes at least before we could place a drink order and by then we had our orders ready to go as well. My husband's salad came quick enough and then 15 mins after ordering my toddler's pizza came. We were informed the plate was hot, so obviously I took to avoid my 2 yr old getting burned. Why put a child's pizza on a hot plate and then continue to bring it out still has me a little baffled, but I guess that's acceptable to them. It's about 20 minutes after placing our orders and we still don't have our drinks (we didn't order anything fancy, just a beer and ice tea) and eventually  I am able to get the servers attention to ask where they are. We actually ended up getting our food before the drinks. As for the food my husband's food had to me immediately returned as his pulled pork sandwich was so cold I thought for a second it must have been pulled from the refrigerator. My chicken Caesar salad was ok, but definitely nothing impressive. I could have saved myself 5 dollars and gotten one down the street at Rachel's. Waiting to pay ended up being a joke as well. My husband and son actually ended up getting up and going outside as I sat there for a good 15 minutes. I must have looked annoyed because the other server in the area actually giggled when she saw my face. It took the manager walking past me almost twice before he offered to take the check and ring it up. From now on my family will be venturing farther from home to find another BJ's location."
Greta F.,"North Las Vegas, NV",0,5,,1.0,7/14/2015,"I normally love BJ's, but had a bad experience at this particular location.  Husband and I walked in last Saturday afternoon around 2:30 pm for lunch.  The restaurant was not even 30% full, and the idiot hostess tells us it will be 10-15 minutes for a table to be cleaned off.  There were THREE girls ""working"" standing around the hostess doing nothing.   We called her on it, and the hostess proceeded to make all these excuses why it takes 10-15 minutes to clean a table!  Of course we walked out.   OMG!!"
Noel M.,"Las Vegas, NV",102,21,,2.0,6/9/2014,"Ive been to BJ's dozens of times and typically have always had a good experience until yesterday. The service has always been good and there is definitely no issue there. I went to this location on Sunday with my parents and my mom and I both ordered the sirloin steak - medium. Ive ordered this plenty of times before and its always been good... not Outback good, but definitely decent. Yesterday's came out like it had been cremated. The char was so thick it couldn't be cut off. My steak was grey with no pink and charred. My moms was the charred on the outside and bleeding in the middle. I sent mine back and my mom thought she could salvage hers. The waiter was awesome, service was great. Manager came out and apologized and I told him that I wanted it just like the picture, no char. What did I get.... the same amount of char and a pink middle. Took one bite and there was no other taste than the char. Literally, all you could taste was the burnt meat. Sent it back again and the manager came out again. I was informed that two weeks ago all the steaks had changed and this is the way they are doing them now. Why I am writing this post... just to let others know about the change, since BJ's didn't feel the need to change its images on the menu and didn't mention it to us when we ordered. So, long story short, ordered the steak, sent it back twice. Decided to not even try and go with the Chicken Pot Stickers. They rocked. By the time I got my food, everyone at the table was of course finished with their meals. I was a little surprised that after all that, the manager didn't ever offer to comp anything. I don't mind paying for what we ate and its not an issue that we were charged, but I was just a bit surprised it wasn't even offered. I didn't ask, but left disappointed in the whole experience. Will we go again? Yeah, probably for Happy Hour and stick to the appetizers. But not going to go expecting a good meal."
Nikki T.,"Virginia Beach, VA",1,14,2,2.0,7/24/2015,"As much as i love to dine here not tht sanitary although typically ive always gone to bj's in san diego. This particular bj's really needs to get it together. There booth chairs had crumbs all over it. The menu had dried up old food. Lastly the bathroom, the first 3 stalls had no tissue. Smh. Come on i could hve gobe to jack in the box for this or any fast food for tht matter!!!"

Michael A.,"Santa Maria, CA",21,31,1,5.0,9/16/2015,Just had dinner here tonight. Was welcomed as soon as we walked in and seated right away. I ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger and it was so good! Rodrigo was our waiter and he was awesome. Recommended the pazookie after our meal because I had never been here before and we HAD to try it. Everything was great! Will definitely be coming back here to try the amazing selection of beers.
Nichole J.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,16,,5.0,7/15/2016,Amazing restaurant! My husband & I come here often & we are never disappointed. We love all the food we have tried. The staff is very friendly & enthusiastic! Definitely going to continue to come again & again!
Molly M.,"Fair Oaks, CA",0,12,,5.0,7/8/2016,"Very happy with our food and even more impressed with our service. We had a party of 70 and our wait staff was excellent! - particularly our server - Airica. Very attentive and all the servers work together as a team for a great experience.  This is our second year in a row with a large group like this, and second very positive experience."
G R.,"Henderson, NV",5,41,66,4.0,4/3/2016,We were greeted right away when we sat down! The pizzas took a while to come out but they were good. Our server was very attentive even though she was really busy. Also you have to try the pazooki sampler ... The pazooki are def the number one reason I come here
Barbara D.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,6,,1.0,7/8/2016,"We had visited BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse, Centennial Center Blvd,location, a few months ago where were received the worst service.  We so unhappy with this location at the time that we did not think we would ever go back.  A few days ago we were in the area and decided we would give them another chance.  We sat in the bar area thinking it would be faster service, since the time before was so slow.  This was around 3 pm. We were seated and waited and waited and waited for a server. The bar area was not filled or busy nor was the bar itself. Finally a waiter asked if our waitress had come by to help us.  Of course we said no.  He apologized and took our order.  We order our beverages, my ice tea came pretty fast, however the bar tender did not have the beer we order ready for the waiter to pick up, (There were three people that were behind the bar) He came back apologized again and asked if we would like a water until the beer ready. It was at almost ten minutes from the time the beer was ordered until the waiter brought it to us.  Apologized again.  The waitress finally did come by while we were waiting for our food to arrive to take our order.  I would like to give the server that took care of us an Ata Boy, Brian, He was the one that noticed we had not been help. He apologized and took our order and served us. Actually he was the only one I saw working and taking care of the patrons that were there,  He was so kind, he even told us the other server apologized.  We have always had great service at the BJ's on West Charleston Blvd.  After having this experience we will not return to location. Thank you Brian again for your help and kindness."
Jack S.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,7,,5.0,12/28/2015,"we got there and the place looked good, we were seated right away. we had the most amazing waitress! Heather last name started with H.  she knew the menu well and answered all my husband's dumb questions with polite patience. she  kept us entertained during courses and made sure we had everything. spectacular service even though she had alot of tables and was treating them the same from what we could see. we will be back to this location because of her. we would recommended our friends to go see Heather. thanks"
Toya G.,"Las Vegas, NV",60,9,,1.0,1/22/2016,"So I wanted to give BJ's another chance like I said I love the place.  This time, I ordered curbside.  I got home as I had ordered the cherry chipotle glazed salmon.  There was no asparagus inside my to go plate and no chipotle glaze in the couscous.  It was freezing cold so of course I was not going back at night to have them fix my order.  I am just disappointed to have to take one of my favorite local spots off of our regular dining."
Brittany H.,"Las Vegas, NV",129,3,,5.0,1/20/2016,"The bartender, Kim, is amazing! Great service, had a full bar and never once did we feel rushed! However they are training their staff is on point. Not to mention the food is amazing."
Jodi M.,"Praha 2, Prague, Czech Republic",12,65,2,5.0,6/7/2015,"Tasty beer, diverse menu, and pretty decent happy hour at the bar. I'm not usually a fan of mid-priced chain restaurants, but I've never had a bad meal at BJ's. The deep dish pizza is worth a try!"
