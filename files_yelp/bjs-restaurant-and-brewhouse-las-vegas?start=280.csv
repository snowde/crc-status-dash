Tiana M.,"North Las Vegas, NV",92,4,,4.0,6/16/2015,"I'm at this restraunt regularly and my thoughts are that the food is delicious but its really a hit or miss on the service. Some days are great and somedays are terrible. I will say this though, there is a waiter here named Anthony who is literally THE BEST SERVER I have ever had! He goes above and beyond for his patrons. He is always on the ball with great customer service, timely refills and answers for any questions or menu exceptions. Everytime we get him I know well be taken care of. Let's go Bjs give the kid a raise!"
Amanda M.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,36,1,5.0,10/8/2015,"We decided to try BJ's on a spur of the moment kind of thing.  What a great decision!  The wait wasn't very long for a Saturday night.  The staff was friendly. The ambience was nice and relaxed. And the Pizookies!  OMG!  White chocolate macadamia nut warm cookie with ice cream on top...mmmm!  I would go back just for that haha. My hubby said the steak was the best he's had since we've been in Vegas and we've been here about a year. The only complaint I have is that the pizza we ordered for my son came out about 10 minutes after our food.  The waiter said the oven was backed up. I understand, but 5 year olds don't care about how busy it is lol. But, everything was just fine once the Pizookies arrived!  We will go back!"
Tyler V.,"Las Vegas, NV",39,44,21,4.0,5/18/2015,"BJ's rarely disappoints. It is a good place to go when you aren't sure what you are in the mood for. The menu is small enough to make your decision easier, but varied enough to ensure you don't get stuck with something you didn't really want. Our last trip here, we sat at the bar and received great service. My fiance had the gourmet five meat pizza. He said it was delicious. I had the Hawaiian Mahi Mahi. This is probably the best thing I've had from here. The fish was cooked great and perfectly seasoned, but the real star was the pineapple fried rice. I'm not always a fan of sweet and savory combinations; however, this rice was phenominal!"

Sarah H.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,22,,4.0,9/20/2015,"I like this place but when it comes to football, you should play what the customer wants... You just lost my business for today..... All because you can't change the channels for one hour...that's pretty much all the time that was left on the game we wanted to see so we went elsewhere."
Kristina N.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,20,,1.0,3/30/2015,"While I was in the ER my husband offered to go get me food. He went to pick it up around 1045pm. I didn't get home till past midnight. When I got home and opened my Thai chicken mango salad (which was in two small containers, because they ran out of a big on) I was disappointed to find that not only did my salad not have any mango there was no chicken. I will be in in the morning to get my money back. What a waste. Thanks for nothing. Don't order take out late, they obviously don't care if they charge you full price and don't give you food. I got lettuce and dressing. Didn't eat it. So pissed and hungry!"
Brent H.,"Malden, MA",192,30,17,4.0,7/30/2014,I like the Jeremiah Red beer at BJs. Just ordered the Sante Fe Spring Rolls. They are always good. Not too long of a wait to get in. Sit at the bar and get discounts on your beer and apitizers. Comfortable place. My wife loves the salad. Go to BJs. And of course the pizza is great.
Kasio M.,"Centennial, Las Vegas, NV",29,34,7,1.0,11/29/2013,"I was not aware that Orwellian 1984 double thinks were made into a concept restaurant. But they are and it is called BJ's! Everyone will tell you how great this place is until one day you walk into their shiny establishment in Centennial Hills. About 30 minutes later you will realize that all of your friends actually hate you for suggesting that you dine here. All the service people are nice but in a really vacant Stepford wife kind of way. It's all lip service and no actual service. For example, our server was super interested in up-selling fancy beer to me... so we had to have a really long discussion about why I should try another kind of beer as opposed to the one I wanted. Once ""we"" decided that I would stick to drinking what I want, we must have also decided that the table would wait for 20 minutes before said drinks would be delivered.  If you've ever read 1984 you will know that questions are also pretty unacceptable. I wish I had known that it was a 1984 concept restaurant before I asked about vegetarian options on the menu! I had planned on ordering some pasta or something, but it turns out that all the pastas and salads include meat and are priced accordingly. One question about that and she was off for another several minutes. And the fun didn't even end there! I ordered soup and salad as my entree and both the soup and the salad were delivered to the table at the same time several minutes before anyone else was served. But I guess they did not consider this a problem since there was no silverware. So it's not like I was going to eat it before the rest of my party's food arrived, anyway NO BIG DEAL GUYS! And so I stared at my food until the rest of the party got their food delivered, too. And still there was no silverware. The random hostess that delivered the food nicely asked if we needed anything else and when we asked for silverware, she walked away. Then we all got to stare at our food TOGETHER! When we finally did get some silverware, I ate my Denny's quality food while feeling angry about the empty service and impending bill. This place is really Applebee's quality with Cheesecake Factory prices. My throat almost closed when I saw that the $12 avocado roll appetizer was actually only THREE avocado spring rolls. Not that it mattered since we never got appetizer plates even though we were asked if we wanted some when the appetizer was delivered. (Here is a tip: probably you should just bring appetizer plates instead of asking if the table would like some and then never bringing them causing another ""lets all stare at this food"" situation.) Try eating a whole meal with an anger lump in your throat. It really takes the enjoyment out of eating. BJ's was a big fat $60 disappointment that ruined the pleasant experience that eating usually provides to me. That is a big deal considering that is why restaurants even exist. Note to the management: I think that I would have given this experience 3 stars had the server or staff, who KNEW that this was a messed up dining experience for a number of reasons, had even tried to rectify the situation or notified the manager that the meal had been timed and executed very badly. But no one wanted to fix it and that enrages me more than anything else. Vegetarian Side note: I didn't try the pizza even though it is supposedly really good for vegetarians, but be warned unless you want pizza, you probably won't find anything else on the menu that you want. All the pastas and salads include meat, and I don't see the point in paying $16 for a salad and then asking that they remove the most expensive ingredient. They have a veggie burger which is your standard garden burger replacement. And it was soggy.  I will never go back to BJ's. It is over-priced and overhyped. If anyone I know ever tells me how great this place is again I will drop kick them so hard that they will need a kidney transplant in their face."
J. Lynn K.,"North Las Vegas, NV",10,20,,3.0,8/31/2014,"I eat here from time to time.  The service in the bar area is slow. In the restaurant, they have runners with the food, but if there is a problem, you need to tell the wait staff. the runners will just look at you or ignore you.  The food here is good.  I like the deep dish pizzas and the brewed root beer is excellent! It comes in a cold glass without ice.  Also, try the Asian Chopped Salad or the Lunch specials - salad with half a sandwich and fries.  It is a good price, and with a drink it is all about $10. The atmosphere is professional, but not friendly or ""warm"".  Every time that I have entered, I feel as though I am bothering the front staff.  They always seem distracted. Sometimes they ask for  the rewards card, and sometimes they do not.   I go for the food, not for the service.  Of the many times that I have been there, only  a couple of the servers have been good.  Some are slow, and some are annoying - calling me sweetheart/baby/darling, or just not responding.  Once they get the wait staff properly trained to serve, it will be an awesome experience!"
Aubrie M.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,6,6,2.0,10/26/2015,"My husband and I were fans of BJ's....until last night. After reading some current reviews, it seems our experience is only following the trend. Everything started fine, server was decent, with preferred check in we only waited about 15 minutes on a busy Saturday night once we arrived. My husband and father in law both ordered the new stuffed burgers the barbecue brisket ones. When food arrived, both burgers had no barbecue sauce....uhmmm?! Fine we thought we can just ask the waitress for a few cups to dump on them...except we didn't see her again for 15-20 minutes after the food came. Whatever. We finished up and left. Hours later, my husband became incredibly sick, didn't sleep at all and spent all the next day hanging out in the bathroom, all he ate the previous day was some fruit and vegetables and that burger. Needless to say, I doubt we will be back for awhile, if ever."
Courtney F.,"Las Vegas, NV",188,5,1,2.0,8/16/2014,Went to this Bj's with a friend who lived on that side of town. It was their first time at BJ's so i was excited to share one of my favorite resutaruants with them. It was late in the evening ( almost 9 ) and it seemed our server had quite a few tables.  She was very nice but our food service took way too long 25 minutes for an appetizer and then they food came out just 5 minutes later. Luckily we were starving at that point so we scarfed down our app.  As always dessert was amazing.  Would definitely go again but would not go that late.
Zaria M.,"North Las Vegas, NV",1,40,2,4.0,8/15/2015,The service was good and our server was very nice. The wait was a little long but we had everything right. We ordered a pazooki and that took like 10 minutes or maybe a little bit longer but we enjoyed our pazooki.
Nikki N.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,1,,1.0,5/28/2016,I was seated at 809pm and not one server came up to my table for almost an hour. After complaining twice. A waitress finally took initiative and decided to serve us. We waited about 20 minutes just to receive an appetizer which the manager said was on them due to the wait but then waited another 30 minutes for our food to actually arrive. The waitress never cleared our tale of the old plates and drinks and never gave refills until we asked. I have never received such terrible customer service. And my pasta was cold
Maria L.,"Las Vegas, NV",3,6,,4.0,7/29/2015,"Visited BJ's for the first time recently with a group of friends for a birthday celebration and overall experience was good. Our server I believe Heidi was her name was great as well as another server/busser that was working with her, they were great with our large party. My burger was ok, nothing great. I'd definitely go back for the service and try something else next time. Thank you."
Nelson Q.,"Las Vegas, NV",2738,1403,29290,2.0,9/16/2011,"Its a cross between Yard House and Cheesecake Factory.....Better beers at YH, The food selection is okay at BJ's, but even better at YH and CF....service is pretty lacking here, waitstaff tries to be more ""buddy buddy"" (playfully cursing F this and F that with the table inches away from us???)  and you can keep your pizookies(overrated), I'd rather have a piece of cheesecake or a kona coffee sundae.... Sorry BJ's, bottom line, all show, no go.....ALOHA! YELP 365 CHALLENGE-(40/365) ""The Yard House/Cheesecake Factory Wannabe"""
Dennis B.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,7,,5.0,5/20/2016,"What's not to like? Great food, great beer, and great service! Server Jon was excellent, providing just the right amount of attention at just the right time."
Stacia W.,"Centennial, Las Vegas, NV",74,4,,1.0,2/7/2015,HORRIBLE!!! Waited 35 minutes to get my food then it was wrong. Didn't feel like waiting another 35 minutes to get what I ordered. Bathroom was filthy! It had no toilet paper and yuck all over it! Will not go back.
Graciela R.,"Centennial, Las Vegas, NV",1,5,1,1.0,2/7/2015,"I had a very bad experience with the online ordering for takeout and the service for this location. I was emailed a receipt as confirmation of my order and when we arrived to pick it up an hour later, which is time they gave us, we were told our order was not made because they didn't have the ribs we ordered. I had left my number as well as my email which is how i got the receipt and no one bothered to call us to notify us at all. The whole point of leaving our number was in case they needed to call us for something and they never did. When my husband went to pick up our order the workers didn't know anything about it and then notified us it was never made bc they didn't have one item. The workers were not helpful at all. My family and I will not be going to this restaurant anymore and definitely will never use their online ordering again!"
Jade W.,"Las Vegas, NV",677,1185,1232,3.0,9/27/2011,"Came for HappyHour ($2off drinks and apps, half off mini pizza) with Angela H.  I had the Portobello mini pizza (half off during HH) and it was pretty good with a mix of portobello mushroom, carmelized onions, balsamic glaze and thyme. It was crisp outside and soft inside so it was cooked right.  Off the mini bites I tried the artichoke hearts (not on HH)- pretty tasty. It was perfectly crispy fried and the dip was good with it.  Service was decent enough. We decided to settle checks and get our pizza packed early but were staying a moment. I kinda wish we had some ice tea still, but I guess if you settle your check, you don't need to be seen to anymore."
Smith P.,"Las Vegas, NV",169,67,77,2.0,10/28/2013,"I've been here a few time and got ok service but this last time I was there was so bad. Right when we got in the host was eh. Wasn't feeling welcome at all. We got seat and our server came and took our orders but he was not friendly what so ever. When our food arrived we had no utensil. Had to ask for it. Every time he came back to check up on us the was talking and walking away from us. Like what the f!  When he brought our bill he accidentally hits out friend on the face with it. The apology he gave was so fake. Anyways beside him ruining our lunch the food was good. The best part was the dessert. The pizookie ! Overall restaurant it was very family oriented, place was clean. Hopefully they can up the standard on costumer service a bit. At least fake it good."
