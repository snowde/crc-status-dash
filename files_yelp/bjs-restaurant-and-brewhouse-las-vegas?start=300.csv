Heather T.,"Las Vegas, NV",69,8,,1.0,9/10/2015,"Terrible service all around. My server was so rude, he was too busy trying to hit on another customer than get our orders correct and at one point, I heard him tell another coworker he was trying to ""hit that"". Our food took nearly an hour to come out and then it was cold. Asked to speak to the manager, the server sent out one of his buddies pretending to be the manager! The server literally tossed our bill on the table and walked away without saying a word. Needless to say, his tip went to the busboy. Would never eat here again or recommend it."
Daisy G.,"North Las Vegas, NV",0,1,,1.0,5/10/2016,"Terrible Customer Service bad choice in restaurant our waitress Brandi lacked in customer service skills, I myself working with the public know it doesn't matter if your having a bad day or you're just too tired to be at work there is no excuse customers pay for good service you need to put a big smile on your face and get the job done right because without customers you don't have a job."
Katharine L.,"North Las Vegas, NV",2,31,12,1.0,2/27/2016,"I remembered that they have a pre call to put your name on list.  1. When I called I ask Kiki how call ahead worked? She said "" give the front your name and they will take you right in. WRONG Cuz When we arrived there we gave our name , they told us it would be 10 mins we thought oh OK WRONG ....we waited the 10mins .....but it was really 20mins more ))) 2. When we did get seated the Guy we thought was our server pass by our table 3 times before we realized he was our server (Brian) came over to take our drink order, that took 10mins now... 3. When I order pizza cuz this is a BJ( PIZZA ) Place . I asked with out pizza sauce .... Brain told me that all the Pizzas in the back are Per made .  (( Now I have worked in the Restaurant business for seven years . I know that there is a guy back there prepping pizzas all day for BJ (Pizza)all they would have to do is ask the prep guy to make it. The manager said that she would go back and see which pizzas had the least sauce. The reason I gave it one   because the food is good. Service lousy, terrible"
Jeremy C.,"Las Vegas, NV",67,93,33,1.0,9/14/2011,"This is the worst experience I have ever had at a BJ's. Seriously. I will not step foot back in this particular location..EVER. My wife got the $10 calzone and it was not longer than her fork. I added the photo so you can see no exaggerations. I got the boneless wings which was another huge error in judgement as they were not even up to par with something you would see from wendy's.  Now....I used to friggin live at the location up in Summerlin and never had issues BUT I usually only got apps. , the happy hour pizzas, pazookies, and BEER (and their beer isn't all that either but their Pumpkin one is great..) and never had any problems. But if this is the norm for these other dishes.....I am disgusted.  Will I go into the Summerlin location again for pazookies and such? Maybe..."
Mary R.,"Las Vegas, NV",213,90,73,4.0,5/27/2014,"It was Monday at 10:30pm...we were so happy they were open. Pleasant server, fast service...calamari was very fresh"
Michael K.,"Las Vegas, NV",59,32,,4.0,1/12/2014,Not too bad at all.  I enjoyed the beer and the burger was pretty decent.  Bartendress was cute and pretty good at her job so I really have nothing to complain about. I can't give 5 stars without it having changed my life though.
Crystal R.,"Las Vegas, NV",88,6,5,4.0,9/1/2015,"It was our first night out to dinner in quite a while so it took sometime before we finally decided on a place. BJ's on centennial did not let us down. The service was quick and friendly, the jambalaya and seared ahi salad were absolutely amazing. I would definitely go back again and again"
Russ W.,"Las Vegas, NV",4,92,34,1.0,8/1/2013,"Sucks! The service gets worse every time we go. Today we were seated, the server dropped off a couple of promotional napkins and then disappeared. No drinks, no way to order food... We dropped off our member card on our way out the door for the last time. BJ's has NOT earned our business. We went down the street to the Market Grille Cafe, we were seated, got drinks and ordered food in 5 minutes or less. Yes, they were as busy as BJ's. I suggest the manager of BJ's bring his staff to the Market Grille Cafe for lunch and see how it's done."
Thomas S.,"Las Vegas, NV",39,12,,1.0,3/13/2016,"I have been to this particular location several times, and have had mixed experiences with the restaurant, but perhaps last night was the worst experience. We went for a large family dinner to celebrate my son's birthday. The server, Sita, seems to dislike her job very much. As soon as we mentioned we would like separate checks, she acted as if the world was going to crumble. She demanded that we stay in the same seats, so as not to mess her up. She made a comment such as ""Oh geez, this is going to be difficult"". This type of restaurant should be used to handling large parties, as there were at least 3 others larger than ours. Even though the server made a point to write seat numbers down, the food was still auctioned off at the table. At least 4 different servers brought out our food out. This in itself is not a problem, however, my wife's food never came out, and I had not seen a server come to the table in over 10 minutes after the last plate was put down. Finally our server comes over, and I tell her my wife's food was completely missing. She tried to give some excuse, but there is no for us to wait 10 minutes to be told her food is going to be late because the server screwed up. My wife's food (which was a simple burger) did not come until after everyone else was finished, and had to rush through her meal. When the manager came by, I informed him I would not eat until my wife had my food, and then my steak would be cold. He did offer to bring me another steak, so that my wife and I could eat together. This second steak arrived to the table before my wife's first burger. So here I am with a second plate of food before my wife even had a single bite to eat.  Disgraceful. No communication whatsoever."
Holly M.,"North Las Vegas, NV",3,28,7,4.0,4/15/2014,"This was my third time here, and it was ok. The restaurant is clean, staff is nice, and the menu has alot to choose from.  Unfortunately the new roast beef dip sandwich wasn't very good. The meat tasted like the flat top was dirty? Not sure how else to describe it. We did enjoy the flatbread pizza appetizer, that was good. The beer was good too.  I would go back, but just not on the top of my list."
Erik K.,"Anchorage, AK",3,5,1,2.0,11/11/2014,Service was THE WORST!  Food wasn't much better. We will never return. Two hours of our lives wasted.
Marichris S.,"Las Vegas, NV",104,34,89,4.0,11/19/2011,"I love ordering from their small bites menu. I always order the Gourmet Mac & Cheese and the Fried Artichokes. The beer and cider drinks are really good as well. The only disappointment would be the red velvet pizookie, to me it tasted like straight butterscotch. Red velvet is known to have chocolate inside."
Jill T.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,21,3,3.0,6/10/2015,The menu offers plenty of variety beyond the pizza. I love the deep crust pizza and their specialty pizzas are great. The problem is the timing of the food. Every single time I eat here someone gets served a good ten minutes after the majority get food which is just awkward. If you are polite and wait then your meal gets cold. Good thing they serve their own beers.
John B.,"St Augustine, FL",0,5,,4.0,4/27/2015,Sat at the  bar Alenka was the server.   Service was excellent.  Pizza was very good. Highly recommend.
Dillon B.,"North Las Vegas, NV",0,14,8,1.0,12/21/2014,The server seamed aloof. When we told him we are ready to order he walked off. We ordered the chocolate mint martini and the house red beer. Martini Was not good. Only tasted the alcohol. Our server complained about how hard they are to carry. The Fish and chips was over cooked and tasted of only oil. Had to ask for vinegar and the server gave us the salad oil and vinegar from another table. The server did not give condiments through the whole meal. The beer and pizza were good aside from the jalapeños that I didn't ask for yet found on my pizza. Definitely missed the mark.
Keith A.,"Cheyenne, WY",0,3,1,2.0,12/27/2013,"Atmosphere- fresh and new, seemed to be family friendly, they need to work on cleanliness Food- looked great but was tastless Prices- lunch specials between 7 and 9 bucks Service- friendly however very slow Overall experience- unsatisfied, will not be returning. My wife and I arrived for lunch and the place was almost full. The hostess acknowledged us with a halfhearted greeting but sat us to our booth quickly.  When we got to our booth the floor underneath the booth was blatantly littered with food, bits of torn paper, crayons, used drink straws and so on, basically as if four young children had been seated there prior to us and the staff failed to sweep up after they left. 10 min later the waiter introduced himself and took our drink and appetizer order. The waiter (Chase) was very friendly and knowledgable of the menu.15 min later our drinks arrived and he took our lunch order. Another 20 mins later our appetizer arrived and the waiter noticed we needed refills. We had the bonless wings. They were ok nothing special. After another 20 min and our lunch arrived via a somewhat rudish food runner who did not acknowedge us and basically drop our plates in front of us and took off. I had the pulled pork sandwich with wedge cut seasoned fries and coleslaw. All of it looked great. Pork was moist and tender but no flavor. The fries once again had no taste. The coleslaw was delicious. I did not finish my meal due to lack of interest. The wife ordered the Jalapeno burger with the seasoned wedge fries and at first glance it looked great. But after further inspection the burger was way overcooked and the pepperjack cheese looked dead. She lost her appetite, but she is 9mths pregnant so that may be why. I never tasted her burger it just didnt look like something i would have liked. Her fries were no different than mine. Drink refills were few and far between. Yes we were there at the lunch time rush but the restaurant was not that full to have effected the service and serve times to that extream. However even if the service was on point the food fell short of our expectations."
Julie M.,"Las Vegas, NV",76,80,137,2.0,6/1/2013,"I want to start by saying that I think this restaurant is really overrated. I have been here numerous times and only twice have I not experience a problem with either our order or the service.  It's usually something simple like when my husband orders no mayo on his burger and it comes with mayo. The annoying part is that it ALWAYS happens! How hard is it to not put mayo on a hamburger? Often times our drinks never get refilled and the servers here are often MIA. It may seem silly to complain about a soda refill, but it's the little things that make the experience when you go out.  The tables really turned for me when I was a BJ's for my friends daughters birthday party and we had the absolute worst service ever! She was turning 9 and she choose BJ's for her birthday lunch, which I personally think was quite grown up for a nine year old, she could have gone anywhere but she choose BJ's!! Anyway, we only had 11 people in our party and it was 3:00 pm so it wasn't anything too crazy and it wasn't a rush hour, so it shouldn't have been something that they couldn't have been able to handle. Our server wasn't off to a good start, he was just sweating profusely as if it were 100 degrees inside the building with no air! He actually had sweat pouring from his face! Clearly a partly of 11 was going to be too much for him to handle, he needed to ask for help. Of course he didn't get help and things just got worse and as luck would have we weren't his only table.  .........And that's when it happened! Our server had just cleared of a dirty table behind ours and was walking behind behind us with a tray full of half empty dirty glasses,  when he spilled the tray all over my son and I !!!!! We were both cover with what I think was old iced tea! As we sat there wet, cold and in shock, our server just said nonchalantly ""I am sorry"" and continued walking to the back. He never came back out! So my son and I were left to try to dry of with the napkins rolls that were on the table! Meanwhile the floor underneath our chairs was a pool of spilled liquid and we were surrounded by it, so if we were to try to move our chairs to get up we would have been stepping in liquid! About three minutes latter our server was still MIA and there was no one coming out to mop up the floor, I was beginning to think I was being Punked! I saw a women walking toward our table who looked like the manager and I thought oh good she is coming to fix the situation, but nope! She just walked right by our table, even after looking directly at the puddle on the floor!! Finally another person at out table had to stop the manager because I was trapped in my chair wet and surrounded by the puddle of spilled drinks!! Meanwhile, my poor son just sat there so quietly and didn't complain once! Finally the manager did come over to me, she asked what happened and I told her how our server spilled a tray of old drinks on my son and I and then disappeared and didn't offer us anything to dry ourselves off with, nor did anyone come to mop up the floor! The manager barley apologized and then all she gave us was a small stack of the brown paper towels from the bathroom to dry ourselves with. I would have expected a clean white towel from the back, but this lady seriously did not get it! Finally about 15 minutes into this disaster someone came to mop up the floor so we were able get out of our chairs to make it to the bathroom. So then our bill comes, and don't get me wrong, I am not after free stuff, but after you spill a tray of drinks on my son and I and then disappear and treat us like crap, it would have been nice to just have taken care of the bill. Nope! Not even a little I am sorry discount! They gave my bill in full! So why the two stars you may be asking? Because I went home that night night and told my hubby the whole awful story and he was pissed at me and asked why I didn't freak out on them?! I told him it was because I was at a birthday party and I was trying to keep it cool, could you imagine if I went all momzilla at my daughters friends birthday, she would have died!! So my hubby went to BJ's website and contacted them. He was latter called by the DM who apologized for the whole episode and sent us a $50 gift card. Again, I am not after free stuff, what I really wanted was for them to just OWN IT the day it happened! If you mess up then just apologize and mean it!! The DM also sent the mother of the birthday girl a gift card too because the server messed up the birthday cake. I would have written about that episode too but I am only allowed 1500 words!"
Chase B.,"Las Vegas, NV",106,3,,1.0,7/17/2015,"Went to this location and the hostess, I don't remember her name, but she was really rude and told us different times from when we walked in till we got seated to eat. She was just giving us attitude after attitude and it was annoying. The food itself was good but the time we had to wait was ridiculous. They brought us out one plate at a time so by the time the last person got their food the first persons food was cold. They do how ever have a good selection of beer but when i got my beer tonight it seemed like it was sitting around for a little bit before it got to my table, could have been colder but it wasn't, disappointed in tonight but honestly I probably won't be coming back to this BJ's mainly because of the hostess."
Amber R.,"Centennial, Las Vegas, NV",0,13,,5.0,4/6/2014,"My husband and I have been here a few times now and it's been awesome every time. The service is super friendly and helpful, and the food has just been awesome every time. The mixed drinks are super good but they are a little on the expensive side. They do have a beer sampler that you can try 5oz tasters of a few different beers, it's a very good price and pretty fun to do. Depending on the beers you choose you might end up a little buzzed after you try them all, we always do. Lol We love this place. We definitely recommend it to everyone we know"
Beth A.,"Philadelphia, PA",34,46,5,4.0,4/30/2013,"We come to BJ's once a month or so and sometimes more when they have their 2 for $19.95 deal - you really can't beat it.  You get 1 medium pizza of your choice, 2 soups or salads and a full size pizookie.  You can also upgrade to a large pizza for I believe $2.00 more and it's definitely worth the leftovers. The only reason that I'm not giving 5 stars is because the service can be ""iffy"".  There are some really great servers there that can multi-task and few others that could really use some extra training OR just not be put on the dinner rush."
