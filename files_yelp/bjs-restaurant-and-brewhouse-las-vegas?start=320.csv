Jeremy S.,"Las Vegas, NV",142,22,17,3.0,3/7/2015,"Nice atmosphere and good food. Service is good overall, but inconsistent at times. We've experienced this during when they are and aren't busy. It's seems to be a popular place, and I'm sure it has a lot to do with the food ;)"
Samantha H.,"Memphis, TN",210,354,857,2.0,5/10/2013,I love the wings the pizza is just strange. After ordering pizza and being unhappy because it has no sauce on the pizza. They bring us say four pizzas total to the table in an effort to fix the issue. After a extra long 2 hour wait I requested to speak with a manager or the cook.  We were told by the management that the pizza comes with nothing but bread and cheese and what ever topping you pick. Well that's not pizza if you ask me. (That's called a sandwich.) The manager came to the table and told us its premade so its nothing he can do to make it better. He gave us a gift card in the amount of 25 dollars. I wont be back for the pizza I will be back for the wings.
Billy G.,"Las Vegas, NV",95,16,,2.0,3/25/2015,"10 minutes until a waiter came to our table, and not busy at the time. Server was nice...steak was horrific! Pizza and the chicken on the other hand...really good. But nothing special. I would come back, but not anytime soon."
T. S.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,1,,1.0,4/2/2016,"Don't order take out.  Takes as long as eat in. Order was wrong, salad was hot and hot food was cold. Bill was wrong,  take out service is slow. Don't bother."
Oceanus P.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,38,,3.0,6/1/2013,"This place is ok, I like that they have guest beers on tap as well as their house blend.  The pizza is good, no question. But the seared ahí salad is just sad. So sad it shouldn't even be served.  There were about 10 slices of ahi, the thinnest slices I have ever had in a salad. Sierra gold does a better version, with full pieces of ahi."
Robert C.,"Deer Park, WA",5,273,,5.0,12/7/2015,Always seem to be on top of their game ... made room for an additional guest (7).  Very timely on service and refills ... this is a regular place for us ... Thank you for making our meal special.
Chris E.,"Bay Area, CA",1,17,175,3.0,8/28/2013,"Place is a bit over priced and over-rated for the menu that they have, but the food is solid every time I come here. If I were rating this place just based on the food, it would be 4.5 stars, but other things kind of deflate my score of it: -usually long waits (excess of 20 min) on evenings -service, though waiters can be nice, are extremely busy and have little time to attend to each table.  You can totally tell that they're overworked. -it takes about 15 -20 minutes until your waiter comes by to get your orders for food, then you wait about 20-30 minutes for food to arrive--it's all a waiting game I ordered a steak, which was pretty big considering, and I'm always a fan of the calamari.  Also ordered a raspberry pazookie, which was pretty amazing, gotta admit, especially if you're not too into chocolate--this makes for a nice alternative to a rich dessert.   As a place to chill, grab a few drinks and side dishes and catch up with friends, I would choose this place, but for a dinner experience, be prepared to wait, wait, wait."
Ruth P.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,53,,5.0,12/1/2014,Excellent  service!  Anthony was great!! The food was delicious and the beer was cold! Will definitely be returning soon! Happy hour prices during the game!
Jordan S.,"Northwest, Las Vegas, NV",1,2,,5.0,6/2/2015,"The service and food is always great here! I especially like that they always remember my name and what I like to order. If you are looking for a neighborhood bar/restaurant that treats you like family, come to bj's on centennial."
Jacob L.,"East Falmouth, MA",0,18,,4.0,1/18/2016,"I was born and raised in vegas, but it's been over 7 years since I last went to a BJs. I was happy with the food and everything. I have to give 4 stars as a heads up to the restaurant though. On Sunday, the computers went down and the whole restaurant had an air of fustercluck to it. The floors were slippery (two elementary aged girls were holding hands and walking like they were in a skating rink with no blades; it was actually pretty cute), the bathrooms were a mess, and there was a lot of scrambling around on the floor. I feel like more could have been done by management to address the issue. The waiter, Ricardo maybe? had a beard but no mustache if that helps, was obviously experienced. I worked in a restaurant for a couple of years in vegas. I bet anything this guy has been working in restaurants for years and not just BJs. Do come here if you like deep dish pizza and pan-baked cookies with ice cream. I'm taking to you fatty! ;) Seriously, it's good stuff. In terms of the powers that be: do a little more for the customer from the management side of things when things go awry. Have a game plan."
Will H.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,51,5,5.0,7/27/2013,Came here for happy hours last week. Bar was full...so they seat us at a table. Still was able to get happy hour prices. Awesome!!!!!! Food is fantastic Wings: Yummy Etoh: Good My date and I had a great experience!
Nicole R.,"Acworth, GA",0,8,,2.0,10/16/2015,"My family and friends love to gather at BJ's - convenient location and, usually, good food and service.  However, the last three times we have gone, the service has dropped dramatically.  Last night, 10/15/15, might have been the final straw for us at this location.  The wait wasn't bad, thanks to the app wait list button, however,  that was the only plus. Our server was inattentive and rude.  If we had any complaints, she was prompt to pass the buck to her coworkers - Service is slow? oh that's because she's busy doing the work of others and there are huge parties.  I understand, there were a few huge parties there last night, so everyone was slammed.  Maybe warn us before we sit down that things might run a little slow or the kitchen could possibly be backed up - we would have come back another time.  Food wasn't up to par (and it wasn't, two kid pizza that just had a sprinkling of cheese, no tomatoes/sauce, two very rare bison burgers that were requested as medium, one very well done steak that was requested medium rare, and two dried out mahi mahi tacos drenched in sauce to cover it up).  We pointed all of this out to her and the fact that it took over 45 min to get the food-- her response, ""oh, well, if I was the cook, this wouldn't happen"", and then she walked away.  No asking if we would like to have it taken back, or offer to get a manager, nothing.  Luckily we were smart and all ordered our kids' food as soon as we sat. It still took almost 20 min to get their food though, and then it was still another 20 minutes for our food.  After that, our server messed up our bill 2 times (this time she blamed it on the computer); at this point, we were just done (it had been 2 hours at this point with three little kids at 745pm), so we just paid the bill and then had to fix it among ourselves.  She didn't even remember to apply the bill to our rewards after reassuring us she had done so.  The times leading up to this, the waits have been longer and longer once we've been seated, the food has been incorrect or served cold, and the staff seems disinterested.  We've even had a few occasions where we've needed to speak with the manager on duty and that hasn't gone well.  I'm very disappointed that this location just isn't up to par anymore as the pizookie makes the world go round for my kids and they'll actually eat their dinner just to have one.  Hopefully the other locations are decent so I can continue dine with BJs."
Joe C.,"Las Vegas, NV",43,30,2,2.0,12/12/2015,"The food quality here is always consistent and great, the beers are great and the atmosphere is typical BJs. The main problem lies in staffing. The management or corporate must really be trying to cut costs nowadays. We were here on a Saturday afternoon as a 3 top and our server was exceptionally friendly however she was deep in the weeds. Not her fault. She had two three tops, a four top, a eight top and a seven top. That's just piss poor management. Don't spread your staff so thin. My three top had intentions of putting in some work on beers but only got 2 after flagging her down. The other big parties waited for at least 10 minutes just to get drinks. The worst part was seeing the manager bringing 1 lemonade to a table and discussing the vast intricacies if each pizzookie with another party. Sheesh dude just staff more servers. They'll get a better turn over, more drinks on the tab and you'll bring in a higher profit. Like I said this was an afternoon around 2pm'ish. I can't image what it would be like for dinner. 3 servers and 25 expediters with nothing to do?"
Amanda L.,"Twinsburg, OH",17,34,12,1.0,7/25/2016,horrible service. mediocre at best food. there was a wait for a table last night at 9:30 at night and 3/4 of the restaurant was empty. our server completely didn't ask us if we wanted beer. I ended up going to the bar to get my friend his drink. avoid this location at all costs.  wish I could get a refund.
Tim N.,"Las Vegas, NV",180,22,5,3.0,11/27/2013,"Had the opportunity to visit this location, my first ever to a BJ's, on a Wednesday afternoon.  We had a short wait for a table and when we were walked to the table by a friendly hostess, I was surprised to see a tray of dirty glasses sitting on the booth bench seat.  It was quickly cleared away, but was still tacky to start things off. Our server was very mechanical and could have been a lot more attentive.  I sat with an empty glass for over 20 minutes after she stated she'd be ""right back"" with my refill.  We were her only table, so I know her attention wasn't focused on her guests at that point. The food was definitely better than what I expected and I enjoyed my Parmesan Crusted Chicken Sandwich a great deal.  The wedge-cut fries left a LOT to be desired, however.  They were barely warm and lacked any sort of seasoning whatsoever.   I'd give the restaurant another chance, but not for a while."
J. M.,"North Las Vegas, NV",0,8,,1.0,9/19/2015,"We went here for lunch at 12:30 on a Saturday on a beautiful September day knowing they had patio seating which is what we were looking for. The host was rude, telling us we needed to wait to see if he could find a server who would be willing to serve out there. After a wait, he returned telling us he was unable to find a server willing to serve us on the patio and that we could sit inside... ""He didn't want us to leave... But sorry"". So, we left. We went next door and enjoyed a beautiful patio lunch elsewhere."
Donna O.,"Las Vegas, NV",69,3,,5.0,3/1/2016,"I wanted a steak and my fiance , who is a vegetarian wanted a salad or flatbread pizza. Our server, Rhonda came over and I could clearly see she was slammed, being in the business myself. She was very pleasant, friendly and sweet. We ordered and I decided on the rib eye. I asked for rare- medium rare, Brussels sprouts and their mashed potatoes. When I got my steak it was clearly med, medwell and she immediately said, let me fix this, I said no worries and thank you! I ate up all my Brussels sprouts and half my mashed while my fiance finished her pizza. Then the manager, Romel came by with my steak, waited till I cut into it, which it was perfectly done and even gave me more mashed!! It was delicious!! When we got the bill they even removed the steak charge AND, we had ordered dessert and removed that too. I did not expect anything to be removed at all!! The service was impeccable!! Thank you again Rhonda and Romel!! You both have great customer service and we will be back! Thank you again!!"
Jason R.,"Henderson, NV",3,111,12,4.0,4/14/2015,Way better than the Silversdo Ranch location. I ate the whole pizza for a change. My boss lady didn't let me get a Pazooki! Left my cellphone ot was turned in to mgmt!
Steven O.,"Las Vegas, NV",36,21,,1.0,6/11/2014,"Worst experience ever! I ordered a Brewhouse Burger, which, according to the menu comes with sauteed onions. I asked for ""no tomato, instead more sauteed onions"". A reasonable request I'd think. Well, the Burger came WITH tomato and NO sauteed onions. Well, no problem one would think.... I pointed it out to the waiter. He told me that the onions are on there.... Seriously? I took the burger apart in front of him: not a single onion. He still insisted they are on there! Ok, called for the original waitress, she also told me that the onions are on there. I am not so sure what that is all about - 2 people starring at at burger with no  onions tell me that there are onions on there. I asked for the manager. He immediatley started telling me that there are onions on the burger. (which they had already taken). To sum that joke up. 3 people were calling me either stupid or a liar even though the evidence was RIGHT BEFORE THEIR EYES. No words of excuse - the waitress put on a big ol fake smile like she is laughing about me.  The beer took  15 minutes. Unacceptable. NEVER AGAIN!"
Lloyd R.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,29,2,1.0,6/14/2014,"The food is decent, but the service is the worst in town! We have gone twice just to see if it was a bad night, and the same lousy service was had! If you expect a meal under 2 hours, go somewhere else! They barely refill drinks, the waiter took 25 minutes to even take our order, it was absolutely awful!"
