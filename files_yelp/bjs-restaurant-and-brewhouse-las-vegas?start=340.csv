Kara Maria W.,"Las Vegas, NV",134,46,76,5.0,10/26/2014,This is our go to spot when ever where in the area shopping. We even travel to this one instead of the one by red rock which is actually a little closer to where we live. Staff is always friendly and servers are amazing! I don't think we have come across anything on the menu we didn't enjoy. I love the members reward program and how when they scan our card they have little notes like get a child's menu or they can make a note of any known allergies for future reference.
Milla B.,"Salem, OR",0,2,,1.0,6/3/2014,Ok read my tip .. And my review is the establishment has to be watched as double charging is not tolerated and we all work hard for our money. Not only was the boneless chicken wings under par but mC Donald's does it better and for only 4.99 for 20 .. So to tally 1 dinner and 1 sent back and 3 drinks cost us 89.$ later ! This is not the first time we have been over charges after leaving this restaurant .. Beware!!
Shannon C.,"Las Vegas, NV",14,37,4,2.0,6/6/2014,Last two times we came here the food wasn't great and both times I had hair in my food. :(   Don't get the deep dish pizza - no sauce of cheese. The regular pizza us pretty good.
Kas M.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,121,149,4.0,9/19/2014,"We got there around 7pm, it was happy hour because of the football game, we had a table at the bar. We waited for about 8 minutes & then were seated. We ate the traditional wings & avocado egg rolls, can't go wrong with that, they were delicious. Apple Martini & strawberry mojito were delicious. Taylor was our server, Nice server."
Jen S.,"Las Vegas, NV",235,447,661,5.0,12/3/2012,"Bj's is a staple of Las Vegas and a perfect example of the ONLY good chain restaurant that I have ever been to in my entire life. My friends and I constantly go here, I have probably eaten half the menu including the bbq deep dish, gluten free pizza, pesto deep dish, meat lovers deep dish, turkey burger, patty melt, mashed potatoes, steak fries, chicken santa fe rolls, avocado egg rolls, calamari, wontons, chicken sandwhich and honestly, I was never let down by Bj's. It is a safe bet, and this is my favorite location because it is never super crowded and on Sundays they offer a cheap and awesome brunch (which has captin crunch french toast and a breakfast pizza, must trys!) Their white peach margarita is also one of my favorites as well as their homemade berry burst cider."
Vanessa Z.,"North Las Vegas, NV",127,16,2,3.0,11/14/2014,"The food is always delicious and not to mention those to die for pazookies! But, this time my service was extremely slow. Our waitress didnt have very many tables but yet never had enough time to see how we were doing on our meal. I come for the food, not for the service!"
Kelsey M.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,6,3,4.0,2/13/2015,"We came fairly late so it wasn't busy and we were seated immediately. We ordered a mini deep dish french pig, flatbread tomato basil, flatbread Italian market and a cheese and broccoli soup in a bread bowl. I ate the flatbread tomato and basil which has fresh mozzarella, cheese blend, basil and tomato bits. It was one of the best pizzas I have ever had. Lots of good vegetarian options (including mine) and a gluten free crust option which is nice. All of the entrees were delicious! For dessert we ordered a pizookie which is pretty much an average skillet cookie. We got cookies and cream and chocolate chunk and they were good. We also ordered a beignet and that's where it  Got kind of weird. The beignet had a weird taste that turned out to be salad dressing. We sent it back and got a fresh one that was delicious and the strawberry sauce didn't taste like garlic and vinegar. The manager came and paid for all the deserts.  Overall: thin crust pizza is so good, waitstaff was average and the manager was very nice. Good place, will return."
Laura H.,"Hilo, HI",30,7,209,5.0,5/26/2013,"Enjoyed everything about the meal. From the drinks to burger. Only bummer was I didnt have room for dessert so, no pizookie. If you're a rootbeer or cream soda fan, try one here. I loved it!"
Tamara K.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,1,,1.0,7/12/2014,Came for a quick bite to eat and a cocktail...20 minutes to acknowledge us after we were seated! !! Drinks and food are good but service is lacking! !!
Jade U.,"Clark, NV",315,115,374,3.0,9/14/2012,"Lunch at bjs! Like eating here, the food is good/ok, I think I enjoy the waiters personalities above everything else here. The Centennial Center is descent enough and just as good as the rest I believe. They are new and i've given them enough time to break there heels in! Overall good pizzas and beer! I still like the tomato bisque soup and it's Cheese Ham sandwich neighbor!!  Well, it's just like a Yard house I would say~"
Jared W.,"Las Vegas, NV",75,29,4,4.0,9/5/2014,If this place wasn't so pricey sit would definitely get 5 Stars. Always clean and the service is always great. Their menu is huuuuugggge... Lots of variety and something for everyone regardless of how big your appetite is. BJ's house beers are pretty darn good as well. I'm rather impressed with the Hopstorm IPA.
Mrs. Rip E.,"Las Vegas, NV",6,173,27,3.0,6/1/2013,"One of our best places to go.  Friendly bartenders!   Avocado Spring Rolls to start - delish!  Spicey Meatball pizza - the best!  Black & Blue Burger - on the money.  And love the santa fe chicken salad.  Bar seating - which we wanted and liked....love seating at the bar too - because of the TV's...always sports going on and you get to chat with people.    Great service, high energy, super nice...great food, great home brews. This is our favorite local spot! Since my first review this place is just a-ok.  Staff is different every time we go.  Such a turnover!  Some are friendly, some not so much.  Food is still good."
Crouching T.,"Honolulu, HI",0,26,8,5.0,7/16/2014,My family and I had lunch here recently @ BJ Brewery and had a great time.  I ordered Moroccan Salmon and a glass of local tap beer and my choices were awesome!  We also ordered fried calamari and avocado roll for appetizers to share.  The lunch was just perfect with great food and great company.
Mike H.,"Las Vegas, NV",41,1,,1.0,7/14/2016,"Second review I've ever posted on yelp... this place was terrible. We had a 30 minute wait on a Thursday night with 4 adults and a couple kids. When we were finally seated, it took about 10 minutes to get waters, them another 20 to get chips and guacamole. The oil the chips were fried in was rancid, and the chips were extremely salty. We weren't given any plates for appetizers, so we all had to balance the salsa and guacamole on the chip a full arm's length every time we are one. Our food was brought out after another 20 minutes, but half the food was missing.  Another 15 minutes went by (we're now over an hour of sitting at the table) before the server told us he didn't know what was taking so long and the manager was going to come by... the manager just asked if everything was alright. Obviously if she had to come talk to us, everything was not alright. We were at a business dinner, so we tried to be nice about, and because we didn't make a big fuss, nothing was done beyond that... another 10 minutes went by after the manager left before the remainder of the food was finally brought out. By this time, the first food was getting cold, and our waters had only been refilled once during this time. The guacamole burger was also extremely salty, but the fries were good... Too bad we had to ask for ketchup three times before it was finally brought out. The waiter only stopped by our table twice on his own, the rest of the time we had to flag him down. We got the pizookie sampler for the table, and once again no plates were brought out to use until we had to wait another 5 minutes to flag down the waiter for plates (by this time the ice cream was of course melted). So after almost 3 hours total, we finally survived dinner. If you're looking for over-priced, mediocre food and terrible service in an overcrowded restaurant, this is the place for you! Needless to say we will never be back."
Vanessa K.,"Las Vegas, NV",265,172,62,5.0,2/25/2013,"Great service, nice atmosphere, decent food, great dessert! I went on a Saturday afternoon right before the dinner rush. Our server was phenomenal. He said it was his last day so unfortunately I can't direct patrons to his section, but even the managers were great. We were asked how our service and our food was twice while we were there and we has nothing but praise during our lunch.  The California Chicken Sandwich was alright, but too greasy for my own liking. The wedge fries were good though and the sangria was tasty. I shared the red velvet pizookie with my friend and it was phenomenal. It was perfect for 2 to share and I highly recommend it! I've been to BJ's plenty of times but this was the first time at this location and so far  it's definitely my favorite."
Shannon V.,"Las Vegas, NV",6,10,3,4.0,7/5/2015,"I love this place. It all started when I received a coupon in the mail for a free personal pizza. I was new to the area, my husband was deployed, why not try it out. Their food has always been amazing no matter what I've had (deep dish buffalo chicken pizza is my favorite!). When I broke my leg and was in a wheelchair a random waitress saw me struggling and helped me get into the bathroom stall, waited for me and helped me back out. She was amazing and her help meant more to me than she will ever know. I'm  sad that I didnt get her name. The only bad experience I've had after two years of dining here was last night. Brandi was our waitress. The restaurant was surprisingly not  too busy but her service was horrible and she was extremely condescending any time I tried to talk to her. Anyway, the BJs mobile app is easy to use and you receive points just  for eating there, which build up fast when  you love to eat like I do."
Jennifer E.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,5,,1.0,7/2/2016,"I'll make this as short as possible. We decided to come later on in the night 10ish is when we got to this restaurant and they close at 12. Anyway, hostess was nice and welcoming. Sat us accordingly. We brought our 19 month old baby with us as well. The waiter came over immediately. He was a young nice guy. Can't remember his name for the life of me. I think it started with a J. Anyway, we even engaged in a conversation and claiming he knows about babies and how they are. That being said, after we gave him our order we waited 38 MINUTES for our food!!!! 38 minutes! Are you kidding me? There were 2 other tables in thee entire restaurant!!!! We had no silverware. I had to walk up to another waitress to retrieve them. Our drinks were never refilled. Not once. And being it took that long for our food our drinks were gone WAY before or food got there. He never said ""sorry"" or let us know what was going on. To sum this up... I didn't touch my food. By the time I got done calming my antsy baby down from sitting so long I didn't even feel like eating. My husband and I were both very irritated. We will not return to this establishment again."
Patty B.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,21,,5.0,6/29/2016,"My daughter and I stopped at this location for dinner around 5:30 in the afternoon on a recent Wednesday after I had been on a plane all day coming home from a trip out of state. Even though the restaurant was pretty busy, we were seated quickly, and our waitress was attentive and polite. I had an e-coupon from a different location out of state as compensation for a less than great experience from the city I had traveled from, and although, the hostess wasn't familiar with the coupons, she handled it with professionalism and ease. I ordered one of the salad entrees, and my daughter ordered the chicken alfredo. Both our meals were excellent, and the portions were more than generous. I have eaten at one other location in Las Vegas, and had a similar experience. There is a great selection on the menu for both food and beverages, and the prices are reasonable. I like this restaurant, and will go again."
Adrian M.,"North Las Vegas, NV",0,2,,1.0,12/11/2015,I went into Bj's on my lunch brake this past Thursday and first off service was not great at all we waited a very long times for our soup and salads then it takes forever to get the dessert we ordered and then I was checking my bank account today as I always do making sure that all charges are accounted for and correct and I see 2 charges for the same thing at Bj's so in other words they some how managed to run my card twice this is not my first run in with this restaurant about 8 months ago I was at a Bj's and left a $10.00 tip on my card and same thing the next day was checking statements and there was an extra 90 dollars added to that tip I called and the manager said the server must have accidentally typed too many 0's so it took over a week to get that back and now this which is a smaller charge but still a inconvenience none the less and when I called the manager about this one that just happened all she said was that she is not sure what happened and that the one of the double charges was credited right back after they did it which would mean that he knew he ran my card twice somehow and never bothered to tell me it while I was there very dissatisfied
Alyssa B.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,3,,4.0,12/10/2015,Arrived about 9:00pm on 12/8.  The service was good and the ribs were amazing.  The atmosphere is nice.  I would recommend to my friends.
