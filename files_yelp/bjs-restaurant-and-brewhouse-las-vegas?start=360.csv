R. S.,"Schertz, TX",0,9,,1.0,3/16/2014,"3/16/2014 We spent more time waiting than eating. 45 minute wait for order to arrive, after finally getting a server. Food : meh Another long wait for dessert.  We were seated quickly and that was the only positive note. First and last visit.  Absolutely not impressed, really deserves ""zero star review""."
Brian M.,"North Las Vegas, NV",2,42,,2.0,8/2/2014,"Slow service.  Flavors certainly didn't come together with the scallops, except just too peppery.   The rice side was bland, and the asparagus are tiny twigs. Even the pink lemonade was just too bitter. Very disappointed."
Jonathan M.,"North Las Vegas, NV",92,3,,4.0,10/1/2014,Love this restaurant the selection of food is huge you can literally spend 20 minutes trying to decide what to choose from that huge menu. Very nice and welcoming environment and the area is good. You must try the pizza here I ordered it once just to try something different and now I cant get anything else.
Ash G.,"Las Vegas, NV",2929,255,268,4.0,2/16/2012,"I love this place because they have the most beers on tap in the area. Dead Guy IPA is my personal favorite.  I've always liked BJ's for their food, but I will admit that I usually go for their high calorie salads, soup and beer... The Ahi Tuna Salad is delightful and the main thing I get here. The other things to consider - Chopped Salad Thai Shrimp Lettuce Wraps Santa Fe Spring Rolls"
Jerry H.,"Las Vegas, NV",199,63,4,4.0,6/30/2014,"I stopped into BJ's the night of June 26, 2014  and I ordered a 6' combo pizza and a calamari appetizer. They were both very good. I will be back. It was about 8:00 PM and the place was PACKED. I saw the young lady who was the working carry area out as I was walking in. She was literally running to a car with an order. She must have run back to take my order. Very friendly with great customer service skills. I asked her if they were usually this busy during the week and she said ""NO"". She handled the people waiting and those who continued to pour in. Great job and I made sure to give her a nice tip. I checked out the many TV's while waiting and seemed like my order was up in no time. It's a nice place with reasonable pricing.."
Sofia R.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,12,,2.0,5/3/2016,"I've been going to BJ's all over the country for over 10 years. You usually have to be prepared for a long wait before being seated and if you're in a group, don't be in a hurry. Other than that I typically don't have any complaints about BJ's. But this particular one has lousy service. It's the least crowded BJ's I've ever been with a wait that is usually less than 20 minutes. The last time my husband and I went to this BJ's we had time to look at the entire menu to see what's new (and it's long) before the waitress even came to our table to take drink orders. Our food was brought out by the food runner and we were done eating and waiting for a check before we saw the waitress again. Nobody ever stopped by to offer drink refills or make sure the food was what we had ordered. We sat there long enough that we probably could have dined and ditched before anyone even realized we had finished eating. We wanted to order a Pizookie but we had been in the restaurant over an hour already and knew we'd be there another 45 more if we ordered one."
Jayelyn M.,"Las Vegas, NV",43,2,,5.0,8/17/2014,I recently move to the North West side of town and knowing that I have always liked BJ's on the East side I decided to try the Centennial location.  I typically get take out and I have never been disappointed.  I love the curbside delivery as I have kids and don't even have to get out of the car.  The staff is very friendly and very prompt. I have also eaten inside and have received the same great food and great service.  I would recommend BJ's to anyone looking for a great variety of food to choose from and service that is not only friendly but expeditious as well.
Matthew C.,"Las Vegas, NV",111,250,69,2.0,12/21/2011,"Having been open now for a few months, I have been here 3 times. Being one of the only ""trendy"" resturant in the area it can be quite busy all the time. I'm sure this is great for their business. For me there food is not worth waiting the 30-60 minute for two people. We ordered the all meat pizza and it was ok.. the crust was not cooked thoroughly. The beer is good. My biggest complaint for this resturant is the dessert menu. A pazzokie? really A) I really hate that name. B) it's nothing but a soft cookie with ice cream on it... not even original I can buy the same thing at albertsons, where I throw it in the microwave for 30 seconds slap icecream on it and shazam half the price and same taste. I wan't more choices, cheescake, a sunday, cake, etc. Until they open an outback or something better nearby I will continue to eat hear on occasion.    I checked not good for kids, but it's not bad for kids either. It's a brewhouse so a bunch of adults getting lit is not a great atmospher for kids and they may get bored easily. Red Robin and McDonalds are good for kids. My opinion. The customer service is lacking on weekdays. The place is filled with servers, chatting it up while we wait for drink refills, to get any kind of service.. we had to ask for water and for menus after waiting 15 minutes."
Rachel C.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,5,,2.0,2/22/2015,"I usually enjoy the food at BJ's. I like the fact that they have a big menu and something for everyone. The Pizookies are heavenly. However, the service is ALWAYS terrible.  It must be a corporate issue. I visited many locations in various cities and only once have I ever had good service. This last visit at the Centennial location was no different. Being a Friday night, we expected it to be busy. We didn't have to wait too long for a table, but once we were seated it was 10 mins. or more before our server came over. No big deal, he was obviously busy with multiple tables and we took the time to decide on our food. When he came over, we ordered food and drinks. He brought the drinks out promptly, but that was it. We never got 1 refill the entire hour we were there. A little crazy to me since I'm paying $2-$3 for an iced tea and my husband and I had each drained our glasses before the food even came out. I don't blame the server entirely, it's not like he was standing around idlely. I blame management (or whoever) who allows servers to become so busy that service suffers. This is something that needs to be addressed before I will go back."
Thanh N.,"沖縄県, Japan",172,314,87,1.0,9/17/2013,"CUSTOMER SERVICE REVIEW: I came here with my husband and two other couples for a Friday date night. Our server was horrible and so rude! My friend comes here at least twice a month and has been for over a year. She always orders the margharita pizza which comes with basil and tomatoes. This time when her pizza came out, it only had basil. She politely let the server know that it was missing tomatoes and asked for tomatoes. The server rudely told her that the pizza never came with tomatoes and she got exactly what she ordered(even though it always had tomatoes every other time she ordered it). He was about to walk away but she asked that they please out tomatoes on for her. A manager then came over and said 'hmm so I heard your pizza didn't come with tomatoes and it should have. We're going to comp that dish for you, sorry for the mistake'. Ok cool, but then when the new pizza came out the rude server AGAIN had to voice his opinions that the pizza does not come with tomatoes and that she was wrong and he is right(EVEN THOUGH THE MANAGER APOLOGIZED AND ACKNOWLEDGED  IT SHOULD HAVE TOMATOES!)And next time she needs to order another pizza called something else that comes with tomatoes and sausages, and had to say 'YOU ARE WRONG'. wow! Seriously? That's extremely unprofessional! And RUDE! Second problem-everyone ordered appetizers and when they came out one was missing. We ordered two artichoke appetizers and only one came out. By the time everyone was finished with their appetizers the second artichoke plate still had not come out. We flagged down our waiter to ask him to cancel the order as our entrees had just arrived. He would NOT cancel it and said 'oh I didn't know you wanted it to come out before your entree'. Uh hello? It's called an appetizer not a side dish!.....anyways he would not cancel the order and then magically brought out artichokes five minutes later.  I don't think I've ever been to a restaurant where a waiter is allowed to openly be rude and tell a customer they are wrong despite such a minor request! My friend was not at any point rude with her request at all and quite polite too. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL. I wish I had remembered his name, but I didn't pay. if I ever see him again(not on a group date), I will be sure to make a formal complaint with a manager."
John K.,"Charlotte, NC",67,15,15,1.0,1/28/2014,"I would not recommend this place to anyone. I mean from the minute we got seated you could tell our group was the least priority. I was the dd for the night and I got my non alcoholic drink last. It actually came after the appetizer. Not sure how that's even possible? Then a couple of the beers out of the taster were warmer, two out of our group got it and they both said that. Next, the steaks were chewy and could not be cut with their steak knives. The only good thing to come from this place was their fries. If I could give it 0 stars I would. Bad choice all around."
Matthew M.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,3,,2.0,2/10/2014,Took my family of 4 last night. We had been here a few times before and it has gone from very good to not so great. Every visit is a little worse. Last night will be our last vist.      Waitress was unpleasant and food came out luke-warm. Not worth waiting 20 minutes for and then paying 85.00 for 4 people to eat dinner. Pass.
Chase H.,"Lake Havasu City, AZ",67,144,2,5.0,7/31/2012,"I LOVE THIS PLACE! Well I went here tonight and service was amazing and the food was also just superb. I started tonight's experience by sampling 2 beers and deciding on the hefferveisen it was very good and I asked for an orange to complement the flavor.   Here we go into the meal, For starters we got mozzarella and tomato salad that I totally recommend it was only 3 dollars and it has an amazing balsamic dressing on it. YUM Main course I ordered the Portobello pizza and the chicken pot stickers for my wife and I and they were both amazing the pizza is a must try and the pot stickers were good BUT im just not so much of a fan of them anyway so they must have been amazing for me to finish my plate of them."
Christina A.,"Ventura, CA",403,405,152,2.0,10/19/2011,"I had the nachos and a mini bj pizza. Both tasted like they were ""frozen"" and recooked at the restaurant. I was very disappointed. I do not believe I will be back."
Vincent S.,"North Las Vegas, NV",0,17,5,2.0,7/8/2014,"Arrived around 2:30pm.it took an hour for our food after placing order.we were a family of six.three of us got our food and it was another 15 minutes before the other 3 got theirs.all burgers were ordered well done and two arrived to us barely medium.needless to say after everyone was finished eating, it was yet another 25 minute wait before the last two of the group got their fixed order.the food is ok at best.servers try,but in all,this was not a plea sent experience by any means.this place has too many issues.would not recommend and will not EVER return here."
Joel L.,"Camarillo, CA",0,23,3,5.0,9/3/2015,"Went in last night with a group of friends, Matt was our server. That guy was awesome! We had a great meal, and a few rounds of drinks from the tap. Matt asked a few questions and told us to leave it up to him. We were blown away by that guy's service! Every beer was perfect especially with our meal! No doubt next time we visit Vegas he'll be running the joint!"

Jenni B.,"Las Vegas, NV",36,74,73,2.0,8/6/2011,"Food-Great Service-sucks We have been here 4 times since they opened recently. The very first time, Service was wonderful, everything was A-okay. Second time, we called ahead since they offer that. We asked for a table for 4. We get there and check in to be told its a 35 minutes wait. Um, Ok. Why call ahead....? So then after the wait they lead us to a booth. I said we have to have a table...They explain that the take out employees take the call aheads and dont take any requests down. Um ok...well we wait in line again another 25 minutes. Finally get a table and guess what....No waiter was assigned to our table. Finally I flag a gentleman down after sitting for over 10 minutes and turns out he is a trainer in town to train this location since their so new....Well, He was wonderful. OF COURSE. Food was still a plus. Third and fourth visits...Pretty much same shit. Forget the food...I will go where they have there shit together !!"
C J.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,13,,2.0,4/30/2015,like all the  big corporate places there cutting costs so the food suffers the staffing suffers and in the end you suffer $$$$$ a lot more places to go too then this place
Michelle R.,"Beaverton, OR",43,88,12,5.0,7/5/2011,"Ok so I went 3 times in one week, thats how much I lOVE this place!! This time it was with a group of 6... unfortunatley they sat us in a booth barely big enough for all of us (probably didn't help having 3 buff men either ;P) but so this time we all kinda tried everyone elses meal and it all tasted amazing! as well as the Jerimah red beer! lol  Dessert: Well i would say if you get a Pazooki and have less the 8 ppl don't get the party platter!
