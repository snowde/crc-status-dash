Kathy C.,"Las Vegas, NV",12,47,9,2.0,10/29/2011,"It's alright. The drinks menu is pretty good, but the food is pretty average.  If you like chili, don't bother with theirs...you'd be better off having Stagg chili at home. The burgers, flatbread pizzas, salads are all ok.  Red velvet bazookie was the bomb, but I can't justify another star just for that."
Tommy V.,"Centennial, Las Vegas, NV",2,25,4,4.0,4/18/2014,"1st time there. Friendly staff with a clean and inviting atmosphere. Waited about 5 min to be seated but it was very busy and I now know why. I had a jalapeño burger, wife had the chili, kids had spaghetti, sirloin steak and chicken tenders. All were terrific with wonderful flavor. Total bill came out to $90 which is awesome for 5 ppl. Until next time!"
H K.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,63,49,4.0,12/19/2013,Great service . Jace is wonderful. The deep dish pizza is nothing like Pizza Hut but it's ok. The Caesar salad was delish. I recommend this place to anyone who likes American food .
Oana S.,"Las Vegas, NV",209,81,10,3.0,7/19/2014,"The service was good, the salmon was good, the salad was good, the veggies need work."
Crystal G.,"Tucson, AZ",3,5,,5.0,10/27/2013,I used to work for BJ's in a different state and can say this location holds to the standards of the company.  They have amazing beers and great pizza. Worth every penny! Happy Hour is a really good deal if you are looking to save a bit.
Jonathan D.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,3,,1.0,7/7/2015,"I went to this location on 6/5/15. It was to busy at all, but can someone tell me why it took over an Hour to get a bacon cheeseburger? I went with my wife and kids and they all got there meals that we ordered except me. Then the manager tells me I don't have a answer to why it took over an hour to even put in the order. This is how they treat Veterans?? I will never go to that restaurant ever again."
Jonathan M.,"Centennial, Las Vegas, NV",11,6,,4.0,8/13/2013,"BJ's is a good local bar and with higher quality food than typical bars. Lots of good selections but mainly they have some great microbrews to try out. Not designed to be a 5 star restaurant and that's okay because if you're looking for some great beer, an atmosphere to have fun, and some great French fries try it out!"
Kate K.,"Houston, TX",27,150,90,3.0,6/14/2013,"If you haven't tried this chain, you probably should.  Great beer selection and a huge menu so there's something for everyone."
Jacob D.,"Monterey, CA",29,162,1,1.0,7/19/2011,"Not sure who wrote that first review but they may be an employee of BJ's. Hope the management is reading this because the one thing that guy had right was 'getting into the swing of things.' Service was a train wreck! Let me say it was not the front end waitresses' fault. We waited a half an hour for our food. And it was appetizers? The food they brought out tasted more like bar food. C'mon guys, get it together! Were you just in a hurry to get the place open? Where is the Yard House in the Northwest?"
Bridgette Q.,"Spring, TX",16,54,10,4.0,2/10/2012,"[Visited on Wednesday Feb 8th] I'm not big on chain places but our food was pretty good. I had chicken wontons with thai sauce and spinach stuffed mushrooms. My hubby had an ""under 575 calories"" meal that was very good. Lots of textures and flavors and moist chicken breast to satisfy the gastronome whose counting calories. But I ordered the small bites so that I could save room for one of those famous deliciously decadent pizookies. If you don't know what it is, I'm going to leave you guessing. Get curious and try it out - you won't be disappointed. The place gets a four on dessert alone. Did I mention that they MAKE delectable sodas - root beer, cream soda, orange cream soda and at least one other? We rarely order non-alcoholic drinks cuz we're stingy when it comes to what we spend our dining money on - but this was well worth it plus we got free refills. We also ordered a happy hour drink, mango mojito, which was like $5. During happy hour, they also have $2 off full-size appetizers and 1/2 price mini-pizzas (which really aren't that small; they're deep dish). It was a good deal. We spent more than we usually do because we ordered drinks and dessert but it was still a good deal. We'll definitely go back if only to sit in the bar and watch sports on one of the tvs. Also, we didn't have to wait at all for a table like Matt C. apparently had to. It was about 4pm on a Wednesday, so I guess it was a good time to dine. I'm sorry Matt C. didn't enjoy his experience, but we really liked it. I'd say try it out for yourself."
Ellen P.,"Las Vegas, NV",6,36,3,3.0,8/22/2011,"Took 5 kids and a friend out for dinner.  Although it was only 5:30PM midweek, the place was packed!  Seated quickly, Service very good, Food above average. Price was fair. We had everything from a burger to pasta to tillapia and it all looked tasty.  Nothing was marvelous but everything was well cooked."
Teresa S.,"North Las Vegas, NV",4,2,8,5.0,9/15/2013,"Amazing deep dish pizza's, wonderful service. House draft is really good. I love the pizookee, wow just an all around fantastic place to eat!"
Randy F.,"Las Vegas, NV",61,13,,5.0,1/17/2014,Candace and Amber are the beat servers. Ryan was tops until he left for Oregon.
Alexa R.,"Las Vegas, NV",455,156,35,4.0,5/8/2013,"Ok first off, it was very awkward having the Manager seat us and then take away the drink menu because I didn't look 21. Luckily I already knew what alcoholic drink I wanted to order but really? At least ID me especially if you are the darn manager. Second, Francisco was our food runner but I tipped him and not our waitress because that's how great his customer service is! BJ's could be better but I'll come back if Francisco is working because he will do his job and the waiter's job!! ha"
Charlie G.,"Las Vegas, NV",5,15,2,4.0,6/21/2011,"I went here during the first week of training, service was good considering that they were in training and pretty packed for the night. I ordered the Angel hair pasta with shrimp and feta cheese it was delicious plus a large portion. I also ordered the chocolate chip pazookie w/ vanilla ice cream...... mmmm it was good!! I want to go back to check it out again in a few weeks..... hopefully the service remains the same."
Kelley H.,"Denver, CO",89,106,9,5.0,7/7/2011,"Pizookie near my house, ahhhhhh!!!!!  I am so happy BJ's opened up in Centennial. I was so excited when I saw it being built and could not wait for it to open. I can hope for shorter lines than the one in Summerlin!  Well I went to visit this place last Friday for lunch and enjoyed my experience. The decor is pretty much the same but I love the big open windows because the one in Summerlin feels like its in a casino. We were greeted and seated right away. Our waitress was very attentive, a little to much at the end after we paid but she will get over it, haha. I ordered the club sandwich and my friend ordered the pulled pork. Both were very yummy and came out in a timely fashion. Of course we than had to have some pizookies! I ordered the red velvet and wow that's one sugar rush. It was so yummy! I was hurting at the end.  Even when its busy I love coming here just because the atmosphere and they have some good food and beer! I am so happy this place is so close now. I may need to go to AA for Pizookie's!"
Katherine G.,"Las Vegas, NV",216,39,193,5.0,12/11/2013,"Got the Holiday Share Dinner for 2 for $39 and is definitely worth it!! We each got soup or salad and entree of our choice and we share a pazzoki!!! On top of our meal, we enjoyed their signature drink called Jeremiah Red. Also, our server was on top of things!! Best service in my life time!! Great experience tonight! Our servers name is Brittany J!! Good job, Brittany!!"
Angie M.,"Farmers Branch, TX",550,210,350,5.0,5/22/2013,"I love BJ's, the service is always good.  Great food and drinks."
Duncan J.,"Las Vegas, NV",65,27,6,2.0,7/6/2011,"Our first visit to a BJs.  Several friends had said ""YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS   PLACE"" and believe me, if I could make the caps bigger I would!  This is the third and newest location to the Vegas valley, and all I can say is, YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS PLACE lol.  My wife and I went on a Monday afternoon, typically a slow time for a restaurant but not this time, the joint was packed, so we knew something good was happening.   We started with the Avocado eggrolls which simply melted in our mouths. I had the Tatonka stout, their darkest beer, and for those who like stouts, this was the richest, creamiest, chocolatiest stout I've ever had, a party in my mouth.  We shared the deep dish Mediterranean pizza, and it was fantastic, took half of it home.  Shared a chocolate chunk pizookie for dessert, but honestly, the rest of the meal was so fantastic that the famous pizookie was simply a pleasant afterthought at that point.   Can't tell you how happy we are, as former east coast residents, to finally find pizza THIS good in Las Vegas, because let me tell you, it's been a long search! Edited 3/8/16:  My first review was five stars, this one is two; Maybe BJs is a victim of its own success, but for whatever reason, it's not the place it used to be. This downgrade is based on our two most recent visits, both were for ""Beer Dinners"" which are advertised well in advance, and require signing up to save seats because of their popularity.  The first beer dinner I speak of was at the Summerlin location about six months ago, so I apologize for mentioning it here, but I do so to make clear the problems we experience are chain-wide and not confined to one particular location.  The Summerlin beer dinner was supposed to begin at 7 pm.  My wife and I arrived early (about 6:30) and checked in at the desk, and were told the room wasn't ready yet.  About ten minutes later, as others around us waited for same beer dinner, they started seating people, but not in the order they arrived, but in some unrecognizable system only they knew.  So our arriving early did NOTHING to help us get seated sooner, and in fact, we were one of the last couples to be seated, despite people arriving later being called before us.  Bad start BJs.  I think this beer dinner featured Stone Brewery, one of our favorite beer brands.  But somehow, they managed to pick some of the least pleasing Stone varieties, so strike two. Fast forward to last night, at the Centennial location, where we had signed up for a beer dinner featuring Lagunitas brewery.  We arrived at 6:45 for the 7 pm event, and the lobby area was PACKED with others also waiting for the beer dinner.  The desk said ""Oh the room is almost ready, just a few more minutes.""  Finally, at 6:50, the huge throng of people starts moving towards the room reserved for the beer dinner.  My wife and I didn't hear any announcement, but we tacked on to the end of the line as it appeared to be heading in the correct direction.  They were checking people in at the entrance to the room; which slowed the line dramatically, and we saw the room was almost at capacity before we even reached the entrance, and it was now 7 pm, and they hadn't even finished seating.  My wife and I looked at each other and said ""Let's leave"" and we did.   I do admit, I'm not a fan of crowds, and 7 pm is LATE for dinner for me.  These factors certainly played into our decision to leave.  But BJs you need to do better; perhaps consider opening the room up 30 minutes before the event, so you don't have sardine-canned patrons in your lobby.  And if you know you have a popular event, as these beer dinners often sell out, perhaps consider not maxing out the room, so those not fond of crowds (like me) feel a little more comfortable.  These things would go a long way toward pleasing your customers."
Lj N.,"Issaquah, WA",137,120,12,4.0,5/13/2013,"We were referred to this place by some friends for the pizza.  After waiting about 40 minutes to be seated, and another 40 for our food,  we were ready to dive in to our pizza.  The food is good, the atmosphere cozy, the service decent, somewhat pricey. It's not a place I would go out of my way for, but not a place I would avoid or mind eating at again."
