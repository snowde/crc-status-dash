Mike K.,"Las Vegas, NV",69,58,12,4.0,4/22/2017,BJs menu has a wide variety of food. Great for drinks too. Their app is great for rewards and getting in line on busy evenings.  I love their soup and salad special for lunch.
Natalie M.,"North Las Vegas, NV",37,2,,1.0,10/23/2017,Went here for a date night and we both ordered burgers. Mine was undercooked and both of ours was sooo bland (Denny's has better burgers) then My infant and I got a lemonade spilt on us by our waiter. We didn't get a discount or an apology so I did not tip and we won't be going back. I recommend somewhere else.
Elle M.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,27,1,1.0,10/1/2017,Ordered out after some friends suggested them. My friend picked up the order and they forgot to put French fries in the order.  When I called they said they had ran out of extra boxes or something and were supposed to put it with the burger. They offered a gift card for the price of the burger and fries which I thought we nice and said they would email it to me. Well never received it. I didn't call back because I had a busy week and by now I'm sure they forgot who I am. Just really lacking on the customer service and the food was a disappointment.
Josh M.,"Las Vegas, NV",288,7,2,5.0,10/10/2017,Great service and food. We had Jennifer and she was attentive and informative about the menu. Always asking for her from now on.
Brittany A.,"Helena, MT",550,5,,2.0,8/19/2017,"I waited forever for my app and when I did get it, it was cold (spinach & artichoke dip) and then my entree took another 15-18 minutes and I got a soup and salad combo"
David D.,"Las Vegas, NV",8,201,88,1.0,8/18/2017,Came in at 4:45pm. 300 people waiting for a table. Hosteses clueless. Told wait was 10 minutes. After 45 and the line not moving we walked out.
Jess G.,"Las Vegas, NV",57,185,25,2.0,4/28/2017,"Well, BJs is consistently bad and that's about they only thing they've gotten down. My husband and I decided to give them a chance for a pizookie tonight. When we were seated, we figured we'd give their appetizers a shot. We did the sampler with the avocado egg rolls, cheese sticks, wings, and spinach artichoke dip. The dip was runny and gross, the egg rolls had no flavor besides avocado, but the cheese sticks and wings were ok. We didn't finish much of it. For dessert we did Oreo, chocolate chunk, and salted caramel mini pizookies. Meh, I don't get the hype. They're okay but they're really not all that great. We prefer the passion cookie at Streets of New York, but they were closed. They get two stars because the food was tolerable.  As far as service, I'd give Airica four stars. She was hustling and appeared to be the only server in the bar area. Our food took forever, but that definitely wasn't her fault. In regards to other staff, there was a server who violently burst through the kitchen doors multiple times and nearly throttled a customer. He also loudly complained to the host about how many issues he currently had. We all have bad days-I get it. But come on, keep it professional! I've learned my lesson and I'll stop banging my head against the wall that is BJs-never again!"
Itzel D.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,5,1,3.0,10/1/2017,Last night my boyfriend and I we decided to try out for the first time in BJ's.  We get there an its a  20 minute wait it's understandable It was 7 o'clock at night we waited. First of all our waitress didn't introduce yourself.  I work in Food and beverages and that's the first thing you should do. We start ordering our  appetizer  but in between ordering appetizer and entrees I ordered  a thousand Island drink. Tell me why my appetizer my entree came before my drink . We order cherry chipotle salmon in the Peruvian quinoa and  s... when we ask for our bill they were charging us a prime rib and some salads that we never order. And they were charging twice the original mount. I was  disappointed about  this restaurant
Jacob B.,"Las Vegas, NV",7,24,4,4.0,6/16/2017,"I've been to this location twice now and it's been good both times.  I was with large groups both times, and even I was getting frustrated with my friends' inability to decide what they wanted... The staff was more patient than I and were great both times.  I tried the peanut butter pazookie dessert this last time..  soooo good!"
Marty T.,"Las Vegas, NV",54,8,2,1.0,10/12/2017,"The cooks and cashiers really need to start reading the orders, THE SIDES ARE ON ALL LABELS. We do not have the any sides at work. When we order food we would like to have everything. Our time during break is very limited on when to eat."
Kaylan K.,"North Las Vegas, NV",0,1,,4.0,12/13/2017,"Very good dining, I was having a little trouble with my food and Jennifer offered to change out my meal which was more than I was expecting! Atmosphere and service was great (:"
Randy S.,"Goodyear, AZ",17,6,2,1.0,7/6/2017,"Just an absolute awful experience.  I have been to a couple of other BJ's and have never had issues like this, so I will say it could only be this location and after reading the reviews, it sounds like a management problem at this particular location.  Our party of three ordered a soup and a salad.  After about 20 minutes of not seeing our waitress, our entrees arrive, no soup, no salad.  Not only that, my baked potato came cold.  After asking for the manager to express our frustrations, our salad and soup decided to arrive at the table, maybe it's new for the soup and salad to come after the entrees?  The waitress went back to get a new baked potato, which amazingly came out COLD!  Seriously?  The first one was unacceptable, I don't know what to call a second cold baked potato, maybe asinine?  Needless to say we will never go back to that BJ's location ever again."
Goldie B.,"Las Vegas, NV",3,16,3,4.0,9/10/2017,"Had a great experience on a Sunday night with Lo at the bar, had dinner, soba noodles chicken and the man had a ahi salad. Great service only thing super distracting was the crazy loud beeping coming from the hostess area. I asked about it bc I thought I might be going crazy, turns out it's the firearm system. Might want to get that checked out. :/ super distracting and loud. We love coming here but it's annoying."
Megan B.,"Toutle, WA",22,89,9,1.0,8/2/2017,"Not Celiac friendly.   I called ahead to verify their gluten-handling knowledge and once there let the server know I had actual Celiac Disease not just a dietary preference. Both times we were assured that all precautions were/would be taken against cross contaminaton but the fact that I'm sitting here in pain and ill... well, it tells a different story.  I believe the cross contamination comes from them using a serving ladle that's used for filling the bread bowls; ladle comes into contact with the bread bowl and then goes back into the pot of ""gluten free"" soup. I also wouldn't be surprised if there's a level of cross contamination coming from the rags/towels used to clean the plate from drips or to wipe off hands (even if they use gloves, I've seen chefs wipe gloved hands).  The food itself (Broccoli Cheddar Soup) was tasty... even the gluten free Pazooki! However, I can't in good conscious give a higher rating. When dealing with food prep for someone with Celiac Disease you absolutely CANNOT use a knife (or other utensil) that has simply been wiped off, or a cutting board that has been in contact with gluten (unless you really scrub at it by hand), or wood-anything."
Michele C.,"Las Vegas, NV",15,30,,5.0,11/23/2017,"We've been to this location several times for happy hour and the bartender has always been pleasant and/or at least doing their job however we stopped for lunch Tuesday after a horrid morning and we were pleased to find not only a friendly hostess but an engaging bartender. My guest check says Kymwonia so I hope that is correct because this girl is the ""BEST"". I have been here 20 years and rarely see anyone behind a bar with her qualities. She guided us through the B J Rewards app set up with the patience of a Saint. When I wanted to switch something up on the menu it was effortless on her part. My friend had a Bacon Cheeseburger and I had Mediterranean Tacos. Both were excellent and extremely fresh. If I have any complaint at all I think $6.75 for a well drink is outrageous because I know what it costs to pour that drink so for a ""locals"" hangout that can be a bit pricey. However management is on top of their game here and that is rare in the chain restaurants of the area."
lawrence s.,"Las Vegas, NV",10,11,7,2.0,6/15/2017,"We are always sorry we came to eat at BJs, none of our specifics of our order came out as ordered. Can you imagine roasted asparagus being spicy and not described that way on the menu. With my tongue on fire I said I'll have the green beans instead, nope those r spicy to. They remade my meal this time as ordered  Ribs light sauce this time the baked potatoe was not hot enough to melt  the soft butter! Like I said never coming back. Now we are observing a health code violation live, busser is using same rag on table and seats"
Dan C.,"Newbury Park, CA",2,12,2,2.0,9/2/2017,"Went here today with my buddy for lunch. Food was good, beer was excellent. Then, got home, felt not that good. Ended up vomiting about 4 hours after eating there. My buddy felt a little sick, but not as bad as me. Been super gassy since. You guys have great beer you can't get anywhere else, but make sure you have kitchen staff who know what the hell they are doing."
Chase K.,"Las Vegas, NV",114,59,7,4.0,6/12/2017,"I've never had bad service here, I've waited sometimes longer than usual, but they always take care of me. They've also never messed up my order, and constantly ask for refills, bringing any condiments and whatnot, and service is usually great! I love the food as well, whether it's their deep dish pizzas, sandwiches, or their incredible pazookies! I love this place, and I've only been to this location, so to me, it's a hit! Probably going back today!"
Regina S.,"North Las Vegas, NV",9,8,3,5.0,9/11/2017,"We were looking for a place to eat then I remembered son telling me bout this place so I called ahead we got there no waiting went right in the waiter was so nice his name was Jon very nice disposition he asked us if we would like to try samples of their beers, so we took him up on that trying the Oktoberfest brew n the other one was sunset pretty good, we ordered the stuff mushrooms, Advocado egg rolls, both were very food Id like to recommend ordering the California Advocado Club mmm very delicious , then for desert  we had pazookie Ghirardelli chocolate cookie warmed with chocolate icecream  in the middle sprinkled with chocolate chips delicious, any way I do recommend this place n Jon provided great customer service, Thank you Jon!"
Brandy L.,"Las Vegas, NV",224,76,212,3.0,2/27/2017,"The place is clean, the service is good, and the food is good quality. The ambience, food quality, and beer selection is a step up from a PT's or similar chain bar. Overall, it is unremarkable, not bad, but not great. I go here because they have fresh bread bowls for their soups and their mozzarella salad is one of my favorites. I would never come here to celebrate an event, as it basically feels like an upscale local bar. I like imperial stouts or similar dark beers, and they don't have a wide selection of dark beers and the ones they have are not my favorite. If you like light beers, wheat beers, and hoppy beers you will find many options. Don't go out of your way, but if you are limited on options, this wouldn't be a bad voice."
