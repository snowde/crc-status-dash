Teresa W.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,5,,1.0,4/18/2015,"We won't be going back to BJs (at least at this location) for awhile. Our previous trips have been OK, but this past trip the food and service were terrible! My dish had cilantro in it (which wasn't listed on the menu) and I hate cilantro! I picked through the side and ate the fish.  My husband had to send his dish back because it was so spicy he couldn't eat it (and he likes spicy food). In the mean time I was finished so I ordered a dessert. My husband's new dish arrived, and he had nearly finished it before my dessert ever showed up. When we finally got our check they had charged my husband twice for his meal."
C Heisman R.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,29,15,5.0,2/15/2014,"Love it! The fries are awesome, I've been 4 or 5 times and when ever I'm passing through Vegas I try to go, highly recommend."
Kristal M.,"The Strip, Las Vegas, NV",6,35,9,4.0,11/30/2012,"Great beer selection, my favorite is the avocado egg roll! I order the appetizer as an entree. My husband loves the pizzas."
Elisa P.,"North Las Vegas, NV",0,8,,1.0,7/26/2015,"This location used to be our favorite...they were always 5 out of 5 in everything. The last 6 months though - after second chance, third chance etc. of hoping they'd get it together - I'm afraid we will never go back to this location. The service over the last 6 months is terrible...the waiters are moody, the orders aren't accurate and you have to ask repeatedly for anything. The food has been perfect the last 2 times but prior to that the food was inconsistent and not accurate according to the menu (ex. the tomato mozzarella salad comes with balsamic reduction, olive oil, purple onion, garlic and basil...sometimes the onion would be left off completely other times there would be tarragon on it instead of basil!). It's more aggravating to go there then to just cook at home and clean up myself. Dinner there recently has sometimes taken an hour and half because they're so slow. On a weekend night we used to wait about 45 mins for a table for 4 and now we maybe wait 5-10 mins if at all...I think that says it all. Everyone is seeing the dip in quality and the poor service and are choosing to go elsewhere. Even the managers sometimes seem frazzled with what they're dealing with. The bathrooms are rarely clean and the restaurant isn't as clean as it used to be (I slipped on a grape on our last visit AND stepped in a puddle of melting ice in a separate part of the restaurant). Check your silverware - the last few times we've had to ask for new silverware as ours was still dirty. Your money would be well spent elsewhere."
S K S.,"Nampa, ID",1,38,,5.0,3/28/2015,Super service.  Got the unlimited soups and salads so I could try different things.  A friend got the egg rolls and enjoyed them. The overall favorite were the pazookies.  So yummy. I was glad we tried them.
Rae O.,"Las Vegas, NV",25,33,2,5.0,1/4/2013,"I love the tomato basil salad.. I can eat two of them. We eat here a few ti,es a month. The staff are always helpful and attend to our needs quickly. Thank you for you great food and great customer service."
Vynetta R.,"Honolulu, HI",198,98,45,4.0,4/26/2013,"Ladies luncheon day. Somedays the service be on point and other days I get very slow service. I guess it depends on the influx of customers, the food I will say is always delicious and made perfect. This location seems to have people always training but I'm not a picky person especially when it comes to someone learning. Lots of parking and lots of indoor and outdoor seating."
Terry S.,"Centennial, Las Vegas, NV",0,1,,1.0,1/15/2014,Awful! Bacon cheeseburger was missing bacon and cheese. It took 15 minutes to fix. Chicken Alfredo was cardboard with noodles that had 1 tablespoon of something that looks like curdled milk.
Kili H.,"Waianae, HI",23,6,,4.0,6/25/2014,"everyone to their own opinion and this is mine about BJs in centennial.  If you are traveling up from the las vegas strip area, take the US 95 N and then go straight up to the Ann rd exit.  Take it left to all the shopping and eateries.  Follow it to BJs on the left you can't miss it.  Parking is ample and as soon as you walk in, it has a very lively  vibe. This is the second time we ate here and we loved it so much the first time, we needed to return when we came back into vegas.  I would have gave full stars this time but our waiter wasn't that great.  So, sat and he came up and was not interested in US, just wanted to see if we had a card with the restaurant and we said no and he left and didn't come back for a while.  Upon his return he stated that he needs to know if we wanted a frequent diner card and we said ""NO thank you"" because we don't live in vegas and he walked away again.  Now, someone else came back to do our drinks and then he came to take our order and didn't seem to want to help with our questions.  So, we just ordered what we knew and then he was on his way.  The food came and made up for the poor service.  We had shrimp scampi (if you like drier scampi like I do and lots of garlic with angel hair pasta...this was awesome) the husband kids had stuffed mushrooms, cheese sticks, chicken pasta and the grilled salmon.  All five of us devoured our meals and appetizers.  No room for desserts...had the pizookies the last time and they were fun but not good enough to make room for.  Will return to BJs centennial again and again.  We like the cleanliness of the place and the neighborhood is great.  We used to live in Vegas and loved this area."
Diane D.,"Menifee, CA",0,8,,1.0,2/28/2014,"Worst pan pizza ever, dried up and tasteless. Avocado egg rolls nothing like we've had before. Gross. Never again. If you drink enough, I guess it won't matter. Thought we'd give it another try. The one by us in Menifee, Ca was bad so we thought this one should be better. Wasn't."
Jill P.,"Howell, MI",14,7,,4.0,1/5/2013,"Totally delivers on what it advertises....good locally brewed beer and pretty good food.  Service, cleanliness and decor is great....we feel very comfortable there...a step above TGIFs and similar places.  Been several times and will continue to patronize.  Recommend the Piranha Ale."
Tori C.,"Las Vegas, NV",69,16,1,2.0,12/13/2013,Service was okay. Food was horrible. I am an avid BJ's lover. I've always love their food. For some reason this time was just a horrible experience. The server ignored us most of the time. The food was barely lukewarm when it came out. I got a jalapeño burger that was soggy and wayyyy over cooked. Very unhappy with my experience.  I understand it's lunch time but jeez. Hopefully next time -if there is one - I will have more positive things to say.
Kim-Joe S.,"Las Vegas, NV",24,64,12,3.0,8/13/2012,We got the two person pizza deal for $20.  The pizza had a really good fluffy crust and the watermelon salad and the tortilla soup was really good.  We then finished it off with a white macadamia nut and oatmeal raisin pizookie which was also really good.  The server was friendly but we had to keep getting his attention to refill our water and had our appetizers but had no silverware to eat it with. There new beer nitwit was good and my wife had a white peach margarita which she really seemed to enjoy.  She ordered her second one and after about two sips we received the bill and only saw are waiter when he noticed the credit card.
Donovan G.,"Las Vegas, NV",15,5,,5.0,11/12/2013,Came to this place with family. Price is right for what you get. Desserts are famous here. I got the red velvet pazookie is was so delicious had to order 1 more. Service was alright . They just wanna turn around tables there. Other than that the hostess was very nice had to only wait for 5 minutes for a table.  and the server was showing his hospitality there. Good job
Chris S.,"Las Vegas, NV",35,22,4,1.0,8/22/2012,"Nasty place to eat, bad service, hair in my food, forgot appetizers, use to eat here a lot, it is bad now. Sickening hygeine."
Chris S.,"North Las Vegas, NV",0,3,,2.0,1/31/2015,"Decent service by our server. Terrible hostess, called ahead and was told thirty minutes, upon arriving only 27 minutes layers, we were told an additional 15 minutes. After receiving our pager, we sat and waited only to watch three other couples that arrived after us be seated. After thirty minutes I decided to check with the hostess where our name was, only to be informed that we weren't even on the list! Needless to say, that is very unprofessional and a terrible mistake. We were seated after noticing the mistake but the only reason we continued to dine here on this night was to celebrate my wife's birthday since this is her favorite restaurant, but any other night we would've happily walked out the door with no problem at all."
Colleen T.,"Las Vegas, NV",206,199,5,3.0,10/18/2012,"I've gone to this BJ's quite a few times, and evertime it has been alright. The food is ok- they have a wide selection of things which is good, but unless you know what you are in the mood you could be searching for a while.  My favorite item (besides the Pazookies) is the Fresh Mozzerella and Tomato salad in the small bites section. I've had a mini deep dish pizza, and it was good, but I haven't had many deep dishes so I don't know how it adds up to a real Chicago Deep Dish.  The downside is that this location is ALWAYS packed. I know it is newer to the Centennial area, but geez, it seems that every night everyone and their mom goes there so you are left with waiting for a while.  Service has been great everytime I go. I haven't had a problem with them yet.  Pricewise it could be a bit expensive if you go all out. The best deal is to get the Pazookie Trio and try three different types of Pazookies for half the price of one big one. The Small Bites section is pretty cheap; they use to have an awesome Seared Ahi Tuna dish that was a great deal. I guess it was such a great steal that they had to stop it because it is no longer on the menu."
Michael K.,"West Chester, PA",8,412,134,4.0,6/7/2013,Great brews on tap.  They have a small seating area outside to watch the sunset.  Food is good.
Derek H.,"North Las Vegas, NV",22,54,,3.0,8/2/2011,"This is a good neighborhood restaurant that does not disappoint.  There was a wait on a Sunday evening when we went so we just sat in the bar area instead. The deep dish pizza is really amazing.  It's light and tasty.  Doesn't leave that heavy pit in your stomach after you walk out. Do NOT get the Caprese salad as the appetizer.  It was average and nothing you wouldn't whip up at home.  Very mediocre. Don't go out of your way to eat here, but don't avoid it either :)"
Danielle S.,"North Las Vegas, NV",0,47,,2.0,8/8/2012,"Honestly?  Don't come here.  We've been going to the BJs location in Summerlin for years, and that location is FAR superior.  Every time we give the Centennial location a chance, we're extremely disappointed.  It is worth the extra drive to get to the Summerlin location. First, the service here is always bad.  We always have to wait ages for drink refills and orders.  And, literally, every single time we've received something incorrect when the food arrives.  And I'm not talking about something small - I'm talking about an entirely different entree being presented than ordered. Second, the ""to go"" service is equally horrid.  The pickup times are never even close to being correct, i.e. told 20 minutes and waited 50.  Plus, the food tastes drastically different from when you eat in versus take home. We've decided to stop giving this location anymore chances.  An extra 20 minute drive to the Summerlin location is WELL worth it."
