Ms. P.,"Las Vegas, NV",4,48,23,5.0,4/24/2013,"Very good food and service,  Great variety and unique flavors.  Forty minute wait, but they served food to waiting guests.  Now that's class!"
Zachary C.,"Las Vegas, NV",13,21,,5.0,7/15/2013,great selection of beer and food. Love NITWIT and if your feeling froggy for dessert the pizookie is bomb
Glenda R.,"North Las Vegas, NV",150,47,170,2.0,5/21/2012,Overall service was ok. Hostess that sat us had to question if we were certain we gave the right party amount number. They tried to sit us in a booth where only 4 Adults sit. We were a party of 6 with one child. A Manager came out and saw how cramped we were and moved us. Other then that overall experience could have definately been better. I had Tortillia Soup- which had a very thick consistency. Flavor was just ok. Sampler tray was delicious.  Server was good.
David L.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,14,,4.0,12/28/2013,"Sort of a mixed bag with this visit.  We ordered a Roasted Vegetable and Goat Cheese Flatbread Pizza (excellent and just the right amount of food), a Parmesan Crusted Chicken Sandwich (sandwich was pretty good, but I didn't much care for the fries), and a Chicken Quesadilla (overly spicy in a brassy way).  The service was great at the start.  But, by the end, the restaurant had filled up and we had to wait a bit just to get our bill.  Still, overall, a very good meal."
Shannon S.,"Las Vegas, NV",149,378,17,5.0,8/29/2012,Great food as expected from BJ's. Love the Jerry Burst and potstickers. Great service and awesome happy hour prices.
Kenny S.,"North Las Vegas, NV",8,54,11,4.0,5/29/2013,This is a great restaurant.  It has a microbrewery if you enjoy different beers.  I go there for the food and I love just about everything I have tried.  The avocado egg rolls are a must try appetizer.  The rack of ribs is the best for any restaurant in this price range.  And if you have not had a pizookie for dessert you have not lived yet.
Rob T.,"Centennial, Las Vegas, NV",0,5,3,5.0,12/7/2013,Just had an amazing dinner. BJ's restaurant great service and amazing time. My wife had the shrimp scampi pasta I have a lobster and steak was absolute fantastic and she highly suggest the cosmopolitans can't go wrong there
Stace S.,"Pasadena, CA",53,46,9,5.0,2/9/2013,"I'm bias about reviewing this restaurant because I love eating and coming to either this location and or the Summerlin location.  I think they have a great menu and drinks and whether you want a simple lunch or just drinks and dinner, you'd be set.  The only bad things is the wait sometimes but if you come with 2 or 3 people you can usually snag a table in the bar area."
Necole S.,"North Las Vegas, NV",67,5,,4.0,6/23/2013,"The wait was CRAZY, but it was the weekend and several prom dates were there so I  can over look that, the pizza was great, the drinks were awesome, the service was amazing, the pizookie was wayyyyy too sweet.  I would opt for a different dessert."
Lori L.,"Issaquah, WA",140,18,,4.0,8/8/2014,When excellent food and service meet all your expectations it deserves recognizing. Our server was so friendly and informative. She was able to answer all our questions about the specials and entrees. The food came out quick and was delicious.
Juliet K.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,26,1,2.0,7/21/2014,"Like a lot of local places it was great when it opened but then they get the business established and everything changes.  They get lazy, service slips, food quality becomes inconsistent and so as a consumer you are in the dilemma of having a 50/50 shot of having a good experience... or not.  Don't like those odds and so prefer to just go somewhere where I know it will be good without the guesswork.  It gets very noisy when busy especially when there are kids and screaming babies!!!!!"
Jen J.,"Las Vegas, NV",6,23,,1.0,11/28/2013,"Not for breakfast! Not many choices and omelet was way over done.  I mentioned this (very nicely and with no request or expectation of a particular solution) to the server who apologized, said she would tell the kitchen manager, then didn't come around much. There was no offer to correct the problem or at least comp beverages. We never saw the manager, even just to check in about the issue.  Then the server just kept saying ""I really hope you'll come back"" in a way where she was almost waiting for us to say we would.  What I wonder is why would she expect us to come back to a place where we were dissatisfied, expressed that dissatisfaction and the only action taken is to tell the kitchen manager...  so it doesn't happen to someone else?  I don't typically go back to eat at places where the food was bad, especially if nothing was done to address it with us."
Tracy H.,"North Las Vegas, NV",10,23,,5.0,6/6/2012,Customer service is always excellent here. My husband and I LOVED our meals so much we ordered more food to go to eat for dinner. I also got a couple drinks and they didnt skimp on the alcohol.
Gary W.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,4,,5.0,8/6/2013,"The food is always great, no matter what I get.  The wait staff is attentive and their service is top-notch.  I always go during lunch it seems a lot busier at night.  I plan on going at least once every couple of weeks."
Terenna T.,"Los Angeles, CA",402,171,84,3.0,7/14/2012,"It took me 5 in a half hours to drive to Vegas from California and this is the first place I stopped to get a bite to eat.  The waitress was great and the service she gave was attentive.  The food on the other hand was average and there was way too much cheese in my pasta for my fork to pick up an average size bite.  I enjoyed myself with the friends I was with, but if you go here, tell them easy on the cheese in the pasta."
Donna S.,"North Las Vegas, NV",6,9,,1.0,9/8/2013,"If you are going to B.J.'S for their deep dish pizza, this review will help you.  We went to BJ's on Labor day at 4:00 p.m., my husband had a coupon for 50% off their pizza. We had to wait 15 minutes before being seated.  There was lots of tables, but very few waiters.  We ordered the BJ classic deep dish pizza, which would be $24. 00 if we did not have a coupon.  We waited 40 minutes to be served a deep dish pizza on a platter with raw vegetables.  The picture in the menu shows deep dish pizzas in a pan with lots of melted cheese and cooked vegetables.  We were so hungry that we started eating until we noticed no sauce on the pizza.  We spoke to a manager who stated they don't .put sauce on the pizza they have seasoned tomatoes. As far as the vegetables he agreed they needed to be cook more.  He took the pizza away and said they would remake it with sauce and cook vegeables.  We waited 45 minutes when they rushed out of the kitchen to tell us they had to remake the second pizza because it cracked in the oven.  We tasted the 3rd pizza, and there was no more sauce that the 1st pizza and the vegetables were still raw.  We gave up, and left the restaurant with the manager writing off our pizza.  We came home and I reheated my left over dinner from the nite before that I had made homemade.  My husband thinks B.J.'S is using frozen pizzas that they just add to what the customer had order. I could have bought a better frozen pizza and add my own toppings. If you are there for happy hour drinks, than this review is not helpful for you.  If you want deep dish pizza BEWARE they are way too over priced for their pizza."
Monica N.,"Las Vegas, NV",108,65,23,5.0,8/13/2012,The menu is huge looks kinda like the cheesecake factory menu. The pizza was descent. I had the darkest beer they serve and it was amazing!! Artichoke fried hearts were okay but they were pretty cheap. Will be returning to try the infamous cookie dessert. I LOVE THE CAPRESE salad and for only 3.95$ this place is great!!
Dailyn M.,"Las Vegas, NV",43,20,15,4.0,6/10/2012,We go here pretty often. Always a good meal and little one looooves the skinny French fries and Mac and Cheese.
Joey U.,"Las Vegas, NV",21,36,22,4.0,9/30/2011,"Love this new location, mostly because it is close to the house. Usually come here for a few drinks and dinner with friends. It is usually busy around the normal dinner time 6-8pm. I love the lunch specials. Smaller portions but filling. I normally order a buffalo chicken pizza, grilled chicken pasta, or the BBQ pulled pork sandwich. Not all at once those are just a couple of favs. Great service. Bartenders are awesome. Oh yea can't forget the pizookie."
j p.,"North Las Vegas, NV",5,38,,1.0,12/8/2011,I find the staff needing more help in delivering service.  On my last two visits we ordered appetizers that never arrived. Both times I had been given the same lame excuss that the order had fallen on the floor and was being recooked. I found this to be rehearsed and not very beliveable.  The food arrived a bit cold and feel the staff may have been the same.
