Leslie M.,"Cypress, TX",44,56,1,3.0,4/26/2012,Food is great but we ONLY eat at the bar as the table service is not the best.  Happy Hour and special events will get you great prices on appetizers and discounts on beer/liquor but not wine - boo. Mini Deep Dish Pizzas are $5 on happy hour and are pretty good.  Ahi Poke is one of my favorites as are the salads.  Good crowd for happy hour.
Greg R.,"North Las Vegas, NV",11,83,4,4.0,4/23/2012,"BJ's offer curb side Pickup. So call ahead if you're planing on taking some home. If you're dining in, Explore the Beers and Ale. Also you owe it to yourself to try the Pazookie (Dessert). Nice place for a Date night. As far as the Pizza, its NOT authentic Chicago style Deep Dish but its OK. Enjoy!"
Nathan L.,"Las Vegas, NV",140,126,31,5.0,7/17/2011,"Great looking restaurant! Food was awesome and service is still getting into the swing of the new place. But, I give it 5 stars for being the best new restaurant in 89149. It will be even better when they have the outdoor seating completed this fall."
Shokouh H.,"Lake Havasu City, AZ",151,327,98,4.0,7/27/2011,"Wow, this place exceeded my expectations. I give their appetizers 5 stars. I always look for healthier appetizers and most places don't seem to have them. So sick of chips and dip and chicken wings for appetizer. We had the ahi pieces and the stuffed mushrooms and I really enjoyed both of them. The pizza pies were really good too. We had half Mediterranean and half Alfredo. So bad/good I don't have a sweet tooth and actually didn't enjoy the Pazooki, waaayyyy too sweet for me."
Karen B.,"Redmond, OR",6,18,1,3.0,7/28/2012,"Food was good, service was terrible. I usually try to cut the server lots of slack, especially when serving large groups, but this was ridiculous.  We had a two year old so we just stopped by a coworker's retirement celebration for a short period of time. But when my son got squirmy and we tried to sneak out early, we had to wait 40 to 50 minutes for our check.  The food was slow, it took forever to get things like a spoon for my son's applesauce, and the waitress made lots of errors on the bills and credit card charging (they wound up just making us wait until everyone was ready to go and giving us our check last. So much for slipping out early). Hopefully they are working out their new restaurant kinks and the service will get better."
Jeff P.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,29,8,1.0,7/2/2011,"Waitress had no idea what she was doing, food was only OK and they forgot my wife entire entre. Drinks and food is way overpriced.  All in all a bad experience. We won't be going back."
Cory J.,"Colorado Springs, CO",25,54,,5.0,11/17/2011,"I do NOT know where these negative reviews came from but this place was packed, people out the door, and had the best service I've had in a long time outside of a 4 star restaurant.   super helpful with the vast menu....of food and beer.  I had a pizza.  Off the chain for something that Vegas lacks.  I'd be back if I were from here ;-)"
victor g.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,16,,5.0,6/23/2011,I had an awesome rootbeer...no really.  The turkey cobb sandwhich was annihilated and the string fries were polished off.  The place was brand new when I went.  It was all good. I plan on going again soon.
Adam P.,"Issaquah, WA",98,7,,5.0,1/11/2012,"This place is awesome. Great food, great prices, friendly staff. Not to loud but still lively. Can't wait to go back. Nice place to watch sports. Their stout is creamy. Next time I'll get it as a desert beer. Steak is good but could be better. Good for the price."
James N.,"Spring Valley, Las Vegas, NV",2,18,,5.0,1/27/2014,"I loved the food here , and the beers are amazing! Esp there IPA. I'm seeing a lot of bad reviews on the service, I can't really say anything because I always sit at the bar, but the bartender is always good and takes good care of us."
Justin H.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,30,,1.0,8/8/2013,Used to love coming to BJ's to eat but....... what happened to the food ? Price of salads skyrocketed. And the new BBQ menu is the worst. The chicken and fries are sooo salty that we couldn't stand it. The waitress knew too. The pork sliders was so-so but the bbq sauce needs to be redone. Who ever did the taste test for their sauce needs to be fired ! This is their big promotional push for salted foods so you would order more drinks. This is not the BJ's I once knew. Your done BJ's.
John T.,"Reno, NV",13,12,6,4.0,1/22/2012,Consistently good. I almost always have the BJ Cobb salad. Added a clam chowder this time. Canned but still tasted good.
Dawn G.,"Las Vegas, NV",3,72,9,5.0,9/13/2013,Tonight was my first night at BJs and it was amazing. I had the grilled chicken stuffed potato.  My kids had the deep dish pizza.  Of course they loved the dessert. Who can resist ice with ice cream on top?!  I will def go back again.
Rebecca A.,"Las Vegas, NV",83,23,7,5.0,3/5/2012,"Everytime I eat here, my food and service is always wonderful. I believe her name is Amber (server) who is really attentive and gets you what you need before you ask. My favorite is their tomato mozzerella salad!! Sooooo yummy!"
Geddi R.,"North Las Vegas, NV",21,40,9,4.0,8/4/2011,"I love this place! food was great and the service was good. Pizookie is aaamazing! def  a good date night place, or even just to hang out with friends!"
K L.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,58,10,1.0,4/14/2013,"Just got back from a late lunch here. NOT HAPPY. First off it took our server 5 minutes to even come by our table to ask for our drink order. We got side salads, which had brown lettuce. Didn't get silverware, and had to stop a host to get silverware. Once we got our entrees, we didn't get ketchup, had to actually get up and ask another table to take the one from their table. Also didn't see our server once we got our entrees for about 15 min after we had our food to stop and ask how it was. My burger was NOT cooked to medium. The server didn't add cheese to another burger. Had to ask to get a refill. Just all around bad food and bad service. And, our server only had three tables, so it's not like she was swamped. I've worked in the restaurant business for 7 years, that was the worst service I've had in a long time. Skip this place and go somewhere else."
Michelle M.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,47,3,5.0,8/23/2013,I can't speak highly enough of this place!!!! Ammmmmazing food and service!!
Steven Y.,"Las Vegas, NV",28,54,13,5.0,7/26/2011,Great new place. Great food and friendly service. Baby back ribs were excellent.  My wife's steak was perfect. We will be back!
Kaye M.,"Redondo Beach, CA",84,21,,3.0,9/17/2013,"Fun atmosphere, decent all american food, 3rd time at this location, always crowded, no complaints."
Megan H.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,19,,2.0,10/4/2012,I have had the worst luck here lately. It used to be one of my favorite places to go. I always order the sweet pig pizza and used to love it. The last 2 times I've eaten at BJs the dough tasted pre-cooked and reheated and the toppings weren't cooked and the cheese was minimal. We also got the chicken Marsala and it was flavorless and the pasta was stuck together and undercooked. I think I'm done with BJs. The kids menu is great but I can't justify spending $50 on a meal when Pizza Hut is better
