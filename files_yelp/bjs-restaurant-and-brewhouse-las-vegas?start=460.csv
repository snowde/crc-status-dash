Ryan B.,"Las Vegas, NV",5,39,1,2.0,3/6/2013,"Horrible in comparison to other BJ's locations I've been to. I asked our waitress, Candice, for silverware and napkins at the same time my (first) date and I ordered drinks. Drinks came, no silverware. We then ordered an appetizer, no silverware after asking again. Then we ordered our entrees, they came and we still had no silverware or napkins. I don't know why I left our waitress a tip, she didn't do a damn thing. We had three different people bring out our food, none of which were Candice. There was a blonde spiky-haired guy, that brought out our appetizer, he spoke in the most ridiculous fake New York accent; awkward at least because he was loud as fuck. Horrible start to what I was hoping was going to be a good night with a fine young hunnie. Seriously upset I paid $58 for this crap, should've just taken her to Cane's and gotten better service from a high school kid. Bullshit. Their fries are garbage and from a bag too."
Munki M.,"Las Vegas, NV",105,41,4,5.0,10/8/2011,"For the price, atmosphere and selection... cannot complain... this is new addition. BJ's decided to add in Vegas from 2 to 3... GREAT!"
Pearl H.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,6,,5.0,8/15/2011,"Haven't been to BJ's in years and tried this one with my family.  Loved it! Great food, great service!  The best is their new portobello mushroom pizza and their best beginnings appetizer! Let's not forget Pizookie!  But it can get crowded so go early!"
Ron D.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,9,,4.0,11/24/2011,"Good selection of tasty beers.  I have eaten there a couple of times and we were seated quickly, served quickly, and enjoyed the the experience. Give it a try I think you will like it."
Stephanie R.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,15,,1.0,6/14/2012,"Not sure how anybody could find this place good. Plenty of service and smiling faces, but you know that its not going to be that good when you ask the hostess "" What is good to eat?"" and they have no response. Menu was way to big. Took 10-15 minutes to get a couple of beers. The beer was good and cold, but I think I would rather have a Draft House beer. Had a side salad that was swimming in water and dressing took a few bites and put it at the end of the table. Shared the sliders. Over cooked meat on a bun that was was to big , no onions or pickles, just bread and meat. Also had a pizza, not a lot of cheese or sauce so it was really dry. We decided to use the rest of the gift card on a couple of beers, wasn't going to try anymore food, it took another 15 minutes to get a couple of beers that we had to down quickly to make our movie on time. Won't ever eat at this place again. Gross!"
Sam T.,"Las Vegas, NV",139,185,15,2.0,10/2/2011,"Was surprised that I had to drive around the parking lot 3 times to get a parking space. I thought that would be a good sign, alas it wasn't. The wait was only 15 minutes and once we were seated the waitress came over right away and took our drink orders. I tried the dark beer flight. When that came I was surprised that nothing was really outstanding. Out of all 4 beers I would say that the Nutty Brewnette was the best. I ordered the Blond battered shrimp, and my better 9/10ths ordered the chicken marsala. She was very hesitant to order it because she has had amazing C.M. from another restaurant in town. My shrimp came to the table and there was 11 on the plate! Unfortunately the shrimp looked like they were smashed flat to about 1/8"" and they had a very hard crust that was the batter. They had a somewhat weird taste. The 1/4 cup raminkin that the coleslaw came in was hot and so was the non dressed purple cabbage. I don't care for hot coleslaw so that wasn't eaten. My wife's chicken marsala was drowned in marsala on a bed of tasteless green beans. Overall service was nothing spectacular, because after our food came to us we had to sit and wait for our silverware. I say the place is packed for some reason, but I don't believe we will ever be back to find out why."
Rosalind C.,"Los Angeles, CA",105,137,60,3.0,1/6/2012,"I had dinner at this location with a friend during my vegas Holiday trip. Since there's not too many in AZ whenever I can visit one in another state I jump at the chance. We went on a Sunday night and it was pretty crowded so we decided to eat at the booths in the bar area so we wouldn't have to wait. Our server was very attentive and was a good sport to put up with my friend's crazy sense of humor. I decided to start with the pomegranate margarita and ordered their Cajun pasta with shrimp as my meal. I like BJ's for the reasons why I like the Cheesecake Factory; tons of options and they're always consistently delicious. My pasta was huge,  I ate a large serving and still had lots to take with me for leftovers. For dessert my friend and I shared the baked beignet that was warm delicious and the perfect ending to my meal :-). This place is pretty solid so I may think about driving out of my way to visit one here in AZ."
Melanie H.,"Las Vegas, NV",23,4,,1.0,10/12/2011,"The food is good, but the service is appalling. First time we came her service and food were great. Second time was horrible. Service got worse and worse and we waited 40 minutes for our dessert. After saying something to the manager who delivered our dessert, she gave us a $15 gift card and begged us to come back. We did and the service was bad yet again. These servers seem to disappear for long periods of time almost like they are on break or something. We came one last time today and it is our last time. Our waiter took a while to greet us. We then ordered drinks and an appetizer. Waiter returned with our water and said our drinks would be right up. He then disappeared. Another waiter approached us after 10 minutes or so and asked if our waiter had taken our order. We said just our app and he took our order. He then tracked down our waiter who had completely disappeared. The manager finally brought our drinks from the bar. Another person brought our appetizer. Waiter came by to check on us while we were waiting forever for our entrees and said nothing about when our food would be ready.  Someone else delivered our food and my pasta got cold looking for our server to come by so I could ask for more sauce, parmesan cheese, and fresh pepper. I finally flagged down the waiter that took our order.  Someone else brought the items.  It took forever to get our check and refills on our water from our actual waiter. It s too bad they can't get their act together. There is a great need for good restaurants in the Northwest. Guess we will have to wait for a new one to open. Will not return to BJ's."
Stephanie H.,"North Las Vegas, NV",15,11,,2.0,9/26/2011,"We went to the Centennial location to celebrate a birthday.  There were 18 of us, and we called ahead to reserve a table and to give our servers amble opportunity to prepare.  The food was great, but it arrived at different times, so we didn't eat at the same time.  We would order drinks, and it would take a half hour to receive them. We asked that the tickets be separated when we ordered (each family sat together). They weren't, and although we said it was fine, that we could figure it out, our server insisted on separating them.  It took her over 40 mins to fix them.  She had to redo them 3 times!! The manager tried to make amends, as three of our orders were wrong (we got those free), but he shouldn't have had to.  If I were him, I would have a training class to show how to wait on large groups. I'm sure we'll go back, but never with a large group as we were there a total of 4 hours!!!"
mick m.,"Las Vegas, NV",57,145,2,3.0,7/4/2011,"This is a mixed review. Have been to BJ's twice now, this was the second excursion Actually give the food a 5 and service -2.. This is a new BJ's for the valley. Will say out of the box the menu is vast and all offerings at great. Both of us had salads..and they were fantasic...so no quams about the food...My rub is w/ staff. This is a new restaurant and hoping they are just working out the bugs so will see in the future. Our hostess met us and we as she said ""strolled"" to our seating..It was a very, very slow stroll. If I had known where we were being seated I would of walked past her. We arrived at 4:20 pm..my concern was if we would get to our seat before the dinner rush. Other rube was severs/wait staff are overly attenative. She must of interupted us 7 times during our 1 hr dining experience..she was way over the top. After she presented us w/ the bill she actually returned 3 times w/ in a 5 min period to try and collect.  Be watchful where your seated. If your adverse to small children/tikes around you..I come for a pleasant dining experience. If you are seated in the area furtherst from the bar area you might find yourself in a child day care area, with screaming children and parents who think thats cute....Don't bother asking for comment cards to express your concerns they don't have any."
Amy T.,"Las Vegas, NV",11,51,1,5.0,9/3/2011,"We have been to this place twice. Service and food are outstanding! The first time they were very busy but our wait for a table was less than five minutes. Our server was a tad slow but we didn't mind as it gave us time to look over the menu. She was super friendly and helped me make a selection. I got the tilapia. The husband got the jumbalaya. Both were so good. They do their own rootbeer and cream soda and I can't say enough about those. You can actually taste the butterscotch in the cream soda. The second time we went was a Friday night. They will not accept reservations for a party under 10 but if you call before you arrive they'll add you to the wait list. We called half an hour before we left the house and added our name to the list. When we arrived the place was packed to the point that people had to wait outside. We walked right in and they had a table for us. No waiting at all! We got some very dirty looks. lol  Despite being very busy our server was attentive and quick. I got the thai salmon covered in mango salsa. Amazing! Husband got the chili burger. My friend got a club. We were all so into our food we ate in silence for quite some time. I tried their black cherry soda. It was really good. The only gripe I have is that I ordered their gluten-free pizookie at the end of our meal. I got it to go. They did make us wait a bit for that and later, when we opened it up, we discovered the pizookie was not cooked. It was just a doughey mess. I was very disappointed by that. I had also expected it to be somewhat bigger. It is $5.99 and really just an oversized  cookie but not so big that I'd call it a pizookie. I won't be ordering that again. But we will for sure go back to BJ's for a good meal."
Jeff K.,"Renton, WA",0,24,,4.0,5/6/2012,"I read some of the reviews that mentioned slow and not so good service, long waits for food n drinks, etc,,,,I had a good experience last night about 6pm,,,(it was helpful I arrived well before 6pm and the dinner rush),,,i was able to get my name (party of four) on the seating list quickly and it was within minutes I was called n seated, our server and the expediters seemed fairly prompt and organized and the foods n drinks seemed timed appropriately.  The food quality was very good (one tilapia dish and one top sirloin dish) but the pizza was needing some work, I wouldn't order the pizza as it didn't appear to be their strong suit (such as throwing a few pieces of pepperoni on a pepperoni pizza order).  It was interesting that their menu offers just about everything, but they practically only have one type of dessert called 'pazookie' which is really good if you love semi cooked cookie dough w/ ice cream on top, be advised the pazookie pan is hot out of their 350 degree oven and is scalding hot, yeah I learned the hard way, I have never been to BJs before and the expediter server didn't say anything to me when she placed it on the table.  Our server seemed nice enough, good attitude and pleasant enough and he was efficient w/ just about everything, only forgetting one drink which was promptly served when reminded,,good job to him.  (I really wanted some cheesecake for dessert after a steak dinner,,,I hope that BJs will add that to their menu)."
