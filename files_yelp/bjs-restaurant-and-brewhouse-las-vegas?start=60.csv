Jovan G.,"North Las Vegas, NV",40,39,49,5.0,8/26/2016,Had a GREAT salad and clam chowder soup. Awesome customer service. I LOVE this place and will be back soon.
David L.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,7,2,1.0,8/1/2017,Worst BJ's I've been to  I was there for 3 hours in the middle of the day on a Monday  After waiting an hour just to order we get our order placed and wait 30 minutes for our food and the server completely forgot about my sons food and then we wait for another 30 minutes just for his food to get to the table. It also took another hour after we got the last of our food that was messed up by the way to get our check and pay. And the whole time we were there we only got one water refill.... never will I go to this BJ's ever again...
Edgar H.,"Glendale, CA",29,12,2,1.0,6/26/2017,"Terrible terrible terrible.  I've been to so many BJs across US from Ca to Tx, this one was by far the worst one.  Service was great and my waitress was sweet but my chicken in Mediterranean deep dish pizza was old and had a funny taste to it.  Can't believe they use old chicken, as a shareholder im definitely going to file a complaint with management."
Elizabeth J.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,3,,4.0,9/13/2017,"Got seated quickly, double pork chop was delicious, but not so kid friendly establishment. No complaints on the service.  Dessert is out if this world! Perfect end to a long day!"
Rhiannon F.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,7,,5.0,9/13/2017,"I don't come here often, but when I do, my friends or family and I enjoy sitting in the bar area. Justin, our server, was absolutely phenomenal. He was super friendly, knowledgeable, and on top of everything. Aside from excellent service, the food was delicious. Can't ever go wrong with the deep dish pizza. Next time I'm in, I hope we have Justin as our server again because I know we won't leave disappointed!"
Baker Chick H.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,38,11,1.0,11/11/2017,"Yes, it was Veterans Day and yes it was busy. However, there is no excuse for waiting to be acknowledged at our table, the server taking our order before our beverage order was ever taken, serving Fried Calamari cold twice, a soggy Santa Fe Salad that was mixed with the dressing so far in advance that the Romain lettuce was soggy. A fresh tossed salad looks like it has been freshly tossed when the lettuce is still light and crisp not in a heaping mound that resembles a salad in a doggy bag I brought home from a restaurant the night before. When the server took our order I asked for extra dressing on the side. It didn't come when the food was delivered so I asked for it. Never came. I asked another server. It never came again. I ordered the Santa Fe with the salmon option. After taking several bites I see that instead of removing the chicken for the salmon I got both which was not a tasty combination. My guest ordered the clam chowder in the sourdough bread bowl. The soup arrived in a plain dish. We told the server it was suppose to be in a bread bowl. He said to start on this one and he would bring another in the bread bowl. It came shortly after. Then to our surprise another server shows up with a clam chowder in a bread bowl ready to set it on the table. By this time I was so disappointed with this restaurant and quite embarrassed I even suggested bringing my parents here for Veterans Day. After this EPIC FAIL saving $$25.95 was no bargain. They made a poor first impression to new customers and changed a previous customers desire to ever return. The server took the calamari and clam chowder off our bill. Still the whole experience was a disaster! By the looks of things, I bet they did a lot of ""taking the item off the bill"" tonight. Management, cooks and servers will be chalking this up at the next preopening meeting."
Nicole G.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,2,,1.0,11/11/2017,"This location should be ashamed the way the treated a veteran on Veterans Day. My father went there on Veterans Day to order a meal that was supposed to be free. After waiting a long time he asked where his meal was, they apologized and said we must of served it to the wrong person. He was irritated and said he'd leave and go to another restaurant. The manager didn't offer to pay for his 2 glasses of wine ($13) or anything, he only offered to put the order in again. How disappointing."
Joe R.,"North Las Vegas, NV",45,209,52,4.0,2/22/2017,"Came here for a cold beer and a small bite to eat.  The staff was friendly, beer ice cold and food was good.  I would come here again."
Shannon Y.,"Las Vegas, NV",481,356,1607,4.0,10/29/2015,"Bj's has a great Tap beer selection.  I like how they also feature a few local Las Vegas Brews like Joseph James and Tenaya Creek.  The Bartender didn't seem to know much about the wall of taps except the one's brewed in house by Bj's.  That's ok I guess no one likes an overachiever anyways. The location in centennial hills is always busy.  I have never been here with out having to wait for a table for 25+ minutes. Service is decent and consistent.  The menu reads like Tolstoy's  ""War and Peace"" with over a 1000 pages.  I find large menus incredibly annoying.  K.I.S.S (keep it simple stupid) I bet they could get three more turns on each table a night if they did not give you a novel to select your dinner from.   The food at Bj's is always decent.  Some creativity goes into the dishes to make the flavors come out.  I find myself always going for a burger but the Deep Dish Pizza is good also.  Overall solid place to have a consistently good meal.  They have some great happy hour specials on appetizers and $1 off on beers.  My favorite part is the great Beer selection.  Enjoy!"
Nicole F.,"Las Vegas, NV",444,154,1233,1.0,5/17/2016,"Came here for happy hour which is 5-7PM. Their happy hour menu is limited and you can only have it at the bar which mean max 6-7 people can come because there isnt enough seating at the bar for a big group. 7 of us were forced to cram onto a small table, so there wasnt enough room to put more than 2-3 dishes on the table at a time. 1/2 off small deep dish pizzas which can feed 1 person (4 slices) and 1$ off wine- we had to order 6 pizzas for 6 people. The beer wasnt even worth getting on happy house so we just got pitchers cause it was cheaper. But they do brew their own beer here.  Recommend: Hefeweizen and the Stout. Blonde taste like water/coors light/bud light- nothing special. We ended up ordering the flat bread, calamari, nachos (which we didnt know were on the menu) and drinks as well as 5+ deep dish pizzas. THE DEEP DISH PIZZAS ARE TO DIE FOR! i mean i can tell they were clogging my arteries as I ate them but Damn were they delish the flat bread was ok, calamari was not bad, the worst thing was these half ass nachos that came with a small dollop of sour cream and even smaller dollop of gauc. Plus it didnt have meat on it just a haphazard mix of beans and cheese. Def dont recommend the nachos The reason this place gets 1 star is due to 1 person and 1 person only: THE BAR TENDER NAMED TREVOR Heres the story: My friend who was getting married had never tried a car bomb. I decided to get her one. This A**hole TREVOR decides to pour use 1/4 of a pint of Guinness and then 1 total (1/2 shot jameson and 1/2 baileys). To all that have ever ordered a car bomb: IT IS  1 PINT of GUINNESS 1 shot of Jameson poured into the GUINNESS 1 shot of baileys on the side.  (Yes and I realize there is more than 1 way to make it but this is the way I've had it for the last 10 years- and my mom used to be a bartender!!!)  For those our thinking this is just me and my friends trying to get more alcohol or that it was about the money- it is not. I WAS MORE than willing to pay for him to make the drink I was accustomed to.  Anyways I go to the bar explain to Trevor this is not a car bomb and he argues with me saying it is that if he pours more Guinness that the cup will over flow. This guy is trying to serve me some Shitty 1/4 cup guinness and wants my friend to drop her shot glass into it where it will shatter and she will literally be chugging shards of glass. He tells me he wont do anyting about it so i call the manager who finally fills the PINT up only 1/2 way because TREVOR is a douche and he cant say no to the manager even though he knows well that it is supposed to be 1 PINT full (although when I asked the manager he never had a car bomb- so i dont blame the manager). And to prove to the manager I google the recipe and showed it to the manager and told him, his employee was arguing with me to which he did NOTHING. HORRIBLE SERVICE and management. I mean i just showed you the recipe and your going to tell me that Im wrong and not have your employee fix the drink? TREVOR is incompetent and TREVOR should be fired. The guy cant even make a proper drink.  DEF dont recommend getting a drink from him. And if you do check cause he has not had training with bartending. For all i know he said he put the 1/2 shot of jameson that was supposed to go into the drink, but for all i know he is lying and there was no jameson to begin with. NOT TO BE TRUSTED HORRIBLE bartender, service was decent from our waiter (a filipino guy).  Bottom line- a few more ounces of Guinness wasn't going to screw over his tab, but it was going to make me and my 6 girlfriends very happy- esp my gf who was getting married! And Trevor really ruined our experience there. He choose to fight with me instead of providing good customer service, all over a few ounces of beer.  TiP if you decide to get past the horrendous-ness that is TREVOR, download the app: 1) you can pay your tab on it 2) you get reward points toward future visits 3) you get a free dessert which you can redeem if you show to your waiter- We got a free Pazooki"
Melinda S.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,9,,1.0,9/10/2017,"Never going back. I ordered a pulled pork sandwich and I should have sent it back when I saw it - the pork was not pulled - it was cut into chunks and drowning in honey barbecue sauce. I couldn't eat it as a sandwich and when I bit into the ""pork"" it was gelatinous and tasted nothing like pork. It was disgusting. When my husband told the waitress (who was amazing, by the way), she told the kitchen manager who came to the table and threw so much attitude that I felt attacked. We weren't asking for a bill adjustment or a discount - we felt they ought to know. After we got rid of the kitchen manager, the waitress offered to get someone else for us to speak to and we asked her not to say anything to anyone else.  If I could give less than one star, I would."
Jeanne L.,"Las Vegas, NV",5,14,4,4.0,9/17/2016,"I was here two days ago for lunch and was very happy with the food and the service , I love their crispy fries. I had a cheeseburger with guacamole on it and it was to ""die for""! I also had their lightest Craft beer which was perfect with my burger. The waitress was so accommodating and friendly!  I have only one suggestion: don't serve a burger that will get messy on top of a paper napkin because it almost disintegrated and mixed in with the food so you are apt to eat some napkin along with your food.  I will definitely go there again and it is close to my home so that's a plus! I would definitely recommend it."
Chelsea W.,"North Las Vegas, NV",77,55,92,1.0,1/1/2017,I have always spoken highly of BJ's Brewery but enough is enough. This is the 3rd time I have contracted food poisoning. The first 2 times I thought.... hoped it was a fluke. The first time was from the chicken lettuce wraps.... second time ahi tuna salad... and just this Friday the derby salad with chicken. Don't get me wrong the food is great and they have a little of everything for everyone's taste. The service is usually outstanding and the atmosphere is wonderful. But there is seriously something wrong with the way the food is handled or stored. They really need to take this more seriously. I will not be back. Eat here if you want to risk having regrets later.
Mac H.,"North Las Vegas, NV",0,5,13,3.0,3/4/2017,Bjs is a nice restaurant to have a family dinner if you are not in a rush. Service to get seated just takes way to long and it doesn't have a lot of waiting area inside.  It's dark inside the restaurant so it's hard to see what your eating. The food is very good and never had a problem with our order! Had one bad waiter one time but besides him every other waiter/waitress was very friendly!
Brad C.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,20,,2.0,6/23/2017,"Well this place is hit or miss, we usually go here once or twice a month and it's rarely consistent. I always go with the Ahi Tuna salad which was a mistake this trip. The salad tasted and appeared to be a few days past it's prime. My kids enjoyed the chicken tenders, however; my wife's food was cold so, another and final strike for us. Unfortunately we won't be returning for a while after this trip. The staff is always very friendly but overwhelmed with tables."
Tyrone S.,"Las Vegas, NV",162,1,,1.0,12/30/2016,So i decided to come for a quick drink and lunch before work. I sat down at the end of the bar near the entrance and waited for about 8 minutes to get greeted. I watched the bartender jessica take care of 3 guests before me including 2 new guests that sat down 2 minutes after me. They recieved a greet within 30 secs and beers within 1 minute. Crazy. I finally made eye contact with her and she asked me what i was drinking. I told her an irish pear and then asked for the manager. Didnt make a big deal just wanted to provide him with feedback. Other than that I love the food. -TY
Eric D.,"Las Vegas, NV",87,34,25,1.0,7/13/2017,Should have checked yelp before I went. Now I know why.  Slow service. Got my in house beer wrong TWICE. Saw two groups of people sit down then get up and leave. Who does that? When I talked to the manager all he said was sorry I'll let them know. Just get the ziti and pizookie. Paid $50 bucks for shit service. I probably won't be back to this location again.
Rina D.,"Mesa, AZ",1,23,45,3.0,11/4/2017,"First of all, the hostess who sat us was very rude and inefficient by not providing us with utensils. When I asked her to bring them, she rolled her eyes and took her time to the point where I ended up asking someone else. Her name was ""Brianna"". Heard she was new so she is still a long way from showing appreciation of her job by showing great customer service with a smile and having a great personality. Luckily, we were waited on by a very friendly waitress named ""Jennifer"". She was very attentive and eager to serve us with outstanding customer service. Too bad that the chicken wings that we ordered was still cold on the inside (kitchens doing). We didn't eat it and made sure to let her know. She was able to take that off our bill. Awesome! If it weren't for the great service provided by Jennifer, it would have been a very disappointing visit with our favorite family restaurant. Thanks Jennifer! Two thumbs up to you!:)"
Nash R.,"San Fernando, Los Angeles, CA",0,15,2,5.0,10/22/2017,The service was outstanding and the food was great as usual. I was in a couple weeks back and we had this server a male. Very difficult name to spell when looking at the bill. Anyway he was exceptional even ran after us outside when my girlfriend and I forgot our food.
Denise C.,"Las Vegas, NV",60,3,6,1.0,11/8/2016,"First time eating here and the last!!!! I posted a pic someplace on here. I don't usually yelp but this i had to. Very disappointed.  ...Chicken tortilla soup looked like dish water with a scoop of guacamole floating around! Service was horrible.....every single drinking was glass empty most of the dinner. No joke, this was one of the worst experiences ive had at a restaurant! The manager was called over just so i can show him the bowl of ""chicken tortilla"" soup i was served. All he said was it looked over cooked and he would talk to the person who preps the avocado...."
