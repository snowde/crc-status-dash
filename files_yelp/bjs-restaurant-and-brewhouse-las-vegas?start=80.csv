Taylor B.,"Las Vegas, NV",78,1,,5.0,10/15/2017,"I have been going to this location for a couple years now with okay service. But today I had Anthony as my waiter today. He was absolutely amazing. The best waiter I have had hands down in years. He was so attentive, and gave us plenty of options. Hold onto this guy. I will be going here more often because of him. Absolutely awesome."
Daniel A.,"Las Vegas, NV",15,91,14,3.0,12/2/2016,Buy one get one?!? Good enough deal to get me to go eat at a sit down chain.  The visit was pretty much as expected. The staff was awesome and nice. Our server was really busy but did an excellent job.   The food is what it is. Most everything taste like it was frozen and all the soups have the same consistency like they came from the same base and then had different ingredients added. It's a little pricey for what it is but I would go back just for the buy one entree and get one free that yelp kicked down.
Marie C.,"Las Vegas, NV",117,206,328,1.0,9/27/2016,"We came hoping to take advantage of happy hour before it ended. With about 5 minutes to spare, Kim (server) quickly sat us at a bar booth & offered to get an order in for us. Unfortunately Thea app we chose didn't count as HH pricing. So, we order our drinks, a small plate app & our pizza.  Kim states she will get our app (queso & chips) out first to enjoy before our dinner. After waiting a very long time for app, I start to get concerned they are going to bring our app & dinner out together, we tell Kim it's taking a long time for chips & dip & if they're going b to bring them out back to back, we don't even want the app at this point. She stated she would go find out what's the delay is & let a manager know of the issue, and come talk to us. A few minutes later, our app comes out...and sure enough, a couple minute after that, our pizza comes! The guy who brought our pizza didn't even say anything. He quickly out it down & left. Not even a ""do you need anything else?"" Actually we did!  Kim came over, we reminded her we wanted ranch on the side. She quickly brought it & said she was going to remind the manager to come by the table. Seriously, your manager needs a reminder?! The place wasn't that busy!  Eventually the manager decided to stop by. I don't know her name, because she never told us. She squatted by the table as if she had no idea why she was there. I tell her the issue, her response was like, ""oh bummer"". No effort to see how she could improve our experience.  Management should know how to handle a situation & attempt a customer happy. The evening continued to go downhill from there.  As for the food, the queso was just ok. Deep dish pizza was good."
Brittany H.,"North Las Vegas, NV",0,2,,5.0,10/23/2017,"Let me just say, James P. has the best service I've ever received. He was such a nice person and went above and beyond to make sure everything was perfect for our night out. I love coming to this BJ's because I know that we will always have great service! Bj's is so lucky to have a server like you!"
Sara B.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,25,13,5.0,7/15/2017,"We visit the BJ's quite often and have always been happy with our food.  The service has really gone to top notch in the last year.  The Asian Chopped Salad and the Fish and Chips are the bomb!  I usually get one or the other.  My husband goes all over the menu...burgers, fish and chips, flatbread pizza.  The Paloma is the best one I have had in Las Vegas.  What would be totally awesome is bringing back the fried portobello mushroom appetizer.  Hint Hint. .  Aside from all of this, I have to give a huge thank you to the staff.  We, 9 times out of 10, go here with my sister and my nephew.  My nephew is a Wounded Warrior with a brain injury and in a wheelchair.  Every single staff member greets him and asks him what he would like.  Some may think this is not a huge deal, but it is to him.  We have been to restaurants where he is talked over, like he is not there.  Thank you BJ's for making his dining experience a normal one."
Kurt H.,"Las Vegas, NV",37,14,,5.0,7/29/2017,"One of my favorite places to eat! I have never had a bad experience at BJ's. Love the variety and quality of food. My favorite dish is the root beer chicken wings, with a side of avacado egg rolls."
Parker L.,"Las Vegas, NV",322,22,47,4.0,9/30/2016,"BJs is always a safe place to take friends or family for dinner. They offer everything from salads, to pizza, to pasta, to burgers, etc. They are known for the pizzas and pizookie desserts, so definitely give those a shot."
Jessie O.,"Las Vegas, NV",97,48,30,1.0,9/2/2016,"Wow, this is the first time I feel like if I could give a review with negative stars- I would. The horrible customer service that your takeout section provided me today, leaves me baffled because usually I love coming here for takeout and everyone previously has always been so nice.  Today I walked into your takeout section, was was blatantly ignored by your staff. Including a guy in a button up shirt, who I'm assuming is a manager? I walked in and stood there while they continued their conversations with cellphones in hand. Almost as if they were waiting for one of their other coworkers to make contact with me so they would be forced to help. Talking and laughing amongst each other and having personal conversations while helping me. Just so unprofessional.  I came in, and although I made my order hours in advanced- when I got there my order wasn't complete....I ordered HOURS in advance. I get it, it may have been busy and no biggie I can wait a couple minutes. But then the girl helping me, asked the other girl to go grab my side items- it made me feel like I was a nuisance and she didn't even say sure! I'm sorry about that! Or of course no problem! It was a scuff and then came  back with hardly anything in my side cups.  I just can't believe it, and as a manager I HIGHLY recommend that you review your staff and retrain them on how to deal with customer and guide hem on customer service.  NOW I JUST GOT HOME AND MY ORDER ISN'T EVEN RIGHT. You seriously have got to be joking, they put the wrong condiments, sides.  What a crappy experience that deters me from supporting you guys. Oh well."
Cirimille P.,"Las Vegas, NV",291,4,7,3.0,7/7/2017,"I've always been a fan of BJ's restaurant and usually enjoy coming here. However this recent visit, the food quality was not up to par. I ordered the Seared Ahi Salad and the fish was chewy and seemed to taste a bit old. A fellow family member ordered spaghetti and meatballs, and the meatballs ended up being burnt but the garlic knots were undercooked. I've never had an issue with food here before, so I'm wondering what happened this visit. Our server was wonderful and so helpful however and the manager also spoke to us about the food issues and resolved them."
Jamie O.,"San Antonio, TX",1,12,5,5.0,7/3/2017,Had AMAZING Service!!  Anthony was our server and he went above and beyond what any server has ever done for my family.  He brought a cider for me to try that he thought I would like and he was super attentive!  Our food was fantastic and everything was so nice!!
Jimson N.,"Las Vegas, NV",105,21,2,2.0,9/24/2016,"They need to up their take-out customer service and not act like robots. I've come here a few times to dine in or do take out. But lately, the take out dept has been slacking. I don't need to go to details other than then needing to be more consistent and improve their service.  It's like they're in their ""I just work here attitude"".  Well if that's how you're going to represent a company/brand chain restaurant then maybe customers should look the other way for something worth far better than what they would experience here.  Maybe I'll give them a month or so to improve and then I'll come back again."
Megan A.,"Honolulu, HI",86,7,4,2.0,5/27/2017,Meal was going great until our server Jennifer came over to our table 5 minutes after dropping off our check and told us that we needed to sign our check so she could go home. We were still in the middle of eating our dessert. Poor display of customer service.
Kyle R.,"Sioux City, IA",76,14,,1.0,9/13/2017,"BJ's is honestly a restaurant that I've been dying to try for many, many months. Tonight the opportunity to try it out finally came up, and it left me wishing I chose Fire Rock (up the street) instead. I'm honestly not sure what time I walked into the restaurant, but I do remember the host recommended we sit in the bar. A few minutes passed before we were greeted. When I server dropped off the water and Sierra Mist, he pitched the happy hour menu. I checked the time to see if it was worth it, and it was 9:54 PM. We decided we'd order food off the regular menu when our server came back, and I'd order a beer off the happy hour menu after 10. It felt like a lot of time passed, so I decided to check the time. 10:14. 20 minutes had passed, yet our server never came back to take our order. No one even stopped by to help. By this time I was starving and couldn't wait any longer for food. We ended up walking out and grabbing fast food down the road. I've heard nothing but negative things about the service here, but I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt. Turns out the rumors were true. I can't even say I'm mad. I'm just epically disappointed."
Jeanette P.,"North Las Vegas, NV",0,11,,5.0,7/20/2017,"First time there, we were impressed. The wings were great and Clam chowder in sourdough bread was great. Service was very good and attentive, of course we had to have the Peanut Butter Pizookie o complete the meal"
Chelsea A.,"Las Vegas, NV",905,6,,5.0,10/23/2016,"Kim was our bartender Sunday night and was the tits! The pumpkin beer is awesome and she gave us amazing recommendations. If you come here ask for KIM!!!  Excellent customer service!  This is DJ, I agree, Kim was the tits. The service was exceptional, the salsa was enlightening, and I feel like I truly understand the meaning of life."
Joe P.,"North Las Vegas, NV",2,6,,1.0,7/28/2017,"This is our third straight Friday eating at a BJ's. First time it was the Summerlin location, the follow Friday it was the Henderson location & this Friday it was the Centennial location & third time was not a charm.  My wife put us on the call ahead list & she was told it would be 15-20 minutes when she checked in. She informed the hostess of her desire for a full size booth, not the little, barely enough room booths they have. We had to wait over 30 minutes for our little booth & we only got seated after she went back & asked how much longer. There was an empty full size booth across from where we were seated & when we inquired about sitting there we were informed that a 4 person party was being seating, which was a lie. They seated two people 15 minutes before the other two people in their party arrived. Which restaurant sits half a party at rush time, BAD ONES!!! So we're seated & order a pretty simple dinner, two salads & boneless wings. Well the salads came out without dressing, no lie neither salad had dressing on them & the wings had the wrong sauce. To top it off one of my pet peeves happen, my glass sat empty for a while, empty until the waitress finally came back with our salad dressings. Instead of going into the kitchen for our dressing when she notice it was missing she filled ordered & came back with a tray full of glasses & our missing dressing.  Lastly they ran my card twice, but good thing I get alerts each time my card is charged.  As I said we've been to BJ's on three straight Friday & we will not be coming back to this location anytime soon."
Byron G.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,11,,4.0,7/15/2017,"Overall the food is pretty good. Like most of the reviews say, the service can be slow. This place gets super busy. So do most of the restaurants in this area though. I think too many new homes and not enough major commercial centers to handle them all. There are a lot of people working here but I see them all overwhelmed.   The Raspberry Lemonade is really good and refreshing. So is the root beer, and most of the beers I have tried. I haven't ordered anything on the menu I didn't like. And the menu is huge."
Mark K.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,34,,1.0,10/15/2016,"We went here to watch my college team and have some snacks.  We asked to have the game put onto one of the screens and put in an order for some food. They came back saying the game was blacked out. I said no, it is on ESPN.  They finally put it on over at the screen at the other side of the bar. We made a few trips back and forth with our drinks and food, and sat at our new table. We look up and they have switched it again back to the other side.  We had to again move our drinks and food across the whole bar to our original table.  They kept turning the game off, and we had to keep making them switch it back.  During the game we ordered $34 worth of food, and it was all pretty tasteless.  Nothing I would order again.  Finally with 2 minutes left, they switched from our game to a hockey game.   We gave up and left.  I would not go back there for the food, and certainly not to watch a game. Wanted to update this review. After posting, someone contacted me from the restaurant. They invited me to give them another try and said they would email a gift certificate within a few hours. It has been days and no certificate.  I think this is a further reflection of a disorganized bad place.  Keep your coupon!  There are lots of better places in town. Why waste your time and money here!"
Christa C.,"Chula Vista, CA",540,39,16,2.0,8/25/2016,"Silverware and plates were dirty (had leftover residue from hard water? or were not properly dried). The food runners kept bringing the wrong food to our table bc the server input the party next to us as our table, so we had to keep sending them away. Service (everything from refills, checking up) takes forever both times I've been to this location. Three of us tried the unlimited soup & salad (+$2.95 for the massive bread bowl) with tomato bisque & clam chowder. Loved the tomato & mozzarella salad over the Caesar salad.  +1 star bc if you do a quick Google search, you can get a free pizookie or appetizer :-)"
Ms G.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,68,39,1.0,5/22/2017,"Not impressed. The night we were a party of 4. The wait alone was a nightmare, because it took 40 min to get a table. We were finally called and had to walk past vomit on the floor. That should have been a fore warning to leave. But, the franchise has the great reputation so we stayed and ordered. The waitress was a little too talkative after she learned the couple in our grouo are from Germany.  After receiving my chili before the rest of the table, she learned they entree they ordered was taken off the menu.  Tacky, tacky. Smh They had to wait another 15 minutes to get served.  Overall, not a good first impression."
