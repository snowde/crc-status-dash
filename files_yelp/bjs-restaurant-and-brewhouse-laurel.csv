Rashonda J.,"Laurel, MD",32,48,108,4.0,8/25/2017,"I have been to this location more than once. I have always had great service and good, tasty food. I recently started transitioning to becoming vegan. For my most recent visit, it was easy to choose vegetarian options from the menu.  I chose their Italiano Vegetable Penne. It was delicious! I would definitely order this entree again. I'm sure the salads are great, but I'm glad I chose this over a salad. For dessert, my friends and I decided on the Pizookie Trio - mini churro and white macadamia nut pizookies. So good!!"
Sonday K.,"Brandywine, MD",28,40,80,2.0,10/17/2017,"I don't know where to go with the star rating. Went this past Friday. Long wait. Service was okay. Our wings came out looking pale. We got half dry rub, half hot. We all bit in to give it a shot...cold! Almost frozen in the center. Gross! We told the server and she just gave a look and asked if we wanted new ones. No apologies.  We got our main dishes before the wings were replaced. The manager did come with new wings and an apology and took them off the bill. The wings looked COMPLETELY different... Actually like the picture on the menu but much less meaty. So how did the first batch make it out looking so pale? They were fully cooked this time but the meat is gross like they were cooked from frozen and contain a lot of fluid that was cooked out when actually cooked.  Look, I'm all for bar food. I will eat bar food with my beers (the beer was good though! Only reason for one of the stars) but come on. This stuff is gross. It seems so promising. There are so many things to choose from on the menu. The roast beef was full of gristle. My kid refused to eat it. The flatbread pizza was okay. Hubby had the Jumbalaya, just okay.  The bill was high. Completely NOT worth it. I eat out often and don't concern myself with the price. If it tastes good, I pay. This was a total waste of money. I would only go back to have beer or sit at the bar before or after a movie. That's all I recommend you go there for!!"
Jessica B.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",142,326,1368,3.0,8/6/2017,"So, I tried to come here two times before this third time (first time it was close and the second time the wait was too long). Is third time the charm--hmm... It was a busy Friday night when we came in and while we were seated right away, I can tell that the server was swamped--because he would take a really long time to check on us and take our drink and food orders. I will say that he was polite.  We decided to do the beer flight and get dinner. For my entrée, I got the Cherry Chipotle Salmon and my dining companion got the Fire-Roasted Barbacoa Chicken. He enjoyed his meal--He noted that the chicken breast was tender but didn't care for the feta cheese. As for my meal, it was okay but nothing to write home about. I was hoping that the salmon would have had more of a kick since it has chipotle but it was pretty mild--more sweet than anything else.  Overall, it's not a bad spot but I guess you shouldn't expect fine dining or anything. This might be a better spot for HH--drinks and bar food."
Jackie A.,"Laurel, MD",26,290,,4.0,8/24/2017,"All pizookie's $3 tonight.  I'm starting off with this dessert, this time around - because this dessert is off the wall good.  If I wasn't trying to lose some extra pounds, I'd be eating BJ's pizookie's left, right and sideways!  A too big for one, though not wanting to share - caramel blondie brownie-like dessert, topped with large melty mounds of vanilla ice-cream and a fat drizzle of caramel. Started off with a feta watermelon salad, better than I thought it was going to be.  The sweet small chunks of watermelon and crumbles of feta, worked well with the sweet/zingy, minty dressing.  My prime rib sandwich was greasy goodness, though the accompanied horseradish dip, needed a bit more bite.  After my previous visit, I was hesitant to return and now I'm truly disappointed in myself, that I waited so long."
Kim J.,"Baltimore, MD",0,13,1,1.0,12/23/2017,I have been to this location every before for lunch and the service was horrible. I tried this location for the last time today. I ordered a salad and had fruit flies all on the salad. The waitress was very nice and apologized but i let her know i did not want anything else from there kitchen.
L B.,"Washington, DC",0,10,135,3.0,11/3/2017,Had the Chipotle salmon which was very good. Sat at the bar but the bar female bartender was not quite nice and took 10 minutes to take my order because she rather  talk when I said I wasn't ready. Service from her could have been much better but I still lefy a nice tip.
Kenneth C.,"Washington, DC",96,50,77,3.0,12/17/2017,"Some people don't know how to start or finish their reviews of this place. But that indecisiveness is not a characteristic of mine. I'll be blunt, frank, and straight to the point. There was a really long wait time, overall the food was a middling 1 star but the pizookie was a 5 star dessert so overall rating is a 3 star. My first bite of that oreo pizookie was a ""mother mary mercy me"" moment that I myself have rarely experienced when it comes to food. But by golly, BJ's knows how to give PJs - pizookie jobs, that is. Objectively speaking, pizookies, along with duck donuts, are the best desserts that you can get in MD."
Justin P.,"Silver Spring, MD",84,243,423,3.0,3/17/2017,Came here on a Wednesday and they have this burger deal with unlimited fries all day. So I definitely enjoyed that. Food was great! Beers were a tad bit on the expensive side but they have so much beer (and other drinks) to choose from. Definitely come here if they have a happy hour special or if you want to try different beers.
Ugochi M.,"Lanham, MD",202,111,169,3.0,7/15/2017,"We came in on a Friday night after happy hour. The host quoted a 25min wait and we were seated within that time frame. Even though I knew otherwise, the host kept insisting happy hour would start again at 10 . It was around 9 so we decided to wait it out a bit and ate. At 10:15 we asked our server if it was HH and she said no, as I knew. I wanted to slap the host, lol. Anyway on to food... My sis-in-law and I ordered the jambalaya dish, while my other sis was set on having a pizookie for dinner Lol.  She also later ordered the couscous Mac n cheese. I don't know WTH happened but my rice was soooo damn hard. It's like the chef literally took a scoop of uncooked rice and added to my dish. I was sooo hungry and didn't want the hassle so I kept eating it, hoping it was just a bad scoop. But NOPE! The whole dish was hard and uncooked. I mentioned it to my server who brought me out cooked rice w/o the jambalaya sauce tho, wth. I didn't make a fuss or big deal at all. The manager ended up removing the dish from my bill. Thank God Bc that was horrible. Strangely, my SIL w the same dish had perfect jambalaya. Her meal was well cooked and even tasted different from mine, so weird. Still hungry, I ordered the mini Salted caramel pizookie for dessert, so good. I got the chicken alfredo pasta to go for my husband and that was also good. According to my SIL, the couscous Mac n Cheese was pretty basic.  Our server was nice and attentive. I'd possibly come back here to try HH and definitely if I just wanted a pizookie for dessert. But idk if I'll be back for dinner."
Angel B.,"Waldorf, MD",387,119,270,5.0,7/10/2017,"I love this place.   Nice decor, decent atmosphere, all the food I've eaten has been delicious, lots of options, and the service is typically pretty good once you get beyond the host stand. The burgers awesome. the pizza awesome. they changed the fries. they are still good but the old ones are better. The creme soda is a complete winner. I've only had one of their ipa's. It was good, just not spectacular. Great place to hang out with friends and have a informal date. Its nice an open and there are tvs that you can see from most, if not all, seats. You're at the mercy of shopping center parking but worth the walk if you end up a lil ways away."
Christina O.,"Baltimore, MD",220,145,1315,4.0,12/30/2016,What more can you asked for ^_^ I came here for lunch on a Monday after my birthday with a friend. I saw online they had half off deep dish pizzas . So you know I had to jump on it!!!  The inside was pretty empty I guess because it was the holiday seasons. The atmosphere is pretty nice and modern. We sat at the bar and our server was very attentive and nice. He suggested some of their popular items from the menu.  I ordered the buffalo chicken pizza and my friend ordered the jambalaya and he said it was good. I had a taste of his jambalaya and he was pretty good but a little bit more spicy for my taste. The buffalo chicken was to die for! I will definitely ordered this again.  Just FYI if you're wearing heels be careful the floor doesn't have any grips so walk cautiously.
Justin G.,"Downtown, Atlanta, GA",6,63,3,4.0,12/11/2017,"Pizza Hut with out the grease! The pizza is ok, the toppings are really fresh! So much bread and crust on the pizza however! Also the pizza is extremely pricey like 30 dollars for one pie! That's is a lot of money for one pizza so I don't recommend this place for a pizza party. However they do have decent pizza, I probably will never return."
Demond S.,"Silver Spring, MD",108,191,387,2.0,9/30/2017,"Recently bought lunch here. I ordered lunch to go. Service was good at the bar while I waited. One of the items I ordered was the Ahi Tuna Asian Salad. I have ordered this particular salad a few times from another location 15 miles or so away. The presentation on top was nice.  You could clearly see the romaine lettuce and ahi tuna with the dressing and wasabi garnish on the side. Upon arriving at my destination for lunch, as I started to dig into the salad, I  found what appeared to be wilted lettuce, the white heart of lettuce (explained to me later), pickle-ish looking cucumbers (apparently were bad). This was underneath the fabulous presentation of the salad you could see. So of course I took it back and spoke to the manager. I am just surprised by the quality of food that came from what I understand to be a well established restaurant (chain)."
Jill S.,"Hyattsville, MD",86,296,657,2.0,9/29/2017,"It's great that they are opening more options for dining in Laurel, and the food here is good, but I can't handle how slow it is.  The service and the kitchen are incredibly slow.  Even during lunch, when the place is packed with people trying to get back to work after lunch, it's super slow...  The plus side is that they have a lot of options (besides pizza), from healthier salads and light sandwiches, to entrees, to gluten free options for almost everything including pizza, to desserts.  They specialize in beer, but also have ciders, cocktails, and wine.  The place is huge and can definitely accommodate large groups, as long as you don't care when you get your drink or food!"
Dexter S.,"Norfolk, VA",3,10,,2.0,11/23/2017,"I used to go to the one back home which was pretty solid. I decided to give this one a shot here in laurel and it'll more than likely be my only visit. The beer flight was still pretty good, I actually like their beer. The tavern pizza ( I think that's the name)was overpriced and not crispy enough. The server was absolutely trash, the bar area was somewhat busy he spent no time on us. I was forced to flag him down to even serve us which took a while. It seem he'd rather please his other customers first, maybe thought we weren't worthy enough or something. Gave it a shot but I wouldn't recommend it, especially with all of those other restaurants nearby."
Kim S.,"Temple Hills, MD",147,315,599,4.0,10/25/2016,"Monday night. 845PM. Nice crowd. Waitress was kinda out of it. She barely raised her head to speak to us. She managed to ask us if we wanted a table for 2 then she gathered the menus and walked off. Being the jerk that I am, I didn't follow her. I wanted her to TELL us to FOLLOW her! lol She realized that we weren't behind her and she waved us over to the table. We ended up asking to be seated somewhere else. She mumbled. I thought she was hilarious - my man, not so much. Food was delicious. The ribs were fall off the bone good. I could've used more BBQ sauce. I asked for some onion strings that I saw piled on a salad and the chef obliged #happiness Server was great. Price was right. I'll be back again and again."
Tisha S.,"Capitol Heights, MD",537,341,214,4.0,3/24/2017,"We came on a whim looking for quick bites before the movie.  We was able to get seating quick at the bar. Never been here before either.  Bartender was very attentive, and even changed a game to the middle tv to make it easier for some guys next to us to watch.  We ordered the sampler and it was great.  They even have mules from around the world... We going back tonight"
Katrina L.,"College Park, MD",558,198,638,4.0,8/4/2016,"Sometimes, I think people have Maestro's Steakhouse expectations at places that have much lower price points.  Get real, and know it is what it is. BJ's is not going to deliver world-class gourmet food, but it will deliver tasty cheap American fare and good drinks.  If you're coming here expecting anything other than a step above TGI Fridays, you and your wallet should head North on 295 in search of something a little more ""high-class"". Because I know who and what BJ's is, I feel comfortable delivering a 4-star review. I've never personally had bad service here, and I've always left satisfied with what I ordered: be it a burger, a ribeye, tacos, wings or pizza - it's all good in the hood of Laurel for me. It's a great place to enjoy company - whether it be on a date or out with friends, and eat a good meal that won't hurt your wallet."
Aisha P.,"College Park, MD",61,101,136,3.0,2/19/2017,"I came here on a Saturday afternoon after a friend of mine chose this place to meet up. Our original place was vetoed because she was bringing her baby and the other place was too small and did not want to deal with the hassle. So, we came here and it was packed! The only table available at the time we arrived was a table right by a baby shower, which at the time, we thought we didn't mind. But, it may have been a bit much. I say all of this to say, that this may have impacted our inconsistent service.  Our server seemed new, or maybe he was overwhelmed. But, our service was patchy and slow. At times, he would come back quickly and other times, it would take him long periods of time before we even saw him and that was usually the times we needed something the most. My friend ordered the appetizer sampler and I ordered some calamari and wings. The calamari was average in taste, but chewy; and the wings were pretty good. I will likely get those if I ever come again.  I also ordered a pear cider and they brought me something totally different. When I realized it, they switched it out. It was weird that they made a big deal to come back and tell me they were taking the other drink off my bill. Uh, of course you are. You brought me the wrong drink and I only took 2 sips of it. Yes, that should be a given, not a perk. Also, my silverware was dirty, but the server took so long to come back after our food arrived, that I never got a chance to swap it out. Luckily, I didn't really need a fork. But, yeah, our server disappeared after we received our food and we had to flag him down to get a check and he took about 20+ minutes to come back to process our check. He did have some help as it seems the manager was walking around helping; the manager was actually the person who changed my drink and took my order.  So, in sum, it was an average experience. I like to think that service would have been better had it not been so packed and we weren't sitting next to a baby shower. However, I would have liked some more ""check in"" from staff. The food is average American restaurant fare, nothing spectacular. But, it is a nice, affordable spot to just stop in for an average meal."
Kris W.,"Waldorf, MD",0,9,1,3.0,1/6/2018,"I really enjoyed the atmosphere of this place... the prices are fair and the bar has alot of seating which I like. I am giving this place three stars for a few reasons. I ordered three glasses of red wine throughout the night and everytime I received my drink the wine was hot. I needed a few cubes of ice with each glass. I am pretty sure it was because the glasses were hot due to them being freshly cleaned (which is great) it was just bothersome to ask for ice with each glass. The mozzarella sticks serving size is great for the price however you can taste the flour in them more than the actual flavor. I ate them but I feel they could have been better. Lastly the service was a bit slow. We started out at the bar and service was great and fast but once we got seated at a table, the service slowed down. I would definitely go back, just wanted to share my thoughts of where I think the restaurant could use improving."
Kelcie J.,"Annapolis, MD",20,17,5,5.0,9/18/2017,"Definitely one of my favorite restaurants. The place is huge and beautiful inside. It is always clean including the restrooms and every employee we have ever had is always very friendly. After 10+ visits, we have not had any issues with our food no matter how busy they seem to be. They have several gluten free sensitive options including a bun to enjoy their yummy burgers or sandwiches, gluten free pizza, gluten free warm Pizookie desserts and other GF entrees. They are doing a great job here and pricing is very reasonable."
Alfredo M.,"Joint Base Lewis-McChord, WA",1,3,1,2.0,6/21/2017,"I've been to BJs all over the country and this time they messed up my order pretty bad and took a little longer than I could tolerate. I ordered curbside and showed up promptly on the time I gave online. Now I understand that it takes a while to make the food and package it so I gave them the benefit of the doubt despite having an increasingly fussy baby in the back crying his head off. I let that part go and even gave them a tip. Now I messed up because I didn't look in the bag to check my order. My son was crying like crazy and I had a 20 min drive back home to start. Come to find out I arrive home and my sides for both my meals were missing. I am disappointed that someone didn't check the receipt before the order came out. I got home and do not have the energy to go back and explain the mistake. I'm very patient and will probably still go back in the future but I hope the staff reads this and at least brings it up to the take out crew. Food that I did get was good though. Update: burger I ordered had a old piece of avocado on it as well and the pizookie was also not good. Called them up to inform them of the missing sides, the burger, and the long wait time. The person on the phone was nice enough and offered a courtesy card for a free burger, but honestly I just hope they focus more on the curbside or scrap it altogether because I don't think this would've happened if I was standing there in front of them waiting for my order. Gotta say that the server that came out to my car was extremely nice and offered another free pizookie  I declined because of the crying baby in my backseat. I just wanted to get home."
Soaad A.,"Laurel, MD",36,10,,3.0,10/7/2017,"The pizza and pizookie are really good. I normally dont have issues with service, but I did one Friday night. Service was slow.  The waiter took awhile to ask us for something to drink and then 20 minutes for our order. We saw people  who came after us that got their food before us, but they had a different waiter."
Khoi N.,"Silver Spring, MD",241,257,644,4.0,1/27/2017,"A lot of my friends have been coming here for years for happy hour so I thought I'd give it a try. Food and service here is great especially in Laurel where it's rare to find. They have HH specials in the afternoon and late in the evenings. Typical American food here with craft beers and they have personal dish pizzas! I ordered the $18 whole rack of ribs special on Thursdays. It came with 2 sides 1 salad and dessert. It was a lot of food for $18. My friends ordered the fish n chips and baked ziti. Everything was delicious, seasoned well and the food came out quickly. This might be my new bar food spot in the area. Place was really busy when we came in the evening. Restaurant is great for large parties and families. Highly recommend this restaurant if your looking for some good beers, bar food and a place to catch any game"
Chantel M.,"Allentown, PA",88,46,19,2.0,7/9/2017,"Nice ambiance, but here is the problem with that it's too DARK!!!!!   I was able to see my menu because I was directly under the dim, dim lighting, the blinds were closed so no sunlight was coming thru to help see better, as I'm looking across my table I see my family as well as others at the next table using their cell phone flashlight to see the menu!!!!!   Next my waiter was all over the place, he would ask us a question and turn his head to pay attention to something else and had to ask us to repeat what we said.  Not to mention this place is way over priced.  I gave this place 3 stars because the food was not horrible, but wasn't great.  I honestly said twice after looking at the menu could we go to the Outback Steakhouse which was right across from B.J.'s I could have gotten a better, cheaper meal and not strain to see my menu"
Rotem K.,"Washington, DC",676,90,35,3.0,5/17/2017,"Went there with friends to watch the Wizards game. The TV screens are relatively small(for such a big space) so it wasn't a great choice. The pros -  1) many beer options 2) diverse menu 3) good salads The cons -  1) The service was SO bad. everything took forever. our waitress was so slow... The other waiters looked like they work in a good phase, actually. It was just our waitress who was walking there like she's on the beach. 2) pizza - really dry, not recommended. I guess I need to give this place another try before eliminating completely."
Daniel B.,"Laurel, MD",2,177,274,3.0,6/4/2017,I've been here two times and both times were ok but not great. During my last visit I ordered the great white pizza and my guest ordered a build your own pizza with pepperoni. I enjoyed my pizza but unfortunately my guest wasn't thrilled with their pizza because they put sasauge on the pizza and not just a few small pieces but it was overflowing with huge pieces of sausage.  My guest was too bashful to request the pizza to be remade even though she dislikes sausage.  The service was not great but not terrible either.  The server did come by one time to ask if we needed anything and did refill my drink one time.  The pizzas are way overpriced.  Our small pizzas were $14 each but smaller than a $5 Pizza Hut personal pan.
Christopher D.,"Frederick, MD",2,26,1,4.0,8/1/2017,"First time here the other night. Definitely a sizable layout/floor plan and nice bar area inside. Sat out on the patio which could have been a bigger space but the accommodations were nice and pretty comfortable. Service was quick and attentive, unfortunately I didn't remember to get the waiter's name. Good selection of food and drinks, menu almost seemed too thick to get through at firsts. Ended up keeping things simple with an app of avocado rolls which were really tasty. I had the Ahi salad which I really enjoyed and my friend had the spaghetti and meatballs which looked good. Both were very generous portion sizes. I definitely look forward to going back and trying some of the other items on the menu here soon.  I tried the beer sampler where you can pick 4 of their in house brews. I thought it was a little pricey for the smaller glasses (think DuCLaw) but otherwise I found a couple of like and ended up ordering a couple of extra beers.  All in all I enjoyed the atmosphere, drinks, and food. I do plan to go back in the future and check things out some more. Nice change from the usual franchise spots."
William G.,"Fort Meade, MD",0,2,1,2.0,10/21/2017,"BJs is a nice little spot. The atmosphere and over all vibe was nice. If you like sauce on your pizza, don't waste your time ordering any pizzas from BJ's. My wife and I ordered BJs favorite ""pizza"", and it was pretty much sauceless. As soon as I picked up my slice of pizza, my toppings were falling off."
Catrina P.,"Annapolis, MD",7,51,59,5.0,12/5/2017,"This is my go-to spot to hang with the girls. Nothing ever really wowed me. I always got what I expected and the food is consistently good. But, I never really deviated from my normal burger and beer. I promise, that is changing, from now on. This review is for the beer dinner that was held on Dec. 4th. It waa a 5-course dinner, paired with beers and palate cleansers. $40 prepaid online and $45 at the door. We started with the spinach stuffed mushrooms...OMG. Those things were great! Then we had some chili and a brussel sprout salad. They were good but didn't wow me. The prime rib...*angels singing* well seasoned, just the right amount of fat and cooked to tender, buttery, melt-in-your-mouth perfection!! The desert was some snickerdoodle baked thingy that was insanely delicious. We even got to keep our glasses. The experience was worth every single penny. They do beer dinners 4x a year. We decided we will be at Every. Single. One. The service was excellent and the manager leading the dinner was charismatic and engaging. Please, even if you're a regular, do a beer dinner. It completely changed my perspective about this place."
Tivona R.,"Laurel, MD",8,25,7,1.0,9/16/2016,So I ordered a entre sized blackened shrimp Ceasar salad................. WTF is this.  1. Entre size where? 2. Blackened shrimp? 3. This was $16.43????????? Ok....
Louis D.,"Woodstock, MD",9,11,,1.0,3/11/2017,Not happy with the service. The waitress is good but the length of time for food is way too long. We were seated at our table for 1.5 hrs before the food came out. We had a party of 10 but that's way too long for meals.  Oh and the table behind us with a party of 10 was seated after we were yet they received their food well ahead of ours. I've been to BJs before on a couple of occasions and have always had a good experience until now.
Love R.,"Greenbelt, MD",0,25,5,5.0,8/20/2017,"The avocado rolls are just wonderful! The pizookie is just amazing and the cucumber mint sparkling water is just refreshing!! My favorite dish used to be the baked ziti!! Omg!! Sooooo good Before I went vegan:-) I love that you can get on a waitlist, earn points and rewards, pay for your food all on their app! BJs"
Elise R.,"Mount Airy, MD",0,4,,2.0,10/8/2017,"We arrived pretty hungry. We've never been to a BJs before so were unaware of the giant tap list so my husband asked the man that seated us about the tap list. He looked at us like he's never heard ""tap list"" before and said I think its in the menu. My husband ordered a flight. The oktoberfest beer was skunked. He told a runner and our waitress. Both offered no solutions. My husband wanted the prime rib special but it was out so we both got a wonderful bison burger. We wanted to order the trio if pizookies but they didnt seem to offer the flavors we wanted in the trio. I asked the waitress which versions we could have in the trio and it was confusing. We finally settled on the peanut butter, monkey bread, and chocolate chunk. The only one of these flavors we were actually excited about was the monkey bread which was quite good, but the other two were raw in the middle."
Seneca U.,"Mount Rainier, MD",6,8,69,4.0,7/2/2017,"This Sunday's lunch, I was impressed with the quality of beer and the food they have, it is super excellent, one of the things I really like is the service and friendly atmosphere we experienced at this place. I highly recommend everyone to visit BJ's R&B. More over; I would like to thank the Bartender for her professionalism and dedication to perfection. She indeed made my day, taking care of us at the bar and making the experience very comfortable, encouraging us to comeback without a doubt. By the way, her name is Carolina and I am sure she will be the best Bartender for you on weekends."
Penni L.,"Rockville, MD",32,111,59,4.0,2/26/2017,"Today, I met with a group of Vets for lunch. We selected this establishment because it has a vast selection to choose from. Everything on the menu looked appetizing, which made it difficult to choose one entree. Each of us ordered something different and each of us really enjoyed the food; so much that we plan to return soon. The food, prices, food selections and staff are wonderful. I can't wait to return. See you in a few weeks."
Travis S.,"Washington, DC",2209,159,100,3.0,1/15/2017,"I decided to try BJs again since I came here before with one of my colleagues. Upon arrival it was crowded so I was able to secure seating fast. I'm not a rocket scientist but I couldn't understand why I was seated 10-15mins went by I didn't even get a drink order in. After getting up to mentally yell at the hostess, she finally sent someone to help. The server/hostess because that's who she was didn't have no social skills the thought just because she was young and smiled that we were suppose to roll over and ignore her tardiness and non management skills.  I finally ordered the root beer glaze wings and avocado egg rolls for an appetizer. I ended up getting the brisket burger as well. Please help me figure out why all came at the same time 35mins later to be exact.  We finally got a waitress she was awesome and kinda allowed my son to butter her up lol. Perhaps I came on the wrong day, in the end my brisket burger was fire. I would have given more stars if the service didn't start off so terrible."
J F.,"Laurel, MD",4,42,6,1.0,7/31/2017,"So the manager sent me a message ""reaching out"" about the bad service my mom and I got, but then never responded to any of my emails. So no, I shall NOT be back."
Carley M.,"Silver Spring, MD",17,160,216,4.0,3/19/2017,"Carolina was a great bartender. She had a few hard customers but was still attentive. My food was great and when i couldnt decide on a drink her recommendation was perfect. White peach margaritas go hard! Mmmm. The pizookie wws good too. Gluten free options, but i wish the spinach dip was gf too...there are no apps for people like us. Hopefully that changes. Otherwise good."
Mike B.,"Hanover, MD",2,24,9,2.0,1/6/2017,"Ordered the fish tacos, they came out within a reasonable time except they were missing the fish.  When i pointed out this small detail to the server she immediately took my plate to the kitchen to correct the problem.  When she returned, the kitchen had placed the smallest possible fish they could find in the middle of the taco.  Lesson, do not order the ""fish"" tacos."
