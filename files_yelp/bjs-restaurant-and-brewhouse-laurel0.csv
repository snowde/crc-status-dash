Banji E.,"Laurel, MD",1,8,,4.0,9/8/2015,"awesome service and great food. Loved the vibe too, makes you feel like ur not in laurel. somewhat pricy tho. Our food didnt take long and our server was the most charming person though i didnt catch her name. Most definitely recommending it to my fiends and relatives"
De'Leisa N.,"Washington, DC",128,233,24,3.0,3/11/2015,Much better service but still had to wait for refills and the check. Extreme Veggie Pizza good. I forgot the name of the dessert but the chocolate chip cookie with ice cream is the  . 5 stars. I worked it off by beating my boyfriend in Michael Jackson experience on the Wii...lol. Strong 3.5.
N I.,"Burtonsville, MD",0,24,,3.0,6/2/2015,"I came to BJ's shortly after it was opened since I love beer and brewhouses. Initially I was disappointed because their beer is fairly mediocre. I've tried a few items on their food menu and most of them were just ok, until I had their deep dish pizza and pizzokie. Those two things are the saving grace for this place.  I am not a huge fan of deep dish pizza, but their deep dish pizza dough tastes amazing. The pizzokie is amazing. I've tried several of them, but their oreo cookie pizzokie is by far the best.  Service can be hit or miss. There were times where they are really slow and not terribly friendly, but there are a few servers who really do a great job and make you feel welcome. Their mobile app is neat as it lets you ""call ahead"" your spot, and this place can get pretty busy on weekends. One thing that was disappointing is that one day they ran out of mini deep dish pizzas. I don't know that this is a fact, but if you can still serve medium or large pizzas, wouldn't you be able to make a mini pizza, too? Unless, you are using pre-cut frozen dough. If that's the case, that's pretty disappointing. It tastes great, but it just bugs me that it would be frozen or pre-made in some other manner.  I still return occasionally for a black & tan, deep dish pepperoni and ham, and an oreo pizzokie."
Krystal M.,"McDonough, GA",0,15,,5.0,5/6/2016,I love THIS PLACE. LIVE THE PEOPLE and live the food they are great the pizza is amazing never had the beer but heard it's amazing
Akilah U.,"Jessup, MD",5,30,41,4.0,2/20/2016,pretty good food and drinks (depending on bartender)-ive had to return drinks a couple of times. Service is good.
Tylvia E.,"Washington, DC",196,35,8,4.0,1/7/2015,"I have been here only once, and I plan to go back so I will probably update this review. One of my best friend's and I went here post-workout, so we were looking for some healthier options. I ordered the watermelon salad which was delish! The feta cheese and watermelon worked amazingly together. Next, we split the pork chops entree. I was great, and I would order this again.  My only complaint was the Brussel sprouts which were brutally roasted. No dessert this this!"
A W.,"Washington, DC",0,110,1,4.0,10/27/2016,"I returned to this restaurant in September, which was a few months after I had previously patronized it and reviewed it. The food was excellent. Everyone in my party enjoyed their food. Now, I ordered different food than last time (i. e., sandwiches and fries this time vs. salmon last time). I  was very happy with my food. Now, I'm not sure if on my previous visit, we just  happened to have a bad chef night  or if this time,  we ordered food in their wheel house. However,  I've upped my review to four stars and I will certainly return again."
Danyelle J.,"Baltimore, MD",203,198,264,3.0,11/7/2015,Very spacious! Nice big tables for big family size dinners. Happy hour pizza the best. The delivery of food was speedy. I think that the waitress could have been a little more friendly.
CanUHandleTheTruth S.,"San Jose, CA",2,4,1,5.0,5/5/2015,"Hoping they have change the new manager, until then Galaxy Nail Spa team won't coming, thx for nothing"
Jeremy C.,"DeRidder, LA",5,19,,5.0,3/7/2016,"I don't know why I haven't reviewed this place sooner. I go here every once in a while and typically try a new burger or some other red meat option and I always love it, however, I had their ahi salad tonight and was blown away. The ginger/lemon vinegrette was amazing, the ahi was seared to perfection and then chilled. Their beers are fine but I don't come here for the beer. If great staff and good food are what you're looking for, look no further."
Chris T.,"Laurel, MD",54,4,,4.0,7/2/2015,"I've been here 4 or 5 times now and while I have never had a bad meal, service has always been pretty terrible. I kept hoping that it was just because this was a new restaurant but a long while after opening, it still hasn't improved much. The food is always excellent and I have so far tried the fish and chips, the fish tacos and a bacon cheeseburger. My favorite has to be the pork chops though as they were outstanding.  I consider myself to be a bit of a dessert connoisseur  and the pizzookie is a very unique dessert that is unbelievable. I definitely recommend it."
Ravon H.,"WINDSOR MILL, MD",138,232,149,3.0,7/22/2016,Good beer and pizza. It's. A little hit and miss for the service. I went once and sat in the bar area and their service was outstanding. It may have been because it was just me though. The pizza I ordered was great and I like the house beer on tap. The second time I came it was with a large group and we sat in the dining area.  It was me niece's 33rd birthday and we had a event in the area so we decided to grab dinner here. I ordered wings and a side order of fries. I probably should have stuck with the pizza but I wanted to be adventurous. Service was much slower than the first time I was there. I chalked it up to the fact we had 10 people at the time and not one waitress.  When I got my wings they were cold and not very flavorful.  Beer was still good and I got a flight with 4 small pours to sample what they had. Over all I would probably be back for the pizza and beer. Hopefully the service will be a little better next go round.
Amber J.,"Washington, DC",33,153,43,5.0,11/14/2015,"We came on a Friday and it was a wait. We waited for about 30 minutes. We were greeted by a nice server who was accommodating. The spinach and artichoke dip was really good and piping hot, I have to come back for it :) We had the beer sampler which was awesome they give you some generous portions I'll be back for that too ! I  ordered some fish tacos which were ugly and piled with garnish. After sending it back I ordered the margarita flat bread which was good....overall they have many choices to choose from and my food was good....I'll be back soon...."
Mama M.,"Laurel, MD",2,5,4,4.0,11/24/2014,"Decor: outstanding.  Food: delectable Service: ummmm, dont know if BJ's is hiring experienced staff...Daniel (black lady with blonde hair) took and unusually long time to take my order....she does NOT know how to multitask....LOOOOOOOVED ERIC behind the bar!!!! Awesome personality and great bar artist. I'll be back....."
Tony H.,"Eglin Air Force Base, FL",0,20,3,5.0,6/12/2015,"100's of beers, awesome signature  apps & meals. Unique selection of pizzas. Hood for singles or a family and very affordable. Service is consistent.  Been here multiple times. Check it out"
Andrea F.,"Laurel, MD",141,6,,4.0,4/1/2015,"I've been to this restaurant a few times now, and I really enjoy it. My first time, I went during lunch with a friend and sat at their bar.  Since it was slow, the bartender was always there when we needed her. I enjoyed their deep dish pizza (which is now something I get every time), along with trying my friends BBQ Lunch Platter. The chicken was sooo good!! I went back another time with a  different friend. She was very indecisive, and despite being busy, the waitress was patient. She also gave great recommendations. I tried the deep dish lasagna, which I wish had more pasta. I found it to be a bit over loaded with cheese. My friend ordered a mixed drink that was recommended by the waitress as well. We found the drink to be entirely too strong and sweet, so it was hard  for her to finish. At my third visit, I took my boyfriend, who has a gluten allergy. He had the gluten free pizza and really enjoyed being able to pick his own toppings. I ordered the deep dish pizza again, and had a side of their fires (they are to die for!!) Overall we had a great visit, with one exception. We were seated near the bar area, where there was a large group of extremely LOUD women. Although that was no fault of the restaurant, it did hinder the experience just a bit. At my most recent visit, I took my office staff for lunch. I again had the deep dish pizza, but this time with a Cesar salad. My boss had the BBQ platter that I recommended, two of the girls has Chicken Club Sandwiches with fries but they were only able to finish half, as they were large portions. Everyone enjoyed their meal. Our waiter was slightly less attentive, but it was a busy lunch hour. One thing they did was constantly brought out new soda before someone would finish. It was nice but I found it odd they never asked if anyone would like water or a different drink. I have found that their food is great, and their service is sometimes a little off. Overall I really like this new addition to Laurel!"
Denny M.,"Beltsville, MD",6,15,1,5.0,9/26/2015,You can NOT go wrong at BJ's! When you want good food and good drinks locally in Laurel - head on over - sooo happy this was added to the Town Center. Absolutely everything we've had has been great! Call ahead!
Katie M.,"Laurel, MD",13,41,2,4.0,9/26/2015,"BJ's is a solid choice for late-night or happy hour dining, and a solid addition to Laurel Town Center. For seated dining, they can be a bit chancey depending on who your server is and what time of day you're there. However, I've always had good luck in the self-seating bar area in the evening and during the night. It's always fairly easy to find a seat, the service is standard bar service, the beer is cold and plentiful, and the food is better-than-usual bar fare. I love their different take on pizza and (of course) their pizookies. Altogether a solid choice, as long as you know what you're in for!"
Diane K.,"Laurel, MD",0,2,,5.0,5/24/2015,I should have stock in this company by now! I have made my way thru this huge menu and it is all excellent food! Not to mention the craft beer selection nice bar area also the service is great and I find I am going there exclusively with my besties! O I forgot to mention the non alcohol drinks such as peach tea have been highly recommended. I cannot say enough about this brew house! It's all good!
Darnisha T.,"Laurel, MD",175,32,74,4.0,12/19/2015,I was able to come here with my family for the first time. My parents spoke highly about this place. I tried the avocado egg rolls and I wasn't too thrilled about them. It had a kick but I felt like I've had better. I was able to get the BJ's classic ribeye with white cheddar mash potatoes and asparagus. That steak was everything!!!!! It was cooked to perfection. Great flavor and it wasn't dry. The mash potatoes and asparagus were great as well. I took some of my brother's fries and they were yummy. I tried some of my mother's sparkling raspberry lemonade and it was amazing. I recommend this place for anybody wanting a good steak on Laurel.
