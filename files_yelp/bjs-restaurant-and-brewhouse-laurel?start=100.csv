Nikki Y.,"Waldorf, MD",0,5,5,5.0,2/12/2017,"The food was great (including the hot coffee). As an appetizer had flatbread pizza (I can't recall the name) but it had a avocado, chicken and tomato. For dinner we had a burger topped with bacon, beef brisket and BBq sauce. We took a deep dish pizza to go. Try the homemade soda and the monkey bread and ice cream for dessert. The place was full so we sat in the bar area. The service was fast and the menu offered so many choices. If you're near Laurel, MD I highly recommend them."
Lilly E.,"Bryn Mawr, PA",2,95,82,4.0,8/5/2015,"Husband and I had been traveling for a few hours and after settling at our hotel went in search of some food. We didn't want to eat heavy since it was 9:30pm so we were just gonna have some appetizers and drinks. We were greeted by the manager who was very welcoming. Our server, Tamara, was super sweet and I asked her to pick me a nice crisp white wine and since they were half price that made it taste even better. She chose Kendall Jackson Chardonnay and it was perfect. Husband had Hefeweizen which he gets nostalgic over since he used to live in Germany. Then we ordered the fried calamari - perfectly cooked - wasn't chewy - it was golden. The garlic aioli dipping sauce was yummy! Husband ordered a flatbread that had bacon/chicken/avocado - he was enjoying it. I had the stuffed mushrooms - it was full of flavor - spinach pesto was very good! We enjoyed our time here and there was a lot of people for that time of night during the work week. If we lived closer we'd probably come here more often."
Terence P.,"Washington, DC",113,24,1,4.0,12/23/2016,"The crafted brews are REALLY good! I tried one called.Black Velvet, which was a mixture of BJ PM Porter and BJ Berry Burst Cider. Outstanding! And their New Orleans Jumbalaya was out of the world. For desserts, I recommend one of their Pizookies. It's an oven baked cookie topped off with ice cream. Eat, drink and enjoy!"
C A.,"Pasadena, MD",0,13,13,1.0,8/4/2016,"Wow. Ok, I had been warned by a friend about the service but decided to check it out.  Ordered appetizers. First came the calamari (lukewarm) chips and queso came 20 minutes later for whatever reason.  Waitress was almost nonexistent.  Every drink at the table was empty for awhile before she showed back up. The food might have been better warm and if the sides showed up - I mean you can't catch a burger going out alone on a big plate with no fries or chips?  If I go back I will probably sit in the bar area as it looked like they were a little more on their game in there."
Toya J.,"Greenbelt, MD",1616,406,357,3.0,4/13/2015,"BJ's is cool if you want a drink and a few small plates. Not necessarily the place you should come to expecting top notch food and quality dining.   The food 3 stars, the customer service is more like 4 stars.  When we arrived they were ready and prepared; took no time for them to come around and get our orders. The one lady waiter was holding it down, she was very attentive and courteous.  We were able to enjoy happy hour prices on our drinks due to a server giving us incorrect info over the phone a week prior; Happy Hour is from 3 to 6 then it stops and picks up later that night from 10 until. The server told us 3 to 10pm, so the manager Jared was kind enough to honor what we were originally told. This is a good place to come back to watch a game, drop into quickly. They have quite a few vegetarian selections and a lite calorie menu as well. We sampled the avocado rolls (spring rolls) served hot with a soy dipping sauce. I had the chicken lemon thyme dish with mash potatoes; sounded and looked better than it tasted, by sole reason of the seasoning and sauces being average. The chicken wings weren't bad; fried hard and crispy, drizzled with buffalo sauce and ranch dressing. My HH special lemon drops were decent. Not a bad choice for a casual group after work. It was cool, I can say for our first PG UYE this was a pretty good choice-a common meeting ground with affordable drinks  and food prices. I'd definately stick with happy hour."
Anik I.,"Baltimore, MD",1,10,3,5.0,12/14/2016,Fantastic food. Had a BOGO coupon that made it that much better but the food here is pretty great.
Rae M.,"Bowie, MD",340,377,524,4.0,4/10/2015,"What  a wonderful addition to the once desolate Laurel Towne Center. Located to your immediate left as soon as you enter the new shopping center, a small parking lot is adjacent from the restaurant, but your best bet is to park across the street in the bigger parking lot.  Myself and a few others planned  an outing here with a group of 11 awesome people, on a Thursday evening.  BJ's is known for their large variety of beers, I didn't partake, but I heard positive reviews about them. Our server, Caroline, was rather busy with such a large table of people, but she stayed on top of our table's needs. She did all this while being extremely pleasant and helpful.  With such an extensive menu, it was really hard to decide what to get. Who am I kidding, I'm on a pseudo diet, so I knew I couldn't order what I really wanted...a burger or pizza, so I  ordered from the ""enLIGHTened"" menu.  Every item on that particular portion of the menu is under 795 calories. I decided on the Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos with a side of bistro grains. I don't have a clue what the bistro grains were (even after I ate it) but the entire dish was under 700 calories and they were really tasty, so I wasn't complaining. My meal as a whole was actually really good. I could see myself ordering it again (clearly while on this pseudo diet though).   Our table also indulged on a few appetizers, one of which I can't remember the name of, but it was good. The one I remember was the avocado egg rolls and they were surprisingly really good as well.  All and all, a good time was had by all. The service, the food, the lively atmosphere,  and of course the fabulous company were all truly wonderful! I will definitely be back in the future...clearly after this ""diet"" has died down!  Beer and burgers....HERE I COME!   PS I love the colorful and festive bar area. Check out the HH. Happy Hour is Mon - Fri 3pm - 6pm / Sun - Thurs10pm - Close. Come in on Tuesday's, Half Off Wines all day. They also have appetizer specials for HH."
Deanna C.,"Cambridge, MD",75,18,24,3.0,6/29/2016,"Okay, we were greeted and seated very quickly!  The restaurant was pretty empty,  the hostess sat my party of 2 at a very large booth.  The table  had not been cleaned off, so she picks up the tray, sets down the menus without wiping the table and walks away. That was not okay, thus only 3 stars. The waitress was amazing and the food was delicious.  She was very pleasant & attentive!"
Hope L.,"Fort Washington, MD",493,284,847,3.0,4/10/2015,"Went here on a Thursday night to meet a group of friends. Upon arrival I gave the hostess our name for reservations, she looked up the reservations, told me she would be right back and that was that. She was gone for about 15 min. Finally another hostess came up and I asked her was everything ok and she said ""yes, she is getting your table ready."". I'm thinking geesh would've been nice if the 1st hostess had shared with me why she was leaving instead of giving me a weird look (like uh oh your reservation isn't on here), say she'll be back and leave me with thoughts of ""is everything ok? what's going on?"".  She returned about 15 minutes later and showed me to our table. It was a long table set up for about 15 people. Seating arrangement definitely could've been a little better. It was a little cramped because we were right up against a wall and the path between us and the next table was very small.  Our waitress came over shortly after and introduced herself. Her name is Carolina and she was a doll. Unfortunately, throughout the night you could tell that she was overwhelmed because we had to wait a good 20 min before we placed appetizer orders, she was gone for long periods of time throughout the meal. Especially at times we really needed her. Like to order more drinks, clear the dishes off the table, etc. The entire ordering, eating, process was long/delayed. I'm assuming they were short staff but I really don't know.  Here's what I ordered and what I thought about my food;  Cajun Pasta - I added shrimp for a extra few dollars. The shrimp were very small and when I am paying a nice coin for a pasta dish with shrimp I expect for my shrimp to look like what I paid for. That was a little disappointing. Overall dish was a little too oily but it was good. Not sure if I would order this again but if I do I would leave the shrimp out.  Santa Fe Spring Rolls - Filled with chicken, black beans, fire‑roasted red bell peppers, cilantro, sweet corn, jalapenos and jack cheese. Topped with pico de gallo and served with our Santa Fe dressing and avocado cream sauce. The wrapping wasn't crispy. Inside was mushy. Wasn't too pleased with this dish.  Ultimate Long Island Iced Tea - Weak. Tasted more Coca-Cola than anything. Wouldn't order it again unless it was a different bartender or s/he learn to make a good Long Island. Apple Martini - Too sour. The first thing I tasted was sweet and sour. Ugh! Was really off balanced.  I should have listened to my fellow diners who said the Lemon Drop and Cosmo were the best Martinis.  The Hostesses were very in-personable when I arrived. The person in this position is the first impression you get sometimes at a restaurant and I personally think you should be interactive with your customers especially when they first walk in. That wasn't the case this night because the both of them were very stand-offish when I arrived and didn't communicate clearly on what was happening.   The DINING experience was decent. Carolina did a good job. Wish they were fully staffed so that she could have tended to our table a little better. The DRINKING experience was disappointing. Bartender needs a little lesson or mixing drinks. Maybe I will return at some point but have no plans to do so anytime soon."
Meg L.,"Laurel, MD",8,94,124,2.0,8/31/2015,"To be so new, this place went down hill fast in my book.  Came here once and loved it. Place was new, food was good, people were nice.  2nd go around --- it wasn't worth my time & money. Food didn't meet expectations. Wait was long. We were rushed in and out #3 & 4 --- gave it more chances. Both times for happy hour. Was disappointed time #3 because appetizers were too expensive to be so small.  Skipped the apps and got burgers time #4... Couldn't finish the burger it was so greasy...."
Kee C.,"Washington, DC",19,40,165,3.0,5/13/2016,"Pros:  Nice establishment Lots of flatscreen tv's Fully stocked bar Nice seating Cons: On busy nights (Fridays), they tend to fall short in the service area. We ordered appetizers as we had a movie to catch and it took 30 min to get them. The mozzarella sticks we ordered were luke warm and required me to ask for a manager to have them either heated in a timely manner or removed from the bill altogether. The manager ensured us they would give us fresh mozzarella sticks in two minutes (and he did bring them out in a couple of minutes as promised). He didn't remove anything from the bill for the inconvenience, which was fine since we ate them once they were corrected. Overall, this place is nice for drinks and to kill time...but I wasn't a huge fan of the food."
Jerry S.,"Beltsville, MD",173,521,677,3.0,4/1/2015,"3.5 stars. It's a pretty new and pretty popular place. The first time I tried to go, there wasn't an open seat in the house. Comfy room, subdued lighting but there are downward spots so you can actually read the menu. The headliner here is, of course, the beer.  I got a sampler of four house brews for $7.95. All were well made, true to type, and just a bit edgy, showing that the brewmaster was going for good and not just good enough. Feeling hungry, I went for the full rack of baby backs. The ribs were tender and moist, with a sauce/glaze that was savory and just a bit sweet. Not a hint of smoke, though. A tiny bit of chiplotle would have gone a long way. Mashed potatoes were excellent in flavor and texture. The roasted Brussels sprouts were a great idea as a healthier choice, but poorly executed. They were quartered, which lead to uneven cooking, and dry. I use Jacques Pepin's recipe, using the slicing blade on the food processor and tossing with a bit of olive oil.  Service was friendly. There is free WiFi but like many places you need to open the browser and agree to the terms. There are some good HH specials, and quite a few lighter options. Fairly large wine list, but the prices seemed a bit high. Half a step up from TGIF or Applebee's, worth a stop but I wouldn't go too far out of my way."
Daniel S.,"Beltsville, MD",0,9,,5.0,1/11/2017,Best place to get a random Beer you have never had. I love the atmosphere here. Its a refined version of BWW with a stronger Bar.
Colleen D.,"Kensington, MD",277,22,,3.0,12/9/2016,"This place really isn't bad. I know that chains can be scary, but they actually have pretty good beer. I also ordered a flat bread pizza appetizer and it was yummy and filling enough to be an entree for me. Generally good place, good bar, and clean bathrooms."
Terry G.,"Silver Spring, MD",0,2,,1.0,1/1/2017,"Usually enjoy my experience  at BJ'S Laurel, but today was quite the contrary. From the cold reception upon entering to the server who seemed completely put out by having to wait our table.  When the food finally came, we had to continue our wait for utensils.  Meatballs in spaghetti dish were undercooked and pasta was mushy. Siracha rub was tossed on chicken and covered the entire plate as if it were an after thought. Had to ask twice for a manager before the person who finally showed never introduced himself nor did he offer a resolution.  Will wait for Grand opening of Columbia restaurant before patronizing BJ's again; hoping they can redeem themselves."
Leonard H.,"Hagerstown, MD",0,15,3,1.0,3/25/2017,"Really disappointed. Reasonable wait for a table- about 15 minutes. Was seated and waiter took our drink orders - they came fairly quickly. Then didn't see waiter for over 15 min. Finally got order placed - wait staff brought out the salad, placed it on the table, and left. But there was no silverware. Waited  for waiter to come by. Was a no show. After being in restaurant for about one hour, no food other than salad on table. Got the manager, expressed our disappointment with the sub-par service, and left. Went to Outback next door and had a great meal and experience. Loving me some ""No rules! Just Right"""
Helen R.,"Hyattsville, MD",0,19,11,5.0,6/25/2016,"Great food, great service. The ambient is chill, the staff is very attentive. My husband and I went there for the first time and order  appetizer, the avocado eggrolls and the cryspi calamari and they were yummy. Greats taste, fresh out the kitchen. The entree was also fresh i had the lime chicken and my husband had the sourdough soup (for got the name) but it was very delicious. And we also had the dessert:) everything look so good as you can see we order alot but definitely will come back again. I was not very sure on going here when i read the reviews but i walked out with a different impression!! I love this restaurant, one more on my fav list!"
Deana O.,"Rockville, MD",0,5,,1.0,6/25/2017,"Service is always slow even when there is minimal people here. Food seems to always get sent back,not just our table. Menu's are sticky and never clean. Food isn't that good either. Nothing to rave about."
Katrina L.,"Temple Hills, MD",16,6,14,3.0,4/9/2015,"This was my first visit. I ordered a strawberry mojito which took almost 30 minutes to get it. I couldn't taste s ny alcohol in it. It was more like  a strawberry lemonade. I was with a party of 10 people. The waitress, Carolina,  was a peach but was clearly overwhelmed with such a large group along with other customers because we had to wait at least 10-15 minutes before we saw her. It was almost an hour from the time that we entered the restaurant until we received our food.  The black and bleu house burger was pretty good but a little dry and the fries were greasy. The triple dessert platter was a sure winner. I had the cookies and cream cookie and ice cream. It was both warm and gooey with a perfect combination of sweet creamy ice cream. The manager came over to say hello but didnt ask us how we enjoyed our meal. It was an average dining experience."
Chandani C.,"Glenarden, MD",57,184,161,3.0,4/8/2015,"I went on a Friday night with two friends and understandably, there was a 40 minute wait. Luckily, the weather was nice that night so we just stepped outside and the time passed quickly. Our server was very nice, though he kept making jokes under his breath to entertain us and expected us to laugh, but we could never quite hear him so it just turned into an awkward 5 seconds of silence each time.  I am not sure if it was just a really busy night or if the kitchen isn't well staffed (or both) but it took foreverrrrr for our drinks to come out and then another foreverrrrr for our food to come out. This wasn't much of a problem for us since my friends and I had a lot to catch up on, but it's not the ideal spot if you are in a hurry. I ordered their jalapeño burger which was good (and huge!), but not far as tasty as the description on the menu makes it seem.   With all of the new restaurants in the area - there wasn't anything quite memorable about this one that would make me return rather than try out a new place."
