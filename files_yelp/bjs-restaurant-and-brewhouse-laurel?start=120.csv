Darylevuanie J.,"Laurel, MD",52,35,26,4.0,2/22/2015,Our Sunday funday date night included dinner at BJ's. We grabbed some drinks at the bar while we waited for our table. They text you when the table is ready. The bartender was very friendly. She suggested the 10 Handcrafted beers that you can sample. You can sample 4 at a time for less than $10. The beau's least favorite was the Nutty Brunette. Favorite was the Blonde. The Piranha was very good as well. I got the White Zinfandel. Can't go wrong with that.  We were seated as soon as we got our drinks and was able to have them sent over instead of walking through the restaurant with them. I got the Lemon Thyme Chicken with brown rice and veggies. Amazing! Low calorie too! Other than the fries being cold the beau got the double bacon cheeseburger and rated it an 8 out of 10. The waitress seemed as though she really didn't want to be there tonight. So the service was subpar. They have a very diverse menu. I love having options! I will for sure be coming back.
Cati C.,"Ellicott City, MD",53,1,,1.0,9/6/2016,Went here on labor day with a party of nine. Service was super slow from the start and after waiting an hour to get our food two of the people we were with didn't get their food because of problems in the kitchen. When their food finally came it was cold and they wound up just not eating. Also the manager and waitstaff was very rude and not apologetic for the mishap. Seriously disappointing experience
Reggie Y.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",164,2,1,2.0,12/7/2016,"I was looking all around town for a Deep Dish Chicago style pizza! I was excited when I found out there was a new BJ'S in Laurel that sells them. The ordering process was smooth and simple online. I created my own deep dish pizza that came to a total of $24. I wasn't to thrilled about the price, but I thought if it cost this much it must be amazing. You know the old saying, ""you get what you pay for."" Well in this case you don't! I got my pizza and was highly upset. It wasn't deep dish at all! Just thick crust! If I wanted a fake deep dish pizza, I would have went to little ceasers and saved $15! In conclusion, if you're looking for Chicago style deep dish pizza like they sell at Uno's, BJ's is not the place!"
G W.,"Burke, VA",3,164,15,2.0,2/20/2016,"Stopped in for a couple of beers before heading to the cinema.  Only had beer, no food. Beer: 2 stars.  Not undrinkable, but nothing close to being on par with any other craft beer out there.  Tastes like it's brewed by AB or Miller. Service (Bar): 2 stars.  Indifferent, but not awful.  It wasn't busy, but bartenders seemed like they thought they had better things to do then attend to their customers. The only reason I would be back would be to grab a beer before another movie, and then only because there are no other options in this plaza."
Dyonna B.,"Silver Spring, MD",344,129,48,4.0,8/12/2016,"Ok. I'm a fan. Went to this location yesterday for happy hour.  For a thirsty Thursday, the cocktail areas was not packed. I was able to quickly find a high top to accommodate all 4 of us. The cocktail area has 3-4 large Tvs that are in great view.  Staff was friendly and accommodating. I started off trying the berry blast cider which was pretty yummy.  BTW for anyone that doesn't know, this location makes their own beer and ciders. After my taster I ended up getting a pint of it. FYI the alcohol content is very little. I believe around 3.8%. After enjoying that cider, I didn't feel adventurous to try any other beers, so I jumped right back to bud lites. lol I shared some calamari with a friend and I swear, so far this has been the best fried calamari Ive ever tried but the portion size is not a lot.  Later on I ended up getting the parm crusted chicken which was super yummy and plentiful. I will def be back.  I saw a deep dish pasta that I want to try."
Brandon G.,"Silver Spring, MD",746,146,45,5.0,1/13/2016,"So I went here on a Saturday and it was pretty busy. Not too bad though. So I don't know what the other days are like but Saturday's seem pretty nice to dine. The service was great. Our waiter was prompt, graver her opinion when needed and most of all kept our drinks filled! The atmosphere was nice. Pretty intimate, the way the seats are but still has like a restaurant/bar type feel. Very unique. Not too quiet , not too noisy. Now let's get to what everyone really wants to know. THE FOOD. Bruh, the food was great. I had a simple cheeseburger. What got me was everything else. The appetizers were great. I had fried calimari, along with some orange type of cocktail that was one of the best I've ever had! I also saw a lot of people order their deep dish pizzas. I'm not a huge fan of deep dish, however the pizza did look good. Lastly, the deserts were good as well. Had one of their cookie desserts , which I can't remember the name, but just know it was decisions. Over all I would def come here again!"
Jeremy J.,"Glen Burnie, MD",0,19,4,2.0,6/1/2016,"Losing It!  This is the probably the last time we come to BJ's. The service was sub par and the food was cold. Three of us ordered medium pizzas and all three were barely warm. If we had more time, we would've had them made again, but we didn't have time. I ordered BJ's classic pizza... see the attached. Notice that the onions and green peppers, while fresh, are basically raw...like they weren't cooked with the pizza. My family originally loved coming here but this makes the second time in a row that we have been majorly disappointed. Additionally, if you sit in the patio and it is slightly breezy, expect a lot of dusty in your face and on your food as the patio was very dusty."
DeokHo K.,"Washington, DC",90,17,6,4.0,10/26/2016,"Pizza my heart. Went here on a saturday and it was pretty packed. So, naturally, gravitating to the bar was the best option for quick service.  Ordered a pizza and some rootbeer flavored boneless wings.  The pizza was awesome. It had that homemade feel without it being homemade. Does that even make sense? Let's try that again. The pizza reminded me of when i was a child and was first introduced to pizza. The dough was cooked perfectly and not runny like some other pizza places that add a lot of toppings on their pizza. What won me over was how the bottom of the pan wasn't drenched in grease. You could literally eat off of it... The boneless wings were okay. Maybe root beer wasn't the best flavor to try... The waiter never told us his name."
Bri H.,"Washington, DC",1560,128,1364,4.0,12/4/2014,"I came here Monday night for a random Happy Hour with my friend, which was much needed after the day I had. I actually wasn't originally going to go to BJ's but my friend suggested it. Although I really wanted to go to one of my ""go to"" spots for Happy Hour, I decided why not....lets try something new! It turned out to be a GREAT NIGHT! I love this place so much! Right when you walk in, the hosts are very sweet and nice, and the ambiance is incredible. It was packed! We sat at the bar and we were greeted immediately by one of the bartenders and he told us about the HH Specials. We decided to get the HH Pizza, HH Comso, HH Egg Rolls, and the HH Strawberry Mojito. Let's start with the drinks .... The Cosmo was okay, not as strong as I would have liked but it still tasted pretty good. The Mojito was a little too sweet for my taste but my friend seemed to really like it. I would say they could up the liquor measurement a bit, just a splash or two. Now the food - INCREDIBLE! So tasty and it came out super-fast. The pizza was crispy and flaky while the egg rolls were PACKED with flavor. They are a must if you visit BJ's. After two more drinks, we thought, ""We are at a brewhouse and have yet to order beer, THE HECK"" hahaha so we did just that. We ordered the beer flight tasters and we chose two beers each to drink. The best and I mean the best beer was the Grand Cruz! I could cry it was sooooooo good! MMMMHHMMM. We then decided, why not get fatter? So we ordered wangs to go with our beers and ordered the BBQ & Parmesan Wings. They were actually pretty good. They parmesan wings aren't my cup of tea, but the BBQ wings were on POINT! Overall, the staff is super nice (the bartenders are funny and easy to talk to), the food is amazing, and the drinks are good but could use a splash more of the good stuff. Lmao. I will most definitely be back for future Happy Hours! :) Favs - HH Pizza and HH Egg Rolls are phenomenal. Definitely signature items for them. The bartenders were very nice and attentive. Great STAFF!!  Would Change - HH Drinks were weak ... I go to the HH mainly for the drinks sooooo it was semi disappointing."
Kapri J.,"Laurel, MD",296,96,132,2.0,12/29/2014,"Came here on 12/29 at about 7 and I have to say is, If this place is busy, expect your drink order to come out after the entre and the entre to come out uncooked.  All we got from our server was that they are experiencing poor management and when we pointed out the uncooked pork chop was told they would take it off the bill.  Another server showed up only for our server to run over and say he talked to a manager and they already took it off.  needless to say I am leaving dinnerless :( probably not coming back unless I am the only one here and how likely is that?!? I think the saving grace as always is the fruit beer called Lindeman's Framboise.  I may come back for that it's he only beer I like."
Ieesha J.,"Washington, DC",510,310,392,4.0,11/26/2014,"As a Cali girl, I am a fan of this establishment. When I found out they were opening up a BJ's across the street from me you can imagine my excitement. I'm not typically a fan of chain restaurants except for BJ's. I've been here 4 times since they opened a little over 2 weeks ago and my experience with the food was consistent. I always order either the Pizza or the Santa Fe Salad along with their famous Pizookie for dessert. YOU can not enter and leave without having a Pizookie - that would be just wrong. The BEST server I've had so far was Patricia. Very funny, knew the menu, was quick on her feet and didn't have us waiting. I had 2 visits and the servers weren't as great but I will give them a pass since its a new restaurant- however I will ask for Patricia the next time I visit. Gotta stick to what you know right? All in all - I'm excited that my fav place is around the corner. The place is pretty packed in the evenings so make sure you're prepared to wait if you come during game time or after 7."
Elo R.,"Marietta, GA",73,20,23,4.0,1/17/2016,"Here from ATL visiting my boyfriend and not only did we go last night (Saturday) to watch my Cardinals beat Green Bay but went back today again. ... Saturday we were greeted immediately upon arrival n the hostess had us a table within a minute, however we chose to sit at the bar instead.  Bartender by the name of Eric greeted us as soon as we took a seat.....We chose to take advantage of their happy hour specials and started with a pepperoni flat bread pizza ....delish!!  I also had the small spinach salad ...that was tasty. Of course...drinks..both the sangria and the Tickled Pink ...great!! For our meals my bf had the bbq brisket burger and he smashed that ..lol..he loved it. I had the wings and they were good but I've had better...í think this is why í deducted a star . Today ...I wont mention exactly everything we had because well...we pigged out ....but drinks...pizza...bread bowl ...service ...AND dessert...ALL was top notch. Thank u BJs staff."
Chanda G.,"San Francisco, CA",130,36,11,2.0,12/22/2014,"These are all over California and decided to meet my mom and sister here when I got into town for the holiday. Too bad I couldn't have anything I actually wanted because their 86 list was 50+ items long. No cider, out of 9 beers and basic liquors like Stoli and Jim Beam. The manager came over after my FIFTH attempt at ordering a drink and said it was a distributor issue. New place, totally understand if they haven't worked out their ordering yet but don't blame it on a distributor that you're out of standard beers.  Sad because my family definitely won't come back after this experience."
Sarah S.,"Laurel, MD",0,12,6,3.0,5/17/2017,"They have a great variety of foods to offer, and the appetizers I had were alright.  The drinks are good.  They have a bunch of microbrews that seem kind of fun, but I didn't get to try the ones I wanted (like berry-flavored) because they were too pricey.  Nice place to go if you have friends over and want to get out of the house."
Melanie B.,"Bowie, MD",0,13,2,4.0,2/20/2016,"The beers are good and there's a decent selection.  The food is pretty good, but the service is the best part.  Prompt, friendly, and helpful.   I came here tonight (not the first time) and it's unseasonably warm for February.  We only wanted to grab a few beers before going to see a movie.  They opened up the outdoor seating just for us so we could drink outside since there was no room at the bar, and we didn't have to wait 45 minutes for a table or booth.  Will definitely come again :)"
Joseph J.,"Clarksville, MD",0,98,202,4.0,5/21/2015,4 of us arrived on a Thursday evening around 6. Had a 30 minute wait. No problem. We got drinks at the bar & hung out until our table was ready. Waitress came over fast enough & took our app order. Carnitas & fries...came very fast. Good.  I had the bison burger. Wow! Awesome! Tender & juicy like I expected bison to be. Wife got shrimp tacos...very good. Kids got pan pizzas & said they were delish. Overall a good experience. Will be back.
Rebecca C.,"Washington, DC",24,144,46,3.0,1/5/2016,"A perfectly fine choice for a date-- not dazzling but not bad either. The ""pizookies"" (warm cookies with ice cream) are especially good. I don't usually love cookies-and-cream desserts, but that pizookie was the best-- I'll get it again. Salted caramel was also very good, and Ghirardelli chocolate was good too (we got the $9.99 ""pick 3""). As for the rest of the food-- I had the stuffed mushrooms at the recommendations of Yelpers, and was not disappointed, as well as the ""twisted BLT salad,"" which was... a salad... also not disappointing. Husband got a bacon cheeseburger. He commented that it felt like a pre-formed patty and wasn't impressed with that. The thin-cut fries were tasty. Calamari was kind of a disappointment. The quality of the calamari itself was very good (way to go, BJ's), but it was too greasy-- probably the oil wasn't hot enough-- enough that I was blotting pieces on a napkin before I ate them. Could have been the kitchen's mistake and not how they normally do it; if it hadn't been for that, it would have been pretty great, with a nice lemon aioli. Ambience is ""brewpub."" Overall it's better than some of the other brewpub options in the area. Service was pretty solid. They have a nice discounted movie ticket deal with the local theater. Location is excellent, in terms of PG county; the theater is right there, as is Climbzone (seriously, adults should try that place too-- it's super fun). I'd eat there again, and recommend it if you're in the area."
Marce D.,"Burtonsville, MD",4,61,142,3.0,3/24/2016,I usually love BJs. Today not so much. It was a nice day so I decided to go and sit outside and have a nice meal and drink. It took several times asking for water and utensils from our server who seemed super overwhelmed. She even mentioned to another server she was stressed. We got appetizers. No small plates. Had to send something back. It was on the check twice. Not a good look.
Howard S.,"Millersville, MD",0,1,,5.0,10/21/2016,The food was great and the service was one of the best I have had in a long time thanks bjs for a great date night for me and my wife
Michael L.,"Bowie, MD",0,3,,1.0,10/19/2016,"I've been to BJs twice now and both times the experience was much the same.  On the latest occasion we arrive on a Wednesday evening around 5:30 and tables are about 30% occupied (so not very busy). We are seated promptly and placed our order with no problems.  Drinks came quickly. After some time passes (we aren't in a hurry) the waitress stops by the table to say the kitchen is backed up and there will be a delay.  This repeats some time later.   The food arrives and one plate is hot and the others just warm.  My burger tasted like it was cooked in a microwave, an even brown from surface to middle.  No seasoning and full of oil on the lower bun.   The taste is bland.  Another in our party had the pulled  was so salty she ate only a few bites.  The fries were barely warm so no one ate them.  My wife had ribs with potatoes and asparagus.  The asparagus was over cooked and stringy and the potatoes cold, lumpy and dry.  Overall the worst meal we've had this year. We had a similar experience some time ago when we stopped in for a late lunch around 1:30 on a weekday.  Service then was slow and the food quality poor.  At the time we chalked it up to a relatively new restaurant at an off hour. BJs is off our list of acceptable restaurants."
