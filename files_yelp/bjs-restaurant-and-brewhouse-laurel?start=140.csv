Michelle A.,"Hanover, MD",9,32,23,4.0,11/7/2015,"I went in on a busy Friday night. Nice ambiance, good for small groups having a date night, birthday, etc. I personally did not have much, I have a limited diet right now. However, the menu is extensive. Calamari appetizers, flatbreads, sliders, sandwiches, couscous dishes,  jambalaya, an interesting salad selection, etc. And the dessert menu looked delicious, they have a pumpkin bread dessert that I will be back to try before the season is over. My besti ordered the jambalaya, one of her favorite dishes and completely cleaned her dish, lol. My other friend ordered the chicken club that comes w/ extra crispy shoe string fries. She has culinary experience and kept talking about the bread of the sandwich was perfectly seasoned. She believes it was something about garlic butter used to toast the bread. We also ordered the beer sampler (it's worth trying) Or you can ask for .50 cent samples of any beer you want to try. We also ordered some black cherry, whiskey drink that was not worth it. Portions: The portion sizes are good, they do fill the plate and you might have leftovers.  Service: I had a great waitress, I think her name was Tara. The food came out hot and within 15 minutes.  Overall, no complaints, I will be back."
Jamie B.,"College Park, MD",151,128,196,5.0,1/27/2016,"For the price point, portions, atmosphere and drinks, I give BJ's four stars. We had a great time at happy hour, ordering lots of apps. I was in a reasonable group (6) but the bar area was cramped for a party that size. We got Santa Fe spring rolls which were beyond amazing, and we also got the spinach and artichoke dip - also fabulous! I ordered a basil and watermelon margarita, and it might just be my new favorite drink.  Initially, the service wasn't great (so the initial arrivals from our party informed those of us who came later) we got a much better server. Carolina took exceptional care of us and was funny to boot. We had a great time meeting here for HH and I hope we do it again soon!"
Jasmine R.,"Silver Spring, MD",3,9,2,1.0,6/6/2016,"I'm saddened that I have to write a horrible review as I am a huge fan of BJs. My boyfriend and I came into the restaurant for dinner. We had horrible service (no utensils on the table, slow service, and didn't receive our food for an hour and 15 minutes). I spoke to the manager who apologized for the service, but the waitress, tiara,  came back with an attitude. I will never dine at BJs."
DL D.,"Lanham, MD",0,5,1,4.0,3/9/2016,"Lamont is a great manager !  Go see Victoria at the bar. Menu for days like you are reading a Harry Potter book.  Good deals , not fan of their brussel sprouts though!"
John A.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",57,180,123,3.0,10/26/2015,I have been to 3 different locations of BJ's Restaurant and all 3 have resulted in different reviews. This past visit to BJs was certainly not one of the best but it is understandable given the size of the restaurant and the amount of people out on a Saturday night. Food was served hot but nothing spectacular. Calamari was slightly undercooked and deep dish pizza was just notches above pizza hut...So why do I keep coming back......the beer is cold and the choices are plentiful.....its a love hate relationship....after a few beers this place kinda grows on you.....the bazoukee is by far the best part of the meal....A1 desserts for sure
Mitchell M.,"Rockville, MD",0,57,6,4.0,2/19/2016,Only tried desserts and came out thinking that pizookies are over rated.  Everyone was telling me to try it and at best its Meh.  I actually enjoyed the Fried Doughnut with strawberry sauce and whip cream.  And the adult root beer float was also tasty. i would like to try BJ's again in the future.
Liv D.,"Washington, DC",2,19,2,5.0,11/30/2015,"Can you say ""Good BEER"" Ah! I love beer! They have the best hand crafted and beers on Tap in TOWN. The food is good, can't complain too much it holds the beer down.:) When I was there someone was celebrating their birthday party and it gave me an idea, to celebrate my birthday there.  Serve is good, food is good, BEER is great!"
Anthony B.,"Manheim, PA",202,35,9,2.0,10/5/2015,"UPDATE** they just changed the happy hour 2 days ago. The happy hour specials are terrible now. They went from the best possible happy hour to the below mediocre. The food is still good but what a major disappointment! New happy hour is 1/2 off mini deep dish pizza, $1 off draft beer/wine, and $2 off shareable appetizers. COMPLETE disappointment. My fiancé and I will be finding a new happy hour location. We are thoroughly annoyed. BJ's, shame on you. This was ""our spot"" where we loved coming after a hard day of work. Bring back $4 you-call-its.  I guess it's time to find a new happy hour location. *** OLD REVIEW: Best happy hour specials in Laurel, hands down. My fiancé and I go here almost once a week. They have an incredible personal deep dish pizza, wings, and all your favorite foods. Drinks are made right and the food has never let us down.  One of the absolute best parts of BJs is the selection of beers on tap. We usually go around 4:30 on weekdays. The bar is usually pretty quiet so we sit right up and unwind after a hard day of work. The bartenders are great and friendly as well. I look forward to my visits here. TIP: On Sundays when the NFL is on, it's often hard to find a seat unless you get there early because."
Sharde D.,"Alexandria, VA",36,1,,3.0,6/7/2016,I'm giving three stars because I had an amazing attentive friendly server (    David    ). The drinks my girlfriend and I got were really good but the expectation of the food wasn't. She had eaten here before and has had great food but we tried something different somewhere different and neither of us were happy. Her alfredo pasta was dry and under seasoned i got the shrimp and asparagus and my shrimp was under cooked .  The atmosphere is nice but the expectation to be great should be an all around experience. We are both chefs and this was a let down for the both of us. Next time i do hope the experience will be better.
Sean W.,"Haddonfield, NJ",38,5,1,4.0,9/7/2016,"Went on Labor Day on our way home from Richmond. We were seated right away, but waited a little bit before we were greeted by a server. Our server was very friendly and she offered good recommendations. I ordered the hickory burger, my girlfriend ordered the bacon guacamole burger, since she's a vegetarian she ordered minus the bacon and with a veggie patty instead. Our food was out from the kitchen within a reasonable amount of time, but without the guacamole on the burger, which was promptly brought out after we brought it to their attention (We're easy to please). My burger was fantastic, it's so hard to find a chain restaurant that cooks a proper medium burger, but they nailed it. The burgers came with shoestring fries, which I don't always care for, but they hit the spot. The handcrafted root beer and vanilla cream sodas were very good and we left satisfied customers."
D S.,"Washington, DC",4,37,17,2.0,10/28/2015,"I've eaten here on 3 occasions.  I can't recommend the food.  I think I've only been here more than once because it's convenient and I think I wanted to believe I just got unlucky once, or twice.   But after eating there and NOT having a drink.  I realized this place sucks.  No alcohol to trick me into thinking it was mediocre.  The food is boring and bland.  I should have known when I was handed a menu that looked more like a college text book that this wasn't going to be a good look.  Too many food options means a restaurant likely doesn't have anything all that great.  Trying to be too many things to too many people is hard to pull off.  Cheesecake factory manages to pull it off, but this place.  Nope! And it's not all in my head, I've eaten here with others who reported the same thing.  Bland.  Boring.  Unmemorable.  Overwhelming menu selection, underwhelming taste. I've done the Salmon - Bland, not horrible.  Just mediocre. I've done the fish and chips - I hate string fries for one.  And fish was bland and mediocre bordering on nasty. My date had some sort of pasta.  Shrimp and linguine.  She complained that the shrimp was still opaque/undercooked.  She then complained the food was also down right bland (you see a theme here).  The saving grace was the garlic cheese bread that came with it.  Mind you this women eats any and everything.  I have never seen her turn down food.  And she's definitely not picky so hearing her say this place sucked is saying something.."
Joshua A.,"Westmere, NY",9,36,,2.0,8/12/2015,"My family and i step into BJ's for a bite after a long day of travel so we figured go with the chain place that had decent Yelp reviews.   The hostess was sweet to the kids, quick, polite, and knowledgeable about the menu.  Our server was training, I assume because she had a tag along but didn't say why, they were polite and knowledgeable at the beginning. We order a few apps, the were okay, not how the menu described or pictured ( few things different) but no real issue. Then we waited 30 minutes our food, no drink refills, and one dish out of seven came out and we all drooled while only one plate of food was on the table.  We had been told the fryer went down but the only dish at our table that needed frying was the fried chicken and that was the only dish at the table. I ordered a pizza because It had a whole menu page and the server mentioned it so I figured it's a dish they do well.  BUZZZZZ!  Wrong answer, go to Harris Teeter for pizza (I did after) it is in the same plaza, cheaper and tastes 100% better. The best part of the night was the Root Beer they make in house but I only had one glass because after the servers could see we were bothered they stayed sparse Would not bother with this place try Mission BBQ (same plaza too)."
Linda C.,"Annapolis, MD",8,17,23,4.0,12/11/2015,"The soups are BOMB! I had a hard time choosing between the lasagna and the salmon. I went there with my family and friend, it was great. The server are super friendly and helpful. I recommend the clam chowder on de bread!! My brother had the guacamole burger and he loved it."
Kelleen N.,"Columbia, MD",112,58,45,1.0,4/28/2016,"No no no no no. My latest experience here was AWFUL. My husband took me here for my birthday which turned out to be a huge mistake. After waiting 15 minutes for our waiter to get to our table we ordered waters with lemon then waited another 10 for the water and an additional 10-15 for the lemons which my husband ended up going to the bartender to get himself. Should have left at that point but unfortunately we ordered our food and only got 1/2 of our order to which we responded by talking to the manager who also had to talk to the other 2 angry tables next to us that had a similar experience. He told us that he would box the other half of the meal that we'd canceled and comp what we already had payed for. Well, I still have a $20 charge on my card. I'm pissed and won't be returning anytime soon. Oh! Also, called the restaurant a couple days later to speak to a manager and was told I'd receive a call back, never did :) going to corporate now"
Sean F.,"Beltsville, MD",181,385,58,2.0,8/5/2015,"Slow, slow service. I've been pretty excited about the couple new craft beer places popping up around Laurel and didn't think twice about meeting up with some co-workers for the happiest of hours. Unfortunately this slowly turned into the saddest of hours. The place is pretty nice and the hostess was friendly, courteous but then the downhill slide began. I got to happy hour at BJ's with about 45 minutes to go. Order a beer, the house stout in nitro, and asked for a happy hour specials menu. At the same time my coworker ordered a bottle of Budlight. 20 minutes later none of the three had arrived. I understand a nitro beer doesn't pour quickly but a bottle of bud and a specials menu shouldn't take anymore than 10 minutes at most. 15 minutes later her beer came out a little warm, my beer came out fine and the food menu came out finally. 25 minutes later our server came back around but it was now past happy hour prices and I had no interest in spending any more money at BJ's. I can't say you should steer clear but be wary. I ended up meeting up with another and eating elsewhere.  Side note: My nitro house stout was one of the better stouts I've had. It had a creamy, smooth mouthfeel and good notes of chocolate on the nose and coffee in the body. It would've probably pair well with that chocolate brownie pizookie but I never had the opportunity to try that combo.  Pro tip might be to grab a seat at the bar instead of the dining floor."
Daniel C.,"Rockville, MD",0,4,1,1.0,4/19/2016,"I recently celebrated my grandfather's birthday at BJ's in Laurel. I was deeply disappointed with our experience with this establishment. The appetizers took 40 minutes to come out, only to find that they weren't what we ordered. On top of this, one of my family members was forced to wait an additional 20 minutes for his entree. The food was tasteless, and considering the prices it's safe to say that they're basically robbing their customers. I'll never dine here again."
Dilon W.,"Washington, DC",5,31,13,4.0,11/28/2015,"Still impressed with BJs, I wish I checked in as often as I go. You should definitely check this place out. The menu is extensive, it will a while to move through it all. I had the deep dish pizza and it was delicious. I like that it comes with its own personal holder for the pan. The beer selection is premium as well, you can even mix beers to create your own unique flavors. Check this place out!!"
Krystle L.,"Beltsville, MD",102,5,,5.0,8/13/2016,Awesome food and Wonderful Service!!! I highly recommend the burgers and seared tuna salad. I will definitely return in the future!!!
Shellie M.,"Laurel, MD",0,19,36,5.0,5/9/2016,I Order takeout for my son all the time and my husband and son go together to pick it up - my son has autism and the bartender was veryyyy nice to him made his day I wish my husband had gotten her name she was very attentive to him and sweet to my son which means a lot because my son was ecstatic thanks to how she treated him - I will edit this if I get her name very awesome !
Jay S.,"Hyattsville, MD",122,39,23,1.0,5/9/2015,"WORST SERVICE I HAVE EVER RECEIVED.  It's very disappointing because the food is actually decent. However, the service is unacceptable. Our waiter paid little to no attention to us. We sat down at 9:51pm, and only received water at 10:15. (25 minutes later!) After he came with the water, we decided it was best to place our appetizers. 10 minutes later the appetizer came, and our waiter was never to be seen again. He completely went M.I.A. We were so frustrated and upset, we decided to go to the host get our check and leave.  Because of this experience I will never go back again to B.J brewery again!  Our waiters name was Darian. Worst WAITER EVER! If you have him make sure you ask for another waiter or leave. You will not be happy."
