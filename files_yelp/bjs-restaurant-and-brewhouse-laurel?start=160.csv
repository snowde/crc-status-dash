Elle Z.,"Vicenza, Italy",131,133,227,3.0,9/26/2015,"A mediocre attempt at a brewhouse, they have only about 6 different beers that you wouldn't find everywhere else.  Food has generous servings (burger, kids mac and cheese)"
Carol P.,"Silver Spring, MD",0,18,,1.0,7/31/2016,"I wish i could give this place zero starts. We came for dinner at the bar. Food was brought cold, they actually said we microwave it again. I was like wtf. Manager and wait staff was rude. We came for the delicious mahi mahi with quinoa and shrimp. They can with a cold disgusting plate that appeared to be someone leftovers. Never coming back this place is disgusting."
Harley L.,"Adelphi, MD",44,1,,4.0,7/30/2016,"Sport bar feel. The wait was long to get a table but to be fair it was a Friday evening. The food selection was great and the portions were good. Server was very friendly, respectful and overall she was great. I would recommend it to a friend and would go again but not on a busy Friday night."
Sarisa K.,"Silver Spring, MD",138,32,20,1.0,5/9/2015,"I've been here a few times and both times were not memorable. The service was severely lacking, I waited 10 minutes for someone to even greet me. While that was me being patient, it took 15 mins to get my drinks.... my appetizers came out before I even got water.. The restaurant was not busy either, the food was even more disappointing. My sandwich was burnt as well as the salmon my bf got. They gave him asparagus ends for his veggies. Not edible at all!  Overall, avoid this place. Go to Nandos or panera instead. 5 thumbs down"
George B.,"Severn, MD",5,10,,3.0,1/21/2016,"Had a deep dish pizza from here, it wasnt that good, imo. Felt like it was pre made dough with cheese warmed up on it. But on the flip side the bar and my drinks were awesome, the long islands are good. Went on a friday night, wait was only about 20 mins and my server was really cool. Maybe next time I'll try a different meal but the pizza is better at Uno's if you looking for a personal deep dish."
Eric L.,"Elkridge, MD",9,240,5,2.0,8/22/2015,"We had a mediocre experience on our first occasion and decided to come again and try different items. Overall, the food is decent, but not great including their signature pizza. It can get quite loud and many people in here are just getting drunk so it borders on not being a family friendly environment. The service was also pretty slow on our last trip and the restaurant was not full. I can't find a good reason to come back. There are many places like BJ's in the area."
Samasama P.,"Maryland City, MD",4,7,13,1.0,10/9/2016,"Food was great as always. Server was horrible he took our order after that we didn't see him no more he walked past our table multiple times and didn't even see if we needed refills or anything. I noticed he didn't check on ""people of color"" but did check on ""Caucasian race"" which I found very strange. Even one of the other workers said he needs a good slap, I'm guessing this isn't the first time. Anyways we had to get the manager and he apologized and was very helpful including discounting us for such a long wait and horrible service from the waiter. The waiter came over and was like ""the food will be out now the manager told me"" we was like ok we was wondering because you never came to our table and checked in with us. He was like ""do you need anything"" No it's too late and on top of that he was being a jerk about it. He needs to be retrained other than that I would go here again but a better server !"
Jon R.,"Laurel, MD",759,94,2,4.0,9/24/2015,"We have now been there three times. The first time was a fluke. Last minute trip that ended up really lovely.  The next time was for my birthday with my parents. Again, lovely time and good food.  The last time was just recent--- went there for my wedding anniversary.  All three times we have had excellent food and wonderful service.  The only complaint is the price is a wee expensive for a Brewhouse. But it is still excellent and we are total fans!"
R David S.,"Dallas, TX",18,168,114,3.0,5/9/2016,"I went there for a NBA game. Good place, good options of food. Nothing different. It is a regular chain restaurant. Is good for meet someone, to watch a sport event but if you are looking for a different kind of food, something special this is not the place. Solid food but nothing special. Again, for a sport event is a good option."
Young V.,"Washington, DC",0,106,22,1.0,11/21/2015,"Gross pulled pork. Rather chunks of pork dog food. And cole slaw that was merely a few large chunks of cabbage. Fried chicken wasn't terrible, but side salad, mashed potatoes and corn were all blah. Third and last time going here. Plus the beers are misses. Wish they'd put a duclaw here instead."
Charles K.,"Largo, MD",130,130,33,4.0,4/10/2015,"Atmosphere: Quite nice.  The bar was inviting and I was immediately drawn to it. I was a little sad when my party already had a table in the back.  The rest of the restaurant is nicely put together.  It attracts friends, first time daters, and families young and old. Food:  I was hungry, but the menu was overloaded with items and I could not make up my mind.  This reminded me of the menu for Cheesecake Factory.  There are a lot of choices, which is great, but I wasn't feeling the food.  The lack of eating is partly my fault because I should have reviewed the menu online before I entered the restaurant. Beer:  I ended up having a lovely Tatonka Stout beer.  This beer was malty with notes of chocolate.  It was a great way to end the day.  I will definitely try more of the beers considering BJ's offers beer flights.  I also like the fact that the coaster that comes with the beer highlights the name and a few notes about the beer. Conclusion:  I can give this place 4 stars on atmosphere and beer alone.  Not sure about the food, but my friends seemed to thoroughly enjoy their meals."
Jocelyn S.,"Baltimore, MD",245,11,2,2.0,5/26/2016,"I love the atmosphere of the place, unfortunately the customer service is not up to par. I called to make a reservation and was spoken to in an extremely condescending and snotty manner, I let this go although my reservation was clearly not placed. I won't discredit the franchise; they have decent food and a great place for drinks. However, I will not be returning due to the customer service including our waiter."
B R.,"Laurel, MD",0,3,,4.0,1/6/2017,"I mainly get take-out from here, but I've eaten inside a few times.  More vegetarian options than most places, but fewer than I'd need to give five stars.  Avocado egg rolls are love.  Stuffed mushrooms are a close second.  Deep dish pizza is a bit bready, but I like it.  The enlightened brussel sprout/kale/cranberry/etc salad is my go-to when I want something healthy but a bit fancy, and is quite satisfying.  Lots of TVs with sports inside.  Prices are maybe a little high on certain items, but it's overall a good value, especially if you look for a coupon (which they've had regularly on their website through the holidays).  Head's up, though, fellow vegetarians, this location does not have veggie burgers as far as I can tell."
Jackie G.,"Silver Spring, MD",35,28,55,3.0,3/24/2015,I went to grab drinks and some food on a Friday night. The dining area had a wait of 30 min. I sat at the bar my waitress looked like he didn't want to be there. I ordered barbecue wings and brewhouse blonde. I asked for my wings to be cooked well done  there weren't. I enjoyed the brewhouse blonde beer. It's great atmosphere and great to watch basketball games. Since they have numerous TVs mounted on there walls.
Taylor P.,"Clinton, MD",1,4,1,3.0,4/4/2016,"Went there last night. The Server introduced herself then we got a different waiter due to a ""shift change.""I included quotes because the young woman continued to serve two tables so don't know what that was about. Our service wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. Mediocre."
Tianna W.,"Silver Spring, MD",10,15,,4.0,7/5/2015,"Went there for a work party for a fellow employee. Note - if you want to have a private party here, just know it won't be private. They don't have private rooms, so they can only reserve you tables in the main dining area.  Overall food was great and service was ok - we all got our drinks after we finished our appetizers (this includes water). Some people really didn't like that, so thats really the only minus. However, I feel like the food is worth 4 stars. We had the pepporoni, bbq, and veggie pizzas plus bbq salad and house salad. Everything tasted great, cool atomsphere. I would visit again minus my coworkers lol."
Wilfred B.,"Burtonsville, MD",0,13,9,3.0,11/13/2016,"Went to happy hour with my love. $2 dollars off food items and $1 dollar off select alcoholic beverages. I ordered spaghetti with meatballs, the pasta was good but the meatballs were bland. My love ordered the Santa Fe Salad, which she thought was sub par and will not be ordering again. We also ordered Garlic Parmesan chicken wings that were very delicious and was the only reason for 3 stars."
Lucas C.,"Ellicott City, MD",57,5,1,5.0,5/14/2016,Our server was excellent. The food here was pretty lit. Staff is very efficient and the wait time goes by quick on a busy day.  Our servers name was Evelyn.  And Mark the manager a very stand up guy.
Patrice J.,"Silver Spring, MD",7,48,4,1.0,2/11/2016,"Craptastic! Horrible service, undercooked food and the dining room is uncomfortably cold."
Timothy S.,"Norfolk, VA",0,34,10,1.0,5/28/2016,30 min+ wait for food every time. Don't come here unless you aren't going to be hungry in an hour.
