Sarah M.,"Takoma Park, MD",72,212,113,4.0,3/7/2015,"Dope vibe.  I didn't realize that Laurel had a nice shopping center, but BJ's is one of the newest digs in that area. I dined at BJ's with a group of friends on a Friday night. Casey was our waitress, and she was awesome! If you're into beer, order the Berry Burst Cider.  As an appetizer, try their smothered fries. As a meal, try any of their deep dish pizzas!"
L. D.,"Laurel, MD",0,5,,4.0,11/22/2016,I tried this place out a week ago. The beer was very palatable not too hoppy.  I ended up ordering dinner. Salmon was fresh and well-prepared. It was a little pricey.  Otherwise there was nothing not to like.
Crystal L.,"Columbia, MD",37,91,137,4.0,9/1/2015,"Chic, modern & still very family friendly.  The environment gives me an upscale TGIFridays vibe with a mind blowing drink selection!  I've been here twice and I've never been disappointed with anything I've ordered.  The staff were all very friendly and the restrooms were clean.  Oh- if you will be visiting the movies they currently have a special if you purchase your tickets from them."
Rene R.,"Baltimore, MD",19,177,,5.0,8/25/2016,"My first visit to the Laurel location and it did not disappoint! We added 4 people to our party after we had been seated and they worked quickly to get us re seated and did not make us feel like it was an inconvenience (though my years working in a restaurant tell me otherwise ). The bathroom was super clean and it appeared that in the 2 hrs we were there it was freshened up. Even on a busy Friday night. The service was wonderful. And the food was delicious. With 12 people at a table we ate a variety of foods. I do regret that none of us saved room for dessert. I had the salmon with brown rice and veggies. The salmon was so flavorful, the veggies were lightly sautéed and the brown rice was surprisingly tasty. If you've ever made brown rice at home you know it isn't the most delightful grain without some help. There was also pizza that was very good. And my husband and coworker enjoyed their jambalaya.  And we had crispy calamari to get our meal started right. The kids had Chicken tenders and wings with fries. (I loved the fries). All in all it was a wonderful meal. And we are very glad there's a location so close. My sister and bil take their kids weekly for pizza - we'll be joining them more frequently."
Jeanie L.,"Laurel, MD",3,41,113,5.0,2/11/2016,Great food. Great beer. Fantastic service. Wandered in because we were treated rudely at Outback and we were so happy we did!
Christina S.,"Severn, MD",180,54,12,5.0,6/11/2015,I've drove past this restaurant a few times and figured I'd finally come in and give it a try. Man was I impressed. The dining room areas was competent full. Always a good sign. The hostess told us that there was one booth at the bar available so we sat there and were greeted almost instantaneously.  My boyfriend and I each got a couple of their specialty beers which we were both pleased with. He ordered a deep dish pizza of some sort and I ordered the spicy pig tavern pizza. Both were amazing.  Our waitress was very nice and attentive. We will be coming back and I can't wait for my next visit.
Laila M.,"Bethesda, MD",7,26,11,2.0,4/6/2015,The food here is always good. But the customer service is lacking. Our waitresses acted as though she wanted to be anywhere but here. She rudely dumped our plates on the table. Never checked in on us while happily talking to other patrons. And just really came of as rude and inconsiderate. This has been pretty consistent with our experience. Last time we came our waitress disappeared for over twenty minutes in the back and another waitress named Daniele had to get us water and help us. All in all new servers need to be hired.   Edited**** We actually talked to the Manager and she let us know this was her best server. And the servers attitude went down hill after she found out we asked to talk to a manager. She didn't look at us just rudely placed the check down and haughtily walked away. The same when she picked up the check. We won't ever be returning. If you're having a bad day and work in the front lines with customers. Call out don't come in. Don't ruin others experiences by not even pretending to be friendly.
Rebeca F.,"Pikesville, MD",50,193,1,4.0,5/27/2015,"There was a mix up with our reservation, but once we got it sorted out things went pretty smoothly. Nice beer selection, and you can order it in a pitcher. The pizza here is really good! Can't wait to go back and try it again! Hopefully next time I'll have room for dessert because they looked amazing."
Phlzgud G.,"Greenbelt, MD",0,8,,4.0,12/5/2016,"Nice place to go, bar always full. Great selection of beers and the bartenders are friendly! Only downside lately, the pot sticker dipping sauce has changed and is now practically super sweet syrup!"
Rhonda S.,"Laurel, MD",14,102,2,2.0,1/1/2015,"Whenever I visit California, I usually go to a BJ's. It's a good chain with great food. Now, lets talk about the Laurel location. I have given them two tries and both times it took forever. The first time we arrived around 7pm and ordered a glass of wine, 4 waters, 1 pizza, 1 appetizer and a pazookie for dessert. Easy enough. The wine took 20 minutes to come out and the whole dining experience took about two and a half hours. That's how slow service is. The food was pretty good, but I don't have all day to sit at this establishment. The second time I ordered carryout. I parked in the alloted space and called the number on the sign upon arrival as directed and..... no answer. It took about 3 minutes for someone to pickup. Finally a friendly guy came out to our car and took my card back in to charge it. What is this, 1992? With all of the technology now available, as well as credit fraud, why does BJ's force this kid to run all over the place? Get an Ipad and let the customer swipe their own card. I mean, I have been to locations where you can pay on your phone at the table, so why this antiquated method of payment? After all of this, our food still wasn't ready and we ended up waiting about 20 minutes for carryout we called in 30 minutes prior. This location needs help. I have visited the Gainesville, Va location as well and they are on point. I am not sure if the Laurel location needs new management, training, or if it sucks because it's Laurel, but seriously get with it if you want good clientele to continue to come."
Shatekia M.,"Las Colinas, TX",4,26,27,4.0,6/22/2015,Awesome place! Stumbled upon this place while in the area and so glad I did!! Loved the ambiance..wasn't too loud..and I didn't have a problem finding a seat on a Saturday evening. I enjoyed the best ever stuffed mushrooms and personal pan pizza I was really good although I wish it was a little hotter. I felt like perhaps it had been sitting for a little while. I would definitely come back. Nice place in a nice area in Laurel :-)
Fuck F.,"Savage, MD",0,1,,1.0,6/5/2016,"Horrible service, kept us waiting for an hour, and the food was cold by the time it was ""ready"". Waitress offered a very half - hearted apology, clearly not wanting to be there as much as we did not. Go to Mission BBQ across the street - theyre awesome."
A R.,"Laurel, MD",0,8,5,5.0,12/2/2016,"Love this place!  Great appetizers, pizza, and pizookies!"
Cheeyaka I.,"Laurel, MD",5,22,,4.0,3/23/2015,"I did a girls night out here with some friends and we definitely had a great time. It was on one of those game nights, so the bar was packed with a bunch of folks watching a football game. I rolled up in there with 4 other girls and the attention from the males was crazy. Unfortunately for them, all the other girls were married but hey single ladies, this might just be your spot to meet a nice guy out and about. We even got free drinks from the bartender. No complaints at all. The food was good, the menu is very extensive like a Cheesecake factory kinda deal so it was slightly overwhelming but the service was good and quick. All in all, we had a good time and I wouldn't mind checking this spot out again."
Andrea L.,"Capitol Heights, MD",0,12,11,3.0,8/16/2016,"Wait time isn't the greatest, food is sub-par. Probably cool for just drinks, at the bar."
Chi C.,"Silver Spring, MD",0,5,2,4.0,11/24/2016,They have a amazing selection on food and huge . You will find what you are looking for . Even there beers are good . They have happy hour when I went not sure the day it was but the food drinks good . The services was ok because the one lady was new at this place . But she new enough to get my stomach right ! Thanks
Uche I.,"Laurel, MD",0,17,2,2.0,4/15/2016,"My issue with this place was the dinner ware. My napkin was dirty because it still had dried, crusty food on it. The silver ware had a cloudy look to it. The plates had finger prints.    Other than those, eat on folks!!!! :oD"
Sheree W.,"Charlotte, NC",43,170,156,5.0,4/11/2015,I've been to BJs three times so far and I've yet to be disappointed. They still serve salads the way they used to...HUGE! It's our new favorite spot. It gets very crowded so I always put us in the wait list. And their drinks are great as well. The wait staff very friendly.
Joseph W.,"Columbia, MD",75,229,48,5.0,1/28/2015,"First time here with the wife and kids. I enjoyed the beer sampler, since I couldn't figure out what beer I wanted. I had the salmon with the cherry flavored sauce. The waitress was great she came around every few minutes to check on us. It was crowded to be a new place, but I will definitely come back again. Almost for got the dessert. Don't remember the name but it had a cookie at the bottom and chocolate Ice cream on top and a chocolate sauce. NICE NICE NICE"
Elizabeth P.,"Fulton, MD",42,9,,5.0,5/12/2016,Very friendly staff. Helpful and personable.  Zach was wonderful.  Twisted BLT salad was good. Roast beef dip was great.
