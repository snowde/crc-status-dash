Dee M.,"Hyattsville, MD",0,18,,1.0,5/6/2016,I wish I could a -10 review. This place does not even deserve a 1 star. We went for happy hour at this place. The bartender Brittany passed by us multiple times w/o asking us what we wanted. It's not like it was busy. After we finally got our drinks... When our drinks were almost empty she did not even ask if we wanted another one but wait she had time to ask both the parties sitting besides us if they wanted drinks.. Never ever going on to this place. The gentleman who was working with her was nice.
Deanna D.,"Vienna, VA",17,11,1,1.0,5/1/2016,"I'd give this place no stars if I could. We rolled in 8 people deep and waited 20 mins. for a table which is typical. Once we sat down, we waited another 10 minutes for our server, Lamont, to take our order. Cool. While we waited, we didn't at least get our waters. We're f**king parched at this time. After 20 minutes, our server comes back and asked to run down the orders again because he couldn't read his own handwriting! What the hell was he doing for the past 20 minutes?! WTF! We got the manager to come by, and we asked for our drinks and made a complaint about our server. He apologizes, and I assumed he went to talk to the server. No body comes back for the next 10 mins. Every table around us, including who sat after us, got their drinks and food. Still no water for us. As soon we saw a table who sat after us get their drinks, we just got up and left and walked over to Outback! We waited an hour for this BS."
Kyra H.,"Bowie, MD",109,47,21,4.0,11/22/2014,"Went here today on A whim and I must say I am glad I did. For an app we had the pork loaded fries. I am not a fan of this appetizer as the shoe string fries are not my favorite also the green sauce I was not a fan it was tangy and bitter not ideal. For drinks we both did the sampler of 4. Which we enjoyed but the ones you end up not wanting you are stuck with. As for the meals I got the Southern Fried Chicken which was tender juicy crisp and well seasoned. My BF got the ribeye which had fat all the way through which he is not a fan of.  The desert was delicious, we ordered the 3 trials i forget the name. We got the peanut butter smores one, cookies and cream, and salted caramel. Delicious heaven, I don't typically eat desert but the waiter talked us into it and I am glad I did. Overall I will def go back. Want to try the pork chops when we go back and the alcohol root beer float."
Lawrence W.,"Beltsville, MD",51,10,,1.0,10/4/2015,"The waiters, servers, greeters curse among themselves in front of customers. Very unprofessional. Obviously the management doesn't care."
Sarah M.,"Laurel, MD",217,79,10,2.0,11/25/2014,"As a new brewery in Laurel I was excited to join. But I won't be returning here. First of all its a lawsuit waiting to happen. The floors are super slippery, it feels like you're ice skating & even the staff will admit it to you. The food is pretty pricey $25 for a pizza. (It was good.) The handicap section is not Accommodating as well, it's too tight & uncomfortable. The main reason for the such low review is the management. He did take a percentage off the bill but I wasn't complaining to get things for free. I won't be returning."
C J.,"Severn, MD",2,63,16,4.0,11/25/2015,"I ate lunch at the BJs Brewhouse in Laurel, MD. It was clean. The waiter was really nice and pleasant, came by several times to make sure that I was okay. I had the jambalaya. It was tasty and spicy like I like it. It has shrimp, sausage, chicken, red and green peppers with onions over rice. The food came quickly. I enjoyed this visit and would recommend this place for lunch."
Tay H.,"Hyattsville, MD",0,5,3,5.0,1/17/2016,Great environment great selection of food and drinks amazing sliders and great selection of beer ...very clean and staff is very helpful and pleasant
Neville E.,"Rockville, MD",45,7,46,4.0,8/28/2015,"I went to this place on my birthday. It was kind of dark in there for my taste, but I love it anyways. The drinks and beer all were delicious . I got myself the BJ's Classic Rib-Eye it was very tasty and done the way I asked. Along with the order of the Parmesan cheese wings (they were also fantastic!) my night was awesome."
Beverly H.,"Laurel, MD",86,3,,3.0,9/14/2015,"Let me start out by saying that I LOVE that Laurel now has a BJ's.  It's a hip, nice looking chain with good management. As one other reviewer mentioned, the vibe is cool.   I also like their happy hour options including the $5 lemondrop martinis.  Their black and blue burger is the BEST in this area!  When i stray past the burger, though, I sometimes get disappointed.  Sometimes the other meals come out well, other times, not so much....Management is great, though, and if they give you a bad meal and you complain they will redo it for you..."
Kristen H.,"Elkridge, MD",11,10,,4.0,1/11/2016,"We've been here three times now and our family loves it. The hand formed veggie burger is delicious. The fact that it's fresh not frozen is huge to me. The bun is tasty, the fries are really good too. They have cream soda on tap which is really good too. The pizookie for dessert was delicious. We've had the pumpkin, cookies and cream and now the chocolate chip. I have to say cookies and cream is my favorite. I didn't give it 5 stars because while the servers have always been friendly, they are a little slow. It's also extremely cold in there so bundle up! I can't wait to go back"
Melinda S.,"Laurel, MD",41,70,138,1.0,8/10/2015,"They have never gotten my burger right. I'll never go here again! They don't know what a medium burger is, all their burgers are tough and burned with no seasoning. They put every topping that I said I didn't want, on the burger, same with someone else in my party. There was some unknown object in my mayonnaise, the fries were completely COLD and the calamari was soggy and tasteless. Did I mention nothing was edible and the manager didn't even comp the meal?  We waited an hour for food that they messed up twice and gave up and returned the terrible food. Only to get one or two items taken off and another one added to the bill when the manager offered it as a substitute. Umm why offer it if you're charging for it? This is the worst restaurant in laurel. Can't even make a simple burger. And for some reason they hire 10 women to stand at the hostess stand and socialize."
Wendy W.,"Laurel, MD",5,26,8,5.0,7/1/2016,My husband and I were among the many who anxiously awaited the opening of this upscale restaurant in the new Laurel shopping center.  We were not disappointed - never have been. The food is very good and the service is too.
Scott W.,"Washington, DC",1,17,,1.0,12/19/2015,Well not very good. Our food set under a light probably 30 to 40 minutes before we ever received it. It came out looking dry and cold the waitress asked if the manager came over and spoke with us we said no. She said she would go tell them to come back which he never did and all he did was take off one of our appetizers. Which is fine but at least come over and say something. The beer was good that was about it.
Michelle R.,"Columbia, MD",0,27,39,4.0,6/19/2016,"Nice restaurant, great for groups, a quick bite for lunch or before a movie or shopping. The sample of beer for .05 is a must. I don't drink beer but found this to be a great way to sample the many brews they offer. I like the variety of dining options including the self seating bar area. You can sit at the bar or if you don't like sitting at the bar you can self seat at one of the pub tables. There is a middle section with small booths and a eating area for larger groups. Service has always been acceptable."
Eunice C.,"Columbia, MD",6,37,6,3.0,9/22/2015,I think this is a nice place to hang out with friends. I think the food tends to be on the saltier side and is not all that impressive. They have a good selection of beer and I like how the place is decorated. The staff is nice but I don't like to be called honey or dear by people who look like they're young enough to be my son.
Melanie W.,"Laurel, MD",26,43,18,3.0,9/1/2015,"BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse is good pretty much only for happy hour. The drink specials are great and the appetizers they have on special are awesome. However, my two experiences with going inside and being waited on by a waitress have not been good. My recommendation - stick to happy hour."
Trevelyn O.,"Miami Beach, FL",154,28,26,1.0,12/29/2014,Service not good ..trust me Long wait for food It's pretty bad when the people who work their think it's bad .
M H.,"Wiesbaden, Germany",0,7,12,5.0,9/25/2015,"Being from California, my husband and I were thrilled to discover a BJ's nearby! It has great service and the food we love and have missed so much. Pizza and pizookies! The best!"
Gray M.,"Rockville, MD",29,81,82,4.0,8/6/2015,"Food is very good. My favs are the clam chowder, any of the pizzas, sliders, strawberry lemonade, berry cider and the berry burst (cider mixed with berry lambic framboise), and the cookies n' cream pizookie! All very good. Good prices. Decent service. I mostly use curbside pick up. The noise level can get somewhat high. OH ANS MAKE SURE TO SIGN UP FOR THE REWARDS PROGRAM...it's free!!!"
Sanovia P.,"Bowie, MD",1,31,9,3.0,5/30/2016,This is based off of appetizers and beer. We had the siracha dry rub and root beer wings and an order of the Brussel sprouts. The wings were okay. The Brussel sprouts were dilicious. We sampled a few beers and I had a cider from the tap. I gave it 3 stars because the service at the bar was good. We would go again if we had to wait for another movie.
