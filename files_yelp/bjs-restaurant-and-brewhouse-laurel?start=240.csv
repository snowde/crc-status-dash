Ebony B.,"Bowie, MD",9,83,5,4.0,7/30/2015,Good happy hour prices and nice and spacious. I had the club pizza..it was just ok. Too Much bacon for me but others enjoyed it. Everyone that ordered..their food looked Amazing and complimented the food. The drinks were not strong but very good flavors.
Tom D.,"Burtonsville, MD",47,115,104,4.0,7/22/2015,"I can't believe I am saying this, because of my desire to stay away from chain/boxed restaurants, but I like this place!  So far the staff have been very helpful and friendly.  The fried jalapeño burger is amazing, great mix of flavors, and spice.  They have real food...My wife loves the salads.  You can eat here, get good food, and even eat healthy....But please save room for the Pazookies!!!  little cookie cakes that are to die for!  I love the cookies and cream Pizookie, but I have tried a few others and all are amazing!!!"
Maria M.,"Laurel, MD",37,23,9,3.0,8/22/2015,"First time ever at BJ'S! We arrived and had minimal wait time. Seated and server explain they were short staff but service was great by Danielle. Ordered variety of things: chicken wings, Brussels sprouts, calamari & thin crust pizza. Food came out quick. Calamari was excellent, chicken wings could have been crispier but still good. Pizza and Brussels sprouts were good too. Tried brew house blonde and really enjoyed considering I'm not a big beer drinker. Will come back."
Rhonda G.,"Laurel, MD",0,3,2,5.0,12/12/2015,"I am a regular customer.  Always something different to try. Seasonal drinks are amazing! Service is mostly great. Some exceptions,but it's not the norm. Try it once. You will return."
Pooh l.,"Savage, MD",0,19,1,2.0,12/7/2015,"Lovely set up and good food & drink options but it's the 2nd time I've been here and it's freezing cold. The bathrooms are freezing and so is the bar area. No hot water in the bathroom either. There was a terrible smell (dead rat) at our table. We asked Miguel our waiter who could smell it too and the best explanation was ""maybe the manager turned the heat on & there's something in the vent. Or someone just walked in with the smell"". Absolutely disgusting. Ruined an otherwise lovely evening."
Rianna D.,"Glen Burnie, MD",0,14,2,5.0,11/29/2014,"Our deep dish was delicious! We ordered a sampler and got 12 of their hand crafted beers, liked all of them. :D our waiter was soooo friendly and the atmosphere was great. We cant wait to go back! We walked to the movie theatre after dinner and it didnt take long, great location."
Jack P.,"Laurel, MD",0,4,,5.0,11/20/2015,"Went on a date here and really had a good time. They have a couple deals on their website that are not advertised on the menu or elsewhere in the restaurant. It's what you would expect from an upper-middle tier Americana chain restaurant - clean, not too loud, friendly servers, interesting decor, etc. The food itself was really, really good, and while it's a little pricey, it's not over-priced; definitely glad I went, definitely looking forward to going back!"
Michelle S.,"Arnold, MD",0,4,1,1.0,1/25/2015,"I hate that I'm even giving this place one star. It was our first time coming to this restaurant, and upon walking in, we were told it would be 15-20 minutes to get a table. No problem! 10 minutes in the hostess asked if we wanted the table ""over there"" (in the bar). We said, ""sure, no problem"". As we stood there, she says, "" you can go on over there"". *** This is super disappointing since we didn't know ""which"" table we were walking to, and there was no greeting or any kind of service at this point. Once we arrive to this table... It was dirty, and not even ready. So we go back to the hostess, and she says, ""just go over there and sit down, they will clean it for you soon"".  Once we wait for THAT to happen, we sit and wait for a server to come over and get our drink orders or ANYTHING for that matter, and 10 minutes later..(no joke) he comes with a napkin and says, "" I'll be with you in a minute"". 15 minutes for that, 10 minutes for refills and 20 minutes for the overall checkout process. For nonalcoholic drinks, appetizer and two burgers, it took 1 hour and 45 minutes. Quite disappointing.  For the food aspect: Burgers were over greasy, and one was overcooked. Fries were thin type fries and floppy. The California flat bread was great (the best part of the entire visit).  Overall, I will NEVER step foot in this place EVER again. Worst $45 I've ever spent."
Kai S.,"Washington, DC",3,16,9,5.0,7/12/2015,"I eat here at least 3 times a month. The customer service is ok i guess. No, they need work. The food is amazing though, I never had a dish I didn't like. The parmesan crusted chicken is bar far my favorite item on the menu, its a must try. The pizza is great, everything is just so good. And the salted caramel cookie with ice cream on top...OMG...I can't.....literally...."
Steve E.,"Laurel, MD",56,84,84,4.0,6/9/2015,"My 3rd time here but first time sitting at the bar by myself. I was here to watch the NBA Finals game 3. The bartender did not have a name tag or introduced himself or maybe I didn't hear him. Ambience was not loud, i was able to talk on the phone with no problem. I ordered the shrimp tacos(3) with a side of nacho chips and a Brewhouse Blonde, one of my favorite beers here and it complimented the tacos well. The shrimp tacos where good and came with 2 sauces (green creamy spinach yogurt  flavor and a red hot spicy flavor). Both sauces were delish on the tacos. I then realized the bar has a beer I recently was introduced to and like ""Big Wave"" from Kona, Hawaii. my tab came out to around $22-23.00.  I left $30.00 because I didnt' want to dig in my wallet for exact change and tip."
Angela O.,"Laurel, MD",33,16,,2.0,7/1/2015,The food quality was mediocre and the food prices were too high. The service wasn't great. I was disappointed. The long island ice tea I ordered was terrible and since there wasn't a price on the menu I was shocked to see it was 10.50. Everything about this place was off.
Yuwa A.,"Owings Mills, MD",3,56,12,5.0,4/2/2015,I'm familiar with the Woodland Hills Location in Los Angeles. My favorite dessert is the chocolate chip pizzokie. I visited the new location in Laurel and I had an awesome time. The burger was delish! I tried the salted caramel pizzokie but I didn't like it. Oh service was great! I give this place a 5 star!!!
Kafi H.,"Severn, MD",25,7,,2.0,10/21/2015,"The food is amazing! However, the wait staff left a lot to be desired. They were scares and when the did manage to get around to you they acted like they didn't care. The two stars were for the food. The staff just didn't want to help. The Worse and I mean the worse experience I've every had with food service and that includes McDonalds."
Ashley Z.,"South Side Slopes, Pittsburgh, PA",1,4,,2.0,7/17/2015,"The first few times i visited this location, i received an excellent meal with a longer than usual wait time. The last time i went  was horrible service.  My friends and i were told an hour wait when there were about a dozen empty tables clearly visible and no other people waiting. We chose to sit at the bar. No one approached us. We asked 3 staff members if someone would wait on us, finally the 4th did. Again, slow service and the waitress had a major attitude.  Overall, the food is good and the facilities are clean. Disappointed in the service. Unfortunately there arent a lot of nice late night places to go in the Laurel area so this place will have to do"
Tiffany P.,"Dundalk, MD",0,3,4,1.0,10/17/2015,"Tonight was my first and last time at this resturant.  Latasha was my waitress poor customer service and inappropriate language. She called me baby and sweetheart, unacceptable! The food wnd atomosphere were nice but I will not pay for poor service."
Village B.,"Savage, MD",0,22,,3.0,10/16/2015,Hubby and I decided to try them out for dinner one weekend. The food was good. Friendly staff. I would definitely try it again.
Sue S.,"Odenton, MD",0,4,,1.0,10/15/2015,Went for the second time yesterday for dinner.  Got the pulled pork.  It wasn't pulled.  It was hard chunks and the sauce wasn't very flavorful.  I had the Cole slaw on the side and I didn't even bother to eat it; it looked awful with chunks of purple cabbage and what looked like thousand island dressing in it.  The onion straws were just soggy onions with the breading coming off despite me having everything else (sauce and slaw) on the side. The shoestring fries were nice and hot at least. The draft root beer was awful - flat and dull. Last visit big had ribs that were so tough I could barely eat them.  At least the draft beer made me not care so much.  We'll find another place to take our work party of a dozen people elsewhere next time.  This time or server was attentive which was bette than last time.
Kiona C.,"Laurel, MD",31,3,,5.0,10/15/2015,"My fiancee and I went for a celebratory dinner. First thing that I must mention is our server Miguel, he was fantastic! He certainly set and carried the tone of our great evening. The food was delicious and everything came to the table very fast. Now the dessert.... OMG the dessert. We had the smores peanut butter cookie and the 3 mini pazookie sampler (boy were we celebrating). Everything was too delicious for words lol. I'm thinking of the dessert as I type this! 5 Stars!"
Shake N.,"Bowie, MD",0,19,6,1.0,5/29/2016,"I have been to this restaurant twice. Each time I had a terrible dining experience. I have worked in the restaurant industry before so mind you I'm very patient with my servers within reason. The first time I went with two friends and no one greeted us for maybe 35 minutes and we were sitting at a booth by the bar, so finally we ordered an appetizer of buffalo chicken and potato skins. They brought our food before the appetizers and the food was cold and very poor quality. But the icing on the cake was the buffalo chicken they brought out was literally tysons frozen chicken nuggets warmed up with hot sauce lightly drizzled across the top. The potato skins were freezer burned and the potato was deflated it was literally just the skin and it was burned. Needless to say we weren't please our waiter barely came to our table and our drinks from the bar took an hour and my drink was never even put in. The second time I went I went with a friend and he ordered some type of beer sampler and that came out nice but I ordered a patron margarita and the server forgot to put my drink in, and then he also barely checked on us the entire time, and my food wasn't that great I ordered a personal pizza and the cheese wasn't fully melted it was just awful. I'll never be going back here"
Kerri W.,"Hanover, MD",22,18,12,1.0,12/30/2014,"This is one of those times I should have listened to the reviews... Granted it was quite busy for a Tuesday night but the service was atrocious and I saw enough servers and bussers around that I was expected a better experience.  First off, we felt extremely rushed to order everything. It was my friend and I's first time here so we were checking out all our options. Our drinks didn't come out for a very long time, and after asking if they would be out soon they miraculously arrived leading me to believe the bar wasn't as backed up as the server stated.  We ordered our appetizer first then the server came back to take out entree order. Lo and behold our entree came out before the appetizer! Which of course was then blamed on the kitchen as well. Honestly the only reason I gave this a one star was because the food was pretty good and the drinks were pretty good as well especially for the reasonable price.  As for the service itself, we felt extremely rushed and if I'm going to be rushed I at least expect the product to come out quickly.. Which it did not. When our entree arrived before our appetizer we didn't even have any silverware and after asking for some, we waited for a bit then received two forks on top of a black napkin. I had already looked around and saw other customers with black napkin rolls of silverware so wondered why we did not receive the same thing. I then had to ask for a second napkin since we had only received one and also for the side of sour cream I had ordered that did not come out with the food. I also asked the food runner when he brought the food out but didn't get it then either. I was made to feel like I was being demanding but all I was asking for were items necessary for eating the meal that I shouldn't have had to ask for.  And to top it all off our food and drinks were cleared while we still had a few bites and sips left but if our server bothered to ask us we would have asked for a few more minutes to finish. Then she dropped off the check without a word and without asking us if we wanted dessert. Which we had ready decided we did want and had to try and add on as our server zoomed by. Just so disappointed with our experience even though the food was good..."
