Charlie P.,"Laurel, MD",35,1,,1.0,5/26/2016,I will never return to bj's brew house in laurel or any bj's ever again. Will never never recommend this place to anyone
Genevieve D.,"Elkridge, MD",0,10,,5.0,7/5/2015,"I had the dessert platter, which is 3 different cookies (that are warm) with ice cream on top.  The cookies were AMAZING.  My fiancé and I had eaten at another restaurant and had only  went in for a few beers but i couldn't pass up their desserts.  We both regretted not eating here. We will be going back to try their food and to have their desserts again.  Their beer was decent too.  We sat at the bar so the service wasn't bad, but it was really busy so I can understand other people's complaints."
Paul P.,"Columbia, MD",79,18,30,4.0,11/18/2015,Beer selection was great.  I had the French dip sandwich. The sandwich was a little small compared to what I was used to but for a lunch portion it was OK.  I liked the shoe string french fries.  Service was a little slow but server was polite and friendly.
Patricia L.,"Laurel, MD",2,51,70,2.0,6/24/2015,"The food is okay, nothing to rave about. Had the spinach stuffed  and the Cherry Chipotle Salmon. Appetizer took 30 minutes, dinner took 55 minutes and its only Wednesday. If speed does not improve this location will not last as there is too much competition with just as good food if not better and quicker service. Waiter was friendly."
Michael S.,"Laurel, MD",39,7,,4.0,3/13/2015,"Five stars from me, my boss and i went in for lunch, first time to any BJ's. It was crowded, but our server was great, refilled our drinks, explained the menu, i got the Southern Fried Chicken dish, it was amazing, freshly battered golden brown, not tough in anyway, you can tell the chicken is fresh and they change the grease as they should. The dish i got was huge and only $7.75. My boss got the personal pizza and was happy with it as well. Will surely be back."
Kisha S.,"Columbia, MD",1,34,13,5.0,6/20/2015,"I go here all the time with friends, took Mom and Grandma for Mother's Day and they LOVED IT this place never disappoints! From the drinks to the food to the wonderful staff it's always a great visit. Laurel really needed a place like this"
K.J. Y.,"Hyattsville, MD",2,30,2,2.0,5/5/2015,"Came in for a late dinner on a weeknight. We were greeted promptly and seated pretty quickly. The restaurant seems to pride itself on its selection of beers, so if you're not a big beer drinker you might be missing out on what this place has to offer. The food itself wasn't bad tasting, but the kitchen definitely needs to work on it's prepping. I had a California Chicken Club sandwich, the avocado slices that came with my sandwich still had rind attached! The kitchen just sliced the avocado like a tomato and put it on my sandwich! Also another person in my party ordered the flatbread pizza. The entire pizza arrived unsliced and my dinner guest had to cut it herself with a knife & fork. I would give this place another chance but at the same time I'm not going out of my way to dine here again either."
Jennifer C.,"Washington, DC",91,21,,3.0,3/2/2015,"I went back a second time last week with my boss and a few others from office, having had a great experience the first time around.  As usual the wait time was 20 - 25 minutes but we found a spot in the bar area. The service was great but unfortunately someone in our party got food poisoning from the fish.  Bummer to be up for four hours throwing up.  Go, but don't order the salmon."
J. O.,"Silver Spring, MD",0,10,5,4.0,9/8/2015,Good looking bar. Large menu. Pleasant experience. Service was quick and friendly. I will definitely visit again.
Steven F.,"Fort Meade, MD",15,6,,5.0,7/8/2015,"Not too shabby a place. I haven't had the opportunity to sample any of the in-house brews due to going there with my family (I will not drink in front of my children), but the food is awesome. If you're in the area and would like to try out a good place to eat, this is the place."
Duane Q.,"Silver Spring, MD",2,18,1,2.0,7/6/2015,Was ok and nothing great I heard good reviews about it but food was just average first and last time eating here.
Kerri B.,"Fort Meade, MD",2,51,,3.0,5/3/2015,"We decided on BJ's for our 25th anniversary dinner. The service, top-notch. We had spinach topped mushrooms for an appetizer, amazing. We both ordered the rib eye steak. All I can say, is don't!  Unless of course, you LOVE salt. Could not enjoy the wonderful taste of a great cut of meat because the salt was way too potent. Dessert, I believe it's called cookies and cream pizookie. YES!!!  Order two!!!"
Pina R.,"Mount Vernon, NY",36,110,35,5.0,4/2/2015,I like this place! I was visiting for the weekend and came here for lunch I like the fact that they have a beer sampler. That was pretty good.  I ordered the mahi-mahi tacos that was pretty delicious; anyhow the food and the crowd and staff are good and the service was prompt. I really like this place and will  come here again next time I visit. It's in an open shopping mall.
J C.,"Millersville, MD",23,29,1,3.0,8/10/2015,"Food is great, pizza is yummy, kinda high compared to other  restaurants, service sucks, there are a very few who actually seem like they like there job, overall ok"
Cheavaun C.,"Chevy Chase, Washington, DC",5,20,5,5.0,5/7/2015,Great service!! Had us seated soon as we walked in. Happy hour prices are good. Southern fried chicken was top notch!!! Will be returning.
Milton C.,"Silver Spring, MD",69,2,2,1.0,12/13/2014,"Worse service ever! Don't come here unless to want to wait 20 minutes to order, 40 more minutrs to get your food;15 to get the check and after 10 minutes they still have my credit card and holding me hostage! No food is worth that abuse!"
Gamal H.,"Laurel, MD",64,10,,4.0,2/9/2015,"My wife brought me back a pulled pork sandwich. It was amazing! Definitely the best I have had in this area. Famous Daves has an OK pulled pork sandwich and Red Hot & Blue has lost a step with theirs. This place has an all around great one. Big, stuffed with meat, soft bun and they got the Cole slaw right. Not runny so when I put the slaw on my sandwich and bit in, not a bunch of juice dripping out. They went with slaw chunks which gave a nice crunch when you bit in. I'm not a fries person but these were nice and seasoned. They gave the fries that resembled shoe strings, reminded me of the ones I would get at Houstons. Only reason I didn't give 5  because I got the sandwich cold by the time it reached me from wife's travel and I had to warm up in the microwave. It was really enjoyable even reheated so I would love to taste it fresh out the kitchen while dining in. I highly recommend!"
Jon Z.,"Laurel, MD",9,1,,1.0,7/22/2015,"Horrible service waited for 20 minutes to be seated not even busy at all, this place is racial profiles  white couple in front of me got seated immediately when we walking just same time."
Char W.,"Laurel, MD",0,4,,4.0,9/5/2015,"It has quickly become Laurel's new hotspot. I have tried a variety of food and beers. I have loved all of them. Their deep dish pizzas are very good. Their happy hour specials and beer flights prices are also worth a visit. The wait staff brings out food though, then randomly calls out of the name of the dish as they walk along their bar. You can easily grab a dish or two for free.  LOL. They clearly need a better system for the bar area."
Sara L.,"Silver Spring, MD",0,10,,4.0,7/21/2015,It nice place. Okay prices and good food. Staff is really nice and friendly. Only thing is that it is very dark. Hardly any light.
