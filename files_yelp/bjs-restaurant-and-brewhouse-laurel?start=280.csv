Rozalino W.,"Alexandria, VA",0,5,,4.0,2/26/2016,Excellent beer selection (of course). If you're a sports fan this is the place for you! Tons of tvs and great food.
Katie R.,"Laurel, MD",80,4,,5.0,8/31/2015,They are always so good about cooking their Gluten Free pizza! They are kind and fast! My son has never gotten sick and we go back monthly to treat him yo pizza! We love their food!
John T.,"Silver Spring, MD",0,2,,1.0,12/29/2014,"First time here, Slow service and ran out of burgers at 5pm on a Monday night.. How do you run out of a staple like burgers especially on a Monday night? Cancelled our entrees and asked for our check which took another 20 mins to get. Manager was apologetic but I'm leaving hungry...Big disappointment, go somewhere else."
John H.,"Randallstown, MD",10,104,4,4.0,1/11/2015,"Despite being open for a few months now, I only managed to dine here on for the first time on Friday night. I had the fish and chips which were pretty good. The waiter was also able to score some cocktail sauce for me ( which is rare because most places don't even serve it with their fish and chips, which is beyond me!) Nice atmosphere and the crowd was pretty lively. It's a shame they don""t have live music here, it would be the icing on the cake. Great place check it out!"
Isaiah E.,"Laurel, MD",0,1,,1.0,1/10/2015,Terrible.  The parking sucks and we waited for our RESERVED seat for a long periolodically time. The tables are nasty.
Melissa Q.,"Washington, DC",21,8,3,2.0,3/14/2015,"This past Friday my friends and I called ahead to reserve a spot at the restaurant. What a horrid customer service experience! It took us 30 minutes to get a table even as we called ahead. And the waitress 'Latasha' treated us in a very unfriendly way. She rushed us with the checks. My corn fritters were over cooked, and my ahi poke had two little, measly pieces of avocado. This is definitely a hit or miss experience because a couple of weekends ago, I went to the bar and had a good time with great food. Maybe this is a place to visit on a less busy night."
Elaine H.,"Arnold, MD",46,88,11,5.0,2/10/2015,"Went here for lunch. We had a beer flight you get to choose 4 for $6.95 the calamari was ok just a bit greasy but the clam chowder is out of this world, loaded with clams. Try it in one of their toasted bread bowls. Make a great meal!"
Jason C.,"Key West, FL",36,28,19,4.0,11/26/2014,"Finally, something truly new and fresh in Laurel. What a great addition. Sunday went with my kids. Great and friendly service by Gabrielle. With the addition of this and Regal movies no more Arundel Mills. Went back for happy hour...Mojito's need work..Avocado Spring Rolls delicious...overall a happy customer and welcome to Laurel."
Heather G.,"Virginia Beach, VA",34,2,,4.0,3/20/2016,Had the Spinich and artichoke dip as an appetizer which was amazing. Also had the deep dish ziti which was delicious. Would definitely go back. Server was a bit slow and came back infrequently.
Rhommé M.,"Silver Spring, MD",0,3,,5.0,11/12/2014,I went in yesterday just because I wanted to try the West Coast renowned Pizookie. This was their 2nd day being opened for business. The service was great! The food was great! And the Pizookie.........WAS EVERYTHING! I ordered 1/2 Chocolate Chip & 1/2 White Chocolate Macadamia. The kitchen messed up & made 1 of each. So they gave me both at no additional charge! WINNING!!!!!!!!!
Ozzie P.,"Laurel, MD",0,4,1,3.0,11/30/2014,"Most of the other reviewers are correct. The food, in my opinion, is excellent. The service is lacking, bringing down the rating. Maybe I just got the newbie server. I will come back though, and hopefully, if the service then is better, I can change the rating"
Karen F.,"Elkridge, MD",4,120,,4.0,2/6/2016,"Stopped here for lunch.  Had the sliders, calamari and pizza/salad lunch combo.  Food was good, nice portion size and prices reasonable.  Service was friendly and knowledgeable. Tried the draft root beer - was excellent.  Nice atmosphere - good place to hang out, have a few drinks and some apps."
Melinda R.,"Beltsville, MD",119,11,10,5.0,1/1/2015,"The wait was LONG but I had a huge party of 20... but once we were seated we all agreed it was worth the wait. The food was delicious,  reasonably priced, big portions, and a friendly waiter even sang a solo rendition of happy birthday to me upon request after I caught him singing while cleaning a nearby table! The mgr apologized for the wait  and all was well!"
D W.,"Bowie, MD",3,36,27,4.0,1/25/2015,Good food...nice atmosphere...we live the root beer!  Lots of choices for wings...the burgers are great (they are huge)!  The kids menu offer lots of choices too!  Try the beignets for dessert...delicious!
Janet H.,"Laurel, MD",185,154,50,4.0,11/24/2014,"3.5 stars rounding up. not bad, not wow'ed, pretty solid chain. we had the mango thai salad and definitely enjoyed it. we also had their bison burger and it was decent, not over-done, cooked well, just lacked a bit of flavor. we also had their flat bread appetizer (which came out at the same time as our meal, and so the table got a bit crowded fast), that was ok as well. all-in-all it's not bad. it is a chain and it has the typical solid chain feel/taste/comfort. like other BJ's i've been to, this is similar to the rest to make me feel like it'll be consistent in quality, hopefully. this is in the new laurel towne center and just opened up. having said that, the servers were all trying to get use to the menu, as are we of them being around (wasn't sure what came with the bison burger.. cole slaw? a side? fries?). so i give them a little lee-way in that regards. with that in mind, they were definitely trying and were on top of filling our drinks, taking away our plates, etc. our particular server seemed a bit nervous!, but i think that wasn't because of the patrons but actually the other waiter watching from behind, all the time.. guess he was a newby in training.. poor guy =P"
Val W.,"Washington, DC",0,2,,1.0,2/23/2015,"I came here on 2/18/15, after hearing rave reviews from friends.  What a disappointment!  The host was unwelcoming and unaccommodating with our seating preference (even though there was availability).  Next up, our server arrives and has an accent so thick that none of us can understand anything she says.  Ugh!  Now to the meals - the lasagna was just ""so"".  Very underwhelming.  The double cheeseburgers were good and cooked to order.  The ribs were overcooked and dry, but the mashed potatoes were a hit.  The side of broccoli was four florets that had been blanched in water and thrown on the plate. Once was enough for me.  I won't be back. :o("
Prissy C.,"Laurel, MD",15,18,4,4.0,12/23/2014,"Went here for dinner this past Sunday for the first time. I tried the scallops dish because I love scallops not realizing it was under it's""Enlighted section of menu meaning healthier options. And not only was it only 370 calories it was filling and very good."
Kristin P.,"Parkville, MD",0,27,2,5.0,4/22/2015,Me and my husband and my son just went there for lunch and we will definitely be back for sure we loved the beer and food ! The dessert was amazing we had s'more with peanut butter it was amazing love love love !
Jayme D.,"Parkville, MD",50,10,20,5.0,12/6/2014,The food here is great. There is so much to choose from. The house beers are great! Hefeweizen and Oasis are my favs! I will be back!
Jodi K.,"Jessup, MD",0,12,1,2.0,1/26/2015,"2 stars for the atmosphere and that's it! I've gone twice and both times they completely screwed up my order. The first time I had to wait 40 minutes just to tell them my med rare steak was med well! I'm not a fan. For just opening, they need to get it together!"
