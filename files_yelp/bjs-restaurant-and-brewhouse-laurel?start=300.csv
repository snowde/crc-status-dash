Trina B.,"Laurel, MD",0,4,,2.0,12/15/2014,Called ahead for seating at 4:30. Arrived at 4:15. Didn't get seated until almost 5pm.  I was furious and management didn't seam to care. The Hostess had a terrible attitude which is not good for customer service.  The food was just okay after all that. Will not be dining here again.
Amy B.,"Laurel, MD",0,16,8,5.0,2/10/2016,Love the food great drink selection. Friday's they seem to get busy but the service is pretty good. I love coming here for drinks and appetizers.
Lisa B.,"Beltsville, MD",54,7,4,5.0,3/1/2015,Love love this place. Its our weekly lunch spot. The ribs are awesome. The jambalaya is wonderful. Great atmosphere and the bar attendant (blonde hair) is wonderful.
Barbara R.,"Laurel, MD",6,13,1,3.0,2/28/2015,"Very slow, not enough staff, didn't like the mani tacos, the salmon was good, drinks were great,"
Shelley R.,"Hanover, MD",2,10,2,4.0,12/20/2014,"Really good food, great beer selection. Our server, Ryan was awesome. Made awesome selections and recommendations for us. It was busy when we came, but he made us feel like we were his only table. The food runner was less than pleasant though. He basically threw the plates on the table. And when we asked if he could clear the couple of empty plates, he rolled his eyes, huffed and snatched the plates from my hands. He was probably having a bad day. Other than him, I had a great experience."
Donna M.,"Laurel, MD",24,9,2,4.0,11/30/2014,"I LOVE this place don't get me wrong with ALL the televisions on SPORTS  imagine my surprise when within 2 weeks of them being open I was there eating and having a gr8 time watching a game and I cheered loudly when Mark Schwartz one of the mgr on duty came and told me to keep it down because ""this is a family restaurant"" ...........really??!!!   BREWHOUSE???!!!!  so while I was completely embarrassed and turned off I vowed never to go back but I will...why?? I want to be there on a Ravens Sunday and if I hear ONE person cheer they better get checked too!  OAN Mr. Schwartz learn some tack on how to tell someone to be quiet in a bar!"
Stacey H.,"Washington, DC",0,2,,2.0,1/16/2016,"I love the drinks here!!!. However the food........... Should be taken off the menu. I have come here a few times, hoping it would get better with time. Yeah, didn't happen. The food is either over cooked or just...off. The pizza is terrible, and the burgers are.....for lack of a better word, undesirable. I would recommend this place for drinks anytime, just eat somewhere else before you come."
K. T.,"Baltimore, MD",25,14,1,1.0,10/19/2015,I had the most disappointing meal I have had in a long time after waiting outside in the cold for my order for an extra 20 minutes for curbside AND tipping for the privilege.  The tacos literally had two slivers of fish the size of nickels and three of the smallest shrimp I have ever seen in my life.  I asked for cheese and sour cream on the baked potato and paid for it but got neither.  I feel totally ripped off and won't be ordering from there again.
Clyde M.,"Beltsville, MD",0,21,,4.0,9/17/2015,"Super service, menu is limited. I had the jambalaya, the best I had in this area, but it doesn't beat Louisiana's."
Amirrah P.,"Laurel, MD",161,2,1,5.0,9/11/2015,"Amazing!!!! I have only been there one and I loved it. The vibe was great, the food was great, and the house brewed beers are great. As someone who is only a occasional beer drinker I enjoyed their house brewed stout very much. Will be making this my ""let's grab a drink"" place."
Patricia J.,"Washington, DC",4,42,33,4.0,1/26/2015,"First visit, was great stop. I had the jambalaya which was perfect, presentation was also nice. The service was great. Low lights, overly eager guys walking around stalking for dirty dishes was annoying. My service was great."
Jo W.,"Ellicott City, MD",0,27,,4.0,12/7/2015,Good food.  We had excellent service on the last visit.  Busy place but pleasant atmosphere.
Madeleine F.,"Jacksonville, AR",1,12,,4.0,8/7/2015,"We love BJs, but we only go and sit in the bar area. The service isn't that good anywhere else in the place. They have a great happy hour menu and the drinks are reasonably priced. In the fall, be sure to get their pumpkin beer. It is amazing!!"
Joe J.,"Gambrills, MD",566,247,1188,4.0,3/23/2015,"If you don't mind a crowd, and a potential wait if you don't book yourself on the guest list. Then this is the place. I took my lady here for valentines day, and we had an amazing time. The only draw back is getting seated in a area with a loud large group, when you're trying to have an intimate conversation. However watching a woman order an entree and have damn near every appetizer on the menu being brought to her at the same damn time, while punishing cups/shots of alcohol was very entertaining/impressive to say the least. The food was really the highlight of the evening. I had a rack of ribs that wouldn't quit, and she ordered the jambalaya. We were both thoroughly impressed with our food, and that was especially good seeing as how it was a special night for us. I will repeat though that this place seems to stay packed, but the food and service i received was excellent. Sometimes a place is so packed because they are just good. There is a high demand for there services, and they seem to be delivering quite well. With all the people visiting here I'm sure you'll read a bad review or 2, but remember that a--holes eat out too. This is one place i will say you should judge for yourself. I may not do valentines day here again, but I'm damn sure going back! The food/Service  the wait . I'm a fan."
John D.,"Laurel, MD",0,14,,2.0,10/20/2015,"The food is decent, the drinks are usually great.  But timing is off.  I think the kitchen staff is asleep.  I like to go but it can never be a quick bite.  I need to make it an event.  Step it up guys, you have a great location and the product is outstanding.  Are there managers working to oversee the operation?"
J. M.,"Washington, DC",0,41,,2.0,1/6/2015,"Came in on a whim looking for dinner.  It was a Tuesday night and they were pretty busy.  Most of the tables had someone at them.  It apparently was half-priced wine night.  They have about 30 national as well as craft beers on tap.  They also have 11 house beers on tap that BJ's allegedly brews, uh, somewhere, but not here apparently.  Food arrived in a relatively timely manner.  I tried the carnitas fries which were served in a deep mini pizza dish.  The fries were okay on top, but got way too soggy on the bottom.  I got a small 9"" pizza which was warm, not hot, and some of the cheese looked like it was just starting to melt.  The pizza is deep dish, which I usually like, and it is similar but not as good as Pizzeria Uno's, in my personal opinion.  The service was okay.  At first they were checking on me too much, then when I wanted to pay my bill, I had to wait.  Overall, the prices for the quality of food they serve are a little too high.  For 1 soda, 1 beer, 1 appetizer and a rather small pizza it was almost $40 with tip for one person.  I give them a ""Meh."", and can't say that I would come back..."
Brent P.,"Laurel, MD",0,13,3,5.0,9/26/2015,"My favorite dish is the Mahi Mahi.  Cooked perfectly with the pineapple fried rice which is unique w/ carmelized pineapple chunks with rice, onions and a few sprigs of cabbage I believe.  The Pizookie is a delicious dessert... sampler or all one flavor on a warm pie cooked cookie.  Yes, drinks are a smidge pricey but the staff are great and environment is good also, not your average chain restaurant."
IslandQueen 1.,"Columbia, MD",0,3,,1.0,9/14/2015,"Ribs to salty - sent back.  Replacement steak also too salty and this time cheddar mash potatoes saltier too.  Uncomfortable wait times for initial service and replacement meal.  I had finished my meal and ordered a second round of mushroom caps while waiting for my date to finally be able to eat.  While manager was actively canvasing for customer feedback, he was ineffective in mitigating the situation - no discount  or extras offered for salty food and excessive wait time.  While the drinks were tasty and decor pleasant, the temp was uncomfortably cold.  Overall impression, we won't be returning."
Jack K.,"West McLean, VA",0,517,,4.0,5/19/2015,"Very nice experience.  I liked my cheeseburger--large, well-prepared and fresh ingredients.  I order the fried artichokes on a total whim (I am not an artichoke guy).  These were awesome, slightly addictive.  Our server was very nice and attentive."
Pat H.,"Laurel, MD",0,9,,4.0,8/19/2015,"Great food and service!  Definitely a place to visit even though service can be a little slow sometimes, however, the food is worth the wait."
