K B.,"Bowie, MD",0,41,4,4.0,7/25/2015,"Good food, service and atmosphere. Pricing is average and as expected. Large menu and selection of food and beer.  It was busy when we came late on a Saturday night, but only waited 5 min to be seated.  Our server was friendly and attentive.  We had the mahi mahi tacos and Hawaiian mahi mahi and both were very good."

Marcel N.,"Chantilly, VA",0,3,,2.0,12/18/2015,"I came here a few times after they opened for HAPPY HOUR and found it to be appropriately priced for a relatively good quality of bar food. Nothing special but not bad and also affordable.  Half price wings, sliders, flat bread s, etc.  $4 drafts.  Happy Hour...right?  As another reviewer commented here, the happy hour specials are terrible now...an absolute joke.  You only save $1 off of $7 beers and $2 off of a $12 serving of appetizer wings.  There is nothing HAPPY about that.  Other appetizers are now priced in the same $12 range...and you get to save a meager $2 for Happy Hour.  Appetizers used to be half off and were priced at around $9.  You could get a plate of wings and a draft beer for about $10...Now, you better plan on $20.  You actually pay more now at Happy Hour than the original full price.  You now pay $9.25 for happy hour wings that used to be $9 at FULL PRICE and $4.50 at happy hour.  I will take my business to one of the local establishments that isn't intent on gouging people at Happy Hour.  I mean, really...who goes to Happy Hour to pay $18 for three draft beers? Took my wife there for Happy Hour and was very disappointed when the check came...don't go here expecting to save money at Happy Hour.  We saved $8 on a $60 check.  On top of it all, the service is very slow.  There is only one bartender on duty at Happy Hour responsible for the entire bar area in addition to making drinks for the restaurant.  Management has certainly found a way to increase their profit margins...one bartender and inflated prices.  TGI Fridays, Applebees or even Famous Daves offer a much more affordable happy hour.  If you do make the mistake of heading here for Happy Hour...be sure to bring plenty of patience and cash.  You have been warned."
Gagandeep K.,"Sacramento, CA",77,15,15,3.0,11/29/2014,"I'm from California, so when I heard that there was a bjs restaurant opening nearby, I was thrilled to go there. I've been going to BJS for the past 7 years so I know what to expect. My visit there yesterday 11-28-14 for lunch with my husband was Ok. It could've been better. The prices for some reason we're higher then cali. Also the menu was different. For appetizer, I ordered shrimp thai lettuce wraps and they were delicious. My husband ordered a small Mediterranean pizza and enjoyed it. I ordered lunch size pasta which on the menu was $8.95 (it was 8 something) but was charged 13+ for it. Their reason was because I ordered shrimp instead of chicken. I wish I was informed prior to ordering that 8 small shrimps on my pasta would've been $5 extra. And when you can count your meat, it's not good. I was not very happy with that. Our server apologized and that's about it. Overall service was good. Our food came out on time. Prices are high here so be prepared."
Joelyne K.,"Laurel, MD",30,119,18,1.0,1/2/2015,"My  husband and I have been there a handful of times and have tried to give them the benefit of the doubt because they are a new location. Unfortunately, each time has been the same and we actually take tally now of how many times we think they will mess up our order(s), before we arrive. For one, they are extremely slow. They do not refill your drinks unless you ask and no matter what you order, don't expect them to get it right. I wish I was exaggerating but I am not. It is truly a shame because their food is very good and they are going to loose business over this. While their food is good, they are very stingy on the vegetable toppings on pizza and pastas. If you ask for mushrooms, I literally think they count 3-4 of them and throw them on your plate, just to say they gave you extra. Then they charge you $2.00 for the extra toppings. It is ridiculous. Same goes for other vegetables. They are very skimpy on pasta portions as well. The service is horrendous. After eating our meals, we sat at our table for 30 minutes before the server came back and then asked, ""oh would you like your check""? As if we wanted to be there the entire night! Plain and simple, they have great food but service sucks! Be warned."
C. J.,"Norman, OK",0,16,,5.0,5/3/2015,"Michael was my server and he did a great job. He was upbeat, funny, and very helpful. The happy hour options are not all that great, but great customer service made it worth the visit."
Jason J.,"Laurel, MD",0,6,,2.0,4/27/2015,"if only you knew how terrible their dish washing operation.(or at least was a few months ago) this is the only reason i don't go there, and i liked the food. but that's how serious it is"
Rene M.,"Laurel, MD",3,22,13,5.0,2/21/2015,great place to go the service is fast and friendly and the food and beers selections are great i really enjoy my self
Lisa M.,"Beltsville, MD",82,21,,2.0,2/20/2015,"First there, and no rush to return. My waitress wasn't really friendly either was the hostess. Not to impressed with this place..."
Martha A.,"Georgetown, Washington, DC",14,4,1,1.0,1/17/2015,Bad service!!! I got better attention at the bar then at a table!!! Food was reheated took forever to get glass of water!!!! Needs improvement!!!!
Chance H.,"Linthicum Heights, MD",0,3,,2.0,1/13/2015,The manager was not helpful. We received a free entree but was told that because we did not purchase a steak that the entrees we ordered did not qualify. We will make our point with corporate. Then I asked about purchasing a growler and was told that because of Maryland they cannot sell growlers of beer. This is ridiculous because every other brew pub i.e. DuClaw and Pub Dog sell growlers. This is ridiculous. At least the waiter was good.
Kay J.,"Laurel, MD",0,3,,3.0,12/12/2014,Food is pretty good but their call ahead service is useless. You are still waiting  just as if you walked in. We called ahead on a friday night at 6:50pm and still wasn't  seated until  8pm....go during the week
Brad C.,"College Park, MD",0,4,,5.0,11/28/2014,Excellent food. Lindsay was great. Very knowledgeable of the menu and super friendly.
Bryan K.,"Silver Spring, MD",0,1,,3.0,11/22/2014,"A lot of beers on tap. Home brews are decent. I would recommend getting a flight (sample of 4). Their IPA and Stout were good.  Had a burger that was greasy and lacked any real flavor. This is a new place and they're working on a lot of kinks which affects the customer service,  but the staff works hard and tried to accommodate as best they can. I sat at the bar and they seemed overwhelmed mostly because things are new and there are bound to be issues. I'd give this place a shot again"
J S.,"Laurel, MD",0,6,,1.0,12/8/2014,"I have been to other BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse locations before, so I was eager to check this new one out.  WORST.  IDEA.  EVER.  I would have given it zero stars, if possible.  My date and I went to celebrate a major life accomplishment and were hoping for a special evening--it was ""special,"" all right.  First, they messed up a very straight forward drink order.  After we had placed our order, the waitress came by to tell us that both different cuts of meat we had ordered were sold out.  That is *somewhat* understandable, but that is the kind of thing of which you inform someone BEFORE handing them a menu and letting them set their heart upon it.  A salad came with additional ingredients that were not mentioned in its menu description that were disgusting, and, had they been mentioned would have prevented it from being ordered.  Furthermore, our waitress was slow, inattentive, and inefficient.  When she finally got around to bringing the check (which we had to ask her for four times), it was wrong.  We spent about 45 minutes there unnecessarily.  Go to this restaurant if you're looking for a long night of frustration, subpar service, and second- or third-choice menu items."
