Ivan G.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",159,34,70,4.0,2/26/2017,"My fiancé and I had a meeting with the wedding party at this restaurant last night. I highly recommend making a reservation because they were packed. Noise level was above moderate but I'm sure that was due the large groups. Tasha was our server and was amazing to say the least. She was on point with everything. What kept me from giving this place 5 stars was the super sized menu! There were too many choices. The beer menu was great but the food menu was ridiculous. I get wanting to cover every option so everyone can dine there but come on. From pizza to seafood to burgers and wings then ribs and salads, whoa! I ordered ribs by the way and they were tasty my fiance had the shrimp tacos and she enjoyed them but had they been a focus on the menu I feel it would have been better. Just my opinion."
Heather M.,"Honolulu, HI",413,170,263,3.0,12/16/2015,"Went for a going away thing and we have a lot of people. It was pretty crazy whenever food/drinks came out because the runners didn't know who ordered it so would just be going up and down the line yelling whatever it was. Then everyone would be yelling it down the line haha. Would of been better to assign seat numbers for everyone that worked that table.  I was impressed when the server did our checks though. She kept the checks separate for everyone which was nice.  The place lacks many vegetarian/vegan options. I opted for the baby kale and brussels sprout salad. It came with blueberries, grapes, seeds, goat cheese in a raspberry vinaigrette. It was pretty good but was kinda skimpy on some of the things and I was still hungry after.  Fiancé got the brisket burger and he said he enjoyed it.  At a previous visit, I did get the portobello mushroom burger and that was really good. If you take off the cheese, it could be vegan. Make sure to specify that you want the all vegetarian burger because the original has some meat in it still."
Brooke T.,"Baltimore, MD",514,546,433,2.0,6/21/2016,"Slightly underwhelmed.  In the 'new' Laurel Plaza. Heard its good for a drink or whatever. Fair parking, wait was pretty awful. Not sure what was going on. Had a toddler with us, despite telling the hostess on at least three occasions, they did not provide us with appropriate seating. We ended up sitting in the bar area without a high chair. Odd.  The flights are cool, and decently priced. The food was alright. Brussel sprouts were grilled nice, the salad that I had, the Sante Fe was pretty large, decent.  Food is just okay, service slightly less than that. We were seated in a high traffic area, but felt that we were forgotten about.   Download the app for deals.  Can't say I'd purposely return, maybe I'd try happy hour."
Talisha R.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",51,107,96,5.0,6/26/2016,"Came here for dinner with my family and it's was a great choice.  Every dish that came to the table, I tried a little of each. The ribs was moist and tender and comea with two sides. Both my niece and nephew order them with shoe string fries and they enjoyed every bit of them. My husband order the deep dish pizza and he almost finished a medium by himself. I had the cobb salad that was packed with a good heaping size of all the veggies.  We also ordered calamari and mozzarella stick for our appetizer. The drinks were specialty with homemade iced teas and lemonade. The service was pretty fast and pleasant. Great solid restaurant that I look forward to visiting again."
Jeff T.,"Silver Spring, MD",1378,52,90,5.0,7/3/2017,This place has some amazingly good BBQ ribs. You do not want to pass these ribs up. The unlimited soup and salad lunch deal is a steal
A C.,"Odenton, MD",0,1,,5.0,11/12/2017,"Came here for Veteran' Day. Everything ordered at my table was delicious and service was fantastic! The prices are comparable with chain restaurants, but based on the taste and quality, you know there is a legit chef(s) in the kitchen."
Marcus M.,"Washington D.C., DC",108,15,28,4.0,2/10/2017,"Nice casual dining experience. Portions are decent. Our server, Tasha, was attentive and offered recommendations since we were first-timers. We'll return!"
Ashley N.,"Alexandria, VA",0,14,2,3.0,6/18/2017,"The food is blah. It's okay, but not great. The waitlist app is a good option. You get a free pizookie if you sign up for the online points program but I'll warn you it's not the full size version at all. I'm not even being ungrateful I just think that's totally tacky if you ask me.  What I do give an extra star for is the healthy option. (I know I just complained about a cookie. That was for my husband)  The root beer wings are amazing. Peruvian quinoa bowl was decent but I could make it at home easy. Nothing special. The Salmon was dry.  I've had that Brussel sprouts super salad before and it was soooooo tasteless."
Julius L.,"Southern Maryland, MD",18,52,112,5.0,1/28/2017,"My crew and I stopped in for lunch. Pleasant atmosphere, bartender was very cool. Had the shrimp tacos and a side of steamed spinach. Food was good, i would go back."
L V.,"Columbia, MD",1,30,2,1.0,11/9/2016,"Been here a few times and quality has gotten worse and worse. Tonight we ordered a steak... We got a hockey puck and an ice cream scoop of potatoes. When we brought it to the attention of our waiter and the manager (who stopped to ask how things were), neither offered anything to remedy the situation. So now we have bad food and bad service. Save your money... Go somewhere else."
Valencia S.,"Bowie, MD",38,21,54,4.0,1/28/2017,I have to admit service started off rocky but Ariana saved the day. She was absolutely wonderful. I ordered the fish and chips which was recommended hubby ordered buffalo grilled cheese sandwich with the root beer wings. Everything was so tasty.  Ariana stay sweet
Rummy V.,"Columbia, MD",316,232,988,4.0,10/23/2016,"It was my first time here and we came with a party of 14, the table was reserved with no issues! I had the salmon with asparagus and mashed potatoes and it was soooooo good! I had to order a side of fries because I found myself eating my friend's fries, they were thin and crispy just like I love! The food was excellent and the service was fast and great! For a large party they were smart to provide two servers. However, it took a while for the food to come out (45minutes). There is coupon attached on Yelp and it applies providing $10 to 35+. There are tvs everywhere for your entertainment. Where we sat was near the doors and it was freezing...That was my biggest complaint, the doors are very close to seating and that cold breeze brings discomfort but besides that we all loved it and wouldn't mind coming again!"
katrina h.,"Crofton, MD",4,15,15,3.0,12/3/2016,Pretty cool spot. Nice selection of beer. Make sure to use the app to get the call ahead seating.
Nia A.,"Washington, DC",5,3,2,5.0,5/13/2016,This is def one of my new fav spots now! The food is freshly prepared. The drinks creative & tasty. Atmosphere is nice too. I'd def return. Nice spot for different occasions as well. I tried the White Peach Margarita & Jumbo Meatballs & Spaghetti.  One Word: Delish.
Camille M.,"Springfield, VA",60,16,12,5.0,8/10/2017,"First time coming here. Came when they first opened at 11am. My friend ordered Chips & Spinach Artichoke Dip, soooo yummy and the chips were freshly made. I ordered a House Margarita which tasted just like a lemonade with a punch! I ended up getting two of them. I could not decide on what I wanted to order so I ended up combining two different grilled cheese's that they offer...I basically got the Buffalo Chicken Grilled Cheese add Bacon (make it like the Chicken Club Grilled Cheese) with pickles added and ranch instead of blue cheese. IT WAS SO GOOD! I was full off half of the sandwich but could not stop and ate the entire thing. The French fries are THE ABSOLUTE BEST!!!! Would definetly come here again."
Candace G.,"Laurel, MD",69,96,212,3.0,5/16/2016,Our server was very friendly and knowledgeable but the wait time for our food was entirely too long! We didn't order appetizers and our food still took over 30min to come out smh! Besides that I ordered the Mediterranean chicken tacos which came w/seasonal grains. It was very light and tasty. Definitely good for those like myself who are on diets lol. I'd say try this place out if you have absolutely nothing to do after.
Courtney K.,"Annapolis, MD",357,1747,2174,3.0,8/3/2015,"Bottom Line:  Better than most chain restaurants with a decent beer selection. Located in the Towne Center at Laurel.  I'm really not a fan of chain restaurants but I never mind a trip to places like BJ's or Cheesecake Factory because I generally find that the staff is a little more refined, the food is better quality and the drink options are plentiful.  Here is my take on the Laurel BJ's: - The menu at BJs weighs about three pounds and is as long and varied as that as the Cheesecake Factory's.  Having said that, the nice thing about BJs is there is something on the menu for everyone.  Although BJ's is known for their pizza, my favorite dish is the Parmesan crusted chicken with blanched brocolli and cheddar mashed potatoes.  - As should be expected when you have ""Brewhouse"" in the name, BJs offers a great selection of drought craft beer and their house beer is decent as well.  Their beer menu is nicely displayed on the wall in three sections:  craft beer, BJ's house brew, and local craft beer. I'm not one for girly-fruity drinks but on a hot summer day I actually do like their BJ's Berry Burst cider.  It doesn't taste much like a cider to me but rather a carbonated fruit drink, but not too thick, sweet or heavy.   - This BJs isn't as large as other locations I've been too but that is ok with me since less people means less noise.  The open air concept here and lots of hard surfaces can make for a noisy experience but during off-peak times the restaurant is quite comfortable."
Kelly K.,"Northwest Washington, Washington, DC",1,11,24,2.0,8/6/2017,"I've been to this BJs several times over the last year. When we first started going, the food and drinks were really good. The food and the service made you want to come back for more. We even took our kids a few times. Now fast forward to today. The service is ok but I would rather have a server that didn't wipe their nose so much!  Every time I looked at our server, he was wiping his nose across his arm. That is nasty and unsanitary!  The food was ok but could have been better."
Dorrie S.,"Ledyard, CT",33,2,,3.0,7/19/2017,Server was slow. Food was cold and I had to send it back. After dinner we waited over half an hour for our dessert. Not sure when or if we'll be returning.
Brian M.,"Seattle, WA",0,15,,4.0,10/12/2017,BJs is one of my go-to dining choices when I travel for business. I ate twice at the bar at this one this week. Bar tender was friendly and attentive. I love their pulled pork sandwich and ribs. They also have a great soup snd salad deal for lunch. Always a good place to eat.
