LaToya E.,"Baltimore, MD",451,580,816,2.0,5/6/2015,"I wanted to wait until I made a few visits before writing a review for this place, mostly because i thought maybe they were just having a bad day.. I guess I was wrong!  Each time I went the same problem presented itself, the service was extremely lacking! The wait staff would barely check on us and would frequently forget things. Once I went with a large group and the waitress took everyones order except mine and walked away from the table.. she was flagged down and brought back to only realize she knew she skipped me. The first time I went my dinner guest had to get up, go find the waitress and bring her back to our table to take our orders! The only reason I have returned is because the drinks are decent!  As far as the food its been a real hit or miss.. The deep dish pizzas are good and ive had a few appetizers that ive enjoyed (the sliders are my favorite) but sometimes ive been disappointed with the food. The worst offender was the California Chicken club that came out so burned others at the table could smell it!"
Sakeena J.,"Rockville, MD",63,22,4,1.0,7/25/2017,"This place was meh. We had a really sweet server named Shannon. We came for ""happy hour"" before walking to the theater. Happy Hour is in quotes because they don't have happy hour on Friday????? Weird. I wanted Mac and cheese, but instead of Pasta they use quinoa. No thanks. The ribs were just ok. They tasted very gamey. I didn't like the strawberry mojito. My spinach came in a bowl with water. It was too wet. Do they boil them? Blech. Somehow my asparagus had pepper on it. Super spicy. Not good spice because I like spicy food as long as it's flavorful. The asparagus were very small and had a dull color, I don't think they were fresh. My baked potato was fine.That's hard to mess up. I don't think my meal was worth $40.  Parking was easy."
William S.,"Washington, DC",13,5,7,4.0,7/7/2017,"Love the Avocado Spring Rolls and craft beers!  Good atmosphere for dinner, happy hours or catching a game."
Sandra A.,"Greenbelt, MD",73,2,,1.0,4/10/2017,Horrible food and they take forever (aprox. 50min) to bring the food to the table. I won't be back.
Shannon W.,"Takoma Park, MD",0,27,1,2.0,7/23/2017,We must have come on a bad day; no CO2 therefore no soda or beer. Ordered a Cobb salad which was so-so nothing to write home about. Also had sliders for an app which were flavorful but the meat on them was the size of my thumbnail. Wouldn't recommend with so many other options in the area.
Vonnie J.,"Oxon Hill, MD",13,92,180,4.0,5/13/2016,"I would give this place a 5, but sometimes the wait can be quite long. I have eaten at this place since they opened. The service is always great and so is the food. The place doesn't have enough lighting for me, but I see well enough to order. The nice thing about the menu is the have healthy and non healthy lol. I have had really good burgers with bacon and I have had really good salmon. No matter if I am watching my calories or is I just don't care I always have their famous ""Pizookies"", girls gotta live a little. My sons and friends love their deep dish pizza and the prices are not bad. This place is worth a try, Sat eve seems to be the most crowded time. Enjoy"
Carolina G.,"Bethesda, MD",26,5,1,5.0,4/11/2017,"My husband and I have been going to this location since we moved to Maryland almost 4 years ago and out of all the times there was only one ocation where the waiter was not pleasant at all but all the times we can say we've been satisfied with our food, we recommend to go for beer and pizza but anything you get from the menu will be delicious. Staff is friendly and courteous."
Laura K.,"Ellicott City, MD",24,57,3,5.0,9/16/2017,"Was worried by mixed reviews, but I had a wonderful lunch here today.  Server was good.  I had a berry cider, chicken club flatbread which is HUGE, and we did the trio of cookie ice cream things.  Tried churro, monkey bread, and the caramel cookie.  I loved the cookie one, the monkey bread one tastes like a cinnamon roll with ice cream and was really good, and the churro one was ok but my least favorite out of the three.  I will be back!"
Jamie W.,"Silver Spring, MD",35,160,8,3.0,9/5/2017,"Overpriced, crowded and my food was not memorable. I'd give it another try,but there are so many other restaurants to choose from."
Junaed S.,"Hanover, MD",166,67,73,5.0,10/9/2016,"Only ever had dessert here, but that's enough to earn this place 5 stars. Service is great, and dessert options are plenty. The custom brewed sodas are good! Try the baked desserts. Will definitely be back for a real meal!"
Maureen M.,"Santa Monica, CA",21,148,577,5.0,4/9/2016,"Great brew house. If you like fruity beer...that does not taste like beer, try the BJ'e Berry Burst cider! You can get it by the pint or the pitcher."
Jubilee C.,"Silver Spring, MD",1,28,,2.0,2/18/2017,"This restaurant sometimes has some good dishes like the artichoke appetizer, other appetizers and some of the pizzas. It's also pretty popular. I just wish the food options were healthier. So many fried foods here with unhealthy sauces. Otherwise, it's an ok place to try at least once."
Tyron H.,"Washington, DC",38,126,43,4.0,8/6/2016,I visited today for lunch and the drinks were on point. The bartender chick is definitely a master at her craft. They have tons of menu items for every appetite. I had shrimp with mahi mahi. The quality was a little above average. The ambiance is relaxing and family friendly. I recommend.
Michael B.,"Hyattsville, MD",1,20,2,2.0,5/16/2017,I used to love this place until we had a catered party of 45 that we had at this location.  What happened next was very disappointing. Empty buffet table. People waiting for 30 minutes until they brought out more food and servers who could care less because they put an 20% gratuity automatic gratuity. The attitude of the manager and servers were less than satisfactory.
Danielle C.,"Laurel, MD",0,15,,4.0,6/16/2017,"Ate here recently and had never been in before but was curious to see what it was like. The ambience is wonderful for a chain restaurant-especially the patio section. Ordered appetizers and wings during HH and the fried asparagus was to diiiie for. Wings were ok, and so were the mozzarella sticks. Didn't drink at all sadly so have to come back for that because they have an extensive drink menu. Overall good service and definitely worth a try!"
Tanya T.,"Pasadena, CA",0,76,,2.0,7/6/2017,"It seems like a theme at bj restaurants; crappy service. The one in Pasadena, CA has the same crap service . waited 10min for menus and water.very inattentive waiter."
Sheisakeeper T.,"Laurel, MD",31,4,5,5.0,12/6/2016,This place is awesome!!  From the rootbeer bbq ribs to the brussel sprouts with Sriracha !  Cocktails were delicious. A decent priced family style restaurant some items are a little pricey but it's worth it the pizza is phenomenal too.
Rose D.,"Washington, DC",14,52,67,3.0,1/16/2016,"This is a ""go to"" whenever my dad and I are out of ideas as to where to eat in the area. We tend to go around lunch/early dinner, and even before the nightly crowd, it gets pretty crowded. You can either sit at the bar, which is very colorful (to me), you can sit in the middle where you can hear the hustle and bustle from the televisions in the bar but still maintain somewhat of a conversation without being distracted, or you can sit on the opposite side of the bar, which is far away from the noise and you can actually listen to your fellow eating mates.  This is a nice restaurant, but there's nothing spectacular about it. To me, it's just a fancier replacement for the Greene Turtle (which closed a while ago).  I always order their jumbo meatballs and spaghetti. Pretty nice dish; they add hot crushed pepper in there for ya, and it comes with a nice fluffy and crunchy (good balanced) garlic bread.  Service is a hit or miss. Usually the waiters are good when it comes to serving their guests, but we had one (I know, it was JUST ONE) who 1.) got my dad's order wrong, and 2.) charged us twice for my dad's meal (once for the mistake and once for the correction). It was one waiter,  but still, this waiter had two strikes. Again, this is a nice restaurant in the area. Food is pretty good, the environment is fun (let me put it that way). But don't hesitate to check out the other restaurants that are close by!"
Paul S.,"Columbia, MD",119,236,,3.0,9/9/2016,"Decent food, huge menu of choices. Sat at the bar and service was just OK. May return if I'm in the area"
Linda S.,"Laurel, MD",20,6,,1.0,1/3/2017,"This was our last attempt at eating here.  1st there were plenty of empty clean tables but we had to wait for a booth.  2nd the place is so poorly lit you can barely see your date let alone the menu.  3rd they don't carry Budweiser!!  That alone made my husband want to leave.  However, we ordered drinks and our waiter disappeared again.  My husband went to the bathroom, came back still no sign of our drinks.  Told the hostess to cancel our drink order, we went someplace with good lighting, fast service, Budweiser and warm bread.  Next door at Outback.  Going there now to give them 5 stars for rescuing our evening."
