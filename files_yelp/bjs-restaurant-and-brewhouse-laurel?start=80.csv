Elain X.,"Baltimore, MD",263,141,47,3.0,12/21/2016,"Have you ever walked into an establishment and no one spoke to you and no one was around to greet you so you stand there awkwardly waiting.... that was my first impression of this location. I've been to the one in Tysons Corner and I do like that one. When we were finally greeted by the hostess, who was so rude, it was almost as if we came in to bother her. We told her we had made a reservation for 6:45 PM and so she looks around then looks on pieces of receipt paper and told us there was no reservation under our name. We called in earlier so we could avoid the wait but there was nothing for us. She went to the back and came out to tell us someone else had spoke to us about the reservation but didn't write it down. She was very short with us and told us there was a wait so we asked to speak with the manager. The manager came out and I explained the situation to him and he said they didn't take reservation and only call a heads and we had to wait anyway. Well, maybe you should train your staff to tell people that instead of writing names on pieces of receipt paper laying around or not even writing it down. While we waited the hostess had a confrontation with a man behind us with a similar situation. Not an organized establishment at all! We were seated about 10 minutes later and my fork had crusted on stuff on them, TWICE. Our waitress was really nice though and she came back to refill waters and checked up on us.  The food was decent. I got the Ahi Tuna Salad and for dessert I got the Chocolate chunk pizookie, which was really good. I would hesitate about coming back here. Definitely not my first choice at all."
Sylvia B.,"Odenton, MD",343,353,2337,4.0,11/15/2015,I really enjoyed my dinner here at BJ's l was recommended to go here from the lady that do my nails.  She lives in the Laurel md area and she recommended it. She said she came here with her family one Saturday night after work and had the pizza.  She also stated that the flights were free.   I knew that couldn't be possible because how could they make money giving away free beer flights but l wanted to try them out anyway.  Especially since they had fruity flights.  Woo-hoo l enjoyed every bit of it.  I never drank a glass so fast in my life. It was delicious! Especially the berry and the Raspberry.  Those were my favorites.  I really enjoyed all 4 flights and the pizza was sooo good.  It was thin crust and only 110 per slice.  Not bad at all. It was called BJ Brewhouse Classic. Very crunchy and seasoned just right.  I don't normally do thin crust but that pizza was on point.  Good for 2 people but if you're sharing with a larger group you might want to get something bigger.  We definitely enjoyed our visit and we didn't have to wait long for our table.  The waitress was also very busy but she tried to stay on top of things.  The only wait was when we was ready to pay.  They started to get pretty busy.   I would definitely recommend and return.
John W.,"Silver Spring, MD",0,6,,3.0,5/12/2017,"The service was good, waitress friendly and attentive, the appetizer was very good.  I ordered an entree salad and was just slop, I couldn't eat it. I was shocked when I told the waitress that I didn't like it and she could take it away, her response was simply  ""ok"". No question about why I didn't eat it, no offer of another choice.  Not going back."
Candle P.,"Washington, DC",154,24,8,5.0,2/10/2017,Excellent customer service! Came in 20 mins before they closed and still was treated like royalty! The bartender Brittany was great on suggesting drinks along with food! Definitely will be back
Autumn A.,"Odenton, MD",25,8,27,4.0,9/30/2016,"Everything s good here!!!!! Foods wise. We had the salmon, baked ziti, kids mini corn dogs, fried mozzarella sticks, everything tasted great! However, I could not say the same about the service . The waiter we had was slow on everything and was not attention at all. Hope to see improvement on the service."
Sanjana S.,"Arlington, VA",1,3,,1.0,8/13/2017,"We used to love their food but when we went there recently the food was horrible: stale lettuce, super salty, etc. Never going there for food!"
Nat F.,"Washington, DC",12,106,65,3.0,6/21/2016,"Food is not that good here unless you are probably drunk.  I will, however, recommend the Jalapeno cucumber margarita on ice.  It was absolutely divine."
Dana And Danielle C.,"Carrollton, TX",45,33,77,1.0,6/10/2016,We've always been a fan of BJ's ribs because they are simply amazing! But this location definitely left something to be desired. It was a combination of either under done or over boiled. The ribs were not tender AT ALL!! The mashed potatoes were luke warm and the asparagus was drenched in butted. When it came out it looked beautiful; but this was one time where looks were deceiving. The service was great; but I wouldn't recommend the ribs at this location to anyone. Stick with pizza here!
Michael K.,"College Park, MD",0,58,,2.0,1/3/2017,"Dinner Monday 1/2. I guess a lot of employees phoned it in, because at 6 pm the service was nonexistent. Kitchen was running out of everything (pizza, pasta). No refills offered during dinner. Multiple tables around us walked out after waiting 30+ minutes with no service. Apparently kitchen staff and hostesses were pressed into service as wait staff. Evening manager strolling around the restaurant avoiding work couldn't have been more useless if he was dead. Food, when delivered, was cool or cold. Note to self: if you walk in and see multiple tables that haven't been bussed, service won't be up to BJ's usual standards, so turn around and leave."
Maxfactor C.,"Laurel, MD",14,50,,3.0,1/13/2017,"Loved the set up, love the craft beers... but food was bland.  Perhaps I will return and try something else."
Lady T.,"Charlotte, NC",44,15,50,5.0,2/13/2016,What a great dining experience! Went with my bestie for drinks and appetizers! Pleasantly surprised! The service was AWESOME... thanks Dave!  The calamari was the best I have ever had! And then the dessert... Peanut Butter Smores ... HEAVEN!!!
Tiffani C.,"Fort Washington, MD",44,53,24,4.0,8/13/2016,"Sat down on a Friday evening with a couple of friends who already vouched for this place and they were right on. It was better than decent food and drinks at a, coupled with an attentive staff. Menu is LOOOONG and it took a while for me to select, but I settled on the Bacon, Avocado and Tomato Grilled Cheese. It was very good. The aioli was a great match for the dish.  I still go there for lunch runs w/the coworkers. They enjoy their takeout dishes as well, and I've had zero complaints. Love their APP too."
David D.,"Beltsville, MD",4,15,27,4.0,2/18/2017,Great beer great food great tvs. Nice place to go chill. Get a seat by the bar booths.
Karl D.,"Silver Spring, MD",159,90,114,2.0,1/11/2016,"I came here with my family of 4 for lunch on a Saturday. We waited about 10 minutes to be seated, which was fine. We decided to come here because of their promotion of buy one entrée, get one entrée free during lunch from 11 am to 3 pm. We asked our waitress right away if there was a way to use the deal for all of us. She said, ""We could have 2 separate checks so we could get 2 entrées free."" We were glad that we could do this. However, later when we got our bill, our waitress told us that we can only use the deal once per table even though she said we could make 2 separate checks so we can use the deal twice. We felt that we were misled. I would rather have them tell us that we cannot use the deal twice than telling us that we can and then when we already had finished eating tell us that we can't.  Now on to the food part! I got the buffalo bison burger, which was okay but the edges were too charred giving a very bitter aftertaste. The salad that came with it was not good, they should change the dressing that they use. I also got the chance of tasting the lemon thyme chicken and the toasted chicken pesto sandwich. They would have been good if they were not too salty. However, get the appetizer called the Best Beginnings Appetizer Combo. It comes with yummy avocado egg rolls, chips with spinach and artichoke dip, mozzarella sticks, and Santa Fe spring rolls. Everyone will be happy, especially when you cannot agree on what appetizers to get! How can I forget their scrumptious pizookies, which is a warm cookie contrasted with ice cream. The greatest combo ever that will leave you very satisfied!"
Danielle L.,"Washington, DC",27,16,,1.0,3/22/2017,"I called early in the day to set a reservation in the evening for a party of 10 and I was told ""we do not do same day reservations"". Umm it's in the middle of the week in Laurel! I refuse to believe BJ's will be so crowded that they can't reserve a spot for 10 people. I wish I could give no stars because they would not work with the me (the customer). What restaurant would rather lose money because they didn't want to push a couple tables together?? Horrible"
Amy A.,"Silver Spring, MD",0,43,18,5.0,3/10/2017,"Great atmosphere. Great food for dinner and great dessert choices- better than any other chain restaurant or ""typical"" restaurant. Today, they have sine new items on the menu that work for me as a non-meat eater (apparently I'm not allowed to say vegetarian, my brother, the meat-eater, tells me). The selection of beer is the largest for this Laurel, MD area that I know of so far. Oh yea....there's many TVs turned to various sports channels for those that like sports."
Bobby H.,"Laurel, MD",16,17,,5.0,3/5/2017,"We've only been in Laurel a couple weeks, but the service and food was so good at BJ's Brewhouse that we've already been back for more.  The staff is extremely polite, and the food is absolutely amazing.  We've had the new pita bread nachos, very good, and the deep dish pizza is really good as well.  My wife has had the Salmon and Cod dinners, she preferred the Salmon of the two but said both were really good as well.  My daughter always gets the pizza from the kids menu, which is plenty serving size for her and she really enjoys it.  Cozy laid back atmosphere with great people."
Mercy M.,"Takoma Park, MD",18,26,18,2.0,8/2/2015,"I really wanted to give this place 5 stars because the food is delicious but I really enjoy great customer service when I go out and they did not have that. I ordered the avocado rolls which were delicious. For my main course I ordered the rib eye well done. Fifteen minutes after I placed my order the manager (Mark) came over and told me they were out of rib eyes. He asked if I wanted the sirloin steak instead. After looking at the picture on the menu I agreed. My steak came out fifteen minutes after my friends food came out. When it came out, I noticed it looked nothing like the picture. It looked like a toddlers plate of food. I tried to brush it off. When cutting it open it was pink! I specifically asked for well done. I asked our waitress for Mark. He came over and apologized and asked if I wanted a new one. It would take fifteen minutes to cook. I gave up and told him I didn't want anything. He said that I should pick something else so I picked the deep dish ravioli. It was delicious. Mark took care of me and it was on the house.  Our waitress was horrible. She tried to remember everyones order instead on writing it down. She messed up my order and another friends order. She then started to get attitude when Mark got involved. We had to keep reminding her about to go boxes and drinks. It was just bad. I felt bad for Mark because I'm sure he had better stuff to than to do the waitress job. Come to this place for food. If you want awesome customer service go somewhere else unless Mark is there."
Eve H.,"Laurel, MD",0,22,,1.0,5/12/2017,"I was ordering take out and the cashier informed me that my card was declined. It was very weird considering I had more than enough funds to cover the 23 order. So after using another card, I received a text from my bank (the first card) stating that I needed to confirm an attempted fraudulent transaction. Whatever was going on in their system put my bank on notice, and they blocked the card until I confirmed I had tried to make the purchase. The next day the card that did go through had two fraudulent purchases. I will only go to this place if I have cash. Oh yeah the food....average nothing to sing about."
GleamoGirl J.,"Rockville, MD",32,9,,5.0,2/16/2017,Darius was a great server! Made my birthday lunch experience a fun one. I enjoyed my pizookie.
