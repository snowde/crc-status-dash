Vinodh Kumar C.,"Irving, TX",183,115,359,4.0,12/23/2017,"This is the Lewisville outlet located right next to Costco and Best Buy. Reaching this spot by GPS is very easy. Parking might be tough because there are too many restaurants in the complex. As we went in, we had to wait for the table to be ready for quite sometime even though there were many empty tables. May be they were short on staff the other day. Once we got our table getting the order in was fast. This is a brewhouse which means we need to try out their beers. Harvest Heiffivusen is one of their beauty products. The range of alcoholic items are very good like other outlets. Even though they specialise in beers, their food options are also good. Please try the chicken potstickers. Dinner at BJ's is never complete without a PiZzooKie. The staffs are very professional and friendly but some of them are not too good at explaining their products.  The only and major drawback here is the price. Yup, make sure you have a FAT wallet if u planned to have a long dinner."
Urvashi S.,"Nashville, TN",69,3,12,4.0,11/9/2017,"Went to this location first time. My four star review for this location here goes.  1. Ambience: very nice, relaxed environment with him lighting perfect for a nice dinner with family or date night. +1 star 2. Promptness of seating: slow very slow. I had to wait quiet some time in order to be seated so had to drop a star there. -1 star 3. Server: my server was Chris. He was prompt in taking my order as soon as I got seated helped me with the wine selection they had brought samples to try. Over all helpful and kept checking if I was doing ok +1 star 4. Food: Food arrived fairly quickly and was tasteful. I tried Bjs deep dish pizza. Try it if you like deep dish I am very happy I choose that food item. +1 star 5. Overall it was a great experience and my server drew a Thank you note on my check. Which was the last cherry on the top +1... =4"
Michelle M.,"Lewisville, TX",2,39,41,5.0,10/29/2017,First time here and very happy! One FREE BEER for veterans !  great food: broccoli cheese soup wings and a burger no complaints everything was soooo good BUT the server made this night GREAT ! Our server was awesome I asked a million questions and he answered every single one and he even drew us a little character on our receipt!!!  Awesome !!!!
Daniel T.,"Dallas, TX",8,46,41,4.0,10/7/2017,"First time going to BJ's. Overall, I had a good time here. The thing about BJ is that, they don't specialize in anything, so they have LOTS of options. A lot of different genres of foods to choose from.  1. I got the strawberry lemonade as my drink. Very refreshing. Get it on a hot day and you're set.  2. I end up getting the bone in pork chop. Absolute fantastic deal for the portion. They only serve the pork chop after 4PM!Comes with two sides. First side I chose was the chicken tortilla soup. Very delicious. I love that they add the avocado!  3. Pork Chop was decent. Not the best but still pretty good. This was mediocracy at its finest. Big size in my opinion so you can take it home. I chose roasted asparagus as me second side. Well done on the asparagus. Tasted amazing.  Ultimately, enjoyed the visit. Not anything to go crazy over but the variety of the foods served here makes this place a great place for groups. Great place to come if you're looking for a lot of options."
Howard S.,"The Colony, TX",13,356,440,3.0,7/29/2017,"This is your typical BJ's restaurant. An extensive variety of good food, draft beers, creative cocktails, and a reasonable wine list. The highlight of the visit was our server, Robin. He was one of the best servers I have ever had at a BJ's. Very attentive and friendly. Unfortunately, it seemed to take a very long time for our food to arrive. I ordered the pork chop with sides steamed broccoli and brussels sprouts. Although the Porkchop was at a very acceptable temperature, both sides were lukewarm at best. All in all, A good experience for a BJ's restaurant.  As a member of their rewards club-it was very cool but I could pay for my meal through my phone and not have to wait for the server to take my credit card, run it, and bring it back."
Ted A.,"Flower Mound, TX",1,143,58,3.0,7/22/2017,"An updated post for this location for a new dish, chicken fried hamburger.  According to our waiter, just added menu item, looked different, so gave it a shot  Its exactly what it says it us, a hamburger patty that has been lightly breaded and fried. Also the fried egg on top adds taste and a bit of a mess. Overall, not a bad burger, but honestly the fried  patty taste got lost in all of the other flavors. Its worth a try, just get a lot of napkins up front, and then keep asking for more napkins."
Santanu S.,"Flower Mound, TX",15,144,75,3.0,6/2/2017,"If I could name reviews, I would call this ""The Case of the Secret Sides"". I heard about the new slow-roasted menu and wanted to try one of the items. Although it looked appealing, the prime rib would have been too much food with the addition of the soup or salad. The Double Bone-In Pork Chop did not come with an appetizer, so I chose that. I chose the rice pilaf and white cheddar mashed potatoes as my sides. The pork chop tasted great especially with the rub. It was neither over- nor undercooked. Before the first bite, I was a bit hesitant because there was no sauce or gravy. The rub made them unnecessary. As for the sides, I enjoyed the rice pilaf. I could have done without the mashed potatoes. Only if I had known there were more sides available. Unfortunately, the menu is designed terribly. The only sides listed on Page 1 were the standard ""Signature Sides"". Page 9 had both the standard sides and the ""Premium Sides"", such as, honey sriracha Brussels sprouts, turmeric-roasted cauliflower, Peruvian quinoa & brown rice blend, etc. I was correct in ordering the pork chop. As I barely touched the mashed potatoes, I had room for dessert. For a chocoholic, there was only one option... Triple Chocolate Made With Ghirardelli pizookie. Unlike other pan cookie desserts, this one was not too thick. As a result, with the two scoops of double chocolate chip ice cream, it was the right amount of dessert for one. Although, it did come with two spoons. Although there were plenty of tables, I decided to sit at the bar today. There were a few folks behind the bar and always someone within earshot. As a result, I never had problems getting service. I would have posted this review when I was still at the restaurant. At the time, their free wifi was useless. The firewall was misconfigured and would not allow access to legitimate site including  ."
Connor B.,"Lewisville, TX",177,1,,1.0,12/26/2017,Be careful with what you tip here. They stole $20 dollars from me after I said pay half cash and half card they went ahead and charged the whole bill to my card and kept my $20 in cash anyways. Wasn't I mistaken tip either because I put it clearly on the bill that I would tip $7.50. Unacceptable and I will be filing a report with my bank.
Wade S.,"Lewisville, TX",0,1,,1.0,1/4/2018,"Went in to have a late lunch with my 10 year old daughter.  We were seated promptly however, after 13 minutes, I had to walk back up to the host.  Then another 3 minutes goes by and still no waiter.  We got up and informed the manager and left the building. Staff were standing around with no guidance from management, obviously."
Robin W.,"Spicewood, TX",71,344,184,5.0,6/7/2017,Fantastic service and food.  We had the chips and queso as an appetizer and it came out at a reasonable time before the rest of the food. We had an order of avocado eggrolls as a meal and 3 burgers. One of the burgers had to be on a gluten free bun and it tasted very good.  The burgers came with fries and they are very generous with the amount of fries.    I was very happy to see a lot of gluten free options on the menu.  Highly recommend this place when you have a group.
Ashleigh B.,"Carrollton, TX",455,326,114,4.0,3/3/2017,Great for a lunch special! Unlimited Soup and Salad for  $8.95. :)
Michael H.,"Addison, Dallas, TX",313,77,48,2.0,4/26/2017,"I really hate to leave bad reviews, but our experience here was just horrible, and it was by no means the first time. We went in at 5:30p on a Thursday when it was slower, so I thought we could get exceptional service (or at least decent) service.  We got seated immediately, however, we waited for about 20min with server after server passing us by (and no drinks at the table so we clearly haven't been helped) before I finally got up and went to the host stand in which they found someone to take over our table immediately. The 4 of us eventually ordered our drinks (a couple beers) and then a variety of food off the menu. 10-15 minutes after, still no beers but here come the food runners with our food, and boy am I thankful for the food runners so our food didn't get the lack of attention like everything else seemed to that evening. Giving BJ's 2 stars because food actually came out warm, in a timely manner, and tasted great. Just wish the rest of the experience could have been up to par."
Stephanie W.,"Lewisville, TX",15,25,2,2.0,12/2/2017,I usually love this place it is always good.  Tonight was different the waiter we had was awful and the food was cold.  I got the chicken club sandwich without  cheese and avocado.  When my sandwich arrived it had avocado on it no bacon or sauce (which comes on it) and it was cold!  The waiter did not pay attention to what I ordered and even admitted it at least he did apologize.  I'll still come back because this was my first bad experience there.  I sure hope it doesn't happen again.
Eric B.,"Lewisville, TX",0,112,168,4.0,8/25/2016,"I LIKE THIS PLACE it was service with a YES meaning anything we wanted to change or substitute the waitress answered with a big YES you can it was busy when we went but we did not have to wait long to be seated or to receive our orders, they seemed to keep the tables turning over quickly, I believe that comes from not having people waiting  One more cool thing they have a pokey stop in the restaurant and it was lured the whole time we were in  , for all the Pokemon fans"
Rahil N.,"Lewisville, TX",258,89,11,5.0,10/24/2017,This location is close to my home and I recently ended my loyalty to chili's. This place is always poppin. The specials are always great as you can tell most people are drinking. The service is never disappoints. Make sure you join the rewards program!
Wonju R.,"Houston, TX",154,163,65,3.0,5/7/2016,"Upon arrival, the host was friendly and seated us within minutes. We were seated and received the menus. The waitress took our drink order and as we were looking over the menu, we realized the table was still dirty and sticky. They had cleared it but not wiped it completely. I had to wipe the table myself.  Moving on, we ordered our food. We got the jambalaya, deep dish ziti, shrimp penne and the chipotle glazed salmon.  The jambalaya was SALTY! I'm not sure if that was their intention or not but it was very salty. The flavor however was pretty good. The ziti had mild saltiness and was a bit oily, but other than that had a good flavor to it. The shrimp penne photo was misleading with the abundant amount of shrimp. We got maybe 5 pieces of shrimp. The glazed salmon was the best of all the order. It has great flavor and the sauce was perfect, not too empowering.  The waitress was very friendly and the atmosphere overall is pretty good. I would say for what we got the price is on the higher end. I would consider coming again."
Godley V.,"Queens, NY",151,374,690,4.0,4/15/2016,"Packed house last Friday night so my party of 3 ponies up to the bar to watch the game while we waited and just ended up staying there and ordering our food right there. We ordered 2 pizza to share - a Spicy Hawaiian Chicken and a Great White. Both were tasty enough but can't compete with the legendary New York slices or Chicago deep dishes. The pizza crust was very bready, albeit not too dense or oily, and it housed the toppings very well.  The flavors were good but not intense. The bartender who took care of us was super friendly and chatted it up with us, even on this busy evening. He was eager to provide suggestions and offered a few beer samples to try out. They do have several house beers to try plus many well known faves on tap. We also split a dessert...the apparently famous (Chocolate Chunk) Pizookie. Being that we were all pretty full after the pizzas, sharing was the perfect solution. The Pizookie was pure chocolate goodness, basically a brownie topped w. chocolate ice cream. I love me some chocolate so I had no problem with getting the lion's share."
Samm S.,"Lewisville, TX",0,8,,1.0,4/28/2017,"I want to like this place. In fact when the food comes correctly, it's pretty good! However, that is IF it comes correctly. My husband and I order curbside pick up a lot and I would say 90% of the time something is wrong with our order:  -sides we ordered through a selection on the website aren't included in the bag -food has sauce when asked for no sauce -food is missing ingredients -food is overcooked -food is undercooked -food is SO heavily salted that it is inedible I've given this place so many chances to get it right. I've sworn this place off a few times only to go back. I've reached out to management about this multiple times. We're given a $20 gift card instead of having our meal comped (Which I guess is nice, however, it forces us to go back to use it). It's not even worth calling anymore when something is so far below standard.  If you're going to eat here, make sure you dine in. Most of the time I've had a good experience. But I'd strongly suggest staying away from curbside pickup. The order will always be incorrect or unsatisfactory."
Dan H.,"Overland Park, KS",1,3,,5.0,10/8/2017,"New to the area and found BJ's to be a great spot for a wide variety of food choices.  The pizza is 4+ stars.  Lots of appetizer choices, good chip dips, wings, etc.  The staff is very friendly and your cup is never empty.  Great place go and relax and watch your favorite sports game!"
Eric C.,"The Colony, TX",36,24,3,4.0,3/15/2017,"This location is my go to location since it's in an area where I typically run my errands. I haven't had any issues with the service here. Typically the servers and people here are courteous and very helpful. A couple of times, when it's busy, it's difficult to have super service, but that's understandable. I love the daily specials and the weekday lunch day specials are great as well!"
Daniel A.,"Lewisville, TX",0,1,,5.0,12/1/2017,"This BJ's has solid service, our server Kirby was honest and hilarious. He has some delicious suggestions and never let us without service. Me and my girlfriend had to return the next day! Loved it! Try the avocado egg rolls and Parmesan chicken."
Bryan K.,"Little Elm, TX",1,16,2,4.0,11/10/2017,"BJ's is always a good place to eat. Good food and excellent beer, if you can decide which one! Almost too many choices! My favorite is always the pizza.  Very hard to be and always delicious. This is a good place to come if you good food and service."
J P.,"Lewisville, TX",26,40,8,4.0,5/19/2017,I am giving 4 for one reason. The seasonal beer that comes out around November called The Grand Cru. That beer is the bomb. It's a triple Belgium that's 10% ABV. They now limit you to three but but as long as you walk out of the restaurant and not knock over a table you can get more than three.  I had five of these and don't remember how I even got home. I woke up the next day with a new tattoo and only wearing socks. Pretty good beer. As far as the food....the food is ok. Pizza is good and the spaghetti is good too.
Carl L.,"Carrollton, TX",21,36,,2.0,8/24/2017,"Always like BJs but this time not so much. Hendricks martini was spot   were the grilled veggies (asparagas and brussel sprouts). However, the ribeye steak had a lot of gristle.  Very chewy and not so good.   I probably should have sent it back but my wife already had her food and we had someplace else to go after the meal. Server was nice and mostly around when needed. Very loud.  Toward the end of the meal it was hard to talk Food Rating =  Very good for everything except the steak.  Will get something different next time"
Mohamed H.,"Dallas, TX",0,4,3,1.0,10/26/2017,Very slow service  it takes long time to get my order and the follow up from the waiters very very slow
Katherine W.,"Carrollton, Dallas, TX",1156,449,3291,4.0,7/14/2015,"One of my favorite American chain restaurants, beers come cold, and pizookies come hot. This place can get pretty busy during prime lunch and dinner times, but I've always had decent service. I recomend getting any of their craft beers because they always taste fresh and crisp.  Foodwise I recommend coming for their lunch specials which range from mini pizzas with a single topping (plus it comes it side salad or soup), or half sized sandwiches and pasta. You definitely must not forget to finish your meal off with a pizookie, trust me you won't regret it.  They have a rewards system which is nice, you need to download the app and sign up, but points can rack up pretty fast, just be sure to show your user ID to your server before you check out so they can add the points to your account.  Overall I've always had a great experience and the food is always tasty."
Joel A.,"Irving, TX",142,17,12,5.0,1/10/2017,"Location is meddled with construction along 121 and 35 but the restaurant is not hard to find/navigate through the streets!  Came here with a large party (12 people) during lunch and made reservations beforehand and the table was ready well in time so kudos to their preparation. They have a wide array of beer selections, so I suggest giving the drinks menu a look! They have a bar, large style sitting areas and one on one sitting areas so this place is perfect for almost any time of the day! This place was not super crowded during lunch there was a steady flow of people coming in and out and the restaurant definitely had enough seating (i.e. No wait time).  I recommend their deep dish pizzas the crust is very soft and the sauces perfectly complement each other. The most popular ones I've been told are buffalo chicken, chicken bacon ranch and bbq chicken! The only thing is their chicken falls off the pizza a lot and it looks like the chicken was added on after it baked. Nonetheless, the pizza was still great! You can also do a half and half pizza as well. You can easily split a medium with a friend if you're hungry or a small if you guys aren't that hungry. Pizzas came in about 15 minutes from ordering so definitely can be a stop for lunch if you have an hour! Pizookies are an absolute must if you're a first timer. Perfectly baked cookie with ice cream. The kind of cookie and how much ice cream depends on the size of the pizookie you get but they have a wide variety. Overall great experience and they also give you a free pizookie if it's your birthday so that's a definite reason to head over there on a birthday."
Alan L.,"Easley, SC",29,67,7,4.0,6/26/2017,"I like this place. The bartenders are cool, the menu is varied, and the drink selection (ESPECIALLY Beer) is excellent. Can't find much not to like. Easy walk from all the hotels on Vista Ridge Mall Drive in Lewisville."
Brady L.,"Denton, TX",36,15,1,2.0,9/22/2016,"On Thursday, September 22nd, two of my co-workers and I decided to eat at BJ's for lunch. When we entered the establishment, it was about half-filled with patrons, and we were promptly greeted and sat by a smiling and personable host. Unfortunately, this concluded our positive experience.  Upon being seated, we were informed our waitress would be Heather, and that she would be with us shortly. At least ten minutes had passed before being acknowledged again, even though our supposed waitress passed by our table countless times. A gentleman reluctantly approached our table, informed us that Heather was a little tied up, and that he would be taking our drink order. We ordered our drinks and he brought them out to us promptly, reassuring us Heather would be with us soon to take our food order. Another ten minutes passes and no signs of Heather, aside from her passing by to tend to her large 10-14 person table; it seems to have monopolized all of her attention. The original gentleman who took our drink order was bussing and cleaning the table behind us when he rhetorically asked if Heather had taken our food order. Frustrated, we laughed, told him no, and he once again tended to us, albeit reluctantly.  Within a reasonable amount of time, a food runner brought us our entrees. The food was delicious. Everything was fresh, hot, and tasty. In the midst of dining and near finishing, Heather finally made her grand entrance; she inexplicably brought us three small plates, all of which remained untouched. No introduction, no apology, no ""can I get you guys anything else,"" or ""how is everything?"" Three. Plates. POOF! Back into non-existence, as far as we were concerned.  We finish our meals (again, to reiterate, the food was delectable), and begin the waiting game for our checks. The gentleman who took all of our orders asked if we needed anything else, to which one of my friends requested another root beer. He responded by telling him he would let Heather know. He pretty much knew he wasn't going to see that refill.  Much to my amazement, here comes Heather, two root beers in hand! They would've been much more enjoyable had they been brought out while we were eating, but alas, it simply wasn't in the cards with Heather's vacuous (at best) attentiveness. When she dropped the drinks off, she gathered our empty plates, and made her exit. Still, not a single word.  At this point, she returned to our table with checks in hand (quickly too! ""TIP TIME!"" PSSSHHHH!). We opened our checks, and what do you know? She managed to mess that up! She split an appetizer evenly amongst the three of us, even though only one person ate it. She walked off to rectify the issue, but turned around after realizing she had no idea who had what entrée; hard to discern when you've had absolutely no involvement.  She returned with corrected checks, and had even removed the cost of our drinks in what I assume was a feeble attempt to make up for her dismal service. We paid, left a deserving $0 tip, and concluded our visit.  In conclusion, my experience at BJ's has always been fantastic on all fronts: food, service, and environment. Unfortunately, Heather's HORRENDOUS service has left a bad taste in my mouth, no pun intended. I doubt I, or the other two gentlemen I was in the company of, will be returning any time soon. Bravo to the chef, host, and other wait staff who picked up Heather's slack. Heather, maybe look into another career choice, because attitude and customer service are lacking. Try smiling, saying hello, and maybe performing minimum job duties of a waitress."
John M.,"Katy, TX",2,17,,3.0,6/11/2017,The typical BJ restaurant. Service a bit slow in the bar area. Nothing that would deter me from going back.
Tina J.,"Irving, TX",0,21,,3.0,6/10/2017,"My daughter and I ate here on a Saturday afternoon.  Nice atmosphere, plenty of seating, TV screens, and great music to listen to that is not blaring. The SanteFe salad with Cajun shrimp was pretty good as well as the ahi tuna salad.  If you download the app you get a free appetizer and we got the BBQ wings which were super tasty. Matthew was a great waiter and brought out our food quickly.  The pizooki's are great here but we  didn't order one this time.  We will be back!"
Marivi B.,"Lewisville, TX",0,4,,1.0,6/17/2017,"Not sure why I keep going to this location maybe because everyone around me seems to love this place... Last night had the Portobello swiss  burger with sweet potatoes fries,  well I am not one of those people that complain or have food taken back to the kitchen but the fries were ice cild so I had to tell them and the burger was so salty that I couldn't eat it. No once that waiter came by to refill my water and after that burger God knows I needed it!!! they were not even that busy since it was late like 9pm. left and no one person of the 5 at the front desk say bye ir anything. Overpriced and over rated!!!"
Meg C.,"McKinney, TX",111,172,334,4.0,9/4/2016,"I love the variety BJ's menu provides. There are many options for many tastes. Though a little on the pricy side in comparison to similar restaurants in the area (Fridays, Chili's, etc.) the consistency and quality are definitely there. If you like fruity cocktails you should try the refreshingly delicious Strawberry Splash and if you like beer you will have plenty of options here. As far as light eating options go, the Barbacoa Chicken is out of this world! A must try if you are looking for a healthy option.  Other than that sandwiches, pizza, pastas - all are delicious! You can't go wrong here! As far as service goes, we have never had a problem. In fact on a busy Wednesday night we couldn't make up our minds on what to eat and the waitress was more than willing to give us more time! We appreciated both her friendly attitude and attentiveness."
Valerie S.,"Irving, TX",38,2,,5.0,5/31/2017,"I'm giving a 5 because of the outstanding customer service. I'm on a temporary restrictive diet and my server at lunch was extremely polite and accommodating with all my requests. I ordered the superfood salad with some deletions and extra shrimp. It was delicious! I forgot to ask about all the spices on the shrimp (I was having a lunch meeting with my boss and got distracted) and called back this evening. The manager on duty, Cameron, answered all my questions, double checking everything with the kitchen. I've been to two other restaurants during my journey and the other places were extremely rude. Kudos to this team."
Lacy G.,"Dallas, TX",132,137,13,5.0,8/29/2016,"Very fast service and great quality food. Can get very busy during peak hours, so make a reservation or call ahead even 10 minutes or so. Could make a difference! They make their own beers in-house. Large selection of both food and drinks;  full bar in addition to microbrews. TVs keep you up on sports of the day, but always on mute. Easy to have a conversation."
Rosalba H.,"Coppell, TX",0,7,6,5.0,5/24/2017,Great food. Nice location. Food is nice. Recommend to everyone. Drinks are nice. They have options for food. Staff are nice. Food was delivered quick. Enjoyed the dinner with friends and family. Party place. Try this on win Lewisville and you will not be disappointed.
Claudia P.,"Mesquite, TX",95,3,,5.0,3/20/2017,"Omg I love Amy. She is so sweet and gives such an amazing service. Truely grateful that she was our waitress. The manager is super friendly and sweet. Professional service, great fresh food, just amazing. If you want to have an amazing time with amigos come to BJs"
Linda B.,"Prosper, TX",315,343,39,3.0,6/15/2016,"After a week in San Diego, I was travel weary and we decided to stop in here for a bite. It was really jumping for a Tuesday night and we had to wait in the bar for a table. The bar was packed, too. So, we snagged a couple of brews (they have Stone IPA on tap!) and waited. Soon the buzzer went off and we were seated. We were seated near the server station. Our server was right there, offering us drinks and an app; we commented that since we hadn't fully reviewed the menu, could he please come back in a few? Sure. Meanwhile, we perused the extensive menu and settled on an app. He took our app order and asked if we were ready to also order entrees. Since I don't much care for having apps and entrees delivered together, we asked if he could come back. He seemed a little annoyed. Once the app was delivered, we said we were ready to order. Giant got the Chinese chopped salad, and I ordered the Tavern Cut Pizza; I asked if I could add some items? Sure. I'd like to add Roasted Red Peppers. Red Pepper, he asked? Or Bell Peppers? Roasted Red Bell Peppers, I repeated, knowing they are on the menu. Also, green olives. OK, he said and off he went. Short time later, he delivered the Giant's salad, and my pizza with green bell peppers and kalamata olives.  The food was good; pizza had a nice thin crisp crust and the Giant appeared to enjoy his salad.  Now, I'm tired. I've been traveling and up since before dawn, so when server came by to ask how everything was, I didn't lie, but I didn't complain, either. Just ordered another beer. Through all of this, the server appeared a little annoyed. Not sure why; he seemed to be having a great time congregating at the server station with his buds. There are so many other outposts of this chain around DFW. I think I'll stop in at a different one next time."
Adam P.,"Afton, OK",0,7,2,1.0,7/31/2016,"Food is simply embarrassing, expected garbage and sure enough to garbage. Very slow service coupled with old stale food."
Tiera H.,"Lewisville, TX",2,34,19,4.0,10/18/2015,"So I read all of the reviews before I went here and decided to go for the consistently good rated food, but I was really worried about the service, which has some scary reviews. I went during Sunday Night Football. I was seated immediately. They happily changed the TVs closest to my table to the football game and also the NLCS baseball game that was on. The waiter came immediately to take drink orders and was prompt and attentive. The food came out quickly, hot and delicious. I ordered a variety of apps for the table: potato skins, southwest egg rolls, carnitas fries and stuffed mushrooms. The carnitas fries are amazing and by far the favorite!!! Everything else was also really delicious. The servings were large for the price. Finished off the night with a chocolate chunk pizookie-WOW!  So, I'm not sure what poor service others got but my visit here was stellar and I'll definitely go back. Good food and sports...can't ask for much more!"
