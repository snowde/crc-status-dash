Jessie B.,"Denton, TX",4,17,,4.0,4/19/2014,For a chain Restaurant they do an awesome job at making you feel at home. Great food and wonderful beer selections.
Rachel A.,"Dallas, TX",384,50,21,4.0,3/13/2013,"Pizza's are delicious, and how does anyone have an issue with the Pizookie!!? I love that you can order a tray of 3 and go to cookie nirvana.  Drinks are ok."
Christopher B.,"Irving, TX",101,350,4,3.0,8/30/2011,"I met up with some good friends here on Sunday evening. It was really about visiting and a convenient location, and not a conscious dining/drinking decision. I am off alcohol for a bit, so can't comment on the beer quality, but the friends who had some pronounced it good. A couple of beers, for them, iced tea for me and a flatbread ""pizza"" appetizer. What;s with cracker criusts under pizza toppings? Good old flat bread would be a great improvement. Waitress was a little ditzy (forgot to bring sweetner, slow to refill tea).  So, competent but not a destination."
Derrick H.,"Dallas, TX",24,113,25,4.0,8/8/2013,Really enjoy the atmosphere of this restaurant. Last visit the pasta come out all clumped together and they rectified immediately.
Sis C.,"Dallas, TX",5,26,6,2.0,10/6/2012,"Went there to enjoy the beautiful weather and a beer on the patio...but the patio doors were not open. The hostess agreed it was a great day for them to be open and said she would ask the manager about opening them; we never saw her again. When we asked our waiter about the possibility of them being opened he informed us they didn't open.  What?  It's clearly a patio with giant garage style doors along an entire wall but ""they don't open."" Really?  Tell me they are broken or something but don't tell me garage doors don't have the ability to open.  The beer was good, the food was average chain restaurant food."
Jack B.,"Argyle, TX",0,41,,4.0,11/6/2013,"Pretty good joint.  Their beers and food are really good.  They have a pretty wide variety to choose from also.  I've had chili burgers (chili made with their own beer), French dip sandwiches, jambalaya, pizza, Cuban sandwiches, fish & chips, and all kinds of stuff at this place.  And never once has my meal/beer disappointed me."
John M.,"Bedford, TX",4,26,1,2.0,11/28/2010,"I go to BJ's for the beer.  Their house beers are good and I usually get the Jeremiah Red Ale, which is an Irish style ale, brewed with extra malt.  They also have a nice selection of guest beers also, such as Stone Arrogant Bastard and a rotating tap from Sierra Nevada.  3 stars for the beer. The food is very much the chain restaurant variety: uncreative, overly processed and lacking in freshness.  I've eaten their sandwiches, pasta, calzones and pizza.  It doesn't taste bad, it just doesn't taste that good.  However, the value of the food quality and quantity for the price is very poor.  There are dozens (hundreds?) of superior restaurant options in D/FW if you want to get something to eat. 1 1/2 stars for the food. BJ's also has the NFL Sunday Ticket and shows numerous college football games, also.  I wouldn't be correct to classify BJ's as a sports bar, but the bar area is definitely is a very good place to watch sports and grab some tasty beers. I have also been to BJ's in Addison and Hurst and the comments apply to those locations as well."
Darlene L.,"Carrollton, TX",42,286,112,5.0,7/10/2013,"Great services. Great food. Our table of 10 all got different entrees' and everyone was happy with their food. Half price wine tonite made it even a better deal! Have always gotten great food and service. Pizzas are wonderful, too."
Teresa T.,"Dallas, TX",172,151,29,1.0,3/20/2013,I been to this location a few times and this last time was on Monday. Let me just say that service and food was horrible. I will never return to this location ever again. The saddest part was the place wasn't even packed. We had to ask the waitress three times for napkins and refills for water. She was no where to be found. Then the food took over 45 minutes to come out and my friend food was even later than that. Shame on you BJs and we never even got an explanation of why the food took so long. After eating there my stomach was hurting as well. Never again!
Robert S.,"Lewisville, TX",66,71,1,4.0,4/15/2013,"Good food and good drink!  Their prices are reasonable and great place to have get together for parties.  Gets busy on the weekends, so come early."
Francesca L.,"Pasadena, Los Angeles, CA",1400,1391,243,3.0,2/29/2008,"Nothing special. I had the speciality calzone which is filled with artichoke, spinach, cream cheese, and mozzerella, then topped with bruschetta topping. It had a good taste. Most of the reviews I read about the Addison locations all complained about the service. We had a group of 20 and they seemed like they were really trying, but a bunch of stuff got screwed up anyway. In the end I got the pizookie cuz I wasn't really stuffed from my ""meal"" (the calzone just comes as is, no sides) My friends were all raving about this deep dish cookie. I had the oatmeal raisin. It was good--hot, gooey, and chewy with quickly melting ice cream on top, what's not to like? But really, I could have made the same slice and bake cookie at home and I was expecting something really yummy and unique. The good thing though is the cookie profits go to charity for the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation."
Joshua L.,"Lewisville, TX",1,33,,3.0,12/5/2014,"The food here is usually pretty good. The service tends to suck though. But I cannot blame some, keyword ""some"", of the waiters. This place is always packed but only ever has a small handful of waiters for the amount of tables being sat. There have been several times I've had a waiter with more tables than any single waiter should have and running for dear life just to keep up. Hire more staff or stop sending them home mid shift. Had that happen one time and waited for over 20 minutes just for our drinks."
Steven S.,"Arlington, TX",138,225,32,3.0,1/8/2010,"Service - 3 Stars Food - 3 Stars Overall decor - 4 Stars House brews - 2 Stars I wanted a pizza. Did I know of any great 5 Star pizza places in Lewisville? Did I have my computer with me to check yelp reviews? When the answer is no to both those questions, sometimes you got to just settle for a chain restaurant you know. I've started eating at BJ's because my son took me there, saying they had some good pizza. Since my son knows good pizza like the Pope knows the Bible, this was recommendation enough. He was right on. I devoured that buttery tasting crust, perfectly cooked, without that burned edge some places like to put on. I mean, why pay for burned pizza edges, when I can do that at home for free? But anyway, the toppings were ample, and they came all the way to the pizza's edge, not just clustered around the center like some places put them. The pizza sauce allowed you to taste the tomatoes, but without drowning the other toppings. A little more cheese might have earned an extra star in my food rating. Who knows? The home brewed beers, though, they were another thing. I may be old and crotchety, but I just don't get this tiny brewery stuff. I mean, who's got that kind of beer palate? I mean, being able to distinguish all these little flavors they describe on the menus, like wino's do. Opps, I meant oenophiles. The Gospel Truth is, after the first two beers, I barely can taste any differences in beer. Except for the mule p*ss beers, of course. I mean, my taste buds don't die after a couple of beers, they just get less discriminating. Like some people.  I tried a flight of BJ's home brewed, and I just  had no desire to fly any of them again. Like my experiences with US Air, once was way too much. I did enjoy the decor. I'm no HGTV wannabe, but the overall effect of the layout, the lighting from the numerous TV's, the wide open area, and the black leather/faux leather booths were soothing to my masculine tastes.  There's nothing wrong with chain restaurants, as long as they do their food properly, and its hard to compete with corporate money when it comes to the size and quality of the restaurant's furnishings. Sometimes, its alright to settle for 3 Star today, while you're waiting to discover those 5 Star finds. That could be a dating tip, as well."
Rika K.,"Grapevine, TX",22,29,,3.0,8/10/2010,"Pizza and beer.  What else do I need to say?  Nothing.  That's what. All kidding aside, If you want to get together with some friends or coworkers for a drink and some ""bar"" food then this is a good choice.  If your friends are dragging you here and you want something really tasty then get the clam chowder; its a surprise hit on a minefield of a menu. Everything else is pretty much corporate, food by committee.  The pizza is alright nothing spectacular, and the meatloaf has a taste you won't be able to wash out of your mouth.  Everything else is hit and miss.  You'll just have to experiment. One must have is their root beer, but beware, no free refills."
Ed C.,"Holtsville, NY",29,1,2,1.0,8/28/2013,Went solo tonight and found a two seat table near the bar. Waitress showed up about 10 minutes after I sat down. Took my order of a beer and appetizer - which was good and in happy hour pricing. I looked over the menu which goes on for pages and settled on the Mahi-Mahi tacos. However I finished my appetizer and beer in 10 minutes and waitress was still MIA during that period.  Manager asked the table nearby how things were but skipped over my table.  Then the busboy came by and I asked for table to be cleared. I wasn't chasing down the waitress to place my order after waiting a while. It wasn't that busy to me.  She finally showed up and I then asked for the check. She did apologize but thatwas too late. Too bad as I was hungry tonight.   Won't be going back.
Chris J.,"Carrollton, TX",5,36,,4.0,5/7/2013,"Love their huge baked potatoes, and the piezookies (sp?) are fantastic! Definitely good for a change."
Amy C.,"Cedar Park, TX",0,51,,4.0,2/13/2011,"Normally I get the pizza (which is a good deep dish) but this time, I got a calzone. It was good as well but I did need to ask for more marinara sauce. My wife loves their wedge salad and we both love the pizakookie dessert. Our favorite is the all chocolate one. Overall, this is one of our favorite chain restaurants."
Tina N.,"Austin, TX",333,130,192,5.0,6/3/2010,"I am here with my dear friend and we are having dinner! We actually drove in from Denton because says the food here is amazing. Here we go! Okay so I got their hand crafted rootbeer, it's actually really good and kudos to them for not putting ice in it, makes it more authentic.  Atmosphere is actually really nice and friendly.  Starting off with the avocado egg rolls.  -good!!! Actually amazing!!!  -every single bite is heaven.  -crispy like it's suppose to be and the avocado is perfectly cook -I can actually taste every ingredient. Nothing is hidden.  -oh yes and the sauce is great Pizza is here!!!!!! I got the southwestern pizza. First bite was amazing!! A tiny bit disappointed because it wasn't piping hot. The pizza bread is deep dish and it is sooooooo good!!!!  --oops I was so wrapped up at eating that I forgot to type!!!!  I'm so full yet I can't stop eating. The pizza was really really good!!"
John A.,"Dallas, TX",87,25,4,5.0,11/18/2010,"I would live at this restaurant if I could. I first went to a BJ's when I was in Reno, NV, visiting my college roommate, and I was very impressed with their pizza, microbrews, and overall menu. When I found there were a couple in Dallas, I was overjoyed.  It's basically a step-in for Two Rows, which to my knowledge finally closed their last doors in 2008: a brew pub with fantastic food, lots of televisions, and a good family-friendly atmosphere. Don't worry, people without kids, it's not a frustrating experience if all you want to do is get hammered and watch sports. I'm sure they have annoying birthday rituals, but it's nothing that I've ever noticed.  The pizza is fantastic - deep dish Chicago-style with lots of toppings and incredibly well prepared. I love their Heffe-Weisen as well as their Pale Ale; all of their beers have their own unique names and great taste.  This particular BJ's is 21 miles from my door, and I have no problem gassing up the car and making a road trip. If you're ever in the area and are looking for great food and beer in a good environment, I'd highly recommend BJ's.  P.S. It gets crowded, but their host staff is good with managing expectations and not getting too weeded."
Jeremy D.,"Irving, TX",179,108,5,3.0,1/15/2010,"Here's to hoping my 3 star review takes BJ's overall rating down a notch.  BJ's finally suckered me into droping $30 on a pizza today, and I've got to say, my wallet and my stomach are suffering a bit of buyer's remorse.   It's not that BJ's doesn't do anything right, it just failed in the clutch.  The restaurant is nice and the service was good.  Our waiter even gave us two to go cups of home made root beer.  I just wish the pizza BJ boldly slapped his name on (BJ's favorite) was more than a small step above a Pizza Hut deep dish supreme.  Don't get me wrong, I like Pizza Hut, but seriously?  The Southwestern on the other hand was not even good enough to win honorable mention and don't get me started on the wilty uneventful ceasar salad. If you're looking for pizza, there are definitely better options in a 10 or so minute radius.  However, I still consider this visit a success because it gave me a good idea for my next Yelp list - Homemade Root Beer!"
