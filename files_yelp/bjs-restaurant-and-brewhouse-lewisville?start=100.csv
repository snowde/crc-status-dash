Angela B.,"Dallas, TX",2,18,1,2.0,4/13/2016,"Mid week, right now. The bar is litered with dirty dishes and after the bartender has made eye contact with me several times she has yet to acknowledge that she will at least be right with me. I wanted to order dinner and a few drinks. I have been to this location several times prior and have not had this happen and have had several friendly table waitreses prior. For the bar service I will be going elsewhere and suggest you do the same."
Tony M.,"Plano, TX",53,77,73,4.0,4/25/2015,I had the pizza here and was blown away.  Tasty and big enough to fill me up and leave some behind lol. I also had the bacon cheeseburger the following day with the crispy fries and that was great.
Jonathan V.,"Lewisville, TX",0,1,,2.0,2/9/2015,"It is hard for me to write this bad review because I used to love coming here but my last few experiences have left a very sour taste for it.  Tonight I walked in and was offered open seating in the coctail area and I graciously accepted because that where I normally prefer to sit.  The only problem was that upon entering the coctails area EVERY SINGLE TABLES WAS DIRTY!! Meanwhile all the servers where talking by the entry way.   Which brings me to my last experience when I was waiting for a coctail table and saw a empty table with dirty glasses and servers just walking by and not cleaning it.  When one asked if I was ok, I asked why he didn't clean it and he said they were above cleaning tables!!?? I run a restaurant and would immediately fire an employee for saying that!! Anyway, when I proceeded to sit at my dining area table the menus came out with multiple dirty pages.  After placing my girlfriends favorite app order(avocado eggrolls) they came out burnt, and I noticed they had put the burnt sides down to try and hide the fact.   I don't know what has happened to this place but the management needs to get a grip on things.  I will give it one more shot but three strikes your out...  let's hope my food comes out ok :/"
Vish K.,"Coppell, TX",5,54,,4.0,11/30/2015,nice place for a special evening with friends and family. love the avocado egg rolls.
B G.,"Jacksonville, FL",1,26,1,4.0,9/14/2016,4 stars is high but I thought 3 was low.  Second time here this week.  I had the Parmesan Crusted chicken earlier in the week an it was NOT good but had the California Chicken Club and it was great.  Washed it down with an Oktoberfest that is from their own brewery and it was surprisingly good.   I will be back the people I was with enjoyed their meals as well.
Michael S.,"Grapevine, TX",24,11,11,2.0,9/5/2013,"Here tonight for the first game of the NFL season. The place is packed! Found a seat pretty quick in the cocktail section. After 5 minutes our drink order was taken. A few minutes later drinks arrived. Drinks are great as usual. Service not so hot though , we ordered and she didn't take the menus, also I will add that we are at the smallest 2 person table. The guy dropping off the food also wasn't gonna take the menus , we had to ask. We also had to ask for silverware.  The happy hour flatbreads were very good. After the flatbreads were gone now the server and staff will not take our dirty plates and dirty glasses, we have no room on the table. We got up ourselves and handed our dirty plates to a passing food runner. Our waitress passed us many times without clearing our table.  Understanding that this is busy night we came in knowing that service might be slower than usual however, after noticeably seeing that multiple staff (ie. servers, bussers, food runners, and even management) have passed our table multiple times, it is crazy to me that a few simple things were not noticed after maybe 20 minutes. (Not to mention the many tables around us)  To summarize it all: If you come here, you can expect above par food however, expect for your dining experience to be double it's time and to feel pretty much forgotten. Not sure what's going on with this location, but they definitely need a heavy change over of staff.   I give this location two stars because I know that I can come to every BJs and expect to get the same quality of food, however if I could rate purely on service it would most definitely be a zero."
Johnny T.,"Flower Mound, TX",0,61,2,2.0,3/16/2016,"Service timing here is terrible. It seems like every time I come here for a casual meal, it gets dragged out to a 2 hour plus event. Not acceptable to be waiting 10 minutes for a refill or 15 minutes to get an order taken after seating. As for the food, it is typical american fare which is slightly overpriced. Pizookis are always a favorite here."
Tara C.,"Lewisville, TX",361,29,103,5.0,9/23/2015,Nice neighborhood happy hour spot! Ordered the flatbread pizza and a few vodka tonics. Great food and the drinks were spot on.
Kathy J.,"El Paso, TX",0,3,,5.0,9/12/2016,"Great pizza, awesome beer, and phenomenal service by Zachary. With Monday special and $10 coupon, it was a super dinner choice for our family. Thanks!"
Chris R.,"Denton, TX",240,58,,5.0,11/24/2015,"Had lunch at BJs today.  Ordered the New Orleans Jambalaya...... a mixture of shrimp, chicken,  spices, rice, sausage, bell peppers, onions, tomatoes...... wow...... it was GREAT.  I did add Tabasco cause I like it hot.  Excellent repast.  Most enjoyable.  Will for sure be back there to try it again."
Jose B.,"Atlanta, GA",0,11,,4.0,4/2/2016,"Sat at the bar. The service was good, the beer is great, so was the food. I saw a costumer complaining to the manager about the barman/waiter, I thought he did a great job."
Steve S.,"Los Angeles, CA",53,30,1,1.0,7/29/2014,"Dear Fred, This is only the second time I've ever ate at your restaurant, and both times The hostess and staff were rude.  It's unacceptable. The manager on duty was Tiffany, And the hostess was Kelsey.   Upon entering the foyer the hostess Kelsey was looking lost and disinterested.  She did not attempt to ask who was first, which made the three parties standing there uncomfortable.  It was a busy night around 10pm.   I told her we had a party of two, and she gestured over to the bar as said we could sit there if we wanted to.  It was packed and I said, is there any seating? Which she shrugged and said ""I don't know you have to look."" I looked, and when I came back she was already helping another party who had arrived AFTER we had. Eventually we were seated, and as soon as we were seated I asked our seated for the manager immeadiately.  After five minutes Tiffany came to our table.  I told her that I understand that  it was really busy, but her hostess was unnecessarily rude for no reason, and it made me feel uncomfortable.  Her eyes got wide and she said ""okay I will get preston to take care of you."" And ran away. After Preston took our drink orders, I asked him for a business card with the managers name and store number.  Tiffany came back with a rewards card and said that if we wanted to we could join the rewards program so we could fill put surveys. I don't know what kind of circus or Zoo you run at this store, but not once have we been apologized to For rudeness.     I will be copying and pasting this email on Yelp, and bjs corporate. Thanks in advance"
Chelsea R.,"Las Colinas, TX",768,1366,580,3.0,8/5/2014,Meh. It's always crazy packed in there...their food is mediocre. Just your typical all American pie bar kinda food. I think they are trying to make changes and update the menu with some more stuff that stands out. Good place to come watch a game and sit at the bar. It's loud. Service is hit or miss. I've never had amazing service at any BJ's location that I've been to (although the one in Allen is a little bit worse...more on that later) The flatbread Margherita pizza is pretty good.
Ryan M.,"Double Oak, TX",67,27,,1.0,1/19/2015,"Service was very unbalanced.  Very quick to get our order, bordering on pushy but not, just urgent. Once order was taken servers disappeared.  Salads came out in an acceptable amount of time.  My wife sent hers back since it was $3 for a tiny side salad.   My wife's pizza and my burger came out together followed 4 minutes later by part of the kids food followed 3 minutes later by all of it.  Really?  Serve the adults before the kids? Burger was ordered medium came out very well done.  No juice.  No pink.  Very crispy/charred outside. Back it went. Many moons ago we lived near here and it was a great place to go.  Food and service were excellent.  Clearly the days of glory are gone.  Perhaps if you are after just beer and pizza it is still worth coming here, bit I don't don't think we will be back with everyone again."
Zach P.,"New York, NY",0,237,2251,3.0,6/24/2014,"How I feel about BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse has always been a bit Iffy. There's only a handful (If even that many) of entrees that I like here, and I've tried more than enough to come to this conclusion. The appetizers on the other hand aren't too bad, and I can't said anything for the pizza, since I'm not much of pizza person. I feel like the waiters/waitresses get a bit overwhelm with the amount of people here sometimes. They're their to take your orders, bring your food, and the check of course, but you don't really seem them too much other than that three instances."
Deanna J.,"Carrollton, TX",18,22,7,1.0,8/15/2016,45 minutes for a seared tuna salad. People at our table ordered long after us and got their food 20 minutes before us.
Will M.,"San Antonio, TX",2,93,2,2.0,5/22/2014,Food was excellent as always.  I had personal lunch pizza and salad.   Waitress missed details of our order several times and failed to bring out a salad as part of the soup and salad special.  Took about 40 minutes to get our food and it was lunchtime and not very busy.  I usually love this place so hopefully it was one bad experience.
Lexi F.,"Lewisville, TX",127,5,1,5.0,1/6/2016,Love this restaurant! Amazing food and great service. I recommend the margarita fresca  flatbread pizza and the peach berry tea! For dessert I like sharing an Oreo pizzookie. It's like heaven in your mouth!
Budha U.,"New Orleans, LA",0,33,15,3.0,5/15/2015,"I'm sorry,  but the long island ice tea was watered down for $10.50 ugh.. the deep dish pizza was not all the way cooked or hot on top but was tasty. Pasta scampi was dry almost no sauce had to ask for extra sauce. Ribs was great tho never going back. Waiter Joshua  was great rib and waiter is the only reason im giving 3 stars.."
Anon E.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,10,,2.0,1/25/2017,"This place is typically pretty good, but tonight was another story. It was a pretty busy night, and we feel like the cooks tried to rush our food, which ended up completely ruined. I understand that wait times can be a bit longer when a restaurant is full, and we didn't mind the wait at all, but having the food cooked and presented the way that it was is unacceptable.The burger (ordered medium-rare) was completely charred, burnt, and black on the outside and was not tasty at all. The jambalaya, which is usually my go-to meal here, was unfortunately bland and tasteless and not nearly as flavorful as it usually is and the rice was overcooked. Service was woefully mediocre, and the waitress seemed totally unconcerned that we both were unsatisfied with the way our food was cooked. My cocktail was also noticeably missing a few ingredients that were listed on the menu. Overall, service was lazy and we were disappointed to have spent $80 on food that we found to be unsatisfactory. We will not be back."
