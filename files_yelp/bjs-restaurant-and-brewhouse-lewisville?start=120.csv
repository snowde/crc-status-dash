Michelle R.,"Lowell, IN",3,6,,5.0,8/4/2015,"This was a great restaurant, it was a great environment. There were many options on the menu, almost too many!"
Kendra L.,"Clermont, FL",0,38,5,2.0,6/29/2016,"Dallas location - I haven't received service this bad in a long time.  Of course lunch time is a really busy time but a properly trained staff would make all the difference.  The hostess kept looking in the empty drawer for silverware as if it was going to appear like magic; when she finally seated us, we received no silverware.  It took 15 minutes before someone who said ""she wasn't supposed to be our waitress but she would help us"" came.  It took 10 more minutes for drinks to come.  Thank God I ordered an appetizer because it took 20 more mibutes for our food, which was below mediocre.   Seriously,  my shrimp tacos had 2 little shrimp on each one so i just took two from one and added them to the other so I had one whole taco.  The ""waitress"" heard us talking and said they would comp the tacos.  I should have left when I realized how inept the hostess was but i had hopes - they were dashed.  :("
Pooja P.,"Irving, TX",0,5,,5.0,1/21/2016,"Me and my husband we both love this place.We come here regularly and love it every time.We specially like their deep dish pizza. It tastes awesome so soft, so puffy and full of veggies and soo big to fill us up.I had spaghetti with shrimp also. That was awesome too.We will keep coming to this place for their deliciousness."
Chris L.,"Dallas, TX",194,878,245,3.0,6/19/2012,"This place isn't too bad. The menu is like a bible. It has zounds and zounds of pages. But if you're here for lunch just skip to the back. They've got a decent lunch menu that's actually managable to read. I had the mahi mahi fish tacos. They were superb. Good crunch and texture and the fish was nice and flaky.  The fish is served either blackened or fried. I opted for lower calories and went with the blackened fish. Place gets pretty packed during lunch but there's enough space here so it's a good spot for a power lunch and for under 10 bucks. Service is inconsistent and very slow at times. They sat us near the bathroom. It smells. Avoid sitting near the bathroom. Which is located straight ahead from the facade (i think). Overall, not a favorite but if you've got a picky crowd of guests this is the place to go because they've got entrees from burgers to pizza to salad to chicken tortilla soup. Oh and they also offer half soup and salad. Recommends for lunch: Mahi Mahi Fish Tacos or Chicken Tortilla Soup."
Kathleen M.,"Dallas, TX",143,291,10,5.0,2/3/2013,"I've always been a fan of BJ's; my favorite menu item being their roast beef dip sandwich with french fries. Their fries are so good.  But I have recently had to cut the gluten out of my diet and finding restaurants with items that I can eat can be a challenge. so it is always a pleasure when a restaurant has special gluten free items to choose from other than the usual salad with no croutons, etc. I was so excited to have Pizza!!!! Yeah, Pizza on a gluten free crust. The crust was thin and had herbs infused in it. I had my three favorite toppings Mushrooms, onions and anchovies, along with cheese & sauce. It wasn't my favorite pizza from the Italian pizza place I've frequented in San Diego for 30 plus years, but it was darn good. They even have a gluten free pazzokie (cookie) but I am also not eating sugar otherwise this would have definitely tempted me.  Our waiter was particularly attentive and was quick to fill our ice teas and bring any extra things we needed. We just happened to walk in right as the lunch rush hit the door so they were very busy. Always has been a pleasure eating at BJ's."
K G.,"Addison, Dallas, TX",2,78,27,4.0,5/7/2016,It's took a while to be seated even though there were open tables. I think we came in between shifts and I know that makes it hard for the restaurant to serve us quickly. But the food is tremendous and it is not cheap but it is not expensive either. The beers are always good.  I always like to try something new and this time tried the Firemans red it was quite pleasant. Flatbread pizzas are delicious. If you can save room for dessert try the cookie. Cooked in a deep dish pizza pan and hot when it served makes it a real crowdpleaser.
Sean R.,"Dallas, TX",42,367,2495,3.0,7/29/2012,I think that BJs have one of the best chicken wings in the market. It couples with some great pizza dishes that will fill 2 people up. Their beer menu is also extensive. I have always liked to go here when in Dallas and usually for quick lunch and at times dinner. The atmosphere is casual and sporty. BJs has several TV screens and will make a good destination to watch sports games while you are dining. The service here is also very good and normally very fast. The wait staff will check on the patrons from time to time and are quick about that. It is in line with several restaurants in its class along the I35 service road. Its pricing is also acceptable.
Ottoo B.,"Lewisville, TX",0,1,,2.0,5/16/2016,"We have stopped here several times.  We found it an ok pizza and hamburger place.  Overall experience I would give it a 2 1/2 star rating. We found they can not accommodate special ours or dietary requirements , we were told there food choices are frozen and you get what you get"
Mary S.,"Amherst, OH",2863,716,10378,3.0,10/6/2010,"Ok I have to be honest,  I have been to BJ's 5x and the only thing I order is the Deep Dish Pizza,  I nibbled on my hubby's plate, each time (He can't order the same thing all the time) and that worries me because I hope He can only enjoy me everynight!   The Avocado egg rolls are ok, (cheesecake factory is better) but the sauce they use is wonderfull!    Anywho I gave them a 3 because everything else is pretty much average but the Pizza is 5 stars,  I love the ""Mediterranean Pizza""  This is how it works,  They have a special oven (so they say) and I always order the large, eat two pieces (feel Guilty) because I am counting calories on my iphone and then take the rest home and feed my family in the morning!  if you do this, Please don't use your microwave, dirty a baking pan and toss  it in the oven on 350 for about 15 minutes!    It's a win win situation, you over pay for Gourmet Pizza but then you feel better the next day when the family is fead and you did not have to pull out your wallet again Bar area seams to be fun and always filled with a mixed crowd!"
My O.,"Flower Mound, TX",0,11,,1.0,6/14/2016,"Poor service and mediocre food.  The carry-out service is a waste of time, because they will have you sitting in the parking lot for a long time after your order is supposed to be ready, and then they will get your order wrong anyway.  There are plenty of good restaurants in lewisville.  Try a different one."
David D.,"Hot Springs Village, AR",65,380,26,2.0,1/14/2012,"Disappointed from the word go.  Strike one = they serve pepsi, this in itself causes me to exclude the place from and rotation unless they have superior food.  So, we were seated and the after reading War & Peace aka the menu I decided on wings with the extremely hot sauce and fries.  My wife had a salad.  We waited and waited and waited and lo and behold we received the food.  My wings must have sat under the heat lamp because the wings were warm (not hot) and the ranch dressing was warm.  The server did replace the dressing but I didn't want to wait again for decent wings.  The sauce was more than mild which does nothing for me.  When you say hot, mean it dammit!  The wifes salad was iceberg lettuce and a few added things but it wasn't a $10 salad.   Here is the thing, if they cut the menu in half they would have more than enough of a selection and maybe they could speed things up.  No excuse for letting food sit.   Overpriced and food doesn't wow me."
Mizz V.,"Carrollton, TX",24,37,97,5.0,6/21/2015,This place always has amazing food and great service it's so busy here and you can't even tell food is not delayed come hot. Waitress recommend Irish Root beer super bomb!! Great evening out! And that's what matters
Treva W.,"Irving, TX",46,10,98,1.0,2/28/2015,"My last visit here was the absolute worst. The food was very bland. There was red sauce on my plate apparently from lack of cleaning or the hands that touched it. I ordered the corn bites from the small menu. Something said to ask for my bill and leave. It was apparent my waiter was not in the mood to work that day. I sat for about 5 mins before I was able to wave someone down for utensils.  It's never good when you hear the wait staff saying they were ready to go home especially since it's the start of the day. I'm sure I was in there no later than 2pm. Hmmm. I was not in the mood the go eat at another restaurant so I decided to go ahead and order a meal despite the not so pleasant experience I was having. That was a total disappointment. As the waiter brought my check, and clearing my items he spilled the entire glass of water all over me. Turned off from BJ'S."
Ted D.,"Lewisville, TX",0,1,,1.0,2/19/2016,"Food is decent, beer is good, but service is awful.  Keep eating there thinking it can't get worse, but just spent almost two hours eating lunch with my family and it wasn't busy at all.  Waited to be seated, waited almost an hour on food and it was overcooked. Enough is enough-will never go back!!"
Gena S.,"Sedalia, MO",1,19,1,5.0,8/19/2015,"I'm not sure why this is not rated higher?!!! Food and service was AMAZING! We got two appetizers... The avocado egg rolls are to die for and my hubby's skins were yummy. My lunch, the grilled mahi tacos, were THE BEST I've ever had. Clean, fun atmosphere. Chk it out!"
Charles F.,"Lewisville, TX",31,7,,4.0,8/10/2015,Always busy but this is a good thing! We got our food to go due to the wait but it was worth it! This place always has a line out the door... And for good reason Best jambalaya around!! I never knew they had it on the menu. The pizzas are amazing but try some of their other foods on this diverse menu. Excellent!
ViJay K.,"Addison, Dallas, TX",488,513,3836,1.0,10/2/2011,"Long time customer, but wow. What crap service. Usually I always have a great time at BJs. Good food, atmosphere and service to match. The last couple of visit to this Lewisville location (both within this week) have been down hill. The most recent tipped the scale.  The menus were filthy (and I mean, they needed to ran through a dishwasher) and the waitress seemed pleasant at first, but I was I wrong.  I know it may be out of her control when food comes from the kitchen, but everyone got served but one person at our table. Nothing ordered was out the ordinary. Just a turkey burger. The thing that really set off the night was when she tipped over a martini into a nearby glass of water. About half the glass was gone and the water looked like lemonade.  The waitress didn't offer a replacement until the persons' drink she spilled, asked for another martini.  The waitress said she only spilled a ""little bit"" and would only bring out that much (as she pinched her index finger and thumb together).  That was AFTER she already gave out checks and also forgot the desert we ordered but still billed us. BJ's!!! What is going on??  Tsk tsk."
Ginger R.,"Dallas, TX",0,154,,3.0,9/26/2015,"Just another trendy yeppey hot spot. Beautiful people and some interesting menu items. Clean, friendly staff and comfortable setting. Its simply a high end Applebees."
Katie M.,"Dallas, TX",7,46,2,2.0,4/23/2015,"Food is good, but service is hit or miss. Definitely DON'T recommend getting a $3.75 house salad with your entree - it's just lettuce with a few croutons. Kids meal came cold - Mac N Cheese looked like it was made yesterday, totally clumped together like leftovers. Can't believe we paid $5.75 for it and cold veggies. Waited several times for refills, then waitress refilled my lemonade with water. Pizzas were good, but I'd pick somewhere else to go next time."
Mark H.,"Dardenne Prairie, MO",8,377,3,4.0,4/21/2014,"Drew was our server and he was a pretty good guy.  The food here is really good although the drinks were a bit light in my opinion.  But hey, it's a Brew house so I guess I shouldn't complain because I wasn't drinking their own micro brews.  This place was slammed and has awesome TVs everywhere.   I'll certainly go back again.  The appetizers were awesome and the Pizza was the bomb!"
