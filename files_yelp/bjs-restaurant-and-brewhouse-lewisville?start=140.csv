Shelly M.,"Carrollton, Dallas, TX",1,18,5,4.0,7/26/2015,Service has definitely gotten better. Deep dish ravioli never fails. Save room for a pizookie!
Bill R.,"Jonesboro, AR",31,49,1,4.0,6/18/2015,"Good atmosphere impressive selection of beer. I had a delicious salad that went well with the IPA. Wait staff were incredibly attentive, professional, and courteous. Next time, the deep dish pizza, it looked and smelled delicious."
Colin C.,"Houston, TX",0,2,,5.0,6/6/2015,This is one of my favorite restaurants you can't go wrong with anything on the menu! Btw this location especially has some extremely attractive bartenders and waiters (;
Lisa N.,"Plano, TX",20,11,,4.0,6/6/2015,Seriously delicious food and great beer! Service at this location is good. I do feel like they are constantly apologizing for the slow service from the bar and kitchen. Wait time is a little longer than it should be. And the 20 page menu is a little overwhelming. But overall it's a great place!
Merrill S.,"Downtown, Houston, TX",3,21,7,4.0,4/21/2015,"We had our 1 yr olds birthday here. (I know what your thinking). Managers Fred and Nikki cleared out the back corner of the restaurant for us and made you feel you were not even at a bar. We had appetizers (sliders, Santa fe rolls, wings, chips and guacamole).  Feed about 20 people for a reasonable price. Everything was all good. Thanks guys!!"
Summer M.,"Denton, TX",0,38,15,4.0,5/7/2014,"Food is great, variety of choices is so great can be overwhelming.  I love the ahi poke :).  Service is sometimes lacking at this location. Provides nutrition info!"
Dr. S S.,"Plano, TX",0,1,,5.0,4/29/2016,I really recommend the buffalo chicken pizza. I also really like their wings. They have great service and are very fast.
Kate R.,"Dallas, TX",80,421,62,4.0,10/13/2013,"Been here a handful of times and it's a good standby. Had a burger for the first time the other day and it was pretty damn decent.  They have two different kinds of burgers right now and I'm not 100% sure what the difference is... Fan burgers and Brewhouse burgers I think? I really couldn't tell the difference except the new ones are on some kind of Parmesan bun and the regular burgers are on a regular bun.  Anyway. Good standard bacon cheeseburger with wedge fries and a BJ's beer.  Their new hand-tossed pizzas are pretty dang good too. Their original deep dish pizzas are delicious but have SO much bread, it's nice to change it up.  Great, now I'm hungry.  Service at this location is alright. Not great, not bad."
TJ S.,"Dallas, TX",0,11,,1.0,7/29/2015,Worst dining experience in years.  I did get my food until everyone else was done eating. Then as I just starting the server started clearing the table including my food he just dilivered.with the 4 bites of fish tacos I did get they we both but flavor and rubbery texture.  On and we had to wait a full hour to get our food. This is so not worth the money or the drive.
Riddhi T.,"Grapevine, TX",2,18,,4.0,4/5/2015,Went in on a sat evening and thank god we had reservations!! It was crazily packed :) :) We ordered few drinks and veggie starters. The avocado egg rolls were quite good. Nice ambience that you would love on a Saturday evening!! Would surely visit again.
Dustin B.,"Melbourne, Australia",991,382,259,4.0,1/2/2014,BJ's is a nice place to pop a few tops and enjoy there crafted beers and good food. Dont compare this place to a Chilis or Applebees because it is a step above. The service is good at this location not great but good. They also have good inhouse brewed sodas here and the place is very kid friendly.
Kay C.,"Dallas, TX",245,58,55,5.0,1/29/2015,BJ's is probably one of my favorite restaurant in Lewisville they have so many choices on the menu.   I decided to eat a lighter meal and ordered Roasted Salmon with quinoa.   The portion is not as big which is great but it was definitely filling and filled with flavor.  The salmon was cooked just right!  My friend had the thai lettuce wrap which I didn't get to taste since I was stuffed from my meal. We skipped dessert this time but I have to tell you they have one of the best dessert in town.   Great for happy hour also watching the games.
Dan L.,"Carrollton, TX",16,25,53,4.0,8/6/2011,"Lets start off by saying the wait sucked but the service was great. Chantalle my server was extremely kind and prompt she left a nice message on the bill.  So now its food time, i ordered the pot roast with veggies and mashed potatoes, it was very good except i thought it was a little too salty. My sister ordered fish and chips they were yummy. All servings were very generous in my opinion. I will  be back soon! I decided to come here after On The Border provided me with no service at all , i drove straight to BJ's i should of gone here first."
Chase B.,"San Diego, CA",49,16,1,2.0,2/22/2015,"The BJ's in UTC is small, somewhat noisy when full, and smells like mildew (whether people are there or not). Somewhat disheartening that the pizza was not fully cooked and that our waitress could not place the pizza pan on the stand without our assistance. Our waitress didn't slice pieces for us either, which was a cool part of the ""deep dish"" experience that we had previously in Chicago and at other BJ's. Finally, the pizza was still somewhat cold, doughy, and the cheese wasn't melted. Not sure if the oven doesn't get hot enough or if they took our pizza out prematurely, but I would not go back for seconds at this location in UTC."
Linda H.,"Lewisville, TX",3,3,,5.0,2/26/2016,BJ's has the best lunch menu!  And the service is quick and friendly. Evening meals are great and the atmosphere is fun and enjoyable. Love to come here!
Brett J.,"Double Oak, TX",0,42,2,4.0,2/15/2014,"Server: Sloooww to get drinks delivered and no sugar tray on the table, despite two tea drinkers in our party. Disappeared after delivering drinks despite all menus closed and all were ready to order. Waited another  5 minutes to place order. We had to ask for refills: just do it, Buddy! Environment: lovely weather outside 68) but freeeezing inside.  Kitchen: regular sized crowd for a Saturday afternoon. Food was a little slow to come out, but not too bad.  Food tasted great as always."
Sean S.,"Coppell, TX",0,2,,5.0,3/21/2016,"Great place to catch a game. Huge TV's and a menu to please anyone. Wonderful, attentive staff."
Christiana S.,"Dallas, TX",136,604,44,3.0,11/8/2013,"This is a pretty good restaurant.  If you want to go someplace where you can expect what you're expecting in a chain and have it delivered, this is where you should go.  It's definitely better than, say, TGI Fridays or something similar. The food has a decent variety, but not too much.  They do everything fairly well.  The drinks are kind of weak, though.  The service is slow/uneven, even when the restaurant isn't packed. *shrug* It's alright."
Rob S.,"McKinney, TX",0,4,,5.0,5/20/2015,"Good food, had Jayson as our server and it was the best service at a casual restaurant I have had in a long time. We had 4 adults, 4 kids, and 2 babies. Everybody loves the pizza and the service was excellent."
Travis B.,"Allen, TX",133,65,28,3.0,12/26/2013,"Have been here many times and each time seems to be a gamble. Food wise I am never upset with the food or drinks they are delicious.  Problem is the service or lack of, waiting forever for food or drinks or having your meal completely wrong and waiting even longer to get the order corrected.  Careless managers and blame of a computer system.  Things happen however service should be better."
