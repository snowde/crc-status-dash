Jason F.,"The Colony, TX",11,185,,4.0,1/28/2015,"I am definitely a huge fan, and I wish they had these in Boston where I am from. it's been a while since I have had a sit down meal here, but we have ordered take out a few times recently. both times we got the buffalo chicken deep dish which was amazing. the crust and breading was buttery perfection, and I was very happy with everything! we also got the cookie skillet dessert, yum!"
Joshua K.,"Dallas, TX",16,43,3,4.0,1/4/2015,Way classier than I would have thought. Excellent service and the lighter IPA was really good. Will check it out again.
Isidro I.,"Dallas, TX",11,9,36,2.0,7/8/2014,"I came here on a Tuesday night place was full, ordered the 6 inch pizza which I don't recommend. I was disappointed on the size and it took so dam long for it to get here. The pizza took an hour for it to get I the table.  Waiter was no where to be found did not even come and check on us or advise us of when our food was going to come out."
D L.,"Irving, TX",0,14,,4.0,2/27/2016,"Have been here several times and the food is always really good.  Salads, apps and entrees are all excellent.  We dont even get to the dessert having filled up on the apps and entree.  Service is generally good.  While occasionally slow, it's typically due to the volume.  It's almost always crowded.  They do a great job considering.  Clean restrooms, tables.  Parking sometimes tricky during peak periods.  Reasonably priced, just a good consistent choice."
Barry S.,"Denton, TX",3,33,12,1.0,12/14/2014,I usually love BJ's..their food and atmosphere is great. But this location has horrible service. Our waitress was a sour puss and when they tried to seat us in a mini booth (I'm a tall husky guy) so I asked for a bigger one. You would of thought I pissed in the girls Cheerios asking to move. From the start to end it was horrible service.
Danny B.,"Mission Viejo, CA",39,33,2,5.0,9/10/2013,"wow I love this place! Great place to dine Awesome selection of craft beers On tap. Fun atmosphere, Stellar service"
Jared J.,"Lewisville, TX",139,139,79,4.0,6/29/2013,This place is basically cheesecake factory except with beer instead of cheesecake. The seared ahi tuna makes for a great app and isn't fishy at all. I'll definitely be back and would recommend this spot to others.
Jennifer Y.,"Austin, TX",486,1024,9615,3.0,11/10/2010,I love their mini-platters!  They are like $3.00 and taste really yummy.  The fact of the matter is ... the service STINKS but they have this drink called the berryburst(alcoholic beverage) and it's so yum~  The service alone would have me putting one star up for this place but this drink makes up for it all and keeps me in my little bubble of happiness for now teeheehee~
Caleb W.,"Denton, TX",2,35,8,5.0,9/16/2014,"I love BJ's they have really good food and great beer. I typically get the calamari for an appetizer which is incredibly good. I also get the irish root beer, which is their homemade root beer with irish cream, so dang good. The fish and chips are surprisingly good as well, I recommend trying them. Be prepared to spend a lot of money here though."
Jennifer C.,"Saint Louis, MO",112,421,790,4.0,3/22/2013,"Overall experience, 2 thumbs up!! 1st visit here and to Dallas. We arrived right at 7p...same time Happy Hour ended, but we were able to get the Happy Hour prices. YES!!! Had the potato skins, the southwest egg rolls and the black & blue flatbread. Everything tasted great and the drinks were just right. The environment was nice and upbeat. Had a great time."
Mary W.,"Irving, TX",37,77,75,1.0,5/27/2012,"Disgusted & dissapointed , 3rd time ..  You'd think I'd learn...  Never will I agree to meet clients or friends here , I could care less if it's their idea... They suck, their management sucks & their food is slapped on boxed shit!!!"
Craig S.,"Corpus Christi, TX",0,7,7,3.0,12/12/2013,"I had the lunch combo pork slider and BBQ chicken breast, subbed tortilla soup for the fries.  Pork slider was very good, chicken breast was bland/boring and I couldn't even finish it.  The star of the meal was the tortilla soup.  I should have just gotten a bowl of that for my whole lunch.  A little heat to it and FULL of flavor."
Catherine A.,"Coppell, TX",159,46,5,4.0,3/4/2013,Almost every dish I get here is enjoyable. The service is good and it's always a good atmosphere ... except the floors. they are waaaay to slick. It's like your ice skating to your table. Honestly I'm not surprised the wait staff doesn't slip all the time. Just... fix that and you'll be 5 stars! Thanks for making mini pizooki's too!! :)
James R.,"Ardmore, OK",35,14,24,2.0,4/29/2014,"I wasn't very happy with our visit to BJ's.  The waiter, who was not new, made a lot of mistakes with our order, and to top things off the food was undercooked.  My 8 year old daughter ordered the sliders with a side salad, and he forgot to ask what dressing she wanted (we would have flagged him down but he seemed to be purposefully avoiding us).  It came out with Ranch, she wanted Honey Mustard, but she is easy to please so she went with the flow. My dish was to come out with a dinner salad, but it never did and by the time my food arrived (5 minutes after everyone else).  At this point I was frustrated enough that I didn't care to point it out.  My wife's burger was ordered medium well, but arrived rare.  I had the fish and chips and 2 out of 4 of the pieces we not completely cooked.  The bill arrived quickly (the only thing that had been quick all night) but it took over 15 minutes for him to return to pick it up. After this experience, it is extremely doubtful we will return to this restaurant any time soon."
Nafeisa R.,"Carrollton, TX",0,14,6,1.0,12/4/2015,"Went here last night (Thursday) and it was pretty busy. However it took 20 minutes before someone came and even took our drink order. We were about to get up and walk out but the waiter came. We ordered our food which came out not so hot. My fries were cold and the burger was a little over done. My friends food was ok though. Our drinks were not refilled, and our waiter did not return to our table until it was time to bring us our checks. I wanted to call a manager over but we were so beyond done with this place. She is 8 months pregnant and she was just ready to go. We usually visit the location in Addison, but we now live closer to this one in Lewisville. But we will not be back, which is sad because we love going to BJ's just not this one. The managers really need to pay more attention to their staff and the customer service."
Arjun D.,"Irving, TX",12,43,17,3.0,6/23/2012,"Went here for lunch, service was great. I ordered a chicken fried chicken and it was alrite. Not the best out there, but for the price I paid I was A-OK with it.  Nice lunch time spot, probably a good post work hang out place too."
Sunny C.,"Carrollton, TX",5,80,60,4.0,7/10/2014,Love the pizzas here! It may be a bit pricey but there's a reason for it. I really enjoyed the Mediterranean pizza and the asian chicken salad; Definitely a good choice! This place is packed on Friday & Saturday nights so I would go early or later in the evening.
Daniell M.,"Denton, TX",22,79,50,3.0,11/10/2014,Always decent foods and service! Hard to find something to eat though being a vegetarian... and the server was unsure of vegetation options! Will definitely give it another go!
Jeffrey C.,"Dallas, TX",2,36,,1.0,2/4/2012,Group lunch outing. Horrendous service. Extremely long wait for the food to arrive. The few times we saw our waitress she ignored requests for drink refills. As a group we decided we would avoid BJ's in the future.  Foodwise I can only comment on my dish of Tuscan Angelhair pasta that lacked any trace of the extra virgin olive oil listed on the menu.  It had a few small dices of roma tomato and odd little bits of feta that lacked any punch. About as bland as pasta could be.
Mark M.,"Waynesboro, PA",1,22,3,3.0,8/21/2014,"Good beers.  Now as far as food,  ordered calamari and a pizza. Calamari was good, nice flavor good texture. Sent the pizza back because it was cold.   Don't think the waiter was the issue, believe the kitchen is poorly managed.  The table next to us had issues also. Once we got the second pizza it was fine.  Think 3 stars is fair at this point."
