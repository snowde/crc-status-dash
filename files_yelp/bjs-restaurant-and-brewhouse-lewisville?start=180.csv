Guy V.,"Coppell, TX",5,91,37,5.0,3/24/2012,"Great food, good service when we were there.  Tons of tv's but there was a wait even on thursday night.  Not too bad though.  Easy access and good food."
Dirk N.,"Dallas, TX",0,637,144,4.0,5/8/2014,"Good ol' BJs. Came here to watch the Mavs during the playoffs. They initially sat us one place, but moved us once they realized we weren't by a TV with the Mavs. That cause some confusion because a server took our drink order and the hostess didn't tell him we moved. But aside from that, the food was good, the drinks were cold and it was a good visit. Only other negative is that our waiter seemed to be rushing us."
Mark G.,"Roanoke, TX",35,456,2,4.0,12/22/2009,"One of the better chains even if it is uber so cal.  I like how the menu recommends which beer goes best with what food.  This needs to catch on more at other restaurants. Real men drink liquor and beer not wine.  BJ's brews their own beer, which is kind of hit or miss.  Mostly hit though.  The pizookie is awesome.  In Cali we used to share them a lot when someone had a going away party or what not. You pretty much have to do it this way because the portions here are so freakin' huge.  Also, in Cali you could buy them at Costco in the frozen food section. BJ's is much better than Beefcake Factory.  But the first French fry I ate at this location was cold.  I was about to yell at the waiter and complain but the rest of them were hot.  Go figure.  BJ's still comes highly recommended for chain style American so cal food.  Extra bonus points for playing totally awesome 80's music."
Lisa J.,"Chappaqua, NY",6,12,,4.0,6/27/2014,"The atmosphere here is great, large dining area and plenty of seating although it's usually packed!! The food was great, a little on the heavy side... but that's kind of what makes it so delicious. I recommend the mac and cheese, ahi tuna salad, crab ragoons, and clam chowder."
Dominic C.,"Flower Mound, TX",283,850,169,1.0,4/24/2012,This is not deep dish pizza.  This is a thick crust pizza baked in a deep pan.  Not the same thing.
Reba G.,"Dallas, TX",567,688,556,1.0,10/1/2011,"This location has the worst possible service I have seen in my life.  Do not go here if you do not expect to get out of there in under 2 hours so.  The server blamed it on the 3 waiters working for the night, but that is NO excuse to be less attentive or spill someone's drink and not offer to replace it.  Instead, she offered to bring out a ""little bit"" to comp for what she spilled, not a good service in my book.  If the food is brought out for everyone, do not forget someone's order.  I won't be going back here for a while."
A S.,"Plano, TX",26,140,133,4.0,6/12/2015,"Food was really good. Waitress was attentive. My Long Island iced tea was neither. Very watered down . We told our waitress how bad it was and she did say that it was poorly made and brought me another. It's was better, but nada booze in it at all. Stick with the beer there. I would never get a mixed drink there again. The bartender there needs to go back to bartending school. The fish tacos were great! Fun time with the fam though."
Karen P.,"Denton, TX",19,86,216,4.0,2/23/2012,"I really like the food, I just wish it wasn't so expensive. I'll be back, and I definitely need to try the pizza next time!"
Richard B.,"Port Arthur, TX",2,53,5,3.0,10/20/2013,Good food with lots of choices.   I've got two vegetarians that were happy with their burger and avocado rolls.   My black and bleu burger was a little too strong with the blue cheese.   Kind of pricey both food and drinks but a popular place.   Crowded but seated promptly.
Haylee Z.,"Irving, TX",13,55,1,4.0,7/4/2011,"Good experience with good friends. Our waiter was a little weird, but it's a holiday weekend, he was probably bored and lonely. Got our drinks pretty fast and food came out pretty fast as well. Our friends ordered a salad that the waiter forgot to put in to the kitchen, but it came out promptly after we reminded him about it. Pizza was good, not enough sauce for me, but seemed to be a typical deep dish pizza. I highly recommend the mini bruschetta... YUM! I wish there were more than 4 of them on the plate.  Don't recommend going on a Friday night unless you are willing to wait a good hour or so to be seated. We went on a Sunday night with 6 of us and were seated right away."
Rachel W.,"Dallas, TX",267,258,,4.0,1/29/2014,"I am a huge fan of BJ's because their lunch specials are fantastic. Last night, I tired the dinner and it was still reasonable. I went there with a group of friends about 6 people in total, and enjoyed the nightly special of 1/2 price wines (glasses and bottles). The waitress was very helpful, and the food was delicious. When my friend asked for some additional bread for her pasta the waitress went out of her way to get my friend more bread. The splitting of the wine was fine amongst the bill. The only reason why I give this 4 stars is because we had to hunt down our waitress to get our bill. Once our food was taken away, and we continue to chat to finish our bottle the waitress just disappered and served other tables. Besides the waitress leaving us alone for a while, it was a good experience."
Lisa M.,"Flower Mound, TX",68,15,2,5.0,4/30/2014,I really love coming here and getting the gluten free pizza. It is the best around. The atmosphere is a lot of fun. If you are going for lunch I would recommend making reservations ahead of time or getting there early or after 1.
Katrina L.,"Dickinson, TX",0,47,35,4.0,8/8/2013,"I am a pretty big BJ's Restaurant fan.  I like that they stay open late, have big TVs at the bar, and have a good bar area.  My boyfriend and I came here on a Sunday night to watch the first football game of preseaon.  We also came for the happy hour which is pretty darn good.  We started with the spinach and artichoke dip which was really good.  They don't use mayonaisse so its loaded with cheese and cream.  Delicious!  We stuck with items on the happy hour menu for the night.  We ordered the California Club Flatbread (amazing!), Mini Deep Dish Pizza (with jalapenos and pepperoni), and Mini-Bruschetta (so fresh and delicious).  Everything was the perfect size for hanging out at the bar and enjoying some beers while watching the game.  We ended up at the bar all the way until closing.  Our bartender was really good at staying on top of our drinks (maybe too good because I definitely went overboard).  Somehow I ended up switching from beer to a fruity drink and that pushed me over the edge.  But everything was delicious!"
Chloe K.,"Lake Dallas, TX",3,9,,2.0,4/15/2014,"This place has awesome food, but the service at this particular location is not great. My husband and I went there for date night and waitress was extreamly ditzy. We sat down and I ordered "" A dirty martini, extra dry"" and my husband ordered BudLight. After my husband orded his drink she turned to me and said ""ok Martini, did you want that, like, dirty or anything?"" Seriously? Yes, I just said that. Not to mention she only responded to my husband when ordering and served him first. Im guessing she was assuming he was paying, but neglegting the other guest just makes for a bad tip, especially since I was the one paying the bill! While we were eating, a woman feel because the floor was slippery... the waiters just stared at her. NO one helped her up or even acted apologetic. Talk about bad customer service."
Tom G.,"Austin, TX",1,4,,2.0,6/5/2014,This was not good for me. Service was really slow. Only a table of 4 and it took a while to even have someone speak to us. Ordered drinks and it took a longer to get drinks than it did our food. Ordered the Bone In Rib Eye medium and it was like leather. No one ever asked how the food was. Frozen Margarita was $10 and not even frozen. All and all not a great experience. Visited this same chain in Austin. And got the same experience. Won't be back.
Amanda C.,"Denton, TX",7,22,,5.0,2/16/2014,"Absolutely amazing!!! I had a chicken alfredo pasta thing I cant remember the name but it was soooooooooo goood!!!! Our server was amaxing, it took little to no time at all to get a seat even though they were packed! Definitely going back"
Al G.,"Littleton, CO",4,150,12,3.0,1/2/2014,This was the best chicken fried steak I have ever had in my life... That is how good it was.  The only problem was they didn't get it to me until everyone at my table finished eating.  They screwed up the order and there was no sense of urgency on the part of the restaurant to fix the problem...  too bad because that is what keeps them from getting a higher rating.  From the waitress to the Manager they just didn't care I was waiting and I asked multiple times if they were going to bring out my food...
B R.,"Lewisville, TX",1,74,1,3.0,3/4/2015,Ok ordered their deep dish pizza twice recently since they don't have hand tossed anymore.  Half my pizza was missing cheese and no red sauce. The cheese wasn't melted all the way & toppings were still cold. That's how people get sick if it's not cooked all the way.  This happened both times on a Tuesday night cuz that's when they have half off wine. Bring back the hand tossed so my friends will come back with me.  Your thin crust is like paper with cheese on it over priced at $15 & only enough for 1 person. Your staff never asks anybody for their Rewards Card so it's almost pointless having it.
Isaiah M.,"The Colony, TX",0,6,,2.0,5/18/2015,"I went here with my family and receiver the worst service ever. Our waitress was extremely rude, it took 45 minutes for our order to even get taken and another hour and 15 minutes for our food to even be brought out! When our food was brought out, it was all cold and had to get sent back to the kitchen and remade. The manager was extremely gracious and apologetic. I will never come back to this location ever again. Don't waste your time or money here!!!!!"
Dorothy K.,"Campbell, CA",14,54,22,4.0,12/6/2013,"Enjoyed the food and the wait staff was friendly, didn't rush us, so it was a relaxed evening. Loved the avocado rolls are a favorite.  Always an extensive list of spirits."
