Ben L.,"Irving, TX",189,18,14,4.0,10/7/2011,Everything I've tried here has been above average. Jeremiah Red along with the beers they brew in house are all amazingly delicious. Came her for a late date with the girl. Really enjoyed the mediterranean pizza and the velvet pazookie dessert. Servers were attentive which was a plus. Safe place to go if you suck at making decisions.
Ranel C.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",14,42,,5.0,10/7/2010,"I'm in Texas visiting family and was looking for an interesting place to eat.  My hopes were not high since we were on a highway and generally you can't find these places off the highway. I saw BJ's Brewhouse and thought that I could atleast grab a beer.  Instead I got one of the best dining experiences I've had for a long time. It all starts with the service. From the time I walked in the hostess and staff were incredibly friendly.  Our server, I think his name was Derek, was also friendly, informative and fast.  I even helped me pair my beer with the dish we ordered. My wife and I both ordered the pot roast.  It comes with mashed potatoes and crispy veggies.  The dish was perfect!  The pot roast was as soft as butter, the mashed potatoes full of flavor, and the veggies added crispy texture. The beer is excellent!!! They have dozens of options brewed at the restaurant as well as abroad.  I ordered a Jeremiah Red, an Irish beer that balances malty hops and light fruit flavors.   We were too stuffed for dessert, but all in all, 2 pot roasts, an Iced Tea and the beer cost us $35...what a value!  If you're ever in Dallas on the way to Denton I suggest you check out BJ's Brehouse."
Alyson C.,"Lewisville, TX",0,3,1,2.0,9/6/2014,"I've always seen this place packed.  People waiting outside to be seated. So I thought, hmmm... this place must be great! WRONG! Service was mediocre!  The worst part was the food. I ordered the chicken fried steak with a side of mashed potatoes and veggies. Unless you like eating food with no flavor come here. It was so bland! I should have went to Twin Peaks next door. Food is way better. I gave two stars for the Dos Equis I had! Lol."
Debbie S.,"Denton, TX",339,49,12,4.0,1/6/2013,"BJ's has got to be one of the best restaurants for great beer and casual dining.  The food is always good, period.  And great beers.  Today I tried a low cal dish (Chicken and rice pilaf) and it was really good.   Staff are friend, service can a  little slow because they are always busy!"
Dean C.,"Lewisville, TX",2,11,1,3.0,2/23/2013,"I've been twice, the first time was a total disaster. Our waiter was terrible and hardly came around. I ordered a burger and it was literally raw in the middle, and had to wave down another member of the staff because I tried for  5 minutes  to wave down my waiter. While they did totally remake my order they sent the new one out wrong, not that it matter my girlfriend had already finished her meal.  Finally after getting it fixed, the manager came over and took my meal off our check. The second time was totally the opposite. Our waiter was great, the food was great and cooked, and we had a great experience."
Bill P.,"Dallas, TX",1,65,,4.0,10/30/2013,"Nice brew house in the burb's , great selection of beers (their own too) and lots of sports on the wall. menu is executed very well for a chain. service is usually top notch but during rush hour you're going to wait- like everywhere else."
Chelsea H.,"Barrington, IL",0,87,36,2.0,3/30/2014,"Went for lunch with some friends. They have an outstanding beer selection. I was quite impressed. It is a brewhouse, obviously. Though I had to take my time reading the menu because everything looked great. Sampled some chopped salad which was fresh, the mac and cheese was work checking out. The bread served toasted up with that is a nice touch of crunch with it. I had the bacon flatbread pizza and salad combo. It was ok. I would say the beer was my favorite part of that meal."
Jason J.,"Carrollton, TX",2,42,32,4.0,12/11/2012,"BJs is always good.  The food is spectacular.  What confounds me is that no matter who our server is, when we get 3/4 of the way through the meal, they disappear.  lol  I don't know if it is smoking breaks or they've moved on to another table, but this is 5 or 6 times this has happened."
Chris C.,"Carrollton, TX",6,3,1,4.0,12/2/2012,"Super great place. Love the deep dish classic tomato and 5 cheese. Waiter was great, beer and menu selections were good. Only downside was the long wait to get a table. Will be coming back!"
Chris C.,"Dallas, TX",22,26,,2.0,6/26/2011,"Ok, I live in Oak Cliff so lets take this review with a grain of salt.  For a chain it was not bad.  The one thing that always makes me thank where I live is the fact that not everyone in a place looks like me, even at Bolsa.   The service, food was good, the atmosphere was ok, reminded me of an Fridays on on a high...  One suggestion, no menu need to be 15 pages long, really."
SHELBY L.,"Dallas, TX",53,104,,4.0,4/25/2009,"I love BJ's spinach and artichoke pizza. Oh man I could eat that errrday! Also when I wasnt with child I enjoyed their housebrews quite often. The red and blond are yummy. I have always had great service and when I went out with a few coworkers at happy hour a year ago the bar experience was great too. Happy hour is the time to go. They have drink, appetizer, and pizza specials.  I have never had a dish I didnt enjoy and I have branched out to try their pasta, salads, and even their chicken fried steak. As other yelpers noted there is someting here for everyone. Its nothing incredibly gourmet or fancy but it is good.((also they do deliver))"
Mandy V.,"Baton Rouge, LA",78,281,275,4.0,9/8/2011,Tomato Basil soup w/ Ham and cheese is awesome and only 5.95 as a lunch special!
Lynzy B.,"Oak Park, IL",4,8,1,4.0,4/2/2011,Happy hour for food makes this a worthwhile stop on a Friday afternoon. Lively atmosphere & crowd. Their claim of a Chicago style pizza is accurate & tasty. Friendly & quick service.
Vini P.,"Lewisville, TX",0,4,,5.0,3/16/2014,"So we have been to BJ's a couple of times, always love their food.  So we decided to take the kids for a Sunday lunch.  My husband ordered one of the burgers which took some time.  Guess they decided to serve the rest of the food as we had two kids with us.  The manager came up and apologized, our server came up and apologized.  It has never happened before, and honestly I guess it does happen sometime.  They were so awesome about it and copped his burger and to top it off gave us a free dessert.  His burger was only a couple minutes late, but it was really nice to see how proactive they were.  The food was yummy as always.  Love this place and is really kid friendly.  Thank you for an great meal."
sally c.,"Plano, TX",0,4,,5.0,2/18/2013,"My son and I have date night once a week and we decided on BJs, I had the blonde fried shrimp, baked pot and Cole slaw and my son had chicken parmesan. The food took up the entire plate on both of ours! I was in heaven the shrimp was delicious and Justins was just as good. I recommend this resturant! The atmospher was great as well and the service spectacular!"
Traci B.,"Weatherford, TX",158,211,130,5.0,8/15/2008,"I really like this place. A little different than the usual... they have a good assortment of yummy dishes. Their pizzas are really good (We love the Great White) and we always like their drinks. Try their sampler of BJ's brewed beer and don't forget their root beer while you are at it! I am a huge fan of the clam chowder, avocado rolls, and the pizookie is a must-try. ( A giant fresh baked, still warm, cookie with vanilla ice cream melting on top! YUM!!!) It is huge so share with you're buddies. This is a big place and you can usually get in fairly quickly. I love their seating and the TV's keep you entertained even when the conversation doesn't."
Stephanie S.,"Denton, TX",0,20,,3.0,2/22/2013,"Ok...BJs is one of those balancing acts.  By far it is the BEST place for me and hubby to go with even our kiddo to have cocktails and apps.  Hubby loves the selection of beers, I love the martinis, and the kiddo loves the pizzcookie (or whatever it is) and root beer.  So we're all happy if we JUST stick to that...going in full-on for restaurant fare and exceptional service...prepare for disappointment.  The first time we went we did the cocktail app thing and were happy so the 2nd time we thought we'd take hubby's mom to eat and it was ok...service was slow, food took WAY to long especially with a 5 year old and half the time was spent reading the menu which I thought came from one of my graduate classes it was so freakin' long.  But, when the food finally did come out it was alright and everyone was happy.  So then we thought we would try it a 3rd time, this time with my mom.  Again, a menu that rivals any 600 page graduate course book, crappy service (she seemed like she just was too put out to do anything for us), slow bringing out the food, and the hostess at the front door...let's just say she's truly a blonde (no offense blondies).  I ordered the California Chicken sandwich...yuck.  First, my chicken still had the bones in it and it was grilled to a burnt crisp barely able to eat and the sourdough bread it was on (I'm not sure that's a great flavor profile anyway,especially when you pare it with avocado and peppers) was tough and greasy.  The chipotle mayo was missing its chipotle.  It just wasn't a very good sandwich.  Hubby had some jambalaya and he said it was ok with more cayenne pepper than jambalaya.  17 year old had Tuscon chicken limone, which he ate and said was ok...not sure what he thinks about anyways, so moving on.  My mom had a chicken stuffed baked potato and Cesar salad of which she said both were fine.  Kiddo had the pizzacookie thingy again as he ate before we left.  One annoyance is that there is no clear path in and out of the restaurant so you have to compete with those coming in while you are going out and as there is NO waiting area, you have to push your way out through a throng of people...not fun with a kiddo.  I'll just stick to the apps and cocktails as two restaurant experiences have left me less than thrilled."
Amyn G.,"Cambridge, MA",12,30,,1.0,6/17/2011,Good food pathetic service. I go here for the pizza and its great. But the service is pathetic and inattentive at best. I can get good pizza elsewhere!
Regena L.,"Carrollton, TX",81,4,1,4.0,10/20/2011,Love BJs! Wonderful service and great food! Ask for Jeremy the bartender or Lauren the server; they are the best! (Lewisville location)
