Chelsie L.,"Denton, TX",139,40,102,5.0,2/24/2011,"i can only comment on the pizza here! i mean why else would you wanna come? ok maybe for all the beers but foodwise, pizza is where it's at here. not too much sauce, not too much cheese and they have THE best ranch to dip your crust in.  also you MUST have a pizzookie! pizza/cookie enough said."
Miles M.,"Denton, TX",282,284,10,4.0,1/24/2011,"Let me tell you why i'm a fan and i'll try to keep it short.  I ordered a beer i didn't care for, but didn't mind drinking.  The bartender talked with me about the beers i like and suggested a different one in which she took the beer i was drinking and gave me the new one without charging me.  That's good service!!!   The food is always great here as well as the mixed drinks and overall service.  The only complant i have is the wait to get a table on a friday night....hour and a half!!! ugh thats just horrible, but what do you expect."
Prince H.,"Dallas, TX",158,624,561,4.0,10/7/2010,"This place is like the love child after a drunken night of luvin  and a three way between Cheesecake Factory, Grand Lux Cafe and a beer garden.  huge portions of surprisingly good  food and a nice selection of good beer."
Edward S.,"Flower Mound, TX",6,3,,3.0,4/14/2008,"Largely Forgettable... So after I discovered that Costco closes the gas pumps after 7PM on Sunday we decided to give B.J.'s a try.  They have a cute story on the menu about the guys who started the chain, but it is obvious that the personal touch has escaped them since. This is one of the remaining places that brew their own beer, and the Pale Ale was tasty, as was the Blonde my wife had, but $4.50 for a pint of beer? The service was pretty good, but at 7:30 on a Sunday evening when the place was sparsely busy, they managed to quadruple seat our waitress.  We had to wait on several occasions and flag down other servers/managers because she was tied up taking orders etc. The food was average at best also, with the only bright spot being the chicken fingers we ordered for my son - tasty breading and served nice and hot.  My wife and I split a burger with cheddar and bacon - the bacon looked like it came out of a pre-cooked package and they used sliced cheese which was not fully melted.  The wedge cut and seasoned fries were pretty tasty, but I had to call the manager over to replace the ones they served us ice cold with the burger - he very quickly delivered a hot side dish. I also love the places that say that they proudly serve ""Kraft Mac & Cheese"" and then charge you an arm and leg for a serving that you could have made at home for far less $$$. So overall I rate a place based on whether or not I would return and this is one that I will probably not give a second chance.  Too many other choices!  The only reason I might go back is that we did not try their signature item...the thick crust pizza - perhaps they get that one right more often."
Neal J.,"Coppell, TX",1,8,,4.0,9/20/2011,Fun to go with a big group of friends. average prices and average food. but they're pizookies are awesome!
a m.,"Cleveland, OH",0,80,108,2.0,3/20/2011,"Overall, not impressed.     Typically, it is difficult to find something ""healthy"" at a restaurant in this area of the country.  Too much fried and breaded food that explains why many of the patrons looked the way they did.  Since I had been eating like a Texan all week, I looked for vegetables on the menu and was left only with salad options, many topped with fried something.  So much for healthy.   I ended up with a Field of Green salad which was unremarkable.  The feta cheese tasted like the type that you buy in a grocery store and not a ""good"" feta and the Raspberry Walnut Viniagrette was definitely bottled.  My guess was also that the roasted peppers came from a can, as well.  My friend's Caesar salad was equally boring.   The highlight of the evening was two Grey Goose Cosmos; the first of which was very strong, but delicious.  I ordered the first when we were waiting at the bar for our table and the other wish dinner.  There was no consistency between the two, but they were good.   The restaurant is very noisy, which was expected, and it was obviously a place that many local regulars visit.  The next day, I mentioned the food to some friends and they had similar stories.   If you go to BJs, know what to expect.  Even though the prices were reasonable, it is not a restaurant I would return to."
Craig P.,"Flower Mound, TX",0,2,,1.0,9/14/2014,"We spent an hour and a half here trying to get dinner. The restaurant was quite empty so there was not excuse for the service we received. When our food did come it was room temperature.  When we asked to speak to the manager he was useless. He offered us dessert and we told him we didn't have time he just said he'd adjust the bill. ADJUST it?! Please! It should have been compted.  We still left having to spend $30 for 2 very average tasting, room temperature meals. Been coming here for years and we have come to expect slow sercive but the food usually makes up for it.  Slow service would have been welcomed to what we received. We even told the waiter the food took too long and he just walked off with no response to us. Later, much later, when he did return we told him the food wasn't hot to which he had no response once again. FYI, saying you're sorry goes a long way. So sad, normally love this place but with this last experience I don't think we'll be back"
James O.,"Flower Mound, TX",0,3,,2.0,9/24/2012,I was very disappointed by the pizza. It was melted cheese on on what tasted like French bread. The service and atmosphere were good though
Joe F.,"Dallas, TX",228,292,39,1.0,11/25/2008,"i would consider giving BJs 3 stars if it wasn't for the absolutely abysmal service i got here. brace yourself, for the tale i am about to weave is of tragedy, discrimination and an order gone horribly wrong. i had spent the day moving apartments w/ my then girlfriend. we were all over the map: denton, dallas, lewisville, plano, frisco. . .and it was august. my previous job had me meeting a lot of clients at the bjs because it was a nice midpoint between me (denton) and them (dallas) so i figured we'd pop back in for a late lunch/early dinner before finishing up the move. when we got to the restaurant we were one of maybe 6 tables in the entire restaurant. we immediately got put right by the kitchen entry/exit area. . .after being incredibly demanding and saying ""can we please sit over there?"" we were set up in a booth a whole 10 feet from the entry (great hostess). our waiter came and i ordered my typical blackened chicken sandwich and my girlfriend got the meat loaf sandwich. the waiter said that the chicken was better with cheddar cheese and bacon and i told him thanks but no thanks.  you can imagine my surprise when i got a chicken sandwich with cheddar cheese and bacon. i told him i didn't want those on my sandwich to which he replied ""well, it's really too late now, i can't send it back."" excuse me? i waited tables through high school and some college and i don't think i ever read that in any training manual. i figured i would push him a little bit. i told him i was jewish (i'm not) and i can't eat pork (i can). he gave me a flustered look and told me to just pick it off and WALKED OFF. the rest of the meal was as uneventful as the food. . .slow and heavy. the waiter came back to drop off our check and without asking if my girlfriend was done with her sandwich (she definitely wasn't) he bussed the table and told her he would box it up. the manager was making rounds asking people if their meal was ok, but neglected to stop by ours and didn't seem to care when i walked over to him to let him know about our issues.  HOWEVER, i will give incredible respect to bj's corporate. a quick e-mail got me in touch with the regional manager who let me know the manager was being re-trained and the waiter would no longer be an issue. she then sent me a gift card for $75. i used it at the bj's in lewisville where we had great service and left the entire $75 on a $30 meal.  needless, to say it's because i won't be going back."
Kat F.,"Carrollton, TX",5,4,10,4.0,8/15/2010,"Had our anniversary dinner here. Food was great and service was spot-on. Although it was pretty busy there, we still got food quickly and drinks refilled in a timely fashion."
Barbara G.,"Auckland, New Zealand",6,13,6,5.0,1/30/2009,"This has been one of my favorite places to eat since moving to the area.  I have dined there at least 20 times, taken family there as well and we all enjoyed everything we've ordered.  My favorites are their appetizer wings and nachos, the fish and chips, BBQ Beef sandwich, Lasagna, meat loaf dinner, roasted chicken... but my absolute favorite is the blackened NY Strip - better than most steak houses.  And if you have room left, (we rarely do) their pazookies for dessert are amazing.  Cookie in a personal size pizza pan baked to order and served with ice cream (from the famous Henry's in Plano!)"
Jaime A.,"Dallas, TX",12,37,,4.0,10/14/2008,"So friend of mine recently purchased a home in Carrolton off 121 and Hebron. Nice house nice area, but that's not part of this review. I met him and his girlfriend for dinner and few drinks. He suggested BJ's in Lewisville off 35, which I politely agreed to. I arrived first and not wanting to wait in the entry way amongst a sea of acne faced teens I proceeded to the bar. My timing was perfect as I was able to secure a table just as a few patrons were exiting. The bussing staff was quick to clear the table and wipe it down and as soon is he was done my waitress arrived to take my drink order. Normally that wouldn't be that impressive except for how crowded and packed the restaurant already was. Oh! Let me mention now that I am impressed with the eye candy of Lewisville!! I may have to come back this way more often. Back to the review I knew it was a brew house so I simply asked the waitress to bring me their house ""Red"". She said it wasn't a problem, and again I was impressed because now I'm excited she knew what I was asking for. I later took a look at the local flavors and realized there is quite the selection. Nothing like the New Belgium brew houses in Colorado, but then again nobody's perfect.  As my friends arrived we were able to converse in a normal tone for as crowded as it was the high ceilings probably aided in keeping the noise level down. After exchanging pleasantries and cracking some jokes the waitress came back to take their drink order. I was hungry so I asked my friends to order a good appetizer. They insisted the Avocado Egg Rolls be ordered. Knowing they had been here before I went with their selection and I certainly wasn't disappointed. The tamarind sauce they are served with really compliments the avocado. The dinner menu has quite the selection and if you're with a group of people with different tastes everyone should still be able to find something that suits their appetite. I personally had the BBQ chicken chopped salad. Be warned it isn't a small salad! Unless you are really hungry I recommend ordering a half order if possible. I never made it to desert because I kept putting down the red beer they had, so I apologize for not being much of assistance in that category. A casual evening with some goof friends really was a great time. The atmosphere at BJ's was festive and plenty of TVs to watch some college football. I'm sure I'll be back; if anything just to mingle more with the women of Lewisville!!"
Amber B.,"Denton, TX",8,18,,5.0,6/3/2008,"In all fairness, I'm predominantly reviewing the bar side of the restaurant, as that is where we almost always sit.  We love their happy hour (currently M-F 3-7pm, and Sun-Th 9-11pm) discounts which include a dollar off pints, $2 of appetizers, and half price mini-pizzas.  We usually get great service, including one server that always remembers our usual orders.  I've ordered only a few things off the regular menu, and would be willing to recommend the meatloaf (to people who can accept meatloaf of the non-cafeteria variety) and the oreo pizookie for dessert. I find the regular pizooke underwhelming.   All in all I would totally recommend BJ's, especially as a yummy and cheap happy hour date. My rating system (for the curious): Five Stars - Fantastic. I'd go often if I could. Four Stars - Really good. It's likely I'll return. Three Stars - Good, but I won't seek it out for a return visit. Two Stars - I won't go again. This could be due to food, price, atmosphere, whatever. One Star - I won't go again and I suggest everyone follow suit."
RR T.,"Dallas, TX",0,10,,4.0,11/10/2011,Hey this place is yummo!!  We've been twice so far and so far...so good!! We've had lunch and dinner.   Tried one of their brews and it was good...looking forward to Pumpkin Ale!  The noise level is fairly low really and the staff was fast and courteous.  We'll definitely be back!
objective c.,"Lewisville, TX",0,18,,3.0,10/28/2011,"food is aaaaaaaaalmost 5 stars.   service at the bar is 4+ (i may be biased, because it seems i'm only there when brad, chad, or both are working) service on the floor is usually about a 3.....ish service in the cocktail area in the past year or so has gone from 1 star in the past (at best) to nearly 3 stars.  probably because they finally added a 2nd and 3rd cocktail server (sorry, cocktails...but would you rather have a 5 table section tipping you 20-25% each, or the full 20 table section tipping you 10% or less for 3 times the work?). at least this shows that one of the million changes bj's is constantly making has been for the better.  speaking of changes, what's up with the 1,000 bottles of liquor that can't be touched?  yeah, it's a pretty display, but what if 10 friends and i come in, all drinking tanqueray 10, and all that's left is what's on the display?  are you really going to send us to the next bar down the road (i think chaucer's has tanq 10) so we can spend our cash there instead of pulling one of your display bottles down for us? but i digress: the porter is to die for (SO smooth--ladies, try it mixed with the frambois), the stout tastes better than guinness, while it gives the same smooth mouthfeel at over twice the alcohol content, and anyone who really likes beer (BEER--not ""mainstream-light"") needs to try the red and the pale ale.  ask for a taste of both.  or more.  best draft beer selection in the area.  (i'm not counting addisson ;))  where else in lewisville can i order an arrogant bastard?   i thought so. back to the food quick--try the fried halibut tacos.  best fish tacos EVER.  ***if you don't want the whole entree, tell your bartender (your server will probably argue with you and, most likely, so will the manager) you want to Add One Fish Taco.  it's gonna run you about $3 and will be totally worth it*** bonus--they deliver.  and before you say the pizzas are overpriced, try one.  they're by far the best in lewisville."
Andrea E.,"The Colony, TX",0,24,,4.0,6/15/2011,Great service. Always clean. Love their pizza. Prices and wait are reasonable. Beer options are tasty...and their mixes add a special twist!
Chris J.,"Plano, TX",42,8,1,1.0,3/14/2010,"We were there with a party of approx. 8 people and were seated in the bar area.  It was a very busy Saturday night.  There were multiple server's in the bar waiting on tables and taking orders.  However, we were unable to flag a server down to get our order taken.  After approx. 35 minutes of waiting we started waiving our hands and were still unsuccessful getting any service.  After approx. another 10 minutes I started to jokingly get upset.  I took my napkin and twirled it in the air like a flag and eventually caught the manager's attention (Young red headed guy).  He came to the table and began to tell me his restaurant was a family business and I needed to conduct myself in that manner.  I began to tell him that we had been there almost an hour and nobody had taken our order.  I apologized for any actions that may have caused a problem and the manager took our order.  Unbelievably, even after the manager took our order we still got no food or drinks??? One of the people in our party managed to flag a server down who told us she knew nothing about our order.  We asked her to get the manager and he came back and again took our order.  We managed to get our pizza that we ordered but still no drinks.  Not even water.  We ate the pizza and were very upset at this point and wanted to leave.  When I attempted to tab out the pizza was on my check as well as 4 drinks I never got.  I again twirled my napkin in the air, since this seemed to get the manager's attention.  When the manager came back to our table I explained that we got the pizza and ate it but never got the drinks.  I didn't feel I should have to pay for them.  The manager then took the check and came back after a while and the pizza was removed but the drinks I never got were still on the check.  At this point I just wanted to get out of the restaurant and didn't care what it cost me.  So, I paid the check with no further question and left.  Later I found out from a business colleague that the pizza wound up on his check????  I think overall this is a good restaurant but I was so upset with the management this particular night I will probably never go back again.  I really don't know what they could have done worse than charging people for things they never received.  I do not recommend this location but I have had good luck with other locations in Addison, and Dallas Area."
Jihan G.,"Grand Prairie, TX",3,12,3,4.0,5/28/2009,"Bj's is definately my favorite restaurant chain. I love their unique decore, lively atmosphere and (of corse) their pizzas. I have never tried anything here that I really didn't enjoy. They have their own selection of house-brewed beer. They also brew a yummy cider & a root beer (if you like that sorta thing). Check out the happy hour m- f 3:00-7:00. They feature $1 off beer and cocktails, $2 off apps., & 1/2 priced mini pizzas. If I can recall, they might also have a sun-thurs late night happy hour from 9-11, but don't quote me on that. You gotta try the bruschetta appetizer. This is not the kind of thing that I would normally order at all but a friend of mine ordered it once and I have been hooked ever since. It's especially yummy if you asked for extra bruschetta vineaigrett. If you server is newer they will have no idea what you are talking about and they'll bring balsamic. The bruschetta vineaigrett is almost black in color and has a tangy kick. Oh, one last thing no Bj's meal is complete without a pizzookie. It's a cookie baked in a pan like a small pizza toppled with ice cream. It comes in, like 6, different flavors and you and a bud can pick two different flavors and they can bake it half and half on one cookie. The pizookie is free on your birthday!"
