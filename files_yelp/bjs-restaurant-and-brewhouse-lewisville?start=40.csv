J C.,"Coppell, TX",0,32,,2.0,8/14/2017,"Not vegan friendly at all. Servers aren't even that knowledgeable.  You are in a big city, you should be a little more diverse and trained.   Vegan is not the same as gluten free."
T L.,"Prosper, TX",108,7,,1.0,8/15/2017,"Would give 0 starts if I could. We waited more than ten minutes with NO SERVICE in a nearly empty restaurant. Unacceptable! Left to go somewhere that will serve us! To top it off, on our way out, the hostesses said ""or not!"" How rude!"
Shubha S.,"Irving, TX",2,114,13,1.0,11/29/2016,"This restaurant is my family's favorite go to place!  Unfortunately I was very disappointed with our visit last Sunday night.  Since I am a rewards member, I get emails for the specials and promotions going on and I received one for 2 for $25 valid till Dec 8th.  I specifically asked our server Kevin N. about the special and he informed us  'No, they do not have any such deal going on'!  I came home and saw another email from BJ's about the promotion, and wondered if our server was just ignorant or dishonest!  I called the store manager the next day and asked if they have the promotion and if yes, why the server told us they don't.  She apologized and asked me what she could do and offered to send a gift card.  What surprised me was she did not even bother to ask how much we ended up spending or who the server was..."
Misty T.,"Garland, TX",11,15,49,2.0,6/28/2015,"Our server was sweet but she didn't have her stuff together. It was very disorganized and our dirty plates cluttered the table. I started organizing because as a server myself, I knew our desserts would be brought out with a table FULL of dirty dishes. I kid you not. Please see the photos below for an example. P.S the manger was super helpful and was just as upset as us to see the table like that. He was so nice and didn't make it feel like a bother at all that we were complaining. We really appreciate you making the last bit of our dinner pleasant!"
Christine H.,"Carrollton, TX",286,61,108,4.0,12/30/2016,"I've been visiting this BJ's for years, and it's always been a great experience. However, you have to time your visit because of the fairly long wait time that takes place on popular nights to eat in. The service is usually friendly and punctual, and the food is decent at worst and delicious at best. I enjoy visiting here with both family and friends, especially since it can be a place to go to for either a causal time or to celebrate a special event! Their beer and liquor menu is pretty good, as well!"
J B.,"The Colony, TX",4,58,2,5.0,5/3/2017,I ve been to many Bjs locations all over the US and this one is my new home location . Stellar service from Clinton today . Very attentive.
Daryl C.,"Medical Center, Houston, TX",0,46,10,2.0,4/21/2016,"We've had mixed experiences here. The food is usually decent and the variety is really good, but the accuracy of orders isn't where it should be.  Chips and salsa took 20 minutes.  Had an issue tonight with a burger that was raw. The next one was the wrong burger. Then the 3rd version came out and it was obviously a recycle of the previous mistake.  The person who ordered the burger waited about an hour and ended up eating it alone while we watched.  Dessert - ordered 2 and they brought one. Had a hair on it. Tough night.  No management involvement. They did comp the burger and dessert in the end."
Polly S.,"Little Elm, TX",215,236,352,4.0,7/4/2015,"Came last night with a friend to the bar, order drinks and Spinach & Chip dip appetizer it was A LOT!!!! Perfect! The place was busy but bartender was attentive and nice. I like the one in Allen's better though."
Derek M.,"Irving, TX",156,3,,5.0,1/25/2017,"This place is absolutely fabulous.  Cameron (one of the managers) came to our table to insure that everything was going well.  We rarely have a manager come to our table so this was a pleasant surprise.  It's obvious that he really cares for his customers.  Our server, Whitney, was also amazing.  She was prompt to fill our drinks and provided outstanding service.  I'll definitely come back and will refer friends and family."
Jordan P.,"Cincinnati, OH",1,14,,4.0,1/22/2017,"Great atmosphere, multiple tvs available for games. They brew a good variety of beer with an even bigger variety of food. Nice place to go for a game. Prices are above average but definitely worth it."
Zane H.,"Coppell, TX",0,2,1,5.0,1/17/2017,"This BJ's is great! While we had a small hiccup this evening, which consisted of meat on a veggie only pizza, the service was phenomenal. The head manager, did not manage to grab his name, came over to us immediately after we told our waitress about the problem. He then made sure to comp the problem pizza, and then he also gave us dessert on the house! This is the third time I've been here, and my fiancé and I plan to come here many more times. We fully recommend the deep dish pizza as well the pizookie."
Christy Thy D.,"Lewisville, TX",208,41,64,2.0,3/17/2015,"This place needs to bump up the customer service. We came 2 hours before close to get dessert and we didn't get our food until almost close time.  I've gone here time and time again but the service has always been the same. Terrible.  When we walked in we were promptly greeted, we were sat immediately.  Okay good right? Wrong. We waited 30 minutes before a server came to our table because it seemed like the host did not communicate with the server. So we were forgotten. When the server finally came she looked so stressed out because she was working a huge table by herself and she didn't seem to be able to handle it. We didn't get refills with our drinks and food took so long to come out. We saw our server twice during the whole thing. We ordered a Pizookie and it was delicious.  Maybe I should try another location?"
J C.,"Austin, TX",0,11,6,5.0,6/12/2016,"Excellent food and service! I eat there ALL the time. Their drinks, beer, and variety of food are only topped by one thing - the service!!! If you need something they are swift to make sure you are thoroughly accommodated, satisfied, and a happy customer. Only five stars since I can't choose more!!  It was nice that the bartender actually introduced himself. As many times as I eat there, he is the first to have done so (and no one wears name tags so you don't know who is served you). Henry did an EXCELLENT job - he was extremely attentive and super friendly and expeditiously filled any request I had. He rocks!"
linda j.,"Bartlett, IL",34,61,49,5.0,10/26/2016,Threat food good drinks. Relaxing and bar like sports bar type place but have upscale food.  Very good.
Stephanie H.,"The Colony, TX",36,461,57,5.0,1/27/2015,The food here is really good and decently priced. The appetizers are really cheap and i recommend you get the Mac and cheese.for desert get the chocolate chip pizookie. I ordered online for curbside and they were fast at getting my order to me. I would recommend you eat here because the food is really good.
David G.,"Plano, TX",67,118,35,3.0,3/17/2016,"Have always loved the Santa Fe salad w salmon.  The Santa Fe dressing is excellent and also a tasty dip for the seasoned wedge fries.  Salad today was good, but wish they would mix in some spinach or arugula and it was light on the cheese. Salmon was good and fries were piping hot."
Benetta P.,"Shreveport, LA",424,355,2836,4.0,5/15/2015,Great atmosphere. Salad was fresh. Tomato bisque is the best in all of the united states for me. I have found none to match. The pizza was good but since my bisque came out early i had to ask for marinara to dip my pizza in.
Federica X F.,"Irving, TX",0,9,,3.0,6/6/2017,"Have visited a couple of times now and am hardly blown away by the food, but definitely disappointed with the service. Our waiter the other night was much too casual, made way too many jokes, and discussed his personal life with us. We were a group of teenagers so that may be why he felt comfortable doing thing, but it was very very uncomfortable. The pizookies are good and the jalapeño burger is pretty good, but I would say that most of the menu is overpriced."
Alejandro C.,"Dallas, TX",181,122,55,4.0,3/13/2016,"Came in here on a Friday evening after work with a large party and was seated almost immeidately. The happy hour specials here are great and they are available in the general seating are not just the bar. Stone and Lagunitas IPA's both on TAP, this is a great place for a Friday night Happy Hour event."
Shakinah C.,"Southlake, TX",16,24,21,4.0,1/13/2015,I would keep going there just for their thin french fries!! I also liked their watermelon feta cheese salad. It was light and yum.  Great service hours and crowd always.
