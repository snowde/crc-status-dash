Dan G.,"Coppell, TX",105,14,2,3.0,7/27/2016,Jacked my bill twice.  Really!  The last charge on my ticket is for a beer I didn't order. Then the manager corrects it and takes the other beers off happy hour price!  Corporate conspiracy ?
Gaby M.,"Dallas, TX",0,8,17,3.0,10/9/2016,"I am a frequent visitor here as I love coming here to grab a bite with my friends over dinner or ordering a pizookie to go. Normally, the service is average, but it wasn't that good when I went. My friends and I did a group order online ahead of time and I didn't even get my pizza until 45 minutes later than all of my friends. Also, the restaurant was halfway packed and I've had much faster service when they're completely packed and you have to wait to be seated. I will still probably come to this food establishment, but I was very disappointed in their service."
Michelle Z.,"The Colony, TX",0,1,,1.0,1/28/2017,"EAT AT THIS ESTABLISHMENT AT YOUR OWN RISK!!! A mere $40 dinner ended up costing me over $3000 which included an ER visit and missed work!! My husband and I stopped for dinner, he had the pizza, I ordered the jambalaya. About an hour after leaving the restaurant I started feeling ill. Several hours later I got sick!! Fluid was pouring out of every orifice of my body. I can say I have never been this ill in my life. That spicey jambalaya is awful coming up!! This went on for several hours until my body started cramping. I called a Dr who advised me to head to the ER. At the hospital the er Dr told me I was well on my way to dehydration and it was a good thing I came in. While in the hospital I had an allergic reaction to the pain meds I was given which caused additional issues! After getting everything under control I was sent home. It took me a couple days to recover... My body was exhausted! We called Bj's prior to heading to the hospital to let them know that I had gotten food poisoning from eating their tainted jambalaya, just wanted to give them a heads up. Didn't want anyone else going through what I experiencing at that moment! They were uncaring! The manager took my number down and said someone would call back. They turned my number over to their headquarters Risk management department. After 3 months, BJ's determined that they were not the cause for my food poisoning. Not sure how they came to that conclusion since my husband and I had eaten the same things over the previous days except that one meal and I can assure it was jambalaya rapidly escaping my body! We never asked for money, just wanted them to be aware! They just don't care! STAY AWAY or really.... Eat at your own risk!! We won't EVER be returning to this BJ's or any of them for that matter!! (and it deserves zero stars but that's not an option)"
Jared O.,"Denton, TX",34,61,2,4.0,10/30/2016,"Fast service a decent beer selection. I got a bison burger and artichoke dip. The food was flavorful and cooked the way I asked. One (totally biased) complaint though: I saw the ""deep dish"" pizza come out to another table, and that IS NOT deep dish! (I used to live 25 min from Chicago city center, and THAT is deep dish!)"
Tamara D.,"Arlington, TX",185,121,499,2.0,11/6/2014,"BJ's has great beer. With that being said,  everything else is bland.  Everyone brags on the avacado eggrolls  but I wasn't cool with ingesting 1000 calories per serving.  Waiter was inattentive.  This is a good place to watch the game or happy hour,  if you actually care about the taste of your food,  go elsewhere (definitely don't get the parm crusted chicken)."
Catherine C.,"Plano, TX",6,56,32,2.0,1/1/2016,"We keep coming here because the food is delicious, but with all the problems we've had with service the past 3 times we've been here, we won't be returning.  Even on days when the restaurant is not even half full, like today, we sat for fifteen minutes before the waitress came by to take our order. She took our order, and now it's been another 20 minutes and we have nothing at our table.  The waitstaff here needs to be culled or retrained. as I said the food is great but we're tired of getting impolite, unapologetic, insanely slow service. Two stars."
Kat Y.,"Lewisville, TX",5,74,4,1.0,10/31/2015,"I've been here many times, I've even brought my out of town family because of the great selection. The last time we went, however, will be the last time. Our glassware was filthy. So we sent it back. Our server said that the smears/ food particles were normal and to be expected. Next round of waters had the same issue - super filthy glassware. My beer glass was also dirty. So we sent the glasses back again and while our server was gone, we checked our silverware and all pieces had food stick to them. We decided that was enough. Asked to speak to the manager. He walked by us 2 times and the hostess said ""I swear I told him.""  Finally he shows up and said ""let us get you some clean glasses.""  Uh, no. We don't trust you. We won't be back. Additional note: the manager who left the message below no longer works there."
Ryan H.,"Tampa, FL",1,11,17,2.0,4/4/2017,"Food was great! My guest and I felt very rushed by our server, Makayla, despite eating at 7:30pm on a Tuesday with many open tables. But the food was good!"
Rusty P.,"Kansas City, MO",67,12,13,5.0,5/16/2016,"I love BJ's. The food is always delicious and the service is always excellent. When we got there tonight the place was ""hoping"". Our order got slowed down, so the waiter spoke with the manager and they comped us desert. I felt like we were treated as valued guests."
Joseph B.,"Anchorage, AK",365,9,2,4.0,9/5/2016,"The one time I went here I got the pot roast in mashed potatoes. It was really delicious, and the atmosphere was modern and trendy."
Paul H.,"The Colony, TX",0,1,,1.0,3/3/2017,"Food was not appetizing. I would not consider eating here until the construction is done.   Wow, so bad."
Grace O.,"Carrollton, TX",110,19,5,4.0,8/17/2016,"Food is excellent, last time i went service was slow even though i went at an unbusy time. But their pizookies and to die for. An essential to your BJS visit"
Vickie H.,"Carrollton, TX",0,5,,2.0,9/21/2016,"This was only the second time we have eaten here. The food is just barely passable.The ribs and the Salmon were dry and way over cooked. The couscous was watery, the burger was pretty good. The wedge salad was not cold and had one little sprinkle of blue cheese. The wedge fries tasted old. We won't be back."
Anai G.,"The Colony, TX",223,28,42,4.0,10/11/2015,"The  ; food here tonight was amazing. When I bit into the egg roll starter I feel into a daze. As my BestFriend said ""that just hit the spot"". Although I eat salads without dressing and crisp toppings, my Ahi Tuna Salad was delicioso (delicious). Colby had the dinner glazed salmon quinoa bowl and the taste of that brought a smile to my face when I began to chew. Our bartender Logan was great. The whole experience was perfect."
Enos B.,"Rogers, AR",48,7,1,4.0,10/11/2015,"Was in town on business and the guy at the hotel pointed me to this restaurant. It was only a mile or so away. So glad he did. The facility was nice and looked fairly new. The atmosphere and decor was nice.  The selection of beer/wine/spirits was extensive. The wait staff was nice and prompt. I ordered the Honey Sriracha Brussel Sprouts as an appetizer. If I had knows how good they were going to be, I would have just ordered another one and eaten both for dinner. After having just eaten some very expensive dinners at big name restaurants in Las Vegas, this was the best thing I've eaten this year. I'm determined to figure out how to make these myself.  The rest of the food was good as well.  I liked the place well enough I tipped the guy at the hotel for sending me over there."
Jan C.,"Lewisville, TX",14,6,1,5.0,2/4/2017,We had the best waitress.  Her name was Tiffany and I could not say enough on how nice she was. We had a party of 9 and didn't miss a thing with us. She had our food hot and so good.  I called in advanced so we can be seated faster and it worked. We walked in waited for the rest of our party to arrive and we were seated fast and friendly staff
Mel V.,"Irving, TX",12,29,11,4.0,6/26/2016,1st time here.  I like the open feel of this restaurant so that you can see multiple tvs no matter where you sit.  They have a huge menu which is great for us picky eaters.  What truly made my day was the ability to substitute out couscous with quinoa for my dish with no issues and no extra charge.  I eill definitely be back!
Monica R.,"Garland, TX",0,26,147,5.0,6/26/2016,The service was great. Tried their sweet pig pizza and it was delicious. I've got to go back to try their famous pizookie!
Neha M.,"Garfield, NJ",800,1048,369,5.0,6/24/2014,"Always a good time at BJ's.  Last I remember I came for a basketball game... and you can sit anywhere and have a good view of a TV.  SO many tv's  here.  There's a big one at the bar too so I like sitting at a booth near there.  I told the bartender I wanted a beer with a hint of honey to  it, and he brought me out 3 samples before I picked the one I wanted.  I love when I can get samples before purchasing a beer full priced. All the food items are so good, pizza especially.  It has that nice thick crust, and a good serving of pizza sauce.  avocado egg rolls yummy.  Soup's are delicious.  Salads- great, but can't really go wrong there.  The best thing is the pazookie dessert.  Ahhh.  SO good.  Sometimes we come here just to get the dessert!"
A C.,"Garland, TX",0,10,2,4.0,8/4/2016,"I love bj's for the food- there isn't anything bad on the menu. This location is one of the slowest service ones that I've ever been to, if you're in a hurry, be sure to let them know so they get you in and out, or better yet use their awesome to go service!"
