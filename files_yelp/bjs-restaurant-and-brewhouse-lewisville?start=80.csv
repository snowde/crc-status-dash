Grant B.,"Frisco, TX",199,5,,1.0,4/26/2016,"Food is typically good, but the wait staff is AWFUL. You can tell that they really do not care about the customers. It seems like you're annoying them when you just ask them to do their job. They just want a tip and that's it. They really don't care. Overall, it is a RUDE and INSENSITIVE staff. You can get better service at a Steak N Shake down the block. Not planning on coming back..."
James L.,"Flower Mound, TX",20,19,,4.0,7/31/2016,"Had a nice family dinner last night. Good service and good food. I was pleased to see an expanded variety of Pazookis, plus the trio option. The menu is extensive, as is the beer selection."
Sarah S.,"Wylie, TX",106,18,16,4.0,6/12/2015,"Came here on a Friday night so naturally it was pretty busy! The wait was about 15-20 minutes so it wasn't that bad. I ordered the Hawaiian mahi-mahi and I thought it was very flavorful! However, the reason why I gave this BJ's location 4 stars and not 5 is because my fish was pretty dry; if it was a little more moist this dish would have been fantastic! The rice that came with the fish was very good though! The ginger soy sauce and pineapple in the rice was fantastic! Also another tip to those dining here, I do not recommend their Long Island iced tea, they are watered down and do not have much flavor."
Jason K.,"Coppell, TX",137,5,1,4.0,7/24/2016,The service is usually pretty good. Had the honey glazed salmon which was cooked very well!
Captain J.,"Plano, TX",2,52,,1.0,3/9/2016,"Please keep in mind, to keep Yelp accurate, please always note; if the :Rave Review"" 5 Stars appears to be extremely well scripted and is accompanied by commercial quality pictures of the food, it is usually a paid for  advertisement or employee and/or friend of and employee entry.  So, my girlfriend tells me BJ's has a 1/2 off night, she picks up the pizza and brings it home. I guess if you like lots of bread and NO sauce as well as toppings which encompass a 6 inch diameter within the pizza, I'm going back Pizza Hut delivery...  I suppose 1/2 price also implies 1/2 a pizza. (an old bar trick when advertising 1/2 happy hour appetizers)."
Sarah M.,"Denton, TX",136,168,58,1.0,7/30/2015,"I hadn't been to this location in a long time.  I met a friend here for dinner, and our waiter was awful.  My order didn't come out right, and wasn't even hot.  I didn't complain bc I never could get our waiter to come to our table.  Not a good experience.  I won't be back."
Francheska G.,"Dallas, TX",0,5,3,2.0,6/5/2016,"My experience was okay. My server wasn't very friendly but she got the job done. The food was just okay, I ordered the California chicken sandwich, nothing spectacular. My fries tasted like they'd been siting out for a while, not hot. We got the spinach artichoke dip, probably one of my least favorite dips at a sit in restaurant. I might come again might not."
Anj L.,"Irving, TX",321,392,472,4.0,2/22/2014,"When we dine here, it is always in the bar area, since it is more laid back. Yes, this is a chain restaurant, but the food is consistently good and fairly priced. Their draft beers are served icy cold and are delicious."
Shannon S.,"Little Elm, TX",0,4,1,5.0,7/9/2016,"Fabulous food and service! Atmosphere was good, waiter was very attentive and did I say the food was good? Amazing!"
Efrain R.,"Irving, TX",31,98,539,2.0,7/9/2014,"Great atmosphere to hang out with friends.  But the service was horrible and it took forever to get our order, our food AND our check. Plus the food is average at best.  This is the type of place I would never suggest but will tag along if that's where everyone wants to go. Plus it's very expensive."
Corey L.,"Canton, OH",0,19,,4.0,12/5/2016,Great house beer. Huge menu. Great place for sports. Average prices. Can't go wrong at one of these.
Chris M.,"Dallas, TX",3,21,7,1.0,3/7/2015,"Awful, awful service. Waiter did not take notes when the order was placed (party of 3) and consequently dropped one complete meal order and a side of fries. Even the two he remembered took 45 mins to arrive. The missing orders were requested again (from the manager who was apologetic) and eventually arrived an hour in. . Drinks were not refilled - not once.  The waiter himself seemed aloof  Never at this location again."
Nada N.,"Irving, TX",0,31,3,4.0,7/10/2016,"For starters, the place is really dim. Too dim to a point where I couldn't really see the people around me. Aside from that, the food was great, the waitress were very kind and the prices were just a little over the top."
Brian S.,"Flower Mound, TX",35,3,,2.0,5/24/2016,Ordered two apps.  The brussel sprouts were mediocre at best.  The chili Verde queso was awful.  Two chips in and we tossed it.  Chicken bacon pizza was just ok.  French dip was average.  No fries with kids corndogs.  Only reason we went was for kids spirit night and won't return.
Adam M.,"Irving, TX",3,26,,1.0,3/1/2015,"Poor service. Very disappointed because I love BJs. Do not recommend this location.  We were seated on a small table. No prob there. Asked the server about the difference between the vegetarian pizza vs. the veggie prime. She said they were basically the same but in reality she did not know the difference. Ordered a large pizza, clam chowder in a bread bowl with Cesar salad, fried calamari and a side of fries. The calamari was soggy and soft. All the food except for the soup was mildly warm. Almost room temp. So in a couple of minutes they did become room temperature. Everything tasted good though but not fun to eat room temperature food.  So initially we were served the calamari. The rest of the food was brought to the table except for the fries. The server left the calamari plate. So we had all the food plus one of those drink menus at our table. There was very little room to eat at all. No biggie, I'll just tell the server to clear away some stuff. We also wanted Parmesan cheese and crushed red pepper for our pizza. The problem was that our server did not come back to our table for the whole meal. So it was really uncomfortable to eat our cold food cause there was no room. Also we didn't have Parmesan cheese and red pepper so we could not eat our pizza the way we wanted to.  I was trying to look around for our server and couldn't find her. When I finally found her she was just talking to the other servers! I saw her talking for a couple of minutes then I lost track of her. When she came back I told her to cancel the fries, to get us boxes and the check. It was a very frustrating experience because the food tasted good but the temperature of the food and the service sucked. I was so upset I didn't even order a pazookie... And I loooove pazookies."
Manisa K.,"Charlotte, NC",388,243,175,4.0,3/11/2014,"My favorite American restaurant for nice dinner and hanging out. This place is so nice. They have a variety of crafts beer. They are all good. Actually, BJ's looks like a nice sport bar in my opinion. Their food are good.  My favorites are avocado egg rolls, pizzas, Thai chicken and mango salad, and Atlantic salmon. You can't go wrong with pizookies as desert. YUMMY!! And pizookies as your birthday freebie!!! Don't forget it's always crowded at dinner time. You have to wait a little while. Staffs are not that attentive and even careless. I'm not impressed about their service. It's way too slow."
Justin W.,"Denver, CO",271,199,1427,4.0,5/18/2014,Do this: Order a Jeremiah Red  Do this: Order the California burger Do this: Get a side of ranch Do this: Order another Red Do this: come for happy hour These are the perfect ingredients for a fantastic evening.
Jack W.,"Euless, TX",0,7,,1.0,6/9/2016,I guess you can look at the other reviews and judge. Wait staff great. Kitchen just gets worse and worse. After tonight I'll never go back. Just ridiculous that management keeps putting up with these guys.  Brussel sprouts burnt and cold inside.  Ribs came out cold...very cold. Guess whoever did baked potato is only person back there paying attention.  It was alright!!
Stephen J.,"Irving, TX",0,15,,3.0,12/4/2016,Enjoy eating here.  Went around 10:30 since advertised as being open by then. What they publish is not correct.  Do not show up before 11 am unless you want to sit in your car for 30 minutes or so.  When open it is a nice place and the food/service is great.
Erika B.,"Dallas, TX",131,109,6,3.0,1/27/2015,"This is my second time coming to the Lewisville location. I've never had an issue with the food. The service was not the best. We didn't see the waitstaff for about 10 minutes after being seated.  The table shared the avocado egg rolls, which were surprisingly tasty. I've always been a little skiddish to try fried avocado.  I opted for the scallops on their ""lighter"" menu which came with seared scallops, a tomato type topping, asparagus and brown rice. I found the rice to be a bit bland, but the rest was very good. Our salads came after our main courses, which was a little annoying but forgivable.  Overall, decent experience and good food."
