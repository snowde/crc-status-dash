Benson G.,"Nicholasville, KY",2,46,6,3.0,9/13/2017,"I really want to like this place. Have been a couple times and still don't really care for it. Burgers are OK. The pizza tastes like it was made elsewhere, frozen, and warmed up at the restaurant. The portions are big enough, but if it doens't taste good how much do you really want? Desserts are fantastic, and really what made us come back. Atmosphere is like I imagine a big city sports bar would be. Everything but dessert seems very overpriced to me. Go for dessert after you have a nice meal elsewhere, or have dessert elsewhere too."
CT S.,"Lexington, KY",0,3,,1.0,1/1/2018,"Oh BJ's, its just not meant to be. And its definitely not me, its you Bj's, its all you. So my wife and I tried BJs again after a less than stellar visit in November for her 50th birthday. Slow service, cold cheese curds, inedible salad, mediocre and underseasoned prime rib and snail-paced service.  We decided to give this spot another chance after the general manager called after I left an initial review. I had really high hopes after I spoke with   Lee Ann.  She was apologetic and understood the concerns and promised to address them with the staff. We were sent a $50 gift card to try BJs again. So we did today and we've just come to the conclusion that BJs is just not a place we will return to.  Some of the same issues on this visit.  Slow service from start to finish in the middle of the day when it was not even close to being full. Our server, who's name we never got and they don't wear name tags, was pleasant enough. But the length of time between getting drinks, getting appetizers, getting salads and getting our entrees was a bit much.   Again we ordered the cheese curds again because they are delicious.  I can only imagine how good they are when they are actually piping hot. I can only attest to what they taste like when they hover between lukewarm and room temperature.  I got a garden salad and my wife got a caesar. Her's was so wilted and was room temp at best. She said it looked like it had been sitting somewhere for hours. My salad was adequate. Their blue cheese dressing is GROSS but the salad was at least vibrant and didn't seem to be old. We both ordered the sirloin, she had the mashed potatoes which were good but dry.  I too ordered the sirloin but the waiter heard ""ribeye"". I also ordered the mac and cheese couscous. I would not advise ordering that unless you really really like cheese. It was alot of cheese with some couscous. It was very, very orange. My steak was kind of fatty and was absent of any sort of seasoning.  A true disappointment. Even the au jus and horseradish I asked for was bland. The staff have always been pleasant and nice.  But the quality of food and the slow service makes BJs a place we are highly unlikely to patron again. Its not a place I would recommend to anyone either. There are many, many, many places, without comically large menus, that serve high quality food."
Ken H.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,18,1,1.0,12/29/2017,"I am very familiar with the BJ'S Restaurant chain and frequent it quite often. This was my first time at this location and most likely my last. We came in and ordered drinks and appetizers, and we're very disappointed to see that our Artichoke Hearts (who were served to by a food runner) were really really burnt. How and why would you even bring these to a table when they were literally  black?  We summoned our server Mallory (who was absolutely fantastic) to return these to the kitchen for some new ones. Mallory agreed and ordered us some new ones.  The artichoke's they sent us were now RAW and GREASY, and again why would you send out raw and greasy food?  I asked to speak with the Manager who took her time but finally made it to the table and introduced herself. She asked what the problem was and I explained the issues with her. She said that she saw the first batch of artichoke hearts and agreed that they were unacceptable, I then told her that this almost seemed to be retaliatory to us because nobody could be off that far off on just a simple deep fried appetizer. She disagreed and said that it was not possible because it is not our policy not to be retaliatory. I then tried to explain that deep fried appetizers are a very simple item to make with minimal effort needed to prepare them that is why I thought this may have been retaliatory for sending back the first ones. She again proceeded to say that this was not possible due to their policy. So I asked if it is policy to cook and send out food that is burnt or raw? Finally her reply was ""that people make mistakes"" Exactly!!! Then own it and don't argue with your customers! Just tell them that you apologize and that you will look into the issue, nothing more nothing less, please do not try to make excuses for the problems that come out of the kitchen saying that they are impossible just because you have a policy. Good managers Fix problems, they don't make excuses."
Kate S.,"Lexington, KY",23,94,43,1.0,10/21/2017,"I'm sure there are lots of things this chain does well...I just have absolutely no idea what they are. This was my third time at BJ's Lexington, and it will be my last.  I try to give restaurants the benefit of the doubt, especially on my first visit, but the benefit of the doubt is not what this restaurant needs.  The food is terrible, the drinks are weak and overpriced, and the waitstaff seems not at all concerned about getting their customers what they need...unless it's another drink...but not of water. I first tried this chain in California, and I will admit that once I saw that they served a French dip sandwich, I didn't try many other things.  The French dip was really good, tender medium rare sliced beef with cheese and sautéed onions  on a toasted roll.  It was truly delicious.  When BJ's opened in Lexington I was excited to try the French dip again; it wasn't even the same sandwich.  I actually sent it back to the kitchen, a rare occurrence for me. My second meal here was with a friend.  We ordered drinks and appetizers.  I was told they didn't have Grey Goose vodka, so I settled for whatever they said they had.  When we were leaving I saw the Grey Goose on the bar shelf, so I asked about it and was told that the happy hour price didn't include premium vodka.  I would have liked to have been given the option (but I wasn't) and would have opted to pay more for the vodka I like.  We hadn't intentionally arrived during happy hour so that wasn't a draw for me. The third/last visit tonight was to satisfy a deep dish pizza craving.  My husband and I opted to sit at the bar rather than wait 40+ minutes for a table (I counted 8 empty tables and there were several groups waiting to be seated).  We ordered two drinks and asked how long the wait would be for pizza - 10-15 minutes.  Over 30 minutes later, with no pizza and no offer to refill our drinks, we were rethinking our decision not to order an appetizer.  The pizza did arrive, finally, and it was the sorriest excuse for a pizza I have ever seen.  Seriously, DiGiorno would have been better.  Micro toppings, no sauce, and a prefab crust that was less like a pizza crust and more like focaccia bread.  I have included pictures of the actual pizza we received - the first shows the small pile of toppings I scraped off the ""crust"". Our bill for this meal was $50 including tip.  We both felt robbed.  I rarely leave any restaurant actually angry but that is exactly the way I left this restaurant.   Maybe they do a good happy hour (though their appetizers aren't great), or maybe they are a good place to watch a football game, but they are not a good place to spend your money if you actually care about the quality of the food you eat.  Lexington has EXCELLENT pizza (see my review for Crust) and there isn't a single thing on the menu at BJ's that isn't done better in one of Lexington's local restaurants.  My advice:  don't waste your money here."
Marsha B.,"Cincinnati, OH",30,62,49,5.0,11/19/2017,"This was my first time eating here. Many options for beer and food. This place was packed on a Saturday night!  Sat at the bar. Beer was good. Service was great. Pizza was amazing. And I had the chili cherry salmon. It was out of this world!  The wait for the food was a bit long but they were extremely busy. Also try the cream soda, it's homemade and amazing. We bought a growler of it to go. You can buy growlers the the cream soda and their beers, which is nice for later. The food prices are what I would expect for Lexington."
Joy V.,"Lexington, KY",31,60,2,2.0,1/10/2018,"Well folks I'm going to try to be nice but if I'm honest it may be difficult.  I had heard good things about this place from others who had eaten at other locations.  My husband and I went there after our grandsons basketball games on Saturday.  It looked like a regular sports bar; no problem there.  The hostess was very nice.  Seated us where we requested.  All downhill from that point.  We waited for 15 minutes for water that we had requested upon being seated.  The server was nice enough except he was trying to cover too many tables and we waited for an unreasonable time.  He also informed us that the kitchen was swamped with a catering order and our food may be delayed.  Finally we got to order...my husband had chili and I got tortilla soup and a grilled cheese sandwich.  Again it was way too long.  After waiting all that time we were really hungry.  Sadly the food was really bad.  Chili was cold and flavorless, soup was like trying to eat fat jello, and the sandwich was ok but very bland.  I didn't expect a 4 star meal but this was a bad experience.   We ate what we could, paid our bill as quickly as possible, and left.  Honestly, we don't have plans to return.  I'm sorry but this restaurant won't survive with this quality of food and service.  First, I'd advise you to train your servers to keep your business ""your business"".  Customers really don't want to hear excuses that their food isn't going to go well as soon as they sit down.  You need to totally redo your chili and tortilla soup.   Yuck is the one word I find fits the description.  Your two cheese grilled cheese sandwich is a good idea but needs different cheeses.  The two you use weren't tasty at all, but the grilled buttered bread was really good.  All I could eat of it was the bread.  Sorry but sugar coating my review won't help the business.  Hopefully they will see this and take it seriously.  If not, this establishment won't be here long.  Man can not live on beer alone!"
Meg B.,"Louisville, KY",50,2,,5.0,1/9/2018,"I have always had an excellent experience at this restaurant. All of the tacos are great and the desserts are to die for! I have had good service each time I've gone and am always greeted as soon as I sit down. There is a wide range of menu items so it is easy to take a family here as there's something for everyone.  If you're a drinker, the beer selection is also phenomenal. I would definitely recommend this restaurant being on the list of places to eat at in Lexington!!!!"
Nikki B.,"Georgetown, KY",33,153,367,3.0,6/24/2017,"Ten of us were here on a Friday night (last night) to celebrate our June birthdays. It was relatively busy, but not too bad-no extensive waits. The service started out ok, but got worse with each passing minute. We were rarely asked if we wanted another drink, just picked up the empty glasses and kept moving. Took forever for our food to come out and when it did, one of our orders was messed up(I guess 9 out of 10 isn't bad).  The food: here there are no complaints. Our meals were really good and just about everyone cleaned their plates or took food home. Between pizza, steak, burgers, pork chops, chicken, we had a taste of just about the main items they offered.  We also shared the monkey bread-it was awesome!! A must try!  Anyway, my three stars are mainly due to the service, not the food. I will return because the food was good and I loved the atmosphere. See if service improves."
Brian K.,"Lexington, KY",52,72,99,1.0,7/20/2017,"I give up.  I'm not sure how to get waited on in this place. Right now I'm sitting in TGIF's because the wait staff wanted to sit around and chat with friends at a table 10 feet from us at a bar table. No one even spoke to us until we got up to leave. The bartender said we should have sat at the bar and he would have waited on us, which means he saw us but didn't clue someone in.   I wonder why the parking lot is empty.  My mistake thinking I would get good service when this is the second time it has happened.  I must smell."
Bonnie E.,"Lexington, KY",13,1,,5.0,11/30/2017,"BJ's has become one of my favorite restaurants! My sister and I go there at least twice a week. Food is always great, lots to choose from. Best Managers, bartenders and servers in town! Lee Anne part of the Management team always goes out of her way to make sure our dining experience is the best it could be! Very professional and friendly, greeting us with a smile!"
Mary M.,"Lexington, KY",0,1,,5.0,1/9/2018,"BJ's was great!  I went on New Years Eve and had great service even though they were very busy.  We got appetizers, main course, and dessert and all our dishes were very tasty.  Lots of menu options, so it's good for a crowd. I would definitely go back!"
Katie L.,"Wexford, PA",184,6,,1.0,1/9/2018,Absolutely terrible service. We received our food with no silverware and the server didn't check on us for 15 minutes after that.....so we couldn't eat for 15 minutes after our food came out. When we did start eating my soup was clumpy and rubbery. The margarita I received was very very weak....but I paid $10 for it!!! And the server didn't tell us about any of their specials. I'll never go back
Brittany F.,"Wilmore, KY",102,73,98,5.0,7/24/2017,"I've never had a bad experience here. Everything is very good. Huge salads, awesome burgers, tasty pizza. Monday's are half price pizza. The app allows tons of free items and coupons. Plenty of parking. Very clean. Great brews."
Kriss W.,"Lexington, KY",18,124,172,3.0,12/6/2016,"I've struggled with this review, I've been between a 3 and 4 but I think I have to land on the 3 just because of the service. It is really 3.5  It is a big chain restaurant , So I try to take that into account.  The husband and I rolled in for pizza and beer.  The server knew little about either. But both were great! I had a fight that was yummy and the IPA should be an upsell for sure! I will be back for a friend date soon.  I hope I can upgrade the review."
Drew G.,"Lexington, KY",76,110,348,3.0,2/12/2017,"I like the large menu. Not as much as the Cheesecake Factory though. I was surprised at how busy they were Saturday night. It's a big place and the service is slow. I would say the food is ""not bad or okay.""  For the price, I expect more.  The drink prices are ridiculous. A glass of Rhinegeist  Truth was $8 and a martini $9.50. I can get both for less at many fine dining restaurants.  My New Orleans Jambalaya was not bad. It was well seasoned and fresh. For the $17 price I would expect more meat in the dish. It had plenty of shrimp but should have had more chicken and I couldn't even find any of the andouille sausage that was supposed to be there. Plenty of fresh bell peppers and onions. My girlfriend felt like she could get a better meal at O' Charley's. She had the California Chicken Sandwich and fries.  Her entire meal was served cold.  I asked them for fresh fries and they quickly returned with a large plate of fresh shoestring fries, but her sandwich should have been warm and she ate it cold. This is the second time that I have dined here and overall I think that they have a wide selection of mediocre, overpriced food with slow service. We won't be going back."
Andrea L.,"Lexington, KY",38,21,1,5.0,12/3/2017,I love this place!  I had such a nice experience here on my first ever visit recently. I met a friend for a drink and an app at the bar. The food was excellent and the staff was very nice. I look forward to going back soon!
Shaun J.,"Richmond, KY",0,1,,1.0,11/8/2017,"I went there today and had an amazing young female as a server. I figured I would inform the management of what a great job she had done. I asked her to get the manager so I could speak with that individual and was met by LeAnn, this is where everything went downhill. She was rude, unprofessional, her appearance was very unkept and honestly felt like she had better things to do than to talk to guests. The food, beer and service were great but the manager left a bad taste in my mouth (pun intended)  I have worked in the restaurant business for many years as a manager and have never been so embarrassed for the staff than I am right now knowing she is in management. Overall it was a very good visit but I will not return if this is the individual they place in management."
Eli C.,"Cedar Rapids, IA",3,43,6,3.0,7/4/2017,"Good beer. Food service seemed slow for awhile, but it is a holiday weekend so I'm sure they had a hard time finding people to work. Manager was very appropriate with a couple who was upset their food took a long time. Food seems to be coming out quicker now. Beer is $3.50 which is great! Had a signature cocktail which was good, but $10.50. Overall I'd come again."
Heather P.,"Lexington, KY",1367,1367,6002,4.0,7/30/2016,"Just be aware that the service is slooooow, so go into it with at least two hours to spare. We checked in at 6:23 on a Friday evening and were told that the estimated wait was twenty minutes. At 7:00 luckily we scored a bar side first come, first served walk up table. So they apparently don't even know how slow the service is.  With a fantastic name like BJ's, I really wasn't sure what to expect, yeah I went there and I was the first one to mention it. It kind of reminded me of a sports bar, but the employees are all dressed up, so it's a bit different. They have a ton of brews posted on the back wall, some of which they brew themselves... in Texas. They also have wine and a fully stocked bar too, so don't let the brewhouse part of the name fool you either.  From the time that our table finally got cleaned off, our drinks arrived about twenty minutes after we ordered. I decided on the bison burger. With its fancy toppings and load of barbecue sauce, I thought it was pretty good. If you decide on the bison burger, do keep in mind that it comes pink and that is normal because bison isn't as greasy as hamburger, so well done would make it too dry. I learned that from my friend Ted, who happens to serve up the best bison burgers in Lexington. I also tried the boneless chicken wings. You can choose from a variety of sauces, but we chose the hot barbecue. The sauce wasn't too bad, but I don't recommend it if you're a lightweight. They were perfectly battered and the chicken was white meat. When we were waiting for a table, they brought around deep dish pizza for us to sample and I will say that it was excellent! Everything that I tried was great. Their only problem seems to be the slow service. Lets give them a chance though, maybe a few months to get some experience."
Teresa J.,"Lexington, KY",45,45,11,5.0,1/29/2017,"Stopped in for lunch today with my Mom and daughter.   Since the opening, we've dined here about 8 times.  Each time the service has been lackluster at best.  The food has always been great, but the service, until today, was so-so...    This visit was, by far, our most pleasant experience with all facets of a dining out meal.    Alexis was our server and we will be sure to ask for her on future visits.   She went above and beyond.   My steak was cooked a near perfect rare; whoever the cook was, they need to trek over to the Beaumont Texas Roadhouse and give them proper ""pinking"" lessons.   And the Piranha Pale Ale rocks! I've heard some say the menu here is too varied.   I say choices are good.     Definitely will return!"
Dennis W.,"Lexington, KY",246,163,626,2.0,7/15/2016,"Bland food and mediocre service earned this visit a 2-star rating. === === === === Out with friends, we were interested to try BJ's to socialize and get our grub on. As we arrived, the hostess greeted us and asked if we had ever been there before. Saying no, she explained that our server would tell us about their rewards program and take good care of us.  Unfortunately, neither of those things happened. I still couldn't tell you one thing about their reward program, as we were never told about it. Our server did, however, take our drink orders and give us time to look over the ridiculously large menu. We decided to order the honey sriracha brussel sprouts for an appetizer while we continued to look over the menu.  A good 8 minutes passed before we saw our server again. We made our orders, and thanked her with words and a smile - and she just stared at us and then walked away. Ok. A moment later, someone else brought us the appetizer. The sprouts were over-done and a bit bitter because of it.  Eventually, the main courses arrived and we dug in. My friend and I split a deep dish pizza. Sadly, pizza hut's deep dish is better than this was and that's even including the heartburn I get from pizza hut. This pizza was not hot, the crust was not crisp, and the toppings were few and far between. Clearly, whomever made this pizza hated pizza. Oh, and another thing that I am NOT a fan of is making the server serve the first slice. No, just no. She pulled up on a piece, that clearly wasn't fully sliced because it was stuck to the two adjacent pieces, until it gave way - which in turn, flipped one of the pieces upside down. Then she does the same thing trying to serve a piece to my friend. And then, she hovers over my food while she's trying to get the slice she accidentally flipped to flip back to a cheese-up position. What a mess.  I could continue, but I think if you're reading it this far that you get the point. ""Enjoy"" at your own risk."
Rob B.,"Lexington, KY",88,71,132,3.0,8/1/2016,"I have now tried BJ's three times and I have enjoyed the food on each of the visits. (Trip 1: Deep Dish Pizza and Calamari; Trip 2: Boneless wings appetizer and Salmon entree; Trip 3: Wedge Salad and Tavern Cut ""Spicy Pig"" Pizza.) I enjoyed the calamari and the portion size was definitely adequate. Their version of deep dish pizza was good but not the best I have ever had. The crust needs to be more crisp. But it   was not bad. The boneless wings with the lemon pepper dry-rub were good and also plentiful. The salmon was flaky and tender. On my third visit, I was OK with the food but the portions were paltry. The wedge salad was small. Most places seem to serve about a half head of lettuce with a wedge salad. BJ's wedge was about 1/4 head of lettuce--more like a ""kid's portion,"" but at $3.50 as an ""add on"" I wasn't totally disappointed. The Spicy Pig Pizza was good, but not ""wow."" ""Tavern cut"" is apparently a copyright's creation for thin crust. The crust was good but it was virtually impossible to tell if it had been sliced into slices so it became a ""pull apart"" situation which is somewhat of a problem with pizza toppings.  On Monday nights, BJ's pizza is half-price, so the pizza was $7.50 as opposed to $14.95. Based on the size, at $7.50 it was a good value---at $14.95 I would have sent it back and said ""no thanks."" It would barely feed two people and certainly not two hungry people. It is by no means worth $15. It is served in an oval and would average out to be about a ""medium"" at best. My overall reaction is that is overpriced, all things considered. Perhaps it is because of the rent being located at Fayette Mall, But no matter, if the food isn't improved for the price, it won't be difficult to get a seat there in due time. It is average food with an above average price. That doesn't bode well for the competitive Lexington dining scene. ""If you build it, they will come"" in Lexington, but if the food is just so-so, they generally won't return.  It's somewhere between Yelp's 2 and 3 stars in rating...about 2.5. But it is new and there is time to address some issues I have heard from friends who have also eaten there about their experience with slow service and incorrect orders. My experience on three trips is the service has been adequate. Your mileage may vary. I will say that their customer loyalty program does offer some good discounts. Hopefully they will step up their service and improve the food quality so that the Lexington location is as good as those in other cities."
Michelle R.,"Nicholasville, KY",24,130,302,3.0,8/11/2016,"This was out 1st visit to this BJ's. We had picked up a gift card at Kroger (gotta get those fuel points) for here because we knew we wanted to try it. The menu is spiral-bound and quite lengthy although many of the pages are drinks. The chain has their own beer line as well as their own line of sodas. They have a wide variety of food from pizzas and salads, to burgers and quinoa bowls. I had the lake and Brussel sprouts salad and added grilled chicken. The salad itself was outstanding and I loved the strawberry vinaigrette dressing. The only issue I had was that the chicken was extremely salty.  It was so salty that I picked it all off and didn't even eat it. When our server stopped by to check on our food, I asked him why the chicken was so salty and he said they must have put too much seasoning on it. He assured me that he would remove the chicken from our bill. When he returned, he said that the manager just removed the whole salad and not just the chicken. That was above and beyond as I ate the entire salad minus the chicken but I appreciate that they wanted to make sure we had a good experience. Okay so whatever you do, save room for dessert and get the Monkey Bread Pizookie. It is AWESOME! Our server told us that it's actually his 3rd favorite (the baked beignets being 2nd and the Oreo Pizookie being 1st) so we will have to try those also. I don't know that anything could top the Monkey Bread though.  I did only rate BJ's with 3 stars but the food was good (sans the chicken). The 3 was just due to the slow service. I'd give them 3.5 if it were an option."
Brianna M.,"Lexington, KY",113,70,48,3.0,7/11/2016,"*from the time we ordered to the time we got our food, roughly a little bit over an hour. Pro was that manager came over to offer us a free dessert for our wait.  * atmosphere is eh * food was okay, the strawberry mojitos were good. Overall nothing spectacular to report"
Faith C.,"Lexington, KY",145,62,242,4.0,1/21/2017,"First time here with a friend for lunch. I like the open space concept. Menu is vast but I decided to keep it simple. I ordered the Frozen Strawberry Splash. It was magically delicious! I paid more for that than my lunch choice of a grilled ham & cheese. Bread was very crusty but enjoyable. I substituted the fries for the white cheddar mashed potatoes. Potatoes were ok nothing overly exciting. My friend had a bacon burger with pulled pork she said it was hood. The best part for me outside of my drink was our server Heather-she was super attentive, friendly & knowledgeable! I'll definitely come back."
Charlie B.,"Lexington, KY",69,11,,5.0,9/17/2017,"The massive menu can be a overwhelming to navigate so here's my tried and true menu recommendations: App- Flatbread Nachos Salad- Mozzarella and Tomato Entree- Hickory Brisket Burger with sweet potato fries or the Double Bone in Pork Chop Dessert: The salted caramel pizookie is my go to. I would recommend calling ahead for seating on the weekends to shorten your wait time for a table, or making reservations if you have a large party. They also offer curbside service for takeout orders which makes it even more convenient, especially if you order through the app."
Allen W.,"Lexington, KY",66,13,97,5.0,6/10/2017,"BJs is a fun, vibrant restaurant grille and bar...... very family friendly........very busy at times    .. .. come early for dinner...has a great membership.....get App and checkin from the road to the waitlist   good steaks, craft adult beverages......"
Chuck G.,"Lexington, KY",0,45,20,4.0,5/8/2017,"We've been here twice and enjoyed the food both times.  To be nice, the food is much better than the service.  Both times our server was very slow getting back to the tables.  Empty glasses, for extended periods of time, are aggravating."
Della T.,"Louisville, KY",41,17,114,5.0,5/12/2017,"Was looking for a spot for pasta and landed here for lunch. Food and service was spot on. Super friendly staff and delicious food. Will definitely be back. I highly recommend trying this place at lunch, not nearly as crowded as dinner."
Dean P.,"Downtown, Los Angeles, CA",0,24,1,5.0,12/8/2017,Great pizza and great beer. They even have beer from other breweries including local micro-brews.
Don S.,"Lexington, KY",93,60,44,4.0,5/2/2017,"Good for a chain! Really good variety on the menu. The pizza is excellent and the healthy menu is awesome! Try the Quinoa bowl with Salmon! They have a great beer selection...and I LOVE beer! My advice is to avoid their in house brews...haven't found one that I like yet. Great for family, large groups, or a place to have a good lunch or dinner!"
Bailey T.,"Lexington, KY",105,3,1,5.0,9/10/2017,GREAT FOOD. The Jalapeño burger and the bacon-guacamole burger were amazing. The service was also great. Can't wait to go back and try more menu options!
Miranda H.,"Lexington, KY",364,27,86,4.0,1/24/2017,"Sat at the bar and the staff was incredibly knowledgable and friendly! Had the Estancia Cab which was excellent. The staff knew the menu and were quick to start easy conversation. I even got to chat with them about there community service work which was very cool! Discussed my absolute love of the Honey Sriracha Brussels Sprouts! A MUST try! The Santa Fe salad is also really good and a large portion with enough to take home. I've also been here with big groups which they could easily accommodate. The only reason this is not a five is due to it being at a busy road which is Nicholasville Road and near Fayette Mall which can be very congested. Otherwise I'm a big fan. It's a large open space with lots of different beers and plenty of seating.  Also found a variety of food on the menu that can suit everyone in your family. This place is great for cocktails, a date or for family."
Sarah M.,"Lexington, KY",209,407,2016,5.0,8/2/2016,"So happy to see one of these in Lexington now. We were told they'd be a 90 wait when we went on Saturday and it was probably about 45 minutes which I didn't think was bad. They were SUPER packed. They had an appetizer or pazookie special with a coupon so we had to take advantage of the chicken pot stickers (super good). We then ordered our entree. I had the beer batter fish and fries. Very good, but so much food. Nothing tops their pizza in my opinion regardless of what else I've tried on the menu. Then we split the cookies and cream pazookie which I have to give two thumbs up. Considering it's still a new restaurant be prepared to wait for a table but I believe it's pretty well worth it."
Merritt W.,"Tomisato, Japan",18,32,124,4.0,1/18/2017,"I happened to like this place a great deal. Hey have a hefty selection of items and food choices to satisfy most diets. They have a good beer selection that comprise of the usual domestics plus their own brand that is brewed off site. I like to see the tanks and stuff that are ""supposed"" to be at brew houses - but I got over it.  Food quality is good and my waitress was very accommodating and knowledgeable about the offerings in the menu. There are a lot of things, almost like a Cheesecake Factory menu, so it can be a little daunting if it is your first time there.  Is it expensive? Yeah, kinda sorta I suppose, but this isn't Applebee's or O'Charley's. It's a step above and priced accordingly I feel. You could definitely drop $60-80 on a dinner date with appetizer, drinks, dinner and dessert.  A lot of reviews will complain about the speed and/or quality of service. While I didn't personally experience poor or slow performance I can see how one could given the size of the establishment and seating. I personally wouldn't sit and wait an extraordinary amount of time to eat some place, and would simply move on to another place and give it a try some other time."
Micah C.,"Richmond, KY",0,3,,1.0,11/12/2017,"Beyond disappointed with a recent visit. I dined in over the weekend due to a Veterans Day special. Not only did the food take well over an hour but the servers seemed to get no help. Very rarely have i ever had the same server. Turn over rate would be my assumption. My girlfriend and I were very patient due to being in the service industry in the past. Appetizer took 25 minutes. I may not be a cook but a pepperoni flatbread shouldn't take that long. Frozen pizzas do not even take that long. I never asked for my server to get a manager or threaten for one, however one stopped by to ask how I was enjoying my food. Clearly she could tell there was some agitation, instead of going straight back to the kitchen to check on the meal, this woman marched up to my server and got after her for not knowing what was going on with my food. Never ever should you talk down to your employees, she was rude and demeaning. Another manager was sent to my table and left me her name, liz. Neither manager seemed to even be concerned even after my food was received. Both female managers who stopped by couldn't even look me in the eye and didn't seem to care. The food was sloppily made and it looked as if my girlfriends food had been cooked under the lamp. My server was not even the one that dropped the food off and even she was disgusted as to how it came out. I later found out that the other managers name was le Anne. I am beyond disgusted with how I was treated on Veterans Day. This was not just a day to make big sales. never will I set foot in this establishment until things change. My entire unit will be notified to not dine there as well as Toyota staff. I am beyond sorry for people working under both these disrespectful women. As well as people dining in, food quality was a disgrace. Management should be checking that. I'm posting this because how how disgraceful this place is. I actually hope something is done."
Robert C.,"Fort Mill, SC",115,18,34,4.0,5/6/2017,Late night meal after the derby. For a busy weekend service was good. The deep dish pizza Wes very good and so was the rest of the food we ordered. Good place to visit if your in town. Dessert was really good
Brandy C.,"Georgetown, KY",18,17,57,4.0,11/29/2016,"A great place for a lunch date with my dad, step-mom and hubby. None of them had been before and all seemed more than please with their food choice. Prices are a little bit on the expensive side for lunch time but the portions are huge!! A take-out box is a must."
Kat R.,"Salisbury, NC",0,3,,3.0,7/5/2017,"I commented to a friend that works here that they have as big a menu as that place that sells cheesecake. She said they have over 260 items, but BJs only has 160 or so. Still that's a lot to pick from. I had the half-rack of ribs with baked potato. Ribs were tender and the sauce was good. They weren't all slathered in sauce either, which is how I like it. The baked potato was just that, your basic baked potato. There was no salt on the skin and it was almost as if it had been steam cooked rather than baked. Asked for butter and sour cream and got a small ramekin with butter and a splat of sour cream on top of the butter. Atmosphere is nice, but can be noisy when it gets crowded. I guess the majority of people go there for the beers. Not a beer drinker, so my frequency at this restaurant will be limited."
Tehya B.,"Lexington, KY",14,6,,2.0,7/28/2017,"This is one of my favorite restaurants. However, I was really disappointed with this particular location. The wait staff SUCKS. Not very good customer service. Very reluctant on redeeming your premier rewards. Management acts like total pricks. One day my husband even noticed someone used 250 points from our rewards at this location and it could have only been an employee. He spoke with management and they said there was nothing they could do and to just take it up with corporate. We got our points back but who is to say this idiot wouldn't try to use our points again. 2 stars just because i love this restaurant, 0 stars for this location as a whole."
