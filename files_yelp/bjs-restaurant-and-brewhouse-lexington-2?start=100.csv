Rhonda S.,"Lexington, KY",0,1,,1.0,7/30/2016,"Got there at 5pm on a Saturday. They said 50 min for a table, we waited for over an hour. Once we got our table service was sluggish. Took about 45 min to get our food from the time that we ordered. Then one order was wrong (they said so before they even brought it out) so we had to wait for them to remake it. Plus once we got our food had to wait about 10 min longer for missing utensils and condiments and drink refills. The food is fine, not spectacular but the service is so bad I will not go back. I had to fetch several things for our table myself (kids menu, salt, and snagged another server for things I couldn't get myself).  Definitely not worth the wait."
Heather H.,"Paris, KY",0,13,21,3.0,8/23/2016,"Had dinner here Sunday with 2 other couples. It's wasn't busy, we only waited 20 mins for a table. 2 of the people in our group ordered the Late Night Burger and weren't told until 15 mins after we ordered that they didn't have eggs for the burgers.  After that we waited 45 mins after ordering to get our food brought to the table. I waited 50. They brought everyone but mine but never explained why I had the extra delay. Our waiter NEVER once refilled our glasses unless we asked. He only brought me one drink in 2 hours and never offered to bring another. The kitchen staff were extremely slow and I found it to be poor service that the manager didn't offer to explain the situation with the eggs or even send out to somewhere close and get them. The burger was listed 1st page of the menu and was also listed as their specialty item so it was kinda a big deal. Really enjoyed the food but probably won't go back until next year. Maybe they will have their shit together then."
D M.,"Lexington, KY",0,12,2,1.0,7/25/2016,"We went to this place last night and I thought it was horrible. Calamari was not good at all to start. My pizza was just average and it did not have any sauce. One of the people in my group got fish tacos and they tasted real fishy. And one burger cooked wrong, cold fri's, and bacon was way undercooked. We also had the cookies and they were small and not much to them. Two other meals were just ok.  I will not return to this place I would have a hard time giving this place a one star. Waitress was very nice and friendly is the one good part other then I like the way the restaurant was set up on the inside."
Mike M.,"Lexington, KY",0,6,4,5.0,7/13/2016,Been there twice. Both times food was excellent. Wait was long but can be expected with a new place
Sarah H.,"Louisville, KY",0,37,,1.0,7/4/2016,"Don't go! Service was horrible aside from ""being out"" of so many things. They were out of pizza, etc. (had a long list they carried around of all the beers and food they didnt have). The waitress said the ""truck got lost."" The second time we discussed the ""bad day"" attributed to the lack of food available, the waitress said the truck ""broke down."" Ive been to bj's in texas; no comparison! They've been open 5 days in Lex. It is an absolute epic fail! Took over 35 minutes for me to get water to drink. This is worse than ""just a few kinks."" The issues pertain to poor training and poor management! So many orders were wrong! The manager walked around apologizing to people. I feel its a lack of preparation, planning, and poor communication. It seems the day shift is worse than the evening shift! Evening shift seems a little more experienced."
