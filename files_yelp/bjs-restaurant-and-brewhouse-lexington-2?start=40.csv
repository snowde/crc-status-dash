Cynthia B.,"Jackson, KY",0,1,,5.0,5/10/2017,Great club sandwich. Filled with my favorites. Prime rib sandwich was awesome too. The horseradish sauce could be a little spicer. Will definitely go back.
Mike E.,"Pearland, TX",0,4,1,5.0,9/14/2017,This is my favorite place. Great food and the pizza is to die for.  Managers are friendly and will help you out if anything goes wrong. Service is very friendly.
Amanda H.,"Lexington, KY",3,54,27,4.0,11/27/2016,We have been here a few times and enjoyed the food and service. I like that they have shoestring fries. I also really like their chicken Cobb salad- the dressing has a really good herby flavor and it is huge! My husband loves their tavern style pizza. On our last visit we also had the trio of mini pazookis- they were very good! We will be going back again soon.
Katie F.,"Lexington, KY",11,100,346,4.0,6/29/2016,"BJs Brewhouse is where it's at! I have been to another location in Indiana and it never fails! Probably one of my top 5 favorite chains here in Lexington! BJs' menu offers a wide variety of selection and has a wonderful ""EnLIGHTened"" menu with items under 750 calories. I would say their menu selection is almost comparable to the Cheesecake Factory in that there's something for every taste bud. In fact, the menu can *almost* be a tad overwhelming, simply because of how many things that are offered!  The atmosphere is a little industrial inside and has a fun/nice feel. This is a place you can dress up or dress down and feel comfortable!  One negative is the prices. I would say BJs is on the higher end, price wise, and wish it was a little less expensive.  My husband and I went on opening night and I expected it to be a little hectic. Our waitress was super friendly and helpful but they did mess up our pazookie order (PS you HAVE to get a pazookie!!!!). She said she would give us a coupon for a free one and ended up forgetting, I think. They gave it to us in a ""to go"" container, even though we didn't ask for it like that, and I think we got a smaller size which was really disappointing. Again, this was on the opening night so I do have a little more grace, given the craziness!  Oh, one more thing- I wish they had outdoor seating! The other location I've been to has a really nice area for sitting outside and I love to eat outside so that was a little disappointing.  I will definitely go again, and go frequently!! I'm so glad Lexington finally got a BJs Restaurant and Brewhouse!!"
David S.,"Lexington, KY",116,7,,2.0,9/25/2016,"We were hoping to find a new regular place in the neighborhood but our first visit will be our last. A wide assortment of tasty food was available however the menu may not be suited to those on a high protein diet as protein portions were small (3.5-4oz) on many dishes esp. the salads. Additional portions were not well priced. No one wants to pay $20+ for a salad at a burger place.  To be charitable, service was lacking. While being nice and friendly goes a long way, being wholly inattentive does not. BTW for a restaurant calling itself a brew house, I found it ironic that our server never brought my beer order. I had to request the charge be available removed. BJ's blew it!"
Ralph G.,"Lexington, KY",39,6,,1.0,5/7/2017,"I waited a couple of months to try this place out so the rush would die down. We went and had to wait an hour for a table. Not bad if it's a good restaurant. The food is decent nothing to brag about. There is nothing that had the wow factor, everything is just Mediocre. I had asparagus that I could not even bite through with a pork chop that was ok.   So with that said this was the first and last time I will go there."
Becky R.,"Lexington, KY",123,2,,1.0,9/14/2016,"I was excited to finally have the opportunity to try out the new restaurant in town BJ's Brewhouse. It was built right by the mall on the corner of a large intersection and so I anticipated that it was going to be a popular dining spot. So when I went to dinner there I had relatively high expectations because of its size, location, and style of restaurant. I figured it had to be really good from the looks of it. I walked in on a weeknight and was quoted a 15-20 minute wait time. They asked for my number and told me to anticipate a text when our table was ready. So after 35 minutes of waiting and checking my phone and listening for my name to be called I was becoming more and more hungry and anxious. I went up to ask the hosts about the wait and they had nothing to say about it but that our table would be ready soon. So after a 45-minute wait (twice the time we were told) we sat down. We were relieved to finally have our table and were prepared for the rest of the night to be enjoyable. We were eager to order but the menu was large so we ordered drinks before ordering our food. But our waiter was less than enthusiastic about helping us explore the menu and stopped by to ask us for our order twice before our drinks were even brought to the table.  After we ordered our food, it was another long time waiting for it to come out, but we didn't really mind it; we were enjoying our time and our drinks. So when the food was finally brought out we were hungry and excited to dig in. But before either of us had taken a bite of our food our waiter came around the corner over to our table and asked us if we wanted dessert! We hadn't even started eating yet after waiting for our meal for well over an hour now and he was asking us about dessert! We told him we weren't ready to look at desserts and he walked off. A few minutes later he came back and asked us if we wanted boxes. We were still not even halfway through our meal. At this point I started becoming irritated. Before now it was just a time issue that I would have overlooked because the food was worth the wait. But now I was being rushed and interrupted after waiting for so long to get my food. I can't recall worse service in a restaurant. I am not the type to let a flaw in service ruin my entire experience but this lack of good service was appalling. I simply expected a positive experience with trying out this restaurant for the first time and the service I received was far from that. Not only were the wait times given to us incorrect and irritating, but also the waiter rushing us out the door was downright frustrating.  I would recommend this restaurant to put a heavier focus on how they treat their customers and how their services are executed. A customer should be treated with respect and employees should be trained appropriately to serve them efficiently and without rudely pushing them out the door.  I also recommend that the hosts never quote under the actual wait time. A customer quoted longer wait times will be less irritated when their wait time is shorter than they are told. But if a customer is told a short wait time they become irritated when that time is extended to being twice as long.  If BJ's values having its business become successful in Lexington they will need to look into making changes. Because from my experience the rude and poor service is not worth the wait and I will probably not give them my business again."
Shelly G.,"Nicholasville, KY",71,24,,3.0,9/11/2016,"It was ok. Just ok. Nothing fancy,  higher prices than Applebees or places like that. I got a burger and fries. It has no condiments. I finally waved someone down for some. Hubby had the baked ziti. He liked it ok. Again,  nothing fancy.  All the servers looked miserable.  The hostess had the personality of a rock."
Katherine B.,"Lexington, KY",1,22,,1.0,7/24/2017,"First time we went was two weeks after opening. Sure- our fault. They got 2/3 orders wrong (like brought completely different dish for one, and got most details wrong in the second) and was hella expensive. Didn't hold it against them though cause it was new. We went about 3 months later, got some drinks (tasty, but expensive even at happy hour) and our food was disappointing. Very expensive for same quality food you find at a much lower quality restaurant. Service is always extremely slow and poor. Won't be back."
Mary F.,"Richmond, KY",1,3,,4.0,6/12/2017,"Service was excellent. Sat at the bar, bartender was extremely knowledgeable and helpful. We ordered 3 appetizers to munch on. None were great. Wings were not cooked enough, calamari was flavorless, and nachos were mediocre. Maybe if they limited their menu a little, it would help."
Tonya M.,"Lexington, KY",26,20,4,2.0,6/10/2017,Waited forever for our food and once it came it was cold and just generally not tasty. This was our second time here and will be our last.
Carlos H.,"Lexington, KY",8,40,,1.0,8/5/2016,"I thought it would be fun to take my wife here for lunch before we saw the latest Jason Bourne film. We arrived at the restaurant and were seated at about 12:15 p.m. We waited for 5 minutes before our waiter appeared for the first time, and we gave him our drink and food orders. Twenty minutes after we gave him our food orders, food finally arrived. The waiter was MIA for most of the 45 minutes we were at our table. Unfortunately, this was some of the worst food I've had at a Lexington restaurant in YEARS. Trust me, by late November, holiday shoppers will wish Fayette Mall had not eliminated more parking spaces by adding this restaurant. For starters, the list of items on the menu is far too large, and it's never a good sign when one restaurant tries to tackle tacos, pizza, hamburgers, and several other kinds of food. Also, there are at least two items on the menu with the same name (The Classic -- one is a sandwich and the other is a baked potato). My wife ordered The Classic, thinking she was getting the sandwich with a salad. Instead, the waiter brought the baked potato and the salad appeared much later after that. Wendy's baked potato is just as good as the one my wife had at this restaurant. Her salad, while it looked fresh, was drenched in dressing. At least her meal turned out to be free. While the menu states that many of the hamburgers include a special sauce, my hamburger was not supposed to but did anyway. The hamburger itself was almost as thin as a McDonald's hamburger, it tasted gross, and it's been giving me digestive problems for the last 18 hours. The French fries are the kind Steak and Shake serve, and they have no flavor/seasoning. AVOID THIS RESTAURANT. At least the new Jason Bourne film was outstanding!"
Holly F.,"Lexington, KY",6,15,,1.0,8/1/2016,"Used the mobile check in which turned out to be worthless. Checked in via the app and it said it would be a 45 minute wait but once we arrived we still had to wait for another 45 minutes.  Drinks took forever to arrive, if they arrived at all. Appetizers came out quickly but dinner took quite a while longer. And, once it arrived, it was either cold or incorrect. Just really disappointed with the service and the quality...especially for the price!  What should have been a fun dinner was an over three hour miserable experience."
Sticki B.,"Frankfort, KY",0,1,,5.0,4/22/2017,This was great from the avacodo rolls to the Oreo piezookie... Justin the waiter was awesome! Loved using the App too. They passed samples of deep dish pizza and it was Delish!
AJ M.,"Lexington, KY",95,13,5,1.0,1/31/2017,"Been here twice, once for dinner, once just for drinks, they didn't know their own menu or how to make us the appetizer we ordered, brought out the wrong thing twice, and the food was awful, drinks come from a premade mix you can buy at Walmart, so it's all syrup with a shot of liquor in it... atmosphere is nice, unfortunately because of their location they'll probably stay open for longer than they should"
Shannon B.,"Winchester, KY",1,5,1,4.0,11/21/2016,My husband and I went on Sunday afternoon for the first time. We were seated quickly. Very friendly staff and service was great. My husband's drink was not right but they fixed it with no problem. Food was great and I can't say this enough.. I loved the look.. Very awesome!
Brittney E.,"Lexington, KY",220,178,166,5.0,8/20/2016,"What I like the most about this place is the extensive menu that includes not only a great selection of pizzas, burgers and other things you would expect to find in a sports bar, but also a wide variety of healthy and unique options. There are so many great small plates and salads available and even quinoa bowls. The quinoa bowl is amazing and I also recommend the flatbreads and brussel sprouts. They pretty much have every appetizer I've ever wanted all in one place. You can also find some great drink options."
Jaclyn G.,"Lexington, KY",127,35,12,4.0,1/10/2017,"Great happy hour and food.  I enjoy their flatbreads, guacamole and deep dish pizzas.  I've always had good experiences here except for the time I asked for San Pelligrino and the waitress immediately said they didn't have it - when I was looking right at it on the menu.  The very same night my friend ordered a specific beer that, again, was listed on the menu and the waitress immediately said they didn't have that either.  What the heck - know what's on the menu or at least say, ""let me check""."
Gerrad M.,"Waldorf, MD",37,8,1,3.0,3/4/2017,A little slow and watch out for those flying elbows. Nice and clean with a friendly staff but once again watch out for large elbows.
Jessica W.,"Temple, GA",67,44,125,5.0,1/18/2017,"This place was great for lunch! The menu is large, so prepare yourself to flip through some pages. Their menu provides different types of entrees, according to your diet there is something for everyone. The menu is pricey, but well worth it. I would not recommend dinning in for dinner, just because of the wait. This place can get very busy."
