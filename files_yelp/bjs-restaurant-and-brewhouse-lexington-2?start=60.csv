Jared S.,"Lexington, KY",57,13,,5.0,10/25/2016,"There is only one way to describe BJ's and that is the bomb.  If you can't find something from this comprehensive menu to order you need to go elsewhere. They have pizza, pasta, salads, burgers, unique entrées, and craft drafted sodas and beers you can't find anywhere else. Service is great even when exceptionally slammed, and even on a wait.  Prices are fair and you can even order to go, something we need to try. During football season or not, Saturdays and Sundays are nuts, so come during an off time.  Trying anything and everything from the menu and you will be impressed, truly one of my favorite places in town for Americana order just watching a sporting event."
Michael D.,"Parksville, KY",0,15,,3.0,9/9/2016,"Stopped here for lunch, as I thought it was a branch of a similarly-named restaurant an hour west of here, but we were not totally disappointed.  Looking over the menu, we did find the prices somewhat expensive -- not the place one would go on a regular basis, really. We ordered the 9"" Mediterranean pizza and can honestly say it was the best pizza I've ever had.  The combination of about 6 different toppings from excellent feta cheese to olives and fresh tomato left a pleasant taste in my mouth for hours.  The pain will come when the credit card bill arrives.  But it really was worth the price. We both had a beer, my friend had a hefeweisse and I had a local brew.  I found that the local brew was probably twice as expensive as I expected, as I don't check beer prices regularly.  It was good, but it wasn't THAT good.  But the pizza.  Yes, the pizza! In all honesty, I can't say I'd come back here often.  Each time we go to Lexington (live an hour away) we try a new place, anyway.  Today was BJ's turn.  Can't say I was disappointed overall, but will not be a regular. After reading other reviews, I have to add that service was very good, fast, efficient, and our server came back to check on us several times. But you MUST try the Mediterranean pizza!"
Jessica O.,"Lexington, KY",0,3,,4.0,2/22/2017,"I've been here on multiple occasions, with family, friends and coworkers. Went with my husband today and was very disappointed. Purchased the calamari, which is something we always order. This time it seemed to be undercooked. Other than this one incident we are very pleased with BJ Brewhouse."
Jason B.,"Lexington, KY",1,12,3,3.0,7/27/2016,"Deep dish pizza worth trying, but nothing that will blow you away. As far as the pizza and beer goes, this place was pretty good overall. They were pretty skimpy with the cheese and toppings, so I can't rate it higher for the price. The service was fairly bad, as they forgot part of the order and took quite a while to even greet us. However, everyone was friendly and I have had much worse service, so not a huge deal. The house beer is good and worth trying. Skip the shareable appetizers. We got the pot stickers and there were 6 I think for almost $10. That would be probably $5 anywhere else, and they were nothing special. Although we didn't get it, the spinach and artichoke dip was also almost $10, which is ridiculous unless it comes in a trough. I would give it another chance since it just opened and my complaints might be fixed when it gets rolling. I would say the pizza is a notch better than Old Chicago, but the value is worse, and the service was worse."
Tina L.,"Lexington, KY",1,100,240,1.0,7/19/2016,Service was a bit chaotic and it took 3 times to get my husbands steak correct. We didnt have to wait long for a table which was good. We did have to wait for refills longer than expected.
J K.,"Lexington-Fayette, KY",1,10,,4.0,7/11/2016,"Just open two weeks. The staff did a great job and the food was very good. We had hot boneless wings and Caprese salad as appetizers.  Two adults had salads for the main and the teenager had the bacon, bbq brisket burger. Everybody says they will go back!!"
Jessie A.,"Henrico, VA",0,3,,2.0,10/10/2016,"This place is pretty awful. I have never seen a restaurant so slow and indifferent. We showed up for a friend's bday dinner around 3PM Saturday. The mall had some sort of power problem which, I know can't really be helped. But the way the restaurant handled this situation was horrible. When we walked up to the door we were met by a host with a bad attitude. She pretty much looked at us and said she couldn't let us in because there was no power. Okay, fine but did she have to be so rude with her tone? Of course not. Little did I know this is just how this restaurant is run.  The power came back on about 30 minutes later. We walked in to be met with a bunch of servers. We were told it would be 20 minutes until we could get a table. WHY? All the tables were empty yet we were only allowed to sit in the bar area. Again, WHY? What would have been the harm in letting customers sit at the actual tables? The power was on and everything was working. So odd. At this point I didn't even really know if I wanted to eat at this place. It is obviously poorly ran. After sitting on one the benches in the front for like 10 minutes we finally decided to sit at the bar. The bar area is cramped, not cool.  We sat waiting for like 15 minutes for our server to come up and grace us with his unfriendly presence. He didn't tell us his name. Didn't tell us ANYTHING about the drinks or food they had to offer. WTF? This is honestly the first time that has happened to me. He took our drink order and disappeared for 20 more minutes. At this point we practically live at this place now. There was a UK game on like 10 different TVs. So, I'll take this opportunity to congratulate  BJ's on having enough TVs for a small village.  Anyway, the server came back. Gave us our drinks. Well, half of us anyway. My husband didn't get his beers for another like 10 minutes. At this point we don't have actual menus and our server disappeared again. We had to get up and ask for menus. They didn't even have enough for our table. Did the menus leave when the power went out? We will never know.  Now on to the food and the menu. I've watched enough Gordon Ramsay content to know that he would absolutely die over the size of BJ's menu. Okay, it's fancy looking. I mean it's in a spiral book. There are literally like 20 pages. That is TOO MUCH. You know what else was too much? The prices. Who in their right mind wants to pay almost 10 dollars for like 5 brussels sprouts with some sriracha on them? We were taken aback by the prices but at this point we felt like the band on the Titanic. We were going to ride this ship down. Once our server decided that we might want to eat some time before death happened he came over and once again didn't tell us anything about the menu, specials, nothing. We ordered our food and then began the wait.  The food took about 25 minutes to come out. It didn't come out all at once. In the restaurant world you want your tables food to come out all at the same time. I got the mozzarella and tomato salad. It tasted fabulous. So, way to go on that! Everyone seemed to like the food. So I can't say anything bad about the actual food. Presentation was great, quality was great, portions were great for filling your tummy (but I'm not going to praise those prices, still too much). The ONLY complaint I do have is that the server didn't give refills. No one was surprised by this at this point.  The server gave us our checks, well kinda threw the books on the table and walked off. We all paid with cash so as we were gathering the money together the server was creeping. One of my party members went out to smoke. I was waiting for him to come back to give his portion of the bill. The server would NOT stop trying to take the check. I told him I was waiting for another person to chip in. He was in some sort of hurry to get that money. Oh, so now you're speedy? He also stood around obviously trying to see what his tip was going to look like. Most annoying server EVER.  Needless to say I'm not going back to this place. I don't know WTF is wrong with the managers here but they must not know what they are doing. I honestly thought it was because of the power outage but the other reviews here sound similar enough to my own experience that it's kinda obvious this place has major problems. It's in such a good location in Lexington. It's a shame it probably won't survive. The building looks very nice but appearances do not go very far when the servers seem unfriendly and brain dead and the service is so slow you start to seriously think about leaving.  Get it together, BJ's!"
Dave N.,"Nicholasville, KY",3,16,,3.0,12/7/2016,Been here a couple of times better the first time than the second one. Pretty loud. Lot's of running around that makes everything lot busy but slow to get you your food. Food ok for the price. I'll give it another try
Terry E.,"Lexington, KY",58,13,18,5.0,11/3/2016,Love the space! Large room noise is controlled. Good looking bar area. Clean restrooms. Huge menus choices. Tasty foods. Clam chowder bowl really nice. Good ham and cheese.
Shelley D.,"Lexington, KY",0,5,,4.0,1/15/2017,"Try the New Orleans Jambalaya!  We typically sit in the bar area, and the service has always been great.  Entree prices are a little high, but Happy Hour helps!"
Elizabeth S.,"Lexington, KY",5,8,10,1.0,9/5/2016,"I know it was a holiday, but my husband and I were hoping for a quick decent meal for lunch! It took over one hour from the time we sat down until we were brought our food. Then another 20 minutes waiting on our check. Food was simply okay. I probably won't return with so many other better options close by!"
Blake A.,"Berlin Center, OH",330,14,,3.0,1/7/2017,"Decent but slightly over priced. The menus are kinda hard to follow because they are so overwhelmed by pictures. However, they have a fantastic beer selection! Give it a try if you are by the mall."
Jess N.,"Versailles, KY",42,72,282,3.0,10/15/2016,"Meh.  Nothing to write home about. Beer is ok, food is kind of bland. We tried it because pies and pints was swamped. The best part was the bignet dessert. Service was fine but we were at the high tops at the bar so we're constantly bumped onto. Not my scene won't be back as there are just too many good restaurants here to eat Meh food."
Wes C.,"Lexington, KY",30,104,533,2.0,8/7/2016,"The Good: unique beers only found at their restaurants, decent food. The Bad:  wait for the food, staff that were slacking, hot wings, wait for beer, staff who have no personality and do not follow the norms of being a server. The Rundown:  this is a chain that is new here to Lexington and I have to say I will not be back after only one visit.  Their beer selection while decent and varied, even offer some of their own unique selection took a full 20 minutes to come out after ordering.  Our appetizer of their boneless wings took another 10 minutes.  We ordered their spicy and hot, and their exxxxtra hot.  Literally I couldn't tell the difference in heat level.  I will say the exxxxtra hot tasted better.  Worse about their wings was the egregious under saucing, they came out looking dry.  Also, apparently if you ask for blue cheese you get ranch, and you won't be able to switch it out because your server won't come to check on you.  We also got a deep dish pizza, which was as good as a delivery version, and a brisket bacon BBQ burger.  These two items were the saving grace of this place.  The wait staff could be seen hanging around, sitting in booths with customers or chit chatting with each other, this leads me to wonder why is my food and drink taking so long when they apparently have nothing to do? The Impression: Applebee's is better, they at least get you your cheap food within a timely manner and check on you to make sure they didn't screw something up.  This place needs some serious work on training their employees and working on efficiency and customer service."
Jane E.,"Lexington, KY",0,1,,1.0,9/14/2016,Would not ever go back if left up to me but my children like the place. We have been there twice the dessert we wanted was not available either night after being told it was so great. The manager had told me she would comp another dessert on the first visit that didn't happen.  Last night they had ran out of thin pizza dough at 7:30. My son got the deep dish pizza by default it was cold. Service is extremely slow. I had to ask for silverware the floors are a disaster waiting to happen amazed people are falling all over the place. On the positive side my daughter liked her burger.
Larry S.,"Frankfort, KY",9,12,,1.0,9/4/2016,I have been there twice with friends and have been thoroughly disappointed. The service was terrible and the food worse. Typically when a new franchise in a restaurant chain opened an experienced set crew spends several weeks training and oversees operation. Either the set crew didn't show up or it is one of the worst in the business. Both times our meal nearly two hours from the time we were seated to the time we paid our check. The problem is the kitchen and the management. I expected a higher quality of service similar to that of other BJ'S where I have dined.
Suzanne H.,"Lexington, KY",48,23,5,3.0,10/2/2016,"I was so excited when I saw BJs was coming to town. I used to live in Dallas and used to go to this restaurant all the time. But I was so disappointed they didn't have the pasta I used to enjoy so much. It was healthy and delicious. I have since found a couple of items that I have enjoyed there now: their Poke appetizer and the Strawberry salad is very good. But I will say it's not enough to keep me going there as much as before. They are pricier than restaurants that are like them; so I don't think they will be around very long. I will say, that if I had to eat at the mall, that would be the best place. So, they're better than PF Changs, Olive Garden, Travania, and Cheesecake Factory."
Brian J.,"Richmond, KY",0,6,1,2.0,5/5/2017,"The beer is good but the food is mediocre, especially for the price. The service was not very good either but I'd give them a pass on that since it was essentially a holiday weekend (Friday night before Derby) and the place was fairly full. They have a large menu kinda like Cheesecake Factory, and for me that is a red flag that means so many choices but none of them great, which actually turned out to be true.  I ordered the deep dish baked ziti ($15) that is supposed to have pepperoni, meatballs, and sausage in it. It was a small portion size as the pan they baked it in and served it in was only about half full and there was 0 pepperoni and only a small amount of sausage and meatball. So I felt that $15 was a bit much to ask for a small, non deep pan of pasta with cheese and sauce on it.  I did see many burgers being served at other tables and those did look good. If I try it again maybe it would be best to stick to burgers and beer, but I really don't need another burger joint so I probably would not return."
Genna F.,"Murray, KY",5,15,,2.0,10/8/2016,"Are you flipping kidding me?!?? The food I ordered was actually really good. Unfortunately, the power went out in the middle of our meal. With the power outage, the exhaust fans went out as well. The restaurant quickly became smokey. I had to beg to get water because apparently I couldn't get a soda related to the power outage. We never got an apology & got charged full price, including $3.00 sodas. None of the staff seemed concerned customers were choking or having trouble related to the smoke. We will not be back. Again, the food was good, but with ignorant staff that isn't concerned with customer service, I see no need for this business to receive any more of my money."
Mandy V.,"Danville, KY",22,12,7,1.0,4/1/2017,"I wanted to like this place and have been eager to make it by since it opened. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. The menu looked quite extensive, but also expensive (for this type of restaurant), especially for the portion sizes. I ordered the top sirloin steak which the menu  did not list a weight for the steak, but I figured at $15.99 it had to be at least the standard 8 oz. Maybe it was the fact that the last quarter of my steak was an inedible stringy mess, but the steak did not seem of adequate size. The side items I chose were the house salad and white cheddar mashed potatoes. The salad was a standard mix of greens (iceberg and romaine) , tomatoes, cucumbers, and croutons, and sadly ended up being the best part of the meal. The potatoes came out in the shape of an ice cream scoop, reminiscent of cafeteria food, and had dried out terribly. I'm a big girl, I like to eat, and I hate wasting food, but I couldn't even finish my meal. As far as service goes, our waitress was nice enough but visits were few and far between, and the place wasn't busy at all. Maybe this is the place to go for craft beers and bar snacks, but leave the steak cooking to steakhouses."
