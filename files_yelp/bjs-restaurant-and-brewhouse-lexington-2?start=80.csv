S A.,"St. Charles, MO",0,14,,3.0,3/26/2017,"Food was great, large selection. Beer was tasty. Pizookie was awesome, shared the trio. They were out of a few flavors which was disappointing. Service was great at first and then she vanished and we had to wait quite a while."
Marcus R.,"Lexington, KY",3,28,1,3.0,8/15/2016,Good choice of different beers if that's what you like.  But beer is way over priced.  We didn't get pizza which I guess is their thing.  Burger and ribs.  Both were fine nothing to brag about.  But are end ticket was way higher than I would have ever imagined even with ordering ribs.  Cheapest beer we had was bluemoon at 6.25 a pint.  All the other beers were7.50 plus a pint.  Rip off don't care how local or craft it is.
Dana B.,"Lexington, KY",95,1,,5.0,7/6/2016,Awesome food and service.. Super busy place but Manager LeeAnn Musgove visited our table and was amazing! Highly recommend this place especially because of LeeAnn!
Hope B.,"Headley Green, Lexington, KY",25,3,,1.0,5/10/2017,"Very disappointed. We had been there 2 times previously and had great experience. Went this Saturday, found a hair in my salad and got cold sides with my steak.  Attempted to complain manager but too busy."
Tori S.,"Gainesway, Lexington, KY",48,27,,2.0,4/19/2017,I've eat here twice and it's less than memorable. The atmosphere is cool and location is great but the food is lacking. I would stick to drinks and an appetizer or desert if coming here.
Mya P.,"Lexington, KY",265,5,,1.0,7/9/2016,Took forever to get a drink order and even longer for the food. The fries were so burnt they hurt to try to chew and the boneless wings taste about as good as pre-cooked off brand out the microwave very disappointed. Hopefully the awesome manager will get it all turned around.
Jenny E.,"Lexington, KY",8,1,,2.0,7/4/2016,"We love BJ's but the new location in Lexington definitely needs some time to get their kinks worked out. For a party of four, we were there for two hours for lunch. It took a loooooong time to get food. We'll go again but not for several months to allow their service to improve."
Mark F.,"Gaslamp, San Diego, CA",0,11,,2.0,7/6/2016,"Drinks are good, but food is slow and average. Don't order the brussel sprouts - you only get about 5!"
Melanie H.,"Stanford, KY",50,2,,1.0,3/11/2017,Expensive for the portions and nothing to rave about. Meh at best.  Would have rather had a Hardee's burger.
Wesam S.,"Lexington, KY",14,2,,1.0,8/19/2016,"This is the worst restaurant anyone could ever go to!! They will tell you there's a 25 minute wait. 25 minutes later, they will tell you another hour. And the food is disgusting. IF YOU WANT TO WASTE MONEY ON THIS PIECE OF CRAP PLACE, GO FOR IT, BUT YOU ARE WASTING YOUR TIME AND MONEY!"
Kelsey C.,"Merritt Island, FL",0,10,,3.0,8/20/2016,"Food was good (I had the tomato soup and grilled cheese)  and the beer selection is great.  My fiancé loves to try new beers and when they are on tap,  that's a plus.  It seemed like it took forever to finally get our food.  They text you if there is a wait."
David T.,"Lexington, KY",39,4,1,1.0,8/22/2016,"Ordered the sliders which are suppose to be ""four beef patties on miniture buns with grilled onions, lettuce, pickles and ketchup."" What they served was a small hamburger ripped in to four pieces on muniture buns. The pickles were bigger than the burger chunks. Very disappointing."
Tony M.,"Lexington, KY",1,41,,1.0,7/4/2016,"Wait was long, service was a 5 out of 10, food was mediocre at best. Waiter hardly came back, they messed up our order, food came out cold, I know they have been open for two weeks, but this is ridiculous. Only way I'll be back, is if there was no wait, and all I wanted was water. Better off going to brubuger and mellow mushroom. They really need more managers on the floor."
Shawn D.,"Lexington, KY",0,11,6,1.0,12/28/2016,"Over 2 hours and 4 of 6 of us left hungry. The food didn't come out at the same time so we couldn't eat together. We were served burnt crisp noodles, stale chips and pita bread, chicken tacos with no chicken, crunchy rice, dry spaghetti noodles and cold oily soup. Even given the chance to remake 2 of the dishes one came back (the exact same dish with chicken thrown on top--no kidding). The other was fresh but cold, just like the second soup. When we spoke to the manager she let us know they were short handed and still ""new"" as they had only been open six months, but she didn't go in the kitchen much but she would go check on things. She only ended up comping a portion of the ticket then offered a desert (which we declined since we had already been there 2 hours). The appetizers (boneless chicken wings) were good and we did drink our drinks. However, after she left we waited twenty additional minutes to pay the forty dollars we were charged and four of us went home to eat. We were so disappointed I joined yelp for this review. We will not be returning and with all the great restaurants around the area don't waste your time. The mall food court is better."
Jason A.,"Lexington, KY",0,5,,3.0,11/25/2016,"Typical chain restaurant food.  We got a burger and avocado rolls.  Both were OK, but nothing I would return for, especially for the price.  They are open late, which is great, so we were able to get food after a movie."
Connie H.,"Richmond, KY",0,17,,3.0,5/5/2017,"We came here on a Thursday at around 5:00. Got a couple beers, ordered an appetizer and some burgers. We had somewhere to be at 7:00 and my husband joked that if we were still there at 7, something had gone terribly wrong. Well, fast forward to 7, and we were still there waiting on dessert and the check. Food was okay. Service was SOO SLOW! Finally complained to the manager who rushed our dessert out and we paid the check. Gave it 3 stars because the food was all right, the place was clean, and my son loved the black cherry soda. Oh, and the floor was so slick I was hoping no one would fall. Our server was very personable so don't really want to put the blame on her, I think their system is flawed because many reviews on here are discussing slow service. My question is, is anyone at this restaurant listening to these reviews? To make it in Lexington you need repeat business and I wonder how many customers you are losing."
Julia B.,"Lexington, KY",23,2,1,1.0,7/7/2016,"The disappointment I felt when I unpacked my to go order was absolutely crushing. My fiancé and I were really excited to see a BJ's open up here in lexington since we tried one in Louisville and the food was magical. First off, my fiancé had to wait for our food for about 20 minutes on top of the 20 minutes it took us to get there after ordering. When he came out he said it seemed there were a lot of pissed off customers. Well, I became a pissed off customer when I saw my order had been completely botched.  I got an appetizer sampler that came with egg rolls, spring rolls, spinach and artichoke dip, and mozzarella sticks. Instead I got the egg rolls, mozzarella sticks, and Plain boneless chicken wings.  It didn't come with any sauces either..yeah thanks for the plain chicken. :/ So I didn't get half of what I ordered and I didn't get any sauce for what I did get. HUGE FAIL. I called to complain and the girl said I'd receive a call from their manager the next day to resolve the issue. Its been four days.....I wouldn't try out this place until it's been opened for awhile and they work out their kinks. They clearly are a mess at the moment."
Lindsey H.,"Lexington, KY",0,1,,1.0,7/29/2016,"Service was ok but we were served chicken that was not cooked! Stuffed mushrooms are amazing but the other food we got (black and blue burger, shrimp and Maui Maui tacos) was nothing to brag about. Honestly won't go back after being served the raw chicken."
Hung L.,"Lexington, KY",0,10,,1.0,10/6/2016,"I've been three times & all three times stunk. The first time, the waitress rang up our credit card for the wrong meal. She took out cards back to fix them & did it again. The second visit, our waiter fell down in the kitchen & got hurt. So we went 30 minutes with nobody checking on us. The third time, the food was horrible. I ordered spaghetti & meatballs. I've had better spaghetti in a can of spaghettio's. The meatballs tasted like they weren't cooked thoroughly. I had pizza the first two visits & it's decent. Stay away from the spaghetti & meatballs. I'll never be back, just because I play by the three strikes & you're out rule of thinking."
Thadeus F.,"Louisville, KY",0,3,1,2.0,8/6/2016,"Food was OK, beer was good, however...  INSANELY slick floors, extremely, ridiculously dangerous. It's like they clean it it with Pine Sol mixed with dawn, then didn't rinse it all off. A fire Marshall would poop himself, if he didn't squirt straight through the back door. Chairs at the bar slip EVERYWHERE, and apparently ""corporate is aware."" So they should plan on lawsuits. No doubt a kid will bust his mouth, or someone break a link or hip.  If I were a floor manager, I would be spreading sawdust and peanut shells everywhere to sop up this oily mess."
