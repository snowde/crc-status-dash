Jenna J.,"Cabot, AR",36,21,22,4.0,9/15/2017,"I like the atmosphere here. Service is always pretty fast and super nice. I like the specials they have on each day of the week. We went there for dinner last night and I really wanted a particular frozen drink but wanted it with rum instead of vodka, the bartender was more than willing to sub it out for what I wanted. Decently priced, cool place to watch sports."
V G.,"Monterey County, CA",23,70,273,2.0,1/7/2018,The drive up service is slow. It seemed a lot of workers were walking around with not much to do. I'm guessing it was a busy night. The dish I had was greasy and gross. I had an Asian peanut chicken and noodle dish but it left a lot to be desired. I will not be returning to BJ's.
Chris I.,"Hot Springs National Park, AR",16,86,430,3.0,1/1/2017,Had dinner here with some of my best friends. There were lots of delicious looking food on the menu. Service was pretty good. Our waiter was nice and friendly and always had a smile on her face. We were well attended. Atmosphere was very calming. It was a little chilly in there tonight though.  Food came in at a decent time. When I got my order it was pretty oily. Not sure if that's how it really is prepared but my other friends plate was also oily. Too much oil that is! The taste was different but could be better. Need to try other dishes and see if they are also about the same oiliness. Maybe I could try this place again. Give it another chance. Hopefully our dishes won't be as oily.
Savannah M.,"Little Rock, AR",0,4,,1.0,11/18/2017,"Update: Didn't post this review before. I went again with higher hopes and was not impressed so I decided to post it. ... Here at 5:30 and the restaurant is really empty. I see waitstaff leisurely walking around and talking. Five waitstaff are gathered at the entryway. I ask for a table for nine and I'm told it will be a 20 minute wait. Wait for what?  Still sitting here and a group of four walks in and gets a table, group of two, another group of two, group of three. Im confused. I've waited tables all my life, it's not hard to put two tables together.  Ordered shrimp and asked them to be sautéed in oil instead of butter because of my nephews allergy. Came out in butter.  Drinks pretty much stayed empty and the food was mediocre at best.  Happy Mother's Day to us!"
Brian C.,"Memphis, TN",7,9,51,4.0,7/9/2017,I was a little skeptical with the rating bit decided to try them because of the in-house brewery and vast menu. The Nashville wings were hot and very tasty. My wife's salad was huge and she actually ate most of it! Our server was attentive and answered all the questions we had about the menu. All in all it was a great place to grab a bite and a brew.
Chuck B.,"Little Rock, AR",2,7,4,4.0,7/22/2017,Huge menu means everyone can find something they like. Third or fourth visit now and have not been disappointed. My wife loves the Alabama Sunset. The superfood menu items are a nice option.
Anthony J.,"Spring, TX",41,29,67,1.0,4/22/2017,The worst BJ's Brewhouses I've been to. They are normally really good.This one is not worth the money or the time. Not coming back to this one
Dean P.,"Omaha, NE",0,74,,5.0,2/19/2017,"It had been about a year since visiting Little Rock, so getting back to BJ's was a pleasant experience.  My groups was there on a Saturday night, but we were greeted and seated promptly.  The menu has changed a little, with some nice additions; and the microbrew bourbon ale was tasty.   Food was exceptionally good.  Boneless wings; chicken Parmesan; pizza; salmon tacos.  All SO good, tasty and fresh.   Service was exceptional.    Steve's welcoming certainly makes him a great goodwill ambassador for BJ's and I hope he is recognized for his fine contribution to the restaurant.    Whenever I get back to visit my Arkansas family, I look forward to coming back!"
Cheryl H.,"Prim, AR",1,50,64,4.0,5/27/2017,I enjoyed my experience. The place was 3/4 full and the service was great. I love the gluten free options they have even if I am a little skeptical with most restaurants gluten free. I would return.
Sean T.,"Little Rock, AR",1,38,,1.0,4/6/2017,"Horrible chain corporate restaurant. As with most places like this the food obviously comes out of a can or a pouch. If you're going to be an out-of-state chain restaurant in a market full of exceptional local options you should be incredibly good to compete BJs is not good, and they do not compete. On top of that their beer is pretty consistently horrible. Don't be fooled, they do not brew beer in the state of Arkansas. They import it from some out-of-state giant conglomerate. I'm a firm believer or that the Arkansas brewery scene is good enough where you don't have to shop out of state anymore."
Kasheena P.,"Little Rock, AR",46,54,3,2.0,3/12/2017,"After a few visits I can honestly say this places is about as average it gets. The spicy cheese dip lacks flavor and was thick as paste, and the parmesan chicken and mashed potatoes had no seasoning. The plus side to my visits here is that the wait staff is always friendly but I definitely won't be back."
Don F.,"Emporia, KS",46,9,,1.0,3/21/2017,The worst BJ's Brewhouses I've been to. They are normally really good. Service was sooooo slow and the food was just okay. Not coming back to this one
Brian C.,"Memphis, TN",0,13,,5.0,11/30/2016,"BARTENDER**** I can't speak for everyone but the bartender - Diane is a class act. She understands the ins/outs of the business and the good/bad patrons. None deteriorate her energy which is absolutely vital to the atmosphere. Hats off - grab a beer or three and open up a conversation with Diane. I dont know her personally and I've never set foot in this bar,  I don't have a reason for posting this review other than watching her running the bar the way it should be run - but more so felt the need over the diversity she deals with nightly. A ""Trooper"" feels like a gross understatement and rightfully so.  Quite the opposite of boring, give this gal a high five. Cheers to you Diane! You deserve it"
John J.,"Little Rock, AR",7,69,293,4.0,5/24/2016,Their beers were tasty and their Jambalaya was to die for. The bartenders (Ben and Candy)  were great  and friendly making it a great experience.
Troy D.,"Corona, CA",0,17,18,2.0,1/6/2017,"My moms 76th Birthday, service was bad, took 15 min to come take drink order, took another 15 to get drinks, they were wrong, took us asking someone to see why the correct drinks were not there yet. No one showed up for another 15 min, we noticed the waitress having some conflict with what must have been a manager, finally the manager came and took our appetizer order and pushed us to order the meal at the same time. Then after an extended period of time one of the three appetizers came out, as we are eating the appetizers they brought out our food and started trying to take the appetizers off the table to fit the food.  Food was good but not what other BJ restaurants are.  Very disappointing experience."
JD F.,"Little Rock, AR",158,3,2,2.0,12/26/2016,"If you're going to charge $16 for a 5 oz. steak, at least mention the portion on the menu. Wouldn't mind as much of the steak was an excellent cut and cooked perfectly. It was neither. Asked for medium rare. Had to look at it side by side my brothers hamburger to make sure they didn't accidentally give me a burger too. In fact, my steak was harder to chew than their burger. Ridiculous portions and not even 4 star quality."
Gabriel F.,"Little Rock, AR",10,39,43,5.0,11/29/2016,One of my favorite places to get pizza. They have a great menu and a lot to pick from. I love their pizzas and salads. I think you get a good portion and great quality for the price. So far every experience at BJ's has been wonderful.
John B.,"Austin, TX",36,134,78,4.0,5/17/2016,Bartender did a great job of trying to help me find a beer that I liked among all of their choices given my taste preferences
Brittany P.,"Conway, AR",9,10,,5.0,3/30/2017,"I just broke my 40 day diet for The Spicy Pig, all I can say is, it's amazing. It is a cool space with a lot of tables. I would come here with coworkers or family and still be comfortable. Next time I'm looking forward to trying the Santa Fe salad."
Josh B.,"Collierville, Memphis, TN",39,46,1,3.0,1/12/2017,"Overall, this is a good restaurant. The service wasn't bad, but it was slower. Slower than I am looking for during lunch. The food was solid, but the menu has like 30 pages. Be sure to bring a jacket, as it was freezing!!"
Susan D.,"Little Rock, AR",0,10,3,3.0,8/13/2017,"Thank goodness for our waitress, Carmen. It was her first day, and her sweet, bubbly personality made the experience here bearable. Otherwise, I'd be giving it ONE STAR. In fact, our first encounter with Carmen was when no one at the hostess station seemed to be tending to is, and she acknowledged our presence. Even after that, they couldn't seem to agree on where to seat us. SEVERAL problems with our order due to what has to be an incompetent kitchen -- sweet tea instead of unsweet tea, two of the same type tacos although I'd ordered two different ones, no cous cous with my son's salmon and no ice cream with my husband's dessert. Even with the good experience with Carmen, I don't think this place will merit a return visit. Thank you for your good service though, Carmen!"
Kent A.,"Fayetteville, AR",33,136,1791,4.0,4/18/2016,Much better than I expected.  Stopped in for lunch with friends and I had the French Dip.  It was very good.  Good menu with lots of choices.  It seems to be a great place to take groups with varied tastes.
Judy D.,"Roswell, NM",4,5,,1.0,1/6/2017,"The food was just ok.  I've eaten at multiple BJ Resteraunts and it was awesome.  This location, the service was horrible and the waitress had a seriously bAd attitude.  I won't be going to his location again"
Joe S.,"Little Rock, AR",0,35,7,1.0,12/11/2016,Notice something missing. Oh my *^%# food!  After 1 hour and 10 minutes I've had one drink and no food. Unacceptable. Will NEVER return. Strongly advise to stay away. People behind me left after much complaint.
Melissa M.,"Trumann, AR",295,260,1801,3.0,3/16/2015,"If I were rating BJ's based only on the pizookie it would no doubt be 5 stars. Those things are amazing!! But, I must factor in the rest of the food. This was the second time I had been to a BJ's and I wasn't sold last time either. This time I ordered a small dish of mac and cheese because we had eaten a big lunch. The bacon in it was very smokey, like overly smokey. Also it wasn't very creamy. I enjoyed the bread that came with it and I did end up eating all of it but it could have been better. I ordered a raspberry lemon drop which was very strong. The sugar around the rim did help a little. I would definitely say just stick with BJ's for dessert, unless I just haven't found the right dish yet."
Tyler S.,"Little Rock, AR",290,13,4,3.0,11/25/2016,"This place is alright, a good spot to catch a game and have a drink. Their berry beer and skinny fries are pretty good. Everything else is mostly like any other sports bar."
Brenna T.,"Maumelle, AR",181,2,,1.0,12/26/2016,"Very disappointed with today's service. It took us TWO hours to eat lunch, due to the fact that we were sitting there unattended for 90% of the time. Our server graced us with his presence twice. My mother even went to the bar to get drink refills (which we hoped he would have gotten the hint). He didn't even come to get our checks. We walked around until we found the manager to pay our bills. The manager basically brushed us off when we told him about the poor service we experienced. BJ's always has amazing food, but holy moly this was the most pathetic service I've ever experienced."
Raylin H.,"Portland, OR",2,6,,5.0,9/13/2016,"I'm so mad at myself for not catching her name, but there is one particular waitress who is seriously amazing. She always remembers my husband and I's drink orders (even if we haven't been in MONTHS) and has the cheeriest disposition. We have never been treated badly any time we have gone, and we have been going quite a lot lately. Nice atmosphere as well. Only thing is that if you catch them around dinner time, expect to wait a bit for your entrees."
Carl C.,"North Little Rock, AR",17,70,6,2.0,3/12/2017,"I have been to this location a few times now, and have run into some of the same problems every time to one degree or another. The last time (03/05/2017) has convinced me that I will probably just continue to use the other location. I walk in around 11:45 and I am seated pretty quickly. Then I waited 15 minutes, though the area that I was in was not busy. Finally after 15 minutes another waiter (Kevin) asked me if I had been helped, I shook my head negatively, and told me to give him a few he would get me served. Kevin came got my order, and went to put in my order. While waiting for my drink, the waiter that I was supposed to be served by, comes up and gets a little upset that they didn't give me a menu, until I explain that another waiter came and took my order after having to wait so long for him. I won't call him out because I do not know if he is just extremely new or what, but the lack of awareness just got to me. My chicken Paidina was over cooked but not ruined. Over all, the other location is much better."
Reid R.,"Omaha, NE",141,237,224,3.0,12/6/2015,Oh my god you want good food this place rocks!!!!  Make sure you go to the one in North Little Rock because the other one shorts you 9 out of 10 times on everything you order ...
Blake R.,"Conway, AR",69,218,213,4.0,2/20/2016,"Stopped by and has lunch. Food was better than expected, we had pretty good service. Will definitely go again next time in the area."
Erin J.,"Little Rock, AR",162,138,555,5.0,11/29/2014,I love BJs I know it's a chain but it's always been very good. I always get the parm crusted chicken and I get double mashed potatoes instead of the vegy and it's always so good and plenty for another meal at home. My sister got the burger and really enjoyed it. We have also had their pizza and it's very good as well. For dessert get the peanut butter s'more pizolle. Not sure about the spelling but do good and plenty big to split
Marie K.,"Indianapolis, IN",3,23,11,3.0,8/20/2016,I hang out here a lot during football season so I can catch all of the games. They used to have an amazing happy hour with practically all apps and drinks half off. They changed it and now it's just ok.
Sheena V.,"Dallas, TX",9,38,3,3.0,9/11/2015,"I've only been here a few times, and each visit didn't really impress me. They have a great selection of beer, and their food choices are awesome, but the wait was always long. The first time I went, the wait wasn't that bad, but my burger tasted burnt. All the other times I've gone, we were left there, twiddling our fingers during the long wait for food.  I don't think I'll ever suggest BJ's for dinner, but if I'm asked to go, I'll put up with it."
Vonda M.,"Fort Myers, FL",0,3,4,2.0,12/30/2016,Waited over an hour for our food-husbands burger was like shoe leather and then got our bill wrong. 2 stars only because our waitress was very nice and felt bad for the mismanaged kitchen.
Douglas D.,"Fort Worth, TX",1,52,3,1.0,6/2/2015,"Very sorry service when you have to wait ten minutes without being acknowledged by a waiter.  When I asked of I was going to get waited on, he exclaimed it would be a few minutes.    He had a table of six, so he was over worked I told the hostess to find me a waiter that wanted to wait on me or find me a manager!"
Andy S.,"Memphis, TN",246,554,23,4.0,5/27/2014,"This is a chain, and this is the first one in Arkansas.  I have visited ones in California in the past.  There are none in Tennessee.   We went for our friends' join bachelor/bachelorette party, and this place was chosen at the last minute.  We were also late for our reservation.  However, the service was phenomenal.  They were super accommodating, even though were were VERY late and were a large unplanned party.   The space has a typical bar and restaurant feel that you get from a chain restaurant.   They have a variety of their own hand crafted beers.  I had the Tatonka Stout.  It is full bodied and full of flavor.   For my starter, I ordered a caprese salad.  It was great with mozzarella, tomatoes, and balsamic.   For my meal, I got the Black and Bleu-house burger.  It was cooked perfectly and topped with crumbled blue cheese and bacon with a garlic aioli and a chipotle sauce.  I got it served with seasoned fries.   This place was really, really good.  They have good beers and good solid burgers."
Tim R.,"Little Rock, AR",3,12,,2.0,4/10/2016,Large selection of beers but the food at the same standard. The food tastes and looks like fast food. The pork chop was child size with no sides.
Amber L.,"Alameda, CA",74,577,258,3.0,4/21/2014,"(+) Huge menu, including a few gluten free options. There should be something for everyone. Good ambiance, and a very spacious dining area. Quick, friendly service. Huge beer and drink menu. (-)  My only real negative is that the food wasn't anything to write home about. I tried one of the deep dish pizzas, which was mainly ALL bread (which I love, don't get me wrong) - but had few, if hardly any, toppings. It wasn't even close to comparable to true Chicago style pizza. My husband also had a steak, which was overcooked (despite ordering ""medium"") - it was definitely well done.  It's a chain, so honestly, I went in with lower expectations. Three stars is pretty accurate of my experience."
Katherine W.,"DeWitt, AR",2,15,1,2.0,5/17/2015,"Pretty good craft beers, service was decent. Food was disappointing.  Avocado egg roll appetizer was not appetizing to look at and the taste wasn't much better. Burgers were greasy and lacked flavor. I had the crispy jalapeño burger and I would have never dreamed it could be so bland. The potato wedges could easily have been the same ones available at any convenience store. All in all I'd rather drink a Bud Light and have good food."
