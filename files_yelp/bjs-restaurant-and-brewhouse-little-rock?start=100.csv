Charles Z.,"Siloam Springs, AR",0,5,,1.0,4/28/2014,"We LOVE BJs,.... Just not this BJs.  Service was slow (we were the first ones in the door at 11 am but couldn't get seated for 10 minutes due to ""no waitstaff"").  Even though it was early and there were few customers, it took forever to be waited on/served.  Drink order was not correct and calamari appetizer was less than half the size that we have been served at any other BJs anywhere else. (Even though the calamari was only one layer deep it still didn't even begin to cover the platter.... This did provide us with a laugh and guessing game on where the rest of it went....) Just a terrible experience from a chain that has always exceeded our expectations everywhere else.  Can't wait to go to Texas and enjoy BJs again."
