Yasmin H.,"Bryant, AR",1,6,8,5.0,4/10/2014,"Crazy talk! I apologize on behalf of the human race for the experience the guy below had here but outside of maybe his experience, as I am sure it was only one employee or possibly even a patron who could have stolen the phone not a conspiracy including the entire staff and most certain the building itself did not consume the phone. You can not rate a restaurant or the food and staff on something that may happen once in a lifetime.  Now on to my review and the important part.  Our waitor Arturo was amazing, knowledgeable about the food the atmosphere the brewery and genuinely very nice. Bravo!  Ordered the in house brewed cream soda, delicious, end of story!  The food was amazing, I had the parm crusted chicken. Two large and very tender chicken breast meat covered in a crispy parmesan! Served with steamed broccoli and delicious mashed potatoes. Had left overs that Arturo boxed and bagged for us! My husband had the Jambalaya which was also very delicious! Even better, we don't eat pork and the sausage was chicken!!! It was a bit spicy so beware on that part but if you enjoy such as we do, dig in! Again, left overs! On to dessert, white chocolate macadamian nut wonder! It was a sweet toothed connaisseurs dream. Next time I will try the sampler!  Epic!  Will be coming on a regular."
Tripp A.,"Rogersville, MO",0,24,1,1.0,1/21/2017,"Service was horrible. We thought he was just busy, but he was going over to the side and watch the game. My wife's meal was dry. My steak was as dry as could be. Had to flag him down just to get my daughters drink that never came on til after the meal.all around bad."
Emad H.,"Little Rock, AR",6,9,3,5.0,4/10/2014,One of the best restaurants in little rock if you like to try different food you should come here. I've been to a lot of restarants in little rock and all what you see is same menu: steak and mashed potatoes...etc This place serve various kind of food it worth a try. Now for the people who gave this place one star because this place didn't pay their electric bill or rent I just don't understand some people would say i hate this restaurant because the weather wasn't nice outside lol Anyways you won't regret coming here
Maurice C.,"Bryant, AR",90,10,3,2.0,12/17/2015,"Not a good experience today. For starters, it took a while for the waitress to take our drink order. Then food was slow to come out. My appetizer (calamari) was extremely over cooked. I ordered the Ziti and was disappointed at the portion size as well as the taste. One other person in my party received her steak over cooked. Then when it was redone, it was undercooked. All she wanted was medium-well. Silverware was dirty. Had to get new silverware twice."
Minna Z.,"Memphis, TN",220,37,4,4.0,11/11/2015,"We were visiting Little Rock from out of town. BJs was super close to our hotel, so we gave it a try. The menu is SUPER eclectic so it is ideal for big groups of people who are all craving various things. They also have a light menu for those who are watching their calories. The menu lists all of their items with their calories, which is super helpful. I tried the Bison Burger, which was DELICIOUS and supposedly light, heh. We went on a Friday night, so it was pretty packed, but they've got a nice bar to sit at to let the time pass.  They've got a pretty decent selection of beers. Another thing worth mentioning was that our appetizer didn't come out until we were finished with our entrees, but our server was nice enough to not charge us for it. Definitely a wonderful find in the LR area!"
Nhi S.,"Little Rock, AR",18,39,49,4.0,2/7/2016,"This is your typical chain restaurant but we do like their calamari as an appetizer, pizzas and chocolate chip Pazooki for dessert. Great place for a good beer selection and to watch games. Most of the time we receive good service unless they're short staffed. I prefer sitting in the bar area for service."
Noel L.,"Stafford, VA",13,68,8,5.0,1/19/2016,"Wow, what a menu, fish, pizza, salads, drinks and much more!  We had chips with guacamole and salsa, chicken tacos, salad (mixed greens), and pizza.  Service and food were above the norm."
Vance S.,"Siloam Springs, AR",7,35,17,4.0,10/4/2015,"Building and atmosphere is very cool!  Our greeter / seater was a real Bit&@, that started me off a bit irritated.....I guess it is unacceptable to want to change your table when they take you to it (the restaurant was about empty when I arrived, and she attempted to seat us right at the kitchen entrance...are you freaking kidding me?).  The food was OK, the beer selection is awesome, the desert...the pizzookie...was very tasty!  I had a good time overall, and will return.  Nice place to hang out.  The menu is massive...which is probably why the food is just OK.  But...when coming with a group, any general taste should be able to be well satisfied.  Peace out!"
Crystal S.,"Little Rock, AR",0,7,,5.0,9/9/2016,I love this place! Food and wait staff are always great and timely! Parm crusted chicken amazing! Lemon pepper wings amazing! Pasta amazing! Chocolate chip cookie warm dessert amazing!
Brewmaster C.,"Gifford, WA",10,9,1,4.0,4/6/2016,"We only had appetizers, the fried calamari and the ahi poke... The calamari was cooked very well, breading was done properly and the squid wasn't over cooked, served with marinara and an other cream sauce, both tasted great.... The poke was delicious even though the salad prep forgot the avocado....  I had two of their house brewed beer. The American IPA it was ok but had too many caramel notes for a true IPA, leave it to the Americans to Americanize stuff that was perfectly fine already......""I'm white American born and raised"".           Then I tried the imperial stout... It was true to form however at 8.5% be careful of this one.. It's my personal opinion the the imperials should always be served 8oz at a time in  a proper 8-10oz open mouthed stemmed goblet glass... This does more to appreciate a complex beer and also allows time for the drinker to get a bearing on how much they have had..... My very nice waitress was probably told this because she told me it was similar to a Guinness, don't confuse the two styles, Guinness is light and creamy. An imperial stout is strong, black, bold, resinous, and sometimes bitter(which was the case for this one), and has 2 to 3 times the alcohol, 2 in this comparison.......  I like imperials and this was a decent imperial(think Old Rasputin with less flavor). 4 stars only because of lack of beer knowledge and missing a key ingredient in an otherwise tasty appetizer.... .... Will go back one day"
Michael O.,"North Little Rock, AR",0,6,,5.0,12/3/2015,We've been here twice recently since moving back to the area. The food is always great! The second visit our server seemed a bit distracted and for some reason refuses to write down orders and had to repeat it several times but otherwise service was good.
Tont H.,"Biloxi, MS",14,67,46,2.0,4/8/2015,Started off good they have a double IPA that WS good then I ordered a veggie flat bread. It had 60% onions. And tasteless cheese the night ad well gave me bread and onions.  Service was OK but I watch a bar tender empty one bottle of wine and the grabbed a 1/2 empty 2 and bottle and started to pore is the smelled the wine and shrugged.
Allan S.,"Rogers, AR",36,31,4,1.0,1/26/2016,"Sticky table, peel apart menus, dirty silverware...... What else can I say. I should have stopped there but I ordered anyway. Sampler of beers quite tasty and the only saving grace for this place. Ordered the jambalaya. I love jambalaya but this place was so heavy handed on the spice that's all I could taste. Kinda thankful for that since the chicken and shrimp was overcooked dry and shriveled. Do not eat here!!!!! Drinks are fine."
Channon L.,"Richland, TX",90,3,1,1.0,7/17/2016,"Very slow about getting us our appetizer, ordered them 15 min and still waiting. Got our appetizers and they were Burt to the point you couldn't eat them. So we sent them back, waiter didn't have to much to say about them either. Finally got them. Lunch came about 30 min later. Had to ask for refills for my drink. Got my bill and got charged for the appetizer s and shouldn't have. Never even saw the manager over them. It was so slow in there, no excuse for the long wait. Arrived at 1PM left at 3:20PM."
Shawn X.,"Chaska, MN",17,4,,4.0,9/29/2014,"Love the food & the beer. The service though is not the best. Had to remind the hostess that we were at a table waiting for our server after sitting for almost half an hour without one waiter/waitress coming to check on us. This wasn't a one time occasion either. I'd probably never go back, but the guys/gals in the kitchen know what they're doing. I've never had a bad dish here.  As for beer, I'd recommend either the Jeremiah Red or the Brewhouse Blonde if you're feeling like a light beer. If you're not big on beer, I'd recommend trying the Berry Burst Cider. I'm not big on wine coolers or any type of hard cider, but this is amazing."
Alexis M.,"Overland Park, KS",49,10,3,4.0,11/18/2015,"I stay at a nearby hotel quite frequently for work so come here often. They have a really big menu with a lot of variety. Also, it's happy hour all night whenever there's NFL games on so that's a bonus! I've had several of their flat breads, soups, and the chicken barbacoa. All were good! I definitely recommend the cantina flatbread. I like that they always have a lot of different seasonal drinks, too. Never have to get the same thing twice! The staff is very friendly and attentive but I've often had things come out incorrectly -- either not to specifications (ex. no artichokes) or with the incorrect side. They always fix it but it's strange it's happened so frequently! Overall, it's a fun, pleasant environment and has something for everyone."
Susan H.,"Alexander, AR",13,3,1,2.0,1/14/2016,"I haven't left many reviews lately.....but the lunch at BJ's brought me back....They need a cook or more cooks....ordered the appetizer with Brussels sprouts....burnt badly...could not believe they served that hot mess....sent it back... I ordered the Cherry Chipolata glazed Salmon....again....it comes on a bed of asparagus....Salmon was good, but the asparagus was unrecognizable..Looked like burnt grass...Will not return anytime soon.....for a overpriced lunch of burnt offerings. note service was excellent...poor waiter, don't know if he has a choice but I would have refused to take the food to the table.  Don't know why they show Rose Oklahoma on the review I shared...Don't know where rose oklahoma is...I live in Alexander, Arkansas."
Michaellrar L.,"Lonoke, AR",2,19,19,1.0,6/22/2015,"My niece wanted to treat me to some place nice for Father's Day.  She was torn between Outback and BJ's.  She decided on BJ's because I had never been there.  We arrived at 8:10pm and was told it would be 10 to 15 minutes before we could be seated.  No problem though I wondered why there was so many empty tables that would allow us to be seated immediately.  The wait person mentioned his name once and I almost immediately forgot it.  Once again, another establishment where staff does not wear name tags. By 8:30pm he had our drink order.  Ten minutes later he was back to clarify the drink order.  A few minutes after that he took our appetizer order and entree order.  He immediately told my daughter they are out of ribs so she ordered a ribeye.  By 9:15pm he brought out our appetizers and told us they are also out of ribeyes.  My niece and daughter order a pizza as a substitute and my niece asked how fast the pizza would be ready.  At 9:30 he came by our table and my niece stopped him and asked for an update.  He did not know so she asked for a check and paid it.  The only positive thing I can about BJ's is the house salads was great.  This will be a scratch on our list of places to eat out once a week."
Michelle ..,"Midland, TX",2,34,15,1.0,8/14/2014,"I been here a twice since they been opened but my last visit the service was horrible! I really hate when a dining experience is ruined by poor service.  The food here is good for a chain but we had such a terrible experience with the service I can't give them more than 1 star. When the server/expediter brought our food and another waiter helped put the food on our tables. Which is understandable since waiters help each other out. We see our waiter on the computer checking out tabs of a large party ~10 people.  However, there were a few condiments that they forgot to bring out (salad dressing and bbq sauce ) along with hot sauce so we asked for and we waited and it never came out. By this time this party of 10 is already gone and he only had 2 tables to serve. Our waiter was nowhere to be seen so we had to ask another waiter, in which she told us that she will tell our waiter and let him know. We waited and still didn't get any condiments.  Our waiter is still missing so I got the attention of another waiter who was passing by us and told him that we are missing our condiments and have asked several times. This 2nd waiter returned with our condiments and since our waiter has gone missin my friend asked if she can order soup. So the 2nd waiter puts in our order and brings it to us.  Our REAL waiter did not ask how we doing, how the food was, or fill our water -- basically did not check up on us at all until time for the check and then asked who ordered the soup since we asked for separate checks. We came in the middle of the week day and it was not busy by any means, there was about 7-8 tables filled in the whole restaurant. There was a couple across from us and they were not happy either. As the guy's steak was over cooked and service was also lacking. I overheard their conversation with the manger and she did not make things any better so I didn't even want to waste my time. We ended up did not tipping our REAL waiter and tipped the other waiter that actually did help us (and his area/zone was on the other side of the restaurant)! He was surprised but very grateful and thanked us. I'm not sure if the waiters at BJ's pool their tips and divide them later but because of this experience, I hope they don't pool their tips! Either way I will not be coming back to this chain."
The Bar W.,"Alexander, AR",0,3,,3.0,8/10/2016,"This place smells like absolute piss. Like homeless people have been urinating here for a week and they left the AC turned off. The service is awesome, but I suggest using clean mop water and sanitizer buckets."
