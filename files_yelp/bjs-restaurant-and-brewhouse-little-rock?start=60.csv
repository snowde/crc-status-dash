Joshua G.,"New York, NY",48,68,47,4.0,10/15/2014,"Beer is great and bar tenders are knowledgeable when it comes to beer.  The food is great as well, definitely not healthy but tasty.  I haven't read other bad reviews, but I can see that cleanliness isn't the best and ambiance isn't great with an empty place and food comes out slept.  The staff isn't the most attentive but very friendly and helpful so I'd  generally give a thumbs up."
Mike T.,"Crown Point, IN",0,30,3,5.0,7/14/2016,"Stopped in here last night after a long day of travel. Quickly got a table. Our server, Lindsey, was knowledgeable, very personable- and had great recommendations for their extensive beer and food selections. We both liked that you could sample up to 3 of the beers before committing.  For dinner, I had the ribs- and I love ribs- they were tender and delicious! My wife had the pulled pork sandwich- the onion straws hit it out of the park. We would definitely come back!"
Michele T.,"White Hall, AR",7,50,30,2.0,8/5/2014,"The food is okay.  The service is terrible.  They are inattentive, and maybe a bit dense.  So far only one waitress seemed to know anything about the menu.   They brought me a dirty place mat when I got the beer sampler.  The menu says any craft beer can be bought as a taster, with the exception of one very expensive pint.  But when my boyfriend's father tried to order all 4 stouts, they said that wasn't possible and only BJ's brews could be sold that way.   My boyfriend got food poisoning on out first visit there.  But everything else was fine. The floor was filthy.  There was half a hamburger bun under the table.  You could see it as you walked up to the table, so there really was no excuse for the busboy to leave something that big on the floor."
Mark H.,"Little Rock, AR",3,44,73,4.0,5/1/2014,"Tried bjs for the 1st time. This is a big restaurant on the inside , so I would imagine with that much seating their will hardly ever be a wait.  I tried the Mediterranean pita tacos ( I thought it was ok nothing special) and my wife tried the classic roast beef french dip ( the French dip was really good )And we had a triple chocolate cookie and ice cream for Deseret ( which was the best part) . I would say this place is a mix of old Chicago ( bc of the pizzas on the menu) and cheddars.  I will try this restaurant again but I didn't see anything on the menu to make me wanna come regularly ."
Don D.,"Alpharetta, GA",43,45,,4.0,6/9/2015,"This was my first visit ever to BJ's.   I was really impressed.   Stopped in for lunch on a business trip to Little Rock.   The atmosphere is great.   Very clean and classy.   I ordered the lettuce wraps and the pan fried pot stickers - they were wonderful and the waiter was very attentive and well informed (experienced).   The price was very reasonable.   I did not try any of their brews as it was mid-day and I had some other meetings.   But, I think you will find it to be a great place to conduct a business lunch"
Brittany W.,"Sherwood, AR",1,14,,1.0,11/7/2015,"If I could leave zero stars, I would. I've been here ONCE, and it will be the last time I ever go to this place. Our waiter, who's name I believe was David, is the nastiest, rudest human I've ever seen. I went with two girlfriends during midday Saturday. One of the women I went with had an issue with her drink. It was watery and tasted like the syrup bag needed to be changed, perhaps. He took the drink and came back with another one. She tried it, and AGAIN, it was watery. She told him that it still tastes funny, like carbonated water. He told her something to the effect of, ""I tried it and it tasted fine."" She just told him to bring her water, which he did. She felt nervous about drinking it because of his attitude. We were all so angry that we didn't even think to ask for a manager to tell him what happened. We just wanted to get out of there.  As far as the food is concerned, it was okay. Nothing spectacular or unique that would make me think about going back. I had salmon, mashed potatoes and chili with calamari as an appetizer. The salmon was not very good. It was some type of sweetened version with a ""cola"" syrup. Not sure.  Whatever manager decided to hire that asshole should be fired, along with said asshole himself."
Joseph E.,"Maumelle, AR",4,79,9,4.0,3/28/2015,Great atmosphere and service along with some good grub.  Usually busy but always have had great service.  The parmesan chicken with asparagus is wonderful.
Fred Bossdawg O.,"Little Rock, AR",2,9,23,5.0,6/25/2014,I really like this place will go again. Can't wait for football season will be there a lot Go Dawgs
Wing Z.,"Newport Beach, CA",0,14,,5.0,7/15/2015,"Excellent food quality. Great and diverse house beers. Excellent ambience. Very clean, classy place. Good service."
Scott C.,"Saint Louis, MO",0,15,,4.0,8/27/2015,"I've been there twice and the food was excellent.  Plenty of beer choices too.  The only down side was the service, pretty slow at times."
Ronnie C.,"Benton, AR",7,3,,3.0,5/16/2015,Their food is pretty good having been here twice. I wouldn't recommend their pizza though because I thought it was over priced for the sizes that you get!
Lisa B.,"Little Rock, AR",13,7,,3.0,10/15/2015,Food was very good.  Beautiful inside with lots of TV's and u can see the game from anywhere you sit!  Our concern was when we checked out with our server...we gave her cash and she only brought us back bills and kept the change (coins) for herself...which was about .75cents.  I know it's not that much...but if she does that with everyone she's got quite a racket going on!  When we asked her she said...oh I'm sorry did u want it back?  We said no and left a MUCH smaller tip than we would have!
Tommy H.,"Heber Springs, AR",1,22,4,1.0,7/15/2014,"Nice ambiance.  Waiter either confused or over worked.  Entire quality was good, sides meager.  Beers were tasty.   What can I expect from a ""brew house?"""
Mitch R.,"Baton Rouge, LA",7,15,1,5.0,10/24/2015,We ordered ribs and white cheese potatoes.  They were great. We also ordered salty Carmel cookie dessert.  It was the best.   We had margaritas with patron.   Enjoyed the entire experience.  We were able to watch lsu football.  Ole miss football.  Mississippi state football all at the same time.    Go sec.  Go BJs.  Fun night.
Mary B.,"Little Rock, AR",20,13,,4.0,10/24/2015,"Good food & loved the beer menu. Chicken pot stickers were also very tasty. Ordered a glass of wine and they upgraded it to the more expensive selection without asking but charged me, only complaint."
Fran M.,"Mason, OH",0,46,1,5.0,7/6/2015,Fish tacos were great. Service by Adam was great. Beer selection was good. Definitely recommend!
Mike J.,"St Peters, Saint Louis, MO",7,238,12,3.0,12/10/2014,Stopped in here with colleagues for dinner. Service was fast and very friendly. Lots of beer options for sure. The menu was large but nothing really struck me as have to try. I ended up with pork chop which was flavored well. The sides were rice and asparagus. Rice was tasty and seemed fresh. The asparagus was over cooked and dried out. Others had good meals and said same for asparagus. I would give em another visit.
Seth J.,"Little Rock, AR",0,3,,2.0,8/6/2015,"I love the beer, but the food and service are poor. Travis was very lackadaisical. This has become the norm for my trips to BJs. If you're coming for a beer, great spot. Anything else...go somewhere else."
Bryan L.,"Nashville, TN",1,66,13,4.0,10/26/2014,I had a good time at the bar watching the football game . Good beers and food with attentive service.
Dana W.,"Monticello, AR",5,145,11,3.0,7/31/2014,"The food was very good.  However, when we arrived the hostess pointed to a table in the bar area, which we found was occupied. We had to return to the hostess table and ask to be seated. They were somewhat unorganized.  We ordered corn fritters for an appetizer and they were delicious (they were basically hushpuppies w/a little bit of corn).  I had the Meditteranian Chicken tacos and loved them. My husband liked his burger (it was huge)."
