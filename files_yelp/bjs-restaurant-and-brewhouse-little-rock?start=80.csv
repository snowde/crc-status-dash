Andrea W.,"Cabot, AR",4,26,2,5.0,5/14/2014,"LOVED IT! First time here, had the stuffed mushrooms to start n they were delicious. Parmesan crusted chicken for me and sirloin for the boyfriend; we loved them both! Chicken was a thin cutlet which is easy to over cook but they nailed it! Steak cooked to perfection. Dessert was the pizookie trio and it was HEAVEN! Joseph, our waiter, was on his second day on the job and did wonderful! We will be back!"
Julie R.,"Maumelle, AR",1,21,,2.0,8/31/2015,"Guest beer prices are high. $6.50 for a Woodchuck draft is way too much. Large menu with lots of low calorie options, but food and service is lacking. The mobile pay option is convenient."
Jen S.,"Helotes, TX",0,7,,5.0,9/4/2015,"After a 9 hour drive from San Antonio TX we called from 35 minutes out they set up a table for our party of 20.  It was ready and waiting when we arrived.  We received the greatest service from the whole staff, but especially our server Erika G.  great job Erika!"
Andrew W.,"Sherwood, AR",0,16,,2.0,6/29/2014,The beer selection is pretty decent but the food is terrible. We ordered the pork chops and a side of brussels  sprout. The portions were pathetically small and tasted horrible. If you come here stick to beer. Great atmosphere though.
Jason K.,"Benton, AR",23,43,,4.0,6/24/2014,"There was a long line when we got there but my part of two was seated within 15 minutes. Service was reasonably fast. We shared the thai shrimp lettuce rolls for an app followed by scallops for my wife and a fried jalapeno cheeseburger for me finished with a pazookie. Food was good, my burger was one of the better ones I've had in the Little Rock area. I tried the inhouse Amber Ale and Imperial Stout and enjoyed both of them. Our waitress was great and showed us how to sign up for their app on my wife's phone and get 5 dollars off our meal. Definitely enjoyed and would go again."
Kevin M.,"Eads, TN",52,247,395,4.0,11/12/2014,"Nice new find for me in the Little Rock area.  First let me in full disclosure tell my true Yelper''s folks that this place is a chain restaurant, so know that going in to my review. The food is basic bar food but with an upscale, higher end bar experience. I'm not a beer drinker, but this place has a rockin bar area with what looks like 25/30 different brews on tap so if you're hunting a special beer it most likely you'll find it here and on draft. As for me, I had three of the in house brewed ""Root beer"" served in the classic frosted mug and DANG it was a great treat. For my meal I started off with a ""twisted BLT"" side salad that was spot on in flavor. It was baby spinach with bacon, chopped tomato, boiled egg, and a vinaigrette.  Then I had the Cajun Jambalaya.  It was not a heavy cream sauce but a well rounded tangy with mild heat in the back if your trough rice concoction with loads of blacken chicken breast bites, shrimp with sausage to boot.  Now the low point was service was slow and a bit off sync with each other in the check in area, however I will take slow service over a pesky server.  My glass of root beer never emptied before refilled and the food was most enjoyable."
Juanita H.,"Little Rock, AR",0,8,1,2.0,6/15/2014,"I called in my order.  The burger was overcooked and very dry. The fries were just okay and the dessert ( a strawberry shortcake type concoction) was not good. The dough was tough and not the beignet consistency it claimed to be on the menu. They told me the machine wasn't working properly. I will give them another try, but this time I will eat in."
Marla C.,"Springfield, MO",0,13,,5.0,3/19/2015,Excellent options; wish I lived here so I could try it all! Settled for kale/Brussels Sprouts salad and the PM Porter. Yum!
Kirt E.,"Aviston, IL",0,1,,1.0,5/19/2015,"Be sure to make reservations at a backup location!  They called me on Sat night at 6:30pm to cancel a Monday reservation for 32-36 people.  You would think a business specializing in serving people, we should have received more notice."
Boyd D.,"Brentwood, TN",0,7,,2.0,4/9/2014,"So this was my first visit and apparently this place just opened.  The look of the place is nice and they have a great looking bar.  Our waiter was obviously new and quite uncomfortable in taking our order.  I ordered ""Santa Fe"" salad and it was really bad.  The lettuce in it looked like the iceburg stuff that would typically be thrown away.  It had been chopped sometime earlier and had the brown edges.  Very little chicken and all around just bad.  The homemade root beer was good, though.  Maybe they will work out the kinks of being a new place....I would wait a couple months before visiting this place."
Kevin A.,"Lubbock, TX",36,4,,5.0,5/6/2014,"A great place to go and feel like you aren't in LR.  The beer and apps on happy hour are a great value.   Nice, clean atmosphere."
Bob S.,"Coventry, RI",4,104,8,3.0,10/21/2014,"Food was average...had the pot stickers then the rib eye... reminded me alot like the Cheesecake Factor, waitress was friendly"
John S.,"Denver, CO",55,68,4,2.0,6/24/2014,"Allot of money went into the decor of this restaurant, but it still comes across as a fancy Red Lobster. When we walked in we told the host we had 4 in our party, she asked if I was an awards member which i laughed at, since we weren't rewards member we were offered bar seating but asked for a bench since the restaurant was empty. We still waited then we we're told theres second host that's actually seats you. This 15mins into our experience so we attempt to order a beer, we're told that's not allowed and our server will be by soon. She gets to our table we order beers it takes another 15mins, so we waited over 30mins for a beer in a ""brewery"".The food came out and was gross frozen veggies they just nuke up? Food was bad, service is really what killed it."
Tamidra M.,"Maumelle, AR",0,1,,2.0,2/21/2015,The wait times were extremely long and the communication from the hostesses was very poor.  Not worth a second trip.
Laura D.,"Edgemont, AR",0,3,,5.0,2/1/2015,"Our first experience at BJ's was great!  Service, beer, pizza, inviting decor....5 stars all around. We had the bacon ranch deep dish. Highly recommend.  Other reviewer's complain about the service, but I have no complaints at all!"
T M.,"Benton, AR",0,1,,1.0,6/18/2015,"The absolute worst service in my life at a restaurant. Went for a Thursday evening meal at 7:00 with 5 friends and that's where it started to go downhill. We arrived at 6:50 and put or name on the list and was told 30 min, 60 min later after noticing everyone passing us in line we inquired about our table. We found that they forgot about us and would quickly get us a table with a good waiter, wrong. We were seated and waited 10 min for our server to take drink orders. When he brought our drinks he took app and food orders. 30 min later one app arrived but not the other and were left with empty drink glasses. One hour after ordering our food it arrived less one persons salad, she was told the were making sure the chicken was hot. When the salad did come the chicken was not hot and the salad was the worst one she had ever eaten. In the middle of our meal our waiter ""Chris"" abandoned us when he saw how our night was going and we were left with a girl in training, she did the best she could I guess. In closing you would think an establishment would attempt to keep customers happy but not this one. We talked to the manager but to no avail. After 2:45 of wasted time and s terrible meal we will not be back. The one star rating is because you can't leave a zero star rating."
Tom B.,"Maumelle, AR",3,22,,1.0,10/11/2014,"Visited here a couple weeks earlier for a company dinner and had a GREAT experience, so decided to make it a lunch outing for us and our neighbors.  Went here for lunch with 7 others (2 families of 4).  Was seated immediately, and had 2 great tables right where we wanted.  Then, everything went downhill.  The store was not very busy, but it took our server  several minutes to come by, and longer to bring us fountain drinks.  1 person's food came within 15 minutes, then - 20 minutes later - the rest of our's came.  The kids' food was warm enough to eat, but mine and one other's burger was on the cool side of room temperature.  A pizza was luke-warm, but she didn't want to wait for a re-cook.  We asked the server to simply ""nuke"" the burgers and bring them back.  Fast forward to 20 minutes later - still waiting for those burgers.  Drink glasses have been empty for a while.  We were making trips to the bar and even into the service area to fill our drinks.  No manager, no server, nobody made any attempt to let us know what was happening.  Finally, we hijacked a busboy and asked for the manager.  He said our burgers would be out in a few minutes.  Nope, didn't happen.  Ended up getting the burgers to-go, so - I'll review a Fried Jalepeno Burger that was taken home and eaten a few hours later.  The fried japs were extremely soggy.  The wedge fries were extremely soggy.  The buns were... well, you get the picture.  The server was polite, but (I believe not adequately trained.  There is no excuse for the manager's nonchalant attitude; no explanation for that.  Not sure what has happened in the past 2 weeks to turn this from a 5-star experience to a 1-star disaster, but don't come here expecting hot food, cold drinks, and good service at this time."
G. A.,"Little Rock, AR",0,3,,2.0,10/5/2014,"Food good,  service horrible,  maybe management will get the hint!!!!! Will not go back till I hear good reports!"
Brenda G.,"San Diego, CA",2,3,,1.0,8/27/2014,We had high hopes for this new bar/restaurant. I have been here 3 times and every time the service has been horrible and the food has not been consistent. This last trip was the worst!  Went for lunch. Note it was not busy!  Our waiter acted like his head was somewhere else. I asked for water 4 times. Our food came out in stages. There were 6 of us and they'd bring a couple of people their food then 5 min later someone else a couple of minutes and two more people got lunch. I waited patiently for my Mac and Cheese and finally had to ask if it was coming. This might have been fine if our food was hot but it was cold and to top that off nothing like the last time we ate there. I asked the manager if they had changed their recipe on some of the food they informed me the chef did that from time to time. You would think a place this size would be ran with policies and procedures that would help their restaurant succeed. Consistency is a must. If this place doesn't get some help it won't be around long. Sad to say!
Steven S.,"Roland, AR",1,13,1,3.0,5/2/2014,"I ate here on May 1, 2014, arriving about 11:30 am for lunch.  I ordered the soup and salad lunch special, and a side order of wedge cut fries. The salad was excellent, freshly made, and the Caesar dressing was among the best I've ever eaten.  The Clam Chowder and fries were both hot, but pre-fabricated far from Little Rock.  BJ's gets three stars instead of more for using pre-fabricated base for the clam chowder, and frozen French fries instead of housemade fries from fresh potatoes, though in my experience few Arkansans know the difference or care. The servers were well-dressed, pleasant, intelligent and articulate.  Prices are competitive."
