Jennifer S.,"Portland, OR",666,562,1974,4.0,5/27/2014,"Tonight's dinner was brought to you by BJs. I actually love this place as far as chain restaurants. The variety of food is perfect without overdoing it. I can't complain about the food, because I can't ever remember having a bad meal. Tonight, I went with three other people. We got there at the same time as everyone else... so, there was a little bit of a wait. But it was pretty quick getting a table. We ordered many things... a beer, waters, avocado egg rolls, a wedge salad, tortilla soup, shrimp scampi, ahi poke, a house salad, and a chocolate chip pazookie. No complaints as far as food goes! I love finishing dinner up with dessert... and you can't go wrong with a pazookie. Mmmmm... I took away one star, because the service was ""meh..."" It was the bare minimum this evening, but it didn't ruin the whole dinner for us as everything was brought out in a timely manner and drinks were refilled."
Sam W.,"Long Beach, CA",446,399,839,1.0,5/21/2014,"I came here with a couple friends Thursday night. We had just eaten dinner at Simmzy's, where it was super busy and packed. We walked across the street from Simmzy's to BJ's for some pizookie and were surprised to see BJ's so empty.  SERVICE: Sat down & our server promptly came by to ask if we wanted drinks. When we said we just wanted water, she seemed disappointed and said ""Oh"". She came by again three times in a short period to check if we had decided on what we wanted. We decided to get a pizookie with half chocolate chip, half cookies and cream pizookie. Once again the server gave off a vibe that she didn't want to serve us now that we only ordered one thing. We didn't see her again after she dropped off our pizookie. Not a great place to get service, I guess."
Cat N.,"Orange County, CA",4271,1319,5866,1.0,3/6/2014,"This location is the worst I have been to I arrived on 3/5/14 at around 12:30pm with my girlfriend and sister for lunch.  I was instantly turned off when I walked through the door at how tiny and muggy it it was inside.  The A/C was turned off and it was dark and depressing.  The size was small as the BJ's bar in the Huntington Beach location.  Tiny!  Despite the disappointment, we decided to tell the hostess that we would like a table by the window for some light.  It took forever for our waitress to come back so we can order.  I'd say 15 minutes.  We had to flag her down.  My girlfriend and I got the endless soup and salad with drinks.  My sister got the flatbread and a garden salad.  We also ordered some Santa Fe spring rolls to share.  By that point, the A/C finally came in and were were no longer dying from heat, just dying from waiting.  They did not bring all our food out at once. My food came out first, then my girlfriend, then it took another 10 minutes for my sisters flatbread. Her salad didn't come until another 10 minutes when the waitress finally realize she forgot it.  My girlfriend had ordered a lemonade.  She had drank it half way and the dumb waitress came to refill it.   She ended up pouring water instead into her cup.  On the way to refill the wrong drink, she also spilled into our table.  As for the food, it was crap.  It was made differently here.  For example, normally my sisters flatbread and salad would come on the same plate at other locations. Hers didn't and was extremely small. It looked like a snack.  A couple of lettuce sprinkled on a plate and two piece of flatbread.  My tortilla soup was extremely salty.  I felt like I was eating salt.  The Caesar salad was bland.  Oh and the appetizer, the Santa Fe spring rolls came out last.  That was the only thing that was okay.  Our total was $48 for 3 lunch specials an 1 appetizer.  I'm never coming back to this location ever.  I recommend you to go the other 638482 restaurants on 2nd street if you want decent food with decent service and atmosphere."
Chris G.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",789,1189,1413,4.0,12/16/2013,"Another good experience; good pizza and craft beer. Arturo did a quality job at keeping our group of 12 filled with pizza and beer.  This is a fun time to hit this location, the area does a nice job of capturing the holiday spirit. Cheers."
Cindy B.,"Los Angeles, CA",1339,1055,93,3.0,12/12/2013,"Well, it's BJ's.  It's great for big groups, but the food was lacking.  My friends and I ordered a bunch of appetizers. Here's the breakdown. Avocado Egg Rolls: These were ok. Santa Fe Spring Rolls: Also ok. Margarita Pizza: The best of what we ordered. Spinach Artichoke Dip: This was the worst spinach artichoke dip ever. Do not get this.  Ahi Poke: This was the second best item we ordered and I would order it again. Would I come back? No. Unless I really wanted a pizookie."
Michelle A.,"Lakewood, CA",2,5,6,2.0,4/26/2014,"The Cobb salad was lacking in flavor. I'm aware that it's not really possible to mess up a salad but my salad was made with lettuce that was no longer fresh. It was already brownish and the pieces of turkey and bacon were not enough to mask the flavor of the bad salad. I could have gotten a better salad at Fresh & Easy for about $5 instead of $13.       The pizza, on the other hand, was very delicious. I got a pepperoni extreme pizza and that was very tasty."
Rose C.,"Milpitas, CA",227,364,197,2.0,11/12/2013,"Not the best experience with BJs. I've been to several in the bay area, and those were all huge, bustling, and had great music and vibe. Since this restaurant is a LOT smaller, it doesn't have that same feel as another BJs might. The lighting was very bright and kitchen-like and there was hardly any music or background noise. Awkward, really.  I came in and there was a 15 minute wait but there were many tables available. I was told that there was a party of 43 coming in. We ordered a beer and a cider. My cider was not filled to the brim, rather, just a little over half. I didn't say anything since I don't drink much, but my boyfriend was peeved.  He ordered a spicy jalapeno cheeseburger and I got The Great White which is a usual favorite at BJs. My boyfriend's fries came out first, which was weird. The waitress said ""Here's your side order of fries,"" which confused us because we did not order a side. The waiter who took our order came back later and apologized and said it was a part of the meal and he wasn't sure why they were sent out so early. By then, the seasoned fries were lukewarm because we weren't sure if we should eat it or not. The Great White was a disappointment. I asked for Spinach in the pizza, but really they just dumped it on top and it was burnt. Not happy about that. Then the edges of the pizza were burnt black as well (I've got pictures to prove it, hah) and overall the taste was mediocre. I've had just better where the pizza was the perfect temperature and the crust was crunchy and moist.  Definitely will NOT be here again and would NOT recommend it to others. The only reason it is 2 stars instead of 1 is because the hostess handled everything flawlessly with that group of 43 people, AND still managed to check on my table despite that being the waiter's job."
Jennifer T.,"Las Vegas, NV",593,553,729,4.0,4/7/2014,"3.5 Stars The smallest location I've ever been. I came around 10:30 on a Saturday night and the restaurant was pretty empty. There's no visible bar and only 3 booths.  I ordered the wedge salad and it was DRENCHED in dressing. It was like I was eating lettuce in a dressing soup. I'm not sure how their salads are, but to be safe next time I'll get dressing on the side.  I don't really like the avocado egg rolls here because there's no meat in them. I think its just avocado chunks with sun dried tomatoes.  We also got half a mediterranean pizza and chicken bacon ranch I believe,both were quite good but a bit salty. Service was better here then at any other locations I've been to. Our server set the pizza down and asked us which slice we wanted first, then set the slice on our plate.  We ordered the salted caramel pizookie and it was soooo good. Its new and definitely worth a try."
Shelley C.,"Los Angeles, CA",470,646,455,3.0,12/11/2013,"I am a huge fan of BJs. This location is actually the smallest BJs I've ever been to. So if you'd rather be in a huge room with tons of people and commotion, go to the BJs in Cerritos instead. This BJs is nice when I've gone on dates, because it's not as loud and packed as other locations. The service here is only okay, however. No one has really gone above and beyond, or been particularly nice. The food I still love, so I'm happy with that."
Jennifer T.,"Washington, DC",48,195,99,3.0,12/6/2013,"Gluten free crust with choice of toppings-- excellent! Better than z pizza gluten free crust, which is saying a lot. But service at this particular Bj fell short. Our server and runners were average-- nice, but definitely didn't go the full mile. I had to insist that ""I don't know"" when asked whether an item was gluten free was not a sufficient response.  He may not be entirely at fault since it is up to management to educate their staff about food allergy and intolerance. Odd then that when our server asked the manager, she snapped at him in front of us.... Awkward.  If you have gf items on your menu, your staff should know why... It's more than just ""I don't like mayo in my sandwich."" All in all, I'll order another gf pizza from Bj, but probably won't return to this one. 4* for food, 1* for service."
Zach P.,"Long Beach, CA",127,582,210,2.0,6/29/2013,"The food here looks, smells, feels and tastes like corporate food.   We came in specifically because my wife was craving the Pizookie, their deep dished chocolate chip cookie that is topped with vanilla ice cream, which frankly, can be made at home with a little effort.   I had the jambalaya and my had the thin crusted BBQ chicken pizza.  The jambalaya was truly a disappointment as the ingredients did not taste fresh at all.  It tasted like typical corporate fare.  I didn't try the pizza, but from previous experiences, it wasn't anything memorable.  We also tried the Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms which were OK, but was basically their spinach dip stuffed in the mushrooms and topped with Parmesan cheese.   They do have a good beer selection however.  So I would just recommend coming in here for a beer and a Pizooke."
Mary N.,"Los Alamitos, CA",475,1627,1012,4.0,6/12/2013,"Mini version of BJs No Bar, however still has great service and great late night weekday deals."
Steven M.,"Lakewood, CA",358,800,40,5.0,12/22/2012,"Not sure why such low reviews... food is excellent, service is top notch, atmosphere is cozy...all around great experience.  Flat bread pizza is HUGE and delish.  Turkey club is fresh sliced turkey...not pre-packaged crap.  About the only item that looked frozen to me was my sons ""happy face"" potatoes.  Round french fries cut like a smiley face for the kids...but, whatever...kids don't mind lol Don't let the overall score deter you...this place is worth a stop."
Andrea V.,"Long Beach, CA",696,766,5296,3.0,1/22/2010,"Yes, I checked yelp before going here. Yes, I know it only has 2 1/2 stars. But sometimes you have to go where the group wants, especially if you are in the area and someone has a gift card. (But I'd much rather go to the Cerritos location if I am going to BJ's.) Overall, the service wasn't too bad. A bit slow, but thanks to yelp, I was expecting it. My only real complaints were that the mozzarella sticks didn't come out fresh and hot like we'd hoped, they were warm, but the cheese was not melty (like you can tell it sat there for awhile before we got it). Also, they give you such a tiny amount of marinara that we had to ask for more and by the time we (finally) got it, the mozzarella sticks had cooled off even more. We tried some of their beers and cider.    I'm not much of a beer drinker, but I really liked the cider.  One member of our party ordered one of the lunch specials. They are pretty affordable. Most are between around $6-$8. (Like a one topping mini pizza with a salad for $5.95.)"
Stephanie F.,"Pico Rivera, CA",25,14,,2.0,5/3/2014,"Service here is terrible! I came in with a party of 3 and 2 more parties that came in after us got seated first. Our server rushed us through drinks, then disappeared after dropping them off.  We flagged down the first staff we could find, and placed our order. We didnt recieve any forks or napkins until we asked a busboy for some.  My review: terrible time. Dont come here."
Kris B.,"Oceanside, CA",399,602,4414,3.0,6/17/2012,"Great lunch specials! Came here with some coworkers for lunch and they have lots of choices like 1/2 sandwich with soup or salad ($7.50).  I ordered the mini sausage pizza with a Caesar side salad ($6.50)  Although the salads came out pretty quickly, the entrees took awhile, which is not good when you're on a lunch break from work.  There were hardly any other guests in the restaurant, so I'm not sure what the hold up was.  If they could get food out more quickly, they may be able to get some additional lunch business?  At least we had a great server who kept our drinks refilled and the food was good!"
Allie F.,"Seattle, WA",9,54,32,2.0,4/8/2014,"This was my first time at a BJ's, and my last. I was in here with a friend last Tuesday, and completely underwhelmed.  I'm not one to complain about slow service unless it's reeeaaally slow. Let me preface this with there were three other tables in the restaurant. We waited the host stand a few minutes for a hostess to show up and seat us. Then we waited several minutes to even be greeted, another two or three for waters. By the time our water came out we were ready to order. Fried artichokes and two salads (yea the grease kind of negates the greens, I know), and a drink for each of us. Apps come out, drinks come out, all ok. Not great but not awful. Then we wait.  And wait some more.  And wait a little bit more.  I used the restroom and came back to my friend telling me the waitress forgot to put our food in. Suddenly 35 minute salads made sense. We finally get our salads, which were ok. We both agreed neither had enough meat. I wouldn't call it even close to 4 oz.  We ordered pizookies for desert and as we are waiting another girl comes over to let us know our waitress has left for the day. Hmm. Maybe she thought we wouldn't tip cause we are young but we are both in the industry and would've still left a decent tip despite her slow service. Not her fault the food sucked. Either way I was annoyed she didn't come over and do the typical hand-off speech, just left. We ate the pizookies which were the best part of the meal, and flagged down our new waitress for the bill. She was nice enough, wish she had been our waitress the entire time.  Bottom line-mediocre Applebee's style food is not my cup of tea, especially if the entire experience is going to drag on for hours."
June Y.,"Long Beach, CA",241,198,303,2.0,10/9/2011,"1. It's in Belmont Shore - on 2nd avenue. 2. Therefore, it's small. Really small. 3. Therefore, parking is a nightmare 24/7. 4. Therefore, I don't really like going here. I still very much enjoy the Jambalaya that BJ's serves. Along with the beer they sell, it makes a great meal. So WHEN I go to this BJ's, I can satisfy myself with the items on the menu.  Fact: this BJ's does not have a bar. Therefore, they cannot serve you any hard alcohol. Don't expect to go here and receive all the same amenities of every other BJ's I've seen/been to. Only alcohol they serve is beer (and wine, I think). The decor is nice. Red bricks and exposed ceiling beams certainly concur with the brewhouse feel. The layout is rather cramped because they have to pack in as many tables, chairs, and booths as possible. If I remember correctly, the bathroom is one-person-at-a-time restroom, which means you'll have to wait until the person in front of you is done. It's not unusual to see a line of ladies (and guys) lined up in the narrow hallway in the back.  My thought is, WHY? If you're out with a group of friends and you're looking for a good time, there are PLENTY of choices on 2nd avenue where you can get beer and liquor, where you can spaciously sit, and get served better food. If you're on an intimate date, there are better places for that, too. It simply doesn't make sense to me why there's a BJ's in Belmont Shore."
Brennan H.,"San Francisco, CA",102,52,14,1.0,11/3/2013,"We had a group of 6 people, and out of us 6, 4 people's orders were incorrect. One of the waiters told us an item didn't exist, but we showed them on the menu that it was a real item.  They gave us a free pizookie, but when the bill came, they tried to charge for 3 salads we didn't order and the free pizookie they gave us! We are not the type of people to care too much about perfect service, but this really was some of the worst service we had ever encountered."
Dev R.,"Long Beach, CA",131,640,2145,5.0,11/16/2012,Who does NOT like BJ's pizza?  I'm also in love with their stuffed potato.
Elizabeth I.,"Los Angeles, CA",79,49,2,1.0,10/10/2013,"Me: ""Do you have room at the bar?"" Hostess: ""There's no bar here""  Me: ""You're pulling my leg, right?"" Hostess: ""No, there's really no bar here.""  Me: ""But it's a pizza place and Brewhouse. Am I dreaming?"" I was not dreaming. This is not a Restaurant & BREWHOUSE."
Stephen T.,"League City, TX",818,324,880,4.0,8/29/2011,"My girlfriend and I went here for dinner on a random Sunday... We live down the street but have never actually been here before (mostly because we aren't huge expensive pizza fans). This day was different, we decided to go here to get something other than pizza.... We arrived and were greeted quickly and nicely... We got 2 waters and looked over the menu, which for the record is VERY extensive... She ordered the Mediterranean Vegetable Pasta and I got the Grilled Chicken Club (photos attached). I got mine with the ""skinny crisp fries"", which was a great decision. When the food came out (which was very quick) we were asked what else we needed, and he promptly brought ranch, ketchup and BBQ sauce... PROS: Price ($25 w/ tip for both meals), she was able to get a healthy meal, the calories per meal are listed right on the menu, service was prompt and very nice, flavor was decent. CONS: Fries were a bit cold, it was not THE GREATEST flavor I have ever had, fries were a bit cold. A well earned 4 out of 5 stars... We will probably return..."
Bonnie C.,"Los Angeles, CA",112,516,615,4.0,11/8/2012,"Strangely odd having a late lunch/early dinner at 3pm, but they had happy hour at that time. Half off personal pizzas for the win! Their deep dish crusts are fantastic. Uniqueness: All the tomatoes they use are CHUNKY, so if you don't like 'em chunky, you can ask to remove. Pizookies - perfect for those with a sweet tooth. Scoop of vanilla bean ice cream on top of a freshly baked cookie. The Sample Trio gives you the best of all worlds, three mini pizookies."
Chantell L.,"League City, TX",246,275,420,2.0,8/29/2011,"Overall, pretty blah & basic.... It's a brewhouse themed food chain what more do you expect? They definitely ATTEMPT to have character & attitude with their decor and beer selections but it just comes out forced. The food is pretty decent, in my opinion. Its dressed up West-Coast American food with just the right amount of ""fusion"" to mix-it up. They even list the calorie count for the obsessive compulsive amongst us. My visit was on a Sunday around 5. Service was super quick and really friendly so I have no complaints there.  I would come here again if I was feeling lazy, premenstrual and just needed to eat & drink massive amounts of carbohydrates."
Annette F.,"Long Beach, CA",188,209,95,4.0,5/2/2013,"Went to BJ's on my Bday for lunch, was craving fried artichokes & my Wifey wanted my free Bday Pizookie! So it was early and they had just opened (so there were about 3 tables, Incl. us) Dana was our server and she was very nice, we ordered the Artichokes, Deep Dish and Salad.  Our food came and I asked about the artichokes that NEVER came, she forgot to order them...wah wah!  (it's what I wanted most) but I didn't have her place the order because now my food was in front of me. The meal was fine, but obviously I'm upset about not getting my Fried Artichokes (on my Birthday of all days!) Got the old school pizookie which was also very good... This is the smallest BJ's I've ever seen, but it's BJ's and it's good, so I will return :)"
Aryan O.,"Long Beach, CA",111,537,26,3.0,3/16/2012,"Like i said with most of the restaurant franchises on 2nd Street the BJ's here is pretty small. They have all the same food and beer that you would find at any other BJ's, but just really compact. I can only imagine when this place gets busy, where do people wait to be seated, usually they would probably hang outside the place.  But the hand full of times I've been to this place they weren't really that busy. There would be at least 3 more tables instead of us in the restaurant. Like every other restaurant I try and see if they have Jambalaya on the menu, and BJ's does have a pretty good Jambalaya. I was craving a burger this time so I tried the Jalapeno Burger. It usually comes with red onions, fried jalapenos, jack cheese lettuce and tomatoes. I added sauteed mushrooms to my burger and got it with thin cut fries. The fries were surprisingly really good. If they can make the fries into truffle cheese fries than BJ's would have it all! There are TVs around but if you don't sit on a certain spot you will be squinting to see the TV. Other than that give this place a try and don't be discouraged on the small capacity of the place. It's Long Beach by the way so if you don't want BJ's you can always go someplace else."
Kevin P.,"Long Beach, CA",23,45,97,4.0,7/3/2012,"Great food, great service, great prices, relaxing atmosphere. Lunchtime is my favorite time to visit BJ's when I want to break up my day and relax.  I can always count on their consistently great food and service without breaking the bank.  Fantastic lunch specials throughout the week keep me coming back. I try to order something different each visit; today was the Parmesan Crusted Chicken Sandwich!  Some of my favorites are the Lunch Size Pasta & Soup or Salad, Half Sandwich & Soup or Salad or even their famous Mediterranean pizza!  And let's not forget a Nutty Brewnette to wash it all down! Today, the service was top-notch.  Thanks, Brian for making this a welcome and relaxing experience.  We'll be back soon. Wow, I love this place!"
Ken C.,"Oak Forest, IL",142,12,,4.0,4/26/2014,"Good service and good pizza. Pizza came out fast and not too salty.  Beer is good, but could be colder."
Bianca W.,"San Pedro, Los Angeles, CA",217,563,57,2.0,3/28/2013,"This BJ's has to be the worst one ever.  This place should be called Mini BJ's b/c it is about 1/4 the size of a normal BJ's. There are no boothes  and their ventilation/circulation is aweful.  The food was fine, but the seating bothered me."
Myla T.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,17,,2.0,9/2/2013,"I had been with other BJ's Bar , this one has no bar at all. The happy hour schedule is kind a off . This was Saturday afternoon, where in Belmont Shore, all other BARs are serving early for happy hour.  I think the owner of this Bj should look into their schedule for HAPPY HOUR .  Ordered the BBQ Chicken Pizza, I think they can do better with the size compared to its price."
Elizabeth O.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",197,193,63,4.0,1/25/2011,"Before I had to start eating GF, I loved BJ's pizza. I always made it a point to wait in the long line outside the restaurant during the Stroll & Savor events, then take the pizza inside for their seasonal beer specials. The pizza isn't like any other pizza and I would call it a hybrid style crust. It is fluffy and chewy but with a buttery crunch. It reminds me of a pizza back east that I loved (East of Chicago). The other food is good too. The mac & cheese is quite tasty and the salads are always fresh. So when I had to stop eating gluten I had to say goodbye to BJ's pizza. I shed my tears and got over it. That is until they introduced a new gluten free crust option. Now I could go to BJ's with friends and actually get pizza. I was ecstatic and couldn't wait to try it. Some places do GF pizza right and some don't. I am happy to report that BJ's does it right! Cross contamination risk be damned.  They are now my favorite place to get gluten free pizza in the entire Long Beach/Orange County area. The crust is a thin crust (as is typical of GF) but it is crispy and chewy all at once. It actually tasted like real pizza. Plus, you can get a plain cheese or pepperoni pizza for under $10. I opted for the 4+ toppings option for only $13. The pizza was filling and delicious. It really hit the spot and I will definitely be back for more shortly. I would even venture to say that non-glutards would enjoy it too. Top that off with a helping of their gluten free soup (actual, creamy gluten free soup) and a Redbridge beer and you will have a tummy-friendly meal. Something that has always felt strange about the restaurant, given the fact that it is a brewery, is the lack of a bar. When I used to drink here I hated that a you had to sit at a table for a beer, especially since the servers always seem bothered by the fact that you just want beer.  Parking isn't anything to complain about. ALL parking in Belmont Shore sucks. That's why you just pick a spot somewhere, anywhere and stroll along to whatever venue you like. That, in my opinion, is part of the adventure. ""Oohh, ohh, ohh I see a spot right there behind the pink hybrid! Is it big enough? Yes! Score!"""
blue f.,"Long Beach, CA",0,27,1,1.0,5/1/2014,"Wow I should have read the reviews before going here. First warning should have been the place was empty, 2nd they didn't offer us a high chair for our 2 year old should be a given. Last was my raw turkey burger yeah I know I shouldn't even push my luck but it sounded like it might be ok. Just hope my iron lines stomach will not reject the 3 bites I did eat. The waitress took it off the bill and asked if I wanted anything else. The salad I had was good and didn't wish to risk anything  else. Then we went up to pay with the bill in our hand and the girl asked what we needed. Really the bill with my bank card wasn't enough. I told her to have a nice night she looked at me like I was a freak.  Guess I won't be back, just hope I don't relive the raw turkey later tonight."
Felice B.,"Mission Viejo, CA",3,70,,4.0,5/24/2014,"BJ's, I'm trying to put you back on the map. The reviews are so dreadful but my experience was just the opposite. I'm not doubting anyone, mind you, and there's always room for improvement... We were to be strolling the main drag of Belmont Shores and had hoped for a reservation at Nick's on 2nd...which we could not obtain. Our fault. Poor planning.  I do not care for chain restaurants, I cannot stress that enough.  On this particular day it was very hot outside and A/C was a must. None of the trendy spots had theirs on but once my sons spied BJ's it was all over...they HAD to go! My husband nor I had never been so we were game. I'm glad we ventured in. A/C was not on but they were happy to turn it on for us...(were we really the only ones in the vicinity looking to escape the 85 degree weather?) Service was swift and friendly and our food was really good.  I had a parmesan crusted chicken with cheesy potatoes that was served hot and was very tasty. My husband thoroughly enjoyed his fish and chips and my sons each had a mac & cheese starter that they devoured (came with garlic bread of all things!!! - is this where Domino's got that crazy, heinous pasta bread bowl idea??) and they shared a thin crust pepperoni pizza which everyone at the table sampled and enjoyed. I had 2 very good glasses of chardonnay, the rest had soft drinks and the bill was still under $85, excluding a well-earned 25% tip. Here's what could have made it better: Cleaning supplies!!  Cleaning regimen!! Tables, chairs and menus need a thorough cleaning! It was confusing to watch a staffer dusting frames on the wall by the bathroom when the areas where people sit and touch needed some good old-fashioned soap and water. A good vacuuming wouldn't hurt either! I would go back"
Dwayne Y.,"Long Beach, CA",3,52,53,3.0,11/4/2013,"I went for happy hour and got seated immediately. The restaurant was almost empty. There was a mild dirty smell, but not so over powering I'd have to leave.  To drink, I got an iced tea. It had an odd flavor. I'm not sure if it was brewed or from concentrate but it wasn't good. To eat I ordered the sliders from the happy hour menu. Two sliders with ketchup and a pinch of onions. The buns were soft and fresh. I would have liked more onions. The plate also came with shoe string French fries, which weren't very good.  For dessert I ordered a chocolate chip pizookie  with vanilla ice cream and hot fudge. The cookie was baked on the outside, but still gooey in the center. I'm not sure if the center is still raw or just not fully baked but it pretty good mixed on with the vanilla ice cream."
Tricia M.,"Palm Springs, CA",120,38,50,4.0,6/6/2012,"BJ's is a good option to go to when you want a decent tasting deep dish style pizza or any of their other (what seems like) 100+ menu items. I usually stick to the pizza or maybe a burger.  This BJ's location is a smaller sized one, as it is off of 2nd street. It also has a smaller sized menu (thank you) for those with indecisive minds.  The time I came here I shared buffalo chicken pizza and boneless hot wings with my boyfriend. Hot wings were a little spicy, and the pizza was on point served with requested ranch & blue cheese on the side.  Our waiter lagged from time to time, but was generally nice & attentive to our requests for the most part. Besides the minor wait in getting the waiter's attention, the food came out quickly and did not wait to be seated."
Damian W.,"Pike Road, AL",6,134,,4.0,8/7/2012,"The food and beer are both very good. Love the thick crust pizza!!! Great place for kids, I would think, because they have the Pizzookie; a pizza shaped cookie for people to share.  Every server I've had here has been very cool. Never had an issue! Only comlaint is parking, but that's Belmont Shore for you..."
Emm J.,"San Pedro, CA",5,42,4,1.0,11/11/2013,"I have eaten here a few times and never had a huge problem but yesterday I went and the service was completely unacceptable. We were greeted by three people at the hostess stand and were seated quickly but that is the last we saw of anyone, our server NEVER came over to us. There was one person wrapping silverware while another staff member chatted with him as my entire party stared at them hoping they would acknowledge we were ready to order. Two waiters picked up checks near our table but failed to acknowledge us. It was completely ridiculous! We walked out and I wanted to tell the hostess we were leaving because of there extremely poor service but there was nobody at the front desk! I am NEVER coming back here again, my sister told me the service sucked I should have listened."
Ticha B.,"Los Angeles, CA",1102,1623,7645,2.0,9/7/2010,"Small, hard to find parking, no full bar. Same menu minus the full bar drinks. Blahhh."
Robert L.,"Long Beach, CA",4,6,1,1.0,10/18/2013,Worst service ever! Took 10 minutes for server to acknolwedge us and that was only after we spoke with manager. Servers acted as if we were invisible. Walked by and avoided making eye contact! Don't waste your time at this place based upon service alone!! Restaurant was NOT full nor busy.
Stephanie Y.,"San Francisco, CA",21,84,1,2.0,9/10/2012,"This location is BEER AND WINE ONLY. I can not tell you how depressed I was after coming here for brunch only to find out I could not have a Bloody Mary. The service here was a bit lacking and unfriendly. I don't need my server to be my best friend but a smile would be nice. Also, spending your meal fighting away flies is not fun."
