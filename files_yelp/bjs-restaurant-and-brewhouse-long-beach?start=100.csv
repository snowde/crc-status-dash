Olivia H.,"Los Angeles, CA",132,63,31,1.0,8/15/2011,"Oh dear. I hadn't been to a BJs in years and years, and the quality has certainly taken a nosedive. This restaurant itself is nothing to write home about. No bar, which was a disappointment. Small, and lacking in decoration to the point you feel like you're eating in a cafeteria. It was surprisingly packed on a Wednesday night, and we were seated next to a table with 4 kids, although that was almost unavoidable as it was almost all families. I ended up with a kids menu thrown at my head, but whatever. This one star isn't for any of that, its strictly for the food. Looking at the menu (which isn't the full menu on their website), we just kind of took a stab in the dark and hoped for the best. We got an ahi appetizer that was slimy as hell, because we wanted something fresh. This wasn't it.  For our entrees I got fish and chips and he got the chicken parmesan, both of with tasted the same, and greasy. You could just tell that everything you were eating had been frozen. We both took a couple bites and were just over it. Thank god we were eating here on a gift card, I would have been even more bummed out otherwise, but the whole experience was pretty depressing. If you want to feel like one of the huddled masses, I suggest BJs."
Lauren B.,"Long Beach, CA",51,119,6,1.0,12/29/2008,"Uh...wtf? Came here today around 2:30pm on a MONDAY (lunch specials ended at 3). Not sure if it was the intention of the staff to have us not be seated in time to catch the lunch specials or what, but it took about 10 minutes (no joke) for us to be seated. Mind you there were a total of 4 familes eating in the resturant, two waiters, and a manager-looking dude. My friend and I felt as though we were invisible or something, damn! After waving the manager-looking man down, asking for a booth, waiting for him to clean it off, we were seated. We knew what we wanted from the lunch specials menu which had about 5min left for the specials already, but our waiter never came. I again had to wave the manager-looking man down who then replied, ""Oh, your server didn't come yet?"" Anyway we ordered, our food came, but we never had any silverware? I had to ask for these...ok?  Salad sucked. Pizza tasted as though it was doused with Vodka. Chicken tenders were dry. Only good thing was the water.  Thumbs down."
Michelle M.,"Orange, CA",254,264,20,2.0,8/28/2010,"Arrived at BJs for a friends birthday.  The wait was a little longer than promised,  no big deal. But the service was sooo slow.  The food was good but the service definitely brought down the experience.  I'm enjoying the new menu but what's with the gluten free stuff? I generally like BJ's but I'm not so sure about this one. With all the great options on second street, I don't know that I'd come back here. It's kind of cramped, there's no bar or atmosphere. I just dropped this review from a 3 to a 2."
Corie H.,"Queen Creek, AZ",38,61,2,3.0,11/30/2008,"Berry cider is delicious - a little watered down though! Food was okay. The chicago style pizza wasn't up to par, but that's coming from an East Coaster. The restaurant itself is odd. Not a bar/brewery setup at all. It's just a small place on 2nd."
JJ S.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",23,137,3,3.0,3/27/2009,"First time to this BJ's in a box, which describes the single level dining room with only a few booths and typical BJ's decor.  No brewing going on at this location.  No matter, a pitcher of  porter is a good choice, as usual. Wasn't in the mood for pizza, so gave the openfaced chili cheese 1/2 lb angus burger a try, with wedge fries.  Couldn't see the patty under the blanket of chili, which was decent and mild.  Bonus points for not being afraid to put pork in their chili, but a spanking for including pintos, which is merely a chili filler.  Onion rings make a nice topping (for almost anything, don't you think?)  A wedge fry is a wedge fry, but somehow always tasty to me.  Also got a taste of the clam chowder that T started with, which was surprisingly good.  Left with a happy belly."
Torrance W.,"New Orleans, LA",4,36,,3.0,11/28/2009,"I just moved to the Belmont Shore area and I noticed several pizza joints on my walk the day prior. I hadn't had pizza since moving here so I was excited to have several in my backyard...I also wanted to watch football as well. So I make it to BJ's.... There was no one at the hostess stand which forever bothers me. I finally get seated after a minute and then waited 3 minutes to be acknowledged by my server. He turned out to be pretty decent. Here is what I liked: the inside decor, the beer and the dessert. What I thought was just okay: the food. I order BJ's favorite deep dish which just okay. If you have never been to Chicago and had a Chicago style deep dish then the score would be higher but fortunately I have this was was not close. It lacked sauce and wasn't cheesy enough. What I hated: the had football on but no sound. Instead there was music and I hate that. I probably should have went to Legends as I guess I wanted sports over food. Maybe I'll be back..."
Jessica S.,"Clovis, CA",0,40,4,4.0,10/18/2013,"Four stars for a great lady server. She was very sweet, shorter Hispanic women(wish I could remember her name!) we came looking for a place to watch the game as the other bars were pretty crowded and we were getting no service.  We ordered the sliders and ca flatbread pizza.  The sliders were good, the pizza was plain, a few pieces of chicken, avocado, tomatoes, and bacon, just one piece of each item on each slice, disappointed in the flatbread pizza, as we love the pizzas! If your coming to watch any games there is no sound. Only wish we could have watched the game with sound instead of the restaurant music playing.  The host did ask the manager if we could have the volume up on the game as there were only 3 tables in the restaurant, but no.  Was also surprised there was no bar and how small it was inside, were used to a rather large restaurant with a full bar and tv area.  Great server tho!"
Keith S.,"Long Beach, CA",93,143,1,3.0,11/25/2007,"I still giggle like a pre-pubescent boy when I walk in this place.  I can't help that I attach the euphemism.  C'mon, it's funny.  Kind of.  Although I'm not a large fan of the pizza, their yelp-aforementioned and cleverly named ""pizookies"" practically defined weekday night social behavior throughout my college years. Even though they might be to blame for my uncharacteristically large rump, I still attach three stars.  They craft some fine beers and do a respectable job with everything else.  Marginally cute people serve the food and provide decent service.  I don't really know how the cute thing applies, but it used to make the college jaunts a little more entertaining.  Huh huh...it says ""bj's"""
Zizi B.,"Santa Monica, CA",992,238,30,4.0,9/21/2007,"Went here on Tuesday for dinner around 5 or so PM. Good time to come, wasn't too crowded but the music was still annoyingly loud. It could have been the fact that I hadn't eaten a thing all damn day long and was dreaming of pizza since noon, but I thought it was pretty good. We got a pepperoni and pineapple pizza. I really really like the crust and the roma tomatoes that come automatically. Gentleman Friend suggested we get the chocolate chip pazookie. Quite fantastic it was... he's so smart.  Worst part? Tie between the loud music and the ranch dressing on my house salad that tasted like the store brands. Best part? leftover pizza put in the oven until it's all melty and crunchy again.  While I will probably be back, it also motivates me to find the closest thing LA has to offer for ""real"" Chicago style deep dish."
Jennie M.,"Los Angeles, CA",29,82,,1.0,3/2/2010,"Lame. A friend and I went here on a weekday for lunch. We hadn't seen each other in 6 years so we were playing catch up a lot, and planning on staying for a solid 2 hours or so but that didn't happen. First, the place was pretty empty. I think there were at max a half dozen other tables in the time we were there. But our server continued to rush us through our meal. He seemed irritated when he came up to us and we hadn't decided what to order yet...after only a few minutes with the extensive menu. Then we had only had one beer and had gotten our meals 5 minutes before when he dropped off the check! Seriously dude?!?! My friend said to him that we were probalby going to order at least another round of drinks and he had some crap excuse that he ""has to drop off the check within 2 minutes."" What does that even mean?!?! As someone in the service industry, I get that turning tables is important...DURING BUSY SHIFTS. So we ordered another round anyway, and then he redropped the check immediately! It was clear that he was trying to get out the door (although a server switching off at 2pm seems weird but whatever), and it cost them more business.  The food tasted great, was reasonably priced, and the beer was good, but that server totally ruined my experience."
Zee B.,"Chicago, IL",10,53,1,1.0,1/4/2009,"""Your local Pizza Hut with a new name."" This is NOT Chicago style pizza! The pizza they serve is comparable to a thick crust or pan pizza at Pizza Hut. No joke. I'm from Chicago and had my first and LAST experience with BJ's via home delivery. It's extremely greasy, there is no pizza sauce, and it's all dough... barely any of the good stuff!  BJ's is the saddest excuse for what they call Chicago-style deep dish. Bleh."
Dustin B.,"Los Angeles, CA",113,45,71,5.0,4/13/2011,"My first restaurant in Long Beach, moved to LA in the fall, great service, the server treated my party like kings and queen, and oh man, my BBQ Chicken sandwich just melted in my mouth like the sweet autumn LA sunshine melted my soon-to-be-gone New England chill.  The first BJs drink I had was the ""Nutty Brewnette"", and it was like a local Newcastle, very good.  Actually think i had a few... heh.  The atmosphere was pretty cool, kind of a smaller cosy place and the bathroom had a black and white photo of Marilyn Monroe pumping iron, nothing wrong with that I suppose.  I really need to go there again, I had a great time."
Geoff L.,"Long Beach, CA",262,112,36,4.0,6/7/2007,"I have to say, since moving to Long Beach, I really haven't found a great pizza place.  Sure, there's a handful of decent places, but you'd think a city this size with a wonderful variety of restaurants, would have better pizza joints.   I guess part of the problem is that I'm not a huge fan of New York style thin crust pizza, and that seems to be the style of most pizza places in town.  I'll eat it, it's just not my favorite.  I tend to prefer a thicker, richer crust.  I have not found one corn meal crust in the LBC yet, which is a huge shame.  BJ's probably is the closest to the style that I like, and I know... they aren't REALLY Chicago style, but it's pretty close.  They have the right balance of cheese, sauce and crust.  For now, this is my pizza of choice in Long Beach.  The rest of the menu is pretty average.  I get the BBQ beef sandwich on occasion which is not bad.  My advice, stick to the beer, pizza, and appetizers and you'll leave satisfied.   If there's room, those Pizookies are damn addicting.  Try one."
Kealoha V.,"Abilene, TX",1066,454,258,3.0,4/29/2008,"I've had ate at least three different locations, but from this one I have only had food delivered. Each of the three time that I had my food deliverd, my order has always made it to me in the time quoted, which is always something you would hope for when ordering out. With the exception of our most recent order, everything has been as we had asked for. They made the mistake of the type of salad that we wanted, but thankfully my girlfriend loves salads so it didn't cause too much of a problem. I would still order from them again. Now as far as their food is concerned. It's decent. I've tried their various sandwiches, pizzas, and of course their wings. I can't pass up trying a places hot wings. I still don't like the fact that they don't come already sauced, you must do that yourself, which isn't a bother, but still you would like it all done for you when you get your food. The wings themselves are fairly meaty, which is great of course. Their buffalo sauce isn't too bad either. I wish it was a little hotter, but I generally just add some Cholulua and I'm good. Their ranch is decent to. Together it's still better than what you get at other local restaurants.  Their pizzas are made in a deep dish style, which is something that I have never been a big fan of, but they still are enjoyable. I really like their Blackened Chicken pizza which comes with an Alfredo sauce instead of the more traditional tomato sauce. In addition it comes topped with roasted red peppers, green onions, corn and blackened chicken breast. I usually ask for no green onions on mine. Pretty good pizza if you ask me. Last time I ordered a Cheese & Tomato with roasted garlic and Blackened Chicken. Really good, had so much garlic on it.  Finally if you haven't had one before you should at least try it once and that is their pizookie. For those who have no clue what that is, it's a thick cookie topped with vanilla ice cream. You have your choice of chocolate, white chocolate macadamia nut, peanut butter or oatmeal raisin cookies. I personally love the peanut butter. I don't always order this, but it's nice to get everyone once and awhile. I wish I could speak for the location itself, but it's 2nd St, so I can't imagine it being the great of experiences eating at the restaurant itself. I've been to other locations have had long waits, which is why I'll stick to ordering out at this one."
Fergee A.,"Long Beach, CA",21,29,3,3.0,4/18/2009,"Me and my girlfriend came for lunch to find it pretty empty and about only two people working. We waited a bit to get seated and the place is nothing real fancy, they've changed the place around which doesn't make it look appealing at all. Decor is pretty basic and our service was alright.  The food wasn't all that great so one star off and I have to take out a star for the service at the time because the food took a long time and the server didnt really attend to our needs. The spaghetti my gf ordered lacked the marinara sauce but what looked like to be 90% oil and water with 10% being some sort of red sauce.  Bjs is always nice but I like the Cerritos location better for the vibe and its a much bigger place.  If you are on second street, dont make this your first choice but more over a last resort. If you really want to try it, go ahead and do it for experience. Try the pizookie for desert!"
Ashley M.,"Redmond, WA",45,234,33,3.0,7/25/2011,"I've been here many times and the service is hit or miss. If it's near empty,  the service is great. If it's even a little crowded, it takes forever! I don't know anyone who comes here for the beer, so that might be a bad thing for BJ's. I come here for the pizookies. That's really the only worthy food choice here."
Krys G.,"Mission Viejo, CA",240,223,77,4.0,8/9/2007,"This is not the first place I think of when I want pizza, since the BJ's experience is totally different than the typical pizza joint.  Their pizzas are Chicago-style, and one piece can be an entire meal.  We usually choose to avoid their pre-determined pizzas (the white one, the all meat one, etc.) and order as we would a usual pizza with toppings such as green peppers, pepperoni, onions, etc.  I highly recommend that. The pizza comes out piping hot in its own deep dish pan and is covered in great sauce and cheese, but the main attraction for us is the crust (thick and perhaps a bit buttery?) and those fabulous stewed tomatoes on top.  I'm just drooling thinking about it. They have a decent collection of home-brewed beers as well.  I highly recommend the amber ale (if you're a Bass/Sam Adams/Stella drinker - an ale person) and oddly enough, their berry cider is fantastic as well. Very sweet and refreshing.  If you're off the alcohol when you go, they also have great traditional pink lemonade and rim the glass with sugar.  Yum-meh. It's often packed here, and it's not the easiest place to wait with only a few places up front (hence the 4/5,) but if you're feeling the need for the Chicago-style goodness, it's worth the wait."
Quinn M.,"Long Beach, CA",38,192,2,3.0,3/2/2008,"I'm not a big fan of BJ's, but this one did several things well. 1. We were seated immediately on a Saturday night after arriving at 6pm.  A bad sign you say?  Perhaps, but it sure beats standing around outside as people walk by with their dogs and cigarettes. 2. Our server, I think her name was Katie, was really good.  Everything arrived promptly, deliver by HER.  She constantly refilled out waters, asked how we liked our beers, and made herself perfectly available to all of the tables in our area. 3.  My husband liked his pizza, my salad was good, and the price was right.  We had a gift card, which is why we came, but we ended up deciding that this was worthwhile place to spend our money and calories."
Jerry ..,"Long Beach, CA",41,46,7,5.0,8/26/2006,"Another place on the Jerrdog Belmont Shore circuit.  BJ's just makes me feel good.  The buffalo chicken pizza, a ceasar salad, bruschetta, and a pitcher of RED, and it's all good!   BJ's has grown a lot since back in the day.  We used to go to Newport for BJ's, then it finally made it to Long Beach, now they are everywhere. I mean BJs in Redlands and West Covina?  C'mon! Of course, most of the new ones are huge, fancy places with full bars, but I still like the ones on the coast.  Long Beach, Seal Beach, HB, Laguna, that's the BJs I remember.  Of course the new ones all brew their beer, and that's a plus.  At any rate, I will always go to BJs, it's a slice!!"
Christopher B.,"Denver, CO",303,1658,92,2.0,2/26/2007,"I wasn't sure how to rate BJ's. They claim it's Chicago-style but I am not sure they ever had Chicago-style pizza. This isn't even close. However, for California standards it's ok. The beer isn't anything spectular either. Usually pizza and beer goes hand-in-hand with ball games. There are no TVs but music from the 60s playing."
