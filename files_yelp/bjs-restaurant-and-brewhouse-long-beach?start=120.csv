Shannon V.,"Los Angeles, CA",135,338,2140,4.0,11/1/2010,"I like it!  My ""usual"" BJ's is in HB, this one is a lot smaller, I don't like the single bathroom but otherwise it is fine.  I got the new SMALL BITES Shrimp Skewers with sticky rice and steamed broccoli.  It was perfect!  Perfect size, 6 small/medium shrimp with just the right amount of terriyaki sauce, sesame seeds, rice and veg.  Everyone else got burgers (3) and quesadilla (1).  Everyone was in french fry heaven happy happy!   My camera was out of battery since we had spent the day at the Women's Conference (Long Beach Convention Center) and this was the perfect place to unwind and discuss our conference and watch the Lakers!  Thank you mom, thank you sisters."
Aaron F.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",215,424,,3.0,11/7/2010,"The chain is great as well as the food. However, just about every time I go, I get bad service. Don't know what it is about the place. I'll go to a better B.J.'s in the South Bay."
Christine J.,"Provo, UT",127,86,129,4.0,5/7/2008,"I *LOVE* BJ's!!!!  (I feel so dirrty saying that. haha) It's true, though... everything on their menu is DELISH!  Crispy Chicken Sandwich? BOMB.   Grilled Chicken Pasta? BOMB.   Angel Hair Pasta that comes in a huge-ass, Claim Jumper size portion? SUPER BOMB!  And how could I forget their infamous pizookie? Though I must say, their ""BJ's Brownie"" is quite a treat as well! It's basically a brownie version of the pizookie --- soooo good! The only reason why I give this place 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the actual restaurant atmosphere.  This location is pretty small... somewhat cozy, though.  It's on 2nd street in the beloved Belmont Shore, so that kinda takes my mind off any claustrophobic feelings I may get."
Jayme L.,"Long Beach, CA",54,82,2,2.0,10/2/2007,"Not exactly my favorite place to enjoy some pizza and have a relaxing dinner... The food was decent, but it was so loud and crowded I could barely hear myself think. I'll get it to go next time."
Mom Z.,"Anaheim, CA",1,43,9,2.0,10/1/2011,"It was my turn to order and pick up lunch for my office.  Boy was that a hassle.  I had to park a block away from the restaurant since they don't have their own parking lot, and I had to pay for the meter.  I guess it's to be expected since it's on 2nd Street.  I ordered the their cajun chicken pasta.  It literally had 4 THIN slices of chicken, and a whole plate of pasta!  WTH!!!  I don't think all B J's are as tightwads like the one on 2nd Street.  My co-workers have been to other B J's and they said their portion are way smaller than other B J's.  As far as the taste itself...well I've had better!"
Mike B.,"Long Beach, CA",12,19,4,4.0,1/24/2010,"I read some of the reviews about this particular BJ's and for the reason a lot of yelper's didn't like this place, I love it. It's true, It's not your ordinary BJ's. It's pretty small, there is no walk up bar or oversized tv screens. But...also there is no 45min to 1 hour wait to be seated. There is no groups of 15+ high school kids yelling and talking on cell phones. They have the same menu as any other BJ's and the same home brewed beer. It will be just fine with me if you all keep rating this place low and keep the crowds away. I love this BJ's and want to be able to keep going without the crowds that you find in every other BJ's in So Cal."
Robyn E.,"Oakland, CA",47,81,,4.0,9/8/2006,Pepperoni and cheese calzone for one AND a Blonde/Hard Cider split-- that's all I have to say. DAMN TASTY...*drools* ... oh I miss this place when I want a taste of home
Holly T.,"Philadelphia, PA",388,698,1217,3.0,7/8/2006,"Time to re-review this place, since my original review was one of my early ones and really didn't do this place justice.  By now, everyone is familiar with BJ's, and it has even entered the world of hated corporate chains. Well, it wasn't always like that. Back in the day, BJ's was just a local hole in the wall place, with locations in a couple SoCal beach towns. It started in 1978 in Santa Ana, and even in 1996 when the first brewery launched in Brea, there were only 7 locations along the coast, just simple little pizza joints, and this was one of them, which I was introduced to in the early 1990s. In college we just knew it as a place to get some pizza and pizookie, either here in LB, HB, or the now-closed Seal Beach location. So this Long Beach location sort of represents what BJ's used to be. If you're used to the newer, big, huge fancy BJ's, this place will probably come across as a dump. They have put in some new plasma screens, but other than that it's not too fancy, it's pretty small, and it hasn't changed much over the years. It doesn't even have a bar, though of course you can order BJ's signature beers here. Since the beers aren't brewed on premises, though, the quality suffers slightly, and they rarely feature any special brews (stop trying to pass off Nutty Brewnette as a special! It's on the regular menu at other BJ's!). (By way of contrast, the brewer at the BJ's in Chandler AZ comes up with some amazing seasonal brews that win awards at local brewing competitions. There is nothing special going on with the beers at this location, though.)  I like the pizza here, but even more than the deep dish, I really like their thin crust appetizer pizzas. If you don't like thick crust, you really should check these out. Also, I really like several of their salads. It's probably the only place I would ever consider ordering a salad as a meal, since I am really not a salad person, but these are really filling. Their beer... I used to really like it. It's still a million times better than the macrobrewed junk you get at other bars, and it's better than a lot of the local microbrews as well (BBC, for example). Their Jeremiah Red, Porter, Imperial Stout, and Hefeweizen are all good, reliable brews. You can get sampler sets for a very reasonable price. I wouldn't place these among the great beers of the world, but for Long Beach, you won't find much better. I do NOT recommend this place for pizza delivery, though; the wait is far too long to make it worthwhile.  Service here is usually pretty decent, and since it's open until 11pm on weeknights and midnight on weekends, it's one of LB's few dining options after 9:00pm, so cheers to that. If you're looking for a bigger, fancier BJ's, the closest one is in Cerritos."
Harry H.,"Long Beach, CA",362,180,8,5.0,5/16/2007,"I LOVE BJ'S! I really do.  The food has always been great from the pizzas which you can pretty much have it your way.  If you've never been to any BJ's this is one of the first things you will have to get! The spinach and artichoke dip is one of the best ones I've had anywhere... The beers are good but not best micro crafts you'll find but they are better than a lot of the crap out there... I'm talking to you ""crudwieser!"" If you're in the mood for something light and crisp in the booze selection try the berry cider... world famous if you ask me... so famous its usually sold out but if you can get your hands on it, DO IT! to top it all off you will have the amazing always so rich and mouthwatering cookie or brownie topped with a fat scoop of french vanilla ice cream called a pazookie!!!! you'll love the food and the price is right and the beers offer a great rescue from the stuff you'll find elsewhere... staff is cool and you can ask for crayons and a activity pad if you're really bored... go have food and beer and you'll be happy again!"
Albion R.,"Petaluma, CA",116,378,15,1.0,1/27/2008,"yuck. ick. I don't do fast food joints and I'd take one any day over this place. the best thing about them is free iced tea refills. the worst thing about them? I haven't got the space or time to detail. if you're in this neighborhood, go to Riley's across the street instead."
Alice C.,"Los Angeles, CA",218,260,106,4.0,10/7/2006,"They are famous for their pazzuci (can't spell, sue me) which is a dessert consisted of fresh, baked cookie of your choice topped with vanilla ice cream.  DELICIOUS!  Everyone I know, loves it!  Other than that ... they're pizzas are 'okay.'  I've had better.    The 4 stars is for that ONE dessert.  [stars and comments are subject to change with each visit (^_^) ]"
Leslie C.,"Long Beach, CA",68,98,7,3.0,3/29/2008,"I usually like BJ's overall but for some reason this particular location I consistently get horrible service.  Either service has been slow or the server wasn't attentive.  I guess I keep hoping the service will be better, but I have come to the realization that if I really want a pizookie, I will need to make the drive to another BJ's. Some of the items that I really like on the menu:  Santa Fe Salad with Chicken, any of their pizzas or burgers and of course the pizookie"
Walter G.,"Long Beach, CA",2,56,1,2.0,9/26/2007,"Went on a very loud Wednesday night. Highlights from several games were being shown on the TVs, and a rather annoying selection of music was blaring over the sound system. I ordered their version of a hawaiian pizza, and it tasted just like... a pizza. Nothing special, very mediocre. The beers are over-priced and under-tasty; imagine if Coors made 7 different beers. There chips and salsa appetizer is pretty great. $5 gets you a huge plate of multi-colored chips and some mighty tasty salsa, enough for 2 or 3 to snack and save room for a loaf of bread with stuff on it. I doubt I'll go back."
Christine R.,"San Diego, CA",89,145,,2.0,1/31/2008,"Pretty standard average chain restaurant.  I actually liked the pizza I had quite a bit, the crust was esp good and not too too too much, like deep dish can sometimes be.  And I loved the added Roma tomatoes that were thrown on.   Our service was poor...on a slow night no less.  A 6 top came in right after we did and I think that flummoxed our server and brought on his weak service but, that's a reason, not an excuse buddy boy. I was super bummed that the famed pizookie wasn't presented with a bit of pomp and/or circumstance.  Two scoops of vanilla haphazardly tossed onto a cookie does not aesthetically pleasing make.  AND the table behind us got cherries on their pizookie.  Ours stood completely nude.   I wouldn't necessarily recommend for or against.  I'm sure some college kids and regulars like it and that's fine and dandy.  But it's nothing that stands out to me, and nothing that I would go out of my way for."
Antonio C.,"Downey, CA",6,62,,4.0,6/8/2008,"Pretty good, the food, beers and service are just fine. Good for a weeknight.  Then u can go for a stroll in Belmont Shore, nice shops and bars."
Beth F.,"Redondo Beach, CA",14,171,16,4.0,12/30/2007,"Okay, first of all the best thing about BJ's is the pizookie (as everyone else has said).  I drove from Redondo just to get the friggin' Peanut Butter Pizookie...yep I have no life - dragged my 3 kids + nanny too!  The pizza is fair - not exactly Chicago style but different from other California styles. The onion straws used to be killer but now they are just onion rings...don't know what happened there but that's their bad. All I can say is get the flippin' pizookie, k?"
Michael D.,"Long Beach, CA",34,21,6,3.0,3/2/2010,"Upon this review I recieved a call from the general manager, with sincerest apologies.  They asked me to come back in, on them.  I will say it was a much improved meal, but I will not be ordering take out from there still anytime soon."
Jory O.,"Long Beach, CA",2,6,,2.0,5/25/2012,Great beer. Terrible food.
Alystar M.,"Beverly Hills, CA",75,20,,5.0,3/2/2010,"I love this place. The Pizza is great! The waiter I usually get is polite, on the ball, and is kind to my kid. Sometimes we have to wait for a seat but I really love eating here. I have never been left waiting, it does get busy though. Thank God there is no bar, I don't mind bars but not in my restaurants. And it's very clean."
Sophia N.,"Los Angeles, CA",66,61,23,4.0,11/1/2009,"This is the smallest BJ's I've been to! I wish there was more booth tables here. The food quality is the same as any other BJ's and the service is fine. I loved the medium pizza, 2 soups and/or salads, and a pizzookie for under 25 some dollars deal. Very cool."
