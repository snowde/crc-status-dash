Davidius F.,"Long Beach, CA",4,17,6,2.0,6/3/2008,"Et Tu Bj's? Alright... it breaks my heart to do this, but I have to give Bj's a score of 2 stars. I *want* to give Bj's a better score because they have totally awesome pizookies (really big freshly baked cookies topped with ice cream) which one can combine with some decent coffee to make an excellent desert. I have to say here that Bj's is one of the only restaurants on Belmont shore that has decent coffee that isn't a coffee shop. I have had dinner here perhaps on 8 - 10 different occasions over a 2 year period. On one such occasion, my girlfriend and I were dining, and noticed that a bunch of fratboys at the table across from us were being pretty rowdy. Hey it's all good, we're all here to have a good time right? Well, after the frat boys were being rowdy for an especially long time, my girlfriend and I began to notice that  the ruckus wasn't just with the frat boys but with some of the other patrons as well. But, again, as long as everyone is having a good time right...RIGHT?? Wrong. We realized what was going on while walking out of the restaurant (after a lovely meal, minus the over all commotion, etc...) because a very large (but innocent looking) RAT jumped out of one of the booths in front of us!!! What transpired next was like something I've never seen in a restaurant. A busboy ran after the rat in between tables and patrons with a plastic lid of some kind, THROWING it at the rat trying (in vain) to trap it underneath, all the while also apologizing to the customers, and trying to keep things calm. It would have been sooo hilarious, if you know... I hadn't just eaten. Believe it or not, I gave Bj's the benefit of the doubt, and have returned since to eat there again. I've worked in the restaurant business for a long time and know that exceptions happen.  However, I ordered a pizza (half artichoke half BBQ) at around 9:30pm, because I go into work for the overnight shift and wanted something to eat before work (it's the equivalent of breakfast for me). Anyhow, I don't know if it was because the were getting ready to close the kitchen or what, but on my way to work my girlfriend opened up the pizza box, and inside were some of the toppings *underneath* the pizza. The resulting scenario was the soggy bottom to a pizza box that got on my girlfriends pants and part of her shirt. And the piece de resistance? It wasn't cooked all the way through.   So sorry to say, but 2 mistakes of this caliber out of our 10 visits isn't a very good record, and my poor tummy can't take this kind of punishment - especially not for the $30 I paid ($25 pizza + $5 tip). I wanted it to work out, I really did. I'll always think of your yummy honey mustard chicken salad, the great pizookies and coffee, and we can still be friends right? I just think it's best that we see other people for awhile."
Nick M.,"Mākaha, HI",5,36,,1.0,8/17/2009,"There is really nothing good about this place.  First off, if you're looking for something similar to a Chicago-style deep dish, turn around and run.  This place is nothing like Gino's or Lou's.  The deep dish here is hard to describe; the only word that comes to mind is unpleasant.  There aren't enough toppings, the pizza was burnt on the top and it was hollow and full of air.  The service leaves something to be desired as well.  Even the decor of the place is boring.  If you're looking for a place to grab a bite on 2nd St. in this area there are 30 other places in a half mile radius that would be better."
Lane K.,"Long Beach, CA",34,104,16,2.0,7/21/2009,"Ya know, I want to like this place but just really don't. I know the pizza is Chicago style (deep dish) but I always feel like I'm eating a bunch of bread with hardly anything on it. It's so dry! Where's the sauce? Plus the seating is way too cramped in this location and the service is so-so. I've gotten great servers and I've gotten lame ones. They get one star for their Berry Cider and one for the Pizookie and that's about it."
Jay P.,"San Clemente, CA",2,67,,3.0,9/15/2009,"I'm from Chicago, definitely not authentic stuffed pizza pie, however, their selection of pizza's are robust and tasty.  definitely worth checking out."
Rocio S.,"Long Beach, CA",0,28,,2.0,10/9/2010,"I love BJ's Restaurant and have been to my fair share of different locations here in SoCal and in NorCal, but this one really needs to step it up in the customer service dept. One of the first times I came here with a friend, there wasn't a hostess in the front to greet us and it was a little busy so it was understandable. So we sat down on the bench. We were waiting for about 5 mins, then the hostess came back to her post, gave us one look, and completely ignored us. We thought maybe she's a little busy right now and she'll talk to us when she's ready to take us in. She was only there for about 2 mins then left. So we waited a little longer, then a group of 3 walked in, waited along with us. The hostess came back 30 seconds after they walked in, greeted them and immediately sat them. The group looked at us as if not knowing if we were waiting to be seated or just sitting there like dumbasses. After this, we left. Being ignored twice when we really wanted to come eat here was really unacceptable and I wasn't going to give my money to a place that doesn't give a damn about their customers.  Another time I came here, was with 2 different friends. They really wanted to come eat here, but I was a little if-y from my first experience. We were greeted and customer service on the hostess and servers part was ehh mediocre, nothing special whatsoever. They brought out waters and we ordered beer, but when he brought them out he forgot mine. I thought he was going to go back to and bring mine but after 10-15 mins of him not showing up I had to order again. First of all, it wasn't even that busy for him to forget that. We were pretty hungry, so we ordered salads, spring rolls for appetizers, and pizza of course! Our salads were brought out immediately. Then we waited, and waited, and waited, and waited and no appetizer. I know it takes awhile to make pizza but that's why we wanted appetizers while we waited for the pizza. So after a VERY long wait (and I'm not exaggerating it was like 20 mins) our pizza came out. Hmm, that's strange. Isn't the appetizer suppose to come out before the main dish? So my loud friend makes a comment about how funny that the pizza came out before the appetizer. Then the server all of a sudden realized that we had also put in an order for spring rolls. This experience was just as crappy as the first one and I didn't even eat there the first time! Let's just say he didn't get a very good tip and he didn't treat us very well either. He kept ignoring us, forgetting our orders, it was just all a mess. I really like BJ's and other locations I've been to, but this one just does not deliver whatsoever. If you're big on customer service like me, go to a different BJ's that actually cares about their customers and you'll enjoy your meal a lot more. But if you're just hungry, then go ahead, come to this one. Just don't get mad when they screw up your order or forget things."
Big D H.,"Long Beach, CA",15,70,,2.0,11/13/2011,"The food is terrible, I ordered fish tacos for lunch and I got a couple of fish sticks hidden in  tortilla.  I was still hungry so I went home and ate afterward.  The waitress and staff were nice but the again the food is sub par unless you want to gag on a 2000 calorie pizza."
Van M.,"West Hollywood, CA",122,550,16,2.0,5/7/2008,"i came here for one thing only: the pizookie.  it sucked. it was not cooked thru.  a la mode made me only slightly happier.  i guess if u really love cookie dough, then it's coo. but i ordered a pizza cookie god dammit! u don't order a pizza and get uncooked crust! so u don't order a pizza cookie and get an uncooked cookie! anyways, the beer and bar food is wut it is...beer and bar food. this particular location also seems kinda small and claustrophobic."
Suze Q.,"Long Beach, CA",1,76,2,3.0,8/13/2011,"While it's true that this location is much smaller and lacking a bar, I still enjoyed my visit. Our server was very nice and quick with our drinks and order. As a matter of fact, all the employees were very helpful, getting us refills when our server was busy and serving us our pizza. We had the Mediterranean pizza (no chicken!) and it was really yummy. It has sundried tomatoes, kalamata olives, feta and pepperoncinis. I noticed that they've updated the menu since I was last here (which was, like, 3 years ago). They've added some new items that sound really delish, like an ahi appetizer, gourmet mac and cheese, mini bruschetta and stuffed mushrooms etc....I wanted to try one of the new dishes but we came in with a craving for pizza and avocado egg rolls; guess we'll have to come back to try some new items. We also tried the new Red Velvet Pizookie; it was good, but not amazing. A little too sweet; I'll stick with the White Chocolate Macadamia Nut...mmmmmm."
Jennifer H.,"Lakewood, CA",11,257,20,2.0,11/17/2008,"This particular location of BJ's is quite odd.  Being located on 2nd Street, I assumed it would be complete with a full drink menu, but it is not!  On my last outing here, a friend ordered a martini, and was informed that they don't have a bar, so it's beer and wine only.  What's up with that?!  Another odd thing about this location is the setup of the dining area.  It's basically one square room that is overcrowded with tables.  There were a few TVs on, and the overall ambience was...hectic? Here's a rundown of my last visit: I called ahead to get a table while we were on the way there, and they were happy to oblige.  Our table was ready within a couple minutes of our arrival.  Although it looked strange in there, we were quite pleased with the quick seating on such a busy Saturday evening.  Unfortunately, the quick service ended there.  Our entire party of 6 was ready to order loooong before we got waited on.  We had to ask for water and place settings.  Once our order was taken, we waited for a long time.  We started noticing other tables that were seated long after ours getting their pizzas while we sat with empty water glasses.  Once the food arrived, my pizza was delicious.  For others, the food wasn't as great.  Two burgers were ordered well-done, and they arrived pink in the middle.  One of them was supposed to come with bacon and cheese, but it was plain.  RThis led to a manager coming to our table to apologize.  Rather than sending them back, the guys agreed to eat them as is, and asked not to be charged for the missing toppings on the burger.  The waiter said ""No worries.""  We finished dinner and had Pizookies, which were very good.  When the bill finally came, the waiter did not split it as he agreed to do at the very beginning.  In the end, one of the Pizookies was free, and the messed up burger was comped as well, but the experience was still not good. Other locations are quite spectacular compared to this one.  Go elsewhere if possible."
Michael D.,"Port Hueneme, CA",76,50,11,2.0,5/31/2011,"fucking small as fuck,bitch take forever to give the tab,the sandwich was fuckking bomb,stupid ass bitches all around me i though tit was way bigger but it wasn't"
Scott K.,"Buena Park, CA",19,42,1,3.0,9/29/2006,"The beer is, how do you say, elementary and way overstated.  But I'm a craft beer fanatic.  The pizzas aren't that great (weird crust) but the salads are pretty tasty.  I like the one with the nuts.  The place is smaller than a normal BJ's, and the carpet smells like a hundred spilled beers.  Still, pretty good overall if you don't want to venture out of Long Beach for the night."
Justin O.,"Palm Desert, CA",0,2,,1.0,6/30/2013,"Worst restaurant experience I've ever had. Place was completely packed but got seated right away however it took 35 mins to get menus and drinks which we had to ask for... Ordered appetizers which arrived cold..,  the section we were in I noticed there was one waitress helping all of the table around us but she never even tried to come help our table and she seemed like she was really chatty with the other tables so if she could hold a conversion with other table then she could take a few minutes to come help our table...In fact it seemed like she was avoiding our table. overall it took them an hour and 30 mins for them to bring our actual meal and when it arrived it was soggy and tasted worse than fast food. will never come back to this so called restaurant, because of the terrible service from that waitress. I wish we told the manager about her, she shouldn't be working there with that kind of attitude. It was extremely rude."
Erin N.,"San Pedro, CA",156,223,55,3.0,7/30/2008,"Everyone I know loves BJs. The pizza is good, the salad is good and the pizookie is great. It's the only restaurant I order desert at. The service was so slow and the wait for the food is pretty long but cider and company makes it much more enjoyable."
Anne G.,"Long Beach, CA",0,24,,2.0,10/20/2008,"The alfredo pizza and the crunchy chicken sandwich are very good.  However, the last time I ordered delivery, I was told it would take about 45 minutes.  The pizza arrived about an hour and a half later, and I had to call them to ask where it was.  Plus they put a 15% tip on automatically, so I was forced to tip on bad service.   I might go back one day to eat at the restaurant, but not for delivery."
Beatriz R.,"Arcadia, CA",7,72,15,2.0,5/17/2012,i love bjs but this one is not the business... i have ordered twice here. both lunch specials.. the first time i ordered i made it clear that i wanted the lunch special for their chicken sandwich. when i got there they were trying charge me full price which was like $15. they were arguing with me for a couple of mintues then then gave in and gave me the lunch speacial i originally ordered.. the second time i ordered it was the lunch special salad... it looked so yummy online so i ordered it.. i guess they remembered me from the last time.... so i payed almost $10 for the weakest salad ever!! they put 3 pieces of small chicken and gave me so little lettuce.. i was so pissed when i opened the box.... WTF! you would think for $10 they would give you a good salad but NO... i would have been more satsified with a salad from jack in the box.. im so dissapointed in this bjs... they are usually known for their good portions and customer service.. i guess not this one :'(
Jason I.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,19,1,4.0,8/6/2008,"Great pizza spot. I like this place a lot because I like Chicago style pan pizza, I don't understand why people rave over New York pizza instead of Chicago style. I have been here a few times and learned a medium can feed a few people and pizooki is one of the best deserts I have ever had. I have never had a bad experience here, I have always been seated quickly and have received my meal in a reasonable time frame."
Taylor W.,"Long Beach, CA",45,37,,5.0,3/11/2009,"This place is really good!  Try the weird pizza with spinach and cream cheese, it's the best!  Not too expensive either, I usually get a beer (the Hefeweizen is pretty good), and the bill (with me an my girlfriend usually runs about 20-30."
Richard G.,"Long Beach, CA",4,7,,4.0,3/27/2009,What is there to say.....The place was nice and the food was killer.  I had the ANGUS ROAST BEEF DIP.  This is the best beef dip I have ever had.  I would recommend this place to anyone. Great place to have dinner and take a walk for some coffee or other great treats.
Julie B.,"Long Beach, CA",5,29,,2.0,11/11/2009,"I know that reviewing a huge chain restaurant like BJ's is kind of unnecessary as most people have been to one and if you've been to one, you know exactly what the food is going to taste like at all of them. But, this review is specifically of the 2nd Street location because it is remarkably...un-BJ's-ish. (It's my review, I can make up words if I wanna) I have been to BJ's in Burbank many, many times as it was my favorite place to watch Dodgers games when I lived in those parts. The food was never great but was usually good and it was more about the bar and the huge TVs and the big comfortable booths that easily fit 10 people.  The BJ's on 2nd street has none of those things. It's really strange to me that they chose to put this restaurant in that space because it just kind of doesn't work. It's tiny, there are hardly any booths and for a place that is marketed as a place to go drink beer and watch sports, there was no bar and very small TVs that were mounted waaay too high for their size.  We went there for dinner earlier tonight. When we arrived at 6:30 there were only a few tables that were occupied but no host at the front and we stood there, dumbly, waiting for someone to acknowledge us for a good 15 minutes. Several servers and bussers looked at us, knew we were there but didn't say anything to us. Finally, a delivery guy on his way out the door with an armload of pizzas came and pointed us to a table. The service was fine after that but it wasn't a good start. My mom got the appetizer Marguerita pizza which she enjoyed. I got the bacon sourdough burger with fries which was horrible. The fries were so greasy that liquid spurted out with every bite and coated my tongue with a disgusting film. The meat of the burger was fine but the bun, which was actually just thick, sourdough sandwich bread was heavily buttered to the point that even after pressing a napkin into it to soak up some of the grease it was almost wet feeling in my mouth. Paired with the fries, it was way too much for me (and I'm pretty tolerant of greasy, I did order a bacon cheeseburger) and I gave up after less than half of the burger and only a handful of fries.  Having abandoned my dinner, I ordered a white chocolate macadamia nut Pizookie because there is just no way to f$%# up gooey, barely baked warm cookie dough topped with vanilla ice cream. It made the trip worthwhile and earned the extra star.  I can see going back for the Pizookie and the beer but certainly not for the food or the atmosphere. One last word of advice, the seasonal Pumpkin Ale tastes pretty good, sweet with just a hint of spice, dark, nutty and smooth BUT it is only 4% alcohol by volume which is really quite low for beer. So, if you are planning to order a beer for the nice, warm, relaxing feeling that it usually gives- don't order this one."
Shannon J.,"Long Beach, CA",26,7,12,1.0,7/17/2009,"I have been a Belmont Shore resident for 4 years and I always support our local restaurants but this time I had 2 picky nephews with me that wanted BJ's. Against my better judgment I gave in and we went. Service was fine, food was typical chain restaurant blah. That night I paid with my fiance's  card and when I got home I realized I left it at the restaurant. I phoned ahead spoke with the manager and she told me to bring the card holders ID with me and I could pick up the card. When I returned to the restaurant the manager wouldn't give me the card quoting corporate policy that the owner had to come in person and get the card. I told her I spoke with her on the phone and she said I didn't know you would come.  I also told her the waitress could ID me that I left the card there. Talk about being made to feel like a criminal, the bill was $20 and she still  wouldn't return the card I had to go home and get my fiance even though I had called ahead to check. This is why you don't go to chain restaurants because they don't care. This would never have happened at one of my local restaurants because the owners take the time to get to know you and your family, and make you feel proud to live in such a family community. Take my advice avoid the chain restaurants you will get way better food and avoid the corporate policy!"
