Shannon W.,"Long Beach, CA",0,7,,3.0,10/19/2009,"My husband and I go here often as we live just down the street.  I have to say it is hit or miss most of the time.  There are a few really good servers who have been there a long time and always give good service but if you don't get one of the three of them, you are kinda screwed, orders get mixed up, the bill takes forever to come, etc.  Recently we have had good luck but in the past we have had trouble with being quoted a certain amount of time to wait and having it take much longer (like a half an hour longer).  Overall you get what you expect from a chain restaurant."
