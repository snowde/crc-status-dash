Michael Z.,"Yorba Linda, CA",3,20,20,3.0,3/29/2014,"Food tastes just like any other bjs, but this is a smaller restaurant. There's only street parking and no valet. Came here for a friend's birthday with a party of 10, we waited for 30 minutes ( not too bad ). No bar section here but they do have all the beers on tap. Two star subtraction because the service was slow and they're understaffed. Also it took us 20 minutes just to look for parking."
Alli F.,"Ajax, Canada",58,110,80,5.0,10/7/2012,"Delicious deep dish pizza without all the grease.  I love the BJ Special and we had them move the mushrooms to my side and green peppers to my husband's which they did perfectly.  Perfect amount of cheese.  I love it when the server actually digs out the first piece for you and everyone at the table with a big pie wedge server. The great service we received gives them their 5th star (in addition to the server, the manager stopped by, too, then gave us a discount card on our way out).  A great experience this September at a place I frequented when I lived here."
Michelle G.,"Long Beach, CA",19,24,1,2.0,6/26/2014,They don't have vodka and ran out of cider during my visit. It's also significantly smaller than other BJ's Restaurants.
Michelle B.,"Anaheim, CA",19,5,9,1.0,6/15/2014,"We got seated right away, sat there for 15 minutes and no one even noticed us. No one came buy to get us our drinks, no hello my name is ______ I'll be your server tonight, no one said s*%^! We left. Awful. Waste of time."
Gabby A.,"Long Beach, CA",119,269,9,3.0,7/27/2011,"So I finally tried this place. BJ's is one of those places that I just never felt a need to try. But ended up at in part due to the company I was with. If it was up to me I would have had Indian food for dinner instead but I was with a picky eater and this was safe enough for them. Should have read Yelp reviews but sometimes its not possible.  Anyhow...unlike many Yelpers before me I actually had very good service. The waitress was friendly and very attentive. We were seated upon arriving and the drinks came out pretty quickly. I ordered a chopped salad...I know, pretty dumb to not order their specialty which is pizza but I guess I wasn't that hungry. Oh and I gotta say that the salad was just ok...I now realize that I hate chopped salads. They seem messier and less satisfying than regular salads.  I gotta say that this particular BJ's needs major work both physically and emotionally. It seems so sad and abandoned compared to other locations."
Matt H.,"Long Beach, CA",5,23,3,4.0,5/20/2014,"I went into this establishment at 10:57pm, which closes at 11pm. The manager, Stephanie gladly took my order of a medium buffalo chicken pizza (which for the record is the best buffalo chicken pizza I've ever had in my life). I was amazed at how happy she was to serve me so close to closing time and even waited for me personally to come back and pick up the wonderful pie of deliciousness. I would highly recommend this location to any BJ fans!!! Stephanie could possibly be the best restaurant manager on 2nd Street!"
Bryan S.,"Miami, FL",352,121,141,4.0,8/25/2013,"Who doesn't love a loaded giant baked potato?  Service was great, and the food was tasty."
Sean L.,"San Pedro, CA",0,2,1,5.0,10/12/2013,This Bj's is by far the best one I've been to. The food is amazing the staff is friendly and make you feel like you're at home. The management is on point. I had the pleasure of talking with the GM Jen Black. She was very professional and attentive. I will only go back to the Long Beach Bj's just because of the service.
Donald G.,"Long Beach, CA",83,188,26,4.0,4/24/2012,I think this is the only place I get deep dish pizzas at. Not that I search for it but I always get it here. They are really good though. I like this place and the service. Pretty solid establishment.  The decor is okay and about as average as it gets for a pizza spot.
Corey P.,"Long Beach, CA",141,57,7,2.0,7/27/2013,"not the best BJ's this location has WAY too many tables in such a small space.  Seated in the corner, then they seated a couple practically on top of me, literally i was hitting my arm on the other ladies chair.... they could def use a remodel, and re-arrange the seating."
Lia S.,"Long Beach, CA",8,1,,1.0,8/23/2013,"Very turned off by a call back from the manager after I placed a delivery order tonight. I was asked at time of order if we were within a 3 mile distance. We are actually only 2 miles.  She called to say we were too far and could not deliver. When I tried to explain that we were in the radius she said we were ""close to the traffic circle"". What does that even mean?!  Is my business of less value than people who live only 1 mile from the store? So rude. Will not be ordering from here again."
Holly H.,"Long Beach, CA",49,26,22,5.0,7/15/2013,"I really like this BJs and I am giving it a five star because of the 5 or so times I've been here, I've had friendly service and I really like the manager, Amanda!  She's very nice!  I love the soups and salads and pizza, however, we havent had much luck with other menu items, like chicken, for example.  So my advice would be to just stick to the items i listed and the appetizers and u are good to go!  Which isnt bad since their pizzas especially are delicious.  I also highly recommend the watermelon feta salad, tomato mozzarella salad, and broccoli cheese and chkn tortilla soups.  If youre going gluten free, the gluten free pizza is awesome too! I also like the environment here, small and cozy. :-) Have never had to wait to be seated although I am sure some days it gets pretty crowded."
Vonnie S.,"Los Angeles, CA",97,328,519,4.0,9/25/2011,"While this place is tiny, I am giving them extra love for taking care of us on a busy Saturday night.  Our family stopped by this locale late on a Sat after a CSLBU volleyball game.  Our party had over 20 people and they really worked with us to make sure we were seated in 15-20 minutes.  Our tables were split up but we were all in yelling distance of one another. The service was great as well and they were extremely quick.  The only downside was that the parking in this area is street parking.  This areas is filled with tons of other restaurants and businesses and parking can be a bit tricky.   The other down side is this place only sells wine and beer and while they might show the full on BJs menu, they don't have everything available.  They also ran out of a few of the popular menu items so that was a bit annoying as well. Overall, great atmosphere and friendly folks."
Ruyi W.,"Lakewood, CA",2,17,8,3.0,9/5/2013,Omg.  This place discriminate short women.  The mirror in the bathroom was way too high.  I am 5'4 and can only see my forehead when I tiptoed. Minus one star for sure.
George A.,"Pico Rivera, CA",14,13,79,1.0,4/11/2011,Make sure when you come here you have a valid ID other wise they won't serve you alcohol don't they have to worrie about your age?????? It was really upsetting and dumb you can tell my friend was over 21 what was the big deal wasn't cause it wasn't a California I'd I know for a fact a cap would of take that and I really think the server and the manager were a bit races towards us cause we Mexican and we were in a white people crowd I will never go back
Blanch V.,"Long Beach, CA",51,7,,4.0,8/25/2011,"Growing up in the Inland Empire BJ's was one of the few restaurant choices in town. By my senior year of high school I was burned out on both BJ's and chain restaurants all together. Since high school I have left the IE, expanded my horizons along with my culinary palate.  A few months ago I was biking along 2nd street and came across this BJ's and decided to give it a try and boy was I surprised and glad I did. The staff along with the food was excellent. I have been back 3 times since. I don't know if it's nostalgia or what but I've enjoyed each of my visits to BJ's and will back again soon."
Lizz K.,"Los Angeles, CA",633,232,973,1.0,11/23/2010,I had a wilted salad and the avacado eggrolls gave me food poisoning for 4 days. worst pain you will ever have. maybe it was because i came in an hour or two before closing time that the food was so gross? i prefer cpk
Chad S.,"Long Beach, CA",40,10,,1.0,4/23/2011,"Bad Service.  My wife and I have tried this location three times.  Two times, it was almost an hour after we sat down that our food finally arrived.  Once we went in for dessert only, got a table right away, and sat there for 20 minutes with no water or menu brought to our table,  We actually just walked out and ate somewhere else.   I like the BJ's chain and the Pazookie is always a great treat.  But, do yourself a favor and visit the BJ's in Cerritos.  This Long Beach branch has such terrible service that the food becomes irrelevant."
Cathy N.,"Long Beach, CA",507,499,148,4.0,12/28/2010,"YUM! I always enjoy BJ's... ha! :) No, but really - love the deep dish pizzas, honey mustard chicken salad, bruschetta appetizer, and pazookies. GRUB! This location is seriously miniature compared to others, but eh, I don't really mind. I wouldn't recommend trying to bring in large groups here! Maybe just 2-5 people."
Emmanuel C.,"San Marino, CA",331,97,14,4.0,11/3/2013,"This is small version of most bjs that ive seen, but the lack of customers makes the service here great but at the same time the minimal amount of workers here shows how little business this place gets.  Even with happy hour prices and deals, this place is still pretty overpriced.   Ordering the sliders u get only two small burgers with even smaller patties than the buns.  The margherita flatbread is flavorful and good for 4 bux.  The mini deep dish pizza is all fluffy bread and little of cheese and sauce, for 6 bux this is a major rip off, im sorry but I know for a fact that this place is losing money everyday they're open."
