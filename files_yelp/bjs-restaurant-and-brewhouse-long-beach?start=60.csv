JacqueLin O.,"Long Beach, CA",343,189,138,2.0,9/20/2010,"We had a craving for Pizza and could NOT decide which restaurant would fulfill it.  BF suggested BJ's because he heard it was a kind of Chicago style deep dish pizza. We decided to give it a try, because it didn't HURT that they are home of the pazookie (pizza cookie)  I had been to BJ's a few years ago and didn't really remember much about it except the pazookie and THAT itself was even vague.  BF said he loved the avocado rolls and ordered them as appetizer. We ordered a Canadian bacon, black olive and cheese pizza. There was also this ahi appetizer that caught our eye that we wanted to try as well.  The avo rolls were so-so. Deep fried avocado. Hmm..avocado doesn't NEED to be deep fried if you ask me. *scratches head* I guess I just didn't really get the concept. I know people in the States LOVE everything deep fried (County Fairs are evidence of that, I hear BUTTER is an option) but to me, it didn't really DO much to the avocado. There wasn't anything spectacular about it or any kind of fantastic flavor that really struck me.  The ahi was TERRIBLE. The tortilla (?) chips were so overcooked or fried or whatever, they tasted AWFUL. We didn't realize what it was because you're supposed to use the chips to dip into the chopped ahi. They were burnt and tasted horrible. We couldn't even continue to eat it. I tried to taste the ahi by itself, but again, it didn't taste like POKE or whatever it was TRYING to be. It was bland, had some soy sauce splashed on it, and was just simply disappointing.  The pizza was okay. I have to admit, it tasted a LOT better the next day when we ate it as leftovers. The sauce is really what convinces me when it comes to pizza. I had to order a side of marinara because I LOVE my pizza saucy! :) Well, it wasn't all that saucy, the crust was very soft and thick, but DEFINITELY not like a GENUINE Chicago Pizza Pie, actually pretty much NOTHING like a Chicago Pizza pie. Not even close.  The pizza was good enough to take home in the box, but NOT good enough to have us return to BJ's for the pizza. The ahi was terrible and pretty much determined my liking or disliking of BJ's.  Worst part is we were just over it and didn't even get a pazookie. I know. Blasphemy! LOL."
Erin V.,"Long Beach, CA",566,553,1555,2.0,5/9/2010,"This location needs help. The service is hit and miss.   My mozzarella sticks came out cold and the food took awhile to come out. (It wasn't even busy). I asked for my cheese pizza to be well done and had to send it back. Practically had to beg for a refill on water.  Location is great, but if they can only make some improvements... Can't complain about their brews, it was the one thing that saved me from giving them a one star review.  I can't expect much, but man, when I already come in with low expectations.  Ouch."
Diane C.,"Seal Beach, CA",27,97,209,1.0,1/23/2013,This review is for the small BJs in Belmont Shores Ca only..Never have I been to Any BJs where I was told booths are not for 2  people must have 4! We are in our 50s! Not kids..I even told her we are here to eat AND drink and will more then likely spend much more then 4 people...she said  ....sorry its policy..so you REALLY  are going to let a paying customer walk out? Hostess said Yes..its policy..Unbelievable...we left..went down the street had appetizer.. dinner drinks ..and dropped our money elsewhere..dont bother going to this one..
Yelp R.,"San Jose, CA",0,16,1,1.0,10/6/2012,"Triple jeopardy experience! Ageism, Classism, and Racism all in one at the BJ's on 2nd Street!  1. Even if you are over 18 years of age, you will be referred to as a boy or a girl by the manager. 2. You need 3/4 of your party to arrive on the dot in order to keep your RESERVED table. Why? Because traffic stops and parking spaces open for all BJ's customers in order for them all to be there on time for their reservation. If anyone from your party were to arrive later than ""on the dot,"" they will first be denied to order and then asked to leave your table by the manager (and rudely, if you are a minority) to go wait in line for another table because their part of the table will be taken away. And, this splitting of your party only happens if you're lucky and they feel like being generous. If not, they take away your whole table and thus, your RESERVATION. Now, all the people of your party who have arrived will have to wait until everyone arrives in order to wait in line to get a table even though you made a RESERVATION. 3. You have a limit of 2 hours for your party to be there eating at your reserved table but if they feel like kicking you out at least 30 minutes before your ""time is up,"" even if you're a paying customer, and you have a full table, not everyone at your party will get to eat because the manager says so. 4. They require a 17% gratuity for large parties, which would not be so bad if the service was up to par (on the manager's part...the server was polite and friendly)."
Nicole D.,"Long Beach, CA",227,107,614,2.0,12/2/2012,"Great place to meet for a late lunch or early dinner. Do to the small capacity and not having a full bar, I do miss the full experience of the ambiance from the Cerritos location. Otherwise, the staff is great and the food was not disappointing. And, it doesn't hurt to live only less than 10 mins away"
Cynthia W.,"Downey, CA",66,122,52,2.0,12/5/2012,"This is by far the smallest BJ's I have ever been to. Not only is this restaurant tiny, but the service was TERRIBLE!! I was with a party of 6 myself included in that number and all we wanted was Pazookies. There is no reason 6 mini cookies should have taken 30mins to get ready. Mind you the 2 of us were celebrating our birthday's, they didnt bother to throw a candle in for us to add the little BDAY touch. Oh but the party behind us sure got there cookie with the candle included."
Jax L.,"Long Beach, CA",191,266,390,3.0,3/7/2011,"parking still sucks and their service got worst = 1 star. i don't know why i allow my friends to drag me here. but i LOVE their Santa Fe Chicken Salad = 4 stars. perfect portion, nicely grilled chicken, creamy ripe avocados black beans, corn, and salsa. but make sure you ask for dressing on the side because they always tend to over-sauce it  which makes everything soggy and nasty."
Mary F.,"Redondo Beach, CA",254,644,468,1.0,2/28/2010,"This is one of those instances where I wish Yelp had a negative star option because the establishment doesn't even deserve the requisite star I must enter in order to write this review. My boyfriend and I visited this BJ's one night for dinner.  I wanted him to try the pizookie because I had so many memories of sharing pizookie with my college friends. Unfortunately, we never got to try the pizookie.  We actually  never got to eat or drink anything.  Not even a glass of tap water.  They bothered to seat us but then no none ever came to our table.  We waited much longer than we should have.  Finally, my boyfriend commented that they were racist and we left.  I hate to play the race card because I think it's used way more than it's supposed to be but in this instance, I'm going to have to go with it. All the white people were getting great service, getting served, getting attention.  The Asian girl and the black guy were ignored.  We finally got up and walked out. I saw a lot of poor reviews because of the slow service but on this night even white people who were seated after us were waited on.  There was blatant discrimination going on. I will never, ever go to another BJ's again."
Lauren C.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",85,34,1,3.0,9/7/2013,"I've enjoyed their pizza, and that's a pretty big compliment since I'm from the Midwest and there's some pretty tough competition there."
Nick F.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,26,,5.0,1/2/2014,"I went here twice for the last few times I went to Long Beach, and it is faboulous!!!! All the watresses are nice, and very helpful. There food is very amazing, and never cold and dosen't take long. It is SIX stars in my book!!!!  FUNNY STORY LAST TIME I WENT MY WATRESS KEEP ON DROPPING THINGS BUT SHE WAS VERY NICE!!!"
S T.,"Cerritos, CA",0,5,1,3.0,11/26/2013,"Service was slow and felt ignored by waitress given she clearly noticed I was waiting for a seat but continued to do her thing without coming over or getting someone else to seat us if she was busy. Almost walked out since no one acknowledged us for awhile to seat us. finally, someone came by and said they were short staffed and offered to give appetizer for free due to the long wait."
Bevis B.,"Long Beach, CA",1,74,,1.0,11/10/2013,This place is getting worse. The saltiest burger ever. I thing it raise my blood pressure by 20. Yuk yuk yuk
Taylor S.,"Long Beach, CA",6,8,1,2.0,8/7/2012,"I've lived just around the corner from this place for almost all my life and in that time I've come to realize a couple of things. 1. They service is HORRIBLE, or at least that has been my experience with it over the years and from multiple different servers. Once I went there with some friends and family for lunch, and there was no one else in the restaurant. We placed our order and waited and waited, after 40 minutes we asked were our food was and if we could please get some drinks. They had completely forgotten about us and are order. That is pretty hard to do when there is no one else to distract you and the only people there is a table of 8. My most recent encounter with the incompetent staff was just tonight, I called to order a pizza (one that could not be placed online since it was a special order 50/50) and they put me on hold, only to forget that I was on the line. I waited 5 minutes and called again, same guy answered and seemed shocked that I would call back and was confused. He said ""Wait., you actually want to order that? Didn't you already place your order?"" I told him how he forgot I was on hold and he said ""I won't forget about you this time."" Well he was a horrible liar because again I found myself on hold for 5 minutes. I hung up and now I'm not even hungry. 2. The food is okay, you have to know what to order. Stick to the pizza. If it sounds like something you would get at CPK then avoid it because it is a failed attempt. I recommend the Buffalo Chicken pizza with no celery. 3. It is severely overpriced. $20 or more just for a medium pizza. I only paid it once in a while because I am super hungry and don't want to waste my money on Domino's (eek.)  If you like deep dish pizza and can order online for take out, go for it. Otherwise you are best off going to California Pizza Kitchen on PCH and 2nd, which is a personal favorite of mine."
Jackie F.,"San Diego, CA",185,272,108,4.0,2/13/2010,"Pro: Great pizza, cheap beer, nice enough service with a smile, desert from the heavens. Con: Parking, smaller BJ  in seating, slow ish service. We usually come in to this place to share a large pizza (great white and bbq) with a half/half afterward. I do realize that this place can get crowded easily, but it is mostly due to the location. Just look at the other good places on the street, it is most likely packed too. Skip the take out, eat the stuff hot there, you won't be disappointed."
Robert W.,"Thermal, CA",0,54,,5.0,11/2/2011,Gotta try the Tatonka Ale! Excellant service great food best BJ's on the planet!
Brandon K.,"League City, TX",118,55,3,3.0,5/14/2013,"Same menu as all other BJ's, but a very tiny location. No bar and one big room.  Go if you live in the area and crave a pizookie."
Tim L.,"Irvine, CA",115,34,8,3.0,2/20/2010,"I love BJ's. I frequent this one because it's a short walk from my apartment. Any nomal BJ's would get 4 stars. This one gets 3 because: - they don't have the same FULL menu of the other restaurants (a few things missing) - no bar (of course they still have their beers and wine). If you're looking for a Irish root beer, you won't find it here.   - small (although there has hardly been a time where I've had to wait long here). - because of no bar, no happy hour for discounts on food. Overall, still not bad if you're living in the area."
Nancy T.,"Rosemead, CA",115,101,66,3.0,3/10/2013,The BJ's here is kind of small and I believe only has a capacity of 75-80 people.  The services here is great and their works are nice.  When I came to pick up food for a meeting the manager was very nice and considerate about what we need and making sure all of our packaging was perfect before giving it to us.
Paige G.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,156,4,4.0,5/18/2011,"BJ's is BJ's; it's a chain and you either like it or you don't. I personally don't like chains as much as independent restaurants, but this BJ's location has a special place in my heart.  The location is just superb. The atmosphere inside is great. If you score a nice seat by the window, it's just an absolutely wonderful spot to have lunch.  Service here is FANTASTIC. I know other BJ's locations might not have the best service, but this place is certainly the exception. Probably because it's so much smaller than most other BJ's. It is BEER AND WINE ONLY. Usually no wait."
Fred F.,"Lakewood, CA",0,15,,1.0,7/9/2013,"Food was great but the server was terrible. Acted like we were a bother and like he was irritated we were there. We felt rushed and he didn't give us any attention at all. At one point I had to get up and get my own condiments. I'll definitely come to bjs again, but to a different location."
