Vanesa S.,"Merit-Carson, CA",34,60,6,1.0,11/12/2009,My boyfriend and I went around 1PM to this Bj's. We received a giftcard from a friend and we thought it would be a nice day for a lil outing. We read the reviews for this location as well. There was only one other couple in there. We waited for about 10-15 mins for seating. There was no one at the front.. nor walking around. So we left. Yepp. We left.  We went right across the street to shorehouse cafe (I think that's what it is called...).. amazing foood :D
Brooke S.,"Long Beach, CA",164,70,6,4.0,9/28/2011,"BJs has been around for ever (seems like). I love it. My 1 year old likes it too. It's great for kids, and parents. Great beers, and good food. It's always consistent. My husband and I usually spilt a pizza and salad and we still have food left over to take home. Kids meals are good size as well."
Michelle And Ryan P.,"Concord, CA",49,122,52,3.0,1/25/2010,"I add 1 star from before as I returned recently and had a better experience. Apparently, you have to go here when they are BUSY because then they have their shit together.  We waited about five minutes for a table. Service was still very very slow BUT this time they had more than one waiter in the restaurant and a dedicated buss boy.  So, I give them one extra star for stepping up the wait staff and the table bussing.  Everything else about my previous review still stands.  Oh, and my pizza crust was BURNT on the bottom. Bad form!"
Paul A.,"Irvine, CA",700,105,63,4.0,9/1/2010,Had lunch here the other day en route to the Aquarium of the Pacific... ...it's a B.J.'s...if you've been to a B.J.'s anywhere else then you should know what to expect. I'd just say stick with the pizzas and skip the other menu offerings. This particular location is smaller than most...make that VERY small...just one dining room. Luckily for us it was noon on a Monday and the place was relatively empty. We were in and out pretty quick which was ideal. Had the artichoke & spinach dip and we split an artichoke and spinach pizza (we were having an artichoke & spinach day I suppose). I usually stick with B.J.'s Favorite as far as pizza goes but I was being considerate of my companion who is a vegetarian...so I was a vegetarian for the day.  My only complaint is the parking but hey! It's Long Beach...shitty parking is standard.
Shong H.,"San Jose, CA",496,541,208,1.0,2/1/2008,What out of mini pizza's?!!!! *faints. That's all we came for .. grrrrr. That and pizoookies. & so we left.
Jessica H.,"Long Beach, CA",333,263,5,2.0,6/15/2009,"I finally got my refund Saturday afternoon (6 days after the fact), along with a gift card good at any BJ's.  The manager I spoke with was very apologetic, and said she understood my frustration. I dunno.. something about her tone denoted she says that speech a lot. Sounded quite rehearsed. But I did get my money back, after much effort on my part, so I can at least say they tried to make up for the series of bad service we received.  Maybe delivery just isn't the way to go with BJ's. The sit down service has always been stellar."
Manson C.,"Kihei, HI",0,62,,1.0,4/24/2014,i would give negative stars if possible ... i know WAY to much about this company !!! TRUST me its a health risk IMO to eat at ANY BJs !!! they cut each and every corner in each and everyway ... IF Bernie Madoff opened a restaurant would you eat there?
Jenn C.,"South Pasadena, CA",5,61,,1.0,7/24/2012,"Worst service ever!!! I'm not hard to please and I'm generally very understanding, especially of waiters because I know how stressful their job  can be, but to be utterly ignored is just wrong. I will never come back. That's all I have to say."
Ashley M.,"Austin, TX",154,57,25,1.0,2/11/2009,"I don't think I've ever had worse service in my life, except maybe once at Applebee's, but that's beside the point.  First off, it took over 20 minutes to get seated and they weren't busy at all. We finally got seated and it was well over 45 minutes before we even got our drinks. I feel like a dumbass for waiting that long, but hey, I was hungry and I like their food. Our food took probably just as long and they didn't even get our orders right. One of us didn't even get our food and we had to flag down nearly every staff member before someone straightened everything out. We couldn't even find our original waitress. We hoped she had been fired and sent home. *fingers crossed* Even though the manager took off most of our bill and gave us free pazookies, that was still one of the worst dining experiences ever. It was almost as bad as the time I went there and ordered a baked potato and it took them over an hour to tell me they were out."
Arthur L.,"Long Beach, CA",105,128,144,5.0,3/23/2012,"Thought of going to BJ's down in Belmont Shores for lunch.  I noticed the place is smaller than the other BJ's I am used to, but it had nice seating both inside and out, a large window to see all the passersby, and plentiful amount of tvs playing sports.  the waiter comes by introduces himself and hits us up for drinks and appetizers.  Went with the Hef, and it was delicious.  Paired it with the Fish n Chips and it got even better.  The fish as cooked perfectly, with a deep golden brown crunch on the outside, and hot steamy white flaky fish goodness on the inside.  fries were seasoned perfectly and i couldnt have enjoyed my lunch anymore.  the waiter kept checking up and refilled my Hef.  the other people i were with enjoyed their lunch just the same.  I will definitely be back to watch some sports, eat some food, and sample more of their extensive list of beers.  keep up the good service, it goes along way."
Judah A.,"Huntington Beach, CA",37,21,,1.0,2/3/2010,"This place stinks big time.  We have gone here twice for a group lunch and we give ourselves an hour and half.  Their service is super slow.  It seems like they're saving money by not staffing during PEAK BUSINESS HOURS.   Ultra terrible.  I had a mind to tell the manager that they stunk.... but I just bit my tongue, cuz I may have lost it there. The food is good....anything is good when you've been waiting and HUNGRY. 1-2 people get served timely..... 4-8 people....forgetaboutit......"
Loren L.,"Torrance, CA",243,311,73,3.0,11/19/2011,"Was pretty good , service was perfect. Beer was exelent, its a corporate place but you know what your gonna get. I usually come f or the all you can eat chile soup and salad for lunch."
Laura B.,"Long Beach, CA",27,41,6,5.0,5/10/2012,"Excellent food, service and dessert.  Went for lunch, lots of great specials and super fast service.  Highly recommend pizzola cookie / ice cream treat for dessert!"
Glenn I.,"San Diego, CA",61,10,1,2.0,7/18/2010,"Not gonna take much on this review cause I figure most people are familiar with BJ's, or at least what they have to offer (American food restaurant that specializes in burgers, sandwiches, and pizza). We came for lunch and ordered calamari appetizer and buffalo chicken pizza, so this review is somewhat specific to those sort of taste buds. Calamari was not bad, but not particularly good neither and the tartar sauce seemed overly tart.  The pizza was okay too.  Definitely does the trick on a hungry stomach, but when I think about it, couldn't really taste much but the chicken and celery.  I really wanted to have a the nice spicy sensation from the buffalo sauce, but was denied, and couldn't really taste the ranch neither. The service was okay, but our server seemed kind of dull."
Alice H.,"Long Beach, CA",595,328,610,3.0,1/6/2010,"Yesterday was my second time eating here for lunch. I was really excited to get some pizza, but unfortunately I couldn't get the BBQ chicken because it's $1 per topping :( Therefore, I decided to try the sliders. They were amazing! You get 4 mini burgers and a choice of fries or wedges. My friend got the unlimited soup and salad. They had a wide variety of soup :) I was disappointed when I was stuck in the bathroom for a few minutes and almost had a heart attack :[ They need to fix the woman's bathroom! -2 star for that!!! :P That's all for now. Until next time. I love eating at 2nd st, but I'll stick to the BJ at Cerritos because it's bigger and better :)"
Kajora L.,"Long Beach, CA",57,5,,3.0,8/24/2010,"I've been here many, many times. Before going gluten and casein free I would get deep dish pepperoni pizzas, the tossed cobb salad, or the chili. They were all good.  But I decided to again after finding out that they have gluten free pizza. They only have personal size pizzas, but the crust is thin and crispy, which I love. I had it without cheese and kept it simple with pepperoni. It wasn't the best gluten free pizza, but it was decent.  They also have bottles of Redbridge (a mediocre gluten free beer) at $4.50 each, which wasn't too bad. It wasn't the best gluten free pizza I've had, but it was very tasty. It's nice to be able to go out and order a gluten free pizza and beer, not just have it at home.  My server told me that I was the first person she'd ever had who ordered the gluten free pizza. When I told her I wanted a Redbridge she informed me that BJ's only carries beer and wine, so I showed the listing to her on the menu.  This isn't the best choice out there for gluten free pizza and beer (since that's about all that's gluten free on the menu) but it works if you're nearby and have a craving."
Christie M.,"Long Beach, CA",6,19,,4.0,7/27/2013,I had a Facebook offer for buy one entrée get one free. The location is great! The restaurant is a little small but its cozy. The food was delicious and my scallops were perfectly cooked.  Great value! My son was happy with his little pizza. I will come back!
Eddie C.,"Torrance, CA",954,674,2706,3.0,4/22/2009,"Hey, all you can eat soup and salad for $6.95 - nuff said."
Sara B.,"Yorba Linda, CA",138,15,9,1.0,4/29/2014,"First off I just have to say it takes a great deal of work to get a bad review from me. I hate writing them and I equally hate giving them, I'm just too nice. This particular BJ's would get zero stars from me if allowed. We get there and wait at least 10 minutes just to have a hostess come and get our name, this was at 4:30 pm and the place was all but empty. Next we get seated and wait another 10 plus minutes for our server who comes to our table to inform us that she's ""not really our server, she's just waiting for her replacement who's late for work"". We didn't see our real server until at least 30 minutes later. We had to ask 6 times for someone to change the channel to the Ducks playoff game, mind you there were no other competing games on at that time. Our appetizer was literally just dropped off at our table with no plates or silverware, we had to go and get them ourselves.  I think we were there a total of 3 hours simply because we were simply ignored the majority of the time. The food was typical BJ's food but the service was jaw dropping. My advice, pick a different restaurant on 2nd street."
Jaime B.,"Huntington Beach, CA",41,10,,3.0,6/7/2012,"I usually like Bj's restaurant but not a big fan of this location. It's pretty small, which I guess is to be expected since it's on 2nd St. The beer selection is also a lot more limited than the other locations. It's never really too busy in here, which I guess can be a good thing but I hate eating in a place where it's just me and a few other tables. Their pizza is good and so is the rest of the food on the menu, but if I had to pick a place to go on 2nd, this definitely wouldn't be my first choice."
