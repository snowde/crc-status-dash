Kelly L.,"Hallsville, TX",7,14,2,5.0,11/30/2017,"Absolute favorite place to go in East Texas! Always clean, fantastic service, wonderful food and amazing selection! The atmosphere is fun and modern and the beer selection is huge. They are expensive but you can get specials on certain days of the week. My entire family goes there anytime we have something to celebrate!"
Kelly G.,"Bay Lake, FL",0,23,14,2.0,12/21/2017,"We were going to eat here for a year and try everything on this novel menu that makes you want to try it all.  Now...I don't think so. we have changed our mind. Pizza... well it's Nothing special. I was starving and didn't even finish it. I moved over to share my daughters BBQ chicken wings and it was just fried globs of chicken sugar.  Slider burgers were burnt tasting, though they were pink inside, not to mention the onions were burnt to a crisp with no flavor. I think they tried to save their sorry sliders by drowning them in ketchup, definitely did not help. Ketchup,ketchup, ketchup. Have you ever gone swimming in a pool of ketchup? just go to BJ's!   Fries were too salty, I've had fries better than that at a drive through! Come on BJ's! Step it up. Calamari... boring, soggy, and rubbery.It should be crispy. Try trulucks... you will never forget what good calamari is! And it is definitely not BJ's We got the pizcookie dessert, and it was mini mini, it was Like it was made for a baby, not only was it the size for a baby, but a baby could eat it too! It was complete mush! My Daughters friend said ""is it supposed to be raw dough?""An easy bake oven is really what it was. It was delicious though... hard to mess up chocolate chips and ice cream"
David F.,"Longview, TX",0,77,9,4.0,5/15/2017,"BJs is my favorite new restaurant in Longview.  I really love their menu and have really enjoyed everything I have tried.  I am not much of a drinker so the whole brewery thing is pretty much lost on me, but the food is really well done.  The pizzas, both deep dish and thin, are excellent.  The spaghetti and meatballs is spicy and not boring like most restaurants.  The jambalaya is excellent and I have tried a lot of jambalaya.  Salads, burgers, baked ziti and other choices have been great as well.  The only item I have had that just wasn't exciting was the potato skins.  They probably just need Tabasco.  But the real kicker is the mandatory desert known a Pizookies.  These are awesome and we always end the meal with one to share.   Another thing about BJs is there rewards membership.  You earn points for things like Free Pizookies.  Occasional emails notify you of specials like buy one get one entrees when you buy two drinks."
Yum H.,"Dallas, TX",32,50,1,5.0,8/9/2017,Very nice and clean locAtion.. friendly..Great Togo customer service!! Kudos to Juliana!!
Gerry B.,"Longview, TX",0,36,,1.0,1/8/2017,Kitchen doesn't seem to care what goes out.  Too many problems to list on the food. Ranch dressing was watered down..  c'mon! This place must survive on the alcohol sales.
Jill D.,"Marshall, TX",5,14,10,5.0,4/4/2017,Go for the desserts!! One of the best places in Longview to grab dessert and a cup of coffee. Go get a cheap dinner and then go to BJs for dessert and you have a great date night!
Tommy H.,"Jefferson, TX",2,41,21,5.0,3/21/2016,"A great place if you love great craft beers, and even if you don't get any stronger than iced tea, some of the best food in town.  Have been 4 times, and not disappointed yet. The brisket burger is to die for, the spaghetti and meat balls is really tasty. But the real stars here are the brews... Right now they have a chocolate porter that is so smooth it is like eating dark chocolate. The red is great also, by itself or mixed with the berry cider, which is also great on its own. Great fast friendly wait staff and servers make it s pleasant visit."
Patricia M.,"San Antonio, TX",41,120,179,1.0,7/2/2016,"Decent restaurants in this small town are few & far between.  Found BJs no line.  Also found flies & a piece of metal in drink  Don't order the Sante Fe Salad bland not even the extra dressing could save it  Save your money eat @ home, or try a different restaurant."
Dave D.,"Longview, TX",0,18,4,4.0,3/26/2017,"Tried the Prime Rib dip sandwich and it was great. The calmari appetizer was very good, and the service was the best I have had at BJ's."
Darris J.,"Humble, TX",16,332,14,3.0,11/17/2015,"I was informed this was day 2 of operation of this place. With that in mind the bar itself did okay. The waitstaff appear lost, but I'm sure after a couple of weeks they'll be at full speed. My calamari app was over cooked and a little greasy but, it's Longview, Tx so it'll do.  Poor whiskey and bourbon selection but a decent variety of beer on tap. For the area this should be a hot spot for years to come. Since there are dark napkins many people will associate it ""classy""."
Karen L.,"Dallas, TX",71,2,1,2.0,7/31/2017,"I'm only speaking for the bar here: I came in from Dallas to visit my family and forgot my ID on my way back from west Texas (I stopped at my place in Dallas) where I left a few things. When I told the bartender I didn't have an ID, the Bartender asked if I had a criminal record (apparently you can pull it up and they'll serve you). I told him I had my registered nurse license and pulled up my record on the tx BON. Apparently, it wasn't enough since it didn't have my birthdate, but according to the bartender, if you have criminal record they'll serve you. I know it's my fault bc i didn't have my ID but it's just sad to see if you have a criminal record they'll serve you, but if you have a professional record, it's a different story."
Kari P.,"Longview, TX",151,102,601,5.0,3/11/2016,Jason Moughon is the best server ever! If you're blessed enough to be in his section he will do his very best to ensure your experience is superior! The menu is huge with a ton of variety. Use the app to let them know you're coming ... it saves a lot of wait time.
Kristi B.,"White Oak, TX",23,7,3,4.0,12/26/2016,"Let me start with this wasn't my best experience with BJ'S. However, true customer service is a priority here. Before I left, the management made everything right. I will return again because my experience was important to the staff."
Lynne C.,"Longview, TX",0,5,,1.0,2/1/2017,"My sister was visiting from NY so my family took her here for lunch. Because I only had an hour lunch break, I placed my order first while my family pondered over the menu. I explained this to our waitress and asked her to bring our orders our as they were ready.  Everyone's order came out 25 min later with our drinks. I was now out of time so I asked the waitress to bring me a togo box. When I finally realized she was not returning to our table, I decided I had enough time to scarf my food down and speed to work.  I ordered the Fish Tacos. The tacos were so cold, they had obviously been ready to serve for a while. The fires were cooked in old oil that had been used to cook fish. I had never tasted fishy fries before and have no intention to again.  This has got to be the worst dining experience I have every had. I am not sure if I would every be willing to give this location another visit."
JG M.,"Marshall, TX",2,125,748,3.0,4/3/2016,"Longview needed a good place like this. Doesn't seem that way with all the restaurants around but this is good food a step up from Chile's or Applebee's.  JG score from us of 4.5/10 (+1.5 for food, +1 for atmosphere, 0 for price, +1 for Diet Dr Pepper, 0 for typical service and +1 for we would return) Large menu with many choices. We have each eaten at these separately in DFW but this is out 1st time here. We got the Chicken Pot Stickers as an appetizer since those and Fried Pickle spears are our favorites and these were good here. We brought a guest along as well, Olivia. She got the California Club which she said was good and J and I got small pizzas each so we could split and try them. We had the Gourmet 5 Meat Pizza and the Mediterranean Pizza. Both were good pizzas but we liked the meat much more. The food here gets a one and a half on our scale for being good but not being unforgettable.....even the other entrees we have tried at other BJ's.  Atmosphere is good here. Nice and clean and fun to look all around and even many TV's to watch. This is a busy place with a lot of people but not too cramped and the seating is comfortable. Price is over $15 for a good meal but that would seem appropriate here.  They do have Diet Dr Pepper and some brewed Root Beer and are known for a cream soda too. The service was friendly and typical. We will come back someday."
Richard R.,"Tyler, TX",0,22,1,3.0,5/13/2017,"I'd give the service 4.5 stars but the meal was not good at all. I had the Salmon and it was over cooked, tough and unable to fork cut in some places. The asparagus were not that good either.  Not typical of BJ's as they're usually at least ""good"" with all their meal selections."
Miranda K.,"Longview, TX",58,2,1,1.0,6/18/2017,"So we have been coming for months, birthdays, you name it. But the last few times.. especially tonight was a game changer. We ordered a bbq burger with NO CHEESE, a jalapeno burger with no tomatoes, child spaghetti with knot, and 1 single chicken strip. The bbq burger had cheese, jalapeno burger had tomatoes, and no garlic knot with MINIMAL sauce on the noodles.. it was a joke. So we sent the cheesey bbq burger back, not even a minute later it comes back to us, without cheese & with way less bbq toppings. BECAUSE THEY SCRAPED IT OFF! How do we know? Found the cheese they missed and the burger looked pitiful. I didnt even bother anymore. Oh the chicken strip.. the SINGLE TINY CHICKEN STRIP for my 1 year old cost me $4. Yup. $4. We are now on the hunt for our new ""go to"" because this was the final straw.  $50 down the drain..."
Roy S.,"San Clemente, CA",3,4,9,1.0,12/17/2015,"My wife and 2 kids have been here 3 times since it opened a month or so ago. The service the first time was good. The second time we ordered bottled beer and it took at least 15 minutes to get that out to the table. This wasn't a beer they had to get from the tap, you just take the beer out of the fridge and bring a glass and drop it off, I'll do the rest. A little upsetting... Last night, I went there and ordered the same two bottled beers and got my food and was halfway done eating by the time we got our beers. When we did get the drinks the server didn't have a way to open the bottle so he had to take them back to the bar and then it took a solid 15 more minutes to get them back. When we were done eating we got our beers! Incredibly we were told that they lost track of the bar orders.  I have been to this restaurant in many states and towns and this is by far the worst run out of them all. Hopefully they get a better manager and training program here or I'm going to keep frequenting Cheddars which is by far better in the customer service department."
Jackie M.,"Henderson, TX",56,167,80,1.0,12/16/2015,"So I do know this is a new restaurant, how ever I also know they flew in staff from other locations to train the new employees. So to me they have no excuse.  First two trips were my husband And dad both got raw burgers basically when asking for well done and took for ever for drinks.  So the 3rd trip we went and it took a while but we gave them the benefit of the doubt. I asked for a burger that was well done no pink. My husband ordered a burger medium we both got burgers and mine has medium well. I ate it and thought next time I'll know to say no pink at all. The frys were great and drinks were watery and we had to ask for refills.  Next trip tonight we go in at  9:30 it is 10:40 we just left after our meal arrived. No we didn't eat it either.  So here's the play by play we went in got sat ordered drinks came fairly decently but my husband had to ask for lemon to mask the taste of unsweetened tea even tho he asked for sweet. We ordered a burger well done  no pink at all. I even made a joke about wanting it a little burnt to insure no pink. And he ordered a chicken fried steak w a piece or garlic bread.  So litterly an hour later we get our food. My husband laughed at the fact that their was two tea spoons max of gravy on his giant steak....so he asked waitress to bring more and his roll. She said sure I'll take care of it. So as she turned around two more employees walked up basically on top of our table telling her she could have all the rest of the tables. Keep in mind not busy. But still she can't take care of the few she has.....either way I don't think standing next to our table was the place to discuss it.   So she heads off. Please know we had yet after the hour to see lemon or a fresh tea for my husband.  Then we sit and watch her go off and do other things. Then while waiting my husband tells me to cut the burger. I did and bright and shiny red is all I see....I'm mad at my self for not taking a picture because it was so red I couldn't have ate it.  We waited to tell her but she just wasn't coming back anytime soon. So we got up told the hosts what happened and they wanted us to speak to a manager. Personally I was to pissed to stay and discuss with the manager.  Yes I know that the cooks are responsible for the bad cooking but the waitress is also at fault for not checking in or paying attention to anything. Or remembering anything!!!! I know how hard it is to keep everything straight but please realize your entire job is to pay attention to your tables!!!  So take my review for what it is I hope this is not a common thing because I don't want others to go through all of this as well.  Also side note. I had researched the menu because they have gluten free menu which my mother has celiac. So I check things out because this is a very very critical thing to deal with when coming to food. So after all these issues I would never feel safe taking my mom to this restaurant having food allergies. They are not trust worthy with any allergies! Please please allergie aware customers BEWARE!!! So thanks whataburger for feeding me!  Spoke to Colten the manager he apologized but the hosts didn't tell him entire story just that burger wasn't cooked. He made a few excuses and tried to save face but after 4 tries and  that much money on raw burgers no thanks! Total of 5 pink burgers when asked for all well done. He also explained that the bad waitresses would eventually be weeded out by not making money... Uh fire them before they turn away customers!!!"
Kaitlyn W.,"Longview, TX",0,1,,1.0,12/28/2015,"terrible terrible terrible service. My family & I went around 1 in the afternoon (fairly busy) & didn't leave until the restaurant until 3. Our waitress was very disorganized. We ordered drinks & then she forgot go write them down & asked us again what we ordered. I ordered the BJ's brewhouse burger (comes with bacon & cheese)... I received the burger & it had no bacon or cheese, just meat & bun with a little mustard. We confronted the waitress & she replied in a very ignorant way. She said ""uhhh no i don't think it has anything on it""...what restaurant would serve a burger with nothing on it on the adults menu?! Moral of the story: the service is very poor, the waitresses arent very oriented, & the kitchen doesn't know how to prepare food."
Pranati R.,"Austin, TX",298,99,71,4.0,12/26/2015,"A BJ's opening in our neck of the woods was honestly the best news I could get! Pizookies are the best thing to happen since sliced bread and no one does skillet cookie goodness quite like BJ's and trust me I've tried at home many-a-times with no such success, so I'm just a slave to their pizookie. I've been to BJ's in the Bay Area several times but it was always for their beers and pizookies but I finally tried their deep dish pizza - the Great White. It was made very well, mushrooms and tomatoes cooked down perfectly to retain texture and flavor! If you're here I recommend the beer and cider sampler since that's what I always used to get, and try literally any pizookie - but the triple chocolate is my favorite! My friend also got calamari when she came with me and it was pretty good! The sauce was ranch-based so there's very little you can do wrong with a ranch sauce! Since this place is new I have had very hit or miss experiences here but overall, pretty friendly and nice!  PROTIP - if you like the place, download their app and join their loyalty program! It's totally worth it :)"
Jen G.,"Kilgore, TX",20,203,72,5.0,12/3/2015,A friend took me to lunch for a recent birthday.  A short wait and we were seated. Atmosphere was great. Food was awesome. A little glitch in our order was quickly and graciously resolved. They even gave us a complimentary pazookie. So glad to have a BJs closer to home.
Trena S.,"Longview, TX",0,8,,3.0,1/9/2016,"We did a call ahead and still waited an hour when we arrived 30 mins after the call. It was a Thursday night and I realize its's busy, but dont offer a call ahead. The food was absolutely delicious but took two tries for my friend. The staff was very apologetic, though. The beers were a bit too pricey but the selection was ok.  The cocktails are all supposedly ""top shelf"" but were concoctions of top liquor with cheap, overpoured mixer. It just ruined the quality of the alcohol and at the price, they should be on point. I would do take out on the food, but I'll just go to Harley's for a $9 build your own 6 pk. Service was great, though. We had a knowledgeable waitress who gave great food recommendations! At least we can say we tried it out. Yes to the food!   FYI: I have worked in the food service industry. Hopefully they can train their bartenders a bit more. I don't mind paying for a quality drink. The food was amazing."
Nick G.,"Dallas, TX",96,5,14,5.0,2/9/2016,"Great bartender service. The Santa Fe Salad with Shrimp was awesome....as always. Also, the Tatonja Stout, Piranha Ale and Jeremiah Red IPA beers are fantastic. I lived in the DFW metroplex and frequented the BJ's in Lewisville and Addison often. Food, brews and service has always been great. The Longview location is new and it has its challenges but they will get worked out because their menu and brews on tap cannot be beat.  Since moving here, I now frequent the Longview BJs and I consistently see improvement but I always provide feedback so their service will improve."
Doc G.,"Beckville, TX",44,4,1,5.0,4/7/2016,"I love this place.  Longview didn't have any really nice restaurants or bars, and BJs fills both of those gaps.  I go there as often as I can, and recommend it to everyone that comes in to town to visit."
Charles V.,"Longview, TX",9,29,,4.0,7/13/2016,Great place to eat. The service is amazing and the food is tasty and different. I've never left dissatisfied and I've tried many menu items.
Megan L.,"Longview, TX",0,7,,2.0,8/11/2016,"We have been a few times now- for a dinner date, for lunch and dinner with our kids. It's always just okay. I'm not the biggest fan of chain restaurants to begin with, so you have to do a lot to impress me. I am definitely not impressed by overpriced, mass-produced food. The first time we shared a pizza and an order of tacos. They were good but nothing to write home about. I asked for a side of pizza sauce because the pizza seemed dry, and the waitress acted like that was weird. I don't really care what the cooking process involves- the pizza was dry.  On the second visit I had the jambalaya, and my husband had one of the lighter fish choices over couscous. Mine was very good. His was just okay and not really that flavorful. The kids shared a kids pizza. (Our youngest is not a big eater.) With a BOGO coupon on our two entrees, water to drink, one kids meal, and a kids pazookie, our bill was still over $30 after tip. For lunch. That is just nuts. The most recent visit was a Monday night with the kids. Somehow they were out of large pizzas so ours came out as two smalls. No biggie. But they took about 40 minutes, and they were barely warm. The cheese wasn't even fully melted. We also ordered a burger to share and had to send that back because it didn't have all the toppings. There were obviously kitchen issues. Our server, Celeste, handled things beautifully, but she just couldn't fully compensate for the BOH shortcomings. The wait is usually pretty long, the service is friendly and decent, and the food, while good, is just not that impressive or even consistent to me for the prices. I couldn't stomach a full-price bill at this place. I would rather spend my dollars with a local restaurant or just cook at home. Either way, the food is better and usually more affordable anyway."
Randy T.,"Plano, TX",3,20,,5.0,6/26/2016,"Great food, great service and I especially like their pizza.  If you are a fan of creme soda you have to try BJs. They brew their own and it's awesome!"
Michelle S.,"DIANA, TX",3,9,4,4.0,6/12/2016,"Have been to both the Tyler and Longview locations and had good experiences at both.  As a fan of micro-breweries, we were happy to find BJs after moving to east Texas.  Food is very good and more importantly consistent.  Last time we were at the Longview location, we had the best waitress, super friendly and fast!  Only complaint was husband said they didn't have a big enough beer glasses."
Jackie M.,"Kilgore, TX",5,12,1,2.0,5/30/2016,"Two stars for root beer and food. If your waitress is Crystal M, move to another table. She brought our drinks and asked if we wanted an appetizer. We said no we were ready to order. She ignored us and turned around to another table that was just seated. As she walked away, I asked if we could order. After that, our service was bad. A person named Kelsey helped us. She is wonderful!"
Doug F.,"Longview, TX",0,3,3,5.0,2/24/2016,"I was a bit apprehensive about going to BJ's in the first place after reading some pretty scathing reviews, but our experience was nothing but good. We were served by Celeste and she was phenomenal. Attentive, engaging, cheerful...I hope she's working next time we visit. The food was delicious and everything came out quickly and accurately. No problems here. We had a great time and look forward to coming back."
Rebecca C.,"Longview, TX",64,48,31,5.0,12/11/2015,"We ate here last night and it was amazing!! I had the guacamole burger and it was absolutely delicious! The fries were nice and crispy! We loved almost everything, well except the home brewed orange cream soda it was sooo sweet and really really flat. Service was exceptional we did have a 20min wait but that's kind of expected with a brand new place.  We will definitely be back!"
Will P.,"New Castle, PA",0,11,,2.0,3/29/2016,Stopped in for a late night snack and brew. Beer was good (piranha pale ale). Ordered the queso and chips with the verde pork chili. There was no pork at all in the cheese. Very uninspiring. Cheese was just thick cheese from a jar at the store.
Salud L.,"Longview, TX",4,18,5,5.0,2/20/2016,So this isn't my first visit to a Bj's but my town just got one so let me say I am impressed! Our server Brianna was awesome to say the least. She made a great drink suggestion and was very attentive. I had the California club and it was yummy! My husband got the Brisket Bbq burger and boy was it huge and apparently yummy. He finished every bite. Try the Alabama Sunset (drink) it was amazing. I'm normally anti-vodka but try it. It's goood. We will definitely be back. :)
Sherry J.,"Marshall, TX",0,13,,5.0,8/21/2016,I love this place. The food is great and the dessert cookie is wonderful. The staff is friendly and the restaurant is always clean.
Phil F.,"White Oak, TX",1,27,1,4.0,12/31/2015,"I have been twice now. Serivice was good both times and food was very good. I see reviews that are awful for this new restaurant, which is pretty common for a new chain restaurant in their early months. Trashing them doesn't make them better, working with them does. The beer is great and consistent, the food good. The rest will get better. It annoys me when people who have never worked in a service industry want to be so demanding. I want to come to their job and make those same demands on them."
Jonah R.,"Longview, TX",1,5,,5.0,11/14/2015,Great food and service. So glad to have a BJ's Brewhouse in Longview.  Very personable GM and staff.
Christy M.,"Marshall, TX",0,2,2,1.0,9/18/2016,"Slow service, lasagna came out still frozen in the middle. Took for ever. Waitress said oh sry manager will be out here soon. Manager never came we just paid and left. Will not be back. Bad all the way around."
Ian I.,"Bangor, ME",20,39,5,3.0,12/1/2015,"Great beer, its nice to have a craft brew in longview. However, my steak way too salty, and the veggies on the side were really dry. I've had decent steak at the Tyler location so it could be them working out the kinks."
D R.,"Longview, TX",0,13,4,2.0,6/21/2016,"2nd time we tried this restaurant , 1st time was fairly good fish and chips were fresh and hot, 2nd time not so good. It took forever to get our food, fries were cold, fish was hot but soggy and greasy, my wife's fish taco had one tiny sliver of mahi,and my mom inlaws chicken was served with hard almost uncooked Brussel sprouts, not impressed at all unless you just want good selection of beer."
