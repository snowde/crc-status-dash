Rachel S.,"Longview, TX",11,101,2,5.0,1/19/2016,"Went here on a busy night before Christmas. Service was fast and friendly, everyone's orders were correct, and we had a great time."
Janet B.,"Longview, TX",0,13,,4.0,4/23/2016,"We ate here for the first time yesterday, for lunch.  They weren't very crowded, but our waiter seemed to be in a rush to get us out the entire time.  We had no time at all to decide on drinks (and the drink menu is about 10 pages!).  The food was great.  I had the Black and Bleu burger.  The french fries are the best I've ever eaten (i love thin versus thick fries.)  We will be back."
David M.,"Longview, TX",3,16,2,3.0,11/21/2015,Complete chaos! Waitstaff running around In clusters and tripping over each other. We tried to orient ourselves to the huge menu but felt rushed by the waitstaff. They were training for about a week but still seemed lost and confused about the simplest question. Also the advertised happy hour discounts that were advertised in the menu were unknown to our waitress and when questioned she said she would find out but when I pointed it out in the menu she still acted like she didn't understand. Our bill also didn't reflect the discounts. My ultimate spaghetti and meatballs was warm outside and cold inside. My daughters baked ravioli was good and so was my wife's southern fried chicken. I am confused what this place is trying to be since there are so many selections that other than the craft beer everything else is mediocre. The prices are pretty high for what you get at 14.95 for spaghetti and meatballs I could get a better deal at Olive Garden or pizza king and get a salad to boot but here it's 3.50 extra? If your a beer connoisseur this is probably the place for you but save your money and eat somewhere else.
Anthony D.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,3,,1.0,2/9/2016,Sat at bar to have a couple beers and food. I've never seen so many servers on their cell phones. Bar tending service was below average.  Cleaning to close at 9pm. Only 4 people at bar and I feel they made no effort to connect with guest. More concerned about chatting with coworkers than guest. I have been to many BJs in my life mostly in California but this was definitely the worst experience I've had at a bjs. I heard this is a newly opened restaurant but I think corporate needs to come back through and see what's going on.
Debbie R.,"Longview, TX",2,5,,5.0,2/5/2016,Good service.  Ask for Branson.  Get the jambalaya.  Love the fact the kitchen stays open late.
Maria T.,"Miami, FL",3,76,,3.0,3/15/2016,Ok. We were talked into going back. Their service is still slow but all orders were correct and the food was good. May try again in a month or two.
Debbie J.,"Longview, TX",0,6,,4.0,1/28/2016,"Our server, Ruston, was a congenial and efficient ambassador of your establishment! He offered suggestions, was timely in his service, and was very pleasant! Our only disappointment with this visit is that they were out of Jeremiah Red, again. It is my husband's favorite ale and they have been out the last two visits."
Marcie H.,"Gilmer, TX",0,3,,5.0,2/29/2016,Wonderful food and service! The Caesar chicken  salad was awesome! Our waiter was wonderful. Love all the smiling faces of the wait staff.
Dan G.,"Daingerfield, TX",1,4,1,1.0,12/23/2015,We got here and went to check in. The young man at the front desk was terribly rude and arrogant. The wait was terribly long - much longer than we were told. Then the service was slow. The server had no clue what the drinks were that were ordered and we had to show her the food items on the menu because she didn't know what we were ordering. The drinks took about 15 minutes. I'm still waiting for the meal and so have plenty of time to write this and perhaps read a book. Later this evening I guess I'll find out how the food is. Probably doesn't matter as I'll never be back. The manager was running around trying to calm irate customers down. He wasn't doing a good job. Let me encourage you to go somewhere else.
Mike F.,"Longview, TX",19,55,1,3.0,1/9/2016,"My wife and I drive by here a couple of times a week and finally decided to stop and eat there. I have seen very few reviews that were so mixed, several 1 star to a few 5 star. To me a good restaurant is consistency  This one hasn't reached that point yet, maybe being new is the cause. The first thing the waitress offered us was one of their 42 beers on tap. We are in our late 60's and shouldn't look like serious beer drinkers (for lunch). I guess that is their major push because they run from $7 to $10 a beer and are probably a good profit maker for them. Our waitress was attentive and friendly and we have no complaints with the serviced. The food, however, was just average. Not bad and not good. My wife had a soup and sandwich and I had a lime chicken breast on rice. Her sandwich was the best of all. Mine did not have a lot of flavor. Just average for a $10 lunch, quality and quantity. Summary: The place is OK but nothing to brag about. They have a lot of competition that is as good or better."
Christina F.,"Binghamton, NY",0,5,,1.0,1/2/2016,"Well. What an eventful night for my boyfriend's birthday. We wanted Thai food, but they weren't open, so we went to BJ's instead. We sat at the bar because it was crazy packed. Ordered an appetizer and our meals. All of a sudden, our meals were walking toward us, but the waitress delivered them to us from behind us in the busy aisle between the bar and the high-top tables behind. As the waitress was delivering my chicken pitas, someone bumped into her, she slipped on the floor, and dumped the entire plate into my lap, breaking the plate on my chair (or the bar, I couldn't tell which). It wasn't the waitress' fault, the manager checked on me to make sure I wasn't cut from the broken plate and they comped my tacos. But that's it. That's all they comped. I was cool about the whole thing too - I didn't yell, I didn't blame them for the incident - I accepted their apologies, drank my beer and paid the bill. I just can't believe they only comped my food and the manager was only concerned if I was cut by the broken plate. What would have had to happen for them to comp at least the appetizer also, which I might add came out *after* our meals? Getting cut by the plate also? I am disappointed by the whole incident. I won't be going back voluntarily in the future. Hey BJ's. You lost a customer."
