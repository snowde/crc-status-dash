Phan H.,"San Francisco, CA",236,590,1,3.0,1/15/2016,"Came here on a weekend night to grab some dinner and drinks with a friend of mine before watching a movie. This is just your typical Brewery chain, nothing extraordinary about it. The service is fast, but the food was subpar. Our waiter gave me very weird vibes all night, not sure what it was. He was attentive(which I like), wasn't pushy(which I like), and friendly(which I also like). I'm going to have to blame it on his Chester mustache. The appetizer platter, and a lot of the items on it were warm or even cold. I also had pizza, which wasn't great. My friend and I love beer, but nothing was good enough to get a second serving of, we kept ordering a different beers to find a good one. None could be found. Come here if nothing else is available, it was pretty busy on a Saturday night though. Value is ok as well"
Ohhee J.,"Century City, Los Angeles, CA",273,340,618,3.0,4/16/2015,Nice interior. Older business crowd. Came for happy hour. decent service. Decent food. Not horrible but not great. Very very average. My hubs and I were tired of cooking and wanted to eat semi-cheap somewhere nearby so the happy hour here definitely got the job done.  Stuffed mushrooms are really good although it's not on the happy hour menu.  The best value on the happy hour is probably the mini pizza.
Danielle K.,"Los Angeles, CA",391,96,281,4.0,1/14/2016,"This place has not closed yet. I was advised that they are officially closing this location in 10 days. It really is too bad. My experience was so pleasant from the moment I walked into the establishment. I was immediately greater as I entered the restaurant and was seated in the bar area at one of the high top tables. The waiter came by and took our drink orders immediately. I was a pleasantly surprised by the selections  of wine , bear and cocktail selection.  For my meal I had the jambalaya. Which had chicken, shrimp, and sausage. I substituted the rice pilaf for brown rice and was not charged anything extra. The meal had a nice amount of heat. Just the way I like it.  The only downer was that I was so full I did not get an opportunity to have a dessert.   The service was outstanding. I always think it is a fine line with checking in with customers and bothering them. Our waiter checked in with us just enough so that I could have a nice conversation with my friends and yet still made sure  my glass was always full:) I am really disappointed this place is closing as I would have loved to come back again."
Anna T.,"Los Angeles, CA",123,117,166,4.0,3/22/2015,"Okay I lied, said I was never gonna come back but the manager Tiffany S. persuaded me to give it another try. We came back on a  pretty slow Sunday night and sat on the patio. I must admit, this time around we had a far better experience. This time our server was Nick, he was very nice and attentive, really a pleasure.  This time, we started off with the crispy calamari ($10.95) which comes w marinara and garlic aoli. I loved it because it was perfectly breaded. Next, we had a Cesar salad and clam chowder. We ordered the cedar salad as a side w my entree. It was huge! Large enough to share w 2 ppl. The clam chowder was SO GOOD! Full of clams and had the right creamy texture. For the main course, we had jambalaya ($17.50) and a full rack of ribs ($21.95). The jambalaya was okay, it didn't excite my taste buds but to be fair I was kind of full from our appetizers. The rack of ribs was amazing though, it was saucey and fall-off-the-bone tender.  To sum up, I am glad I came back and gave this place a try. I was really appreciative of the great service by Nick and the delicious food. Thanks BJ's and Tiffany!"
Donna G.,"Los Angeles, CA",576,580,1164,2.0,11/15/2015,"A disappointing dining experience, and so many things went wrong. The best thing was it was Happy Hour, and there was football, and there was a lot of good looking men in the bar area. So normally for a dining experience like this I would only give them 1 star - but I give them an extra point for the ambiance.  We sat at a table to order happy hour. Cocktails were only $1 off. I ordered a Peach Margarita. It arrived - sugar all over the rim of the glass. So sickening sweet I could barely drink it. I looked at the menu, nowhere did it say sugar on the rim. My friend tried it and said it didn't even taste like a margarita.  I never, ever send anything back, but I had to send this back. I told the Waitress it was totally undrinkable. She brought me another Peach Margarita - a very weak peach margarita. It tasted like a peach margarita, but there was very little alcohol. Terrible cocktails. Should have ordered a beer or wine instead. So after that, my friends and I are chatting, and we start saying ""Wheres our food?"". So we have to hail down the waitress, and ask her to go check on our food. It finally arrives. My Mahi Mahi tacos were okay, nothing fabulous, just okay. They came with chips.  Then we get our checks.  No happy hour discounts applied on any of the happy hour items. We are charged full price. My friend had ordered a deep dish pizza which was supposed to be half off. I know mine is only $1 off the cocktail, but its the principle of the thing - you say you are going to give me a dollar off, then give me the dern dollar off.  They adjust the bills, and my friends still isn't right. By this time we call the Manager over, and the Manager works on getting the bills corrected to reflect the Happy Hour prices. Then on top of that, they do not validate for parking in the Mall.  If you are coming here to eat food, forget it. I think you would have a better time if your came to watch football with the guys during happy hour."
Julie T.,"Los Angeles, CA",971,400,1341,1.0,11/2/2014,"Everything was a disappointment. From the service to the food. After we ordered and got our food, we didn't have any utensils or napkins. We had to remind the waiter two times! They didn't even take out menus through out our whole meal. When I finally received my turkey club sandwich with fries, I asked for ketchup from one of the food runners. Of course he forgot and I looked at him when he came back and he look at me and kept walking. Also our waiter messed up my boyfriends order!  The sandwich I ordered was honestly way to salty to even eat. I was pretty upset my boyfriend had to pay for my food that I didn't touch. When we got our check and our server never came back? So we asked another server next to us to grab our check. He says in a very rudely tone ""I'm not going to do it for you. Your server is.""  No more chain restaurants for me."
Randy B.,"Westlake Village, CA",4983,2338,4473,3.0,9/16/2014,"It's an okay location.  Busy, small, and very slow service.  Feels like a bar, with a small outside patio on 2 sides on the restaurant.  I don't recommend it as a destination place, but if you are at Century City Mall, it's a consideration. Service wanes (and get's the biggest hit here), but food is consistently good.  Recently, I had a Turkey Burger that was outstanding, and my fav fav fav thing is, the BBQ Chicken Chop Salad.  Of course, you can't go wrong with the brews. PS.  If for lunch, arrive closer to 1130am, or you will have a tremendous wait if you come at 12pm noon."
Shannon N.,"Los Angeles, CA",117,595,186,1.0,8/4/2015,"Used to be a fan of this place, in different locations years back. I was happy when one was opening up in Century City since it was closer than others I usually had to make an effort to get to (Woodland Hills, Glendale, Burbank, West Covina). Go figure, more convenient doesn't mean a good thing. As for the company, it's solely this location I've faced issues.  A lot of items I favored in the past have also been removed (that of course is company wide; I certainly don't blame this location for that obviously). I do believe they still carry the stuffed baked potato classic, which may be available only during lunch time. They also used to have some decent lunch specials (salad/mini pizza, and a former favorite, the meat sauce spaghetti lunch portion which was done Really well, RIP).  This review comes after multiple visits, whether dining in or take away. While dining in, we took a seat near the bar area after being told to seat ourselves. Took forever to flag down a server. Then another delay to place the order. On the good side, food came out rather quickly but was just okay (California club flatbread pizza and parmesan crusted chicken dish). But things just went downhill when we waited another long period for the check. True no one was rude per se, but just lazy and slow. It was not very busy during this time, so I just didn't see the reason why things were as bad as they were at this time.  As for takeout, the girls always seem to have an attitude, and it doesn't really make me want to come here anymore. A shame since it's so very close to where we work."
Anthony R.,"Los Angeles, CA",40,176,32,2.0,9/9/2015,"I like BJ's (really only go for lunch).  I go every few weeks. The food is predictable, and the pizza is deep dish and good.  Not many places have deep dish or know how to make it. Today, I went for lunch, and it was so freakin uncomfortable---even though the air conditioning was on, all the windows were open.  The air basically was negligible---and it was super hot, and not pleasant.  An employee told me the manager insisted on leaving hte windows open.  WHoever this manager is, she made a very bad decision.  Not only was blasting the air a totally unenvironmental choice with the windows open, it was a waste of energy.   If this person is running a place I decide to put food in my mouth, I think I will somewhere else."
Nikita J.,"Bellevue, WA",257,94,130,2.0,4/15/2015,"Our server Nastassja was a surprisingly wonderful for this kind of establishment. She answered all of our questions and seemed to genuinely care about us as customers. She recommended a great beer for me since I was overwhelmed by the vast amount of choices. I explained I loved beers brewed with fruits since gives them a subtlety sweet note without making them sweet like ciders. She said they didn't have anything like that but recommended the hefe for its notes of citrus. It was purrfect.  We ordered Potato Skins cause I've been craving them for the 1st time in years. They were cooked perfectly but they were hardly garnished with cheese, bacon, maybe 5 tiny uneven slices of chives :( they had all the potential to be derish! Just divide the appropriate amount of garnishes up among the individual potato skins!  2.5/5   Then we got the Asians Chicken Lettuce Wraps because we felt like fattys and that sounded healthy. They were a hard pass... as I'm sure most of you expected. 1/5 just no. We also ordered 2 margaritas which we had to send back cause they were so sweet and sour it was literally undrinkable! Ask them to use 1/4 of the simple and 1/2 of the sour and they were still pretty *meh* but at least we could drink them."
Grace C.,"Monrovia, CA",272,841,720,3.0,6/30/2015,"Convenient location to grab some drinks before watching a movie, or to indulge in some drinks after a heavy meal of fried chicken and waffles. =p  Unfortunately, BJ's does not provide parking validations, so you may need to do some shopping or catch a movie to ease the parking price. We had a pitcher drink-off with 4 of our group members. Note for those waiting to try: it is easier to chug using the tall skinny glasses than the stout ones.  Server was awesome in bringing/offering the winning team a free small pizookie. My peach iced tea came on the rocks. Enjoy a seat in their patio section - great view, fresh air, heat lamps ready if cold. Free wifi here too!"
Emily G.,"West Hollywood, CA",374,219,216,4.0,6/21/2015,"What a fun happy hour place! $4 beers (craft included) and super cheap other drinks (sorry I don't remember other prices)?! Count me in! I recently came here with some friends right after work and we were seated immediately - the vibe of the place was fun, and the beer was good - I recommend trying BJ's brews. The red ale is really strong! Although we didn't order any of the appetizers, they looked really good and were listed at pretty unbeatable prices. I'll be back!"
Kristy L.,"San Francisco, CA",512,248,984,3.0,9/8/2014,"Features: -We had the golden beet and arugula salad, chicken wings, and California Club pizza (chicken breast, smoked bacon, tomatoes, mozzarella, roasted garlic aioli, and avocado).   -My favorite was the golden beet and argula salad.  The salad tasted fresh, and those golden beets were firm and tasteful.    -The traditional wings were spicy.  They were drizzled with buffalo and ranch sauce (everything is good with spicy buffalo and ranch).  Although good, I feel like they weren't anything special.  -The California Club pizza was okay.  I couldn't really taste the smoked bacon, I feel like the avocado and mozzarella cheese took over the flavor of the pizza. Improvement: -I wish their service was faster.  It took so long to get water, to order, and to get the bill.  Tips: -The salad is a must order.  Yum! -Sit outside because of the nice view!"
Daniel H.,"San Francisco, CA",87,300,205,2.0,1/14/2014,"I've been here a few times now, and some days are a hit and others are a miss. This review is for my most recent dining experience here because I feel that this day especially was a little but more subpar that usual. Food: For a large chain restaurant, the one thing that I usually look forward to is the amount of consistency in the preparation of the meals, and that fell short on this visit. We ordered an angel hair pasta, and the pasta was cooked a little bit overdone, so it ended up being a lot more soft than normal. The first few bites seemed like they were decent, but as you ate more of it you start to realize there is something wrong with the way the pasta was cooked, which was a huge disappointment for us. We also ordered a cajun chicken pasta dish, and while the food was cooked okay, I found that there was a huge disproportion between the amount of meat to the amount of pasta. Even though everything tasted okay, there were only a few slices of meat for a whole plateful of pasta. So when the meat was gone, I just ended up with a lot of pasta that didn't taste very good on its own. Service: I was disappointed because the service here is usually better, but clearly things have changed since my last visit. I have to admit though that the servers here are polite, but the service and amount of attention we received this night was really lacking. The person helping us out took our orders, and was absent for the majority of the meal when we needed our water glasses to be refilled. We even had to ask another waiter for things because we had no idea where ours had gone for the duration of our meal. Our server finally showed up again when it came time to pay our bill, but I wished she were there for the middle of it as well. Atmosphere: It's your typical BJ's setting, and very casual overall. The one good thing about this location is that it is located in the Westfield Century CIty mall, which makes it a convenient place to grab some food after you are done shopping for the day. It's a good place to come chill and hang out with friends, and is normally even better when the food and the service are great as well! I would probably still return here, and just hope that my latest experience here was an off-night because I have definitely experienced better food and service at this location before."
Phoenix_Rising X.,"Los Angeles, CA",1683,123,843,3.0,10/20/2015,"I like going to BJ's but honestly I won't go out of my way. The food here isn't exactly stellar by any stretch of the imagination, but it's not bad either. I have tried their burgers, pizzas, pastas, & their signature dessert Pizookie or watchamacalit. It was all just mediocre. However, two of their dishes  stood out for me.  One, was their BEER BATTERED FISH & CHIPS with Signature Vinegar sauce.  It was really tasty, & would order it again, & again. Second dish I like is their BBQ RANCH CHICKEN SALAD.  Yes you read that right, BBQ & RANCH mixed together to form a dressing that's killer! As for the ambiance.....well, lunch hour is almost always a zoo so unless you like that kind of stuff I suggest avoiding lunch time altogether.  Late afternoon is usually more chill.  Their bar is so so. It really depends on your bar tender.  The waitresses here came & go I noticed.  So don't expect to have a ""regular"" waitress.  Chances are, the next time you come back, they'll be long gone. Location is inside the Westfield Century City Mall, first floor. across from Equinox Fitness. So depending of the hours of the day, it can get busy, & or pretty calm."
Stephanie L.,"Santa Monica, CA",285,676,6,4.0,10/17/2014,"There are two reasons to go to BJ's: 1)  Buffalo Chicken Pizza 2)  Pizookie If you are coming for: 1)  Great service 2)  Delicious and healthy food options Then you're SOL, cuz BJ's is not the place for any of that. However, if you love buffalo sauce and buffalo chicken, then the Buffalo Chicken Pizza is the way to go.  I promise you won't be disappointed.  I also get a side of ranch to dip my pizza in because, why not? Most importantly, after the pizza, it is now time for the oh so glorious Pizookie.  I always order the OG chocolate chunk pizookie.  Right outta the oven, the cookie is piping hot and gooey topped with a couple (or maybe 3) scoops of vanilla ice cream.  Seriously, this is the best.  I have noticed afterward, I am in a bit of a drunken state from the amount of calories and sugar I have ingested during the meal.  But, it is well worth it! Lots of parking in the garage below.  Look for the red painted walls, that's where the nearest escalators are to BJs."
Case P.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,27,44,1.0,10/11/2015,"So, you better not be a baseball fan and expect to watch one of the very few MLB playoff baseball games if there happens to be an NFL game on at the same time. The management took the playoff baseball game off of all monitors except one tiny TV with major sun glare and put on the NY Giants (2 and 2) and the 49ers (1 and 2) In lieu of watching two of the hottest MLB teams fight it out in an elimination game to finish the ALDS series. I will never come here again and they should be ashamed to thwart their baseball fans for such a lack luster NFL match up...for God's sake, don't you even know the levity of sports competition? Ridiculous!"
Tiffany N.,"Los Angeles, CA",127,47,17,1.0,8/5/2015,"The worst service ever. We got their around 8pm and we told the server that we were trying to catch a 10pm movie. It took him 30 min to come and take our order. Then, he messed up two of my friends' orders so we had to wait for that. Our poor friends were watching us quickly scarf down our foods, trying to make the movie. Our server said that he was going to make it up to us by giving us 2 pizookies which we were pretty stoked on. We thought that he was going to give us 2 orders of the standard sized pizookie. NOPE. He gave us two itty bitty pizookies  (they were the size that came with the sampler). Then...the check. Our party wasn't even that big (around 7 of us) and we wrote down exactly how much to charge on each card. Apparently that was too difficult because it took him and the manager another 30 min to process.  Long story short, we were 25 minutes late to the movie so we all missed the first 5-10 minutes of Mission Impossible. Not only is the service terrible, but the food was also no-go. I grew up eating BJ's and it's always one of those places that I enjoy eating it ever so often but the food this time was just not at all up to the standards of how I grew up eating it. The pizza/pizza crust were soggy, the potato wedges were cold, our side salad had no dressing in it (supposed to be tossed in balsamic vinaigrette). So disappointing.  This place is seriously understaffed with no customer service skills. Also, the cleanliness of this place needs a lot of work - there were a ton of unbussed tables."
Gabriela C.,"Los Angeles, CA",154,18,4,2.0,7/24/2015,"Your first encounter at a place is usually important.  Kind of like a ""first impression"" and the blonde young girl at the front is the worst person they could have picked to be a hostess.  She has such an attitude, she's passive aggressive, and she looks constipated all the time. Literally not once have I seen her smile.  I'm writing this review after dealing with her 3 times now (company lunch ins) and I just can't wrap my head around her still having a job.   From me calling ahead and telling her we wanted an outside table for a party of 8 and once we arrived her telling us we didn't request that (with SUCH an attitude), to me asking her for a pack of matches and her giving me the rudest look and saying ""we don't have matches, ugh"" to her whole demeanor.  If you hate your job so much, don't be there.  Don't have a party of 10 come in all smiley excited to enjoy lunch for you to rain on their parade with your face. Then the server... my god.  I called management over to ask for a different one because one was just so rude to our VP I couldn't handle it.  I've been in the service industry, including hostess, bartender, server, manager and the attitudes of these people are just ridiculous.  EVERYONE gets busy, EVERYONE gets in the weeds and stressed out - that's no excuse to lash out or be rude and bitchy. I give two stars, because the food is decent and the manager was sweet. Very disappointed with this place and will not be coming back or recommending anyone to go to that location."
Lisa M.,"Torrance, CA",68,37,89,2.0,8/6/2015,"This review is going to be short and to the point. Went in last night for dinner. Female hostess nice and friendly. Male host not so much. Food good. Drinks good. Server bad (took forever to take order, rarely came to check on us to see if we needed anything). Busboys non-existent. Drinks never got refilled (not even water), food took F-O-R-E-V-E-R, empty plates/dishes never got taken away. Was there even a manager on shift? Who knows? He/She never went into patio area. TRAIN YOUR SERVERS!"
Forrest N.,"Austin, TX",29,42,12,3.0,7/30/2015,"Food is pretty good along with the beer. However, the service the last 2 times I've been here has been terrible. The waitress had an attitude and was not friendly toward us. When she took our order she acted annoyed and basically just went through the motions. I wasn't about to give up on BJ's, but after the second failed attempt I probably won't be back for a while. Now about the food. I ordered a veggie burger with thin fries and it was great! Flavors were all there and it was very filling. I also ordered the BJ's porter and liked it a lot. It has a chocolatey mid tone with sort of a malty finish. If you go here for some beer, I would recommend this one. I'm sure the waitresses were just having off days but I think I'm going to give it a break for a while and maybe come back when they have been cycled through."
Erica J.,"Annapolis, MD",89,218,90,3.0,10/7/2014,My sis and I went to watch Monday night football. Seattle beat the Skins. No surprise there! Anywhoo...we ordered a deep dish pizza with mushrooms and basil. It was ok. It lacked cheese and sauce. My sister actually ordered a side of marinara to dip her pizza. I also ordered a diet pepsi (Yummers) and a side salad. The salad was great! It had bacon (bacon makes everything taste better) and chopped eggs with a vinaigrette dressing.  My sister had a dessert called the pazookie. It was a hot baked cookie with a scoop of ice cream on top. She ordered the pumpkin cookie which was seasonal. She said it was really good. Our waiter was pretty cool. He was friend and upbeat. The staff in general was very friendly.
Jeff D.,"Los Angeles, CA",152,142,135,1.0,7/30/2014,"Another sad chain I still had the nerve to step foot in. This Bj's is actually nice considering the open window area which is adjacent from Equinox.  Food is all typical American which I am sure you have tried. Nothing specaular but the pizza is awesome.  I do recommend the Pizooie but I don't recommend the waiter informing me that the ticket fell and no one saw it. In other words, I waited an extra 30 min to get my dessert. I was trying to get his attention to cancel the order but he failed to even show face ever. I did complain to the manager and she was extremely nice and gave me vouchers to come back. But I said no babygirl, you must also take this dessert off as well. She did it with no hesitation. It seems everyone from Ave of the Stars comes to eat here for lunch so be aware and get there at a timely manner.  Parking is sadly a dollar an hour"
Jennifer W.,"Monrovia, CA",552,762,2384,3.0,6/6/2012,"This BJ's doesn't take reservations, just ""call ahead"" spots because it is in the Century City Mall and walking distance from several large business buildings (everyone going to lunch around the same time). Having a call ahead appointment didn't help for a party of 6, we still had to wait a while before being seated. It's probably not the place you want to go for lunch if you only have an hour to eat and be back in the office. Their outdoor seating overlooks the street so it's kind of bright. Their bar area is cramped (we originally tried to seat ourselves here for lunch while waiting for a table ;).  BJ's has lunch specials which offers a variety of combinations like a lunch portion entree and a side salad or soup. I ordered the Cajun Chicken Pasta ( ) )with a vinaigrette side salad ( ). Both were decent in taste but lacked presentation.  This might be a nice location to check out for happy hour or after work. Pass on lunch for me!"
Ruth R.,"Koreatown, Los Angeles, CA",93,15,197,4.0,11/14/2015,Generally is good. Nice pick for a Saturday lunch before movie time. Server is friendly. Food presentation speed could have been improved.
January Y.,"Santa Monica, CA",163,31,1958,3.0,7/6/2014,"The staff isn't the most efficient or most knowledgeable, but the majority are friendly. They started a rewards program and mobile pay, but none of the servers have been able to give us any detailed information without having to ask the manager.  We've been to various BJ's locations and at every single one, service has been consistently slow, even when it's not busy. Sometimes, I still get annoyed, but for the most part, I've come to expect it and accept it. I'm going to blame the service shortcomings on management for not properly training their employees and for understaffing.  We come here often, so we've had a range of experiences (from really bad to pretty good). Overall, we enjoy the food. They have the best gluten-free pizza and that alone is enough to keep us coming back."
Stella P.,"Los Angeles, CA",152,307,134,2.0,3/25/2014,"I had a very ""meh"" reaction to my BJ's experience. Everything was fine, nothing was great.  We went during happy hour and even with the discounted prices we ended up walking out having spent $20+ each. Which is steep for pizza and beer. The pizza was fine, we got the BBQ chicken, the ingredients were pretty bland and it tasted like the crust had been soaked in margarine before it was cooked. Appetizers off the happy hour menu were slightly better. I liked the spinach artichoke dip the best out of everything we ordered. The beer was fine, I think next time (if I come back) I will order one of the guest beers rather than their own stuff.  Our waitress was very attentive and nice. Bathrooms were clean.  Parking is easy in the Westfield Mall. BJ's does not validate, but Gelson's and AMC do if you have reason to visit either of those."
Courtney J.,"Mid-City West, Los Angeles, CA",11,8,16,5.0,10/28/2014,"Came to BJ's two weekends ago with a group of friends. We originally went to catch a matinee at the AMC theater, but we were running late and ended up getting tickets for a later showing. So in the meantime we decided to go grab a bite to eat. I ordered the baked Italian omelet and it was delicious. The seasoned country potatoes were to die for as well. And my mimosa set the whole meal off lol.  Service was excellent. Will definitely be back the next time I go to AMC."
Ambar C.,"Los Angeles, CA",414,380,2264,3.0,1/29/2013,"Okay with me.  I dropped in with my fiance before catching a movie at the Century City mall.  We were seated right away, and our server promptly came by and introduced herself.  Her enthusiasm quickly diminished, however, when she could not convince us to order drinks.  We had to flag her down several times during the course of our meal. We started with the the ahi poke, which was good.  Some of the wonton chips were a little overcooked, but the ahi was not bad, and the guacamole was decent.  We also ordered mushrooms stuffed with the spinach and artichoke dip.  Some of the mushrooms were overcooked and dry, but the dip was tasty.  Finally, we split the BJ's classic combo pizza.  It had sausage, pepperoni, and mushrooms.  The sauce was just okay, not very flavorful.  The cheese was really heavy.  The pepperoni was a little greasy."
Lixxy M.,"Los Angeles, CA",212,82,193,4.0,9/9/2015,I absolutely love coming here for lunch. Busy but service is friendly and fast. Bar area is self seating so you sit quickly. Lots of tvs around to watch & enjoy. Great lunch menu and super affordable. I love the unlimited soup & salad combo $8.25. The chicken tortilla soup is a must try. Great happy hour menu and drinks.
Aimee N.,"Rolling Hills, CA",220,216,10,4.0,1/23/2015,"I don't understand the low rating. This place has really good pizzas, flat breads, chicken wings and the jalepeno burger is amazing. The prices are decent. The location is great. As for the service, like many other places, I guess it depends on who is serving. I've never had a bad experience."
Shelley C.,"Los Angeles, CA",470,646,455,4.0,5/17/2014,"I can't help it, but I just love BJs! I go to this location I'm the Century City mall frequently, and have never encountered an issue. The only thing that may be annoying is that it is in fact located in the mall, so parking and people can be an issue.  But the staff here has always been quick and friendly, and the food is always good. I like the grilled chicken pasta, mozzarella sticks, pizza, burgers, strawberry lemonade, steaks, you name it. Once the strawberry lemonade tasted really bad and we told our server who tried it and agreed something was off. He apologized and immediately brought is another one that tasted better.  It's near the AMC so you can always see a movie after!"
Cassandra B.,"Santa Monica, CA",664,133,117,5.0,1/14/2016,"This is a nice restaurant. However, since I am on a strict died and had already eaten I came in just for tea. This restaurant and bar area are huge. Very nice environment to meet with a group or friends for drinks or to watch a game. Also a nice place to meet for business. Great location."
J. O.,"Pasadena, CA",41,155,,2.0,3/24/2015,"My experience today for lunch at BJ's. - Lunch took forever to arrive (during a work day) - Pizza was 90% bread, 10% cheese, 0% sauce - Waitress neglected to inform me the dessert tray was hot so I burned two fingers Besides the beer, I don't see another reason to return here unless they make some BIG changes."
Megan F.,"Los Angeles, CA",23,19,4,1.0,12/16/2013,"My brother suffers from hypoglycaemia and we waited in the empty restaurant for 40 min with ZERO help from anyone.  Once we got up to leave.. he died, so I had to drag his body to The Counter across the way where they immediately revived him with a soda.  This has happened 8 times. From now on I will eat at The Counter.. Where they actually serve you within a reasonable amount of time."
Dakota Y.,"Santa Monica, CA",1,1,6,5.0,2/16/2015,Gluten free good as fuck certified . Got the gluten free pizza and the gf pizookie both caused intense mouth organism sensations so be prepared for that . My boo got the Thai chicken mango salad and the cookies and cream pizookie and she says there great also . John my waiter is the man great customer service someone needs to give him a promotion asap he should be running this place .
Scott K.,"Vancouver, Canada",2,28,52,2.0,9/4/2014,"Service is a joke! No cutlery on our table even after food was served. There are no toppings on the burger. They put it on the side and you have to assemble your own burger. No ketchup mayo on the side unless you ask. Refer to the picture of the ""bare back"" burger I have added. Fries taste like fish and not in a good way. And draft beer is served in glasses that are faaaaar from a pint. To top off the bad-service trifecta, the server did not take the empties away even after she served a second round of beer (again refer to the pics). I'd say there are better choices nearby."
Linda W.,"Atwater Village, Los Angeles, CA",784,400,784,2.0,11/13/2014,"Alas, another disappointing location for BJ's. Came here a couple times with my coworkers for lunch, and almost every time the service is lacking and food is just OK.  Most recent visit experience: Ordered the mahi-mahi (light entree) and the fish was too dry. BJ's isn't cheap, so I expect pretty decent quality, which means at least not-so-dry mahi mahi. Service was even worse. We came for my coworker's birthday, and everything went wrong... We were seated promptly. But after given our menus, our waitress completely forgot about us for 15 minutes and we had to get her attention to take our order. She first takes down our drink orders and comes back 5 minutes later to take the rest of our food orders. Our appetizers come before our drinks do, and yet again we had to ask a different waiter where our drinks were, and he apologized and said he will let our waitress know. Ironically, our waitress brought us our drinks looking as if we had asked for something ridiculous and didn't offer any apology. BJs offers a mini pizookie for anyone's birthday, so we waited a good 20 minutes after we finished our meal for the pizookie but it never arrived (this is after we had already asked the waitress once about it 15 minutes in and she said she would check with the kitchen). We left without eating the birthday pizookie. What a fail."
Sonya S.,"Inglewood, CA",256,743,937,2.0,12/30/2014,"This is the worst BJ's i have been too. You would think service would be better since it is in ""Century CIty.""  The waitress was terrible she was slow at everything. It was almost as if she forgot us.  My friend had to ask the person who bought our cocktails can we order.  He said, let me find your waitress.  SHe finally came to take our order.  That took forever. It was tasty but the service is very bad."
Nicole D.,"Bristol, CT",341,1543,221,3.0,4/18/2015,"I come to BJ's definitely for their beer. The service is always friendly and the beer is always great. To be honest, I'm not crazy about the food. It's your typical bar food, but it always leaves me a little disappointed, leaves a little something to be desired, and I feel it's a little overpriced for what you actually get. That being said, I still love their beer. This location is fun because you can grab a brew and then shop in this awesome mall, which happens to be my favorite."
