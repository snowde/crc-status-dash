Cecilia C.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,7,,1.0,11/8/2015,"If I could give this place no stars, I would.  One of the hostesses, who was incredibly cold and unfriendly, made it difficult for us to be seated comfortably. She seemed to think the restaurant is her exclusive domain.  We waited 15 minutes before a server showed up.  Plus, they ran out of tartar sauce for the fish 'n' chips at 5:30 pm!!!  The manager was ineffectual in resolving issues.  I will definitely not come back to this place."
Aram G.,"Santa Monica, CA",6,7,1,1.0,11/8/2014,Been waiting for 45min told it was going to be 15min. Asked about it and they some how took us off the waiting list... really not cool
Vaishnovi K.,"Brea, CA",58,148,67,3.0,10/9/2012,Went here to get some drinks with friends. The waitress came to our table and mentioned their specials which included many of their Oktoberfest beers. When we were ready to order she came back and told us that NONE of those beers were available along with some wines. How can you be a brewhouse but not have your specials stocked?? Bizarre. Won't go back here again.
Jermaine J.,"Pomona, CA",214,3,,1.0,9/5/2014,Just left after waiting 30 minutes and didn't even get acknowledged by a server.  I've never been this annoyed and pissed before leaving a restaurant in whole life.  The manager didn't even help us after we were seated. The waitress passed us twice and didn't say anything or even stop to take out drink order.  The BJ'S in Culver City is by far way better with service.  Please don't waist your time and/or money.
Caley B.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",1,20,37,5.0,10/29/2014,"Came here for happy hour and to watch game 7 of the World Series... Sat at the bar and Nicole helped us- the bar was packed and she was AMAZING. I don't think I have ever seen a bartender move as fast as her. Fantastic service, and all our food came out quickly and was delicious! Awesome experience."
Laura W.,"Flagstaff, AZ",133,8,,1.0,8/30/2014,"Horrendous. My friend and I were there at 2 pm on a Saturday for lunch prior to a movie. It was a bit busy, but by no means packed. We waited almost 10 minutes for our server to come over, and had to make him stay long enough to take our drink order. We waited 5+ minutes more for him to come back and take our food order (2 sandwiches) and then watched as he helped 3-4 other tables before putting in our order. We never did get his name. 30+ minutes later, we still had not eaten, and asked for our drink check. Another 5 minute wait! No one made any effort to apologize, or even offered as much as a discount on our drinks. I don't expect high-class dining, but basic service would have been nice. I will not be going back."
Jessie S.,"Hillsdale, NJ",2,74,6,4.0,9/28/2014,"Came for lunch, as I was staying across the street at the Hyatt. I really had no complaints. It was a Thursday around 1pm and wasn't too crowded. Food was pretty good and the service was decent. Our waitress probably could have been around more, but I didnt have nearly as bad of an experience as some people have reported. I would come back if I was in the area again."
Natalie B.,"West Hollywood, CA",272,140,1,3.0,4/2/2014,"What can I say? It's a bj's location: all American high-cal pizza and great original beers. There's a nice patio, and the inside is spacious with high ceilings. Happy hour is alright, but not spectacular. If you're looking for a beer in century city (and a corona from pink taco ain't your thing) check this place out. Friendly servers, quick service and yummy basic food.  But nothing to wrote home about."
John A.,"Culver City, CA",0,6,,3.0,10/17/2015,BJ's is a great family restaurant a great party restaurant the food is very good everything on their menu is delicious my favorite item are the ribeye steak in the barbecue smokehouse burger great flavors and very reasonable affordable price I eat there a lot maybe a couple times a month the service may be long but it's worth it
Naz H.,"Los Angeles, CA",96,130,11,4.0,4/16/2012,"I love this place, I have been to several locations and always go back.  I am a Chicago Gal and their pizzas are good, nothing close to GINOS East in Chicago but still good replacement.   I am a big fan of pizza, and this location is the best, in the Century City Mall.  Parking is easy and it works for me.  I also love the beer, I get the sampler every time, I love their little bits section, I get to indulge and not feel guilty.  Service is always the same and food is consistent."
C L.,"Beverly Hills, CA",7,119,,3.0,12/1/2011,"They have happy hours specials at the bars until 7pm I think M-Th and some other nights/times. Flat screen TVS everywhere so it's a decent place to catch a game. They only play the sound on Sunday nights however.  Mini-bruschetta: VERY good. I loved it. Mediterranean Pizza: different and good. It's like a greek salad on top of pizza crust. Comes with kalamata olives, roasted and diced tomatoes, chicken and yellow banana peppers. BBQ Chicken Pizza: didn't try this one but looked and smelled like the typical BBQ chicken pizza you would get from CPK, etc. Caesar salad: tasty. and a good deal during happy hour for the small portion. they drench the salad in dressing so ask for it on the side if you're not into that Chicken wings: my bf seemed to enjoy these a LOT... he got the garlic Parmesan flavored order.  Overall: decent food. not amazing by any means but casual and edible. an upbeat fun little place to go to from time to time. take advantage of their HH deals (half off mini-pizzas and $2 off appetizers!)"
Blanca G.,"Santa Monica, CA",2,16,12,2.0,11/8/2013,"SERVICE IS HORRIBLE!!. WTF. You would expect more from a restaurant in Century City.  Only reason giving two stars is because the food is really good and the bar is great but ""wholly"" not sure it makes up for the poor service. EXTREMELY SLOW.. and polite IDGF attitude ""we have plenty of customers"" to care."
Tiffany G.,"Studio City, CA",40,316,31,4.0,4/26/2014,"Happy hour is mon-fri 3-7pm!!!! And they do sun-thur 10- to close!! Extensive menu, so much to choose from and many drink options too."
Gilbert S.,"Tustin, CA",751,53,68,1.0,3/5/2012,Im not too satisfied with the food quality.. service Sucks.. parking is impossible and the wait is way too long ! Don't waste your time here !
Vanessa V.,"South Gate, CA",473,139,1064,2.0,8/27/2012,"A good place to eat lunch or dinner after work, although they sometimes forget to take out things from your meal."
Jason B.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,14,2,4.0,7/9/2013,"The deep dish at BJ's is some of the best I've ever had. It's oily enough to be delicious and make you think about how much oil you're consuming, but not like Pizza Hut oily. The alfredo sauce pizza, I think they call it Great White, is really awesome. The tomato based sauce pizzas are good to, but the white sauce is really exceptional. I guess it goes without saying that the Pizookie is a totally delicious dessert. Never pass it up. Some of the appetizers are kinf of lazy, and the wait to sit can be long, otherwise it's a 5 star place."
Daniel D.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,261,53,1.0,3/19/2014,The pizza was cold the pasta was cold the appetizer came after the main dish the beer was flat I ordered the Jeremiah red and it was awful I had it before and it was great the food got cold pretty quickly as if it was reheated
Ava B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,,1.0,8/5/2015,"I come to this location quite a bit because I live right down the street. Service is usually slow or the food is cooked wrong or their is no silverware when the food is put down whatever. This time around it took our apetizers 20 minutes and our food (the tacos, and my boyfriend had a Burger and fries, took almost 30 minutes! Luckily our server (can't remember his name but he was a short stocky black guy) kept calm and kept apologizing and even tried to lighten our mood by talking and just cracking jokes with us.  The tacos were nasty and runny and the chips were kind of soggy, and my boyfriends fries were cold :(.   I recommend if you plan on eating at BJ's, go to the Westwood or any other location. If you have to come to this location, good luck and ask for the short guy as your server!"
Seiji N.,"San Francisco, CA",122,250,26,3.0,2/23/2012,"I've always gone to the BJ's in westwood... and whoa, this BJ's looks super upscale with all the business wo/men having drinks after work. They have gigantic TVs and would definitely be an awesome place to watch a game. There were 4 of us in the party and we were seated right away and offered drinks. The server suggested drinks for us and also looked like sara bareilles. I had pizza earlier that day so I went with their Creole Tilapia... or so I thought. When I got my food they actually gave me the Chicken A La Fresca. You would think that I returned it and got my original order, but I was so distracted by the fact that our waitress looked liked sara bareilles that I ate my Chicken. For dessert with had the sampler pizzookie. Those things are so amazing... how do they make the cookies so soft? Other than the food mess up, the place was good, but seeing as how I'm going to a restaurant for the food experience, I can't over look that detail. Sorry BJ's, even though you look super nice, I gotta give you a three."
Ryan A.,"New York, NY",27,10,,5.0,8/2/2014,"Came here with a few  friends on a very busy friday night and Teresa, our waiter, was so attentive and even sat to listen to a sob story of a close friends recent passing once the crowd settled down. Food was great, service was amazing,  and drinks (long Island's for me ) were perfect. Great experience"
