Elizabeth C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,,5.0,11/12/2014,"cheap wide variety of  beers, good food, oh and of course LA's best bartender Kyle. The house brews are as good if not better then your National Brand beers. I personally love the Tatonka Stout. less bitter then the Guinness with 1% more alcohol. now you may think... so? well it is also CHEAPER!!!! better beer for cheaper will always get 5 stars in my book. so before you hit the theater or walk around the mall stop by here.  WARNING: this is a family/ after work kind of place. I personally don't care because i come to watch games and drink beers."
Joseph H.,"Los Angeles, CA",69,61,6,3.0,3/6/2015,"Love BJ's as a chain but this one was A-Ok. I almost always get buffalo chicken pizza and a chocolate chip pizookie. The food here didn't disappoint, but it took a while to get and service was a little slow. I tried their Brewhouse Blonde and it was pretty good. I was surprised with a birthday pizookie so that made me happy :)"
Anton N.,"Encino, Los Angeles, CA",22,128,92,5.0,5/23/2014,Nice place to go. Fast service freindly staff and they are open late. I love thier pizookie cookie. Also thier chicken noodle soup is the best. Overall great atmosphere and good tasting food. At nights there is no wait list which is nice
Karina E.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,,1.0,9/21/2015,"Never will I go back to this place. Let's start with the host the male and female RUDE!!!!!! Service was horrible took 20 mins to get our drink order from someone who wasn't our server when the server finally did come told him I wanted my app first then my entree. Had two other people who worked there come by our table with the wrong food. And our food took like 45 mins to come out and they came out together, we had no utensils and couldn't find anyone to get us some! Had to keep flagging down our server because he never came by. This location sucks and so does service!"
Henry C.,"Torrance, CA",3328,403,8,2.0,8/26/2013,"Redeeming the ""half off"" large pizza offer!  Get it from  !  Can't beat large deep dish for $12.25!!! Yep!  That was the best reason why I went to BJ's this past weekend!  I mean... you simply can't beat a large gourmet deep dish pizza for only $12.25!!! So why is the star rating so low?  Well... there are 2 sides to each of the story so let me kindly explain.... The Goods.... --Despite that the restaurant was crowded, we were able to get seated within 5 minutes.... --Host was friendly, and the server was friendly --Decent atmosphere... had a nice view on the balcony or terrace but didn't eat out there... Now onto the bad side that lead to the meh review.... --To start off, the server already messed up the drink order.... no big deal as he went quickly to get another one to our request -- We've ordered the Calamari as appetizer... however, the pizza came out before the calamari... no we've cancelled the order instead... --Food was actually not as good as the other BJ's restaurant... not sure why but my cheeseburger / great white pizza are not that tasty at al all.... should of stick to my regular order of BBQ chicken instead... --No validation... serious?  (This could be the fault of the plaza owner itself..) --Attentiveness of the server... yes.. he was a nice person but we only had our drink filled once and we had to ask for it... We still left a 15% tip regardless but for a restaurant like BJs could of been much better... Don't think I will go to this location again, but if you are there and convenient... this could possibly be an option... I think I'd rather be in the food court next time..."
C S.,"Los Angeles, CA",683,395,33,4.0,10/10/2013,I ducked into this place to watch a baseball game AND not witness my wifey doing damage to our bank accounts. I sat at the bar and was surprised how friendly the bartenders were especially Kyle.  I don't know about the rest of the place but the bar is the place to be. As for the food...I mean its a BJ's and in a mall so don't expect fine dining.  I thought the flat breads were alright and the deep dish is on par with Numero Uno which doesn't say much. The drinks are poured strong so that's what matters.
Jennifer N.,"Long Beach, CA",444,1095,12255,4.0,8/17/2011,"This is my favorite location of the few BJ's I've been to. But it's also will break your piggy bank with the parking fees!!! No validation... We paid $11 for parking to dine and shop at this crazy mall century city mall. I get hit in the wallet every time, and I still don't learn my lesson! lol  Back to BJ's. Love the tap here at the bar! Too bad I don't drink! We sat at the bar and had ourselves a great munchies. Not to mention Pizookie and their root beer!  Their chips and salsa are on the weak side.... real weak. :-("
Sergio L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,12,23,1.0,2/13/2015,"The place has awful service, you place in order, and it never fails for them to get something wrong on your order!!! Manager has to be on them about these stuff . I give it a two thumbs down"
Pete P.,"Rancho Mirage, CA",2,47,,2.0,3/14/2015,"I've been here twice in the last week and both times were disappointing. The food is OK but the service is terrible. We got the wrong food, had to ask repeatedly for utensils and napkins and some of our food never arrived. On top of that nobody ever asked if we wanted more drinks. It's like there is nobody managing this restaurant."
Yi Z.,"Oakland, CA",681,2747,1045,2.0,1/25/2012,"Even though it's one of the four busiest weeks of the year for work, we decided to have a work lunch for the WHOLE office. You know I'm not one for turning down free meals but this time I was in a hurry to eat and get back. Of course I had low expectations given that we had a party of 20. The server was nice and did a decent job accommodating everyone's needs and taking orders.  We had two large tables and each table started with a ""Best Beginnings"" platter. It was definitely the best part of the entire meal.  After waiting another 25 minutes, we got our entrees. That was pretty fast considering the size of our group. Too bad my entree was terrible.  I got the ""New"" $5.95 Chicken Quesadilla lunch special.  I don't even know why I ordered a cheap entree since the meal was FREE to me anyway.  It was the worst quesadilla I've ever had. The tortillas they used are probably not even tortillas.  The thing was as hard as a brick.  I opted out on the beans and asked for some rice instead. The rice was not appetizing at all. So the lesson we learned today is: DO NOT order the Chicken Quesadilla."
Jennifer M.,"Lake Forest, CA",34,118,286,3.0,5/23/2014,"Came here for dinner before a movie. Ordered the pepperoni flatbread which was really good, and for dinner I ordered the chicken quesadilla . It was really good too. Service was good but the place was busy so it took the server a while to come around . Noise level is ok but during happy hour it can get pretty loud. Would still come again. They have good lunches and the double chocolate pazookie it to die for."
Daniel S.,"Los Angeles, CA",136,74,43,5.0,2/2/2015,Nicole G was very nice and welcoming. Loved her!  Wish her the best in San Francisco.
M.K. P.,"Signal Hill, CA",0,37,,4.0,3/2/2014,"This review isn't necessarily about the food, but rather about a specific server that was AWESOME! We went to BJ's last night for pre-dinner drinks and appetizers (we had a late night reservation across the street at the Craft). We sat at a booth in the bar area and had the pleasure of being served by Nicole G. We are hoping that her manager will see this review because she was by far one of the friendliest and most efficient servers any of us has had in a LONG time (not only at BJ's, but in general).  She had a bubbly personality and seemed genuinely happy to take our order and bring us anything that we needed. We were celebrating a birthday and she made an extra effort to make him feel like it was his special day. She chatted with us and even made jokes. She was quick to take our order, quick to bring our shots, drinks, appetizers, etc. Overall, she was amazing. All five of us could not get over how kind and pleasant she was throughout our dining experience. If we were to go back to this specific BJ's, I know we would all request to sit in her section. Thank you, Nicole, for the wonderful service and for making our friend's birthday experience even better. Keep up the good work!"
Kali M.,"San Jose, CA",160,1010,94,2.0,5/28/2012,"A chain is a chain, but given its location one would expect a bit more from this BJ's.  We had flights of beer tastings, some appetizers and a shared entree.  All the food was seriously sub-par, and the beer barely made up for it. With all the choices at Century City Mall, I just can't see how BJ's can compete.  I'd rather eat at the food court (and I do, on a regular basis, because it's a seriously kick-butt food court)."
Rachel M.,"Los Angeles, CA",711,688,527,3.0,7/3/2011,"It's another dining option at the Century City Mall. I've haven't been to a BJ's in a while. So I was look forwarding to the opening of this location. The space is bigger than I expected. There is outdoor and indoor seating. Although it looked busy, we were seated right away. Service was fast, and our server was friendly (4 stars). She frequently checked up on us.    My boyfriend ordered the tomato mozzerella salad as a starter (3 stars). They're not the best tomatoes and mozzerella, but it was tasty and refreshing on summer evening for only $2.95. I ordered the Burger Melt (2 stars). I was very disappointed since this is my go to order at BJ's. The patty was overcooked, and I couldn't taste the cheese. I chose the thin fries (4 stars) as my side. I also ordered a strawberry lemonade (4 stars). Although there weren't strawberries in it, the strawberry flavor was evident and was more than just a pink lemonade.    We ended with a pizookie (3 stars). The warm ooey gooey chocolate chip cookie with the vanilla ice was good but not as amazing as I remember. I use to adore pizookies, but I guess I'm just over them.    I would definitely choose BJ's over Houston's or RockSugar. It's a good pre-movie dining option."
Karen C.,"San Jose, CA",163,507,424,4.0,3/5/2014,I have been here a couple times when I have been in town for business.  I had lunch here recently with a group of coworkers.  It was not that busy on a Monday at lunchtime so we got a table right away.  The waitress came over pretty quickly to take our drink orders.  We were ready with our food orders so you too those too.  My coworkers all had salads which they enjoyed.  I had the flatbread and salad combo from the lunch menu.  I had the chicken club flat bread.  It had good flavor and good toppings.  The salad was a simple side salad but it was tasty too.  It was on their lighter menu but was still pretty filling.  I am sure this place gets busy at night and on weekends but we had a good experience.
Evelyn L.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,20,1,1.0,4/4/2015,"Decided to eat here after catching a movie with friends. And how I wish we would of gone somewhere else. The service is terrible (drink got to us 20 minutes after ordering, food took a while, waiter was so slow and forgetful) .The specialty info listed on the business section clearly isn't being followed at this particular location."
Brittany F.,"Los Angeles, CA",4606,1529,1468,4.0,6/16/2011,"One word: Pazookie  I can't even begin to describe this miraculous dessert! But I'll do my best... A warm, gooey, half-baked cookie, comes out of the oven with a sizable scoop of vanilla ice cream on top, already melting from the hotness of the cookie. Oh yea, it's that good. But there's more: you can choose from flavors like peanut butter, oatmeal raisin, red velvet, chocolate chip, triple chocolate and oreo. AND you can do a split - half of one flavor and half of another. SERIOUSLY PEOPLE?! Does life get any better? I don't think so... So how do you choose? Well, I went with my best friend last night and we ordered 2 pazookie's: one with half red velvet, half triple chocolate and one with half oreo and have chocolate chip. People were staring. It was complete madness. Two HUGE pazookies for the Skinny Critic and her friend. I must admit the red velvet was a little too sweet but the oreo, chocolate chip combo was genius. I kind of want to go back already.  And each pazookie is only $5!! It's quite a steal if you ask me!  Oh and our server was totally awesome and didn't even care that we were just order pazookies even though we were seated at a 4 top. LOVE THIS PLACE.  I think next time I'll even order some savory food to start!"
Christy K.,"Raleigh, NC",17,50,65,1.0,1/4/2014,"Give me a break. Two listings for the same restaurant on yelp? This place isn't newly opened. It's been here forever, and it sucks. I've enjoyed the one in Burbank, so I can't figure out why this one is so bad.  We stopped in last night for a quick bite and a drink. We had a small child with us and were not offered a high chair or booster. We had to steal silverware from an empty table after asking for it and being ignored twice. Order was: Harvest Hefeweizen: Bitter and flat. A little nutty, which isn't how a Hefeweizen is supposed to taste. They never clean the lines, from the taste of the beer.  Beer/cider: I can't remember the name of it, but it was Jeremiah Red mixed with cider. It was watery and gross.  Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms: They were okay. Edible, but nowhere near great. Stuffing was like an oily cream mixture and we couldn't taste any spinach. Meh. Crispy Artichokes: Deep fried beyond recognition. Nearly burnt. Complete mush inside and very salty. Calamari: Another meh. It was edible. They serve it with ranch. Whaaaat? Not everything needs ranch. Gross. Kids meals consisted of a pizza and grilled cheese. There were no healthy options for littles. We couldn't even get wheat bread for the grilled cheese. No fresh fruit option. Just deep-fried everything. My son complained that the pizza was salty. My 2 year old ate her fries. The cheese in that sandwich didn't taste like cheese, and didn't look like it either.  The waitress made sure to remind us that she would appreciate a tip. We won't be back. We've really changed our eating habits in the past year, and while we knew this wouldn't be a healthy night out, we will save our splurges for places that deserve it.  Also, they do NOT validate! You're going to pay for parking to eat subpar food and crappy drinks."
Cristina L.,"Studio City, CA",50,11,82,4.0,9/23/2013,"This place is near where I live (and ironically where I currently temporary work) I come here often. I admit I mostly sit at the bar. It's easier to grab a solo seat for a bite of lunch or dinner so you don't look weird sitting alone at a table/booth looking like you were just stood up on a date or something. But I have dined in other areas of the restaurant as well when I do bring company. Most of the bartenders double as servers so I've interacted with many of the employee's here.  Kyle, Jason, Stevie, Chad, Caleb, Kelsey, Cassie... they are only but a few bartenders/servers who I think are utter rock stars. They are also reasons why I keep returning and why I rank this place so highly. The bartenders/servers bend themselves over backwards to fix things whenever things go wrong.  The hostess's have always been polite to me. I like the food. I've never had a problem with the food here. I love the management for the most part. Erin always makes an effort to greet me every time she sees in me in the restaurant. Which is very nice!! I don't know him much but Kyle (if I got his name right), the other manager is great. I always see him smiling, all over the restaurant, and interacting with customers. I feel really bad saying this but Steven the other manager I think he's ok... I mostly see him in the front of the restaurant by the hostess stand or take out area. He has never in all my visits ever greeted or talked to me like Erin makes the effort to... and I've seen him more than I do the other managers. I saw him handle a hard situation once where someone couldn't pay their bill so I can't say anything really negative about him. But sometimes his interactions with some of the ladies I witness makes me feel as though I have an itchy sweater on at times?? (aka a little awkward??). But all in all, management is good. Sometimes the food is slow coming out. But whenever that rarely occurs the servers/bartenders are great in handling it. Apologizing and speeding it up and/or helping me to take it to go (if I have to rush back to the office). I've only experienced one bad server here but I've seen he no longer works at this BJs. So I can't say much more then that. Their lunch specials are a good deal. And I like how they have a calorie count in their menu.  I like this place. I come here for the great lunch specials, happy hour, and the service :) EDIT: I witnessed the manager Steven handle a situation very well where the food took 45 minutes to come out. He came over to the gentleman next to me and apologized, even competing an appetizer in apology. Another example of how, even when things go wrong and/or don't come out right, the staff try their hardest to make it right"
