Brandon L.,"Torrance, CA",4,40,40,1.0,3/21/2015,"For the following reasons I am rating one star; we had to ask for napkins and utensils after our food was served, the appetizer was served late and incorrectly and worst of all there were small flies buzzing around our table and food the entire time (while we are sitting inside). Additionally, all three plates provided were dirty with dried food and dirt."
Doris D.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,44,17,1.0,5/3/2015,"Worst restaurant experience ever! I can't even say they were understaffed because the restaurant wasn't busy. I couldn't even get anybody's attention, they would look the other way. Even after we brought it to manager's attention still couldn't get the service. Will never go back!! To bad yelp doesn't have 0 star"
Robert B.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,152,77,3.0,9/5/2013,"Walked in with my son and was ignored for almost a full minute while the hostess argued with a busboy in front of us. She then said, ""How many,"" and that was the last she spoke to us. Nicole, our server, was very friendly and professional, and instantly put me in a better mood. Food server never gave us any eye contact and didn't say a word as he dropped our food. Food was pretty tasty. I think BJ's is a good value. On our way out we passed by two hostesses and a busboy and were ignored by all three. Very glad that Nicole was so good, because other wise, this would have a been a really rough meal."
Elizabeth A.,"Los Angeles, CA",147,64,40,5.0,2/24/2015,A young woman with blonde hair helped us first. She gave my mom a fabulous suggestion. My mom rarely drinks and she suggested my mom get a Strawberry Splash. Just wonderful!  I wish I got her name! Also Natassja (sp) was our server she was so absolutely sweet.very patient with us. My mom likes to camp out while we catch up and Natassja never rushed us. We ordered a chicken club with seasoned wedges. I got happy hour swings and Santa fe spring rolls. Great deal for happy hour eeeerverything was delicious!
Sandra D.,"Culver City, CA",134,48,19,4.0,10/7/2014,"I must say, I had lunch here today and my food was delicious! I'm not sure if they have changed Chef's, but the spinach stuffed mushrooms were particularly delicious! The Thai Mango Chicken salad was soooo good! I have eaten here several times before because it is so close to my office. The food doesnt usually scream excellence...but today's meal came pretty close!!"
Wendy W.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,10,,1.0,11/2/2013,"This place is near work and we occasionally come for lunch or after work drinks and food.   The service is extremely slow - even if you are sitting at the bar.  Some of us will order two drinks at a time to compensate for the long delays between seeing your server, ordering, and receiving your drinks.  Pay with cash or request your check early if you are tight on time at all.   The food is so so.  About what you would expect at any Applebee's type restaurant.  It is not terrible, but not great.  The drinks pours can be generous (if you ask.) There are a lot of TVs with the typical variety of sporting events airing.  The atmosphere is loud. Garage parking under the mall is convenient and around $1 for less than 3 hours. There are better places to eat and drink in Century City, by far.  If it wasn't for work events scheduled here, I wouldn't go again."
Kevin B.,"Bell Gardens, CA",13,5,19,1.0,6/24/2015,"I actually really like BJ's and have eaten there a lot. However this time the food was really bad l, cold and not that great. The food took forever they didn't really ever come back to see how I was... Very dissatisfied."
C L.,"La Jolla, San Diego, CA",0,2,2,1.0,10/16/2015,"The worst place ever!  Went there for lunch, unfortunately had an incompetent server and an incompetent hostess working today. We got sat down at 1:05pm took our order and we ended walking out without eating at 157pm after several attempts of trying to find our server, complaining to the hostess & trying speak to the manager and we got no response from anyone, so we walked out."
A. R.,"West Hollywood, CA",2,11,,1.0,10/29/2013,"I hate to give bad reviews when there is room for improvement. Anyhow, here is my experience and review, because there was not improvement.  On Friday 10/28/13 we took a co-worker to BJ's for her birthday for lunch.  I ordered a flat bread pizza and a salad. The pizza was delicious but the salad was not. Soon after I got really sick. I was thinking to write a review, but instead I decided to email the restaurant directly. Eugene, the manager called me the next day very apologetic and he offered me a gift certificate to give them a second try. Well, his promise didn't come thru. So I decided to use yelp to my surprise this place has many bad reviews so far.   I will never eat there again."
Roya M.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,18,2,1.0,5/13/2015,I came here with 2 of my friends who brought there children. I am pregnant as well and we had to wait 40 mins to get our food which was just salad! Worst service ever!
Adalayne S.,"Los Angeles, CA",52,22,,1.0,4/3/2013,"Whatever you do, don't eat at this particular BJ's.  They were over an hour late with their delivery!! How is that even acceptable?!?!? If you're busy, just let the customer know. COMMUNICATION IS THE KEY.    Not only were they extremely late, but the orders were cold and all wrong. SO SO SO wrong.    Is there a button for Negative Stars???"
I W.,"Los Angeles, CA",391,21,31,1.0,3/1/2015,I arrived 5 employees standing at the front with a 1/2 full restaurant.  Non of them acknowledged us. Although we made an effort to acknowledge them with eye contact and a friendly smile since we both have worked in customer service. After my efforts I then flip roles and end up greeting them.  The 3 host were to busy discussing a viral video with another coworker or friend but nonetheless they were occupied with matters other than their job. I get its Sunday and the general manager isn't present but beyond customer service it became disrespectful. I then assert myself and ask if anyone can help us
Greg S.,"West Hills, CA",14,19,17,5.0,4/20/2015,Good quality. Great service. Fast delivery. Never need to ask for refills. Always 100%
Jean M.,"Studio City, CA",35,42,,4.0,5/20/2013,"The pizza is fine, the service is average, and the prices are nothing to write home about. But PIZZOOOOOKI for life! Seriously, if you're craving something sweet and you've never had this before, get over to BJ's and order one right NOW!  Yes it is that good."
Lisa L.,"Los Angeles, CA",17,25,,3.0,5/16/2015,Weekends are a full house. Sometimes can be a long wait. If you go right before 6:30pm wait is not as bad. I usually prefer eating outside unless it's breezy. My fav is there pizzas! Love their thick crust! So tasty and one pan is more than enough for two people. Service can be slow so be patient. If you're going to see a movie be warned that wait times can be unpredictable.
Cameron S.,"Los Angeles, CA",144,96,5,3.0,3/22/2013,"I've been to BJ's a few times now and it's safe to say that the food is good. I never really like writing reviews for chain restaurants because when it comes down to it, they're all the same, but I've had a good experience thus far at this location for a while now. The interior is nice, just as anything else at the Century City mall, and the outside patio is great also.  I have had five different waiters, and only one of them managed to piss me off. He came to our table, super nice and everything and took our order. We already knew what we wanted so it was nice and easy for him. Then he disappeared. We saw him about 15 minutes later wandering aimlessly and talking to other co-workers while leaned against the bar. Soon another waiter or busser comes with our food, and our original waiter sees him, and instead of coming over and asking if there is anything else he can get us, he waives at the busser and nods his head. Never got checked on, never got water or drinks refilled. We sat there after we ate, and our check never came. Finally a guy walks buy and asks if we needed help, and he just so happened to be the manager (Muahahaha). He closed out our bill and gave us a voucher for a free meal next time.  Then on our way out, the guy who was supposed to be waiting our tables, sees us leaving, and in the middle of taking another table's order, stops us and says ""Hey guys! You made sure to close out your bill right? Can't just leave!"" SERIOUSLY. That happened. Luckily the manager also heard him say that to us and said he'd take care of it. Enough of that banter... My favorite menu items here would have to be the Black and Bleu Burger and the California Cobb Sandwich. Both are awesome, and it's hard for me to decide each time. Once you're done with that, it's always a good idea to top dinner off with a Pizzookie. I'm not one for ordering desserts, but this is something I get every single time."
Tiffany J.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,31,46,5.0,8/27/2015,"Wow I don't know why this place has so many bad reviews. Living local, we go in quite often and I usually order take out from there about once a week. The food is great, the service is always good. Take out Is always fast. I order from home and by the time I get there in 10 min Its always done. The one time they messed up my pizza by adding olives which I requested none, they worked fast to make me a new pizza, constantly asked if Id like a beverage while I waited, and gave me a free pizooki for the inconvenience. Always top notch pizza. After enjoying their deep dish pizza I literally wont eat pizza from anywhere else."
David L.,"Newport Beach, CA",341,87,9,1.0,5/23/2013,"YUCK!  Never been to place and felt more disappointed. This place has several locations in SoCal, mostly in trendy areas. I think I've been to 5 separate locations. Don't know what happen here. Food was cold, salty or simply YUCK.  The waitress completely forgot about us. I think she went home while we were waiting for our food. A different waitress brought us our bill. The pizza, can you say Dominos?? Don't know what else I should say without depressing you (I am depressing myself because I have to relive this experience in my head). Enjoy (can you really do that now?)"
Lucy M.,"Beverly Hills, CA",1,14,2,1.0,5/5/2014,"So, I see a lot of mixed reviews...some good and some crappy.  And I am telling you right now to please, do not waste your hard-earned money and go there.  Their beers are lukewarm and the service is terrible!  I ordered some scallop dish and they were not seared properly and was cold by the time it reached my table.  My husband's pasta with cream sauce came out all lumpy and the sauce was curdled. They do not know what they're doing.  The waitress we had seemed sort of annoyed and not very friendly.  If you're looking to have a good time in Century City, this is not the place!!!"
Leslie A.,"Burbank, CA",17,40,,3.0,2/26/2013,"I've been to BJs multiple times over the years in Burbank and also visited their other locations in Westwood, and now Century City. The nice thing about this chain is it's like that reliable friend that is fun, popular with everybody and you can just totally be yourself. They deliver a decent quality product and service in an upscale but casual atmosphere, with lots of menu choices so there's something for everyone. Fun for groups of friends big and small (birthdays, graduations...) family dinner, or a comfortable and relaxed date out with the hubby. All the calories are posted on the menu for those who are keeping an eye on the ball. I don't feel their dishes are particularly the most healthy...a lot of carbs, sugar in almost all the sauces and marinades, even the fish and steaks, and large portions, so be prudent if you're watching what you eat even on the lighter entree section.. That said, I have to give them props for even offering a gluten-free menu, gluten-free beers, and healthier entree choices from what you do get to choose. Not a lot of chains do that. What's been great is I have always gotten helpful answers to all my questions about menu ingredients, and they are obviously sensitive to those who have allergies, which is cool. If you want nutritional facts, they've got that printed up too. Tonight I got the mahi mahi without the soy sauce and they made sure the spicy sauce  they did include on the plate had no sugar. When the waiter came out he double checked the plate eyeing it closely to make sure they didn't accidentally put the wrong thing in. I asked if I could get steamed vegetables instead of the fried rice with stir fry. They ended up giving me the stir fry veggies minus the rice (red pepper, a small sprig here and there of cabbage, shredded carrots, pineapple and onions) which were not as healthy as some real greens like broccoli or steamed green beans, but I have to admit they were pretty tasty and went well with the fish.  With the exception of what I ordered, I feel like the prices tend to run a little high for what you get, but it's kind of one of those things were you pay a little more but know it's going to never let you down. No high highs, but no low lows either. The mahi was a lot better deal than the other entrees usually end up costing, so I was happy for once to do a large group birthday for $20 instead of twice the price and still eat healthy. As some of the other reviews have mentioned one of the unique offerings at BJs is their pizookie, which you can actually get free with dinner if you by a Masterdog card through my local high school (it supports many of the elective programs that require fund-raising.) I do appreciate the Burbank location's ongoing support of my alma mater. Tonight the Century City location (located inside the Westfield Mall)  was great in answering my questions, okay in terms of handling a big party. Everybody's food came out at slightly different intervals and since other servers were helping, they didn't know where anything went. It was like being at an auction. BBQ Wings? Caesar Salad anyone? I also would have appreciated it if they could have come out and refilled my water. I was out for half the evening, but I was having too much fun talking with the other girls to hail down a waiter. They didn't ask me if everything was okay or we needed anything (until dessert), but I did see the waiter check up on some other orders. I'm sure I will be back, but it will likely be for convenience or when I am invited by friends. Now I have a low-cal and low-cost stand-by to order when I do."
