Marlon M.,"Los Angeles, CA",10,64,7,1.0,7/1/2013,"Mediocre food with the shittiest service. Came here with 2 other friends and we were seated immediately. HERE COMES THE DREADFUL PART!! Were waiting............. 5 minutes later..... still waiting for our server....5 min later still waiting hoping someone would come and at least offer a glass of water..........5 more minutes later, tables around us get seated........ and after 20 min of waiting and watching the tables around us get their order taken by lazy uninterested staff, my friends and i decided to stop the next Bjs employee and ask him to take our order. 25 minutes to get served on a slow night, another 25 minutes to receive our mediocre nachos,,,,, NO THANK YOU Bjs. SAVE YOUR MONEY PEOPLE, you'll have faster service and better tasting food at the food court."
Anthony K.,"Los Angeles, CA",161,53,,4.0,2/28/2014,"I enjoyed my experience here. I went on a Friday afternoon with a good amount of customers, but me and my 7 cohorts were seated almost immediately (within a few minutes, without reserving a table), our server was very friendly (always refilling our drinks when they were getting low), and the food was good. Not fantastic, not out-of-this-world, but comforting, tasty food. The half-rack of ribs were great, but a bit on the boney side. I've had better ribs, but I haven't had a good rack of them in years, and it was nice to be reminded of how good they are. The cheddar mashed potatoes were good, complimented the ribs well - but I couldn't really taste any conceivable difference between them and regular mashed potatoes. The clam chowder in a bread bowl, however, was HEAVENLY. Seriously, the bread was perfectly crisp, the soup was fresh, and it was perfect. Maybe it's just because I love bread, and I love eating things that shouldn't be eaten, but I just enjoyed the ever-loving crap out of that part of the meal. All of this, for about $20, was a pretty good deal in my opinion. It was fun, tasty, and I'm still full several hours later (and this was all I ate all day!) Overall, pretty great place to try, although I guess some people have issues with customer service and such, especially on weekends. But for good bar food and a nice environment, this is the place to go."
Michelle O.,"Los Angeles, CA",100,496,56,3.0,12/16/2014,"BJs is always a good restaurant to have in your back pocket.  You can count on their food and beer selection is always great.  And of course, who would turn down a pizzookie!?!?  But i am giving them 3 stars because their service is not so good.  They did help us quickly when another waiter accidentally took one of our food items, which was great, but we had to ask multiple times for condiments and they never noticed that our water glasses needed refreshing."
Jasmine W.,"Redlands, CA",31,73,34,2.0,7/16/2014,Let me start by saying the food at this BJ's was standard. It is what you expect from the chain. The servers were terrible.  The hostess seemed to be bored and the servers were uninterested. I was surprised that our server could be so rude. She had a plastered fake smile and did the bare minimum. I'm not even sure of she wanted us there.
Pedro S.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,32,69,4.0,12/27/2013,"Really not bad for happy hour!  Plenty of options like angus beef slidders, deep dish pizza, and avocado egg roles.  Brew house beer is just $4.   Not bad!!!!"
Jayce S.,"Los Angeles, CA",872,10,1,1.0,1/24/2016,"Good Lord what a terrible experience. A friend was in town and we wanted to try one of BJs world famous pizookies. When we were seated, it was obvious our server was already irritated. We wrote it off and assumed he may have been having a bad night and continued on. We decided to order an amazing deep dish pizza to stare. Yum! When the pizza was dropped we didn't have any utensils. Hmph. He delivered and apologized so we were fine. A little later, our server asked us if we were ready for dessert as we had mentioned before, but given we still had over 1/2 a pizza sitting in front of us, we told him we would wait. 30 minutes, lingering dirty dishes, empty glasses, and a assist from a fellow server later he came back to take our dessert order. He returned less than two minutes later with the check, silently dropped it, and walked off. Wait... we hadn't even gotten our food yet! What if we wanted coffee with our dessert? At this point we were all completely irritated as well. Being a server I understand if you're cut and want to go home. Maybe the host sat a closed section? Who knows. Regardless if you need us to pay ask us or transfer the check to another server. Communicate please. The restaurant was STILL open! So when he came back to get the check I told him we would pay when we were done with our meal. That definitely pissed him off and he stormed off. Call it petty, but he was being extremely rude from the get go and we wanted to enjoy our meal, especially with our visiter. Again, the restaurant was STILL open. He finally transferred the check to another server. I ended up just taking the check to the host stand to pay and leaving. Yes, that sucked."
Chris Z.,"Avondale Estates, GA",70,1334,858,3.0,2/11/2013,"If you're in the area, there really are not that many places that market themselves as a sports bar.  But BJ's has plenty of TV's and has access to all the games you are looking for.   Our server was good, attentive... a little overly corporate (with canned recommendations) for my liking.   I had a salad.  It was large and yummy... maybe a bit heavy on dressing."
Janice C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,18,,5.0,4/10/2015,"My husband and I had a terrific dinner last evening, because of an outstanding server. Her name is Sara Smith.  What Sara brought to our dining experience was true enthusiasm and concern for our enjoyment of our meal at BJ's!  Sara has a winning personality, a professional work ethic, and the love of giving the highest level of customer service! Thanks SO much Sara Smith!"
Akeem N.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,5.0,4/10/2015,This review is only for the service I experienced for my first experience at this establishment. The food was adequate but I was mostly just killing time until work. My server however was completely charming and I can't say enough about her. I've been in LA for less than a month and angel said she could see that. I discussed a desire to lose my southern accent so as to not come off as a hillbilly to others. She encouraged me to keep it bc it's more charming to be myself in such an area. She was completely adorable both in appearance and in attitude and it was incredibly comforting that she was so kind and not overbearing or fake. I actually only joined yelp as I'm sitting in my booth so I could rave about the sweet and genuine demeanor she allowed me to experience.  On second thought the mahi tacos (angel suggested) were pretty damn good.  Like really good actually.
Yu W.,"Los Angeles, CA",136,55,4,4.0,3/10/2013,Great place for a bazaar beer during game season. I'll come back when another soccer game is on.  The Thai salmon is pretty good.
Denis S.,"Marina del Rey, CA",704,1938,21,2.0,8/18/2011,"I hadn't had BJs in a while and completely forgot one thing. Places like this (including Fridays, Chili's, Applebees, etc...) give you a LOT of food, no matter what you order. Their appetizers are pretty good, but always deadly. You feel like you ate a normal amount, and then several hours later its still all sitting in your stomach. Not a good feeling.  I got their thin crust pizza (which I think is fairly new since they're known for deep dish), which tasted pretty good, but like I said, really stays with you."
Edward G.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,10,2,5.0,10/8/2014,walking around the mall and looking for a good place to grab a bite and a brew this is the place. the bar tender Mike was excellent and the service was quick. they have a tv wall to watch sports and enjoy the game plus the food was excellent. I ordered the BBQ lunch platter and was not disapointed.
Jack M.,"Santa Barbara, CA",63,15,1,3.0,8/14/2012,"When did BJ's turn into such a corporation? It's the new CPK. Even though I don't really like where they're going, with the whole corporate, business vibe (it might just be this location) I'll still come back here for the signature pizookie."
Tom H.,"Torrance, CA",51,399,8,3.0,1/18/2013,"One of the smaller BJ's in the area, so during peak times the wait will probably be longer.  I ended up trying the Cajun pasta and the pasta was completely missing any kind of sauce, making it very dry and bland.  Great service though."
Sergio D.,"Beverly Hills, CA",143,45,16,3.0,12/26/2012,Hit or Miss On their Service.  + Great scene with a fireplace and patio and tons of TVs. - Terrible Service some servers just don't pay attention when you ask them to fucking pay attention.  + Classier setting then the BJ's by UCLA. Not my go to service spot after a long for sure.
Marjorie U.,"West Los Angeles, CA",245,476,12992,4.0,7/22/2011,"Finally! A late nite hangout after watching a late nite movie in Century City! They're open till 12AM and they have happy hour specials for apps and beer.  This place is not as busy as the one in Westwood because it just opened so take advantage of it. I normally just order Cobb salad, clam chowder, pizza and beer but last night I tried their pork ribs it's ok not really good. I'm going to try their Tuscan Tomato Bisque and Flatbread pizza next time. Oh, I do love their fried artichokes! Not because they consider this an Aphrodisiac. It just taste good."
Brittany S.,"Los Angeles, CA",42,131,1,4.0,7/8/2011,"BJ's has one of the best desserts ever - Pazookie!! Who doesn't like a warm half baked cookie straight out of the oven with melting ice-cream on top??!?! There are plenty of options to choose from, choco chip, peanut butter, oatmeal raisin, oreo cookie, double choco chip and red velvet - could it get any better!! The new location is great! It is not only closer to where I live but has much easier parking then the Westwood location.  But that also makes it more dangerous since I know can easily get a Pazookie whenever I want!! The service at the new location is great as well; the staff is super friendly and very attentive. I still need to try something off the menu besides a Pazookie but from what I have heard from friends the food is good, kind of like a cheesecake factory feel, but nothing spectacular - I will need to go for dinner and try it for myself! And if is nothing amazing I will still be returning to BJ's for dessert all the time!!"
Ronin E.,"Los Angeles, CA",77,317,156,2.0,7/5/2011,"I work in the area and we decided, for a change of pace, to leave our 'place of business' to grab a lunch ""out.""  What was supposed to be a quick lunch ended up being about a two hour process. First of all, I remember the restaurant that was here before; very dark, a bit over-priced but still pretty good, but you wouldn't go there on lunch, it was ""romantic""/depressing.  This is a welcome addition to the limited selection of sit-down restaurants at the mall, very nice, open, airy.  We were promptly seated and the waitress was right there out of the gate, which is good.  The six of us ordered various things off of the lunch menu.  I just got the soup and salad, which was shockingly good (the Caesar salad and the tomato soup).  My coworkers got a variety of things, but super simple; grilled ham and cheese with soup, salmon, ahi salad, mini pizza.   Now... the waiting.  I got my salad pretty quickly but everyone else's stuff took exceedingly long... I mean, a looooong time, I'm talking 45 minutes long.  Honestly, with my stomach stuffed with salad, I wasn't complaining too much but we had to get back to work.  We asked the waitress a couple times but eventually the food came out, they said the salmon was the hold-up.  I'm not sure what the difference of salmon is vs., say, ahi, but whatever.  45 minutes is way too long. Everyone said their food was good.  I've been to BJ's before (not this location) and I thought the pizza was awful, especially as someone whose family is from Chicago, they used to say it was ""Chicago"" pizza... um, not even close.  It's just like Pizza Hut pan pizza, not ""Chicago"" pizza (big difference).  However, this time, the food was good - when I got away from the pizza.  Someone in our group got the pizza and it looked the same... blah. Anyway, this place is a welcomed addition to the line-up at the mall, instead of the overpriced Rock Sugar or the steakhouse.  They just really need to work on the service, since a number of other tables were waiting too."
Doug B.,"Anderson, IN",668,211,209,3.0,7/3/2013,"The bartender was friendly.  The pizza was good, but not quite warm to my standards.  They should also always use a warm plate for pizzas, especially for thin crust pizzas.  If the plate is cold it makes the dish seem less savory.  They have a nice selection of beers and are open until midnight most nights (double check before you go), so they aren't the best place in town for late nights."
Adam M.,"Los Angeles, CA",30,117,1,3.0,11/16/2012,"After not eating at a bjs in lord knows how long it was worth a shot for a casual meal. I couldn't give a chain like this more than three stars because nothing here wows me but I am happy that the menu delivers more value than I noticed before. The downside to this location is parking,  Details : Friday night dinner for two, seated quickly within a few minutes, good service, ordered soup, jambalaya, and a tomato-mozz appetizer and baked potato. baked potato can be missed."
