Julia W.,"Los Angeles, CA",125,94,3,3.0,11/16/2012,"I don't remember BJ's having good food, but I guess they do! My friend and I got the Original Roast Beef Dip Sandwich and the Old Fashioned Pot Roast. I recommend them both.  Service-wise, things seemed a bit off. When we got there, it appeared surprisingly crowded. There was about a 10min wait, which isn't bad, but when we got seated, I saw at least 4 other empty tables. Also, the waitress got one of our orders wrong and at the end of the meal took our plates away without asking if we were finished (which we weren't!). Not a huge deal I guess, but worth mentioning."
Christian C.,"Chicago, IL",1714,103,11,1.0,7/18/2012,"UPDATE: Still NEVER heard back from anyone (no Managers or corporate people, either). What a dump! Can't believe I went there. I ate at this BJs at least once/twice a week for a few months. We have a lot of our of town corporate visitors & this 'restaurant' is across the street from our workplace. The staff is uneven (some are good & some are not). It's the management that really disappointed me.  I had a lunch with a client & things were going fairly well. The food is nothing spectacular (it always takes the same time for a salad as it does for a steak). The food was ok not great as usual. The placed had cleared out after lunch died down.   My client went to the restroom & I followed him a few minutes later to wash my hands since the drinks & food had left residue all over the table. I had tried to flag the waiter but after 5 minutes I just placed my credit card with the slip & I left my sunglasses & pen next to them to make sure the staff didn't bus the table. I finished washing  my hands & when I got back to the table it had been bused & my client had been told I had left (I got a text they were on their way to the car thinking I'd left). I was completely embarrassed.  When I tracked down my waiter instead of talking to me or getting me my glasses & pen, he ran my credit card and handed me the bill. The manager (Roberto) was rude & cut me off. He was obviously not fit for this position. The part that floored me was that the GM (Jay Clark) didn't care either. After I took time out to come back & explain what had happened to Jay, he finally said 'I don't know.' but when I asked him why I this happened or what would make me want to come back, he said, ""I don't know why you'd come back. What's the question?"". I think that sums it up. As hard as it seems, sometimes you get all the information you need.  I left a message for Bob Salesi (branch manager) but never heard from him, either.  It's hard to make people happy everytime but it's very easy to express how important your customers are to your business. Hell, even the back of Roberto's & Jay's business card says 'Bj's takes pride in passionately connecting with every guest...'  Maybe it's time to read your own business card or maybe Jay is right and there's no reason to come back here...  We no longer bring our work lunches here & I would never come back. I honestly have no reason to.  Thanks Bjs."
Dominick P.,"South East LA, Los Angeles, CA",1,8,18,5.0,1/22/2015,Exceptional service made this the best BJ's I've been to. The staff was super friendly and accommodating. Our party of four all enjoyed our meals and we enjoyed our time here.
Jessica C.,"Los Angeles, CA",450,205,22,4.0,6/8/2011,"We went there yesterday which I guess was day 2 of their official opening.  The place was super crowded but we managed to get a table.  I agree with the other reviewer, they are completely over staffed. I started counting, there were 9 different people who came over to check on us and although I appreciate the attentiveness, it started to get annoying to have so many people ask us if they could take our drink order and/or order an appetizer while we look at the menu.  At one point, one server came over to tell us that she was going to go get our entrees and bring them out to us.  We really didn't need the play-by-play but again appreciate that they are new and are trying to work out the kinks in the restaurant. The food was great, the decor was also nice, their outside seating area looks pretty cool and they do have a bunch of special offers coming.  One that I liked is that they have a ""late happy hour"" which is 10pm til ??? so I'm sure I will hit that after the movies in the future.   About three people on the host staff also said goodbye to us as we were leaving...nice touch."
James L.,"Sydney, Australia",6,8,5,1.0,2/15/2015,Recommended by hotel concierge to try this place at 1035pm as they open til midnight. Arrived with one person in front. Waited for 13 minutes. Not one available staff. There was around 20 people in 5-6 tables. About 1/3 full. Yet not one staff available. Left hungry.
Becky A.,"Chandler, AZ",66,172,63,2.0,6/21/2012,"I've been to B.J.'s in Arizona a few times and although it's nothing great, it's decent....for a chain restaurant.  Anyway, I was disappointed with my visit to the Century City B.J.'s.  First of all, the service was sooooooo slow!  Got seated immediately but everything after that, was beyond slow.  Slow to take our order.  Took forever to get our food and then forever to get our check and then forever for him to pick up the credit card and process the check.  Ugh! Food....well, I don't know about everyone else that I was with, but I lunch special of the grilled Mahi tacos was very disappointing.  I have never had such a small amount of fish in fish taco's before.  There wasn't even much cabbage.  It was mostly tortilla.  The taste was decent but just not enough.  For how long it took to get our check and everything after we finished eating, I was hungry again before leaving the restaurant. Not good B.J.'s."
BF S.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,119,43,2.0,8/23/2015,"never been a fan but my friend likes it so I go along with it. dressing was watery, didn't taste like much. waiter was decent enough."
Alma M.,"South Pasadena, CA",179,122,437,4.0,8/5/2011,"This location is the best location I've been to! I live close to the Glendale location but their service is just horrible. The noise level is a bit high here, but its just the noise of satisfied customers and people having a great time! I cant explain how many times I've driven all the way out here when I would've gone for a 4 minutes drive to Glendale instead.  The service is so much better and the hours are so much more convenient for busy people like myself! I wouldn't mind bringing the rest of my friends all the way out here for a great time!"
Daryl C.,"Covina, CA",85,44,4,2.0,9/12/2013,"I'm a fan of BJs happy hour. $4.00 craft brews and flatbread... That's an instant 4 stars for me!!! ... Unfortunately every time I go, unless I sit at the bar, I will receive very slow and non-attentive service. I feel feel bad saying so being part of the service industry myself, and I ALWAYS give servers the benefit of doubt. However, when it starts happening on a consistent basis I start to answer the questions that have unwillingly risen. If one server can't handle a happy hour, then add another, or else it will start to reflect in guest response which is clearly what's happening here."
Sandra I.,"Los Angeles, CA",128,86,127,4.0,5/9/2014,"Good location and poppin happy hour.  Sat at the bartop at 6:58 and they still served us happy hour.  Got the strawberry mojito, it was really sweet made with the purée they make their strawberry lemonades with.  Only downer is we never got silverware and by the time the happy hour food came we ate the flatbread and boneless wings without them."
Jon S.,"McLean, VA",10,184,185,2.0,12/22/2013,Staff inconsistent with service. Ordered a side of fries with my salad and a small plate was almost 4 dollars. The avocado egg rolls were good. The overall felling is unclean.  The only reason I go - I work two blocks away.  Come on and deliver.
Michael M.,"Santa Monica, CA",760,216,,5.0,6/7/2014,"Excellent food and service. Plus, you're right at the mall. The Century City mall is an open door mall, for those who have never been there. The menu has a variety to choose from. I always try something different every time I eat here. They have many locations throughout  the Los Angeles area. The restaurant is clean and the servers/staff are courteous and attentive to the customers needs. Also immaculate as as cleanliness goes. I would recommend eating here,and then taking a stroll along the mall. Just thinking og BJ'S makes me hungry. 5 stars for wonderful  food and service."
Sherry J.,"UC Campus Area, Berkeley, CA",316,70,40,3.0,2/24/2013,"There's literally nothing too special about BJ's, except that it's convenient (you could walk in not knowing what you want to eat, but still ordering something that's relatively decent), is great for large parties of people and has a pretty cool vibe and atmosphere. I've been to BJ's a couple of times, and none of the dishes I order are particularly memorable. The pizza is probably the best item on the menu. They give you pizza that is very doughy - if you are a fan of pizza crust with just a little bit of topping, then you would be a fan. Personally, for me, I like pizza with a bit more topping, and just have the crust be something that just holds all the ingredients together. I had the BBQ chicken pizza - it was actually pretty good. The BBQ chicken was actually made pretty tender and good - I just wished there were more of it. Also, another redeeming quality of BJ's is the pizookie. If you haven't had a pizookie before, you should go to BJ's then. Although you could probably make this at home, it's just nicer when it's delivered to you on a warm, gooey platter. A pizookie is a large cookie baked on a pizza pan, with a couple of scoops of ice cream on top. I tried both the chocolate chip and the red velvet cookie. The red velvet is pretty bomb - so vanilly and delicious."
Henny J.,"Los Angeles, CA",53,17,1,1.0,7/4/2013,"This is the poorest excuse for a restaurant in Century City. The reason for the 1 star were as follows 1) Dirty- the first thing I noticed was the servers uniforms (filthy) 2) After we were seated, we were forgotten 3) Food came out cold and raw (fish tacos) 4) Greasy and bland (chicken fried steak) I still can't believe I'm in Century City."
Prashant C.,"San Francisco, CA",108,59,15,2.0,5/28/2013,"Don't come for the movie ticket deal because they never have movie tickets.  What a gimmick to get you in the door and order.  The deal is supposed have have two salads, two amc movie tickets, one medium pizza, and a pizookie.  BJs fails.  I used to be one of BJs biggest supporters but this is probably the last time ill be here.  We did also ask if we could come get the movie tickets another time by just showing the receipt and they said no!! Bad customer service paired with mediocre food. See ya! They get 2 stars still (rating not based on poor service), but purely on the food.  The deep dish pizza is a hit or a miss, sometimes I feel like I'm in a shitty Chicago pizza joint, other days I feel like they had some homeless guy in the back alley bake their pizza in a cardboard box.    If you have to eat here, just get a pizookie and bounce!  If I had to rate BJ's based on customer service and food, they'll get an reluctant 1 star (should be zero stars).  Westfield needs to kick them out of the mall ASAP!"
Twila G.,"San Francisco, CA",115,74,9,4.0,10/8/2012,"Yes it's a chain but I like this place a lot for the following reasons: -$3.50 lunch beers -Half off Wines on Tuesdays (all day!) -BBQ Chicken Salad is hearty and full of a variety of veggies/cheese (and topped with those delicious onion crispys) -Pizzas are deep dish and come in a variety -Flatbreads are light but filling -Pazzoki (if you've never had it its something you must try at least once in your life) Free parking for 3 hours in the westfield mall makes this a great spot to do lunch, happy hour, or dinner"
Katie K.,"Los Angeles, CA",892,411,31,5.0,6/7/2014,"Honestly I wanted to go to pink taco at the mall, but I let my husband decide! What a good choice that was! Great service, food and atmosphere!! I recommend the buffalo wings along with the buffalo chicken pizza, corn fritters, and chicken sandwich with seasoned steak fries! Frank is a great waiter, definitely was attentive to my husband and I! We will be back for some more greatness!"
Marianne V.,"Long Beach, CA",331,104,195,5.0,3/21/2015,"Writing this review for the only server who helped us with no attitude whatsoever even though they were really busy and he stayed on top of everything and kept checking on us to make sure we are doing okay! His name is Alex R. we called him mini 3lau because he kinda looks like him haha anyway, we went for my friends birthday group of 25 people, we got there, Alex gave us water and he took our order for drinks and appetizer, left and a few mins our order came in pretty quick, he came back and took our order for our main course, a few mins and bam dinner was served, I ordered the cherry glazed salmon, I loved it! For drinks we got bj's mojito a little too sweet for me, fresca, and drink like that, lol I think that's what you call it. Overall food is always good at bj's! The service was pretty awesome! It was unexpected, because most of the time with a big group of people and a busy place equals bad service. The only downside I had with this one was they were only able to split the check in two and that was a hassle for the server and the customers. Made it work anyway, I had to pay additional on top of my order because the money from everyone was short, and I know for a fact if no one pays for it the server gets in trouble for it so I just decided to take care of it, just a pay back to the awesome service we had from Alex!"
Jay W.,"Culver City, CA",24,39,1,2.0,6/8/2013,"Went here with a date after a movie.  I have to admit my expectations weren't that high to begin with.  But we were both hungry and decided to give it a try. Wait wasn't bad for a Friday night.  Our waiter came by relatively quickly and took our full order.  The drinks we ordered took a while to get to us and with a ""sorry, the bar's backed up"".  So, bad staffing decisions for a Friday night in Spring/Summer.  My date decided to try something unusual: A orange cream soda mixed drink.  She hated it, I tried some and agreed it was god awful.  So we both agreed it should go back and she ordered something safer. The food came out in a normal amount of time (Good job kitchen for a Friday night!).  She had a Salmon & Scallop plate which she liked.  I had a ""Sweet Pig"" deep dish pizza.  Now I take full responsibility for misreading the menu.  I thought it was kind of a Shredded Pork pizza... Not a Canadian Bacon one.  But hey that's my fault.  However the pizza was pretty god awful (Boo kitchen!).  It was bland, tasteless not even a hint of freshness and the only thing that made it ""Deep Dish"" was that it was overly puffed up.  I've had fast food pizza's taste better... One other note.  When I ordered it I got the usual ""That's a very good choice"" from the waiter.  Which always irk's me because I know it's BS (This case in point).  Unless I'm ordering a specialty or something that's known for being amazing there... Don't bother with it.  One thing I really appreciated was a Chinese Restaurant that told me on an appetizer I ordered ""No, you won't like that.  I give you something much better"" and damn they were right. So we eat and when the bill comes is the big test... Sure enough the awful drink we sent back is sitting on the bill.  They correct the mistake with a ""sorry, we're just really busy tonight"" (Meh, not really) and that's when my date suddenly realizes they never put the vegetables on her plate... They forgot completely and no one noticed. So to sum up, low expectations confirmed and won't be trying them again.  There's far too many delicious places in LA to eat to waste the calories and money on bland options."
Svetlana K.,"Beaverton, OR",52,38,,1.0,9/1/2014,"It is sad that a business can get so complacent because they know they are located in the middle of a business/corporate area and will have clients no matter what kind of service they provide and no matter what kind of food they serve. I work in Century City, and each time we would come here for lunch or a happy hour with my company, it is a dissapointment for me. The service is always average or below average. They know they would get good tips no matter what since it is corporations/firms that often pay for this outtings.Sad.  Last week we went there for lunch and I got a new Kale and Roasted Brussels Sprouts Salad. If you read this salad description in the menu, there are 11 ingredients. My salad had overwhelmingly greens and brussels sprouts, I could hadly locate blueberries and cranberries and was able to see only a few tiny pieces of walnuts. I consider this a shame to pay $9.75 for a plate full of greens."
