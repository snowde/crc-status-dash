Jennifer B.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,124,21,2.0,7/9/2013,The food is what it is. It's open late and there is a decent selection. Plus the dessert is awesome. The staff is terrible here. They try to be nice but forget about your table. I would go here as a last resort.
Lygris H.,"Mid-City, Los Angeles, CA",2,28,51,2.0,7/1/2013,"First time here. Had high expectations, but our waiter, David, was less than awesome.  We wanted to get a Spicy Meatball medium pizza and calamari to start. He talks us down to a small, saying that with the calamari, the small should be enough. He didn't know jack about the beer, he brought me a dirty, wet plate, and we had to ask for napkins and utensils.   The food itself was like something I would cook up on a good day (and I'm a lousy cook).  All in all, I didn't have a horrible experience, the service and the food was not worth the price we paid!"
Sammy P.,"Los Angeles, CA",21,19,15,1.0,10/27/2012,"Wow, I think it's the location and the fact that it was a late nite dining experience, but everything was less than mediocre. I ordered a soup and salad combo. How hard is that to mess up? The salad and soup were brought out together and the salad was partially frozen...lettuce, cucumber slices and carrots. Lukewarm would be a generous description for the soup. I didn't complain about the salad but I asked the server to reheat the soup. He must have forgotten because I had to remind him about 25 minutes later. The chili wasn't worth the time I had to wait to eat it. My friend's food took about 35 minutes and it was just a burger and fries. The place wasn't even busy. There was about 15 people total dining! Eh, I probably won't be back to this one."
Geva J.,"Los Angeles, CA",53,69,79,2.0,9/5/2014,"Went here for my son's 13th birthday along with my husband and 2 daughter's.   We jad never been to BJ'S before,  but was excited about going.  I liked the fact that there is a ""Big Kids"" menu since my kids don't eat a lot.  We waited for everything,  the ketchup,  the A1 sauce,  refills on my water, etc....  There were supposed to be 2 sides with the kids entrée,  the the waiter forgot to bring the second side for all 3 of the kids.  My husband and i got the steak, which was just ""okay"".  They did give my sone a mini cookie palooza (not sure of the spelling) for his birthday,  but no one sang happy birthday.   The comment from the waiter was that this isn't Applebee's or Red Lobster.   We won't be going back."
Ed W.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,10,57,3.0,12/21/2015,Casual dinner while shopping at century city.  Service was very good even though it was crowded.  We ordered our usual BJs favorite combo pizza and added pineapples.  Baked well done so we get s crispy crust.  Root beer was not carbonated so changed to cream soda.
Matt S.,"Salt Lake City, UT",1,12,14,2.0,11/12/2014,"Poor slow service, and mediocre food. They get an extra star for having a reasonable beer selection."
Brad M.,"Santa Monica, CA",4,271,20,1.0,9/9/2014,"The most poorly managed BJ's in the United States. We gave it two tries thinking it must have been a fluke that the service was so bad the first time. Nope! Can't get a waiter to take your drink order. It takes 15 minutes for drinks to arrive and once your food gets there you never - I mean never see a waiter again. Oh, and good luck getting the check. Note: they were not busy either time that we came here. It is just that the restaurant is that poorly managed. I just can't believe that a chain would let this go on. Judging by the Yelp reviews it seems that  everyone else has had the same bad experience. Unless you have several hours to kill waiting for your food, are satisfied with only being able to get one beer the entire evening and like finishing your dining experience angrier than a bad day at the DMV, I don't recommend the place."
Ayasha J.,"Havelock, NC",34,50,12,4.0,8/29/2012,"This place gets 4 stars thanks to our AWESOME waiter, Kyle. We found out about the $19.95 deal for a pizza, salad, soup & dessert so we decided to try it out. The hostess was snobby and I was not fond of her, but that's what you get for eating out in Hollywood. The Cesar salad and broccoli Cheddar soup was very tasty! We ordered a ""build your own"" pizza which was pretty filling since the crust was so thick. For dessert we had the classic chocolate chip pizookie which was TO DIE FOR. If anything, I would come back here again just to indulge in that. It was SO soft and just amazing. Our waiter was very attentive and friendly! He helped us decide which pizza to get, and when we decided to add the 2 movie tickets to our order, he even made some movie suggestions! The other waiters/waitresses all seemed to be snobby and had that ""I'm better than you"" attitude that you will never fail to find in Hollywood, but Kyle was great!!  Our check was wrong when he brought it to us, and he promptly fixed it with no complaints! Prices are VERY steep here and I wouldn't come here without some kind of deal... We ended up paying about $80 for the 2 movie tickets ($15 for 2), the dinner deal, and 2 drinks from the bar. Maybe that makes me sound cheap, but I don't think that dinner should cost more than a normal grocery shopping trip :( Anyway, I would recommend it if you're willing to spend the money for it. The food was good, and if you get Kyle, the service is great!  Don't leave without trying the chocolate chip pizookie! Oh yea, and you have to deal with Mall parking for this place, but if you're planning dinner & a movie it's not too bad."
Mallory G.,"Rohnert Park, CA",23,11,,4.0,11/2/2013,"One of the best steak salads I've ever had.  The steak is too overdone for my taste, and it would be better if the egg was sliced thinner or chopped up, the vegetables cannot be beat."
Dave H.,"Chicago, IL",0,57,1,4.0,11/2/2015,"Giving it 4 stars for what it is - a sports bar.  Lots of TV's, huge selection of beers on tap and, from my experience, pretty good service.  Have been here a couple times while staying nearby on business.  The food was good. Our group has had a variety of things, from wings, to pizza, to burgers, to fish - it's all good quality. Would recommend for a casual night out to watch a game with friends or colleagues."
Shannon H.,"Los Angeles, CA",332,312,161,1.0,4/4/2012,"UPDATE: This place sucks!!!! I thought it would be a great BJ's to enjoy lunch here at the century city mall. I've been to this location at least 3 or 4x's for lunch but today's experience topped them all. The atmosphere when you walk in is cool and the greater are nice. But I decided to eat lunch at the bar today... Biggest mistake I've made. The bartender is so sloooooowww! This lady was horrible! I asked for a glass of water and literally watched this bartender grab a glass, notice it was dirty and tried to scratch the visible dirt off of my glass with her fingernails. Disgusting!!! Ordered a cajun chicken pasta with no tomatoes & onions for my fiancé because she's allergic and I ordered a turkey club with no tomatoes. Food came out and my fiancé food looked fine. I ordered a turkey club but was brought out a 1/2 turkey cobb sandwich. Had to wave and flag the bartender down for ten minutes before she corrected my order. By the time my turkey club came out my fiancé finished her pasta to notice at the bottom there were chunks of onions and tomatoes!! She's allergic!!  After running to the bathroom to like I tried to flag the bartender down for ten minutes again and showed her the plate with tomatoes and onions. She apologized and said ""I told them no onions and tomatoes! That sucks!"" then grabbed my credit card and paid. Before signing the receipt I asked why is she still charging me for the pasta even though you guys' mistake could've killed my fiancé? She replied by saying ""I figured you guys were in a rush because you're on lunch."" I requested a manager and he never came out to speak with us. Minutes later some guy approached us claiming he was the manager with a modified receipt that removed the pasta and said he took care of it. Never apologized nor greeted himself. Overall, I'll never ever visit this location again because of their unfriendly staff, dirty dishes and lack of sympathy and responsibility for their actions. I use to love this place because it was convenient for lunch since we work in the Westfield building. This experience ruined it all."
G C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,79,6,5.0,4/19/2013,"Wow, this place is good~ Their food is really good. The tilapia was really delicious but, I wish they served a bit more! Their service was great!"
Tam N.,"Rochester, NY",340,183,499,2.0,7/30/2012,"So I really only go here to wait for a movie or some kinda late hh after a movie. The service is kinda meh with the hostesses and the wait stuff considering they have so many. It takes forever to flag down someone for a menu or to get the check.  The food is never consistent. We had some bruschetta  small bites and stuff mushrooms that we had before and the taste was very different. The menu though is huge and has grown over time from just pizza and beer to like a marie callenders type of deal. IMO big menus just end up lowering the quality of the food and the time to serve ppl seen in our wait for our food.  Go here if you dont really have anywhere else to go.  There ""happy hour"" beer price is $1 off beers...which is basically the $1 dollar you would normally tip a bartender...ya you can find better"
Patrick B.,"Los Angeles, CA",161,398,4,2.0,4/11/2012,"Overall... didn't love it.  The decor looks good... feels like a large upscale bar.  The food and beer choices were vast.  However, in a nut shell it is a sports bar - with bar food.  Very loud atmosphere, average service and OK food.  If you are drinking a lot - you won't notice. If you are sober, you'll be disappointed."
Stc T.,"Fort Worth, TX",1,51,6,3.0,11/9/2015,"My waiter was perfect, the food was good. I enjoyed the avocado egg rolls and Bj's Royal Soda was yummy."
Riana C.,"San Francisco, CA",243,196,14,4.0,8/29/2012,"To the manager of this specific BJ's location: THANK YOU. This review isn't for the food here at BJ's. It's a chain. The food is good. The menu has a wide selection. If you want my opinion: Great White pizza is where it's at. Now, the reason I'm writing this review is because I've had bad experiences at multiple BJ's in different zip codes and states. (Not in terms of their food. Again, it's a chain, and I've never had a problem with how delicious my meal has been.) However, this location, time after time, no matter how busy or slow the restaurant is, never seems to disappoint. I've come to this location when every table was full and there was a long wait. I've also come to this location when it's reaaaally late and almost empty on a weeknight. On all instances, I've had great service. Waters refilled when they dip below half-way, different servers coming out to deliver food and check if everything is ok, incorrect food being brought out and then the correct order coming out in lightning speed with an apologetic smile, and just about everything in between. The BJ's in Westwood has literally scarred my love for BJ's with awful service and management. If you're on the Westside and looking to grab some BJ's (gigglegigglegiggle) make it out to this location and save yourself the headache."
Sonya Z.,"New Orleans, LA",388,877,10,1.0,11/6/2012,Service at this location is pretty dang slow.  Happy hour goes late on Sundays - big plus.
Shelby D.,"Los Angeles, CA",132,13,2,2.0,9/20/2014,"The food was gross :( waitress Kayla was sweet but I ordered a salad, carnita fries, wings , and fried artichoke hearts. You would think at a bar the fried food can be decent. Wrong! The only thing i liked was the salad :/ very disappointed"
Chris J.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,9,,3.0,3/2/2015,"I really wanted to put less stars than this but only one person made me put 3 stars and that is Charles. In the beginning of our dinner everything seemed ok we had a waiter that seemed enthusiastic. Time kept passing and we never had our appetizer come out and we kept looking for this waiter and he was no where to be found. Finally, another guy brought our actual entrees out and we looked at the guy a little confused and he looked at us a little rudely until we explained that our appetizer never came out, he said he was going to check on that but he also never came out. We REALLY wanted those nachos so we talked to a lady waitress and she also said she'll check on that and never came back out. at that point, our dinner was ruined, not because we were craving nachos but because we had already told 3 people we wanted those nachos and nobody at no point came out to apologize or to tell us what was up with that or to atleast tell us who our new waiter was, UNTIL CHARLES CAME OUT! He came to our table and let us know the situation that our original waiter hadn't even put the nachos in the system not only that but after a few minutes of seeing our unsatisfied faces, he offered us a dessert on the house. He made everything alright in the world! After he became our waiter everything was good, he talked to us about our day and little small talk like that. It was all good after charles and instead of giving BJs a 1 star review, ONLY because of Charles am i giving a 3 star review.  I think BJs should try to encourage more of a courteous attitude on their waiters because it was a horrible feeling getting ""i'll check up on that"" and then completely ignoring us every time they came out from that kitchen door. just gotta thank charles cuz he changed our whole night around and our whole tip around for that matter."
robin s.,"Culver City, CA",18,80,39,5.0,7/1/2014,In the craziness of the usa soccer game I just wanted a gluten free meal but the poor people who work there with all the rude customers the service and food was great our server Caleb was a calm in the storm
