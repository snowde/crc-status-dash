Kate A.,"Atlanta, GA",368,190,188,1.0,1/24/2014,"Okay. So occasionally I have been known to be rather...hoighty-toighty with my restaurant selections. But I'm also a total sucker for a well-made cocktail and a pizookie from BJ's. I've been to several locations throughout the years, and usually it is a pleasant experience. Today was the exception. A coworker and I ran here for a quick lunch. We were seated on the patio and introduced to our waitress, and within minutes it became apparent that she was brand new, overwhelmed and in the weeds. * I ordered an iced tea and my colleague ordered a drink. Ten minutes passed; no drinks. We asked again. Ten more minutes and no drinks. My coworker finally went to the bar and spoke to someone there, and eventually our drinks surfaced....25+ minutes too late.  * My colleague ordered a flatbread and a side of ranch dressing, and was very clear when she was stating her order. However, about 30 minutes after we ordered, the waitress came over and said she was confused about the burger. Burger? What burger!? We ordered a flatbread, and we reminded her of that. She quickly got defensive and said it must have been a miscommunication on both of our parts. Though we were being incredibly patient and understanding about the situation (we have both worked in restaurants and we get it), she quickly grew snippy with us - and for no reason at all. She went on to say that she was really busy, fresh from training, and that we confused her when placing our order. Not sure how exactly we ""confused"" her when we clearly stated what we wanted....but alas. I rest my case. * When the food finally came (mind you - an HOUR after we sat down) there was no ranch dressing and there were no utensils. It took her a good 5+ minutes to grab the utensils, so we just sat there staring at our food.  The food tasted fine, but we were so put off by the horrendous service and bad attitude that we didn't enjoy our meal. We work very close to this location, but we definitely won't be returning. If you're looking for a convenient and quick meal, I suggest you look elsewhere. The Century City Mall offers a myriad of options, and BJ's should really be a last resort option."
Charles H.,"Los Angeles, CA",72,46,,1.0,9/27/2011,"I've been to this place twice just because my partner said they had an off day the first time. We got sat down quickly and server introduced themselves.  We ordered 2 very simple cocktails (it was NOT busy) and it took them 15min to get it back to our table.  We then ordered our entrees and that took 30min for a small pizza and a salad.  The pizza was over cooked and the salad was tasteless.  In the middle of our meal  we ordered another cocktail to wash down the couple of bites of food we just ate and it took another 15min. Our first waiter had no personality, bland and didn't smile... He disappeared for some reason and got another server who was nice, but still slow. Service = SLOW Food = Middle school cafeteria food (with cocktails) Never going back!"
Olga K.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,21,1,5.0,12/7/2013,"WE LOVE THIS PLACE!!!! Ambiance, great food, reasonable prices, excellent service.  What else can you ask for? We go there at least once a week and it never disappoints us.  Highly recommended.  Kids-friendly, too."
My D.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,182,1,1.0,6/5/2014,"Things got worse in 2 years! Service is slower, 40 mins to get drinks, they were warm by the time we got them and the only reason we didn't want to return those was because we knew it would take another hour!! Food is okay, but they reeeaaalllyyyy need to fix their service!"
Devorah H.,"Los Angeles, CA",20,46,1,1.0,3/31/2014,"This restaurant holds the distinction of being the only place I have ever walked out of without paying OR tipping...though since we received essentially no service, there was no one to tip anyway. The manager was useless and comped our meal only after another customer jumped in to defend me and pointed out I had had to ask for a manager three times. I have, and will, never return."
Paul B.,"Saratoga County, NY",0,8,,2.0,8/21/2014,"It really upsets me that I would have to rate this location with 2 stars.  BJ's menu is extremely large and diverse.  Pretty much everything I have ordered or tried has tasted good and been enjoyable.  The Century City mall is beautiful and the location that BJ's has, including the outdoor seating, is excellent.  Sadly, the owner/management need some type of drastic wake up call regarding the service at this location. You may get lucky, but more than likely your visit to this BJ's will take you twice as long as however long you planned on spending there.  You might get upset at your server, but after personally experiencing bad service here multiple times with multiple different servers I have come to a couple of conclusions.  First, there are not enough servers scheduled for each shift.  At other restaurants (where you get good service) you might see your server at 3, 4, or maybe 5 tables other than your own.  I have observed servers at this restaurant waiting on 8-10 or possibly more tables at once.  There is no way you are getting good service from someone who is trying to juggle that many customers at one time.  Second, as a result of their customer load, servers start performing poorly, forgetting things, forgetting about tables, or develop attitude issues (likely from being screamed at by annoyed, waiting customers). Not worth saying much else.  The food is pretty good, the location is cool, but the service ruins it.  If the management could staff the restaurant appropriately this place would get 4-5 stars."
Pauline J.,"Ventura, CA",1,17,,1.0,6/19/2015,"The worst BJ's ever. Terrible service every time I go here. Never any utensils and they make you sit with your hot food with no utensils for 5-10 minutes. Always have to flag them down to order, to get utensils, to check on your food, to correct your order, to get your check... Worst service on a consistent basis out of any restaurant I've ever been to. The only reason I ever go back is because I work nearby and apparent have memory loss issues."
Jacob B.,"West Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",217,89,3,2.0,6/18/2011,"Pros: Pizza and Pizzokie, Only place in century city that's a sportsbar Cons: Be warned the staff here is extremly slow and do not really have their act together."
Rp A.,"Sydney, Australia",0,12,2,1.0,1/8/2013,We went with 5 people and they had trouble seating us somewhere other than the high chairs in the middle area - it was not a busy night. We had to move the tables ourselves to join them together. The food was super saturated with grease and sauces - my boyfriend and I felt really uncomfortable for a couple days after. We had the fish tacos - I could only taste the bitter cabbage lol. Not going there again... sorry.
Mark F.,"Los Angeles, CA",42,36,,2.0,2/9/2012,"This chain restaurant is not a place to seek out specifically for Happy Hour Specials, but if you happen to be in Century City, check out their festive Happy Hour scene with 20 different beers on tap.  With TVs throughout the bar area and easily visiable from the restaurant, this is a good place to watch a game.  BJ's Happy Hour Specials run 5pm to 7pm daily with $1 off all cocktails, making a Stoli Martini $7.30. A glass of Barefoot Merlot or Chardonnay is $5.95. Happy Hour Specials on food include $2 off appetizers which brings Thai Shrimp Lettuce Wraps to the reasonable price of $8.95 and very fresh Ahi Poke to $7.75.  Happy Hour Mark and his wife Bar Method Mimi make it their mission to find all of the best Happy Hour Specials in Los Angeles, which they write about on their blog "
Sabrina S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,7,2,1.0,1/2/2013,"I love BJ's and have been to several locations. So, when my friend was visiting from out of town she specifically was craving her favorite restaurant, BJ's. This was our first time visiting this location and will DEFINITELY be the last: -Happy Hour drink and regular priced martini were overly weak or overly strong with no flavor - We ordered an appetizer, pizza and pasta. The cajun pasta had no sauce on it and when we asked for extra they gave us marinara sauce. In our haste to eat (we were starving), we realized it was the wrong sauce. We sent it back and the second time the chicken was extraordinarly salty. We ended up eating 2 bites. -For the pizza (mini pizza mind you): The first time they burnt the pizza so didnt send it out. The second time they rushed to make it so it was doughy (we sent it back). By now we are annoyed and hungry so we ask to talk to the manager. She was giving excuses and acknowledged the pizza was doughy, therefore she wouldnt charge us and would send another one out....waiting...waiting...NO PIZZA CAME. -Restrooms were out of toilet paper and a mess -The bartender was friendly and knew that everything sucked, so he was decent enough to take out some drinks from our check. Bottom line we paid $40 for 1 drink, 2 beers, happy hour appetizer, (no pizza), and 2 bites of an over salty pasta. If you want BJ's I recommend you visit another location."
Mike R.,"Alhambra, CA",9,140,52,2.0,6/20/2013,Service here has been consistently horrible! WTF BJ's?! I love the food here but this location is always bad!
Naaz A.,"Santa Monica, Los Angeles, CA",0,7,,1.0,9/12/2015,"I wish I can give zero stars :(. WORST restaurant in LA hands down. Worst waiters and most of all woooorst manager in the history or managing. I hope she reads this. YOU are a definition of a joke, idk how you even got that position. Can you imagine a manager not giving a crap what you're complaining about and giving you a blunt stare? Not caring, didn't even help us, didn't even apologize, nothing. Girl- get o u t of this business you will get fired every where you go. I hope you do honestly. They messed up my order 2 times- the waiter walked away from me and my party WHILE speaking to him about our concern. lol if you can only understand my frustration. I legit left BjS without paying a penny cuz they were not worth even half a penny. Disgusting restaurant you guys should just close already. Worst management, worst service worst everything. You need a miracle to change your restaurant. RUDE AF. Rude rude no care in the world nothing!!!! Still can't believe the manager lol. She didn't even look like one she looked like a customer with her disgusting attitude. Go home babe."
Ricky E.,"Riverside, CA",16,69,25,5.0,1/10/2014,"Cry me a river y'all butt-hurt individuals. BJ's has great pizza and beer. That's what they're known for. As for service, the staff is friendly just don't ask stupid questions. No they don't validate but that isn't the server's fault either. They don't get parking validated for themselves. Buffalo chicken pizza is "
D S.,"Los Angeles, CA",82,90,38,3.0,8/25/2013,"Went there on a Sunday, early evening, with my girl cuz she wanted a cider! The spot was NOT busy, but just like the other Yelpers stated....service is slow!! Almost died from thirst!!"
T T.,"Los Angeles, CA",180,383,27,4.0,4/1/2012,"Good Food and Good Beer....what more does a girl need? AMBIANCE: Nice general feel to the restaurant, with semi-dim lights, nice decor, etc. We sat at the bar, and there were some interesting distractions on the interesting TV embedded in the wall. For all the other singles out there, it didn't strike me as the type of place you'd go to meet new people.   FOOD: Since we both already ate, prior to meeting up, we just munched on some Santa Fe Spring Rolls while we sipped our beers.  They were really good, and if the rest of their menu is that creatively tasty, I am definitely interested!   BEER: We came for beer, and beer is what we got.  They have a great selection of beers on tap, and even though it was 11pm on a Sat, they said $1 off drinks and $2 off appetizers -- sounds good to me. ~Don't get the Raspberry Chocolate whatever!!  It's so overbearingly sweet, you don't want to go there, unless you're a sweet cider type person (I like crisp ciders). ~The other beers in between were not memorable ~ I really liked the Boddington's Pub Ale.  It was a good, light beer;  perfect to end the night with.  The head was insanely thick (because of the nitrogen). PRICE: For what you get, you're not paying much.  I thought the drinks were cheap ($5-7 draft beers, and some bottles were around $10), and the appetizers were good sized portions and pretty fairly priced ($5-10)."
Katarina M.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,19,1,1.0,11/29/2013,"Soggy pizza in arctic room temperature - very disappointed! I usually love the pizzas here, but not this time. Cold, soggy under baked deep dish pizza that I had to send back asking them to bake it longer. When it came back it was still soggy... The waitress didn't fill up our drinks/water although she walked by several times. The patio door was wide open and it was 54 degrees outside. I asked several times if the door could be closed because it was freezing inside, but they just kept opening it up. I had to wear my winter jacket during my whole meal. Terrible experience and I won't be back!"
Ivet A.,"Los Angeles, CA",49,18,13,3.0,4/6/2015,"My very first time going to a BJ's Restaurant and unfortunately It was definitely not one of the best experiences eating out. Came here Thursday night to celebrate a friends birthday and noticed only one waiter was serving us. There's a lot of room to make mistakes when you're taking orders and ratio is 9:1. Anyway, we ordered drinks, he did ID us of course, but I wasn't pleased. The cocktails were pretty watered down with ice and there was absolutely no taste of any liquor. And still we stayed. Eventually we ordered our entrees, which took 20+mins to arrive. Then, we had a few beers and later we ordered our main plate!!! Took another 20+ mins to arrive and once again I was not satisfied. I won't say I'm a pasta expert but the angel hair shrimp pasta kinda really sucked. Adding Parmesan and pepper helped but it still wasn't all that good. Eventually, we were to leave the restaurant so we signed our receipts and left. 10-15 mins later my friend gets a call from another friend who stayed at the bar saying that she had to go back because she didn't sign her receipt ?!!!! Say what! We all signed our receipt and she had a copy of hers in her hand ! Regardless , she goes back to find that the waiter probably misplaced the receipt and he was not the nicest when she told him this. He complained that he had too many people in the table and it wasn't his fault. WHERE IS THE CUSTOMER SERVICE HERE ?! So, the manager or supervisor let her know that they're sorry and offer two free appetizers for next time- but really ?! With this service there won't be a next time. Maybe I should've left a review with less stars but getting a cookie cake was +1, clean amenity +1 and $1 parking: definitely +1.  So there's my 3 review."
Corky G.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,110,49,3.0,3/8/2014,"Once you get past the clueless and rude hostesses the place is nice. Plenty of choices for beer, salads are good, service is friendly."
Kaytee F.,"Cerritos, CA",4,6,,1.0,3/31/2015,"As an avid pizza eater and BJ's Brewhouse fanatic, I expected my pizza, wings and salad to be a given 10...Boy was I wrong!  When one of my girlfriends took a bite out of the chicken wing she quickly discovered that the chicken wing was still frozen! We informed our server about the ordeal and she quickly apologized. Putting the issue behind us, we waited for the other items we ordered. When our bbq chicken pizza came we were shocked to see that the cheese wasn't melted and the dough wasn't fully cooked. Immediately we notified our server and she offered to put the pizza back in the oven for a few more minutes. Not once offering to have the cook make us a new pizza. When the pizza came out it was still not fully cooked and tasted as if there were two types of sauces on it. We brought this to our servers attention and she completely disregarded it. Again, this was an ideal time to offer us another pizza or another item from the menu. My other girlfriend ordered a burger and said it was completely dry. Salad was wilted and gross. When the bill came all the server took off were the frozen wings. Mind you that all our food items were nearly untouched and on the table. Very disappointed. Will definitely go back to BJ's, just not this location."
