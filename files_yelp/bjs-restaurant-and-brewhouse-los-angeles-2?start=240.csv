Rachel S.,"Los Angeles, CA",73,399,29,3.0,2/20/2012,"BJ's is a pleasant place on par with The Cheesecake Factory. They have a dictionary-sized menu and you can choose almost any mediocre dish you can think of, and unfortunately, the calorie counts are also listed. The servers are polite, though it'll take you about 20-30 minutes longer than you think because the staff is a little pokey. The last time I went there, I opted for an 800-calorie steak over a 1500-calorie salad because, hey, I'm not burning my whole day's count on a salad. The portion sizes here are enormous, but even so, I'm not sure why everything has SO MANY calories."
Lilly S.,"Brentwood, Los Angeles, CA",57,173,23,4.0,5/3/2012,"Went here last night and I enjoyed my food and the service was great. This place is perfect for a late night dinner since they are open until 12am. My waitress was great, she was very friendly made small talk, and checked on us a few times.  I had a grilled chicken club sandwich and it was great. The quantity of the food is good and WILL fill you up. With my sandwich came fries and a pretty good amount too!  Both my boyfriend and I were not able to finish all of our food.  For the quantity the price wasn't bad either. I would highly recommend going to this place if you are in the area and are craving burgers, sandwiches, pizza and salads!"
Jules H.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,69,2,5.0,11/11/2013,"I know, I know. BJ's is a chain and while I've been here many times before, I usually don't review a place unless its outstanding. I wouldn't normally think that way about this place except for today.  Today we wanted to watch the game. Didn't feel like waiting for a spot at BWW so we thought we would take a chance here at the bar. Great choice! Huge TV at the center of the bar was wide open. Our bartender, Jason, was from another planet (in a good way). Talk about service! Friendly, swift, made great drinks and suggestions, and handled all of our complicated ordering with a smile :). Seriously, you never get this service in LA.  Next, they have HAPPY HOUR ALL DAY on game Sundays!! We got massive amounts of yummy appetizers and flat breads for way cheap. To make matters better, as bar food goes, the food was impressive! All 3 of us got great drinks, lots of great food and expert service for under 50 bucks...LOVE!  Wish the Cowboys had done as well :("
Sandra P.,"Fountain Valley, CA",19,10,,1.0,4/24/2012,"I personally love going to BJs...BUT this location has the worst service.  The servers are nice and smile, but they can never be found when you're ready to order, ask for a refill, ask for the bill or anything else.   My advice is if you decide to go to this location, MAKE SURE YOU ARE READY TO ORDER WHEN YOU SIT DOWN.  PUT IN YOUR ORDER WHEN THE WAITER/WAITRESS IS TAKING DOWN YOUR DRINK ORDER.  TRUST ME. I gave this location a couple ""benefit of the doubt"" but every time I've gone back...service is the same...horrible!"
Lucia V.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,7,,1.0,4/23/2015,"Horrible... I regretted ever going to BJ's at the Westfield Culver City Mall... So I gave this location a try, and same horrible experience.  It was empty but it took 15 mins for the waiter to come check in.  Another 25 mins to get our 2 kids orders and my adult order.  Food was disgusting, cold, pasta was mushy with no flavor ($20 dish).  Waiter never checked in until I had to ask for my check.  Not going back again!  The table next to us had been seated for 20 mins before we got there and got their food after we did.   Horrible all around"
Steve W.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,,5.0,6/16/2014,They have a great menu with food options for everyone.  It is very reasonably priced to go with the whole family or for a fun night out with your friends.  There are excellent drinks options and a full selection of beers from around the world.
Suzanne L.,"Los Angeles, CA",39,239,,4.0,3/10/2013,"Don't know why reviews so low. Decent food, decent price. Maybe too much salt, but the food is comfort food. Fresh ingredients, flat breads better than the actual pizzas . Pasta dishes good for sharing. Desserts of course are the guilty pleasure if u have a big group to share w."
Nerisa L.,"Northridge, CA",388,249,1,4.0,3/8/2013,I love everything here.  My manfriend and I have been here more than the average person esp the bar area.  I would recommend this place to everyone for a quick bite or just to get away from the sports bar and watch the games here! less crowded and  away from the college drunks!
Erika J.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,2.0,4/15/2015,"Good food but service is slow. It started out good and then our waitress disappeared and only came back once. We asked for ketchup and waited and waited. When we asked for the check we waited some more, and when we tried to pay the check we waited another 20 minutes."
Marla B.,"Bellingham, WA",165,14,,1.0,8/11/2013,"I'm only giving them one star because I have to give them something for this to record.  I had really high hopes for this place after looking at the menu...ten minutes after I was seated (by a very friendly greeter, I must say) I had not been offered a beverage (even water) never was acknowledged by a waiter and so I got up and left.  The restaurant was not that busy, that a server could have come over and at least said hello, I'll be right with you.  I'm usually patient, but I think if I hadn't gotten up and left, I'd still be there.."
Danny C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,12,,1.0,8/18/2013,I used to eat at BJ's all the time.  Their BBQ chicken salad was my favorite salad to order at any restaurant.  After a poor experience at this restaurant 4 years ago (live cockroach in my salad).  Still have the picture if you don't believe me. I decided to come back thinking that the restaurant may be under new management and that i should give them a second chance.    Nothing had changed except that fact that this time i didn't find anything in my food that should have been there.  Service took forever and my burger was put together very sloppy.  I dont think ill be come back here ever again.
Sey I.,"West Hollywood, CA",34,9,,1.0,4/9/2012,"I love the chain BJ's, but this restaurant can't seem to get their act together.  I've been to this location about 6 times and have had horrible service.  I keep wanting to give it another chance because I like the chain and have had good experiences at other restaurants.  I've been given the wrong order (during take out), have had really cold food, or really burnt food (had their Mediterranean pizza). Most recently, I placed an order for pickup.  When I got there, I was told that someone had already retrieved my order.  Then when everything was cleared, the food I got was cold and they tried to charge me $15 more than what I had been quoted online. The staff always appears disorganized and flustered and not once has my order been correct.  With this most recent trip, enough is enough.  I won't ever go back to this BJ's."
Anthony B.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,2,,1.0,3/1/2013,"This BJ's might have the worst service of any restaurant in LA. The only reason it's still surviving is because of the BJ's name and the fact that it pays the sky-high Century City rent year after year - you'd have to sell road kill to not get volume in the Century City mall.  I, like many reviewers, work across the street, so the only reason I have enough experience to write this review is because of the convenience of deep dish pizza this BJ's location offers. I actually used to work at the BJ's in Westwood, and although the service there is not perfect, it makes the CC BJ's look like it's run by the cast of ""Waiting.""  See below for issues I have experienced more than 50% of the time at this BJ's: -Messing up orders; and I have the simplest orders! -Under-quoting the pickup-ready time; they say 15 minutes and it's almost always 30 -Taking forever (maybe misunderstanding even) to grab you things like ketchup, dressing, water, pepper, etc. -Disappearing; it's not uncommon for them to say they will quickly go to the back and grab your food or one of the items mentioned above and 10 minutes will pass and you're convinced they've in fact slipped out the back door with your food -Attitude; the majority of them act like they've been working the past 24 hours straight trying to plan the next mission to Mars, too deficient to understand that most of the people that came across the street and so graciously decided to spend their money at BJ's work harder and put up with more meaningful problems on a daily basis than the folks at BJ's ever imagined possible. This business does not deserve your money!"
West C.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,61,,1.0,2/17/2013,Food was average at best. Server (katina) was absolutely terrible and nowhere to be found until I asked for the check. Of course I tipped her $0.00.
Shai N.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,12,,1.0,1/3/2013,Sat for over 10 minutes without being acknowledged.   They weren't even busy.  The whole family got up and left without even a word from anyone. They are not getting my business.
Irene L.,"Santa Monica, CA",199,21,5,4.0,3/22/2014,"The food was good but service was a bit slow. I guess they got new employees! At least once you sign-up to become a member, you can get a free dessert. Ask your server about this awesome ""free"" membership!"
Angelique R.,"Koreatown, Los Angeles, CA",2,5,6,2.0,2/7/2014,"I would have to say this is one of the worst BJS I have been to , out waiter was kinda of weird and awkward and my boyfriend asked for no lettuce and no tomatoes on his burger , but it still came with it on it  ,(next time use a pen a paper) the Mac and cheese was bland , I gave 2 stars because my chicken parmigiana was really good , other then that never going to this one again , I'm sticking to Fox hills"
Amy C.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,128,25,3.0,9/16/2013,I have a love hate relationship with BJ's. I bring my family here often because it's very close to our house and my toddler loves the flatbread pizza (what kid doesn't love pizza). The service here is spotty at best and most of the time the wait to get your food is long. The food is average restaurant chain food but the prices are reasonable and the menu selection is huge. One plus is they are open pretty late.
catherine p.,"Las Vegas, NV",131,135,98,4.0,7/18/2011,"This place just opened up in the Westfield Mall in Century City. Can we say new happy hr spot? I must have visited that place at least 4-5 times within a time span of 2 weeks. This place is great to relax with a beer or four after work. Lots of space both indoors and out, lots of TVs (for you sports addicts), good variety of beer and super friendly servers. Once we ordered nachos and since some of the chips came out burnt at the top, they comped us with another order! Score!!  Most of the food I had here was pretty good, except the fries... the fries were pretty sub-par, but now you're warned, so all is good.  Parking in the basement lot, obviously."
Karen L.,"Culver City, CA",1,23,,3.0,1/20/2014,I've been to this bj's a couple times and it is extremely small compared to others. every time I have gone the service has been decent. not anything to complain about but not anything to brag about either. staff isn't super friendly but usually in a decent mood. the wait on the weekends can be a little long and if it is I usually go for a different restaurant that's in the mall with better food and service.
