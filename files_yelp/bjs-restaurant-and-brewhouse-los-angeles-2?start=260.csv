Stephanie A.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,10,,1.0,9/25/2013,"Awful service, cold food, appetizer delivered with meal, overdone meat, dessert hadn't arrived but the check did. Waiter disappeared for 40 minutes. Kid picked it for her birthday dinner. Apathetic everything. Food server was fantastic."
Manolet C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,19,6,1.0,3/10/2012,"Terriiibbbblllleeee service! Called in for take out, i was there standing for 10 minutes and no one even bothered to approach and asked me if i needed something.  I was even wearing shoes, jeans and sweater. how much more if a homeless looking man came in these guys won't even give a crap where there employer gets the money to pay them. 3 people standing at reception booth, neither one of them bothered. then it took 20 more minutes for my order since the person who took my phone order didn't processed my order to the kitchen. seriously.. who hired these people?"
Kurt R.,"San Diego, CA",10,63,,1.0,10/1/2012,Crazy service.  Server messed our order up and then flipped it on us like we did something wrong.  As we waited 40 mins for our late pizza we were completely ignored. His name is Khaled and I hope his boss sees this.  I'm still pissed about this a day later.  Never ever had worse service and I would normally never care about bad service but this guy was such a dick.   Fire his ass
Zach D.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",144,13,2,1.0,1/24/2015,Came here on a Saturday the bartenders were awful to us. They forgot to put in our mozzarella sticks to the system they made us wait 30 minutes and still charged us full price no apology.... We had to wait 45 min in between a drink to receive another one. This is the worst service we have received.
Andy N.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,44,,3.0,10/16/2013,"third trip here in about a month -- first with the wife and baby, second with a dozen friends, and now date night with the wife ... -came for the ""party for 2"" promotion around 5pm -ordered drinks from the bar, including their seasonal pumpkin ale -drinks never came since bartender was on his break -server made drinks himself and made them extra strong (good save) -server was very quick with the drink refills -wife liked the pumpkin ale and she never likes beer -rest of the meal was standard stuff (appetizer, pizza, etc.) -ordered the oreo pizookie -received the chocolate chip pizookie  -told server and he brought the oreo pizookie (no charge) so while bj's has its ups and downs, i love pizza and booze too much to fault them as long as we got what we wanted in the end. a little attention to detail regarding orders and employee schedules would help this place ... a lot ..."
Isabel M.,"Carson, CA",254,32,131,1.0,6/8/2011,"Super slow service, staff was not friendly and instead seemed way too irritated to help or bring me a soda that took over 10 minutes. Also, if you're a manager, don't you think it's a bit unprofessional to yell at your employee in front of customers at the restaurant's opening? Anyway, ordered the Jambalaya and nowhere in the menu it said it was THAT spicy. I love spicy food, but this was unbearably spicy that you couldn't even taste the dish. Complained to the server and he didn't do anything or even tried to accommodate. Sorry BJs, I'll just make my own pizookies from now on."
Ann N.,"Zürich, Switzerland",68,169,13,2.0,6/25/2011,"Exceptionally slow service.  Indifferent service. Ok eats.  I tried out BJ's at lunchtime with several colleagues. Big mistake. I was so embarrassed at having suggested the place.  It took a solid hour for our table to receive our food--most of the table, that is, as they brought out the wrong dish for one of our group who ended up having the eventually corrected meal wrapped to-go.  Lunchtime in a business district is not the time for massive delays in simple meals. We were mostly ignored by the staff, except for a 'your meals will arrive shortly' upon inquiry. A manager (flagged down) blamed the kitchen for the delay.  Food was ok (as much as showed up at the table anyway). But everyone was in a rush to get back to the office so it was hard to enjoy it.  2 stars because they comped us a substantial part of the meal without even requesting it. I appreciate them trying to make things right as much as possible after the fact.  I might try again for happy hour, but I'm fairly certain they won't see me for lunch again."
Renuka V.,"Los Angeles, CA",196,744,37,4.0,6/2/2013,"2 of us went there for dinner on Sat after spa session@Equinox. Shared the ""BJ Favourite"" deepdish and 2 salads for only $3 each, the feta+watermelon salad being a standout!!Salad portions were generous too. Also had their own Porter and Rootbeer-both of which were yummy esp. since it's so hard to find any cola not made with corn syrup in LA!Recommended."
Anastasia K.,"Los Angeles, CA",26,76,31,1.0,9/2/2013,Bland lifeless food. Poor service. The waiters are slow and forgetful. Poor excuse for a restaurant.
Hadi M.,"Los Angeles, CA",5000,29,4,1.0,12/24/2012,If i could give this place a zero star i would. Slooooooooow to non existence service. Food overpriced but ehhh. Martinis taste like they came out of a can. Bj's artisan beers still good but only at happy hour prices. If you venture to go take a good book with you. The server will show up when you're finished with the book.
Rose C.,"Los Angeles, CA",66,66,51,3.0,2/1/2013,"the waiter was making mistake of giving us someone else order lol  must have been a busy or rough day for him, I felt sorry for him but he was not our waiter.  We frequent Culver City location a lot."
Neeraj J.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,1.0,12/23/2015,"been here two days in a row. horrible service each day. sat down 50 minutes ago and am still waiting for my fish. never coming to this location again. none of our food arrived at the same time. ordered four dishes, and each has arrived separately. still waiting for an entree. served us a salad 10 minutes into sitting down, finally brought silverware 10 minutes later after we repeatedly asked two people."
Cristalle L.,"Santa Clarita, CA",2,22,9,4.0,7/27/2011,"Always a safe choice for food delivery and this is why i love BJs. The only thing is that their driver isnt around the whole time so it's a hit and miss thing, unless you're willing to wait an hour and a half to two hours for food.  My fav fav dish would be the pizookie. I've had one too many but the ghiradelli is my ultimate fav. However i dont recommend ordering it for delivery because it's never the right hot-cold mix (hot:cookie, cold: ice cream) it just arrives as a messy ice cream cookie soup.  Another thing i love is the soup and salad combo. They have the best (IMO) broccoli cheddar soup i've tasted. Compared to Friday's (which used to be my fav) this is a killer. I enjoy eating cheese and this soup is cheese overload-in a good way. Another staple of mine is the potato skins. You can't go wrong and the flat bread.  I also always order caesar salad (bec my momma said vegetables are good for your body) and i kinda grew tired of it up until i ordered it with blackened shrimp. HELLO! too good. =)  Their burgers are good as well. I don't drink beer but they have an extensive selection of beer."
jack f.,"Culver City, CA",2,62,5,3.0,9/9/2012,"This location I've visited several times and the same situation happens just about always. I can be with a party of two or a party of ten and that doesn't matter. The service is slow slow slow... I will say all the help is nice, however, don't be in a hurry or expect to get your order delivered without some kind of problem. Example: Your order of pasta arrives and you ask for red peppers and cheese. So approx. five minutes later you say to yourself, did my server go on vacation? All the help seems to be running around each doing something different except taking care of you. A person takes your drink order, another takes your food order and another delivers your order. Bottom line: Food is good and I can't say the same for the service."
Kukis' Mom R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,12,,1.0,10/25/2013,"Terrible service, forgot our nachos, forgot the alcohol in our drinks, cheeseburgers were cold, no appologies.  Never going back to the century city location, my worst restaurant experience....i usually don't give any low stars, but had to on this location."
Dawn D.,"Santa Clarita, CA",1,14,,1.0,12/14/2013,Went to BJ's for happy hour. We were treated so rudely and poorly by this POMPOUS hack  for a server.  His name is Kyle.  He's a real jerk.   There were 10 of us and we all left.   I DO NOT recommend this place.  Go get great food and service at Gyu Kaku.  They treat you right :).
G G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,9,,1.0,9/19/2012,"Century City Location:  This place is filthy and the staff snotty.  Dried food on everything...the menus, the glasses, the dishes, the furniture.  Ugh.  Never going back.  Plus there's some waitress there that talks like Minnie Mouse.  What a horrible experience."
Dth S.,"Los Angeles, CA",33,997,1,5.0,6/11/2013,"I'VE NEVER HAD A BAD ANYTHING HERE!!! how come everything here is soooooo good?!!?? seriously, even tho it's 'family style' and mainstream, bj's rocks!!! but i will say this about this particular location: the male servers are soooooo much nicer!!! the girls are kinda' ditzy and/or wayyyyyy snooty for no reason.......?!?"
Enoch G.,"Santa Monica, CA",8,40,,1.0,6/9/2013,"This location is one of the worst restaurant bar regarding service. I guess the level of service is shown based on what you buy, the other day few friends and i came during happy hours to watch the game we had two servers and the minute they notice we were only ordering happy hour their level of service became immediately unfriendly much with an attitude to say the least this was also the second time this occurred  so whoever reads this and you're planning on going to this location you better be sure your order better be regular menu and not happy hour otherwise you won't be getting good service  for the most part you'll be ignored or your server will pass you on to someone else and never mind trying to let the management know because they don't seem to care , I even tried to contact there regional manager never heard back from him also so again yeah been warned."
K K.,"Garden Grove, CA",7,88,22,3.0,5/26/2013,"I come here for work lunches because it's close by and we can walk over. Service is ok, sometimes good, sometime bad. It's more about the timing. They get pretty frazzled when there a ton of people. When I finally get my food it is good. The only thing is, I can't consider coming here to eat lunch if I am trying to get in and out within an hour, it's just too slow. The staff is always friendly and tries to accomodate but... needs some help."
