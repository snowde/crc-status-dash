Theresa A.,"Los Angeles, CA",116,14,1,5.0,9/8/2014,"Don't get this place mistaken for an Italian food restaurant.  This place has tons of great flavors from salmon to pasta to steak to oriental salads to lettuce wraps to sliders, plus pizza and appetizers,  etc. Plus they have a full bar. No Heinekin but Stella and many other great beers - just ask the enthusiastic, informative staff, especially bartender Kyle.  Kyle was full of life, knew how to work the bar, could handle several orders at one time. Paid atrention to his customers at both ends of the bar and assisted the waiters. My boyfriend doesn't like eating heavy startch. He wanted a good Monday Night Football and some meat. He ordered a Thai Chicken Salad.  Waiter even brought him extra chicken like it was nothing - and no charge.  Happy Hour is great. During football, the Happy Hour lasts as long as the football game.  SUCH FUN! Such great energy here. Kyle made the night.  He even put his hand over his heart and faced the TV while they sang the pledge of allegiance. Those drinks can wait,  he said! Great crowd, all American clean, consistent bar. Thanks BJs!"
Ariana B.,"Brentwood, Los Angeles, CA",110,82,12,1.0,9/7/2014,"I came here for my birthday last night with 9 friends. Keep in mind the restaurant is half empty. Our waitress came and brought us water and didn't check on us for 45 MIN!!!! We were trying to look for her and found out she went On break and our new waiter didn't even try to check in on us. After an hour we finally ordered appetizers and lunch. The brought two of my friends entrees first as we all waited for our food for a good 30 min. They brought our entrees out , we ate our dinner, then had to wait longer for our appetizers. WHO BRINGS THE APPETIZER AFTER DINNER? Our waiter got my drink wrong and I told him I didn't order that drink and he told me I did order it and I was wrong then mimicked me. And he kept acting like he was doing an Incredible job. With my pasta I ordered a side of garlic bread which didn't even come cause they said they ran out of bread!.. Okay...  Worst service of my life. I used to come here a lot never again. Don't eat here lol"
David O.,"Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",0,15,5,3.0,5/14/2013,The service was good and the food was pretty good as well. Me and my girlfriend went to celebrate us finding out we are having a baby girl! The service was not good and the food was OK. Nothing to go crazy about. I would NOT recommend this place to others
J W.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,8,,1.0,6/6/2012,"This is the WORST RESTAURANT i have eaten in in years, and I go out 3 times a week or more. Drum Roll please.........Put on your Sombreros because we need to sing a song... LA CUCARACHA, LA CUCARACHA..... Sing it with me! There were at least 2 cockroaches on the outdoor patio to present a grand finale to our awful dinner.  I guess after waiting 30 minutes to be served, they were hungry too! The beer advertised in the storefront was unavailabe, the service was awful, need I go on? The Asian man who was at the front desk as I was leaving, who I presume is the owner was totally apatheic when I complained about the ""creepy crawlers"" that decided to dine on the rear patio on their way out of the kitchen. He said ""SO SORRY!"" and he smiled at me.  Disgusting.   NEVER NEVER NEVER SET FOOT IN THIS PLACE. Take a backward glance and you will turn into a pillar of salt!"
David O.,"PACIFIC PLSDS, CA",6,48,1,2.0,6/17/2013,"Finally a bar the gang-bangers can relax at in Century City without feeling out of place --where else can you feel yourself actually adhere to the seat from the goo, grease and other droppings which have accumulated over the years.  The 5,000 tv's are a good distraction -- and a necessary one since the wait staff appears to have been trained by watching videos of the Donner party.  Hello?  Hello?  The food is intentionally bland and mildly offensive.  The drinks are adequate when and if you can get served and, as an added bonus, get served what you ordered.  Nothing is meant to provide anything other than what is probably provided at every other BJ's in the universe.  In a word, the place sucks -- but I guess when you name your establishment BJ's that must be the idea."
J B.,"San Marcos, CA",0,6,,3.0,9/28/2013,"I had an average experience at this location when I went the other day. My friend and I needed to grab dinner before heading home, and BJs was within walking distance. I ordered the pot roast entree. The post roast was good and so were the mash potatoes, but it came with just a scattering of baby carrots and a few small chunks of celery. I wouldn't exactly call it a vegetable medley. The server was friendly and efficient. I did notice that the floor was sticky (my friend noticed it too), which made me worry a little about overall cleanliness. Overall, I got a good meal. Nothing spectacular, but it served and fueled us up for the road."
Koki G.,"Los Angeles, CA",86,29,,4.0,6/12/2012,Good food. Decent price. Nice waiters and waitresses.
loki t.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,11,,3.0,8/28/2011,I love BJs. Cheap.  No real happy hour but tons of beers on tap.  Full bar.  Good for sports.  Free 3 hour parking in the mall.
Elizabeth R.,"Los Angeles, CA",166,61,6,1.0,7/13/2012,"I came here one day with friends to kill time before a movie. Can I just say it was the worst customer service I have ever had in a restaurant. My friends and I waited to be seated: 5min, we ended up seating ourselves. Then it took another 10 - 20 minutes to get a waiter. Another 10 minutes for the waiter to come back and get our orders, then another 10- we don't know cause it took too long we BOUNCED."
Ryan P.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",1,10,,3.0,4/22/2013,"It's BJ's. Their food is nothing amazing but their prices are reasonable and the serving size is pretty big. I tend to end up with one of their salads or a pizza depending how I'm feeling. Remember to sign up for their rewards program and get some points that turn into cash back later if you think you'll go often enough to build up enough points. They also have a decent happy hour $4 beers and some happy hour food ranging from $4-$6 depending. The restaurant itself is very nice, opens up to the patio which can be closed off in un-socal like weather which is rare."
lucie a.,"Los Angeles, CA",173,30,2,2.0,10/23/2012,2 stars for the beer selection. Food was atrocious. Airline food is better.
Cassidy W.,"Beverly Hills, CA",24,76,2,4.0,11/18/2012,Love love love this restaurant. Food is absolutely amazing and there's a wide variety of meals. Located right in Century City so you can always grab a meal right after a movie. Make sure you get the pazookie because it tastes like heaven. One thing that bothers me is that the waiters always say my pleasure every time you say thank you.
Tammi P.,"Los Angeles, CA",13,49,2,4.0,1/6/2013,"I eat and happy hour at this BJ's fairly frequently. The happy hour is pretty decent and I've enjoyed all the food I've ordered. Service is hit or miss, and after reading through the reviews, it seems like that's been the experience for a lot of people. The waitstaff is usually pretty friendly, but can be slow, and I've had my order and drinks wrong a few times. It's a really convenient place to go before seeing a movie, though, so I'll keep coming back."
Foncho G.,"Denver, CO",0,17,,1.0,5/7/2013,"PATHETIC food. HORRIBLE service. At BJ's Century City in LA , I ordered La Chouffe (probably the best beer in the world !) the server didn't know what it was despite being on the menu. I almost fainted when they brought with a narrow-mouth glass when this this particular beer is to be served in wide-mouth glass. Mr Eugene Ochoa , the GM and shareholder should know that this should not be that hard to accomplish that - it's written on the label of every beer bottle. You should ask your sales rep for La Chouffe widemouth glasses. I order bison burger which was the driest burger EVER. I asked for extra spread and the server brought MAYONNAISE !!! Never again."
Toia C.,"Los Angeles, CA",231,57,1,4.0,11/2/2012,"I really like this BJ's.  Honestly, the service at this location isn't always stellar (although I have to admit that I have had great service here -- just not consistently), the food is so much better than other BJ's plus you can't beat the location!  It's great for people watching!"
Cathy M.,"Los Angeles, CA",49,31,,5.0,4/4/2012,"And they deliver!!! I feel like such a geek loving hem the way I do but they're just that good. Found a site LA bite which rocks! It always comes fresh and organized perfectly. Huge fan of their Chicken Tuscan limone. If your by the mall or at home craving a huge menu to choose from and a great service, LA bite and bj's can not be missed."
Saterah M.,"Los Angeles, CA",80,73,,3.0,10/24/2012,"I've had Chicago deep dish in Chicago so I just can't make the comparison- there's no competition- but if you're looking for a Chicago pizza that got it's big break and moved to Hollywood, this is your place! But don't be boring- please. Be adventurous at BJ's. For instance- don't be lame and get pepperoni or cheese pizza. Get the cheeseburger pizza! I love it! It's my favorite right now. But leave room for sweet treats because you can't go wrong with a Pizzookie! Now if you're gonna be Plain Jane Lame AGAIN, then get classic choco chip, but if you're one of the cool kids, try red velvet. Or better yet, get a benget! Oh and by the way- the salads have just as many calories as the pizza, so don't even try it! It's pie or bust here!"
Shant T.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,23,7,2.0,1/3/2012,"Roaming the streets of the Century City mall one afternoon, I got the urge to indulge in a rich and heavy lunch. When I get this urge, I like to really make it count, so it's not an easy decision. However, I was quite hungry so time was of the essence. I settled on BJ's because (1) I'd briefly walked into this location once before and was actually taken back by how nice it was for a BJ's - it's a new location, (2) I'm a sucker for a good beer list, and I remembered seeing at least 30 beers on tap, and (3) I thought a good deep dish would hit the spot. Okay, it's nothing too special today, but BJ's it is. Atmosphere: Clean, modern, and lively. Plenty of tvs around the bar. Nice outdoor dining facing Constellation Blvd.  Beer: I'm ballparking this, but at least 30 beers on tap, ranging from 8-10 BJ brews to your typical imports to seasonal craft beers. Not the most unique brews, but still, it holds its own, especially for a chain. I had 2 pints, and apparently they're $3 during lunch time... boom! Service: Corporate chain. Very good. Food: I hadn't viewed a BJs menu in quite some time, but it's approaching Cheesecake Factory status (fyi - i like CF)... geezuz, so many pages! Similar format too. I dont know, maybe it's the same company. Going back to the ""rich and heavy"" theme, I ordered a small pepperoni/meatball. I don't generally prefer deep dish, but I've had some damn good deep dish before. Gotta say though, not a fan of BJ's version: 95%  fluffy dough / 5% toppings, cheese, and sauce. What is that?? I mean, if they served that as actual bread, it would be fine, but your signature pizza?... no! I get the feeling a lot of the items on the menu would be just okay. Not terrible, but nothing special...  At the end of the day, I felt like I wasted an opportunity of indulgence. Disappointment sets in. Oh well..."
Shey P.,"Chicago, IL",0,41,,2.0,1/24/2014,"Thin crust pizzas we ordered were cold as if they've been sitting around for 10 -15 minutes.  Pizza tastes mediocre, but expensive.  Service was fair.  Ambiance and atmosphere very nice.  Bathrooms very clean.  Dishes clean."
Cris Z.,"Glendale, Los Angeles, CA",2,10,1,1.0,11/22/2012,"Gave this place 4 chances every time I had very bad service. Don't ask for much just fill my cup and  ask what I want to eat.. Nothing I waited for 15 mins just for some one to get my order. After I'm served no one asks me anything. Had to go to the myself to get a refill. It's a sit in place I expect someone to ask if I'm ok or if I need anything. Two thumbs down. I don't expect much from any place I go to eat but if Im tipping, I expect some kind of service."
