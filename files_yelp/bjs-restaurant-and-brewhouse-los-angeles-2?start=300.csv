Teri R.,"Marina del Rey, CA",124,91,28,2.0,10/31/2012,Ordered a steak salad medium. This is the second Time I've gone to this particular BJ's and my steak came back well done from yesterday. This never happens at the culver city BJ's.  I've ordered the beignets on several occasions and they are served doughy. I guess I will take the extra time and drive to culver city.
Peter D.,"Los Angeles, CA",394,604,241,2.0,9/28/2011,"Super greasy pizza! It's fluffy, puffy pizza. It's okay, but I'm somewhat bias since I prefer the NY-style thin crust over monster meat pies. Got the chicken pesto. It was...meh. Felt like they skimp on the sauce and toppings. Too much competition out there to do anything like that, especially for the bucks shelled out."
Sade J.,"Los Angeles, CA",115,90,8,4.0,6/11/2011,"Just what Century City needed! A fun little spot that makes my fave...pizookie's! Great little spot to meet after work for happy hour drinks whick runs until 7pm....$1 off cocktails, $2 dollars off appetizers and half price mini pizzas. Not bad...there's better...but BJ already has low prices...fun and friendly staff...this might be one of my new spots!"
R P.,"Santa Barbara, CA",0,11,,1.0,1/12/2013,"Service and mngt could not be more amateurish.  Their were 4 of us and everything was bad.  No focus on the customer requests and the kitchen served cold and undercooked food.  The BJ's in Oxnard has always been spot on.   So, it has to be the management that is clueless.  I'll try again as I spend a couple days a week in CC.  It is great they brew beer otherwise I wouldn't be back."
J F.,"Danville, CA",0,65,30,2.0,11/4/2012,"We have been to this BJ's several times and usually food is good and the service a bit slow.  Went yesterday and the service was really slow (60 mins to get our food) and the steak that they brought was rare vs. medium well.   The flatbread pizza , deep dish pizza, and burgers were great so mixed results here.  Plan on inconsistent service and to be sure you get good food stay with the traditional pizza, burgers etc."
Ess D.,"Daytona Beach, FL",24,4,,1.0,10/26/2012,I should have went to the grocery store to buy a calzone instead of BJ's......
Valentina K.,"Van Nuys, Los Angeles, CA",11,17,2,5.0,5/28/2012,"The food is delish, they make a delicious stout, and the people are super nice. The avocado rolls are amazing."
Tiana H.,"Austin, TX",1021,568,255,4.0,2/12/2012,Perfect for a quick lunch on my break. $8 for half and half special. Love their great white pizza too. Cesar salad is amazing. Awesome bar area if you don't feel like waiting for dining room seating you can seat yourself.
Vee C.,"Pasadena, CA",1,33,,1.0,12/13/2011,"My sister held her son's b-day party there, and I was invited.  Shockingly poor food, and two of his 4 friend/guests were served their dinnners AFTER everyone else had finished eating!!!  My martini drink was served WARM.  They were perplexed that this would be otherwise, saying lots of their drinks are served this way.  The solution was to bring the same drink back, 10 minutes later, with some ice cubes floating in it!!!  A martini, mind you! This wasn't the first time.  I kept my mouth shut when my sister said she was taking her son and his friends to this place, as her son wanted to go there since he had just turned 21.   The reason was my husband and I had just had the worst experience there OURSELVES only 2 weeks before that - and I was thinking about writing a bad review somewhere back then!  Here's that experience:  It took ONE WHOLE HOUR to get 2 drinks and 2 appetizers produced when only half the restaurant was full.  The potato skin dish was so sickening and slimy with oil, that we left 3/4 of it on the plate.  I am humiliated to say I ate any, but I was starving by that point.  Every 5 minutes or so, the waiter would come by and say, ""Everything's just about here"".  They got the drink order wrong - and that took 1/2 hour to get.  On the way out, I couldn't help but ask for the manager, just to alert her.  She was surprised, and said she couldn't understand the slow service, since they had ample bartenders there and the night was ""slow"", i.e., not the usual number of customers, and there was no strain at all going on in the kitchen. Honestly, though our experience at the Westwood BJ's had been little better in our 3 visits there, we never will go to this place again in Valencia.  For that matter, why bother with the Westwood location when there are many much better restaurants around there that are better run and have much better food. This is not a well-run chain, it is obvious."
Caitlin F.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,17,,2.0,6/7/2013,"I work really close so I end up coming here sort of often. The food is usually decent, not great, but the service REALLY fluctuates. Some are fine, but we had a server earlier this week that was totally inattentive, never brought refills or extra things we asked for, and was very curt... until the bill came. Pet peeve- servers who never smile until it's time for you to leave a tip. Also, my friend has had baked potatoes with black spots in them the past TWO times in a row! The first time, she complained, and the server came and explained that the chef (loose usage of the word, to be sure) wanted him to tell us  that it was normal for potatoes to have black spots.... incorrect. May go back here, but only because it is cheap and close."
C C.,"New York, NY",5,41,2,1.0,6/14/2012,Poor service under Jay Clark's watch.  Took me 15min to try to place a to go order!  They kept telling me someone's coming to help you.  I asked for the manager but another lady came to help me and apologized but had no explanation.  Offered me free dessert which I declined.  (she tried but I was already drafting my yelp review) Will file complaint with corporate but won't be back here again.  Would rather take me HH's to Pink Taco.
Alia D.,"Los Angeles, CA",441,470,171,1.0,5/1/2013,"I like Pizookies, I like potato skins. I generally stay away from frequenting chain restaurants on a regular basis. I came here for lunch with my co workers. It was hands down the WORST service I've ever gotten. The restaurant wasn't very busy. There were clearly enough bussers and waiters.  Some of them just stood around chatting and some I could tell were busting their butts to do their job well. Unfortunately we were seated in a section lacking the 'go getter' service type. Even at chain restaurants you can expect to be in and out in about 45 minutes. Our experience lasted almost 75 minutes. There was a lot of waiting. We watched people who came in after us get served first. Out of a party of 8 my meal came out just before the last guy took the last bite of his food. I felt sick from having to eat so quickly to get back to work. BJ's maybe in smaller numbers on a weekend night. Maybe the hour wait means my food will come out quicker."
Arthur S.,"Van Nuys, CA",18,104,42,5.0,2/27/2012,"Great service, Many options on the menu. I really love their pizzas especially the bbq chicken, the crust is soo thick with plenty of cheese."
Wendy L.,"Los Angeles, CA",36,47,,3.0,1/5/2012,BJ's has decent pizza. Pizookie is really good. Service is ok. Prices are typical for this type of places. Wines kind of suck. Beer selection is good. Like the new Century city mall location so I don't have to go to Westwood to mingle with the college kids.
Ragan F.,"Los Angeles, CA",199,59,15,2.0,9/15/2013,"Came in last night and had a disappointing experience from start to finish. Sat outside.  Took about 15 minutes to be greeted by our server. The margarita they brought to the table was truly wretched. It tasted like a mix of cheap tequila and lemon juice from one of those plastic lemon juice squeeze bottles you get from the supermarket. The waiter never returned for a quality check. My friend had to track another server down to find out where his meal was because his entree wasn't delivered with our pizza. Once we got a cocktail server to our table, our INITIAL waiter grabbed her to help him with something.  An hour into the meal and we still haven't been able to send back the awful margarita. About midway into our meal, the cocktail server explained that she was going on break and our waiter was about to be cut for the night. She said this with check in hand, implying that we needed to close out, despite the fact that it was a couple of hours before closing time. As we walked out, we saw 6 workers hanging out by the host stand, laughing and joking around. Oh, and the pizza gave me indigestion. BJ's makes Chili's look like a Michelin-rated restaurant. One of the worst dining experiences I've had in a long, long time. But, hey, I didn't get food poisoning, so there's THAT..."
Emmanuel U.,"Beverly Hills, CA",74,32,244,1.0,4/27/2012,"The food may be pretty good and they may have a great selection of beers on tap (for Century City), but the customer service at this location SUCKS! I've been here several times since its opening and finally gave up due after they kept screwing up my order and their terrible customer service. I vowed never to go back there again, until today. But today was an exception, it was my co-worker's birthday and this is where she wanted to go. I suggested The Counter since they have better servers there, but she had heart set on BJ's. I ordered the same thing I always order (Double Brewhouse burger w/out cheese) and hoped that maybe they would get it right this time. Again, it came with cheese. I told our server and all she had to say was, ""the cooks never listen to me and I yell at them all the time (something like that)"" and walked away. Ummm.... didn't you write down my order and then INPUT it into the computer? Why are you trying to blame the cooks? And she didn't even offer anything to make it right, just went about her way like it was my problem to deal with and not hers. Seriously, the customer service here sucks. They have been open for some time now, so they can't use ""we're still working out the kinks"" excuse.  This time for real, I'm NEVER going to this location again!!! *Quick tip - Free parking at the mall for 3 hours so stop asking every store if they validate!"
Cecilia S.,"Del Mar, CA",1,47,16,1.0,3/31/2014,"Services is slow and rude. My lunch express lunch took 25mins and I didn't get silverware. I asked two different servers for silverware and got a rude look. When I finally got the silverware, they were dirty. When I got a new set, it was short a fork, so not sure if the guy just took out the dirty fork. This"
Sari G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,2.0,9/30/2012,"Both times I went here, the service was outrageously slow.  After a wait at the table, drink orders were taken.  They arrived at the table no less than 10-15 minutes later.  From the time we ordered our food to the time it arrived was 35 minutes.  Hamburgers arrived and there was another wait until the requested ketchup arrived.  The food was good."
Kristina L.,"Reseda, CA",12,61,7,1.0,3/12/2013,"This BJ's is just plain awful!  They have the WORST customer service ever and the staff have terrible attitudes and are not helpful in the least.  I waited almost 10 minutes just to place a phone order for pick-up and this was during a slow time (3pm on a Tuesday).  When I went to pick up my order, I had to wait another 10 minutes to get someone to retrieve it from the back because no one wanted to get the order.  The order came out wrong and instead of waiting for another person to come help me (which would have been 10 mins later) I had to go straight to the kitchen myself and get the order corrected!  Unbelieveable.  This is the worst BJ's location I have ever been to and they should just shut it down as it is ruining an otherwise good chain's reputation with the terrible customer service and careless attitudes of the staff."
Nancy C.,"Los Angeles, CA",71,48,109,5.0,11/19/2011,Love me the Pizookie trio!! Best idea ever!! I pigged out like a Queenbee here recently and was able to get a table pretty quick on the weekend and during the week its dead so always space to eat!! Yum!! All of the food is great and for now has all five stars. Been lucky so far with the hostesses and waiters who have been super nice and attentive. So coming back soon to hit up my favorite thing there the potato chilli meal and the trio pizookie!!! :P
