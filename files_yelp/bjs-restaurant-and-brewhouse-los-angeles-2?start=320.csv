Cin M.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,10,,3.0,8/24/2012,"I'm not a big fan of big chain food restaurants, I dont think the food is that great, but its decent. I havent been here during their rush hour, so the service may be different then. I have been at night and their bar is pretty much empty, its a cool place to chill if your waiting for a movie to start. The bartenders are always attentive and they offer you samples of whatever beer you may wanna try. I have had their appetizers, and the only thing ive liked so far are their stuffed mushrooms, but thats it. They have a pretty good beer selection, my favorite one the pink berry cider (not a beer, I know). Overall a good place to chill, but there are way better places with better food in the area."
Gil V.,"Los Angeles, CA",26,103,8,2.0,12/13/2011,We dropped in for breakfast with the kids and it wasn't great at all. The place was empty but they insisted on having very noisy music playing...I'll keep BJ's for dinner and lunch I guess
Rod G.,"Toronto, Canada",16,61,5,3.0,12/12/2011,"My wife and I like visiting this place late (after 9pm) for their happy hour appetizers and mini pizzas. I enjoy a number of their in-house brewed beer and including their seasonal specials. Our favourites: Ahi poke wontons, and the Mediterranean pizza."
Marika P.,"Los Angeles, CA",26,17,,1.0,3/26/2012,"TERRIBLE SERVICE. We waited for our server to take our drink order for about 20 minutes. Another 15-20 until we actually GOT our drinks. We waited over an hour for our food. It was a Thursday evening, and the restaurant was hardly busy. Food was incredibly mediocre and way too pricey for what I was given. I will never go back to this location."
Kekumukula N.,"Fremont, CA",35,152,16,4.0,9/30/2011,"Clean, great service - attentive staff, and delicious food (loaded potato skins, avocado rolls w/a kick, & flatbread CA pizza) here is what I experienced while grabbing lunch w/my knitting idol.  Nice to see I can always count on a BJ's."
Vanessa P.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,13,4,2.0,1/13/2013,"fun place to stop in and have a bite to eat.  Last night husband and I went in after a movie.  We ordered the shrimp lettuce wraps appetizer.  A food runner brought out our plate.  There were 4 lettuce wraps, each with about 2-3 shrimp on it.  Very yummy.  The waiter came a few minutes after food was dropped off and my husband and I had each eaten one lettuce wrap a piece.  The waiter's first reaction was ""WOW, SOMEONE WAS HUNGRY!!""  I was so confused because we'd each only eaten one lettuce wrap. . . there were only two per person, and more over, how is that his place to comment on us ""wolfing down"" our food?   When he came back later to bus our dish he commented AGAIN ""GEE, DID WE BRING YOU AN EMPTY PLATE?!?!""  It was just so rude and confusing.  We were eating a piece of lettuce with a few shrimp wrapped inside, not exactly a mountain of spaghetti and meatballs here.  So rude.  Having said that, food was good, atmosphere was fun, and I'll definitely go back, just request another server if I see him coming our way to make snarky comments about us gobbling down a piece of lettuce."
Ryan T.,"Gardena, CA",33,120,17,3.0,8/2/2011,"overall, for what it is, I actaully like bj's. I think they do the whole chain pizza joint thing pretty well. I went there a few weeks after my first visit and the service was on par with any other bj's. I feel theyre all pretty much the same, ive never had one be significantly better than another. so, just an update and i kicked the star count up."
Robert M.,"Santa Clarita, CA",44,35,7,3.0,1/28/2012,"If you go, regardless of the experience, you MUST get a pazookie. The service is so bad here that it honestly ruins the whole experience for me. We usually go for dessert and coffee because for something like that it does not matter too much if the service is horrible. For dinner, it is going to be pretty bad...."
Liz K.,"Los Angeles, CA",221,187,12,4.0,6/27/2011,"Oh BJ's how I love thee, let me count the ways. After recently becoming a BJ's Westwood devotee I discovered that a new location was opening in the Century City Mall and I had to pop in for a visit. I live between the two locations and I must say that this one is MUCH larger than the Westwood one, and Its way newer and shinier and fancier. The bar is HUGE and they have lots of outdoor seating as well. The restaurant is located in the rear corner of the mall, away from Pink Taco and Rock Sugar, so its got its own turf but it is somewhat hidden away from the hustle and bustle. The closest point of reference would be Sephora.  So we arrived late night style around 11, which is my favorite quality about BJ's - they're open late. We were quickly seated in the nearly empty bar area and our waitress was a total eager beaver to get to the table and show off her new skillz. As a waitress who works in a super corporate restaurant I always find it funny when you go to a restaurant and the wait staff is so over trained and their speech and pitch at the table is so obviously scripted. Our waitress was fresh outta BJ's training and she was proud of herself so we just threw her a bone at every opportunity. Feature beer? Sure we want it. Start with an appetizer? Sure. Pizookie at the end? Duh! She was walking around that dining room like she owned the place, feeling really confident that her sales tactics had worked. In actuality were just total pigs and wanted to support one of our own. She dropped some dishes due to poor plate stacking and the manager had to swoop in to save the day. All together we had a great experience, its hard to say anything about the food just because its so corporate that the consistency is always there. On the other hand being in the industry provided me a hilarious insight into what its like to work for a brand new location of a famous corporate chain and be like a little robot working for the man. BJ's has some really good beers under their own label so I suggest checking those out before going for your old favorite. Anyway, this is a great place to check out if your in the neighborhood and your sick of the other offerings in the mall."
Jim A.,"Los Angeles, CA",121,110,,3.0,10/4/2011,"I went to BJs on Tuesday of last week (9/27) for a lunch appointment with a old buddy of mine whom I used to work with a few years back. I've been going to BJs off and on for about 3 years. The food is good...I had a turkey club which was done just right with not to much meat. I really don't like sandwiches that have a lot of meat on them. The only thing that I really didn't like is that the noise level was really high and I felt like I had to scream just to keep the conservation going. In all do fairness, this restaurant is in the heart of Century City and it draws a ton of people from the office buildings. Overall, I would come back but not to have a lunch meeting there."
J S.,"West Chester, PA",4,4,,1.0,2/23/2013,Bartenders were terrible. Waited 10 mins twice for beer while they were hanging around the end of the bar talking to other staff. I had I eye contact with them and they kept talking.
Bernard S.,"Arleta, CA",41,41,,2.0,9/19/2011,This place is a hit & miss last time I came here for lunch my chix wings were literally frozen in the middle. No apologies from the wait staff or management. Previous occasions appetizers were dripping in oil and you can tell the kitchen needed to change the oil in the deep fryer.
Sean S.,"Honolulu, HI",215,341,2,4.0,8/20/2013,"Perfect for lunch. They have a great lunch menu with sandwiches, soups, salads and flat bread. Plenty of TV's to tickle your fancy and you can get out of there under $10. I haven't been there for dinner in awhile but I definitely would recommend the lunch!"
Vanessa C.,"Temecula, CA",67,77,,3.0,10/19/2011,"I had a salad... and I had to dump all the meat and cheese off!!!  I am a Vegan please offer at least one meal that is tailored to vegans, PLEASE!"
Ivan L.,"Beverly Hills, CA",78,34,1,4.0,6/13/2011,"came here for the game yesterday - was obviously packed but a friend had secured a table near the giant screen in the bar.  our server Jen was AMAZING.  put up with us and all our crazy requests, people showing up at different times, vegetarians, vegans, beers, margaritas, appetizers, desserts all being ordered at once.  the food was fantastic - since they list calories on the menu i got the ""mini vegetarian pizza"" (modified it ""no cheese"") and it tasted fine, not basic.  the chicken parm my friend got looked amazing!  only complaint - three days ago i got the cookies and cream pazookie and it had FOUR swirls of the cookies/cream whipped cream (the best part!), today it only came with one swirl.  oh well, prob better for that calorie count. also, the bartender kari (sp?) was awesome and great with recommendations.  they have Framboise Lambic ON DRAFT!  been drinking the beer for 6 years and never had it like that before, it's amazing! don't get me wrong, it's no Houston's, but if you want a tv and beer, it's Century City's best option."
SANDRA S.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,10,1,2.0,11/20/2011,"We arrived there on a Sat. night at a little after 7 and were told that there were no seats inside, so we took the outside seating, where there's heat lamps and a glass partition that goes up to just above our heads......other than that, it's wide open to nature.  After they sat us, we realized that not only were the heat lamps at their highest temp., but that the wind was swirling and it was FREEZING.  After 15 mins., my lower extremities were losing sensation, so we asked to be moved inside, after we ordered and received our drinks.  We got lucky and were seated just inside the door, but the wind was still swirling INSIDE,  so it was still freezing--patrons next to us complained that they, too, were freezing, but were told that the doors could only be closed so much, Despite the cold, the food was good, my friend ordered ordered one of their sangrias and the chicken pesto flatbread.  I had a glass of red wine and the gluten-free pizza w/broccoli.  For dessert, we had the apple/berry crisp that came w/a huge scoop of ice cream--very good alternative to the pizookie--nice and hot w/lots of apples and berries, crisp on top. The service sucks.  After we got moved, it seems our order went MIA.  We finally got it after a 45 min. wait.  Our new waitress asked once, if we needed menus and we told her we had already ordered, and a second time, she asked if we had ordered something--seems our first waitress didn't clue her in.  Our entire meal, from drinks to dessert took just under 3 hrs., and we didn't have any appetizer or salad and we had just one drink ea.!!  When we were ready to settle our bill, we couldn't find our server, so we flagged down another one.  Seems our waitress got upset at that, because when she brought our change, no thank yous, just set down the receipt and change!  RUDE!!   My friend said she's never going back again.  I'm still on the fence because I love their pizzas.........."
Todd A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,1,3.0,6/9/2011,"They are still working the service kinks out, but it is nice to have a brew pub / sports bar across the street.  Good selection of drinks and food.  I had the mini tacos and they were tasty.  However, some dude that sat down well after I ordered got his burger before me."
Tom C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,3.0,9/8/2013,"I've only ever been to this BJ's on a Friday or Saturday night and there's always a wait to get a table. The servers are friendly enough but they seem to have just a little too much to deal with, so the personal attention is a bit light. The food is decent, but sometimes comes out a little cold (like it was sitting around for a few minutes in the kitchen). The beer selection is good though; if you like amber beers, then try the Jeremiah Red (it's one of the better reds I've ever had)."
Bella P.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,2,4.0,6/19/2011,"Century City mall definitely needed this: a great hang out for before or after a movie - speaking from someone who sees a movie there almost every week. The red velvet pizookie is absolutely AMAZING I would give it 10 million stars ! Also, as a non-drinker I thoroughly enjoyed their orange cream soda. Knocking off the star for my deep dish BJ's favorite being way too dry. Our server was Jonathan E. and he also deserves as many stars as the pizookie - he was awesome, very friendly and funny and definitely on top of his game. Everything was on point and he was very helpful in answering our questions - esp mine because it was my first time at a BJ's."
Anne M.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",0,6,,4.0,8/18/2011,I love going to this location! I mostly come to BJ's for their pizookies..they're amazing. And their entrees are bomb too. What made me drop down one star was their customer service. I don't know if I just came on a bad day or if the waitress was just moody that day..but everytime we were given our food she slamed everything on our table and some of the items would slide off the plate! Other than that..their food and ambiance is awesome.
