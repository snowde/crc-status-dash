Giselle D.,"Encino, CA",0,24,,4.0,5/3/2013,I ate at BJs the other night for dinner. I was pleasantly surprised that the food was actually so good. The Mahi Mahi was delicious...really flavorful and cooked just right.   My tortilla soup was very good. The salad was fresh. I would definitely ecommend this place if you're meeting someone in Century City and want to go somewhere other than the food court. The service was excellent so you don't have to have such a long drawn out meal.   My only complaint is that the restaurant can be cold because they leave the doors open. It makes no sense that the heated patio is much more comfortable than the restaurant.  We ate on the heated patio and it was great....they even had TVs on out there.
Denise W.,"Beverly Hills, CA",33,4,,1.0,1/27/2012,I have been to this place a few times since I work in Century City.  The service is always terrible and the food is not very good.  I decided to give it one last chance and went today.  Nothing had changed still bad service and mediocre food.   Stay away from this place.
Brandy O.,"Long Beach, CA",104,21,,2.0,12/16/2011,Very slow service. 15 min wait was actually 50 minutes. Not good when you famished / starving.
M J.,"Marina del Rey, CA",0,1,,1.0,2/10/2013,"DO NOT EAT HERE! I REPEAT, DO NOT EAT HERE!!!! There are cockroaches the size of my head in this establishment and they do not care to do anything about them!!  I am shocked that they are still open! I am disgusted every time I even walk by this place and see people eating there."
Krystle C.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,9,,1.0,11/18/2012,Drinks really bad - mojitos tasted like sprite n club soda/lemon drop was tasteless! I understand they are happy hour drinks but some alcohol would be appreciated! Service in dining room n bar area not even close to par and to boot its a Wednesday night - not that busy!! Signature dessert not even offered! Overall bad experience only good thing was company!!!
Vicky C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,,1.0,6/21/2014,"so my boyfriend and I went there one night. we got a really nice waiter in the beginning. then he had to leave and another waitress came. she was not nice at all. but anyways my boyfriend ordered a burger, and he specified that he did not want cheese anywhere on it. I got a chicken and mashed potatoes, and it was okay. our food arrived and the burger had cheese on it, so he told the kitchen person and they looked at him with the weirdest look as if what he was saying was disrespectful. so they took the burger and then it took about half an hour for them to bring the burger back again. meanwhile I was already done with my food, I tried to wait a little but since it was taking soooo long I just decided to start eating. so his burger came back and this time there were no fries, they forgot them. while this is all happening our waitress never made eye contact with us, but she was extremely nice to the table next to us. so the fries came and my boyfriend just had a lousy dinner with a watery coke."
Cam J.,"Los Angeles, CA",86,127,19,4.0,7/2/2011,"i love BJ's! i'm a huge fan of pasta and i must say their shrimp scampi pasta is superb. not to mention their jambalaya! cpk's jambalaya can get pretty salty and at times dense but BJ gets it right everytime. and don't forget to save some room for dessert.. pazooooookie! keep in mind though, portions are huuge and relatively a place for a group of at least six or more people to grub at. sharing is caring after all!"
Scott B.,"West Hills, CA",97,7,,1.0,8/11/2012,"Want a tip? Eat somewhere else! As others have said, the food is ok, nothing special but the service is horrendous. Takes a long time to be waited on, a long time to get drinks, a long time to get food...hmm, I see a pattern here. On top of that, twice when I have been here we were overcharged by incompetent, or thieving (I can't tell which) waiters followed by managers that could not care less about customers. My advice is stay away from this foul hellhole."
Michael Y.,"Mid Wilshire, Los Angeles, CA",19,211,3,5.0,12/18/2011,If you want decent chitown pizza its here. I only come here for the deep dish pizza. Not many places I know have them
Beth B.,"Los Angeles, CA",52,25,1,4.0,6/24/2011,"I'm constantly finding myself looking for a place to grab drinks at the Century City mall and was happy to have a new destination.  The staff is nice though new (the place only opened like.. a week or two ago) and the food is definitely standardized (but not in a bad way).  They put the calories on the menu which is obviously a horrible/good thing since you might not realize you were about to ingest an 1800 calorie hamburger and can modify your order before you bust your waistline..  Ordered the tuna poke as an app.  The tuna was fresh but the chunks were a bit large.  The thai shrimp wraps are very tasty though a little modest in shrimp and the butter leaves don't work as well as iceberg cups probably would.  Also got to try the creole tilapia (from the ""healthy"" menu).  It was solid; the fish was cooked well and the olive/tomato tapenade was very flavorful.  On the whole, it's a satisfying meal and a glass of wine without breaking the bank and you can even manage to feel healthy if you order one of the healthier options.  Boy did I want some meaty deep dish pizza and some southwest eggrolls though...  But not at the price of the hefty calorie count."
Courtney V.,"Caledonia, MI",0,16,2,4.0,2/9/2012,"LOVE this place! Service is always great, beer is awesome, and my favorite to order: Buffalo Chicken Pizza!!!"
Charles H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,50,,4.0,8/30/2011,"I went to a BJs restaurant 15 years ago in a different part of LA, was not all that impressed, and never went again.  That is, until last weekend.  This location at the Century City mall just opened.  It's very nice looking.  It has a large outdoor patio area.  The food is actually quite good for a chain restaurant.  We had a pizza, a salad, and a few appetizers.  I had some of each, and liked them all.  The place was packed, but the service was excellent.  Our waitress was on it.  The noise level is close to deafening.  That's the main reason why I deducted a point.  I had 2 of BJs own beers - the Red and the IPA.  I was not impressed with the Red, and the IPA was a bit more hoppy than I would like, but OK.  Overall, BJs is a nice addition to the mall.  It's the only restaurant on the south side of the mall, and the space has been ""cursed"" with chain restaurants that come and go but cannot seem to stay.  I hope BJs is able to make it work in that space and sticks around."
Robert D.,"San Francisco, CA",32,21,,1.0,8/10/2011,"Their food quality is just ""ok"".  Service is terrible.  I ordered lunch for a conference/meeting today at noon, and the delivery was 30 minutes late.  I had to call 3 times before it finally showed up.  When I placed the order I asked the girl if they knew where our brand new building was located, and she assured me that they did.  However, part of the tardiness was a result in the delivery guy having no clue where our 42 story tower was located.  BJ's, train your drivers and delivery people.  You only deliver to Century City, so workers should know what's around them in a 3 block radius."
Tim J.,"Glendale, CA",2,9,,3.0,9/25/2011,It's a chain restaurant so you know what you're going to get.  The servers are nice enough.  I just don't understand why everything in the restaurant has to be so greasy.  I've been to other Bjs before and the food wasn't this greasy.  It's a good place to go for happy hour or just watch a game with some friends.
Eric T.,"Denver, CO",0,2,,3.0,9/18/2011,The angel hair tuscany noodles were tasteless and beers are watery. Miso salmon was not bad.
Winni M.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,3,,3.0,6/12/2011,"My friends and I checked into BJ's last night. Two of us were there earlier and sat at the bar while waiting for a table. The bartender was friendly and prompt...the mojitos good. The menu is extensive and interesting. The ahi poke was good (not great) and even though I specified ""NO sesame seeds"" it arrived with seeds. That got sent back. The sliders were OK, the calamari yum. We ate family style -- stuffed mushrooms, pizza on gluten-free crust which I really enjoyed, chicken in lettuce wraps. I ordered a glass of pinot noir and got a glass of pinot grigio...we had to repeat our requests for another drink, a glass of water, etc. I asked for the rest of the poke to be wrapped. Never got it.  I had to remember the restaurant is new but service really needs to pump it up. TJ (our waiter) is adorable and we enjoyed him...however, the expeditors were not as friendly -- OMG, there were 4 or 5 different runners...so with that in mind you'd expect one of them would remember to bring the beer my friend ordered, or to bring boxes for take-home. They're worth another shot, we decided. We hope they can smooth out the kinks because it's a place with FUN written all over it.  We'll see what changes on our next attempt."
Emmy L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,24,,1.0,2/27/2013,"I wanted to like BJ's because it's close by my office and would be perfect for a quick lunch getaway.  Nope, no dice.  Today my colleague and I went for lunch--we both ordered ordinary salads.  It took 40 minutes for our order to arrive, after begging our waitperson a couple of times to check on our order and after other tables who'd arrived later than us had received their much more prep-heavy orders (burgers and fries, grilled fish, steak, etc.).  (To top if off, my order was wrong--it was a salad, but not the lunch-sized portion I'd ordered.)  We've been to BJ's a number of times for weekday lunches--not only does BJ's always make us wait a ridiculous amount of time (we've only got an hour for lunch, people) but a cooked order is never consistent.  I've ordered the grilled salmon here before, on a weekday at lunch (which took forever even though we told them we only had an hour for lunch; my colleague's food came after a half hour--I had to wait 45 minutes).  The salmon was cooked perfectly.  I therefore ordered the salmon the next time for lunch--once again, it took 40 minutes to prepare, but this time, it was dry as the Sahara.  You never can count on the consistency of BJ's food quality or timeliness in getting it to you.  The only reason we continue to come here (and why I gave it one star) is because of the proximity to my office and the great prices, compared to the other sit-down restaurants in the Century City Mall.  If another restaurant with even slightly better service and food opened relatively close to my office, you can be sure I'd be frequenting that restaurant, not BJ's."
Jennifer W.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,136,,1.0,7/7/2011,"this was literally the worst service i have ever had at a restaurant.  two out of four of the orders were wrong - so wrong that i had to get my food to go.  we waited 20 solid minutes for food while the rest of the place ordered.  the manager ""comped"" a second order of something made correctly, but never bothered to walk over and apologize.  for a lunch place in a corporate area, they are really going to have to beef up their service or they are going to have problems.  (and its BJ's, the food is not worth that service...)"
