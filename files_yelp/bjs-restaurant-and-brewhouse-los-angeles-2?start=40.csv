Mica Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",158,40,26,1.0,5/14/2015,Terrible .... My salad was literally funky and the fries tasted like the metal pan it came in....Oh and more importantly the liquor was weird and like watered down ... I will never come back here again
Justin L.,"Westlake Village, CA",2,8,2,2.0,3/9/2015,"I've been to many a BJ's: Oxnard, Thousand Oaks, Woodland Hills, Glendale, Burbank. All of them solid, with excellent service. This one, not so much. The food was as you'd expect from a brewpub. However, you couldn't get a water glass or another beer to save your life. We had a decent sized group (ten adults), and we sat waiting for ALL of the food to come out. All of this is forgiveable. Except the roach. Just before we were about to leave, I went to grab my jacket and noticed a sizeable cockroach walking around like he owned the place. We reported it to the server who said ""I've worked here for two years and I've never seen a cockroach."" We called over the manager, who said because it was raining and they had patio doors (that were not open) that sometimes they wander in. Still, not acceptable. No one was going for it until the table behind us jumped up in horror. This thing was about 2 inches long, red, and nasty. Needless to say, they asked to be moved. Still, none of the staff nor the manager were apologetic. Then my mother saw it wandering toward our table again, my aunt jumped out of her chair in horror, and my uncle squashed it with his foot, the evidence indisputable. Even after feeling vindicated by its irrefutable presence and ultimate demise (I swear I thought it was in my shoe or in my jacket), there was no apology or recompense. Even after my aunt raised holy hell because, let's be honest, there's some health code violations here, there was an offer of a gift card (because we'd be back?). A simple apology, instead of consistent denials (and I wish I remembered the server's name because I'd to call her out on how unprofessional she was), would have gone a long way. Better than a gift card."
Margaret L.,"West Jordan, UT",36,80,38,3.0,4/11/2014,"I love BJs. This place was a staple for me while I lived in Texas. I was so excited to see thy there was a BJs in century city right next to my hotel. The food was just as I remembers it. Very good!  I can't get enough if the Parmesan chicken and berry burst cider. I sure wish that cider was available outside of BJs.  This would be a 4 star review, but there seems to be a front end management issue. We waited quite some time at the front door before we were ever greeted and seated. Once we were assigned a server everything was better, but still to compete with all the restaurant offerings in the area, the service in this establishment really needs an overhaul!"
Kevin B.,"Chicago, IL",217,259,153,3.0,2/23/2014,"Went to the one in the Westfield Mall in Century City.  From the outside you would think it was a bit more ""classier"" restaurant.  Well its not.  Its essentially an Applebees/Chilis/Bennigans type style place.   Let me say this first... Our waitress was great.  Very polite, did everything she could do to make our experience enjoyable.  The problem is she had to cover almost half the restaurant by herself which is ridiculously given we went on a Saturday night where most people would expect larger crowds.   She did the best she could but we still had to wait for long periods to get another drink, get our food, even get our menus.  But again its not a reflection on her, they were just tremendously understaffed.  Food was average.  As I said before it's just regular bar food.  I'd even say the restaurants I mentioned beforehand were better.  The drinks were good and strong so that was a huge bonus.  Had it not been for the wait to get them, the night would have been even better.  My recommendation is if you go, go sit at the bar and order food.  You will probably get better service there because judging by the reviews as well, the service here is whats really lacking."
Amanda R.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,136,,4.0,5/19/2015,"BJ's is the best pizza chain around! This place is all about variety. Over a hundred alcoholic drinks, dozens of appetizers and salads, specialty dishes like fish and steak, and of course... custom made pizza!  This particular location is always bustling, and the service is very hit or miss. I've heard horror stories about the waiters here, but never experienced anything too off kilter myself. I like to think of myself as young and hip, but sometimes the sound levels are a little much. If you go on a game day, don't expect to have a conversation with your group! But do enjoy the game, because they have fantastic televisions everywhere you look! (They don't have Time Warner, so Dodgers games aren't available.) I was particularly impressed with the piece of salmon I ordered the other day. Was not expecting it to be as fresh and well seasoned as it was, but I was pleasantly surprised and delighted with my meal! I usually enjoy a deep dish pizza covered in veggies, but now I have a back up when I want something lighter. Also really enjoyed the pazookie trio--three mini dessert cookies smothered in ice cream!"
Matthew S.,"Twinsburg, OH",114,128,2,4.0,3/31/2015,"My girlfriend really rants and raves about this place if it is any consolation.  And, if she ever thinks about her Yelp account- you will probably have a 5 star coming.   I wasn't wow'd, but everything was to my expectations and liking.  Our server was very competent and knew all the right-server-things-to-say.  When I ordered my burger- ""Oooh, good choice.  I like that one.""  I knew she was buttering up a softie like me, and I damn well appreciated it.   Food was great.  Hit the spot.  Lady gave up Pizza for Lent which means we both have to suffer, but she does say the pizza is amazing.  I'd return.  Sample around.  And recommend to others."
Beh N.,"Los Angeles, CA",115,21,11,3.0,6/6/2015,"I went there  with a friend  on a Thursday night, wait time was abouy 20_30 minutes. Drinks are priced  reasonably ans the food tastes the best.  We ordered  chicken parmecan and roasted salmon which were delicious. The place, food and drink are great  and I can't complain. One thing I can't get over it is the customer service  and how rude  the servers are. We ordered food and drinks and 10 minutes later another server brings us menus and acts like we just got there and we had to let her know that we already ordered ( obviously,because we have glasses of waters on the table and  o menues= meaning the previous  server already took the menus when he got our order)  And worse  than that our server kept rushing us to pay thr bill while we were still eating just because his shift was ending in 20 MINUTES.  I've heard from so many complains about the service. But the food is delicious."
Aurian Z.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",212,88,43,4.0,4/8/2015,"BAZOOKI?! No, no.. That is not the only thing they serve. Although Bj's does strive to perfect their famous cooky cake, I find their spaghetti's and pizza's a one of a kind. With thick and thin crusts available, each bite is definitely a ""bite to remember."" Never did I think a fairies hair would taste so good?! Blackened Chicken wrapped around some angel hair pasta, YUM. Visit, Visit for a beer, A burger, A bazooki! Just go!"
Sukhraj B.,"Orange, CA",1723,1189,1870,3.0,5/29/2013,"After watching Fast and Furious 6 at the theater nearby, we found out some friends were nearby and agreed to meet here for drinks and light appetizers. At 10:30pm, this place was still busy. I guess I should have expected that. It's LA and it's a holiday weekend. We found a table near the bar and parked our butts there. The waiter was quick with waters and drink orders. We all got beer. Yay! Our appetizers - avocado eggs rolls and angus beef sliders, were just average which is a shame because I usually like the egg rolls here. The sliders tasted like cheap McDonald's cheeseburgers. No flavor, just flat and the sauce was a ketchup. Seriously? This place is great to hang out and get some drinks and also has good service but the food was just meh. I've had better food at other locations. Maybe it was just an off night. Who knows?"
Cheryl L.,"Tracy, CA",1564,72,136,3.0,9/11/2015,"Our servers was great! Jaime and James were great. My strawberry mojitos were delicious. The avocado rolls were ok. The mouse that ran under the booth near the front door was SCARY!!!!! The manager that suggested that she was being ""hospitable"" by not closing the patio door when we were sitting outside (to keep the mice out due to construction) was...ridiculous."
Chris G.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",789,1189,1413,3.0,6/30/2013,"Good open air setting, outside patio is covered and not too hot.  Good spot for a craft beer and some appetizers. Had lunch yesterday, and generally had no complaints, outside of our waiter, Tony, who seemed to forget we were sitting outside - never asked how our food was until it was gone, and I had to eat my burger while sharing a drink with my wife - mine was empty before the food even arrived.  Tony, you broke several rules from the 'service 101' handbook. Outside of that, I like the location, very clean restaurant and a ton of televisions for anyone needing to watch a sporting event, or whatever.  The food was good, I enjoyed the Black and Bleu Burger (B+), and my wife liked her BBQ Chicken Salad (B+).  BJ's is also notorious for having good craft beers, something I can confirm.  ;)"
The Q.,"Long Beach, CA",509,551,43,3.0,9/29/2014,Food Ok Service sometimes good most the time slow I really like the name tho
Nazanin N.,"Azusa, CA",1,10,10,3.0,6/6/2015,Honey Sriracha Brussels sprouts are way different from the picture on the menu. They came burnt and tasted very bitter. We were told that's how they come. Not tasty at all.
Christy A.,"Saint Louis, MO",4671,1278,11725,2.0,12/15/2013,Walked in to a less than great greeting from the hostess who seemed super overwhelmed although there was no one waiting but my party. It took us at least 10 minutes to be seated after the slow poke hostess told us on 3 desperate occasions she'll be right with us to answer the phone & scope out the restaurant. She appeared very confused & dingy.  After finally being seated it took the waiter another 10-15 just to come over and say hello & take our drink orders. Another 10 to actually GET the drinks....
Alex S.,"Ventura, CA",8,7,,1.0,11/21/2015,"I should have listened to Yelp!  It's walking distance from hotel so okay, I think I can put up with bad service for a good beer since kids are joining and they eat simple things anyway. Wrong. Their oven and fryer wasn't working. Dude how do you operate a restaurant that literally cannot cook. You sell salads. What? Did I hear my server correctly. Holy cow I did. You have to laugh and enjoy another beer. Kids eating room service as I post this. I should apologize to Yelp for not listening. People aren't mean spirited. This happened."
Cindy S.,"Gardena, CA",1,51,70,3.0,3/17/2015,"The Peanut Butter S'mores Pizookie should be against the law!  It is one of the best desserts i have ever had. I have been to this BJs a few times.  Service is sometimes good and sometimes bad. And what happened to the buffalo chicken egg rolls?!?!  That was one of the best items on the menu! :-( I will go back, but it's not someplace I frequent.  The outdoor seating is nice."
Arlene M.,"Los Angeles, CA",29,15,1,3.0,8/24/2014,My three stars are for two things One star for the service because i was ignored and no one would acknowledge us  Two stars are for the food . Which is great but not being attended sucks so yea
Trueman B.,"Burbank, CA",23,58,1,1.0,11/16/2015,"The pizza I had tonight was absolutely disgusting. It tasted like it was cooked with old grease. I first had to send it back because it wasn't fully cooked. Then, I ate some when my waiter returned it. I have been vomiting all night. Please stay away from this place."
Airik B.,"Hampton, VA",203,191,30,3.0,4/11/2013,"GOD I HATE WRITING ABOUT CHAIN RESTAURANTS! But... The jambalaya is off the heezy! At least in regards to chain restaurant jambalaya. There's always gonna be some scrub from Louisiana that's like, ""Oh that jambalaya tastes like it came out of a box! blah blah blah..."" Go f-yourself Mr. Cajun Creole Man! This is LA! We can't compare original jambalaya to this, but what my taste buds tell me is that it's pretty good! The pizookie is pretty good too. I'd never had it before I set foot in this establishment.OH WAIT...yes I have! I don't know why they don't just call it an ice cream sandwich. It's a cookie with vanilla ice cream on top. BJ's didn't invent it, but the people I was with acted as if though they had. Calm down... Overall this place is A-OK (thus the 3 star rating). They have a great selection of beers. The burgers and jambalaya are pretty good. The pizookie is good dessert. And they have several TVs all turned to sports! I was satisfied (even though I had to watch a Lakers game!)."
Megan K.,"Chicago, IL",290,315,4,3.0,11/10/2013,"I was at a conference at the Hilton and we only had a short time for lunch.  We headed over to the mall.  I liked that there was a cheap ($7.50) unlimited soup and salad option.  I only needed one of each because they were both a decent size.  I had chicken tortilla and ceasar salad (weird combo, I know, but that was on me).  The tortilla soup even came with all the fixin' (avocado, lime, crunch tortilla strips) and the soup poured on top freshly. Way better than I was expecting!"
