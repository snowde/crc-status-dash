Jeffrey E.,"Los Angeles, CA",192,100,233,3.0,11/22/2013,"BJ's is a restaurant and microbrewery that has numerous locations all over the place.  No matter which location you go to, the restaurant will always loon the same.  Hardwood floors, ample table space for groups, and just simple with nothing too special.  BUT... Food is always great,especially the pizzas. When I come here I usually will get a steak dinner or pizza.  If you want pizza, go for the Great White.  It's a pizza like no other, with flavorful chicken, and is cheesy.  The steaks are average but okay; you can't compare it to Morton's or Damon's.  Appetizers are always made fresh; I like their avocado egg rolls and their boneless wings. Being that BJ's is a microbrewery, I don't have anything to say about it, because I'm not a beer drinker.  Perhaps our fellow Yelpers can attest to their beers... Dessert is where this place really shines.  The Pizookie is a great dessert that features a freshly baked, gooey cookie topped with ice cream.  I suggest the white chocolate macadamia or the red velvet.  There's also a Pizookie Sampler if you can't choose. BJ's is a great restaurant where you and a bunch of your friends can go before catching a movie or going out for the night.  It's also a cool place to get some lunch if you work around the area or if you need a recharge from the shopping you would be doing at the mall."
Sooze E.,"Santa Monica, CA",159,262,717,4.0,6/24/2015,4 stars for the Peanut butter S'mores pizookie! Omg. Omg. Omg. I dream about this dessert. I literally come to BJ's for that. Haha. Try it. It's delicious.
Ann H.,"Berkeley, CA",53,46,7,4.0,8/20/2015,The food was good and the service was surprisingly fast. The pazooki cookie is sooooo delicious!
Victor C.,"Los Angeles, CA",48,140,17,4.0,12/17/2014,"My expectations were sooooo low when I ate here, I was actually shocked at how decent this place is.  GREAT lunch specials... which is appreciated since the other mall restaurants here can be very pricey.  Spacious dining room and patio seating.... And I had an actor/waiter who could not have been any more efficient or friendly. He kinda reminded me of Chris Farley!  Hey!  Maybe THAT'S why I like this place so much  :-)"
Mark S.,"Lakewood, CA",1421,291,1047,2.0,7/28/2013,"Not the best BJ's I've been to when it comes to service. Usually when things are hectic, a good server will pass your table every so often to either help you or let you know that things are hectic.   It started out great.  We got there around 7:30 and sat at the bar.  We were greeted immediately by a couple servers who set us up and took drink and food orders.  Our second server told us that he would be the cashier for us and would handle all our orders.  This also suggested that we would be receiving the check and paying the check through him.  Food came in reasonable fashion, and our check followed as we were finishing our meal. Food was great, so no complaints there.  I love that they have whole wheat pizza here. As soon as our check showed up, it took over 30 min for the server to walk by our table!!!  My friends and I were catching up so we didn't notice the time go by, but when we were ready to go, we realized the check with our payment hadn't been picked up yet, and our server was nowhere to be found!!  We eventually saw him a few minutes later but he never made eye contact with us nor did he walk by our table.   Luckily we were in no rush or we would have just walked up to the cashier and flagged someone down. Hopefully this was an isolated event and hope it's not always like this, because I still love me some whole wheat pizza!"
James S.,"Los Angeles, CA",711,1205,474,4.0,5/1/2013,"Tuesday is half priced wine. I learned that while scampering in, after some work, with full knowledge the Stanley Cup Playoffs were on. They are a Brewhouse, fergawdsake, and I probably woulda more likely grabbed a beer. But for whatever reason (including a decent selection of wine), I went with the grape. I will say, as nice as the Sonoma-Cutrer Chard was -- it could have been colder. I know. What I snob I am. And, at half-price. Ah well.  Not really starving, so I didn't go for the food -- which, at first blush, looked a bit heavier than I wanted. But, I'm glad they were open, and that I had a cozy seat at the bar, and had easy conversation with a few nearby patrons."
Farwah N.,"Los Angeles, CA",105,324,40,3.0,9/11/2013,"Good solid place for deep dish pizza or some general Italian American faves. They have a lighter calorie option and I enjoyed the chicken with vegetables a lot!!  My hubby loves the white pizza and he's always been satisfied with it. I used to love their ravioli but its no longer on the menu.  Of course though its all about the pizookie here and the choclate chip is the best. We've tried all the others and with the exception of the red velvet and chocolate ice cram, chocolate cookie combinations (those were just too sweet and too much for us) the other flavors are good. When I come with gf we do the sampler pizookie which is a quarter portion of the regular one.  Great place for happy hour but go with lots of friends and care about the game on tv and finding people to share a pizookie with!"
Leanna S.,"Los Angeles, CA",733,290,145,4.0,12/28/2012,"+ right near my work + never too long of a wait during the lunch rush + great lunch specials  - servers are hit or miss. I've had great ones, and really really really slow ones. If you sit at the bar versus the actual restaurant, they're usually quicker."
Peter Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",597,636,415,4.0,12/4/2012,"Got into LA at 9pm, was ravenous, and came upon this little gem on my walk from my hotel.  Considering how this was the only place opened at the Westfield Century City mall, my choices for food was severely limited. Walked into this place, which looked like a glorified Buffalo Wild Wings to me, and automatically had me thinking overpriced pub food.  However, I was surprised to find that while it stayed true to the ""pub food"" theme, its pub food was quite good. I started off with their house brewed hopstorm IPA. A delicious pint for $5.25 in LA? I think I'll take it. The IPA itself was actually sweeter than what I'm used to, offering a pleasant change. I then ordered their watermelon feta salad and the Hawaiian mahi mahi. The watermelon feta salad was absolutely delicious. It was light and sweet, just what most appetizers should be. The mahi mahi itself was mediocre, having been soaked in salt a bit too long. The pineapple rice, however, was amazing. It was cooked just long enough for it to have a cripsy tone to it, without being too overdone. The pineapple flavor wasn't too overwhelming, and gave it just enough of a balance to soak up the fish's taste."
Vy N.,"Los Angeles, CA",78,25,51,2.0,9/6/2015,"I usually come to this BJ's for their happy hour menu (which is great) but this review is mostly aimed towards their service. A few months ago when I first started going here, the service was great. The waiters were very cheerful and engaged in their jobs. However, as of recent, it has been pretty awful. I came in around 5 PM on a Friday for happy hour and it was self-seating as usual. (Btw, the happy hour seating is anywhere at the bar and in the patio). I took a seat outside in the patio and it took about 15 minutes for anyone to even come and give us our drinks. We couldn't even put in our food orders because our assigned waiter was nowhere to be seen. After maybe fifteen more minutes of waiting, another waiter just took our order because the one that was supposed to be there was in a meeting! The waiter that we ended up with was pretty nice but I just thought that it was poor coordination on the management's side. To add to that, when we got our beers, the whole glass of beer was drenched in spilled beer. And lastly, we just gave them the credit card before we got the check and we only realized when we got home that they overcharged us for one more beer. Okay that was kind of our bad for giving our card before we got the check but it was only because we were just so tired of waiting for whole dmmed meal!! Long story short, the service sucks. BUT the happy hour menu is good enough for me to not give them a 1 star. :)"
Cecilia A.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,33,3,4.0,7/3/2015,Had concerns about this place after all the negative reviews. But went anyway for cocktails and dinner with friends who insisted. Blown away by service when I called to reserve a table. The hostess reminded me about happy hour so we adjusted our start time. Cocktails and Apps were delish!  Dinner was good. Will probably be back.
Chris V.,"Chino Hills, CA",4,15,13,5.0,9/1/2014,Having the best turkey club ever! So so delicious!!!
Patrick D.,"Los Angeles, CA",104,58,92,5.0,10/19/2014,Bartender mike rocks! Go on Sunday for all day happy hour during football!  Beyond awesome!
Nikki U.,"Los Angeles, CA",135,3,143,5.0,11/4/2014,Great for lunch I'm obsessed w the salads and the drinks are great too the Best place to grab a bite in the mall!
Linda H.,"San Francisco, CA",203,284,464,2.0,6/12/2013,"They get a major F for delivery and pickup because they constantly forget stuff, take forever, and are highly disorganized to the point that we avoid eating there for lunch like the plague because it's so bad.  But they finally came up with a good happy hour that makes up for it. Only in the bar area so you have to battle it out with the rest of Century City for seats, drinks and snacks range from $4-$6. $5 mojitos!"
Danny S.,"Los Angeles, CA",65,564,13,2.0,7/16/2015,It is my first time at BJ's and I was underwhelmed. The servings were small and each dish was over cooked. I had been craving Fish & Chips for sometime so that was what I ordered.  Overcooked and dry.  My salad was really good but very small.  The service was just ok and they were not that busy.
Zaybe V.,"Los Angeles, CA",69,45,117,4.0,12/5/2014,Good for happy hour.. yummy small plates.. tomato bisque soup a must try... great beer selection. You have to try their pizookie desserts... baked large cookie topped with ice cream.. Yum!
Kevin M.,"West Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",5,11,6,1.0,1/2/2016,Back again and once more it takes about 10 minutes for bartender to even acknowledge me. Saturday at 3pm and it's empty. He is just cleaning glasses
Lee B.,"Mountain View, CA",54,118,4,5.0,9/10/2015,"The service at lunch tends to be a bit slow, but we got lucky and had a GREAT server today ... Brett G.  Gold stars for Brett!  He was really pleasant, courteous, and took great care of us.  Things are looking up at BJ's.  There aren't as many options with restaurants closing due to construction at the Mall.  It's good to know that BJ's is a viable option.  The food was scrumptious ... love their skinny fries (unfortunately, not skinny on the calories!)"
Jason H.,"Beverly Hills, CA",187,16,1,1.0,11/8/2015,Wow.  No happy hour pizza substitutions?  Pretty lame.  Then realize the prices have all been raised.  No wonder you're closing in a month.
