Joseph D.,"Kearny Mesa, San Diego, CA",5,42,68,4.0,6/8/2014,"I had dinner here with colleagues while I was in LA on a business trip and I thought it was great! Although we has a large group, the service was quick and the food and drinks were good! I ordered their calamari which was a solid choice there, however if I were to go back I would definitely try something else. The atmosphere was great too! We sat in the outdoor patio area which I highly recommend if the weather is nice. Also this location is known for having celebrities and we actually ran into Dane Cook. Cool place!"
Stacia S.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",1,76,1,1.0,6/14/2015,Overpriced DISGUSTING food...Terrible service.  Wont' waste time writing a long nasty review.  Two words... SKIP IT.
Mia Y.,"Santa Monica, CA",3,9,,3.0,1/2/2016,Delicious pizzas but slow service. Lots of people dine here before their movie at primetime between 6-8pm on the weekend will be crowded. They have lots of booth seats inside and outside but always full. Service is lacking here. Server forgot our napkins and utensils so had to ask for them. More of a casual bar environment here. They have TV screens set to sports channels all around the bar and the outside patio area.
Maruko X.,"Los Angeles, CA",1151,1703,12577,3.0,8/31/2012,"Tried a few kinds of deep dish pizza: buffalo chicken pizza **** bj's favorite pizza *** bj's classic combo ** vegetarian *** cheese thin pizza ** the pizza is just so so, nothing much outstanding garden medley salad is okay"
Sharyn S.,"West Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,5.0,1/12/2016,"The staff is so nice here... the hostess and waiters are great.  Their manager, Erica, is the best!  So helpful and gave me free pint glasses!!!  The chicken fingers are great too.  I'm going to miss this place when it's gone."
Richard L.,"Los Angeles, CA",1086,1074,1299,2.0,9/28/2012,Decent food. Poor service. It is not necessarily the waiters fault. The kitchen seems very unorganized and the staff have too many tables/ people to wait on. My pizza was brought out undercooked and others had problems with their orders as well. I will try them again but I hope things improve.
Matt J.,"Miami, FL",7,63,33,4.0,7/5/2014,"The food is honestly better then expected, not fine dining but better then your average franchise. The prices are fair, portion sizes are big, and they have an incredibly cool mobile app.  Service is the norm, nothing amazing but not horrible.  FYI: the ribs are actually pretty damn good so are the desserts!"
Jake B.,"Los Angeles, CA",139,16,1,4.0,11/22/2014,"My wife and I come here pretty often and have really enjoy it. The staff is friendly, the food is good and the drinks come out quick. In my opinion that's all that counts in a restaurant. Our favorite server is by far Ashley. She's easy going, helpful and seems to really love interacting with people! She's definitely our favorite This location is sure not to disappoint"
Rebecca R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,52,2,5.0,7/12/2015,"If you're going to come to BJ's, make sure and eat at the bar. The bartender, Nastassja, was sooooo awesome. She made these delicious drinks and was very nice when taking my order. Very happy with the service I got. High-Five to her!!!"
Valerie P.,"Los Angeles, CA",88,155,52,3.0,8/21/2012,"Eh. Our waiter was attentive, although I went during an off-hour, so I cannot vouch for the level of service during the prime lunch rush. However, I found the food incredibly lacking. I got the soup and half sandwich lunch combo, which was at least cheap (under $10!), but the chili was just okay and the turkey sandwich pretty sad, with bland bread the fell apart in my hands! Kind of defeats the purpose of ordering a sandwich when you have to eat the rest of the thing with a fork. It's strange to see such a lackluster place when there are so many other fantastic dining options in this mall. I don't think I would ever come back here unless it was exclusively for a pazooki."
Jose R.,"Los Angeles, CA",12,13,1,2.0,12/26/2015,"Seated quickly upon walking in but service was horrible in this location... You know its bad when you have to remind your waitress for refills, togo boxes, and bill..."
Cat N.,"Orange County, CA",4271,1319,5866,4.0,2/10/2012,"BJ's isnt the best, but its always there... After debating where to go, my friend and I decided to have lunch here.  I ordered the sandwich and soup combo.  When my lunch arrived it was HUGE.  It included the following and their description: Roasted Turkey Cobb Sandwich: Threw out the 1 piece of bacon and enjoyed it.  It inluded roasted turkey breast, tomatoes, avocado, lettuce, dijon mayo, and blue cheese dressing.  I did not taste the avocado, which was good for me.  There was plenty of turkey inside and the bread was very thick.  Bread was good to tear and dip with my tomato soup. Tomato Basil Bisque- Some oil floating on top but very delicious and creamy.  It was very flavorful and I definitely recommend.  Their cup was pretty big for a cup. Wedge Fries- You get to choose between wedge or crispy.  The wedges were too much and I think I had like 4 and stopped.  They were good though.  Not too salty and just right. I'm unsure how much the total was but it was from their lunch special.  My friend had the prime rib sandwich.  Said it had to much grilled onions inside.  The service was good and our waiter was attentive.  Maybe because the manager was on the floor  Overall, we were pretty happy today."
David D.,"Los Angeles, CA",541,830,1677,3.0,12/19/2012,"BJ's, BJ's, BJ's....what can I say...BJ's is like that friend you have that is sometimes fun to hang with, sometimes a PIA, and when you don't want to be bothered with their personality anymore, they keep finding a way back into your life. I never want to voluntarily go to BJ's, I get co-opted by the groups at the office that can't decide where else to go or worry that other places will be too expensive or too far and they revert to BJ's. I have had the Salad's here, the raw beef, the rice, chicken, margaritas, and beer. It's all fine and it won't kill you.   I wouldn't get the pizza here!  Once you go that low--it's hard to get back into Italian Food Society.  It's probably the worst you will ever have bar none--I can't eat it.  Stick to the other things on the menu and like most chains---KISS: ""Keep It Simple Stupid.""  But there has to be somewhere else.... To be honest...The last meal of chicken breast with rice and arugula from the ""Lite"" menu was really good.   I would get it again...but I still feel like life must have more to offer than an out of the box chain restaurant. Even if their Margarita with the best Tequila had a smile on my face for the next 12 hours....I still feel a need to see if there is more to life...I really need to expand my horizons. I get claustrophobic the minute I enter there off of Constellation.... Even the fake smiles and greetings from the staff does not help. Can you help me get out of the BJ's force field? Isn't there somewhere else we can go next time?  Or should I just tow the line, not ""make waves"" and get back there with the great tasting ""Lite"" meal chicken and veggies? Maybe if I return with someone new to BJ's...maybe that's what I need?  A new beginning...?"
Chelsea C.,"Los Angeles, CA",129,17,1,1.0,10/24/2015,He's probably a Jon without the h because he wouldn't be able to remember the h in John. We ordered three items on the slowest day of the year and he forgets the most important thing. And then when we remind him of it he says oh I forgot to push the button. That's what your girl friend said. You forgot?! Oh well we forgot to pay how about that! I hope Jon gets diarrhea when he gets off of work.
Christian C.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,23,,1.0,8/24/2014,"In order to keep a respectable establishment alive the key is outstanding food and personal customer service. This chain has a great atmosphere but they're service is terrible. I came by for a quick bite to eat, just a drink and appetizer. They failed to comply with reasonable sense of customer service. Our waiter was more entertained in one particular table that he forgot about the rest of us. Made us wait more than 10 minutes just to hand us menus and once our food was served we never saw him again. We had to ask a busboy to give us our check. I would understand if they were packed, but it was a slow Sunday night.  I should have read the reviews before coming here. Disappointing."
Antho L.,"Los Angeles, CA",2527,1028,4472,4.0,12/20/2011,"BJ's is an ideal place to visit if you're wanting to watch a ball game with their multiple large screens in the bar area.   I came here to watch the UCLA game.  Although the game wasn't the most uplifting to watch, I still had a great time here. This location is probably the smallest one I've seen out of all the ones I've visited but it still has a great vibe to it being that it's in Century City at the Westfield. I am never disappointed with any of the food that I've had here and the service is always on point.   I've had the Balsamic Glazed Chicken Plate which is really moist and satisfying.   The Ahi Poke appetizer is quite good as is the Spinach and Artichoke dip. The pizzas are very nice too and I particularly like the Mediterranean topping.   The Gourmet Mac and Cheese is tasty as comfort food. And last but not least, the Pazookie dessert, which is a freshly-baked cookie topped with two scoops of vanilla ice cream...is so very good! They make their own beer as well as serve all the traditional ones. I'm not typically a fan of chain restaurants in general but BJ's is an exception for me.  I'm more than eager to jump at an opportunity to visit one anytime soon. Parking is free for three hours.  It's a great place to relax and reload after doing some shopping."
Taylor B.,"Las Vegas, NV",6,5,1,1.0,9/4/2014,"Just left this after waiting 30 minutes and not even being served anything. Manager Steven porzio watched us stand at the door for 10 min in an EMPTY restaurant before telling us to seat ourselves. Then the server walked past us several times ignoring us. As the sous chef of a successful restaurant and culinary school graduate I feel that this lack of service is unacceptable. We ended up leaving without even being noticed and manager Steven,oblivious to his own restaurant, actually said bye and thanks. I replied kindly thanks for not serving us. He did not seem to care.  I will not be returning to this location again. Thanks Steven! P.S. We even had to pay for parking.. for nothing!"
Christina S.,"Studio City, CA",141,15,3,1.0,1/2/2014,"I had the worst experience here, I'm not usually one to write awful reviews because I am a server, but this was awful. I went here with a friend, we sat at the bar. The bartender was a gentlemen with a bald head. He was very rude and seemed to be paying attention to everyone but us. He was bothered at every question we asked. He never checked on us, we had to flag him down and twice he forgot to make drinks we asked for. Awful service.  Food was good, the only upside to the experience."
Michael F.,"West Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",605,10,1,1.0,12/16/2013,"I was hungry so I went to BJs to eat. Funny, right? Well the weird hostess thought it was. You see... When I approached her to question why we never met our waiter she was confused and replied, ""wait, you want me to get your waiter for you?"" Then I died.  My sister was able to revive me but only because the counter was close enough that her tired arms would not strain by dragging my corpse that far. But thankfully the counter saved my life. Thank you counter.  *______________________*"
Ariana A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,1.0,10/22/2015,"The food was great! However, the service was horrible. My server, I believe her name was Chandra, was very inconsiderate and became very flippant when we wanted to change our desert order. I work in the restaurant industry and found these work ethics very unacceptable."
