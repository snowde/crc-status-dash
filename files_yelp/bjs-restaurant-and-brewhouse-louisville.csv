Andrew C.,"Louisville, KY",2,7,1,5.0,10/7/2017,"I have to give BJ' s all stars. We called on the way there and they were very nice over the phone and put us on the ""call ahead"" list. Bathrooms very clean and not a bad place to wait while you're waiting to be seated (TV's everywhere). The beer selection is one of the best I think, never have I been disappointed with the choices and always great tasting.  Clearly they have stepped up their sevice/performance. They knew my little girls were hungry and brought out some fresh fruit and roll for them, without me even asking and at no charge...who else does that?!! That in itself makes for a great experience. The server was outstanding, extremely polite and well educated on the menu. I had the fish tacos and they were delicious. The whole family was pleased. Thoroughly enjoyed!"
John H.,"Louisville, KY",5,97,,3.0,12/17/2017,Typical. Sat at the bar on Sunday night after Christmas shopping.  The bartender could not have been more cold and disinterested in waiting on me.  Not a good experience.   Avg beer selection - but my order came with a $1 off while I was there which was a nice surprise ($5 IPA after discount).  Ordered the Santa Fe Salad ($14).  It was better than I expected - flavorful and a fair amount of chicken.  I still haven't figured out why more places don't use a spring mix in a salad or spinach vs romaine. Why did I decide to go?  Convenience.  Would I visit again?   Only for the same reason.
Jim R.,"Charlestown, IN",3,85,1,3.0,10/19/2017,"We have visited BJ's a couple times for lunch. Today's lunch was average, nothing extraordinary but nothing terrible either. I had the stuffed baked potato lunch with a side wedge salad. The wedge was very good but it was a small portion. I ordered the chili cheese stuffed potato on the suggestion of our server. The potato was served barely warmer than room temperature.  My wife ordered the chicken ranch Piadini with a side wedge salad. She also liked the wedge salad and mentioned it's small size. She also found the Piadini pretty tasty and said she would order it again."
Andrea E.,"Louisville, KY",96,234,787,4.0,9/2/2017,"My friends and I sat in the bar for lunch.  We had a great lunch and server.  The burgers and pizza are go to's but today was cold and rainy so soup sounded good. There are more than a few options but tomato was recommended so I went with it. It was delicious!! My friends enjoyed their burgers. The Pizookie is one of the best desserts that I've had so if you haven't tried it, you need to!  Disclaimer So, just in case you don't notice- there is a mall attached! BJs is typically crowded and loud. In my experience, they have it covered with enough staff that manage it well. If you are looking for quiet or intimate, I don't recommend BJ's. It's perfect if you are shopping and hungry."
Lynn P.,"Louisville, KY",30,108,32,4.0,7/2/2017,"Several reasons we go to BJ's: 1)  the ribeye - seasoned with a slight peppery flavor, always tender and grilled to perfection. 2)  BJ's Irish Rootbeer - an adult beverage that combines their craft root beer with Irish creme and Irish whiskey.  Comes all frothy in a frosty mug.  They have several cocktails that sound awesome. 3)  the ultimate pepperoni flatbread appetizer - you need to share this with at least one other person or you will be full before your entree shows up. 4)  the deals through their VIP club, which is free to sign up. 5)  last but NOT least is that pizookie!  Warm, in a petite little pizza like pan, served warm with ice cream!   Wowza! Only fail was only in the waitress.  Long wait for her to approach  initial drink order but to her defense,  she had just been assigned our section in addition to one that she already had. She was a pleasant gal and we weren't in a hurry this time so it was okay."
Jessica G.,"Louisville, KY",210,58,20,4.0,11/12/2017,"I like BJ's, I've been twice before going twice this week and was always happy.   Friday Nov 10 I went in observance of Veterans Day with my cousin.   We sat in the bar area because the wait was really long and the bar area is huge so relatively quick turnover.  We were seated and for our drink order we wanted to use our reserve a beer vouchers for Vets.  The waitress (same name as mine) had no idea what we were talking about.  We also informed her that we were here for the Veterans Day deal.   She told us that it was good for up to 12.95 towards an entree.  Immediately after this discussion her service was far less attentive, cheerful and personable.  Granted the restaurant was busy, her service was awful.  I ordered the southern fried chicken and succotash.  I expected a variety of vegetables or at least some lima beans in it but apparently it's only corn and red pepper (the menu says this, I ordered in a haste to get my already unpleasant waitress away).  It was a rather uncolorful dish that I wasn't too impressed with.  I added a caesar salad  (lettuce, cheese, croutons, dressing) for 1.75.  So as my order came up to under $10 I was surprised to see that I still had a check for 1.89.  I was then informed that adding a salad was not a part of the ""entree"".  I wish I would have known to pick a more expensive entree :(  Needless to say this wasn't a good experience at all.  The next day I noticed they were still doing the promotion and I went back determined not to get on here and write an awful review.   This time I has the pleasure of being waited on by Ashley who was nothing short of amazing.  Her cheerfulness was maintained the entire service, she was attentive and checked up regularly.  She was knowledgable about the reserve a beer for a vet and thanked me for my service.  She was truly a breath of fresh air.  This time I ordered the Peruvian Quinoa with Blackened Shrimp and although the dish itself was relatively bland despite loads of great veggies, the shrimp was amazing.   Overall I would be back.  I would probably stick to more popular menu items instead of being adventurous and will always sit at the bar to avoid the wait whenever possible."
Kasen M.,"Brownsboro Zorn, Louisville, KY",172,105,2992,4.0,1/8/2017,"If you go to BJ's, sit at the bar and hope that Matthew is your bartender! After bumping into a friend at Oxmoor Mall, we went to BJ's for dinner. There was a 30 minute wait for a table, and it was really cold outside/by the door. We asked about sitting at the bar. They told us it wasn't reserved, so if we could find a seat we could take it. Luckily, as we approached two people were leaving. We swooped in and sat down. We were quickly greeted by a supercalifragilisticexpiali-friendly bartender. His name was Matthew. And he truly made our night incredible. He let us try samples of their beer. I knew that BJ's was a brewhouse, but I did not realize that they brew their own beers. In hindsight this does make sense. I had the Harvest Hefeweizen. It was super hella good!  And the fun didn't stop there, Matthew brought over a few samples of your own beer mixes. Some sweet brews mixed with a Porter and things like that -- just to be friendly.  My friend, Meghan ordered the calamari as we sat and sipped our beers.  It was a Friday, but I had Taco Tuesday on the mind. So when I saw that they had shrimp tacos on the menu it wasn't a hard decision.  I appreciated the menu had lots of pictures of the food. The menu itself is a tad overwhelming, it's a large book of options much like the book/menu at Cheesecake Factory.  Everything sounded delicious: pasta, flatbread, pizzas, burgers... But I wanted the tacos. So tacos I got.  The tacos came with a side of chips and avocado cream dip -- it was really good.   Meghan ordered the pasta, I didn't try any but her plate was totally cleared by the end of our evening so I'm going to assume she liked it.   Meghan's birthday just so happened to be the same week, so our random chance meeting at the mall turned into a ""hey, let's go celebrate your birthday dinner"".  We asked Matthew if they gave any sort of dessert for the birthdays. I'm pretty sure his answer was ""hell yeah!""  A couple minutes later a small cast iron serving dish with a fresh, chunky chip chocolate cookie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a lit candle arrived.  She loved it!  The desert and the extra touch of the candle really made her feel special. And she was kind enough to share with me, making me feel special too.  With it being her birthday and all, I wanted to treat her to dinner. She didn't know that I was planning to do this and was surprised when I said one check.  With the three beers, an appetizer, the shrimp tacos and the pasta fettuccine, the bill was just over $50.  When I checked-in on Yelp, I saw that there was a banner advertising buy $50 get $60. I decided to do this.  The banner on Yelp took me to BJ's website. When I added a $50 e-card to my cart and attempted to check it out, I noticed that it totaled $50, not $60. I was hesitant to buy through the website and not be able to use it so, I asked Matthew about it. He wasn't sure but he suggested that his manager was a pretty cool dude and I could talk with him.  The manager (I wish I could remember his name), was really nice. He said he thought that it would send me a separate $10 e-certificate, but he wasn't sure.  He also thought that maybe it was an old advertisement, like a Christmas special.  I told him that it was my understanding that a check-in offer or Yelp deal like this would be set up by that restaurant, not just something Yelp put out there without asking. I asked him if he would just take $10 off my check to make it easier on both of us. He agreed without hesitation and went over to the computer to input the change immediately.  I was really impressed by this customer service. He could have easily told me there was nothing he could do about it, but he didn't; and now I'm more likely to return to BJ's. I respect a business that follows through with what they promised. When I return I will want to sit at the bar to high-five my new friend Matthew and I'll try to time it during a happy hour so my bill is a little smaller. But, for an impromptu birthday celebration with one of my besties from High School, it could have been more awesome!  I honestly think Matthew was the difference maker for our visit. We came in having long, rough weeks and left 3 hours later with big smiles and a new friend.  Why the 4-stars versus 5: - the breading on the calamari was a little thin and soggy in a few spots. The red cocktail sauce was delicious, but there wasn't enough. (I feel confident that if we'd not been so busy catching up and asked for more sauce -- they would have brought more) - the Yelp Deal not working correctly through the app. Parent company - if you're going to advertise and have the offer on your website instead of through Yelp directly .. make sure the link works.  (And send your manager a thank you for being such a great guy and following through on that promise) :)  -- his reaction could have been a dealbreaker. Integrity is really import to me; and your store manager has it!  Thank you."
Aleeta P.,"Louisville, KY",163,254,2035,3.0,12/21/2016,"We dined on a Sunday e wning so that we could watxh a few football games.  Surprisingly, the plave was not ""crazy-crowded"" as I expected it to be.  There was a short wait and we were seated within a few minutes of our arrival.  I decided to try one of the Healthy Bowls. The one I chose (Roasted Atlantic Salmon Quinoa Bowl) contained sautéed red onions, sliced mushroms, fresh asparagus, fire-roaated red peppers, Peruvian quinoa with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a soy ginger sauce.   The menu is expansive.  Actually, It's almost too much for the place to prepare all the dishes equally well.  Generally Pizzas and burgers are good, but other offerings might or might not be decent.   Generally, BJ's performs well at its specialty.   It's specialty is offering good beer and a great place to watch sports.  Both of those things it does very well."
Audrey S.,"Douglass Hills, KY",75,50,83,5.0,7/13/2017,Anything I've ever ordered on the menu has been cooked perfectly. This time I tried the stuffed mushrooms and the Ahi Tuna Salad. Both were delicious!!! I will definitely order both again. Tuna was super fresh and seared perfectly. The mushrooms with full of flavor. I can't believe I haven't tried this sooner! It was a delicious meal and I'll be eating here again soon.
Angela C.,"Louisville, KY",119,34,13,5.0,10/12/2017,"Healthy options! For being a chain establishment this place has unique options and incorporates fusion of different cuisines. Great salads and veggie dishes. I'm always seeking places that have healthier and light options at the bar and this place kills it. I recommend the sriracha Brussel sprouts or cauliflower lentil dish. If you are feeling like some fried food is what you need, the calamari is the best!"
Elise R.,"Saint Louis, MO",206,129,11,4.0,3/26/2017,"We stopped in after day drinking on a Saturday because I wanted to introduce my friends to the Pizzokie. We ended up ordering drinks, food, and dessert. For drinks we each tried different beers, and all of them were great! The red IPA was my favorite by far, I highly recommend trying it. For food I split a Cobb salad with my boyfriend and my friend got a burger. All the food was great! And for dessert we had to get the Pizookie because that is the specialty. I like that they now offer sample sized ones to try different flavors. We tried the smaller size of peanut butter, regular, and cookies and cream. They were all amazing, but the cookies and cream one blew us away. Make sure you try the cookies and cream pizookie!! Our waitress was super nice and constantly checking on us and refilling our water. Loved our experience and will definitely go back again!"
Joelle K.,"La Grange, KY",4,58,12,5.0,3/26/2017,"We come here a few times a year and I love this place, if anything so could only lower their score for having TOO MANY OPTIONS. Their menu is gigantic!  I absolutely love their Watermelon Feta Salad, but it is seasonal! Their Veggie Patty that can be substituted on any burger is a great options. Their hot and spicy buffalo wings are wonderful, the Buffalo chicken grilled cheese (lunch menu) is phenomenal if you like Buffalo chicken and grilled cheese!!! Their drinks are very good as well, I have always enjoyed their own root beer and cream soda! Never go wrong there!!   A friend has vouched for the spaghetti and meatballs, multiple times!  Great atmosphere and you probably will wait on a Friday or Saturday but it'll go quick and sitting outside people watching makes passing the time fun! Go Enjoy!"
Michelle W.,"Louisville, KY",31,72,136,5.0,9/1/2017,"Restaurants attached to malls are not my favorite. I don't try to hardcore judge them, but it takes away some of the cool factor to have to fight mall traffic to get in or park. For some reason though it doesn't bother me with this place. The ambience is what you'd want from such a place, the entrance into the mall isn't glaringly obvious, and if there's a long wait I can just browse in Sephora!  I used to exclusively get pizza and not even look at the rest of the menu, until a friend introduced me to their parmesan encrusted chicken. My eyes were opened to amazing other options that they serve and I've never had a bad meal yet. The most appealing part however, is the homemade sodas. Homemade rootbeers, and drinks that are made from their homemade rootbeers are my favorite. But the black cherry is also delicious. Actually they all are, I'm not biased. There are an insane numbers of tv's all over the bar as well so if it's a game night be prepared for a wait."
Mike K.,"Louisville, KY",18,209,214,5.0,1/25/2017,"One of the few ""corporate"" restaurants that I enjoy. Good food. drinks and service. Clean and good energy. Great place to grab a beer and lunch after mall shopping. They are consistent, which is good..."
Carleigh H.,"Louisville, KY",127,187,977,4.0,5/31/2016,"BJ's is always consistently good. I usually try and visit during Happy Hour because the deals are great! During this particular visit I had a Mixed Berry Mojito ($1.00 off for HH) and a Buffalo Chicken Mini Deep Dish (1/2 off regular price for HH). Yum, yum, and yum! My lunch partner had the Pot Stickers ($2.00 off for HH) and a regular Mojito ($1.00 off for HH). Also very tasty. Some of the other things I've had at BJ's that were good are the Lettuce Wraps, Southwestern Eggrolls, Flatbread Pizzas, Ahi Poke, Boneless Wings, Fresh Watermelon and Feta Salad, and the White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Pizookie with ice cream. I also recommend trying the different selections of BJ's brews and cider. My favorites are the Jeremiah Red and Oasis Amber. Don't judge BJ's by it's location set in Oxmoor Mall. Give it a try!"
Gary P.,"Louisville, KY",31,88,169,4.0,11/18/2016,"I'm not a big ""chain restaurant"" fan, but I like BJ's.  Visited them in several cities, and this one is consistent with the rest.  Solid selection of house brews, extensive menu, mid-price level, big spacious stores, and good service. Ate in the bar area and was in the mood for a burger, something I'd never ordered at BJs before.  Ordered the bacon cheeseburger medium, and it actually came out medium, which is a good start for a burger.  Frankly, it was fantastic.  Better burger than I've gotten recently at restaurants with ""burger"" in their name.  Big, juicy, great bun, fresh toppings, cooked the way I ordered it.  Accompanied it with fries and the house Hopstorm IPA. Wife had the chopped chicken salad - a huge salad that we sometime share.  It was a little overdressed for my taste, but it is a huge salad with a sweet dressing that is addictive.  See couldn't finish it.  She went for the house Porter, her favorite beer there. This was Sunday.  We ate in the bar area, where there is open seating, and had a good eyeline to the several TVs behind the bar showing football.  Not exactly a sports bar, this is, however still a great place to watch your favorite game."
P H.,"Wakefield, MA",0,186,1,4.0,11/21/2017,"Probably 3-4 stars for a regular restaurant, but as far as chain American/pub goes I give it 4 stars. The food was fresh and good. I was impressed by a good ahi poke bowl. A couple of pieces of fish were tough, but overall it was tasty and good quality. Appetizer food was good, and they have some darn good beer."
Sue P.,"Louisville, KY",0,8,,2.0,5/10/2017,"My husband and I met for lunch at BJs.  It was his first time there, and my second.  The service was pretty good.  Although, the hostesses would rather you seat yourself in the bar area then stop their conversation to seat you.  The place was not very busy.   My husband ordered a bar-b-que Bison burger (well done) and slaw, I had the Chicken Thyme.  My food had a very good flavor and was very hot.  Although, it seemed to be very hot in spots.  Almost as though it had been heated in a microwave.  His burger was cooked medium instead of well done.  The waitress asked if she could get him another burger or something else.  But, we just won't do that.  We never send food back and accept a replacement.  So, he ate very little.  The slaw was odd as it appeared to have the dressing drizzled over it instead of being mixed into the slaw.  The manager did come out to speak with us.  He apologized and took the burger off our bill.  But, I doubt we will be back."
Tom G.,"Louisville, KY",12,107,380,3.0,10/29/2016,"Started with the spinach and artichoke dip, which was pretty good, could have used more chips but oh well. I ordered a Arnold Palmer, not good at all, just not put together correctly or the lemonade over powered the tea so settled on a Dr. Pepper. The wings were pretty good, could've used a bit more lemon pepper seasoning, the fries seemed to be over cooked IMO, but not the worst. I think the price was a bit too high for the food but oh well, final conclusion is the restaurant setup isn't bad the food is decent but over priced a bit.  It sure how often I will eat here."
Larry B.,"Gatlinburg, TN",29,10,1,5.0,9/16/2017,Great experience! Food is always good and staff very friendly. A favorite spot to stop when you're hungry or just want to relax and have a drink. Yummmmm
Sowmya K.,"Louisville, KY",0,7,10,5.0,6/21/2017,"Went to BJ's for the first time last week for dinner and was blown away by the variety in their menu. One of our friends suggested this place as we were not able to decide on what kind of food we'd like to have for our small gathering that night. They had something from every cuisine including pastas, burgers, tacos, jambalaya, noodles etc. Everything we ordered was quite delicious and tasted authentic to its cuisine. Another interesting thing is their price range is also quite flexible with anything from $7 to $20 and above on the menu. Definitely will come back and try something different every time until I've tried almost everything on their menu!"
Samantha D.,"Prospect, KY",64,100,116,4.0,12/22/2015,"We came here on a Monday night and I was surprised at how full it was! Definitely great ambiance!  We had the Root Beer Glazed Ribs which were AMAZING as well as California Club Flatbread Pizza which was good and the Santa Fe Spring Rolls which were okay.  For dessert we ordered the Pizookie Trio and it was delicious because we got to sample the Triple Chocolate Pizookie with Ghirardelli, the Salted Caramel Pizookie and the BJ's Peanut Butter S'mores Pizookie. I definitely recommend choosing the trio for dessert!  I had the Sangria and it was DELICIOUS! Service was good as well. I will definitely come back!"
Emily D.,"Louisville, KY",84,7,,5.0,8/13/2017,"My mom and I went here a few weeks ago and then came again last night. We love it. The food is delicious, The wait was minimal, and the service was good. The menu is a bit pricey, but it's huge, and we got out spending only $35 including tip. We both got drinks, two huge entrées, and salads. not bad! They have some extremely unique items on the menu, and I would recommend this restaurant for anyone looking for a fun, delicious night."
Allison B.,"Suwanee, GA",2,56,,4.0,9/15/2017,Wonderful house brews and service.  Great place to watch games and eat.  The service was great!  Miss the regular nachos not a fan of the flatbread nachos but still good just not the same.  Their pizza is delicious!
Lauren H.,"Louisville, KY",165,290,384,3.0,3/30/2016,"I rate the food at BJ's 4 stars, but the service here is so awful that it brings my rating down to 3 stars. I generally base my reviews almost entirely on the food and value, so the service has to be pretty bad for it to affect my rating. I've dined at BJ's many times, and the service has never been great, but last night it was horrendous. I arrived at 5:40 on a Tuesday afternoon. There was a respectable amount of other guests, but the place was not crowded by any means. After being seated, it took 15 minutes to be greeted. Unacceptable. I was with my BFF who had her newborn, so going elsewhere was not an option. We ordered and received our meals in a comparatively timely fashion. Our food and conversation kept us occupied so we didn't notice our missing waitress as much until it was time to pay. After requesting our checks, we waited 20 minutes to receive them. After placing our credit cards in the booklet (and leaving it open so she could see they were ready to be taken), we waited 20 minutes for them to be picked up. Ridiculous. There should be a 20-minute rule similar to when your college professor is late/no-show for class. If your server doesn't take your payment in 20 minutes, you're allowed to leave. I mean, come on, we're trying to give you our money here. After everything was said and done, we pulled out of the restaurant at 7:30. Almost two hours for dinner on a Tuesday afternoon. It took so long that instead of shopping afterwards like we had planned to do, we had to part ways so my friend could get home for her baby's bath time. From what I could tell, the problem is that they are understaffed/servers have too many tables.  One last complaint before I think positive thoughts... It really annoys me when restaurants feature happy hour prices that are available in the bar area only. Why should I have to pay full price when someone sitting 10 feet from me receives a discounted price? As a customer, it feels unfair. It discourages me from buying drinks more so than if there were no happy hour at all. I don't get a drink solely on principal. Either that, or I'll walk myself to the bar and order a drink. It's a pretty stupid policy that really grinds my gears. #rantover Now onto the positive. The food is actually really good, especially for a mall chain. As mentioned previously, I'd give the food 4 stars. The menu is large, and everything on it looks delicious. Everything I've tried has been above average. The ingredients are fresh and flavorful. BJ's also features an ""enlightened"" portion on their menu, with plenty of options under 675 calories. It's nice to have more than one or two options if you want to go the low-calorie route. I typically go with a large entrée salad for dinner, or a sandwich combo for lunch. Those are my go-to's, though I've tried plenty of other dishes and have been pleased with them all. Overall, BJ's is a good choice. Perfect for a leisurely day at the mall. If you're in a hurry or have somewhere to be though, be warned that BJ's could slow you down."
Sarah M.,"Lexington, KY",209,407,2016,4.0,3/25/2016,The menu is HUGE to say the least. We went for an evening out with some close friends. The Bloody Mary's  are on point and drinks are moderately priced. We kept it simple with the mozzarella sticks for starters and they didn't disappoint. The personal pizza was great as well. And of course you cannot forget the beer.
Elizabeth M.,"Pawleys Island, SC",351,53,52,1.0,11/1/2016,I always cut through here to enter oxmoor and finally had the opportunity to try it. Nothing special corporate food sisco in and out.
Joy L.,"Louisville, KY",40,16,2,5.0,12/27/2016,I've been here several times and they have never failed as a top rated restaurant! Their food and staff are always top notch! The restaurant is clean as well as the bathroom! The staff is friendly as soon as you walk in the door and the wait is never long even when you think it's going to be 20 minutes they get you in quick!  The food is great and their bar drinks are awesome! You won't be disappointed!
Amy L.,"Germantown, Louisville, KY",559,318,253,4.0,3/12/2015,I am not usually a big fan of restaurants located in or around a mall but BJ' s is legit. I have been several times for cocktails and lunch once and dinner twice. Every time was consistant with food and service. The atmosphere isn't bad. It is a bit loud but not terrible.  My favorite night to go to BJ's is Tuesday- 1/2 price wine by the bottle or glass. Oh happy day! They have a nice wine list too. I had a salad with grilled salmon. Huge portion and good presentation. The menu has a ton of options- including vegetarian and low calorie/low fat dishes.  Next time you are shopping at Oxmoor Mall- stop by and check t out.
Rick H.,"Louisville, KY",0,9,,5.0,9/25/2017,Went with my family tonight. They were running a special on half price large deep dish. I don't normally have deep dish but it was a great deal. I got the bj's special pizza a good mix of meat and veggies. This was one of the best deep dish pizzas I've ever had. I would recommend this deep dish to anyone.
Julie M.,"Louisville, KY",21,289,3,4.0,9/6/2016,"Crisp Potato Skins Platter Jack and cheddar cheese, smoked bacon and green onions. Served with sour cream dip and ranch dressing. - good, I would order these again Kale and Roasted Brussels Sprouts Salad Baby kale, herb‑roasted brussels sprouts, romaine, blueberries, red grapes, dried cranberries, goat cheese, cucumber, candied pecans, toasted pepitas and red onions tossed in strawberry vinaigrette. with blackened salmon - really good, and I would definitely order this again the setting is a bit obnoxious, but who cares when the food is good, amirite"
William J.,"Louisville, KY",77,3,,3.0,4/11/2017,Parmasean crusted chicken was good.  We had a nice server named Angie.  She was great.  Rest of food was meh.
Haley V.,"Louisville, KY",96,139,139,3.0,8/10/2016,"SLOW......it seemed like an eternity to receive our food. I ordered the crispy jalapeno burger, which was good, but had a weird taste to it. I don't even know how to describe what the taste was. It obviously wasn't that bad of a taste because I ate it, and didn't get sick....so that's a plus :)"
Rebecca M.,"Vienna, VA",385,337,279,4.0,12/27/2015,"Fresh and delicious entree salads, California flatbread, and pizookies are just three little reasons BJs is on my ""go to"" list!   Despite being a chain restaurant, BJ's offers inspired and healthy creations made from quality fresh ingredients that keep bringing me back. I wouldn't be reaching so far if I suggested there is almost a mom and pop feel to many of their dishes!! Far more than a Friday's or Applebee's, this place offers consistent quality to their salads.  The roasted kale and brussels sprouts salad is my absolute favorite item on the menu, featuring lovely bits of tender chicken, crisp, piquant onion, salty pepita seeds, acidic and creamy goat cheese, sweet dried cranberries, and juicy purple grapes---all perfectly balanced with just the right amount of tangy dressing.  Then there's the twisted Blt with Bleu cheese, spinach, copious amounts of bacon and a tangy honey-Sriracha dressing. I get two and make it my entree (it's a side salad but you can make it a ""double"" upon request) It's truly a party in your mouth!  Next on my go to list is the succulent California flat bread with bites of chicken, bacon, and avocado on warm, thin crust.  If healthful, savory offerings are not enough to bring you to BJ's, the dessert menu could make any patron smile with sugary delight. My personal favorite is the peach cobbler with sweet succulent peaches topped with flaky, warm crust. A close second is the pizookie, BJ's version of a deep dish baked cookie served still warm and soft in the middle and topped with ice cream.  The salted caramel variety would tempt even the staunchest dieter with its creamy, crisp, chewy, warm, frozen, cakey and sugary goodness all together."
Ron A.,"Jeffersonville, IN",70,60,32,3.0,3/15/2017,"Nice interior for a restaurant attached to a mall. Busy but not too noisy. Hostesses were not welcoming but were seated quickly. Food was not good. My steak was tasteless. The root beer glazed boneless wings were inedible -- burnt tasting. Burger was tasteless, too. Signature dessert had a metallic taste. The mai mai was good, so there's that. The waitresses were good -- nice. Didn't charge us for the wings. Refills were slow in coming. Pricey for what we got. May need to try it again but order more wisely. Or drink a lot. They had plenty to choose from."

Morgan E.,"Louisville, KY",86,149,61,3.0,2/2/2015,"I wasn't impressed - which is unfortunate because I've been to a BJs in Orlando several times and I loved it. I think my biggest disappointment in this BJs wasn't the food but the service. I called several days ahead and asked if I could do a reservation for a party of 7 - I was told reservations are for parties of 8 and above and that I could do call ahead seating for 7. So, I did. Thirty minutes before arrival I called and was told I needed to make a reservation. I was insistent that I was told differently and after a minute or so she begrudgingly put my name on the list. When we arrived we waited for over thirty minutes (why did I call ahead?). A couple of people in our party didn't show so we were seated after the adjustment was made but it all seemed like such a chore.  The food was ok. The Tomato and Mozzarella Salad was very good. I got the Thai Shrimp Lettuce Wraps and there was a lot of good flavor but the shrimp was cold. I'm not sure if it was supposed to be or not. But I wish it had been hot or at least warm. The table service was fine - nothing spectacular but got the job done. I'll definitely be back - but I'll probably stick to the one in Orlando."
Cindy C.,"Louisville, KY",26,15,4,5.0,8/10/2017,"Every Thursday night my widowed mother and her children gather for dinner at various local restaurants. This week we chose BJ's for our party of 20. The reservation was made the morning of and we were each kindly greeted upon our arrival. Since the layout of the seating was one long thin table, a request was made to rearrange the tables where we could talk easier among the large group. They quickly accommodated that request as well. That was just the beginning of a perfect night. We had two waitresses that took our orders, delivered them promptly and courteously, took our dinner orders which came extremely quickly, all while serving every needy request of our large group. Out of the 20 of us there was not a single complaint about our food, service or the amount of time it took to get our orders. This is our fourth trip to BJ's as a group (I go more regularly) and I can tell you not a single one before was any different than this trip. They are a Class Act, reasonably priced and an exceptional place to gather whether your party is a small one or a large one."
Michael J.,"Louisville, KY",0,118,9,3.0,7/2/2016,"Food is great, BUT, $10.50 for a glass of the house wine? Come on! Can't see going back especially when I live in a city with numerous excellent restaurants and don't gouge the customer. Auf wiedersehn BJ's."
