Jason W.,"Atlanta, GA",2,54,18,4.0,7/29/2012,"We have eaten here twice & been pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food.  The service has been friendly & professional on both occasions.  I am a big fan of their blue cheese burger with garlic aioli(be sure to ask for some of their BBQ sauce on the side, delicious).  My wife had their boneless buffalo wings(breast cut into cubes) which was pretty good, but a bit too hot for me.  We started with their calamari(rings & babies) which was very tender if slightly bland.  It might help if they cut their rings a bit thicker.I had their strawberry lemonade which was pretty good, if a bit too sweet.  Very true strawberry flavour though.   James the bartender was our waiter because we arrived early for lunch.  A very nice young man who did not rush us through our lunch & was happy to converse with us on a variety of subjects, while diligently going about his work.  The olympics had just started so it was nice to see the action on the big screen over the bar.   Overall, it is a very nicely appointed restaurant/bar with great staff."
Keith M.,"Pearland, TX",28,68,3,5.0,6/30/2013,"I love bj's.  Wide range of beer, drinks and beers. The food is wonderful. The wait can be long, but the call ahead sitting is worth it on a weekend.. If you like good food and good drinks, it is well worth it. I always go at least twice a week."
Cara F.,"Sevierville, TN",39,13,2,4.0,11/12/2013,"I'm a bar-sitter as a rule, and the bartenders are friendly and attentive. Beer is good for a chain brewery. Food was decent - to - good ... This place is nothing phenomenal but really great after a long day of work."
Bryan X.,"Chicago, IL",38,50,188,4.0,4/29/2012,"Everyone, you should come here for your lunch if you are close by! It's quite a treat to sitting in a trendy restaurant for lunch, and the menu price is so reasonable. The ambient is very urban chic, which does not come easy in Louisville. I think young people will appreciate this place a lot.  I ordered the lunch special taco, it was delicious.  Love the place."
James T.,"Lorain, OH",4,1,,4.0,6/4/2014,Had lunch there and ordered the grilled cheese donut!!! The service was fast and thorough. Looking forward to another visit in the future and possibly trying something different.
Audrey M.,"Louisville, KY",18,4,1,4.0,5/23/2013,"Great veggie pizza, good beer, half-off wine on Tuesdays, big tv wall, open late. More than you can ask for in suburbia!"
Matt B.,"Snohomish, WA",36,396,16,4.0,3/6/2012,"My experience here could not have started out worse. *Sitting down at the bar at 12:45pm on a Sunday, bartender approaches* Bartender: ""I'd ask if you're here for the beer, but I can't serve you any until 1pm."" Me: ""Seriously?!? Is that a state law or something?!?"" *cries* Bartender: ""Yep, sorry. Can I get you a water or something?"" 15 of the longest minutes in the world later, I got my beer. The Tatonka Stout. Holy crap, that was a good beer. Worth the wait, much to my chagrin. I would order that beer several times over any day of the week. They have 8 of their own standard beers and a remarkably good good selection of other craft beers. I was VERY pleasantly surprised at their draft beer selection. The menu was awesome as well. I've never been to a BJ's before and was happy at the diversity of the menu. It reminds me quite a bit of the menu you see at the Cheesecake Factory - just that they traded the cheesecake in for beer. Lots of really interesting things you can find there. The one complaint I have is that the service was not good. Perhaps is was the fact that I was there with a couple friends and their two kids, but the waiter largely ignored  us. We kept having to request that our water get filled (which is one of my biggest complaints).  It was a great experience and I'll gladly go back. I'll just hope I don't have the same waiter."
Ka-Lin H.,"Louisville, KY",24,95,8,4.0,8/8/2014,"I've been to several different BJs all over the country. I have to say they're all consistently good. So what I like about their menu is that they have an extensive drink menu. Especially beer. I'm not a huge beer fan, but I love their beer. They have seasonal beer that they brew on their own, and it's delicious. I remember going to BJs during Halloween season and having a pumpkin flavored beer. It was yummy. Last time I was here, I got their berry cider. SOOO PRETTY and SOOO YUMMY!!!! Come here during lunch time. The pint of berry cider was only $3.50. I wanna go back to have some beer on my own right now just thinking about it. The staff at this particular BJ are all very nice and attentive. I've never encountered anyone rude. So on to their food. I don't get anything but their deep dish pizza. So yum. Their crust is so nice, fluffy, and chewy. Kinda reminds me of how Pizza Hut used to taste like 20 years ago... when they used to be good. hahaha. My only complaint is price. You can get pizza these days at one of the typical pizza joints like papa johns and dominos for less than $10. I got a medium sized 11"" pizza for around $20. It's a little pricey. I would def come back here for their drinks and food, but not as often as I would like because of their price. But you get what you pay for. Their pizza is delicious. So if you like chicago style deep dish pizza, come and try their pizza! Oh so they extended their menu and they now have the regular hand tossed pizza as well. So for those of you who don't like deep dish, you can now get the hand tossed here. Fabulous."
Michael P.,"Louisville, KY",73,79,,4.0,1/11/2012,"Try the BJ! For serious though, I haven't eaten here yet, but I have to give them four stars for the amount of jokes I've been able to conjure up. What a cool name."
Adam C.,"Louisville, KY",84,440,,3.0,7/7/2013,"Good sports bar, but food is not as good as it should be. Inconsistent food left me with mixed feelings about BJ's. Once I had the best cobb salad I have ever had, next time it was completely different and not worth eating. Burgers were overly greasy. Yes I agree a greasy burger can be amazing, but there is a limit to greasy. When you realize it is greasy and hear yourself getting fatter, that's too greasy. I actually didn't finish my burger because I knew it must be horribly bad for me and it wasn't amazing enough as far as flavor to be worth it. Great place for larger parties. Hand crafted beers that can get a little expensive since they are just ok. They do have some lighter options on the menu, so you can eat relatively healthy here if you want. The lighter options are pretty good too, so don't over look them . Menu is similar to Cheesecake Factory in that it is very extensive and actually has the same feel. Apparently some of upper management from Cheesecake Factory now work at BJ's, so this explains the same feel from both places. They do have late night happy hour, but it is not as good as others in the area."
Jeremia F.,"Pittsburgh, PA",218,421,61,4.0,7/13/2014,"I really enjoyed everything I have ever had here. Most recently I went with the grilled fish tacos and they were much better than most places that offer fish tacos. They were cooked perfectly with nice flaky white fish meat with a topping of a citrusy slaw. The service has always been top  notch and the prices are affordable. The ambiance is very nice and apparently they have very tasty beer but I had no one to drive me so I didn't get to sample anything, since I won't drive if I have even had a sip. Maybe next time I'll be fortunate enough to have a DD."
Mr And Mrs G.,"Dublin, CA",77,224,2787,4.0,10/16/2008,"HAPPY HOUR anyone? Great news!!! There's a happy hour from 3-7pm everyday and after 10pm to closing BUT make sure you dine in the patio and bar area to take advantage of the happy hour rates otherwise you will pay the regular price: ALL COCKTAILS & DRAFT BEERS - $1 off ALL APPETIZERS - $2 off ALL MINI PIZZA - half off We have yet to experience patio seating but of all places to be seated in the restaurant, the center part gives the best service. JESSICA was our server and she was awesome! The bar side we had ABBY and she was ok but not as exceptional as JESSICA. And as for the far left inside seating of the restaurant, it's the worst. Sorry LAUREN but you kept us waiting and so with the other people next to our table. I guess what kept LAUREN occupied was one table with 7 people paying separately. OMG! 7 different transactions for just one table."
Corey I.,"New Albany, IN",14,18,9,5.0,12/13/2013,Great burgers and awesome tasting beers! The service was great and always has been! We will defiantly be back!
Sarah H.,"Louisville, KY",127,223,102,3.0,8/3/2013,I have been to Bj's twice now. My biggest complaint is the size of their menu. Restaurants that seem to do everything rarely do anything well. I think their pizzas are what they really specialize in and having tried both the deep dish and thin crust I will say that they are pretty good. The other food however while not bad is nothing outstanding. It's about what you might expect from any chain restaurant. As far as the pizza goes I recommend the deep dish. It's bready and cheesy and delicious. The thin crust was good as well ( I had the buffalo chicken pizza) but part of my crust had gotten pretty soggy by the time I tried to eat it. In fact two slices fell right apart when I picked them up. The buffalo chicken topping was good and pretty spicy. I think it would be better with either crumbled blue cheese or blue cheese dressing drizzled over the top instead of ranch. I think if they scaled down the size of their menu and focused mainly on their pizzas and a few other options this could definitely be a more frequent dinner spot for me.
T B.,"Louisville, KY",0,15,2,5.0,9/2/2014,"One of my favorite spots. Menu is as thick as the Cheesecake Factory, with its very own unique beer options brewed in house.  Can't go wrong here!"
alicia v.,"Simpsonville, KY",22,33,,3.0,3/30/2011,"We always love BJs, we dine here often, its always consistent and good. This time, was not a great experience. Our server rushed us the entire time, he brought boxes when we were still eating, brought the bill before the dessert came. It was very frustrating, especially since it was nowhere near closing time.  We went to the bar for a drink after dinner and the bartender was very nice and helpful"
Jessica B.,"Louisville, KY",33,17,,3.0,9/12/2011,"This place is pretty decent for a chain, and they have a fair number of gluten-free choices. Kinda bummed they got rid of their meatloaf, tho. We order from them via Takeout Taxi at my place of employment, and they've been getting sloppy lately, tho. Last time we went there, my steamed veggies showed up raw."
Shana K.,"Louisville, KY",232,425,509,5.0,3/31/2012,"BJ's is one of the restaurants in Louisville that I can always count on to give me excellent American cuisine.  Tonight was no exception to that even though they were absolutely packed with U of L and UK fans who were enjoying the Final Four on BJ's many large televisions.  I always have to order a soda from the tap when I am at BJ's because they have the most amazing house soda's that are caffeine and high fructose corn syrup free.  Tonight I had a cream soda and it was delicious.  I also ordered a turkey burger (minus the mushrooms) and thin cut fries.  The turkey burger was made with all white meat, was juicy, came with slices of fresh avacado, and was served on a whole wheat bun.  I couldn't stop eating the fries which weren't too greasy and had just the right amount of salt.  I only wish I hadn't been too full to try dessert because their dessert offerings looked delicious.  I'll definatly be back sometime soon for another soda from the tap and some dessert."
Big V S.,"Louisville, KY",5,7,,5.0,8/14/2013,"BJ's has an excellent variety of dishes to choose from, from appetizers thru desserts. The beer selection is nice as well. There is a nice, grown-up atmosphere about the place,brought about by its soft lighting and the layout. I thoroughly enjoyed a week-night dinner there and will definitely return!"
Derek C.,"Crestwood, KY",0,38,,4.0,9/6/2013,They have a large selection and food is great. I always get the jambalaya and it is wonderful. Service is normally good but not always. This is the only reason I did not give it a 5 star rating.  I would recommend when in the area.
