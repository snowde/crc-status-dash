Jamie S.,"Louisville, KY",2,85,2,4.0,9/8/2012,"I've been to eat here twice and everything I had, both times, was delicious.  The first time I just stopped in for a snack while shopping at the mall, my mom and I shared the ahi poke and both got a caprese salad.  It was inexpensive, delicious, and just the right amount of food for a lunch.   The second time I went for dinner and got the parmesan crusted chicken.  It was very good and the sides were good as well.   Our waitress both times was very friendly and attentive."
Alyson C.,"Louisville, KY",20,8,11,4.0,3/7/2011,"They have great prices on small bites, or small apps! Tons flavor and were delicious - thai shrimp skewers possibly? as well as gormet mac n cheese -- mm Cobb salad is tasty too!! We go here when we're in a bind and it is never disappointed."
Sarah W.,"Ypsilanti, MI",99,263,,3.0,10/10/2010,"I would definitely like BJ's more if it weren't in the mall.  Or, kind of in the mall.  Near the mall? You can't actually access the mall from the restaurant, you just have to concede all of the good parking spaces to people headed to Macy's. That said, they serve pretty good beer.  If you like beer, you should check it out.  Bearing in mind that it is a chain and they don't actually brew the beer on site, the beer that they truck in is quite tasty. I haven't tried their real food, but the apps are decent.  I thought the chicken lettuce wraps were a little too sweet for my tastes, but that didn't stop me from finishing them."
Keegan B.,"New Albany, IN",49,90,119,4.0,6/11/2012,"Draft Root Beer! The draft root beer and cream sodas alone have made this a place I feel compiled to come here. I finally got to try the Irish root beer I kept meaning too try. It's like dessert in a glass. Draft root beer, Jameson, irish cream and butterscotch. The small plate's portion of the menu is good if you want a light lunch or to sample different dish I recommend the mac and cheese. The draft sodas have no corn syrup on them. The food here is good and the drinks are phenomenal. I keep coming here for something light and there soda and it's worth it every time."
Brittany V.,"Calabasas, CA",2,13,2,3.0,1/3/2012,"I've had good experiences and bad. on the good side: I always brought out of town guests here. There something for everyone, and the food is dependable and enjoyable. My go to food choice is the Santa Fe salad with salmon. There's one steady server named Priscilla that's an excellent server. She works up by the bar if you can have a preference. on the bad side: the turnover is very high. It seems like there a new, inexperienced person struggling through their first day every time we step in. Carry out can be a blunder. After driving back twice with messed up orders, I had to be ""that guy"" and check the bags of food before payment after that. The micro-brew is well done, but never went there for just a beer. If you're not a Bro-skulling Cardinal or UK aligent, you'll start planning your dinners and drinks away from there when there are hot basketball games going on."
Mookie M.,"Louisville, KY",0,56,,4.0,5/13/2014,"Good bar food - nothing extraordinary but consistent and friendly service. Great burgers and beer, which is what you would expect here. We also love the corn fritter appetizer."
Tony R.,"Louisville, KY",223,160,147,4.0,5/20/2012,"Great for burgers, pizza, steaks and a great cold brew! Love location!"
Melody H.,"Cadillac, MI",72,21,,5.0,3/11/2012,"A fantastic chain restaurant.  We had an assortment of the small bites that included seared Ahi tuna, meatballs, Thai won-tons, and stuffed mushrooms.  Everything was high quality and all delicious.  The berry cider was perfect for the non beer drinker and the strawberry martini was too good to have liquor in it.  For dessert we had a Pazooki, fresh oven baked cookie topped with ice cream.  You have to get this if you come here."
Jaime H.,"Louisville, KY",0,23,1,2.0,2/15/2013,"I think the food is good, but they charge $4.50 for a bottle of Coors Light. Ridiculous. I should have looked at the beer list for prices, but never considered a domestic bottled beer would be that much. The Santa Fe salad is normally a little over $11, but I substituted the chicken with salmon. It ended up being $17 and they left off the avocado, corn, and cheese."
Edward R.,"Louisville, KY",20,68,12,2.0,7/9/2011,"terrible burger... obviously frozen pre-prep food served here. the service is good, very attentive.  it's in the mall, personally this is a drawback. if you don't cook and don't really understand food and good quality ingredients then this place will be great."
Jennifer S.,"O'Fallon, IL",23,24,,5.0,8/2/2014,"My husband, two children, and I were staying in Louisville for a couple nights on our way to Maryland. We got into our hotel and looked for a nearby restaurant that we could grab some takeout from to bring back since we had been driving a good portion of the day. We decided on BJ's restaurant, which was about 10 minutes from our hotel. My husband called and ordered the Scampi Pasta and Parmesan Crusted Chicken, which we split so we could both have a little bit of each. We also ordered the Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms and Santa Fe Spring Rolls for appetizers. Both our kids had the Macaroni and Cheese Kid's Meals. My husband said when he went to pick the food up, everyone there was very helpful and even offered to get him extra utensils and napkins since we were staying at a hotel. When he got back with the food, I couldn't believe the portions; they were huge! The Scampi Pasta and Parmesan Crusted Chicken were both excellent, as well as the White Cheddar Mashed Potatoes that came as a side with the chicken. The appetizers were delicious as well. I particularly liked the spring rolls with the avocado cream sauce. In all, it was a delicious and filling meal, and it was reasonably priced for a family of four and as much food as we received. I would definitely go back."
Ilana D.,"Louisville, KY",0,17,,4.0,5/22/2011,"Place is great. Has a good selection of draft beers, mixed drinks are great. Fish tacos are delish and I had a good experience several times I was there. Sometimes there is a problem with parking because it is located in the mall, but you can only enter restaurant from the street. It is a great place for Happy Hour."
