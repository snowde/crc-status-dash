Dawn M.,"Louisville, KY",29,14,2,5.0,4/4/2016,We planned a going away party for the GM of the restaurant that I work at last week. Amy set us up with a private room. They sure do know how to take care of parties! There were 40 of us celebrating. We had a great time with good service and everyone enjoyed the food.
Taryn M.,"Louisville, KY",193,132,49,5.0,7/25/2015,"BJs has an incredible menu, an awesome brew selection, and great atmosphere. This place never disappoints.  I have frequented this place often since moving to Louisville.  The menu is huge, think Cheesecake Factory's little brother huge, and there's a BJs brew or a cocktail for everyone. The Santa Fe Spring rolls are the best appetizer on the menu, although the avocado egg roles are great if you are an avocado lover like me. I have tried many things on the menu and have always been happy, but I especially like the chicken pita tacos and the Santa Fe salad. Be sure to allow yourself at some point during at least one visit to save room for a pizookie...those things are seriously to die for."
Nadia N.,"Miramar, FL",151,95,315,4.0,12/11/2014,"Came here for lunch after getting my car serviced. The place was packed! This was surprising since I come here often and always wondered why the place was dead an in such a prime location. Nevertheless, got my usual broccoli cheddar soup and decided to try something new for my entree. Not such a good idea. Got the scallop entree with asparagus. It was mediocre at best. The scallops were cooked well, but the preparation (read sauce and garnish) were not good. It would have fared much better if it was just grilled scallops, a light butter sauce and the veggies!  Anyhow, the food here has been relatively good since I started coming here. I know I will return because of their convenient location. Plus... they sell broccoli cheddar soup on a daily basis! The service has always been great, plus their happy hour isn't too shabby and starts earlier than most.  They also cater to large groups and families. For casual dining, I think its a great spot. Check it out if you have the chance!"
Brian J.,"Louisville, KY",13,131,3,1.0,4/6/2017,"Used to really like this place. Unfortunately food is very inconsistent. This past visit I ordered the light LEMON THYME CHICKEN. The chicken was unbelievably salty. I mentioned it to server and she apologized and offered to replace my meal. She came back 10 minutes later with one piece of chicken and said I was the 3rd customer to complain about this and that the kitchen staff thinks it's the marinade the chicken sits in. Wrong, the chicken she brought me was still salty. To make matters worse she never asked how the new piece was.  Needless to say not going to return with clients . This place needs to handle customers better . They were not even that busy around 130 . I did reach out to management/customer service online to no avail. To many good options in this area for this kind of food or service. Environment gets 2 stars , food  -1."
Darrell H.,"Louisville, KY",5,13,8,4.0,3/7/2016,"This is a good ""go to"" chain resturant. The food quality is what you would expect from a chain, but there are some advantages. They offer call ahead seating. My family rarely waits more than 10 (or less) minutes for a table of 4. They have an excellent selection of beer...not brewed on site. The kids can do whatever kids (teens) do in the malls while the adults catch up. There is a large selection on the menu. Service is generally good. Did I mention the good beer? Enjoy."
Pepper T.,"Lexington, KY",60,215,70,3.0,12/14/2014,"It's a chain restaurant attached to a mall, what could go wrong?  Honestly, it was  a solid inexpensive meal that I didn't have to fight to get to after Christmas shopping at the mall. I had the fish and chips.  Hot, crunchy and flavorful.  Waitress was friendly and I had refills galore!  She even asked if I wanted a to go cup.  I love her."
Tomorse M.,"Raleigh, NC",0,4,,5.0,7/1/2016,"Was in town visiting my father & decided to go to the mall to do some shopping, while shopping hunger it us so we venture off to find food. So we ran across BJ'S & the menu seem very interesting so we gave it a try. We decided to go with the 5 meat Chicago deep dish Pizza & it was an excellent choice, but they need to work on the strawberry beignet,wasn't sweet @ all! FYI the drink were on point,overall I would definitely come back to this place again."
Carly S.,"Louisville, KY",180,2,1,3.0,7/12/2016,I ordered a small pepperoni pizza for take out which was absolutely delicious! The reason I give it a 3 is because I also ordered a chocolate chip pizookie and it was almost black it was burned so bad. We didn't even eat it :(
Michael B.,"Panama City Beach, FL",79,7,,4.0,5/25/2016,Great food and great house beers. Nice little mid day break if you are looking for one in the St Matthew's area. Try the pulled pork sandwich very good. Go for the house beers cheaper and better than most places.
Kathy P.,"Louisville, KY",0,28,10,3.0,8/17/2016,"My daughter who is visiting from out of country and I stopped here for lunch. There was a short wait to get a booth but that was partly because I specially requested a booth due to a sore back. The booth was super comfy as was the waiting area. The menu is extensive with lots of yummy looking stuff on it. I ordered the bacon cheese burger with wedge fries (there are thin or wedge fries) and my daughter got the bacon ranch piadia with wedge fries. The fries were very good. The burger was cooked over a gas flame which was evident by the gas flavor through the whole burger. The fixings in the burger were fresh and generous.  The over all taste was however bland. The burger wanted to be good but it just did not make it.  A bit of seasoning may help. The homemade sodas are to kill for. I tried both the root beer and the cream soda. They are made with real sugar not high fructose syrup which I love. I don't normally drink sugar soda but this had me wanting more.  The server was a Wonderful Woman who worked hard to make my stay wonderful, she was the saving grace on the food.  The place has the potential to become very loud with little to no sound breaks in the room. The seating is comfortable and the area is nice to look at.  A lot of the food here is not all is home made. Which is nice The pizookies are awesome and even though it's not listed on the menu, you can buy a single Mini one for a small ( not so small) desert"
Joshua R.,"Philadelphia, PA",218,357,60,4.0,6/16/2015,"Nice chain, similar to a Buffalo wild wings, but a little less sports oriented with a better beer selection (including house beers). Nice, tasty bar food."
Priyanka G.,"Louisville, KY",0,13,9,4.0,2/8/2017,"The best part about this place is it's open till midnight. Very nice ambience. I had rasberry lemonade,deep dish pizza and some stuffed mushrooms.The mushrooms were well done."
Kevin I.,"Louisville, KY",3,33,22,5.0,8/11/2015,"This is a Great restaurant when your not sure what your in the mood for.  Tons of selections with decent prices.   I saw the mahi mahi blackened fish tacos and had to have em. Comes with tortilla chips and fire roasted salsa, perfect portion for lunch.   Great service, and the food was done fast!"
Bryan B.,"Louisville, KY",0,1,,2.0,8/7/2016,The avocado rolls were decent but the rest. ick...Service was a bit slow but friendly staff...
Lisa N.,"Chester, VA",1,46,,4.0,4/6/2016,Great beers and great food! My husband and I tried 4 different beers and had a steak and parmesan crusted chicken. Everything was delicious. The mashed potatoes were divine! Good service and reasonable prices. We were very happy with our choice!
Kathy V.,"Louisville, KY",256,1214,3651,4.0,11/2/2012,"Don't judge the restaurant by it's location. It's at the Oxmoor Mall. But it is better than most mall food I've ever had. Aside from our waitress being a bit absent-minded, it was a good dining experience. My friend and I shared the thai chicken wontons and gourmet mac & cheese as starters. Both were delicious. I decided to indulge in one of my guilty pleasures...cream soda! Also fantastic and well worth the extra calories! For my main meal, I got the shrimp tacos. I have had them here before and I love love LOVE them. I don't know what it is, but they are super. And unlike fish/seafood tacos at many other places, their shrimp tacos are not completely obscured by mounds and mounds of cabbage. They have a very Glodilock's-esque ""just right"" amount. A great dinner all around."
DuJuan B.,"Louisville, KY",9,5,1,4.0,6/12/2015,"My first time dining here. Very nice atmosphere, wonderful service, and great food. I had the calamari, pretty good for a restaurant that isn't ""seafood"" specific. Next a Cesar salad, a little heavy on the dressing but tasted fresh and was good overall. For the main course I had the grilled chops... awesome! Excellently prepared, the seasoning was dead on and the sides were perfect, a home run in my opinion. The waitress was very helpful in selecting a brew to accompany my meal. The harvest hefewezen was a hit light and hoppy but not over the top. Great first visit and I will be back.

Jen F.,"Borden, IN",2,42,40,5.0,5/28/2016,"I had Lauren as my waitress / server and she was one of the best. Super sweet and had very good timing as she walked by. I had the Avocado Egg Roll, which I give a thumbs up all except for the tiny facts that the texture may not be the most desirable and I didn't get a full avocado taste, but really thats just being picky...it was delicious and the sauce made it more like a desert! It went very well with the mojito with splash of cucumbers. If you're having to wait around at the mall, this is really the place to grab a lunch / cocktail. No regrets here!"
Stephanie S.,"La Grange, KY",119,108,98,4.0,3/26/2014,"I really enjoy the GF pizza!! The staff has always been sweet and accommodating, and the menu is pretty extensive.  Before I had to go GF I would frequent there with my friends for a beer and some spinach artichoke dip. Their beer list is pretty good, and the seasonal beers used to be my favorite!!  The Parmesan crusted chicken is so juicy and amazing, it tastes like you got it from an upscale Italian restaurant, not a BJs! This is one of my boyfriends favorite dishes there!"
Geekar L.,"Brooklyn, NY",86,320,1195,2.0,7/25/2012,"One star for the root beer and one star for an attempt to make things right with an unsatisfied customer. We came here to grab a ""small"" bite and we were seated very quickly. We were in a booth and there was a puddle of something on the seats so I just decided to scoot over it. The guy who seated us apologized for it, but he didn't bother to clean it up! After scooting over it, I ended up sitting on a bunch of crumbs...I was wearing shorts, major bummer.   Then, we went on to order our food: avocado egg rolls, spinach stuffed mushrooms, mini-bruschetta and fish tacos. Maybe we just ordered the wrong things or maybe it was an off night. The avocado egg rolls weren't bad, but part of the wrap was chewy, not exactly the best texture to go with avocado! The mushrooms were stuffed with spinach artichoke dip, breadcrumbs and cheese; they were okay, but they were served warm, not hot. The fish tacos were just alright. The mini bruschetta was the biggest disappointment of the night; the bread was hard, I couldn't even get through one piece. Our waiter spoke to the manager who took it off our bill and offered to make it for us again. I appreciated it, but I had enough for the night. I guess better luck next time, they do have a large menu selection!"
