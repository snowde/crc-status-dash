Kelly Y.,"Louisville, KY",88,290,1046,4.0,3/10/2012,"I hate the name; but love this place. What else can I say?  The marketing geniuses of this place summed it up in those two letters.  They accomplished the best a chain can:  cavernous, comfortale space; convenient location; big TVs; great drinks; giant menu offering quality and quantity of food...plus great service! I found the best turkey burger here!  It contains all of the stuff I love on a burger, none of the crap I usually have to pull out of other burgers.  Large, juicy turkey patty topped with melted Swiss, sautéed mushrooms, fresh(not previously frozen!) avocado slices...all of that on a soft multi-grain bun.  Mmmmmmm....turkey burger!  I did not even miss the beef when I eat this.  The patty is more wide than thick, has a sizable circumference to make my favorite part of a burger:  the patty over bun overhang!  My meal was not for the calorie counting crowd.  It came with crispy thin fries and I dipped them in a side of mayo...yum!  I had to try their wings, too.  Meh...I've had better.  In fact, the only thing memorable about those wings is their tiny size.  I remember thinking it was not worth the long plate they were presented on and the price tag. And if you don't like beer like me, try the Wyder's Pear Cider!  So good and so not like a beer!   BJ's has longer hours than your usual suburban place.  We finally found a place to go past 9PM here in the suburbs! Arghhhh, that name...it makes it really awkward for me to take anyone there b/w the ages of 10 and 25yro...But it really is good enough for 5 stars!"
Thao T.,"Louisville, KY",123,163,686,4.0,11/24/2013,"I promise I'm not a good snob! But I'm always skeptical of restaurants attached to a mall. So I added an extra star for the surprisingly good food and friendly atmosphere I found here. They got an extensive menu to satisfy the diverse taste preferences of a large party, the portions are large  for those who equate quantity to quality, and the food taste good (a bit better than the food you find at TGI Friday's, Applebee's, etc). Definitely above average chain eatery that's worth checking out for those nights when you don't feel so adventurous."
Ryan L.,"Louisville, KY",38,12,1,5.0,7/18/2015,"I'm usually reluctant to sit in a restaurant's bar area because I think the service has a higher risk of being terrible. This was not the case at BJs. My service was excellent, even in the bar area. BJ's has a massive menu that allows even picky eaters to find something they'll enjoy. I had a mini Bacon Chicken Ranch pizza. It was phenomenal. The pizza is so good it's hard to believe they aren't seen as a pizzeria. My friend got the shrimp scampi, again, and claims it to be the best in Louisville. I did have a Caesar salad that I thought was just okay - nothing super impressive. We ordered drinks. I got a BJ's mojito and it was delicious - I ordered a second one of those :) Drinks were prepared and served super fast! Not the cheapest place. $70 for 3 alcoholic drinks, Side Caesar, mini pizza and shrimp scampi and the tip but the great food and great service make the extra money worth it!"
Michelle C.,"Louisville, KY",145,133,215,4.0,8/30/2013,"My husband thinks that I'm pregnant, and after ordering a turkey burger and clam chowder I'm starting to think he's right. *runs and takes pregnancy test* Thank goodness, it's negative. But my combination of foods was pretty odd, however extremely satisfying. I wasn't feeling well tonight so the hubs offered to pick up some dinner here. I had a hard time deciding since their menu has a lot to offer but settled on the turkey burger and clam chowder. He left at 7 and didn't get back until 8:30, granted it was a Friday night and he could have sat at the bar and had a few beers, but j feel like it was a long time.  The turkey burger was pretty ok, good taste but didn't come with anything on it except lettuce (which was limp and I could have done without it) and cheese. Now the clam chowder (odd choice I know, especially since it's 90s outside) was delicious. Chunks of clams and potatoes, good seasoning, totally getting this again in the winter. Over all the food was good, and slow service might just be a husband error. I'd eat here again."
Lindsey Y.,"Louisville, KY",0,11,,3.0,3/25/2016,For a chain restaurant BJs is pretty good.. The beers are all great but the food is just alright.. Fun place to watch a game or get drunk while shopping at Oxmoor!
Dave S.,"Louisville, KY",0,4,,2.0,10/4/2016,"This has been one of my favorite places to grab a beer and dinner. Unfortunately, my last three visits have been quite underwhelming. The service has always been great and continues to be, but the management seems to be suffering. The beer from the tap has a sour taste to it, which in my opinion, is the result of the lines not being cleaned regularly. This is a new development as the beer is usually crisp and fresh. The kitchen has had several mechanical issues which have impacted guests experience to include the ovens not being operational which caused them to not be able to make 90% of the items on the menu. As a long time VIP patron, I'm hoping that management can make the necessary changes and return to the quality that used to be the norm."
Heather D.,"Louisville, KY",70,108,115,4.0,3/13/2015,"Oh chain-y chain restaurants. Here we are again. I don't really like to review them because if you've been at one, you've been at them all. I realize BJ's is a chain but I have to give this one credit: they do their cookin' right. Decor is pretty standard for a higher quality chain. Nice tables and booths. A prominent bar area. They have an entrance from inside the mall and from the outside. Hostess area is usually ""manned"" near the outside entrance. You know what's cool about this place? Gluten-free options. Yeah, yeah I know, you're sick of hearing that term -- but some of us have inflammatory stomach diseases. So here it is again. GLUTEN-FREE. PIZZA. The best part? It tastes awesome and is cooked well. Also: the gluten-free skillet cookie/ ice cream dessert is to die for. In fact, I think I know where I'm going to eat tomorrow. To my Sweet-tea connoisseurs -- the tea here will not disappoint! It's got a decent fresh-brewed taste and it's pretty reliable from visit to visit. I haven't really ever had a bad meal here. My only problem? - 1 star for unpredictable service! Ouch! I've had some loooong wait times just to get a howdy-do for a beverage before. We almost walked out a couple of times. Be prepared to wait and for possible lackluster service if you come near dinner time.  However, usually great service and a great date spot if you come during slow hours."
Luke S.,"Louisville, KY",16,5,,4.0,3/23/2016,"I love this place. It's one my favorite places for pizza in town so far plus their selection of house beers is awesome. Growlers! Great atmosphere too. The only downside is that they are always packed so expect a wait of usually at least 20 minutes depending on time of day. The fact that it's at the Oxmoor Mall doesn't help either, but I'd say it's a bit more accessible than the St. Matthews mall."
Ashley D.,"Louisville, KY",374,220,185,2.0,7/16/2015,"I have no problems with the food at BJ's. I actually really enjoy it, but the service is abysmal. I hate to write negative reviews, however it's sometimes unavoidable. I have been to BJ's a number of times with varying table sizes and at different occupancies. This week two other Yelp Elites and I went to BJ's for half price wine night after a workout class. It was very crowded. Our server came and asked if we knew what we wanted. At the time we just asked for waters. When she came back (after about 7 minutes) she brought waters and took our wine orders. It took forever for the wine to arrive and my water sat empty the whole time. Once we got the waters, we ordered our dinner. I asked if I could get one of the quinoa bowls listed on the menu without meat, since I am a vegetarian. She said I could, but they would charge me for the meat. I told her I did not want to pay for salmon or chicken if I wasn't eating it and she said she'd ask the kitchen and come back with an answer. It took about 10 minutes for her to come and tell me they would adjust the price of the quinoa bowl and serve it without meat. During that time she went to several other tables and checked on them, while I still had no water. The quinoa bowl was good and the wine was a great deal, but I will avoid going back to BJ's for a while because the service was so bad. I know it's hard to be a server because I've worked in restaurants and I know they were very busy that night, but it doesn't make up for the way she treated me like a nuisance."
Marvin C.,"Fargo, ND",50,14,1,5.0,2/16/2016,"The food was great and the atmosphere is better. The food was wonderful. You could tell that the group that work there don't just work there. When I eat, I want to enjoy the food and where I am eating it. BJ's excelled at both."
Donna F.,"Louisville, KY",0,3,,2.0,8/12/2016,What a disappointment!  Service was poor. Our server was very slow in bringing sugar for tea and refills. I asked for ice which I never received. We ordered an appetizer we never received.  My daughters meal came very late. The server said someone else took it yet it was not taken off our bill. My husband and I each ordered a build your own pizza. They were awful. We each paid for 3 extra ingredients. We received mainly bread with chopped tomatoes and cheese. The ingredients we paid extra for were basically nonexistent. There were slices of pizza that didn't have any of the extras. All in all a great disappointment. Not worth the wait or the money.
Trevor W.,"Wiesbaden, Germany",13,98,135,3.0,8/29/2014,"Was shopping at the mall and decided to stop in for lunch.  They appearantly have an app so you can order ahead and even save your place in line for a reservation.  Being a ""brew house"" I ordered a black and tan.  I described it to the waiter as being floated with a spoon and he said yes that is how it is done. So I ordered it.  My Black and Tan arrived and it was not floated just mixed together.  I pointed this out and the waiter said it just mixes that way.   ok...    We ordered the Frito Nachos as an app.  I ordered the lunch special with a Flatbread pizza and the salad. California Club and normal vinaigrette salad. My fiancé ordered the pasta lunch special with soup.  Spaghetti with clam chowder.   The Frito Nachos app was tasty but something we could easily make at home. The clam chowder was surprisingly good for a non seafood style restaurant.  Our waiter gained some points back from the beer confusion by bringing a box (as it was too much food for us)  and the check without asking.  Overall the food was good, service was polite and friendly, and the atmosphere was pleasant.  If I was in the mall and in the mood for a beer I would stop in again.  FYI - They have a military discount."
David C.,"Louisville, KY",2,13,2,5.0,7/30/2015,"I love this place, their food is always fantastic, service is typically on par, and the beer is always cold. I've had a variety of items off the menu and have yet to find something I didn't enjoy. Especially love their pizzas and burgers."
Daphne A.,"Lexington, KY",194,54,67,5.0,2/4/2014,"I normally wouldn't give a chain restaurant a 5 star rating, but I've just had such a good experience at this BJs.  Both when I was actively counting calories and most recently trying to go without gluten, BJs just happen to be able to accommodate me.  The restaurant has a versatile and lengthy menu, but seems to do it right. They carry gluten free pizza crust, gluten free beer, AND A GLUTEN FREE PIZOOKIE.  SAY WHAT!?!?!?!?  Yummo.  Not a lot of other options - but I'm seriously not going to complain. They also have house brewed root beer, cream soda, blackcherry soda, and one other one (sorry its escaping me).   I think BJs will please the whole family and give you that quality you're looking for without inflated prices."
Zach J.,"Louisville, KY",0,21,1,5.0,8/25/2015,The place to eat! I had the margarita pizza and highly suggest it to anyone in the area. Can be busy in the evenings.
Britany G.,"Louisville, KY",3,19,2,3.0,6/14/2014,"I've had excellent appetizers and burgers here, but was quite disappointed with the angel hair pasta. Drinks are very over priced. Service is decent.  I would go again if someone else picked the place, but it is not on my regular list."
Erynn C.,"Louisville, KY",34,16,17,1.0,5/16/2015,"If I could give BJ's no stars I would. The only reason they are getting one star is because their fried artichokes were on point today! Our waitress, she should find another job, this one isn't working out for her. The food was wrong consistently and the pizza I ordered was under cooked and cold. The runner then insisted on yelling at us for not have a pizza stand, like we should have brought one ourself? They seem to be off all around with wait staff and kitchen staff. We came here today, 5/16/15 to celebrate a high school graduation."
Josh M.,"Louisville, KY",112,10,2,1.0,5/30/2015,My wife and I had time to kill so we went here for a quick bite to eat.  After sitting in a bar booth for 10 minutes and at least three servers walking by making eye contact but not engaging us we left!  Maybe the food is good but a quick hey we will be right with is all I needed.  Thanks for not even noticing while we sat there.  Btw a server talked to the table directly behind me and looked at us and said nothing
Amy S.,"Louisville, KY",79,65,165,4.0,3/17/2014,"Great seasonal menu. I enjoy the change. Love the stuffed mushrooms, ribeye and the pizzokie. Don't forget dessert!"
Erin K.,"Louisville, KY",118,165,40,5.0,4/11/2013,"I love BJ's Brewhouse.  Yes, it's a little pricy but the food is always very good.  The menu is extensive and has something for everyone.  Their craft beers are excellent as well and they have a great happy hour.  Whenever we are waffling over where to eat we always come to BJ's and are never disappointed."
