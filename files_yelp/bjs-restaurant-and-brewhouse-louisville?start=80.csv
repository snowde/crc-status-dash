Elden F.,"Jeffersonville, IN",6,8,,4.0,8/22/2015,"We've been here once before, but at the Ohio location. This was our first experience at the Louisville location. When we walked in, the hostess asked us how many, and we told her two. She then directed us to stand by a sign about five feet away while she collected the menus. I thought that was odd and felt more like a child lining up for recess instead of waiting for someone to take me to my table. The server got our drink order pretty quickly but then took awhile to come back to the table to take our order. When she finally did, she promptly put it in the computer. Our food came out quickly and everything was right. The only problem was the our server didn't check on us until we were almost done. We needed some napkins and water and it would have been nice if she was more attentive. The food was excellent. My wife got the Mediterranean Chicken Tacos and I got the Pesto Chicken Sandwich. We will go back because the food was good, but the service was not something to brag about."
Matt M.,"Pikeville, KY",0,6,2,4.0,4/25/2015,"Broad array of choices on the menu.  This is a must if you are hungry at the Oxmor Mall.  Food is good and very kid friendly menu.  We've eaten several times.  Typically don't make a trip but if in area, yes!"
Colin C.,"Louisville, KY",0,13,,4.0,2/20/2015,"BJ's has never been the first restaurant that jumps to mind in a restaurant packed section of Shelbyville Road, but I'm never disappointed when I eat here. The menu is expansive, much like a Cheesecake Factory type menu, and the price per plate is under $12 (generally) which is nice. The parmesan crusted chicken with mashed potatoes is by far my favorite dish. Very filling and a great combination of flavors with the chicken, lemon, and broccoli. I've also tried the Barbeque Bison burger on their enLIGHTened menu and it actually gave the parmesan crusted chicken a run for its money. Long story short, the food is varied and generally very good. They also brew their own beer and I have never heard any complaints about any of them. I prefer the Hefe and Oasis Amber. Lots of TVs and a casual atmosphere."
Andy T.,"Fort Knox, KY",50,4,1,1.0,2/2/2014,"Place is nice, food is awesome... But service sucked..

I wouldnt go back anytime soon.."
Chip D.,"Louisville, KY",85,3,,2.0,3/2/2015,"The food was just ok...nothing special.  The service was extremely slow and our waitress was not very attentive.  Granted, the place was packed the entire time I was there.  I don't feel the need to go back any time soon."
Stephanie S.,"Louisville, KY",36,30,16,5.0,12/11/2014,"I sit here trying to think of any negative comments to say and I cannot think of any! I've gone here on many girls nights and date nights and we have never experienced a problem. Staff and food is always good. Well one tip I could give, sit at the bar table area for happy hour or else you don't get the special. I would also recommend the avocado rolls."
Mark B.,"Louisville, KY",2,14,6,4.0,1/14/2015,I got take out the other day and was really surprised by how great and fresh their fish tacos where! i will definitely be going back for more soon!
Sam M.,"Westminster, MD",0,5,1,2.0,2/15/2014,"Why does it take 45 minutes for a four person table with no one waiting?? Then when ordering , everyone else gets beverages, but two people at my table.  Why are Louisville restaurants on a such a poor service kick?"
Nora L.,"New York, NY",56,111,19,3.0,8/24/2013,"Decent chain restaurant but nothing special.  I've tried the thai chicken mango salad (though at a different BJs) and the avocado egg rolls (recommend!). The salad comes in a big portion with a good amount of chicken, though not much mango. I've also tried a mojito here as well.. it was okay.  The service wasn't the best. Our server gave us all our checks even though some people weren't halfway through their food yet.  I'd recommend for drinks since there is a nice beer selection, along with happy hours.. but overall, just feels like a typical chain restaurant."
James G.,"Centerville, OH",29,183,,5.0,6/9/2013,"If you come through the entrance from inside the mall, you're led through a long hallway that makes you think twice about eating here.  But then you turn the corner and you realize the main entrance is off the street, and the place is really nice.  As in fancy.  Prices to match.  But damn, the food and the beer are both awesome, and the service was exceptional too.  Wife got a little too excited for her French Dip sandwich, saying it was the best she's ever had.  Kid's chicken fingers were good too, and my Jalapeno Burger was spot-on.  The amber summer beer was smooth and so was the Blonde.  If you're looking for something a little more upscale, this is definitely a great place."
Shayla F.,"New Albany, IN",101,23,11,5.0,7/11/2014,"I normally can't stand chain restaurants, but this place has some pretty good food. Probably one of the best burgers I have had in the area, and the deep dish pizza is great as well. Pizza does not come with a lot of sauce (if that's your thing), but the toppings are so good. The menu is extensive so plenty to choose from."
Adam R.,"Chicago, IL",180,67,37,4.0,10/9/2010,"I dined there for my birthday meal. My brother and I shared the avocado egg rolls.  They are so unique and amazing.  A must order.  I had the lunch portion of a half sandwich and half wedge salad.  Surprisingly, the sandwich still came with the fries.  The sandwich was a California club with mozzarella cheese and avocados and a spicy mayonnaise.  My pops enjoyed his cal-zone.  My brother and mom both had the grilled cheese and tomato soup.  My brother commented that he would have preferred that the cheese be better melted. Although everyone was happy with the pizzooki.  I choose the white Macedonian nut cookie with vanilla bean ice cream.  The cookie was hot and gooey.  The ice cream melted nicely on top of the cookie.  Spoons were clanking against one another as everyone tried to sneak a bite in.   A great time"
Frances R.,"Louisville/Jefferson County, KY",0,12,10,4.0,8/11/2010,"Love this place! Shrimp skewers. Stir fry shrimp. Fish tacos. So far I have several wonderful experiences here.  My sister in law and I were looking for another lunch place when she spotted BJ's. Nice facade and the inside did not disappoint. Complete with televisions if you are interested in a game or five, a well spaced bar so no one is sitting on top of you, and a well presented menu complete with delicious choices and tasty alternatives.  New? The hostess will escort you to your seat and give you the rundown. Veteran, there is open seating and you can select wherever you wish. For my first choice I selected the Hawaiian skewers which consisted of delicately cut  red bell peppers, onions, pineapple, and very well selected shrimp that was flavorable and lightly seasoned. It was accompanied by sticky rice with sesame seeds. Yum! It was so good I had it yesterday and today! Get this! It was a 3.95 appetizer and seemed like it should have cost so much more! For my entree, I ordered shrimp stirfry. The teriyaki sauce really made this dish and the portion was enough to enjoy without hurting your wallet or your diet.  For today I had the fish tacos. Told that they were the waitress's favorite, I really looked forward to an awesome meal. I have returned several times since these earlier visits and have never been disappointed."
Steven S.,"Louisville, KY",2,65,,4.0,9/25/2015,One of the most underrated restaurants in Louisville! In a lot of ways their menu is better than Cheesecake Factory's. Great service and beautiful environment...definitely give this place a try!
Shal V.,"Louisville, KY",32,192,47,5.0,8/19/2012,"Went to this unfortunately-named restaurant around 9pm last night for an impromptu date night after an evening of shopping at Oxmoor Mall. As soon as we walked in, I was struck by the ambience that melds a stylish design with a sports bar feel while not being kitschy in any way. They have a deceptively large seating area but tables are adequately spaced apart so you don't have to worry about inadvertently jabbing the person in the adjacent table in the eye with a fork or listen to some garrulous old crank bloviating about something (although in this case, you may feel the urge to wield your silverware as a weapon).  We started with the Chicken Wonton appetizer (Filled with marinated chicken and cream cheese, lightly battered and fried) - you can get them Buffalo or Thai style. We got the Buffalo-style, which means they serve it with Buffalo sauce and Ranch dressing. Muy delicioso!! My wife ordered the Grilled Burger Melt (a half-pound Angus burger, grilled to order, topped with cheddar & Swiss cheeses, caramelized onions and BJ's special burger sauce on grilled sourdough bread) - she loved it. I had the utterly scrumptious Black and Blue Burger (1/2 pound blackened Angus patty with a melted creamy bleu cheese topping, crispy Applewood smoked bacon, roasted garlic aioli and tomatoes), which was easily one of the best burgers I've eaten in eons!! I can't stop raving about it - cooked and seasoned to perfection, with the delightfully succulent combination of blue cheese and garlic aioli perfectly complementing the flavor.  Samantha's service was exceptional too! She was prompt, friendly, had an exuberance that was charmingly infectious, and she was candid when giving us her recommendations. As I've stated in previous reviews, I try to avoid chain restaurants as much as I can but our dining experience at BJ's on Saturday night was stellar!! Every time I'm at Oxmoor Mall, it will be hard to resist the enticing siren call of BJ's."
David A.,"Louisville, KY",3,51,,3.0,1/28/2014,"Sleek decor, extensive menu, and solid in-house beer list make this place an excellent drop in from time to time. You could sum up everything with 'pretty good'. There's nothing particularly awesome here but everything is pretty good. The highlight is the broad spectrum of selection from menu and everything is solid, not spectacular. The only real issue I had here...the service. Now, I'm rarely one to use service against a place. Having been a server for a long time, I know there are a lot of reasons a server can be busy and appear un-attentive. I am more forgiving of this than most. But on the most recent visit, the service was just plain bad. The restaurant was pretty busy, not packed, but busy. It took about 15 minutes to be greeted once we were at our table and then another 15 minutes to get our water...I don't remember how long it took to get the beer but I think we had to set up a tent for the night and get it in the morning. The food, that didn't come for 3-5 days later I don't think.  I only knock this down to a 3 star, but for some people the service would have been a dealbreaker. So use this as a word of caution, if you are in a hurry on a Friday or Saturday night or you are just one of those people that is really particular about this sort of thing you might want to avoid BJ's Brewhouse except at some off-hour on a weekday. Because I sense that when they get even a little busy this place grinds to a halt."
Jordan P.,"Louisville, KY",33,56,7,4.0,8/1/2011,"After I check my diet at the door, I always have a great time at BJ's, especially if there's a big game on. The TV at the bar is massive! Four out of the five times I've been to BJ's, I've had the buffalo chicken pizza. It is fabulous. The perfect combination of flavors. I always leave that place beyond stuffed! I can't even remember exactly what I had the other time -- but I've never left disappointed, so I know it wasn't anything to complain about. I not a beer drinker, but I always find myself studying the unique beer menu offered a BJ's. I pick a different one out for my boyfriend every time we go. Harvest Hefeweizen. Nutty Brewnette. Love those names! Even when the place isn't packed with people I still love the atmosphere. The huge, round booth are extra comfy. If the house isn't full, they'll sit you in one of them with a small party. Feels like you have your own little private corner of the restaurant."
Tom C.,"Louisville, KY",91,106,67,4.0,4/20/2011,"Ode to the Boys of Summer BJ's is in a mall-strike one. BJs is a chain-strike two. BJs has friendly and attentive servers Jessica,Kimberly,Heather-base hit. BJs has a nice assortment of handcrafted beers and great selection of other beers on tap and by the bottle-another base hit,two bases occupied. Happy Hour $1 off great beers, $2 off appetizers(big enough to share), half off mini-pizzas-another base hit,bases loaded. Not having someone to share the Happy Hour-error on my part,Grand Slam! BJs is a super place to go for Happy Hour.Nice Art Deco design,friendly staff,really good mini-pizzas and appetizers. I'm going to take Mister sometime to see what a true critic thinks of BJs."
Mark W.,"Seattle, WA",38,124,311,4.0,6/13/2013,"This place has gotten better. I've been here a few times and in the past it's a been good enough place to meet and has a good bar/restaurant layout, but the food has been average at best. This last time, i ventured into the ""deep dish"" pizza. Having fresh skepticism, being from Chicago, I was impressed. It's certainly not Chicago style, but it's very nicely pan crust, deeper dish pizza. I thought it was a great balance of flavors and none too overpowering - BJ's Italian special is the way to go."
Kellyo O.,"Prospect, KY",201,512,1121,4.0,4/30/2013,"First off: the parmesan crusted chicken and it was FABULOUS! Fun place and good food. Went with my family and the first thing I noticed was that BJ's was right next to Dick's. Seriously? What genious planned that layout? Since I am really a 13 yr old boy underneath, I was chuckling pretty hard and trying not to let it show so I didn't get 80 questions from the kids. The only two bad points that I am going to point out to get out of the way is that my dad, who walks with a cane, thought the floor was wet and about had a panic attack walking out of the revolving door. (PS - DO NOT let your kids follow your father through the revolving door. While he is holding the door for stability as he is testing the floor with his cane to see if it is drenched with water the youngin's will PUSH with all their might to make that door keep revolving. Bad things can happen and as funny as it looks from the outside - sorta like a Three Stooges comedy routine - it is not funny when you find out the back story.) Anyway, after making it past the incredibly WET LOOKING floor that is really just 100 gallons of shellac, you get to be seated in a gigantic room. Which brings up my second issue - try not to be seated under the big air blowers, they get kind of cold. On to the good stuff! Mom and I had the parmesan crusted chicken and it was FABULOUS! Hubby had the avacado egg rolls & he thought they were good and daughter had the calamari which she deemed ""pretty good"". She just eats calamari when we go out so she's had lots! My dad had the pot roast and potatoes which I am guessing were fantastic since they lasted about 5 seconds on his plate. I also ordered the Harvest Hefeweizen which I thought was tasty. I will be back to try some of their other brews."
