Donna B.,"Albuquerque, NM",14,53,19,4.0,9/4/2017,In Lubbock for the evening. We had the jambalaya and it was excellent. It was recommended by the bartender. Good choice! The rolls were amazing! Nice house salad. My husband would have liked more dressing but I was good with how it was. . Good wine list and beer. We sat at the bar and Harley waited on us. She was excellent!!
Michael C.,"Lubbock, TX",142,275,346,3.0,8/27/2017,"Flat bread pizza with bacon, jalapenos, and pineapple: The spicy pig was great.  Especial with queso to dip the crust in.  Monkey bread with ice cream for desert to completely overwhelm my blood sugar.  Lots of menu choices and a well run kitchen.  Almost anyone should be able to find something they like on the menu. Our server ""Sway"" was on day three and it showed, no deduct there."
Rob J.,"Odessa, TX",1222,345,130,2.0,9/2/2017,The two stars are for the waitress we had :) she was super cool. The drinks were good. The food had to be taken back twice. Which I hate Doug to waitresses. But a steak that was ordered medium well and came out rare them bid rare the second time switched my order to a burger which the manager said he would take care of. We paid it. He didn't take it off....smh... The baked ziti was really good tho...stay away from the steaks
Johanna K.,"Lubbock, TX",240,42,10,2.0,6/9/2017,"BJ's is one of those places I want to love, but the service and quality make it really difficult. The menu has much to offer, but unfortunately all the entrees I've had fell short. Even their ""famous"" pizookies fell flat for me.  Aside from the food being subpar the service is not great either. Multiple times that I've eaten here I've had very slow service, and also impolite service.  Go down just a bit and eat at Chuy's or Longhorn. Much better food."
Tim B.,"Lubbock, TX",36,10,2,4.0,2/13/2017,"Went here as a sorta Valentine's dinner with my wife (and toddler son). It was a Saturday night, and amazingly we snagged a short wait. The waiter did an average job. Nothing above or below board. My wife often likes to ask wait staff their opinions between two dishes before ordering. This waiter happened to be like me, and just doesn't like seafood, so he couldn't give a recommendation, and my wife went with a steak dish instead. I had the BBQ Bacon Brisket burger. I asked for a well done cook, and I got a medium well. Still good, but for a notorious texture eater, that is pushing it. I also replaced my fries with a fresh tomato and mozzarella salad. That was probably the best part of my meal. While I know it is a corporate mandate, they might want to think about removing the butter lettuce from the presentation. To me, butter lettuce is the second most useless eatable garnish. Hopefully the waiter we had will think about when some asks for a drink to go and a to go box, he might want to go ahead and bring the check next time as well. Common sense to me, but who knows, he might have needed that one spelled out. Happens."
Grace H.,"Norcross, GA",1,14,39,3.0,5/13/2017,Great atmosphere with mediocre food. Had the chicken blt with fries. It was supposed to have avocado in it but it had only one strip of avocado. Probably will be back just for the atmosphere!
Tara B.,"Lubbock, TX",73,247,131,3.0,2/14/2017,"We came here Saturday night. We only had to wait about 10 minutes. I was on the fence between the steak and seafood tacos. The waiter (never got his name) said he didn't like seafood, so he couldn't offer his opinion. I went ahead with the steak, ordered medium. I should have gone with the tacos. There was seasoning on the outside of the steak, it was almost well done, and very dry. I would have asked for A1 but he didn't come back. The mashed potatoes were good and the Caesar salad was excellent. Would I go back? Yes, but I wont order the steak. Bleh. Great potential, its a clean, classy restaurant."
Shimmy G.,"Lubbock, TX",26,70,164,4.0,7/9/2017,"I don't usually eat at chain restaurants, but when I do, it's BJ's. I first fell in love with BJ's when I lived in Gainesville, FL. So I was quite happy when I discovered that Lubbock had one as well. (Clearly I don't get out much.) Authenticity and consistency are the most important components of any brand and based on a culmination of all of my visits, the brand of BJ's would be great service, great place to watch the game, good beer, and good food. And the BJ's in Lubbock stays true to that. It started with the bartender who was great and the quality of food that we have come to expect. We got to watch a University of Florida softball game on the big screen per request and then came back the next day to watch the NBA Finals. I like the fact that I can get brussel sprouts as an appetizer and a delicious ahi tuna salad at a chain restaurant. I know every place has their ""healthy choices"" menu but for some reason, I just feel like it's actually health-IER at BJ's than at an Applebees or Chilis. (Oh my goodness, that sounded really snobby.) There are a lot of great independently owned restaurants in Lubbock but if you feel the need for something comfortable, I'm pretty sure BJ's will welcome you with open arms."
John S.,"Lubbock, TX",132,19,15,1.0,10/14/2016,"Shame on you if you are eating here.  Seriously.  Lubbock is filled with amazing local hardworking people who care about this town and their craft.  BJ's spits in the face of that. I've been here two times, the first time I went was when it first opened and the second time was against my will with friends.  First, the big lie that they don't tell you up front is that the beer is made nowhere near here.  GO TO JJJ's INSTEAD IF YOU WANT THAT.  Second, the menu is ridiculously priced.   Last, the food blows."
Jessica S.,"League City, TX",7,46,6,4.0,5/5/2017,"I have been to this location twice and both times were with a large group. The first time I went was for a bachelorette party. We made reservations ahead of time and were seated quickly. The menu has a variety of delicious looking entrées that makes it very hard to choose from. After much debate, I decided to get a flatbread pizza. The pizza was very delicious! The crust was thin and crispy the way I like it! A few of the other girls in my group got the deep dish pizza. Personally, I would recommend their pizzas because there is a different type of pizza for everyones' taste buds;however, they are a bit pricy in my opinion. The second time I went was for a birthday party. This time we didn't have a reservation so we had to wait about an hour until the big table they were planning to seat us at opened up. While we waited, we got drinks at the bar. My friend and I got the Irish root beer, first time to try this for the both of us. We both enjoyed it, you can definitely taste the root beer with a slight hint of alcohol, which is how I like my drinks! It was definitely a little pricy, but it was a big glass! As for food, I was debating between the bison burger (recommended by my friend) and the BJ's Brewhouse Burger. I went with the BJ's Brewhouse Burger and it was a great choice! The burger was bigger than my hand and half of my plate was filled up with French fries! The price for the burger was reasonable given my serving size. I think the service here is great. We were greeted as soon as we walked in both times and were seated as quickly as possible. The waiters were personable and attentive to our needs. The environment is very relaxing and intimate. I would definitely come back here for another special occasion!"
Maddie O.,"Lubbock, TX",0,1,,5.0,11/23/2017,"our server Michael has impeccable service, his suggestions were amazing!! fast service with a welcoming smile!! the strawberry patch, a drink he recommended, was to die for!! great conversationalist, knows great places in lubbock, Michael will take care of you!! ask for him!!!"
Brennan M.,"Lubbock, TX",67,15,3,1.0,9/4/2016,"My boyfriend and I came here since I'd never been before and he'd been to one back in Dallas. The service was somewhere near terrible. I've worked in a similar style restaurant and to me it felt like it was everyone's first day, I even heard the staff arguing. The food took too long to come out and my fries were cold and I got Pickens even though I asked for none. I'll probably never come to BJs again, especially not this one.  Update: it also ended up making both of us very sick. I feel like I've been cheated out of my money, especially since all the other tables around us got free dessert but we didn't??"
Hillary B.,"Jayton, TX",1,35,,4.0,6/27/2017,"We are BJ premiere members.  We love the food, the atmosphere, and the drinks.  I will say though, lately, the service has been VERY SLOW.  I would give more stars if the service was better; however, it has declined over the last two years; before that, it was always satisfactory.  This is a great place to catch a game as well--nice 4 screen TV that accommodates many tastes."
Andrew M.,"Anaheim, CA",4,8,,5.0,3/13/2017,"I am surprised at all the negative reviews on here.  I came here around 6 PM today.  There weren't too many people in the restaurant, but the service was excellent!  Our waitress, I believe her name was Stephanie, was extremely friendly to us.  You don't see that very often these days.  We ordered the calamari appetizer and it was great as well.  I ordered the salmon and it was cooked to perfection.  I've been to BJ's in California a lot and the food is very good, but the servers are not friendly.  This place seems to have both!"
Melissa B.,"Bartlett, IL",12,257,,5.0,1/30/2017,"I realize that outside of the Chicago area, it is sometimes hard to find good food.  Well BJ's rivaled any good Chicago restaurant!  The Bloody Mary was phenomenal, extra spicy, which is the only way they should be in my opinion.  Also enjoyed a tasty and not all watered down whiskey drink.  I chose an arugula/beet/goat cheese salad because I knew I needed some veggies in my day, as well as salmon with couscous and asparagus for my entrée.  SOOOOOO GOOD.  I loved that they had these healthy vegetarian options.  A bit pricy but if the food and drinks are that good I don't mind.  Good job BJ's!!"
Keith L.,"Lubbock, TX",91,140,19,4.0,1/23/2016,"Menu provides plentiful selections. My family of 6 had chicken tenders (2), pulled pork sandwich, California club, seafood tacos and hickory brisket and bacon sandwich. All were satisfied with the taste, temperature and portion size. We shared several different flavors of Pizookies, cookies served in a pan ala mode...arguably the tastiest dessert in town!  Our waiter was fantastic...thank you for the super friendly and attentive service, Marvin!"
Mike R.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,53,9,4.0,6/1/2017,"Good: Always good food. Easy to find healthy food to eat. Great atmosphere with a lot of TVs playing sports. Huge menu and never been disappointed by my choice Bad: small portions and slightly overpriced. Overall: if you don't mind spending $12-$20 per person, you won't be disappointed here. Very reliable restaurant."
Danielle K.,"New Orleans, LA",675,144,80,5.0,3/30/2016,"This place is great.  The beer they brew is fantastic, making Lubbock way more posh than it was before they brewed their own beer.  If you're a fan of wheats like me, try the Hefeweisen.  It's unique but will still satisfy your wheat craving.  The fruity berry beer is good too.  You can see the brewing cannisters in the back.  They offer a variety of food.  I tried my fiance's burger meat and it was good.  I recommend the avocado egg rolls and the fried artichokes.  They also have soups in bread bowls which I plan on getting the next time I come around."
Mandy M.,"Lubbock, TX",323,39,11,1.0,3/7/2016,"The only reason to come here is for a pizookie. The food is way over priced for what it is. It's just not very good. If you're gonna go, eat dinner somewhere else & head over for dessert."
Jack W.,"Katy, TX",168,23,11,5.0,10/14/2016,You really can't beat the pizookies!! It's a great place to go in Lubbock for birthdays and I like their large selection of beer
C V.,"Weatherford, TX",0,2,,1.0,10/21/2016,"Being from out of town and looking for a place with a decent-sized menu, I decided on BJ's. I have been to the BJ's in Dallas and Corpus, and have had some pretty fair meals and service at them. That was not my experience in Lubbock tonight. To begin, the hostess was not friendly at all, and acted like she really didn't even want to be there. It was a chore asking me a few questions and handing me a pager. Seating and the initial encounter with the server were standard, not much different than anywhere else. I ordered an appetizer (ahi poke) and an entree (chargrilled mahi mahi tacos), along with a glass of water and an Oktoberfest beer, recommended by the server.  The water and beer were fine. Even though I ordered the ahi as an appetizer, it was almost immediately followed by the entree; I'm talking maybe a minute--I hadn't even had time to try the ahi yet. Unfortunately, the ahi was borderline inedible; while red, the texture & mouth-feel were just off, and there was a slight fishy taste. Either it was previously frozen and/or was on the verge of turning bad. I am still hoping I don't get sick... The two mahi tacos were not any better. There was hardly any mahi at all, and it certainly was not chargrilled. No marks, no charred flavor, nothing. In fact, the mahi had absolutely no flavor whatsoever. One of the pieces of fish in one of the tacos was completely inedible, sort of a fatty/rubbery gristle. Both tacos were cold--not room temperature, not lukewarm, but cold. Both tortillas were hard as a rock; in fact, I ate what little I could out of them with a fork and set the tortillas, which looked like rigor mortis had set in, aside on my ahi plate. During the meal, my server, in passing, asked if I needed anything (I didn't),but never asked how the meal was, or whether there was anything wrong with the meal, as I am sure she saw the tortillas discarded like the cardboard they were. Maybe she already knew enough not to ask... At that point, I just wanted to get away from the environment that was making me very frustrated, as I had eaten very little all day and I had been looking forward to a decent supper. However, the server who had been around when she wasn't needed was no longer anywhere to be found. When she did pass by, I asked for the check. She returned fairly quickly but, while I had my credit card in hand ready to immediately give it to her, she, without breaking stride, set it down on the table and continued walking. Even more frustrated, I jumped up, went to the hostess counter, and asked where I could pay. I was told I needed to pay my server. I started to explain when my server walked up and set down whatever it was she had in her hands. I followed her to the register, paid, and then got the hell out of there as fast as I could. Needless to say, I will not be going back to that location again. I was really hoping that, because of their menu, it might be a go-to place when you're not sure what you want or you're with a group and everyone wants something different--pizza, burger, pasta, fish, etc. While the menu does not begin to rival say Cheesecake Factory, it does offer a variety not typically found in many Lubbock restaurants. And while I am from out of town, I do come to Lubbock with some regularity. Of course, it may not have helped that I had just flown in from the Northeast and, having been in an environment where the food industry is not just a job but in many cases a career, and people in general demand a certain level of attentiveness and service in exchange for their hard-earned money, perhaps BJ's was already at a disadvantage. I recommend you save your hard-earned money and spend it somewhere other than BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse in Lubbock."
Chris C.,"Lubbock, TX",14,4,3,1.0,8/6/2016,"Been a while since my fiancé and I have been to BJs, so with it being late we decided ""Hey, let's grab a big chicken Caesar salad and a chicken club sandwich"" since we didn't want anything heavy. Used the BJs app to order to-go and time was set for food to be ready at 11pm.  Got to the restaurant at 1055pm under the impression that our food should be waiting on the counter like any other takeout food that's been ordered for a certain time. Walk in and there are 3 waiters/waitresses standing in the takeout area using the computer...they ask for my name..I give it. One of the waiters decides to pop off at the mouth saying the person that runs the takeout area has gone home for the night and that I needed to go to the bar for my order. While still standing in the takeout area, one of the other waiters prints my ticket and tells me that he's gonna check on my order. I watched, as this pitiful excuse of customer service was happening, the waiter that printed my ticket didn't even go to the kitchen..he walked straight over to the bar..while I quietly sat at the bar behind them still watching n hearing everything..tell the bartender that he doesn't have time to go check on my food and for the bartender to do it..and I watched that same waiter clock out on the computer right beside where I was sitting at the bar and leave. So still sitting at the bar..waiting keeping my cool cause I don't wanna make a scene and after a good 15 minutes and watching the bartender make about 10 drinks...this pitiful excuse of help finally acknowledges me sitting there and ask if I was ordering a drink. Why the fuck would I want a drink when I'm here for a takeout order that I should have left with almost 20 fuckin minutes ago?!?!? Still being calm..I told him I'm not here for a drink but only my takeout order and the waiter that gave u my ticket left for the night and I just want my food. So then the bartender says he's gonna check on it but then starts making more fucking drinks!!! WTF?!?!?!  Still waiting...the sorry ass excuse of a manager had already walked past me several times..looking right at my black ass but never acknowledged the fact that I had no drink or food and had been sitting there for 20 gotdamn minutes and was clearly pissed off!!! Why would u not come and at least ask if everything is being taken care of?!?! Sorry bitch!!! So finally some other waiter that had passed by me several times asked me what I needed and he went and got my order that had been sitting and ready since the moment I walked in the door. Embarrassing!!! So we get home with our food that's not even fuckin room temperature warm...my fiancés salad...lemme just say we have had better prepackaged salads from a gas station then what she had last night. Lettuce was beyond soggy and wilted, no salad dressing tossed in to make it a Caesar salad nor was there any on the side. All it was was some bullshit with a chicken breast on top that had no flavor or seasoning at all. So called croutons look like they had taken some sliced bread and just cut the edges off, broke em up it pieces and threw them on top. The chicken club sandwich I had..was even that!! Soggiest of soggy sourdough bread that was a couple weeks old and attempted to be warmed up again. The chicken breast was one of the coldest, hardest, oldest, blandest, most embarrassing excuse for some chicken I had ever had in my life. The sandwich literally had one of piece of romaine lettuce that had probably been sitting outside all day considering it was so soft, wilted, and almost black in color. The bacon was even bacon! Honestly I really don't know what that was that I ate. Pray for me!!! We'll never go back to this BJs or any other BJs ever again until this place is completely revamped with food, service, and management!!!"
Amelia M.,"Lubbock, TX",0,42,14,3.0,11/8/2016,"I've eaten here a few times. I usually order the soup and salad deal. House salad with ranch & clam chowder. The house salad is always the same. Good. Nothing special, nothing terrible. Clam chowder is hit or miss. It could be creamy one day and unbearably salty the next. I ordered a burger for the first time, there was a hair, a long hair in the patty. It was absolutely repulsive. I can't handle hair in my food - accidents happen, I know. The manager was very apologetic which was great, no negative attitude at all. In fact, he comped my meal. Service was great and so was he. The hair isn't a reason to stop coming, but it's also not a reason to come as a regular. Hair, no stars. Service, five. Manager five as well. Over all experiences of food since I've been coming here - okay. So, three stars is branded into it for me."
Lee L.,"Lubbock, TX",162,238,61,3.0,10/29/2016,"The food is alright, just a little higher priced than I felt like it should be, I'd honestly rather go somewhere else. It's usually pretty loud in there and busy. Their pazookies are good."
Reyna H.,"Mesa, AZ",41,12,4,3.0,8/16/2016,"The service was really slow despite the fact that we didn't even have to wait to be seated. It took at least five minutes to catch the waiters attention, and then an additional 5 for him too fulfill whatever request we had."
Sharun D.,"Lubbock, TX",1,26,1,3.0,9/7/2016,"The avacodo egg rolls are the only item I order when dining here. So GOOD! The food items I've tried outside of the rolls are meh to say the least (pasta, pizza, chicken something or another)..the alcoholic beverages are below average, however the staff has always been friendly enough. Too Expensive for the quality of food & drinks but friends enjoy this place so I ride along."
David S.,"Overton, TX",3,28,94,2.0,8/13/2016,Fried calamari for an appetizer was fair.  The pizza was cooked on a super thin cracker like dough which I found to be quite flavorful. The house salads were not extraordinary. Another member of my party had a pulled pork sandwich.   The service was slow.  We were seated immediately.   45 minutes to get our food.  It was busy but not packed.  I did use my Yelp coupon for the fried calamari.   $45 with the tip.  I would return to try their different flavors of beer.  I will say our waitress did her best.
Suzanne S.,"Midland, TX",0,24,1,4.0,12/10/2016,Grabbed a quick dinner here while visiting for work.  Wait staff were good and the food just right. Recommend the fried artichoke and parmesan crusted chicken.
Richard B.,"Alvord, TX",0,39,1,4.0,6/8/2017,"Never a surprise here. Always a great experience. Food is consistent and Nathan the bartender was very accommodating, attentive and just an all around seasoned professional."
LouAnn W.,"Amarillo, TX",0,12,,3.0,2/25/2017,"Went to BJ's last night...I will change my eating option next time I'm in Lubbock.  They changed their menu...no longer have wedge fries!  Very poor change, the fries are NASTY!!!"
Janet P.,"Lubbock, TX",0,22,1,1.0,11/25/2016,Twice I visited. Twice I ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken. Twice it was served pink. Never again.
Mark H.,"San Antonio, TX",0,1,,1.0,11/20/2016,"Went there tonight, bj's is usually one of my favorites as far as the food and beer goes. However the service has absolutely been horrible at this location tonight, and the one in San Antonio I like. The hostess greeted us then went in the kitchen for like 10 minutes and left 3 groups of people just wondering where she went, when she came back out, she was eating something, then seated us. Our waiter took so long to ask us our drinks, 12 minutes, we were ready to order our food. The food was good, although he got my wife's order completely wrong, and no offer to compensate or free desert or anything. Such a disappointment. Bj,s is off my like list!"
Erica S.,"Raleigh, NC",387,193,922,4.0,5/18/2014,"The taste of food at this BJ's is always consistent! It's something you can always rely on! The restaurant is also very clean. If you are looking for a girly cider that is sweet, juicy, crisp and bubbly, I would recommend the berry burst cider.  This chain is pretty much known for their deep dish pizzas, brews, and famous pizookie cookie desserts! The best pizza IMO is the great white if you like creamy Alfredo sauce, and if you like a combination of salty and sweet I would recommend the salted caramel pizookie. I would have given this place 5 stars, but the service could be more up to par. Last time I ate here, I had 5 orders accidentally almost come to my table.  Servers could be a little more accurate, and having been hungry and seated it's a tease to bring already made food to customers that haven't even ordered yet. Putting food in front of hungry customers that haven't ordered yet is a big No-No."
Megan P.,"Lubbock, TX",2,3,,2.0,6/3/2016,"I've been to several BJ's that have been great but this location is horrible. We tried it a few times wondering if maybe it was just a bad night/day but nope! Bad service and underwhelming food! Long waits at the table, inattentive waiters/waitresses, mixed up orders. So disappointing because we love it in other towns!"
Jeanette M.,"Oakland, CA",202,248,396,3.0,3/18/2015,The Lubbock BJs has renewed my confidence in this chain! I have never been a fan of BJs but on a recent visit to Lubbock I wanted something easy and familiar so BJ seemed like the perfect sit down place to satisfy my two requirements.  My first night in Lubbock I was looking for a place to eat at 11:00 pm. Being a university town I thought for sure there would be a lot of options.  I was sadly mistaking. My options where BJs or Wingstop. That first night I ordered the Santa Fe salad with blackened salmon. The salad was fresh and crisp and had great toppings. The dressing was creamy but not heavy and the salmon was seasoned perfectly.  After a long day at work today we decided to again go to BJs bcz our first experience was so positive. Again BJ's did not disappoint. My coworker had the chicken lettuce wraps and she loved them. I had the barbecue chicken salad and it was absolutely wonderful. The veggies were crisp and fresh the salad was not overly dressed and it had a good lettuce to dressing ratio. We also enjoyed a skinny margarita and a light Mojito! Which was exactly what we needed after a long day at work. I likely will not go to BJ's near the area where I live because there are so many delicious dining options in my area. However in Lubbock I might decide to go to BJ's because I know they have good dishes that are familiar.
Justin H.,"Lubbock, TX",35,54,,1.0,4/6/2017,"I sure would like to enjoy BJ's--with its craft beer and large menu--but I have had two really terrible experiences here. I won't be back. In both cases, the beer was underwhelming, the food was uninteresting (the pizza was especially bad), and, particularly in the case of the second time, the service was absolutely awful. We waited 15 minutes for a server, another 15 minutes for water, and over an hour for food. I have no idea how my three year-old didn't have a complete meltdown."
Tracy T.,"Lubbock, TX",40,12,1,1.0,10/6/2015,"The restaurant is half full and has lots of staff. Still, our drinks ran out so went got the water and tea pitchers from the wait station and the waitress who was standing there just looked at us as we took them. It took 45 minutes to get our food, and I asked for ketchup so many times that I finally gave up and asked another table if I could have theirs.  Food is ok. Nothing special. Of course, it was lukewarm by the time we got it so that might have caused the less than stellar taste. Please try harder,  BJ's."
Nelson L.,"Lubbock, TX",25,65,24,4.0,11/11/2015,"Had ribs at BJ's.  Tasty, with 2 sides.  Nice, modern decor, with lots of TVs so you can follow your favorite game.  There are tables in the bar area, which is first come first serve, so sometime you can be seated quicker.  They have a large beer selection, and an encyclopedic menu.  Their pizookies are great, too.  If you belong to their Premier Rewards, you'll get emails on specials.  They also have happy hour."
Steve G.,"Rainbow, TX",0,4,,1.0,8/23/2016,Worst ribeye steak I've ever had. Ordered medium and had to send back twice because it was worse than well done veggies were raw. I'll never go back.  Not even worth one star.
Kaytlin Y.,"Lubbock, TX",140,23,2,1.0,5/19/2016,"Overpriced and not good. I have gotten food poisoning on one occasion from here, and my husband did on another visit. We have officially given up on this place."
