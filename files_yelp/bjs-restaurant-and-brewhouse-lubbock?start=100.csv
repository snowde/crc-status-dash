Becky W.,"Austin, TX",63,19,6,1.0,11/12/2013,"Appetizers are the only thing we have had that's good. Anything meat we have had to return because it is never cooked through. Tonight I had the ribs that are on special, they where raw."
Derrick R.,"Lubbock, TX",6,7,,1.0,2/9/2013,"I have not experienced this level of terrible ever.  This restaurant went for the hat trick of TERRIBLE customer service, bad food, and ugly attitudes towards us for complaining about it.    We had a waitress (ashley) who was nice, but after taking our orders absent.  A different waitress brought our drinks (the wrong ones, and not good to boot), a different one brought our appetizers (these were actually ok) and then a different one brought out our meals.   We ordered 2 things that basically no one should ever mess up-  Chicken Fried Steak, and Fish and Chips.   My fries and the tartar sauce were excellent, but the fish and chicken fry was WAY over cook to the point of being burnt.  We waited for a long time looking for a waitress or waiter so we could complain.  I got up, went to the front desk and asked for one.  When he did show up (20 minutes later) he was less than helpful, not very apologetic, and rude.   THEN our waitress who we hadn't seen in almost an hour showed up to ask how we liked our food.    This level of service and quality of food was so bad, that I will make sure and tell every one I know on every social media outlet, in person, and any stranger I meet to stay well away from BJs."
Brandy L.,"Lubbock, TX",0,2,,2.0,1/21/2015,"2 adults and 1 child went for lunch on a Monday afternoon. Arrived around noon and were told we had a 15-20 minute wait. We waited 45 or more, as we watched everyone else that came in after us get seated. We were eventually told they were waiting for a table that could accommodate a high chair. The hostesses seemed to be very understaffed and were working hard to keep people moving in. Once we reached our table there was no sign of a waiter for maybe 20 minutes. We flagged down who we assumed was the manager after he talked to another table who were obviously unhappy about their service. He took our orders and we continued to wait. The food was good once it came. We were so hungry by that point. We had to ask for silverware and napkins after the food came. We observed the manager apologizing to 4 tables immediately around ours while we were there. Something is definitely off with the management or the way this place is run. It's too bad. I really liked the turkey burger."
Renee N.,"Lubbock, TX",0,6,3,4.0,1/19/2014,"We go to BJ'S occasionally. Their menu can be overwhelming but they have awesome choices. Their pizzas are fabulous. I like the chicken avocado club. The skinny French fries are sooo good. The Ahi Poke is scrumptious, only place in Lubbock that I would get raw tuna!  Had a cheeseburger once but wasn't impressed. My 7 yr old loves the kids cheeseburgers and fries and of course the house made root beer. I've also had the pazookie and it was heavenly."
Tim M.,"Midland, TX",11,28,,5.0,6/27/2013,"By far the best place I would return to if I get the chance. Amazing was the word of choice the last 2 nights. Great food, cheaper prices and lots to choose from!"
Kevin A.,"Lubbock, TX",36,4,,5.0,10/10/2012,Amazing food and service!   The Hefeweizen and the Thai Wontons rule!  Can't wait to go back.
Amanda M.,"Midland, TX",3,5,1,5.0,5/4/2013,"I absolutely love this place.  I will definitely come here again and again.  However, I wasn't loving my service today, but it could have just been an off day for our server.  I tried the Parmesan Crusted Chicken Sandwich and it was amazing.  I am currently waiting on a Cookies & Creme Pizooki and I'm sure it will be wonderful.  Nothing less than 5 stars for this place."
Ryan M.,"Lubbock, TX",1,40,4,5.0,6/28/2014,Very nice place! Beautiful interior. Very clean. Super friendly staff. The pizza is absolutely amazing. The prices may be a bit high but definitely worth the good experience.
Tess R.,"Lubbock, TX",1,5,5,3.0,4/26/2013,"Since it was only two of us, we were seated within 15 mins of arrival, which wasn't bad at all. since I've read previous comments and the long waits. Place was packed around lunch time on weekend. Our food was ok. I had the shrimp tacos, which on menu it says they're on a corn tortilla, it wasn't. I hate flour tortillas on seafood tacos! Then my hubby ordered the bone-in southern chicken, and received a breaded chicken breast. Disappointing. Food is definitely a little overpriced and menu is extremely large, sometimes this isn't a good thing, because then stuff gets lost in the shuffle, like our chicken and taco/tortilla orders. Waitress was very attentive and kept our glasses full. That was nice. Not sure if we will be returning."
Holly P.,"Lubbock, TX",0,2,,2.0,8/18/2014,My food had a hair or piece of plastic in it.  Management came by and gave us a story about it being a bristle from the garlic brush and that it has happened before.  We waited another 15 minutes for new plate while the rest of the table continued eating.  When we received our bill there was no discount or food completely taken off.  Good business practice would have been to at least give a discount.  Food was substandard  and overpriced.
Beverly C.,"Dunlap, TN",10,3,6,4.0,11/28/2012,Great atmosphere and food arrived hot and fast.  Loved the woodchuck!
Cara P.,"Amarillo, TX",11,57,,4.0,11/25/2012,"The beer was great (Tatonka stout) , it's a bit pricey for a weekly dinner for us (with three kids) but would be great for a couple, I had the jalapeno burger and it was delicious. Fries also were very good. Service was top notch, only complaint we had is my husband had to send his bleu burger back because he ordered rare and they brought well done, but they fixed it very quickly and were very nice about it."
Stacey H.,"Lubbock, TX",3,4,,2.0,4/6/2014,"Received a dirty plate--food from a previous meal crusted on the plate. Service was slow for lunch on a Saturday. Food itself was good, but not worth the 20.00 I paid."
Samantha M.,"Irving, TX",2,20,8,2.0,9/1/2014,"Although the food is good here, I find at this specific location the service is below reasonable expectations. It took ten minutes to get water, and another 10 to order a beer and appetizer (and by that point, the rest of our meal). I ordered the spinach artichoke dip, and the top sirloin with a loaded baked potato and Caesar side salad. The salad came out with the app and was fresh and good. However, when they brought our entrees out the potato had sliced cheese laying across the top....sliced cheese. I looked at it funny and The girl who brought it  out said ""Yeah, that looks weird."" I said yes, it should be shredded cheese. They brought me out a 2oz cup of shredded cheese. I had to ask them to take the potato back and bring out a fresh one with melted shredded cheese. Really shouldn't be that difficult. The cook shouldn't have taken a shortcut and the server should have refused to bring out a half ass dish. However....the food and beer was delicious. Frustrated with the sub-par service."
Alex W.,"Lubbock, TX",7,3,,2.0,10/8/2012,I tried to have my 21st Birthday here which would have been atleast 25 people and a check of over 500$. The manager turned me down and said that his staff couldn't handle a 25 person table. I even asked if I could just be on the wait list and be seated when they had available tables and he still said that they wouldn't seat a party of 20+ people. Chuys next door was happy to take my party.
Allen S.,"Lubbock, TX",1,33,3,2.0,2/17/2014,"I have visited this place twice and left completely disappointed both times. The service was poor, the food was not good and it took forever to get seated."
