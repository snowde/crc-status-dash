Kimberly A.,"Houston, TX",82,86,33,3.0,6/15/2016,"Attended a corporate function here for lunch. The waitress did a wonderful job accommodating such a large group! Refilling waters and teas constantly and keeping orders straight in her head is kinda a tough feat. The SALMON QUINOA BOWL had a wonderful bounty of veggies - mushrooms, asparagus, bell peppers. It's on the healthy part of their menu. So if you want an alternative to burger and fries try this out!"
Daniel S.,"Lubbock, TX",19,10,,2.0,6/28/2015,"Food is good, but a bit expensive for the portion sizes. We tried a few of the menu-named mixed drinks and martinis and we're not very impressed.  Unfortunately, the service was not great either.  Went back recently and same issues. Sat at the bar, the bartender(30-something, dark headed male) was not friendly or helpful at all.  More than willing to go back for the food, if the service were to improve."
Callye A.,"Grapevine, TX",22,18,24,2.0,6/18/2015,"Sigh. BJ's.  Am I allowed to say maybe they chose the name because they blow?  Yes, I said that. I've eaten at BJ's a total of five times...two good experiences and three AWFUL, hence the stars. Long story short, the wait is always unbelievably long even if we're the only ones sitting there.  Also, we've waited on entrees for over an hour TWICE. Tonight was our final visit.  My husband had to saw his steak (we might've forgiven the wait if the food had at least been good) to eat it and he got three broccoli florets on his plate.  My food was just ehhh too.  Anyway, unless you want beer and have time to spare, skip it and go somewhere else."
Candia M.,"Albuquerque, NM",35,159,13,4.0,8/13/2015,"In Lubbock for work for a week and this place is right by my hotel.  Being exhausted at the end of very long days, I have been to this place three nights in a row.  Good, solid service, lots of options, half price wine and other drinks (I had my wine so I was not as attentive to the other options) at happy hour, and an ""Enlightened"" menu of lower calorie items than the usual chain food fare, with calorie counts.  The ahi salad was great, the bison burger with a side salad the next night was very good and flavorful, and the barbacoa chicken on brown rice that I had as takeout last night was the best so far.  I thought the prices were very reasonable and the portions, if anything, a bit large.  Not usually a chain restaurant kind of gal but this was good and convenient and nearly guilt-free.  (If you don't don't the wine and really who does?)"
Scott B.,"Big Spring, TX",13,410,303,4.0,8/8/2015,"Very nice, trendy, open restaurant with a very friendly and professional staff. First time to try a BJ's, and my wife and I both thought it was fairly good, but nothing unforgettable except the Pizookie desserts. Holy insulin overload! The PB Smores was greatness; the salted caramel pizookie was Epic!  My advice: just split an entre', and save your calories and appetite for desserts. 3.5 stars; Pizookies make it 4."
Alan T.,"Thousand Island Park, NY",0,4,,1.0,9/5/2016,Don't bother.  12-13 tables and still waited almost an hour for two bowls of soup and a burger.  Worst thing is no one really seemed to care.  Not sure how you can stay in business the way...
Dirk K.,"Shamrock, TX",1,9,,1.0,5/14/2016,"This place is going down hill fast, was good when first opened but has since fallen short and it gets worse with each visit. It used to be a favorite of ours but not anymore.  The service this evening was horrible with no regard for the customers, the staff were over whelmed and under trained and it showed every step of the way.  The food was lackluster especially given the price and everyone at the table had their order messed up, oh well, we'll go somewhere else."
S W.,"Lubbock, TX",1,15,8,4.0,7/1/2015,We went here for dinner for the first time since moving to Lubbock. I ordered the grilled chicken Alfredo. It was a little on the soupy side but it was good. My son ordered the shrimp scampi pasta which was spicy but he liked it. My husband had a cheeseburger and fries which looked really good. The desert was the best! You have to try their cookie dessert! It's a warm cookie with vanilla ice cream. You won't regret it.
Bree L.,"Abilene, TX",0,3,2,5.0,4/29/2016,Great service. Fast turn around on our food. We got the grilled salmon quinoa bowl (lunch size) and it was fantastic! My hubby got the piranha ipa beer and I got a virgin Bloody Mary. Both delicious. Would recommend to anyone :)
Matthew M.,"Schertz, TX",0,6,,1.0,6/27/2016,Do I have to give this a star? This place is absolutely awful. DO NOT GO HERE. Here is why... I ordered calamari.. It comes out and looks dreadful. The calamari was greasy and chewy as gum. Tasted like freezer burn. Also came out with no sauces and was thrown on the table. I immediately got the waitress and sent the food back... Then we ordered the entrees. I went with a simple roast beef dip... When it came out it didn't look so simple. The bread literally looked like it had been sitting in water for the past 2 days. I picked up the bread and it was so soggy and gross it fell apart onto my plate. The fries were super old and cold. I showed the waitress how disgusting it was and all she did was laugh. What a joke for a restaurant. Do not go to this place. Bad service and even worse lazy cooked food. Disgusting.
Shari D.,"Altus, OK",108,86,45,5.0,4/30/2016,"Great family meeting place! We love the appetizers, and the selection of entrees. Their shakes are superb, and you have to try the avocado rolls! There are televisions for viewing, and the restaurant is always clean. From steaks to pizzas, it is always a great recipe for foodie fun!"
Jim C.,"Oklahoma City, OK",1,20,,5.0,11/18/2015,This is a great eatery chain. Always consistently very good food no matter what city I am in. I have ate at the Location many times and highly recommend it for great beer and excellent food.
K.t. M.,"Lubbock, TX",139,81,34,4.0,1/10/2016,"I love the deep dish pizza at BJ's. Now while it does not compare to a Chicago deep dish, it is really good for Lubbock, TX. They also have really good drink specials and unique drink items. When I go, I usually order bigger portions so I can have some to take home. For deep dish in Lubbock, this is my place."
Leslie W.,"Lubbock, TX",0,10,,3.0,3/19/2016,"I've only been here twice and had a different experience both times. First, don't order the sliders! They were supposed to come with lettuce, pickles, and onions. There are 4 sliders per plate and I received 1 pickle, no lettuce, and 2 very small slices of onion.......and they tasted like McDonald's hamburgers.  My second visit was much better. The California BLT was wonderful and could probably feed 2 people. Finally tried the pazookie dessert......AMAZING!!!! I do recommended BJs even though my first experience was horrible."
Phillip C.,"Clarksville, TN",0,1,,1.0,3/13/2016,Not impressed at all.Took forever to go through the 20 or so page menu.I had the balsamic chicken. It sat on a bed of lettuce and spinach so the salad was hot and dry. The mashed potatoes were cold and the chicken was more skin and gristle than chicken. My wife did like her $12 burger. Won't be back
Elle E.,"Lubbock, TX",0,109,2,3.0,11/4/2015,"Ran by with some friends one afternoon.  Food was ok.  Had a chicken sandwich.  The fries were better than the sandwich.  Service was acceptable, but nothing to write home about.  Might go back, might not.  Ambivalent about the whole place, and that's not a good thing for a restaurant."
Simone T.,"Los Angeles, CA",169,574,1123,4.0,11/9/2014,"They say everything in Texas is big and this Bj's is no exception, it is pretty huge. The service was on point from the hostess to waiter to the bartender. First time having their burgers and they were pretty good, almost like a steak burger. Came on a Sunday thinking they would have breakfast brunch as they do in Cali but that's not the case so we had to have lunch. No problem enjoyed my food and would return if I ever come back to Texas again."
Sandy N.,"Sacramento, CA",266,876,2178,2.0,7/25/2014,Their clam chowder was hella salty.
Lynn W.,"Lincoln City, OR",71,391,360,4.0,10/20/2012,"More like 3 1/2 stars.  But they've just opened -- maybe they will get better. Not your local microbrewery.  Yes, they are selling their own brews, but these are not artisan brews of local flavor -- this is a big chain and thus these are the house branded mass produced kinds of ""micro"" brews. The food was good -- everyone at our table found something they really enjoyed -- from Jambalaya that met the standards of 2 former residents of NOLA, to a lavish little 6"" pizza smothered in cheese. My test for a chain is always to try their version of chili -- this is Texas after all, and if you're opening a place here and serving the state bowl -- you better get it right. Sadly, they didn't .  Wendy's Hamburgers chili is better -- and it's not really chili either.  BJ's ""chili"" was basically a scarce bit of meat and a couple of beans smothered in a starch-thick and paste-like gravy.  If there was real chili powder or real cumin in that gravy, they were well hidden.  It had none of the heat (or even warmth) of real chili (mine was only luke-warm), and was so bland in general that it was nearly tasteless.  Here's a hint: chili should be red, not brown.  Or beige, as this was.  Even in the dark of this low-light temple of corporate restauranteering, it looked like something that should have been scraped off boots in the parking lot.  Which is a shame since they sell it by the bowl, on burgers, on baked potatoes, and in several other menu-slots.  They need to visit Terlingua and buy themselves a real recipe. On the positive side -- the chili was the only big gaff at our table.  It was a 34th birthday celebration and the birthday-boy tried one of their beer samplers -- 5oz tastes of their 4 lightest brews.  He found 1 favorite (the Hefeweizen), 2 okay, and the last was left on the table.  -- the same percentages that our 4 meals ran. All in all, the building is beautiful; the menu is so elaborate that we all assume half the choices will vanish after the first 2 months of operation here (most of the chains that come here start with a equally broad menu and then narrow to match the tastebuds of the town); and, the mixed drinks from the bar were creative and adequate -- if a little weak.  The Friday night wait was (over an hour) long, the service was leisurely-to-slow, the volume was outrageous -- but the atmosphere was good.  People seemed to be happy working there, and eating/drinking there. They have a rewards-card program that awards points for non-alcoholic purchases, and their corporate charity is a self-named not-for-profit that supports the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation."
Melody T.,"Las Colinas, TX",608,639,2746,4.0,5/14/2014,The service here was very nice! Sat and the bar and the gentlement behind the bar was super nice. He gave great information on all of the beers and every let me sample a few before I made my selection!!! Also made sure that I had my reward points at the end of the night!
