Mrs B.,"San Angelo, TX",0,69,,5.0,12/22/2015,"Didn't get to go in but did get three lunches to-go. They were all delicious! We ordered the California's club sandwich, Mediterranean pita tacos, and a pizza. Everyone loved their meal. So good"
Melissa T.,"San Antonio, TX",287,121,64,2.0,4/25/2014,"I've been here three times and I was underwhelmed each time. The first time I went, we waited nearly an hour over the estimated wait time given by the hostess.  The management did not even attempt to rectify the problem by apologizing. The second time I went, the service was better but the food was bad. I got a burger and it was dry. The third time i went i got alfredo with blackened chicken. The noodles were hard. The stuffed mushroom appetizer is decent and the pizookies are good.  The atmosphere is nice and modern and that's probably why I keep going back dispite the subpar food.  Bottom line: not reccomended for food. Dessert and appetizers are fine. Good atmosphere."
Adam B.,"Ransom Canyon, TX",116,49,61,4.0,5/29/2014,"I'm not sure why I feel guilty recommending this place - they do everything really well. The food looks and tastes good (although the pizzas are waaaaay overpriced), the beer is great, the service and environment are impeccable.  Maybe it stems from it being a chain - maybe I don't want Lubbock to turn into Dallas. I really have nothing bad to say about BJ's, especially since they added free wi-fi. It's a great place to go get a pitcher or three of Nitro Porter or Stout..."
Mary H.,"Lubbock, TX",45,10,3,1.0,12/20/2015,Samon Quinoa plate was over cooked and terrible. Pulled pork sandwich not good either. Poor service and not so good food. Should have stuck with a pizza.
Oscar D.,"Hawley, TX",3,38,17,3.0,7/20/2015,"Good job today, celebrated my wife's birthday. Order a bunch of food from Pizza to Wings to Cherry chipotle glazed Salmon. All was good. The calamari  appetizers was not good. Seemed old. The PBJ POOZOKIE was on point. Service was also good."
R R.,"Brazoria, TX",0,9,6,4.0,4/7/2016,"Ate here last night with my son & his girlfriend who live here. Just wanted to share that the steaks here are awesome. Had the filet..Cooked perfect everytime we come. Very busy place, noisy, they have someone singing & playing the guitar, nice.  The waiter forgot my salad but was very apologetic. Be prepared to wait during busy hours. They were packed but we got seated right away. And they were still able to have our meal served in descent time & hot & perfectly cooked my steak again!"
Mandi M.,"New Braunfels, TX",3,26,,5.0,5/18/2015,"This restaurant was on top of their game and made for a perfect evening! We were in town for one night for work purposes and decided to make our way over for a Jeremiah Red and some dinner. We went with the Parmesan crusted chicken and the Angel hair Classico w/shrimp. Both were excellent! We finished things off with the pazookie trio- Oreo, peanut butter and white macadamia nut- DELICIOUS! The Oreo was my personal favorite (even better with a PM Porter) and my brother loved the white macadamia.  We sat in the bar area as usual and had excellent service, as usual. BJ's always has great service but I find the servers that take care of the bar area are usually a step up.  The staff was also able to switch on the USA vs Mexico women's soccer game so that was a big cherry on top! I've been a fan of BJ's for quite some time and this Lubbock location definitely did not let us down! until next time Jeremiah..."
Dennis M.,"Lubbock, TX",12,20,6,5.0,10/13/2013,"The food was amazing. We arrived and were promptly seated. Our server was ok and did the job. My daughters had the kids meals. One ordered a salad with hers, and it looked amazing and fresh when it came out. Both enjoyed their meals, and the triangular shaped crayons were a nice touch. I had the new pepperoni extreme deep dish pizza. It was spectacular. It was not too saucy, and the crust was buttery. The atmosphere was really nice, even for me and my daughters. I highly recommend this place. I will definitely come back."
Chrys G.,"Salem, MO",0,6,3,1.0,5/5/2015,"Only redeeming factor was that the hostess got me seated quickly. No line and hardly any customers in at 5:30pm. Didn't take long to realize why. Was seated for easy 10 minutes and still no one to even take a drink order. Did make sure and let the hostess know why I was leaving and she didn't seem surprised. Will not bother going back. It's one thing to take the time to get the food order right, but when you can't even get your drink order taken, I'm done with it."
Marcus T.,"Wolfforth, TX",0,5,2,1.0,6/30/2015,"After a two year hiatus, decided to come in again but only because our original choice had a 15 minute wait.  Food was ok but room temp instead of hot.  Ordered an app that never came out.  Probably won't be back as every time it is either bad service or bad food.  First visit included bugs with our salad and cold food.  Service was rude because we said something about the bugs."
Will H.,"Lubbock, TX",0,53,,2.0,4/16/2016,More focus on the bar. The food is average at best. Portion sizes are small for the price. Service is poor. If you're wanting good food... Don't go here.
Randy T.,"Shallowater, TX",0,24,1,5.0,4/19/2015,"Went back and same results. Awesome  service, this place has completely turned around its slow service issues. As stated in my last review, if you had issues due to slow service, you must return, you will not be disappointed. AND the food is great..."
Ryan C.,"Red Oak, TX",136,10,1,3.0,11/3/2013,"Ok, the food is tasty but for the most part all Bj's have quality food. This particular location suffers from severe service issues that come from a lack of management and training. Took over 30 minutes to get a small app, constant apologies from the waitress which is appreciated but the lack of management caring and the rude attitude of the only bartender make this experience horrible. I hope someone from management reads this and takes time to learn that you're struggling bad in your front of the house efforts. Love BJ's but this location makes it really hard to come back."
Jordan M.,"Lubbock, TX",1,15,,5.0,12/21/2014,"This is an awesome restaurant. The food is great, but the service is terrible. I think most of the time it is worth the wait. The pizookies are melt in you mouth gooy savory and delicious! I think the pizookies and drinks are BJ's main attraction."
Phillip D.,"Mansfield, TX",90,249,193,3.0,5/29/2013,"The brews were pretty good and $5.50 per pint is OK, but watch out for what the girls order if they don't like beer-$10 specialty drinks jacked up the bill like crazy! 4 people ate and it was $100 before tip. Food was OK and portions weren't huge. If everyone drinks one or two beers you'll spend less."
Pete S.,"Lubbock, TX",60,667,1647,4.0,5/8/2013,"We have been to the Lubbock location two times. The first time we ordered hamburgers and the second time we had pizza. The hamburgers were cooked to perfection, as we don't like them cooked dead. Haha! The pizza was also very good. We would order it again. The place was very clean. The wait staff was prompt and friendly. This is a be back."
Leah C.,"Rocklin, CA",0,27,5,5.0,1/15/2015,"Seating: No wait 5/5 Cleanliness: 5/5 Service: Fast, Courteous and Attentive 5/5 Food Quality: 5/5 Beer: 5/5 (Studio Session IPA & Oasis Amber) Some BJ's can be pretty hit or miss with their breweries, but the Lubbock location is spot on with theirs; the beer is amazing at this location! Their staff is wonderful as well! I went to eat at this location with one of my friends who has a very uncommon food allergy (black pepper) and the manager actually came to our table and helped my friend come up with a dish that he could eat without having to worry. He enjoyed his meal and was quite impressed with how accommodating everyone was. I was also very impressed because it's not often that restaurants will go as far as they did to make sure customers with uncommon allergies are still able to get an amazing meal! The waitress we had was very quick and polite as well. She had a second beer to the table right before I took the last sip of my first! She also put on a hockey game for me as well! I know that some people tend to avoid chain restaurants, but sometimes they're worth going to. That is definitely the case for this BJ's location! Even if you're looking to just grab a few *great* beers and a snack, this is a great place to go! Edit: BJ's has six microbreweries nation-wide. This BJ's gets it's house beer from the Temple, TX BJ's microbrewery. This location serves legitimate award winning microbrewed beers crafted right here in Texas. The BJ's microbreweries (as far as I know) are located in: Chandler, AZ, West Covina, CA, Brea, CA, Boulder, CO, Reno, NV, and Temple, TX. The food here may be hit or miss (probably due to the high rate of turnover), but the brews are on spot."
Joe A.,"Kellyville, OK",0,8,,2.0,1/10/2016,"We were in town for the TT/KU basketball game and thought this would be be a fun lively place to go after the game . Not sure where that packed house went afterwards, but it wasn't here! And now I know why!  Subpar service for starters. Had to ask twice for waters. In fairness, my wife takes forever to decide, so we always have to ask for a ""few more minutes"". Menus folded and stacked would be a pretty good sign that your guests were ready, if you were anywhere to be found ! Appetizer of Ahi Poke was just ok but overpriced. Fish & chips was cold fries and mostly batter , yuck! The one saving grace was the samples of craft beers to help you decide which to order. All in all just not worth it, there's bound to be something better in Lubbock"
Pilar P.,"Houston, TX",79,45,28,3.0,7/14/2013,"I have been in other BJ's in other cities and it has been much better than this one.  The floor is greasy and slippery so be careful. The waiter was nice but the food was cold. Stone cold. So I asked them to heat it up a bit and still was cold. The flavor was good but pricey for what it is. The beer saves the place.  The avocado rolls are super good. The kids menu is nice and the portions are huge, so two kids can share one, specially the spaghetti.  I will try it once more. probably with a burger. We will see how it goes. I'll update later!"
Leslie T.,"Lubbock, TX",56,8,,1.0,1/21/2015,The service is terrible the manager doesn't supervise the staff at all. We have waited over 20 minutes several times and finally left.  Don't go there until they get a real manager.
