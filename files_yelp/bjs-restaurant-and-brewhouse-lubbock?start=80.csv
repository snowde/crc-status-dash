Angela H.,"Fort Worth, TX",689,703,1133,3.0,10/31/2012,Service was Excellent...cutie girl at the bar with the silver flower in her hair...she checked to make sure thy had a GF menu and was very professional...even when the guys rotated out next to me and both sets were rude to her.  My burger was seasoned with salt and pepper and cooked medium as requested...no bun no cheese is how i roll.  However...the lettuce was all wilted...and the wasabi mashed taters...cold.  But I was hungry and the place was slammed at 9pm on a Tues night...so oh well.   I am not much for chain places...but that is mostly Lubbock unless you want diner food...and we know everything at the diner...is fried...so on to trying and trying.
Chelsea H.,"Lubbock, TX",2,9,6,2.0,2/23/2015,"Had the worst experience ever. Not only was the wine warm, but our food was cold and you could tell the waitress  was overwhelmed. I still tipped her 40% because she was sweet and very apologetic. I feel the management was more of an issue considering he looked right at our wine in the well and then walked off. Like he was too good to check on college students or help out his staff. Very disappointed."
Heather J.,"Elgin, TX",84,143,8,4.0,7/29/2013,"Good food, good beer, good service!!! If you've never been, they have an EXTENSIVE beer and food menu! You will no doubt be able to find something you'll enjoy!"
Robert S.,"Hobbs, NM",59,47,3,5.0,10/13/2014,"This place was GREAT!  Excellent food, fast and attentive service.  We were late arriving and still made it in plenty of time for a concert we had tickets to.  The staff was super friendly, it was a gorgeous establishment, very clean and neat.  If you are in Lubbock, this is a must!  One of the best restaurants in the area!"
Nathan H.,"Lubbock, TX",127,374,383,4.0,8/25/2012,"I could very easily live off the appetizer menu at BJ's. The best way to order is to simply close your eyes and point at the menu. I have had the opportunity to eat at a number of BJ's, and every time I walk away happier then the time before. My favorites are Piranha Pale Ale Nachos, Thai Shrimp Lettuce Wraps, and the Mediterranean Pizza."
andre L.,"El Sobrante, CA",2,124,14,3.0,7/24/2013,Well maybe as an out of towner I expect too much.  BJ's locations usually have alot of very good reviews;  this location a total of 12?  Odd but based on prior experiences at other states I gave them a try.  Ate at the bar.  Nice server but service slow.  I got the feeling they lack training.  You order a drink and they proceed to do something else besides make your drink. Manager starts reviewing something on order data screen.  Still waiting for drink. Odd. No sense of urgency. BTW- first glass of red was close to spoiled- open too long. Food ok but not as good as other experiences at different BJs.  I had Moroccan salmon. Taste ok but menu picture nothing like what I received.  I posted both pictures.  I did really like Thai won tons!
Megan M.,"Lubbock, TX",1,11,,5.0,1/19/2015,"I always have a great experience here. Drinks are on point and food is very consistent. I have had the same waitress several times, and she treats everyone like family. I would recommend the hand crafted root beer and avocado egg rolls!"
Bill K.,"Lubbock, TX",4,97,10,3.0,8/14/2014,Lunch specials are excellent price. Food is good. Service is good. No wow here for me though.
Travis T.,"Gainesville, TX",0,14,,1.0,10/6/2015,Awful service. We waited an hour for our food and the place wasn't busy. We had to fill our own drinks. We won't be coming back. This place blows.
Anita C.,"Austin, TX",61,90,195,2.0,12/29/2013,"Been here a few times and always leave disappointed. Actually a little confused as to why I keep going back. Have yet to experience good service- have to wait about 5 minutes for a beer, and you better drink your water slowly- takes even longer for a refill. Avocado egg rolls were good the first time I got them so I ordered them when I went back- ""crispy"" was definitely not the word I would use to describe them, try soggy. I did enjoy the mahi-mahi tacos however they are tiny and you only get two, so don't count on these filling you up. Burgers are pretty decent, wings are alright, and they do have a nice beer list. I recommend BJ's if you want to grab a few beers- and have ample time to wait around for them."
Joshua S.,"Lubbock, TX",2,27,5,4.0,10/10/2014,This is a good place to eat I recommend the chili burger it's open faced and wonderful be hungry when you order one as they are huge. They could definitely use better waiters and waitresses but other than that I've always enjoyed myself there
Peter Z.,"Lubbock, TX",8,76,66,2.0,4/7/2015,"I struggled to give this restaurant three stars, so I came back and revised it to 2. We came there for a simple business meeting I ordered a burger cooked medium with bacon well-done, I received a Burger cooked medium well too well done definitely not what I ordered the bacon was on the medium side as well. The order had to be sent back and read cooked to the proper temperature. The potato wedges are disgusting, wouldn't feed them to my dog. It was the night of the NCAA men's basketball championship but the TV was set to split screen with baseball and two of the four sections, ridiculous. The bear was good although they didn't have regular Coors, I enjoyed some Boddington's instead. I probably will not return for a long time to this restaurant. Lastly, my chair wobble badly. Just a lot of details that need to be, and should've been, worked out already for such a large chain. I wish there was an option for 2 1/2 stars."
Bryan D.,"Clovis, NM",10,4,5,4.0,12/21/2012,"The atmosphere was nice and the service was good. I wish I had time to try a brew but alas I did not. I had the blackened salmon and it was pretty good, but the vegetables were very bland. All in all it was pretty good, but not amazing."
K C.,"Wolfforth, TX",14,18,1,1.0,3/16/2015,"I have been here 3 times at least and every single time there has been a major wait on the food. It is ridiculous, we always end up talking to the manager and he tells us the same story, ""they are short staffed tonight."" The food is just okay, not that great but not that terrible. Now my husband's food has always had something wrong with it, it came out cold or it tasted like it had been sitting there all day and was old. I am extremely disappointed because I have talked to other people that have had great experiences and think that the food is wonderful."
Kim M.,"San Marcos, TX",13,82,13,5.0,8/31/2013,"I'm a big fan of BJ's, this was the second one I've been to and the food is absolutely delicious. Their salads are among the best I've ever had. Their own beer brews are tasty and fresh. The atmosphere could be good for date night or a group of friends at lunch. The pricing is a bit higher than other chains but the servings are huge and easily split able. Our waiter was kind even though it was clear he had been there for a long shift. Nice place!"
Bobb P.,"Lubbock, TX",0,2,1,3.0,11/27/2013,"The silverware is FILTHY. Photo is ""clean"" brought by manager when we showed him our silver with dried food. GROSS. Food is good but god dang the sikver is NASTY. 11/26/2013 7:00 pm"
LaQuinta G.,"Dallas, TX",36,12,4,2.0,2/8/2015,"We had a party of 5 1/2, our waitress was slow coming to our table just to get our drink order. We should have stepped out then. She brought us water and asked what would we like to eat, not drink but eat. Well we ordered our drinks and food at the same time. I ordered chicken fry with salad and mash. It came to me with half a plate of salad, one small scoop of mash and my gravy looked like they scrapped it from the bottom of the pan. My friend ordered Cajun pasta with blackened chicken. It came to her without ANY chicken!! We thought we had misread the description, so I asked if the Cajun pasta came with chicken. She said yes but it is small diced up chicken. Small diced up chicken?! Umm can you just bring me more chicken? She brings it 15 mins later and stands next to the table beside us with the chicken in her hand, waving it around like it was an empty plate. Umm no! When she sets it on the table that mess was covered and I do mean COVERED in seasoning. I'll skip you next time we are in town..."
Casey F.,"O'Donnell, TX",0,22,,3.0,4/15/2014,"I've been there 4 times now, and the food has never disappointed, but the service definitely has.  The first couple of times the service was ok.  Not great, but ok.  The last two times, the service has been horrendous.  We went two nights ago, and we waited almost 15 minutes after ordering for our drinks to arrive.  We then waited almost 20 minutes for her to come take our order.  Thankfully the food arrived via another waiter.  I really enjoy coming here for the food, but I hope the service will improve."
Dawn R.,"Lubbock, TX",14,27,78,2.0,12/6/2013,"I have to say that eating inside the restaurant is way better than using curbside to go....it's like the kitchen could care less since it's being taken out.  Tonight we ordered chicken fried steak and it was WAY overlooked-almost burnt, the fries were cold, my bacon cheeseburger was moderately warm and VERY bland, more cold fries....the staff is friendly but I'm done with takeout from BJ's!!!"
Steve S.,"Hobbs, NM",0,11,,5.0,1/15/2014,I was stoked when Lubbock opened up their BJ's Restaurant. It is the closest thing to a Cheesecake Factory in SE NM and West Texas. One of my favorite meals at ANY restaurant is here -- the Parmesan Crusted Chicken. I have always found the hostesses and wait staff to be friendly and helpful. Save room for the Original Chocolate Chip Pazookie... you'll be glad you did!
