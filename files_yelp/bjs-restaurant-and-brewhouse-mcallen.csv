RE R.,"Pflugerville, TX",0,12,16,4.0,7/20/2017,"So for starters I came in at roughly 9:45 pm and they close at 12 am. Check your seats before sitting down.  It's a poor practice, but bussers are usually untrained and here the bussers lay the bus bin on the seats. I ordered the salad and the salmon with Cherry sauce. It was perfect and fast! ( I wont queation the use of a microwave) but the plate and contents were hot, which is a plus.   The glaze sauce was sweet and not overdone.  For a drink I ordered a citric beer, and the server also brought out a water, which is a plus on safety. Place is super clean, to include the bathroom. Customer service is excellent. Only complaint is the salad they brought...a little on the limp side (see photo.) Now on their defense, she offered to make another, but I wasnt going to waste what was brought and it really is a minor  thing."
Sandra R.,"McAllen, TX",46,196,904,4.0,6/10/2017,"Dinner this evening was great: pork chop, roasted cauliflower, baked potato, and a BLT salad with lots of spinach and some blue cheese.  Lutz had a tasty I.P.A. with a mango scent, but not flavor and I had a berry cider beer.   The wait staff here is always nice, polite and friendly.  Always knowledgeable and helpful with smiles to boot!  The pork chop was tender, the cauliflower came with a yummy sauce at the bottom of the bowl-I believe it was a mix of turmeric and peanuts.  It was so good, we dipped our pork chop into it!  The BLT salad was refreshing and delicious!  I will be ordering this again!"
Regino G.,"McAllen, TX",826,248,1315,5.0,11/8/2017,This is always a great place to come too. I would say it's like going to the eye and bar and Grill. You can catch some sports while having some great beer or some great tasting food. My favorite item in the menu is the pizza because it's so good and well done that I would rank is in my top five or favorite pizza places. The bar area is huge and very relaxing with multiple large flatscreen TVs to watch your sports team. I recommend this place to anyone wanting to go catch a game or simply wanting to have some great food and beer.
Jay M.,"McAllen, TX",1,2,3,3.0,10/29/2017,The wait staff is usually friendly and the food is decent.  The only negative I see when I go there is the lack of cleanliness in the restroom. There is usually urine and paper towels on the floor and the trash is overflowing.
Sandra S.,"Edinburg, TX",3,23,31,5.0,7/5/2017,Love love love the gluten free pizza. Got the extreme pepperoni and it was mouth watering definitely coming back. Staff very attentive and friendly. Came back again for that pizza  this place doesn't disappoint! The pizza was amazing again! The waiter was a trainee and he did a great job. He was attentive and friendly.
K S.,"Peachtree City, GA",0,58,,3.0,12/9/2017,"Three stars only for FOOD The food consistency is always good. My only concern is with service staff. We went back to have dinner this week.  When my soup was served, i observed that the soup spoon was unclean ( as if no one washed it from previous use) and when service staff was informed, response was OK and just walked away with the unclean spoon.  Also when service staff was cleaning out the table ,she had the plates from next table and picked ours along. I dont think thats what servers do ( why do I need to see what others plates that has used napkins, left over food...etc )"
Hoggie N.,"Edinburg, TX",30,154,702,4.0,6/19/2017,"After revisiting a few more times after the initial 2 times, I'm glad to re Rate one of my favorite places when living in California. Service and Quality of food has been very good and consistent...especially the clam chowder Bread bowl and pizza. Best deep dish Pizza in the valley IMO. With the rewards vip...great savings and coupons. yay!!!"
Caterina S.,"Pharr, TX",89,24,44,4.0,6/4/2017,"The server was very nice and even recommended some of his favorite dishes, and my friends ordered it and loved it. I had ordered the Portobello Swiss Burger with sweet potato fries. I asked for the burger to be medium, and it came out perfectly cooked. The fries were a bit over seasoned with salt, but it was bearable. We finished the night by ordering a peanut butter pizzookie, and it really hit the spot."
Michael J.,"McAllen, TX",0,15,,3.0,6/19/2017,"My wife and I visited today, so I thought I would get around to finally writing a review. First off... the food at BJ's Restaurant Brewhouse is pretty expensive; unless you have a coupon or order one of their specials. The food does taste good and they are a very techie restaurant (and I like tech), so it sort of balances things out. My wife and I use the BJ's app where you can place your order before you leave the house and they start working on it as soon as you are being shown to your table (the hostess checks the order in). My wife ordered the Roasted Chicken Peruvian Quinoa Bowl ($12.95) and I ordered the Prime Rib Dip Sandwich with fries ($14.95). The wait for the food was about 20 minutes (a little bit on the long side considering we were seated at 3:40 PM and the restaurant was practically empty) even though our order went in before we were seated. The food arrived pipping hot and we were also warned about the hot plates by our server. The fries are seasoned and very tasty; they serve a generous portion. The Prime Rib Dip is very tender and the au jus had a good flavor; just right for sandwich dipping. For me, the $14.95 for a sandwich and fries is a little on the pricey side considering you can get a full meal at similar restaurants for less. My wife's told me that her Chicken Quinoa was very delicious with just the right amount of ingredients to complement the chicken breast (Peruvian quinoa & brown rice blend, sautéed red onions, sliced mushrooms, sautéed spinach, seasoned tomatoes, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil & lemon juice). Our server checked in on us several times to make sure we had everything we needed. The service was good! We paid our bill through the BJ's app which accepts Apple Pay (very convenient) and our receipt was emailed to us. Reason for Rating: Cost was a big part of it. Though the items were very good, the quality was comparable to restaurants like Logan's and Chili's where you can get a full meal for less. Had the prices been a little bit cheaper, I would have given the restaurant four stars."
Amy F.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,88,1,2.0,2/18/2017,Was excited to find a late night eat place to hit when I get off of work around 11PM. My group usually hits Roosevelts and I think we'll have to stick to that from now on bc BJs crashed and burned. A bit unfair to judge harshly when an establishment is an hour from closing but these guys just couldn't get it right. Plus we'd have been in and out much quicker without the following issues.  I was with 4 others and was told about about 5-10 minutes after ordering the item wasn't available - which means I had to sit waiting for my new order while everyone else's food came out earlier.  Two salads had to be returned because of bad tuna. And one replacement chicken salad was missing the chicken.  Sorry guys. Won't be back!
Cynthia O.,"McAllen, TX",9,22,18,4.0,5/4/2017,"I LOVE BJ's! It's expensive but the service is always friendly even I had a $10 off coupon! They gave me the opportunity to exchange a side for a soup, OMG Tomato soup was amazing!"
Jerry J.,"McAllen, TX",72,281,737,3.0,7/21/2016,"After years away, we finally tried BJ's again.  It was far better than before, but I'm still not impressed.  Their pizza tastes like it might be from Pizza Hut.  The buffalo wings were ok, nothing great.  Still the best thing here is the beer.  Come for the beer.  Forget the food."
Stevie R.,"McAllen, TX",0,2,1,3.0,3/16/2017,"I've been to BJs several times with my girlfriend. We've ordered our pizza 'well done' plenty of times. Tonight is the first time they actually got it correct. We both love pizza and love the Sweet Pig pizza from here. We both are Pazookie lovers, and it's hard to mess that up. Most likely will be back before the month is over.  I guess depending on the night , will depend on the service. Tonight it was great."
Dustin B.,"McAllen, TX",0,1,,1.0,10/30/2017,The General Manager was extremely rude and aggressive to my wife last night. We were embarrassed in front of the group we brought to dinner from out of town. The staff cringed at the scene he created. I'm still in shock. I'll never go back.
Jarad S.,"McAllen, TX",5,19,4,4.0,6/25/2017,Gotta try one of there beers and I love there pizza it's grate with everything but if pizza and beer is not ur thing then try there stake it's grate too
Ana C.,"Edinburg, TX",0,3,3,5.0,5/14/2017,The staff went above and beyond in helping our group of 6 feel right at home. Definitely will come back.  Thank you to our waiter Lazaro and manager Noe
Sergio R.,"Miami, FL",0,5,,1.0,6/12/2016,"The food is ok, is it worth the price on the menu? No. Service? Some of the worst I've seen. Waited 30 mins for the waiter to come get our drinks, then after my tasteless burger was brought to the table I had to wait 45 mins for someone to come by our table and ask if we were ok, to which I replied ""No, my cold fries need ketchup!""  I got a Guinness draft for my drink. I know, at a brewhouse? Nevertheless, if you go to a place that specializes in beer, you'd think they would know how to pour a damn Guinness into a glass. If you don't, it ruins the flavor!  The only positive? Their handcrafted beers. Great variety and tasty brews. Thumbs up on that. But there's plenty of restaurants that offer great food, service and brews for the same if not lesser price. Will I return?  If I'm starving and all the surrounding restaurants within a 50 mile radius have shut down, yes I will."
Teodoro S.,"San Antonio, TX",9,64,134,4.0,3/22/2016,I came for lunch on a weekday.   I recommend the Root Beer Glazed Ribs and the Avocado Rolls!  Our server Juan M was fast and had the drinks comics out as soon as I was done! I ordered the Bacon guacamole burger! I recommend getting here early for lunch and using the app to order ahead if a Sunday or Saturday.   This BJ's decor is half bar half Bistro.   I loved the vanilla ice cream.
Peter S.,"Livingston, TX",0,12,,2.0,11/12/2016,"About a year ago, I visited this same restaurant and wrote about an unfavorable incident.  Again, the same thing has happened and, sorry to say, ""I've had it with BJs"". This restaurant used to be my favorite; the best food, service and atmosphere but an unidentified manager stops by your table and asks how everything is /was.  He / she wears no identification and does not introduce himself.  It is like some dude from another table wonders over and wants to start talking to you.  I do not need nor want ANYONE other than the server to attend me.  I want to be left alone and enjoy the experience with my bride.  If I have a problem, I know how to address it and don't need to be asked for a verbal review on my server.  I'm done with BJs.  There are too many other restaurants that have better table-side manners."
Ruth C.,"McAllen, TX",208,440,438,4.0,1/8/2016,Came with my mom and sister. I had the clam chowder and a pesto chicken sandwich. The food was really good and the service was spectacular.
Shelby Q.,"McAllen, TX",39,4,1,1.0,8/27/2016,"We initially ordered water, with the intention of getting drinks later on. To bad our waitress never came back after we placed our food order. AND then 45 minutes after we placed our order for a single medium deep dish pizza. The man who I'm guessing is the manager brought our pizza, apologized for the wait and quickly left. (again still not able to ask for our drinks). Now this would've been fine had the pizza been hot. Unfortunately it wasn't. It was warm at best. We brought this up to our waitress who said they thought the pizza was for her own personal consumption. Where the miscommunication is between the servers and the kitchen I don't know. Either way it was a disappointing visit and I don't foresee us coming back to this location in the near future."
Jovanna T.,"Mission, TX",0,4,,3.0,7/15/2016,I love beer and their beer is good but I also love food and their food is slightly okay. Best item I've had off the menu was the salmon salad. Other items off the food menu are about a c rating in my book. Service is great but I think I'll visit just for a quick beer next time.
Amy L.,"Phoenix, AZ",2,18,2,4.0,9/30/2015,"Had a nice long hospital shift here in Texas. After our adventurous palate led us to disaster last night, we wanted to go ahead and try to safety of the large menus that BJs had to offer. We started with the stuffed mushroom, and the Siracha Brussels sprouts. The Siracha Brussels sprouts were roasted to perfection. The creamy Siracha sauce was spicy enough to give an interesting kick, without upsetting my somewhat sensitive stomach. The mushrooms gave me an off aftertaste. They are supposedly stuffed with artichoke spinach, but it tasted more like a jar of Kraft fettuccini sauce and some broccoli.  For dinner I was craving a salad. The picture of the ahi tuna salad looked incredible. So far our service has been very quick and our server seems nice. Update haven't seen our server in a very long time. Hope she's ok Update still no sign of server. She is visible. She is alive. I want desserts in the form of cookie goodness they call a pazookie. Pazookie has arrived. I am happy again. This cookie makes me so happy. The food was filling and absolutely delicious. For a restaurant that wasn't busy by any standards, our server did disappear for a long period of time... But it happens. I would definitely come back if I needed to ever be in this part of Texas again.  Thanks BJs. A good BJ never disappoints."
Ida C.,"McAllen, TX",0,6,15,5.0,5/24/2016,Our waitress was very polite and made excellent suggestions!! It was great! Loved the atmosphere and the food was awesome!
Amy C.,"Baytown, TX",18,4,51,5.0,4/25/2016,"Love coming here! Great atmosphere, and always great service!! Foodies so good. I totally recommend the parmesan crusted chicken with their mashed potatoes and broccoli!!! Ravioli is awesome too!! Oh, and their bread bowl soups are amazing!! You have to try their avocado egg rolls as an appetizer!! I have never waited long for my food! Always a wonderful experience in McAllen Tx."
Luis G.,"Plano, TX",0,2,,1.0,11/23/2015,"Just had a pepperoni pizza, one of the worst.... Loaded with lots of MSG. Used to have one of the best pizzas in town. Very sad Also had some raw chicken served in the sandwich served to someone in my party."
Alexa C.,"Edinburg, TX",3,15,1,4.0,3/27/2016,"The service here was excellent even the manager came to ask how we were. The food was really great too with varieties of pizzas, salads, etc.  A must-have are the pizookies, a cookie with an ice cream on top. It wasn't that busy here on a Sunday afternoon compared to other restaurants around the area. Would recommend this place for everyone."
Lou Lou O.,"McAllen, TX",5,80,437,5.0,2/21/2015,Very good food. My favorite was the avocado egg rolls with tamarind sauce. The burger (don't remember the name but it had fried jalapeños) was delicious. My husband got the ribeye and Parmesan mashed potatoes. The alcoholic beverages are nice and strong. I also got the bacon egg spinach salad with honey siracha dressing (hold the stinky blue cheese) but it was a small portion for the price. Beautiful decor.
Ken L.,"McAllen, TX",5,78,19,4.0,2/1/2016,"Service is either bad or excellent - there's no in between. Food is amazing, especially the pizzas, chicken tortilla soup, chili, etc. Awesome strong draft beers you won't find anywhere else."
Jennifer W.,"Plano, TX",590,1054,544,5.0,10/12/2011,"All I can say is WOW. Customer service at BJ's should get a hundred stars in comparison to other restaurants in this area. It seems that treating the customer nicely and being polite and helpful is a rarity in the valley, but BJ's has it down. Also, they have great food and great beer. I loved their fried artichoke appetizer and their gourmet mac n' cheese. Mmmm... so freaking good.  Main courses I got to try a lot of different things as I snacked off other's plates. The patty melt was actually really good, so are their french fries, I got to try the Parmesan Crusted Chicken (recommended by our AWESOME waiter Fernando) with a lemon/butter sauce which was delicious. It came with white cheddar mashed potatoes that were awesome as well. I didn't get to try it but one of my workmates couldn't stop raving about how awesome the pizza was! Totally delicious and a great place to go for dinner!! Overall, it's reasonably priced, delicious food, with excellent service. What more could you want from a restaurant?"
E P.,"Humble, TX",9,7,14,3.0,8/3/2014,"This is the first time I have been to BJs and I was upset to find out I have never been before in the Houston area. I enjoyed walking into the restaurant because the place is kept very clean and the entrance has a spinning door. When walking in I was immediately greeted and brought to an area to sit down. When ordering my drinks and food, I never had to ask for refill when I ran out. Now the question is...why give this place a 3 Star instead of 4-5? Service was great but the food was very mediocre. Maybe I expected more because of the environment or maybe the chef in the back wasn't feeling it. For the price it is definitely worth trying out but just don't expect for the food to taste as if you are going to a 5 star restaurant."
Roxana F.,"McAllen, TX",14,23,50,4.0,1/31/2015,"Great place, my husband loves their beers and I love their pizza's as well as the southern fried chicken."
Licha K.,"Webster, TX",0,4,,1.0,9/11/2016,"I sat there for 10-15 minutes and no one ever even took my drink order. I walked out. At this point, I expect bad service in the valley.  Why is everyone so rude and disrespectful out here ??"
Armando A.,"Mission, TX",0,4,,1.0,8/7/2015,Waited for 40 minutes for a burger; it was undercooked. Waitress takes it back 20 minutes later brings out an over seasoned burger trying to mask the flavor of a cold burger. The potatoes wedges were also cold unlike the first plate; when the  wedges tasted good and were hot. I think it was intentional to give me a cold burger and wedges. Charges me for the burger after having me wait that long for the meal... Very disappointed with the service and meal.
Phil H.,"Leavenworth, KS",15,76,103,2.0,6/7/2015,I'm being generous. Mediocre food and worse service. Here's a tip for the waitstaff: walk around the table to all of your guests. Stay at one half of the table and you'll earn one half of your tip.
Lauren B.,"New York, NY",409,257,953,4.0,8/13/2012,"Located in the center of the newest McAllen developmental area and convention center, BJ's is always full of people but even with a full restaurant, I've never had to wait! Score. The menu is huge with over 14 pages of brewskis, vinos, salads, pizzas, apps and even steaks ::pink up:: - how do you choose what to get? I'm a creature of habit and when I find something I like (especially at  a chain restaurant) I tend to stick to it. Start off with one of their beer/cider blends... they're interesting & mostly yummy! If you don't drink alcohol, I'd suggest a draft root beer or cream soda! If you want an appetizer but don't want to order too much, get a couple of the ""small plates"". My favorites are the meatballs and crispy artichokes. I love their chopped salads (BBQ and Crispy Chicken), pizzas (with whole wheat crust) and pizookie cookie deserts!  Customer service isn't the best.... very medicore. The servers I've had at this location were dry and boring (even when my dad cracked a sad joke) but when they brought the bill, their demeanor changed as if one smile at the end of the meal would give them a 20% tip. My dad likes watching football games in restaurant bars & their TV is HUGE (literally 100 inches) & daily drink specials are pretty good. It's very weird for me to give a chain restaurant 4 stars but the food has always been good and the bar is a cool place for a drink & small plate!"
Adrienne C.,"Round Rock, TX",113,286,103,3.0,4/27/2014,"Eh none of the food was that great. Pizza was the best thing. Mozzarella salad thing was gross, drenched in dressing and gross looking and the one piece of lettuce had black spots on it. Stuffed mushrooms looked wilted and sad. Skinny margaritas still good. Service was ok."
Patrick S.,"Denver, CO",649,525,921,4.0,2/4/2012,"Very good barbacoa tacos on the lunch special...but I needed more food. Priced at $5.95 it was fine for what I paid but I was freeking starved! Although its a chain, I like BJ's...Nuff said? I mean don't we all?"
Leyi R.,"Chicago, IL",17,3,,4.0,3/7/2015,"The ambience is great, a clean and spacey location. The food was average, just your typical sports bar food."
Robert B.,"Newport News, VA",8,143,,3.0,3/1/2015,"BJs is a chain brewery restaurant.  The beer and food are consistently four and maybe a half stars at all their locations for a reasonable price.  For a big open space the noise level is modest and atmosphere good.  Some locations offer good service.  Unfortunately, I had poor service at the McAllen location--slow, no sauce on burger, just not with it."
