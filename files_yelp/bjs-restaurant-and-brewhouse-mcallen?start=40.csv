Bridget P.,"McAllen, TX",0,23,,3.0,5/10/2013,This is the place for people who call their beer 'brewski.' Enough said.
P S.,"Brownsville, TX",0,1,1,5.0,4/11/2015,"Really nice place, very clean and service was spot on. Moroccan Salmon was excellent. Spicy and very tasty. Vegetables were crunchy and not over cooked."
Manuel G.,"Mission, TX",0,10,,5.0,3/9/2015,Great food and excellent service!  Management very attentive. They are very clean and organized.
Ace T.,"McAllen, TX",12,26,,1.0,3/30/2013,"The menu is too large (jack of all trades, master of none) with typical chain food.  As Bob said, it's sensory overload on a busy night with tons of TVs, each blaring a different channel. Also, bring a flare gun with you.  You'll need it to get the attention of your waiter.  Correction... ""a"" waiter, because you probably won't see the same one more than once. I ordered chili and it arrived at room temperature.  When it was brought to some random server's attention, I was told ""I'm not your waiter, but I'll take care of it for you.""   Apparently, hot food is an inconvenience. It came back piping hot on top of the bowl, with the bowl itself hot to the touch, but the inside still cold.  The microwave should be named employee of the month."
Nick T.,"McAllen, TX",1,9,,1.0,12/16/2015,"I am very dissapointed in this resturant. Bj's used to be a great place for pizza, wings, and beer.  Much of that has changed. We ordered the Bj's favorite pizza and were surprised to find the pizza is made without sauce. I asked if they forgot sauce and the server and manager both said pizza sauce was not used on Bj's pizzas. Pizza with no sauce? This went from being one  of the best pizzas in town to the worst. The wings tasted frozen and from a bag. The beer was ok but nothing I would run out to buy. There are some good restursnts on McAllen, Bj's, in my opinion, is no longer one of them."
Anna B.,"Austin, TX",1,32,2,3.0,5/5/2013,"The ceilings are high, the light is low and the prices are above average. Start with the menu: several pages, encased in vinyl and bound like a notebook. There is a lot to consider there but in the low light, I probably missed a few things. It's ironic, there was a lamp suspended right above us but still we could barely read the print on the menu. Our waitress was pleasant enough and checked on us often. But she's not the one who brought out the food. This must be one of those places where it takes a village to serve a meal. The food was okay, not bad, but nothing outstanding. The kitchen's approach to seasoning is not balanced: their chili is fairly bland but the CFS is overly salty and a little heavy on the garlic tones in the breading. Their fries are crispy shoestring-style and good. They use Roma tomatoes on their burgers so they have a bit of flavor. The ""huge"" baked potatoes are indeed huge. I would have appreciated being given the option of leaving off some toppings or having them on the side but mine came fully loaded, no turning back. Maybe if I could have read the menu more easily, I would have seen the full list so I will take some responsibility for that. The atmosphere is that of a slightly upscale sports bar trying to be a date place. There were women in sequins and stilettos; some men in suits, others in cargo shorts. There were a few children but I wouldn't really consider this to be a family restaurant, at least not on a weekend evening. The darkness and loud urban music would make my child uncomfortable. And the TVs? They have TVs alright, and there is no escaping them. The bar is prominently stocked with a large variety of higher-priced hard liquors. The bottle display is perhaps the most brightly lit area of the whole restaurant. You can easily tell what is important here.  The managers make a point to come over and greet customers. Ours said all the right things but his words seemed rehearsed, possibly scripted.  Over all, it's not a bad place but we don't expect to go back. It was not a great value for the money. The dining room is much too dark and the noise level (an odd mishmash of musical genres did not help) was a little too much. The place seems to appeal to the Generation Y types who like flash with their drinks and food."
Jason M.,"Donna, TX",5,16,1,4.0,8/18/2014,Always a good experience.   Service is great!  Food is good.  And the root beer is the best!
Trisha S.,"Mission, TX",30,50,12,5.0,2/15/2014,"Lately I have been taking 45-50 of my friends and neighbors to BJ's.  Last week I asked them if they would like to go to a different place for our monthly ladies luncheon and they all said no...we will stick with what we love.  We are always treated extremely well at BJ's.   They have the space all ready for us when they say they will and the waiters are excellent.  Their manager, Joe White takes very good care of us.   The food is beyond tasty and is served in a gourmet manner, not just flopped on the plate.  I haven't heard one complaint among the ladies and I myself LOVE BJ.s.  I think it is the best place in the Rio Grande Valley to eat.  My favorite is the Tuscan Chicken Limone.  YUMMY   We even go to BJ's in Vegas when we visit our son."
Omar A.,"Reynosa, Mexico",0,1,5,1.0,4/12/2012,El peor servicio en la ciudad no esperes que ningun mesero de origen latino o hispano como a ellos les gusta nombrarse te hable espaniol lo mas seguro que estos hijos de juan lopez se crean hijos de edward Longshanks The worst service in town do not expect that any latinos or hispanic waiters as they like to be called talk to you in spanish so this sons of juan lopez think they are descendents of Edward Longshanks
Jim C.,"Pensacola, FL",0,16,,5.0,7/3/2013,"We were in the Mission, TX area for 5 months recently and dined here on several occasions. The food and service were excellent. Their pizza is terrific and their beers are some of the best I have had. I am a fan of their Tatonka Stout. Had a conversation when I first went there with a manager about their beers. He seemed knowledgeable and was very helpful."
Kelly S.,"Austin, TX",2560,1557,7025,3.0,1/8/2012,"BJs is conveniently located by all the ""new"" stores on Ware rd. When you're out shopping, frustrated as hell by the wonky parking lot and disrespectful best buy shoppers, this is a decent spot to grab a table, some relatively inexpensive appetizers and a high ABV beer.  The service is usually decent, if unremarkable. My mom loves the sausage and basil flatbread so much that she ordered one as an appetizer for all of us and one for herself, for her meal. The avocado egg rolls are kinda boring as is the tortilla soup. My asian salad was okay as well.  All in all, not bad. The chain is pretty consistent across the board and I can appreciate that they are able to translate that across markets."
June D.,"McAllen, TX",6,14,1,3.0,3/15/2014,"Overrated... Overpriced... Just a plain chain restaurant that tries to have a million items on the menu that's just mediocre rather than focusing on a few items that are great.  I Wouldn't go back to this place..(maybe if I was in my early 20's and I thought this was a good restaurant to impress my date, just maybe)"
Jose S.,"McAllen, TX",93,235,129,4.0,5/2/2009,"BJ's is so good! The housebrews are really good [St. Arnold brews for them], always try their seasonals they are above average...  The Pizza is so good especially the ""Med Pizza."" I've had several different items and everything has always been YUM! The fish tacos are really good, I've had them a few times. The Cuban burger was okay-ish, the parmesan-crusted chicken was really good and I inhaled their pot roast sammich.  Ask for the Belgian Beer menu they offer around 10 different ones in bottle along w/ a few on tap.  Oh yeah if you go to a brewpub and order a bud-light... WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU???"
Abby E.,"Harlingen, TX",0,86,,1.0,1/24/2015,"I do have to say we were terribly disappointed with our experience at the restaurant. Food was bad , our orders got mixed up, we were over charged and service took forever. We will not return and do not recommend."
Drew P.,"Fort Worth, TX",2,15,12,5.0,1/22/2014,"Not gonna lie, what I most love about BJ's is their root beer! Their food can be a little pricier than most places, but it's still good! Pizzas and pastas are great, but my favorite dish is the Angel Hair Toscana!"
Happy T.,"Round Rock, TX",33,122,9,2.0,10/30/2013,Seriously is bad service just the norm in the valley.  Then you wait 5 mins to be attended to at a slow time.  Then in this day and age NO WIFI which is BJ's for F$&? Off.  They're salads are good and their own beers are not bad but not worth the time or effort.  Go to Mimi's Cafe for better food and better service.
Angie R.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,92,40,2.0,10/27/2013,Waitress was not pleasant and very forgetful! But Beja always has awesome food and drinks.. Too bad service was not that great
Art V.,"Portsmouth, NH",2,25,,3.0,7/11/2011,"I am updating this because I have been to some BJ's in other cities and have changed my mind on the franchise.   The beer is still pretty mediocre, although the IPA is certainly passable.  What I really like is their deep dish pizza and their cookie dessert.   I would still never go here for the beer, but if people wanted to go for dinner, I would be up for it and a couple of their beers are decent."
Jesse F.,"Los Angeles, CA",134,281,130,4.0,11/14/2012,"Mmmmm. BJ's is always good. This place is no exception. A little bit noisy and occasionally the staff seems kinda slow, but overall how could I hate on this place. Buffalo Chicken Pizza and some Tatonka in a pitcher. Life is good."
Bex F.,"San Antonio, TX",32,62,35,4.0,7/5/2010,"BEER! okay so there's 3 things you should go to BJ's for, and everything else can just be appreciated. 1)Beer 2)Pizza 3)Brewed Root Beer The beer is not actually brewed there, which is a huge misconception and I've had to correct a few ppl myself who think otherwise. The exposed cylinders to the right of the bar are actually Root Beer. The pizza is sooo good and I recommend the Mediterranean I would not steer you wrong. Any other Pizza is to die for as well. The bread has a foccaccia texture to it. Its infiltrated with butter in every bite or sense of taste bud you mite actively possess. The Fish tacos are huge and filled with cabbage. Ive ordered these quite a few times.  The Veggie burger again not anything special but not really any other option, so if you feel like a burger veggies, go for it. Beer recommendations **Brewhouse Blonde, its light and slightly malty. ***Piranha Pale Ale, you'll taste the hops in this one ****Jeremiah Red, ur Irish style beer, if ur in the mood, or maybe ur replacement for ur other Irish beer. *****Tatonka Stout; if ur bored from other stout, why not give this a try. they have a seasonal selection as well as imported draft beer! Also for two draft beers ur bill will be $11. I've only had bad service once, usually there's one server there who if you get here, you're lucky shes excellent. Best seat is at the bar, learn about beer, watch 6 different sports at once.  If you're looking for something more private ask to be seated towards the west side of the restaurant on the other side of the garage doors. You can stare at art if you want. and have conversations without the bar crowd. i like it over in that sections sometimes. Bj's is designed like a street corner shop, except the where the outside seating would be, is enclosed and they open up the doors so as to use it as a divider between the back room and the middle room.  note: My dad loves the Chicken Fried Steak here, believe me when i saw it i didn't have to ask why, if u got a tickling for it, give it a try as well."
