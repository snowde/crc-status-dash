Shsron F.,"Francis E. Warren AFB, WY",0,126,65,2.0,3/28/2012,I have had better food here in the past.  The vegetarian pizza lacked taste as did the shrimp thai wraps.  Stick to the hamburgers
Justin E.,"Harlingen, TX",16,15,10,1.0,7/31/2012,"This has got to be one of the worst restaurants I have ever visited. The customer service was HORRIBLE! First, our waiter took over 10-15 minutes JUST to come and welcome us and since we had a child, he forgot her menu, not once but 3 TIMES! We felt very rushed by him because he was very antsy and constantly looking around and checking the time. When we put in our drink order, he took a while to come back for our food order. When he returned I had already finished my first drink and placed the glass at the end of the table for him to take to refill. I SAW him glance at it and ignore it. He passed by it about 2 or 3 times before I finally had to tell him that I wanted a refill. I had ordered Strawberry Lemonade and let me tell you, I've had better. I should of seriously just gone down on restaurant and eat at Cheddar's. Anyway, we put in our orders, My friend and I's entree was Fettuccine Chicken Alfredo, Macaroni for the little girl, and my other friend had dessert because he had already eaten earlier.  The food arrives and we requested ketchup because the little one had gotten potato wedges. The Alfredo was so bland and tasteless even with salt and pepper. The chicken was alright, but the bread that comes with it was so hard! Well the little girl preferred the Alfredo since my friend didn't like it, so they traded. As soon as she puts her fork in the plate, she pulls out a large piece of plastic that looked like it was from a microwavable bag, since it had heating directions. Needless to say, she did not eat that. When the waiter comes back, ages later, we had to request ketchup a second time and the manager. When he returns, he said the manager would be there shortly. I did not see him go tell the manager till about 10 minutes later. The manager shows up and I explain to him our situation and he immediately begins to apologize profusely, which I appreciated, and he asked if we wanted to replace the meal, we decided against it and he said it would be taken off our ticket, which it was.   All in all, I was not very pleased, and the bill was ridiculous. $14 for a plate of tasteless pasta! We will more than likely not be returning for a VERY long time!"
Bob D.,"Juneau, AK",0,33,,2.0,2/19/2013,"The beer was below-average for a microbrew.  Slightly better than industrial beer. The food was hit-or-miss.  Pizzas were OK, crusts were soggy.  Ribs were awful.  Soup was OK.  Chicken Parmesan was the best meal at the table. If you like being surrounded by ten different TV's on ten different stations, then the atmosphere might appeal to you, otherwise..."
Stan J.,"Weimar, TX",0,7,,4.0,1/16/2013,"Ok- calamari appetizer was as good as any I've ever had. If I didn't know better I would have thought they had a connection with the guys in California who have been catching squid by the hundreds. Good wine selection, had a very good Russian Valley Chardonnay. Jackie was my waitress, I never had to ask for anything, she anticipated it before I could ask. The kinda bad news- the chef needs to take a trip to Lafayette, LA. Adding 1.5 pounds of green onions to a tomato sauce and pouring it over pasta does not a Cajun pasta make. It was really bland. Google Cayenne. Music, atmosphere and waitstaff covered for you."
Steven F.,"Harlingen, TX",0,5,1,2.0,7/7/2014,"Service is horrible. This was our first time at the restaurant and we were underwhelmed. We were seated promptly, but that is the only thing that happened with any sense or urgency. We ordered our drinks and didn't see our waitress again for 15 minutes. We were about to get up and leave when she finally showed back up. We ordered and my girlfriend got a salad, which did come out first, but 30 seconds later my meal came out. Hers didn't come out for another 5 minutes, and I didn't touch my plate until she got hers, because it just seems wrong when your date hasn't gotten her plate yet. This is all happening at 2:30 pm on a Monday; place is dead and can't get anything right. I got the jalapeño burger and it was bland, at best. My girlfriend got the angel hair pasta with grilled chicken and liked it a lot.  In short, I wouldn't recommend this place if you're looking to grab a bite to eat with good service. If you're gonna sit at the bar and watch a game for a long time, then the slow service won't bother you."
John B.,"Harlingen, TX",0,21,,3.0,9/11/2012,"BJ's has always been one of our Valley favorites, usually worth the drive from Harlingen. The food is consistently good (not great) and the service OK. We sometimes watch a major sports event on their 100"" TV while eating in the bar. We also order takeout once or twice a month. Several of our favorites are pot stickers, sesame chicken salad, egg rolls, wings, and pizza. I'm surprised BJ's isn't ranked higher than #14 in McAllen. It would be in the top three in Harlingen.  9/11/12 UPDATE -- Takeout last evening was worst ever. Pot stickers were bland and the sesame chicken salad (price raised to $13) was tasteless. To make matters worse they packed about 3/4 normal dressing after I asked for extra dressing! This will be our last visit for a while because it's no longer worth the 34 mile drive from Harlingen."
Josh G.,"McAllen, TX",0,5,3,5.0,1/6/2011,"BJ's is one of my favorite restataunts for a number of reasons: 1. The food is always cooked to perfection. 2. No one can beat the number and quality of specialty drinks 3. You never feel crowded, as the restaraunt has an open airy feel wherever you are seated. 4. The menu is huge, and you can find something new and interesting try every time you go. Don't miss out on this wonderful dining experience- you won't be let down. P. S. The low noise level and atmosphere definitly pushed this one up to a 5. My favorite drink is the root beer, which has unlimited refills, is made by the restaurant, and is served in a chilled mug. Chicken pot stickers are a great appetizer that you don't find in many places. BJs is famous for their deep-dish pizzas, which can be filled with any number and combination of ingredients, and range in size based on the number in your party- and are DELICIOUS (meat lovers takes on a whole new meaning at BJS). Staff is also very friendly, helpful, and attentive. Top it all off with a famous pizookie for dessert- a warm cookie topped with ice cream to delight your tastebuds!"
Cayenne C.,"League City, TX",46,118,9,2.0,5/2/2011,"The first couple of times we came here, it was pretty good. So good, in fact, that we also visited the location in Clear Lake (Houston area/Baybrook Mall) when visiting family. The beer and pizza were quite good. But in the past 3 months, we've been twice, and had issues with our food. Both times, the food was way undercooked, when we finally received it. After speaking with the manager (who appeared already aware of our plight), we were offered a half off deal for our meals I actually felt sorry for the manager, as it seemed that he had dealt with this same issue too many times. After speaking with friends, we learned that they, too, had had this same experience in recent months. So if each party of at least two gets a half off discount--how are these people making any money? I don't think the franchise is being properly supervised. The food and beer are good--but we may not go back."
Quani C.,"Austin, TX",588,476,64,4.0,9/25/2008,"For the first time in my history of Yelp, I felt inspired to leave a ""You've Been Yelped"" card... and this was the place.  It's new to the area and the first of it's kind around here, as well. Location is primo, near the convention center and a plethora of new shops.  We stopped by after a quick trip the Target around the corner.  Our waitron, Levi, was fantastic.  He was courteous (even calling me ma'am once... shudder) and VERY knowledgeable about the house beers.  I had to try to figure out if it was rehearsed or if he actually knew that much about each of those beers, a total of seven.  I opted for a beer sampler to get a feel for things and he brought me a mini sample of the Octoberfest gratis as well (ask for a scoche, that's what they call it).  Beers were tasty, I think the pale ale was my favorite.  The others were pretty similar to each other, but not too memorable.  Their porter is very smoky. The menu houses a wide variety of foods from deep dish pizzas, to burgers, to sandwiches, to pastas, to typical pub fare.  I had fish and chips, which were offered with malt vinegar.  I also had my choice of wedge fries or crispy, thin fries... I went for the wedge.  The fish was well battered without being over the top, heart attack inducing.  My mom had the patty melt and says that it was ""very good with crispy, grilled bread.""   It was pretty dead at the time we visited, but it was between lunch and dinnertime, so it was understandable.  The restaurant was impeccably clean and dark, almost formal feeling... but not really. I think I may stop by for another pint sometime."
Richard W.,"Weslaco, TX",18,104,229,5.0,5/2/2009,I personally love this place!  In my defense though I've only had the pizza and the hamburgers. Awesome. The California burger is so fricking good even with chicken instead. The pizzas are awesome although they are a touch expensive.   The pizookie dessert is simple yet decadent and you are helping charity by ordering it.  I haven't tried their specialty beer as of yet but someday I will make the plunge
Marco C.,"McAllen, TX",0,5,2,1.0,9/22/2013,"Was a not happy with my most recent experience at BJ's. The servers section was way to big for on server, our food took over 2 hours for 3 people and the food was ok. The problem in my opinion is management."
Andrew D.,"Chattanooga, TN",2,16,,4.0,1/1/2011,"Good Brewhouse with a large menu. I like to sit in the bar for a more relaxed atmosphere. Large food servings for a descent price. Would recommend for a date, casual business meeting, or to watch a game with friends."
Heidi A.,"Orlando, FL",58,188,54,4.0,3/18/2010,"The host was very cordial, and the service was great. The food was also really good, with lots of choices on the menu, and the drinks, truly sublime. Highly recommend this place if you are ever in South Texas!"
Franco T.,"Mission, TX",24,42,31,3.0,8/16/2010,"I heard that their specialty is the pizza, so I ordered a personal pizza. I didn't think it was all that. I only ate about half of it cuz it was frankly disappointing. I did like my strawberry lemonade though, it was very good. The ambiance is great though, it's a good place to bring your friends."
Mia G.,"Ypsilanti, MI",2,17,3,4.0,7/3/2009,"First time visitor here and I would recommend dining at BJ's!  The restaurant itself was clean and the staff was friendly.  We chose to dine at BJ's because  1.) I had a customer appreciation gift card that turned out to be $10!! and  2.) I was craving pizza and heard theirs was delicious. We were lucky enough to arrive during happy hour which is M-F 3pm-7pm (I think) $1 off draft beers, $2 off all appetizers, and mini pizza's were half price! WOOOOHOOOOO!!!! My friend and I took advantage of the drafthouse and had blonde beer.  It was pretty good and really strong (about 5% alcohol according to our server). And I believe it, because I only needed one to feel flushed. ;) Our Appetizer: Pirahna Nachos!! They were HUGE and REALLY GOOD!. Not at all greasy. The salsa on the side was my favorite touch!  Entrees: I had BJ's Favorite mini pizza which comes with meats and veggies. I LOVED IT!! Loaded with toppings and nice soft bread. MMM!! My friend had The Great White mini pizza that had alfredo sauce and chicken. She liked it too.  Overall, I really enjoyed the meal and had good service. AND since it was Happy Hour, our pizzas came out to $5 bucks a pop! That's cheaper than Little Ceasar's ""Hot & Ready"" and the taste is INCOMPARABLE!!  I also thought the ambience was great. Oh and I freaking loved the revolving door at the entrance!! lol (yeah, I need to get out of the valley..)"
Antonio Z.,"Lake Jackson, TX",28,305,8,2.0,11/14/2008,"Pizza and Beer the classy way. Expect a $20 tab for 2 beers and a personal pizza. DO NOT order anything else. When I first went and ordered the Fish Tacos I was blown away by how good they were. Second time around...a friggin' fishstick in a tortilla, no joke! From lightly breaded, golden gems of halibut....to fishsticks. Down with this place, just go to Macaroni Grill next door if you're looking to eat some good food for a reasonable price. Two stars for the beers that albeit good...overpriced."
