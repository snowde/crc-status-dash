Barb F.,"Melbourne, FL",453,105,8,4.0,7/11/2017,"I""d give the food 3 stars... not terrible but, similar to things you'd find at a chain restaurant. I ordered a flat bread and a salad and it was decent. I gave them an extra star because our waiter, Brent was GREAT! He was fun, friendly and made sure we had everything we needed.  I will go back because it is good for groups and really affordable."
Da Q.,"Brooklyn, NY",42,32,51,4.0,12/26/2017,This place is super awesome... From the food menu to the waiters / waitresses to the drink menu's with a completely full bar. I'm very impressed with the taste and quality of the food and staff... This place has a great vibe. I highly recommend and I'm very hard to please.
Daniel H.,"Pinellas Park, FL",0,11,11,4.0,10/15/2017,Good food but a little upscale. Many varieties of draft beer. Our server was attentive but did not describe some food items adequately
Aracely M.,"Colorado Springs, CO",1,20,27,1.0,8/28/2017,"Disappointing! Was looking forward to enjoying a burger w/ fries and waitress, although very sweet, forgot the fries/utensils. Burger buns were cold, no barbecue sauce on burger & cole slaw? Are you serious? It was very brown & very dry. I truly have never felt so disgusted after leaving what's supposed to be a really, nice, classy restaurant with great food. I feel like just making myself throw up! Will definately be sending the pictures I took and send to corporate!"
Manny C.,"Casselberry, FL",230,43,62,5.0,11/22/2017,Amazing service and fantastic food! Came here for BJ brews on Wednesday for $4 amazing. I recommend the BJs Hefeweizen which is smooth and light. I had the spicy peanut chicken and soba Noodles. It was amazing. I forgot to take a picture because it was so delicious but I highly recommended. Ask for Brittany when you come here. Outstanding waitress. Definitely a must if you're in town.
Barbara M.,"Melbourne, FL",0,14,16,5.0,11/10/2017,"First time there for the veterans meal and one free beer. You have to go to their website and they send a code for the free beer. My husband really liked getting a free beer. They also don't limit what you can order like most places. You get $12.95 off you meal. Hubby had a hamburger and fries, so mush he couldn't finish. I had the Jambalaya was nice and spicy. Rather than wait for a table we sat down at the bar. The service was just as good and no waiting for a table. This is one place we will be glad to return to ."
Meg B.,"Melbourne, FL",0,7,,4.0,11/1/2017,"My boyfriend and I love coming here to enjoy a nice meal every once in a while. It's a bit pricey for some certain dishes, example: the spaghetti and meatballs is almost the same price as a sirloin steak, but that's a very minor complaint. The staff is very accommodating and we never run into any problems with this place. So many different menu options to choose from and everything is delicious!"
Jen W.,"Melbourne, FL",80,25,22,4.0,1/16/2017,"We have enjoyed this restaurant since it opened. Their food is always good and worth a bit of a slow wait staff. Their app and rewards program is handy. You can put your name on the wait list right from your phone.  I must give one down side. The entree quality does seem to be slipping. I had the ahi tuna salad tonight and the amount of tuna was about half of the first salad I had when they opened. The salad was great, but a little disappointing. We have noticed this with other entrees.  They do have good desserts meant for sharing. So whether a night with friends or dessert with the kids, this is a good experience."
Marcello S.,"Palm Bay, FL",12,5,4,5.0,6/16/2017,This is a great place to have pizza. We love the atmosphere. Service is always great. Ask for Che.
Michael M.,"Orlando, FL",260,1027,1636,3.0,4/17/2016,"I arrived with a group of eight and I was told it would only take 10 minutes to get a table for a late lunch. The place was busy but not packed. 30 minutes later we were seated. Our server was very friendly and helpful with the menu. I am notba fan of their beer so ordered a cocktail and it was delivered in a reasonable amount of time. I wanted to sample a few apps so I ordered the calamari, root beer ribs, and a wedge salad. The food took forever!!!  The calamari was very good but the mayo base dipping sauce was a total fail. The root beer ribs were off the hook delicious and I really should have made a double order. The wedge salad was good but could have used just a drizzle of balsamic. A good experience but there is room for improvement."
Tiffany D.,"Tallahassee, FL",16,5,,3.0,9/30/2017,"Probably my last visit to this restaurant. Nothing is really good here which is a shame because it has a good ambiance. Ordered the bacon guacamole burger sans mayo, cooked medium rare. My son ordered same item but with mayo, cooked medium. Guess what- both had mayo and the kitchen runner could have cared less what the burger temp was. Sides were left off, too. No silverware, had to request drink refills (some were alcoholic so you'd think that would be a no brainer for the server). Pointed out issues to server who said, ""Oh, ok."" SMH"
Harvey K.,"Melbourne, FL",7,22,,4.0,11/10/2017,"First time there today ! Highly recommend  great apps, wide variety on the menu, and all was on point !! Zak was a great server, and we will return soon. Great draft beers, guac was great, fish and chips were above expect ions and the ahi tuna salad was excellent  !  Harv and  Donna"
Janet G.,"Melbourne, FL",8,16,14,2.0,11/11/2016,"For the life of me I can't figure out how this Sysco food truck vittles could rank a 4 or 5! I had the previously frozen spinach stuffed mushrooms. They were the size of a nickel! That's not a stuffed mushroom! I had to look hard to find anything in them! The rest of the Fam got Mac n cheese (kraft) chicken wings with watered down ranch dip, it was just heated up boxed processed food. We got there at 5:30, seated immediately & waited 40 min on our food! So the waiter comes to apologize saying the kraft Mac n cheese was the hold up! It's one thing if you are drinking but we were not!  Crazy people if you think this is REAL food..... they do not have anything special although the menu weighs 10#! Go to Wal-mart frozen food section & pop a PBR....at home."
Meghan Y.,"Palm Bay, FL",1,7,,3.0,6/24/2017,"Sat at the bar thinking that the service would be quick at 1 pm on a Sunday, but instead we sat for 30 minutes waiting to order lunch.  To be fair the first round and menus arrived promptly, but it seemed like that was the extent of their training.  After 30 minutes the wait just isn't worth it so we left and went next door to the Outback instead. We even tried to talk to the manager on the way out but as soon as he made eye contact he quickly walked off in the opposite direction.  We have been to many other locations with no issue, but this location just doesn't cut it.  Next time we will just drive to the Orlando location. Update: they have gotten better with time, but the service is still spotty, management seems to have changed, which is good."
Kristina T.,"Palm Bay, FL",5,100,13,3.0,6/4/2017,"I do really enjoy BJ's, I love to get their appetizer sampler. However, their service here is very hit or miss and the food can be just okay at times, plus it can be pretty expensive. When I do go here I like to get their meat flatbread, really good. Also their Pizookie desserts are always very tasty."
Jean P.,"East Bridgewater, MA",6,37,116,5.0,12/9/2016,"Visited this restaurant on 3 different occasions and the service and food were excellent each time. They have a huge menu, dozens of cocktails and beer selections and a wide variety of food choices for even the most selective of customers.  The Honey Sriracha Brussel sprouts were worth ordering more then once - they are awesome. The Flatbread Pizza was good but the deep dish pizza was mouth watering and outstanding! The entrees were plentiful and served hot and without a lengthy wait, even on a Friday night. I would highly recommend this restaurant."
Tila D.,"Melbourne, FL",101,107,317,4.0,4/8/2016,"Hubby & I gave them a try, we were a little hesitant due to some of the previous reviews but I had a person tell me about their experience and their food so we thought we would give them a try.  We were not disappointed at all! Our server was Blake, he was friendly, quick and very helpful with explaining some of the many choices on the menu. My food was good, the spinach/artichoke dip was a little plain but it was hot. I had the hickory brisket & burger and it was AWESOME and the crispy thin fries were delish!! Hubby had the New Orleans and he really enjoyed. There was a little issue at the table behind us with an unwanted guest but the manager apologized and took care of the problem. I do look forward to eating here again."
K P.,"Melbourne, FL",0,15,9,4.0,6/5/2017,"We don't eat at many chain restaurants but we sure love BJ's. This is a great place to go with a group big or small because they menu has such a wide variety of different types of foods, to keep everyone happy. Never had anything we didn't like. Service can be a little slow though."
Elaine K.,"Fairfield, CA",0,33,2,3.0,4/11/2017,It is pretty good for a chain restaurant. I like that they are open late. The quality of food is consistent from visit to visit. Service is average. The menu is huge so you should be able to find something you like.
Lake In The Woods A.,"Melbourne, FL",15,3,3,5.0,12/26/2016,"Love their fried chicken salad...everything cut up and diced nice and small, easy to eat!!! Brussel Sprouts are amazing and fried artichokes...What a hit!!!"
Karla C.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,3,,5.0,5/8/2017,"The reason I came to this BJ's is because I loved the one down near Boca, and this location is great as well! The menu is quite large so it's not hard to satisfy different tastes. Apps and flatbreads are great and I love the chicken cobb salad! I do modify it slightly and they seem to be okay with that. Their root beer is awesome, service is great...no complaints !"
Lalena B.,"Las Vegas, NV",237,232,781,4.0,1/9/2016,"Experience:  I've been to a BJ's before, but a new one opened close to my family's house and I decided to force them to try it.   Facility:  this just opened a few months ago, so it's pristine. The restaurant feels very open but still a little dim ambience. It has mostly dark woods in the decor. There's a large bar with about 50 taps, and booths, chairs and tables in the adjacent dining area.  Service: Jasmine was our waitress and she was a sweetie. She did forget our bread and we had to re-ask for our appetizer after the cooks made a mistake, but other than that, she was a great, friendly waitress.  Food:  we thought we were going to order beer, but saw two margaritas we had to try instead. We got an appetizer, but filled up too much to eat our meals. So typical. LOL!  --Jalapeño Cucumber Margarita - 5/5 - LOVED this!!!  It was just the right balance of tart, spicy and refreshing. It had fresh cucumber and jalapeño slices in it. LOVED --Watermelon Basil Margarita - 2/5 - Although the flavors were nice, this had a heavy sweet flavor I could not drink. Just too sweet!!! Not sure if they add sugar or it's the watermelon syrup, but I was looking for a lightly-sweet watermelon flavor the way fresh watermelon juice is.  --Sriracha Queso Dip with Pork Salsa Verde - 5/5 - so good!  I loved the Queso and salsa; however, the pork was pretty nonexistent. Still a yummy dish.  Rack of ribs with Root Beer BBQ sauce - these were great!! They had to add the root beer sauce on top of the pre-basted ribs, but it was really good!!   --Sides with ribs: Brussel sprouts and French fries - 4/5 - I liked both. The fries are thin skinny fries and were lukewarm, but still tasty. The Brussel sprout were not bitter at all and roasted good.  Overall:  good food, nice waitress and great drinks!!! I would definitely come back again. Maybe not this location in FL, as I live in NV, but I really like BJs restaurants!"
Ashley W.,"Melbourne, FL",4,3,,3.0,3/13/2017,"Food is good and our server, Brent, was excellent. Super friendly and quick. However, after noticing there was no soap in the ladies room I informed one of the servers. 20 min later, still no soap, so I informed the hostess. She said she would take care of it right away. 40 min pass and we're getting ready to leave. Use the restroom one last time before the drive home and realize that still no one had filled the soap in the ladies room. Also, there was no toilet paper in the stall I was using. I then asked to speak with a manager to make sure it would get taken care of. The manager was rude, offered no apology but basically blew me off. Disappointed with their management."
Dennis W.,"Melbourne, FL",0,1,,1.0,9/4/2017,"I anticipated a nice place to have a few brews,  and walked into a foul smelling funky restaurant. I initially thought the smell would go away, but I couldn't bear to sit in there and got sick to my stomach. It smells like an old dirty mop that has been left in an old bucket and has went sour. I don't know how people eat in there!! The manager should be relieved of their duties and have a cleaning crew come in and clean that place from top to bottom. What a shame. I won't be back."
Eric R.,"Longwood, FL",197,165,119,5.0,2/12/2016,"BJ's was awesome. I had the most amazing Brussel Sprout appetizer you could imagine. A combination of sauté and crispness.  I'll go back just for those. They have a complete range of craft beers from light to Stout and my favorite red and amber ales. For dinner I had the fish tacos... Again, amazing.  I'll definitely be back next time I visit Melbourne and will try one closer to home in Orlando."
Shelly S.,"Julian, CA",0,4,,1.0,6/25/2017,Worst to go service of any restaurant I've ever patronized. I swear if they drop a pizza on the floor they still send it home to someone. And they simply do not care! Last time I ordered I waited for 10 minutes beyond when my order was to be done and they brought out a cold pizza. Waited for a fresh pizza and no discount offered from the manager.
Erin R.,"Longwood, FL",0,13,,4.0,3/12/2017,"Very nice place. Clean restraunt and good bathrooms. Professional and respectful servers and staff, and good food. They have a wide variety of food on their menu such as pizza, burgers, BBQ, fish, soup in bread bowls, steak and ribs. It has a Detroit/Chicago/industrial style. My only complaint would be my fries were not crunchy enough. However, that is minor and they were still pretty good. I had the bacon and guacamole burger and my husband had the chilli in a bread bowl. They also have a wide selection of alcohol. If you join their rewards program with the app   you can get a free dessert."
Galen M.,"Cocoa, FL",45,7,,4.0,2/26/2017,"The atmosphere is great.  Very minimalistic seating, arranged so that it never seems to full even when it's busy. Nice colorful bar too. The food is like a carbon copy of TGI Friday's, so not too much originality going on there. My only valid complaint is that something was up with their beers. I ordered one of the kinds they make, and the accidentally brought me a Stella. Both had this weird sort of smell and flavor to them that I can only attribute to taps that need to be cleaned? I don't know. Overall, nice place! But don't expect to get anything you've never seen before."
Ken H.,"Orlando, FL",248,83,76,4.0,9/26/2016,"I haven't had the desire to go to BJ's because I've always related it to the wholesale grocery store and in my head, it just didn't evoke hunger and food cravings.  My wife came across one of their coupons so we decided to give it a try.   The atmosphere is very cool and casual.  There are tv's on the walls all around the perimeter playing live sports.  There is a full service bar serving up whatever you feel like drinking, including, of course, their own brand of handcrafted beer.  I'm not much of a beer drinker but I did try the Nutty Brewnette and it was a great accompaniment to my dinner.   The only problem I had with the seating is that we were in a booth along a half wall and there were also booths on the other side of the wall so it was almost as if you were eating at the same table as these other people.  It was a little distracting and you don't get much privacy in those particular seats.   The menu doesn't have anything earth-shatteringly original but they do have a pretty extensive selection of foods.  I decided on the half slab of pork ribs which came with 2 sides.  What I was very happy to see is that they allow you to choose a bowl of one of their soups as one of your sides.  Most places will allow you to add on a cup of soup for a certain amount or try to upcharge you if you want the soup as your side.  Here, it's included as a side with no extra charge.  I chose the clam chowder and also the white cheddar mashed potatoes.  I'm not the biggest pork ribs fan because to me they are usually too tender, almost fatty, but these were as good as one can expect to get.  The barbeque sauce was quite delicious.  The mashed potatoes were a little on the pasty side but did have a good white cheddar taste.  No complaints at all with the clam chowder.  It was perfectly seasoned and had the perfect viscosity.   For desert, they have their Pizookie's which are cookies baked in individual miniature pizza type pans with ice cream served on top.  We got 3 mini's and chose the monkey bread, the salted caramel, and the peanut butter.  They were out of this world.  The cookies are crispy on the outside and so moist on the inside.  I never leave room for desert but was so glad I did this time.   Also, they have an app and a rewards program where you can earn points and get free stuff."
Debra F.,"Grant-Valkaria, FL",113,115,1133,5.0,6/12/2016,"Love the food here. Lots of entrees featuring ingredients I love- quinoa, salmon, shrimp...Everything I have ever had tastes very fresh. Service has always been great. We also admit getting the beer sampler more than once!"
Ian W.,"Melbourne, FL",0,6,8,5.0,7/23/2015,"This has always been a family favorite, but up until now was only when we went to Orlando. This location seems a tad smaller than their Orlando Millenia location, but the food (Peanut Butter S'mores Pizookie!!!) food is spot on for BJs. Try each of the beers if you have a driver ;) Definitely some issues with service, but I went during opening week, so that is expected."
Jenny B.,"Gainesville, FL",0,3,,3.0,6/18/2017,"We had dinner at BJ's on a Saturday at 5:00.  The server was very nice and very helpful.  However, there were 11 of us and we all ordered at the same time, including appetizers.   My food came out rather quickly.  But, this was all they brought out initially.   About ten minutes later, they brought out the chips and salsa and then about twenty minutes later, they brought the rest of our party's food.   A couple of items never came out, but they did not charge us for these items.   The food tasted good, but they were rather disorganized, even not being very busy in the restaurant."
Frank M.,"Stockholm, Sweden",3,5,1,5.0,6/14/2016,"Really good service. They made a grilled burger melt on order, something they haven't done before, but was in a menu 3-4 years ago. That I call customer focus at its best. Really recommended."
Angie J.,"Weatherford, TX",0,6,,2.0,11/21/2016,This place is overpriced. This is the second time I've been here and have been disappointed both times. I didn't write a review the first time because it was opening night so I assumed they just needed some time but a year later   pasta came with 5 small shrimps and is was soupy an
Jon M.,"Indialantic, FL",21,127,,1.0,11/4/2015,"Wow.  I just cannot believe I paid $15 for a salad.  WTF?!  It was measly, not fresh, and had a few pieces of ahi in it.  This is the last time I will go to this place since it seems like every time I go I pay a lot of money for mediocre food and small portions.  The last time I went I paid way too much for a burger that was just ""okay"".  It's a burger!  You put some cheese on it, some bacon, maybe some vegetables and there ya go.  Just adding some avocado, maybe some different cheese, and an ""organic"" vegetable on it doesn't make it worth almost $20.   Seriously, just slapping the word ""craft"" on anything doesn't mean you can charge high prices and get away with it for too long.  Over time people, who are not idiots, will catch on to you.  And yes, they do have a good beer selection...but do so many other places nowadays.   It's not really that big of a deal that they have a million types of beers.  You can't drink them all in one day.   This is a chain, and the food I have gotten here is on par with a Chili's....another chain.  If you go here regularly you likely are: 1)  A douche who wears team jerseys more than one day a week 2)  A douche with a ""phone holster"" 3)  A douche who thinks that your superior palate for esoteric beers makes you better than everyone else."
Laila B.,"Winter Garden, FL",0,96,18,2.0,9/11/2016,"My first visit to this location.. 40+ min drive by the way. The server was not very welcoming...I'm not sure if it was us or maybe he was new. He asked questions which I didn't mind but this wasn't my first visit ever, I'm pretty familiar with the menu so...questioning me about the way I ordered something made me feel a little agitated. Was actually looking forward to ordering desert...he didn't even ASK. Trying to hurry up and get us out or were you not thinking about it? Either way, was happy to leave. Food was good...wasn't a fan of the closeness of other ppl where we were seated and service was..ok."
Nicolas T.,"Melbourne, FL",8,96,2,2.0,9/27/2015,"The spotty service here limits one's ability to enjoy the good food. We've now been here twice, and both visits were plagued by the same problem: unresponsive servers who made a lot of errors. Any request a member of our table had -- right down to requesting some mustard for a burger -- went totally ignored. The deep dish pizzas are priced high at $10 for the smallest one and $15 for the second-smallest, but are tasty nonetheless. Their in-house beers are awesome.  Hopefully in the future the service catches up to the food, because you need both components to have a successful restaurant."
Heather H.,"Palm Bay, FL",30,3,,3.0,4/24/2016,"It's ok, but pricey for what you get. I asked for an alcoholic root beer, which they didn't have, asked for some time to think about my drink selection since they didn't have what I wanted. The bartender never inquired again, so I stuck with water, a bit of a missed opportunity for them.  We shared appetizers, the lettuce wraps came with bland, tasteless iceburg lettuce, could have been so much better with any other kind of lettuce, portion was on the small side. The ahi tuna poke was pretty good as far as portion size, the fried wonton it came with were good, but would have been better if there was a seasoning on the tuna or a sauce to drizzle over it."
Rebecca K.,"Jacksonville, FL",22,23,1,4.0,2/29/2016,"BJ's is good, its very busy, be prepared to wait 30+ minutes on the weekends. The beer selection is great. The food has been great every time. I have gotten pizza, burgers, wings and I would say the burgers were the best overall.  The mozzarella sticks were also great, they give you a lot and you dont feel like you were ripped off. Calamari was chewy, I wouldn't recommend. The flatbread pizza is ok, go for the deepdish instead."
Tonya H.,"Palm Bay, FL",135,282,546,2.0,8/9/2015,"I do not even know where to begin....I let's start with the pros.....cool place to go if you like beer. They had a ton of beer on tap and they offer a flight of 4, 5 oz pours for $7.95.  Their happy hour ended at 6:00 pm, which was a bummer ( I missed by only a few minutes, because I thought it was 7pm. But it did offer $3 for 2 of their craft beers on tap and $50 shareable apps, and mini pizzas. I have to admit that's all the pros I have because the rest of the experience goes down hill :(. Mom and I opted for the calamari for an app.  You know it's bad when the server comes over with her face squished up because the food was burnt.  She stated it never comes out looking that dark.  It was greasy, gummy, and not crispy at all. I asked the server for some recommendations, she stated after 2 weeks she had only tasted 1 meal and that the restaurant did not offer the servers samples of the food before the restaurant opened.... We move on the meal....The deep dish sweet pig pizza.  I had high hopes for this one as many people there ordered the pizza and it looked decent.  However, I was sadly disappointed.  Now I like butter as much as the next southern girl, but I don't want my pizza to taste like it.  Not to mention as I ate the meal, I kept thinking that something was off with the taste but could not put my finger on it.  We then looked a the menu...and they forgot to add the pineapple to the pizza which was clearly in the description (and I loves my pineapple).  So disappointed.  I forgot to mention we had the stuffed mushrooms, which were just ok.  The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because the server without me prompting, or asking her.  Found the manager and was able to have the calamari and pizza taken off the bill. Kudos to her!  The mixed drinks are also pricey, pomegranted martini (which tasted like a tart slurpee) was $10. I wanted to like this place, but sadly I don't think I'll return."
