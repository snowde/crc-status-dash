Rachel C.,"Melbourne, FL",25,4,4,2.0,9/20/2015,"I need to start off by saying that the ribs were delicious - tender, moist, and flavorful. Those delicious ribs are the sole reason this place is receiving two stars as opposed to one because everything else was pretty horrid. From the absent server to the bone-dry mashed potatoes to the overcooked, shriveled asparagus, all the way down to the completely uncaring, useless manager, this place just fails.  We had a party of three and were sat in a booth in the bar area. Right off the bat we ordered waters and a beer, and the beer took a good ten minutes to get to the table despite the restaurant (and bar) being pretty dead. There were only a handful of tables sat throughout the entire restaurant with more than enough wait staff to cover. Waiting on our server for no apparent reason was definitely the trend for the night. The other two members of my party ordered a half rack of ribs and when we received our food their racks were considerably different, so the person with the 2/3 sized rack asked about it. Eventually the waitress came back and told us the cook just made a mistake when cutting them. That was it. No solution offered.  She did ask the manager to stop by our table, but this only made things worse. The manager did not apologize, did not bother to fake a smile/good attitude, and she failed to even ASK about our experience AT ALL. She simply said she would bring out more ribs (keeping in mind we informed the waitress at the very beginning of the meal and the manager couldn't be bothered to stop by until long after we'd finished our food and were just waiting idly with our partially consumed plates). Had she asked about our experience she would have learned about the unsavory side dishes and extended wait times. The waitress eventually stopped by to ask if the manager had come over and started to leave after we answered yes - we had to flag her down to ask for our checks. When the manager brought the ribs to the table, she again failed to offer an apology or ask about our experience - just dropped the bag at the table and left.  The icing on the cake is happening now - we arrived home and opened up the ribs to try and uplift the evening, and unlike the ribs we enjoyed in the restaurant, these are chewy and burnt from being thrown on high heat. Fail."
Tiffany L.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,3,,2.0,8/8/2015,"This was a poor experience, which is sad because I'm not typically a complainer, and we were so looking forward to trying this restaurant. We waited quite a long time for our food once our table ordered, and when my top sirloin steak came out, it was extremely over cooked. I sent it back and waited 30+ minutes for another. By the time it came, everyone else was long since finished with their meal. Although it was cooked better the second time around, it was a dense, sinewy cut of meat. I found I had about 6 edible bites. There was no effort on behalf of our server to give any kind of break on our bill due to the steak or the wait. I understand the restaurant is new but customer service is key. I won't be back for their food - all 3 of us who ate together agreed our meals weren't up to par."
Pat S.,"Malabar, FL",0,1,,2.0,9/13/2015,Ordered a chicken Alfredo pasta. The garlic bread was hard and cold. Asked the waiter for fresh bread since our original waitress wasn't around. He told her the message and she brought out new garlic bread.. But it was still cold. Had to ask her again for fresh bread got it the 3rd time. My friend ordered. Shrimp scampi pasta and it didn't have any taste. When we told the waiter he said they got a lot of complaints on that menu item and there's bread crumbs in the pasta which doesn't take appetizing. She asked for root beer WINGS and they brought out root beer RIBS but she settles because she also like wings. Rate this restaurant a 2 for today's service. We went at 11:30 am on a Sunday so it wasn't too busy. I was hoping for great food I'm not sure if I will return.
Nancy L.,"Titusville, FL",1,22,,2.0,10/24/2015,"Asked server if items could be prepared without cilantro.  It seemed to be an ingredient that was in most items (lost one star for that alone).  Server said oh yes, of course.  So I ordered fish tacos, no cilantro.  I asked for all sauces to be separate because they inevitably serve sauces loaded with cilantro.  Food arrives.....the lettuce was chopped and thoroughly mixed with a significant amount of cilantro.  The salsa they brought also had cilantro.  Not sure what it means to say ""no cilantro.""  I pointed it out and asked for lettuce sans cilantro.  Brought small amount of lettuce (no onions, tomato, or anything else).  Half my food was left as I tired o picking cilantro out of the mixed up mess.  Lose the cilantro and honor your customers' requests.  I do have an allergy to cilantro.  Could have been a very bad deal."
Elio R.,"Palm Bay, FL",0,26,2,3.0,8/8/2015,"I believe the food was very good, and so were their draughts. Tried the Jeremiah Red, IPA and the Berry Burst cider, and they were all very refreshing. Service needs to improve, hopefully it will be better as time passes."
Peg P.,"Melbourne, FL",0,14,,1.0,2/18/2016,"Visited BJ's last night for dinner.  I asked the server what she thought was better, the Chicken with pesto sandwich or the shrimp tacos.  She said the shrimp tacos were really good and so that is what I ordered.  First it arrived w/out the avocado crema.  Took about ten minutes for the server to swing back by our table.  As I was dressing the tacos, I looked for the shrimp.  Hard to find in all the shredded lettuce? and carrots.  Found three really small shrimp.  The meal included tortilla chips.  There were 5 very greasy chips on the plate buried under the tacos.  The shell that the lettuce/carrot concoction was in was kind of like a pita that was soggy and hard at the same time. I waited another 10 minutes for the server to speak to her about the lack of shrimp in the tacos, but she was nowhere in sight.  Finally got tired of waiting and ate the ""salad"".  When she finally stopped by with the bill, I told her that they should take the tacos off the menu as they were not good.  If I had wanted a salad, I would've ordered one.  Her reply was sorry and left the bill.  We will not return.  Poor food and Poor service.  Zero stars!"
