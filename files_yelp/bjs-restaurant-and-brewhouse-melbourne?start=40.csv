Chris S.,"Melbourne Beach, FL",6,57,,2.0,8/11/2015,"I've been to this location twice now, and I must say, the one in Orlando is WAY better.  Here are my issues:  First: the food isn't as 'fresh' tasting. I really liked the one in Orlando because it was a chain restaurant that I didn't mind going to. Here, food doesn't taste as 'fresh.' In fact, it tastes no better than food from your local Chili's.  Second: The service is slow. Like really really slow. I understand they just opened, but it's been three weeks and they still don't have it together. Did I say slow?  Third and most appallingly: the price! My fiance and I went in for a dessert (that we split) and one drink each and the bill was over $30 before tip. The pricing is insane. Not a good way to greet a new market.  I will return, but it will be a LONG time before I do so."
Gemma S.,"Indialantic, FL",10,5,,2.0,8/2/2015,"Went at about 1 o'clock on a sunday. Was told there was a 25 min wait, a manager then came up to me as I was giving my name and told me a booth at the bar opened up, after he sat me, I sat there for 10 mins while no one greeted me, and he sat at the top of the stairs and made no move to make sure someone was coming to the table. Someone finally dropped menus off (not our server) and I waited another 10 mins to be greeted. All in all it was 25 mins before I even had a drink in front of me. Any where else, I would have left by the time it got to 25 mins with out a drink, but I really wanted to try it.  I got the brussel sprout appetizer and they were burnt, and looked nothing like the picture in the menu. My entree was good, and so was the beer. Our server was sweet and attentive once she actually got to us. Next time I think I'll save this place for having a beer at the bar while I wait for Togo food. I really hope they get it together!"
Crystal F.,"Portsmouth, VA",70,101,126,4.0,7/24/2015,"Went here for a soft opening, so we were only exposed to a limited menu. What we had was really good and everything that went out looked nice as well. The portions were huge and the and we had plenty to take home. I'd like to go back and try their wings, pizza and beer. Definitely a new spot on my rotation of places to eat around here."
Christopher B.,"Palm City, FL",1,3,,5.0,9/18/2016,"This was my first time here, and was impressed. The hostess and waiter were very personable and welcoming. For a sampling of their beer I had a Tatonka Stout which was quite tasty. We started our meal with the flatbread nachos. They were excellent! My meal was the Mediterranean flatbread tacos and not only were they excellent but the side of veggies and grains was unique and flavorful. I will be back soon."
Ava G.,"Melbourne, FL",224,35,1,5.0,7/27/2015,"Late Sunday night and hungry, I think all Melbourne residents have ran into the problem.. what's open? Aside from the very played out TGIFs, Applebees, etc.. we gave one of the new restaurants by the mall a chance and BJ's kitchen is open til 12 am on Sunday! The atmosphere of this place is awesome. A mixed vibe of Yard House and World of Beer. Menu has something for everyone, and although it's not ""Cheddars cheap"" you will get every dollars worth with the portions sizes and quality served. The Rewards program is also a nice little niche as well!  Will absolutely return again, and I hope they have the Sunday Ticket coming up this September! Update 7/31 Went back again for soup and appetizers. I would skip on their soups, nothing special for the $$ Mac n cheese snack was also below average, but stuffed artichokes were great!"
Peggy R.,"Melbourne, FL",27,319,24,4.0,7/13/2016,"Would have been 5 stars of the pizza had been a little hotter.  In defense we did not mention it to our server.  Who was great.  We went in the middle of the lunch hour and were waited on quickly.  The food was fresh and good.  We will definitely go back!  We had the fried portabello mushrooms then had a grilled cheese, bacon, tomato & avocado sandwich with fries and a small pizza.  Both were very tasty.  Then had a mini monkey bread Pazookie for dessert which was very good but I like the cookie ones better."
J M.,"Palm Bay, FL",18,44,29,5.0,7/27/2015,"After eating at the Jacksonville location several times and now at the Melbourne location this place has become my favorite Florida chain restaurant. The Sriracha brussel sprouts are fantastic as well as the Barbacoa chicken. Already looking forward to going back for the great food, beer and service."
Chris O.,"Melbourne, FL",0,17,,4.0,11/6/2015,"Love the BJ's at Daytona, like the one in Kissimmee. My Melbourne BJ's is getting there.   To date I have eaten there 8 times.  When it first opened, service was about as bad as it could get.  With a lot of turnover, it has gotten much better.  The food is very good, with the Rib Eye being my favorite...California Flatbread and burgers also are excellent. They carry a wide range of beer, to include my favorite, Cigar City Jai Alai (on tap)! The BJ's cellphone App is great.  Easy to load and use, it continues to give me discounts though points and specials.  The call ahead through the App is also very useful and efficient."
simon d.,"Melbourne, FL",19,39,47,4.0,8/11/2015,Everyone was very nice but the food to be honest is just not the greatest. It is good but nothing to write home about. The beer is great ! The desserts are to die for
Sean F.,"Melbourne, FL",3,6,,4.0,2/6/2016,"Had out-of-town family in for a visit and were looking for good food and good beer. When I mentioned the Brussels Sprouts with Sriracha Cream appetizer it was a no brainer - they'd never been to a BJ's before and we've enjoyed every visit there. My cousin's wife is gluten-free and really enjoyed the gluten-free pizza offered. Burgers were great (Brisket&Bacon burger and Jalapeno burger) and my wife enjoyed the kale salad with shrimp. Great selection of options for eating. Only disappointment was that you were out of the seasonal IPA I wanted to try but it's not like you don't have choices there. Almost forgot, my wife is a fan of the Wyder's Dry Pear Cider. As usual, the service was outstanding. One additional note(now that I saw the other reviews):  The food they serve really does come to your table as advertised (the photographs are representative -nice portions and well assembled)."
Trisha L.,"Louisville, KY",64,87,125,5.0,6/24/2016,They have a fantastic but limited salad menu. My husband and I tried 2 different salads and they both were phenomenal! We got they close to closing time but the waitress was fantastic and personable and made all of the adjustments off my salad and the sante fe salad's dressing had a bit of spicey to it but complimented the other items in the salad! I would eat that again!
Brian M.,"Heathrow, FL",16,12,4,1.0,9/14/2015,Very small portions with our entrées.  On the plus side the selections of food and beer were off the charts and we had a very good server. However this will certainly be our last visit to the chain.
Julie F.,"Rockville, MD",15,7,,5.0,8/4/2015,"I had a great experience here: TL;DR: Come get awesome beer and food here. Have some patience with the kitchen service, they just opened.  Long Version: First of all their beer is pretty awesome; not only do they have a great selection of craft beers, but they also have a wide variety of their own brewery's beer (brewed in California but still awesome quality).  Second, the food was really good. Important seeing as it is a restaurant and not solely a place for me to nerd out over beer. They have an extensive menu and a lot of different selections for those of us who want to save some calories for the copious amounts of beer to be had. I plan on coming back to try their burgers and a bunch of other items on the menu...their pizzas looked pretty awesome too.  Finally, the kitchen service was pretty slow...but that is to be expected when a restaurant has just opened. What made the slow food amazing was the service our waiter and the whole waiting staff had. They accidentally sold our dessert to another table, instead of hiding the mistake and blaming it on some random occurrence they completely owned up to the mistake and told us what happened. The manager came by and gave us both a complimentary dessert voucher (of which we plan on using when we come back) and made a potentially bad situation into a positive experience.  I have high hopes for this place and plan on watching a few games here. Thanks for finally adding some good beer and food to the Melbourne food scene."
Becky B.,"Melbourne, FL",35,118,140,5.0,6/17/2016,Our first time eating here. It was super good. We had the ribs/siracha brussel sprouts/spaghetti and meatballs..oh and I had a delicious Jalapeno and Cucumber Margarita. Now our main entree took extremely long to get to our table..the point to where we almost left ..but our waiter apologized and didn't charge us for it. So we will give them another try.
Amanda P.,"Melbourne, FL",2,13,3,5.0,8/17/2016,"My first time here was a while ago... but it was amazing. My friend, Shannon, treated me to a meal and we shared a dessert. The service and layout of the restaurant were delightful. Loved the pizookie!"
Karla F.,"Saint Cloud, FL",2,14,22,1.0,7/3/2016,We were in for a dinner tonight. We were serve for a very pleasant young men name Jovanni. Our food was very late coming out and our server was so apologetic and tried to got a manager to come over and what happens but instead the manager was in the corner visibly yelling out our server. The manager name was Merving. Our server was trying his hardest make our meal right. The manager finally made his wave to our table about 2mins later. Very disappointing.
Carly P.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",176,9,2,5.0,12/15/2015,We ordered the quac and chips and moz sticks for appetizers and they were really good. I had the Asian chopped chicken salad and that was delicious. Really fresh crispy and great mix of ingredients. As a last minute impulsive decision we ordered bjs peanut butter s'mores pizookie. My life is changed. I'm not really a huge dessert person but this was prob the best dessert I ever had. I would come back and order the pizookie as my meal. Wow
Lisa R.,"Melbourne, FL",1,31,,4.0,5/1/2016,"Great selection of beer, excellent service, and food was pretty good too. We had the gluten free pizza and my husband liked it more than I did, but he's pretty into the gluten free foods. I loved the chips and guacamole - they were very tasty and just the right amount of heat in the salsa. Our server let us sample some of the beer selections which helped us make a good choice to go with our food. Join their club and you get rewards - coupons almost always available online also."
Chris L.,"Miami, FL",0,15,8,3.0,6/17/2016,"So this is my second time here. My first was really great. This time however was a disappointment. 1st of all we waited 15 minutes for our waitress to show up, when she did though Sharon was great and very attentive. We had the fried portobellos which were okay. I got the ribeye and my wife had the sirloin. I asked for medium rare and received a well done steak. When I showed Sharon she immediately took care of it. The next one came out good. My wife's sirloin was tough and her Siracha brussel sprouts were way over cooked. All in all if had been my first time it would have been my last. The service was the only thing that was really good this time. Due to the beer though I think it's worth a second chance."
Marci W.,"Melbourne Beach, FL",0,37,,2.0,6/16/2017,"The staff likes to seat people on top of one another and make no effort to space the customers although many seats, including booths, were available, That is easier on staff as they don't have to walk as far but bad for customers who would like to enjoy their meal without having to listen to other conversations from the people sitting right next to them. Tables are very close togeather.  If seated near to a loud month who never shuts up a challenging experience and not enjoyable. They have simple 6 inch dividers between tables, which if seated in one makes it appear that the stranger sitting on the other side is actually at your table. Poor, Poor, design.  Concrete floors and high open ceiling make for poor acoustics and a very loud experience.  Service was slow! The waiter didn't know the cost of an unpriced but promoted beer.  He never asked how we wanted our burger as in rare, medium, or well done.  Made several flip comments. The food was good although overpriced. Cheddars down the street is much better at 20% less.  With tax, beer ranges from $6-10 dollars a pint and they have a lot of craft beer choices.   Again, overpriced!  Good food but a really poor atmosphere and slow service mean we will never go back."
