Sandy M.,"Melbourne, FL",1,7,,5.0,5/26/2016,"Love BJ's, food is great, service is terrific, and the manager is a friendly guy, always trying to make our experience better"
KimAnn B.,"Reno, NV",73,8,1,5.0,5/21/2016,"We arrived in Melbourne yesterday afternoon and we were hungry and unfamiliar with the area.  BJ's Brewhouse is known to us from Tampa, so we stopped there.  What a fantastic experience- best waiter ever, Matt!!! He was attentive- he was on top of drinks for refills, service was better than expected.  The food was delicious- perfectly cooked!!!"
Bob H.,"Melbourne, FL",23,3,,4.0,6/19/2016,"Food and beer is always good, service is ungodly slow. How long does it take to get a beer and glass of water."
Joey D.,"Memphis, TN",4,4,3,5.0,11/9/2015,"Beautiful atmosphere and decor. Friendliest bartender named Brittany B. who let us try several beers before ordering. Food was perfect. Whatever reviews had said poor service it must have been a fluke from when they first opened. Definitely come in and eat here! Deep dish pizza is amazing! Thick, tons of toppings, and delicious. Wish I could give this place 6 stars !  Definitely am going to come back."
Cory L.,"Melbourne, FL",64,37,5,2.0,4/4/2016,"Everything except the pizza (surprisingly) is awful...frozen burgers, chicken/etc. At least they have Stone IPA and an interesting seasonal every now and then."
Tim D.,"Melbourne, FL",0,2,,2.0,11/11/2015,"I have a big problem with the service at BJ's. I've been there twice for lunch and usually arrive early (11am) to avoid the crowd. Today, a coworker and I came to celebrate Veteran's day. It took about 10 minutes to get a drink to us and another 45 minutes to get our food (a burger and tacos). You can figure out how much was left of our lunch hour. When I asked about the food, I received an earful about how 20 people just sat down at the same time. This is BS because the place was mostly empty when we arrived. A table next to us had a couple that sat down after us and received their food before us. Must be the luck of the draw with the waiters there. The food was good but I was left with no time to enjoy it.  That was my second attempt at BJs. There will not be a third. This could be a great place if management would step up and get the staffing right."
Keene M.,"Melbourne, FL",2,51,13,3.0,2/20/2016,First time going since opening 3 months ago.  The atmosphere is really nice with an impressive bar and an area for large private groups.   Our server was well trained and knew all the products.  It was not very busy but still took a while to get house draft beers.  The deep dish pizza came in reasonable time but could have been hotter.  The flavor of the sauce and toppings was good.   Overall it was a good experience even if it was pricey.  I would definitely go there again and recommend it to friends.  I would have given it 4 stars if it didn't cost so much.
Todd G.,"Melbourne, FL",2,5,,2.0,9/13/2015,"Wasn't overly impressed. Watched the manager at the host stand checking his cell phone. Food was average. Server need more training. Waiting for drink refills took forever. Must of asked for a two box 3 times. Didn't see the mangers doing table visits, or walking the floor."
Dave Y.,"Melbourne, FL",0,10,,2.0,11/21/2015,Not overly impressed on first visit. Wife ordered a 10 dollar Margharita that was undrinkable. Service was slow. Table next to us left because they waited too long. Next to them table was brought 3 orders of fries as the first 2 were cold. My Asian salad was good but not award winning. Wife said Pizza was good . Took 1-1/2 hour for lunch and restaurant was only 1/3 full. Trying to compete with Cheddars down the road.  Cheddars wins hands down.
Food Z.,"Melbourne, FL",0,15,3,3.0,9/29/2015,"Both the service and the kitchen are hit or miss. We have been here ten times... We have now had 7 good experiences and three bad experience. Overall, we have seen some moderate improvement and can recommend BJ's Melbourne as a solid place for an OK meal... especially late night."
Chris N.,"Melbourne, FL",56,14,2,2.0,9/7/2015,Not to good. Food took an hour and was not hot. Forgot our drinks. Ribs were tough... Maybe my dogs will like them. Kids fruit dish was good and the fries were good.
Joe G.,"Lancaster, CA",0,32,1,1.0,8/16/2016,If you're in a hurry for lunch don't go to BJ's!!!  They get overwhelmed with more than 2 people.
Johann F.,"San Antonio, TX",17,29,29,4.0,1/29/2016,Great place to grab a bite or a drink. It follows the standard configuration and quality as the others.  I found the service to be above standard which is always nice. I recommend it to any fellow traveler.
Baron J.,"Melbourne, FL",22,28,3,3.0,8/10/2015,"Ate here 4 times so far and took out once. PROS: They try really hard. Extensive menu. Some very good menu items are tavern cut pizza, burgers and fries, tomato and mozzarella salad, house salad, homemade sodas, fired mozzarella sticks, salted caramel pizzukie, and strawberry dessert. Food brought out fairly quickly after ordering. Nice decor and interior. CONS: Long wait times when you sit down, they have to solve this. Website issues preventing ordering on-line. My take out order took an extra 40 minutes. I sat at curbside for 40 minutes. The server gave me free fries and 2 sodas.  They totally botched my wife's Santa Fe salad. Pan pizza not great. New Orleans Jambalaya way too spicy, almost inedible, they need to adjust this recipe. One night we ordered coffee and they had no creamer of half and half. They need to work out the kinks of this place then they can easily move to a 4 star establishment."
Carol A.,"Melbourne, FL",0,5,,5.0,9/10/2016,"It was very busy but staff was trying their best to get everyone their food in a timely manner. We felt bad for the amount of grief the customers were giving staff for the wait times. Hopefully customers dont always treat them that bad. Food tasted great but it was somewhat pricey. You get what you pay for though (it tasted amazing so that's probably why). Kind of loud and the lighting was very dim bar-like. Some seats are definitely going to be better than others. Our waiter was very kind and sweet and he made sure we were completely taken care of. The hostesses were also very understanding of the griping from customers. They handled it very professionally, even though personally I would have handled it way worse than they did. The location is very convenient. Right next to the melbourne square mall. Plan on going there the next time we go shopping."
Charles J.,"Melbourne, FL",2,60,20,4.0,12/13/2015,Had a great time here. Beer is great and food is fresh and reasonable price. I had Shawn as a server he was good. It's not 15 dollars for a salad try 6 dollars.
Gina P.,"Melbourne, FL",4,23,11,5.0,9/14/2015,One of my favorite restaurants in Melbourne. Menu has a great variety of food. I've ate here twice and had great service both times!
Charlene H.,"Indialantic, FL",58,24,310,3.0,8/1/2015,"I visited last night with my family. A party of 3. I was excited to try this new restaurant that just popped up in my area. The decor is urban industrial much like a lot of the new restaurants. The menu is a big book where the first three pages are nothing but brews, wines, and cocktails. The rest of the menu was the usual things like sandwiches, burgers, pastas and deep dish pizza, which was on my mind. So I split the medium Gourmet Five Meat deep dish with my Mom.  She thoroughly enjoyed it but I found it to be rather dry , lacking cheese and sauce. The crust was crispy and had a good flavor but I had to order a side of marinara. The appetizer of artichoke bites came out late but I don't believe it was the servers fault. The manager came out  and personally apologized which was very professional and appreciated. My brother ordered a personal great white pan pizza and I tried a bite. It was delicious and creamy with alfredo, chicken, mushrooms and tomatoes. The side wedge salad was delicious and they gave me extra dressing and blue cheese crumbles upon asking. I will return one day but will try the parmesan crusted chicken I was eyeing or a different pan pizza."
Fred C.,"Melbourne, FL",16,6,5,4.0,8/20/2015,"We went here for lunch today, and our server was excellent and the food was very good. It was our first visit to a BJ's and we will go back again."
Giovana S.,"Melbourne, FL",0,11,5,5.0,8/9/2015,"Tried it out and I was beyond impressed. The ambiance is great, service was super friendly and fast, and food was  awesome. I tried the arugula salad with goat cheese and spinach stuffed mushrooms, they were amazing. My partner ordered chicken fettuccine Alfredo and a strawberry pina colada and they were both delicious!"
