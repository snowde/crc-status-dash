Joe S.,"Greenwood Lake, NY",7,96,,4.0,6/27/2016,"A group of five of us went to this place for a friend's birthday dinner. It was a weekday so we were seated right away. The place is spacious and has a half restaurant, half  sports bar feel. The decor inside is very nice. we ordered the fried artichoke appetizer and it was very good. I ordered the chicken mediterranian tacos. They were very good, my only problemwas that I thought the portion was small. My wife ordered a burger, I ate some of that and it was good. I do not like shoe string fries and that is what they serve. Just a matter of preference. Bottom line: I will come back here, pretty good place to eat and have drinks."
Drew C.,"Palm Bay, FL",0,5,,2.0,9/26/2015,"Sat at the bar, 3:00 on a Saturday. Crowded and only 1bartender.  Took 15 mins for a beer. Waited to make a food order another 10 mins and gave up, hungry and thirsty."
rachelle m.,"Wilmington, MA",84,5,,5.0,1/10/2016,The burgers were amazing! They have a huge menu and many draft beers to choose from. All six of us were more than pleased. Our waitress Shannon R. was extremely sweet and attentive! No complaints and highly recommended!!!
kathy a.,"Indialantic, FL",3,33,15,3.0,8/2/2015,"Gave a 3 because the server was so sub par. Would have given a 4.. The food was really good.  The manager was super nice and really tried to make it all good.  We waited for 42 minutes for our food and the restaurant was 1/2 full.  THE server did not check on us at all.  We got there at 8:12pm And left at 10:12pm for 3 dinners.  And one was salad. The manager comped the dessert and 1/2 the bill.. The server  brought it out and said the cake part of the strawberry dessert was not made right so was bringing another. The next one came in a 2 go box DUH... It was the strawberry shortcake dessert with ice cream and whipped cream and a hot piece of cake..now this is the good part, she forgot the strawberries..She needs to keep her day job. I actually tipped her too. She never smiled or acted interested in our table.   So don't sit in Melissa's section if u can help it! The Thai chicken salad was delicious, the bison burger was very tasty. The fried brussels sprouts were delicious. The ice cream and whipped cream and donut was good also even without the strawberries ha."
Jennifer O.,"Palm Bay, FL",0,9,,5.0,8/23/2015,"Fiance and I ordered our pizzas online for dine in, we get there and there is a line out the door, they say the wait is about 20 minutes. We wait, and 5 minutes later we are seated. Ordered a beer, came out so cold, and was so delicious. Pizza was out 10 minutes after we sat down. Amazing service. Have done it like this twice now. I love how cold the beer comes out. And the deep dish pizza is simple delicious!! Don't be a mouth breather, order your shiz online for dine in!!!!"
Chris W.,"Palm Bay, FL",0,1,,1.0,4/21/2016,"If a zero star rating was possible I'd give it. I used the online ordering and was told they lost the order and had no record of it in the kitchen. This was after the hostess confirmed the order and after I waited 30 min at the table for the ""lost"" order. I've now been here an hour and still no food. Work will not be pleased."
Frank M.,"Palm Bay, FL",0,7,,3.0,5/13/2016,"Stopped in for lunch with my wife for our first visit. We were greeted and  seated immediately.  Place was about half full. We were given menus and then we waited. After about 10 minutes our server showed up to take our drink order. After another wait we placed our food order. My wife  ordered the Hot Ham & Cheese sandwich  and  I ordered the Buffalo Chicken sandwich. Both came with fries.  And then we waited. When our sandwiches arrived the fries were cold. Asked for ketchup and a refill of the iced tea and then waited. Our sandwiches were good, fries were cold, and did I mention that the service was sloooooooow.  If you only have an hour for lunch, go someplace else. Great bar area lots of interesting beers on tap."
Kayla W.,"Melbourne, FL",19,18,26,4.0,12/18/2015,When we went it was packed but we got our table for 7 within minutes. The decor and temperature was great. Very friendly staff. We got the artichoke dip with chips as an appetizer but it was tiny that we kept having to ask for more chips. We also had to ask for drink refills each time as they were not offered. Portions were big and the food was fantastic. I will be returning!
Chris T.,"Melbourne, FL",15,16,,1.0,9/1/2016,well the place is clean enough but my complaint has to do with to go ordering i ordered 2 burgers( to go) no drinks or anything and my bill was over 35 dollars holy cow! second i received different burgers than i ordered and had to wait 20 minutes past the stated pick up time to get them. which is the reason i didnt give them back i was hungry had to eat in the car as now i was 20 minutes late for my next appointment. well i can go to walmart and buy meat and cook it faster and better and for a 10th of the cost.  oh and was really unimpressed that the hostess was more into her phone than helping customers. my visit was about june 9th and is still fresh in my head as one of the worst expieriences ever at a restraunt
Jules L.,"Melbourne, FL",5,14,2,5.0,6/3/2016,The pazookie is awesome.  The waitress is amazing and the food piping hot.   We really enjoyed our meal at this great you're short and look forward to coming back soon
Gina H.,"Melbourne, FL",0,4,,2.0,12/30/2015,"Oh gosh not sure where to begin..  We ate at BJ's last night as it was our daughters 15th birthday.  She picked BJ's as she had visited a few in CA and loved the pizza cookie!   Throughout our dining experience we had a total of 4 various waters/waitresses assist us.  The place was packed, very busy and quite loud.  I always felt that the service at BJ's was lacking and slow in CA, well the Melbourne location is just the same sadly!  Communication between the 4 waiters/waitresses was extremely lacking and/or nonexistent. We were asked the same questions over, workers tried to deliver food to our table that we did not order, however there were 2 incidents that really turned me off.   One, when I asked for advice concerning an entree the waiter had no idea that item was on the menu!  He had me show him the page and proceeded to tell me, ""he had not tried it, heard of it or had anyone order it"" - it was the Sriracha macaroni and cheese with bacon entree..  I gave it a try as the rest of the menu was pretty bland and uninspiring..  It was actually very tasty however the portion was the size of an appitizer.  Secondly, one of our 4 servers brought my daughter her free birthday cookie.  Roughly 5 minutes later anpther waiter came to our table with a lit candle and another pizza cookie.  He saw our daughter eating the cookie and apologized as he did not know someone alrighty brought it.  He proceeded to blow out the candle and took the pizza cookie and ice cream back to the kitchen!!  Wouldn't one expect the waiter to offer us to keep the desert as it was his mistake?!  Who wants a recycled desert??!!!  Yuck..  Needless to say we will not be back...."
Lisa H.,"Palm Bay, FL",2,18,14,4.0,12/2/2015,"Hubby & i went for dinner on a Wednesday night. It wasnt busy when we got there, but shortly after was busier then i would have thought on a week day. FOOD- was good we ordered the fried artichokes they were good but definitely frozen chain restaurant food.  i had the balsamic chicken with a mozzarella tomato side salad. Little heavy on the basil in the salad, but good.  but the chicken was cooked perect & the white cheddar mash was Yum!!  Hubby had the Bison burger it was exceptional,  juicy, flavorful it came with an Asian type coleslaw. He doesnt like slaw but likef this one. The beer choices here are astounding. I dont like beer but hubby tried 2 different flights i actually liked the berry burst cider. We tried the Pizookie as well couldn't decide if i wanted the salted carmel or triple chocolate server recommended half & half. It was ok from the description i expected a thicker moist cookie. It was good but kinda thin and hard. We had super awesome server named Shawn. He we attentive,  knowledgeable and made great recommendation on the beer. He had many tables and still did a great job. We will be back for sure. As i was writing this the manager Ken came by and talked to us. He was very nice. I am not sure why BJ's has a 3 star rating."
Barbara B.,"Sayre, PA",0,4,,5.0,4/1/2016,Love this place. Food is delicious and different and the service and waitstaff are incredible. They have a large menu so there is something for everyone.
Nadia J.,"Melbourne, FL",51,7,,1.0,8/15/2015,"ordered baked mac n cheese and the $17 tuna salad for dinner. The tuna on my salad was overcooked and not rare as described on the menu. I asked them to remake it. After twenty minutes the server came back and said ""apparently they're not going to cook it correctly, so you need to pick a different item off the menu."" At this time I showed them my mac n cheese was completely dry not creamy, and inedible. He agreed took it back. I picked out the bbq chicken pizza next- at this point my friends have finished their meals. 45 minutes later a server comes back I ask for my check and request to take the pizza off my bill as I never received it. We were at the restaurant for over 3 hours in total and I really feel they should have comp'd my beer at least since I was never served a correct dinner and left the restaurant hungry after being made to sit for so long. My boyfriend's burger was overcooked and dry and crumbling off the bun. My other friend received a different pizza other than the one she ordered. Terrible experience and I'll never come back. The server hid from us and managament never took initiative to make things right."
David T.,"Melbourne, FL",1,2,,5.0,3/7/2016,"I'm a pretty big fan of the whole breakdown of the brewing process on the back wall. I'm also very happy to see so many other brews besides just BJs beer, especially all the local Florida options. Very cool."
Mary L.,"Melbourne, FL",92,58,28,3.0,8/29/2015,"We went there for lunch today because Red Robin was packed.  BJ's was also packed but had high tops available in the bar area.  The service was as good as it can be when you are slammed.  We ended up ordering beer the moment our beers arrived because there was a lag between ordering the beer and receiving the beers by about 10 minutes.  We both had burgers which were okay.  Not bad, not great but good.  I still think Coasters has the best burgers in Melbourne.  One thing I did notice as I waited for my beer is that there was at least 6-8 tables empty in the dining room and standing room only at the hostess stand.  I am not sure if they didn't have enough servers or a slow hostess but if I was waiting 20-25 minutes and they had empty tables all around I would not be very happy.  I do think this place will be a good place to watch some games.  They have nice TV's all over.  Once the newness wears off you might be able to get a spot at the bar to hang out.  With all new restaurants you need to bring your patience and keep your beers coming."
Rochelle H.,"Gainesville, FL",7,4,,2.0,8/1/2015,"Tried this for lunch today with my husband and son. Good concept, poor execution. The wait wasn't bad and the order was correct, however the service was terrible. We had their ""signature"" deep dish BJ's Favorite pizza which wasn't bad but nothing to rave about. My son had the BBQ  brisket bacon burger which he did rave about. The style of the place is that service is provided by multiple staff. My guys got rootbeers which were very good. My husband finished his mug and placed it on the end of the table. I watched as at least 6 wait staff walked up and down the aisle visually scanning the tables. His glass sat there empty for no less than 20 minutes without anyone asking if he wanted another or even to clear it. I over heard one young lady tell the table behind us that she was helping train the staff. She also walked by at least 4 times without acknowledging his empty glass. The final test? A box was requested for the remaining pizza which never came. Think they need some more time to get their act together and some better trainers."
Joe W.,"Seattle, WA",0,13,,1.0,8/19/2015,I've been to this chain all over the country. Started off very excited to get craft beer. The servers knew nothing of the drink offering. The food was okay but nothing special or even on the better side of good. After being rushed to place an order very disappointed when it took 45 minutes to get out to go dessert and check. Will not be back to the Melbourne location.
Elaine G.,"Rockledge, FL",9,24,2,2.0,7/31/2015,Horrible experience... Waited over an hour for a table so was expecting good food. Ordered an appetizer it never came out and the waiter wanted to bring it out after our food came and make us still pay for it! Ordered the pesto chicken breast sandwich and there was a large bone in it. I am only giving it two stars because the manger took my food off the bill.
Piper K.,"Melbourne, FL",401,38,32,2.0,11/12/2015,"Came for Veterans Day and was just not impressed. We knew there would be a wait but by the time we were seated the rush had died and there was no reason for the snails pace of everything. First we were sat at a dirty table, it had been flipped and set for the next guests but was still covered in crumbs. The hostess was off before I could tell her, and we sat there for a good 5 minutes before it was cleaned. Everything we ate was clearly frozen and not fresh, mediocre food at best. Same with drinks, basil watermelon margarita was recommended but was sweet syrup sans alcohol. My chicken club was disgusting and I only at 1/2 the chicken on 1/2 the sandwich. Brought the chicken home for My dogs. Despite my barely touched plate, No one once asked how was it. Husbands burger was equally unremarkable. We are ideal customers, like to eat out, try new things and have a cocktail, too bad BJ's you lost a good opportunity. It took a good 5 minutes for anything to be brought or refilled. 2 stars because our server Caroline did refill my daughters water 1 time and did seem to be trying. Overall it was disgusting and I don't understand the people that like this type of food, sheep. Over priced and overrated. Will not be back."
