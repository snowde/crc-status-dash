Blair H.,"Hemet, CA",2,135,385,5.0,12/4/2017,It was our second time at the Menifee location because we usually drive to temecula. However we are very glad we made the stop here for a weekend family dinner because everything turned out great from the service to the food. We were seated immediately even though there were larger parties waiting ( there was just 4 of us so we got a booth) The server Nathan was a delight. Very clean cut and well groomed and so professional that it made out dinner even more enjoyable. He had a bright smile on his face and never lost patience with any questions we had about the items. He made suggestions and we chose a couple of them and didn't regret it. He never made a mistake and was prompt with appetizers and refills and entrees. Not a single issue all night Mark the bartender who made our drinks was very fast and nice as well.  The food was delicious with the  exception of the fried calamari. It was over cooked and too much breading on the outside. That we will not order again. It was the only dish that nobody liked. The rest however was good from the salads to the rib eye and shrimp scampi and burger and of course the pizzoukis. Those were excellent  Overall a great location and dining experience so we will go back for sure. Thanks Nathan and Mark!
Michael A.,"Menifee, CA",33,8,,1.0,1/3/2018,"Always the worst experience. I have eaten at BJ's about 10 times and with the exception of the 2 times I have nothing but complaints.  In June of 2013 my family was in from out of town a large party 15 showed up and we had 5 star service ad the food was outstanding.  The 2nd good experience was in Feb. of 2014 when I took my son for his birthday, again good food and good service. Now for the bad in the roughly 8 other visits there have always been issues.  Hair in the food, slow and poor service, food coming out cold and the list could go on and on.  I'm not sure why I waited so long and tried so many time before learning my lesson and just writing this restaurant of my list."
Ramon E.,"Hemet, CA",0,1,3,1.0,12/22/2017,"embarrassing...my first visit ever to this place and last. i received a gc for xmas, purchased a ""deep dish pizza"" it was all dough. 28 dollar piece of dough. it was disgusting, it had maybe 10 pepperonis, and a sprinkle of cheese. if i'm paying 28 dollars for a tiny ass pizza it better have toppings. my first and last time to visit this restaurant. i don't know how the managers could allow for such low quality food being served.                                                            follow up so the manager or owner post this b.s. about being sorry for the incident and says they want to make it up.  i contact them via the email they left in their post twice, guess who hasn't responded. if you guess right i will give you some advice on where not to go to get some s#i%y ""deep dish pizza"" for 28.00 dollars"
Marcus H.,"Murrieta, CA",0,4,,2.0,12/10/2017,"Take-out service definitely needs improvement. It's never ready on time when I order ahead and it's not a smooth process. It seems like it's a brand new concept at this location every time I go. Maybe they lose track of which refrigerator they place my order in? It has to be that because the food is always somewhere between slightly above room temperature and cold (at the take-out counter).  I also thought they raised the price of the family feast and reduced the size, but no, after reading the labels at home I noticed they only gave me 4 of 5 of my items for the new higher price... Even better! I'll stick with Domino's for take-out for the foreseeable future."
Dave C.,"SAN PEDRO, CA",13,30,67,5.0,1/9/2018,"Great service by our waiter, Jonathan. We were seated right away and everything came out in a good timely manner. Granted it was a Tuesday, but it was still during dinner time and we've been here at all hours and have never had issues with our orders or the service. The food was great. Our table had everything from healthy chicken pita tacos, to Shrimp Alfredo Pasta. After dinner, we had a pizookie and my son got his own mini pizookie because it was his birthday. All in all, it was a great bday dinner with great food and great service."
Debra P.,"Murrieta, CA",38,61,13,5.0,11/9/2017,Mom and I having lunch and my food came about 10-15 min before mom's? Not good when you're having lunch together? Waitress said it was because it was the all you can eat soup and salad they wanted to get me started right away. I would much rather start eating with my mom and if I want more then I'll order more... I would hope they would rethink this. It's more fun to eat with your partner for Lunch? Food was good though!!! Wanted update...Chris the General Manager came to our table to apologize and our waitress Jennifer was awesome especially as busy as she was!!!
Nancy F.,"San Diego, CA",128,599,308,4.0,10/27/2017,"Whats not to like about a great beer selection and good pizza? We enjoyed happy hour at the bar with some nice selections. This location is newer, and I love the openess of the seating. One thing that is a bummer is parking. It can fill up pretty fast. The pizzas here are delicious with scrumptious crusts. We enjoyed the grilled brussel sprouts on the happy hour menu. One thing I like here is they carry a great draft beer selection and not just their own. All in all a nice night out."
Dru R.,"Murrieta, CA",13,26,14,1.0,12/18/2017,"The service at this place sucks ass!! I have been here over an hour and had to ask to order drinks. Not one of these ""servers"" has asked for my order. Last time I come here"
Manny A.,"Corona, CA",2,22,11,5.0,11/22/2017,"Love this place, always good for a late night drink and snack. Chris M. waits on us all the time, best bartender ever. The service he provides is a huge part of the reason why we always return back."
Kim D.,"Menifee, CA",0,11,3,1.0,1/5/2018,"Terrible service been a few times ..same service different servers .Food well is like bar food over cooked and dry ,served food cold several times .Food on floors sitting people with out  proper clean up .Bathrooms nasty both sexes. Pretty sad since we do not have many large family restaurants .."
John J.,"Menifee, CA",5,15,3,1.0,12/2/2017,"Saturday night is not a good time to order take out. Long wait. I'm less concerned about the 30 minutes I've been waiting for my order than I am by the lack of acknowledgement. Once a young man said ""your order isn't ready"", I asked him how he knew as I haven't even given my name yet. He said because the 2 take out orders are still in the oven, then he left. Now, 30 minutes later, I stand here not knowing if it will be another 5 minutes, 55 minutes, or never. Understand, this is 30 minutes past the stated pickup time. This is why I'm walking out in 2 minutes."
Jesse V.,"Wildomar, CA",0,1,6,1.0,12/27/2017,Horrible service period. Waited for ever for our order place is empty. Will definitely won't be back
Hope S.,"Perris, CA",0,9,1,2.0,12/4/2017,Really love bjs but tonight just wasn't the best. Ordered take out. My spaghetti was ice cold so were the middle of the meatballs and plus there were more noodles than sauce Update: I just wanted to clarify that the service at takeout was good the girls were super sweet. And they were still just as helpful when I called for a refund. So thank you.
Caris T.,"Perris, CA",0,3,,3.0,1/8/2018,"Came here with my boyfriend on a Saturday night around 11 pm for dinner. While there were no complaints about our server who was nice and very helpful, the food was just not up to par this night. I am a Bj's fan and already knew what I wanted before we had gotten there. Calamari to start, a Shirley temple, jambalaya as my entree, and a pizookie to finish with. First strike my Shirley temple came with no cherries. Which is mando for me ! However our server did bring me out four when i had commented about them being missing. Secondly when the calamari came out it was horrible. It tasted as if it had been fried in old chicken oil or something. Also while it did have a few single pieces majority of it was in a big clump that was just stuck together making it not appeasing. After letting it sit for a while I finally mentioned it to the server who agreed that it did look like a big clump and said she would talk to her manger. The calamari was taken off the ill thankfully. My boyfriend and I both ordered the jambalaya which was just okay that night. Last was the Oreo pizookie. One of my favs ! Another server brought it out and just dropped it off at our table with no silverware, so we had to wait for our original server to come back (about 5 min) after to finally get us some. Overall, with the exception of the food it was a typical Bj's experience. I just don't think I'll be giving this one a try again, or at least not so late in the evening. Maybe that had been the reason for the calamari being thrown in old chicken grease."
Aiko N.,"Oceanside, CA",248,255,502,3.0,5/28/2017,"I had a gift card I got over two years ago that I wanted to use. The food is overpriced here! I mean, 12$ for a few avocado egg rolls!! I got a spicy peanut soba pasta with chicken for 14$ that was of good quality but small in portion. It's on the Better for You menu, but really there's no healthier ingredients. It still clocked in at over 1,000 calories!  It's both good and bad that the menu is so expansive here. Meaning, there's something for everyone but freshness is questionable.  Good service can really set the tone (and even help justify prices) when ambience is lacking, but they didn't give that here. Our server pretty much forgot about us after dropping off the food, and my water glass stayed empty. We had to flag one down for the check, as well as to pick up the payment.  I would only return if friends want to go. It's so busy here even at off-hours that I only see myself waiting if I have a gift card to use, not because I really like eating here.  Pros: - booths - lots of parking - house beer menu Cons: - meh service  - overpriced - misleading ""healthy"" menu is just smallish portions using cheap ingredients  - crowded, loud - overall ambience"
JaNay H.,"Savannah, GA",101,13,2,1.0,12/18/2017,Don't order the $5 special Brew house margarita. It's basically alcohol-less & tastes like good lemonade. Thank me later
Olivia B.,"Menifee, CA",84,23,82,1.0,4/28/2017,"Mark the bar tender is the worst. He has passed by us a group of 5, at the bar at least 10 times and hasn't offered to refill our drink.. seriously.... We've been sitting at the bar with friends and we've   had to ask for a drink  on several occasions,   our  drinks are sitting on empty for 20-30 min... As a bartender his job is to make sure  drinks are always filled and at least offer water to guest.. Guess he might of skipped that lesson while he was being trained  for this position.. we where at the bar from  8 pm still 11pm..will consider coming back... horrible  service!!!! Might want to tell Mark, also that his phone and the TV should be the least important  things he should be worried  about. .."
Michael K.,"Menifee, CA",6,149,3,1.0,9/18/2017,"Save your money, go somewhere else.  The GM doesn't even care with his cut and paste responses. We were sat right away.  And our Pepsi's came fast.  Waitress was a little too eager to take our order.  Give us a minute to read through this extremely large nenu.  We finally place our order.  We're waiting, and waiting, and waiting.  During this time my drink was refilled incorrectly.  After 23 minutes our meals came.  A restaurant of this type should strive for 12-14 minute delivery times.   My girlfriend's order was incorrect.  She has Celiac Disease and they brought her a regular bun instead of a gluten free bun.  They also brought her the wrong type of potato.  I had the ribs and they were by far the worse ribs I've ever eaten.  There was no rub at all.  They were plain and boring.  They were also very, very dry.  Not an ounce of moisture in the pork. So with slow service, incorrect food and drink coming to our table, and flavorless crab being served to us, I'm going save my $50 and go elsewhere next time."
Victoria C.,"San Jacinto, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/6/2018,"Horrible customer service, waited 30 minutes for a pazookie that never arrived, while two other customers were served before us. If you get Katy as a server get a different server."
Kristen H.,"Corona, CA",167,26,45,3.0,12/5/2017,"Decent food, good prices, decent menu, decent service. Food is often bland and definitely a chain. Their new, improved menu is better and the pizza is always good. No ""wow"" factor. Bozookies are always on point."
Kim K.,"Menifee, CA",0,9,,2.0,1/5/2018,"The service left a lot to be desired and the food was just OK.  They dropped our combo appetizer without plates, silverware or napkins and I had to flag down one of the hostesses to get place settings.  I ordered a beer, and had to flag down another server to finally get it to my table after waiting over 10 minutes.  No one came to clear plates, and the server only checked on us once when we were almost completely done.  I, again, had to flag down a hostess to get someone to bring the check so I could pay.  Definitely not worth the price for poor service and mediocre food."
Miss W.,"Santee, CA",76,30,20,5.0,12/1/2017,"Always busy but worth the wait. The food is great and they have an extensive menu. They have delicious lower calorie options, and wonderful craft beer. The servers and staff are friendly, and it's always clean. Great ambiance! Love BJs!"
Ed K.,"Temecula, CA",6,60,38,2.0,9/17/2017,"I had the seared Ahi salad and it was pretty bad. Ahi was super small and looked old. I will not order it again, but I probably won't be back either. It is too corporate feeling and a bunch of busy bees. The menu is too big for BJ'S to have great food. We also asked for a couple of extra items that never arrived. They tried to seat 6 of us at a 4 person table but we moved chairs on the ends to make it work. Sad but true!"
Lee N.,"Murrieta, CA",10,84,62,1.0,11/19/2017,"Awful gross food!!! Ewwww! We ate here on Weds Nov 14, 2017 at 5:30pm. My soup tasted like it was from a can, super salty. My son's pepperoni pizza had one piece of pepperoni on it and was dry and burnt and looked like it had been sitting under the heat lamp for a long time. Our calamari was dry and over done with skinny little tentacles on it. Not high-quality meat. Our server was not very friendly and I had to ask her for drink refills several times. The air conditioning was blasting too high so we were freezing and the wait to get into this place is very long which is surprising because the food sucks. We sent back my sons pizza and asked for something else. And I never do that at restaurants!! The only good thing was my sisters draft beer. That was delicious and tasty. How is this place still in business?? Never, ever going back. BJs: clean up your act!!!"
Shelby C.,"Menifee, CA",79,9,,5.0,12/1/2017,"Had an off night, but the hostess Melissa, the general manager Chris, and the manager Vera made things right. I cannot speak highly enough of a company that has a bad night, but makes right by their customers. It is truly appreciated. Thank you!"
Kristine J.,"Menifee, CA",22,61,16,1.0,11/15/2017,HIRE MORE STAFF!!!!  Worst service ever and it's not the fault of the server.  She is overworked!  It's a Wednesday night!  This is ridiculous!  Will not be back!
Laura S.,"Menifee, CA",1,45,3,4.0,12/9/2017,"Me and my grand daughters had the most pleasant dinner tonight. Short wait, excellent service and delicious food. Thank you Dylan and the rest of the staff for a most enjoyable meal. I had the rib eye, it was done perfectly. Kids had sliders and corn dogs....no complaints from the crew!"
Denise H.,"Menifee, CA",13,29,3,2.0,10/26/2017,"I'll admit, I don't understand the hype surrounding BJ's but I decided to check it out with an open mind. The food is just not that good, I don't get it. My avacado egg rolls were mushy and the avacado was brown. Our waitress kept giving the wrong items to the wrong people, but she explained that she asked to be sent home several times because she's SICK (panic setting in here). Sick?? My friends and I are now on sick watch. We keep looking for any signs of feeling under the weather. Cillls, headache, etc lol. So far so good."
Adina K.,"Sun City, CA",0,4,,1.0,11/18/2017,"Beware of the bartender Brian T he will short you on your change back! He tried shorting my husband and I $10 last night and wasn't even apologetic after we pointed it out to him!! Honestly he didn't even look over the bill or the change when we told him, he glanced down at the change he gave us and just went to the register and grabbed the $10 we were short!! We never even said how much we were short but he knew how much to grab from the register!! Love coming to this place otherwise but we won't be in the bar if Brian T is working!!"
Vanity T.,"Nuevo, CA",0,5,1,1.0,8/3/2017,"Sucky slow service, food was cold and poozikes were cold with melted ice cream on top and to top it off the lady who brought it out tried to lie and say the poozokies were so hot that's why the ice  cream was melted... Girl, they were sitting there for awhile that's why lol"
Jason H.,"Riverside, CA",562,40,1,5.0,10/26/2017,"Best BJ's I've ever been to! Quick, friendly service, food is always perfectly cooked, and you never have to wait long for drink refills! Try the lemon thyme chicken is great if your counting calories, if not, pretty much everything is delicious!!  Don't forget the pazooki!"
Steve B.,"Wildomar, CA",190,12,29,1.0,7/2/2017,"I've had meals here before where everything went well. Today however was not one of those times. It started when one person in our party got the wrong item. By the the time they got their food most of our party was done eating. Everything took soooo long. There were other food problems too. I don't think it was entirely the server's fault, but by the time we were ready to go the check had still not arrived. I stayed behind to wait for the check so by the time it came, I was ready to talk to a manager.  When the manager came she did not introduce herself either by name or as a manager. She just put the free dessert (that we didn't want) on the table and asked if there was anything else we needed. She listened as I told her everything that was wrong with the meal. She apologized and again asked if there was anything else she could get.  Any normal server would have seen that the only way to make this right would be to comp the check but this ""manager"" is obviously the reason that things weren't going smoothly to begin with.  I write this today because I'm sure that real BJ's managers will read it and know that there are problems to be dealt with at this location."
Chris H.,"Sacramento, CA",5,57,33,4.0,8/13/2017,"Four stars because service was good so far my drinks were good until the new bartender game. His drinks were made a little too sweet even though my server went on break the server that attended us was very nice. I liked them both. I ordered my steak medium it did come a little mid rare but I would prefer it to come less than more, but when I had them cook a little bit more It was just burnt, didn't even cook in the middle. But the server was very generous and I asked if I can just have a brand new plate she said yes without hesitation and that is a big Plus in the restaurant industry... throughout the whole dinner experience I was highly satisfied."
Lauren G.,"Corona, CA",153,33,6,5.0,7/31/2017,"Blaire is thee Sh*t!!!!!  Great food, perfect drinks, awesome atmosphere. Sit at the bar top for great and quick service! The derby Cobb salad is legit. Also, you must try any pizookie!!!  You won't regret it!"
Kacee J.,"San Diego, CA",59,46,6,2.0,9/29/2017,The food was good but the worst service ever! Waited 15 mins just to get someone to the table. 40 mins for water and my drink never came after asking 3 times. Server came to table with stacked dirty plates and left them rather than get them out of our way even though napkins were on top of. Terrible management and staffing
Augie C.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,20,1,2.0,6/1/2017,"Really dark place. I don't know why they dim the lights so low. It's really hard to see the dam menu. Service was ok. Ordered a beer...so I waited and I waited and I waited... finally got it towards the end of our dinner. Food was ok. Next time I'll take a flashlight, maybe my own drink as well. Maybe there won't be a next time. No hurry to go back."
Matt C.,"Escondido, CA",0,12,10,1.0,10/15/2016,"This place is terrible. Seriously, how hard is it to make a hamburger? Also had blue stuff in my food that the management said was a crayon(s) that went through the dishwasher and got onto the cooking utensils. The guy wrote it off as nothing wrong because they are ""non toxic"". What a joke! Also have had problems with them accepting coupons for alcohol, claiming state of California doesn't allow alcohol discounts. But yet somehow it's ok to discount the beers from 12-3 , happy hour, and during football games? Overpriced, and unsanitary food with hypocritical management."
Guy S.,"Hemet, CA",23,24,3,1.0,10/2/2017,Very poor service.  Our waitress was over worked have what appeared to be our entire section of 16 tables on her own.  It was 45 minutes after our order for food to arrive that turned out to be dry and cold.  The steak I ordered (a ribeye) was flavorless.  Lazy Dog's plank steak @ $10 less had it beat by 10in a 1/10 comparison.  Anything would have been better.  Absolutely terrible in all respects!
Jason B.,"Murrieta, CA",0,17,12,1.0,10/14/2017,"Terrible food! Even the cocktails are off. Great customer service, but doesn't change to poor quality of the food. The clam chowder was extremely disappointing. My food came out cold and my wife's fish and chips was so bad she sent it back."
Trey P.,"Chula Vista, San Diego, CA",229,51,313,4.0,5/27/2017,Up in Perris Cali for my daughters softball tourney and Iwanted to eat somewhere where the entire family could enjoy something they liked. BJs was the choice and was a decent one. The wait was 40 mins but we grabbed open seating right away which was awesome. Service was good and food can surprisingly fast. Thumbs up.
