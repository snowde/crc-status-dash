Elizabeth G.,"Perris, CA",164,26,39,5.0,9/6/2015,"So I have been holding in giving this review because in the past I have had a few bad experiences. However! Times have changed and I have gone three times recently with friends and each time I have had great service along with amazing food. I have enjoyed their salmon, pizza and best of all their shrimp scampi. The greatness is that I ordered their calamari twice and God was that mouth watering! My two favorite things from here are the strawberry splash and the pazookies.  Today overall was the best service I have had! My friend Karla and I went in with our food expectations and were greeted by our server, Ryan. He was enthusiastic, friendly and knowledgeable. He made sure that we were well taken care of and that is why I am leaving this review. I recommend this location now highly, come here and enjoy time with family and friends! Ryan will take care of you, and the food is always amazing!!"
Brittany R.,"Glendale, AZ",0,4,1,5.0,2/11/2016,"My husband and I came out to celebrate his birthday on 2/9/2016. We had the sweetest server. I can not remember her name because I am terrible with names, but she was tall, brunette, with a braid in her hair. We ordered a gluten free pizza, a chicken ranch pizza, and two pints. I have to say the gluten free pizza is one of the best gluten few pizzas I have ever had. Paired with the gluten free beer (pink beer, can not remember the name) made my meal amazing!! My husband loved his pizza and beer as well! The atmosphere was perfect and the pizookie we had, oh my it topped our night! We had such a great night that we will be coming back again soon for another date night. Ps. Thank you for having delicious gluten free beer that is on tap! I have never experienced this before because I have Celiac Disease. It is so nice to order a pint!!"
Hector S.,"Hawthorne, CA",245,5,,1.0,3/26/2016,"I should've looked up the reviews for this place before coming here. We usually go to the BJs in Torrance, CA and the service there is Amazing! Well this place is the complete opposite! We ordered appetizers and didn't get separate plates. The forks still had rice stuck to them. Once we got the plates, one of the plates was dirty with previous food on it. It took another 15 minutes to get clean fork and plate. We ordered a small pizza. It comes out and wasn't given a slice server....Asked for one and took another 15 minutes to get one! By this time our pizza is cold! So I bring it to our servers attention that our pizza is cold. We get offered a new fresh out the oven pizza. It has been quite a while now and we are still waiting for our pizza..."
Gayle M.,"Homeland, CA",0,5,,5.0,8/11/2016,Our school office tried the car service today.  It was terrific!  We placed our order online and then I went to pick up.  I parked in the designated spot and called the number.  My food was out to my car about 5  minutes after my pick up time.  We had a bigger order so that was no problem.  Everything was bagged nicely and the food was great when I got back to the office. Thanks for making my coworkers birthday special!!
Alexander M.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",3,6,,5.0,3/25/2016,"Steven was our server tonight and provided us with the most exceptional customer service I've ever received. This guy really goes above and beyond to not only connect with guests, but make them feel welcomed and as Starbucks would put it, feel as if they were at their second home. His service was comparable to a country club, that's how awesome he was. Please, please, promote him or give him a raise, he deserves it!"
Cassie B.,"Sun City, CA",0,2,,5.0,6/25/2016,"Bj's is a great place to eat.fast and delicious food. Great atmosphere.loved baked ziti, and watermellon margarita"
Marii A.,"Lake Forest, CA",71,7,,5.0,6/3/2016,"I love this location. Been here twice and both times the staff was awesome and food was great!!! beer was even better!!! Love it, lots of attention to detail. Everyone is working and doing their best. I really appreciate the environment."
Whitney H.,"Sun City, CA",2,29,10,2.0,5/28/2016,"The food is pretty good.... But the service is terrible. There is no reason it should take 20 minutes to get a drink. Every time we are finished with our meals, it takes another 20 minutes to get the check. Coming from patient people and good tippers, we've finally had it. We won't be coming back. Take your business somewhere else or to the Temecula location."
Tanya F.,"Redondo Beach, CA",150,109,42,4.0,4/18/2015,Came here for my best friend birthday lunch. It was a group of 9 so we were able to get a table within 5 minutes or so. Parking is good. Service was not too bad. We did need ask for refills on the drinks when I usually base good service on how empty my drink gets. A great waitress will never have an empty glass. My kids waited 10 min for a refil.  Food was excellent. I have the California chicken sandwich. It's perfect to share.
Taylor R.,"Temecula, CA",0,7,1,1.0,6/12/2017,"Only giving one star because our server was amazingI came here for the first time today on 06/11/17. I usually go to the BJ's in Temecula and they are always exceeding expectations with the quality of food and service. I was expecting the same here at the BJ's in Menifee and I was let down. What a complete disappointment. First we sit in a booth at the bar area. It smelled like sewage. We moved to another booth and it smelled better so we stayed. My boyfriend and I order Twisted BLT salads and they were TERRIBLE. The spinach was slimy and disgusting. We returned them with disappointment. It tasted like it was pre-made and was brought out of the fridge. We returned them with disgust and refused for it to be remade. Then the fries that came with my burger were cold and tasted like they have been sitting for over 30 minutes. I would not expect that at a fast food restaurant, much less at BJ's. NEVER coming back here again."
Scherry B.,"Hemet, CA",20,259,40,3.0,4/18/2016,"I think this place has ok food, expensive for the type of food. This location is a good one with customer service. Good root beer and cookies !!!"
Allen B.,"Riverside, CA",0,24,,3.0,7/9/2016,So what's the point of doing reservations at a certain time if we still have to wait 30 minutes. The staff in the front has no communication skills and I was very unpleased. The waitress was very attentive to our needs and that's why you have an extra star. This Bj's needs a little work in the front and on the phone giving customers wrong information.
Richard B.,"Murrieta, CA",185,31,23,4.0,5/13/2015,"Always get great service, genuine recommendations from the bartender, and great selections for food. I'm not sure why the ratings aren't higher for this location, and honestly I almost feel compelled to up my rating to 5 stars just because of all the negative and disgruntled reviews. Never have been disappointed with BJ's!"
Louis A.,"Riverside, CA",8,13,4,3.0,5/29/2016,"Food here is great as always, however I would recommend that you not come by when they are busy. They tend to forget about orders and request the more they get busy. I eat here quite a bit as this seems to be a regular issue. Nevertheless, aside from this annoying issues the atmosphere is solid and the food is great (minus the ahi tuna salad which they cut portion size down by 50%). If you have a few minutes to stop by and try their calimari you will not be disappointed"
Cristina P.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",0,15,,1.0,4/22/2016,Came in after work with some co workers.  We sat in the bar at the furthest back table.  There was just 2 of us at the time and we were waiting for others to join.  The cocktail server was over at one of the computers and she said uggg why did they sit at that add table (must be server lingo).  She then came over and with apparent attitude said how many people are in your party?  I looked at hr and said 6.  She then said ohhh ok. Clearly I would not have sat down at a table for 6 if there was only 2 of us. She had attitude throughout the entire time we were there.  I can not remember her name but she was blonde maybe 30's.  Mean as badger.  I have a suggestion BJs...if your employees want to talk about your customers have them go in the back where we can not hear them.
Frances S.,"Sun City, CA",10,54,24,1.0,9/27/2015,"Decided to get some lunch and we were disappointed with all the food we ordered.  Potato skins were so damn dry and tasteless, and our lunch was very salty.  It's times like thia we wish The Bewr Humter was still around!"
Judith M.,"Murrieta, CA",0,26,,5.0,6/23/2016,"We had a lazy day today so ordered from BJ's on grub hub, the food suffered just a touch temperature-wise because it was delivered but we were all still impressed. I imagine in the restaurant it would have been perfect. My husband had the salmon quinoa bowl- delicious with a little kick. My chicken pita tacos were beyond delicious and the quinoa salad that came with it was so stinking good my tongue jumped out of my mouth and I had to force it back in. Just crazy.  I got the rug rats a pizza and was not expecting the crust to be the worlds best dough in all of pizza-dom. Seriously, it was chewy where it should be chewy, crispy along the edges and riddled with happy little bubbles from the yeast. We have leftovers and to be frank that's gonna be my breakfast tomorrow, I am just not gonna be ashamed of this particular plan.  I know that some reviews for this restaurant aren't all that great but I have to say that we were all totally happy with our meal tonight."
Jose Z.,"Menifee, CA",10,24,61,5.0,2/14/2016,"Whether you are coming for a special occasion or just a nice dinner this place is it! The Ahi Poke appetizer and the avocado rolls are my favorite appetizers! ..I really don't  have a favorite entrée.. because I enjoy a lot on the menu here.. from delicious oven baked flat bread pizza.. to juicy burgers.. to an amazing chicken alfredo.. and you can't go wrong with their deserts!! Wow.. but wait, there is more.. their beer selection is extensive and of great variety! So whether you are on a liquid diet or an insatiable appetite this place will not disappoint. Only down side is it gets very loud as it gets busier. Other than that bon a petite!!!"
Veronica R.,"Murrieta, CA",3,23,1,2.0,3/6/2015,"I have been to this BJ'S plenty of times and I agree with a few others that the service is hit or miss. The food is always good which is why I didn't give this place one star, however, if you EVER need to bring your service animal with you, be prepared to get the stink face if you are greated by Holly.  Today I came to have lunch and brought my service dog, as I always do, not only did I get a dirty look as I walked in, but Holly was extremely rude. She told me I would have to wait to be seated as it was a ""Friday"" and people with reservations were coming in, it was 3 o'clock in the afternoon, the place was not busy at all. I asked her to provide a table that could accommodate my dog and again, she was rude and gave me dirty looks. I felt completely unwanted and felt as if I were doing something wrong. My dog is a service dog, not someone's pet that runs around acting like a maniac, he is VERY well mannered.  I didn't complain and I wasn't rude, I simply waited to be seated.  Once seated, I was greeted by two servers who were actually great and they were the reason I didn't ask for a manager. However, BJ'S really needs to consider who they choose to have greet people when they walk in the door, as they set the first impression of the place. Definitely not happy with Holly!"
DS K.,"Menifee, CA",0,6,,5.0,6/17/2016,"One of my favorite places! Beats all the other copy cats. Excellent food, excellent staff, excellent atmosphere...great place for a couple or the whole family!"
