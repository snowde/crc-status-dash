Giovanni G.,"Murrieta, CA",122,1,,5.0,5/29/2017,"Came here tonight for an anniversary dinner with my wife. Had a fabulous dinner with great service. Our server was Kayli and she was amazing. Very attentive, had great recommendations like the spinach artichoke dip and the Hopstorm IPA, WAS AMAZING!! Thanks for the great service we will definitely be back again."
Kelly D.,"Murrieta, CA",20,13,,1.0,4/21/2017,Hands down the worst BJ's I have ever been to. Avoid at all costs.
Kimberly F.,"Temecula, CA",89,13,,2.0,5/24/2017,"What can I say? 9 times out of 10 this location is a let down. Slow service, rude hostesses, poor management. My organization booked for 30 people the other night and they got the time wrong. They seemingly had time to put the tables together but left it at that until people started showing up and we asked if they could place tableware out. The servers were very nice but otherwise unprepared. I would think that the manager would step in to help out but she barked at us for voicing our displeasure because we were too loud for her tastes, and then disappeared. We've had other bad experiences here and did not come back for years. Looks like things haven't changed. Top down needs work."
David H.,"Menifee, CA",0,3,6,5.0,9/16/2017,Best BBQ chicken deep dish pizza. I love the food here.   The menu as a whole has tons of excellent options.
Jaclyn C.,"Temecula, CA",2,132,9,4.0,2/25/2017,"I enjoy coming here on my lunch breaks.  The service is fast and friendly.  They have a decent lunch menu with reasonable prices and the food is great.  My favorite is calamari and the pizza and salad.  Cant go wrong with this restaurant.  They have curbside dining for anyone who wants a hot meal that isn't fast food, and its brought to your car.  I love coming here and will be back."
Yolanda B.,"Menifee, CA",98,10,2,2.0,1/17/2017,"This is probably my 3rd time coming here in the past 3 months and each time I think it will be better than the last. Service needs tons of work. Always have to ask for silverware, I always have to ask for a refill on my drink, and it takes a ridiculously long time to get our food. The servers are not attentive what so ever. I hope they get it together before they lose tons of business"
Anthony A.,"Riverside, CA",63,61,183,2.0,12/4/2016,"Overall BJ's had pretty decent food. However I must say, the entire menu is over priced. I don't mind paying a little more for good food, but if your going to have a pricy menu at least have quality service. Our food came out cold, my water has no ice and the service is so slow I'd rather eat the cold food and drink the warm water then send it back."
Taija P.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",1,6,,5.0,3/9/2017,"Brandon helped us and did a GREAT job!! He needs a promotion! He helped a party of 8 all by himself. Nothing was late, and he had a great sense of humor. Food was fresh, recommended certain meals and alcoholic drinks, while still having conversation. Great waiter, and glad we came tonight to celebrate a couple family members being back in town. Will defiantly be coming back! Keep up the good work Brandon!! Ps: This was my first time coming, loved it. Recommend the Guacamole bacon burger and chocolate chip pazookie for desert!"
Elizabeth O.,"San Diego, CA",40,14,3,1.0,5/6/2017,"Came into BJ's today I did not get the experience that I expected ,first thing the waitress could not bring the correct food or drinks to our table . more than four times we were offered someone else's food when our food came the order was incomplete or wrong my ribs were burnt to a crisp which I had to send back. But the saddest part was it was my friend's birthday and they just said the Pizookie in front of the empty spot lit candle and walked away."
Amberleigh B.,"Las Vegas, NV",7,6,1,4.0,4/3/2017,Love the pizookis! I like going here with my family and never walk out unsatisfied. The food is always good and I have always had good service.
Murray G.,"Murrieta, CA",6,117,66,1.0,5/8/2016,"Fam wanted to go there today for Mom's Day. I ordered a seared Ahi salad . Talk about ripping people off. Remember "" where's the beef""? Well this was "" where's the Ahi"".  $15.50 for smidgen of food. Rip off and a half."
Eric C.,"Chino, CA",0,4,5,5.0,3/25/2017,"Lovin' BJ's pizza. They have a huge menu, food for all diet types! I recently had the Kale and roasted Brussel Sprouts salad. YUM. They have their beers as well. The GOLIATH IMPERIAL Red is my new favorite. Great atmosphere, staff is friendly, the building design is super cool. it is a fun place to hang out, eat pizza, drink beer and chill with friends. What else could you want?"
Don B.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,133,44,1.0,1/10/2017,"Next time you want to have a VERY leisurely dinner, I mean cold food and all, try this B J's. the wait after you order is UNBELIEVABLE!  Then you ask for a manager and THAT takes another 15-20 minutes. Horrible!  Imagine after that trying to get dessert..."
Adrienne D.,"Menifee, CA",470,33,27,5.0,5/24/2016,"I went here shortly after it opened and I wasn't impressed with the food at all. I went two more times and just stopped going until today because the food wasn't very good at all.  I have to say, I'm not sure what happened--but it was a good change today! The cheese-stuffed mashed potatoes were fantastic!  They skimped on the asparagus though, and it was very small asparagus spears, but the meal overall was pretty good.  I am writing this review because I'm eating healthfully now and this was a business luncheon, so I had a ""cheat day"" today and ordered their rich dessert--HUGE cookie with white chips and I think macadamia nuts and vanilla ice cream, chocolate crunchies and caramel--holy cow!  This is my new favorite dessert!  You made my cheat day fantastic and I'll have to come back and try you guys out again now."
Nora L.,"Sun City, CA",49,6,28,2.0,2/8/2017,"I rate it a 2 because the first time I went my service wasn't good and on top the food was okay ,I would've thought it could be better being a high end restaurant  but since then I haven't gone."
Cindy T.,"Chino Hills, CA",0,5,,1.0,12/3/2016,"Recently moved to this area and was thrilled to find BJ's nearby. I didn't want to believe the reviews because we've always loved eating at other BJ's and have hosted our pre-holiday family dinner for 25 every year since 2010.   This location is horrible, the food was mediocre and the service was terrible. We went for Sat AM brunch at 10:30 am and there were only 4 other tables of diners yet the waitress was so slow and unfocused. We ordered coffee and I swear she went to Columbia to harvest the beans, grind and brew the coffee. We ordered lunch salads and had to flag the waitress for more dressing which took another 7-10 minutes. Lunch was delivered by a runner but we couldn't find our waitress for catsup. We had to walk around the restaurant to find someone to finally get some. The topping was we paid cash for our bill but the waitress completely shorted us on the change, so it was deducted from her tip. When we left, there were about 7 other parties and at least 3 other waitresses and a bartender, so they were not short staffed by any means. Needless to say, we won't be back to this location.  An important message to BJ's management: the service at this BJ's is a reflection of YOUR poor staff training and overall poor management skills.  It's all about customer service and if you can't train your staff correctly, you will continue to lose good customers and your business will truly suffer or close down.  In the food industry, taking care of your customers should always be your top priority.  FYI, I have never written such a poor review EVER but was truly disappointed and disgusted with our experience.  1 star was overly generous and BJ's corporate office really needs to investigate and follow up."
Dinorah V.,"Menifee, CA",182,11,,4.0,10/4/2016,one word pizookies!!  Great service!  Great food! Lot's of beer choises. Long wait but worth it!!
Jeff A.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",1,38,2,4.0,1/16/2017,Food is usually good. Although they've messed up my order many times. However more often than not the manager comes out and takes care of it so we keep coming back. Love their brew lineup though.
Abigail C.,"Anaheim, CA",330,158,131,4.0,10/3/2015,"Great food. Pretty fast service. Came on a Saturday night at 6pm and got seated right away. Our food also came out pretty fast. Nice, clean restaurant. I've gotten good and bad service here before so it's inconsistent but the food is always good!  Love all the cocktails! And of course always save room for a chocolate chip pazookie!"
Stephanie P.,"Menifee, CA",28,11,1,1.0,7/14/2017,"I wouldn't even give this place one star, horrible!!!Do not go there, customer service was awful. We waited almost an hour and a half for an order that was all wrong. The servers have bad attitudes and the manger didn't seem to care. Never will I go back there!!!"
