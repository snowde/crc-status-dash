Fredrick T.,"Murrieta, CA",50,12,,5.0,1/10/2017,I come here for lunch sometimes and enjoy the beef dip and the wonderful oasis amber. The servers are always wonderful and I never have to wait longer then 5 min to get a table. I only have an hour for lunch and they do a great job getting you fed and back to work on time.
Carl B.,"Murrieta, CA",1,56,16,3.0,3/24/2016,"Me and the wife went after happy hour. . Found 2 seats at the bar at the end. After being ignored for 10 minutes . I caught the eye of the bar tender . Saying. ""Hi we are over here""  I was greeted by a "" that is very rude I know you are here"" Amazingly we left.  I go there once a week at lunch time normally, and from now will never go back. Any time."
Sally A.,"Placentia, CA",86,31,8,1.0,5/29/2015,"Updating my review from a year ago. I decided to try them out again, figuring everyone has a bad day and maybe I just caught them on one of theirs. Nope. This is hands down the worst restaurant in the area. First I came in on my own with my 3yr old & 1 yr old. I know they're my kids and my problem but when I specifically ask for a booth with a high chair, I kind of expect someone to bring a high chair. The hostess just left me standing there holding a baby for a good 5 minutes until I had to grab my 3 yo and take him with me to find one. Not one server who whizzed by me asked if I needed help. Clearly if you see someone standing next to a table with a baby on their hip and there's no high chair in sight, they need one. Strike 1 Strike 2 - kids Apple juice. They water it down. Seriously I'm not kidding. (Picture included). I water my kid's down so I know what that tastes like. I asked the waitress and she acted like I was crazy but still brought me a new one which amazingly tasted like apple juice. If you're cutting corners watering down Apple juice then I don't want to know what else you're doing.  Strike 3 - the food. Oh my god if I wanted a handful of crushed tostitoes and Costco salsa I could have made my own lunch. The boys cheeseburger was basically one patty placed in the middle of 2 slider buns. My baby eats everything and he spit it out on the floor. I tried it. It was the worst burger. No seasoning. Dry. Disgusting. It really upsets me when restaurants treat kids like shit by making them shitty food because they probably won't complain about it. My shrimp tacos was were cold.  Strike 4 - the giant pile of dust on the ledge behind me. Don't tell me that happened overnight.  Overall we will never be back. It's really sad because the Brea location is great. I haven't been to a worse restaurant than the Menifee BJ's in a long time."
Marsha L.,"Menifee, CA",0,10,,1.0,1/1/2017,"The problem with BJ's is their service sucks, they act like coupon Nazis if your coupon is two hours old they won't accept it, very low class. The waitresses are for the most part pretty snooty and stuck up and abysmally slow. I think they belong in a turtle farm. To be fair the food is good but I'm not going to patronize a restaurant where I'm treated like crap by the waitresses who think that just because they're young and cute that they can give horrible service.  They  are very disingenuous. There are couple of veteran waitresses Who are pretty good and polite but why in the hell does it take 10 minutes for a waitress to get change? Maybe she thinks the longer she makes you wait you will just forget about it and not need any change.  It's very clear that most of the waitresses hate their jobs  and they need to stay in college. What is unbelievable is there are so many complaints about this  place yet nothing is done about it, I guess they don't care about the regular customers.I think the waitress thinks BJ stands for being jerks"
Jacob B.,"Perris, CA",60,1,,1.0,7/3/2017,"Normally I love going to BJs but after last night I doubt we will ever be returning. My son, boyfriend and I all got food poising from there and our waiter actually really sucked."
Sandra C.,"Murrieta, CA",0,4,,1.0,7/25/2017,"Very disappointed in this place. Lovely restaurant but the food is sad and very overpriced. Happy hour is reduced wine and nothing else, the price of the wine is too much for the pour you get. The quality of the food for the cost is awful. There are too many other better value restaurants in the area. Don't waste your time coming here."
Bailey S.,"Murrieta, CA",0,11,1,3.0,4/3/2016,"Every time I've gone here it's taken way too long to get food. I worked as a hostess and server so I understand but I've gone when it's really slow and still, poor Service . Sorry."
Lucy B.,"Winchester, CA",0,7,,3.0,1/28/2017,"Ive been herw twice now.  I am always down to give a place another try but nope,  never again. The food was not that great but the service was bad both times.  Don't let this one place give you a bad taste in your mouth.  They aren't all this bad."
Sal M.,"Los Angeles, CA",293,1582,2037,3.0,4/20/2015,Came with a few friends for late night and it was okay. Had the Parmesan Garlic wings and they were creamy but good enough. The avocado egg rolls were not great at all.  Staff was polite and attentive but then again we arrived close to 11pm and I believe they close at 1am.
Roberto T.,"Murrieta, CA",160,6,31,5.0,12/23/2016,"Totally love this place.. the host was extremely nice and the server even nicer.. We are big gift card users and love that the server reminded us about our gift cards!! The place was crowded, but the wait was minimal.. it pays to wait to great place to eat... cant wait to go back once we get more gift cards to this amazing place!!"
Jennifer M.,"Canyon Lake, CA",671,56,45,2.0,10/5/2016,"This location is very hit or miss. Service is usually so so...our last visit the majority of our food came out lukewarm. With more and more options in the area, they should eat it togeth"
Dominique C.,"Menifee, CA",4,46,1,4.0,5/20/2016,ok spot for a quick bite... Came in and went straight to the bar.  Had dinner there to not have to wait 30 minutes for a table! Server was great... food was good.
Julie M.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",0,19,,2.0,8/1/2017,"I've been here a couple of times now and it's always dirty. The menus, the table it just feels grimy. The staff isn't the best either, not very friendly and the servers always seem too busy to actually serve."
D M.,"Calimesa, CA",26,42,10,1.0,3/13/2016,"Overall service was horrible, from the time we walked into get service they were talking within each other for awhile then looked at us and said one minute, our server took a while to come to our table to only get drink orders and disappear until Steven J came to help us. Finally the manager came over to  see what happened, followed up by i will stop.back by and never did. The food was ok but my husband's rice was under cooked. Not worth the headache and or money. If I could only rate our server Steven J  I would rate him 4 stars but the rest of our experience is not worth any stars"
Amber R.,"Menifee, CA",35,43,53,3.0,11/12/2016,"This place was top notch when It first opened, but has really gone down with value vs. price. The avocado egg rolls went up in price $2 and down in quality. The BBQ chicken salad used to be fresh and crisp- The last 2 times it was soggy and over-dressed. I highly recommend asking for outdoor seating when it's packed. It's quieter and quicker  seating."
Jose U.,"Upland, CA",37,16,2,2.0,4/11/2015,"Let's start with the front of the house. We arrived with a larger group 4 adults and 5 children.  We were told 5 minutes, actually took 15-20 minutes.  Ordered chips and salsa to hold us over but took way too long to get us this appetizer, not a lot of cooking so not sure why it took so long. As we got Part way through our chips we noticed a big piece of bacon in our chips.  The bacon was cold so not sure how old it was. Told the waitress but she just laughed. Food took forever to get to us. Ordered Pizookie  but was half cooked. We got a coupon but overall, the experience was not good.  I don't blame the wait staff, they were all hustling, I just think management is too cheap to hire more waitstaff."
Lena M.,"Memphis, TN",14,66,17,3.0,10/14/2016,"A true manager of WOW customer service understands net promoter scores and how negative reviews can have an impact on their business.  Chris the manager reached out, apologized for their service, explained what happened and sent a $50 gift card. Definitely will return to this BJs."
Heather M.,"Greenville, SC",178,9,,5.0,1/12/2017,Went in right at open. Amanda was our waitress and was awesome. Great food and love their orange soda
David S.,"Murrieta, CA",51,35,5,5.0,12/9/2016,Going a little off menu with a chili burger.  It's my favorite thing here.  Service is excellent from both Kelli and the bartender Anthony. Great drinks and prompt service.
Matt S.,"Perris, CA",5,7,2,4.0,5/30/2015,"Alright...I almost didn't eat here because of all the terrible reviews, but my friend Jerry twisted my arm then put me in a headlock and I finally agreed to try out this BJs ...when he agreed to pay for the meal..lol    First off the service was prompt and efficient...2nd the server was very helpful. In her suggestion and patient with my very exacting friend..we ate the BJ special pizza and. Fantastic pizookie...everything was delicious as should be...nothing,out of this world, but the meal and service were great...plus the server was cute.."
