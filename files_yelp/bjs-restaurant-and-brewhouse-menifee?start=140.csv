Michael P.,"West Hollywood, CA",5,59,1,5.0,4/26/2017,"I had a stellar experience here. From the food to the server, we were treated promptly and well. My friends and I had a few ice cold beers. We were there for Happy hour and boy were we happy. The Greek pizza was delicious and the Fall off the bone Ribs were the highlight of the evening. The fries we ordered came out hot, just how I like them. There is so much to choose from on the menu. I've been coming to BJ's for years and have visited multiple locations; From  Century City, Temecula, Rancho Cucamonga, San Diego, to Menifee. Always a pleasant experience. And the Pizookie how can I forget, the perfect treat to share with friends. I look forward to returning."
CC U.,"Sun City, CA",51,32,29,5.0,5/5/2016,"Great service, great food!! My fav is the Mediterranean tacos & a side of broccoli!!! YUMMY!!! My husband and I always get the same thing! Highly recommend these tacos!!! Great amount of food, no skimping here! And the prices are WAY worth the food!"
Richard C.,"Winchester, CA",5,3,,1.0,9/16/2016,"It would be nice if the bartenders cared about there customers as much as there side work or talking with each other .  I have only had one good experience .  Pretty sure I'm done.  Gave them the benefit of the doubt .  Bar keep poured dark beer straight into the glass, no tilt major foam major wait and still had to wait 5 min before I could drink what she gave me, never even asked my name.  Spent her time with the regulars at the bar a couple and one guy.  Oh and texting.  The only time she came back was to ask if I wanted another one. I politely told her I didn't even sang that one. Paid and left for my last time. Sad ."
Holly L.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",0,11,,1.0,6/22/2017,"We are usually very understanding, but when two medium steaks take 40+ minutes that's already annoying. Then we are offered a free dessert, 20 mins later still do not receive it. It went to the wrong table! Wait for another and once again wait 20 more minutes for it to go to the wrong table! Got fed up and walked out, never heard from a manager or anything. Do not recommend!"
Sherry G.,"Menifee, CA",0,28,,1.0,6/19/2017,"I have been here many times in the past,and was very satisfied with the service and food.But on June 17,2017 at 11:00 pm,We came with the Family after My daughter graduated from College for a late dinner/get together. We were served by Bryonna,She took our drink request and then came back to  the table and took Our orders,it took quite  awhile for Us to get Our meal,but We didn't mind that,for as We were celebrating with the family. My daughter ordered the pizza,asked if it could be the thin crust,it was burnt on the bottom,I ordered Clam Chowder Sop and Cesar   soup was cold in the middle and I tried to get the sever attention,a nice,Afro American guy came and he took My soup and again,I had to ask after about for My soup,Bryonna came and said that She was sorry,it still was not hot,luke warm . My husband was not hungry,he had ordered  the MAC&Cheese off the appetizer men-again it was ice cold in the middle and had  to be   son in laws pulled pork was ok,but he said the fries were luke warm and so was My grandsons.Otherwise the other things We ordered for all six of Us was so so.there was no one in eating area,only the bar area,so I know there was no excuse for this.i think they were getting ready to close and had their minds on that. We will not return for that reason-its a shame,I liked them in the past.Table 421"
Celeste B.,"Huntington Beach, CA",78,28,2,5.0,10/4/2016,"I love this bjs! The food is great, and out fast, and the service is friendly. My server was savannah, and she was very attentive and very helpful. Had a great experience. Will be coming back."
Alyssa J.,"San Diego, CA",21,13,6,1.0,2/23/2016,"Unfortunately giving this place zero stars isn't an option. We had the most unfortunate dining experience last night, which is usually not the case in a BJs.  1) our waiter was brand new. I get that being new, you are probably going to be more nervous than most, but when I can barely hear you talking to me and you are standing less than a foot away from me, clearly you don't have the people skills to begin with to even be hired for the job. Not once did he smile or make eye contact with any one in our table. He just looked outright petrified. Oh. And he forgot to put in our appetizer. Then I asked for additional water,  that took him ten minutes to track down a water pitcher and bring it back.  2) manager that came over to apologize (about said missing appetizer) did what he needed to do to ""make face"" with the customer and remove it from our check. No biggie, but I got the impression that he does this all the time from his ""forced car salesman"" approach to talking to customers. Not bad, just annoying because it didn't come across as sincere or genuine concern for his guests experience.  3) when our food came out, the pizza was cold. The salads looked like a bowl of blue cheese dressing with some lettuce and tomatoes thrown on top. YUM. Of course by this time we were already annoyed and just wanted to eat and leave.  4) but you can't leave BJs without a pizzookie.  So our pizzookie came out. With two spoons. There were three of us. The server (not the newbie) said ""oh would you like me to bring you out a third spoon?""  Of course. Well, she disappeared into the abyss never to return with the third spoon. Ten minutes later we finally tracked down a third spoon so we could all actually enjoy our dessert without having to play musical spoons. The best part was watching about 6 staff members congregate together near one of the stations to ""hang out"" when we were trying to flag down someone to find us a spoon! Bottom line, it was a night of just comical errors because of a place who doesn't have their operations together. If you want a dining experience where your waiter only shows up three times (I really do think he may have been having a panic attack in the back because he was so scared of people), have someone different bring you your food cold (I think we had 5 different servers), and someone else entirely bring you your check (no clue where that guy came from), then this is the place for you.  If not, stay away.  And advice to management, your front of house needs help. You can have the best employees in the world (minus the ones who are scared to talk to people) but without the operational structure and processes to back them up, you are leaving them with no way to do their job effectively. And that's what your customers are going to see.  Our waiter never checked on us (he stopped back by to apologize about the appetizer again, and to run our card to pay), the servers just dropped our food and ran. Attention to detail and guest engagement goes a long way to make a good memorable experience."
Jackie E.,"Menifee, CA",82,4,2,3.0,3/2/2016,"My friends and I came out to celebrate her birthday a few weeks ago. Honestly the service at this location is always slow but that night it went to a whole other level. Our first server Nick was honestly terrible. He was overwhelmed by the simplest tasks. He seemed nervous and kept fumbling his words. It took him 30 minutes just to get us water and another 15 to take our order. If we weren't so hungry that night we would have left. But it wasn't just with us, he was so bad that the table across from us got up and left without even touching their food. We were honestly amazed that the manager told us he was one of their better servers. Luckily Steven happened to walk by and saved our night. He immediately took over and took care of us. He was funny and fast and we ended up chatting the entire time we were there. Steven really is the best server I've ever had at that location and the only reason why I would go back."
Doggy I.,"Hemet, CA",1,105,11,1.0,1/3/2017,Ordered a parmesan crusted chicken and it was good but they didn't bring out my broccoli and took forever to get it out. When they did it was only a few peices.... we also ordered a pulled pork sandwich which came with coleslaw which was very watery and bland with a freezer burn taste. We asked for another and when they finally gave it to us it looked like the exact same pieces we had them take back.  dessert was over priced and absolutely nothing special. No problem with the waitress but the server's had no personality.... did the care for this experience and won't be back...
Derrick F.,"Perris, CA",0,2,,2.0,5/4/2017,"I only gave 2 stars because the food great. Our server Stephanie left a lot to be desired. We had to ask for eating utensils, I asked for water with no Lemon, you know it came with lemon. They for got the dipping sauce for the appetizer.  She just seemed like she did not want to be there. If that was the case she should have stayed home. It might be a while before I come back to this location. There are just too many choices out there."
David V.,"Murrieta, CA",2,18,,1.0,1/18/2016,Been here twice and all around terrible service and food sat down for 22 min before even asked to get our drinks. No joke I'm not making this up. All around horrible experience messed up on my salad and burger and pizza everything was messed up and yet I still got stuck with a bill for $132+ $15 tip so out the door $147. The manager never even came to apologize or try and do anything about it even after I already talked to him after waiting for ever for any help. Just crazy people go here     I just left and I am still hungry cause they never got the food right even the pizza they re did came back so gross and not even cooked. So I guess drive through in an out. Since I just wasted all my money at this place that straight robbed us.  Once a month my wife and I with three kids try to go out to have a nice dinner and this is what we get. Really sucks  Great way to take advantage of a young family of 5. Think twice before you go here.
Sarah B.,"Menifee, CA",0,4,,1.0,12/19/2016,"Terrible food. I have been to other BJ's and the food is good, but at this location it was different. The portion of the meat was small and seemed microwaved and tough. One of our salmon meals was raw on the inside. All of the food was over salted and did not seem fresh. We decided to leave, which we never do, and go to Red Robin instead."
Nick M.,"Sun City, CA",0,2,,2.0,5/29/2016,"The food isn't the problem. The service is. As other reviews have noted that can be slow and forgetful, and I would emphasize they're too often downright rude. Talking with friends and family there has even been accusations of a waiter talking down to customers for ordering drinks because he himself didn't drink (his name was Andrew). I was at their opening when they were at their best, and I've only seen the quality of waiters and waitresses decline since.  The food quality is good, but there's other good food in the area. If you get them on a good day and they're kind to you then you'll get good food and a fine dining experience, but if you don't want to take a chance to be hassled, insulted, made to wait and forced to leave angry, then choose something else."
Brittany D.,"Hemet, CA",64,14,,1.0,6/19/2017,"My family went out to dinner last night for Father's Day, and for my husbands first Father's Day. A day that's supposed to memorable and special. I wish I could give zero stars. The restaurant was not busy surprisingly and our waitress Melina .F. Was the worst server I have ever had in my life. Our appetizer that was chips and salsa took so long it came after our meals had already come to the table, our meals took almost an hour to get to the table, the dishes piled up on our table, drinks were empty for a really long time, was not given any utensils and she didn't have very good welcoming instincts what's so ever. I'm sad to say that my experience was so terrible that her service was more memorable than the family time that should have been. I don't know how she got hired on but this experience has left a bad taste in my mouth for BJ's now. I feel like my money and time was wasted. Very disappointed."
Tiffany W.,"Corona, CA",40,23,4,5.0,2/15/2017,I love BJ's in all cities. I had a really great server though at this location and he was incredible and personable and even though the restaurant was crazy busy on a week day he checked on us and brought snacks for the kids prior to their meal. I love this BJ's.
John R.,"Aguanga, CA",93,4,1,5.0,10/18/2016,"Teresa J is so awesome, because of her my wife and I  will be returning., and we live over 30 miles away. Thumbs up to Teresa J"
Derek C.,"Menifee, CA",100,76,199,5.0,2/15/2016,One thing I can say about BJ's is that their selection of food is always excellent. We came for happy hour and sat in Angela's section. Service was excellent as she was very attentive and always with a smile. Food was piping hot as requested!  We ordered appetizers only and I would like to mention that the root beer baby back ribs were incredibly delicious and fall off the bone. This is our hometown BJ's and they have always been consistent in service!  Stop by if you're in Menifee and ask for Angela!
Jen L.,"Canyon Lake, CA",0,10,,1.0,1/2/2017,Terrible service!! Waited 30 minutes before we had to ask someone to send our waitress over to take our order. As of now we have been here one hour and still no meal. I did speak to the manager and he just kept asking what do you want? I said my dinner. I am ready to just leave. I do not recommend this place!! I have heard great things about the Temecula location.
Mysterouis F.,"Buffalo, WY",0,3,,1.0,11/16/2016,They have us raw chicken on our salad and gave me mayo on my sandwich and I didn't even want mayo cause mayo is gross
Jeanette Joy F.,"Murrieta, CA",1311,120,198,5.0,1/9/2016,"Great service by Kelly P. As always, yummy food. I ordered my meal split to take home because I never eat it all they brought it out half boxed up. Left room for bites of triple chocolate mini Pizookie. So full and satiated! It's all about the experience here. Fun and fulfilling!"
