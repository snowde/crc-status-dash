Jonathan D.,"Menifee, CA",47,7,,3.0,10/4/2016,"Food is decent, beer is good, but plan on spending a couple of hours there. The service is so slow it's unreal."
Melissa C.,"Murrieta, CA",112,19,29,1.0,12/6/2015,"What was supposed to be a nice family dinner turned out to be a joke. Our server was polite, however, he was a bit absent-minded. Started out without silverware, which was the hostesses job, and had to ask for them again 30 minutes later when our calamari appetizer arrived. We were glad to place our order quick, but after asking twice about when we will be getting our appetizer and forgetting to check on it, 30 minutes was way too long for calamari to come out. The reason, according to our server, was that they weren't sure if HE will be bringing out the appetizer, or if the MANAGER was going to bring it out. So it was just sitting there, getting cold, waiting for someone to take it? That doesn't make sense to me.  During this time, we noticed the couple sitting next to us... waiting. Not sure if our server was their server, but no one ever came by to say hi or ask for their drinks. I felt bad for them as they constantly were looking around to see if someone was going to acknowledge them. I don't even think they knew who their server was. They ended up leaving. Not sure if they spoke to a manager, but they were pretty upset. We were also considering just getting up to leave, even though we had already placed our order. Finally our food comes 20 minutes later. We ordered 2 seared ahi salads, a small pizza, and a holiday pairing. The salads had no dressings - had to flag someone down to get us dressing, which ultimately delayed us longer in trying to have a decent dinner. On top of that, both the pizza and the holiday pairing entree were less than warm. The pan that the pizza was baked in was cool to the touch. We explained to our server these little discrepancies and apologized, saying he will speak to a manager to see if there was anything they will be able to do. We were hoping he would speak to the manager, but we think he forgot that too. Our big ticket came out to $94 with a ""tip."" We've been here numerous times and this is by far the worst experience we've had as a family. And don't use ""defiantly"" in your responses to people's yelp reviews. It's spelled ""definitely."""
bertrand r.,"Menifee, CA",0,12,,2.0,11/5/2016,"Cons: 1) We got there around 11:30 am and they were not ready and made us wait a few minutes. The place was empty. 2) Attempted to seat us in a bad spot, in a small table in the way, despite the place being empty. 3) We picked a good booth out of the way with enough room. However they put a family next to us with a kid that hit me in the shoulder while playing. Remember the place was empty so why did they seat a family next to us? Incredible! 4) The food was good but expensive. Paid $56 for two people. 5) Asked to pay the bill while my friend was in the bathroom. So instead of taking the money and ringing me up she cleaned the table and took plates away that were not finished. By the time she came back, minutes later, my friend had returned from the bathroom.  Pros:  1) The food was good. 2) The place was clean. 3) Started out empty but filled up quickly with a good mix of people. Conclusion:  The staff are not up to speed and make a good restaurant undesirable. Despite this it is one of the best places to eat, if not the best, in Menifee. The place has potential."
Cindy W.,"Carlsbad, CA",2232,1937,4290,2.0,8/2/2013,"I'm here a lot because I like to try all the dishes at this place and the menu is big. Also because my husband likes the craft beers here. Tonight we came here for a family dinner like our usual Friday and we were seated immediately due to calling ahead.  Our waitress came and took our drinks order and appetizer. It took awhile for us to get our drinks and our appetizer, over 15 minutes wait for drinks? Strike 1.  Our appetizer came, we ordered the avocado egg rolls but didn't have utensils or plates so we had to flag our waitress down and by this point, our daughter has already eaten half of the egg rolls with her hands. Strike 2.  We put in our order for our entrees, which again took awhile. We looked around and it wasn't as busy as it normally is so I was wondering what was taking so long. Our dishes came out and my husband didn't have ketchup for his fries and my daughter's plate didn't include the applesauce we ordered. Again, it took awhile to flag down our waitress to get that in. Strike 3.  My husband finished his margarita and realized our waitress didn't give him water like we normally get when we are here. It's automatic to get water along with your drink so again we had to flag down our waitress for water and noticed she was in the back wall chatting with a few waitresses. It took her awhile to notice us and it took her over 10 minutes to come out with the water. Strike 4.  When we asked for the check and boxes, we didn't get a bag to carry all the boxes since we have an infant and a toddler to carry out, you would think she'd include a bag for easier carrying but she didn't. Strike 5.  We tipped her 12% instead of our usual 20% to waitresses. 12% for doing nothing. Not a bad way to make money. We were going to order the new white chocolate raspberry pizookie because a part of that goes to charity whenever you order s pizookie. But we were so fed up with our waitress that we skipped dessert.  If the service keeps up like this, BJs will lose their loyal customers because now we're questioning if we even want to come back anymore."
Alexis E.,"Sacramento, CA",0,10,7,1.0,9/11/2016,Went a few hours ago with my cousin and both she and I ended up getting food poisoning. She ended up getting sick at the restaurant and I was a few hours later. Something or someone who prepared the food tonight is not clean. We both ordered two entirely different menu items yet still got sick. I will never go to this restaurant again.
Patricia D.,"Murrieta, CA",1,13,9,1.0,9/28/2016,"Avoid this place like leprosy !!!! Horrible customer service, Horrible food!!! Came in with my husband, they Had us waiting for two hours only to get cold, burned food. We talked to the manager and his reply was I can give you a $10 gift card that you can use on your next purchase of over $35. What a joke!!! Honestly, avoid his place. Make the extra drive to Temecula, it will be worth it."
Kim O.,"Corona, CA",190,313,2282,1.0,10/22/2015,"Gosh i absolutely hate having to write this review because my daughter was once a waitress at another location and have never had a bad experience prior to tonight.  While visiting a friend here in Menifee , she recommended we meet up here.... sounds great! I enjoy the vibe and food here. My friend arrived 15min earlier than me . As I sat down and spoke for about 15min , I realized nobody had came by to greet me. She had said that she had not seen her since she first arrived. .. what?! Almost 25-30 min?!! First we opened our silverware from their rolled up linen napkins. Yuck , both our silverware had dirty food/water spots from tip to bottom.  Then the linen napkin looked as though it had been used by the customers prior to us arrival.  GROSS! I EMEDITLY got STEPHANIE, our waitresses attention and requested paper napkins & plastic utensils. ... DON'T EVER EAT WITH DIRTY UTENSILS.  BIG HEALTH HAZARDS.  GOOGLE IT. We Emeditly ordered the  oven roasted brussel sprouts as a appatizer. Our entrées  were Salmon Ceasar salad & bunless portobello mushroom cheeseburger well done. First the brussel sprouts were soggy/looked & tasted as though they boiled them quickly /and stuck them in the oven to give them the roasted color. After 1 bite we both agreed to NOT to continue eating them. Asked to have them taken off our check... No problem  Second the salmon salad.  After the 3 or 4 bites she had a mouthful of 1/2 frozen /raw salmon. Yuck! Absolutely disgusting ! She literal started to gag at the table. DOUBLE YUCK! My well done hamburger that i had requested was medium /very pink. Called manager over named CHRIS , emeditly he started to make excuses after excuse why our order was NOT prepared properly. We just asked to have everything removed from our table.  As we were sitting there trying to process everything the 2 ladies next to our both got our attention to say that their utensils were also fithy. What is going on!? As you can guess we did NOT get the Pumpkin pizookie which was a really a bummer....We were too scared to eat one more item at this location.  Will not recommend this location."
Amy M.,"Menifee, CA",12,79,2,4.0,8/21/2016,"We've been here twice.  First time was okay for lunch.  Second time we went for dinner.  My sister in law joined us and she mentioned she wasn't impressed with the waitress.  She asked her about one of the beer samplers and didn't get much of an answer so we ended passing on the beer.  My son ordered the pizza and didn't care much for it.  Salad, appetizers and other food that came to the table pretty much got wiped out though.  I think the food is pretty decent here and the servings are generous. My daughter really likes this restaurant so I'm sure we'll be back.  I like that the calories are listed on the menu."
Mike C.,"Menifee, CA",204,37,69,4.0,3/6/2016,First time having breakfast here.  Didn't even know they did breakfast. I got the California Scramble which was very good.  I got the pancakes in place of toast. Pancakes were pancakes nothing special there. The scramble was very flavorful and filling. Service was great. Fast and friendly. Definitely suggesting this to others.
Juliet E.,"Menifee, CA",352,98,6,5.0,8/25/2016,Still enjoy coming here to relax after work. Blaire and Brian are the best bartenders of all time!
Adalley C.,"Murrieta, CA",285,2,,1.0,5/8/2017,I went to bjs last night in menifee and we had stephaine . She was absolutely terrible. She was fake and tried to act nice. She took 20 mins to take my familys order 2 of my friends left due to her taking so long . She took 15 mins to fill my water up after I asked for a refill. We ordered dessert and she came to our table 2 times telling us they were coming out and she saw them but still took 20 more mins to get to us. I'm never coming to this location again. Absolutely terrible server .
Jake W.,"Murrieta, CA",0,4,,2.0,4/14/2017,"I Love The Food. The waiter poured some soda, on my mobile phone, my leather case on my phone, so I had to clean my case and my phone and check for no liquid damage, the waiter didn't have any apology."
Mae H.,"Sun City, CA",21,97,250,3.0,1/30/2015,"I always enjoy the beer and food here. Unfortunately service is guaranteed to be hit or miss. Sometimes you get a server who can handle the hustle and bustle that is BJ's. Sometimes you don't. Tonight we got Courtney, and service was a hit. Everything was done in a timely manner from drinks and refills to entrées and appetizers.  I always order the Parmesan crusted chicken and I love it. A go to for appz is their combo platter with a little bit of everything. Other yelpers are spot on in recommending the avacado egg roll, and that sauce that comes with it is finger lickin good. The crowds deter us from coming here often, but the food/beer keeps us coming back.   Cons: It gets ridiculously crowded It's ridiculously dark inside the restaurant in the evenings. Service is inconsistent Pros: Great beer selection Good food Pizookies"
Joyce A.,"Vail, AZ",0,3,,5.0,1/12/2017,"I've always enjoyed this restaurant chain, however today was my best experience ever.  Food was wonderful...service (Karen) was fantastic... Love love love the coffee. Thank you"
Stefanie H.,"Murrieta, CA",17,13,2,4.0,9/5/2016,The food is always amazing from here whether I order out or dine in. My rating is 4 stars because days service is better than others. Its hit or miss
Emily G.,"Perris, CA",0,9,1,1.0,10/7/2016,"The worst! We were here since 7pm and left at 10:30 pm! The food was so late , the waiter forgot everything we asked for, our food was cold and the waiter spilled a drink all over my friend! Then when we ordered a rack of ribs and an hour later they said they were barely putting them on the grill then 20 min later AGAIN they said that they didn't have the ingredients for them when my other friend had ordered a half rack when we first ordered and got them! A bunch of liars and bad service!"
Kris T.,"Corona, CA",0,7,1,1.0,4/6/2017,"I love BJ's. But this Menifee restaurant needs to work on cleanliness. Last night I took a friend for her first time at BJ's. There was hair on the table when we first sat down. There was food stuck between many pages of the menu. When my friend unrolled her silverware from the napkin, her fork was crusted with food. My pizza arrived with a long black hair lying across the top. I won't be back to this one."
Jia S.,"Temecula, CA",1,70,210,3.0,8/13/2016,The hostess called to seat us. The table wasn't ready so we had to wait back outside. Finally we got a table after 30 mins of waiting even though we were told the wait was only for 15 mins. The hostess walked past us with another group of guest and pretty much ended up being sent back to wait some more cuz the table was not ready either. They should make sure the table is ready to go before they call the guests up. So they won't have to walk to the table only to be walked back to wait some more. Food here is awesome though! Love the ahi poke!
Michael B.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",27,62,3,3.0,7/27/2016,"Food is always pretty mediocre. Service is always really slow and not to mention... EXPENSIVE for what you are getting. The pizza is by far the best, the burger is terrible."
Mike P.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",52,9,17,1.0,12/22/2016,"The staff at this location is horrible, they need to fire basically all of them and start over. Gave the hostess my name, she said it would be 5 minutes, 15 minutes later after 5 families went in front of us, i went up to the booth to ask when we would be called, the lady said she had called us. She never called us. Then the manager wanted to argue. We left, absolutely terrible service."
