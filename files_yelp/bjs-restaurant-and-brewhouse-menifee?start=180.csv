Goldy L.,"Menifee, CA",110,119,88,5.0,7/8/2016,"It's VERY VRRY GOOD.  We went yesterday to take advantage of free lunch.  I had Cherry Chipotle Salmon with asparagus  spinach, quinoa and tomatoes....YUMMY...asked for more sauce, big portion salmon...plus the BJ Special pizza....at $16 a little pricey but enough for to and the BEST TASTING.  Plenty of ice tea refills and $4 IPA  pour."
Tabby G.,"Sun City, CA",134,27,80,2.0,12/14/2015,"I've never had this happen to me, but today I ordered a beer and as she wrote down my order I waited for her to ask to see my I.d. which she didn't ask to see. I don't know what she was implying but I didn't like it:("
Un K.,"Perris, CA",0,6,1,2.0,9/21/2016,Super long service on a week day night. I had Brianna and she was really nice but it seems like she forgot about me alot.
Cecilia L.,"Perris, CA",53,3,,1.0,12/3/2016,Worse service! Waitress gave attitude once asked about our food. Our food took longer than anyone else's the waitress was handing out checks before our food was even here. Very rude waitress
Alysha T.,"Murrieta, CA",112,5,2,1.0,9/11/2016,"My first time going to this location last night with my cousin and sister (usually I would go to the Temecula one, but the many issues I had there caused me to try the Menifee location). Our server was great which was not the problem, but my california chicken club sandwich literally made me sick. I don't think the chicken was cooked all the way which caused me to run off to the bathroom in the restaurant because I could no longer keep it down. My cousin also got sick from her food as well (she ordered something completely different from myself). My sister lucked out with her pulled pork sandwich because she seemed to be doing alright. It's safe to say that I will not be eating at BJ's any longer."
Rachel S.,"Murrieta, CA",2,42,31,5.0,9/5/2014,"Been to this location a few times and its pretty good. The service is great. Every time I've gone with either my friends or family, out waiter/waitress had been attentive and very helpful.  The food are always so yummy! And the drinks too."
West T.,"Hemet, CA",48,5,5,5.0,8/5/2016,Chris in bar area was awesome!! Best service hands down ever  and we have been coming here since they opened! Great job Chris will definitely look for your area next time!!
Donna O.,"North Charleroi, PA",1,7,1,1.0,3/31/2017,We waited about 50 minutes to be seated.   1. The waiter did not bring all the waters that were ordered. 2. They brought out the appetizer and the boneless wings were not cooked and raw. My niece bit into one and just about thru up. Had to run to the bathroom to wash out her mouth.  We told the waiter and he got the manager who comped the appetizer.  3.  They brought out the dinners and again many things were wrong. My Brussels sprouts were raw. My nephews Brussels sprouts were from the bottom of the Ian and burnt. Asked for new veggies and they came out cold and raw as well.  4. Not once during  dinner did the manager come back to see if the rest of our dinners were ok.  5. Not once during dinner did the wait staff offer more drinks or refill the water.  6.  Then we ordered desert and waited another 25 minutes  to receive again more wrong orders and still the manager never came by. I finally got up and went to the front and asked to speak to the manager who did not fix the issues.  I can see having one issue sometimes but everything with every dinner in our party. Needless to say we will no longer eat at that restaurant. We were from out of town visiting my nephew and his family who frequented this particular restaurant and they said they will not return again.  I certainly hope their corporate office gets this. I'm leaving my email and would hope they reach out and do something for my nephew who bought us dinner. The dinner was over a $130 and it was not worth $20 for all the issues we experienced tonight.
Elton J.,"San Diego, CA",10,187,1,5.0,5/23/2016,"Absolutely impressed!  We usually don't do breweries because they seem to be obnoxiously loud.  But we're not too into frozen ""gourmet"" burgers at Red Robin so we wound up at BJ's.  Bri was our server and was excellent.   We ordered the avacado roll appetizer, ribs for the spouse and French Dips for the rest.   Ribs were tender and not chewy at all.  The French Dip was pretty standard but the horseradish sause that comes with it was incredibly tasty!  We are planning a return visit next week :)"
Mark H.,"Menifee, CA",0,5,,5.0,3/4/2017,We come to this location about once a month. Food is always pretty good and service fair to good most of the time. Our experience tonight at your location was worth telling someone about. Our food was good as it usually is but what made our visit so good was the exceptional service we received from our server Stephanie Speers. From the moment we first sat down until the time we left our service was outstanding! We will continue to return to your location just because of Stephanie. She is an asset to your Company. Hang on to her or someone else is going to steal her from you. Good Job!
Breanne M.,"San Diego, CA",133,254,316,5.0,9/2/2015,"The food here never disappoints! I could go to BJs once a week if I could! From their brewed beers and root beer, to their appetizers and dinner - this place is top notch. The service is always amazing too! Of course how could anyone forget the pazookie! Yum!"
Laura M.,"Murrieta, CA",36,14,,1.0,7/30/2016,Been about 6-7 weeks after emailing with the restaurant manager who assured me that she would help resolve the issue. Still waiting ......
Bree B.,"Chino Hills, CA",112,35,3,5.0,7/29/2016,Happy hour pizza yes please happy hour drinks yes please who could enjoy it more fun time with huge TVs everywhere Sports everywhere great drinks great food
Amanda P.,"Hemet, CA",0,17,6,2.0,6/29/2015,"Let me say first, that this place has great food. The server was excellent and we recieved our food quickly. I wanted to get that out of the way because the reason for my 2 star review may not affect most people I called ahead because I was taking my mother for her birthday. I told them #1. That she was disabled, unable to speak, and would be in a wheelchair. #2. That it was her birthday. I asked if they had anything special for birthdays and was told that they had a birthday pizookie. I said ""Oh! That would be perfect. Thank you."" and told them when we would be there.  So, when I get there, we have to squeeze through the aisles to get to our table and we have quite a bit of difficulty getting her to a place where she can sit because the aisles aren't wide enough (I specifically asked about this when I called). Then when she has to go to the restroom I realize that they're up stairs. The only ""accessible"" access to the restrooms is up a ramp to the bar area where we again had to squeeze through (apologizing to all of the customers who had to scoot in and squeeze themselves against the tables and bars) to try and get to the restrooms--then again on the way back.  In the end, she didn't get a birthday pizookie. I felt like my entire conversation on the phone was wasting my breath."
Anny G.,"San Diego, CA",1,29,6,2.0,7/27/2016,"Food is decent. The wait is always extremely long (we have given this place at least ten tries) and the service takes forever. The servers are nice but they disappear for veeeeery long periods of time. The french fries are awesome. The calamari is good, but only if or when it's warm. I ordered a cheeseburger and they brought me a hamburger. When I asked for cheese they took so long to bring it that the rest of my family was finishing their food and mine was cold by the time I got the cheese. They brought a quarter of a slice of cheese on a small plate and gave it to me. One star for being a clean place with lots of options. One star for the fries. We won't go back bc of the extremely slow service. Btw, Escondido (by the mall) BJs has even slower service than the Menifee restaurant."
Madiha H.,"Corona, CA",0,12,,4.0,7/27/2016,The manager personally called me to hear my concerns and complaints and sent me a restitution in the form of gift cards. I have since then visited a few different BJ's restaurants and the experience has been much nicer than my initial review.  Thanks BJ's.
Beatriz M.,"Menifee, CA",56,24,8,1.0,2/25/2017,"So once again we decide to have dinner at BJ's even though it was a busy Friday night. Upon arrival we were given a 45 minute wait time, no big deal we want the food. We waited about an hour before being seated. The restaurant was busy and there were a few large parties. We got seated in a booth and a party of about 20 were seated in tables right through the middle. We ordered our food and got our appetizers out about 15 minutes after ordering. We got no plates, no utensils, and no napkins. Our server came by and we asked for those things. We got napkins, a few minutes later plates and 2 place settings. By the time we had received the plates we were almost done with our appetizer platter which were not very warm. about 10 minutes later we finally got our food. I ordered the barbacoa cauliflower pita tacos with bistro seasonal veggies, something new I decided to try. The rest of my family was  given their dinner and I got a plate with what I thought were the seasonal veggies. It was a plate with rice, couscous, spinach and a bunch of mushroom. I don't like mushrooms so I ate some of the couscous, rice and spinach. I then waited for my tacos. The waitress didn't come by too often so when she finally came by, (my family was almost done eating) I asked for my tacos her reply was ""Oh no! I should have been paying better attention. They brought you out the wrong meal. Do you still want the tacos?"" Of course I still wanted the tacos, In the meantime my husband ordered another beer so I wouldn't be sitting with food by myself since him and our 2 girl's were done eating. About 15 minutes passed and I still didn't have any tacos, my husband didn't even want the beer he had ordered and my girls were all done and I was upset and decided I did not want the tacos anymore. I got up and found our server because by this time she had not come back to check on us or to let us know my food would be out soon. Once I found her I let her know that I did not want the tacos anymore. She kept asking ""Are you sure? They will be right out."" I said no and my husband asked for the check so we could go. Now it took a while to get the check because she had to go find someone to take the tacos off my order. When we finally got the check she said she was going to give me the tacos anyway since they were already made and she wasn't going to charge us for them.Made me feel a bit better that she acknowledged the wrong. She gave us a bag with the food and off we went. Before heading home we made a stop and gamestop. Once we got home I thought ""Ok let me see if these pita tacos are any good."" I opened up the bag and the food box and to my surprise It was not even the food I had ordered. I was given the vegetarian pita tacos which I had no interest in. At that point I got a bit upset all over again because had I waited for the food to come and sat and ate it at the restaurant I would have had the wrong order. I was so wanting to try the cauliflower pita and so disappointed in the way the whole evening went. I felt like maybe the server got caught up in serving the 20 person party and our table was very forgotten. I get the fact that she was probably going to make a good tip off of that table but our $63 tab (after taking the pitas off the bill) would have been bigger had we had better service.  Frustrating dinner."
Mignon G.,"Menifee, CA",0,2,,5.0,2/24/2017,Stephanie S was an awesome waiter at the BJs in Menifee. Great customer service and we give her 5 stars!!
Liz J.,"Hemet, CA",59,16,13,2.0,8/3/2017,"Usually I love BJs, yesterday I went with a friend and sister because I was craving the avocado rolls, well we went around lunch time and we got seating quickly so that wasn't a problem and our waiter was so nice, but she took a long time to get our order and even our drinks, once I got the avocado rolls they were perfect and tasted so good!! Waited probably 20mins tell our food came me and my sister shared a ""small"" pizza that thing was RELLY small and the slices were not cut properly and the pizza was very cold we were so unsatisfied! Plus we spent over $14 for it!! , my friend got this fried chicken plate and it came with mash potatoes and corn and seriously tasted so gross looked like u could get it at home town buffet! N I'm sure it would of tasted better there! I felt bad because I picked the place but now I know we won't ever be going to this location again!! Rather go to the one in Temecula we never have problems there !"
Mau L.,"Menifee, CA",31,26,8,5.0,10/22/2015,"We had a good experience overall... it took them a bit to get our drinks and messed my wife's order,  but they fix it in a hurry and gave us a free scoop of ice cream to sweeten the deal. The Jambalaya was good and our server Wendy was on top of things.  Looks like they're trying to turn the bad reviews around."
