Tonya S.,"Riverside, CA",0,6,5,4.0,6/14/2016,Honestly don't understand all the negative reviews! I have been here several times and have always received good service! This bj's is a frequent for us. The food is always on point and our servers have always been awesome! Especially the last time we went on Sunday the 12th of June and our server was so kind! Wish I could remember his name- but I do recommend their turkey burger from the enlightened menu as well as the bbq bison burger!
Anna R.,"Menifee, CA",100,361,1251,5.0,5/7/2014,"Ok I'm giving this place 5 stars because in my book a business should get points for addressing an issue that seems to have been a common theme. This place  has great food and supports their community. First, i have had similar experiences at this restaurant with my family. I have twin daughters who get hungry and I have had the server completely ignore us on several occasions in the past. I vowed never to go back but, hey I'm not a fan of chain restaurants in general but BJs is one of my favorites overall besides Cheesecake Factory. I recently went in with a girlfriend for lunch and our server was amazing she had our drinks filled, was on top of our order and in the end she worked with us on sponsoring our soccer team and fundraiser. Wow! She was awesome.  The food is good. The avocado rolls are one of my all time favorite dishes anywhere. So if you want good tasting food with a huge selection of dishes and not to mention the drink selection is amazing! I failed to mention on one of our previous visits where we had slow service the manager came to our table and comped or meal so at least they are making efforts to rectify the problem. I agree there was a problem but it seems they have taken steps to change and in a great way! Our family and our soccer team will be back. Thank you BJs for your support!"
Michael K.,"Hemet, CA",0,3,,1.0,12/9/2016,So tonight me and my girlfriend decide to go out to eat to bjs and we get there and it is busy but expected for a Friday night do as we wait I observe the host stand and notice there lack of caring for there job so finally we get called up to go to our table and. It takes 10 mins before our serve finally greets us so when she does i notice the fact that she has her cell phone hanging out of her pocket on at that so she takes our Order and we get out drinks I was not happy with my beer at all it didn't taste right so than we get our appetizers and the cheese dip is cold and clumpy and he fried asparagus is dripping grease  off it and. I suck it up hoping they will redeem them self with the entrée portion.but nope the failed at that to my New Orleans jambalaya dish might as well been you want chicken with your Cajun seasoning and dried rice for a side. And it didn't help the fact that our sever had lack of service skills. But at least the supervisor took it off the bill but I don't think I will be back again
Laura K.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",12,3,,4.0,2/15/2015,I've been here many times and am surprised at the comments regarding bad service. I have never experienced anything but great service and a pleasant hostess.  We never have to wait for a table.  Food is always good and love the cider beer mix they have. Called Jeremiah red with their on tap cider. Awesome!
Amy H.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",80,9,,1.0,12/8/2016,"My daughter absolutely loves BJS restaurant, so for her birthday we went here to eat. We had to wait because we had a party of eight which is expected! We were sat down and handed menus! To start it all off the waitress did not come for at least 10 min to get our drink order in l. so sitting for 25 min with nothing to drink is a little absurd! We get our drinks and put in for appetizers and that came out decent! Food order is now in! Soups and salads took another ridiculous amount of time to come out! Soup was cold and had hard pieces of something in it! At this time a few of us only ordered soup and salad so everyone else is waiting for their food! I felt bad for the waitress she was trying but kept telling us it's the pizza well after about 40 min they finally bring out the rest of the dinners and to our surprise( not really)the food was cold! I would go to a different location! It is not fun sitting at a table with hungry kids! Once we expressed our concern about the cold food it was removed off the bill! The manager came over to talk to us but at this time it's just a dull dinner now! Brought out Birthday Pazooki no singing nothing! Sad place for a birthday!!!!"
Daniel D.,"Kyle, TX",0,10,,4.0,11/3/2016,It's a BJ's. Some people say this particular restaurant is terrible. But i've been there nearly a dozen times in a few years and never really had an issue. It's what you could expect. It's consistently ok.
Chelsea M.,"Menifee, CA",2,6,1,3.0,5/5/2016,"I usually love coming to BJ's! Their Sunday brunch is amazing and the pizzas here are delicious...BUT this time was unfortunately a bit of a disappointment. I tried the ahi poke which in general is one of my favorite things but here it was not what I expected it to be. It was fishy and definitely not enough to share with three people. No sauce and quite bland. It was on a bed of dried, pale lettuce. We also got the calamari which included the actual tentacles which were pretty much not edible and tasted of the oil that they were fried in. Not pleased...especially for the price that you pay."
Stephanie R.,"Sun City, CA",66,13,,5.0,6/8/2016,"Bj's is always a good choice as for a Restaraunt. Great mojitos, & Thier pazookies are the GREATEST!"
Julie N.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,,1.0,9/6/2016,"So I'm enjoying a nice lunch when out of nowhere comes our server, Adriana or ""Ahdi"" (phonetic spelling), to ask if she can bring us some boxes. Hello, if there's food on my fork and I'm in the process of lifting said fork to my mouth, this might be a clue that your question is a bit premature. So rude, but typical of your average chain restaurant whose only concern is to turn tables as quickly as possible. Asking if I ""would like a box"" when I'm obviously still eating sends the message that ""You're done. It's time to leave so we can seat other paying customers."""
Chad C.,"Lompoc, CA",0,3,,2.0,4/4/2015,"Two stars is as far as I go with this place. I love the decor and atmosphere but the food n serve sucks. Ordered the cherry Chipotle salmon and it had a faint taste of dust. Couldn't taste the cherry or spice at all. Girlfriend had the feticcunie alfredo and the sauce was bland. Service was confused as to drink orders and I'm still waiting on a water from yesterday. Lol  Went here because people were saying it was good food and to ignore yelp reviews. I did and wish I hadn't. If you want a beer or a drink, good place. But the food n service sucks."
Brenda B.,"Menifee, CA",42,53,53,1.0,11/22/2013,"We got our food and didn't have utensils for a good ten minutes until someone brought us some. Then during our meal, my water went dry. It didn't get refilled until AFTER I was done eating my entree. My thirst was so real. It was a struggle to wait for the ice to melt. Then I got my mini pizookie and I was happy for a good minute while I devoured it. Food was good. Service sucked. If I wasn't so thirsty like I been stuck in the Sahara Desert, they would have gotten two stars."
Vickie C.,"Sun City, CA",7,12,,1.0,11/27/2016,"We've had too many bad meals and lousy service. Be aware to make sure your meat is cooked properly as we've had raw pork chops, chicken etc....no thanks, we won't be back!"
Nick B.,"Quail Valley, CA",0,12,3,3.0,10/13/2015,"Food is hit and miss.  Sometimes they skimp out on the pizza sauce. Seems they like to seat our family in the less desirable seats, we must not look like good tippers?"
Rusty S.,"Perris, CA",15,7,1,5.0,12/1/2014,"If you've never had a pizookie in your life you aren't livin' I honestly came in here just to have a pizookie. I mean, wouldn't you? Look at this glorious chocolate chip encrusted piece of love cookie. I would probably trade my girlfriend for a few year supply of these bad boys. If you're lactose intolerant... it's still totally worth the consequences. Just do it and it'll be the best ""I love and hate myself at the same time"" moment you've ever experienced."
Terry M.,"Murrieta, CA",0,9,4,5.0,4/18/2016,"Thank you BJ'S Menifee... You always provide great service and continuity on your food... If I've ever have a problem its fixed immediately... Great service, great beer, great value on good food!!!!"
Colin A.,"Santa Cruz, CA",91,28,5,5.0,5/7/2015,"This review is solely based upon the bar service of Brittany E. Brilliant service; your recommendations and selling was great. Overall, it was like you owned the bar but hell in a corporate type of environment of chain restaurants? Don't expect it yet but so welcomed.  Afternoon lunch and drinks with brother we loved your humor and abilities. Thank you."
James h.,"Sun City, CA",16,20,,5.0,3/28/2016,I made a dinner date with my family to meet at this BJ's. Right before we were to meet I went on yelp to look at reviews. I was almost ready to call them back and change but decided to try it. Wow am I glad we went. Jessica was out waitress and she was great. She kept coming to check on us to make sure everything was okay filling our drinks etc.  The assistant manager came and introduced himself to check if everything was okay. We were so happy with the food and the service. So glad we went. Thanks for a great night.
C W.,"Sun City, CA",0,80,23,4.0,3/5/2015,"We eat here regularly & believe it to be one of the better restaurants in town.  This time we did the call ahead seating (Highly recommended on Thurs-Sat) There was a huge line outside but when we checked in with the hostess she said we were 10th out of 30 on the list (was only a 12 minute wait for us).  The rib-eye steak & salmon were perfectly cooked, (all seafood here is fresh not frozen). The Pizookie is a must for desert. My favorite is the white chocolate macadamia nut with 2 scoops of rich & creamy vanilla bean ice-cream on top. We were celebrating my daughter's B-day so it was free.   If your going to eat here on & off recommend you join the rewards club (might as well get the perks) Points add up fast an are redeemable for free food or $$$ off meals .   My only negative is the place is a bit loud, which is no prob for beer pizza and a few friends or a family dinner, but would not be good if your looking for a quiet intimate meal. There are lots of screens to watch your fav sport event on & they have a full bar with much to choose from.  You can also order wine by the glass or bottle & they will happily cork what you don't finish.  They have many different draft beers to choose form as well as some nice local bottled stuff.  In all a great place to enjoy a good meal"
Kaleigh G.,"Menifee, CA",0,13,2,2.0,5/13/2016,"Food is average and ok. However, I would not recommend ordering the baked ziti, it's a HUGE GREASE BALL! Also the food is luke warm"
Rick W.,"Sun City, CA",32,21,3,5.0,4/6/2016,"Confused by the negative reviews. Our service and food today were excellent.   Courtney was our server and prompt, efficient and pleasant. Our food was served in a proper time frame and as expected.  We shall return"
