Noel T.,"Nuevo, CA",0,14,2,1.0,6/29/2015,"Have gone there a total of 6 times: 1st and 2nd time, 5 star all the way, these visits were within 2 months of opening. 3rd Time- What happened? We order the SAME items from the first 2 times, appetizer Santa Fe Rolls- came 2 minutes before entree and were cold in middle blazing hot in ends,,,,wife's fettuccini Alfredo- COLD, after bringing it to attention of waitress who rolled eyes it was taken back never to be seen again BUT was on bill, my Calzone had TWO meatballs cut in half,,, figured since it was busy give it another chance. 4th Time- forgot appetizers, Wife's angel hair pasta could be held horizontally it was that hard and no taste, what was supposed to be my jambalaya over spiced, when asked for Ceasar Salad instead of angel hair, was given a side salad, never got refills waitress was nice when time for check and tip. 5th and last time- you could count the pepperoni pieces on large pizza, three inches of dough before cheese started, NO SAUCE!  I did notice no one has defended their crummy service, will go to Red Robin and yellow basket instead of this pretty dump!"
Odie O.,"San Diego, CA",2,1003,63,2.0,3/17/2014,"Needs major improvement. BJs in las vegas and la mesa have good food but the food is bad and service is dead slow here. Luckily I read the reviews before I came so I brought a coupon, without it I would have felt even more ripped off then I already was. It was empty but we waited forever for our food, the waitress noticed me and ran back to check on the food, the avacado egg rolls appetizer arrived the same time as the fettucini alfredo, both had been under the hotlamp so long the carrot and parsley garnish had shriveled up and died. The rolls were lukewarm, kinda soggy whilst the pasta was dried all around the edges. The pasta was not yet cooked or el dente, in fact parts still raw and clumped together hard to chew. It's hard to screw up pasta. No parmesean on top and had to call waitress to ask for parmesean as it was a lacking flavor. Although our server was super nice and sweet we were disappointed that she forgot about us, I shouldn't have tipped her much. Can't say we will ever come back, unfortunate as I love the atmosphere and there is nowhere to go to like it around there."
Helen L.,"Murrieta, CA",47,1,2,1.0,1/31/2015,"Bad service!!! The hostess said we would be seated in 15 mins and we ended waiting 1hr! Then she shows us to our table and it wasn't even clean, so waited again!!! Sad to say we like BJ's but will not be returning to this location again!!"
Sam B.,"Murrieta, CA",15,143,2,4.0,3/25/2015,"So I really give this place 3.5 starts.  I have never been a big fan of BJ's.  I always thought their beer was horrible and their food was the same mass produced microwave junk you get at any chain restaurant.  After my last visit, I can say they have improved alot. My wife wanted to go here.  I ended up getting the ribs and they fell off the bone.  They were delicious.  I also had their house red beer and it was good too.  The service was great.  I'd go back."
Arthur M.,"Menifee, CA",99,53,189,5.0,2/18/2015,Great food.  Great service and food kid's options.  My son loves it. He gave it a 9.5 out of 10.The cheese taste weird at the beginning.
Addii E.,"Sun City, CA",4,4,9,5.0,8/22/2015,"Best service I have ever had here, ask for Rosa! Has much patience, and very sweet. Speaks spanish as well."
Keely K.,"San Jacinto, CA",47,14,52,1.0,11/5/2014,"Readily bad service. I saw my waiter one time and that was to fill my drink. He didn't even take my order! The last that day me too my order, another lady brought me my drink and another lady brought me my food! Took over 30 min to get my soup. Just awful"
Ani M.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",95,30,21,2.0,12/22/2015,Our waitress was definitely absent the whole night... she was  Nice...but not around .   didn't refill husband's coke the whole night or even ask if he wanted one. The Barbacoa spiced chicken was awful and was like rubber. Never coming back.gross out right now
Annamarie P.,"Riverside, CA",170,47,21,3.0,1/1/2016,"Food were fantastic!!! But still why heck they put us by the door exit??? It was so cold! Every time people exit, we had to deal with coldest breeze. I had broken foot! I had guts to put the chairs to block the frigging exit door!!!!!!!!  We wished it was for fire alarm only. Not for people to exit !  Waitress realized what I did. She had to apologize us. Not her fault. I am blaming the hostess and designers for that stupid exit door near to our seats and other seats too. Duh?!"
Aamie R.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",4,44,28,5.0,3/21/2016,Honestly  good pizza drinks they have alot on menu to make everyone happy. Plus order a pizzoki at the end yum life is good!
Deborah G.,"Menifee, CA",0,17,,5.0,10/20/2016,What a fabulous time we had at lunch the other day because of Teresa Marie...our server! She was knowledgeable and fun and made the entire experience  so much fun! great food conversation and service! What more could you ask for???We even waited 15 minutes to speak to the manager Chris( who was handling a major crisis in the kitchen) To express our gratitude for Teresa and the entire experience .Thank you both Debbie Voltura
Angelina R.,"San Francisco, CA",39,4,4,3.0,4/7/2015,"I think this place is yummy but nothing about this restaurant is special. Practically every store is the same (which is expected from chains).   I wish the servers had a little more pizzaz... I've never had a bad server at any BJ's, but I've never had an awesome server either.   Oh well! I still plan on eating at this place every once in awhile!"
Ivan V.,"Perris, CA",0,33,,2.0,9/12/2016,"Ordered the Avocado Egg Rolls, can't go wrong with these, a pizza which was fine, some Mediterranean Chicken Pita Taco's, first round was screwed up (the server caught it) so it had to go back, the taco's were alright but that side of ""gruel"" or whatever (Bistro Grains) it was, it looked like leftovers.  Place has an odd layout, drunkards to one side, exposed dining in the middle, and dining / party space to the opposite side.  Place was a graveyard, I can't see how they stay in business.  They do have some decent menu items but this is one of those call it in, pick it up places.  Clean utensils would be nice."
Crusader ..,"Menifee, CA",21,73,77,3.0,2/9/2015,"I admit my elderly mom and I are very particular when eating out, and this was the first ever visit we made at this establishment the other day (during lunchtime). PROS: 1) We managed to get a nearly private booth away from the hustle and bustle of the other rather noisy restaurant; 2) It seemed like we literally had two servers and they constantly checked on us, were prompt with our requests, and both were very attentive to our needs; 3) The veggie pizza on the super thick crust was very unique and I enjoyed it very much;   4) My mom had the unlimited soup and salad, which is a great value, and she was able to take home the portions she couldn't finish; 5) The double chocolate chip ice cream with whipped cream really hit the spot. Didn't think the other desserts (some as high as 1800 calories) would have been a good idea. CONS: 1) My silverware was covered with very white spots and I asked and received a replacement set promptly. Also, there were no condiments whatsoever on our table; 2) I requested Large Print menus for both my mother and I, but they only claimed to have ONE (which looks like they print on an in-house printer), so we had to share that one menu, which sucks; 3) It wasn't super crowded, but the music (depending on the song) was louder than my elderly mom and I would have liked;  3) When I asked for ""extra napkins"" (they provide cloth napkins with the silverware), the server brings some Mickey Mouse cocktail napkins, which was a crock. I cannot imagine they do not have regular-sized paper napkins for using with messier menu items; 4) Despite the decent service, the servers did not do a good job explaining to newbies about the menu, explaining the ""unlimited soup/salad"" more clearly, explaining drink choices clearly (which really confused my mom). We were aggravated with the servers not communicating better with us, but they weren't horrific servers by any means. If I return, I will definitely try the patio in hopes of not having loud music to listen to!"
Sara H.,"The Pocket-Greenhaven, Sacramento, CA",1,12,3,5.0,3/7/2016,Can never go wrong with this place the perfect date spot! The new Padini they have are so good like a high class hot pocket
Jeremy V.,"Perris, CA",0,94,,4.0,9/5/2016,"It can get crowded, but I love me some BJ's.  Does not matter if I get a pizza, salad, or something else it is always delicious.  And how can you beat pizookie. And the prices are more than reasonable."
K R.,"Eugene, OR",0,8,,1.0,10/8/2016,"Service was horrible this evening.  No water, No silverware and no napkins.  Food for a party of six took over an hour and we were all served five minutes apart.  My six year old was served last....spaghetti. Manager had a ton of excuses and NO apology!  She had no problem sending a bill for $102 for a terrible experience.  No Thank you.  I will not be going back!   Good luck folks."
Isabella R.,"Romoland, CA",143,7,5,5.0,4/2/2016,"My fiancé and I went in for his first time cause we both had pizza in mind. Our server was nice attentive and would bring us drinks before we emptied the glass. (Which is amazing cause my fiancé finishes his drinks in one sip). The only thing I can tell people is to make sure you check the temperature of your food, we ordered a spinach dip and it was burning hot,literally. My fiancé blow on the spinach dip for a bit and took a bite and burned his mouth. But other then that thank you to the staff for making it a good experience other from the host, the server and I think it was the manager."
Jessika S.,"Sun City, CA",94,48,30,5.0,10/9/2015,Been here several times and the food is usually okay and service is horrible! I am beyond glad we came tonight our service was 10 star and food at well! Nick was out server and was so friendly and polite !
Greg C.,"San Jacinto, CA",0,12,,4.0,4/1/2016,"Went here for my wife's birthday and they have us such a hard time because we had a party of 8. They made it seem like such an inconvenience. However, our waitress was really nice and the food was great so I'll give em an extra star for that."
