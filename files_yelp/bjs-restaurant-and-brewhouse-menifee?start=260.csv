John H.,"Perris, CA",6,27,36,4.0,3/30/2016,"Awesome pizza. Very good food all around but a little more pricey. Very friendly, great environment, and good service. They tend to look at you to see if you need anything instead of coming up and interrupting your meal to ask if you need anything, I like that."
Nestor V.,"Escondido, CA",0,1,,1.0,8/25/2016,Could I get food poisoning for 2 please? Yep.. I don't write negative reviews but this time is an exception. Something about their beef is off. We won't be back.
Chelsea P.,"Murrieta, CA",0,6,,5.0,3/27/2016,"I'm giving 5 stars to our Server Daniel, & the Floor Manager Simon!!! Daniel took very good care of us & made us laugh, which who doesn't love that! Simon is probably one of the best restaurant managers i've come in contact with- acknowledged & was attentive with all guests, & honestly I think with him around this place will definitely continue to grow for the better. I have always preferred this BJs location over the Temecula location, & with Daniel & Simon I will always enjoy going in. Thanks guys for making our dinner special!!"
Tim G.,"Murrieta, CA",2,24,2,4.0,1/28/2016,"What a pleasant surprise. I was expecting a ""decent"" overpriced pizza. What we got was some good food!  They even did a good job with my wife's ""pain in the ass"" muddled cucumber and gin cocktail!  Wife and I both had the baked ziti which was really good!  But, what really killed me was the siracha honey Brussels sprouts. I don't like sprouts. But, these were delicious!!!  The wait staff seemed a little overwhelmed, but everyone we came into contact with was pleasant and polite. We will go back. For a ""chain"" restaurant this was a great experience."
Louie A.,"Menifee, CA",134,147,1388,4.0,3/24/2013,"We been to this location several times now and food is always good.   Other than their popular pizzas and beer there are other food items on their menu that are pretty darn good.  The first would be the Clam Chowder in the bread bowl. The sour dough bread itself is toasted and every bite is savory.  I have had this several times in the past and would not get tired of ordering it.  It's just a great meal for a cold night out.   Another one of my favorites is the Gumbo Stew.  A little spicy but it is flavorful, the spice level is just a notch below medium and tolerable for anyone that does not in favor of spicy foods.  Pizzas are definitely their signature dishes from pan to thin crust you can't go wrong ordering them here.  When new pizzas hit the menu we almost always order them.  As far as the staff, most are super friendly and very attentive but you can't fault them if they are  busy which most BJ's are on any given night.  So be patient and it all works out in your favor.  There's this one time they gave me the wrong drink and just comped it for making an error. I give them my appreciations on the receipt when we see great customer service."
Tamara D.,"Wailuku, HI",226,17,5,5.0,1/7/2016,So glad we have this place just down the street. Food is excellent! Service is very good and the bar tenders know how to shake up an excellent martini!
Melisa B.,"San Diego, CA",2,12,15,5.0,10/25/2014,We came here for my son's bday. Dinner was perfect. Kid meals came with handcrafted rootbeer with no caffeine. I had the salmon dinner. My husband the fish and chips. Both meals the fish was fresh and delicious. I had the BJs nutty brown ale beer and is was great! Dessert was a cookie with Icecream on the house for my son. I rate the experience a 5!!!
Romy A.,"Menifee, CA",17,10,7,1.0,6/4/2016,I was there today around 3:30 p.m. The hostess ignored me the whole time I was standing in front of her.. She turn her back to me a couple of time till finally she ask me if I being help.. Nobody was around me it was just me trying to be patient.. Not addressing customers when they are in front of you and looking over them will help them go somewhere else..
Jen S.,"Laguna Hills, CA",606,511,3331,5.0,2/10/2013,"First time here and I met a friend for a quick lunch. We must have arrived just before the lunch crowd because it was pretty much open seating. Hosts were warm and welcoming. Gave their recommendations, too. Our server was equally nice and attentive. I took the recommended Mahi Mahi featured special (only 575 calories) and I was not disappointed. It was quite delicious! As I'm leaving I see just how packed the restaurant got. Packed, lively, and crowd for all ages. We even had a baby napping while the moms dined comfortably. Definitely will return to check out their beer selections."
TI R.,"Perris, CA",10,37,16,1.0,7/8/2016,"We were disappointed with the cleanliness. The table was not very clean when were seated. The waitress have us dirty plates twice, and was rude when we asked for new ones. Also, pizza was not sliced all the way through. More rude attitude about the problems."
Brandi H.,"Temecula, CA",0,27,3,5.0,3/16/2016,"My husband and I go here allot, we love the food and so far we haven't found anything we didn't like. Always great service and great food!"
Sergio B.,"Murrieta, CA",129,51,27,3.0,11/21/2015,I gotta say I've come to not expect great service from any BJ's they're always hit or miss.
Patrick S.,"Los Alamitos, CA",89,365,235,4.0,10/14/2013,"I've been to this one twice, but this is the first time I tried the beer! I ordered a Double Bison Burger to go and as I waited I tried the Oktoberfest Beer which was surprised me and was similar in flavour to Sam Adams Boston Lager but better! Staff was friendly and when I got home the Double Bison Burger was cooked correctly and tasted good. Also they bottle beer too, so I got some more for home! Not a bad lunch place or watering hole. Oh and go during happy hour I got the beer for $3.50!"
Jolie G.,"Whittier, CA",0,21,9,1.0,2/5/2016,An hour and a half wait We were told we were next next next except we weren't- try another Bjs The staff is young and obviously inexperienced...and unapologetic
Amber K.,"Temecula, CA",90,131,38,4.0,8/30/2014,Love this location. My bf and I live close by and always choose to eat here about 1-2x a week. We've never once had bad service. The food is always great too :)
Whitney B.,"Menifee, CA",13,13,2,2.0,7/2/2015,Well to start the service needs some help! I've waited a while to write this review. In hopes it would change but it hasn't. I would say the food is great everything I've ordered that's come out correctly is delicious but like I said if it comes out right. We waited 20 minutes for my husband's food when I received mine. He ordered soup in a bread bowl....really. Everytime we come here unless we are sitting in the bar we get horrible service.EVERY TIME its annoying the waiters and waitress seem not to really care or maybe they are to overwhelmed but I think the hostesses are more attentive
Raquel B.,"Menifee, CA",6,29,31,4.0,9/4/2014,Great place to hang out with friends as they have a big table in the back for parties. I've been there with moms and their kids and they were perfectly fine. You must try the pizza cookie with ice cream on top it's amazing. The potato skins are deep-fried and totally awesome. It's not too noisy but they do have sports on large screens. Would recommend.
Kim C.,"Murrieta, CA",71,80,45,2.0,7/19/2015,"Unfortunately, this review is based mostly on our experience and very little on the food.  Last night we went to this BJ's with a couple friends. I called ahead with a party of 6 and a high chair. We were told on the phone there was no wait so we left right away and headed over to the restaurant. We got there and there was a 15 minute wait. Not a big deal really. The hostess was very friendly and kept us updated on the status of our table. Once the table was ready, they walked us back to our table. As we walked further and further back in the restaurant it got hotter and muggier. It was raining outside and humid, but still was no excuse for just how hot the restaurant was in the area we were seated. When our waitress came over, we mentioned that it was hot. She said customers had been complaining all day and she had told her manager. But, she apologized because she was warm too.  We were sat in a large booth so to add to the hot environment, we were now sitting elbow to elbow. My son had to use the bathroom, so as I walked him to the front I asked the hostess if the manager was available. She was standing right there by the takeout area so I approached her. She was talking to someone so I waited and when she finished talking she looked at me and began to walk away. I said excuse me and got her attention. I told her how warm it was in the back and she rolled her eyes and said the temperature was reading between 70 and 72 so there wasn't much she could do. She said it was hot outside (it was not, it was between 7 and 8 o clock and raining) so the inside temp would be warmer. I explained what the waitress had said and how they were hot too and she said she would lower the air but gave me a nice side of attitude. By the time my son and I got back to our table it was much cooler. Later in our meal, my son had to go to the bathroom again ((typical 3 year old)) and I walked right by the manager. She looked and me and walked away. She didn't ask if it was any better, she never came by our table, nothing!! She was the rudest manager I have ever dealt with.  Overall our food was good. That's the only reason I gave 2 stars. We had to ask for drink refills and it was really hard to catch our waitress when we need anything."
Jamey M.,"Riverside, CA",2,22,,4.0,12/20/2015,"My wife and I usually dine at the bar area 3-4 times a week for happy hour. Excellent service! Drinks are always on point, and the appetizers are delicious. Never too crowded, and service is generally extremely efficient. Our favorite bartenders/servers are Chris and Blair, they don't miss a beat and are very personable... No 'fake-smile BS.'"
Jacqueline B.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",43,12,11,4.0,1/30/2016,"Saturday nights are pretty busy but that doesn't stop me from going. Great food, a little pricey. Usually really great service with the occasional grump but still a 4 star overall review!"
