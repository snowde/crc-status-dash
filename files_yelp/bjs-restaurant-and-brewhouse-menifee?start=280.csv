Shelley P.,"Sun City, CA",0,1,,2.0,9/3/2016,Went here shortly after it opened the drinks are good but the service is horrible they took so long to take our order and on top of that they mixed up our order like twice. Nope wouldnt recommend this bjs.
Marina H.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,32,8,1.0,11/14/2015,"Not sure what's happened at this location. We love bjs and used to be regulars up until this last time. Food was not fresh at all and had a really bad smell. I became violently sick for 24 hours after eating the California burger. Will never come back, the health inspector should really check this place out."
Shawn L.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",29,3,,1.0,7/18/2015,Worst take out experience ever!  Ordered to go pizza and a six pack of beer. Order was not ready for an hour and they were not busy. The waitress handed me the beer when I checked out but I asked if she could keep the beer til the pizza gets ready. When I get the pizza an hour later the beer had been sitting out the whole time. Who the hell wants to drink warm beer in the Summer waitress was Christina. Horrible service!  I will be skipping this location.
Alexis M.,"San Jacinto, CA",5,12,17,5.0,12/21/2015,"Love this place. We live down the street & come here once a week, great food and great service."
Kim M.,"Menifee, CA",9,19,,1.0,5/25/2015,"Never going back.  Our one and only experience at this BJ's was horrible. We like to dine in the early evening before rush hour so when we walked in, the place was not busy at all. Perfect! However our hostess and a couple other employee's were standing at the hostess station chatting away, gave us a glance, kept chatting and then acted surprised we were standing there.  To make a miserable experience story shorter, our waiter was the worst! This young man acted like we were more of a bother, we never got our salads, our garlic bread AND we didn't get the usual refills of iced tea.  Our waiter acted like he was almost avoiding us and I noticed other patrons being treated the same way.  The price we paid for the service we got was pathetic."
David B.,"Menifee, CA",0,2,,5.0,8/23/2016,"Awesome place with a great setting, definitely a must for a casual night out.  The food is great with a variety of selections.  I'm a fan of the beer, totally awesome."
Brett J.,"Menifee, CA",10,20,1,2.0,1/14/2016,"Cold, bland food and waiting forever to be seated. Stick with the pizza and beer here, everything you can keep. As is typical with most Menifee restaurants in this area, you're going to be waiting awhile if you plan on a weekend evening stop."
Jose G.,"Perris, CA",0,21,,4.0,9/11/2016,Food is good for a chain restaurant but service can be better. Servers are not personable and quickly disappear
Myca A.,"Riverside, CA",3,13,1,5.0,5/19/2014,"Our waitress, Dominique, was very nice. I ordered a drink I didn't like and they ended up not charging me for it, how kind! My family and I eat here all the time, and they are consistently great. Service is always nice and enthusiastic, food is great. Price is expensive, but that's expected. I'm kind of surprised at all the bad reviews. I've never had a bad experience, but maybe it's because I go when they're not terribly busy? P.S. Pizookies are the BEST!"
Brooke G.,"Phoenix, AZ",973,246,242,5.0,10/4/2012,"Have been here twice since the grand opening. The experience both times was excellent. On both occasions I got the same thing...super boring but those thai shrimp lettuce wraps are to die for...minus the red onions :) I also really like the small plate appetizer of the potsticker with thai sauce too.  Boyfriend got the jambalaya stuff with shrimp, chicken and sausage, it was awesome. The other time I went with one of my girlfriends, her food great and our server was awesome. I am in love with the blonde ale and really enjoy the atmosphere. So so so so happy there is finally a place like this near our home!!"
Cin P.,"Perris, CA",0,1,,1.0,2/10/2016,"Okay we walked in no one was in the front we were completely ignored by the servers and the one that does take out. They would just look at us and walk by especially the one that does take out.  We finally get sat, our server took 10 minutes to get to us she got our drinks down then it took about 20 minutes for our drinks to get to us. The server had like 10 tables and she was by herself with no one to help so I don't blame her. She was really nice, she tried her best to be around as possible. Another thing the silverware was pretty dirty. They had a lot of water spots and you can see the food on them.  We never saw any manager around during the time there. Pretty disappointed."
Janatte S.,"Menifee, CA",36,5,1,5.0,2/9/2016,Love the food. For the best waiter food came I. Time and hot just the way I like it. Me the hubby kids went and were very satisfied. We like coming her maybe twice maybe three times a month. Mostly Friday's before our weekend starts. Highly recommend
Christen W.,"Menifee, CA",2,6,,4.0,6/21/2015,You gotta try the jalapeño burger with seasoned fries. Delicious. Staff was friendly and I had a great first time experience.
Morgan J.,"Redlands, CA",31,11,2,2.0,11/11/2015,"3rd and last time our family will be spending our money at this location. The service was absolutely horrific tonight. Once seated, we waited over an hour for the arrival of our entrees: which came out one by one with 10 minutes in between. By the time my stepdad received his meal, my mother and daughter were done with their food. Additionally, my veggy pizza came out cold to the touch and undercooked (gooey). I sent it back and had it removed from our bill. The manager apologized insincerely and quickly and offered us a pazooki, but then we waited another 20 min for our desert (that which we got up and left before its arrival). This place needs some new management and really needs to work on food service. This is a repeat experience of our last visit here also. We wont be back, what a shame"
TJ G.,"Menifee, CA",0,4,1,2.0,12/15/2015,Don't ever try and get a keg from here!!! Was blown off on three phone calls and couldn't even get pricing for them. Pretty bummed!!! Usually this bj's is really good with customer service but definitely dropped the ball on this one!!
Nora R.,"West Covina, CA",3,16,9,1.0,6/1/2015,"Terrible service.  Went out with my friends and our server got our ENTIRE order wrong. When we asked for our CORRECT order, our server, Ryan took forever to correct it. While I love BJ'S,  I don't think we'll ever come to this location again. We're going to have to make the drive to the Temecula location."
Mackenzie C.,"Murrieta, CA",64,11,,3.0,2/25/2016,I love the appetizer combo and the house blonde beer is good. Strawberry margarita is delicious.. Wish there was more tequila though
Beth W.,"Whittier, CA",114,16,2,5.0,12/8/2015,I love Bjs and this location has the nicest employees. Totally worth the wait cuz this place gets packed. Besides I simply love the watermelon feta salad and the Jeremiah Red is my favorite beer that they offer.
Jane M.,"Menifee, CA",26,40,,1.0,8/18/2015,Horrible service !!! Bad food had to have it sent back wont eat here again!! Servers are slow and dont come back to refill drinks and less  you flagged them down!! Food comes to your  your table either overcooked or absolutely cold. I would definitely rate this with no stars but it won't let me you have to pick at least one star I give this restaurant the most horrible  rating  they have poor customer service poor management skills and horrible cooks I will never go here again !!
Angie S.,"Temecula, CA",19,78,8,1.0,9/8/2015,"Coming here is usually my go to place to get a couple of drinks with my friends. The food usually tastes good here but today just wasn't as great. I ordered a Caesar salad for lunch with grilled chicken. The exterior was burnt. Yes, I could cut it off but still. Please do not serve your food burnt. If it gets burnt, then throw it out or at least remove the edges. It looked very unappetizing."
