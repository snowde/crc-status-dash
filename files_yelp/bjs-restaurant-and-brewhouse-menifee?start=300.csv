Micah L.,"Henderson, NV",44,232,1926,2.0,8/19/2014,"Went here because it was closer to my house than the Temecula location. The place was packed so i opted to eat outside, big mistake. The atmosphere outside was nice but I was the only person out there so my service was extremely slow. The food tasted good and I ordered a beer to come with my food so i could enjoy both at the same time. They gave me my beer ahead of time. My waitress didn't know much about the menu and seemed to be in a bad mood. It took way too long to finally get my pizza and for them to refill my soda. I much rather go to the Temecula one."
Michelle O.,"Murrieta, CA",28,45,17,5.0,8/27/2014,"I've always had yummy food and great service here.  I was very surprised to see such poor reviews.  We've been in to eat, and used their curbside takeout.  The quality of food is great both ways.  The Mediterranean Pizza is my absolute favorite.  And the house made black cherry soda is perfect when you do half coke, half black cherry- so good."
Keith W.,"Carlsbad, CA",26,27,17,5.0,4/12/2014,"I love this place. As far as chain restaurants go, this has to be among the best. Great draft microbrews, extensive menu to satisfy even the pickiest of eaters, high quality and friendly service.  You have to try the drunken root beer. Amazing. I've had lots of things on the menu and I haven't been disappointed as of yet.  My suspicion for the lower rating is that the trash in this town cannot afford anything more expensive than a Denny's.  Please support BJ's!!"
Janice E.,"Menifee, CA",78,60,23,1.0,3/11/2014,"I have given this place plenty of chances, I will NEVER go back. Stay away. The service is terrible!! You wait forever for someone to take your drink orders. It took 15 minutes for our server to ask my husband and I what we wanted to drink. We had our son with us, who they took forever to bring a highchair (we asked 3 times) Every time we go they seem disorganized and untrained. The servers need to be re trained or fired all together . I've worked In the food industry and this doesn't cut it. I will never go back to this establishment, I always leave frustrated that I tried to give this place another undeserving chance. Do yourself a favor and go to a different place in town.  You'll get better, faster and more friendly service ANYWHERE ELSE IN MENIFEE.  Stay as far away as possible!! Poor service! Slow service (even with NO wait )"
Justin H.,"Irvine, CA",22,16,10,5.0,8/22/2015,Not sure what there isn't to like about this place. Foods good service is excellent and it really seems like everyone is running around to speed things up. Ya I waited skittle fir a refill but they didn't forget about me. I needed extra lemon for my water and sure enough they were brought right over. Most of the time when I ask for water with lemon I just get water. Thx for the great meal and good time out tonight.
Cindy C.,"Sacramento, CA",0,4,,1.0,12/29/2015,"Absolutely terrible!!! Appetizers were cold, food was cold.  My burger was cold, and the lettuce was soggy and wilted like it had sat for a long time before being brought out.  It also came out with the wrong side and when I told the girl that, her response was ""I just bring the food out."" We ordered 3 burgers and all came out without any sauce at all. Drinks sat empty on the table for much of the meal.  I had to ask three times for the ranch that i ordered with my meal."
Jack M.,"Wildomar, CA",87,8,1,1.0,12/25/2015,"It's not ok to mop the tables and wipe the floors! So I have been trying to decide if I should write this review or not. We got there. And the place was busy so I expected to wait. No problem. When we got our table after a very short wait I was happy till I saw the table very small and I am not a small guy. We asked for water twice before getting any. We ordered our appetizer and a salad. The waiter asked if we wanted the salad at the same time or after we said after. Guess the word did not get back to the kitchen because another waitress brought the salad out first then he brought the appetizer. When he saw the salad he asked if it was ok. Because we did not want a soggy salad we did not send it back. So now the table is very full with all the dishes coming out of order. I spilled my drink when reaching for a napkin. A waiter on the table next to us acted like she did not see. I got up and began wiping the table with paper napkins another waitress walked by looked and walked away without a word. I called her back and asked for help and she said she would go find our waiter. He did return but had to go back to the wait station to get some towels. My guess is the female waitress did not inform him of the issue. Are they a team or working against each other?  When he returned he began wiping down the small bench seat, the floor and next he began to wipe the table with the same rag. I stopped him and he told me it was ok because he flipped the rag over for the table. ??? Is this how they are trained??? I then told him we are moving to another table and he replied by giving us permission to move. Really I did not need his permission we were moving. He did not bother to apologize for his actions. Guess it is normal to mop tables and wipe the floor. After all this no offer to comp anything. In fact had to ask for another ice tea. The food was good and price was fair so I did not mind paying for it. We used a gift card to pay for most of it and the waiter made the comment that is was good we were able to use a gift card and joked about ""at least you got a bigger table."" I did decide to write this review because the more I pondered the more I realized it seamed to be a management issue not just one server."
H N.,"Sun City, CA",3,37,3,1.0,8/30/2015,"First thing , I enjoy this B.J.'s & eat here regularly . Unfortunately I've had 2 bad experiences here this summer ,  I ate here last night with Family , our server was Fantastic , but the kitchen staff / bartender failed , which tells me supervision & management isn't doing their Job ! We waited to long for drinks , our food , our desert & our check ! We observed this was happening thru out the restaurant . Hope someone can correct this kitchen & management flaw ."
Mike G.,"Menifee, CA",0,8,1,1.0,7/1/2016,"Don't go here if your hungry or thirsty! You'll be waiting a while for your food, they are in NO hurry to serve you!! Service is about the worst I ever had! Food is good, just eat before you go , so you don't starve."
Roger S.,"Anaheim, CA",0,6,,1.0,10/4/2015,Waited 30 minutes for a beer waiter was a huge dick never coming back suck my balls bj's
Melissa A.,"Moreno Valley, CA",63,7,4,1.0,2/21/2014,"I'm currently sitting in this Bj's right now looking at the clock realizing that I waited 15 minutes for someone just to take my order then another 15 minutes just to be brought water. The service is absolutely terrible. The servers have a problem smiling and apparently there's a problem with tables and servers...we were looked at by several waitresses before one said, ""Has anyone helped you, I'll come back?!"" By the way that was after I went to the front and told the hostess that we had been sitting there. I love Bj's and normally attend the one closer to home. In Moreno Valley, that has amazing service which is surprising because Menifee is such a nicer area. I won't be coming back here. Just an UPDATE I'm still sitting here...no appetizer has been brought. ;) Hey BJ's YOUR SERVICE SUCKS."
Aaron H.,"Corona, CA",0,6,,2.0,12/11/2015,"I have been to many BJ's restaurants.  By far the WORST service I have ever received at any location.  Order was wrong, incorrect drinks served.  Had about 4 different people serving us so I figured it was because of that.  I didn't complain because I didn't think that anything would come of it.  Was given dirty silverware and dirty plates.  I ordered a small pizza with pepperoni and olives.  I received a small pizza with sausage, onions, olives, and one pepperoni.  LOL.   During our first round of drinks, I ordered a blonde and my friend ordered a Crown and Coke.  The second round we ordered two blondes.  We received a blonde and a Crown and Coke.  When we told the server she apologized, gave him the Crown and Coke and never brought the beer that was ordered even though we said it was still wanted.   I have friends that live off Newport and they have all commented on how TERRIBLE the service is at this location.  We experienced it first hand.   Will I go back to BJ's?  Yes.  Will I go back to this location?  No.   PROCEED WITH CAUTION."
G. Y.,"Temecula, CA",0,3,4,1.0,12/5/2015,"Left the L.A. area and stopped in the BJ'S off the 60 FWY @ Azusa, ended up WAITING to get a beer for 27 minutes, finally spoken to and by then was pissed. Came to this location and PISSED BEYOND BELIEF....Waited again (14 Minutes) and had this one Blonde waitress go past me 11 times before Nate finally spoke and offered me a beer and he then TOLD the Blonde waitress what I wanted ""Grand Crew"" and I see her blow me and him off and she continued to ignore me. After 22 minutes and all, my order is taken and I'm still pissed, the WORST SERVICE I HAVE ""CONTINUED"" TO RECEIVE. I am a regular at TEMECULA BJ'S,  and love the staff who always take care of their customers without reservation. My bartenders (Elise & Claudian) and the ENTIRE Management in Temecula are top notch and professional.  Menifee needs a revamp and training off the staff in the Bar area. Going to BJ'S two or three times a week with my Wife and dropping  $125+ each time, I find this type of service at any other BJ'S is UNACCEPTABLE and will only give my money to TEMECULA!!!....GARI Now I k own the waitresses name, "" Jessica""...I guess she thought I wouldn't tip he well....OMG, she better ask somebody, but, the non service I received from her, she would have gotten 0.01 to let her know how sorry her service and acknowledgment to customers is. Just plain out DISAPPOINTED  !!!!"
Bethany M.,"Murrieta, CA",25,94,8,3.0,9/24/2015,"The appetizer:  the chips were stale...really bummed! The salad:  nothing spectacular, but ok.  They should take lessons from Texas Roadhouse! The pizza:  Really good! The rootbeer:  Fantastic The dessert/Pizookies:  Outrageously tasty!"
Marie S.,"Homeland, CA",26,8,,5.0,5/18/2016,"Love the food and service. Yum deep dish pizza, so many good dishes to try and wonderful service"
Ashley M.,"Riverside, CA",23,5,,1.0,5/1/2015,"Worst Experience of my life! The bartender did not know how to make a Snakebite,why would promote or hire someone that does not know how to bartend! Putting a Ale ( when it should be Guinness) and not even layering the drink with a bent spoon!ugh, and then I got a Poke Dish which, I have ordered several of times and it was not FRESH that is horrible! I had food Poisoning and the next day I was so sick all day long!...My boyfriend called the Restaurant and the front desk, oh we got multiple phone calls about that dish...and did not even get a manager on the phone! ARE YOU KIDDING me! You are lucky we did not report this to healthy grade...I will NEVER EVER go back to this location...let alone your front desk are huge Bitches! Get some class, put on a smile and give great costumer service it's not that hard!I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM A MANAGER SINCE...THEY ARE TOO LAZY TO GET TO THE PHONE!"
Chassidy G.,"Tampa, FL",94,56,24,2.0,8/8/2015,"Our waitress was awful, took forever to get refills, our order in and then get our food. Not sure if the girl was overwhelmed or just didn't want to do her job that night. Food was good once we got it. The kids loved their desserts that we ordered."
Tina E.,"Menifee, CA",1,49,3,1.0,9/16/2015,Service just SUCks.   No personality waitresses will ruin any meal.  I would rather have a mediocre meal and a great waitress than a world class meal and crap service
Annicka R.,"Menifee, CA",26,24,8,4.0,5/22/2015,"I come here frequently when I have the time, money, or an occasion to celebrate. Their food is always outstanding. Occasionally their servers can use a little work, but they're always friendly and honestly we only ever have slow service when the place is busy, which is to be expected. Occasionally we just get forgotten in the mayhem."
Fatty D.,"Menifee, CA",3,36,,3.0,7/28/2015,"Went back again as a friend chose this as a meet up spot. I have to say, the food was a little better than I remembered. I had some sort of beet and strawberry salad and it was very good! Their pizza was still just okay, nothing to write home about. The service was still definitely lackluster, I was never greeted at the door and the hostesses seemed very involved in their conversation. After a couple of minutes of waiting awkwardly I ultimately walked in and found my friends. Our server was efficient, if not necessarily friendly. She seemed unenthusiastic to have a big group of chatty moms.... But FYI to all servers out there, chatty moms do not get out much aNd if you give good service they will happily reward you with tips! :)"
