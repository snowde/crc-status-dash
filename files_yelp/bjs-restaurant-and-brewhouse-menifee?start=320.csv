Heather B.,"Colton, CA",44,22,11,5.0,4/2/2016,"I doubt there's anything much I can say in a review of a chain like BJ's that hasn't already been said...  The food is good, the environment is fun.  The thing that sets this restaurant  (like most others) is the service.  The hubby and I have stopped here a couple times on our way home.  Each time the waiters have been fabulous.  The first gentleman was in the bar area, great, attentive and even helped us play a fun joke on a friend that was there and didn't see us (we sent the friend a Shirley Temple and a private joke written on a napkin).  The last time we went Steven was our server.  He rocks!  Great service, fabulous attitude.  He checked in regularly without being annoying made sure our drinks never emptied all the way before another arrived, and chatted with us like we were friends.  I'd wait to be seated in his section on future visits. If you see him, let him know the "".75 cent tippers"" say hi..."
Sara A.,"Hemet, CA",125,27,,4.0,5/30/2015,"Always great food. Our server sort of dropped off in the middle of lunch(only reason for not a 5 star, I feel like with the 12 people there, we would have been totally forgotten about if it was busier), but the gal at the bar was so sweet. I was looking for a six pack of Jeremiah Red to bribe my husband and they didn't have it, but she hooked me up with some special brews he loved(and is sipping now). She went the extra mile digging around all the while keeping her bar maintained. Nice location. Nice staff. Will be back."
Adreannaannaeirda E.,"Menifee, CA",23,12,1,4.0,7/18/2015,"I had a great experience here, staff was friendly and quick to respond.  One dish wasn't prepared as expected and waiter was happy to accommodate with a different dish with no problems. Good atmosphere and clean bathrooms! I will return ;)"
Alison G.,"Menifee, CA",0,7,2,2.0,2/5/2015,"Sighhhhh was so hoping that new management would be a plus on service but all as service is still poor, inattentive and in need of training...... so note to management your servers lack professionalism and attentiveness..... sad when they walk away when a customer is trying to ask a question...... maybe you need to hire a trainer or raise the standards of you crew.   But first and foremost maybe you should tell you asset. managers if someone asks you to step outside to discuss poor service maybe addressing situation professionally is better than claiming they are you best server.... If that is the fact how very sad.... I was not looking for a free meal but that was definitely how I was made to feel...... definitely not how any of my employees were ever taught how to handle similar situations...... Lisa you have your work cut out for you I. definitely feel sorry for you."
Lawrence H.,Italy,1075,88,81,5.0,1/27/2015,Super nice BJ's haha and totally packed so much so that we couldn't get a table. The line and wait was way to long but as far as how clean and great the place looked I give it five stars. Look elsewhere for food reviews. Once I eat here I will update the stars. BOO-YAH!!!
Hattie M.,"Sun City, CA",0,1,,2.0,12/2/2016,"My husband and I just went to BJ'S for dinner here in Menifee and what a disappointment! It was truly a waste of our hard earned money and time! My food was cold! Our server was a very nice young lady who was kind enough to take the food back and requested another, but it took forever. While waiting for my replacement food I shared my husband's pasta and when my food finally came, we were done, so we packed it up and left. It would have been nice had the Manager come over and explained that the kitchen was backed up, said sorry that the food wasn't right the first time, apologised or something, but nothing. We live in Menifee and like to support the local businesses but after tonight we will not longer be able to support our BJ'S, which is sad for us because we have always enjoyed the BJ'S in Temecula and Moreno Valley and was so happy that one was opening in our city. I guess if we want BJ'S we now know where we will have to go! My husband said 1 star but I'm giving it a 2 because our server was nice, but it was more like a 1 star!"
Adeile A.,"San Diego, CA",448,202,11,3.0,11/19/2013,"How can you not like BJs???  The service was prompt and the food was delish... I had a burger of some sort, but I could have used a little bit more fries!!! My friends had salads and it looked delish but it looked like it was lacking some color w/ their veggies!! But i would come back here... maybe for a pazookie!! YUM!!!"
Jackie R.,"Temecula, CA",19,38,41,2.0,6/2/2015,This is probably the worst BJs I've ever been to. The food was ok my sisters pizza was cold when she hot it. And when I say cold it I mean cold. The pan wasn't even hot. The waitress was nice but didn't serve us very much. Didn't bring a plate with the pizza to eat with. The drinks took at least 15 minutes every time we ordered new drinks. It just all in all wasn't a good experience. I like BJs I just won't go to this one again
Edison C.,"Riverside, CA",0,24,,5.0,11/28/2015,"A family member had made reservations for about 15 friends and family.  Everyones plate looked great, no one complained, servers were attentive. I had never been to a BJs before, but now that I know you are 2 miles from me, I will be coming in for the food on occasion."
Julie D.,"Sun City, CA",114,152,2,4.0,6/20/2015,"My friends and I came to BJs on a Wednesday afternoon for lunch, mostly because we had gift cards. I had a chicken alfredo loaded baked potato and a bowl of cream of broccoli soup. Both were delicious, although the potato was smaller than I expected for an entrée at lunch. Our waitress was attentive and let us chat for a while as the restaurant emptied out after lunch.  I would return."
Erin R.,"Corona, CA",0,13,,5.0,10/6/2015,I love going here. The food is great almost every time. We have only had one bad experience but everyone deserves to have an off day. Most of the time the service is outstanding and the people are nice. I reccomend the angel hair classico and finishing the meal off with a oreo pazooki!!
Jana K.,"Hemet, CA",10,41,26,1.0,5/22/2015,"Our family loves BJs restaurant but this is by far the worst!!!! They took forever for the food to come out, then we waited a long time just to get our check. I tried it another time thinking maybe that was a bad night but no, the second time they forgot my order and messed up my husbands order. The servers are sometimes okay and other times not nice. Never going back!"
Sean D.,"Menifee, CA",135,28,15,2.0,12/16/2014,"I love BJs normally, Been to the Temecula and Rancho Cucamonga location a lot and love it. However, this location seems to be off. Not sure where to place it. The service is hit or miss and food doesn't seem to be as good. Puzzling."
Jim H.,"Menifee, CA",1,51,13,1.0,5/5/2015,"I gave this place  3 attempts to get the new restaurant service in order.  I use to go the BJ's in South Corona for the Laker games and it was always great. Unfortunately this location in my home town is horrible. The pizza is all that is consistent.  Table service any where else other then the  bar area is horrible. Lunch and happy hour appetizers are not good.  I am a value versus quality should equal great service type of person. Good luck BJ's Menifee , I will  not be returning after this 3rd try.  Make your minds up folks and give it a try, its just not for me."
James E.,"Menifee, CA",2,8,2,1.0,2/28/2015,"Don't expect to see your server more than once every 30 minutes, at least that was my experience!  Also, it might be my fault but if you order the steak (I know it's a pizza place) don't expect it to be to order I asked for medium and got well done, chewy, and over seasoned steak.  The steamed vegetables were definitely over cooked as well!  It's unfortunate to have an experience like this and unfortunately this wasn't the first bad experience I've had here."
Tony R.,"San Diego, CA",6,8,15,1.0,12/18/2013,Long and overdue. Tonight a waitress dropped all 6 drinks on our table. No support or help from her fellow coworkers. And especially no Manager around to help with the situation. The floored stayed soaked half way through our meal until I finally called for a Manager.  Now this was our third time of service issues and comping us a meal for bad service however I feel this is not how a restaurant should operate on a normal basis. From friends who ate here also say they also experienced poor service.  With that said I would say food quality was a 3 star.
Mrj U.,"Riverside, CA",0,12,11,1.0,11/29/2013,"Worst service, food was  just ok, some food was cold. No plates no forks , u have to ask for it.even restsurant was not busy but still very slow service. No way to come back here."
Don J.,"Murrieta, CA",17,46,4,5.0,5/8/2014,This place is awesome! Love the great staff and all the good beer on tap!  Great selections and the good I good as well!!! Can't go wrong especially during happy hour here on weekday! Fun and cool atmosphere!
Jennifer K.,"Perris, CA",34,14,5,2.0,7/5/2015,"Went to BJ's because Red Robin had a 20 min wait, however I could have waited the 20 min and still been done at the same time.  Service very slow, 15 min before someone took our drink order & food took forever.  Restaurant was maybe 1/2 full so no excuse. There was nothing special about anything we ate, chicken, burger, appetizer, salad.  Overpriced , bland and small portions.  The lunch menu looked like a pretty good value but of course only avail m-f.  Probably won't go again."
Megan J.,"Temecula, CA",243,512,139,4.0,12/14/2013,"You know, I'm not sure why this place has such a low rating. Maybe we got an exceptionally good night?!?! Weird... Hubs and I did the called ahead seating which is always the best way to go and only waited for about 10 minutes for a Friday night? Not bad. Server was friendly, appetizers and drinks came out quickly and done right (food was not cold so don't know why people said that) and our salad came out in the right amount of time before our entree. I ordered the Chicken Bacon Ranch pizza mini size and it was perfect. Server made sure our drinks were filled and made sure food tasted great. Honestly, couldn't have asked for anything better. Their Strawberry Mojito was WAY amazing and can't wait to come back and try it. Of course, we finished the night off with a Chocolate Chip Pazookie and OMG such a great way to end the night. So good! Whenever we come to BJ's we always get the Pazookie no matter what.  Maybe there is a lot of super picky people here I don't know. But our experience at BJ's was great and maybe people should give this BJ's another chance??"
