Robert M.,"Murrieta, CA",20,43,16,2.0,3/31/2015,"Bummer, wait 20 minutes for pasta a pizza. Then they forget the side orders and totally served undercooked pasta (like crunchy pasta that gets stuck in your teeth and the party that got sat after us got their pizza first!) would be zero stars but Chris the manager showed up immediately and apologizes offering a replacement meal, but at this time we are tired and have to drive another 30 minutes home, we decline as he offers a gift card for a next visit. We'll see how that goes."
Madison R.,"Menifee, CA",0,7,,2.0,2/12/2015,"I'm not one to leave unpleasant reviews , but the last few experiences at this location has been awful. The food is amazing and the drinks are fantastic but the service is terrible !  The first recent issue was when a couple of friends and I asked our waitress which drink she would recommend. He answer was rudely ""I don't drink."" She claimed she was going to ask the bartender what he would recommend and she NEVER came back to help us . Quick fix.. Go straight to the bar .   Second issue , while sitting outside for lunch one day, I happen to drop my phone on my way out . One of the servers picked it up and left it at the Hostess area. When I returned I asked the hostess if any phones had been returned and she quickly said No, without even checking . I decided to ask a different person , who ACTUALLY checked.. And my phone was exactly where the first hostess was sitting .  Overall , I've been coming to BJ's long enough to know there are some great servers who work here !!  But unfortunately there are many who have also ruined our entire experience at this restaurant ."
Libby A.,"Colorado Springs, CO",98,55,36,3.0,3/24/2014,"Love the food but it takes about average 15-20 minutes for it to come out. Service is not great nor bad, because they are patient and willing to answer questions, but once their gone.....they are GONE you would have to speed battle a server that walks by... I mean why are there servers you've never seen serve your meal and bring your ranch dressing, than the one who initially does your orders and goes ""if you have any questions please let me know"" But other than that...love their food :)!!"
Stew P.,"Temecula, CA",1,9,,1.0,2/22/2014,"Been to BJ's in San Diego a bunch of times and always had great service and food.  Not sure what's going on here.  We came in and asked to be seated in the bar area.  We waited a good 20 minutes before someone acknowledged us and it took forever for our food.  No silverware until after our food arrived.  Had to asked for drink refills.  Frustrating!   If every BJ's Restaurant has to play by the same rules, have the same service standards, get the same training, serve the same food that they get from the same vendors, you would think Menifee would be the same as others.  Right? Wrong!  The one area that is different at every BJ's is the MANAGEMENT.  Whoever is running this place should be replaced, retrained, or learn how to lead.  Stop managing the restaurant from the OFFICE, get out on the floor and focus on the GUEST! If I ran my business like this, I would be OUT OF BUSINESS.   Good luck and GOOD BYE!!!  I won't be back here."
Onzal B.,"Menifee, CA",0,3,,4.0,9/1/2015,"I've only eaten there a few times, but only had one bad experience. It was shortly after they opened and I thought their service was extremely slow. Since then, there have been no problems. Service and food have been good. I believe it was a learning curve that they have overcome. Ken Boles"
Lynda G.,"Menifee, CA",0,10,,5.0,12/1/2013,"It's a busy place, but the ambience, décor and service is why I choose to eat Sunday lunch there -- which is soooo much food, I take half of it home for dinner later on. As a footnote, my son accidentally left his wallet there. One phone call and a trip down the street later, the manager handed my son his wallet, intact.  Thank you BJs for your excellent food, attentive staff and nice environs."
Robert L.,"Lewiston, ME",4,4,19,5.0,6/21/2015,The girls had the Maui Maui and the guys had burgers excellent all across the board finish with a could of brews and we're good
Esperanza S.,"Menifee, CA",0,19,7,1.0,4/19/2015,Worst service for this BJ. They take so long to greet you once you are seated. Then they take long to bring the check. I avoid this place because of this.
Judy F.,"Perris, CA",38,28,12,3.0,10/18/2013,"It's ok , food was ok. They need a new dishwasher, utensils had a lot of spots , gross"
Tyler-james A.,"Perris, CA",146,3,,5.0,12/7/2014,I came in here on sunday morning wirh a few friends for brunch. We sat in the bar area and unless I am sitting at the bar top the service in that area is usually lacking. HOWEVER today Jordan was our server and she was incredible. The absolute best servuce u have ever gotten at any BJs restaraunt. Her demeanor was friendly and bright and I was extremely hapoy with how the meal turned out. JORDAN was incredible and the food was good as well.
Raul A.,"Temecula, CA",2,22,20,5.0,12/10/2013,"Good food great service, need to give credit were is deserve, Michelle our waitress did and awesome job. Very fast service and great food."
Kasey H.,"Spokane, WA",0,8,,4.0,8/18/2015,"They have a great selection of beer, wine, and mixed drinks, especially their strawberry cocktails. Their food has always been very good as well, and I've had fairly good experiences with the wait staff. There were a couple times I went there that the wait for food and drinks was a bit exorbitant, especially when I went in a larger group. However, if I go in a smaller group of about 2 to 6 it seems pretty reasonable."
Katie W.,"Wildomar, CA",3,11,5,1.0,12/17/2014,"Don't go to the Menifee location! Worst service I've ever had at a restaurant. Between waiting 5 plus minutes to even be greeted by your waiter, not getting what you order, and being served an incomplete order because the server ""forgot"" you wanted your soup in a bread bowl this is hands down the worst customer service ever! No amount of free pazookis make up for the lack of service. Your lucky if you even see your server other than when they take the order as well, so don't drink your drink too quick cause refills are few and far between."
Evin A.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,17,9,5.0,8/13/2015,I have bin to the location dozens of times. Large parties to just me at the bar! Always respectful and quick service. I have also done some take out orders never a problem. Eat and enjoy cheers
Tony P.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",6,4,4,4.0,1/5/2015,The service tonight was much better. The thyme chicken was recommended by our waiter Chris and was outstanding! The cocktails came out quick and the food came out hot.
Harry W.,"Riverside, CA",0,16,,2.0,9/9/2013,"This place is over rated.  It was super crowded and the wait was over an hour for a party of six. Ok fine, we head to the bar and have a couple of drinks, theres nowhere to even stand as the servers are constantly pushing through and i was literally doing the Ickey shuffle until we got our table. The food was meh...the pizzas we ordered were both RAW in the middle, but we ordered so much food we ended up taking the pizza home and tossing it away.  everything else we ordered was just ""ok"" to not very tasty. Server was nice though. I understand its a new restaurant in a developing area, but you're better off driving to Temecula to the Yardhouse.. Much better. Sorry"
Marjie T.,"Menifee, CA",0,43,,5.0,5/30/2015,"I'm not sure why all the bad reviews, but we have always had a better experience than most of the other diners commenting here.  Tonight, Chris took very good care of us.  Our order came out right and on time.  It tasted very good.  What more can you ask for?"
Pamela W.,"Menifee, CA",275,87,35,1.0,7/26/2013,"My first experience I was kind of disappointed! The service was bad and my salad was wilted and pizza was bland! Asked several times for service and it seemed like we were ignored! Finally the busboy helped us.  Lively place for a Sunday at 5! Parking is difficult!  My niece wanted to celebrate her Birthday dinner there, so my second attempt was another horrible experience, this time a nightmare! The waiter seemed to have WAY too many energy drinks and couldn't really focus on what we really wanted! I need to order Gluten free foods, and thought I was getting what I ordered as gluten free, but it was full of gluten! I was given a gluten free menu after the fact. Shocked as to why the waiter, being there since they opened was NOT aware or cared to give me a gluten free menu. He also messed up on my parties orders, or was it the cook? I also will add the drinks were full of ice and watered down. We had to wait quiet awhile for our food, and when we finally got it 5 people out of my party said their order was totally wrong!                                                               ~~~~ To be honest I rather poke my eyes out, then to step foot in that messed up establishment! Get your sh** together BJ's! PS ... The manager tried to make it right, but to be honest by then, the Birthday Dinner was a disaster!  Maybe a third time is a charm? No Thank you!!!"
Jackie T.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",24,71,63,4.0,10/11/2013,Sunday happy hour all day. Love it!! However my pizookie doesn't fall in the happy hour discounts but that didn't stop me from getting it. Our server was great ! Had a little issue with the bill and she corrected and discounted it quickly.
Kim K.,"Murrieta, CA",7,10,2,1.0,12/8/2014,"horrreeeeeeble!  The service has been aweful everytime weve been. We go to BJ's regularly in other areas, Temecula, Corona, Westlake village ca and have never had a problem. Huge fans of BJ's, just wont go to Menifee anymore. No matter how busy they are, it always takes FOREVERRRRRRRRRRRR to get someone to take your order, then takes FOREVERRRRRRRRR to get your cold food, FOREVERRRRRRRRRRR to get refills, and you're lucky if they bring your appetizers/salads before your meal. Wont go back FOREVERRRRRRRRR!"
