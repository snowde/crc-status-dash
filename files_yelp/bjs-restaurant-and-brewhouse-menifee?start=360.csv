Andrea S.,"Sun City, CA",8,18,7,5.0,11/28/2014,The Jamabyla was great...excellent service (Theresa) and beer samplers...how much better can you get...we will definitely be regulars here
Dee G.,"Mira Loma, CA",4,7,1,1.0,2/15/2016,"The Bj's in Rancho Cucamonga must set a high bar that is too hard to follow. This Bj's showed up to our table 1 chair short. After waiting about 15 minutes for a server to pass time I said I walked over and got his own chair. We also had three children and requested to boosters. We had to wait for our server to go home before the new server brought us booster seats.  The first server put lemon in my water which is a pet peeve of mine. I do not want dirty leomon peels to my water which is why i do not ask for it.  When the food came, we had to request ketchup, and steak sauce. I ordered dessert for the kids which has still not arrived. When the adult desert has arrived and now the kids are eating their dessert because of course its sweet and looks good and they I don't have any. Myself a salad which should come with avocado did not. When I asked the waiter about it he told me it didn't come with avocado when I looked at the menu it is clearly listed there. Then they bring only 2 of the kids dessert so the 3rd one must sit and watch.  Not happy."
Paul N.,"Anaheim, CA",87,15,7,2.0,11/5/2013,"Came here yesterday at lunch for my girlfriends birthday. The hostess was very nice. Our server on the other hand was really scattered... 4 of us were seated. Only two napkins with utensils were on the table. 3 of us wanted to order some beers for ourselves. My friend was first to place an order, than i placed my ordered, right about when my girlfriend was going to say what she wanted our server took off.  We ordered the Deep Dish Buffalo Chicken Pizza. And my god how disappointed i was the pizza had about an inch and a half of dough, and a tiny thin layer of sauce and toppings. Definitely not a deep dish pie."
Kate R.,"Orange, CA",12,116,215,5.0,11/23/2014,I love Megan! She is a great server! The salad deals & appetizers are awesome. 1/2 off wine on Tuesdays too.
Shawn W.,"Menifee, CA",3,16,3,4.0,12/28/2014,I hear all the bad service info on Yelp. My friend and I had only one place open to go and eat on the day Before Christmas. But there Service was so good I might just have to go back.
Stephanie S.,"San Diego, CA",245,47,11,3.0,9/23/2014,"Their menu is quite large and is filled with several micro-brews, deep dish pizzas, salads, soups, tacos, sandwiches, pastas, steaks, ribs, seafood, and desserts. It's quite difficult to navigate the menu and make a decision. After the daunting task of ordering, the service usually goes pretty smoothly. I'm not sure what direction BJ's is trying to go but you end up with just a mediocre experience."
Eviltina P.,"Nuevo, CA",0,7,2,4.0,7/26/2015,"We had dinner for my son's birthday tonight, nine in our group, The service was awesome, our server (Chris Merchant) was refreshing, he had a great attitude and did a fantastic job filling our every request, some of the best service I've ever had here. The only downside of the evening, I ordered a full rack of baby back ribs and shortly after I was informed they were out of ribs. This was a let down but the manager did make it right, Good job!"
Alisa A.,"Anza, CA",10,6,2,3.0,2/28/2015,"We arrived with a group of 11,. The restaurant wasn't busy but it took over an hour to receive our food. Their seems to be enough staff but maybe the kitchen understaffed.. The Temecula Bjs is more efficient and timely. Our waitress was at least with it on the drinks."
Kathy S.,"Temecula, CA",0,3,,5.0,4/17/2016,This restaurant continues to be our favorite with great food and service. Shot out to our favorite waiter Steven J. We live in Temecula and drive to your location because of the service we receive. We appreciate the VIP treatment!!
Jordan L.,"Highland, CA",0,2,,4.0,4/11/2016,Steven J is awesome!!! His warm welcome made us feel at home.. He provided us with great knowledge of the amazing drinks and appetizers they serve. He was prompt with our drinks and food... When we went back for a second time that week he remembered us by our names and thats so unusual.. Can't wait to come back...
Scott V.,"Corona, CA",246,70,14,2.0,5/27/2013,"Took my old lady here for Mothers Day...should have noticed that the wait wasn't that long even on a holiday. We ordered a pizza and we were all quite disappointed in our ""Pie"".  The pizza was luke warm at best...barely had any sauce...and so little cheese that we could see straight through to the pizza crust.   it seriously felt like you guys were running out of ingredients and trying to get through the night until your next delivery of supplies. Seriously, the only saving grace was the Pizookie.  You guys have these down pat!  And the Rootbeer and Black Cherry Soda were also top notch! You should just get real and change the name of this place to BJ's Pizookies and Rootbeer...you'll do much better in my opinion.  Pizza is just not your thing.  Sorry...but i wasn't impressed.  Maybe it was just this location...i swear i've had better pizza at your other locations."
Rachel E.,"San Diego, CA",9,92,46,3.0,11/13/2014,Avocado egg rolls are always yummy. However the employees need to be a little more friendly and better educated o. Their beers.
Valerie S.,"Riverside, CA",0,1,,5.0,4/6/2016,We had a really nice experience last night at BJ's. Andres was our server.  The food was great. He was an awesome server. We will be back for sure
Angela D.,"Hemet, CA",83,1025,5,4.0,1/14/2014,"We had some shopping to do at Best Buy so we decided to hit up BJ's for dinner, no wait at all, seated immediately for dinner on a Monday night. Our waitress was Julie, very high energy, super friendly, she knew her stuff. Food was good, took awhile to arrive but was worth the wait. We had Santa Fe egg rolls, BBQ chicken deep dish pizza, Angel hair pasta with grilled chicken, artichoke hearts & sun dried tomatoes in lemon cream sauce(couldn't remember the exact name of the dish) We enjoyed our meal and came home with plenty of leftovers, they give you a lot of food. Wouldn't mind going back if we're in the area."
Barbara Z.,"New York, NY",492,206,130,2.0,8/23/2014,The food is good... typical delicious B.J's food but the service is just terrible. I've been quite often because it's close to home but I've never had good service even once. It seems like management is hiring the least qualified individuals to wait tables. Maybe they don't want anyone out shinning them? #JustSaying
Neiser D.,"Chula Vista, CA",20,16,,1.0,2/1/2015,"I came here to buy BJ's Favorite deep dish pizza for my Super Bowl party and when I got it and checked it out before i left, it was missing one key ingredient, ""Sausage"" and other things.  I was very disappointed from such a reputable franchise.  I do not think that these cooks pay close attention to details for such an expensive menu Items.  I will never come to this place ever again.  Word of advise to everyone, always check your food to go."
Murrieta S.,"Murrieta, CA",3,82,2,1.0,3/30/2013,OVER RATED  Had salad and soup Soup arrived cold or luke warm twice and salad was tiny portions. Waitress said it'll be just a minute.  It was a BJ minute not 60 seconds.  More like 10 or 12 before she returns with more food. Really over priced and horrible Fool me once = that's enough to not return I work too hard for my coin to give it away
Cats W.,"Carlsbad, CA",1,4,,5.0,3/31/2016,"on my visit 3/30/16 i was a bit apprehensive, since I had read some really poor reviews for this location.  I was meeting a friend, we had formerly worked together and hadn't seen each other for almost ten years!  Whoever the new manager is, he/she has built a great team... we had lunch and visited from about 11:30 until 2:40... had remarkably efficient and good service... never made us feel like we should move on and give them the table, staff shared refill duty w/tea and water, my friend had special order and it was ""no problem"" -- all afternoon we were made to feel like welcome guests!  Kudos to BJs, I'm sorry we failed to get all the names of the servers, but it should be easy enough to check your schedule to see where the ""good job"" remarks should go... this is a great spot for me to meet my friends from Riverside and not too long a drive up from Carlsbad for me... thank you.  Cats"
Mike A.,"San Diego, CA",3,5,,4.0,3/1/2015,"My girlfriend and I sat in a booth at the bar and were immediately seated. We ordered the Santa Fe Chicken Salad and Mediterranean chicken tacos. Both were delicious, the service impeccable, and the food was out in less than 10 minutes. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who likes a step above standard bar fare."
Levi K.,"O'Fallon, IL",7,2,,5.0,4/8/2015,I don't know why people are giving this BJ's such bad reviews.  They've been great every time I've been there.  Good food and I have had good service as well.  I'm not saying somebody doesn't have a bad day once in a while but I have personally never had a bad experience there.
