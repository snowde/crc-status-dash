Vanessa B.,"Canyon Lake, CA",0,1,,1.0,6/12/2015,"Food is great! Service sucks! I don't know how they can stay in business with a server like Frank Z. That's the second time we have had him and he has never failed to disappoint!  Visit number 1: Before the restaurant was closed he told us that the kitchen was closed and we were unable to get our dessert! He said that when he called last call for my beer that also counted for the kitchen.  Visit number 2: He completely forgets an order (there is only 3 of us), then when we asked about the order he said, ""oh you still wanted that?"" The order didn't come out until after our dessert. Also we had to ask for every one of our refills on soft drinks and water. I don't know how Frank could possibly be a closer."
Michael C.,"Menifee, CA",13,25,42,4.0,9/29/2014,I never use to like BJ's as I guess I never really gave it a chance. I went for one of their beer samplings and tasted beers that were matched with their food. I have to say I love their pizza the 5 meat is so tasty... It has open my view on them and their business and I now come to enjoy beers I would not normally drink with a pizza.
Mike M.,"Menifee, CA",0,16,,3.0,3/27/2016,"O.K., now listen folks . . . the service at this particular BJs has actually improved!  No kidding.  At one time it was the absolute rock bottom of all BJs in the Inland Empire.  Well, it still is when it comes to service but it has improved.  Usual wait time to be served in the bar (not at the bar itself, those tenders rock) is around ten minutes so bring a newspaper or book.  The food is still excellent and they still can't (won't?) put close captioning on the TVs but, what are you going to do?  They are a Menifee fixture due to all their quirks."
Alexa C.,"Perris, CA",97,4,,2.0,12/13/2014,"Every time my family or I go here, we receive horrible service. I, personally have experienced beers not brought to me because the server thought I looked too young. Your establishment is not ADA friendly, and neither are your employees. - sincerely wheelchair girl"
Amber G.,"Menifee, CA",1,7,4,4.0,11/21/2014,"Good food, good service. It's kind of small for a BJs and the staff is a little hectic, we were brought things we didn't order a couple times but all in all a good experience. Their NY strip was over seasoned but great flavor, their sirloin has great natural flavor and their thin crispy fries are yummy! But the salted Carmel pazookie is TO DIE FOR! I will definitely come back"
James W.,"San Diego, CA",101,5,7,2.0,3/15/2015,Everything was going great until my medium steak came well done... Not good at all we you're as hungry as I am right now... Someone please save me from complaining about this horrible injustice...
Kevin V.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",0,7,,2.0,5/1/2013,"Worst experience I have ever had at a BJs...  The service sucked, it took 45 minutes to get our food and the waitress had to ask us to repeat our order three times. When the food did finally get to the table it looked like it was just thrown on the plate...yuck.  My fiancé ordered fish tacos; they were cold and hardly any meat in them. I ordered a mini pizza; it was dried out and hardly any cheese or sauce on it. I have had better frozen pizzas, really. All this from a restaurant that by the time you get out the door with two entrées, an appetizer, two soft drinks, tip and tax will probably run you about $50! I feel ripped off... I will never visit this establishment again."
Joshua T.,"Menifee, CA",0,8,,1.0,7/4/2015,"My family and I have eaten at this restaurant twice. The service was the absolutely the worst, It took almost an 1 1/2 hours to get our dinners, and in both visits They forgot food we ordered and had to ask multiple times where it was, the last visit I had an Italian dish, just before we left the waitress put one piece of dry, rock hard garlic toast on the table and said ""sorry for the wait, the kitchen forgot this earlier"". Read the other reviews."
Veronica W.,"Sun City, CA",8,29,,3.0,11/16/2013,"Food: is ok i ordered a avocado chicken sandwich with thin fries. Service: was good my first visit but the second visit not so much. Our waitress introduced a new waiter to our table and said he was going to be taking over. We didn't have silverware to start, our appetizer took forever to arrive and so did our meal. I thought it was odd that our  waiter kept checking on us even though we had not received our food yet.  When we got our checks the waiter started asking us for all our empty plates which they should leave for the bust boys."
C C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,7,,3.0,8/14/2013,"Great food ...if you ever get it!  We eat here all the time and it's like playing Russian roulette...you never know how the service will turn out. Tonight was a disaster.  First they almost sat us down at a dirty table.  Then after being seated at another table we waited over 10 minutes and no one ever came to ask us wha t we wanted to drink. I went up to the front desk and complained.  After about another 5 min wait a waiter come by and says ""I'll take your order ...for now"".  What? Did you say ""for now""? You mean you're not our server? Where's our server?  He said..I don't know!  So we asked to be moved to a table where we would have a proper server for the night.  They moved us.  The waitress took our drink order and appetizer... I got my beer (tried their new Oasis beer)... But we waited over 20 mins for the appetizer..by then the beer was warm. I sent back the beer because it tasted bland..no flavor..asked for my usual Jeremiah Red.   When we finally got our order the corn bread was stone cold! ...like they just took it out of the fridge!! We sent it back... when we got the now warm corn bread they were limp warm like they had just popped it in a microwave to warm them up! REALLY!?? Like we wouldn't notice!?  We had a $5 dollar off coupon which, when we got our bill, had not been taken off the total...and to top it all off the waitress charged me for that first beer which I told her I did not like and I didn't really drink.  Over 1 1/2 hours later we left the restaurant. So disappointed cause I think the food could be really great if only they got their act together. GEEZ!"
Jon T.,"Menifee, CA",14,36,17,5.0,12/31/2014,"Ok look...it's all about the service....our Server tonight was Maili...she was an amazing server. Never an empty glass and never had to wait to ask for a single thing. Been here half a dozen times, and this was absolutely the best service ever. Food was good as always. Lemon honey scallops were great. Ryan and Sarah killed the bar tonight. My lady was super happy and she's a hard sale. That makes me happy. HAPPY NEW YEARS BJ's Menifee. Thank you"
Michelle J.,"Menifee, CA",15,46,168,1.0,9/22/2014,"If it wasn't for the pizzokies, I would never go here. The only thing worse than the food is the service.....horrible service and not just at this location."
Steven C.,"Temecula, CA",0,14,,4.0,3/10/2016,"Came in with my fiancé and his family tonight before they went back home. We got Jessica as our server and she was amazing. Prompt, friendly, and ensured we had a good night. The management staff was amazing too. They stopped by to make sure everything was going well. The only drawback was that the Caesar salad was frozen. But other than that, great night!"
Liz B.,"Wildomar, CA",1,10,1,5.0,10/25/2014,New management has made a difference for sure. Good is always amazing and my servers and others are always asking if I need anything else. Great place for an event! Or even a quiet date for two!
Lisa T.,"Menifee, CA",18,7,3,5.0,9/9/2014,We just had dinner here for our anniversary.  The food was great and our server Angela was awesome!
Patrick M.,"Murrieta, CA",48,12,4,2.0,7/31/2014,"Been to this BJ's perhaps a dozen times since it opened. Service has always been hit or miss.  Tonight it was especially bad.   Our server was friendly enough, but seemed to be either distracted or had too many tables. Soup that was ordered was never delivered.  Napkins/silverware never given; had to ask for them after our food was delivered.  When I asked our server to ensure the soup wasn't on our bill, the manager visited the table.  I wasn't sure if she was apologizing or sizing me up to see if I was lying about having never received the soup.  My wife's burger was missing it's bacon; had to ask for that to be delivered to the table.  Asked multiple times for glasses of water; finally after flagging the manager down again we got water.  We have a BJ's rewards membership that was given to the server as we ordered, and our bill was not credited towards our membership until after we had to ask the manager to credit it.  We had a coupon for a free pizookie that we showed to the server when we ordered a pizookie.  A charge for the pizookie was on the bill; had to ask the manager yet again to remove the charge...oh yea, and the bill was delivered just as my wife was finishing her meal and well before the pizookie arrived.  BJ's is lucky that their food/beer is so good because mediocre at best service is what I expect when visiting this location."
Gino P.,"Menifee, CA",4,7,1,2.0,1/12/2015,Being local to menifee I've given this restaurant several tries hoping it would be better. The staff is friendly although the food is always under par. My family and I recently tried again and everything came out either cold ...missing or over cooked. After 4 bad experiences I think I'm throwing the towel in on this one!
Jasmine P.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",0,14,,5.0,3/5/2016,"Good food, good service and good prices. We love the idea of this being a nice place near our home that we can eat at without having to go far.  Of course their pizookies are amazing!"
Larayna C.,"San Jacinto, CA",105,251,1,3.0,11/26/2012,"Brunette hostess was OVERWHELMING with friendliness. (sarcasm). The waitress in the bar has so far been phenomenal. Good thing. As soon as I walked in the door I got a bad taste for this place.  The cute brunette hostess at the door was so unenthusiastic I thought maybe we should run for the hills. She smugly asked us how many and when we told her we were bar seating, said ""ok"" and let us go on our way. We seemed to have inconvenience her somehow.  My friend warned me about the service in this place. Shame, because it's so much closer then the Temecula or Moreno Valley location!  The service in the bar area was a much needed improvement from the PMSing hostess. The girl was fun, happy, and more then eager to suggest different menu items! She highly recommend the Balsamic Mozzarella Salad, it was delicious! I'm so glad I took her advice.  If it weren't for this server, BJ's of Menifee would be screwed. Their server at the front needs to be moved to the back to clean dishes. If you don't like greeting people, DONT be a hostess."
Sara Y.,"Menifee, CA",0,2,,1.0,7/30/2016,"The last two visits have been bad. After reading previous reviews I seem to not be the only one with similar complaints! Previous to this one, the dining experience in Oxnard was just the same as this one. It took at least 15 minutes for our waiter to come to our table after a quick 'hi be right back'. He blamed the wait on a number of events. After he returned and drink orders were placed another substantial length of time passed until drinks arrived, we immediately decided to place our appetizer and dinner orders. 45-50 minutes passed before we saw our food orders. Our drinks ran low and waters out, our friend who was with us had to flag our waiter down for water as he had not returned to check on us at all since order placement. We were so starving we started eating the appetizers like savages when they arrived and then another server delivered the dinners immediately after appetizers, probably 3 minutes later-my boyfriend laughed! We also realized at this time our daughters fruit appetizer suggested by the waiter was forgotten. Did not want to mention it for fear of more waiting. My boyfriend said the food was good once it got there, miy meal wasn't too great though.  Side note, the table behind us was left dirty the entire duration of our visit. I understand stuff happens I used to work in a restaurant however it was not at all busy when we were there, we were one of only two tables seated in our area. Probably will not be giving any more chances for awhile, used to be one of my favorite places."
