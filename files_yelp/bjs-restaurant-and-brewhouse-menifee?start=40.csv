Anthony N.,"Fontana, CA",27,3,,1.0,10/21/2017,My friend didn't get her pasta but when she did it was cold causing her to lose her appetite!!!  All of our food was also cold but especially the pasta!
Kay O.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",183,24,4,5.0,9/27/2017,"Went in tonight with a party of 9 at 4:30pm and had amazing service the best we have ever had! This was the last shot for BJs as it's been so bad so many times. CHRISTOPHER was our guy, great service very attentive and helpful. We spoke to the manager and he told us  Christopher was new and that they are working on improving customer service at their location. Well all I have to say is he is a great hire from a fellow server. Thank you, we will be back and asking for him."
Joaquin N.,"Oceanside, CA",0,6,7,2.0,10/6/2017,Came out to have a family dinner. Our son was home from military training and decided BJ for dinner. Staff was friendly however the backroom (Cooks) were very slow. It took more than and hour to get a salads out and grill cheese. Spoke to the manager Calvin and he took good care of us. He was very polite and understanding. His response to the problem and how he attended us would be the only reason we would return. Maybe today was just a bad night.
Nelo G.,"Menifee, CA",113,9,,1.0,8/11/2017,"I hate this place worst service ever, went for my anniversary with my Wife. The wait was an hour and another hour just to get water we ended up leaving but this was the second time I had a similar experience at this exact location."
Charmaine T.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",60,17,3,2.0,9/30/2017,"I ordered takeout on a Friday night because the wait was 60-70 mins, and I ended up getting my food in 60 mins. I guess they have one person working that takeout booth, because she went in the back for an order, and 20 mins later she came back. No one at the desk offered to help, and when asked they said she was the only one.  She left for my order, and another guy came to pick up his salad, and it had been sitting there while she was talking to someone else. The other customer told me the service is always bad there but he likes the food, that's why he orders online. I'm done with them, in a place where there are so many other restaurants to chose, rather go to buffalo wild wings, they are on top of there takeout."
Ali G.,"Sun City, CA",27,17,3,1.0,8/28/2017,Must say food was great but as always service was next to kiss poor.... And I don't mean from the beer...... Service lacks at this location I don't know if it is poor employees poor management lack of management or who knows but 15 min. For a soda refill when establishment is only half full is unacceptable.   So yet again it will most likely be another six months or so before I bother seeing if they have their act together Sighhhhh
Michelle S.,"Hemet, CA",73,30,141,1.0,5/6/2017,"This is our final review for this location....Seriously this place has the worst service!! I think today was a final straw and the pizza was terrible, only reason I will be back is for a pizookie and it won't be the Menifee location. Pizza was overcooked and borderline burnt and dry and they replaced it and brought us our dessert before the new pizza and then we were too full to even eat it. I'm not one to expect compensation for their shitty service and food but did today and we got nada but a full bill with not even an apology. Wendy (according to receipt) in the bar area was slow and inattentive, may be a nice person but not good service and the manager, she even said something wasn't right and pizza shouldn't have looked that way. After she took it away she never even returned. We've tried on several occasions to give BJ's a chance after bad service here but this was last straw. We will try Temecula location instead from now on."
Crystal L.,"Menifee, CA",91,4,,5.0,10/9/2017,The service is always great at the bar area!!!! Love going here for date nights and have a drink or two with my love !!!!!! We always sit at the booths in the bar area!!!! Really comfy!!!!!
Stefanie E.,"Menifee, CA",0,24,3,2.0,2/17/2017,"I've had problems with this place since day one. The first time we visited was around opening. We got seated and waited 45 minutes for someone to even walk past our table. The only reason we got anything was because we went to the hostess and asked for a manager.  The most recent issue I had was the beginning of the month (February) I had a late notice birthday party and I called around 3p to see if I can set a reservation for 6-8 people. The man told me they don't do reservations for less than 7 people and that I'd need to call back 30 min before the time we'd be there. So I call back 45 minutes before we wanted to be there and the girl said they're booked up and for a party our size we'd have to do a reservation which is I thought I was doing.  Apparently the guy mixed up reservations and walk ins?  So now she's telling me they're booked for weeks and it's a Saturday night so it was packed and we're looking at a 2 hour wait.  I was so upset! We ended up going anyways,  that's what she really wanted, and Luckily birthday girl still had a good time. We ended up waiting almost the full time even though the Place was half empty.  I just remembered another time. We took my in-laws out to dinner and my sister-in-law's Burger was not fully cooked so my mother-in-law sent it back and when they brought the burger back out it was the same burger that she had already taken two bites of and they had just thrown it on the grill for a little bit longer. If I was at home I would not have a problem with something like that, but the fact that they did that in a restaurant makes me wonder how many other people's food they did that to after they've already put their mouths and their hands on it. I give them 2 stars because there has been an occasion or two we went with little to no problems and the food tasted pretty good"
Tricia B.,"SUN CITY, CA",7,21,,1.0,9/8/2017,"Usually have decent service here, but tonight it sucks.  The slowest service ever. Not really super busy and we've waited an hour for our food and on top of that every one in my party just got their food and come to find out our waitress ordered the wrong thing for me so I guess I'm not eating.  So crappie.  I've never had such horrible service here"
Derrick W.,"Menifee, CA",28,17,25,4.0,2/12/2017,"Watched the Super Bowl here. I ordered 3 burgers to take home to the family, and I wanted them all well done. Get home, all 3 burgers red and bleeding, had to re-cook them all. Not to happy, would have went back up there, but did not want to bother with it.   Thanks for reaching out to my family and I making our experience better."
Marco R.,"Sun City, CA",0,88,8,4.0,10/3/2017,Worthwhile place to eat especially late at night when other restaurants are closed. The ahi is delicious and their beer selection is great. Service can be a little slow sometimes but with the endless menu options it's still a repeat place for us.
Bailey B.,"Canyon Lake, CA",150,74,44,1.0,2/3/2017,"Very very unimpressed with this location. The server was nice but my food came out incorrect. (After an hour). We were informed that my brothers food was made incorrect so they were fixing it. My brother sat there for 20 minutes while we finished our meals and he still hadn't received his food. Just as the last person  finished their food, his came. 3 mistakes too many. I get it's a Friday night and the cooks are probably slammed but if it's going to take an hour, it better be right. Coming from a former cook myself."
Ashley Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",117,2,1,1.0,1/4/2017,Literally the SLOWEST service ever! It takes forever just to get your food. Even if you order a salad. What are they doing harvesting the lettuce????!!!! I've been to this location several times because my baby sister likes to come here and every time the service is the same
Angelica B.,"Murrieta, CA",58,84,30,1.0,7/26/2017,I wish I read the reviews before coming here . The food is down right disgusting. Not coming back . Oh yeah terrible service !
Jacob C.,"Murrieta, CA",125,9,,5.0,9/19/2017,Always my wife and I's go to when we want to go out for a drink. She loves their bloody Mary's and I LOVE their Hopstorm on draft!
Fetu D.,"La Mesa, CA",1,8,5,5.0,3/29/2017,"Our waiters Theresa and Mary were amazing, food was delicious and fast even and even got a free  pizookie just for coming in today so yay!!"
Mario H. A.,"Sun City, Sun City, CA",1,16,,1.0,9/17/2017,I tried this place and is not that good as the one in Temecula both in the food preparation and the customer service. I went there three times ( give it a chance) and there had been no improvement whatsoever. Thanks but no thanks.
B Z.,"Sun City, CA",1,23,11,2.0,1/10/2017,"Pizza wrong, no salt on margarita, cucumber in salad after allergy was explained, cheese on one meal after requested not be there, missed appetizer brought out with dinner only after asked where it was, and you forgot my daughters drink. All in one visit Now I remember why I never want to come there.  Get it together.  Your not the only restaurant in menifee, options to eat elsewhere are opening and I imagine I am not the only patron that is tired of the poor service at your location"
Joe D.,"Menifee, CA",0,4,,3.0,11/19/2017,Have gone here with family several times because we do enjoy the food - great menu with a variety of items.  My concern is the service - have had appetizers come after the main course - asked for drink refills which did not come and had to ask another server - grandson had an achievement certificate for a free meal which we mentioned in the beginning and before receiving the bill and needed to bring it up again after the bill came to get credit for it. Clean up the service and your scores will climb.
