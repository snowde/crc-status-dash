Darnell C.,"Wildomar, CA",0,14,,4.0,2/29/2016,"I prefer the temecula bj's but this one is good too. I think this place is not well lit, but whatever. The food is good. The same as temecula's. Look, it is a good cheap hang out spot. Im in my early 20's, and usually meet up with friends or my girlfriend over here. You get what you pay for"
LeAnn R.,"Murrieta, CA",0,28,2,1.0,11/9/2013,"MAJOR LET DOWN!!  I'm usually head over heels for the BJs brewery chain, however this particular one I won't ever be going back to, unless of course, they change management altogether.  My aunt and I went here and ordered the mahi mahi -- we both ordered exactly the same thing and got two entirely different dishes. Seriously? And when I told the server, she was gracious enough to bring me another bowl of rice- but is that the only fix to this? Management- bad call! Not to mention they must have been under staffed because we never got our drinks in a timely manner. (We waited 20 minutes for a champagne split and we were IN the bar when it was practically empty.)  Again, I went with my significant other and ordered pizza, the food was decent but we waited 30 minutes for our salad appetizers.  Not impressed. (We didn't order drinks- mostly because last time was a terrible wait.) At this point I was willing to give them another chance (as I've said, usually huge fan of the chain) but I've heard horror stories since my last visit! Apparently if you're with a party of five and you're seated, order food, and are patiently awaiting your meal - and a scheduled party of 20 walks in - you'll be eating burnt pizza, under cooked pizza, and you'll be expected to wait an hour and a half for it! Not to mention the manager will come to your table -- but don't expect an apology!  This store brings the BJs legacy to shame. Pazookis and root beer lovers deserve better!! The Temecula location, albeit a drive away, is worth it if you want decent service."
Robert R.,"Sun City, CA",37,231,2,3.0,12/29/2012,"Every time I go to a BJs, I see a common factor: slow service. I don't know why, even when they are not busy their service is slow. Also, half the time you have a custom request on your order, they don't get it right.  I like their beer and their ""guest"" beer selections. They have really good pizza, and I'm not one to be impressed with pizza very often. They have a great menu selection, even for those looking for healthier options. The quality of the food and beer keeps them at 3 stars....if they would improve their service, 4 stars."
Cory G.,"Murrieta, CA",3,147,8,1.0,9/15/2012,"I really wanted to like this location, as I am a big fan of BJ's (I gave the Temecula location 5 stars) but this BJ's felt like it was on the Moon it was so different.  This part isn't that big of a deal, but the waiters/waitresses were all very awkward. They seemed timid, didn't communicate very well (if at all), and just overall a very awkward feeling. I've never seen anything like it at any other restaurant I've ever been to before. It's not a big deal though, what BJ's really needs to get right is the food... Now the food...I had 3 different items and all 3 were terrible.  1) Mozzarella sticks - Appetizer - Now the mozzarella sticks were the best part of the meal, but unfortunately there was a black hair stuck in the cheese on mine. I don't have black hair. Other people have left reviews here that say they too had hair in their food, so with that in mind 1/5 stars. 2) ""Southern Fried Chicken"" - Entree - aka Country Fried Steak etc. - This was a lunch special, but I was expecting so much more. The piece of chicken was SMALL (I'm talking maybe 3-4 bites and that was it) and had very very little gravy on it. The mashed potatoes were bland, no flavor to them at all, The corn had no taste. This is the worst country fried steak I've ever had, and I've had most all of them (even from places like Denny's, which is sadly higher quality than BJ's). Very dissapointing, 1/5 stars 3) My wife got the Santa Fe salad, and since she is vegetarian had the chicken put on the side so I could eat it (which was nice, because I was still hungry after finishing my tiny entree). The piece of chicken was way overcooked, I'm talking as hard as a brick. I could barely saw through it with a knife. It was a jawbreaker, and it was extremely salty. Not to mention it was small, probably about 3 inches long by 1 inch wide and very thin. That was it. Small, overcooked, salty piece of chicken. Sad, at the point of being pathetic. 1/5 stars. Everything across the board was just bad, and coupled with awkward service made it a strange experience that I don't plan on ever having again. I've gone to the BJ's in Temecula about 15 times, and it is a 5 star experience. I don't know how this location could have turned out so badly. Oh well, I have enough money on my BJ's premium card now to get a free pizookie, which I will be gladly enjoying at the Temecula location."
Tara C.,"Sun City, CA",7,27,1,2.0,11/25/2014,"Food was ok, I ordered mahi mahi with a baked potato and asparagus. My ""loaded"" baked potato only had melted cheese and my mahi mahi was really dry. Service was also quite poor. It took over an hour to get everyone at our table silverware and pretty much everyone had an issue with their food being too dry. We also had to ask for potato fixings three times before they were received."
Jason W.,"Chicago, IL",489,251,67,4.0,9/28/2012,"Came here for happy hour, and I must say I am thouroughly impressed. I didn't know that BJ's had a happy hour, but I'm glad that I found it. Beers are on sale and the personal sized pizzas are cheap too (I think half off, I forgot). Appetizers are also half off (select ones though not all of them) and their AWESOME beer is cheaper too...yes I mentioned the beer twice. Get the stout, my favorite. On a side note....I love their cheese sticks here. I know it's a simple item to make, but for some reason I really like the way they do it here. Just the right crispness, not too thick, and shredded cheese on top."
Julie P.,"Orlando, FL",9,6,4,1.0,12/12/2014,"Good food, horrible service. I'll take my money elsewhere. Place not busy at all. 15 minutes just to get a drink order. She finally took our order, it came out quick. She dropped it off and never once came back except to give us our check. 12 servers walked by and didn't even acknowledge us. Thanks but no thanks."
Mr. A.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",3,28,71,4.0,8/25/2012,"Went in for dinner tonight and sat at the bar. Huge crowds waiting outside yet there were 5-6 open seats at the bar.  I walked right up to the bar and grabbed a seat.  I enjoyed several of their house beers, they were all excellent. The beer was served quickly, in an ice cold glass.  For dinner, I had their spaghetti with meat sauce which was terrific.  My food came out quickly and was served hot (fresh).  The pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauce was very good.   I for one am happy there is a BJ's in Menifee.  The staff was very friendly, their bar TV is huge, and they have a nice variety of good beers.  When I was walking out I noticed that the new Panera has a drive through, sweet.  This plaza keeps getting better and any new restaurant in town is a plus to me.  Check it out after the hype/crowds die down, or go on a weeknight if you are a complainer.  This place is great, give them a try and remember they just opened last week."
Chris W.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",46,238,480,1.0,12/31/2012,"The one star is for this visit.  Usually I would rate BJs a 4, but the service we got was just so damn bad.  Half the table was done with their meal before the other half got served.  Long wait time for drinks etc; the pooched up a Grey Goose request; the waitress was pretty lost; and the manager struggled with service recovery.  If this had been our first time at a BJs, it probably would be our last.  When the service is this crap, it doesn't matter how good the food was.  Good thing we know how much better it can be."
Karen E.,"Orange, CA",162,98,13,2.0,11/14/2012,"We were a party of 12 with reservations, and we were there on a Monday at noon.  There were good and bad things about our recent trip to BJs.  I'll start with what was wrong.  The service was really slow and chaotic.  The servers clearly did NOT have a system for anything.  Food arrived that we didn't order, and food that we DID order took forever.  Some people in our party had finished their food before others ever got theirs.  Our checks were all goofed up and it took 2-1/2 hours to get out of there.  Coffee was served without spoons and we had to ask repeatedly for spoons, water, refills of beverages, to have the blinds lowered (because the glare was incredible!). Now the good stuff:  The food was pretty delicious.  I really enjoyed what I had (the chicken marsala) in spite of the fact that the fettuccini was hard.  The sauce was delicious, the chicken was moist, the green beans were tasty, and there was plenty of food.  Everyone enjoyed their food, pretty much, although there were a couple of things that were not prepared as requested.   The manager comped us dessert to make up for some of the issues.  Pizookie is our friend. I wouldn't go there with a crowd again, because I just don't think they were prepared to deal with a party of 12, but I would go again with a smaller party."
Tammy L.,"Temecula, CA",0,3,,1.0,8/4/2014,"Two words for management, ""YOUR FIRED!"" Put an add on Craigslist in order to staff your kitchen then bring in trainers from other restaurants to retrain everyone from top to bottom!!!"
Katie C.,"Mira Loma, CA",0,22,4,1.0,7/3/2014,"We waited 5 minutes after we arrived for someone to bring us menus, we finally asked for them. It took 20 minutes to get our food (appetizers). We never got water refills, waited for 15 minutes to pay out check. We gave it another chance, no more. The service here is so poor and management does nothing to improve it!"
Jason N.,"Temecula, CA",0,4,,1.0,2/4/2014,"My wife and I have given this BJ's several chances. Each time we come it takes them roughly 10 minutes just to get a waitress over to get us a drink (all I want is water haha).  I have them one final chance taking my sister to lunch today. We were sat down and 15 mins roll by with no server or waters. I asked the hostess if we could order some drinks, and she replies ""no one has served you yet?"", ""nope"" I said. ""Alright"" I thought, ""finally going to get some food and drink"". Not surprising my sister and I sat there for another 5 minutes with nothing. Walked out hungry with 20 mins of our time wasted. And as we left the hostess just stared at us with a confused look on her face. Don't waste your time."
Nikole V.,"Winchester, CA",6,28,10,2.0,11/25/2014,Service was good. However the food came out cold despite there being about five tables with people in them. Taste was okay. I wouldn't recommend coming and I don't plan returning.
Jerry H.,"Grass Valley, CA",17,57,,1.0,11/22/2014,"I rarely write a very critical review, but BJ's rates a lowly 1 star.  The service was slow. My fish had all of it's juices drained out of it. When I finally got the waitress's attention I asked for some sauces to make the fish edible. After some wait she showed up with some sauces. They didn't help. I did something I've never done in a restaurant. I told her to take the fish back and delete the charge from my bill.  To his credit the manager came over and apologized. He said he had sampled my fish and that I was right. The fish was overcooked. He offered to compensate with something else, but by then the rest of my party was almost finished with their meals. My wife had the fried chicken. The portion was small. The best part was the mashed potatoes and gravy. I will never go to a BJ's."
Mike D.,"Temecula, CA",2,82,2,5.0,7/25/2015,"Tonight while having a very good dinner at BJ's I witnessed something I need to share.  A little boy was having a party, but this wasn't an ordinary party as I saw some Make a Wish volunteers there as well.  This little boy was having a wish party and Make a Wish was granting his wish.  The entire staff of BJ's made this boy and his family feel special.  They sang for him and treated the table with respect and dignity.  I then found out after digging that BJ's did this all for free, they donated the event.  This is the kind of establishment I will patronize and although I wasn't involved in this event it truly touched me that a business would do this.  I will be back because of this and from a bystander thank you!"
Lexi O.,"Sun City, CA",87,114,9,5.0,9/8/2012,"Love it! Everything was great. I'm reading through these reviews that people are leaving, and I'm annoyed. People, they just opened two weeks ago! Give them a freakin' break. They're working out a few bugs to get things going smooth, as with any restaurant. Oy. Back to the goods. Nice atmosphere, incredibly attentive waitstaff and the bartenders are generous and oh-so-good at mixing drinks. You must try the beer sampler. Just do it. Their ribs are surprisingly comparable to those offered at Texas Roadhouse, with BJ's taking the win. I say BRAVO, being that BJ's doesn't offer them as their ""specialty"".  We'll be back, and we can't wait to try something new."
Joseph R.,"Murrieta, CA",1,20,1,3.0,1/5/2014,"I came here with a group of 10 and we received terrible service. They were out of something and their calamari ""was still frozen would we like to wait for it to defrost?"" There was one server on the floor for the entire restaurant at like 5 pm. We got super close to leaving because our food came out super scattered. Some of us had to wait 45 minutes for our food after others of us initially got our food. I've been here 2 other times and the service was good one time out of my experiences. But I love their pizookis so much though!"
Michael P.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,7,,2.0,1/1/2014,"First off.....I think it is funny that MOST 4-5* Rating"" YELP REVIEWS from this location are submitted by its OWN EMPLOYEES!   I know because my former roommate is employed by BJs!!!! I recently went to Dinner at this location with my wife. We decided to use the ""Call Ahead"" since we ran an unexpected errand that put us a little behind on dinner plans. They stated it was a 40 min wait!?!?! Ok no big deal as we would have a drink at the bar prior to getting our table.  We got our table about 10 min earlier than quoted which was good news....we were both starving! We decided to order the avocado eggrolls as an appetizer which came out fairly quick. We ordered a pizza to share. The pizza was a disappointment to say the least. There was almost no sauce. The first piece we both cut out the pan was dry and Un edible!  I decided to speak with a manager since we waited 25 mins for our meal that was unsatisfactory.   The manager on duty was more than helpful and advised us he would take care of thr pizza for us and explained they use very little sauce. However,  I have been to BJs numerous times and never remember a pizza coming out this way.  This is the 2nd time I have visited this location since its the closest to home. The service has always been subpar and the wait is not the worth it to get food that has disappointed both times.  Its a shame that their signature item can't come out of their kitchen right!"
Apple J.,"Murrieta, CA",0,4,,1.0,7/12/2015,"My family and me was going in for a nice dinner... To start with it took a long time for somebody to even help our table, once our server came to take  our drinks he was very unfriendly and continued to be that way the entire time.... Drinks took forever to come out, also the food was just basic no biggie. Also we were sitting at our table waiting for refills for about a good 10 minutes and our server mark was just standing over by the bar and just watching the basketball game. SO UNPROFESSIONAL. Everything took a long time with him and I could tell he was just lazy, they weren't even busy. Everytime he came to the table he was just very unfriendly. Then we ordered dessert and that took a while. Our server mark couldn't even bring it out because he was just standing by the bar ONCE AGAIN! Overall not very good server and experience there"
