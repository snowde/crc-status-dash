Gretchen L.,"Menifee, CA",0,5,,4.0,1/3/2016,The ladies and I love B J's for lunch. The clam chowder is super. The service is good and the waitress was so sweet.
Maricela S.,"Sun City, CA",0,2,,1.0,1/2/2016,"I'm not sure if it is just this location, but it seems like they don't make the food like they used to. My potato skins were so hard and oily that I had to send them back. My Chicken Alfredo was barely warm. It probably sat for a while before it was brought out to my table. The flavor was different as well and not in a good way. My server had a good attitude but it was obvious that she had a lot going on because I never got a Coke refill and neither did my kids. I had to ask for water and then she asked if my kids needed refills but by then they were done eating. What surprised me the most was that even the pizookie tasted weird. Definitely never coming back. By the way, please make sure that your hosts don't take their guests to their table until the bussers are done cleaning it. We had to stand there and wait because our table wasn't ready. Very unacceptable."
Francine R.,"Murrieta, CA",1,2,,1.0,12/28/2015,"Lousy over seasoned jambalaya, warm pizza and a waitress with an attitude. She appeared annoyed when asked about salad selections....salad folks! Need i say more."
Mike A.,"Sun City, CA",54,80,12,2.0,5/25/2014,"We were actually pretty stoked at first to find out that our hometown was getting a BJs and an alternative to the ""bleh"" Beer Hunter.  Then it opened.  First time, hey, it happens.  Second time, well, still new and getting the hang of it.  Third, fourth, fifth, sixth...  3 years later and this place STILL has HORRIFIC service... EVERY time.  Once we had a good bartender.  Outside of that everyone who works here desperately wants to be somewhere else.  It never seems like there is a manager around.  Maybe they don't want anybody to know they're a manager?  You have to wait forever.  Drink refills?  Forget it.  Silverware?  Good luck.  Food?  Ok and getting worse.  Most BJs used to have pretty good food.  It is really a shame because I love the décor and in-house brew."
Luis P.,"Temecula, CA",8,252,20,2.0,7/17/2015,"Bj's from the moment you enter their restaurant is on the impressive side. One can tell right away that this chain spends money in their looks. Visited the one in Menifee, since we recently moved there, and expected a very nice time and food. Not to be at all. The place was 40% full, but for our table of 5 it took so long to get things started, it seemed like we were in a very crowded restaurant. Each thing we tried to order, starting with appetizers, later with main dishes, as well as beer, coffee and drinks, took a very long time. BJ's is known for their Chicago style Pizza. One could assume, incorrectly, that by now they have the preparation method, amounts and temperature down to a science. After all, it does not take a lot of skill to make a pizza from scratch, specially if recipes has been passed down from corporate headquarters.  We had appetizers, all average, like Avocado Egg Rolls, Chicken Wings, Sliders, each priced for high enough numbers to merit skillful preparation. They took their very sweet time, and the coffee besides being lukewarm did not return for at least 45 minutes. Pizzas were the biggest fiasco. Arrived lukewarm, with such a careless preparation, that frankly, I felt like pushing my way into the kitchen to try and help them out. How can a place that is known for their pizza, send to the table such a dismal failure. Service by a very pretty waitress was way below what was needed, long intervals left looking at each other, should we just walk out the same way we came in?  Not one thing in BJ's was done with quality and taste, big investment, poor execution. Payed over $80 plus gratuity. This place needs to be put in its place, lukewarm pizza? 2 Stars."
Sarina F.,"Murrieta, CA",130,17,,1.0,2/21/2014,"Horrible service. Didn't get waited on for about 20 minutes after sitting, and our food arrived after being here around 45 minutes. We had no silverware, and any request we had took way too long for the wait staff to follow thru. The food was mediocre at best. The spaghetti had very little sauce and the pizza was just not very good....too cheesy, cheese not thoroughly melted, hand tossed crust was really doughy. Our server was very nice just not attentive. Do not think we will return."
Murrieta G.,"Murrieta, CA",0,65,,2.0,10/7/2015,"I'm just not a big fan.  They're always very crowded in the restaurant and the bar, and they don't seem to care whether I'm seated, fed, or comfortable.  But go here if you want to feel like cattle being herded through a mediocre cafeteria."
Mariesol R.,"Menifee, CA",7,7,,4.0,5/11/2014,"My husband, mom, and 5 girls went for Mothers Day, took longer then the 45 minutes they had said ""that was upsetting, I rather they say the wait was an hour and a half. Then I would have known what to expect. After being seated near a door to the patio that kept opening, they quickly moved us after asking :). Our server was Leanne UMMM she was GREAT, she was so pleasant. kept our drinks full and service was outstanding. I don't know if she is a mother or not but before we left I thanked her for working on Mothers Day, she was very thankful for that simple comment. Her reaction of a loving smile and thank you back made the almost 2 hour wait all worth it. Would love to have her as my server every time I visit this restaurant."
Rebecca C.,"Menifee, CA",103,15,1,2.0,12/5/2014,"I love BJ's and was very excited for this restaurant to open close to my house. I have given it many chances and it always seems to disappoint. The staff isn't very friendly, and the food never seems to be as good as other BJ's. Service is slow and the servers don't seem to be very knowledgeable of the money. I have food allergies and it is very important for me to be aware of these. I asked questions that never got an answer and ended up ordering something I could not eat. Very disappointed."
Jacquie B.,"McKinney, TX",14,4,,4.0,12/2/2014,I had clam chowder and a half of a sandwich and both were delicious my husband had cheese bacon cheeseburger and loved it everything was great!
Brooke F.,"Conway, AR",1,55,21,5.0,1/21/2015,Decided to go to Bjs last night for a late dinner. Trista was our sever and she was great! Kept our drinks full and had good recommendations . Overall wonderful service. I had the thyme lemon chicken. Delicious! It's also a healthier choice which is a plus.
Jonas W.,"Murrieta, CA",52,90,,1.0,7/14/2014,"This place is simply a BJ's. Service is the worst we have experienced at a large restaurant. We brought in a coupon from the BJ's home page online and the server refused to accept it. We asked to see the manager and show her on their homepage the coupon deal was being advertised and our waitress came back and says ""My manager is busy at the moment but says that she has not seen that deal and will not approve of us accepting them. We walked out and left. How could they not accept a coupon from their home page and how could the manger be too busy to come see us? That is rude and even with limited selections of restaurants in Menifee and this being the place we have most of our family get togethers, we will not be eating here anymore."
Connie B.,"Riverside, CA",1,8,1,5.0,5/9/2013,"We had a large party to celebrate our anniversary and were considering BJ's in Menifee.  After reading the reviews, we were a little concerned and called to speak with the manager.  Shelby answered the phone and was very forthcoming  about the ""slow start"" they experienced when they opened, but ensured us that they have worked hard to ""turn things around"" and encouraged us to come in.  My husband, still not convinced, spoke to Jessica, and cautiously made reservations. Still a little nervous that our night would end badly, we were pleasantly surprised by our waitress, Bree.  She was friendly, prompt and accommodating.  She worked hard to make sure everyone had what they needed and the food was very good!  We enjoyed our meal, the guys got to keep an eye on the hockey game and we all had a great time!"
Carol G.,"Menifee, CA",26,50,,5.0,7/31/2015,"Not sure why this place rates so low. Food, beer and service have always been outstanding every time we've been here. Try the shrimp tacos. One of my favorites!"
Victoria U.,"Quail Valley, CA",79,5,,2.0,11/12/2014,"This BJ's was great when they FIRST opened. However, as of recently, they have just been getting worse & worse. I feel so bad for the waiters. Obviously, this is one of the only restaurants in the area, so they are super busy. But whoever is running the restaurant clearly doesn't take in to account how busy they are. So the waiters are running around & working really hard. (So, I'll give them that). But I've eaten here quite a bit. Every time my food is late, cold and I'm usually grumpy about the service so I don't enjoy it. Whoever is running this restaurant seriously needs to hire more waiters. I won't go back here anymore because I'm tired of cold food & late service. Disappointing."
Kim H.,"Wildomar, CA",3,19,2,1.0,7/3/2014,"Ok, where to start... I have eaten here numerous time, sometimes its good, sometimes its okay, other times it sucks. Its never been great. Most of the time my brothers and I eat in the bar, they let kids sit in the bar which is beyond annoying We sit in the bars to get away from kids in restaurant, screaming kids, fighting with their parents, then throwing things, and making messes... children shouldn't sit in bars. One day we sat in the bar and had to find someone to clean off the tables for us, it took over 10 minutes. Next our waitress refused to remove old glassware, and plates; as it ""wasn't her job"". She actually moved our dirty plates and glasses a few inches to set down our meals. We sat there and ate our meals with all our other dirty dishes on our table our waitress said she would ""get someone to move them for us"". No one ever came.  The next time we ate there was for our cousins birthday. Our appetizer came out n decent timing fallowed by our salads. Then we waited over an hour for our meals. when they finally came the blood on the plate with the stake on it was dried from sitting under the heat lamps: as more of the food came out it all had that problem. Each dish came as least 10 minutes apart. We asked to talk to someone about the problems; 25 minutes later a ""manager in training"" came to our table, she said that all our food would be remade. In the 30 minutes of our crappy food coming out, one of the plates never made it. when the remade food came out it was ok-ish. My chicken wasn't cooked all the way. The missing plate from before came out maybe 10 minute later. We were offered a dessert after waiting 35 minutes for it we left. They did comp our whole ticket. They said they were under staffed, but it was the week on fathers day and graduations... they should have known to have more staff. Not sure if I will try them again. YOU'VE BEEN WARNED"
Roseann J.,"Sun City, CA",10,29,7,1.0,2/15/2015,"One would think we would learn. Visited twice in the last 3 months. First time in Dec, took at least 20 minutes to get drinks, another 10 or so to have our order taken. One person in our party ordered a steak medium/well. Once he cut into it, blood all over the plate. They did take his whole plate back, cooked the stake a bit longer, still pink, and brought back on the same plate with blood still on potatoes and veggies...was over it at that point. Then 2 weeks ago did curb side pick up....got home and no flatware to use, not french fries with the burger that was ordered. Just don't understand. Mistakes happen, but every time?????"
Peggy R.,"Murrieta, CA",21,48,1,3.0,3/12/2014,Beer is very good and reasonable. I like the blond.  Ribs are very very tasty but overall the place is pretty expensive. Be prepared for a large bill if you eat there.Pizza is well above average.
Steve D.,"Lomita, CA",83,19,33,5.0,3/30/2014,Great variety of dish's. I had there new dish of fried chicken. Two boneless breasts with fried batter. Mash potatoes were great and steam mixed vegetables. Wife had BLT. She loved it. Dad enjoyed pulled pork sandwich. So big hard to eat it all. Wife's mom had the turkey burger and loved it. I also enjoy the house Blond beer. We were able to keep up on sports with all large TVs. Service was great.
Andrew F.,"Perris, CA",4,24,2,4.0,6/26/2014,"After posting my last review, human resources reached out and asked me give the store another try in a few months and I did. I have to say it was a great experience, much different then my last. Our waitress was attentive and our food came out in good time. As always, the food was great and the atmosphere relaxing. This location has definitely improved from my last visit. Give them a second try!"
