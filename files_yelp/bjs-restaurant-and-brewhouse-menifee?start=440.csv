Kat I.,"Fort Worth, TX",120,59,7,1.0,6/9/2014,Cajun pasta? More like pizza pasta. The only thing tasty was the water. My waitress was nice though.
Darrin C.,"Menifee, CA",0,4,1,2.0,10/30/2014,Food was up to par but as far as the service it was not met to my expectations... Sorry to say I waited at least thirty minutes for my drink order and it was a constant wait from there on out...
Juliann W.,"Las Vegas, NV",37,80,30,1.0,2/16/2014,My nephew sat on a sharp piece of glass in the booth seat which caused bleeding and the manager did nothing but say sorry and we are welcome to sit somewhere else. I was so disappointed. We've been here for two hours so its a little slow although the waitress was good.  The drinks and food were good. All in all.... okay but the fact that the manager did nothing about the broken glass and it punching my nephew's rear really upset the whole family.
Taylor W.,"Murrieta, CA",51,7,1,1.0,10/19/2015,"This place is so unsatisfying, the service is so terrible with all these waiters and waitresses that have zero customer service/personal skills. Never ask if you need anything else check on the table ask if you'd like another drink unless it's alcohol so they can make more money on you. So disappointed and what's sad is I always give it another chance and they fall even shorter then before. I'm not picky and I'm not usually a jerk but all I ask is for courteous service and this place falls far from that. Will not be spending my hard earned my I worked for at this location ever again."
M C.,"Wildomar, CA",121,2,,4.0,4/25/2015,"Hostess (Holly, I think) was very sweet and kind to my two rambunctious boys.  helped get us seated quickly and made sure to tell the server that we were on limited time.  Food was good, but nothing special."
Maria S.,"Perris, CA",5,4,6,4.0,12/16/2012,"The food was delicious, the beer was amazing. Service at the front was terrible girl was very rude but the waitress was really nice. We did have to wait 40 min for a table."
"Marie, C.","Menifee, CA",0,12,,5.0,10/6/2015,Clam chowder is really good. It's great having a BJ'S  in Menifee. My mom and her friends always enjoy the lunch meals.
Alfonso P.,"Garden Grove, CA",0,2,,1.0,10/4/2015,"Bad kitchen. Trash talk among staff in the parking lot. Management said she was new, and there is evidence of a lack of communication between the kitchen and the servers. There doesn't seem to be a pride in the food, from the management or kitchen, at this particular location. That's a shame because i just moved to the area recently. I've had some good experiences at other BJs restaurants. Unfortunately, this one looks like a BJs but operates with lower standards and care than a tavern owned by two distant cousins whom inherited the place in a will and just want to sell it.  My date and i ordered a couple of drinks before our food showed up, which were nicely made. The appetizer was calamari.(cold, but ignored. It was just for me and my date was having a good time. I didn't want to divert good vibe.) My date had a salad with the salmon and qinoa. I ordered a large pizza, and they brought me a small and a medium that were hastely cut and prepared.  A new person brought them from the kitchen with an attitude, and said ""we're all out of large pizzas."" I laughed and asked if she was out of the pans, thinking a little open mindedly still.  She explained that their pre-prepaired dough for larges are all out, so they put the toppings on those two crusts. Which, looked like exactly what they did. Because the medium had more cheese and toppings than the small BY FAR. In fact, i took a couple of slices out when the manager came to question me and one slice was wet dough without even much cheese, and none of the toppings. I ate none of it. They were adamant on making the argument that they basically gave me more pounds of pizza. I told them that they underestimated the physics of a large pizza in contrast to a small. It cooks differently, and the product that they brought to me was not what i wanted. The ratio of dough to any other ingredient, was obvious on the small. Zero pride in the product of their kitchen. I paid for our drinks and everything else that we ordered in those 15 minutes. We took my dates salmon to go, and went somewhere else to enjoy our night."
Elin S.,"Perris, CA",0,5,,5.0,10/3/2015,Good food - bar is a little slow and it's a bit too noisy not set up for large parties - tries too hard to impress the 20 somethings.
Melissa N.,"San Antonio, TX",6,15,,1.0,2/19/2014,"Extremely bad service and lack of a sense of urgency. Do not consider this a BJ restaurant in any aspect. Management is the worse that I've ever witnessed, and I've been to countless non chained restaurants before. Food was forgotten, drinks were never refilled, manager was unemotional towards any problem. I rather eat at McDonald's. Save your money and go to Temecula BJ's. They actually know what they're doing."
Miz.Jackie A.,"Menifee, CA",13,45,62,4.0,1/7/2014,I love BJ's happy hour during the games they offer all there house beers at $3.50 and Thursdays is even cheaper. Appetizers are small portions but they are a tasty munchie. Very young Enthusiastic bar tenders service with class.
Josh B.,"Menifee, CA",0,16,,5.0,9/13/2015,"Good place to eat, can't go wrong with the wings! Good beer. Nothing to write home about. Good wings, decent beer. No complaints. Wife likes it, so we're good to go."
Frank C.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",227,32,4,3.0,5/21/2014,Food was cold stuffed in a corner four seats for five person table hamburger was burnt service was slow had empty plate sitting in front of me for 10 minutes
Kris M.,"San Jacinto, CA",55,10,1,5.0,6/21/2015,Love the food and can't wait to come back again! The Mediterranean chicken pita tacos are my favorite!
Paul Jessica S.,"Sun City, CA",44,1,1,1.0,5/10/2014,The worst service I have ever experienced in my life. The only reason I give one star is because the food was decent once I got it.
Josephine O.,"Sun City, CA",10,11,9,1.0,12/9/2013,"Horrible service. Our waitress (wearing a white bandana, short hair and glasses) took our order wrong, forgot to bring us what we asked for, and never came back to check on us. Our food came out wrong 3 times. We just ordered burgers with cheese and bacon, no tomatoes and no pickles. Not that difficult. The manager was nice and took the food off our bill. Our waitress did stop by our table again to blame the cooks in the back. Then left and never came back. I'm still sitting here waiting after an hour and a half. No bill, no service...maybe I should just get up and leave without paying for the drinks. I did notice that her other tables were receiving the wrong plates that didn't belong to them and one of her customers asked for sour cream 10 minutes ago for her baked potato...no sour cream. I'm never coming here ever again. This service sucks. We have been completely ignored"
M G.,"Sun City, CA",1,22,6,1.0,9/7/2013,"Don't believe the hype.....Don't fall for the new tvs, the decor, and the glitz.  This is the 4th time I've been let down. All I want is a cold beer, food that is served with a smile, and the food that is showed on the menu.  I'm leaving and going to beer hunter."
Andrea M.,"Hemet, CA",23,237,19,4.0,3/3/2014,The staff here seems to be getting better the longer it is open. Pizza and beer is all I get here. I love the jeremiah red
Kevin G.,"Menifee, CA",107,12,2,2.0,3/31/2014,"Ordered two pizzas when I got back home i realized they didn't put any cheese on my pizza. I had to drive back to inform them of there mistake while my other pizza became cold. They didn't offer me anything for my inconvenience, simply made a poor joke out of the ""no cheese"" which I did not find humorous."
Richard G.,"Menifee, CA",41,68,,1.0,12/20/2013,"Why can't I get a decent meal at this restaurant.  I love BJ's and have eaten a many different locations without a problem.  Every time I decide to go back to the Menifee location I regret it.  Horrible service, indifferent management, cold food, slow service.  Complained once and got a gift card - and had another horrible experience when we used it.  I guess when I want to eat at BJ's I'll have to make the drive to Temecula or Corona where I can get a decent meal with decent service.  Sorry Menifee BJ's, I like to go local but you have driven me away - after four visits you still can't get it right - you have run out of second chances."
