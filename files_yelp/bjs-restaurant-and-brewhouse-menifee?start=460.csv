Charlie C.,"Burbank, CA",3,432,,2.0,12/27/2014,"Nice looking place, with lots of room and lots of TVs. Waiters and waitresses were nice, but our service for dinner on the Friday after Christmas, though we understood why it was packed, was not the greatest.   And my food left a lot to be desired. If you go here, either go during the week or early on a weekend night.  It gets very crowded on the weekend and you will be lucky to make it into the parking lot off of Haun. Just way too crowded.  Luckily, we were early and hit a good light and made it in in relatively good time. Be patient. Four of us were seated. We ended up being served by at least three people.  And the young guy who's name was on the receipt at the end wasn't even the one that was presented to us at the start. He came at the end.  I hope he split the tip.  In fact, he never did introduce himself. Now, they were all nice, but we would have preferred one server. Our parent's wine took 20 minutes to be delivered. Our waitress said the bar always gets backed up.  Bad excuse. Alcohol is where restaurants make their biggest profits; excuses are unacceptable. I ordered the Hawaiian Mahi Mahi. Waitress said all the fish was excellent. Apparently someone forgot to tell the chef.  Way too dry, I needed a drink everytime I took a bite.  And way too many onions in the bed of rice pilaf that supported the fish. I would have chosen some pasta, but the menu was devoid of many options. The others liked their food, though nobody thought anything was excellent.  Best part of my meal was the double chocolate ice cream scoops.  The only reason we went here was because all of the good Italian restaurants in town were closed. It will probably be a while before I return here."
Patrick E.,"Temecula, CA",0,2,,1.0,8/2/2015,They have really cheapest out on their salads. The Cobb is ridiculous. They keep saying they're out of eggs. Really?  Get your act together.!!
Edward F.,"Sunnyside, Queens, NY",0,6,,2.0,8/1/2015,"I've mostly had good dining experiences at BJs restaurants but the food at this location is under par. The wedge salad, a favorite of mine, looked like they dropped the plate and threw it back on (presentation?). The iceberg lettuce didn't taste fresh. On to the meal. The burger I ordered (BBQ brisket) was ordered medium and came out welllll done. It's a burger! C'mon. Kitchen needs to get their act together. Where's Gordon Ramsay??!!"
Scott E.,"Menifee, CA",0,10,,4.0,11/3/2013,"The sevice, food, atmosphere & price makes this a repeat. Well worth it. Excellent beer choices."
Reanna R.,"Palm Springs, CA",34,188,81,4.0,10/13/2013,Went for dinner on a Sunday night.  Place was really dead.  Love the bruschetta small plate.  I had to order two!  The stuffed mushrooms aren't too bad.  I love BJ's and this location is fairly new and the service was good.  The only thing I didn't like was our waitresses weren't good about refilling our drinks.  They didn't refill them once.  We had two waitresses and even though I put both glasses on the edge of the table they never paid any attention to them.
Diana Q.,"Hemet, CA",6,27,24,1.0,11/30/2013,Horrible service this place is a joke. If you check my yelp reviews I have never rated a place this bad.
Maria S.,"Fontana, CA",16,3,,1.0,7/18/2015,"The food was good.. I was not impressed with the service. Not good at all. The hostess was not friendly, our server ok but had to ask for utensils.. Left on break and didn't say any thing. On the way out the hostess and other servers were just talking. Didn't bother to acknowledge as we left. Don't plan on coming back."
Shelby C.,"Santa Ana, CA",5,63,2,5.0,9/8/2013,I always have a great time here with girlfriends for dinner. I have never had a problem!:) & they have great food!
Sarah G.,"Mineola, TX",31,68,109,1.0,2/2/2014,"Service is hit and miss but 9/10 it's a miss. Once took 10 minutes to get drinks, 12 minutes to order our food.  I ordered a calzone and had to send it back twice, second time it was COLD in the middle.  Asked to speak to the manager, they never came to our table but they did comp the calzone. Food quality less than poor. Service fair. Price for what you get is atrocious."
Scott H.,"Murrieta, CA",54,9,,2.0,6/7/2013,"I keep going here thinking they get their issues worked out but very time is worse.   Food is good.  Typical BJ's food that you'd get at any chain.   Where this place falls way short is service.  On the rare occasion that your seated in an appropriate amount of time (regardless if restaurant is empty or not) it is going to take forever to get food.  I'll just talk about my last experience, which has been typical.  We arrived at 7:00 with a party of 7 and expected a wait.  We all sat outside waiting on our table.  After 45 minutes my wife went to ask how much longer and we were told ten minutes.  We all went inside and realized half the restaurant was empty.  They just didn't want to put tables together.  Finally after asking about the gigantic empty space the put two,tables together and we sat down.  The waitress came and took our drink order.  4 beers, 2 waters, and a gin and tonic.  It took 15 minutes to get our drinks.  We finally ordered 10 minutes later and waited another hour for our food which was full of numerous mistakes.  this meal overall took over 3 hours.   The manager needs to be fired or learn how to staff a restaurant because this has been my consistent experience now like 6 times.  Next time ill drive the extra 5 minutes to Temecula. Updated: service is slightly better but only because a handful of good waitresses are taking tables that slackers are ignoring."
J P.,"Menifee, CA",0,7,1,1.0,12/7/2013,"We told 30-40 wait ( for 2 people) waited over an hour to be seated. Sat down waited about 10 minutes for our server. Took our drink order and did not have my beer selection, even though I asked ahead of time , server asked if I would like a different choice I made a selection and she said she'd bring me a sample, this took 25 minutes, had a ask another employee for flatware and napkins. Pizza arrived before appetizers ; appetizers arrived Luke warm sent them back, server took back and said manager would come over and talk with us; never did! Order a chocolate pazookie; a chocolate chip pazookie arrive with vanilla ice cream, server finally brought correct order 20 minutes later. Not a good experience, food OK service was terrible, I would think twice before going here, choose Beer Hunter or a Roadhouse or even Red Robin."
Travis H.,"Fontana, CA",6,3,,2.0,5/5/2014,"Horrible service. We received the wrong food and then when the correct food came out it was cold. We joked about not coming back but after seeing other reviews it wasn't just ""that day""!"
Jessica M.,"Mission Valley West, CA",18,69,32,2.0,2/4/2014,Food is great but service sucks.  Keep coming back hoping service will get better but after two years still no improvement.  Our bills were messed up and we felt ignored for most of our visit.
Mathew W.,"Fullerton, CA",41,21,6,1.0,5/2/2013,"I went with my friend, his wife, two sons, and daughter in law on a weekday night.  There was ""ONLY"" six of us (not some huge party).  The place was pretty much dead inside.  BUT, for some reason it took for ever to get served.  Then when we finally got our food (which I could have cooked it faster) we had no silverware.  The waitress literally came to are table maybe two three times the whole night.  We were there for hours just trying to eat.  The bus boy had to start helping us cause he saw what was going on.  I talked with the manager on duty.  She was very helpful.  The problem was I think the waitress caught on and never even can to collect my credit card.  I paid cash and walkout.  That waitress was the WORST EVER, really!"
Monica T.,"Sun City, CA",0,8,,5.0,6/26/2015,You can go wrong with Bjs happy hour!!! Eggs rolls are great! Pizza even more amazing! If you haven't had a cider you need to try one its delicious!
Lisa C.,"Riverside, CA",39,17,3,3.0,1/21/2014,Food is always great but service is hit or miss. Items missing from order or the appetizer coming out after the meal. This is for sure one place to do not go to for the service. I will return again for the pulled pork sandwich!
Pat B.,"Murrieta, CA",0,33,5,5.0,4/27/2013,"Hey Negative Nancy's!! You people cry because there is nothing in Menifee and when we FINALLY do get something you complain about it! Pizza is good, beer is good and the pozooki is amazing!"
Ariel R.,"Brea, CA",24,2,,4.0,6/11/2015,"Went here and ordered just a steak done medium well. Our waitress was polite, prompt and over all amazing. When our food Finally arrived, I noticed my steak was over cooked and sighed, and said something under my breath, not noticing my waitress walking up to our table, she heard me and immediately asked if she could have them make me a new one or if I'd like anything else. I didn't really mind and refused her offer, and she kept apologizing letting me know that she'd be willing to make it up to us if we changed our mind. A few moments later the manager came up to us to apologize and offer a discount on the meal because my food was less than perfect, which we gladly accepted. Despite my over cooked steak, I still left having had a great time and a wonderful customer service experience, I loved that our waitress paid attention to us, enough to notice that I was dissatisfied even without me mentioning anything directly to her, and she still made sure we were taken care of after my many refusals. I would come back here again. I just hope the cook is more experienced next time and doesn't make such a tough, over cooked steak..."
Bobby M.,"Murrieta, CA",51,4,,1.0,6/10/2015,"Me, my wife, and two kids took my mom to BJ's for my mom's birthday and the whole experience was a disaster.  Trying to get a hold of our waitress to get a refill was frustraiting.  It took about 15-20 minutes to get a hold of our waitress to get refills and she said she would get them herself right then.  It took her about 10 minutes to get mine and my wife's soda refill and about 30 minutes for my daughter's apple juice, which a different waitress brought us.  On top of that, all of our food was terrible.  My pulled pork sandwich was dry and had no flavor; my wife's steak had a ton of pepper on it, which my wife said none and it was well done when she asked for medium; my wife was supposed to get a house salad with her meal and she got some other kind of salad (and she was charged for it); and my mom's shrimp scampi had no flavor and the noodles were overcooked.  Then the waitress didn't even ask my mom if she wanted to get something for her birthday, but instead just brought it.  We complained about everything and the manager discounted our meal, but this was for my mom's birthday and the experience was terrible.  The service and food was terrible.  I do not recommend this place at all."
L M.,"Medical Lake, WA",34,10,,1.0,1/23/2014,"So disappointed. Came here for some family dinner time, several attempts of menu items just to be told they were out of it. Waitress didn't know what some of the dinner plates consisted of, drinks including water took forever to be brought to us! So much for a nice family dinner out. Will not return!"
