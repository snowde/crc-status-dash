Erin F.,"Murrieta, CA",0,20,2,1.0,3/22/2014,"BJ's is one of my favorite chain restaurants to go to. However this location is pretty bad. The service is horrible. And not one time, it's every time we go in there.  The last time I went it was a party of ten. We got our meals in shifts and then my husband didn't even get his meal. The server forgot to put it in. She felt terrible and then began to tell us this was her first night on the job by herself. They put a new server with a party of ten and multiple other tables....no wonder. They comped us desserts, but after so many bad experiences, I will never return to this location."
Dom B.,"Corona, CA",1,35,,3.0,2/9/2014,"The service is great and quick IF you go after 10pm which sometimes me and my boyfriend go. During the afternoon, the service is horrible. The servers are attentive sometimes. Usually during 10-11pm, servers are great. As for afternoon service, it is slow. The drinks are good! My other concern is the inconsistency of the food. Whenever I order from here, I feel like it is a gamble. The food can either be great or terrible! I tend to order the black and bleu burger. Once, it had bacon and was delicious. The presentation was wonderful. The meat was cooked perfectly. The second time, no bacon and it was undercooked. The third time, it was a mess!!!! I also tend to get a chicken dish. As with the burger, it is inconsistent."
Riley H.,"Wildomar, CA",0,3,1,1.0,5/19/2014,"They need help in their service department we had to ask them to wipe down our table because it was sticky when the waitress came to get our drink order, the waitress rudely walks away saying nothing, five minutes later the bus boy comes wipes it up then another 10 minute before the waitress decides to ask if we want something to drink. They couldn't make a long island ice tea had them re make it twice still wasn't right. This so calles ""Brewery"" can't pour a black and tan and never pick up an empty glass for the table until we asked them too. The food was good but at those prices I'm paying for service and the service just outright sucked"
Johanna G.,"Round Rock, TX",61,239,79,3.0,5/6/2013,Food deserves a 4 but the service a 2 so I settled on 3.  I would not recommend coming here if you have any time constraints.  I have been here numerous times and 9 times out of 10 the service is very slow.  But the food is always good which is important.
Lori A.,"Menifee, CA",4,12,2,4.0,9/12/2014,"So, I am not a real big fan of big ass chain restaurants, but after giving my Kohls card a workout with the fam, we were starving, and this placed seemed like a good option. I dont know why this place has poor reviews???? We all liked it! I had a MOUTH WATERING little drinky poo, called a pink cadillac martini...THE BOMB. Not too big, not too sweet, and a nice kick. AND ITS PINK!!!! Husband had beer. Ew. WHatever, he loved his beer, I do not partake in beer drinking. The kids loved their kid meals, their little kids menu was pretty extensive, and I was impressed, and they serve applesauce!!! WHAAAA? Big hit with the kiddies. My low fat, low cal dinner was very flavorful, and my husband sandwich and fries were great. Its not a gourmet place, its just a casual place to grab a drink and an appetizer with friends, or go for a quick and convienient family meal. I give this place a thumbs up, and we will most likely go back, because I am already craving another pink cadillac!"
Marlon D.,"Menifee, CA",136,36,6,3.0,4/26/2013,Came here for my son's bday dinner.  The food ordered was great.... when we finally got it...  service blew chuncks.  Took forever for us to get our food. Other than that experience was ... meh at best.
Sabrina C.,"Oceanside, CA",2,16,,2.0,5/13/2013,"Our first time at BJ's Brewhouse was in San Fransisco, it was DELICOUS- the time we went it was super busy and our food still came out hot and cooked to perfection. We have gone twice now to this one which is very close to our home, yesterday being one of those days, and the food was very bleh! My husbands Bison burger was undercooked and cold, my parmesan chicken was very plan and the mashed potatoes were dry! I will not be going back to this BJ's. I will be going back just not to this one..."
Megan F.,"March Air Reserve Base, CA",62,14,1,2.0,4/14/2013,"The food is good, but the service is not so great.  Every time we've gone we have a problem with the food taking forever to come out or getting the wrong food."
Leslie T.,"Hemet, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/6/2016,"I have spent years telling everyone how great BJs food is. Multiple visits to Mo Val and Temecula, and Torrance once with a larger group 10+. Food and service always has been excellent. I don't know what happened to the Menifee Haun location. Was there Monday evening went early to beat the crowd. We were seated right away server was quick to arrive and take drink and appetizer order. All good. Southwest eggrolls as always great. We order a rib eye and bread and the cherry chipotle salmon. Food arrives with no bread. Rib eye is cooked right but a bit grizzly. No fault it happens sometimes. The salmon is sorely lacking any kind of cherry chipotle anything; its served on couscous that is dripping wet with tomato flavored water and an assortment of asparagus spear sizes. While the thinner spears are perfect the nickel size spears are undercooked and the table is set with forks only. We flag down a server and I request additional sauce and where is the bread can that server handle this? No they will send our server. Now halfway through the meal the bread arrives and I'm told the sauce is being made and will be brought. Away she goes only for us to discover she has delivered bread with no butter whatsoever. Again we must flag a different server who of course again is unable to complete a simple task of bringing butter to the table and must again let our server know. Really? It probably wouldn't have been as annoying had I not watched her disappear then reappear in moments to congregate with 3 other girls at the reception desk and all stand around talking. Fast forward 3/4 thru the meal the butter is delivered. The sauce never did arrive and I can honestly say while properly cooked (not over or under cooked) the salmon was flavorless and the couscous a watery flavor disaster. In short completely lacking either cherry or chipotle flavor whatsoever. This location was a big let down for sure. I'll drive the extra distance to Temecula or Mo Val from now on. What happened to this location? Get the kitchen staff over to train these guys on the food prep and swap managers until the serving staff can be properly trained. 1 star for the quick seating, drink and appetizer order and delivery. That's where the good ended."
K M.,"Murrieta, CA",1,25,,4.0,11/4/2014,"We are big fans of BJ's and go to many different locations.  The Menifee BJ's generally has good service but can be a little slow on occasion.  That said, it I very friendly and the food is consistently good.  The to-go process took my repeating a simple order about three times so not sure if they couldn't hear or needed more training.  We do love the food though and will be back."
Josh P.,"Temecula, CA",19,7,6,1.0,12/15/2013,I would highly recommend driving the extra few miles to the BJs in Temecula the service in temecula and food is of a much better quality. I've been to this location in Menifee 3 different times and they never fail to disappoint... Enough to write a review.
Steve S.,"Menifee, CA",30,72,7,1.0,1/20/2013,"Came here last night and ordered the Jalapeno Burger and the New Orleans Jambalaya.  We asked for the burger to be medium, but it came out well done.  Thankfully the fried jalapenos tasted good, which saved the burger.  The Jambalaya, however, had to be sent back because the rice was undercooked.  When we received the second Jambalaya, it was over the top salty and spicy.  It seemed like they just put our order back into the pan and added whatever jambalaya seasoned stock they had and tried to cook the dish longer."
Andy A.,"Menifee, CA",0,3,,2.0,2/20/2014,"We are big fans of BJ's Brewery. We always like the food. But the service at this location is just horrible. Our dinner on a tuesday night was a 2 hour process. Slow service, multiple items were wrong. I had asked for a side of mayo for my burger when ordered, when they brought it to me no mayo so I asked again. She came back about 10 min later and got a couple drink orders came back with drinks and no mayo. someone asked for ranch so i asked a gain for my mayo 10 min later i got it, by then my burger was ice cold, we were 1 1/2 hours into the meal and I just wanted to get out of there."
Chris M.,"Hemet, CA",41,214,31,4.0,2/8/2013,"Classic Pizza and a Pazookie!  Service here can be slow at times, but I have a feeling once the restaurant has been here longer and is not so busy, those issues will get corrected."
Dario R.,"Menifee, CA",1,11,9,1.0,4/7/2014,This has to be the worst BJ's restaurant ever! Their service is awful! Their food is even worse! Thank you Menifee BJ's for serving me a rotten and foul tasting Calzone! I will never come to this BJ's ever again! I live in Menifee and would rather drive to Temecula than eat at this dump!
Joe S.,"Riverside County, CA",33,3,2,1.0,8/23/2014,"To be honest I own a couple pizza restaurants and can't seem to get away from pizza. Figured id give their pizza a shot and I wish I never did. The pizza was horrible, dough was undercooked and still real doughy. I maybe a little harsh just because I know how pizza should be cooked, but this was just bad. Typically the bottom of the pizza should brown a bit, almost more brown than white. But this was all white dough, and really undercooked. Made me sick. Overall service was good, spinach artichoke dip was good, my daughters Mac n cheese was good, but I'm giving them a 1 star because the pizza really ruined the entire experience."
Josh S.,"Temecula, CA",13,6,,1.0,11/5/2013,"What is the deal with this restaurant ???? I hope they close this place or fire the manager , I made the mistake of thinking the first 2 visits were just a bad server but my 3rd time was the same extremely slow service, i went there for happy hour it wasn't that busy but for 1 and half hours I was only able to get 2 drinks and cold calamari, you ever eat cold deep fried calamari? It's pretty nasty, I guess the saying 3 strikes and your out works for me. Go to the Texas road house it's pretty good"
Chloe R.,"Murrieta, CA",0,4,,4.0,12/8/2014,they have really good food. Sometimes the service is not good and if you ask for a burger well done its pink
Karl G.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",12,25,5,2.0,12/7/2012,"I have been here twice and both times were a disappointment.  I gave them the benefit of the doubt the first time since they had only been open for a couple weeks but the second time proved they had not improved.  We waited an hour after being told it would be a 20 minute wait.  Then waited almost another hour for our food and when it did arrive, the melted cheese and chicken in my sandwich was cool to the touch so I sent it back and 10 minutes later I got what looked like the exact same sandwich with cold melted cheese and chicken inside.  I left the restaurant at that point and will not be going back."
M J.,"Menifee, CA",0,2,,1.0,9/7/2012,Excited bjs opened in my neighborhood. Took my daughter and disgustingly found a pubic hair on her food yuck!!! When i showed my waitress she said she would get another  plate !! By this time I was so grossed out. I had to call manager over and tell her how disgusting that was. BJs was always my favorite until now. The hair just sat on the table after my daughter removed it from her food.Disgusting.
