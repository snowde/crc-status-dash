Jaime T.,"Sun City, CA",109,29,7,4.0,9/2/2012,Lunch today with family was just what id expect...Awesome. Service was on point I wish I could remember her name because she was great. My calzone was choice & mom loved her pasta. They weren't even upset by our request to change tables after a bit because my newborn nephew made us a lil nervous in the walkway. My brothers steak may of been a little over but I am spoiled & a back of house soul haha. Def be back for some dank pizza!
Sandy C.,"Homeland, CA",21,8,1,1.0,7/26/2014,"We eat here about 2x month, sit in bar area so we can watch Angel baseball. It has now been 30 minutes, asked our nice server twice, even asked bartender directly. Still no game. Food may be good, but service not so hot tonight."
Liliana W.,"Menifee, CA",3,15,2,3.0,11/20/2012,Went to BJ's with my friend because we wanted to have some drinks and because he's never been there before. The drinks were alright but the service sucked! the waitress forgot to take our order and we waited half and hour for a pazooki because she forgot we had ordered one! overall i'd only go back for drinks and not food.
Liliana L.,"Orange, CA",51,25,21,4.0,8/28/2012,"Went 3 days after Grand Opening. Expected it to be a little crazy instead, they seated us quickly and although it took a while for food, it was accurate and tasted as it should. We enjoyed our dinner much :)"
Jason M.,"Menifee, CA",0,7,,1.0,3/5/2013,"The worst BJ's there is. I'm generally easy to please, not a complainer, but this restaurant is consistently awful. After 6 visits over the last few months I realized it's not going to get any better. Besides the fact the service is incredibly SLOW, here are a few more examples of why this BJ's stinks. 1) We ordered appetizers and a pizza but didn't get our silverware until the pizza came, 2) four different times they brought by appetizers that weren't ours, 3) they get the order wrong more often than not, 4) my drink was empty for +30 minutes before offered a refill, 5) the salad was room temperature, 6) the servers weren't friendly. Everyone we've talked to says the same thing, just a terrible place. We drive down to the Temecula location instead, it's much better."
Servando B.,"Temecula, CA",0,7,1,1.0,4/15/2014,"I created a yelp account specifically to share my terrible experience here. My first experience at the menifee location (8 months ago approx) was terrible as far as the customer service but worse was the fact I got food poisoning from the food served. I told myself I would never return and they would never see another dollar from me. Well last night I wanted to take my parents out to eat at red robin and last minute they wanted bj's, I decided to give it another shot. The drinks took forever to arrive, my mothers iced tea was refilled about 15 minutes after her cup was empty. My mother and I both ordered pasta, our pasta plates arrived first and our garlic bread (part of the plate) arrived 10 minutes later only after I questioned our waiter about the location of our non existent garlic bread. This morning I wake up feeling sick and throw up as soon as I make it to my bathroom sink. I call my parents to say good morning and I find out my father has terrible diarrhea and my mother has been throwing up all night. This location needs to be investigated, there is either terrible food prep/cross contamination happening or the food being served is spoiled. I am disgusted by this location and will NEVER be returning to menifee bj's. I have never had issues at the Temecula location or  Moreno Valley location and it is terrible I have to drive past my local spot if I ever want to have bj's again. Likely I will not visit any other bj's location due to the poor service only topped by the food poisoning at this location."
Isaiah W.,"Murrieta, CA",1,6,2,5.0,1/20/2013,So glad they built this BJ's up here! It's always good here and the customer service is outstanding!
N K.,"Ramona, CA",41,16,7,1.0,4/10/2014,So my family and I went here last weekend. We were told the wait would be 20 minutes. Since I have never eaten here before I checked the reviews and told my family this location has a lot of bad reviews and we will probably be here for a while to just get seated. They thought we should give them the benefit of the doubt and still try them. So the 20 minute wait turned into almost 45 minutes lots of people were coming out but no one was being seated. I was in a hurry since it was already late and I had over an hour drive home since I was visiting and had a tired baby with me so I already knew what I was ordering to get ahead start once we got seated. The waiter was very friendly and my review is by no means based on him. So we finally got seated and ordered right away it would have been nice if there were signs in the waiting area about the new ordering system about how you can order from your phone and get 20% off your bill why you wAit instead of having it on the tables when your already seated. Anyways my fiancé and dad figured since it was so busy and the reviews were bad that it would be safe to order a burger they both ordered medium rare. So the food came out and pretty quick for how busy it was and my fiancé took a bite of his and it was completely burnt no joke I mean it was hard as a rock just burnt. He was upset and told them to just take it back don't worry about bringing a new one. My dad started on his  since he got his last and same thing hard as a rock burnt. He asked for a new one. The manager came over and apologized and said he would get his order out right away. Let's just say that when someone has already been waiting almost an hour and a half to eat and you mess up the order it should be the first thing you cook and bring back out. Obviously this was not the case we all finished our meals and 30 minutes after they took the order back he finally got his after I had to waive down the waitress since the manager kept ignoring us trying to waive him down and call for him when he looked right at us and was less than five feet away. The waitress didn't even know what table to bring it to and was asking everyone in the room. The only reason they got a one star from me is the waiter was very nice and we kept telling him it wasn't his fault but he felt really bad. The manager didn't charge for one of the burgers but if I were him I would have comped both and the drinks. Trust the reviews they are dead on and this place really needs work. I saw one of the cooks outside and he just looked so stressed out and was talking bad about the place. I don't blame him maybe they are understaffed or just have a bad management to guide them but they should really get their stuff together some of the food was great some of it was alright but had potential to be better if it was cooked right. My appetizer was the goat cheese grilled veggie pizza and it was extremely soggy in the middle I have had this same pizza other places it is a flat bread pizza that is crispy and this just wasn't cooked all the way through but it was still good. I'm just disappointed that they couldn't even cook a burger oh and I forgot to mention the new burger that came out still wasn't cooked right a little less burnt but still way over done but at that point my dad was frustrated and just asked for a to go box and probably didn't even eat it when he got home but he didn't want to make a scene. He even told them about the second burger but still was charged and they didn't even offer to give him something else on the menu. Get it together people you wanted jobs in this town and now that you have them you can't even get it right.
Elle C.,"Apple Valley, CA",3,31,2,4.0,10/21/2012,"We ordered a family meal to go and not only was it good, it was easy and convenient!"
Krystle B.,"Temecula, CA",0,5,,2.0,3/8/2013,"I am always frusterated with this restaurant. There is a major disconnect between the front of the house and the back of the house. It is frusterating because the food is AMAZING, however getting the food in a timely manner is a pain.  Every time my husband and I have been here we place our drink and appetizer order first. We wait to order our food until our drinks from the bar arrive before we order our entrees. There is always at least 10 to 15 minutes between ordering appetizers and ordering food......somehow our appetizers always arrive at the same time or AFTER our entrees which is incredibly frusterating. We have mentioned this to the managers a few times, and they seem to not really care. We were even told once, that they would put our food under the heat lamps until we finished our appetizers if we would like. We gave it four visits, we will not be back, which is sad because like I said, the food is amazing!"
Doug R.,"Sun City, CA",0,1,,2.0,8/8/2014,We've been coming in regularly on weekday and weekend nights. My husbands favorite is the lunch bottomless soup & salad. He has always ordered it and never has had a problem. Our server Jason told us that there is a new general manager that is no longer allowing guests to order it. Allie was the manager tonight. She did not come by to explain why. We are highly disappointed
JESSE A.,"Sun City, CA",0,2,,1.0,7/1/2013,"Me and my wife went there to have dinner this past Friday.  We had heard many good things about the Temecula restaurant and figured we'd try this Menifee one out. Right from the entrance we were treated rudely and told to have a seat...where's the escort to w/c table ? Then when we got  seated we never got utensils/napkins. Food was finally brought to out table but still no utensils/napkins. Had to ask for them. Ordered a burger and was asked how I liked it cooked..well done or medium? My answer was well done. After cutting the burger in half my wife saw that it was still very red inside. I then called the server and mentioned my burger hasn't been cooked enough, so she went ahead and removed it to be recooked again. It took some time before my burger arrived, I was able to share my wife's salad while waiting. After a long wait and already got full off my wifes salad, I just asked for the check and decided not to have the burger anymore.  By that time we were no longer in the mood to continue waiting. Food looked and probably was good but service was poor, even though it was a Friday night, it wasn't super busy and there were more that enough workers I saw helping other customers. I wouldn't retun to this restaurant again and don't advise it, might be better to take the drive to the Temecula Restaurant instead. Menifee is starting to get some good eateries but if the service is like this, better to drive a little further."
Robyn M.,"Menifee, CA",0,23,,1.0,3/26/2014,"We have been here probably 10 times (yes I know, why do we keep torturing ourselves) and have only had ONE positive experience as far as the service goes.  Food is decent for a chain restaurant but the service is so poor that it is not even funny.  You would think that all of these consistently bad reviews would get someone's attention in corporate but I assume that there are so many other residents who are desperate enough to eat there due to the lack of sit-down restaurants in the area that they are still making decent money.  If you go, be prepared for bad service.  If you happen to have a decent experience then consider yourself the recipient of a pleasant surprise. :)"
John F.,"Menifee, CA",0,8,,4.0,7/7/2013,As a former server I tend to be a little more critical on service. I'm happy to say that both times I was here with my family we had very good service and all the food was tasty. We especially  liked the peperoni pizza with fresh basil. My daughter also says that she really liked the pot roast with mashed potatoes.
Mike F.,"Huntington Beach, CA",49,33,1,2.0,5/11/2013,"2 stars because the food and beer is good. everything else is subpar. service overall is bad. hostesses have a bad sense of time. they said it'll take ""15-20"" minutes to be seated - i think they were told to say ""15-20 minutes"" to everybody. we waited 35 minutes. wait service is horrible. food took longer than it should. when the food finally came out 40 minutes later, they set it down on the edge of the table with no silverware, not even asking us if we needed anything else. i literally had to chase down a waitress to get silverware.  ummm i'd say i wont be going back to the BJ's in menifee."
Kevin K.,"Menifee, CA",0,5,,1.0,8/18/2013,"Our 6th time at this bj's,  five out of six times we have had service or food issues. This will be our last trip to this location. We gave it time because it was new, but it continues to disappoint."
Uh'oh U.,"Menifee, CA",0,22,3,2.0,2/25/2014,"Been here a couple of times. And each time has been similar. The food there is good. But for a big chain restaurant it's not up to the level. For being a well known restaurant. This restaurant is not run that well. The waiters and waitresses there are sort of rude and stuck up. It takes forever to get our order. And forever to get our drinks and food after we order. The food there like I said is good. But it's not great. Not cooked that good, it's like whatever. And for spending so much money on a meal, I rather want a well prepared meal then a crappy one. The atmosphere there doesn't help. Just overall a subpar average restaurant. Has potential, but isn't living up to it."
Yuli S.,"Menifee, CA",0,14,1,1.0,9/3/2013,"I went to have lunch with my mom and a friend today 09/03/13 we were seated and told our server will be with us shortly. 15 minutes later we were still waiting for the server to take our drinks. I had to get the attention from another waitress to let her know we had been waiting for 15 minutes for our server. She apologized and took our drink n food order! The actual waitress came and brought our drinks, my moms glass was cracked! And it wasn't a little crack. They took it and brought another one. When we finally received our food after waiting another 15+ minutes her salmon was burn! I ordered a to go burger for my brother and again we had to wait for another 10 minutes! And it was not busy for the amount of waiting time! I will not be going back to that Bj's!!! As we were leaving we past another table who ordered a pizza! Their pizza crust was also very burned! Replace cooks or manager that can not run the place correctly!"
E R.,"Redlands, CA",16,30,,1.0,3/20/2013,This restaurant location REFUSED to provide nutritional information to our office when we wanted to place a large lunch order from them. We were told they could not fax us the info and it is not available online and that we would have to come to restaurant in person to look at a menu. They have lost our business.
Mandy F.,"Riverside, CA",0,2,,5.0,7/14/2013,"Today we held a surprise party for my grandfather's 80th birthday complete with 23 people! From calling for reservations 3 weeks before to today's lunch, our service was behind amazing! Our 2 servers were EXCELLENT, the extra people helping deliver food were super nice and helpful. Food all came out HOT, correct and brought out drinks over and over again without having to ask for refills! They were nice enough to stick the cake in the beer cooler to keep it cold. When it was time for the cake they brought out, helped place the candles and light them all! Next thing I know, they were out there signing right a long with all of us! They were seriously the greatest servers we've had in a VERY long time from any restaurant. Today wouldn't have gone as well if it wasn't for all the amazing, friendly, hard working BJ's workers! THANK YOU Menifee's BJ's, Janesa and Paco for helping make my grandfather's birthday so amazing!"
