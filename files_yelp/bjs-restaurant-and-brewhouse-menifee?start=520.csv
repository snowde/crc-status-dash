Sabrina B.,"Menifee, CA",0,7,,3.0,5/10/2014,"I personally love BJ's!! But the Menifee location.... Phew. That's a tough one. I'll just start off with my first experience at this location: it was by boyfriends birthday (now this was within the same month they opened) the food was great, service was good, but once I got home, STOMACH PAINS. Not just me, but him and his mom too! The three of us all got food poisoning! After that time I've never had any MAJOR issues with their food other than it could be prepped a little nicer. But I hardly ever go to this location for food, if I want to go to BJ's, I usually always go to the temecula location because id much rather wait in traffic and wait another 10 minutes to be seated than eat at the one right down the street. Sadly, all my friends say they do the same thing!! Notice when you walk in it's never busy.... Wonder why? I only go to this location if I'm craving a pizookie and need one pronto! Though sometimes the pizookie isn't even cooked all the way (I've has this problem at other BJ's too) but I enjoy cookie dough, so it's alright with me! Oh and the mozzarella sticks are prime."
Marie H.,"Hemet, CA",2,10,2,1.0,12/10/2013,"We have eaten at the BJ's in Temecula more times then I can even count.  We have visited the Menifee location a couple of times now, since it is closer to home for us.  I have to say my experience on Sunday was absolutely the worst service I have ever had from a restaurant in my entire life.  Prior to going I had heard from at least 4 people that it isn't worth the trip but we came to your establishment anyways.  First off after we ordered our drinks we had to ask twice for our beverages before we finally received them.  Then when my salad and my husbands burger arrived I was completely thrown off by how terrible the food looked.  I literally without exestuation  had seven cubes of turkey and three bits of bacon on my cobb salad and three handfuls of lettuce.  I asked for the dressing on the side since we were going to share and I had to ask twice for that before that came too. My husbands bison burger was so small and dry the only thing on it was the meat and one half of a green chili. He asked for the onions on the side an didn't even get those until after two times of asking.  Also we had to ask three different people for silverware before those came as well.  When I asked to speak to a manager about our meals they offered to bring out some more toppings for my salad but they said that is how the food comes now.  Which is unacceptable in my mind.  Then I gave the salad back.  At this point I would rather eat a Wendy's salad for a third of the price. My husband ate his pathetic burger because he was so hungry and after eating it he was still hungry.  The bread was so dry that he finished his drink and the waitress never came by again to see if he wanted more.  After my kids were finished we asked for our bill.  After 30 minutes we waited for the waitress to come back by and she said the manager was still trying to take the salad off of the check, which can't be a difficult thing to do. Then we asked to speak to the manager again and the waitress said that first manager we spoke to was the kitchen manager and not the other manager.  So when I asked to speak to him she said that she didn't know where he is and then I had to persuade her to try to find him.  Apparently he was taking care of a handful of other customers who were also complaining about the substandard food and service.  After a while he came to our table.  He said that he was sorry for the service and he would take the food bill off of our debit card.  I told him that we paid with a $25 gift card and$19.44 on the debit card and he said he would take care of the bill.  He also said that there have been a lot of cut back from corporate and that the entire staff is about 75% proficient but they just don't have anyone who really knows what they are doing.  He also said that the burger my husband ordered come premade so they can't fix that.  Which is gross.  If I wanted a premade burger I could go through a drive thru and pay $0.99 for a burger like that not $12.00.  So after everything I check my account today and what do I see.  A charge from BJ's for the $19.44.  Not only do you rob our family of a nice evening out, give us the most pathetic food, the worst service, warm drinks, I have to continuously ask for things over and over and over again which should be automatic, like silverware and now after the manager saying he is going to take care of everything I had to pay nearly $50 total for this terrible experience. If this is what Bj's is coming to then I can bet you won't be in business long. So here I am writing this letter because I am s frustrated and I can guess what is going to happen...Nothing!  Shame on you BJ's."
J L.,"Temecula, CA",36,106,27,2.0,1/2/2013,"Gave this place a second shot. I'm going to give our waitress the benefit of the doubt and tell myself she was new. My dish came with rice, I asked if I could substitute brown rice instead, and she didn't know what that was so she offered me rice pilaf. She also didn't seem to know that my order came with a side of soup or salad, because she never asked me which I preferred. So I told her I'd like a wedge salad. 15 minutes later she comes back to our table and says ""Your entree comes with soup or salad which"" I told her, ""yes, I know I asked for a wedge salad."" on top of that our drinks were empty, she didn't remove our empty plates after our starter salads and appetizers before bringing out our entrees, which made for a VERY crowded table. Another person at our table ordered a burger with NO pickles, the burger came and it looked like it had extra pickles. My rice that came with my salmon was old and very dried out. It tasted like my plate had been sitting out for a good hour before it was brought to my table. it was also luke warm, which was not appetizing."
Fred B.,"Riverside, CA",0,1,,1.0,3/7/2014,"Thank you BJ's for one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. Sitting for over an hour waiting for my food and then being told that my appetizer wasn't coming was just great. Hearing the guy behind complain that he found something in his food made it even better. But the real kicker was the quality of the food, tough and dry. Just perfect. Now I'm just waiting for the check so I can get out of here."
Lorin M.,"Sun City, CA",14,3,,1.0,7/31/2014,"I gave three chances before reviewing. Food is good but service is mediocre. I always go in the afternoon when its slow, but even then, servers are invisible. The first time I had to finally ask when my salad would be ready as it had already been 20 minutes (I could tell by the time stamp on a text I sent right after I ordered.). It finally came with my entree. The second time my server never checked on me and I finally asked a busboy for a soda refill. Today I waited again for my starter salad and was taking my second bite when my pasta arrived. That was the last I saw of my server until both empty plates and my empty glass were stacked at the edge of the table. My soda was empty for the last half of my meal. This will be the last chance I give them. I've been a server for approx. 20 years. My own customers must think I'm a stalker if this is now the normal standard of service. I always check on guests 2-3 times, and keeping drinks refilled is imperative. And when the restaurant is practically empty, there is no excuse for dismal service. Three chances is enough."
Ryan M.,"Sun City, CA",0,2,1,1.0,8/25/2012,"Food is okay.. Wait staff is horrible, and can't get noticed or taken care of.. Hostesses are very helpful, and are almost forced to be apologetic for lacking service.."
Mandalyn M.,"Hemet, CA",0,13,5,1.0,9/24/2012,"I was so excited to have a BJ's open close to my house.  Went there last Saturday just to check it out....have a beer sampler and maybe an appetizer.  My boyfriend and I started with the calamari and 2 appetizer bites; the bruschetta and stuffed mushrooms.  The bruschetta and mushrooms were awesome!!  The calamari was just ok but it got worse when I found a hair fried into the calamari.  There were 3 bartendars of which really one was helpful; she took the calamari and asked if we wanted something else.  My boyfriend ordered the wonton bites and artichoke bites; of which we only received one of.....the artichoke bites (so good).  The service was so lack luster....if he didn't ask we would have never got the wontons, he ordered an ice tea.....never got it.  Then had to ask if the calamari was coming off the bill.  I have been in the service industry and if this happened to one of my customers I would have been mortified and so apologetic.  Honestly, I was so surprised that no one seemed horrified that there was a hair in my food nor at any time was there an apology.  Sooooooo DISAPPOINTED!!!"
David R.,"Winchester, CA",3,50,,1.0,1/19/2014,"We will not be going back to either BJ's location, Temecula or Menifee.  Like others have said, no napkin or silverware at the table.  Our waitress was ok.  I have two food complaints, and they are the reason we are finally finished with going to BJ's.  First, the Pizza.  We have really liked their deep dish pizza for a few years now, but the amount of sauce, next to none, and the very skimpy toppings have always kind of been a bummer.  We ordered a mini with sausage and mushrooms, and I think I saw one mushroom on the very last bite.  Again, there is basically no sauce, which is a bummer.  The final straw is the Tortilla soup.  I have lost 30 lbs. in the past 8 months, and one of the things I did to lose weight was eat their Tortilla soup instead of a big meal.  Had it at least once a week if not more, for a few months straight.  Over this period of time (Temecula location), I noticed the amount of broth getting smaller and smaller, to the point that I still have chips and avocado to eat, but no broth left to eat it with.  My wife began to notice the same thing, when she started to get the Tortilla soup with me, and we would share a stuffed Shroom appetizer.  This last time at the Menifee location, the amount of soup in the BOWL was pathetic.  I asked if we got the cup instead, and the waitress said no, the bowl, but she went back and charged us for a cup.  I am back on my weight loss program to lose my final 20 lbs. and will now have to go elsewhere for my soup once or twice a week.  Too bad, but a customer can only take so much, until they feel it is a slap in the face.  We hit that point, and are done."
Joey H.,"Los Angeles, CA",62,320,3,5.0,11/1/2012,"this location just opened recently and both of us were very happy about that. there are two reasons why we love BJ's. first reason, they have a gluten-free pizza. to my knowledge, i cant think of another pizza place that has that option for customers. second reason, we believe they have the best pizza. theres a place in L.A. that comes close, but BJ's is tops. we ordered over the phone, got in the car, drove there, parked (they have special parking for pick up), walked to the pick up desk, paid and were on our way home to enjoy. so easy, the only bad part was driving home smelling the pizza. she had the gluten-free, spinach and artichoke, i had a veggie. YUMMY! enough said."
JD J.,"Torrance, CA",0,14,,4.0,8/23/2013,"I've ordered  food that was so, so but for the most part, I enjoy BJ's.  The service is a little bit irritating like a lot of places.  Orders get mixed up, or undercooked, as if young people can't hear anymore above their texting."
Leigh Ann R.,"Menifee, CA",9,10,2,2.0,6/1/2014,"In a word - disappointing. We don't come here very often because of the expense and the general busyness of this place, but we do have high expectations based on previous visits to this location. It wasn't just one thing, the service was ok, not great, the food ok, not great. My husband ordered fried chicken expecting actual parts of chicken and he got basically chicken tenders with gravy on them. I had the shrimp pasta and the shrimp was undercooked. The waiter was very attentive about getting the dish remade and he apologized. Here's one of my pet peeves with restaurants in general:  food runners. The food runners were the ones who delivered our meals. Why in the name of BJ's do they pass you a plate, announcing ""it's hot."" If it's hot, then bring me hot pads or something! We were a party of seven, sitting in one of their long booths, so I had to pass my son's pizza to him, with the ""hot plate"" announcement. Luckily, it wasn't too hot for my hands. Two of the meals were left behind by the food runners, mine and one of my kids. They came back pretty quickly, but didn't bother to tell me ""hot plate"" this time when my bowl was handed to me across the table. This time it was a little too hot for my hands, I managed to set it in front of me without dumping it on myself or the table, which was my initial reaction. The food runner apologized about 10 times (not exaggerating, I promise). And joked about how he's gotten used to the hot plates. This was my first dish. When my reordered pasta came, with a different runner, she tried to pass it to me again like the first one did. I said no way, been there, done that. Although she was not aware of the previous lack of warning, she was not amused and looked a little annoyed that she had to walk to the other side of the booth to place my dish in front of me. Like I said, it wasn't a horrible experience, just ok and I expect a heck of a lot more from BJ's!"
JR R.,"Murrieta, CA",0,100,,4.0,9/13/2012,"Went with a large party, very busy for a week night as recently opened. With reservation we still waited 1/2 hour. The front desk was rather unorganized, though pleasant. Our server Susan, was exceptional, obviously very experienced. The beers are good, especially the IPA's. Nice menu reasonably priced. Will probably wait a while to go back after the novelty has worn off. This area really needed a nice restaurant."
Keith H.,"Battle Creek, MI",0,9,6,4.0,1/20/2013,Great place bryonna our waitress was great i give it4 1/2 stars out of five because the foods took a while to get here.
Mz T.,"Melbourne Beach, FL",0,41,3,1.0,8/18/2013,"worse service at BJs ever! We are local, and generally enjoy BJs so was beyond excited to see this one open. Gave it about 6-7 visits. it is officially the worse overall. had a couple stellar servers at 1st, which is why we've been several more times. But lately, it is clear the management does not value/train/focus on the meaning of customer service. At last visit, server came to put drink napkins and say she will be right back. bar area we were in seemed semi/busy so we appreciated the acknowledgement. 10min later and she still had not come back to take our drink order!? almost walked out when she finally came. that was the start of one of the worse evenings at BJs (Other was also at this location; beer tasting dinner from hell). 1hr later due to the slowest server on earth, we were handed someone else's pizza. an apology from our server then an apology from 2 different managers. appreciated the apologies so we didn't become those customers that waged war cuz their pizza took over 45min to arrive, but when our bill came and there was no adjustment for the pizza debauchery...well that sealed the deal for us. paid the bill as is cuz didn't want to spend any more than the 2hrs already wasted there but will never come back to THIS BJs ever again!"
Breanne R.,"Rancho Bernardo, San Diego, CA",0,6,,1.0,1/7/2014,I went there for my friends birthday.  I called ahead for the 30 minute call ahead reservation.  I got there and they have me the buzzer to inform me when my table was ready.  The hostess informed me it was about a 30 minute wait.  I waited close to an hour and finally went and asked how much longer.  They informed me that they had activated my buzzer but I had not come.  I told them that I had waited in the waiting area if the restaurant and it never went off.  She apologized and told me I would be the next table.  I sat down and watch 3 tables get called.  I went back up there and asked the other hostess how much longer.  The hostess looked up the information and told me since I had been given that new buzzer 5 minutes before to be patient. (With attitude and clear annoyance). The origional hostess jumped in and told her I had been waiting longer than 5 minutes. The hostesses were both bitchy and had I not been there for a friends birthday I would have left.
Mary S.,"Sun City, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/20/2013,"My husband and I went to bjs for dinner on a Friday night. The hostess told as it would be   30-35 min wait. We said ok and went to the bar. The service at the bar was efficient , we're called for our table within fifteen min. We placed our order for steak and chicken and waited and waited. Our waitress was busy but went to the back and checked for our order several times. She was apologetic for the wait  and said she would tell her manager about the delay. Goodness that also took like twenty mins. By then it was pretty late, past nine o'clock, we were tired of waiting and just not in a mood to eat there anymore. Finally when the manager brought our dinner he said it was on the house because of the wait and he hoped we would give this place another try. We took our late dinner home. This is not our first time eating at bjs in menifee, we live few min away from it, and is not the first time we had waited long for our food but this was the worse wait. I've tried giving this place several tries but won't be going there again. Would drive an extra fifteen min to temecula where the service is better. On a good note the pizza and beer are very good."
