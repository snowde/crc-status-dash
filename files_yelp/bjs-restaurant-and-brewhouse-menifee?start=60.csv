Mercy S.,"Yorba Linda, CA",43,69,37,2.0,12/8/2016,"Came here because we love BJs signature Great white pizza. But.... We didn't get anything great the first time around. The clam chowder tasted very bag in the box salty like. The salad was good, but it's salad. The Great white had 0 I mean 0 cheese nor Alfredo sauce. Halfway through the hubby finally realizes why I've stopped eating. Because there's no sauce or cheese. Coming from the food industry either they used cheap cheese and burned it off or just skimped on it to where it's non-existent after melting off in the process. We complained and luckily got a server that listened bc she said the second pizza came out the same and so she told the mgr who then showed the ""cook"" how to make the 3rd one. That's the only reason they got the 2 stars A for effort on the server's part. Pizookie was good but it's a chocolate chip cookie with Vanilla ice cream again not rocket science. Which apparently the Great white is at this place. Don't go here if you're hangry let alone hungry be a use you'll turn very Hangry waiting for the right pizza to come out. Management: I posted a picture of the one we got vs the one to go to fix it. Problem is, we don't usually eat out during the week. If this is what happens during the week, guess where I won't be going on the weekends?"
Mckenzie S.,"Perris, CA",0,1,,2.0,11/18/2017,"The service started off great, Chris is a great waiter and was super friendly. I ordered the sliders for dinner with no onions. When my plate was brought out to me, the only thing on my burgers were onions. I sent it back and it came back out cold, and I noticed that all they had done was scraped the onions off and threw some lettuce and pickles on the side. Not to mention that the hamburger ""patties"" were the size of a quarter. No joke. Good service but poor quality food and kitchen."
Miranda B.,"Spring Valley, CA",0,18,,5.0,9/7/2017,"I live two hours away and absentmindedly left my house keys at my table. I got home and realized I left them. You can imagine the dread I felt thinking of driving myself and my toddler a total of four hours to pick them up. Called this BJs and could tell they were really busy. Rachel was really professional and sweet over the phone. She even told me it wasn't my fault I left my keys there. (Totally was, but it was really nice of her to make me not feel as bad.) And they are shipping my keys back.  Good customer service at this place! Thank you guys."
Jeremy M.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",1,16,1,2.0,9/4/2017,-Kid's salad was bigger than the adult salad -Water was undrinkable -Pizza was overpriced and about the same quality as Pizza Hut -Service was mediocre
Gary R.,"Sun City, CA",0,3,,1.0,9/4/2017,Not a busy night only 445PM. Waiting at our table for more than 10 minutes to give our drink order...still waiting! Gave them another shot-Not a lot of customers but 40-50 minute wait. No for BJ's
Curtis L.,"Menifee, CA",0,1,,5.0,11/22/2017,I was very Leary going here based off of other people's reviews however.....pleasantly surprised!  Great waiter!  Great food! Great environment!  We loved the fact it wasn't too noisy so we didn't have to yell at each other. We will be going again!
Erica H.,"Menifee, CA",128,99,45,3.0,12/3/2016,"Ok, I like BJ's and come here pretty often. The good: Coupons galore.  BJ's has some pretty good deals, including BOGO entrees and their 2 for $25 deal.  However, their entrees are outrageously priced normally...you could spend almost $20 which is crazy to me.  Their food is pretty dang good though.  And, I like that they have a nice variety so everyone at your table is able to find something they like.  Dat pan pizza...delicious. This location has horrible service though.  This male host sounded like a robot and it was really off-putting how he clearly just did not give a s*** and was just going through the motions.  I have worked in food service and know it sucks but this guy just didn't put in a modicum of effort.  I mean, it won't stop me from coming back but it was a poor experience which left a mark on me."
Alisa R.,"Winchester, CA",2,130,25,4.0,8/15/2017,"Well this was a pleasant surprise.   We have not been here in almost a year, and decided to give it a try.  Things have changed here in a very positive way.  Our server Mary was great.  Very attentive, and friendly.   Our food, Mediterranean Chicken Tacos, and the Penne Pasta were very tasty.  The food quality has definitely improved as well as the overall customer service.  Great job."
Denise Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",32,5,6,3.0,8/30/2017,Good food. Nice servers! Always overworked though. A great place to go if you have a couple of hours. NOT FAST FOOD!!!
Andres S.,"Menifee, CA",115,1,,1.0,8/3/2017,Worst restaurant I've ever been to in my entire life. Don't waste your time and money. Your better off going to Sonic across the street.
Robert G.,"Menifee, CA",0,1,,5.0,6/24/2017,Slow service and our food was cold. D or 6 rating as of rt now  Corp. office needs to come out and observe site.
Ashley W.,"Menifee, CA",0,2,,1.0,8/16/2017,"Every time I've been here the service has been very slow and servers do not seem to care about their customers. I came in the other day and brought 2 appetizers and both were over cooked, then once it was time to get our check the server did not bring it out until we asked 4 times for it. She took an extraordinarily long time to come back with our change as well, not to mention it was not busy at all. Not the first time we've had a bad experience here and I do not plan on coming back anytime soon."
Kevin F.,"Romoland, CA",3,1,,1.0,5/1/2017,"Worst service ever, they suck. I'm the type of person that is willing to pay good money for great food and yesterday was the worst experience ever. The food was cold and the service wasn't great at all. Never going back to that restaurant again."
Janine W.,"Temecula, CA",48,2,2,1.0,10/12/2016,"While I use Yelp to check on places I would like to try, I have never written a review. I felt that this experience had to be shared.  Worst service EVER!! 3 servers working a party of 25 and we rarely saw any of them. When one finally did come by we asked to order more drinks and also have guests who had arrived 10 minutes earlier  (and never acknowledged) order some cocktails. We were told that this server was not their server (the new guests) and she could take our drink order but would send another waitress by to get the new guests order. I ordered my beer with my waitress at the same time as another friend. His drinks were brought out 8 minutes later but mine was not brought for another 7 minutes. At this point I was contemplating going straight to the bar to get service. Not only was it difficult to order cocktails, we couldn't even get our water glasses refilled.  A few guests arrived after the majority of the party and ordered their food a good 15-20 minutes after the rest of the group. When food started coming out they auctioned off the food and gave food to the people who had just ordered while those of us who ordered earlier waited (some had ordered the same items as the earlier group). .  None of the servers ever came by to ask how our meals were. They never pre-bussed any plates and dishes were literally stacked on our table when they brought out the cake and stayed there until after we left. When they brought the cake they put plates down then gave us silverware in the plastic containers that are run through the dishwasher. Very tacky!! I spoke with the manager who discounted our bill but it did not compensate for ruining a special occasion gathering as all anyone could talk about was how horrendous the service was.  I will never return to this location."
Christine T.,"Hemet, CA",1,26,1,5.0,6/9/2017,"Me and hubby and the kiddos came a few days back and it was amazing!The food was delish and our waiter was awesome,I can't remember his name but he was very polite and made sure we had everything we needed. It was actually my first time there and I loved it,me and the family were very pleased. I definitely would recommend this place to my family and friends and WE will be returning to this place soon. Thank you for the great service and food."
Lexi D.,"Temecula, CA",0,4,,2.0,4/9/2017,"I was very excited when seeing Menifee had their own Bj's location as I usually enjoy their food and atmosphere. However, after coming in on a less than busy night, our waitress spoke to us a total of 3 times during the duration of our meal. Both me and my dinner date were out of water and clearly needed refills, with our waitress even mentioning bringing some over, unfortunately we never once received one refill. The chips we received with our spinach and artichoke appetizer were dirty, with ranch and some other sauce dripped on various chips throughout the pile, and with our waitress MIA for half the meal there was no ability to address the issue. I am a server and have over 5 years in the food industry, and this was the worst service I have ever received at any restaurant. I would highly recommend the Temecula location over this one."
Nicole A.,"Anaheim, CA",4,45,8,2.0,6/24/2017,"I like BJs but not this one. The hostess always seem to be clueless. Also, most places they are eager to answer your questions about the menu but this place not so much. Maybe these are small things to be disgruntled about but it makes me not want to come here. Came today just for dessert and what a waste of time. It was not busy by any means but was made to wait. Ordered a pizooki for my daughter and did the trio to get her a small one yet they could have told us there was the same small one on the kids menu for less. I think that just sucks. We won't be coming back."
Ed H.,"Anaheim, CA",27,9,,5.0,11/15/2016,"Wow...what a mixed bag of reviews! Time for this bird to sing. I've been a BJ's fan since the opening of the original brewery location in Brea 20 years ago and have visited somewhere in the range of 50 - 60 of their locations. That said, Menifee is easily in my top five...let me tell you why: * Quality: Yes, I have my favorites like the Jambalaya on an infrequent rainy day and the pizza is always a strong go-to. My family and I have never had anything less than a stellar presentation at this location.  * Variety: My son is a very picky eater and my Wife and two teenage daughters are even more so. As a result, it's hard to find a restaurant all can agree upon, BJ's is the exception because of the myriad of choices. Burger? Check.   Pasta? Check.   Pizza? Check   Ribeye? Perfectly done. * Cleanliness: This place is the cleanest around. [Caution: Sexist, apolitical rant ensues] I often joke that you can generally tell if the General Manager of an establishment is a man or a woman by the emphasis placed on bathroom cleanliness. I'd bet dollars to doughnuts that the GM here is a woman because everything (including the restrooms) is generally spotless. There, I said it. * Service: The service here is always attentive enough without bordering on overbearing. That says something, because a pretty big chunk of their business comes directly from Sun City; and those folks can be pretty hard to please at times...I've witnessed it firsthand on many occasions. So, haters are gonna hate...but I'm here to tell you that this place is as close to rainbows and unicorn tears as you are going to find in a 20-mile radius."
Amy P.,"Perris, CA",73,6,1,5.0,5/23/2017,We came in tonight for a first time visit. Our server Bree was amazing she talked us through the menu and even got us tasters of the beers we were interested in... She helped us pick our meals and was very attentive. She asked us if we were enjoying our meals and had an amazing attitude. Its not very often nowadays that you receive high quality service but we received that tonight.. She is a great server..
Nate B.,"Sun City, CA",45,7,,2.0,10/11/2017,"We've given this BJ's multiple tries for different occasions and times from the first week they opened their doors to as recently as a few weeks ago and have never not had multiple problems. From silverware and cups that are nearly always dirty and lipstick covered, to getting SOMETHING wrong with the order (wrong side with the kids meals, dressing on the salad instead of the side, missed toppings on the pizzas- even slimy/wilted salad leaves and rotten tomatoes served to our table). The staff makes a half attempt to get it right, but it feels like mistakes are so common here that they don't even think they're a problem. I've been to plenty of other BJ's and most are great and run well, it's unfortunate that we can't visit our hometown one as it just never got off the ground quite right. We'll stop in for a beer and appetizer here and there and cross our fingers that it's not screwed up, but as far as bringing family and friends here for a full meal, we're just done."
