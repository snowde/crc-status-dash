Monica D.,"Sun City, CA",3,34,7,4.0,6/29/2017,"We always have wonderful service here. My husband loves their beer selection, and I love that it's so family friendly. We usually call ahead since the wait can get long quickly in the evenings. Our servers have always been very kind and accommodating, especially to our kids. Try going for happy hour! They have great specials on foods and drinks. We usually go and order a variety of appetizers to share. All delicious :)!"
Roland M.,"San Diego, CA",82,63,18,2.0,5/14/2016,"Ordered take out from this location and the food was horrible. I had the deep dish pizza and it was 90% bread and 10% toppings, I felt like I was eating a loaf of bread with some cheese sprinkled on top. My wife's jambalaya was practically a soup it was so watery. I've attached photos of what I'm talking about.  Overall the food was extremely disappointing. Not sure if it's because we ordered take out or because as other reviewers have commented that this place is hit or miss. Either way the food was unacceptable and we left over half of the $70 worth of food uneaten."
Rose B.,"Perris, CA",0,1,,5.0,7/21/2017,The food was amazing! It was so good I had to ask who made it.. thank you Luis lopez c. Every time I go I'm asking for him to make my food!
Drea G.,"Corona, CA",53,10,6,5.0,4/4/2017,"Had a fantastic server he was amazing and I ate the cauliflower Pita taco and oh my God so good your little Salad that comes with it amazing the stout beer is good ,on point.  Probably the best service I've had in a really long time."
Chad C.,"Sun City, CA",0,10,21,5.0,10/14/2017,"We come here almost every weekend for brunch in the mornings, and we really enjoy it. The food is great and BJ's is one of the only places we've found that can handle a weekend breakfast crowd without getting overwhelmed by the chaos. Special thanks to our server Dylan this morning, he was fantastic!"
Raymond Y.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",98,21,17,5.0,9/25/2016,"Best 'BJ's PIZZA' we've ever had.  We frequent this establishment(BJ's in all places--RC & Chino hills), we have accepted pizza is Mediocre at best, usually cold & kids pizza with scant amount of cheese. But NOT here in Murrieta, pizza was DELICIOUS! It was cheesey, warm, & packed with toppings. Now I will be disappointed when we get regular Bj's pizzas elsewhere.."
Tess N.,"Moreno Valley, CA",158,70,139,1.0,10/6/2016,Not a fan of this venue. We have been here a few times before.  The food and service was horrifying but one BJ's fan raved about their pizza.  Maybe we will try their pizza one day.... but not soon.
Heather M.,"Sun City, CA",0,10,,5.0,7/15/2017,"This is a busy place, but worth the wait. The staff is friendly, the food is very good and Brian the weekend bartender is the BEST!!!!"

Tara M.,"Menifee, CA",54,13,2,5.0,2/24/2017,"I am updating my review, the food and service here is always great.  I did have an order for pickup that wasn't ready on time.   The manager went above and beyond and comped BOTH meals, which definite wasn't called for!!"
Nadyne L.,"Menifee, CA",0,16,,5.0,6/27/2017,"Lately our trips here have been GOOD.  We have had bad experiences in the past, mostly it was very very poor service and one time we had to walk out as no one came to serve us for over 20 minutes.  It was late at night and not busy.  I didn't get it. BUT - the last few visits were excellent.  I love everything I order and so does my husband.  We come very often, as it is open late and is convenient after church.  They also have a huge variety in their menu, so we can have a snack to a full-on-meal.  BJ's is one of our top favorite choices.   I hope they keep a watch on their servicing customers - it's SO important!"
David S.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",2,31,140,4.0,4/30/2016,"After a super rough start and almost losing my appetite due to the frustration of poor service, manager Chris was able to come by and talk to me like a real person and truly empathetic about my experience. After spending only a few moments with Chris my appetite for some good BJ's food was back. Thank you Chris for turning my dining experience around to a great evening with my beautiful pregnant wife and wonderful son.  I've always believed its not always how you start but how you finish..."
T T.,"Hemet, CA",0,10,2,4.0,5/20/2017,"We always love coming to BJ's but the other week was an exceptionally great experience for us. It was a typical busy weekend night and we were placed on a wait. We started talking with one of the supervisors (I think) her name was Kelly.? (Long blonde hair) Despite how young she looks, she was incredibly professional and held herself with such poise and seriousness for her job. She assured us we would be sat soon and we felt that even though there were plenty of unhappy guests, she kept her composure and made sure she was doing everything she could. We were very impressed with her, and now will come back just so we can talk with her. We never got a chance to compliment her to a manager but we want to let them know how thrilled we are that they hired such a wonderful employee.  Oh and the food was great as always!! :)"
Nj S.,"Corona, CA",4,9,1,2.0,6/18/2017,"Came here for fathers daay dinner. I'm assuming they were very busy throughout the day because it seems like they were out of key ingridients. They made some odd substitutions on my order without checking with me first. The service was pretty poor and the food wasn't very good. I don't know ehat happened to Bjs, it used to be pretty good."
Marco L.,"Menifee, CA",12,10,,5.0,6/16/2017,Our waiter was Nick.  His service was amazing.  Not only was the food exceptional but it came out promptly and his level of service made the entire experience worth it.  That is one waiter that must make a lot on tips.  Everything f was great.
Victor G.,"Perris, CA",20,16,,1.0,6/15/2017,Order a premium steak was cooked horribly. No apology or comp for a busy kitchen who can't manage a grill on a Thursday night.
Michelle J.,"Fresno, CA",4,19,,5.0,4/20/2017,"Great food, excellent service. Love their menu, so much delicious options. Love the stuffed mushrooms!"
Steven B.,"Murrieta, CA",55,2,,1.0,9/25/2017,"I brought my wife and three kids in and the service was poor,  the food was very slow to come out,  the food was not good at all and they had employees sitting and friends tables talking load with bad language for everyone to hear."
Randy N.,"Tustin, CA",4,44,4,1.0,8/19/2017,"I see we are not alone in our bad experience here. I don't even live in the area but took a family member to dinner here, party of 3. We got on the list for a table with 45 minute wait but found an open table in the middle of the bar area. We agreed amongst our party we would be fine to eat in there. However the staff walked by us so many times, didn't greet us, no one helped us or acknowledged us. It was ridiculous. We were passed by at least 5 employees and totally ignored. By the time a server asked if we had been helped, it was at least 20-30 mins later and we decided the service would be bad in there so we waited for our table instead. It gets worse from there. Service was slow, server seemed overwhelmed. Normal non-alcoholic drinks took forever and refills didn't happen throughout meal. They cost 2.95 each so it would be nice to get the refills. Our pizza came out but we hadn't received our salads. The pizza wasn't cut all the way through so the server tried to help and ended up forcing the spatula along the semi cuts and pulling all the toppings and cheese along with the spatula. The pizza looked terrible after she did this. We were hungry so we ate it. The manager came and said the salads would be on the house, which was a nice gesture. The salads finally came out but mine had no dressing on it nor on the side. I waited another 15-20 mins to be able to ask for it and even after telling the server I didn't receive it until we were done with our pizza. We came to celebrate a bday and told the server that. She said we would get a free pizookie for that person. We got it but it was not free - it was on our bill. We had been there so long that I just paid for it and we left. The dinner probably took almost 3 hours. No wonder the wait is so long. Not the service and food quality I would expect from years of going to BJs. Good thing this is not my BJs. I will never come here again."
