Amy H.,"Fayetteville, NC",106,64,147,4.0,9/26/2017,"I've been to BJ's before in Columbus but the only memorable thing were the pizookies. Pizookies are freshly baked cookies topped with toppings such as ice cream, caramel, chocolate chips, etc. The toppings depend on the pizookie you choose.  I loved the atmosphere. They have lighting on the shelves behind the bar where the alcohol bottles sit. They have their own brewed beers. I was excited to see they also had A cider - berry burst cider. It was light and refreshing. Not too sour and not too sweet - just perfect for my palate.   We had the spinach stuffed mushrooms, broccoli cheddar soup, Mahi mahi tacos with fries, brisket bacon burger with honey Sirracha Brussels sprouts, and salted Carmel pizookie for dessert. The mushrooms were a great starter. The soup was ok I actually prefer Paneras broccoli cheddar. The fries I LOVED! Double fried ... crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Great burger, good tacos and Brussels sprouts! Make sure you save room for dessert!"
Kristen M.,"Mentor, OH",12,174,419,3.0,12/26/2017,"12/17: UPDATE We came at lunch and had an enjoyable experience. Our server Rob was personable and attentive. The food runners brought our food out while it was still fresh and then multiple staff hurried to get us anything we were missing. Our glasses were kept full. Hopefully this place has turned the corner and I'm raising my rating. My burger patty was made too thin and wasn't holding together because of that fact. Pieces were crumbling off when I picked it up. The other two burgers at our table were much thicker with integrity enough to eat. The flavor of the burger was excellent and I appreciate they obviously make them fresh. The soft buns were perfect and fresh. I wish they'd offer fresh cut fries instead of frozen. Great job on improving the service! 4/17: UPDATE I'm disappointed to not be able to change my rating on this restaurant. They've been open now in this location long enough to work out the kinks. While the food is somewhat unique and a lot of it is good, it's not all good and the service is still VERY poor! We sat at the bar on this visit during happy hour. We had to flag down the bar tender every time we needed to order something. The menus were sticky between every page! The sliders were small (with about 1/3 of the bun empty), boring (only a tiny patty and a couple pickle slices and shredded iceberg on the side), and dry and we needed to ask for ketchup to make them worth eating. The potato skins were decent, but didn't come out hot. The root beer wings were good. Tried their German beer this time and enjoyed that. I just cannot believe the number of staff they have on and how hard it is to get any of their attention!"
Cody Z.,"Willoughby, OH",0,13,,3.0,9/12/2017,"It is Hit or Miss with this Place,Either you will get a great waitress and horrible cooks to mess up your food or you will get an annoying waitress that ignores you and the food will come out decent. Rib night is a deal,the spicy Brussel sprouts are the best. Pizza night is worth it if the cooks actual cook it right and don't take 40 mins to cook sauce less burnt cheesy bread. The chicken sandwiches and burgers are pretty good."
Arianna W.,"Cleveland, OH",3,27,99,5.0,11/29/2017,"The first time I went on Saturday it was just average. The burger I had was ok but the fries were great. Everybody's meal was average. Got a gift card and decided to combine it with the $10 off $35 deal they have going on. I went back with my sister last night just to use the gift card. Initially I was only going to get the beignet since that's the one thing I did enjoy during my first visit, but I saw the pizza on the menu and decided I would give it a try. The pizza I had was greeeeaattt! I can't wait to go back I've been craving it ever since I left. My sister got the ahi poke and salad and she really liked her food this time as well."
Jenn G.,"Mentor, OH",87,130,83,5.0,4/30/2017,"I will totally admit I am usually not a chain restaurant person.  In fact for years I abhorred chains; there are some now though that I think actively know that and work to set themselves apart.  For me BJ's was one of those.  The hubs and I went on a Friday afternoon we were off from work and took the lil McDuo... now most servers see one kid and freak out let alone two toddlers our server didn't do that she was amazing.  Sabrina immediately said ""can I get you a starter for them?"" which was a garlic knot and fruit - keep them occupied stop the screaming and let us look at the menu.  We had come in for the soup and salad lunch special - different soups different salads and you can swap each round. Totally awesome idea and lets you try more of their signature dishes.   The wedge salad possibly one of the best wedge salads I've ever had.  House salad OK not remarkable need some kick; I don't know cheese bacon egg something... The soups the chicken tortilla it was delicious and garnished awesomely with sliced avocado.  The cheddar broccoli delicious very cheesy not a lot of broccoli.  My husband loved the clam chowder in fact he had two bowls said it was delicious creamy & lots of clams. The tomato bisque was good very tomato he needed a grilled cheese dip in! Lol.  Also they have a kids menu and a bigger kids menu - perfect for two littles to split! The grilled chicken and mashed potatoes was a hit!  Their beers that we sampled were good - the brown ale, the Belgian, the fruity cider - all delicious. We didn't try the pizza but we will be back and we will ask for Sabrina! To be sure.  Thank you BJs crew!"
dale v.,"Mentor, OH",105,14,6,2.0,12/13/2017,"This is one of these types of restaurants that when they get busy they seriously don't pay attention to customers.. first time we went it was a decent experience and food came out somewhat quick.. the last time I went food took a good 45 minutes to an hour.. and I ordered a simple Pizza nothing spectacular.. an our waitress was absolutely horrible... She came to check on our table once... That's right in 45 minutes she came over to our table once,.. and it wasn't even for drinks.. probably not going to go there for quite a while"
John B.,"Mentor, OH",49,73,57,5.0,9/29/2016,"Went for dinner with my wife and son for his birthday. Asked server for beer recommendations and he suggested one for each. Spot on!  Each of us has different dinners from a huge menu, with a salad for one to baked pasta for another and to a bacon burger. Each one drew raves! Finished up with a peanut butter s'mores desert, called a Poozkie, which was perfect for three.  There is a wait, but load their app, call ahead and get bonus!  Will be back since there beer selection combines there house brews and a good cross section of others."
Ms T.,"Mentor, OH",0,18,5,4.0,10/22/2017,Food tastes good.....once we got some silverware.  I had to ask twice after the food was served.  I ordered the shrimp and asparagus pene.  There is very little asparagus and a half dozen shrimp.  My friend's  spaghetti and meatballs looks good.  Server is friendly.
Beckie B.,"Madison, OH",18,11,3,1.0,12/10/2017,"This rating is strictly regarding the hostesses Sunday December 10 at about 4pm. Rudest hostesses EVER! No ""Hi, welcome to BJ's"" not even a ""How many, please"" and then one just grabbed some menus and proceeded to walk away. No ""Follow me, please.""  Set the menus on the table. Never said a word. No ""Enjoy your meal"" Basically no acknowledgment at all for these two. Only sour or stoic looks. Need to train your hostesses BJ's. The ones we encountered would have been fired from my establishment."
Toni W.,"Chardon, OH",1,63,18,5.0,11/20/2017,"We have been to this Mentor location several times and have always been greeted promptly to be seated.  Service and food has always been top rated! You will find no other menu as extensive as BJ's!  There's something for everyone!  Our favorites are the Ahi Tuna Poke or Nashville Hot Wings for an appetizer.  For dinners we love the Ribeye, the Ahi Tuna Salad, New Shrimp and Arugula Tacos, and the New Orleans Jambalaya!  Their burgers are great, too! You cannot leave without a Pizookie!  The Salted Caramel is the bomb!!!"
Glenn S.,"Painesville, OH",1,60,28,5.0,12/6/2017,"Great food, been there a few times, and I will be back. Menu has great selections and the staff hustled"
Mary W.,"Beachwood, OH",42,3,,3.0,12/2/2017,"The one in Columbus is awesome! So we were excited that they were opening one here! Quality was great at first, but has gone downhill.  Food isn't quite as tasty and much to my disappointment, they changed their fries.  They used to be thin and crispy and were a must have every time I ate there. Now they are thicker and mushy.  They are fine but nothing amazing about them.  They also changed their point system, causing us to lose 300+ points.  They never followed up after we complained."
Terri W.,"Painesville, OH",54,5,1,3.0,11/30/2017,Everytime I go I wait at least 10 mins to be acknowledged and seated with no one else in front of me. The food is good and the drinks but staff need to give better service.
Todd G.,"Painesville, OH",298,263,209,3.0,12/22/2016,I went to the BJ's in Polaris Columbus Ohio and it was pretty much the same as this one. The food really isn't all that bad it was exceptionally busy because of the Christmas season and this restaurant is positioned right near the mall which makes it getting into and out of pretty challenging at times. Our issue wasn't with the food but rather the service. I did order a buffalo chicken wrap which they said they didn't have but they did offer to make me one I thought okay awesome this is sweet these guys are going to make me something that's not on the menu. However what came out was a chicken parmesan style pita pocket thing which was absolutely delicious none-the-less but it wasn't what I ordered. No it was lunch and are servicing to you a little bit frazzled but my main reason for three stars was that the entire time I was there there were stacks of dirty plates that would never bussed off of the table.   As our lunch when on the stack of dirty plates just got higher and higher and higher almost humorous. It's several different points we did see the server come by and look at the stack of dirty plates and just keep walking. For now just three stars I'm willing to come back and try it again because the food was actually pretty decent.
Matt N.,"Wickliffe, OH",0,7,,2.0,5/2/2017,"I've worked in restaurants my whole life, so I'm a very easy going diner.  I understand that things get busy, people make mistakes, all of that. Even if the service sucks on a particular night, I understand. Just because a server is backed up or running behind, I tip well.  My server tonight did not deserve anything.  I was dead set on giving her $0 for her unpleasant b***h attitude but when she came with the check, I chickened out and gave her a few dollars because I still felt bad that servers don't make much.  My wife and I were sat at 7:12.  At 7:27, our server came to our table and said she'd be right with us.  At 7:36, she said she was dealing with a large party and that's why we had to wait so long.  I thought that was a crappy excuse, but whatever.  I'm cool, no worries, all that. We each ordered a soda and burgers, and I got a side salad. That was the last we saw of our server until she gave us the check. At 7:52, we got our sodas.  At 7:56, I got my side salad.  At 7:59, I got tired of waiting for someone who worked there to pass by, so I went to the front counter to get the silverware we were never given. I didn't check the time when we got our food but it was around 8:10.  The burgers were super good. Their burger sauce they had is ridiculously delicious. Then we waited for the check until 8:20.  We had assumed our server had gone home and we were just a forgotten table that food runners were taking care of but then our server we hadn't seen for half an hour showed up and asked if we wanted dessert. We sure did! The reason I wanted to go there tonight was specifically for those Pizookie things. Unfortunately, the service was so slow, we didn't have time to order them. We had already been there for over an hour and didn't have an hour to waste on waiting for dessert. When we told her we didn't have time for dessert she said ""Are you suuuure"" in a super condescending tone.  What the hell did we do to you, lady? It's a shame but my wife and I both agreed that we weren't coming back.  I know that's what customers say when they are annoyed and trying to make the manager or owner feel bad, knowing full well that they are going to come back in the future.  I'm not just saying that for attention.  This is the second time we've been to BJ's and the second time we've received poor service.   Bye bye, BJ's Brewhouse."
Ginny H.,"Mentor, OH",131,1,,5.0,10/7/2017,We've had Danielle as our bartender/server multiple times and she's always on her game. She's very attentive and chatty but aware of others. She's probably the best.
Danielle P.,"Cleveland, OH",1,200,3,4.0,6/17/2017,"Good beer - had a flight, liked all of them - tried the Piranha Ale, Brewhouse Blonde and Berry Cider. Nice lineup of different beers.  Ordered large pizza for table on Monday - large pizzas are half off - good deal. We had cheese only pizza and is was pretty good. I would order it again. Side salads are very small! It is not worth the $4/5 for one.  Waitress was friendly and service was good.  Menu has a lot of variety - nice addition to Mentor."
Harry H.,"Eastlake, OH",0,22,,4.0,10/17/2017,Went on a Friday had reservations for 8pm for 2 people. Still waited 30 mins for a table. Got the Brussels sprouts for appetizer. Tasted pretty good but were kind of over cooked. Alex was our server and he was great. Answered all of our questions etc. I had the Jalapeño Burger it was cooked to my liking and tasted very good. Girl had the tacos she liked them. Dessert was a pizookie a cookie w ice cream on top. It's was really good.
Mark H.,"Chesterland, OH",23,21,14,5.0,6/22/2017,"Honey Siracha Brussel Sprouts are a must. Great beer, great staff, wonderful experience. Jambalaya is awesome!"
Andy C.,"Mentor, OH",5,15,12,4.0,9/11/2016,"We're so lucky here in Lake County - we have just about every kind of restaurant. And BJ's is an okay addition. If you're a beer drinker with a group of friends and want something better than Fridays... then you found the spot. Atmosphere is benign if not boring. Seating and decor are nothing special and will feel like every other restaurant on the planet. Let's remember, before we rip them a new one, that the place is new and the staff is too. So yes... there was a little slowness even at 4:30pm. And when our waitress asked if we were ready my husband said simply, ""Yes"" and she smiled at him and walked away. There were definite hold ups at the POS stations. Which is expected at this stage of the game - people are learning. BIG alcohol selection. And I do not drink. So I tried their ""Botanical Blend"" Peach Sunrise. Not bad. Hubby had black cherry root beer- GREAT flavor. Appetizer was spinach stuff mushrooms. MUCH better than Olive Gardens version of same. Not served dripping in oil and grease, with a little bit of cream sauce finish. But holy crap... let's talk menu size. Gordon Ramsey would marinara his pants... waaaaay too many options. Dinner was Jambalaya for me with a cup of chilli (my weakness) and hubby had deep dish ziti. Chilli was thick, meaty with a great flavor from the beer that's in it. LOVE IT. Jambalaya was one note... and would not stand up to anyone's creole Gram's recipe. It was well cooked. Just no biggie. Hubby said ziti was 4 stars out of 5. He actually ate the whole thing which never happens. With tip we spent  $60. In the end, we'd go back. I'd seriously get take out of just that chilli to be honest... in a bread bowl... score! Give them time to grow. They'll put Max and Erma's under for sure."
Dwayne L.,"Cleveland, OH",20,56,29,4.0,4/29/2017,"We've been here a few times and we've never had a bad experience. Our server tonight was fantastic. She was very attentive and the food was brought out hot and quick. Very nice decor for a brew house and a nice place for a date night. Noise level is a little high when it's busy but other than that, great place."
Maya P.,"Mentor, OH",23,3,6,3.0,9/10/2017,A little pricey for what you get. Some of the wait staff seems a bit flighty.. had to order my drink 3 times before she finally brought it over.
C.T. C.,"Geneva, OH",16,63,10,3.0,9/7/2017,Food was better but service was worse. Never received a refill on coffee. Had to ask twice for Sweet & Low and gluten-free menu. Guess what? A month later & the gluten-free menus are still missing! Do they even really exist? I'm at the point where I'll object to dining here if this place is busy.
Julie M.,"Kirtland, OH",27,20,8,1.0,1/21/2017,"I tried to come on a Friday night at 6PM on a Friday night with a party of 3. Call ahead wait was 80 minutes so my party and I decided to go elsewhere after we called back and found out that we weren't even put on the list.  We tried again tonight with a call ahead wait of 30-40 minutes. What they don't tell you is that the call ahead wait is just putting your name on the list. Your actual wait time starts when you check in at the hostess stand. Okay. No big deal. Except that 30 to 40 minutes has turned into over an hour. Larger and smaller parties who arrived after mine were seated much faster than mine. I understand that it's a Saturday night but it's a little ridiculous.  We went over after waiting for over an hour and we come to find out that when we called ahead to put our name in, we weren't even on the list. How is it that when I called ahead and checked in with my name and phone number upon arrival as instructed they somehow lost my information? Service was good but overall slow. Our server was great but it another 45+ minutes to bring out a salad and 2 burgers. The fries that came with the burgers were cold as if they had been sitting at the pass for a while so our server had them replaced with hot, fresh fries. The food was nothing to write home about.  If you are expecting fast service, this is definitely not the place to come. We definitely will not be back as we have better service elsewhere."
Rich R.,"Madison, OH",61,55,66,5.0,3/7/2017,Have been to this location 3-4 times now and things have got better each time. I try not to review new establishments everyone needs some time to find good dedicated staff and to work all bugs out. They have been open 7 months now so things should be close by now. Spoke with the GM and they are still working out some bugs but things are getting better. We attended the Guinness beer tasting event the Food and service was excellent. This was the first tasting so they needed to work out some bugs but nothing occurred which would make me lower my rating.  The GM ran the tasting and came in on his day off to do so he seems really vested in the success of facility.  Remember it is Mentor and you need to expect to wait for some time if you go on a weekend. I recommend a week day evening or for lunch when you can walk right in.  I also recommend the  fried artichoke hearts as an appetizer.  Two out of our party of three stated before they tasted them they do not like artichokes.  You know where this is going not one left on anyone's plate. Would definitely order again
Stace H.,"Cleveland, OH",18,22,,2.0,3/16/2017,"Another chain restaurant my friends - in the chain restaurant capital city of Mentor. The beers and beer selection are great.  The menu is actually good, but the food verrrrry salty.  Usually so crowded, you may have to go down the street to one of the other many chains."
Brian S.,"Elburn, IL",3,8,,1.0,8/29/2017,"We went here twice in one week, and will never go back. First time our server forgot about us during our meal and we had to go find her. Food was cold and tasteless. Second time we were seated and sat for 15 minutes with no one coming to the table. I asked the hostess to flag down a waiter/waitress, and she also said she would send the manager over. Manager never came over, and took 20 minutes to actually get service. People seated next to us got up and left because they were so frustrated. Food isn't good. Burgers are tiny with tons of bun (bread is cheap, meat is not). Drinks are mediocre. NOTHING justifies the price, let alone the awful service. Never again."
David K.,"Columbus, OH",148,3,1,1.0,12/22/2016,"Sorry, BJ's, I think we need to end this relationship. You're beautiful and you cook good food, but you're service makes me feel like you just don't care about me.  In the theme of Festivus, below are my grievances: 1) The app's ""Preferred Waitlist"" is misleading. I logged in from home, added myself to the wait list and received a time of 25 minutes. I check-in and am told it will be 25 minutes, ok, fine, I'm already there. 50 minutes later, after speaking to a manager, we're seated. Either they quote you a lower time to keep you from leaving, when they know it'll be a longer wait, or the process is broken.  I had to wait to speak with the manager because someone else was also complaining about their ""Preferred Waitlist"" experience.  2) Since we had 50 minutes to decide on our food, we ordered immediately upon sitting down.  By checking-in with the app, I was able to track my ticket time by seeing the exact moment the order was entered. Ticket time: 40 minutes. Unacceptable for pizza, breaded chicken and kids pasta. After a bad service experience on my previous visit, I received a survey directly from BJ's corporate. I completed it and was provided a $15 coupon (as an apology) for a future visit, so we decided to give it another shot. Sorry, there are systemic service failures at this restaurant.  This place has potential but they better hurry up before others give up on them too."
Joshua G.,"Mentor, OH",0,4,1,1.0,2/4/2017,"Fast service and terrible food with mediocre beer. As an exercise in capitalism, BJ's is an interesting concept. As food and beverage, it is awful. Dry, over-cooked food service burgers and overly-bitter microbrews are the order of the day here.  Skip this if you're looking for, well, anything.  It was packed though, so maybe folks dig the ambiance of hundreds of people packed ass-to-elbows while being subjected to a 90s on 9 playlist."
Bubba R.,"Painesville, OH",35,3,,5.0,8/21/2017,"I went here with my grandma and brother, and we had a great time. The waitress was extremely friendly and check on us constantly to make sure we were doing good. We also talked to one of the managers because we had some questions about the store chain, and he was very informative and seemed to really like the history of the restaurant. The food and beer were great, I will definitely be coming back."
Lisa S.,"Cleveland, OH",0,16,,3.0,9/7/2017,"Our waitress was very friendly but she neglected to bring us silverware with our appetizer. We tried to catch someone's eye but no luck. When our meal came we requested silverware which arrived quickly. My bison burger was good but they put a slaw/salad on the plate with hardly any dressing. I left most of the ""salad."" Unless they improve this salad they might as well omit it. My daughter ordered the seared ahi tuna salad. She's had it elsewhere and thought it was just okay here. It only included 2 pieces of avocado.  Like others have said I wouldn't suggest this place but I also wouldn't turn down a return visit. The atmosphere is great and with a few improvements it could be a really great restaurant."
Brittany L.,"Brooklyn, NY",161,21,12,1.0,10/24/2017,"We've passed this location a thousand times and finally decided to try it.. besides our server being friendly, and the dessert being good, there really wasn't any other perk. For an appetizer, we ordered the fried brussel sprouts, which arrived stone cold, like they actually just came out of the refrigerator. For dinner, I ordered the quinoa bowl with salmon. It was good, (hot at least) but not anything memorable. My fiancé ordered the BBQ Brisket burger, medium rare. The burger was cooked to well done, and yet the sweet potato fries we [also] cold. We had already sent back the appetizer, so we didn't send anything else back, plus we were starving. The manager never came to our table, did not apologize for our awful appetizer (though it was taken off the bill), and never asked how our experience was. The pizzoki (pizza/ cookie) dessert was good but not good enough to make up for our awful dinner/ experience. First and last time at this location!"
Lawrence B.,"Chesterland, OH",0,55,,4.0,1/18/2017,We tried the burgers.i had a port Bella and my friend had bacon cheese burger  Both were made with perfection. The fries were crisp and plentiful. Our server was on the  ball in all aspevts.what a different good experience
Tamera M.,"Woodmere, OH",50,2,,2.0,8/12/2017,Wear a sweater! They have this place set to sub zero! Food was just ok. Service was awesome.
Jasmine C.,"Euclid, OH",1,9,1,3.0,3/13/2017,The first time we came here I was blown away. We had the best waitress ever. She was so nice and informative and everything was perfect. I really enjoyed our first visit. Our next visit was just ok a couple problems but the manger fixed them. He is a very nice guy. I just wish we had our last waitress. I didn't appreciate the fact I asked for the pick two lunch special and she didn't tell me it was unlimited. I had to ask about the unlimited refills after we received our bill. But she fixed everything. I just really like our previous waitress.
Ryan M.,"Cleveland, OH",0,90,19,4.0,11/16/2016,"Second time here, wanted to make sure it was as good as I originally thought, and not just because it was new. Yupp, I found second time to be just as good.  Came here for lunch with wife, pretty good lunch menu. 2 beers 2 sandwiches  1 app $30 not bad!  -App: Queso  and chips is great, they also refil chips. - Both of us had the buffalo chicken 5 cheese sandwich, fantastic, plenty of fries - Pumpkin beer is smooth, and Red ale just as good ill be here again To the managers, I recommend putting in a patio for the summer, I truly feel this place will be dead in summer if one is not installed, People like to drink beer outside!"
Maggie K.,"Willoughby, OH",170,3,,5.0,5/4/2017,"I love this place!! Amazing pizza, Endless menu and such great drinks. My absolute favorite though is the pizookie!! It is always crowded so I do the call a head seating"
Missy P.,"Tampa, FL",291,7,34,5.0,12/30/2016,I usually always order the Ahi salad which is fabulous.   I ordered the shrimp with soba noodles.   It's a cold dish and was really good.   They have a rewards program.
Dennis C.,"Painesville, OH",56,178,4,2.0,11/20/2016,"Anytime a new place opens in Mentor it's slammed for the first couple months. Expect about a 45 minute wait. I'll start with the positives. Service, our waiter was great. Space, I really liked the open layout and windows. Decor was cool. Now the negatives: beer, didn't like their home brew. Food: my steak was overcooked and tough. My wife didn't like her seared ahi, dry. Rice, oily. Caesar salad, bland. Queso dip, think baseball concession stand. I hate to give two stars but I can't give three because we're not going back. As my wife said, ""Not worth the money."""
Kerry K.,"Euclid, OH",25,67,112,5.0,3/21/2017,We have been here a lot. Lol. Every time we come we enjoy another entrée. They have homemade root beer and other cool products that are homemade as well as a magnificent amount of different beers. Please save room for your favorite dessert Pizookie. It is always busy and a bit load but the food and beverages are worth it. Make sure u use there app to checkin in before you leave for the Resturant.
