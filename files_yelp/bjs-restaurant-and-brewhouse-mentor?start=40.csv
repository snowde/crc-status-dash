L S.,"Painesville, OH",0,7,,1.0,4/30/2017,"Had dinner on a Saturday night and it was awful.  I ordered the tuna salad which was the special and they forgot half the ingredients, when I mentioned it to the waitress she didn't seem to care and laughed !  My boyfriend got the lemon thyme chicken which looked so good on the menu but it looked like mush on a plate and the rice wasn't cooked  Yuck !!"
Richelle G.,"Cleveland, OH",90,23,44,5.0,11/19/2016,I love this restaurant...and I cant wait to go back. The food and beers were so good. The menu delivers a wide range. I am certainly happy northeast ohio now has a BJ's.
Anthony G.,"Taunton, MA",1,7,,2.0,9/14/2016,Service is very slow.  Booths are small and therefore uncomfortable for larger people.  Caesar salad with grilled chicken was unoriginal and just blah and ok   I would have gotten a burger but they're all served with shoestring  (McDonald's) fries.  I do believe this restaurant will last less than 2 years.
Leo M.,"Eastlake, OH",65,105,54,4.0,9/11/2016,"Great place awesome menu portions could be bigger but quality is perfect. Reviews are only a tool and i never base where i go off what others say but this is worth giving it a shot, we will be back many times"
Marybeth G.,"Willoughby, OH",0,1,,5.0,10/9/2017,We went for dinner Thurs 10/5 and had a wonderful dinner and GREAT service. The menu has something for everyone and our meals were fresh and delicious. The Brussel sprouts were especially good!  Our servers Blaire and Kristen were so pleasant and very attentive. I will certainly return soon!!
Bob B.,"Mentor, OH",3,12,6,4.0,9/5/2016,"Forgive me Dr. Robert Atkins, for I have sinned...again.  It's a temporary setback, but I simply couldn't help myself.  You see, I just went to the new BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse in Mentor, OH.   My wife and I attempted to visit the new BJ's on a Friday but were greeted with the 'ol ""thanks for coming we can seat you in about 3 days"" nugget.   Given it was already about 2 hours since my last beer, we had to move on...stat.   On Labor Day my wife offered to take me to lunch if I'd go shopping with her.  In a moment of weakness I succumbed to the Siren Song of a free meal.  ""Let's try that salad place!"" she exclaimed.  The childlike look of dejection on my face was enough for her to suggest we try BJ's again.  I love this woman. Ambiance - Although it's a brand new building it has the air of an old open brick warehouse converted to a restaurant.  When you walk in the entire eating area is visible.  To left is the lengthy, stylish and well-stocked bar.  The back lit display of top shelf bourbons and a bar's length craft beer handles was particularly appealing. To the right is seating featuring what I can only describe as ""The Garage Doors to Nowhere"".  You'll see what I mean.  The seating is ample, but not crowded, and the faux oversized crown molding on the back wall above the Fenway Park Green Monster sized beer list make for cozy atmosphere.  Vertically the place opens all the way up to the roof with all the supports and mechanicals stylishly exposed to the patrons.  All in all a very good venue to strap on the feedbag..! Service - The service peeps were very friendly and enthusiastic if not a tad inexperienced (to be expected).  Once they get their sea legs they'll be just fine.  They were overstaffed which I attribute to training but it wasn't overwhelming.  There were some awkward moments when I had specific questions about the food prep and menu, but no biggie.  It would have been nice to be made aware the Monday special was  1/2 priced large pizza.  I ordered the mini but discovered on my own that the large would have cost the same.  I was able to change the order in time to take advantage (and have leftovers for 3 days).  We were well attended to throughout the meal.  The service certainly shouldn't be a deterrent to trying BJ's.  I expect it to be well above average in a few weeks. Food & Beverage - Sometimes craft beer places let their kegs get a little stale.  However, my GLB Dortmunder and my wife's Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Ale tasted very fresh and were perfectly chilled and carbonated.  We started with the Calamari appetizer.  It wasn't bad but maybe lacked a little taste.  I liked that it was fried a little crispier... my wife not so much.  I ordered the large Spicy Hawaiian deep dish pizza.  This, and the beer, is where I fell off the low carb wagon...hard.  The large is ""large"" and the deep dish is ""deep""!  The dough/crust is very thick and bready like a deep dish should be.  The crust was perfectly crispy on the edges and had a distinct buttery taste. The toppings were fresh, tasty and plentiful.  It could easily feed 3-4 adults to their gluttonous satisfaction.  I have no idea what my wife ate I was too busy with my head buried in the trough.   Value - When I mean value I mean when the quality/enjoyment of the experience meets with the cost of the experience.  My impression was the cost was a tad high. I'd say 15% to 20% more than a comparable eating experience.  However, I think it's a good value considering all the factors.   Bottom Line - Go to BJ's!  It may be hard to get in during peak times for while but give it go.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.  It's definitely a place I'd take out of town guest to show off Mentor, OH a little or to celebrate any special occasion."
Kendra L.,"Cleveland, OH",3,2,9,5.0,6/2/2017,"My mother and I went for lunch at about 2 PM. We walked right in and was immediately seated. The restaurant was very nice, open and clean. My mother and I both ordered the southern fried chicken, it was amazing! The portions were on the smaller side but very filling. We spent under $20 for the both of us. We will definitely be recommending this place to others and coming back again!"
Jessie K.,"Willoughby, OH",10,2,1,5.0,9/6/2016,Did not know I like Brussels sprouts . Yes if you haven't heard BJs by the Big Dicks has some great cocktails.
Adam R.,"Cleveland, OH",34,35,7,2.0,12/30/2016,"The beer here is very good, I made sure to try a few different ones and they were all high quality. However the service level of the staff was not very good and for the price of the food it was no better than ordering at a chain restaurant for double the price. I will not be back anytime soon."
Rob G.,"Lawrenceville, GA",27,24,6,2.0,1/4/2017,"Beer selection was better than your local bar , but it was definitely limited. They have about 8 in house beers which are well advertised but not very good and with what ever taps are left over they squeeze in some other nationals , stone IPA, Stella Guinness . If your a craft beer drinker don't expect to be impressed. Food was par, not great but not bad. The reason for the two stars was the server, slow and I was extremely disappointed at her lack of knowledge about beer... this is a brew house ... and I'm educating her on the product they serve. Educate your people they are the face of your company."
Dave C.,"Cleveland, OH",123,33,143,5.0,1/14/2017,"Was feeling hungry so I stopped in for a brew and some pizza. I had heard that this chain's claim to fame was its deep dish pizza, but the restaurant was so busy I decided to try a flatbread appetizer instead to save time. While waiting for the food I had a flight of 4 house beers. Interestingly, the beer is not brewed on premises; rather, it is trucked in from out-of-state in kegs. The Lightswitch Lager, Piranha Pale, Oasis Amber & Hopstorm IPA were all very good indeed. The pizza arrived in about 10 minutes and was fresh, hot & tasty. The bartender was very knowledgeable about the house brews as well as the guest taps and was very friendly and engaging considering how busy the bar was. The menu is extensive and offers something for everyone; moreover,  there is a full bar if beer is not for you. One final note is that I did approve that the bar & restaurant area are well-separated, kids don't need to see people at the bar drinking. Overall a very good visit....cheers!"
Kelly R.,"Cleveland, OH",102,344,7,5.0,2/26/2017,"There was NOTHING bad about this visit.  I usually am not a fan of chain restaurants, but we were in the area and decided to stop in.  We arrived at 3ish on a Saturday afternoon, the restaurant was sufficiently full, but we were seated and greeted, right away.  Our server approached and explained some of the specialty items, such as their handcrafted sodas and pizzas.  We proceeded to order, potato skins as an appetizer.  I ordered the Shrimp Quinoa bowl with a side of Brussel sprouts.  My daughter ordered deep dish pizza and my husband ordered the chicken club sandwich with fries.  The potato skins arrived a short time later, huge portion, definitely large enough to share.  There was a side of ranch dressing, as well as sour cream.  Our entrees arrived shortly thereafter.   My bowl, contained brown rice, mixed with quinoa, topped with roasted tomatoes, wilted spinach, mushrooms and a generous portion of seasoned shrimp.  The portion was more than sufficient and it was simply delicious.   The Brussel sprouts were really good, seasoned nicely with cracked black pepper and undertones of lemon....delicious.  My husband and daughter enjoyed their meals, as well.  I can't wait to return!"
Heather A.,"Kirtland, OH",31,45,,5.0,3/16/2017,"Great addition to the Mentor restaurant options, but very busy! Call ahead - Menu is great and extensive - OK to visit on a diet too.. Many no carb options, etc...  Great service too!"
Richard G.,"Willowick, OH",2,100,76,5.0,9/5/2016,This is a great place the beer selection is awesome we love is place so excited they built one close to us everything is great but my all time fav is the Hickory burger it is moist and well cooked with ample fries.the bread bowl chile is to die for. I can say enough great things and I rarely give five stars. But do call head seating and oh yea you can pay from the app and. Not have to wait around for the back and forth crap with the bill
Marcia S.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,5,,5.0,9/3/2017,Thank you to our great server Angela H. and the other staff members for making my mom's 80th birthday celebration a success!
Nunya B.,"Lewisville, TX",0,8,,1.0,11/30/2016,"I used to work here, so you guys have an inside perspective. I'll start with the food. It is very good, except the burgers. They taste no better than Burger King's flame broiled burgers. I recommend the flat bread pizzas, or their salads are great and big portions (the Santa Fe is BOMB). There are a ton of very healthy options too, but they get expensive, like the salmon quinoa bowl. As for the service, it is very iffy and hit or miss. Some people who serve there are wonderful people! But many of them are terribly rude, not only to fellow coworkers, but customers as well. The management is HORRIBLE. The general manger made a mistake at the expense of my table, and blamed me, and called me a ""f**king idiot"" because he didn't want to take responsibility for his mistake. It is also his job to make sure tables are okay, and every time I asked him to do something, he would be visibly aggravated, and tell me to find someone else to deal with it. I've worked in management before, and you DO NOT treat your employees that way. It is completely uncalled for. The other managers are okay, but unfortunately many of them have left because the environment is so toxic. And that is also why I left. It's difficult to be enthusiastic about your job when you are constantly belittled. The turnover rate for this restaurant is the worst I have ever seen. So, that has got to tell you something. It's really unfortunate because this is a great chain, and the company itself offers a lot of opportunity to move up, but I just couldn't stay in a job where I felt unappreciated and belittled on a daily basis. I hope they fix all the issues, because they're going to have a tough time keeping employees and customers at this rate. Also, the floors are extremely slippery. I don't recommend bringing older people here, who use a walker or cane. I've seen multiple customers fall, and one of them was an older gentleman. And the horrible management has no intention of fixing it, so please be careful if you go there!"
James K.,"Madison, OH",10,2,,3.0,4/23/2017,Lots of seating with good atmosphere.  Ordered the spinach stuffed mushrooms.  We were disappointed that they were the size of a quarter and not even close to the size shown on the menu.  The bartender was not friendly at all but was efficient.  I had the house IPA and the stout.  Both were great beers.
Lisa M.,"Willoughby, OH",1,15,10,2.0,4/23/2017,"Service was great! Sadly the kitchen was on the slow side. Went in at an off-time but the restaurant was still fairly busy. Sadly, it took 30 min for our appetizer to come out and it was overly greasy! Literally our potato skins were sitting in a puddle of grease. It was disappointing."
Tessa S.,"Midtown, Houston, TX",18,15,5,2.0,12/22/2016,"The food is good once you actually get a table. We've been here twice and even though we've used the app for ""preferred wait list"" (basically call ahead) we've had to wait more than an hour each time. The parking lot is extremely small, but it just prepares you for the cramped waiting area. A server passed around small slices of pizza in a feeble attempt to placate the many angry waiting guests. The concept and menu are great, but the execution is terribly lacking."
Jeff M.,"Mentor, OH",1,4,5,2.0,11/10/2016,"Been here a couple times. Very nice atmosphere. First time, ate in the bar area and the service was good. Good food and draft selection. Their own beer is just ok. Second time ate in the dining room- Service was poor. Had to ask for things multiple times. Seems like they still need to work out the kinks in their system."
