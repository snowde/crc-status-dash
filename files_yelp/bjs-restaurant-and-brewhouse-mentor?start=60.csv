Julianne P.,"Indianapolis, IN",14,14,5,1.0,12/10/2016,"Zero! I have been here 3 times now as I work across the street. One time I walked out because it was 11am when they opened and it took 20 min for a server to come over as I was in a huge hurry on my lunch break. The second time, I sat at the bar in hopes to get noticed quicker and I still waited a lengthy amount of time to be served a beverage, and the third and final time was the night before thanksgiving when the place was vacant at 10pm and I still waited 15 min to be greeted! Every time I was sat by a hostess (including the bar time) and I just can't say anything great about the service. The food is really good though from what iv had (sandwiches, pot skins, and the fried asparagus is to die for). Just need to be a little more picky when it comes to hiring, because these people are awful who wait on your customers!"
Francesco N.,"Mentor, OH",41,4,,4.0,9/2/2016,"Called at 12:30 to place a reservation only to find they don't take reservations for parties under 6. They offered me a ""call ahead"" and I set it for 7:30 that night. When I arrived at 7:30 they let me know there would be a wait and there was! We were finally sat at 8:30. Pleasantly surprised the food selection was great and the taste was worth the wait. They won my heart with the flavor and service. It was their first week so I cut them some slack. Bria was great! Friendly and easy to work with. Enjoyed her attention to detail and bubbly personality. Great job to Damien for taking care of my wife so promptly. He used words like ""right way"" And ""no problem"". Take notes fellow waiters/waitresses be of service and willing to go above and beyond for your patrons."
Stefany T.,"Painesville, OH",0,5,6,5.0,8/30/2016,This place was really good. Me and a friend were invited to a private opening for the new staff basically a training session. The menu is large lots to choose from. We ordered 2 appetizers the queso dip with pulled pork and the honey Sriracha Brussels sprouts they were AMAZING! We ordered 2 pizzas they were good not enough sauce but decent flavor. The best part of the meal was dessert their warm pizza cookies with ice cream has a wanting to go back for more. Overall delicious
James P.,"Wickliffe, OH",0,6,,1.0,10/5/2016,"TGIF Meets APPLEBEES. Don't bother going if you think its a Brewery, they think the beer is ""made"" in the back. They are over staffed and under trained. The pregnant hostess in the front is worthless and needs to stay off her phone, the whole kneeling down trick was not working.  With 8+ servers on at lunch and no defined sections, everyone is running around and has no time to give superior service. Please for the love of God help your servers out, give them sections maybe 3- 6 tables all in the same area, that was half the problem. And let them know when they get a new table if they are busy. It took 15 minutes for me to flag down a server, and then another 5 to get my drinks. The menu might as well have a table of contents and the beer menu is basic. The place needs a good manager or management team. There is some positive, was once I got a server he was attentive and was able to sell a perfect check. The food was ok but no different form Applebee's, you go there to get the corporate consistency.  The best part of my entire visit was the dessert cookie!"
Evelyn H.,"Cleveland, OH",30,57,,5.0,12/31/2016,I can not count the number of times we've been here now.  It is excellent.  The menu is extensive and extremely good.  We've taken friends here and gave $50 gift  cards to some people and we can't say enough good things about this restaurant.  The service was well above average.  I've read other reviews saying service was bad - you people need to go back and try again.  I don't think you were in the same restaurant we were.  We love this place and will be back many times and bring friends with us.
A W.,"Mentor, OH",0,19,,3.0,9/17/2016,"Been here twice since they opened. Feels like a cheesecake factory type chain but with a focus on beer. The menu is similar in size (like a book). The atmosphere is typical. I got a burger both times...something that you can't really mess up too bad. I liked their hefeweizen beer. My friend got the jambalaya and liked it. All in all, I'd go back if the wait isn't ridiculous like it always is at olive garden. The staff was peddling the BJs app and other annoying items. I think once all the kinks are worked out it will be a welcomed addition to the other restaurant choices in Mentor."
Mark P.,"Cleveland, OH",0,3,,1.0,11/1/2016,"So yea, one star. First visit wasn't so bad. it's a typical bar that has okay food. Pizza is decent. Lots of beer to choose from. First time didn't quite count because we went opening week. Second experience however was horrendous. Worst waiter we've ever had. I've never had anyone give us attitude and judgmentally criticize everything we asked. If my wife wasn't starving and we didn't have a movie to catch we would have just gotten up and left. Hopefully you have a better experience but there's plenty of other bars that have better food with much better service out there. I also sent them a complaint through email and haven't had a response yet. So they must not care. If you're looking forward to being belittled by all means try this place out."
Eric S.,"Willoughby, OH",15,3,,1.0,9/15/2016,"We went to visit a friend that was a server. The hostess staff is completely incompetent.  They sat many people before us and didn't attempt to accommodate us.. I know this is a corporate restaurant designed to move people through as quickly as possible.  If you want a corporate impersonal experience, I'm sure you'll enjoy yourself. Our server at the bar was wonderful, and I'm sure the rest of the staff is also.  As a manager, you would think the host staff would be your top priority."
Jim F.,"Cypress, TX",0,16,1,4.0,12/9/2016,"Nice looking place, varied menu and pretty good chain resturant formula food. This night they were out of ribeye (whaaat?) so ordered sirloin and had to send it back twice because it was overdone. Even 3rd one was overdone but my fellow diners were already finished eating so... However resturant was apologetic and didn't charge me, so I'll try this place again."
Doug B.,"Chesterland, OH",0,11,,3.0,9/23/2016,"Our waitress, Regina, was phenomenal! Very attentive and nice! The food was average. I had a full rack of ribs-they were tough and not fall-off-the-bone tender. Either they were overdone or were under the heat lamp too long.  My dining partner had a pulled pork sandwich which she liked. The fries were also very good. She capped off her meal with a pizookies which was yummy!  All in all the meal was a little above average. I would stick to something other than the ribs when I come back."
Amy W.,"Mentor, OH",2,1,,5.0,7/7/2017,"Great, casual restaurant with a focus on quality food and great service.  My prime rib was a little under-cooked and had quite a bit of fat.  It was still a large piece, though, and I'm used to other restaurants not cooking my steaks properly so never even thought to complain.  Our server, Angela, was not satisfied and sent the manager over who proceeded to comp the entire meal and prepare an entire new meal for me to take home.  This goes above and beyond and emphasizes BJ's focus on quality food and great service!  We will be back!!!"
Marleen B.,"Mentor, OH",54,5,2,4.0,1/1/2017,Been here a couple times and have always sat at the bar. Ordered appetizers and drinks.  Both have been great. Loved the brussel sprouts! Bartenders were very friendly and attentive. Love the decor of the restaurant.  All the beer we have tasted so far has been great too. Would recommend.
Stuart K.,"Twinsburg, OH",0,34,,4.0,12/26/2016,"Very large menu, food is very good, prices are reasonable, service is excellent, had French Dip sandwich, very large sandwich and very good."
Brian S.,"Jefferson, OH",0,5,13,4.0,9/11/2016,"At time of this writing, this restaurant had only been open for about 2 weeks. The revolving door at the entrance was unexpected but simple to operate; my wife had no issues with it. The hostess was very friendly and greeted us with a smile and, ""welcome to bj's, have you ever been to bj's?""  [insert joke here]. The inside of the establishment was clean, well illuminated and had several televisions around the inside perimeter, making Sunday afternoon football a breeze to watch. (The Eagles were up 7-0 against the Browns when we left). My wife ordered a root beer and I had the stout, both of which were terrific. So, on to the meal. I ordered the guac bacon cheeseburger with fries, which happens to be what I normally order at any bar and grill restaurant so I've have my share of bacon cheese burgers. This one had a liberal amount and heavy chunks of guac along with small bits of bacon and some lettuce and tomato. The thin'ish meat patty was a bit over done and a little dry and was almost overpowered with smoke flavor, though I still enjoyed eating it (probably because I was hungry). The fries were shoestring fries and cooled down quickly but still somewhat enjoyable. My wife really liked them but I prefer a thicker fry so this is definitely a matter of preference. If you like shoestring fries, you'll probably love these. My wife had a salad with small mozzarella balls, tomatoes, lettuce, onion, balsamic vinegar, etc., and it was FANTASTIC !!!!  She mentioned her sandwich was good too but could not remember was it was called by the time we made it to the parking lot. The waitress was very friendly, albeit a bit inexperienced (no big deal), and the meal delivery was prompt. We enjoyed this experience and will probably try it again in the future when we are looking for something a little better than fast food. Did I mention the root beer and stout were fantastic??"
Jon H.,"Mentor, OH",0,21,5,1.0,11/1/2016,"I stopped in for a quick beer monday to see if they'd worked the kinks out.  The Platform Brewery tap handle doesn't say what beer it is so I asked the blonde bartender. She replied, ""I don't know, I don't drink this stuff. I drink miller light bottles.""    That was it....   pathetic."
Deb P.,"Cleveland, OH",0,26,5,4.0,10/9/2016,First time in. I was impressed. Busy with browns game on but service was quick. I ordered off the enlightened menu (lower calories). I ate the veggie pita tacos. They were delicious. They showed me how to download the app which is for their rewards program. Lots of craft beers. I had mixed drink but when I go back I will definitely try their seasonal pumpkin beer.  I'm looking forward to going back to try the place again.
Robert Z.,"Willoughby, OH",0,2,,2.0,9/22/2016,"Had a burger here before it was awesome Today  I ordered the bacon burger the server forgot to ask me how I would like it done-she must have thought I like it well ,it came out burnt on one side I asked her for another one this time she said how would you like it done I said medium it took for ever and came out well not a great experience for a $12 burger"
Paul S.,"Willoughby, OH",5,21,1,4.0,9/8/2016,Just checked out for 1st time... I got ribs and she got classic burger with calamari as appetizer. Calamari didn't blow me away but better than most. Really no complaints.. Wait staff is really friendly and attentive. Will definitely return.
Jerry N.,"Willoughby, OH",26,17,,5.0,10/28/2016,Absolutely love this place!  I asked for a recommendation on draft beers and the bartender was very knowledgeable about all of the beers.  I really like the open layout of the whole place.  Staff was very friendly.
Jeff C.,"Willoughby, OH",60,12,,5.0,11/29/2016,"I have been to the locations in Columbus, OH several times. I was very happy they opened in Mentor. Great atmosphere, Great Service, Great Food. The price point is right on target for the quality of the food..Fantastic"
