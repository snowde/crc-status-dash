John C.,"Willoughby, OH",0,6,,1.0,5/28/2017,"If I could give it zero stars I would.  Slow, inaccurate service and average food.  They made a mistake on our order and after correcting it, it was still on our bill.  The waiter asked us during the middle of eating ""you probably don't want dessert, do you?""  That was easy to answer."
Diane S.,"Seabrook, NH",0,14,2,4.0,9/21/2016,"We were passing thru Mentor on a working road trip and noticed, then yelped BJ'S brew house. The parking lot was very busy 7 pm wed night, and yelp reviews sounded good. We sat at the bar, preferred seating for us. While waited a few minutes for empty seats, (never a problem for us to wait for seats at a busy bar) a lovely hostess offered us no fewer than 3 tables so we didn't have to wait. We got seats and Jackie was our bartender, she was VERY busy, but totally on point. She recommended the BJ's brews and offered samples of any we'll like to try. My boyfriend had a stout ( BJ'S stout... don't remember the name) he liked it. My skinny Margarita was very yummy. He switched to the Nutty Brewnette, it was very good. We had ribs and the ribeye, and shared. Steak was cooked perfectly, ribs were yummy. All the sides were good.  Service was awesome!!! Then Jackie said they've only been there for 3 weeks. What?!? Great job BJ'S brew house!! Keep it up"
Tricia L.,"Toledo, OH",0,6,,3.0,4/29/2017,This was our first time here and we will go back to try other menu options. The Honey-Sriracha Sprouts was very good and well liked as was the Calamari. The Jambalaya was also tasty. The Parmesan chicken was a bit disappointing and the Bacon Cheeseburger was average. There was a decent selection of drinks.
Jim C.,"Montville, OH",10,10,,1.0,10/9/2016,"Service needs fine tuning, shouldn't get your appetizers same time as your entree, 3 visits to restaurant and each time got appetizers after our meals, nothing like the Florida locations we have gone to"
Boro J.,"Akron, OH",0,6,,5.0,8/31/2016,"Great tasting food, good service, nice atmosphere.  Will be back soon. Highly reccomended!!"
Amanda A.,"Painesville, OH",0,5,,2.0,3/25/2017,Not impressed..  Have been here twice food is average service is horrible.  After downloading the app to sign in on the waiting list we got there about 25mins later check in with the desk and still had to wait an hour after watching several people being seated before us that walked in after us another bust for Mentor restaurants..
Heather G.,"Willoughby, OH",13,9,4,2.0,3/18/2017,"First time we went here, it was amazing. Great food and service. Second visit though- our dinner turned into a two hour sluggish snooze feast with mediocrity on my plate. We went on a Friday night and expected slow service, but the place was not busy, we went late at night, 830pm. Didn't get out till 1030. Our server was nice enough but very slow getting our drinks, taking our order, getting refills, and so on. Then I made the mistake of ordering a piooikie. It was delicious but she should have told me it was an additional 20 min wait for one. I almost go up and left. If she had come over and said something to me about the wait time, this review would have earned another star. Good food doesn't mean anything if you can't deliver it in a decent time frame. I got the seasonal fish and chips and the mushroom salad. Best part of my meal was the five dollar salad. It was amazing. Could have done without the fish and chips. I don't think we will be returning."
Christy N.,"Mentor, OH",0,6,,1.0,2/24/2017,Whats the point of call ahead seating- add to waiting list from app arrive at restaurant 15 minutes later told 20 minutes- wait 30 minutes ask status- told 15 more minutes... whats the point. This is ridiculous. If you'd have been upfront about the wait we would have gone elsewhere!
Bella V.,"Mentor, OH",175,10,1,3.0,11/21/2016,"First time visiting. We went on a sunday evening, had to wait a little bit for a table but their dining room was full so that was fine. The home brews were decent. My best description of their menu is ""overwhelming"". I understand wanting to offer a wide variety but that is ridiculous. The caprese salad was good but the ""fresh mozzarella"" tasted like it had been cut that morning and had dried out. I had the parm crusted chicken but the star of that dish was definitely the white cheddar mashed potatoes and my boyfriend had the ziti which he described as ""okay"" because the sheer amount of different ingredients caused the dish to lose its identity. Definitely save room for the pozookie desert! Natalie was our server, have had her before at Applebee's, that lady is five star. Our experience was pretty solid until afterwards. Both my boyfriend and I had an upset stomach about an hour after dinner. For me this is not ordinary but he's had three stomach aches in the last year. I can only assume that the cutting boards or other prep equipment wasn't sanitized properly. Willing to give it another try. We will see what happens."
Anne M.,"Painesville, OH",0,4,,3.0,9/30/2016,"We had dinner on 9/23/16 at Mentor location.  There was a great selection of food items and our waiter, Easton, was very helpful in making our selections.  I ordered the citrus lime chicken and my guest ordered a delicious side salad and pizza. Our food arrived promptly, our server provided excellent and efficient service, and the atmosphere was lively.  We thoroughly enjoyed our experience except for one complaint:  We are not beer drinkers, so we wanted to order some cocktails.  The menu DOES NOT list prices and we soon found out why.  All the mixed alcoholic drinks are very over-priced (a Bacardi rum and coke was $8.75 and a Sangria was $9 or $10).  Overpricing the mixed drinks will prevent guests from returning for a second time and/or making this brewery a regular stop.  After the excitement of a new restaurant in the area, I am afraid the clientele will diminish.  We would certainly return if this franchise would make the recommended adjustments; however, until then, we'll go back to our standard favorite restaurants in the area."
Carl G.,"Willoughby, OH",1,6,1,1.0,9/4/2016,"Well - I tried to make a large party reservation. The hostess said I needed to speak to the manager. A few minutes later the manager got on the phone and said ""he could not do it"" I asked what he could do. The manager said he could only do a parties of 5 reservation. I then suggested that was fine we would break up the group accordingly He indicated that would not work either. I asked if it was a staffing issue. The manager said no. I felt by his tone  he was being bothered rather than being apologetic. Not a good first impression for the new Mentor location. The manager's nearby competitor was happy to accommodate."
Jason S.,"Painesville, OH",0,2,,2.0,8/31/2016,"Average tasting food (including room temperature fries) and inattentive service (getting orders wrong) means there's no reason to go back.  There are plenty of other mediocre places to go for food that appeals to the least common denominator, and it's probably better to go to one that turn lunch around in less than an hour."
Heather S.,"Perry, OH",9,23,8,2.0,9/10/2016,"Given this is a new restaurant in our area and its a busy Saturday afternoon, we may have to try again. Huge disappointment!! We were greeted at the door and seated fairly quickly. Walking back to our table, the floors are very slippery. I had flip flops and husband had tennis shoes on. The hostess agreed the floor was hard for her to maneuver with non slip shoes. After she walked away, we sat for at least 10min while plenty of tables around us had servers buzzing by. My husband flagged one down to get us a server. Once our server arrived, with no apology, we went ahead and ordered basic cheese burgers medium well. Food arrived quickly from a food service person, who plopped the food down and took off. There was no ketchup on the table for fries but figured our server would arrive and ask if we needed anything. She did arrive after we ate about half our food. The burger tasted good but was pink in the middle. Overall, a big disappointment and there are plenty of options elsewhere around here."
John N.,"Perry, OH",0,63,2,2.0,9/17/2016,"Two hour wait to be seated.  Yes, the place is new but the Mgmt needs to get their act together if they want people to come back. Not impressed."
TJ L.,"Willoughby, OH",0,2,1,1.0,11/19/2016,"Called ahead got on the list, and they said 50-60 minutes. Okay, so get there and wait an additional 30 minutes and still no table.  Eventually had to leave without a table.  It was busy BUT the staff was very unorganized!"
R V.,"Painesville, OH",0,4,,1.0,11/19/2016,"Starting with the good: Their version of Christmas Ale alongside their Hickory Brisket Burger was awesome.  Now the bad:  the span between our 3 entrées was nearly 15 minutes each.  My meal came out second. It was only THEN that a manager informed us that the seared Ahi tuna salad was unpopular and they didn't have any.  Hello: that information would have been good 30 minutes prior and NOT when another entrée was brought out.  He offered another type of Ahi tuna that would taste the same just not cut the same.  Not even close,  more like soggy seasoned chicken you would find in soup.  They did take the Ahi off the bill.  We likely won't return but try it and maybe your experience will be better."
Anne D.,"Mentor, OH",0,15,,1.0,10/8/2016,"Service incredibly slow. Just ordered appetizers and took 40 minutes and they lost one of the appetizers. The calamari was incredibly bland, no seasoning in the breading. Not impressed. Menu is far to big and nothing sounds too incredibly delectable. Very underwhelmed. Disappointing addition to route 20."
Deanna F.,"Mentor, OH",0,4,,5.0,10/20/2016,"We have been there several times since its opening. Great food, decent service, fun drinks. They have a good app that has given us lots of coupons and free stuff. The servers are inconsistent. Some are amazing...some ok. Never had a bad experience. Worth trying out!"
