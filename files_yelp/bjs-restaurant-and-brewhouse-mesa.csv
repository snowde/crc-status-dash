Tabatha R.,"Mesa, AZ",105,121,32,4.0,10/7/2017,"I like BJs because I like options... and boy does BJs have options. The menu is a mile long and they have a little bit of everything. Looking for pasta? Pizza? Chicken? Fish? A burger? They literally have everything.  I've tried quite a few things including their pastas and fish. Their mashed potatoes are really good and I also really enjoy their asparagus. My favorite thing at BJs, though, is actually their in house crafted cream soda. It's the perfect taste.  The salmon on their low calorie menu that comes with the rice pilaf is delicious and not over cooked, has a lot of flavor. I've also had the cherry glazed salmon which is equally as good. Their pizza cookies are really good too. And again. Options. A ton of them. They even have a churro Pizza cookie at the moment. Two perfectly yummy treats in one!!!"
David P.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,184,,3.0,11/17/2017,"Good enough. Their weekday specials are the draw for me. The quality is right at this price. But, I would not order the same items at full menu price. My fav is the Thursday night rib deal. Get the full rack. For the money, it's a better deal. And, it seems the serving size is always more than double the ""half rack"" size.  Clam chowder is done well. Tomato and mozzarella salad is very good. Skip the Caeser. Fries are cooked well done and salted to the point to motivate beer sales. Broccoli is hit or miss and can be unripe. I'll never order the asparagus again - wilted and the tips where brown. I commented several times to the server but she never picked up on it. Ribs are usually cooked well and the BBQ sauce is excellent. Sometimes the meat is overcooked and, with the sauce basted on, can be caramelized to rock hard. The Pizzookies are always wonderful. This place is a worthy venture. I've not tried their beers but I'll venture they do a good job. And, for a sports bar/restaurant, the place, though nearly always packed, is no noisier than most Valley eateries. Go, but do treat yourself to a Pizzookie!"
CeCe E.,"San Francisco, CA",83,6,,2.0,8/10/2017,"Fantastic food but I have only had good service one of the many times I have visited. One time I  visited with my mother at 9pm and we waited to ve sat for 5 minutes. There was no server or employee in sight. We stepped in and looked around to ask someone for help but saw nobody, so we left.  Whenever I have gone with my friends we always have at least one mistake with our order. Every server except one has taken 15 minutes or more to refill our drinks. It has regularly taken 45min to an hour for our food when the restaurant is not busy. It is terrible terrible service. But 2 stars because the food, when correct, tastes amazing and that one server (Melody?) was fantastic. (Note: I have come here at least once a month for the past year and a half)"
Heather L.,"Mesa, AZ",47,5,,5.0,1/8/2018,This place was so yummy! I went here before my junior prom and the food was surprisingly fast for how large our party was!
Martin M.,"Mesa, AZ",19,9,,5.0,1/7/2018,We had a party of 25 for our wedding rehearsal dinner.  The manager Nikki was unbelievably helpful  along with the rest of the wait staff.   Great food and drink but most importantly Nikki went out of her way to make sure that this was a flawless dinner.  I would highly recommend this establishment.
Denise H.,"Mesa, AZ",24,42,90,5.0,12/22/2017,Everything I eat here is good..Service is good kind friendly staff.. Always busy but thats why.. Clean bathrooms.. Great cheese curds my favorite dish is there Cherry Glazed Salmon.. Got to try it..love love there Chicken Tortilla Soup the bomb!!!! awesome waiter Curtis was on it all nite..
Jason P.,"Chandler, AZ",7,19,13,1.0,12/18/2017,"I took several of my Co workers here for some appetizers and a few drinks, with 6 of us... all laughing and having a great time. We had a total tab of $150. Including $60 of appetizers.... we had been there 55 minutes and the manager, a very young and inexperienced guy decided that he should cut us off, simply because we were being loud in the bar area.   We were not intoxicated, we were laughing and making jokes.  Of all the times I have been to a restaurant, and or bar. This was by far the worst call ever made by a manager on duty.   Luckily we were very close to a place called RTO Sullivan's.  We went there and had a great time.  BJ's ....You had an epic failure on Saturday night."
Andrea M.,"Denver, CO",24,40,,4.0,11/21/2017,"I've been here a couple times. We went last night, and it was busy. Our server did not seem that attentive; however, the food was pretty good. It was just an average visit."
Lauren L.,"Gilbert, AZ",46,78,224,4.0,7/1/2017,"Ok so truth be told this is really a 3.5 star but I'm in a good mood. The food is ok, a nice meal, big portions, only a little over priced ( loads of coupons through the app) the atmosphere it's self is great high ceilings, loads of interesting things to look at, huge tvs, for the sports fans I love the lighting. And you get a free dessert in your birthday. The staff is attentive and quick. So why the 3.5 ...., such potential for amazing food, dig a little deeper guys, use the fact that you are a brewery, create some dishes around that. Right. Now you have an average collection of predictable meals."
Brian H.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,39,9,3.0,12/9/2017,"Beer and desserts are great.  Food is hit and miss and the servers are very nice but if they are busy you will definitely be pressured to order quickly and then get the heck out.  Pork chop looked amazing but was significantly underdone and underseasoned as well.  Steak on my left ordered medium rare was blood rare, sent back twice and gave up.  Stick with the burgers and you will be much happier."
Cindy M.,"Peoria, AZ",18,248,90,4.0,8/5/2017,So happy that they have weekend brunch with $4 bloody Mary's and mimosas. Large and varied drink and food menus with lots of trendy and healthy options. I really enjoyed the roasted brussel sprouts salad. I added blackened salmon to the salad. The salad and salmon were a generous size. Service was excellent.
Jim C.,"Fort Thomas, AZ",3,54,92,4.0,8/27/2017,"Staff is super friendly, the food is good. The restaurant is clean and there is a variety of beer. We had the quinoa salad with shrimp and the Mediterranean chicken pita taco's. all of it was good. The beer menu gives a bitterness scale, the higher the number the more biter. We will be back here again in the near future."
Teri D.,"Powell, OH",113,702,50,2.0,1/4/2017,"Normally when we go to BJ'S back in Ohio we enjoy both the food and the service but that didn't work out for us here.  Table of 7 versus one server who we had to wave at chase down to take our orders, refill our drinks and even get the check.  She apologized once for being suddenly inundated by folks coming in but that didn't improve our service.   Seriously! She asked if we wanted our empty soda glasses removed (no we had grown attached to them) and never removed the empty appetizer plate till the very end.   The food was good all around except it seemed the ahi tuna salads ordered were very stingy on the tuna but the lack of service just put a cloud over the dinner."
Kenna W.,"Mesa, AZ",0,4,,5.0,9/22/2017,"My 1st order was placed through Grub Hub, which I don't recommend, they have unprofessional skirt wearing men that deliver and my order was not accurate. It do not reflect on BJ's but rather grubhub. I will go direct to the BJ's website and order delivery from now on. I talked with Andy on the evening of 9-21-17 and he offered the most amazing customer service and solution. I am so pleased, the food is excellent and this is now my favorite delivery restaurant."
Corey H.,"Minneapolis, MN",290,263,378,5.0,12/23/2016,"Blackened salmon was fine, there was nothing extraordinary about it. The quinoa salmon bowls we incredible, my mom and I just kept raving over them. We were trying to figure out what the spices were but I waitress was a little overworked and said she would find out for us but then she forgot. My daughter liked her fish and chips, there were plenty of fish pieces, at least four big pieces. And my son ate both of his mini cheeseburgers and cute little skinny fries."
Felice P.,"Mesa, AZ",1,28,4,2.0,10/31/2017,"We have been to BJ's many times and usually look forward to returning, but we went tonight - we even knew what we were ordering before we saw the menu - and it was so disappointing. We had the prime rib dip, usually our favorite dish ($15 each.) This time, the bread tasted old, the meat seemed like the leftover pieces at the end of the night (it was 5 PM) and the gravy was too salty to use. I'm not sure we'll be back. I am so disappointed. The waiter forgot to add our dinner to our BJ's program....which I'm going to try to figure out now."
Cathryn U.,"Camelback East Village, AZ",37,4,3,3.0,10/20/2017,"It wasn't the same as the chandler restaurant... the food was good, but the beer just wasn't the same."
Darin H.,"Aiea, HI",49,73,9,3.0,5/25/2017,"Came here with my family because someone recommend this place. There wasn't any wait and we got seated right away. Our waiter was awesome and was very helpful with answering questions. I had the deep dish ziti and it was 'meh'. The handcrafted root beer didn't taste too special. Overall, the service was great but the food was average at best."
Evetta P.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,11,1,1.0,9/27/2017,"I ordered food for delivery (a bacon cheeseburger) off of GrubHub. I specifically asked for a well done burger, and in the comments I wrote verbatim ""please cook very well done, no pink!"" I received a medium rare burger with burnt bacon. If you want an accurate order, save yourself the headache and order from someplace else!"
Ronald S.,"Mesa, AZ",0,13,1,5.0,10/15/2017,"It was an absolute delight to have Alicia B. as our server today!  Her bubbly personality and unending smile made it clear she valued us and our business.  She could not have been more attentive in addressing our needs, always anticipating them before we requested.  As a regular, regular guest at this location since July 26, 2005, I can tell you that today was one of the best experiences I've ever had at BJ's!   It was so obvious that Alicia was taking pride in passionately connecting with myself and my neighbor.  She provided flawless and relentless execution of every detail throughout our visit.  Thank you, Team Mesa, for hiring such a seasoned professional!  I plan to return to this location in the very near future and you can bet I will be asking to have Alicia as my server once again!! :-)"
Elizabeth B.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,1,,5.0,10/9/2017,My sister and I came for a celebratory dinner and it did not disappoint! Our server gave us great service and the manager went above and beyond to make sure we had a nice meal! Thanks you!
Mr. B.,"Apache Junction, AZ",2,54,1,4.0,10/6/2017,"Food was okay, the pumpkin beer was actually good.  The only reason they don't get 5 stars is, the Cubs were still playing and they felt it necessary to change every tv to the D-backs game. They could have left one on the Cubs.  Then Hank walked in.  He started drinking heavily. He was being really loud and his pants were falling down.  I recommend BJ's I do not recommend Hank."
Khevin M.,"Mesa, AZ",37,143,102,1.0,6/20/2016,"I love BJ's but they disappointed me and my entire family yesterday. We arrived at 11:15 on Father's Day (Didn't know they took reservations)  Told us it would be at least 30 minutes, we waited and waited. Finally after about 40 minutes, trying to get an update from the front staff - (Lots of them standing around) said they were not sure that it could be another 30 minutes - Screw- That!! We went next door to P.F. Changs  and they seated us right away! Thanks BJ's you guys sucked the fun out of Fathers Day!"
Brie H.,"Mesa, AZ",33,15,17,5.0,2/8/2017,"First off, started off with the BEST server, his name is John... and he was spectacular! Explained things well, and even said it was only his 3rd day!!! (: well done sir, wellll doneee! 8) And food was off the wall amazing, of course their own brewed beer from Chandler is great as well... couldn't beat this experience truthfully!  Hats off to ya. Fiances and I first time!  Needless to say, we shall be back! ^0^"
Alex B.,"Mesa, AZ",2,17,19,5.0,7/26/2016,"Always a pleasure to eat at this BJ's. There's great atmosphere, many tasty food and dessert options, as well as a wide drink selection, all for decent prices!  This particular visit I had the Calimari and Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos. The Calimari was delicious, came both in the round and typical squid pieces, and was accompanied with marinara and a creamy, white dipping sauce.  The tacos tasted just like a typical chicken pita and came with a side of quinoa mixed with rice. The waiter suggested cholula hot sauce which definitely kicked the tacos up a knotch. Overall, very satisfied with the food and even more satisfied with the attentive and personable waiter."
Larry O.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,2,,2.0,1/22/2017,"Having been a waiter at one point in my life I can give an honest opinion about the wait staff at BJ'S. Terrible... Only one waitress is even good as I have been here multiple times.  None of the wait staff care about what food they present. If it looks terrible, a wilted salad, well done when you ask for medium rare, not coming back to ask how it is, no refills on iced-tea, Nada. But have an expensive drink and then they hover.  The seating is ridiculous,  empty tables and they tell you they can't seat you for no wait staff for the tables in that section. We always took over tables until other wait staff arrived. I am 6'5, 240lbs. Bigger tables available and yet they always try to cram me into a extra small both for two?? I have to argue with the hostess to get a larger table, even when there a lot of available tables left to go."
Richard L.,"Gilbert, AZ",332,8,1,3.0,1/10/2017,"I like to consider my family and I regulars at this place. My dad loves the brews here and I'm a sucker for their pizzas. The staff has always been really friendly and nice! Don't get their entrees. They look nothing like the pictures and proportions are very deceiving. If you ever do come with a coupon just always assume the worst. You're not going to get a good deal in fact you probably will spend a lot more. Came in with a buy one get one, and they state it has to be the cheapest one even though it says it nowhere on the coupon. ""Restaurant policy""."
Christa L.,"San Tan Valley, AZ",703,329,904,3.0,5/15/2016,"Another large chain and another meal that was just okay.   The perks were that our server was great, they make their own beer, root beer, and cream sodas, and they have a large menu so there's pretty much something for everyone.  However, service was also very slow and the food wasn't even piping hot when delivered.  We all ordered a version of their grilled cheese and all were pretty good.  Unfortunately, two of them were pretty soggy underneath.  We also shared an appetizer platter, which was full of typical bar food, also delivered on the not so hot side, and wasn't really anything to write home about.  So, if you aren't in a hurry and want something familiar along with a cold beer, this is your spot!"
Aubrey B.,"Brooklyn, WI",67,1,,5.0,8/6/2017,"My friend and I are here on vacation from the Midwest. Both of us have serving experience and I have to say I've never been so impressed. Our server Brady was amazing! He was around our age and was super friendly throughout the whole meal! If I ever make it back to this side of the country I will definitely be coming back here. Amazing food, amazing drinks, and even better service!!"
Sherri S.,"Billings, MT",19,14,18,2.0,7/20/2017,Not impressed. Slow service and food wasn't as described on menu. Waitress was not happy to do her job. Wouldn't bother returning.
Nichole Z.,"Apache Junction, AZ",55,101,78,4.0,3/15/2017,"Just like every other restaurant....The Monday $5 margaritas were pretty tasty and had a different kick that was a perfect blend of sweet & tart & from what I was told a pretty decent beer selection. I did love the ambiance with the circular booths and brick walls. The service was quick and the server was friendly and attentive. The only real downfall was the price. It was $40 for happy hour which, considering the neighborhood, there are cheaper options that are just as good. I do want to go back and try the California take on Chicago pizza... growing up close to Chicago I'd call myself a pretty big critic on how good a Chicago pizza is & if the place can live up to my Midwest tastebuds I may have to give it more stars."
Brianne S.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,6,,3.0,7/4/2017,"The last two times I've been here (all within the last week and a half) have been a disappointment when it comes to service. The food has been fantastic as always though. On a Sunday afternoon, my husband, parents, and 3-yr old daughter went in around 4:30-my dad had a flight to catch at 6:45. It apparently was shift change and getting someone to take our order was horrendous! We finally had to ask the hostess to help or my dad wouldn't have eaten! The second visit was on a Friday at 11:15 for lunch. Our waitress was great to start but then disappeared! My water glass was empty for at least ten minutes! No other staff would slow down enough for me to even ask anyone else. I finally had to yell toward our server to get her to come over. Both times, the food was delicious!!!"
Kat R.,"Mesa, AZ",26,136,230,2.0,5/20/2017,Once again screwed over by BJs regarding the quantity of tuna on their Ahi Tuna Salad. This is the second time we've had to talk yo management about it. Getting ridiculous.
John V.,"Chandler, AZ",0,86,14,2.0,9/1/2016,"Had lunch 9/1/16.. 1 Clam Chowder , fish taco, dish Titi, 2 ice teas..  bill $38...  Clam Chowder was Luke warm..  Very Average at best Dish Titi..  pasta was uncooked, very small portion.. not tasty Service was rush.. rush.. cleaned off our table before we were  finished.. stood at table waiting for us to sign bill.. that's a first Very over priced ..  service and food below par Very over rated..  it's a shame nice atmosphere Won't return.."
Tara W.,"Mesa, AZ",78,9,1,5.0,7/7/2017,"Love everything about this restaurant. Great food, dronks, staff and atmosphere. My local hotspot."
Kathy F.,"Chicago, IL",36,2,,5.0,6/26/2017,"We were a party of 9 and we ordered all our food, it took a little while, half of us got our food then a minute later the rest of us were served.  About half of our plates were not hot enough so the waiter apologized and got the manager. Nicki the GM gave us to go boxes for that food, cooked all new food and served it hot.  She was very apologetic, comped all our food and gave us gift cards for a future visit.  Although we had some problems the staff and Nicki made everything right and then some.  I'm from out of town and when I come back I will definitely go back!!! Plus the food was delicious"
Laura G.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,5,,5.0,9/24/2017,"We're regulars here because the food and service are consistently fantastic. Everyone is helpful and friendly, and the restaurant is very clean. It's kid-friendly but not crazy. Great family restaurant!"
Warren E.,"Mesa, AZ",80,16,24,4.0,4/17/2016,"BJ's is a nice restaurant. If anything, this reminds me of a Cheesecake Factory but not as dark. We came here for dinner and to my surprise, they make their own beer! So this is a two parter. One for food, one for the beer. They have a huge menu. They will have something for everyone. Reason it's only 4 stars is we did have to wait for our waiter longer than normal on several occasions. Also this place wasn't packed. Busy but not packed. Bonus points for they give out little pizza pieces to the guests that are waiting to be seated. Food- starter was the potato skins. Would have preferred they weren't deep fried vs baked. They were tasty and they could have always used more bacon!! Wife had a bacon cheeseburger. Huge burger that's plenty juicy with all the fixings. I had the ribeye with a baked potato and a bowl of clam chowder. Chowder and the potato were very good. No complaints. The ribeye was cooked to my liking (mid rare) but the seasoning was missing. Felt like it was missing a bump from being a really good steak. I will probably get a burger next time I'm here.  Beer- I got a flight of beers. Cost about $7 for 4 of them. This time they are 5oz beers vs the normal 2oz. I got the... Lightswitch Lager- there version of the bud light. But this one is very good, crisp, highly carbonated and clear. Excellent! Harvest Hefeweizen- another great quality beer. Smooth, clean, went down way too easy. Would get a pint of this any day. Jeremiah Red- surprise of the night! Malty and sweet. Has just amount of kick on the taste buds to wanting more. Well made quality beer. PM Porter- I'm a sucker for porters and this didn't disappoint. Smooth, fragrant, great mouth feel. Well made Porter. This place knows their beers. Period. Can't wait to return and try the other craft brews on the menu. I would come back here before I go to San Tan Brewery."
Tara A.,"Gilbert, AZ",30,116,36,4.0,1/31/2017,"This is always the kids' first choice because of the fries and pizzookie ... it's really good, the Buffalo chicken pizza is to die for and the menu is huge. Great beer and cocktail selection and a rewards card we use often. In the service is always good, but slooow because they are always packed. I do find it hard to find low carb options... but that's my problem."
S.Ellen B.,"Mesa, AZ",13,50,44,2.0,6/19/2016,"Horrible eating experience. Our server didn't care. The place wasn't crowded, but our server acted overworked and it took us ages to get drinks. After we got drinks, it took even longer before she came back to take our orders. We sat with our empty drinks, waiting to order and waiting for refills for an absurd amount of time. Our server didn't resurface until we asked another nearby server for refills - this lady seemed to be able to handle her six tales just fine, but our server couldn't handle two. Finally we got our orders in and she asks if we want refills. Are you kidding me? Of course we do - its just diet soda! Drinks were brought to us while nearby tables were being bussed - as in, dirty plates were put on pause, our glasses fetched, then the bussing resumed. We finally noticed there was a party of some kind with the servers and buss-boys in the other section of the restaurant. We watched as our server sat with friends and ate for a bit while we waited for our food and, again, went without refills. Bussers sat dirty plates on clean tables, next to the clean glasses and whatnot, which was totally inappropriate. When we did get refills, our server never took any glasses away, so our take got really crowded... especially when the food finally came. I very nearly started sitting glasses on the clean table next to us, because hey, thats what the bussers did. Our orders were wrong, but our server never came back to ask how our food was. My sister's burger was not cooked to order, all my sides were incorrect, and we were starving. My sis sent hers back (took another twenty minutes to get it corrected). I didn't bother asking about my sides, because I knew I might never see any food at all if I sent it back to the kitchen. I'm surprised my sister did. We begged another refill off another server and didn't see our server again until she dropped off the check.  The only reason why I'm giving two stars instead of one is because our server did take my sister's meal off the check since it had been incorrect. Unfortunately.... I have a feeling she did it not because the meal had been wrong, but because she suddenly realized with her terrible service, we wouldn't be tipping.  Overall, horrible service. Food was only mediocre, but to be fair to the chefs in the back, we might have been tainted by the bad experience. Wasn't worth it."
