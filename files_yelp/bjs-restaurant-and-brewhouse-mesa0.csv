Monica B.,"Arlington, VA",82,257,308,4.0,5/19/2011,"Overall this was a pleasant dining experience.  The staff was friendly and frequently checked on us to make sure we were taken care of.  The establishment is clean and had a very casual, relaxed feel. Our party of four were able to share a single large pizza, which tasted very good.  Although the meal was somewhat heavy, that's what you get when you order gormet pizza.  Okay, onto dessert: we ordered a Pizookie.  It's a cookie baked in a large dish with ice cream on top and it was delicious!  Eating here wasn't the healthiest choice but it sure was satisfying.  Would I eat here again?  Yes!  Will I go to the gym afterward?  Yes!"
David F.,"Tempe, AZ",0,5,,5.0,2/3/2015,The Glazed Salmon is wonderful. Pair that with the Piranha Pale Ale and you have a great dinner
Rose B.,"Anaheim, CA",0,18,,1.0,8/9/2015,"I'm only giving this 1 stars because of our excellent server Jeremy.  I ordered the BBQ Ranch Chicken salad.  It was the worst salad I ever had.  did not want to complain seeing my friend was buying me lunch.  the lettuce was soggy to the point that it was mushy and wet looking like a noodle.  I could hardly find any chicken on it and the taste was very bland.  and then I heard our server tell the next table that deep dish is Chicago style and I grew up in Chicago and trust me it is a very thin crust with ingredients covered in cheese and then cut in squares.  Deep dish did not catch on till the 70s.  so since BJ's says its Chicago style, they could learn a lesson on history of pizza there.  but all in all I am sooooo disappointed in my salad, that I had to stop for a burger a few hours later cause I only ate wilted lettuce for lunch.  yucky  It is making me wonder if I will ever return there again for any meal."
Jay M.,"Phoenix, AZ",199,550,1368,5.0,3/24/2013,Pizookies & killer rootbeer!!! The foods good too btw....
Jeff Z.,"Mesa, AZ",7,6,1,4.0,4/8/2014,"Very good beer selection, with rotating seasonal selections, with most going for $5.50.  A bit on the high side for me.  We ordered a vegetarian pizza with extra ham on half and the stuffed mushrooms.  The mushrooms were very tasty, came 6 to a plate, and were gone in a short amount of time.  The server in training put in the original pizza order in wrong, putting just ham on half.  They brought out this pizza already aware it was wrong, and brought another one out to make the order right.  Two pizzas for the price of one, good deal!! The pizza was very good, the sauce was sweet and the crust nice and crunchy."
Jessica M.,"Queen Creek, AZ",5,37,25,5.0,8/9/2012,"The pizza is amazing and pretty much everything else, me and my boyfriend go here at least twice/ three time a month! :) service is a little slow but I've only been there when they're really busy"
Kristen S.,"Fort Collins, CO",38,11,4,1.0,2/6/2013,"This review is for the food only.  Not good.  I chose the avocado egg rolls for dinner, one of the more popular items reviewed here and the waitress noted that they were a favorite as well.  I love avocado on practically anything and I hated these.  The texture I think is what got to me - the overly creamy middle of avocado and cream cheese with the greasy roll was just a fail.  I really wanted to enjoy these, in fact I kept trying to give it another chance with one more bite.   But it just wasn't gonna happen."
Brittany C.,"Tempe, AZ",0,9,,4.0,7/21/2013,My wife and I were searching for somewhere to have lunch on this side of the valley. We decided on BJs considering we had been there before and enjoyed our time. We were greeted by the rudest hostess I've ever come across. At first we were ignored. When she finally greeted us her back turned to us and she was talking over her shoulder at us. She then sat us. Our server was great!! She was very informative and gave us the perfect amount of time to look over the menu. The food was good too. We had the mini bruchetta for an app. My wife order the mahi mahi tacos and I ordered chicken tenders. The price was just right for the amount.  The reason this place did not get 5 stars was their rude hostess. Thankfully the service and good came through.
William T.,"Mesa, AZ",0,1,,5.0,4/30/2014,"Response to Don M on 4/28. I was in BJ's that day with my wife, had a great meal and service, only problem was  4 drunk nurses ( 2 male/ 2 female).  I complained and you were nicely asked to leave.  You were Nasty. Just FYI, while you were busy yelling at an employee out front, my wife took down both of your license plates and turned them into Mesa, Gilbert and Chandler police departments for their BOLO (be on the lookout) listings. You will be picked up in the future being the drunks you are. There were only 4 of you, not 5, unless your patient was imaginary."
Henry F.,"Mesa, AZ",1,17,23,4.0,4/11/2012,A friend recommended this place to me I went in for lunch and had the fish tacos which you can have grilled or fried i had fried and it was delicious they had a number of dishes for lunch I will recommend this place to everyone the atmosphere is nice
Dan P.,"Phoenix, AZ",57,133,26,2.0,8/14/2010,"I had almost forgot I tried BJ's when I first moved to the valley some 8 years ago and was not impressed. Although the atmosphere was good the food just did not match. I did not return until yesterday when a coworkers birthday came up and so off to BJ's I go.  I was really hoping after all this time maybe I misjudged this place. I have to say that the service was excellent. Our waiter, although very busy on a Friday afternoon, was attentive and friendly. The first misstep was when I unwrapped my silverware and one of my forks had dried food stuck to it, gross. Oh well this can happen I guess so I order a chicken sandwich with a wedge salad and side of shoestring frys. The blue cheese dressing on my salad was runny and tasted sour. The sandwich was OK and my frys were cold.  So overall it was a fail, I guess I will give BJ's another 8 years and try again."
Raquel M.,"Mesa, AZ",5,29,,2.0,12/5/2011,If you go there its for the atmosphere and beer.  Food was ok but not thrilling.
Courtney B.,"Gilbert, AZ",1,19,3,3.0,5/23/2014,"Went here for the first time a few weeks ago. Got seated promptly, hostesses were friendly and the atmosphere was nice. Our server was Aimee. She was personable. However, we got there just as her section seemed to be filling up. She started looking overwhelmed. I ordered a small deep dish, it came out as a mini. I was disappointed but tried to let it go. Then we started seeing less of her. Our drinks stayed empty, some random server came over and took our dessert order. I asked for chocolate ice cream instead of vanilla and she said sure, but when it came out it still had vanilla. I don't know what happened there but it was still annoying. She brought me a water out with dessert even though that's not what I had been drinking. She brought my boyfriend refills the entire dinner but always seemed to forget mine. I had to actually correct her and tell her I still wanted refills on the drink I payed for. It sucks that our experience was sacrificed because she was overloaded and being seated with multiple tables at a time. Food was yummy, people were nice, but smaller sections to focus on quality of service or a better way of pacing the seating is needed."
Brooke E.,"Gilbert, AZ",21,71,17,2.0,6/30/2012,"This review is based on JUST the Superstition Springs location: My favorite kind of pizza is from BJ's. My husband and I usually get half pepperoni and half buffalo chicken as toppings. Other than a Caesar salad and a pazookie, I have not tried anything else... so this review is based on just these foods alone. The pizza is extraordinary and just one slice will make you feel full! We tried the pazookie (ice cream with a cookie) a couple of times here, but I have had better elsewhere. Actually, their pazookie makes me a little sick. Their ice-cream tastes cheap and frothy.  Normally, I would give BJs a 4.5 star review, but because of my most recent experience at the Superstition Springs location, I am going to bring my starred review a couple notches. We invited some friends to BJs and advised them they could not go wrong with the pizza! My husband has a fatal allergic reaction to olives, so we always make sure to tell the waiter to NOT put olives on anything he eats. BJs has usually accommodated this request, and I appreciate that. However, I feel that our waitress at Superstition was largely incompetent. Well, I was correct! While we waited for our pizza (which took an hour-- it has never taken an hour, okay?) our water glasses remained empty (for an hour people!) The waitress never came to refill our glasses. We were annoyed by it, and even a little embarrassed that we had raved so much to our good friends we had invited about the restaurant. When our pizza finally came, there were OLIVES on the pizza!"
Kyle H.,"Queen Creek, AZ",57,136,41,2.0,5/8/2010,"A little behind on my reviews....  Went here for lunch on 5/5/10. This was a lunch with family/friends.  We were there at about 11:30. Only a few other tables were occupied. We were seated pretty quickly. Then had to wait about 5-10 minutes before waitress showed up. Another 5 minutes to return with simple soda and lemonade orders.  Lunch orders included two salads, chicken tenders and fries, chicken sandwich and fries, angel hair pasta dish, and personal deep dish pizza.  Salads are a Little hard to screw up. Pizza was only warm. Some bites tasted like not yet cooked yet. Both orders with fries, the fries were cold as well as the pasta dish.  Of course, waitress never came back to check on our orders after a few minutes. So probably 10-15 minutes went by before she came visible to waiver her over. When we told her food was cold, she was clearly confused and unsure what to do. She said she would be back in a minute.  Manager too sounded confused and surprised... ""Don't know why food would be cold?"" He offered to bring out new order of fries, which he did fairly quickly.. No offer to discount meal ticket, no offer of free dessert, just apology and fresh basket of fries...  Would love to go back to this place to try the beer and maybe appetizers. Being a huge beer drinker, would love to try the different brews. The appetizer menu looked pretty good too.  I realize that any place can have a bad day. But first impressions are critical. Especially for food and restaurants. This will not be a place I would consider again unless the timing for Happy Hour presents itself..."
Efrain C.,"Maricopa, AZ",0,9,,3.0,1/31/2013,Staff was not too helpful when I called to ask if they had found my debit card. Eat there but make sure you don't need anything from these guys cause they are not too helpful.
Karen C.,"Sun Lakes, AZ",0,2,,3.0,6/18/2014,"Actually the 3 stars are for the food.   Service was not good.  We had 3 meals delivered with the statement that the Parmesan chicken would be right out!  10 minutes later and having flagged down our waiter who said they were waiting for the broccoli .....seriously !   If that was even true, bring the other food and deliver the broccoli on a separate plate!  The waiter delivered the chicken and never even apologized....I wanted to tell him to reheat our dinners.   Wish a manger had come around."
Frank P.,"Mesa, AZ",39,20,4,1.0,3/7/2010,"Ahh BJ's... 6 months ago you were one of my favorites in the East Valley. Now, not so much. In fact, I may never go back.  Always enjoyed the atmosphere which has not changed, usually the wait staff is competant, but the food was always great.  Good portions and quality ingredients, but not anymore.  Server was very mechanical and short. Since others bring the food, what else dies she have to do except check on us and keep our drinks filled? Sad. We ordered the Italian Market Salad which we usually split. It used to be a very finely chopped mountain of lettuce with great veggies, Garbanzo beans, cheese, meat etc. Now it has a small handful of white, droopy iceberg lettuce, tons of dressing and lots of white cheese balls. I could not finish my half (I was starving buy it was too gross) so we quickly paid and left. At this point even Taco Bell or Chipotle sounded good!   So sad.."
Y M.,"Mesa, AZ",22,38,13,4.0,2/1/2012,"Always yummy...this last time my hubbie ordered the wedge salad, ....oooo it was blue cheese heaven!! This place never misses. I also love there lettuce wraps."
Alicia B.,"Boulder, CO",332,501,97,3.0,2/10/2009,"My brother taught me a very valuable lesson. When you don't want to take the left overs home with you but you don't want to be rude, ask for a box and then ""forget"" the box on the table. There's a chance they'll run after you; there's a chance you'll escape free of leftovers. Thankfully, I escaped.  What did I leave behind? Their meatloaf. It wasn't the actual meatloaf that was gross. It was the gross sauce they drowned it in. Seriously, it was nasty. I ate one piece of the loaf and gave up, my stomach grouchy from the determined attempt to eat.  The veggies were great, as were their mashed potatoes. But the main course, the meat and its loaf, were not. Too bad, for that's what I wanted to like so badly. What I did like was their nut brown beer. It's the only one I can tell that's worth ordering. Don't bother with their porter. Ick.  BJ's could be a cool place to watch a game, if you don't get distracted by all the other TV's with different games on. I watched Superbowl highlights, a Suns game and a KU game all at the same time. This might've been overwhelming, if I were normal and didn't suffer from ADHD. (I kid...I think) Anyway, don't come for the food. Most of it is topped with fried onion rings. Don't believe me? Take a look at the menu. Even the salads are tainted."
