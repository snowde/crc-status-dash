Donna W.,"Mt Prospect, IL",0,24,,5.0,4/1/2016,"Oh yum!  Our entire group thoroughly enjoyed our lunch at BJ's.  We were hungry at the Mesa Swap Meet, and decided not to stand in the long lines for fast food, so drove a ways to BJ's.  What a great decision! First the drinks - the beer drinkers in our group loved the selection (I noticed the Chicago-based Not Your Fathers Rootbeer), and I had the skinny Margarita.  This is usually a sad imitation of a real Margarita - but not at BJ's.  Wow - it was one of the best Margarita's I've ever had.  Waitress said they have their own special blend, and there were lemon. and orange slices on the glass. The food also was perfect.  I had the Bacon Ranch Piadina - and it was awesome - I never had anything like this before, and the fries were great too!  Others had the Quinoa Bowl, a lunch salad, and a flat bread style pizza.  All were great. Although we were on vacation, we made a special effort to eat at BJ's one more time rather than try a new place.  So good!!  Wish that there were some locations in Illinois (near Chicago!)"
Shaun A.,"Mesa, AZ",132,15,6,5.0,12/21/2015,We love BJ's. Great date night place. Highly recommend the chicken Alfredo with broccoli. It's delicious. And always save room for the pizzookie. The cookies and cream one is fantastic.
Nancy B.,"Virginia Beach, VA",3,8,5,5.0,2/6/2016,"Just had lunch with my 90 & 88 yr old parents and husband.  What a great experience.  They seated us immediately and per very patient on the pace of my parents.  David was our waiter and he was fabulous.  Very patient with us and kind to all of us.  Dad wanted sliders but in no way could he eat all 4, David suggested we order him the children's portion which was 2 sliders and perfect size. Dad even go the wedge fries which are his favorite kind. Mom had shrimp tacos and swears there were atleast 7 shrimp per taco.  Hubby and I shared tomato/basil flat bread pizza and it was great, plenty to take home.  We were planning on a cookie/ice cream dessert but we were all so full we couldn't eat any more.  We decided next time we are starting with dessert!!!!  David was a great waiter in all aspects, kind, courteous, helpful,, suggestive etc. Great Job, David!!!!"
Dani G.,"Mesa, AZ",351,22,1,5.0,2/20/2016,Yum! I love BJs! Their deep dish pizza is my absolute favorite. I'm always impressed with their food and how big their menu is.
Michele R.,"Mesa, AZ",6,12,1,2.0,9/25/2015,"Meh. I've driven past this place several times and finally tried it. Was surprised that on a Friday night there wasn't many people there. Maybe that should have been a clue. Ordered a PM Porter which was just ok and the Ahi Poke which was phenomenal. My friend had the Dark Side of the Moon blended beer which she liked and the stuffed mushrooms which were also very tasty. Then we also ordered a dish of carnitas fries topped with green chili's, pork and onions and it was awful. The service was just as bad. A waitress with zero personality. Also, the wait was ridiculous for not being very busy. We ordered dessert but after waiting twenty five minutes waiting for it we got the check and left. The bad outweighed the good and I'm afraid I won't be back anytime soon."
Peter W.,"Mesa, AZ",27,78,,5.0,1/29/2016,"Bj's restaurants are awesome! Every time i've gone I haven't been disappointed. My personal favorite are the pizzas. However, you cannot go wrong with anything. Their homemade root beers are incredible."
Christine P.,"Mesa, AZ",344,448,25,5.0,11/19/2012,"It has been 2 years since my initial review and I still faithfully visit here. My current favorites are the jalapeno burger (they fry the jalapenos and they are amazing), the 5 meat pizza, and the oreo pazookie. They also added some new pazookies to the menu and the white chocolate raspberry is amazing. The service is always fantastic, love the atmosphere, and they always have a new list of seasonal brews. They just started a loyalty card and I am saving up for the free $25 gift card. It is easy to use and I can check my balance on line. I am halfway there!"
Tonya W.,"Mesa, AZ",24,27,3,3.0,9/11/2015,"This was our first time at this chain & we were pleasantly surprised at the atmosphere & the menu selection. We were happy with the flavor of the hand crafted cream soda & impressed that it was served in chilled mugs (like A&W used to do before all the ones near us went out of business). We arrived for lunch around 2pm on a Friday afternoon & it was not too busy but also not empty.  We noticed the prices were surprisingly less expensive than Applebee's (all you can eat soup & salad for $7.95 compared to Applebees which is $9.99 & we had a bad experience at the Gilbert & Baseline location recently & don't plan on returning there) so that was a good sign. As an appetizer we ordered the queso & white corn chips. There was a choice between chili & pork, we chose chili to compare it with Chili's. We enjoyed it more than any other queso we have tried (& we have tried a lot) the problem was there weren't enough chips & I didn't detect a hint of salt on the chips at all. Since there weren't enough chips & no one came to check on us we didn't get to finish the queso as we would have liked because it was good & we were hungry. For lunch my daughters shared: Deep Dish Ravioli (Creamy cheese‑filled ravioli, Italian sausage and pepperoni, layered with BJ's signature five cheese blend, Parmesan cheese and marinara sauce. Topped with fresh chopped basil.) which also was served with a garlic knot. When the waitress heard they were sharing she asked if they would like an extra one but they don't eat much so we declined. The waitress was thoughtful enough to bring an extra plate as well. My husband ordered rootbeer wings which were served with celery & ranch. I ordered the BJ's Barbeque Lunch Platter (A pulled pork slider and a Jallelujah‑spiced chicken breast, crispy‑thin or wedge‑cut seasoned fries, BJ's signature coleslaw garnish and BJ's Jeremiah Red® Ale BBQ sauce.) The chicken was well cooked & moist but was served on top of the fries which made them a bit soggy. For $7.95 I thought it was a good price for that much food. We then ordered a salted caramel pizookie with 4 spoons. We waited quite a while for the dessert to be delivered & in that time we had dirty dishes piled on the table in front of us which no one came to remove. Finally my husband took it upon himself to move them to a nearby table AFTER the dessert was served to us & we were having trouble reaching it in the center of the table because of the other plates littering the table (which should have been removed long ago, or at least by the person who served the dessert). Our bill came to $61 which includes 3 entrees, appetizer & dessert plus 4 hand crafted sodas which I find very reasonable. We also signed up for the Rewards Club but I don't much about it yet other than you get 1 point for each dollar you spend.  We definitely plan on going back to try out more menu items & we are hoping the service will be more prompt the next time."
Heidi S.,"Gilbert, AZ",13,39,83,3.0,7/10/2015,"We like BJs handcrafted root beer & cream sodas!! Free refills and they're served in a mug - like a hand crafted beer. They're sweet and smooth. Delicious! The black cherry is less sweet than the others. The orange cream tastes the orange dreamsicles from my childhood. The cream soda and root beer are tasty too!  I ordered the dinner portion quinoa salmon dish. The quinoa was good, and there was a TON of it. Way too much to finish. The salmon was a little too salty for my liking. I ate it because I was hungry & hate to see salmon (or any protein) go to waste. The mushrooms and asparagus were good in the mix, also. More of those and less of the peppers & tomatoes will be my request if I try this dish again. My husband ordered a salad and the 5 Meat pizza. (Yeah, he's funny.) He thought the salad was overpriced for what is given. (He's in the restaurant business, so knows food costs, etc.). And he was not impressed with the pizza. It was okay.  We both enjoyed the chocolate chip pizooki. A softly baked, still warm cookie with ice cream on top...is hard not to like!! We had not been to BJs in a while, and now we remember why. It's okay, and the tab with tip was $60. We both want the quality & taste (for that price) to be a little more impressive.  The service was great! Our server was friendly, helpful and attentive despite having many tables & guests. Our wait time was 10-15 minutes at dinner time on a Thursday, so not bad at all. We just desired more from the food flavors of our entrees."
Roy H.,"Mesa, AZ",4,16,,4.0,9/18/2015,"Wait time was off by 25 minutes, but the manager did come to the table and apologize.  She also gave us a free appetizer.  I'd say that made up for the inconvenience and it was nice to know that the manager was aware of the issue.  Food was good, service was good.  I will come back again."
Jacob W.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,2,,4.0,8/12/2016,"I'm in the service industry and I appreciate a good dining experience. I was about to go to P.F. Chang's for my lunch break until I realized you guys have 2 pokestops in your restaurant. I sat at the bartop and I think my bartenders name was Rebbeca. She saw me playing on my phone and we ended up talking pokemon. Your menu is huge and I like that there are so many options.  Service was great, the food was great, and I got to get my pokemon fix. I'll definitely be back."
Jennelle E.,"San Tan Valley, AZ",1,15,,5.0,8/24/2015,"We had planned our family lunch at Red Robin since they usually have no problem seating our family of 16. This particular day we were told by the  hostess that the wait for Red Robin would be 1 hour if we wanted to all sit together or 45 mins if we were willing to split into 2 groups. A few minutes later the manager came to us and said it would be at least 1 hour 45 minutes if we all wanted to sit together.  Understanding it was a busy Sunday we said ok but walked over to BJs to see if they would have a table sooner.  The hostess immediately called the manager up to see how long it would be since they had just sat 2 large parties.  The manager was very pleasant and genuinely wanted to find us a place, not at all like Red Robin's manager. She quoted us a wait time of 1 hour but said she would try to get us seated sooner.  We were seated 30 minutes later- all together.  The food was very good and the service was excellent.  This will be our new spot for large family dinners."
Katalina R.,"Mesa, AZ",0,22,1,4.0,5/8/2014,"I AM a fan of BJ's Restaurant.  This is a go-to place for me as I eat alone many nights and as a woman, always feel comfortable sitting at the bar.  The bar tenders are all very nice and engage in conversation when they can.  The food is always great and very tasty...they've perfected the signature dishes.  The flatbreads are to die for and the burgers just could not get any better.  Salads ( fav: honey-crisp chicken) are the best. Thanks to the staff for all you do!"
Julie A.,"Gilbert, AZ",1,4,1,5.0,12/12/2015,"I love their enlightened Tuna salad, amazing. Their service is always on point when I go there. My plates are always cleared after im done eating. Love them. You have to get the Oreo pazooki"
Kathleena H.,"Mesa, AZ",46,23,1,4.0,8/6/2015,We ordered take out for six people. The service was great! The food was hot and they got the complete order correct. That is why we continue to order our take out from this B'J's. Great job guys!!
Janelle S.,"Apache Junction, AZ",0,8,,3.0,1/18/2016,Food was great. Service was pretty slow! Took about 15-20min to receive drink refills after asking for one! Maybe it was just an overwhelming busy night. Will go back!
Tiff Y.,"Honolulu, HI",6,13,5,5.0,11/17/2015,I ordered a BJ's classic pizza and the food was fantastic. The server and hostess was curteous and helped us with every question on the menus. Free parking and a relaxing atmosphere  makes this the place to be!
Amy D.,"Phoenix, AZ",1371,357,15,1.0,2/13/2014,"For my birthday every year, my parents come down from Payson to take me to lunch. We try to coordinate where to meet, and since I have a client in Gilbert, my boyfriend suggested this. Oh, and they wanted to go to Winco right after, so this seemed like a good spot. I had never in my life heard of the place. Sometimes, that's a good thing. Today, though, it wasn't. Turns out, it's just a huge room with an even bigger menu. I chose the Cobb salad.  Now, let me make one thing clear: If I am going to have a salad, I always get a Cobb salad. The Vig Uptown has my favorite one. I *know* a Cobb salad. The menu said it came with feta. F. E. T. A. on a Cobb salad. I asked the waitress to substitute the feta for blue cheese, remove the bacon (I knew it wouldn't be real bacon, and I hate bacon bits), and keep the dressing on the side. It also came with ""turkey."" Never in my life have I sent anything back to a kitchen. Ever. But there was no way I was going to let this pass. I've seen enough Kitchen Nightmares to know that Gordon would have told the server to have the chef eat that salad, just to see how horrible their food was. And that's exactly what I told her. The ""turkey"" were a bunch of cubes of white stuff on my plate, that had obviously been frozen, and had as much flavor as the iceberg lettuce. There were chopped tomatoes all over the place, and my ""cucumber"" was a tiny slice off the end of the cucumber. (see photo) She offered to bring me something else, and I declined. I didn't even want the free *$&#*$&# pizookie, that's how angry and disappointed I was. They took the ""Cobb salad"" off our bill, and we went on our merry way.  My stomach was rumbling on my way home. I fear it's going to be a looooooooooong night. From a salad. The worst salad in all the land. I will never, ever eat at any location of this hole again. I had no idea it was a chain, or I would have picked something else. I've never cried during a birthday lunch with my parents, but I was mighty close today."
Margie F.,"Queen Creek, AZ",1,36,23,5.0,4/1/2014,Always good food and brew. Service was fast and attentive.  Happy hour starts at 3 M-F.
