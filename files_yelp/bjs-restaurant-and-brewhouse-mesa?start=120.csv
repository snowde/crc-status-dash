Gordy T.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,67,,3.0,8/23/2015,Went on Saturday afternoon and it was very busy as i suspected it would be. Seated fairly promptly. Waitress was Nicole. Very pleasant and friendly. I had the new quacamole burger. Huge. Tasty but hot. It was loaded with jalapeños. Had to open the whole thing and discard some of them and i do like spicy. It was good but not 13 dollars good. Will go back but not for that burger.
LI NY Foodie R.,"Mineola, NY",0,90,17,3.0,11/18/2014,"Food is ok typical chain type food.  Servers and bar tenders were good.  We went here like everyday, because it was next to our hotel.   Lots of beers to choose from.  The beers were better than the food."
Gail N.,"Scottsdale, AZ",27,7,,5.0,11/16/2015,"We we're pleasantly surprised, thinking it was going to be a brew pub environment. But instead, it was nicely laid out and beautiful Decour. The food and service was great. We have eaten there on several occasions, and tried several items. All was very flavorful. And the prices are very reasonable as well."
Lindsey L.,"Los Angeles, CA",97,11,7,5.0,4/20/2015,"We had such a great experience I had to share.  We were seated within 5-10 minutes which was the expectation that the hostess set upon giving her my name.   This is the first time I had ever been to a BJ's.  The menu is quite large.  I will say tho, they were advertising the Committed IPA on draft, advertising it on the table.  I got excited!  When I went to order the IPA  I was told they were out.   That's annoying no matter what restaurant is involved.  DO NOT advertise a product, ESPECIALLY on the table being the first thing I see before the menu, and then not have it to sell me.    I also understand that this tends to happen in the restaurant business so no docked points for that here!  We had the Carne Asada french fri appetizer concoction.  It was delicious and perfect for 2 people to share.  We also had the Chicken Tacos and the Puled pork Sammich  ( hahaha love you Matt ) with the wedge fries aka HUGE FRENCH FRIES.  Both delicious.  I decided to order the Top Shelf Margarita with and extra shot on the side, due to the general weakness of the Margaritas made now a days.  Well... the margarita was really bad. I could BARLEY taste the Tequila!  I happened to see the manager  ""DAVID"" who had stopped by and introduced himself earlier. I expressed my concern and he personally went and made me a new margarita. I personally think that the recipe for this particular margarita is being served in too big of a glass and the measurements are out of whack. Top Shelf means Premium liquors, EXPENSIVE.  I think the drink was around $10.  For $10 I better taste more than sour mix in the margarita.  It was disappointing but expected to a point because of my habit of ordering a shot on the side to throw in it.  This particular recipe NEEDS to be RE CREATED.  After David re made the Top Shelf Margarita it was still too sweet I barley could taste the tequila ( hence the shot on the side ). So really I spent around $18 on a margarita ( quite ridiculous ). I was however very impressed with David's customer service and impeccable personality and ability to makes us smile and have a great time.  David also helped us figure out dessert to take home.  Let me let you in on a secret.... shhhhhhhhhh.....  They will special make your cookie dessert!  We got 1/2  macadamia 1/2 salted carmel!  We were treated like gold not only by David but also Kim.  Kim was very patient with us and informative.  She made great suggestions and always had a smile on her face as well as a great attitude.  We were presented with the ""BJ's Premier Rewards Loyalty Program"" by David when we were wrapping up the meal.  I signed up and we will be returning.  There are ALOT of things to try on this menu and they have TONS of good beer on tap and in the bottle.  If you like Micro Brews and strong, weird beer that you can't get just anywhere, give BJ's a shot.  They've got a nice selection.   I give them a 5 star because of the way we were treated, the great time we had because of the treatment, the more than generous and friendly staff, the atmosphere was awesome ( Dim lighting and comfortable ) we were sat quickly in a booth as we requested and the food was delicious.  We walked out of there feeling like a million bucks and VERY WELCOMED BACK!   Thanks guys!"
Dan R.,"Mesa, AZ",0,16,,4.0,4/27/2015,Menu has a ton of options from appetizers and drinks all the way to dessert. The avocado egg rolls are awesome and the new deep dish appetizers are good too. Had the BBQ chicken chopped salad and it's great and huge. The pizza cookies are always good. The Oreo one is my favorite!
Richard M.,"Yorba Linda, CA",60,39,,2.0,7/3/2015,"Bad!  And by bad I mean the food is good, the service is horrid.  Thankfully our waiter, I forget his name, was great. He had a great personality.  Front desk, needs major work. In fact just hire new people. We walk in, and are told a 15min wait. Then we stand off to the side right next to the front desk and never move!  I look out at the tables and I am seeing 4 empty tables that people got up from. At the front desk I see 4 girls and a guy all talking or on their phones. 45 minutes later, I ask how much longer. They tell me they already called me. I'm sorry?  I'm standing 3 feet away from the desk and I was never called. Not to mention the vibrating pager thing never went off.  After that, it takes about 10min to even get contacted by our waiter. I knew every course I wanted for this meal and didn't even get my drink order taken. Food also came out extremely slow. Yes they had people in the building but it wasn't packed where these long wait times could be justified. So something is wrong in the kitchen Two stars just because our waiter had a great personality, one star otherwise."
Amanda V.,"Chicago, IL",26,8,,1.0,7/21/2015,"This used to be, hands down, my favorite restaurant. I moved away 2 years ago only to move back and find that the food has become subpar at best. The avacado eggrolls were hard and lacking of filling. The salads, which used to be hearty, are now mounds of lettuce with microscopic pieces of everything else. The lettuce wraps had gray chicken accompanied by them. The calamari looked as if someone deep fried a tarantula.....which is still making me nauseated just thinking about it..... We sent everything back and never even ate. We ended up walking next door to PF changs. sorry Bjs but you wont last if you dont start making quality food again....."
Debbie L.,"Mesa, AZ",3,18,3,1.0,7/16/2015,"The only reason this restaurant even gets one star is the waiter.  He was so nice but the food was horrendous.   I ordered the ""new"" baked ziti, and it literally had a half of a cup of oil in the pan. I couldn't even eat it.   I took one bite, then looked at the pan and the grease was oozing out of it everywhere.  It was so gross and made me immediately nauseous.  We called our waiter over and he took it away and took it off our bill.  We left before my husband even finished so I think the whole meal should have been comped.  Needless to say, we won't be going back."
Alan D.,"Mesa, AZ",0,12,4,1.0,3/12/2015,"Sub par, every time. On this occasion, I ordered a California chicken club with wedge fries and extra toasted bread... the bread was soft and mushy and the fries were very greasy and flavorless. They can't even get a sandwich made right, imagine how poorly executed the rest of their dishes are..."
T M.,"Mesa, AZ",9,34,39,3.0,10/8/2014,"I ordered Parmesan crusted chicken sandwich with fries and my friend got pizza. My sandwich was ok. My fries were room temperature. My friends pizza was soggy. We told the server about the pizza and she promptly removed pizza and apologized. She had a new one made and even offered a salad for him to snack on while waiting for new pizza. The manager came over with the new pizza and apologized. Both the manager and server came back to check on him. He said pizza was ok. They comped both pizzas. I've are there before and I liked it, but today was awful. The service was great and because of that I'll give them another try sometime. My friend said he will not be back."
Johnny C.,"Redding, CA",0,4,,4.0,5/25/2016,This is one of the best places to eat. Me and my family went there last night and had a great time. The waitress was so nice and our food was pretty good. The only thing was my frys were over cooked. Other than that it was a great experience.
Mandy P.,"Broomfield, CO",0,31,,2.0,1/5/2014,"I am a long time patron of BJ's -- absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this restaurant!!! I've been to many in Colorado and Arizona, and I do have to admit this one particular location consistently, time after time, gets my order wrong. I've sent back more dishes brought to me here than any other restaurant in Arizona. If you order anything, be sure you want your  dish exactly how it's stated on the menu otherwise they will most likely get it wrong... Food - great Service - okay at best Quality - okay at best Wait-time to get your order - atrocious!!"
Lisa P.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,12,,4.0,1/23/2015,"Food was good as always but our server Ryan W. was less than courteous.  He was arrogant and rude, just about ripped my husband's plate away without asking if he was done, and never even asked about redeeming points before he brought our bill until I asked and challenged me even on that asking if he took my rewards slip or did I.  Needless to say, little  tip.  Spoke to manager, Norris, and he was very accommodating and listened to our concerns.  Will go back but will be sure not to have this server at our table.  We have always had excellent service and experiences so will shake this off."
Mark O.,"Phoenix, AZ",119,339,88,4.0,5/2/2015,"HUGE immense large menu (did I mention they have a lot of choices?) Don't bring your indecisive friends here or they will never order.  Americana food at it's finest, usually a line on the weekends, more expensive than you would like but better quality than you expect."
John A.,"Phoenix, AZ",20,4,1,4.0,7/8/2015,Blonde hostess has no people skills and rude as fuck. Great food and huge menu. Everything is delicious. Get rid of the hostess though.
Layne N.,"Tempe, AZ",8,3,,4.0,3/9/2015,"What a great place to come and relax with friends! The service isn't always consistent, but it's usually fairly decent. The food is always good and dessert is the best! Despite the inconsistency in service, I recommend this restaurant."
Kevin R.,"Apache Junction, AZ",0,9,,1.0,8/20/2015,"Went on a Saturday night to celebrate a friends birthday. The wait was understandable. Was asked for drinks promptly upon seating. Waitress did not return with the beverages until 15 or so minutes had passed. Another 10 minutes for the waitress to take our order. It was some time (another 25 minutes) until we actually got our food. The food was sub par for the price. Fries were room temperature. Chicken Alfredo was dry and not creamy. Spent more time waiting than eating. Bathroom was also a mess. Water on the counters, water on the floor. Thrash overflowing. This was our first time to this establishment and will definitely be the last. Would not recommend this place at all."
Janet R.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,2,,4.0,5/14/2016,Although the happy hour isn't great (used to be better; now only $1 off draft beers and 1/2 off flatbreads) I love going to the bar and having an early dinner. It tends to get quite busy during the dinner rush so I recommend. Food is okay but the service has always been a delightful experience. I always sit at the bar seating however. Nice spacious restaurant and I highly recommend the mini pizookies (great for one!)
Wayne S.,"Mesa, AZ",13,9,,1.0,4/23/2016,"First of all, let me just say that my wife and I frequent this restaurant at least 4 to 5 times a week. We know all the managers all the waiters and waitresses except for one manager and of all of those we have a very good relationship with. We've always enjoyed the service and the food and on occasion we might have an order that's not right but no big deal. Tonight was different, I have never been so frustrated as I was tonight. I ordered an Asian salad which they are making it differently now than what they used to. The salad was so wilted I couldn't eat it and I finally just gave up. When the waiter came back to my table I never said anything and I never complained but my friends brought it up and told him that that the salad was so bad that I just couldn't eat it. So the waiter apologized and said that he would go talk to the manager because there was only like maybe one quarter of the salad that have been eaten. It was obvious that there was a problem with the salad. So the manager comes which by the way is one of the managers that I don't know personally, and he gives me this excuse that the reason why the salad looks like that is because the chicken is warm and it makes the salad look like that. But that wasn't the reason why. The chicken wasn't even warm when they brought it to my table for one thing. And then it was obvious that the salad was not wilted  because of the chicken, it was wilted because it was just bad salad. So he apologizes and then he leaves. So my waiter comes back to the table and asked me if the manager had come to the table and asked me if the manager had  spoken to me and I said yes. And he asked me what  he said and I told him that nothing was ever mentioned about not charging me for the food. So he leaves to go find out what he is supposed to do and he is told by the manager that he explained it to me and that was good enough. The waiter felt really bad and was put in a bad position because he knows that we come in there all the time and I could tell that he felt very awkward. So on  the way out I have a few Choice words to say to the manager and he looks at me and says ""What! I was going to give you your money back"" . But that's not the way it was at all. He had a chance and he didn't do it and then all of a sudden he's trying to make it look like he had every intention to give me my money back. Needless to say I was pretty ticked. We have never been treated like that before at that restaurant And let me just say that our waiter was great.   We could tell that he felt bad about the situation and he even offered to pay for desert but I declined.   It was not his fault. Poor professionalism on the managements part."
Tucker B.,"Gilbert, AZ",17,21,2,4.0,6/3/2015,"The food here rocks, the service here rocks. The menu is very large and has many choices my wife settled on pizza and I got a burger. Top notch burger just a tad of pink like I like it super moist and seasoned perfectly. The pizza was great thin crispy crust and great toppings. The only thing that I would say and, is the reason for the 4 starts and not 5 it's pretty pricey but they have this cool app where you can download and order/pay for your food. The first time I used it I think I got $15 gift certificate. That was cool"
