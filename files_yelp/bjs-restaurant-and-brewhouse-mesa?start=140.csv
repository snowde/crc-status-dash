Toryanni E.,"Hoofddorp, The Netherlands",88,340,392,4.0,8/12/2013,Love the Buffalo Chicken Pizza! I don't recall ever having anything that I didn't like at this restaurant though!
David O.,"Advance, NC",8,13,10,5.0,1/25/2015,They have returned to the pan for the pizza. So I will raise my rating to five stars.
Mike H.,"Winchester, KY",12,172,198,2.0,10/7/2014,Here now for lunch. Cesar salad was a bit wilted. Potato wedges were underwhelming. California chicken sandwich was just ok. I'd give 2.5 stars if I could. Gordon Beirsch kills this place. Service was fast and friendly so there's that.
Brad W.,"Mesa, AZ",0,7,,5.0,7/9/2015,"BJ's is one of our regular spots.  The craft beers are always good, the food is good, and the service is good as well.  That's what we like about BJ's, it's consistently a good place to grab dinner and you know what to expect."
James V.,"Southeast Calgary, Canada",0,1,,4.0,3/29/2016,Great family spot.  Love that they bring kids starters to tide them over while we wait for our order. Had Santa Fe salad and chicken pesto flat bread. Both were great. Service was great and quick.
Berta L.,"Mesa, AZ",39,30,42,4.0,9/14/2014,Loved the food. .. loved the service.  I only gave 4 stars because they forgot to give us silverware even when they brought my husband's salad. So the salad sat there until they brought our food about 5 minutes later. The manager apologized and asked how long the salad sat there but my husband told them not to worry about it. We will definitely be back. The chicken parm was soooo good. The mashed potatoes too. Mozzarella sticks could have come with more marinara but they were crispy and gooey. Yummy! My husband had a steak and really enjoyed it. He asked for a 1 sauce before he got it but after the first bite said it didn't need sauce. Overall....yum!!!
Raul G.,"NORTH HILLS, CA",0,4,,3.0,3/18/2015,"Our waitress was Cynthia, and this hopefully isn't her fault, but my wife received her order unfinished, a pet peeve of mine. Salad was supposed to come with onion strings on top, which is what my wife was looking forward to. Cynthia brought her salad without the onion strings saying that they will be out shortly. About 5 minutes later, which is actually quite a bit for this item, a bus boy brought out the strings, not very hot. Then about 5 minutes after that, Cynthia brought out strings, which actually were hot. No excuse, no reason provided. It's obvious that someone should've picked up that the plate wasn't complete yet and not sent it out with the rest of the order. Then when we got two orders of strings, that showed there was no communication in the back."
Russell S.,"Mesa, AZ",9,7,1,5.0,9/3/2014,"Yes yes yes! I would be lying if I said BJs didn't provide excellent service an were excellent food every time I visited. The staff is friendly and I've never had a waiter or waitress that was impolite, or didn't visit my table often. I constantly had my drinks re-filled. The root beer that they create themselves is fantastic!  The deep dish pizza is easily in my top 3 pizzas in mesa. The price is reasonable, especially considering what you're getting for the money nepeta every cent and I would recommend to anyone looking for a great place to bring your friends or family!"
Bob D.,"Mesa, AZ",48,26,20,1.0,2/22/2014,Bad night for service at BJ's. I ate here with 6 of my friends after they all got their food mine did not come out.  I figured it would be out in a sec... But no after 20 min of waiting I had to track down my waiter to ask about my food.  Only to be told by her I did not order anything.  Me and everyone I was with we're 100 percent positive I did order. The waitress was rude and not helpful and tried to make me feel dumb. Nothing worse than being treated like that in front of all my friends.  Once again horrible night for BJ's
Averie K.,"Mesa, AZ",26,31,17,1.0,10/16/2014,"Horrible service!!!! I don't even think they deserve 1 star.. Waited 15 minutes for a server to come to our table, 20 minutes for drinks, 45 minutes for just an appetizer... Then another 30 minutes for my food, when they finally brought out the food you could tell that the food had been sitting under a heater or as the manager called it a ""hot line."" The there was hair in my food and all the manager did was say sorry. Said he would take care of it. Serious lack of communication because my server comes back and says oh did you still want that bread bowl!? Really?? Horrible"
Nimal N.,"Chicago, IL",0,39,,5.0,9/13/2014,"We had a great experience here tonight. I ordered a coffee and surprisingly they have a nice flavored coffee, was fresh. Went at night too, I thought it would be an old pot, but she said they make it fresh each time. Ordered pizza which was great and an appetizer. It was really busy tonight but the service was still excellent.  Last, we had the warm cookie and ice cream for desert. So amazing, you have to order this for sure. Perfect!! I liked it with my coffee, good combo."
Candace N.,"Larimore, ND",0,14,1,5.0,2/24/2016,"BJ'S Brewary is our go to place when we travel to az once or twice a year and usually end up there at least twice during our trip. We have had burgers, apps, chicken pitas and many other items.  All are delish!! We do enjoy the craft beers and sometimes have ""an extra because we are always within walking distance of our motel!! Being very responsible!!!!! On our last evening there the manager stopped by to visit and thanked us for coming to BJ'S! He was kind enough to give us a two for one beer on our bill! Very nice! We only wish this restaurant would make its way to North Dakota! Do not hesitate to give it a try....although there is usually a wait on just about every given night you can always hit the bar for a bump! A busy restaurant on a regular basis is a very good thing! Give it a try....you will be happy you did! Thumbs up all the way around!"
David L.,"San Diego, CA",22,23,,5.0,2/6/2015,"Great experience.  Service was prompt and the food was excellent. Very accommodating with substitutions for our ""Paleo"" requests. Definitely one of our ""go to"" restaurants."
Kyle S.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,27,5,5.0,9/26/2014,"Excellent service, excellent food. Their pizza is excellent and their blackened salmon is amazing. I have been several times and wait times are usually very short. Also save room for their pizookie, delicious. They even have a gluten free pizookie that I think tastes better than the other. Overall a very solid place to eat."
Alison H.,"Mesa, AZ",0,16,,1.0,8/22/2015,"This has always been a 5 star restaurant for us but last night when we brought friends to BJ'S the service was awful. We waited excessively long for everything!  The worst part of the experience  occured when the waitress pouring beer from our pitcher overflowed the glass then raised the glass over the pitcher and let the overflow run off her hand back into our pitcher contaminating our beer! We had to insist on having the pitcher replaced and the manager did come over to talk to us.  He gave us a new waiter and things improved but were still slow.  For example,  we asked for condiments and another drink, and had to ask again 10 minutes later. Food was lukewarm by the time we received condiments.   We were not offered any compensation for our troubles either.  Sadly, this won't be a regular stop for us anymore!"
Travis M.,"Gilbert, AZ",83,16,2,4.0,8/11/2012,I kinda feel like BJ's is the working mans CheeseCake Factory. HaHa. Favorite Appetizer is the Stuffed Mushrooms and their brewed root beer is pretty good. I like how there is refills on the brewed root beer.  I've yet to get something there I haven't liked. I love the blonde shrimp and can't ever go wrong with their BBQ chicken salad. The pizza cookie is pretty good.  Service has yet to be sub par. I frequent about once a month. And its always what I expect.
Edward C.,"Mesa, AZ",2,2,,4.0,12/22/2014,Great for lunch. Especially the all-you-can-eat soup and salad. The mozzarella and tomato salad is excellent. The clam chowder is also very good.
Melani P.,"Murray, UT",1,4,,5.0,1/25/2016,I love this place it's my favorite!! Their balsamic chicken is to die for. And their homemade sodas are delish! Always has a friendly staff and clean. Definitely a family favorite.
John S.,"Mesa, AZ",0,50,,1.0,5/5/2015,I got food poisoning here after eating a pasta dish with shrimp. I had to pull over and vomit to make the sick feeling go away. Everyone else in my party liked the place so I hate to knock it but when you puke your guts out before you get home it sours your opinion on a place ya know.
Amanda T.,"Mesa, AZ",163,154,62,4.0,1/5/2013,"It's always a happy surprise when coming here , either in the way of a seasonal beer or a employee who hates their job. Either way the food is always what I expect And tastes the way I remember. If I want a sure bet I come here. Love the soups and pizza lunch specials and the to go service to your car."
