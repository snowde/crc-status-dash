Rob H.,"Tumwater, WA",4,42,18,3.0,9/3/2014,"The menu had many great options and the pricing was fair. We enjoyed the craft beer and appetizers. However, the service was slow and almost nonexistent."
Nikki L.,"Mesa, AZ",128,21,,4.0,6/12/2014,I would give five stars. ..but I usually do carry out service here which is fantastic.  Amazing food and the cashier is so friendly and goes above and beyond. However with dining in experience the service I've had has always just been average and the prices are very high. Great upscale sports bar for the guys to take their ladies if they want something nicer than your typical bdubs experience.
Kristy G.,"Rexburg, ID",2,4,,4.0,4/17/2014,Great service sitting at the bar for Happy Hour...cold drink after a long day and yummy app and pizza!
Janaye B.,"Gilbert, AZ",38,11,,1.0,5/18/2012,"Cool concept and good customer service, but for the prices the food is not tastey.  My  brothers chicken was dry and my salmon had no flavor."
Nini B.,"Ontario, CA",2,12,,5.0,5/22/2014,I love this place. Great beer. Must try the sampler if it's your first time. I love the Jeremiah red. The avocado egg rolls are another must have. Yum. The menu is quite extensive with a new lower calorie fare as well. I had the salmon with couscous. Desserts ...The pazooki is a must. It's a fresh baked cookie the size of a personal pizza with a scoop of ice cream.
Karen H.,"Mesa, AZ",0,25,5,1.0,10/6/2014,"I give BJ's ONE star because every time I order something from the bar it's 99% ice and 1% liquor. I asked for a Long Island Ice Tea and I already know that restaurants fill a tall glass with ice and add as little alcohol as possible. But this last time was ridiculous!!! I couldn't even get my lips to the beverage because the ice was pouring out of the top of the glass. I ordered another one and asked the waiter to have the bartender go ""easy on the ice""...I got the same thing!!! CONSIDERING BJ'S HAS NO HAPPY HOUR, $10+ FOR A GLASS OF ICE IS OUTRAGEOUS."
Melissa G.,"Mesa, AZ",0,5,,1.0,5/16/2015,"Terrible food, terrible service. We ordered the bjs favorite deep dish. Pizza was cut poorly in uneven slices. Toppings were clustered in separate sections, one slice was bare of all toppings, even cheese, peppers and onions were raw. We then ordered a pazookie for desert, 45 mins later we finally got it and was raw. Server didn't check in with us at all while we were waiting and wasn't even on the floor for us to track her down. She said someone else took ours, had she checked in she would have caught that earlier. Management did remove from bill but did not visit table, did not see any management presence on floor."
Rose H.,"Mesa, AZ",19,29,6,4.0,7/18/2012,"BJ's Menu is expansive, the food is consistently good and the servers are always friendly. My favorites:  Stuffed mushrooms, chicken lettuce wraps, market chop salad, Parmesan chicken, watermelon mojitos & margaritas. The on-line ordering is easy as can be.  A great time saver for lunch on the run.  It's always ready when they say it will be and tastes just as good as when dining in the restaurant. Serving a full menu until closing and open until midnight on weekdays and 1am on weekends makes it the perfect late evening spot after meetings or events."
Peggy T.,"Apache Junction, AZ",58,52,10,4.0,6/18/2012,"BJ's is a regular haunt for my husband and I.  They have great selections of beer.  My favorite is the PM Porter.  The food is consistently good and they have an extensive menu.  My favorite is the shrimp tacos and my husband loves the french dip, their pizzas are also very good.  We always sit in the bar section, that eliminates the children, which can be noisy if you end up getting a table next to them.  The atmosphere is great, and the bar area has TV's with current sporting events playing. The only downside is that the service isn't always great.  Also, I've witness the staff using the parking spots in the front for themselves.  This says to me the restaurant is poorly managed.  Fix that and you'd probably have a 5 star restaurant."
Rania M.,"Mesa, AZ",0,9,,1.0,5/23/2015,"I ordered a gluten-free pizza with several vegetable toppings for pick up. I was very disappointed when I opened the box and saw that the pizza hardly had any cheese at all, like Almost none, and very scant toppings. Despite paying $17 for this 10 inch gluten-free pizza, it was no better or even worse than a frozen pizza you buy at the grocery store. Meanwhile, My husband picked up a pizza at Costco. His pizza was three times the size for $10 and very copious amounts of toppings on it. I was not impressed and will not be ordering pizza from BJ's in the future ever."
Tony R.,"Prescott, AZ",6,37,4,4.0,3/2/2015,"we going to go to On the Border Mexican Restaurant in the same center,  but the wait was so long we just went over here to BJ's.   I'm glad we did.   The waitress was very nice and service was good.  the food was very good.  My wife ordered the chicken with balsamic vinegar and caramelized onions.  This was just outright Delicious and amazing.  My Daughter ordered a steak cooked medium rare.   most of the time they get that wrong in restaurants,  here it was perfect med. rare.  I also ordered steak and asked for just medium.   it was perfect.   I'm so glad we did not go to the Mexican restaurant now.  I've found a new place to eat in Mesa!  the food was just great."
Andrea C.,"Scottsdale, AZ",3,25,5,2.0,4/27/2014,"This location has really odd customer service. My group had three adults and a baby.  The hostess tried to seat us in a 2-person booth. I strongly doubted that we could fit and, sure enough, when we all sat down, I could not sit entirely on the side I shared with another person. I couldn't see how even our plates would all fit together. The hostess was annoyed when we asked for another table, even though we clearly could not eat there and even though there were other tables available.  The food was fine--exactly like every other BJ's I've been to. I'm just going to go to another location when I decide to go again."
Joan G.,"Gold Canyon, AZ",69,179,11,4.0,11/11/2013,"BJ's started a rewards program recently on a visit. This is a nice addition to an already really good restaurant. The salad portions have gone down which for $12 for a salad, cutting out the lettuce probably isn't a good idea! The pizza's are really good. They also have a really good fried jalapeno burger. They started a lower calorie menu as well and I was really suprised that they have a pizza on there which actually was good for so few calories. Still find their pazookie's the best dessert. The white chocolate macadamian is amazing and I want one just thinking about it!"
Julie K.,"Snohomish, WA",1,4,,4.0,3/22/2013,"We are frequent flyers to BJs and have been for years!  I really like the food and my & I both enjoy their beer.  I have had a couple of experiences over the years where I have had an issue with the food not being cooked enough, or the seared ahi not being what it usually is, but they always correct it for us when we mention it.  This doesn't happen that frequently though.  We also have a favorite waitress here, but won't mention her name because she happens to be everyone's favorite and her section gets full with all of her following.  Most of the other staff is friendly and efficient as well.   It is very busy there especially during snowbird season.  So either call ahead to put your name on the list or get over 1000 points on your rewards card so you can call and make reservations.  :-)"
Matt S.,"Queen Creek, AZ",183,426,1031,5.0,10/1/2009,"Loved it!  This was my first time to this location and they did not let me down.  If you ever go here - GET THE avocado egg rolls!!  WOW amazing, and they give you this sauce that is like candy.  My niece went with me and she does not like to try anything so I got to eat all them suckers by myself!!!  haha.. I had the sliders and wedge fries and there was so much food I had lunch to bring home to my wife too.  Great service and friendly cool environment!  I will be back to try other stuff - their pasta looked delish so I wanna try that!!"
Daniel V.,"Mesa, AZ",1,29,,4.0,6/20/2014,"Okay finally a review.  Typically I am in this place once a week, why? For me two reasons.  Food quality & beer selection.  In the past few months they have paired back the menu thank god it was like the Cheesecake Factory way to many choices.  They have healthy choices for us actually looking for smaller portions and the ability to substitute vegetables for starches without an up-charge or making you fell guilty because they may have to write something down. Unlike other places in the area they have there own craft beers, but actually carry selections that would compete with there own so as consumers we have excellent choices here.  I personally like the Parana Pale Ale which is there own.   My wife and I sit in the bar area so are adopted (not really she's a Gator Fan... Roll Tide) daughter can wait on us.  Rebecca is by far the best ambassador for BJ's.  While she pretty much runs the bar (never stops) she also takes the time to greet each and everyone who sits at the bar, answers any questions and makes you feel like you are her only customer. While in the background you can see the drink orders pile up.  So if you are in East Mesa and are looking for reasonable priced food, and a great beer selection, go in Wednesday - Saturday sit at the bar, yell out loud ""Roll Tide"" and the bartender who turns and gives you a dirty look is the one you want to wait on you."
Jeremy P.,"Phoenix, AZ",170,328,46,2.0,1/4/2012,"Pretty middling.  The Black and Bleu burger was a respectable middle-tier burger.  It came with ""seasoned fries,"" but I'm pretty sure the only thing on them was salt.  I guess salt is technically a seasoning... I had their on-tap root beer, which they tout as having a slight toffee and vanilla taste.  I would've liked to taste more toffee (hardly noticeable) and less vanilla.  I'm not a fan of vanilla; it makes a root beer taste a little too weak.  Give me more sassafras, maybe a touch more wintergreen, and drop the vanilla.   Overall, it's not a bad meal for the money, but it's pretty unspectacular.  I guess you can't expect a whole lot from a pizza chain..."
Danielle L.,"Mesa, AZ",22,36,3,4.0,3/14/2014,"My husband and I frequent this establishment often. The staff is always very friendly and quick, which we like. We love their Bacon Cheeseburger Pizza, but they've taken it off the menu. Most of the time they'll make it for us anyways, but a couple times, when ordering via phone we were denied our special request."
Quincy S.,"Mesa, AZ",10,63,233,2.0,8/28/2012,"First off  I been here a lot but first time I wrote a review,  The Service was good. The atmosphere is really nice and the Food was just Ok I tried The ""Gourmet Five Meat"" Mini Pizza. The oven roasted ham made it to salty other then that it was Ok. Like I said I been here a lot but have not been awhile it seems like they're going down hill on the the food hints the reason why I don't go often."
Christine J.,"Gilbert, AZ",29,8,,5.0,9/4/2015,"Very happy with their gluten free options!  I have celiacs disease, and finding somewhere I can eat good food is a challenge.  Love the pazookie!"
