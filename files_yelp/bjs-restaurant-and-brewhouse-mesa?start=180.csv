Peggy D.,"Mesa, AZ",23,32,,5.0,4/15/2015,I have gone to this restaurant many times the food is great beer is good. so I went to pick up the order that I called in to go and a salad that they make that is really scrumptious with brussels sprouts and had before. I get all the way home and realized I left all the brussels sprouts off the salad. Well I called the restaurant of course I was upset this is my birthday dinner to myself and I got the manager and he was so kind he said I'll send someone out to deliver the salad the way it should be and a $25 gift card. Well I think that is a stellar restaurant I would always go back there I had liked them before but now I will always patronize this  restaurant check it out good food good drinks
Michael C.,"Seattle, WA",1861,1246,6539,3.0,8/9/2011,"The interior is impressive and this might be great place to watch a game and grab a brew. However, the food quality is less than impressive. I will not come here again to dine. It is a waste of money for the bland please-everyone generic style of food they serve. No surprise that the menu has everything from salmon to corn dogs to spaghetti."
Michelle H.,"Mesa, AZ",59,26,,1.0,7/21/2012,"I've been here on three different occasions. I usually enjoy in-house, micro-brew so that was the draw for me. However, I'd rate their beer better then an average tap bar but for a micro-brewery, it has pretty low points. In fact I wouldn't go out of my way to come here for the beer again.  This place is kinda a bar/restaurant, trying to appeal to beer drinkers and family diners at the same time.It's a large, high ceiling dining area that does not distinguish restaurant from bar.  The result is a large, noisy, brightly lit cavern that I found too busy and over-stimulating.  While there, my friend and I ordered drinks but we were coerced into a meal, mostly because the staff was constantly on us to order some food. On our last visit, the waiter asked us every 5 minutes if we wanted something to eat, no joke. When we finally ordered, he let up just until we finished our food. Then it was a constant interruption from him asking if we want anything else, sort of making us feel like we should not take up a table any longer if we're done eating. This was not one time, this is every time I've been there. Even sitting at the bar we got continually pestered into getting something more. The staff seems to be very high strung, sort of  like they drank 5 cups of coffee.  As for the food, I found it highly forgettable, in fact, I don't even remember what I ate. It's just as all well because I won't be going back again."
Terry A.,"Mesa, AZ",0,1,,4.0,7/9/2015,The steak was med I asked for med rare...it happens but I did let them know and the front of the house manager came out gave me extra mash which is surprisingly yummy with the black pepper gravy and ordered me another steak...med rare . we all have our chef egos but it's so nice to know that there are still people in the industry humble enough to redo something that others wouldn't flinch over . good job BJ's great customer service. 4 stars for service.
Damian S.,"Mesa, AZ",0,1,,5.0,7/6/2015,"Just enjoyed another great meal at BJ's. Rebecca the bar manager is awesome, so attentive and friendly.  Bj's is a great place for a top quality meal served in a friendly welcoming atmosphere.  I'll definitely  be back."
Jim F.,"Phoenix, AZ",7,28,9,2.0,3/8/2014,Fettuccine Alfredo beyond belief dry and tasteless.  Grilled chicken dry and tasteless.  Prices way too high for quality of food. Beer was good though. Can't understand how this place is so busy.  Much better options available with local businesses. Avoid this chain.
John N.,"Gilbert, AZ",32,7,,4.0,3/26/2014,Good beer and good pizza.  The new goliath ale is very good.  Kids like the mashed potatoes.   Always busy
Sarah F.,"Apache Junction, AZ",33,227,46,5.0,2/10/2012,"Never had a bad meal here.  The selection is great and the drink menu is much, much, much improved!"
Brian B.,"Lawrenceville, GA",52,62,44,5.0,8/31/2011,One of my local favorites.  Avocado rolls are delicious and the selection of micro-brews should satisfy any beer aficionado's taste.   Love the atmosphere and the service is generally top notch.  (We had one experience where a waitress in the bar/booth section could have used a little more training is customer service and attentiveness) Food selection and quality/taste was superb.  If you time it during their lunch specials and/or happy hours you can save some money.
John H.,"Surprise, AZ",0,11,,1.0,6/23/2014,"A French Dip that's twice the price and half the size of Arbys, and almost not as good."
Ralph P.,"Buena Park, CA",1543,184,843,3.0,2/11/2012,"Elizabeth and I came over to BJ's after being thoroughly disgusted with PF Chang's next door... BJ has pretty good food, fairly good service and they seated us right away... There is not much that i would consider exceptional about BJ's except perhaps their extensive menu and the variety of choices provided.  There are plenty of Televisions and the selection of beer is great.  All in all ""A-OK"" is a bulls eye for rating this establishment... I had the Bleu Burger and it was very good.  My wife had the Miso Salmon over Japanese rice and she really liked her meal a lot.  The refills are sparse and you prctically have to throw a fit to get a glass of water, but this restaurant is a safe bet for a good meal at a fair price."
Erin M.,"Seattle, WA",417,596,1806,4.0,2/27/2011,Best to eat here for happy hour! My friends and I got: Avacado Egg Rolls. Rating: 4/5 Fried Calamari. Rating: 4/5 Stuffed Mushrooms. Rating: 4/5 2 drinks 1 Pazookie And the bill tab was only $13 per person - so cheap! They've also got good beer!
Brian F.,"Fredericksburg, VA",1051,32,12,5.0,2/18/2012,Great food and beer are a great combo!! Best chicken dish I have ever had is their parm crusted chicken!!  Caesar salad is always fresh and huge portion Pair it with a Piranha Ale!! We go atleast once a month!
Judy M.,"Mesa, AZ",8,18,,1.0,5/4/2015,"We decided to head for BJ's over Fuddruckers last week. I ordered my favorite Jalopena Burger medium.  My hubby ordered sliders well done. When they came out everything looked beautiful, like a picture. I took a bite of my tough burger. My husband opened up his burger and it was medium. I do no appreciate overly done meat and my hubby likes his cooked til it's dead! When the waitress came back we made the decision to have our meal done again. When my burger came out, the presentation was not very comforting. It was not built up the way the previous burger had been served. This time my wedge fries came out over done and lukewarm! My hubby noticed that his wedge fries were also overdone this time round. I took a few bites out of my burger and left all my wedge fries which are normally scarfed up first thing. I left a whole burger on my plate. I said WE WILL NEVER GO BACK. I do believe it is the way things are said to the cooks in the kitchen. They tork them off with some comment about the food. What should be done, is just put in another order. After the food is checked, THEN the comment can be made about the first order for this customer. This way the manager, who SHOULD be bringing out the replacement dish can see with their own eyes what is on the plate. I can say the coffee is good."
Courtney W.,"Phoenix, AZ",49,125,3,1.0,8/16/2013,"I do not get the draw.  Always packed, mediocre food and service.  Are we THAT desperate for a decent restaurant in the East Valley that we have to resort to this place?"
Amy S.,"Gilbert, AZ",210,214,47,5.0,1/14/2009,"BJ's is one of my favorite restaurants in the east valley (and I'm shocked to read the negative reviews done before mine). Over the last 2 years, I've probably been there for a few dozen visits with my biggest complaint being that they are extremely busy during your common weekend meal hours. The servers have always been more than attentive and will even offer free samples of their made-in-house microbrews if you seem unsure of your beer selection. Personally, I get excited each fall for their seasonal selection called ""nitwit""- it's a wheat beer, similar to a hef, with a hint of orange just gives it a unique coloring and taste.  They have many options for meals, with some of my favorites being their salads (very large size, I have yet to finish one), their baked potatoes (over a pound, then stuffed with your favorites), chicago-style stuffed pizza, and signaure sandwiches (the crispy chicken is my favorite, by far). And, of course, you can't pass up dessert at BJ's- they have pizzookies. For anyone who might not have already been introduced, a pizzookie is a big cookie (in a personal pizza sized pan), baked to be slightly gooey with a couple scoops of ice cream on top."
B N.,"Queen Creek, AZ",0,15,1,1.0,8/18/2014,"An absolute disappointment. We came here for the beer tasting/dinner and it was sub par. $30 per person for one slice of pizza, half a chicken entree and 5 shots of beer. Overall, our group of 6 spent upwards of $180 and we left feeling like we needed to go somewhere else for dinner and a beer.  We were told prior to the event that we would leave happy but we definitely left the feeling the opposite! Avoid this at all costs!"
Jenney H.,"Maricopa, AZ",13,33,1,4.0,9/27/2013,From what I could tell this restaurant is amazing. I chose a Cheese Burger with the Steak Fries and the Brewhouse Porter Beer. All that is left to say about this place is the food is great and the Beer amazing!
Ryan J.,"Scottsdale, AZ",474,557,3,4.0,6/26/2010,"We don't eat at many national chain restaurants.  But when we do, we prefer BJ's."
Matt T.,"Mesa, AZ",19,64,5,4.0,8/1/2010,"We've been going to BJ's for years. Since the first on opened in AZ. This one just happens to be a little closer to where we live now so we go to this one more often than not. There is some good and some bad here. Good: The food is usually pretty solid. Havent really had anything here that I was unhappy with. The menu is huge so if you come with a med-large party, theres going to be something for everyone. They have a good selection of beer and a full bar. They have a great Raspberry Cider that my wife loves! The bar area is great for happy hour and a game. Bad: They call this a brewery...and it isnt. Its a restaurant that serves beer that the OTHER BJ's makes. This might not matter to you but it does to me. Weak! Because they're not an actual brewery, their liquor license is different and they cant fill the BJ's growler that I bought. Oh well, I'll use it to hold my change and I'll get my other growlers filled at real breweries. We've also experienced ""Dirty Lines"" here before. They should have their beer lines cleaned more often or more thoroughly or both.  Best part of the menu: Do not leave without having the Pizookie for dessert. It is one of the best things you can put in your mouth!"
