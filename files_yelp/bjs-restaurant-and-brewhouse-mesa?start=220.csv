Rebecca H.,"Tempe, AZ",130,18,1,4.0,4/25/2012,"I had dinner here a couple of weeks ago and it was good. Service was fine, food portions were huge, nice selection of drinks and food! My friend ordered a side salad that she returned because it tasted like the refrigerator.  Overall, the place was pretty good."
Andy G.,"Ithaca, NY",245,445,10,3.0,10/26/2009,"Hey, a restaurant that sells food and brews their own beer. What a novel concept! Not. BJ's is a chain and they do pretty good by their patrons. I can never go to a restaurant that serves fish and chips and not order it, so that's all I've ever had at BJ's. It pales in comparison to places that fry fresh fish, but it's passable. The beers are decent. Then again, so is Newcastle and Blue Moon and Bud that you can get on tap anywhere. The real opportunity for BJ's is to put together interesting pairings and make it a real brewhouse. They do have pairings suggested in their menu, but most of them fall flat. A blonde ale with fish and chips? No, sir. I don't care that you breaded the fish with the same ale. Do you think your average Brit would be caught dead drinking ""blonde ale"", with or without fish and chips? Hells no. Stouts and porters, man. It would be better if the waitstaff were a bit hip to the beers and could speak about them intelligently. As it is, they can regurgitate what's already written in the menu and that's about it. Most of them clearly have not even tried all the beers served there. That should be Day 1 of new hire training at BJ's. Get sloshed and take a cab home.  They need a sommelier, except for beer. Does that exist?"
Forest F.,"Gilbert, AZ",67,5,,2.0,8/13/2011,"I've been there with my wife 3 times in the past 5 months. Every time we go, the food is amazing, however the service has been unsatisfactory all 3 times as well. They really need to improve their service. We went there tonight at 8pm and the service was acting as though it was 3am...like he was tired and just didn't care."
Lori M.,"Mesa, AZ",106,313,73,3.0,1/14/2009,"On our way out the the mall we were trying to decide where to stop and eat when we spotted this place and decided to stop in and check it out. They were pretty busy but we found a both in the bar area with no problems. Nice open space in the restaurant but it does get pretty loud.  I had the Parmesan crusted chicken which came with cheddar mashed potatoes and broccoli and my boyfriend had the french dip with fries. His french dip was good, nothing special about it. My chicken was good although the mashed potatoes could have been creamier and I could have used some more of the lemon Chardonnay butter sauce with my chicken, but overall the meal was good. Didn't have enough room for dessert, maybe next time."
Brandon N.,"Mesa, AZ",27,56,16,2.0,12/11/2008,This place does not need to exist. Period.
Carina M.,"Seattle, WA",273,982,176,4.0,5/12/2008,"I actually find myself driving out to this BJs instead of going to the one in Chandler. It's more of a trek, but I don't have to deal with crappy mall parking. Ok, this one is next to a PF Chang's (don't get me started on that...I HATE that place), Chipotle, Red Robin and a very defunct Krispy Kreme (*cries*...maybe it's best that it's closed). The reason I always go to this BJs is...the salad. The BJs at the Chandler Mall makes me angry. Very angry. If I am going to fork (no pun intended) over $10+ for a salad, you had damn well better give me more friggin lettuce. I've been to the one in Chandler a few times and will write a review on their beer. I'm also a fan of their regular pub fare-ish food - burgers, chicken wings, fries, etc. But it's their salads that keep me coming back. I'm a huge lover of their Garden Medley with grilled chicken and Field of Greens. This BJ's can't go wrong!"
Nicholas P.,"Mesa, AZ",110,13,1,5.0,1/26/2012,"Great food, ambiance & service, love this just wish they did not get rid of the fields of green salad!"
Rafael R.,"San Francisco, CA",31,544,65,1.0,5/27/2008,"What the h*ll? We had just finished up a conference in the Mesa area and with few dining options available at 11:00 pm, other than Denny's, and that was NOT going to happen, we opted for BJ's Brew House.  As a adamant hater of chain restaurants, I did not have high expectations of this establishment and, well, still don't.  Yes, it's cheap, the food offerings mediocre and boring and the service disinterested, but when the choices are between Denny's and BJ's, I'll opt to fast for the evening next time.  Really, it is a small wonder why those who live in the suburbs are so overweight with so few healthy dining options."
Brian G.,"Mesa, AZ",0,15,,5.0,11/14/2010,I have visited this location many times and the food and service is always excellent. I have only ever ordered their Buffalo Chicken Pizza but the company I have visited with have ordered their salads and they said they were great! Plus you get plenty of food for your money. For an added bonus their pizookie's are awesome!
Jason H.,"Gilbert, AZ",10,46,4,3.0,6/23/2012,"We've eaten here a couple of times, so this review is a summation of those visits. I have tried a couple of things from the light menu and a couple of salads not on the light menu. The light deep dish pizza is OK. It's an individual size pizza with grilled veggies. It's just OK. They don't smother the thing in cheese, which is probably the easiest way to keep the calories on this item under 600. I've also tried a chicken dish from the light menu. It was unremarkable. As far as regular salads go, the steak salad is OK, as is the seared ahi salad. The ahi salad is probably the best thing I've tried. My wife has been more diverse: she's had one of the baked potatoes (meh) and the spaghetti (also meh). It's not that the food is bad here, it's just unremarkable. We'll go back. My kid likes the place and there are plenty of things I haven't tried yet. One of these days I will actually try one of their beers (hard to mess that up)."
Shannon B. J.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,19,,2.0,2/16/2011,"BJ's...what has happened to you? I always thought you were above average, but today was a terrible experience.  We arrived after the regular lunch crowd and had to take a buzze and waitr.  At least half of the tables were empty, so we assumed maybe some of the staff had called in sick. We waited almost 20 minutes and were finallly buzzed.  Our waiter was way out in lala land.  He took our drink orders and brought have of them and then told the rest of us, ""I had forgot what your ordered.""  We both ordered...ice tea!  He was very unattentive.  We had to get up and find our own napkins and flatware.  After a hamburger was brought, we had to find our own ketchup and mustard.  We were brought wrong orders and were never offered refills on our drinks. We were very disappointed in our service and the food was just OK."
Erik F.,"Claremont, CA",0,4,,4.0,1/9/2011,"BJ's is a chain, but as far as chains go, they are better than most.  They have a huge menu, and I've never had a bad meal.  My favorites are the flat bread pizzas, bread bowl soups, and the sandwiches.   The large selection continues with the beer, including a BJ's ""brand"".  I'm not sure where they are brewed, but it is not on the premises.  Some are better than others, and I prefer the Nutty Brewnette and the porter. I've never had a real problem with the service, but with any chain it can be hit or miss.  Also, they are often very busy, especially Friday and Saturday nights, and you may experience slightly slower service due to the volume of patrons.  To avoid the wait time to be seated, you can call ahead and they will put your name on the seating list. The happy hour is excellent, 3-7 on weekdays, cheap-er appetizers that are all pretty solid, and discounted BJ's beer.  The only problem is that you have to sit in the bar area, which can fill up quickly. The take out service is very good, which is a plus since the restaurant can be so busy.  Little touches go a long way such as keeping warm food warm, not adding fries to the order until you arrive, and keeping the soup in a separate container from the bread bowl so you can combine them when you are ready to eat.  They also go over your entire order to ensure that it is exactly what you asked for."
Ivy V.,"Phoenix, AZ",3,94,,4.0,3/17/2010,"I'ts been awhile since I've been to this location, but I have always remembered that they have great service and food - which is all that you really want out of a dining experience, right? :) Try the pizookies there, too (or it called something else? Can't remember...) because they are AMAZING!!!"
Gerry C.,"Mesa, AZ",0,11,,1.0,11/12/2012,"Went to BJ's the other night for the second time, bad mistake! Ordered their deep dish pizza; very dry with lack of incredance which I would not have mentioned, although the pizza came out cold. I told the server and she took it back to be warmed up. When it came back out after another 15 min wait, it was hardly warm! This happened to me on first visit to BJ's getting a cold meal from the kitchen. The manager did reduce the cost of my bill based on this, although after having this happen to me twice now, I won't be back!"
Linda C.,"Mesa, AZ",46,7,,5.0,11/5/2012,"This is the 1st time we've been to BJ's & we've lived in AZ always.  It was a pleasant surprise when we walked in & saw the decorating of the interior; loved the dark woods & the industrial feel of the ceiling; it was warm & inviting & felt like an Old World theme.  The food we ordered was very tasty; no complaints.  We had Rachel as our server; she was very pleasant & professional & helped me with choosing the right kind of beer!  The hostess was very sweet & seated us quickly.  I've read some of the other reviews before we went & was rather taken back by customers indicating the food was ok or the service was not good!  We had no problem & plan on going back once more to make sure & if we get the service we did this evening & the quality of the food we had this evening, we will bring back our friends to enjoy the atmosphere!"
Andy M.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,9,2,5.0,9/3/2010,"I've been to this BJ's many times and I have gotten great service & food every time.  They often have a wait to get a seat which is never a problem because it is never really long, they get you sat pretty quickly.  Clean restrooms and restaurant overall very sanitary (one little pet peeve).  The management team is also very helpful to their employees and are constantly walking around to make sure everything is going well.  The bussers are right on taking plates and breaking down the tables and the food runners are quick and like assisting"
Brian L.,"Phoenix, AZ",144,108,,5.0,5/7/2009,"BJ's is one of my favorite places to eat.  Their pizza, sandwiches, and pasta dishes are all awesome.  The drink selection is great.  I've never had bad service here."
George P.,"Mesa, AZ",109,92,4,4.0,10/31/2008,"Well, wow this place is getting slammed!!! maybe rightfully so, but I have never had a problem with their desserts, my girlfriend and I will sometimes go there just for dessert and that is it. We ate there once and they did take a few more minutes than I thought they should have, but wouldn't stop me from going back again."
mark g.,"Mesa, AZ",64,325,103,2.0,7/31/2009,why does bj's leave me cold ???? they have a cool name.....they have beer.......i had a hefe the other day I guess it's there version  it was cold  and flavorless like water. There apps are decent and we have had lunch there before it was good sometimes the service is good other times just mediocre ........oh bj's I may return someday but your not high on my list
CARRIE G.,"Mesa, AZ",0,15,,2.0,9/17/2008,"They can't seem to get anything right.  Even dessert, a pizzokie they screwed up.  Then it took 15 minutes to get the correct dessert out!  Poor service, way too long of a wait for food, drinks and refills.   Go elsewhere, you'll be happier."
