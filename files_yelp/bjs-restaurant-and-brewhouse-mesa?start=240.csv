Rhonda S.,"Gilbert, AZ",7,44,99,3.0,4/23/2009,"A group of us went during the work day in between meetings. We were a group of 6 and were quickly seated in a very comfortable booth. It was 11:45 and busy so the getting a large booth right away was nice. Very pleasing ambience, and yummy smells were noticeable on the way to our booth. Our waiter was nice, but a little condescending. We ordered drinks, and he eventually got it right. Our food came and all were satisfied! I had the fish tacos and they were divine with a little avocado and salsa on the side. Very ,very nice, and very ,very tasty. Others had the giant stuffed potato-they were giant, and loved them. The 2 salads that arrived were so fresh and crisp. The people that ate them said they were delish. It took a little while to get our bill, and then to get the change. At lunch, I'd like to see that happen a little faster as we were almost late back to work. All in all, a nice experience with really good food."
