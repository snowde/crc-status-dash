Walter C.,"Scottsdale, AZ",35,26,,2.0,3/31/2017,Came here with my daughter for dinner. They seriously under estimated the wait time. Then the dinner was seriously subpar. I had rice with my meal which in lauded hard baked kernels of rice in each mouthful. My daughters mashed potatoes were so bad she wouldn't eat them. I tried them and the tasted like poorly done instant potatoes . I won't return
Sean T.,"Gilbert, AZ",253,42,40,4.0,6/1/2016,This place is always great to eat at!! Service is good. Only reason they get a 4 star is the wait is always a little long.  If you can wait this place is worth it.  I always come and get the pizza and make sure to leave off with the cookie
James P.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,61,,1.0,11/29/2016,"Our one night out with the kids and we get seated near the Point of Sale system. For 45 minutes, I hear the same 4 employees bickering and complaining about tables, their manager, bickering between each other who has what table and the customers at each table. I wanted to enjoy my meal and ignore the talk but it was difficult. If you don't like your job, get another job. Very simple. We're your clients. Act like it. Thanks waiters/waitresses for ruining our experience. Our waiter was friendly and nice so this review is not about him. Our poor friend at the table had to send his burger back because it was burnt to a crisp and sent out to him. There is no quality control with the food? Gave him my fries while he waited, and waited, and waited for another burger.  What kind of place is this? Not sure if I'd be back."
Barb Bent D.,"Mesa, AZ",0,1,,5.0,2/25/2017,Always have a great meal at BJ's. We were there the other night and my husband was very disappointed they no longer served their skinny French fries
Bob R.,"Mesa, AZ",1,10,,5.0,12/19/2016,"Lots of choices around when it comes to this type of restaurant but this place outdoes them all.  About as good a burger as you will find anywhere.  My favorite, the Black and Blue, and I don't usually even like blue cheese."
Bob G.,"Mesa, AZ",5,138,,1.0,1/21/2017,"It was a Friday night , i  waited in line for like an hour and I ordered the jambalaya all that wait and it tasted like out of a can! For the price they charge!! Not worth it!"
Laci A.,"Mesa, AZ",244,12,12,5.0,10/8/2016,"Rebecca A. at Superstition Springs BJ's in Mesa is absolutely amazing! We were waiting for our server to come greet us and after 20 minutes of no service we decided to leave. We were walking out and the bartender, Rebecca came outside and apologized. She asked us to come back inside and sit at the bar. She let her manager, Steve know and he paid for one of our meals. We were very satisfied. Thank you for making it right guys! Customer service is everything!"
Bentley Y.,"Mesa, AZ",0,13,4,5.0,9/5/2016,I absolutely love this place! Food is amazing and so is their handcrafted root beer! You won't wanna miss out on this place.
Shannon E.,"Gilbert, AZ",323,322,205,4.0,6/15/2015,"Delicious margaritas in a beautiful setting with stellar customer service.   A margarita on the rocks with no salt is my go-to drink and it's fair to say that I've had my fair share of margaritas at different bars and restaurants all across the Valley and this one was THE BEST, hands down.   It was expertly mixed, with just the right amount of alcohol and citrus tanginess, served tall, on the rocks and garnished with slices of lemon and lime and most importantly NO salt.  You can ruin a margarita for me by ignoring my 'no salt' request, thankfully our server was paying close attention. Rumor has it, there was food in front of me too, but it was secondary to that amazing margarita. So for those nights where I prefer to drink my dinner (don't judge) this is the place. Margaritas: Not *just* for breakfast anymore."
Erik B.,"Glendale, AZ",99,30,30,1.0,6/11/2017,We got here around 5 we expected to be a little busy it wasn't we were here for a birthday party and there was already another party going on between the two parties of over 10 guest only had one server and no help we got in there and I waited over 25 minutes to get a drink then we order our food ordered appetizers which were actually pretty decent then we ordered food my food came out called my wife food came out completely wrong I had ordered the ribeye steak and it was extremely dry I like my steaks medium rare and my steak was extremely dry I never put A1 sauce on it had to get that I ordered an alcohol drink and it was just straight alcohol no flavor to it whatsoever best time to put on the hockey game on the TV which they did and 5 minutes later they changed it again to a soccer game and I went up and asked why the hockey game was changed to go because somebody else want to watch the soccer game like but I was here first watching hockey finally changed it back the food is way overpriced horrible service I set with an empty water glass for almost 40 minutes and didn't drink it in my alcohol drink it was disgusting
Jules P.,"Gilbert, AZ",23,3,,2.0,8/6/2017,After 15 minutes with no service we almost got up and left. Service was extremely slow.  There were multiple issues with our orders and one dish came out after everyone else was finished. We will not be returning to this restaurant.
Z L.,"Chandler, AZ",89,78,3,1.0,5/4/2017,"Its lunchtime, I walk in with two other people and seated right away by the very gracious hostess.  We then to proceed to sit there for 15 minutes with no water, no drinks, no waitress.  I watched two of them stand by the booth they congregate at, then two waitresses walk by to other tables and take orders one of those being a couple who arrived after we did.  I am always more patient at lunch because I understand its busy but it was not busy at all.  We finally got up and walked out, went next door to PF Changs and had a really nice lunch.  Pathetic!"
Philip G.,"Phoenix, AZ",16,10,6,5.0,1/1/2017,So we had the fish tacos and the fish and chips. We are really satisfied with our choices. And because it's new years we get a free dessert. Yummy. Also what's great about this day is that my gf and I tried to come here on our first date over a year ago and it was so busy we went somewhere eles. So it's nice to come back to and have that date.
Kaycie G.,"Gilbert, AZ",91,1,,2.0,5/31/2017,"Personally, i work in a restaurant so i ultimately have high expectations. but even somebody who doesn't work in a restaurant would have seen the awful service being put forth. We came in for my sisters birthday and we had a server start us off by getting us drinks. my friend got a pepsi and it was out of syrup so he got her another one without even replacing the syrup so it tasted the exact same. nobody in the restaurant could figure out how to fix it so we all got different drinks. So then we had another server take care of us which was strange. There wasn't a large variety of food on the menu. So when the food comes out it's basically a child sized proportion. Anywayssss, the server brings out the cake when our party had gone outside, she sets it down and leaves and doesn't even bring out forks or plates with it. then we went and grabbed her to order pazookies because she was seriously never around. she brings out the pazookies and doesn't even bring out the birthday girls dessert. By the time she got her cookie we had all finished ours. The only decent person was the hostess and the manager, i feel bad for both of them :( only coming back for pazookies."
S S.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,19,,5.0,7/4/2017,"In Phoenix from FL for unexpected visit. Staying at La Quinta in Mesa. Front desk clerk recommended this restaurant & LQ guests receive 10% discount. So glad she did! I had chicken specialty w/ mashed potatoes & broccoli, DTR had salad, both delicious, would definitely recommend this place! And return..."
Marcy A.,"Mesa, AZ",44,21,15,1.0,1/16/2017,Worst service ever!  I ordered soup and it came without crackers.  When I asked for them they didn't come until I was almost finished.  My husband ordered a salad with his spaghetti.  The salad didn't come until he was half finished with his spaghetti.  No apology for any of it.  The food was mediocre at best.
David S.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,11,,5.0,7/13/2017,Took my daughter to lunch who loves BJ's broccoli cheddar soup. She order it and it was delivered to the table with a small clothing label in it. I called it out to our waiter and he apologized and brought her a new bowl. What I liked best was that the manager came over immediately and also apologized for the inconvenience. She also bought our lunch for us which wasn't necessary but to me the was outstanding customer service which will definitely bring us back. Great manager and waiter during this visit.
Moe G.,"Bellmore, NY",3,105,,4.0,9/11/2016,"Great house brews (the porter was as good as any I've had anywhere) and an extensive soup to nuts brewpub menu at extremely reasonable prices. We tried the guac/bacon burger, ahi poke app and the salmon quinoa bowl....all hits, no misses. For a. chain brewpub, this place is pretty hard to argue with. Big nicely laid out room with perefectly nice servers.  Can't go wrong here. At this price point, the place is a no-brainer."
Parker R.,"San Diego, CA",159,12,4,4.0,6/1/2016,Great food and quick service! Our waiter got all our orders correct and was quick to get our food out. The food was awesome and was well worth our night! The BBQ burger and white pizza are great choices on the menu.
Sandi J.,"Mesa, AZ",0,6,,5.0,6/27/2017,Great place to go for excellent food & top notch beer!  The BEST!  Look forward to going every time!
