LaToya B.,"Avondale, AZ",95,64,92,4.0,4/9/2016,"This place is amazing and always packed. Despite the fact that their always busy we're still seated and with drinks in 20 minutes or less. Love that about BJ. First time at this location as we live in Avondale. My daughter won 2nd place in her dance competition and wanted BJs as her celebratory dinner. The sitting arrangements were a tad bit uncomfortable as they sat us in the back which was a little tight, but the waiter made up for the discrepancies with his awesome service.  Food was amazing as always. Girls had pizza (the reason we came to BJs) and I had the kale and brussel sprout salad."
David C.,"Mesa, AZ",1,23,,5.0,11/12/2016,"went there yesterday for the Veteran's Day special. Turns out they allowed you to pick out anything in the menu and they paid for it. I had the beef brisket cheeseburger with smokey bbq sauce. Executed perfectly and tasted fantastic. their signature beers were only $5 for me and my guests. I just want to thank BJ's for making an old veteran feel appreciated. and in the words of MacArthur, I shall return!!!"
Cassidy S.,"Mesa, AZ",0,2,,1.0,8/6/2016,"Went here with my boyfriend and ordered a cocktail and asked for a double. They brought me a shot on the side and didn't tell me the price of the bourbon. Ended up paying  $26 for one lousy drink?? Tell someone when a shot is more than the drink itself because you aren't ""allowed"" to make a double"
Debby C.,"La Quinta, CA",0,2,6,5.0,5/13/2017,"Had a 60th birthday party for 15 people.   Our server, Dillon, did an excellent job on our order - drinks were kept full, appetizers all came out at the same time, even our entrees all came out together and were excellent.   Dillon was very attentive and gave great suggestions.   We highly recommend taking your large get together to BJs."
Denise K.,"Tucson, AZ",37,162,79,3.0,2/10/2016,This place had below average customer  service. Plus took a long time for our food to arrive. After waiting for a long time before we even recieved drinks. Never received refills or even silverware or napkins. I had to go find some from another waiter. The food was good and that's the reason for the rating.
Sherry C.,"Mesa, AZ",24,66,108,5.0,10/15/2015,I love BJ's Restaurant and their many variety menu and beer list. They are alway shaking with the newest brew flavored developed in their chandler brewery.  Happy hour is extended till 7 pm most days I love the cherry chipotle salmon. I have had their salads and pizza as well. Their burgers are beyond amazing. They have shoestring fries that are sooooo good Finish off the meal with a poozkie-cookie in a skillet with ice cream. They make a donation to charity each time you buy one regardless of the time of year  You cannot go wrong with a great meal for lunch or dinner here
Gina G.,"Gilbert, AZ",3,42,1,2.0,2/20/2017,"I really wanted to like this place.   Called ahead for party of 6 to be seated at 6:30.  We arrived are 6:15 and were seated at 7:30 to a 4 top table with 6 chairs.  They realized we didn't fit so ended up pulling 2 tables together. Finally we order,  one of our party is a pescetarian and asks for salmon, they are out if salmon.  She asks what  pescetarian friendly dishes  they offer and the waitress who was vegan recommended that shrimp dish.  So now all salads are delivered however we still have no flatware we asked two different people for silverware and it wasn't until our waitress came to the table to see how are salads were that she realized we couldnt eat therm.   Next comes the food.  The shrimp dish smells like chicken.   We ask them to check and found that the dish was made with chicken stock.  Our server cane to the table apologetic.   She asked if she could bring something else.  We asked for the stuffed mushrooms, the server  rushed it however they still did not get to the table until we were done with the rest of the meals. Check please...I find that we were charged for those mushrooms.  As far as the food goes the ribs were good everything else on the table was Applebee's quality. Beer was great of course.  This was my son's birthday dinner so I guess my disappointment was intensified."
Ching K.,"Mesa, AZ",1,23,,4.0,3/20/2017,"Busy place but since there were only 3 of us, we got seated right away. Menu- found it disorganized and descriptions were in tiny print. My husband snd I split a full rack of ribs- tender, with a nice peppery rub. Glad the sauce was served on the side. A little on the sweet side. The clam chowder we chose for one of the 2 sides was a tad salty and not as hot as I would have liked. The wedge salad was good. Our friend said the Thai noodles he ordered were perfect."
H J.,"Mesa, AZ",5,7,,4.0,10/7/2016,I like going to BJ's one for the atmosphere and two for the beer. They brew their own beer and occasionally have specialty/seasonal beers. Also their burgers are delicious. Just wish they had more variety of dinners. Seems like they want to specialize in pizza.
Mari A.,"Gilbert, AZ",1,80,112,1.0,9/20/2015,"Absolutely awful at this location. I have came here 5 times and it is time for my review. The hostesses at this location are always talking and do not acknowledge customers even where there is not a lot of people, they stand there with no direction. My fiancé and I get to our table the seat was covered in grease and pizza crust. I asked our hostes if I could get a towel to wipe it down and she replyed with ""oh my god""  and returned half way through our meal with a rag. Our service was absolutely awful like always and waiter got our food order wrong twice. Will not come back"
Christie C.,"Apache Junction, AZ",9,95,6,1.0,6/9/2016,"So I had lunch with a friend at 1145.  I had 1/2 sandwich and salad. I had the chicken club. It had an oddly sweet sour taste and I quit after 1 bite.  I ate the frys and the wedge salad so I was good.  Didn't send it back or complain cause I am not really a complainer.  A few hours later I was sick, throwing up no fever.  I don't know for sure, but I'm guessing it was the bad chicken.  Not going there again."
Kay K.,"Mesa, AZ",7,12,,5.0,2/7/2017,Love to take visitors to BJ's. Their menu has something for everyone. Especially love their soup/salad for lunch. If you seconds you have the option to try a different choice of each. I'm seldom that hungry but I've had friends who appreciate the opportunity to try another option. Never had anything that wasn't very good.
Corey E.,"Buckeye, AZ",6,40,359,4.0,1/16/2016,"This place had a beautiful décor, service was really good and the food was ok. Menu was like a novel. About 18 pages long. Lol. I had soup and salad. Can hardly go wrong with that, but turns out my Cheese Broccoli soup was basically Cheese Cheese soup...entirely so cheesy I had to switch it out. The tomato bisque was hardly better. I suggest they bring back chicken noodle soup that the server said they had once before and took off the menu. Friend had blue cheese turkey sandwich and french fries he said it was good; could taste every flavor and it was a nice portion size he could only eat half. Total of about 25.00. Not bad for a Saturday afternoon."
April B.,"Chandler, AZ",10,20,2,1.0,8/3/2015,"This was my first time at this particular location. We usually go to the location in Chandler without any complaints. To start off my experience, I called ahead to see if I could make a reservation for 10 (a bunch of nurses who want to meet up after work, around 8pm when then dinner crowd would be dying down, I would think). I was on hold for 15 minutes while the hostess ""checked with her manager to see if the reservation was possible."" After 15 minutes of being on hold, I hung up and called back. She apologized that nobody ever picked up the phone and that their paging system is faulty. She then told me that the reservation at time I was requesting would not be possible because they were too busy. I told her to put us down for the earliest time possible which was about 30-45 minutes from my requested time, which we could work with, she also said the bar was first come first serve, so I figured we could grab a beer and appetizers in the bar while we wait for a table to open up.  When we arrived, I check In for our reservation and told them we would be in the bar waiting. it was pretty busy in the dining room but we were able to find some scattered spots at the bar and high tops. Our server in the bar seemed overwhelmed and had a bit of an attitude. Another part of our group at the bar also said the bartender had a bad attitude as well.  We had a round of drinks, paid for them, and then our table was ready. The other half of our group had ordered a pizza at the bar, not knowing when our table would be ready and asked if they could take it to our table in the dining room. They receive attitude from the bartender and ended up just eating it in the bar to reduce any problems this was supposedly causing. They could have paid for it and tipped the bartender, I don't really see what the big deal was. The staff had major attitude and we were just trying to wind down after long hard day working with really sick patients. We weren't sure how we were inconveniencing their work and didn't really understand.  Just bad customer service. Food way okay. My soup was just lukewarm and I had to ask for crackers multiple times."
Laura B.,"Mesa, AZ",56,14,6,3.0,9/20/2016,I am only giving three stars today. The food was very good. The service was very bad. The waitress didn't seem to care that. she had customers.
Brandin B.,"Mesa, AZ",41,15,1,5.0,5/13/2016,Let's be real guys. This place is great. If you haven't had the pizzucci you need to try one today. They're epic. Each bite explodes with melted goodness. The beer on tap is a great selection. The pizza and other food items are amazing. I definitely recommend this place.
Gene Y.,"Mesa, AZ",0,4,5,3.0,3/12/2015,"No one could decide what we wanted to eat so we decided on BJs. It was....ok, we started with the calamari which okay but kind of bland. I think BJs charges by the size of the plate because it really long and the squid was in a small pile at one end. Ever regret ordering an appetizer because it fills you up so much you don't even want to eat the main course? Well it's definitely not a problem with BJs calamari, not much for 11 buckaroos. I had the pulled pork sandwich, it was good.  The highlight of the evening was our server. It took quite awhile to get our food but we didn't complain. The server took it upon himself to talk to his manager and we ended up with a free salted caramel pizzookie  (I don't know how to spell that). It was tasty! Not a bad dinner but not a memorable one either."
Clint D.,"Gilbert, AZ",41,100,16,4.0,5/20/2016,"One word, Pazookies. Their Ghirardelli Pazookies is the best, so much chocolate. They are known for their deep dish pizzas are draft root beer, both of which are excellent. I am never disappointed when I go."
Mike W.,"Mesa, AZ",153,3,,5.0,2/20/2017,"Went in for a late dinner with my gf and I cause we both work in the industry so we tried to hurry in, so we got there at 11 15 and they close at twelve .well anyways I ordered the ribeye and was drinking the blonde beer witch was tasty and easy drinking. But the steak was unbelievable amazing and perfectly grilled to temperature!Melanie was our bartender and made terrific ideas to enhance our experience! Thanks  and we will be doing bjs again for a late date night!"
Nathan W.,"Gilbert, AZ",3,33,29,4.0,6/1/2016,The pizza is to die for and everytime I go I get the pizza without the diced tomatoes. They have really good chicken bacon ranch pizza!! They also have very good sandwiches and steak are really good too!!
