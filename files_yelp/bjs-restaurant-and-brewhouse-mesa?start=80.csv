Jen L.,"Mesa, AZ",58,175,4199,5.0,11/9/2015,"October 2015 I have always enjoyed coming to this establishment since trying it out for the first time at their Chandler Location.  They have an incredible array of alcoholic beverages - including their own line of brews.  Their menu can be jarring and take you a bit to peruse through.  On my recent visits I tried their jambalaya.  The waitress informed me that it was spicy,and when I told her that that was fine with me, she asked if I'd like it hotter - could not turn that down.  The food definitely reminded me of my recent trip to New Orleans.   I paired it with a jalapeno margarita, which was equally tasty.  My son got a large plate of mac and cheese, a side dish, and a drink for very reasonable price.  He happily gobbled it up, an had room for a sundae.  The next time I came to this place was for pick up.  The person was gracious, friendly, and organized.  My food was prepared the same way I had it in their restaurant which shows me that they have excellent consistency.  We will be coming back."
April G.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,12,,4.0,7/4/2016,"Awesome food and the atmosphere is great. Relaxing, friendly place for all ages to enjoy high quality food at a reasonable price. We go here on a regular basis and the rewards card has got us more than one free meal. The pub decor reminds me of home in England so it's a fantastic place to unwind, catch up, celebrate and laugh."
Greg H.,"Mesa, AZ",0,172,3,3.0,3/30/2015,"First off, the service was excellent.   The server kept my beer glass full and recommended some good choices. I had the house steak, horseradish mashed potatoes, and asparagus.  Also a order of Crispy Calamari. The steak was cooked correctly and was very tasty.  The mashed potatoes were very good. The Calamari was kind of tasteless and stringy.  I won't order these again. The asparagus was barely edible.  Dried out and tough to eat.   So, some good things and some not so good."
Julia A.,"Great Falls, MT",3153,65,1315,4.0,2/10/2014,"This place is one of my guilty pleasures!  In my opinion, they have the best deep dish style pizza around.  Even though the menu offers a broad range of dining options (from Mexican to Asian fare -- good for picky eaters or big groups with diverse tastes), I'm always drawn back to the pizza.  I also like the minestrone soup (a tad on the salty side though) and their wedge salad is really good -- also pretty decadent, drenched in blue cheese and dressing.  They make their own root beer which is amazing!   For dessert, you HAVE to go with the Pizookie!  They expanded their flavor list so there are even more tempting choices.  If you're dining alone or feeling bad about all the fatty pizza you scarfed down, they have a smaller/personal size Pizookie AND if you can't decide on one flavor, you can do halfsies.  Pretty great! Definitely recommend...if you're not on a diet  ;)"
Shawna S.,"Glendale, AZ",50,4,1,4.0,5/21/2016,Food was good and service was great!! Very nice place and on top of things. Definitely tops all the BJ's that I've ever been too.
Jessica K.,"San Tan Valley, AZ",101,404,50,5.0,3/3/2015,"I love BJs! They have so many options in their menu, but the deep dish pizza is the best. My absolute favorite pizza! They do put tomatoes on every pizza, so if you don't like them make sure you request it without. Great service at this location. It was a busy Friday night, but our waitress didn't make us feel rushed at all and was very kind. Tried the corn fritters for an app which were very tasty too!"
Michael K.,"Mesa, AZ",1,45,2,2.0,8/20/2016,"So..I go to BJ's with my wife and two granddaughters for an early dinner at 4pm on a Saturday.   We were promptly seated and our server was Shane.  Shane was at first attentive and provided us drinks and took our order.  Then the group from hell arrived and took all of Shane's attention.  It was a large group and they wanted the tables set up a certain way so Shane was moving tables around for 15 minutes.  I had to wonder where was my food?  Was it waiting for Shane who had no time to check on our order as he was being ordered about like a servant from the group from hell.  Finally the food came.  The food was good and we enjoyed the taste.  But then our empty dishes sat until Shane had more time for us.  Our plates cleared we now wanted desert.  We waited for Shane. We finally ordered our desert which was good and we're finally ready to depart.  The check came with our desert so we didn't have to wait long.  Our credit card was charged promptly and returned to us quickly.  We were ready to leave this restaurant which was now so loud from the group from hell that acted like they owned the restaurant that we could barely hear each other.  Awwww peace and quiet (and hot) outside.  It is now 5:30 pm.  An hour and a half to get two sandwiches, soup, and Childs macaroni and cheese along with desert....FYI we tipped Shane $8.00 which normally would have been $10.00 on a $50 tab.   Because we were not sure if Shane requested that he be allowed to work the large group and smaller tables or if the host just seated us where he had to attend to both of us.  Anyway we had not been to BJ's in a while and based on this experience doubt we'll be returning anytime soon."
Brandon B.,"Gold Canyon, AZ",266,7,,5.0,5/12/2016,Bj's is great! Always have great food and great service! Always love going with a group of friends cause they are always really accomodating!
DeAnne F.,"Chandler, AZ",15,65,20,3.0,4/23/2016,"Met friends last night. Seasonal peach beer was good. The california flatbread was excellent. Only complaint, watched bartender open the plastic lid to the juice with her teeth and she touched my friend's ice with her finger."
Meghan H.,"Mesa, AZ",0,12,9,4.0,6/7/2016,"Great restaurant! We ordered the deep dish pizza, it's not your traditional deep dish it's more like a pan pizza but a solid pizza! We got the buffalo chicken and the flavors are great! Then of course you have to end the night with a pazookie!"
Danica K.,"Roseville, CA",124,47,26,4.0,4/30/2016,"You can't go wrong with a BJ's favorite pizza the crust is delicious...they also have their own root beer and don't forget a ""pazookie"""
Chris J.,"Bedford, TX",23,188,206,3.0,5/14/2015,"Good if you're looking for someplace local and safe. The entrees are a step above TGIF, Apple Bee's or Chili's.  They do offer a nice selection of brews. The menu offers a large selection for the person who eats vegan, vegetarian or diabetic diets. The grilled brussel sprouts were very good. If you're not a person who enjoys brussel sprouts I suggest you try another item. I happen to love them.  I also enjoyed the tomato, basil and mozzarella salad.  It comes with a balsamic glaze dressing that is very tasty."
JeanAnn M.,"Glendale, AZ",30,5,1,1.0,12/19/2015,Went in and told 1.5 hrs wait after hearing then tell people 45 min. ! Ridiculous! Take reservations then!
Jenn W.,"Gilbert, AZ",74,32,3,4.0,3/21/2016,"The food is almost always great, and our lunch today was really good. My husband had the bacon avocado grilled cheese and enjoyed it. I had the Caesar with sirloin and it was yummy! We sat at the bar and the service was slow, but she was busy. Get the member card so you can get rewards and free desserts!"
Az V.,"Mesa, AZ",0,29,,4.0,11/13/2016,Wide food and drink selection.  friendly staff.  Relaxing place to unwind with a nice happy hour and rewards program.
Betty W.,"Mesa, AZ",0,36,1,4.0,4/10/2016,"I'm a picky eater, my husband says a waitresses nightmare. I'm always satisfied with this BJ's but it's kinda noisy, especially with a group. I'll be back."
Bambi M.,"Mesa, AZ",40,6,1,1.0,11/25/2015,Where do I begin??? Reserved a TABLE for 5. They took us to booth. When I explained I asked for TABLE in reservations we were given a TABLE for 4. Waited forever for drinks. Cannot get refills on cranberry juice. 45 minutes and still no food. They have horrible customer service. Do not waste your money go to the Hub where you get excellent service and food. Do not waste time or money at this place
Kelli S.,"Chandler, AZ",0,21,4,2.0,4/2/2017,"My two small kids and I met my husband for lunch here on a Tuesday afternoon at 12:30 p.m. My husband was on his lunch hour. Our experience was disappointing from the moment we stepped in the door. I asked for a table for four with two high chairs. I asked to please make sure it's a four top and not a smaller table because the kids will be eating also. She pointed a table for four people and said, ""Sooo... that won't work, right?"" It took well over 25 minutes to order and get our food. This isn't lunch hour-friendly at all. The server who brought our food tried to give me every dish, rather than giving each plate to the correct person. He didn't even ask, he just kept putting plates in front of me. We ended up having about 10 minutes to eat before my husband had to leave. Our server seemed confused the entire time and we had to ask for refills on our drinks. I then had to flag down another server to ask for a box for my daughter's leftovers. We will not be returning."
Shelly R.,"Mesa, AZ",0,20,,2.0,10/12/2016,Nice atmosphere.  Food quality and service didn't match up to the price. Next time I would skip the meal and go back for dessert only.
Brad H.,"Mesa, AZ",23,63,108,4.0,12/18/2014,I think the calamari is some of the best I've had and the fish and chips is pretty good too.
