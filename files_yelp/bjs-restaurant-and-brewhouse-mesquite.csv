Robert P.,"Dallas, TX",69,147,145,5.0,9/29/2017,"Dominique was excellent, as is all the staff we have encountered here. I have yet, with my nitpicky ways, found a way or reason, to complain about this restaurant! That speaks volumes if you read my reviews! This place can satisfy the most temperamental me!"
Tokyo C.,"Garland, TX",30,189,467,3.0,9/17/2017,Clam chowder in sourdough bowl was amazing as well as the Brussel sprouts appetizer. This would have been 5 stars but our server was polite but not very timely and never brought my lemon for water after I requested it. He seems New perhaps. My compliments to the chef! Yum!! 9/16 Ate dinner at 10:30pm 1 star for no hostess and really slow service entire night 4 stars - server was attentive  1 star- steak was so salty and had to send it back because it was covered in seasoning and overcooked just ate vegetables because it took way too long to get that steak 4 stars - clam chowder. Asparagus and honey Brussel sprouts 5 stars- you have diet Dr Pepper! Yes!!!!!!!
Oscar C.,"Dallas, TX",41,3,2,2.0,9/15/2017,"Overall a very mediocre dining experience. Our server was friendly and started well with her intro and drink order. Unfortunately, things only went downhill from there. 1) My Oktoberfest beer never made it to the table. 2) We received our appetizers from server assistants and were not given app plates nor did we receive a timely check back (which came after we finished our apps).  3) One in our party received her entree with the appetizers (a soup and salad). The soup was cold by the time the rest of our entrees arrived about 8 or so minutes later. Also, the server assistant needed my help because she was holding five plates with no tray. 4) Remaining entrees were brought out by assistant servers who attempted to hand a very hot plate to a child at our table. The server ended up reaching across the table to only place the hot plate in the middle of the table and simply nudged it in the direction of my niece. No check on quality of entrees and no offer of condiments. After another 5 to 10 minutes I got up and grabbed condiments from an unbussed table. Our server did not check back for about 10 minutes. All this on a relatively slow Friday night. Our section only had a handful of 3 to 4 tops, making the whole experience more annoying. 5) A manager walked by twice looking stressed without checking in on tables or greeting guests. 6) Kitchen did a good job. 8/10 with a few details missing but solid food overall."
Alisha S.,"Rowlett, TX",142,92,125,3.0,8/20/2017,"Came here for lunch on a Saturday and it was pretty busy. We had made reservations prior to our arrival because of the surprise party that we were having. I couldn't decide what to get so I stuck to the basics, chicken tenders with fries. It was good but nothing too special. I couldn't leave BJ's without getting a pizookie so me and my friend decided to spilt the pizookie trio. We got white chocolate macadamia nut, cookies n cream, and chocolate chunk. The favorite among us two was definitely the cookies n cream. I personally was not a big fan of the chocolate chunk. It wasn't that great and my friend agreed.  Service was okaaay. We were a group of 10-15 so I understand the stress, however they were kind of rude. And they ended up charging extra on several receipts."
Mikhael W.,"Dallas, TX",24,120,150,3.0,2/27/2017,"Won a gift card during a church couples seminar, so this was a good way to grab the baby monkeys and get out of the house. I usually don't like eating in Mesquite, the food is almost never tasty but we didn't feel like driving to Africa for a good pie. We ordered the medium bjs special with this appetizer that literally came with EVERYTHING.  half of the appetizer was cold. And the other half was so piping hot that I burned my tongue. I'm assuming the boneless wings were patiently waiting for the spinach artichoke dip to get ready.  The pizza was exceptional. Countless toppings. My husband longed for more marinara but it was just right for me. Used a $25 gift card, we still walked out of there fat, full, and $40 short. FOOD IS WAAAAAYYYYYYY overpriced! Service is a bit slow, but our waiter was ACCOMODATING throughout the evening. I might go back if I break up with my pizza hut down the street."
Paula L.,"Phoenix, AZ",60,333,1,4.0,3/19/2017,"I'm giving 4 stars simply because of the gluten free menu. I'm visiting family and so far this is the only place in the area that has a website that even mentions the G word. Ordered grilled salmon with sautéed veggies & cheddar mashed potatoes. Everything was good. Our server was forgetful and asked us twice what did HE forget. Like I said, gf menu made my experience more enjoyable. Thank you!"
Charlie M.,"Skiatook, OK",0,10,36,5.0,8/31/2017,I am happy to enjoy a great October fest beer from the brewmasters at one of my favorite brew house's. Pizza and beer what could go wrong.
Osama L.,"Dallas, TX",25,6,,1.0,10/4/2017,Honestly this place isn't as good as other BJ's I've been to. The drinks are watered down and the service is very poor! When we entered we were not greeted by anyone for 10 minutes. The server assumed I wanted cheap liquor instead of top shelf and brought me these watered down drinks.... Honestly it was the worst service I've had period. I do not recommend anyone going here....
Kent M.,"Kearney, NE",56,1933,259,4.0,7/17/2017,Just sat here for lunch break. Having Angry Orchard cider and is really good. Have requested a Jambolaya from menu. Nice service sitting in bat area. Sports bar setting here and all is good. My food was pretty and real good. My first Angry Orchard and I did like it.
Clare M.,"Dallas, TX",76,31,356,5.0,9/22/2017,"Went in on a Saturday evening. The mall was packed so I wasn't sure what kinds of service to expect. Marshall was out bartender (we sat at the bar) and he was fantastic! He was friendly and happy to be there. I love when people love their jobs! Our drinks were delicious. I ordered the prime rib. It came out quick and cooked to perfection. I used to wait tables at a steak house 20 years ago, so I can appreciate this. I will definitely be back and be looking for Marshall."
Chan'tel G.,"Spring, TX",442,470,1366,3.0,2/3/2016,"Came here with my mom and sister on a Saturday night. My sister had BJ's once before and was craving wings. I've had BJ wings before, and knew they wouldn't disappoint.  Upon entering, our hostess was rude. They weren't busy, but she carried on her conversation with her co-worker until she finally grabbed menus. Still no acknowledgment, but I guess the grabbing of the menus was our cue that she was now attending to us. I kindly asked her if we could have a booth and she said yes and so we seated ourselves in the booth closest to the entrance (not a problem, it was close). After sitting there a bit we noticed it was under the vent and was a bit chilly. Double whammy of chill being near the door. I kindly asked if we could move to a different booth. She said yes again and we again seated  ourselves, this time taking our plates and utensils with us to the booth across the restaurant. No help. This girl, just did not show up to work today! I gave 3-stars because after we bypassed the hostess, everything was smooth sailing from there. Sad, but true. We had an awesome server (I think his name was Louie?), and the hot wings and Santa Fe chicken salad we ordered was sooo good!  There's a lot more wings on my way to BJ's, but I'd eat here again. I hope they hire a new hostess though."
Patricia G.,"Dallas, TX",0,5,4,4.0,7/4/2017,"I feel bad saying this but the service was pretty slow. It wasn't even packed at all and our food took 40 mins to come out. I wasn't hangry when I got there but I sure did get hangry waiting so long lol. At least we know it wasn't just sitting there to be microwaved when we ordered. I got the Peruvian quinoa plate (something like that) with chicken. It was pretty tasty but towards the end, as I made my way to bottom of the plate, it was a bit too lemony; however my chicken was cooked to perfection! My bf got some salmon dish and he liked the glaze on the salmon but the couscous had a weird texture. That's not the restaurant's fault though we've both never had couscous before- it's probably supposed to be gooey. My true review would be a 3.7 probably and that's just because the service was ridiculously slow overall, not just with the food."
Kesha C.,"Plano, TX",0,7,3,2.0,10/5/2017,Where do i start!?!? From the 10 min for someone to ask have we been helped !! Too the horrible drinks. Only thing good was the spinach stuff mushroom!!! Felt bad for the waitress so we tipped and left after sending 2 rounds of watered down drinks back !! Won't be back any time soon
Chip C.,"Mesquite, TX",389,323,7,3.0,11/29/2016,"Went here for a goodbye lunch for a coworker recently.  Had a flatbread pizza with chicken.  It was really quite good.  Also it was half price, so only cost about  4.50-score! Sampled the sweet pig deep dish and it too was tasty.  The homemade sodas were refreshing as well.  I didn't get to have any beer this visit, but have sampled them previously and there is nothing wrong with them.  Is it the best place around? No.  Is it a place I would like to take the wife to enjoy a date night-especially on the half price pizza nights? Most certainly!"
Taylor B.,"Dallas, TX",1,27,,2.0,7/11/2017,"Okay so I've been to BJ's multiple times for various birthday dinners and the like and my opinion has never wavered. Great beer selections, for sure, but the food is mediocre at best. It all tastes frozen and they are always out of at least 3 dishes every time I come. That's what happens when you have a menu that's too big. That's another thing I don't understand. Their menu is extremely sporadic and has no real concept or direction. If you took away the cheesecake from The Cheesecake Factory and the beer from BJ's it would be the same restaurant."
Moon M.,"Mesquite, TX",13,7,2,3.0,10/14/2016,We have always loved BJ's... but sadly the past couple of times we have visited were a disaster! One time we got seated and nobody came to greet us... for half an hour! We left. Another time the food was not to the quality standards they usually have. Very sad!
Angela B.,"Dallas, TX",3,3,2,1.0,4/26/2017,"Horrible service! Food was cold. Waitress didn't seem to want to help us. Ordered dessert since we had been there forever. It never came. I had to chase the waitress down three times she was annoyed that I came to find her. Asked another employee to get the manager. The ""manager"" came out apologized said they were short on cooks. He offered us a gift card for our troubles. The gift card he gave us wasn't activated. Nice trick! We never got our dessert! Won't ever go to a BJ's again! : ("
Anthony N.,"Richardson, TX",0,3,,1.0,5/20/2017,This is the worse place to eat in Dallas. I love the food but I will go to another location. STAY AWAY!
Mike K.,"West Memphis, Memphis, TN",1,8,,1.0,4/2/2017,"Let me start off by saying that I normally enjoy my experience at BJ's, however, this particular establishment in my opinion doesn't live up to the brand.  As I was dining at this location this evening the glass that my beer came in had separated spilling beer all over the table, my wife, her uncle, and myself. Although once notified of the spill the staff was quick to try to clean up the mess, but no apology was given. To add insult to injury once the bill came I discovered that I was charged for that beer that had spilled all over me. Again I'm a fan of the brand just not this location."
Cynthia B.,"San Diego, CA",16,5,3,5.0,9/10/2016,"Food was amazing! Our group got the combo appetizer, 2 different deep dish pizzas, and the siracha chicken mac and cheese. Everything was cooked perfect and was ready quickly. Additionally, we had Michael and Greg both helping out to serve us. Both were very friendly and Michael went above and beyond to find out what we were drinking, what we enjoyed, and brought us a sample of something new to try! He nailed all 3 recommendations and we all ended up ordering a full size! Thanks so much for the exceptional service, we will absolutely be back!"
Jackie S.,"Garland, TX",0,3,,2.0,3/26/2017,"I love the food,  absolutely hate the service.  .  Every time we come here, it takes no less than 2 hours to eat.  . Do NOT come here for your luch break!!! .  Today,  our server moved  soooooooo slooooooooow.  . We had to asked twice for a refill,  and it STILL took over 15 minutes.  I watched another server practically run laps around our section, meanwhile,  we hardly saw our server & she messed up hubby's order (bacon on a veggie patty burger, really?).   . I got the endless soup & salad,  but she didnt ask me if i wanted another round,  i had to ask,  and i STILL got my second salad before the hubby got his food ( wrong)  the first time. And when he did get it right,  we're pretty sure they just microwaved the fries that came on the first plate,  not made a new batch like they should have.  . Felt like our server really couldn't care less about our dining experience, or the reputation of the establishment she works for.   . Just really really really really really bad service.  Took way too long, didnt get refills,  didnt get our order right, didnt seem to care,  didnt get a good tip.  . Too bad,  the food is usually really good,  but this was the the final visit for us.   . Highly recommend a staff purge and better training for new employees.  . The reviews are pretty constant;  your staff sucks."
Eric F.,"Mesquite, TX",16,74,10,5.0,9/26/2015,"Had BJ's for lunch and I must say this is the 3rd time at this restaurant and it has progressed each time.  One bad thing for me but not so bad for most was the AC has some issues. It wasn't a big deal for most of the ladies, I was told my one of the staff members the ladies seem to be relaxed and not freezing. The lady moved me to a spot where the air was working fine and assured me the air would be fixed ASAP. I was good because it was too hot.  Foods the pizza and the seafood jambalaya was to die for. The small salad was amazing. The staff was great as well, the lady that waited our table was very nice and took care of all her customers.   Should be rated higher than 3, maybe the price is an issue."
Heather S.,"Plano, TX",30,113,48,1.0,3/27/2016,"If I could give negative stars for service and attitude for this entire BJ's establishment I would. From the host/ess stand, food runners, and servers. Wow. Since the opening of BJ's the service has diminished so badly  I will never spend my money here again, regardless of the food. Don't even waste your time.  We arrived about 1:00pm on a Saturday afternoon. We came in through the outside entrance not the interior mall entrance. The music was so loud that you couldn't hear a word the hostess said. I 'assumed' she asked us how many we had for our table. We watched her look at something and gather menus. Then we saw her say something to us and we blindly followed her to a table. We sat down. After about 5 minutes, a waiter arrives and gets our drink order. He seemed nice enough but that took a little bit. We ordered alcohol so luckily he brought our waters first because the bar drinks took awhile too. We order guacamole and chips as an appetizer size it was well after lunch and we hadn't eaten all day.  A food runner happened to bring out our appetizer. I asked her ""doesn't this come with salsa""? She rudely said ""I don't think so but I don't read the menu.""  I read her the menu since we had not yet ordered our food yet.  She walked away from me and said ""I don't know the menu. I'll tell your waiter."" A few minutes later out comes a salsa.  My fiancée ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich which was good. I ordered a combo with a garden salad and stuffed baked potato with garden vegetable with no cheese. When mine arrived the potato has a white sauce on it. When I asked the waiter he said it was Alfredo. I said I asked for no cheese. He said I know but that's Alfredo. I said I know Alfredo is half cheese and cream and I cannot eat dairy. He took it away. Another was brought and it looked like they had picked off the cheese on another. I didn't care I was over it at this point. SO DONE! The guacamole was tasteless and bland. The fire-roasted salsa was good at least. Not spicy but decent. If you want bad service, loud music, people who don't listen to anything you want, and just okay food.  Go here! It's just like place in Waiting.....Shenanigainz! Not only do they make you feel like the customers in the movie, you are the customer, and they are the servers."
alfred g.,"Garland, TX",14,22,26,3.0,5/30/2015,"Okay, dropped by for a quick bite and was craving carbs and protein so went with the Top Choice Sirloin (8oz lean meat), baked potato and asparagus. Sirloin wasn't that bad at all, very lean actually.  However, the baked potato was pretty dry and the asparagus had a little too much salt for my taste. Buuutttt, the bartender was very acknowledgeable about the mass selection of beer there... lager, ale, IPA, stout, etc.  I'm not too much of a beer drinker but his selection was great!  It actually made the dinner better... thanks Patrick. Finally, I couldn't leave without some dessert.  Went with the Pizookie and selected Macadamia Nut and GLUTEN-FREE Chocolate Chip. But it wasn't for me, it was for my... uhh... nephew!  Yeah, that's right... my nephew. I might come back again just to try out another flavor and get on the bandwagon with all these damn beers!"
Xandra B.,"Rockwall, TX",0,21,,5.0,5/17/2016,"For me, this place has some of the best pizza, even more so than New York or Chicago.  Management is top-notch and will do whatever it takes to ensure that the customer is happy.  It's great food, atmosphere and customer service that always brings my friends and I back for more."
Elina M.,"Plano, TX",9,14,1,5.0,4/29/2016,I usually come here for lunch and I love this place. There's usually very good service that is fast and the servers are kind and attentive. The food is always piping hot and delicious. They have good gluten free options at this place too.
David C.,"Mesquite, TX",24,34,13,3.0,4/23/2017,"We went in for HAPPY HOUR and to eat on Friday Date night. Had downloaded a $10 off coupon off their website ( recommend you do the same ). Great beers and Cakes loved the Margaritas. Waiter was attentive and friendly. We ordered the Personal Size Pizza for the Happy Hour half price special. Atmosphere was great, spacious dining and bar, looked like we had found our new Happy Hour hang out. Wrong, SO why do I only give it three stars. Well when we finally got our food, I had the Parmesan Chicken, they were tough and the vegetables were cool or like they had been sitting around waiting on the rest to come out. A minute later they bring us our appetizer Pizza after the main courses. That was not cool. So Cakes ordered the Chicken Alfredo and she loved it. Tried it and it was hot and delicious. We get our bill and think Hmm that seems high but pay it and leave. Tipped the waiter a little extra even though the appetizer foul up, not his fault. Get home and check out the bill, they charged us full price on the appetizer and did not take off the $10 coupon, Come on - what kind of deal breaker is that? I guess it was on us for not checking and trusting that it would be all right but sure left a sour taste so to speak."
Laura T.,"Sachse, TX",2,68,67,4.0,6/19/2016,"I have 3 ratings for this place.  We went at 11:40am on Fathers Day. Crowd was just steady, but with plenty of empty tables.  1. Hostesses. 1 star. Uninterested. Standing in a group at the door and ignoring people for the most part.  2. Waiter. 2 stars. Cute teen boy doing his best. Not a great waiter, but sweet. He gets a pass as not just anyone can be a good waiter. We were happy that they were not busy. It would have been very annoying if it were any slower. It was on the edge of just too slow. Luckily we were visiting with family and we were not in a rush.  3. Food. 4 stars. Really good. The burger was fantastic and the fries were the best we have had in ages. My dad got a pizza and loved it. My daughter and I got salads and they were good and prepared correctly to our order. Mom got a club type sandwich and loved it.  We will go back to BJ's for sure... Not sure about this location. Town east is really much nicer than it has been in a while. We completely stopped going for 20+ years and were surprised that it was pretty nice."
Hannah C.,"Mesquite, TX",42,28,27,1.0,8/13/2016,Awful service awful food. Will never go back to this BJ'S EVER. After talking with the manager he did take care of us and was very attentive to our concerns that is the only positive thing we expierenced.
Jason L.,"Mesquite, TX",12,51,28,5.0,10/6/2016,Pizza is there. I eat it. It's dark and spooky.they have Drinky drinks I dink them.  Words.more words. Need one more word.
Lumi N.,"Forney, TX",0,3,,1.0,8/24/2015,"Terrible terrible terrible service. Every single time we come in here, which is hardly ever now, No one smiles, or greets us for that matter, when we walk through the door. The staff always acts like they have something better to do when we are actually being helped and most of the time our waiter can never be found.  Today, our drinks were never refilled and our waitress did nothing but ask us once if everything was ok. we were done with our food just waiting on her to show up so we could get our ticket and leave.  We like the food but this location sucks."
Ancy K.,"Garland, TX",145,32,132,5.0,12/6/2015,Always consistent! As a lonely Texans fan in a sea of Cowboys on Dallas I can count on BJs to have the game on!! Plus quality food n Bar! I don't have to  succumb to just chicken wing joints!
Rudolph P.,"Dallas, TX",405,15,120,5.0,6/21/2015,"Oh WOW! Excellent excellent food, and the wait staff is incredible! The atmosphere is way cool y'all! Love this place!"
Chanell W.,"Dallas, TX",4,35,93,2.0,4/13/2016,"I Have to give this LOCATION a low rating. Don't get me wrong, food was great so if you are going to pick up an order more power to you! Personally, I will never be returning to this particular location due to the Poor customer service. Our waiter was okay but the manager and other staff members were not so good. I told one of the food runners that my ""clean"" plate had something on it and she acted insulted that I asked for a new plate! She brought a fresh plate out and shoved it in my face asking if it was okay! Very rude. Also, I must add that the calamari came out visibly burnt....like burnt to a crisp. I asked for the manager so that he could straighten it out, but he never came (even though he was doing nothing standing looking over the dining area). Overall, the staff at this location is young and careless."
Paul F.,"Garland, TX",15,57,1,1.0,3/15/2016,"Food is not that great, it's overpriced, and for being a ""brew house"" their beer selection is not that great. We've been there when it's almost empty and service still sucks. I don't think I've ever ordered anything good from there. It's a definite 1 star."
David B.,"Lynchburg, VA",399,6,14,3.0,11/23/2015,"What a great place to stop at for lunch. We were able to stop by on our way to the DFW airport for lunch. We were very pleased with the service, the drinks, and the food. The drinks and food came out very quickly. We did have to wait on one of our burgers because it was overcooked. Other than waiting on the burger for a little bit, our experience was great. (Not pictured was the chicken tortilla soup which was out of this world)"
Stephani P.,"Mesquite, TX",0,14,,1.0,12/13/2016,"The worst service ever  we will  not be back When we got there no one at all at host stand  After standing for a while the bar tender across the the whole place went and got I guess a hostess, she walked in to the high hostess stand thing never even said hello After staring at something in the stand anther person came and they talked for a bit no one talking to us finally 2 more come up and one takes us to a table that is sticky all over ... no surprise the menus were too had to pry the pages apart ...after 10 min one of the group still at hostess stand comes over  And takes our drink order ..... the place is nearly empty but employees who are visiting or texting on their phones  After a bit he finally brings our water yes water too almost 15 min then we order  My burger was really good but brought out by a kitchen person not our waiter he was one of 2 of about 20 staff that was working and acting happy to serve us we had to ask him as he brought the only other table an order for him to get the waiter So we could pay to leave. You have to give a star for this to post so this is for the burger."
Anna H.,"Irving, TX",12,58,9,1.0,3/1/2015,"I had a horrible experience at this location. They were unable to handle a large group of people and were constantly making mistakes with our foods and drinks. The service was super slow and one of the male servers there made an inappropriate indirect comment to us as he was walking past us with our incorrect drink order that we took a sip of.  He said ,"" then why the fuck did you drink it.""  Never again coming back here. If it only wasn't for  the manager there that night who apologized and tried to make us satisfied, then we would've just walked out. Also, BJ's being a higher end establishment, we expected our service to be at a higher level and servers to be trained well. This is by the worst BJ i've ever went too!"
Daphyne B.,"Oak Cliff, Dallas, TX",101,7,,5.0,11/3/2016,bj's is awesome love the place love the variety of foods the staff is good and the pizza is the best I have ever had...
Donny W.,"Whitinsville, MA",1,24,1,3.0,7/7/2016,"Average family dining. Went with a party of 6 so pretty broad spread across the table. Pasta with meatballs was bland, as was the baked potato in addition to being undercooked. Steak flavor was ok, but cuts in general average. Beer choices were fairly good, but served like it's been sitting out for 40 minutes. Service was good, food average."
