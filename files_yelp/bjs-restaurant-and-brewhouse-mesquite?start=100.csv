Denzil M.,"Mission Viejo, CA",5,3,,1.0,8/8/2014,"I'm from California and this is my second time coming here: first in 2012 and second time 2014.  First time I came here was with my family, and we were literally the only ones here. You can imagine my disappointment when it took 40 minutes for our party platter pizookie to come out (it normally took 15 minutes at other locations). Again I'm here 2 years later, and there service remains terrible. The waiter gave me a flat root beer (it was obvious from looking at the beverage that it was that). Problem 2: it took 30 minutes to put together a simple feta watermelon salad where it shouldn't take longer than 15 minutes in reality. My last issue was that the waiter brought only 4 spoons for 7 of us to use (I knew the economy is going through a rough time, but really??). Conclusion: I wouldn't be as upset if I saw them taking initiative to improve, but they remain unchanging in their quality of  service, and continue to keep customers upset."
Barbara A.,"Mesquite, TX",0,1,,1.0,5/9/2011,"The service was incredibly slow, though place wasn't over crowded.  Some food was good, some waaaay bad!  Salad lettuce more white than green, low cal talapia dinner covered with paprika (as substitute for flavor?), and all of us kept ordering more dressing for salads, dry pizza, etc.  But the worst of all--on Mother's Day!--they ran out of ice cream which made ALL of their desserts impossible to order, even without ice cream.  Computer wouldn't take the orders.  Manager should have been able to override and get us some kind of dessert, or at least come to table with a voucher for a dessert at a later date.  It's good costumer service and is common at most restaurants.  One person at our table was overcharged and it took forever for the (absent) manager to okay redoing the bill.  Do not go here!"
