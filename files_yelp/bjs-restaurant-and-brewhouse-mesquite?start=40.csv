Demetria C.,"Dallas, TX",401,244,1847,3.0,3/21/2013,Ok
CT ..,"Balch Springs, TX",0,21,1,1.0,6/17/2016,"Very slow service. Waiter was very nice but too slow. Food quality was below average. Use to be the spot to finish a date night, now its a buzzkill..... has spaghetti and meatballs....too sweet and meatballs were burnt.."
Chris H.,"Mesquite, TX",12,6,6,3.0,10/24/2015,Food is decent  Decent pricess but the service needs some work inattentive and just can't wait to drop the check  A bit of a turn off
Clayton T.,"Mesquite, TX",0,10,,1.0,5/23/2016,"At first, this place was very good. Everything we ordered was super delicious. Then a change of management happened and now I stay away. This place gave my wife food poisoning from a soup or a salad. The avocado egg rolls are super spicy. The only thing worth eating here is the clam chowder in the bread bowl"
Jordan W.,"Mesquite, TX",32,27,5,3.0,3/21/2016,Still only three stars. We went here for my birthday and the service was a nightmare. The manager ended up serving us the rest of the evening. I love the food. I hope they can get it together.
Amber P.,"Garland, TX",73,31,11,4.0,12/5/2015,"We order from here for work every once in a while, and I have never been disappointed. I usually get the Mediterranean pizza, which is pricey for a small pizza, but worth it. It is thick and delicious(haha...sorry I had to with the name ""BJ's""). Next time I will get a picture and post, but it is literally covered in ""Grilled chicken, basil pesto, roasted garlic, Kalamata olives, sun-dried tomatoes, feta cheese and sliced peperoncinis""(yes I copied it from the website. One slice fills me up because it is so thick(haha...). I have also tried the Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos and they are also amazing! I even tried to copy the recipe at home, and they sadly did not even come close to BJ's."
Meredith H.,"Dallas, TX",25,10,,1.0,9/2/2015,"This place is just sad! I went in there for lunch and there was nobody in the place hardly and you have maybe 5 staff members working! I ordered my food and it took about 30-45 minutes to get it and it was disappointing. Chicken tenders are usually a safe bet anywhere, they tasted like they fried them in old grease! The only thing this place is quick at doing is getting you a to-go box and your check so you can pay and get out! They even had the nerve to suggest how much you should tip! Not going back to this place and wasting my money again!"
Thien N.,"Sunnyvale, TX",2,5,,3.0,5/22/2015,"Expensive Pizzas for a mediocre taste. Not worth it!  If you plan to come for pizzas, I strongly believe that this is not the right place. The price is high yet the taste is not spectacular. However, if you come for desserts-only, than it is not as bad of a choice."
Austin R.,"Garland, TX",136,164,528,5.0,7/25/2013,Very Very clean inside. There food is very good along with this BJ's Root Beer in a frosty mug with endless refills. all the food I have tried here is very good an have yet had a problem at this location.

Cecil B.,"Mesquite, TX",56,7,7,4.0,2/5/2016,"I have been asking my husband to go with me there for years. Then a friend of mine called and said lets go eat. We went there he had the bacon avacado burger, Brussels sprouts, and I had the California flatbread with the Mediterranean chicken pita tacos, the pita tacos were good but not great they lacked flavor, they had drizzeled a yogurt sauce over it and that's where they missed again on the flavor. The flatbread was delicious the hamburger was good the Brussels sprouts were good. But the pita tacos a miss and whatever that vegetable mess they served with it was horrible all and all a nice place to eat"
Janette J.,"Dallas, TX",0,1,,5.0,3/1/2016,"My server name James was very helpful, polite, great in serving my husband and I tonight. I highly recommend this restaurant."
Candice R.,"Mesquite, TX",0,2,,3.0,2/21/2017,"I'm a pretty regular guest at my local bjs and I have never had anything negative to say about my dining experience but my last visit changed that forever . when I walked inside to be seated and the hostess a African American woman with short golden blondish hair mid twenties maybe was talking on her cell phone and using some pretty foul language had me WAIT until she was finished with her call and then decided to greet  me , of course I made a comment about her actions she ignored me , rolled her eyes and sat me and my two children , no silverware and no children's menus I asked her for a booster chair which she never came back with . My server however made up for the poor hospitality shown by the hostess Kayla was sweet and kept a smile at all times , when I finished my meal I went back to the host stand and insisted on speaking with a manager about the great serving service but piss poor hospitality team the hostess left to ""get a manager"" and 8 minutes later never returned ."
Kristie A.,"Dallas, TX",947,761,2843,3.0,7/22/2010,"This place was recommended to me by one of my friends.  I tend to stay away from chains, but he went on and on about how good the pizza was and how close to Chicago style it was.  They also make some of their own beers.  When I found out there was a new location at Town East Mall, I knew my friend that lives in Mesquite would join me for pizza and beer. We rolled up last night and the place is spotless.  You can tell it's brand new.  I love the decor with the dark colored chairs/tables and the wood floors.  The ceilings are high and open with exposed air ducts all painted black.  A very chill and contemporary place.  There were flat screen TV's around, but they were all high enough that if you didn't pay attention to them you'd probably forget they were there.  Bonus for some kickass tunes playing overhead.  Buzzcocks = yes, Dramarama = yes! I started with their microbrew the Harvest Hefeweizen.  It tasted almost identical to a Pyramid, which I didn't mind.  Afterwards I ended up switching to Chimay White cuz it sounded good, and it had been awhile since I've had one.  I was impressed with their import beer list too.  If beer is not your thing they have wine, signature cocktails and a full bar.  They also have homemade root beer. Browsing through the food menu took a while even though I knew I wanted pizza.  There's so much food to choose from.  Sandwiches, pasta dishes, salads, burgers, flatbread pizzas etc.  I finally made it to the deep dish part of the menu and settled on a mini pepperoni with the tomato chunks on top.  About 15 minutes later our pizzas come out.  Now...it wasn't horrible by any means, and if I had to eat it again, I would.  It was pretty bland.  It definitely could use some more spices or sumthin.  My dinning partner concurred with his small sausage and jalapeno deep dish. We were totally stuffed, but decided to order the brownie dessert.  It comes with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream and piled high with whip cream.  It was yummy!  (see photo). Our waiter was the cutest thing ever and didn't mind bringing us beer after beer while we took our time eating and chatting. After running around the mall some we ended up back at BJ's in the bar area for one last beer and the bartender was really friendly.  You know the kind that shakes your hand and asks your name.  Nice guys working here! Bottom-line, would I come here again?  I probably would.  I wouldn't seek it out, but my friend in Mesquite drives to Dallas all the time to dine with me, so I'd be willing to suck it up and head his way again.  I'd try some other things on the menu.  If nothing else it'd be a great place to sit at the bar and grab some beers.  Then go drunk shopping, which is the only shopping I can really stand."
Shirley M.,"Fort Worth, TX",1,7,17,2.0,10/31/2014,Not my favorite for sure but the managers are really nice... My server barely acknowledged us.. I would have rather tipped the managers! They checked on us way more..
Katy F.,"Mesquite, TX",0,19,5,2.0,5/14/2016,always overpriced and understaffed and the service is usually slow but food earned the 2I deemed appropriate
Dale I.,"Dallas, TX",267,83,774,3.0,12/14/2013,"This is a mixed review. I stopped by here one night just before closing and had a fantastic burger, fries and their version of a stout. The service from John at the bar was first class. I would have given them five stars; but..... I returned weeks later with my family and everything was bad, correction: The server was OK. The burgers, which they cook to order, were all wrong. The pizza was unevenly cooked and the solution from the management was weak. I think I'll just go alone from now on, seems like I have better luck that way."
Kaleigh B.,"Royse City, TX",5,71,12,5.0,5/22/2014,"Really good food, great selection of beer. The staff was really great. I also liked the bar tender. Very good menu. The place is really big! doesn't feel like you are at the mall, but it is nice to have it so close to shopping."
Kelly T.,"Mesquite, TX",35,5,5,5.0,10/19/2015,Love love love everything I've had here.  Pizza was on the pricy side but it was so good!  The cream sodas are amazing and the desserts are to die for.
Jessica D.,"Garland, TX",0,10,,2.0,10/18/2015,The food was decent but the service was terrible. We were there almost two hours and our waiter (John S.) failed to refill our drinks when they were empty. At one point I ended up going to the bar to get more water after asking my server for more and never receiving any.
Jessica M.,"Oklahoma City, OK",302,206,548,5.0,11/17/2013,"BJ's will always be a top pick for low key date nights. It is a chain and not as wonderful as some places in Dallas but when hubby and I would like to stay local and gets some drinks this is always a good spot. I feel bad for the owners sometimes because the restaurant is so slow and a server confided that it is the least busy of all the franchises around here but to me its a major PLUS. I love knowing that there won't be line for a table or a busy bar with no seats. I usually don't go crazy with my food. I stick with ordering the same thing at every restaurant but with BJ's I am never afraid to try something new. I have liked the pizza, appetizers, sandwiches, specialty plates and most of all: The House cider.  I recommend this place for parties too! They have a lovely back room that looks like it can hold quite a few people and prices aren't too bad. Hoping to do something for my husband at this location"
