Ruby R.,"Dallas, TX",30,30,43,4.0,6/23/2015,Price is affordable. Love their variety of beer and drinks.  Lunch specials even on weekends is a big plus. Broccoli chicken baked potato is delicious
Bob L.,"Dallas, TX",180,273,28,4.0,12/12/2013,I've only been to this BJ's a few times but each time the service and food has been very good. Had drinks with a friend most recently. The pumpkin ale (a seasonal) was very good and one of only a few I've had that had a good pumpkin spice taste. It was early afternoon on a weekday and the place was very unbusy. If you're at Town East Mall doing some Christmas shopping this is a great place to grab a beer or snack and get in out of the chaos. It has an outside entrance and is located next to Sears.
Eric E.,"Ferris, TX",20,101,36,1.0,1/1/2014,"We've been to a few BJ's Brewhouse locations before and to this particular location a few times. However, we won't be going back to this location again. On our most recent visit, our server took our order (appetizer, meal, and drinks). After nearly 20 minutes, our appetizer of chips and salsa arrived along with our drinks. About 40 minutes later (long after our chips had run-out) the server drops off the check and says we can take care of this at any time. I inform her that we never got our meal and she seems stunned. About 5 minutes later, she shows up with our meals which have obviously been under heat lamps for 45 minutes or more. The veggies were shriveled and the food was completely dried. A few minutes later, the server drops off the check again and says we can take care of it at any time. We ask for a manager and she seems stunned again when we tell her the food is not edible. In the end, everything except the drinks was comped. We left and headed to another restaurant for some food that we actually got to enjoy."
Ken E.,"Keller, TX",0,22,,4.0,6/27/2015,Great variety in the menu and a great floorplan. We all enjoyed our well priced meals and the environment was really nice. Our server seemed annoyed for some of our dinner. Regardless it was a wonderful family environment.
Ariel G.,"Irving, TX",30,52,7,2.0,11/22/2014,"Service was soooo slow! Waitress was nice, but not great at her job. Asked us what we wanted 3 times, then still got my order wrong. Food was good, love the wedge cut fries, it was just so slow! Did I mention there were only 3 customers. :/"
Audria K.,"Forney, TX",25,77,55,3.0,9/22/2013,"Had an early lunch here on a Saturday. Picked the place for location and atmosphere, not so much for the food. Had the turkey club with the crispy thin fries. Sandwich was a decent club. Little too much dijonnaise for me. The sauce would spill out on to my fingers with nearly every bite. I did not like that. Fries were good. Honey mustard was different than I expected, but ok. Ordered a hopdaddy IPA because well, it is a brewhouse after all. Nice smooth IPA bite. Nothing special. Waited what seemed long time for drinks and food to arrive considering it was not busy. But I was in good company and the atmosphere was relaxed so overall a good experience for me."
Gary C.,"Rockwall, TX",0,7,,2.0,2/7/2015,Just stopped by here for lunch.  Parmesan crusted chicken and clam chowder.  Food was ok but service was super slow.
PR B.,"Garland, TX",0,22,,1.0,1/17/2016,"Not sure what was going on, but it took over 30 minutes to get our food, and that was after the interminable wait to get a server to acknowledge we were sitting at the table.   Ridiculously poor service starting with the hostess and going all the way down the line."
Rachel J.,"Dallas, TX",46,14,,4.0,8/7/2012,"Went there for the second time on a date last night.  Hostess wasn't the most engaging, but she sat us quickly and gave the standard upsell on steaks and seasonal beer. The service was GREAT.  Our server was funny, attentive without being pushy, and just really on the ball.  My birthday is Friday, but she saw that it was coming up when she carded us for drinks.  And without prompting, she brought out a small cookie and ice cream with a candle!!  (and two spoons)  :)  So sweet! Moz sticks were good.  Plenty of them and not too greasy.  Great to share. My date got the ribs and it was the biggest thickest rack of ribs either of us had ever seen.  He really enjoyed them and still had plenty to take home. I got the loaded giant baked potato but asked if they could add shredded bbq pork.  They said sure and it came out exactly like I had hoped.  And when they say giant, they MEAN IT.  I had massive leftovers as well Both times I've been I've had a mixed drink and they don't skimp on the booze either.  Just sayin'.   Overall solid experience.  Will definitely be going back."
Chris J.,"Dallas, TX",7,137,207,3.0,5/20/2013,This place has gotten better sense it first opened. The food and service has gotten better very slowly over time. The owner does care thow. She came to our table and sees us everytime we eat here. I would say try it its pretty good.
Geoff J.,"Dallas, TX",74,170,30,5.0,10/25/2012,"Perfect fit for Mesquite. I had never been to a BJ's in all my travels coast to coast so I decided to pop into this location while on a recent trip to visit family.  It's attached to Town East Mall. I wasn't too stoked about that idea, but it appears they built this restaurant onto the mall so there was plenty of space, acceptable amount of tv's for sports, and of course beer. While I didn't try the beer on this trip, the food was above my expectations. Chicken tortilla soup was good!  Also had the turkey club sammich and the wedge fries. Great deal for lunch as 2 of us were out of there for under $20!  Move over BW3, there's a new kid in town, or maybe not so new, I dunno."
Regency R.,"Mesquite, TX",2,18,,5.0,12/14/2014,Finally mesquite gets some better places to eat. This place has a great atmosphere and great pizza I really haven't tried to many different things usually just switch up the pizza. My fav is Cali club flat bread. It's yummy. Me and hubby share with a side of thin cut fries it's perfect for us. Good prices. Staff is hit or mis. We go often.
Chris G.,"Keller, TX",162,167,123,2.0,11/22/2012,The food here is always good.  I had just gotten braces so my teeth were too sore to enjoy most of the awesome dishes I've enjoyed there before.  I ordered a bowl of mashed potatoes.  Tasted great.  Got a small side and it was $4. Really? That's way overpriced.  Oh well.
Samantha K.,"Dallas, TX",79,45,42,4.0,8/17/2014,"1st time taking the family there. It was late night Friday and there was no wait which worried us but as soon as we saw the menu we wanted to try it. Between the chicken Alfredo, parmasean crusted chicken, the quesadillas, even the Caesar salads were awesome! Great choice!"
Jasen H.,"Seagoville, TX",5,10,11,2.0,5/22/2014,"Things wrong with our dinner.  Waited forever.  Entrees came before our salads. Forgot avocados on one plate. Despite asking for no onions on the French dip it had onions.  Baked potato wasn't fully cooked.  Manager brought a replacement potato with no apology.  Otherwise, good food, just ruined by the experience."
Bill K.,"Doylestown, PA",1,31,2,4.0,11/1/2014,Business dinner with two others.  Good beer selection that includes their own brews and others such as Guinness.  Food selection and quality was good for a brewery / sports bar.  If you go for a game the TVs are top notch.
Jon C.,"Mesquite, TX",17,20,3,1.0,4/7/2014,"The food is just like any other BJ's, but the service is horrible. Our server Diana simply should not be working in a field where she has to interact with people. She was very rude! First off when I asked for ketchup she slammed it on the table. Secondly the food we ordered came out wrong. Clearly not what we ordered, but that wouldn't have been her fault except she told us that's what we ordered. Smh I definitely will not patronize this BJ's again."
Nonya M.,"Mesquite, TX",46,34,,4.0,3/16/2012,"Based on my experience last night I would give it a full 5 stars, however, trying to not be biased I will give it four total.  We sat in the bar area close to closing time.  Surprisingly, the waitress was really nice and attentive although we came in an hour until close.  This is rare since normally waiters have issues when you are one of the last ones.  The main eating area was closed or we would have sat there instead.  It all worked out well though as the bar was roomy and felt more private. I ordered my favorite water and lime mixture and my hubbs had the D.P.  I tried it out and instead of the normal flat soda pop we get most other places, it was refreshingly bubbly and the right amount of syrup.  This is always a nice sign of the quality.  We thought of ordering the fried artichoke appetizer but passed.  I have had these before and they are wonderful.   It took awhile for us to decide but after ordering some bad ones in the past we had narrowed it down.  By the way, I am not a fan of the bacon/mac or the tomato soup and I will say the tacos I got in the past were small. We did order two entrees the Skirt Steak Salad and the Parmesan Crusted Chicken.  My husband skipped the balsamic dressing and subbed in cesar.  I had the white cheddar mashed potatoes and green beans.  Excellent choices as we were both overly pleased with the taste.  We tried a bite of each others meal and agreed it was the best we have had at the place.  If you like the Costeletta from Cheescake Factory then you will like the Parm. Chicken here.  The steak was very tender and full of flavor served medium by default I believe. Back to the service, we were exceptionally pleased with the attitude and attentiveness so much that we told the manager.  Overall we had a great experience that night.  In the past it has not always been excellent but this time it deserved a 5 star rating.  Taking everything into consideration I left it with 4 stars for the many times I have been to reflect on the total experiences."
Samantha G.,"Rowlett, TX",44,123,44,5.0,5/20/2014,I've used this location for several events now from 10 to 30 people and I've had a great experience every time. They help us set up tables so that we have a table just for desserts or gifts and the staff is always fantastic. They are also willing to do individual checks on large parties and gave me a reservation for lunch on a Sunday which several other places in the area wouldn't do. This is my go-to place for family get-togethers! Plus the fact that the pizza and beer are great doesn't hurt either.
Jonathan W.,"Austin, TX",131,229,10,2.0,9/7/2011,"Used to have a great happy hour, but no more.  $1 off microbrews is $4/pint.  Meh. Their food is certainly passable, but for the price, really doesn't hit the mark.   I'm really between a ""meh"" and an ""a-ok"" on this one.  I think it's a price-adjusted ""a-ok"", which makes it a ""meh"". The kick-ass happy hour deal made this one a ""yay"", but those days are long gone it seems."
