Michelle M.,"Madison, AL",0,5,,4.0,11/25/2012,"BJ's is a good place to go when your in the mood for classic casual American food and good beer. They have great burgers and salads and a nice appetizer and small plate selection. The California burger is awesome; it is served on sourdough with avocado. BJ's is one of the few chain restaurants that doesn't overcook their burgers. A medium is actually pink! Favorite appetizers include avocado eggrolls, flatbread pizzas and fried artichokes. Their dinner salads are huge and they go really well with a couple small plates if you want to make a family style meal.  This location is attached to the Town East mall. Parking can be an issue when the mall gets busy. The restaurant itself is large, it's usually busy but typically does not have a long wait. It has a upscale sports bar feel, there are TVs throughout playing various games.  The microbrews are very good and are a good price. I usually order the BJ's beer but they have a respectable selection of other beers. The brown reminds me of a Newcastle.  The stout is a little too bitter for my taste but the porter is very nice. It is dark with a hint of coffee. They don't have the largest beer selection but BJ's is a great place to go when you want a nice beer and a good casual meal."
Erica D.,"North Richland Hills, TX",0,40,6,1.0,6/17/2015,"Went to this restaurant for the first time ever with a very large group of 80. Keep that in mind because I am very aware the service is different from small parties. So how many waiters do you think they would have on a Monday about 1:00 for a party of 80? 2! Yes 2 lonely waiters for our event. This was a reserved party so I am not sure why only 2 people. The rest of the place was only half full and nobody waiting to be seated. It took over 30 minutes just to get my starter salad of mozzarella and tomatoes. The entire meal took 1 1/2 hours and we were lucky because we flagged down the waiter to just get service. First off, my salad was half the size as two other people who got the same dish. Really? You didn't charge me half the price so I did not understand that. I ordered a mini pizza. It took 45 minutes to get that. It was ice cold by the time I got it. Not a single refill on my soda. I would like to think the food is good, but I cant say for sure because mine was cold and the salad was 4 bite fulls. Now I find it funny it only took 5 minutes for the waiter to bring me my bill and charge my card. That was the fastest part of the whole trip. I dont live around that area but I will be trying the BJ's by my house. I dont recommend for a larger party. But I am willing to give another location a chance to see if the food is good. Still tipped the waiter. I hope it was just the manager who messed up instead of the waiter so I didnt want to stiff him."
Tisha E.,"Dallas, TX",229,277,38,4.0,9/14/2013,"The Seared Ahi Tuna Salad...F*CKING. AMAZING. If you don't try it you have yourself to blame. The Blackened Salmon is pretty good too. Oh, and always get the Clam Chowder."
Shanna C.,"Dallas, TX",115,221,27,2.0,11/13/2013,"How long does it take to get appetizers? About 30 minutes, your meal...well its anyone's guess?  Arrived on a wednesday night to a very welcoming host. Server was super friendly, but the kitchen staff are not my favorite. I wanted to leave a good review I really did, but I can't."
M W.,"Heath, TX",17,21,1,5.0,12/2/2013,Nice place !  Very clean and modern.  Large menu that has something for everyone.  Food is excellent and waiters are very helpful.  I really liked the flatbread pizza.  It was very crispy and flavorful.  The thin cut crispy fries are awesome !  This is a good family place and large enough to accommodate a large group.  Good place to stop and eat when you are out Christmas Shopping !
Kacie C.,"Dallas, TX",179,51,1,4.0,10/12/2011,"First thing to know...sit at the bar!! We've sat in the seated sections before and the service has been....um...let's just say, we've had better. We have sat at the bar several times and have always had great service! Bartenders are always at top speed and super friendly.  The micro brew beers, Pirahana is my fav. I miss the micro brews that have been in Dallas, like Two Rows, may you rest in peace. BJ's is the closest to us and we've never been let down.  There's 3 things that i rotate in my orders when i go there. The Ahi tuna salad. YUM! If you are looking for a crisp, clean, light  salad, I highly recommend this one. The second, is California Cobb sandwich. A great sammich on a hoagie roll and thick wedge yummytastic fries. LOVE IT! Now onto the 3rd and heaviest. The chicken parmigiana. Best I've had yet (aside from personally cooked ones) Perfectly cooked thin breaded chicken....two slices actually. This plate is HUGE! Topped with mozzarella! and a side of spaghetti and marinara, which, i must say has a bit of a kick. It's great and it's great reheated the next day with your leftovers.  SCORE! to the BJ's, which is the last standing good brew house near us."
Tracy M.,"Forney, TX",137,36,1,4.0,4/24/2011,"Just got here.  So far great, fast service. Because of the location I'm just not seeing this place making here at the mesquite mall! Just my opinion. They serve lunch menu all day, everyday.  Clean table, good lighting, we are here on easter, there is virtually no one here.  We were both itching for a burger and a new place, close by so here it goes !  I ordered the melt, cheese burger on sourdough basically, hold the grilled onions, yuk!  Hubby ordered a California burger and right now I'm just writing this review.  Water taste really pure and drinkable , no draft beer for me but the selections look pretty wide.     Food arrived! The burgers are gigantic! We both had sour dough toast.  My toast was a little soggy but the manager came over, I told her and she offered to replace it. I didn't think it was a deal breaker. The wedge fries my hubby got here good.  I don't like the thousand island dressing on the burger. I would have gotten it on the side it I'd realized it. The char on the burger added a very salty flavor on some bites.  The burger was good and my hubby said he loved his. Great service. We got in and out in an hour for $25.   We will return, we liked it."
Jake C.,"Mesquite, TX",0,14,,3.0,1/8/2014,Me and my girlfriend went to have a quick dinner here and we had the 5 meat thin crust pizza which was decent. Now the sweet tea they brew there was really good! Our server was really cool and friendly. The reason I rate it with a 3 is because of the quality of the food. It was okay pizza. Something that can be made anywhere. But still okay. Otherwise everything else was great. 5 star service though.
Tracy D.,"Forney, TX",46,15,,4.0,3/17/2012,"My husband and I went there last night for dinner and we enjoyed it. I wasn't crazy about the appetizer (we got the sampler and found out it was for four people, not two, so we brought a lot home), but the Iced Tea was really good! My husband ordered the Jambalaya. He said it was different - he's from New Orleans - but liked it enough to order it again. It was VERY spicy though. I did notice some sweating, not that he'd admit it! I got the Parmesan Chicken. It was awesome! The chicken was so tender I didn't need a knife, and it melted in my mouth. I got two huge pieces. The sauce was a bit too lemon-y, but there wasn't a whole lot of it, so it wasn't overpowering. The mashed potatos were very good, but I didn't get much broccoli. It looked more like garnish than a serving size. Service, on the other hand, was just ""meh."" When we walked in, we were greeted by some overly cheerful, Pollyanna types that reminded me of Disneyland. I kept expecting them to say, Have a Magical Day! But they didn't. It was a nice change though, many other places have greeters that don't even smile.  Our server was nice, but not around much. We didn't get refills on our drinks until we were about ready to leave. It took awhile just to place our order, and after ordering our drinks we thought he forgot about us. He kept saying sorry, that he had so many other tables. I wanted to say, So? Not my problem. But instead I said it with a 15% tip (we usually give 20% or more).  So yeah, we'll go back, but it won't be on top ten list. Especially around Christmas... the parking situation at the mall is just awful!"
K. B.,"Monterey, CA",3,116,,3.0,7/26/2013,"Great place to go with friends as long as you have time to wait. Share some food, and order a few drinks, but don't expect to get out of there in under an hour."
Anabel V.,"Dallas, TX",152,225,195,4.0,2/17/2013,"My only complain is the lighting, it is pretty dark in here whish i both like and dislike.  THis is one of those places that you visit when  everyone wants someting different. It amazes me that their menu is like a book, it like 20-30 pages long!!!! So yes everyone founf something our table ranged from burgers and pizza to steak and county cooking.  In the end dinner for 6 was $100 including an appetizer."
Ted M.,"Irving, TX",0,6,3,5.0,10/9/2012,"Great food and service, one of the best BJs I have been to."
Jeremy P.,"Nevada, TX",2,97,44,3.0,3/16/2013,"Food was good. This is more of a happy hour type place, not necessarily the best family place. I felt the prices were a little high for the food choices."
Dee G.,"Mesquite, TX",0,23,2,4.0,6/6/2013,"Food is always good, drinks are good but they seem to run out of a lot of beers. But you can get free tasters!! Wait staff is hit-and-miss. Convenient location and it's never been overly busy."
Alan G.,"Sunnyvale, TX",0,8,,5.0,4/23/2013,"I discovered BJ's a few weeks after I moved into my house, 6 years ago, while shopping at Town East Mall. Now, I eat here at least once a month. I've rarely had the same entree twice and I've never been disappointed. Plus, the prices are very reasonable. The only thing I never go without is the Orange Cream Soda. LOVE IT. Normally, chain restaurants at the mall aren't this good. If you want a hotdog, to the food court, if you want a great sit down dinner, go to BJ's."
Lori O.,"Garland, TX",67,11,,3.0,6/21/2014,"Went in on a Wednesday night. I frequent this location and normally order the Ahi Poke. In the past the Ahi Poke was plentiful enough for all the wonton chips that come with it, but this time it had a spare amount of Ahi and the poke sauce was non-existent. I also ordered the Watermelon and Feta salad as it is only available seasonally. It used to be better tasting. Our waitress was good about re-filling our drinks but her food runner brought out my husband's salad maybe a couple of minutes before the main course was brought out and brought my salad out at the same time as well which was to be part of my main course which I promptly informed him and sent it back until the time was right which was only a couple of minutes later. My son had the gourmet mac and cheese which was good and my husband had the Bison burger. His only complaint was that the burger had at least an inch or two worth of lettuce on it which made it difficult for him to put his mouth around the burger to bite it. The crispy calamari was good as always but had an unfortunate grease after-taste on several pieces. Not sure if these issues were because we went there on a different day than we usually do. It was ok, but for the money spent I guess I expected more."
Slow M.,"Dallas, TX",0,39,,3.0,11/12/2012,"Going to give 3 stars because of the selection of beer.  Seems not too much variety in this area for breweries or craft beer selection.  Food is OK, probably won't come back here next time in Mesquite.  Would rather try some new places first for food before returning here to dine.  But beer is OK and inexpensive."
Amy O.,"Waxahachie, TX",2,43,8,3.0,12/17/2011,"Nice atmosphere. Our waitress was friendly but goofy acting, but was good service. I had the lunch portion chicken parmesana and it was really good. Spicy marinara was different, good and really had spice. I enjoyed it! My husband had tai salmon and said it was good too! DRINKS- I did order their root beer because I'm pregnant and was told it was caffeine free and did not like it! I ended up drinking water. Husband ordered one of their piranha pale ale beer. Said it was good and strong. It was different and good. Dessert- we split the cookie pizookie and it was OK. Our cookie was very hard but all thee goop piled on it made it fine. Probably won't order again but will definitely stop and eat here again if we are ever in the area!!!!"
David G.,"Garland, TX",12,24,9,4.0,6/18/2011,"Great place and pizza. Service is hit and miss. Never to crowded, maybe nobody in mesquite can afford it. Lol. Jk, prices are very reasonable. Must try the oreo pookie!"
Sumbelina Z.,"Elmont, NY",3,18,1,2.0,12/20/2010,"This location has disappointed me twice when it comes to service- it's slow. No one to greet you at the door- we waited for quite a while until we seated ourselves . After trying to get the attention of a server, someone finally noticed us and she took out drink order. We just got soft drinks , and those didn't show up for at least another 10 minutes. I could tell mine had been sitting for a while because you could taste the water from the ice melting. Anyways we ordered and the food came out another 20-25 minutes later- which would of been fine if the restaurant hadn't been almost completely empty and had we ordered something other than dessert."
