Liz G.,"Miami, FL",29,52,79,4.0,1/3/2018,"I ordered the $10 deep dish ziti special for happy hour.  It comes with a salad; you have four different ones to choose from. My salad was good and the pasta was very good!! Also quite filling.  When I asked for the check the server mentioned that I had an old menu and the actual price for my food was $15 (which I totally wouldn't have minded) but she spoke with the manager and they kept it as $10.  I wish I remembered the name of the server, she was so kind and attentive... I'll be coming back."
Bergman P.,"Miami, FL",316,6,30,2.0,1/6/2018,I don't know what happened to BJ's we went there yesterday  1/5/18 used to have great food  the attention was amazing but the food horrible  we were a 8 party table none of my party had a good thing to say about the food other than TASTELESS... quinoa salad don't order  fish taco (used to be good)Horrible Chef doesn't know how to season the rice
Jose P.,"Miami, FL",23,85,118,4.0,1/2/2018,"Love BJ's. Came here on a Monday evening and they have *Half off Large Pizzas*  We ordered 2 of them and slit both in half to have different types. What a great selection / choice to have. We were a party of 7 which the pizza was filling enough for us all. One split pizza was Bacon, chicken, ranch and the other half was spicy Hawaiian. Man was that pizza selection flavorful! Our second choice was a split for the BJ's brewhouse pizza and half Mediterranean.  These four style pizzas were cooked deep dish style. The pizza was good and had flavor but they do lack sauce. This is my only complaint for their deep dish. You have to ask for extra dipping sauce because the pizza doesn't have enough.  My wife did order the shrimp scampi which was cooked to perfection, just enough butter and garlic to make your palate smile.  We've had the avocado egg rolls here before and they are to die for. If ever in the falls area or by dolphin mall   Go to BJ's they have a large menu , something for everyone.  I'm rating this 4 star only because the lack of sauce in their deep dish. I hope they load it a little more for the future."
Krys P.,"Miami, FL",301,935,2833,4.0,12/6/2017,"Once every few months I attend the beer dinner at BJ's.  It's a nice value, for $40 (or $45 if not prepaid) you get a five course dinner with 7 beers (with refills if you can handle more). They also have lower price for designated drivers, and for customers with special diet needs, they basically hand you the full menu for you to pick something you like.  So, I've been here with coworkers for regular meals and beer dinners.  For beer dinners this is a nice location, compare to the others, they have a lively MC so the mood is very festive, if a bit loud.  However, service is chaotic with a large group.  Items like water that you ask for multiple times may not arrive, and one time the steak knives were delivered when the majority of the people had cleared their plates.  Their food is not bad, with some better than others. Meat dishes like pork chop or prime ribs are not bad for the price, and the chili is quite good. Definitely do not order the salad - the leaves are not fresh and the kale way too old to be used in salad."
Christian J.,"Miami, FL",11,37,113,3.0,12/17/2017,"The food at this chain is very mediocre.  Stopped in with my family on Saturday, waited about 15 minutes to be seated. The waitress was okay, not the bubbliest but we got a round of beers and ordered the kids their food. The kids food came and we ordered our food, three burgers which you would think would come out pretty fast, however we waited a while for them. The kids finished their food and we were still waiting. What made our experience not so great is the fact that it was freezing inside. My wife's burger got cold halfway through her meal. Not a good way to enjoy a meal when your freezing your a-- off."
Francesca J.,"Miami, FL",16,57,136,3.0,12/17/2017,"I have been to BJ's several times, and while it's never a magnificent culinary experience, it is a good go-to spot for a quick meal.  Today my family and I decided to grab a quick lunch here.  Once seated, we placed my kids orders since feeding them first is crucial.  After placing their orders we waited a long time before the waitress came back to take our orders.  My kids even got their food and finished it before we were even able to order.  After we did get to order, we noticed it was taking a really long time to get our food.  We all had ordered burgers (there were 3 adults) so weren't sure what was taking so long, and while waiting also noticed how unbelievably cold the restaurant was.  At this point, my daughter had finished eating and was asking if we could take her outside to warm up, luckily I had just purchased a sweater in the mall so I was able to give it to her to warm up.  Once our food arrived, I was pleased with my cheeseburger.  It wasn't the best i'd ever had but it was good.  I cut my burger in half and started to eat, unfortunately by the time I got to the second 1/2 of the burger I was disappointed to discover the other 1/2 was cold!!!! Not sure why they had to keep the restaurant so cold, but it definitely made for an unenjoyable experience.  I left my second half of the burger, because to me theres nothing worse than cold hamburgers, we paid quick and raced out of there so we could defrost.  If I happen to find myself at this location again I will make a point to get a table outdoors!"
Omar A.,"Miami, FL",8,7,7,4.0,1/6/2018,"I recommend if you can order it, the Parmesan Crusted Chicken sandwich... It really is delicious!!!! The problem is, they took it off the menu a while ago, but I am still able to order it. Try it and you won't be disappointed. The restaurant staff is helpful, the restaurant is nice inside and if you like beer...well they're known for their selection in beer. It's a good spot to go to."
Marla V.,"Miami, FL",166,215,467,4.0,2/1/2017,"I was in the Falls area with my better half and youngest child on a Saturday evening.  We were hungry so we decided to head to BJs and give them another try.   While they were busy with guests arriving, we managed to squeeze in perfect time and were seated almost immediately.  We ordered several draft beers.  Perhaps it was the fact that he carded me for my beer (I turned 21 last century), but our server Carlos was awesome!  He was attentive and always made sure we had what we needed.  He even recommended dishes when I couldn't decide on dinner.  We ended up ordering the California Club Chicken sandwich, Hickory Brisket & Bacon Burger, and a kid's spaghetti meal.  Everything we ordered came out perfectly!  The beverages were cold and delicious.   Usually I make room for pizookies at BJs but this time I found myself too full from overindulging in my burger.  The meal itself was flawless and I was happy that I had stopped in for dinner."
Yanina S.,"Miami, FL",40,39,2,1.0,10/31/2017,"ive been coming here for a while now but this will be the last time. was charged for the wrong order (they put my order in 3 times), they charged me the orders without the discounts. i found a piece of metal in my pasta. ive heard bad stories of the bj brewhouse brand. one of them being a frog in the salad (read the article:   ) but today i found a piece of metal in my pasta... not sure what it is but i took a couple of photos to complain. i havent heard anything back from them... waiting to see what excuse they give me."
Andrea Z.,"Tampa, FL",190,89,159,5.0,7/18/2017,"I have always though BJs has real good food. I'm a big fan of their deals too (Monday's pizza is half off and Tuesday's you can get their famous Pizookies. You can check them out on their website). I went with 2 of my friends and we were very pleased with the service. Our server was attentive, kept up with our drinks, and more importantly she tried to give us the best deal with what we were ordering. She was a fantastic waitress! The food came out hot and in a timely manner. For dessert we got the trio pizookie and each was warm with ice cream nicely placed on top! One of my favorite desserts. I can't wait to go again. Check out BJs - there are so many good food options for each person's preference and calorie intake."
Bobby B.,"St. Augustine, FL",44,5,5,4.0,10/5/2017,"Everything was great for me, I had the brisket bacon burger.. God it Was good  but my mother in law shrimp penne pasta was cold and only had 4 shrimp. Yep she counted.. The head chef Arrington was walking bye and we stopped him and we showed him the plate. He was mortified , he took the plate back.He returned with it looking just like the picture and steaming hot. He also gave her a free desert she was happy..Found out he went to Palmetto High and is being promoted to the west palm beach location. Good luck Arrington.. thank you for making my family feel welcome. Barrettempire"
Stan D.,"Miami, FL",0,194,15,3.0,12/18/2017,"I have came here when they first opened up and nothing in the way of their food has changed. Went here because, my family wanted dessert and something lite, without driving up to Dadeland. Service was good and had no issues with our order, but the food is still the same as when it first opened. If it is late and you are hungry, want a variety to choose from and do not want to drive up to the Dadeland area or Dolphin, this place will make do."
Stephanie S.,"Miami, FL",63,236,262,4.0,5/9/2017,"Tried this place for the first time last friday night. My friend and I ordered the avocado egg rolls, I loved them! Even the dipping sauce was delicious! I also ordered a strawberry mojito, which I didnt care for. After reviewing the menu, I was torn between the golden beet and arugula salad, and the cherry chipotle glazed salmon. Our waitress Rebecca was great, and was able to accomodate me and create an entree with the salmon and salad for me. I loved it! For dessert, I had the chocolate chip pizookie with ice cream. Who doesn't love a warm freshly baked cookie! I enjoyed my meal and certainly plan on returning. Especially for those avocado egg rolls!  The restaurant was clean, nicely decorated, and I recommend this place to my fellow yelpies."
Adriana V.,"Pinecrest, FL",4,47,19,3.0,10/4/2017,"Food is good, although I've to say I order an appetizer and came after the meal, I felt bad and told the waitress to leave it... I hadn't been there in a while and I continue not to be impressed I order a salad and it was just ok. The appetizer was better it was a flatbread (suggested by the waitress) overall service was ok, on the slow side  I'm giving it 3 stars because it was just ok!"
Matt A.,"Miami, FL",0,18,,4.0,12/31/2017,"I stopped by yesterday with the full gang. While we were shopping at the falls. We were seated right away.  The menu is very extensive. The waitress was very patient with us. We ordered barbecue wings and calamares. Both were excellent. We ordered bison burgers, jambalaya, ribeye steak and flat bread pizza.. All were excellent and warm. Everyone was happy with there lunch..."
Nathasha A.,"New York, NY",4,25,98,3.0,7/8/2017,"As a person who uses a wheelchair, I wasn't thrilled with the access to the bathroom. I'm pretty sure the toilet paper is far away from where it should be.  It's very noisy even when it's not crowded. I think it's the music. We pretty much have to raise our voice. It's not my first time at this franchise. I've been here several times.  The good part is the free entree special. It's also great to be a member. It's free.  I had the full rack of ribs.  Very good. I took half of it home. Worth the $20 I'm also fond of the outdoor seating for the cooler days.  It's more of a sports bar feel.  I'd recommend it for people who like TGIFridays and Chilis style food."
Yen D.,"Miami, FL",137,16,56,3.0,3/18/2017,"Friday evenings are probably not a good time to go unless you want to wait an hour before getting your food. The wait time in the beginning wasn't that bad, it was about 15-20 minutes. They also gave us a small sample of their pepperoni pizza while we waited, that was a pleasant surprise! More restaurants should do this! Especially if there's lots of hungry people waiting outside. The table we sat at was like the arctic tundra! The couple next to us actually told us three couples already asked to be moved to a different table. We were warriors though and decided to stay. (Hindsight: not sure if that was the best decision, we didn't know it would take another 40-45 minutes to get our food). My advice: bring a jacket just in case they sit you in that area.  The waiter was nice, but they overloaded him with tables, he kept having to apologize. My boyfriend had ordered the coffee and he had forgot, so we informed another worker there and then they forgot. We then reminded him again, but it took another 20 minutes for him to get the coffee. The coffee finally came AFTER the meal even though we had ordered it in the beginning. (It would have been nice to have gotten it early though, my boyfriend almost turned into an icicle).  The food: I ordered the dry rub wings with buffalo sauce on the side, it tasted good. Nice and crunchy on the outside. The boyfried ordered the California chicken club, he said it was okay. The fries it game with was really good though! Had a great crunch to it!  We also got the chocolate chunk piezooki, the combination of chocolate chip cookie and ice cream was perfect! The sides of the cookie had a nice crunch. Nom nom nom. If you love cookies, try this!  If you like the acrtic, food with a nice crunch and slow wait times, then this place is perfect for you! (Side note: the wait time is only on the weekends- including Friday night, I've been during the weekdays, it a lot faster)."
Serena P.,"Weston, FL",150,122,246,3.0,2/15/2017,"Visited for lunch with the girls from work. They sat us right away and took our drink order. Our waitress was very nice and attentive.  The menu is excessively long. Towards the back there is a lunch specials page. Lunch is served from 11-3p. There are so many options to chose from it made it difficult to pick what I wanted. I ended up ordering the boneless buffalo chicken and a side of fries (had a craving for this).  My boneless buffalo chicken was good, but this is a pretty average dish and hard to mess up. Fries were  the skinny kind and little too crispy in my opinion. I love fries so I ate them anyways.  Luckily our waitress informed us that we could download the app and get a free MINI pizookie. I had not idea what a pizookie was, so in case you don't either let me explain. A pizookie is a warm skillet cookie topped with ice cream. Yummy! I downloaded the app and ordered the chocolate chunk pizookie.  It came out nice and warm and topped with vanilla ice cream. Pretty good and free!! This place is expensive for the type of food. I paid $15 for my chicken and fries. Ouch."
Anabel M.,"Hialeah, FL",151,72,116,3.0,3/14/2017,"I would say this place is like a high quality Denny's. They have some decent options - pasta, ribs, chicken, burgers and pizza. I know they are mainly known for their beers and pizza, but since I don't eat pizza, I always try to order something different. They actually have a great deal on thursdays, where you can a full rack of ribs with two sides, a salad and dessert at a very decent price. I've had the seared tuna salad, which is okay. They used to give more tuna but they've cut back. Sometimes I have to order an extra side of tuna because the amount is just not enough. The ribs are good - tender and saucy. I also tried the double bone-in pork chop, which tastes like chicken. It doesn't have much flavor and gets overlooked because it's so thick.  I will say that I've never had trouble with the service. The servers here are very friendly and attentive."
Heather M.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",132,85,18,4.0,7/21/2017,"I was unsure if I wanted to give this location 3 stars or 4 but I'm going with 4 since the district manager was so helpful in resolving my issues last time. I came here with my boyfriend and the District Manager sent us a $25 e-courtesy card since we had such a horrible time last time.  This time we knew we wouldn't make the same mistakes as last time. For example, we didn't sit in the bar area. I didn't order a drink off the menu for fear of it all tasting like sour mix, I got an old fashioned. Our waitress was nice, not GREAT, but decent. She was way more attentive than our last server (when we sat in the bar area). I got the Sirloin Steak medium well. It was OK, I've had better. My old fashioned was a very solid old fashioned, it was good. My boyfriend enjoyed his meal as well but I don't think he was blown away by it. Before I was done eating, our waitress asked if we wanted dessert. Very clever! She said she wanted to ask before we got full, and I'm glad she did. We got the churro pizookie. I'm generally not a fan of pizzookies, but this wasn't really like a pizookie at all...it was basically a pile of mini churros topped with ice cream. This was easily the star of the show. It was warm, crispy, and basically everything you want in a churro. I would definitely get these again. Overall, a solid experience. While the food wasn't anything to rave about, I wasn't disappointed in the whole experience. I had very low expectations given my last review. If this experience is indicative of most experiences at this location, I'll definitely consider giving this location another try."
Lana J.,"Miami, FL",0,3,1,2.0,11/22/2017,"BJs is usually the restaurant that I drag my friends too because I love their Pazooki! But today it was different. The service was absolutely awful dinner took 2 hours. For  one appetizer and 3 entrees... awful. I never go online to 'bash' a restaurant but it was awful. My meal was spoiled by the wait because the server was down. The waitress was never anywhere near our table, just to get the check took 30 minutes alone. This was an awful experience. Honestly if you come for the pazooki like most of us do. Just order out. Service was awful. The woman at the front desk was not only sassy but snippy. Giving my close friend an EYE roll. Very unprofessional. Don't know what happening to BJS but I'm very disappointed with today's meal."
Gaby R.,"Miami, FL",232,140,394,2.0,6/23/2017,"Ive given this place a few tries but have never been impressed. The food is ok and the service has never been great the few times i have come but decided to give it one more try because i was craving pizza and i've heard great things about their deep dish. My date and i bother ordered pizzas and they have a new system now where they take your order on an ipad looking thing but i dont highly recommend that because both our orders got messed up. Seems like the button are way too small and could easily get mistake so our waitress i guess accidentally clicked our pizza to be flatbread instead of deep dish so they brought one of them out wrong and by the time we had to wait for the correct one it was already 45 minutes and we didnt even want it anymore . Not only did they get our order wrong when they brought out the correct deep dish one, it was cold!! i didnt send it back for the fact that i didnt want to wait another 45 minutes for it, but cold deep pizza wasnt the best tasting. However, we did order dessert and got the pizookie trio which was amazing! We got the monkey bread one, the cookies and cream one and the chocolate chip one. They were all amazingly delicious but cookies and cream one was my favorite"
Nalla R.,"Hialeah, FL",76,75,51,4.0,7/15/2017,"They have really good drinks here. Lots of options to choice from with the food. The churro pazooki is amazing. Service is always on point. I have been to the one in Doral, Pines and now the Falls and all are great across the board."
Ericka G.,"Miami, FL",546,355,3120,4.0,11/12/2016,"This is only my third time at this location (first one I've ever been to was Doral location) and it always leaves an imprint on me like why don't I come here more often.  It has a feeling of sports bar/restaurant but your seperated. For example I had a dinner date with my hubby and 17 yr.old sister so I'm not trying to be in the bar area with her so we sat more on the restaurant side and didn't notice the bar side,in a good way though. There are tv's everywhere so some of the time we would watch the Heat  game that was playing or the soccer game. It really has a spacious setting so it's just a great spot for a sports fan or family and friends just wanting a great place to eat. There food options on the menu were great, we had a hard time choosing what we wanted. Everyone was in the mood for something different so we ordered calamari as an appetizer and we loved it. The marinara sauce used I could've  eaten it with a spoon alone (hey I'm a sauce person, don't  judge) but the lemon garlic aioli was out of this world. I can put that aioli on any and everything. My little sister wanted a burger and added guacamole and cheese and chose the wedges fries,burger perfectly seasoned and cooked and the fries were seasoned to perfection as well,no salty over kill. Hubby had the tuna salad and forgot to let me have a bite (damn him)..guess he loved it cause he cleaned the plate. Lol. I wanted something small and to share so I ordered a new menu item which was the rootbeer wings. I loved them, you could really taste the rootbeer and it made the wings a little sweet,everyone loved them. I had to even lick my fingers clean, yeah dinner table etiquette went completely out the window. We had great family time over dinner and we're left full from our meal,or so I thought. My little sister has a thing for dessert and she has allergies to peanuts so we have to be careful but low and behold they had a gluten free chocolate chip cookie and vanilla icecream dessert that was made completely from scratch in house and had no peanuts, we devoured that warm gooey goodness,not a drop was left. What a great evening I had with 2 people I love very much with food that warmed the soul...and put about 5 more happy pounds on my ass!"
Jordan S.,"Miami, FL",9,101,176,4.0,4/23/2017,"I brought 5 kids and my friend here for lunch. The service was actually abbot slow considering it wasn't that packed. But the kids meals are $6 which include burger sliders, mac n cheese and a few other good kid options. The price of the food is ok, once we got our bill, it was pretty normal. BEST KEPT SECRET: they sell movie tickets for $8.50!!! Adult or child tickets to Regal. So if you are planning to come here before the movie, I would buy the tickets here! That service in itself was worth the whole trip!"
Randy R.,"Homestead, FL",195,134,358,4.0,3/8/2017,So we came to the Falls and got hungry and decided on eating at BJ's. This would be my 3rd time at this restaurant so I can give a honest review based on all my experiences here. I like this place it has a nice atmosphere and some really nice people that work there. There food is pretty good I recently tried the broccoli cheddar soup in a bread bowl. I loved the concept of eating my soup and eating the bowl after that was already soaked in the soup! I also had the deep dish baked ziti which was very filling. When i fist ordered it i wasn't sure if it would fill me it looked small in the photo but was i wrong! I couldn't finish it .  On 2 of the 3 occasions I had at this restaurants the staff was very nice and professional. One time i came kinda late and the guy we got was a hot mess. Messed up the order never refilled our drinks which is mainly the reason it took me so long to come back. After this time I have restored faith in the restaurant and will be back more often.
Robert E.,"West Palm Beach, FL",1,35,2,1.0,10/26/2017,"Arrived at 10:55pm, sat at bar ordered beer and asked for menu. Now you would think that since I asked for a menu I was interested in ordering food. I guess the bartender didn't think so and talking with friends, showing pictures on their cell phones were more important than a first time customer. Finally when her visit was over she came to take my order, at this time there were only 3 people at the bar, and 6 people at a high top table. All of which had already eaten, and had drinks. Ordered an appetizer, waited, and waited, and waited, mind you the 9 people at the bar was it for customers in the entire place. Finally after 20 minutes the appetizer arrived. Terrible first impression."
Melanie U.,"Miami, FL",44,220,176,5.0,8/23/2016,"Updatint my review as I noticed this place has 2 1/2 stars! This establishment is full of great servers, great food & strong drinks! Come on your own, Yelp is not doing this place any favors unfortunately."
Maria Karla M.,"Miami, FL",145,110,97,2.0,4/29/2016,"The food was okay, I think this place is more hype than anything else. However, I did have a good time. I'm giving this place a two star because our service was extremely slow I went in at 8pm and was seated immediately but I left at 11. Our food took forever to come, and I don't mind waiting but the quality wasn't as good. I do gotta say we got the buffalo wings and they served us a lot which was surprising for $10. I got the double deluxe burger and I think it was way too much. My boyfriend got the great white deep dish pizza and I had high expectations for it but they were crushed. It had too much garlic and it wasn't shredded they put the little cubes instead- he only ate two slices. The piezokie was ok, but I wouldn't recommend the salted caramel. We watched the heat game there, the atmosphere was nice but not my favorite place."
Ron D.,"Miami, FL",88,18,1,2.0,7/21/2017,"This place has a pretty good selection of beer, very nice to see so much variety. The service was pretty good too, our waiter was very atentative and polite. The food was pretty awful, I mean below chili's quality. I ordered a chicken noodle dish that looked nice on the menu but what I got was a bowl of soggy noodles with a few pieces of chicken,  very bland soggy. Very awful.  My friend ordered salmon and brown rice, salmon was dry and bland as well.  I'll never eat there again."
Ratchel D.,"Miami, FL",340,419,737,4.0,6/13/2015,"I had a terrible experience with international mall location (poor service), so decided to give this location a chance.  FOOD - salmon and quinoa- light and refreshing. Well balanced, cooked and flavored to perfection  -Avo rolls- great tasting  -sweet and salty dessert-good portion for two and delicious  SERVICE Our waitress was polite, refilled our waters, made recommendations. All great.  I must add, I did hear a family complaining that they had been there for 25 mins and no one had approached them. I guess the service is spotty at this location, as well."
Jasmine N.,"Miami, FL",0,8,3,1.0,8/6/2017,Poor service lame food I ordered flatbread nacho lettuce cut in big pice tomato cut big too no knife skills what so ever and the miss the sour cream it was my first and last what it's this place what joke
Jamie M.,"Miami, FL",174,46,67,5.0,6/6/2016,"Confused as to why people rate this place so poorly.. The only comment I agree on when it comes to the reviews below me is that the menus were sticky. I'm not sure why, it would be nice if they put 100% effort in wiping them down.. But besides that, our experience was very enjoyable. We (double date) were seated at one of the round booths which was very comfortable! Our waiter was attentive and kind, we started off with drinks, I ordered some mixed drink with raspberries, pineapple and other fruit juices and gin. Strong and fruity. The others at the table ordered wine and beer.  We shared an appetizer of the stuffed mushroom caps, I believe it was an artichoke dip stuffed with a lemon drizzle on top. I plan on trying to make them!! Absolutely packed with flavor and recommended. For my main dish I ordered the deep dish baked ziti which had many bite sized sausages throughout, the sauce wasn't too red, pinkish and very cheesy. *Recommended*  The best part, we wanted to watch a movie afterwards and conveniently if you are eating at the restaurant you have the option to buy movie passes for ONLY $8.50 each!! Easily saving you $10 or more. I'm very happy with our experience, as I believe others are too since whenever I am at The Falls late at night I always seem to see a line of people waiting to be seated. The place is always packed which is a good sign, I look forward to returning!!"
Mark D.,"Miami, FL",23,259,571,3.0,11/19/2016,"My wife treated me to lunch on a weekday afternoon here recently. We were seated along with some other customers by an emotionally detached hostess. When the server came and asked her who had been seated first (we were) she replied ""I'm not sure"".  Eventually we were served. They offer a lunch special for $8.25 that gives all you can eat soup and salad. This is a great deal and the service was good;the food always came out quickly. We had the chicken tortilla soup(chocked with chicken, but a little too spicy at the end as though the spices had sunk to the bottom of the bowl). The clam chowder had a generous amount of clams and was quite good. The broccoli cheese soup was ""just ok"" and the tomato soup was MEH. The wedge salad and the Caesar salad were uninspired. Now, the mozzarella and tomatoes salad was excellent in both presentation and taste. I could've eaten it all day were I not dieting in anticipation of thanksgiving next week. I would return for the value of this lunch special. If and when I do, I will bring a jacket I swear. For some reason they keep it UNCOMFORTABLY cold in the restaurant, IDK why"
Alexa C.,"Miami, FL",0,12,,1.0,7/11/2017,"Walked in and staff seemed nice at first but once we got seated down we were ignored. Our waiter didn't come for a while and when he did he did not tell us his name. The silverware was  disgustingly dirty. Kept giving us attitude this whole experience.  My friend and I just saw our waiter walk outside to talk on his phone and to meet a friend outside, as we have been waiting at the table."

Marcos M.,"Miami, FL",2,5,1,2.0,1/7/2017,"Terrible service. We wait more the 10 minutes seated on table until the server showed up, After we complain to a busboy to find somebody. We never get a refills in our empty glasses. Food with good size but nothing to write HOME. Avocado rolls too spicy, Pepperoni extreme Pizza, no good at all. Kid Mac and cheese came cold. We will not come back again."
