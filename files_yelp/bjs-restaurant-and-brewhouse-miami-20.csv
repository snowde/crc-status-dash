Ana D.,"Miami Beach, FL",21,29,2,1.0,4/4/2014,Horrible service. Took forever to get our food. Our waiter hated life. Food was cold when we got it and it was average. Sorry I wasted a dinner here. Will not be back.
Claudia V.,"Miami, FL",3,35,2,3.0,9/20/2014,I went with a friend recently for the first time and loved the variety of drafted beer they offered. We sat at the bar had a few beers and ordered food. The wings we shared were pretty delicious.  They service was pretty about an 8 out of 10. This is definetly one of those places to go for a gathering or to watch a game.
Jonny S.,"Miami, FL",0,2,,3.0,3/31/2014,"Have been  few times. The food is pretty good. Good menu selections, Ok beer selection for a brewery. BUT.... the service needs to improve! They always seem to be short staffed even on slow nights. Some servers are friendly other not so much. They lack consistency on clearing tables, and getting your menus and drinks in a timely manner. Our last visit we asked to speak to a manager due to us sitting at a table that had not been cleaned and no sever approached us for 10-15 minutes on a slow night. The manager never came to hear our concerns. The place has potential to be a great sports bar. Improve the service! lower the volume on the sound system."
Mitchell G.,"Miami, FL",0,34,,1.0,3/5/2013,"Monochromatic salads, semi warm food, overly thickened sauces, stale chips, this is NOT a culinary hot spot. Add to it the loud and muffled sound system and conflicted Gluten free menu, why bother. If anybody had actually looked at the dishes before leaving the kitchen, none would have been served. Presentation may not be everything, but one expects them to actually try. The waiter was friendly but when asked, even he was confused by the menu. One expects more from what looks like a very professional chain type restaurant. On a cold night in Miami, the temperature inside was noticeably colder then it was outside. Other then the staff everyone kept their jackets on"
Catherine L.,"Miami, FL",61,59,31,4.0,5/3/2014,"Consistently good food. Not fussy, good service, and fair pricing. The pizzas are tasty, my favorite being their thin crust. We also enjoy their small bites as appetizers. A reasonable portion of little treats shareable with your date without stuffing you. The Parmesan crusted chicken is AMAZING!!!"
Patty C.,"Miami, FL",6,55,33,1.0,5/11/2014,I just went last night for the first time. I was pretty excited to try this place. The food wa terrible. The chicken wings were not saucy and very cold. The calamari was not fried but raw. Unhappy customer. Nice atmosphere bad food.  I wish the food would have been better.
Pachuco K.,"Miami, FL",6,42,41,2.0,12/17/2013,"So they opened up a few new restaurants at the Falls. Have to say love the atmosphere, looks great on the outside, looks busy, had to give it a try.  I was with my kids and we sat inside ( we were seated pretty quickly for a Sunday night;) ordered some appetizers: fried cheese stix and thai shrimp w lettuce leaves. cheese stix were nice and crispy and stringy inside -- A+ Thai srimp was good --B+ then I ordered the Ribeye $20 w mash potaoes - son ordered the reg wings Buffalo sauce my daughter  ordfered linguini w grilled chicken.  they brought boneless wings  and my Ribeye was Bland !!!! --- D no salt and pepper , nothing - I was so looking forward to having a nice juicy steak w a little charcoal flavor, I so wanted it to be good. the portion was nice but what a letdown. Waiter was innatentive and seemed way too busy to come back and check on us, we had to keep flagging him down. I had to ask to remove appetizer plates, for refills, and change dirty utensils !!!!! The decor is super but the food is so subpar it doesn't keep up to the expectations of the place or the Name. ' I see this as a great place to come hangout with friends and grab appetizers and drinks, I haven't tried the burgers or anything else, but, I'm not expecting too much.  What a let down !!!!!!!"
Rich M.,"Pompano Beach, FL",24,87,200,2.0,2/8/2014,"I hate to leave such a bad review, but this was a terrible place.  People are nice, but management at the boca location was terrible and the food was not good.  I mean, how do you mess up a cheeseburger?  I was so disappointed, I contacted the corp office, they suggested I try again.  I will give it another shot, maybe they just jad a bad day."
Ed M.,"Miami, FL",18,3,,1.0,8/23/2014,"The napkins where dirty had to ask for new clean ones. Service was unspectacular,  the order was messed up by the waiter,  ordered a deep dish pizza and specifically asked for green peppers, onions and mushrooms the only thing that came was mushrooms. Had to ask for refills. That was the only time the waiter came to our table when I called him over The food left you desiring for more. The Cole slaw in the tacos was brown and wilted. The French fries are soggy and had some sauce spilled on it that had nothing to do with our food. Will most likely never visit this pace again."
Sandy G.,"Miami, FL",2,9,,3.0,7/12/2014,"The food is pretty good and the menu is extensive, but it's overpriced and I've never had good service. Most places have bad service for the first several months since all the staff is new, but they've been open for over a year now and the service hasn't improved much. You'll typically sit for 5-10 minutes before they even greet you and take your drink order. It's always incredibly loud in there too! Must be the acoustics- but it sounds like every table is shouting and when sports are on it is unbearable. The appetizers are great- especially the crispy potato skins, but they're pricey. The home brews are average, but the homemade sodas are excellent!"
Brian K.,"Miami, FL",64,4,,4.0,6/18/2013,"BJ's is a fantastic sit-down restaurant in the Falls shopping mall. I've eaten here 3 times in the last few months with a small group of friends and we all love it. It has several large tv's located throughout the restaurant and bar area so no matter where you sit, you'll get a great view of whatever sporting event they have on.  And make sure to take advantage of their specials! If your sit in the bar area and order your meal before 7pm or after 10pm, the appetizers are 1/2 price and all draft beers at $1 off! Which brings me to the best part about BJ's, it's a brewhouse; so you know they always have a huge selection of great tasting beers.  Each time I have gone here, the service has been good too. The first 2 times, the waiters were incredibly helpful! (the last time was nothing special however)."
Manny L.,"Miami, FL",0,15,,3.0,8/4/2015,The appetizers are good and the handcrafted beers are tasty.  The entrees are decent but nothing special.  Overall this is a nice place to get a quick bite.
Jon K.,"Miami Beach, FL",0,10,,4.0,7/20/2015,"Great food and very good and friendly severs. Big menu and an iPhone app that can save a ton of time with ordering, paying, and getting a table. I recommend the food over several other restaurants in the falls. Food is better than Brio or Red Robin and service and wait time are much better than PF Changs. BJs is still chain food, but it's a well-priced option, especially if you're eating at the mall."
Cristina W.,"Hollywood, FL",594,262,206,3.0,12/5/2013,"The location had a lot to do with my review.. I don't know if it's because the Falls is always super congested, but we had the slowest service ever.  We also had a fairly new waiter, who didn't even know the current specials.  Lucky me, w/two kids under five in tow!  The food was average: I ordered a ny strip steak w/potatoes, and the meat was very tough and fatty.   My baked potato barely had any toppings, which had to be sent back. The meat was also completely rare, even though I asked for med. rare.  All in all, I think the best thing there was the Pizookie.. It was really yummy, and sweeeeeet! I don't know if i'd try it again, being that I have one local in Pembroke Pines.. maybe...."
Maggie C.,"Miami, FL",16,7,12,4.0,5/20/2014,Great place to watch a game. They have 1/2 price appetizers and mini pizza for happy hour and there enlighten entrees and very tasty. There beer selection is quite large and if you are unsure of which beer to choose they will bring you a sample. Did not have to wait to be seated for a weekday Eastern conference  Final Game. I highly recommend this place.
Barbara T.,"New York, NY",1,18,,1.0,9/26/2013,"Service was always a problem at this location and it has only gotten worse. Especially with larger parties. Servers seem to be too busy to help anyone. Food was ok but is not worth the aggravation. Poozkie's are amazing but not worth the money, effort or huge amounts of wait time. I can cook up some cookie dough at home and have a much better experience."
Maria E.,"Hollywood, FL",127,11,4,4.0,4/9/2014,"Great food, great beer great hang great service ... Amanda was great! Big screens to watch the game!! I totally recommend"
Melissa Ann H.,"Miami, FL",123,33,40,3.0,2/22/2014,I've been here a few times. Food is always good but service is consistently horrible. Never leave earlier then 3 hours and that is with a party of 2 for lunch on a Wednesday. But the bright side is that everything I've ordered has been good! So if you have time its worth a try maybe you'll have better experience!
Angel L.,"Homestead, FL",18,10,21,1.0,7/6/2013,"Just went to this restaurant last night and it was plain awful!  My partner and I frequented the place several times over the past 6 months and it was OK at first.  The food was good but has been getting progressively worse and so has the service.  We can say that 4 out 6 times we've been there in the past few months have been bad experiences.  Last night was absolutely the worst though. First our margaritas were weak even though we asked for top shelf and asked for frozen, we got on the rocks.  We returned them.  The second try were good.  Good thing, b/c we needed the buzz for what came next!  Our dinner came before our appetizer, cancelled the appetizer.  The waiter was apologetic but aloof.  To top it off when I was about to pay, his pen didn't work, he said it did, I said, never mind, got up and looked for another waiter who had a working pen, so I could sign my tab and escape the madness.  It was indeed a Kafkaesque experience, just plain surreal.  The building itself is OK, in that it's in the Falls and overall it's pleasant if you sit outside.  Inside?  I don't recommend it unless you like sitting in a noisy sports bar where you can barely hear yourself speak.  Never mind it's a meat locker, just plain cold.  Decor is OK, TVs everywhere, not a plus for us but hey some people like NASCAR?  Won't be going back anytime soon.  We've tried to give this place a chance but 4 out of 6 just aren't good odds."
Jasmine S.,"Miami, FL",0,10,,2.0,7/9/2015,"Okay food, horrible service! Took almost 1 hr before we got our meals and it wasn't even correct we were so hungry we decided to just eat it. Food was alright nothing to be wowed about"
