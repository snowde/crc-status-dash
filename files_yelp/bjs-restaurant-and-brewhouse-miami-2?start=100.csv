Mort B.,"Miami, FL",0,46,13,3.0,11/25/2015,"Actually had a decent meal with decent service tonight. Been about two years since last visit which was poor.  Had the chicken pesto flat bread. Solid. Split a Mediterranean chicken taco that was very good. Good flavors, fresh in taste.  Service was meh,so so like last time which is on par for most pave in the south Miami area."
Jorge B.,"Miami, FL",146,137,14,1.0,3/11/2016,Terrible the food took for ever to come out.. 1 waitress for a huge section no busboy in sight on Friday night come on. Not worth the price or time. Had to call a manager over..
Bennet M.,"Austin, TX",224,236,423,4.0,4/10/2014,Not bad. I was a little skeptic to go here because of the reviews. Maybe because I came during lunch so it was not that busy. Our waitress was very knowledgeable about her beers which was great. She also had some good lunch suggestions. I enjoyed the Parmesan chicken sandwich with wedge fries. Nothing fantastic but not bad either. Couldn't complain. Chicken was cooked perfectly. Overall I'm glad we have this a try.  Be back again whenever we are in the area if we feel like eating American food.
Jennifer V.,"Miami, FL",0,11,,4.0,11/5/2016,Great beer and decent pub food.  The staff is always very attentive and have never had to wait for a seat.
Sean B.,"Miami, FL",95,180,80,4.0,5/13/2015,"BJs brewhouse is a solid place to go for a beer and a nice deep dish pizza. My personal favorite beer that is brewed in house is The Oasis, it's kinda of like Yjengling as they describe it.  On the Pizza side the personal Deep Dish Buffalo Chicken Pizza is awesome. Also they have a photos happy hour with half off appetizers and 2 dollar Bud Lights."
Kristen V.,"Miami Springs, FL",0,8,,2.0,8/2/2016,"I've been to this location a few times and service can be hit or miss. But now when I went the service was so terrible. I'm a server myself so I know the struggle of it but I feel like my waitress saw my friend and I were young and assumed we wouldn't tip. First off we went for dinner and it almost took two hours cause of how slow are food was being brought out. At my restaurant, apps take 7 min tops to come out and I know that's how it is here too because my bestfriend works at the doral location. Our app took twice that time to come out. Then our food which we placed the order right when our apps came out took another 30-40 minutes to come out. Everytime she asked me if I wanted a refill on my drink, she'd forget to bring it and come up to me again and ask me again did u want a refill and I was like uh yeah. Finally our food came out, not only was it bad but it was wrong. 10 dollars for a flatbread which was mostly bread with no tomato or cheese on it. My friends ribs were burnt and she ordered the portobello mushroom salad instead they brought fried mushrooms. Now I've had bad service before but the reason I'm writing this review is because they brought the dish to our table and then we told them no this isn't what we order. They took it to the back. Another completely different server who we hadn't seen all night came up to us and said  did you order the fried mushroom small app and my friend said oh no the order was wrong. We after saw him leave directly to the kitchen and walk out with the SAME plate of mushrooms and took it to another table. THIS IS NOT OK. Any restaurant I've worked at when food hits another table if it is wrong, they will usually give it to the staff or throw it away. I will not being come back to this location solely because I don't know now if my food has been coming from the kitchen or a different table. Bad service overall."
Steve C.,"Davie, FL",1315,671,2242,4.0,1/12/2014,"Ducked in with The Wolfe for a martini and a peek. Nice. Here's why:  * We ran into some old friends * Cool decor * Hotties abound  * Excellent service * Everything is new * Swanky beers * Great energy in this lively joint People waiting to get in at dinner, so plan accordingly. Great place to watch football. Combo restaurant, sport's bar, and brewhouse. Didn't eat this trip, but I shall next visit."
Mayra P.,"Miami, FL",1,10,5,2.0,3/23/2016,"Bad experience. First and last time eating here. Came in for dinner and it was not too crowded. We ordered an appetizer and our food right away. Waiting a while for our appetizer and it never came, our food got there and when we were done eating they brought our appetizer, they never refilled our drinks. The waitress asked if I needed anything when I was telling her she took off without letting me speak."
Phil J.,"Miami, FL",19,4,,1.0,4/9/2016,What a disappointing meal. We used to come in all the time. We even have one of their rewards card. But lately even though the service has been good the food is not up to par. We order the chicken crusted parmigiana which used to be good. Like looked like somebody fried a piece of foam. We order the flatbread appetizer and it came right before they deliver the chicken. No wonder they got 2 1/2 stars. The beer was good oh forgot nobody has to cook it.
Melissa W.,"Homestead, FL",0,6,,5.0,11/12/2016,Great place! Have a wonderful variety of menu items as well as drink selections. They brew their own beer and sodas which are fabulous. Our server Rocky was fantastic. He was very knowledgeable about the menu and was very attentive. Will defiantly return and to have Rocky serve us again. The original cream soda is my favorite and a must try. They have the best ribs too... fall of the bone. Also the white chocolate macadamian nut pizzokie is the BEST!!!!
Virgi L.,"Miami, FL",53,52,47,5.0,5/18/2015,I love this place the food is great especially after shopping all day! I like their food selection which is always tasty. I always ask for the calamari and they know how to serve it up really well! They have a great crew that works diligently and making you comfortable  by bringing you bread which I happen to love.
Jose V.,"Miami Beach, FL",0,5,,1.0,1/6/2016,"On Tuesday half off wine so why not, wife had email for buy 1 entree get 1 free hell ya, lets go kids in school holidays over i am in. Wine was good, had good food before always went with smaller items like burgers, tacos easy food to not mess up.  Server recommended rib eye $23.00 or ribs $22.00. In these type of places and i mean almost all places that i order big steaks unless your a ""real"" steak house they somehow NEVER are able to cook Medium Rare which is the only way to consume a rib eye with wine. Server was great though, bar area booths, too bad he paid the price for the HUGE errorssss. I always tell the server must be medium rare clearly and no salt since all places over salt, not grey, pink, not overly picky but if you order a steak the only thing u have to do is cook it right. Salads come out, good, was a little chilly out, so ordered soups wife broccoli cheddar just warm not hot but didn't mention it, my clam chowder, good warm not hot, stayed quiet we don't complain about little things,,,, Ribs come out and Server had mentioned they changed recipe or something and they where good no prob. Steak comes out and Boom without cutting meat you can tell  the ""done-ness"" by softly pushing your finger down on it, if its soft, medium rare if its hard and so- on. Of course my steak grey hard well cooked not even medium which i do understand is a fine line. Server came he saw acknowledged i said sorry but i have to, ordered second bottle for upcoming great steak. Wait for it, wait for it, Boom, comes out looks perfect great color, big, soft to the touch for those that just learned you don't have to cut steak to tell, as a matter of fact if u cut it it will bleed....then.... Holy Crap salted to the death so salty i scraped and scraped and salty wine salt wine salt, didn't tell server he would have cried. Manager came by and asked how is it this time. Super Salty I said, He Said "" They tell us to dip and drop in spices both sides and try to get a crust"" Horrible idea they are idiots as to how to cook meat, Servers tip suffered, manager cared less , i shoveled it down and drank a gallon of wine, water and whatever, bogo deal soothed the pain, ouch tongue on fire, kidneys pumping salty stuff out wife was happy, dogs happy bones, good drinks, burger maybe next time,  no STEAK HERE!!!"
Leslie M.,"Palmetto Bay, FL",19,17,,5.0,3/28/2016,We visit BJ's quite often (a couple times per month) and can always count on receiving friendly service.  Can't remember a time when we haven't received it.  I love their thin pizzas and pastas.   My hubby really loves the jambalaya (be warned: even mild is spicy!).  Great variety of beer too!!! Highly recommend.
Diana G.,"Palmetto Bay, FL",52,66,90,4.0,2/15/2015,"We often eat here on weekends, sitting in the bar area as it is first come, first serve. The waiter, Cricket, is usually our server. He is very attentive and gives very good customer service. They have happy hour specials on drinks and appetizers. I usually have the Mediterranean Chicken Tacos with quinoa. It has a low calorie meal with a nice sized portion."
Jeffrey A.,"Miami, FL",1,4,,1.0,11/11/2015,"What a horrible experience I have had at this place!!! But today proved to be the worst when a cockroach came on my food as part of a healthy ingredient. I approached the waiter in a calmed manner and the manager didn't do anything about this incident other than saying ""we have never seen a roach here before!"" I am not looking for a free meal or desert but at least try to remove the plate from my table!!!  I will NEVER visit a BJ's again!!!!!"
Faiyaz H.,"Miami, FL",3,109,,3.0,2/22/2015,"Hit Or Miss - Average This place is hit or miss, there have been times we have gone and the service has been good and times we have gone where the service has been horrible.  This particular time it was pretty good service."
Bob L.,"Miami, FL",0,6,,4.0,3/28/2016,Good service by the waitress and attentive manager fixed a minor problem...resulting in a complimentary Poozkie. Some of the best draft beer in town.
Jessica A.,"Miami, FL",354,325,364,2.0,4/6/2013,"I've been to this place a few times now, and it still hasn't WOW'd me. They say they're known for their pizza, and I'm a pizza lover! But, I do not recommend ordering any of the pizzas!  You should know, that the time you go is what will factor into the type of service you're going to get. My first visit the waiter forgot to place in our order for the appetizer, yet at the end when I went to pay the bill, I was being charged for it. It later took 20 minutes to remove the item from the bill. This occurred on a Wednesday evening, and it wasn't even busy.  My last visit there, I went with three friends for beers and some snacks on a Friday night. After waiting 45 minutes, I was hoping the service would be good. Yet, it took 15 minutes for the waiter to even acknowledge us. Once we all placed our drink orders, it took another 10 minutes for us to get them. The appetizers came out quick, but it was nothing out of this world. The burger I have to say was on point. Great burger. Overall, this place could have potential if it weren't for the lousy service I've received each time."
Michelle C.,"Miami, FL",687,975,237,4.0,2/18/2013,"If I lived closer, this could easily be my staple-go-to-I'm-not-actually-dressing-up-and-this-totally-doesn't-count-as-going-to-dinner restaurant. It's is kinda TGIFish in that there is a large menu with something for everyone. We tried and liked: Roasted veggie flat bread pizza Avocado spring rolls Mac n cheese It can be family friendly, sports garish like, quick bite while at the mall... if can wear many different hats. (Side note, that is one thing I love about the falls, is that they don't have ""mall food"" or a food court. They have great restaurants.)"
Irene H.,"Miami, FL",2,39,15,4.0,1/3/2015,"We had visited another location a couple of years ago when this chain first opened in Miami. We were so disappointed with the service that we decided not to revisit this chain.  Fast forward to Xmas 2014 when we get a gift card to BJ's Restaurant. The gift giver told us about this location and we decided that's where we'd go. What a difference. We sat at the bar as soon as we saw a couple of seats open up while waiting for a table.  I'm a sports junkie. So, sitting in front of a MASSIVE TV showing 4 different games is one of my many happy places. I was excited to see Black & Tan on the menu.. but once I saw they had Stella on tap, I asked the bar tender if she could pour the B&T using Stella instead. ""Yeah, no problem!"" I've been craving a Back & Gold since trying one a few months prior so I'm glad I have another place I can get it without getting a weird look in return or ""You want a what?"".  Here's what we got: 4 Black & Gold 1 Grilled Atlantic Salmon with rice pilaf and Caesar Salad 1 Lemon Thyme Chicken No complaints about the food or service. Definitely plan on stopping in again.. at this location. Also, to give you an idea on pricing, the whole list above came in at $59."
