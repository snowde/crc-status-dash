Victoria S.,"Miami, FL",28,3,,1.0,10/12/2014,"This place is really not good.  Hostess was less than desirable, told us there was a 15 min wait...even though I counted 9 empty tables as I walked to the bathroom.  Once we were seated, the waitress was friendly and nice. Had calamari for appetizer, pretty chewy & not that great. For main course had pizza (which came highly recommended). All I can say is, it's not delivery, it's DiGiorno. The sauce on the pizza was awful & it could be found in any frozen food aisle in a supermarket. Nasty! Please don't waste your money, it's really terrible."
Manuel R.,"Miami, FL",0,3,,5.0,3/28/2016,Visited Sunday March 27th 2016.  Waiting time was excellent. The Waitress (Natalia) was great.  She was very attentive to all our needs and without being intrusive kept us up to date on drinks and other necessities.  The food quality was great and portion sizes adequate. The beer selection excellent.  The prices were very competitive.  A must visit.
Lissete D.,"Miami, FL",284,557,220,3.0,1/3/2013,"I'm still on the fence about this one. We went on New Year's Day. The wait time was quoted as 25 minutes, but it actually took less. Staff is friendly and our server was efficient albeit a bit rushed.  Our appetizers were served and we still had not received napkins or silverware. The noise level is really high. We had to repeat our orders a couple of times because our server could not hear us.  Table conversation was a bit difficult as well. The temperature in the restaurant kept fluctuating from comfortable to freakin' cold! I saw several people get up and come back with jackets, so I was not the only one feeling it. Now, for the food. The menu has tons of great sounding options. We opted for the spinach artichoke dip and the Bruschetta to start. The dip was served hot with fresh chips. It tasted good but not Hillstone good. The tiny bruschetta bites were good as well, (you really can't screw that up) and it was served with a pesto-y dipping sauce. Our entrees consisted of Chix Fried Steak (very peppery), the BBQ Chix Deep Dish Pizza (nice crust, but sauce was super spicy) and the grilled burger melt. The burger was good but the bottom bread was very soggy, which led me to believe that it had been sitting for a while. They have 2 options for fries, thin cut and seasoned steak fries. Both were good, my preference is the thin cut though. Nothing was served greasy, so they got points for that. Finally, dessert. We chose the Pizookie trio, which was served 20 minutes after ordering! After 15 we asked our server about the delay. she told us that they are baked when ordered, so it usually takes a while. it would have been nice if this had been mentioned before we ordered.  The trio consists of.... wait for it... THREE cookies topped with ice cream. They are served in the baking tins and look like I could have made it in my old easy bake oven.  Now for the Goldilocks moment. One was perfect, one was hard, and the other one was too soft, and probably undercooked. But the ice cream was good. We will probably give them another shot. Try different menu items though. I would definitely choose them over TGIFriday's, but there are other choices in the immediate area. Oh, my husband did not like their IPA but their sampler is a good deal. I think it was a sampler of (8) 5 oz samples for $14. Maybe next time."
Vee S.,"Houston, TX",0,20,8,3.0,12/30/2015,The food was good and what you would expect from a BJ's restaurant. And alot of good gluten free options. However the service just wasn't as good as other BJ's I've been too. The waiter just brought the check to the table without us asking for it or the stopping in to see if we'd like dessert which we did.
Micheal S.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",1,79,,1.0,6/30/2016,"I try to avoid chain restaurants as much as possible. This dining experience let me know that I definitely made the right decision. One of my friends that were with us insisted we go here. The waitress seemed in a hurry the whole time. Drinks were never refilled. The food was mediocre. We only saw her when she took the order and when she delivered the check. The restaurant was not busy at all on this Wednesday night. The worst part is that when I got home I got a call from my bank that my credit card has had some strange transactions on it and they wanted to confirm I made those purchases. I did not, so I have some suspicion that someone at the restaurant used my credit card number."
Darren H.,"Atlanta, GA",95,1030,516,3.0,12/17/2012,I'd give higher starts to the food than for the service. Once we placed our initial order for appetizers it took us about 20 to 30 minutes to see our waitress again. We had the smattering of appetizers from:  * Margherita Fresca = If you like the Margherita pizza's you will enjoy. * Fresh Basil with Italian Sausage = another good choice * Buffalo boneless chicken = a bit too much sauce.   Our main's were good as well I ordered the Grilled Pork Chops with the cheddar mashed potatoes & green beans.  Now if they can get there act together with the wait staff I would have given them 4 stars.
Natalie M.,"Ferndale, WA",218,47,103,1.0,5/12/2015,"I have been to this joint 2 times. Both times that I have gone, the food that is served is VERY greasy with close to no flavor. The guest I was with, wanted to speak to the manager about the dish they ordered (angel hair with shrimp) and the manager basically told the guest, the dish ordered is an American dish and that's the BJ's way... A bit awkward and to say the least not very pleasing to the customer. In addition, servers are not very pleasant. I will say the cleanliness of the restrooms are awesome! This joint has A TON of potential if the manager changes his attitude and have some one properly educate the chefs on the dishes being sent out or hire new chefs with experience..."
Nicole W.,"Miami, FL",106,248,571,1.0,4/11/2014,"I wanted to celebrate the end of the work week (TGIF) so I decided to head over to BJ's for ""happy hour"". Unfortunately, our waitress Sara took the happy out of happy hour, as she had a nasty attitude and provided the slowest service I've ever experienced! I am assuming it's because after sitting for a while with no service, I jokingly asked a very pleasant server that was helping the table next to us, to be our waiter. I said that before I even met her, so it was nothing personal. And truthfully, if she was so bothered by my request, she should have had someone else take our table! On top of her crappy attitude, she didn't know what was discounted during happy hour, so we decided to order away based on what the hostess told us, and just handle any discreptancies at the end. To start with, we ordered two glasses of wine, the Santa Fe spring rolls, and the stuffed mushrooms. Both appetizers were awesome. After asking someone to track down Sara, we were able to order another round of drinks and appetizers. I ordered my favorite Belgian beer (Lindeman's Framboise) and my friend ordered another glass of the wine she started with. Sara seemed upset that she didn't ask for the wine by its name and quickly corrected her! I'm not making this up! lol Anyway, we ignored her and continued ordering... We got the corn fritters with bacon aioli, avocado egg rolls and the California club flatbread pizza. The pizza was delish, however the avocado egg rolls and the corn fritters were flavorless. My friend wanted to order a third glass of wine, but Sara was again, unavailable!  At the end of our meal, I presented Sara with a ""coupon"" the valet attendant gave me so she could take $5 off the check. She made up her face and seemed bothered, so I asked her if the coupon was unfamiliar to her. She stated it wasn't, so I'm not sure what the face was for. I'm thrilled that the Falls has decided to provide ""free"" valet to those that patronize certain restaurants as it can be a challenge to find parking there. Despite the poor service, I enjoyed happy hour at BJ's as we sat on the patio and soaked up the beautiful weather while indulging in great conversation. Before we left, I let the manager know about the horrible service, so he could let Sara know why she got a measly 14% tip.  This was my second visit to BJ's, (the first was much better) so I will give it one more try. If the service is like this again, I'm done! There are too many great places in Miami for me to put up with subpar service!"
Juan P.,"Miami, FL",60,5,1,4.0,1/7/2016,Ok I've agreed with everyone but I will give an extra star because those spinach stuffed mushrooms are so great... I believe the service has gotten better over the past year. Hopefully everything will work out better soon :)
Aimee R.,"Miami, FL",105,83,158,5.0,8/29/2014,"I'm a regular here. Always prefer to come during it's Happy Hour. Good prices on drinks and apps. Today was the boneless wing with sweet teriyaki and some spice to it. Very tasty and filling. I usually have salad before a meal, but this time was opposite. Good move. Had the ever so delicious, tangy and sweet watermelon salad. Aah! How refreshing after a spicy dish. I wish the salad was bigger. So good. Will make at home. My waiter was great and attentive. Noise level was very low bc I came in so early."
Moe P.,"Miami, FL",127,157,1858,2.0,9/18/2015,Horrible that i can bot reserve a table unles it is 6 or less people. Happy birthday to me :(
Valerie D.,"Hollywood, FL",78,16,111,3.0,3/26/2014,Had to go twice to make sure but it must have just been the food I personally ordered. The first time I ordered the sampler and only 2 out of the 7 were edible.. My 5 year old enjoyed the mozzerella sticks. Spent far to much. Drinks were amazing! Bartender was perfect. Wait time SUCKS ASS so it's best to go on Monday. Wear something nice cuz everyone around u has money. Service is ok.
Ralphy C.,"Miami, FL",10,10,,1.0,6/26/2016,"HORRIBLE!!!! The worst food I've ever tasted, I don't know why I continue to give this place a chance. Been here 4 times and it keeps getting worse. Good service but disgusting food. If I could give no stars I would"
Peggy a.,"Miami, FL",91,114,67,1.0,4/3/2015,"Well Manager, Michael Kennedy, reached out and I ""WAS"" pleasantly surprised he took interest in possibly remedying my experience BUT to my dismay he publicly reached out to me as an act! He actually put the wrong phone number and wrong email address in his message to me.  I did, obviously, reach the restaurant and left and message and emailed his correct email address both were ignored! What was the point of reaching out to me???"
Viviane S.,"Weston, FL",201,12,,3.0,11/30/2015,Bland food (I had the Tina sashimi salad) but not offensive.  A step down from Cheesecake Factory but similar feel w more focus on the beer.
Jeni D.,"Dallas, TX",29,20,10,2.0,11/30/2015,The food is delicious but the service and atmosphere leave a lot to be desired. It is loud even when people aren't there. The hostesses sometimes are snappy and let their frustration show. The burgers are great and the cookie dessert is delicious.
Luis D.,"Homestead, FL",0,1,3,4.0,10/16/2015,"Great atmosphere, good beer. Also make sure you take advantage of the discounted movie tickets."
Amanda H.,"Miami, FL",0,22,,3.0,7/10/2016,This place is just okay. It's bar food you could probably get anywhere. I've come here a lot out of convenience. The staff wether it's busy or not takes forever to greet you at the door and the wait staff is not very attentive. I've done take out a few times and just about every time I get home to check the food we have items missing.
Allison T.,"Annapolis, MD",43,25,16,3.0,8/19/2015,"They're just okay. This is a very generic dining experience in my opinion. I wouldn't pick this place over anything else nearby since there are so many options. I think where they shine is their beer, but I don't really drink beer so I can't be the judge on their offerings."
Erin M.,"Key Largo, FL",46,4,,1.0,12/30/2015,I am not sure why I keep coming back. Every time the service and food is beyond slow. With each visit I am always informed that the server is new. It isn't a surprise that they can't keep there wait staff as I am sure most guests leave un-happy. This time we waited for over 30 minutes only to be served pizzas which weren't fully cooked. This was my last visit here as I am officially done giving them another chance.
