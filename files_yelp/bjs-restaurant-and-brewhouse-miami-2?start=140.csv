Emilci V.,"Miami, FL",46,14,,1.0,3/27/2014,"Been here 3 times, each time I have gone the service has been horrendous. The waiters take forever to come and ask you what you want then once they leave you don't see them for like 20 minutes, in other words there were no refills on drinks or to see if everything is OK so service was poor to say the least.  The last time I went one of the servers was actually sitting at a table talking to customers! Then our meals were cold and when I called management because some of us received our meals and the others didn't until everyone else was done, he was very rude and said what do you want me to do about it? I told him due to the fact that service was horrendous and that he was asking me what I wanted I said I am not paying and I want you to comp the whole meal. At first he said no and I said then you are going to have to arrest me because I am leaving, He walked away and didn't come back so I went back to look for him and said, ""Well?"" He said leave I'm comping the meal, so I  had to ask him for a receipt to make sure and then I left. I will never go back and I do not recommend that anyone goes. It was so bad I don't think it deserved 1 star!!!!"
Zina A.,"Miami, FL",20,73,14,5.0,7/22/2015,I have kind of avoided this place since I thought it was generic and didn't have great reviews but after being there a few times I must say I have never tried anything that hasn't been great.
Mercy D.,"Miami, FL",8,107,21,1.0,8/15/2015,We sat at the bar area. Service was terrible. Waitress was very indifferent. She needs training on how to treat customers. I had a wedge salad...yuck...not fresh. Lettuce was stale and so was the bacon. I shared a pizza with my husband. When the pizza arrived at the table I noticed that the shredded Parmesan on the pizza wasn't melted. When we bit into the pizza it was still cold. We had to send it back. They did give us a new and fully cooked pizza this time. Waitress didn't even apologize. The restaurant is very loud. I will think twice before coming here again
Matt A.,"Miami, FL",39,24,1,2.0,8/10/2015,"Had an interesting experience here last night. In the past, there have been no issues and the food was decent. I came with a group of 3 other people, and had some of the worst service from our server, Elizabeth. Three out of four dishes arrived at once, and the forth dish had ""somehow gotten deleted,""  a fact that she decided to share with us as the food was coming out. In addition, she would vanish for 30 minutes at a time and we were the only table in her section. What should have been an hour and a half meal ended up being 2.5. She tried to push dessert on us with our entrees still in front of us. And to top it off, the table was never cleared, so that when coffee arrived, we had to bus our own table. The manager did not seem to care when this info was brought to his attention, and simply handed us a voucher for a cookie. I have seen other reviews talking about bad service, and it comes from the top. Bad managers hire bad staff and do bad training, bottom line.  Two stars because the food was adequate."
Barbara S.,"Cypress, CA",7,3,,4.0,10/19/2015,"Neither my sister or I live in Miami any more and were planning a surprise birthday party for our dad; Being a fan of BJs in other locations, we figured this would be a safe bet. My sister worked with the managers, i will have to come back to this review and add their names later, but they were so unbelievably helpful and understanding - especially with trying to manage planning a large party from 3000 miles away. with the exception of a little table snafu early on in the evening, the rest of the night was on point - the head server, i beleive her name was Rachel (i will come correct this if i am wrong) was OVER THE TOP and there was never an empty glass on the table - the food was out and ready exactly when we were promised it, it was excellent and the entire crew was SO accomodating - our party ended up at roughly 30 people and we all felt like we were the only party in the place.  Note: this was 7 pm on Friday night, they had a FULL restaraunt on top of our large party and it was raining sideways outside - i didnt hear a single grumble from my party or any others Definitely recommend this location and as i said, i'll be back to edit this review to update the names of the managers and server - because they really deserve MAJOR props!! well done folks!"
Karina E.,"Cutler Bay, FL",1,7,,5.0,10/18/2015,Was very busy last night (a Saturday) but service was GREAT!!! Food came quickly and our waiter Brandon was very attentive!
Bradley C.,"Miami, FL",1,21,3,1.0,4/5/2014,"The beer was cold.. Management walked by us as though we didn't exist, he was too busy paying attention to a large party at the next table. The picture of the kale salad is false advertising. The scallop dinner was luke cold, my medium/well cooked bison burger was bloody in the center. And trust me it wasn't 4 ozs. The manager came back when the waitress called him and he removed the charges for the pitiful entrees. I think he was proud of himself. I should have looked at the Yelp reviews before I went, my bad! I got home and looked at the receipt they gave me, it doesn't have the name of the restaurant on it....weird?"
Shannon B.,"Cutler Bay, FL",1,30,15,4.0,11/25/2015,"We had a great meal out, the avocado egg rolls are a unique and yummy appetizer. Its a nice atmosphere with a great variety of eats."
Vanessa S.,"Cutler Bay, FL",4,6,,2.0,8/21/2015,"Service is horrible (each time we went -- went about 5 times). One of the times our pizza was cold. Had to wait to reheat it (with a hungry toddler). Food has been inconsistent in our experience. The last time I went a waiter backed into my four year old so hard it knocked her over. She started crying and all he said was ""sorry!"" and walked away. Maybe he got nervous? I don't know but either way I was so offended I just left. But when the food is good, it's really good."
Jonathan C.,"Houston, TX",26,46,21,4.0,5/22/2014,"I love the atmosphere of this place, they know how to bring some class to a place that basically serves drinks and burgers. The wait staff is polite and our waiter was amiable enough. The music level was a little loud for my taste, and having a conversation while trying to overcome the din of the room was a bit annoying. Be prepared for a loud crowd though since they show sports on almost all their tvs. All in all I'm sure I'll be dining here again for a group dinner!"
Fernanda U.,"Miami, FL",3,61,60,2.0,5/21/2015,"The quality us not what it was before.  I never, never return food to a restaurant but boy it was bad that i did not hsd a choice. I can tell they have not change the oil in a long time. Too bad this place was a good place before to hangout with a beer."
Tiffany M.,"Miami, FL",14,7,16,4.0,4/30/2014,This place is like an upgraded ale house.. the food is way better and their pizookie is a must have..the place is clean and Well kept and I love the jalapeno burger
Anthony S.,"Miami, FL",5,20,,4.0,4/25/2015,Not sure why this has so many bad reviews. This place it like a much better Chili's Friday's etc. Everything I had is between pretty good to very good. I would recommend the fish and chips. The beer is good as well.
Nichole M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",47,27,6,2.0,7/11/2013,"Came here with my family on a Thursday night for my grandmother's birthday. We got sat in a really uncomfortable half-booth which made it really hard to get in and out for bathroom breaks. Which didn't make much sense considering when we got there there was a wide open section where they could have easily put us without us all being on top of each other. We only had one waitress taking care of our 15-top. She didn't write ANYTHING down. Needless to say a lot if orders were messed up. My sister and I were sitting at one end of the table and had ordered the ahi poke as an appetizer for us while the rest of the table had egg rolls and cheese sticks. Except, it was long after the server cleaned up the other appetizers when we could finally flag her down. It's a raw tuna dish. It shouldn't take that long. Then came out orders. I don't know about everyone else, but I had the pot roast. The reason I chose the pot roast over a steak was because it came with roasted veggies as a side. It just so happens that I love roasted veggies. My vegetables were literally mirepoix. Chunks of raw onion, raw celery, and raw carrots that looked like they'd seen an oven for maybe 5 seconds. I say raw because when I bit into a carrot, it was hard and COLD. I would have said something to our server, but we barely saw her.  The desserts were good. Very rich. My sister and I shared a pizookie trio.  The problem with the food though, aside from them clearly not knowing what ""roasted"" means, was that every single person in our party went home and got sick that night - by definition a food born illness.  But for me probably the WORST part about the experience was that as we were leaving, the server had the balls to pick up the check book, open it, and then smile and thank my uncle (who by the way didn't pay).  As someone who has worked in almost every position in both front and back of house in restaurants and hotels - I have to say I think it is rude, tacky, and shows an extreme lack of class.  I'm glad you like your tip, maybe next time you'll actually earn it.  I would honestly give this place no stars if I could, plus one for the dessert.  Will not be going back."
James B.,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",1529,20,,4.0,9/18/2014,"nice causal style restaurant with a nice beer selection, they offer there own beers, which I recommend you try and they offer beers from other breweries. They have a nice menu selection too from salads, sandwiches, deep dish pizzas, pastas, and steaks. I recommend trying the roast beef dip snadwich, it was a good sandwich. I recommend signing up for there BJ's premier rewards card, it's free to sign up and every-time you use it, you get points, when you get enough points, you can use the points to get money off your check."
Stephen L.,"Miami, FL",3,32,8,1.0,5/17/2015,"Used to be one of the best places to go and watch a game...used to be. The two girl bartenders are horrible.  If that was not enough, they obviously do not clean up well...too many fruit flies behind the bar. My suggestion is to avoid until the management gets their location under control."
Michael D.,"Miami, FL",1,26,,2.0,8/8/2014,"I went again. I don't know why. the only reason I gave it one more star than I did last time is because I sat at the bar instead of sitting at a table. Food was bad and late, again. The bartender was more attentive than the server last time (thus the extra star), but not by a lot.  I'm really very disappointed in BJ's I used to go when I lived out west all the time and I loved the food, but these people are just butchering it. Apparently the standards they hold for service now are that of a fast food restaurant located in the hood, I'm done, never going back again."
Laura D.,"Miami, FL",454,127,158,4.0,1/6/2015,"After my husband nagged me to try this place, I finally gave in. I'm not a big beer fan but this place brews their own beers and I have to say that they are pretty darn good. After reviewing the menu, I noticed that the menu seemed very similar to the Cheesecake Factory. It turns out that the founder was somehow involved. We sat at the bar and service was prompt. We ordered the Santa Fe chicken rolls and they were very tasty. However I prefer the ones from a Cheesecake Factory. These were much smaller and sauce wasn't as tasty. We also shared a large pizza that had pepperoni, sausage and green peppers. The pizza came out hot but I wasn't very impressed. The pizza was average compared to other similar restaurants. All in all, I will definitely be coming back and trying more dishes from BJs. We like it because it's close to come, has great beer, and a great place for groups."
Michele D.,"Miami, FL",2,1,2,1.0,5/11/2015,"Came here on a Monday night. We ordered our appetizers first and entrees 10 minutes after. They ended up bringing out both the entrees and appetizers at the same time! Talk about slowwwww service! And a manager who did not care about his customers, along with our non attentive waitress. Wouldn't come back!"
Edwin M.,"Hialeah, FL",53,49,7,1.0,6/1/2013,"I'm a fan of BJs Brewhouse, I've been to the one in Doral and in Pines and these places have been great. Great service, great food and of course the beer!  But the one in the Falls is horrible! We did get lucky and only had a 20 minute wait, but the service was terrible. Our waitress took our appetizers and beer order and came back 15 minutes later because she forgot what we ordered.  Our drink orders took forever and she forgot to put in part of our appetizers order. I would ask her questions about the BJs rewards program and she didn't know anything about it. She couldn't answer any of our questions.  And whenever she did answer she basically made things up, because I do happen to know everything about the rewards program and I know how it works.  The management needs to train their people better at this BJs. And hire greeters that don't make smartass comments about questions you make while you're walking out. (won't even get into it.)  The all around service at this BJs is just bad. We definitely won't be coming back to this location again and I won't recommend it to any of my friends. Stick to Pines or the International mall locations,  you'll have a much better experience."
