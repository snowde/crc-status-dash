Beth B.,"Miami, FL",20,9,,2.0,9/14/2013,"The food was decent so it gets two stars. Our main server was terrible, the manager was roaming around with her cell phone. Menu was food encrusted and we were almost run down at the front door by the exiting staff.  Place was awesome when it opened. Clearly bad management has taken its toll."
Frank S.,"Miami, FL",18,27,31,1.0,2/27/2016,"Visited last night with my family for dinner. The wait times were normal for a Friday night in Miami about 35 minutes. We did call ahead to be placed on the wait list however we still had a wait time when we got there. We were escorted to our table 505 and the service clerk was 16 not to blast any names on yelp. The hostess didn't bring us any utensils and gave us two menus just to share between 5 of us. We ordered two appetizers Avocado egg rolls and calamari. The calamari was cooked well however the avocado egg rolls were under cooked and we had to send them back, what a disappointment. For our entree we ordered a clam chowder soup, spaghetti and meatballs and a flat bread cal club. The flat bread which is suppose to contain chicken barely had a 1/4"" of chicken on each slice. The service was blah as we never got a plate to share from our waiter which we asked twice and told him the kids were sharing their plate. Shortly after we ordered our desserts our waiter brought the bill which was rather rude as we weren't even done yet. This was at 8:02PM. 8:15PM rolled by and the desserts were not at our table yet. I asked for a manager and shared our experience up to that point and all he did was go get our desserts and nothing else was done. I am very disappointed with the restaurant and the service over all. Management should really take a look at the staffing and work flow."
Anthony W.,"Hollywood, FL",53,15,1,4.0,11/23/2013,"The food was very good. We got a bad waiter (looks like shaggy from Scooby do). He made a few mistakes but, the bus girl was quick to fix each issue with a great attitude and always smiling. The menu is quite extensive bring your reading glasses :)"
Frank E.,"Miami, FL",73,254,41,2.0,5/20/2013,"Food is great, service is terrible... the waiters/waitresses all look really pissed off all the time, and it seems that they make the bus tables also? which would explain their unhappiness but still... the Doral location everyone was super friendly every time I went, this location, exact opposite... think there is a management issue here"
Maria A.,"Miami, FL",197,377,1064,1.0,8/18/2013,"Went this past weekend as it was a grear place to eat however I no longer agree with my previous review. Server was rude, my appetizer the best beginnings came witgout tge dip, the chips were all small pieces instead of whole ones, my salmon was over cooked, the steamed veggies were tough. Overall a horrible dining experience."
Natasha M.,"Miami, FL",71,206,132,4.0,7/20/2013,"The small bites here are the bomb. The stuffed mushrooms, the caprese salad, the fried artichokes!?!? So 'effin good! The only weird thing is that they sat my friend and I down at a regular table and when we asked what the happy hour specials were, they said we can only get those specials if we sit at the bar. So we moved to the bar. But still, I don't see why the specials can't be served to any other tables that aren't at the bar. Either way, this place is pretty good."
Alejandra A.,"Miami, FL",397,203,74,1.0,4/14/2013,"Here is the thing about customer service...HONESTY..what a concept, and this is something that this place lacks. Ok so I get it, the Heat are playing, its a busy friday night, place is suer crowded and here comes a 15 people party. All I am going to say is that if you cannot accomodate such a large party then just say it, don't keep me waiting for 3 hrs and them give me some BS about ""let me throw something out there"" and that something was like 4 high tops outside that cold not even be put together.. Get a clue on how to be a manager!  Very VERY disapointed on how this was handled, did not even bother to apologize or make it right in ANY way. I have been in the industry before, and this is NOT how you treat a party that is willing to spend serious money.  I doubt I will give this place a shot at all after the bitter taste it left behind...I hope if anyone in upper management sees this, they do something to change this poor excuse of a manager who obviously needs to be re-trained on how to treat customers. Too bad we never got to try the food...who knows how this review would have looked like."
Michelle L.,"Miami, FL",2,4,,1.0,4/11/2013,"This was my second time coming to BJs.  The first time i came with one of my sons for lunch and it was great so I wanted to bring my other boys.   We went tonight 4/11/13. We were seated pretty fast but that is it.  All down hill from there.  Rusty T was  our waiter, he took a while to take our orders so we ordered our drinks and entrees at once.  We received our drinks but our food took about an hour to come out.  Rusty said the manager was to come to our table because of the long wait but he never came. When the Entrees finally came the two burgers were great but the shrimp scampi was very dry and the Jambalaya  tasted like someone dropped the bottle of  paprika in it.   I ordered a second drink that never came.   My boys had to order beers from a different waitress and the restaurant wasn't even that busy.  I was very disappointed with service and the entrees.  To me service is everything..   I don't think the boys and I will be back and I for sure will not recommend any of my patients or friends to come here."
Douglas G.,"Miami, FL",1,32,1,3.0,1/15/2014,Quick to be seated.  Fast service. Good clam chowder. Got a bacon cheeseburger and it was ok but not great. Wedge fries bland. Price about right.
Allison D.,"Miami, FL",291,193,256,2.0,8/11/2014,"I'll start by saying this is the third time I've gone to this restaurant since they opened at The Falls and always on the weekend and my experience has been the same but worsened with time. Besides the funky smell that now  they have when you walk in, tables are kind of dirty with sticky menus. They are understaffed or maybe they simply don't care and you have to wait forever to be helped and to get your food, and god forbid you need something extra cause you might as well get up and get it yourself, the waiters are struggling to keep up but they simply can't, service is absolutely terrible. In my opinion the food is mediocre, to me kind of like supermarket frozen food reheated and decorated, I've tried the chicken wings, fried calamary that where soggy and drenched in oil, Alfredo pasta, cookie dessert, and I don't like any of them....The Beer on the other hand is awesome I always get the sampler so I can have more than one kind of beer, so if you don't like beer and want to go because of the food save your money and go somewhere else, food sucks, service blows."
Miguel S.,"Miami, FL",84,14,49,5.0,4/26/2014,I love this place... rarely any issues with service or order.  Food is amazing as well.   Went Saturday and found thou that the music was very loud.   Odd but that night it was.
Chris C.,"Dallas, TX",161,161,7,5.0,11/10/2013,"Happy Hour during a saturday night football game! What more should I say? I've been to BJ's a bunch of times but this was hands down the best service I ever had. Our waiter was on top of the drinks, very energetic and we were able to enjoy half price apps and drinks at the bar area (not necessarily just the bar). Hello to my new BJ's!"
Adeline B.,"Kendall, FL",30,4,,4.0,9/12/2013,"So I really love BJs brew house. Granted, service isn't the best but whatever. The beer selection is amazing and the food is even better!!!  I will say, however, that the hard liquor drinks always tend to taste a bit.... What's the word I'm looking for? I feel like I get gypped on how much alcohol is in my drink.  The Thai chicken wontons are my favorite and I always tend to get two orders (can you blame me? They're only three! But for $3 bucks I'm not complaining!) Last night wasn't my first night at BJs and it definitely will not be my last."
Roly R.,"Hollywood, FL",0,75,,1.0,3/21/2016,Eaten here 3 times and each time is worse then the last the service is horrible the food is terrible and the bathrooms are disgusting.  Strike 3 close the place down.
Ben S.,"Miami, FL",3,15,2,5.0,1/24/2015,Great brew selection.  Max at the bar treated us like gold.  Food was good bar food. But the 5 stars are earned by the beer selection and the service. Good stuff.
Yury Moisés F.,"Miami, FL",1,7,,3.0,2/22/2015,Food is good. Service is EXTREMELY slow. Portions are way less that what appears in the menu. Could come back if they improve on the speed of the service. Ok for a Sunday lunch meal.
Gaby S.,"Miami, FL",756,328,153,5.0,11/11/2012,"I am definitely pleased to say that bj's is a great addition to the falls. Ive had the pleasure of coming here twice already, they are fairly new and just opened but dont let that fool you. The restaurant is very nice. Great place to watch any upcoming football or basketball games. There are tv's practically everywhere so you dont have to worry about a good seat. Beautiful bar & great service. Ive only come here for appetizers, beer and dessert so i cant review the entrees. The buffalo chicken wontons are delish and so are the avocado eggrolls and spinach dip They have a great beer selection to choose from- try the nutty brunette- very good!  And lets not forget about the dessert. Beignets or the pizookie are both delicious! So save some room for dessert and decided which guilty pleasure you'd rather go for ;) PS- Make sure to sign up for their rewards card if you plan on coming back. You get points for every dollar spent!"
Ari G.,"Pinecrest, FL",0,6,1,1.0,9/23/2015,"Told our server about 5 times we were celebrating a birthday.....we waited.....and waited......, finally decided to walk out, we haven't been to this restaurant in about 6 months because of the service, clearly nothing has changed, will be the last time !!!!"
Jay S.,"Miami, FL",2,23,,2.0,11/18/2012,"Just opened, ordered appetizers came out very quickly. I ordered ""Country Fried CHICKEN Steak"" upon cutting the Chicken Steak I realize there is no ""chicken"" but instead steak. I figured with the word ""Chicken"" in the title of the item it's safe to assume there will be chicken in it, had it simply been called a ""Country Fried Steak"" there would be no issue.  Waiter was very nice and took the item back and I ordered the wings instead, after waiting 30 mins nothing either they forgot place the order or something, but at this point I was annoyed and asked to cancel my order and just get the check.  Waiter told me he would bring me the check we waited almost most 25 mins to get the check and the excuse we get was he needed a manger to remove it.  In my head I'm thinking it shouldn't take that long.   The part that surprised me was when I spoke to a manger passing by our table I asked her why my food was taking so long and rather then addressing or even offering any kind of apology she told me she would get my server, I guess so much for customer service. You would figure with this place newly opened they would at least try to make a better effort.."
Greg B.,"Miami, FL",12,57,21,1.0,10/27/2013,"Food was all wrong manager didn't make it right I will probably not go back...!!! Overlooked my steak. By the time we got the replacement my party was ready to leave. So I had to eat my dish at home.   But that wasn't the part that really pissed me off, when I brought it up to the manager that when I go out to eat I take it serious,  and when I go out to eat it's exactly that to eat OUT, he shrugged it off like it meant nothing!!! I can't find anything that would make me go back!"
