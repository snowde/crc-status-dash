Yohancef C.,"Miami, FL",0,4,13,2.0,12/9/2012,"Slippery floors. Flat beers. Wait staff not up on the menu yet. Food less than amazing (I had pizza, jambalaya, watermelon salad). The best thing was the meatball appetizer, and it was just ok.  Hopefully it's just the growing pains and they will figure out there system soon."
Francesca F.,"Miami, FL",0,2,,3.0,2/15/2016,"I've eaten here at least 5 times. The atmosphere is nice, the food is pretty good, and the servers are usually nice too. I went last night for Valentines day with my boyfriend and we were seated in 15 minutes or less (we called ahead). Our server wasn't very nice or friendly, but she wasn't rude either. She was okay. We had the ahi poke which made my stomach hurt but i didn't want to complain since I already ate almost half of it. The flavor was decent, but I wouldn't order it again. It made my boyfriends throat itch, but that happens when he eats shrimp so I'm  certain that's an allergy problem. We shared the Taverns thin crust pizza, spicy pig but subbed the jalapenos for pepperoncinis. It was good, but it's kind of hard to mess up pizza. Overall It was an okay experience."
Janie L.,"Miami, FL",0,26,1,1.0,3/23/2015,visited this location 2 times and both times I had to return food and had awful service.  The food was very bad and cold.
Vanessa R.,"Cutler Bay, FL",6,7,1,1.0,12/3/2013,"I came to the grand opening of this place and it's a far cry from where it is now. I've been to BJ's up north and loved the chain from day one. This place is an utter mess now.  Specifically their food quality. OMG I loved those potato skins to death, they came out crispy and flakey just amazing! Now they're soggy dripping in grease. The food is bland compared to day one. Specifically the chicken and burger dishes.  The pizzookies are way too under cooked. The place is obviously under staffed.  The place is obnoxiously loud. Turn the music down a bit I would like to hear what my waiter is saying without them yelling over the music. I believe that people would like to socialize at this place without feeling like they're at a club. And here's the real cherry on top. It smells like a sewer towards the back. And it's been that way for a couple months now. That's disgusting period. People don't want to eat where it smells like crap!  Either someone figures out what's going on with those pipes or say good bye to this joint because it ain't going to last."
Kevin F.,"Tallahassee, FL",113,360,212,3.0,1/3/2013,"Food came out fast and was spot on. Service was severely lacking. They were out if every single malt scotch due to the ""holidays"".  Every drink took almost 30 minutes to come out and our server was hard to find."
Liliana E.,"Miami, FL",66,128,129,2.0,12/10/2012,"This place recently opened.  Good menu options and a good selection of beer. It was disappointing that my waitress couldn't find ""mayo"" anywhere.  I'm not sure if she was too lazy to get it from the kitchen or if the mayo was in fact, missing. Who serves burgers and sandwiches and doesn't have mayo? Apparently BJ's Brewhouse."
Ridha A.,"Miami, FL",0,6,,3.0,3/4/2015,"Service was slow and food was cold by the time it got to me both times I went. Waiters make no effort to acknowledge your existence. Would not go there again, not even for the overpriced cookie with ice cram on top."
Faby P.,"Miami, FL",260,502,167,3.0,4/18/2013,"The place is very nice inside. Great bar area, lots of tables, lots of TV's which is nice for a brewhouse since having a cold one is always fun when a game is on. The menu is extensive and everything we ordered was pretty good. Not fantastic, but good. Dessert was also yummy. I was preggo at the time so I wasn't able to try their beers but I plan to go back for that."
TTman F.,"Miami, FL",2,25,4,4.0,9/27/2014,"I went to eat there ona friday with my family. The restaurant was packed but it only took 15 minutes to seat us. We ordered potatoe skins and spinach artichoke dip. The skins were good but some were over cooked. The quantity of the spinach dip with chips was great. My kidshad the regular chicken fingers and grilled cheese sandwich. We really enjoyed the dinner and drinks. The server was attending to several tables, but was very attentive to our table."
Ariadna P.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",12,76,15,4.0,5/10/2013,I love their California flatbread. It is a must!! The overall service is good but a bit slow. I love that they have smaller versions of their dessert.  I will definitely be visiting often.
Adriana J.,"Miami, FL",399,67,5,3.0,2/27/2013,"If you like gambling, check this place out. And no, they don't have poker tables or fancy slot machines. What you're really betting on is whether or not your dish will satisfy or suck. On first impressions, the service was fast and friendly but that might also be because we were there on a Tuesday night-- which was great for us because all wine bottles and glasses were half off. We waited all of 30 seconds to be seated and the decor looked like it took a pointer or two from Cheesecake Factory.  Onto the food! Our avocado egg rolls tasted like they'd soaked in a hot tub of oil all day long. In fact, it kinda tasted like oil used to fry pork...either that or BJ's is the first to engineer meat-flavored avocados. Weird. Next, my sister and I ordered the Maui porkchop which came with green beans and roasted potatoes and the Enlightened Thai Mango Chicken Salad. The salad was hearty and refreshing and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a fun twist on greens...but  the porkchop was bland. Stay away. Unless hospital food is your thing, because that's what it reminded me of.  And then the weird thing is... after a bipolar meal experience, the dessert was awesome! Their White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Pizookie with Vanilla Ice-cream hit the spot! So if you do decide to come here, go with a safe bet... make it a wine and dessert date and maybe skip the food since it can be such a hit-or-miss."
Abigail P.,"Homestead, FL",57,63,24,1.0,5/25/2014,"Honestly the only thing going for this place is their desserts. I have ordered food to pick up and they completely messed up the order. They don't call you if you order take out by the way. The burger was completely soggy. The flatbreads were okay but other than that nothing else was good. I went in to complain to the manager and they wouldn't even give me a refund. They offered me a credit to the place. What makes you think I would ever want to go back when the staff messed up a simple order? My second time going in was even worse, I actually got sick from the food there. Their happy hour specials are good but I'm officially done with this place. Never again."
Evelyn C.,"Miami, FL",2,12,2,1.0,10/12/2013,"I'm not happy with this restaurant. It's loud between the music and the customers, so you can't really hear unless the person raises their voice. The three times I've been to a BJ's has been horrible. Twice I've come with family to this one and my food has been bad. First time, I ordered the Masala and it was very acidic. This time I ordered the salmon and it was burnt. I was only able to eat the rice it came with. I have to say though, the waitress was nice.  This is not a place I will be returning to."
Gabriel P.,"Miami, FL",1,2,,1.0,1/4/2014,"I went to BJ's on a Wednesday for lunch with a few friends. I'd been there before and the service wasn't spectacular, but nothing to complain about. We sat and ordered pretty quickly. The waiter was inattentive from the start (20 minutes wait for a refill on drinks). The next two hours were spent waiting. It seemed like the waiter did not want to be there and really didn't care about getting any sort of gratuity from my friends and I. My fish tacos were cold when they arrived to the table. The final straw was the waiter dropping checks and not leaving any pens once he came back with our cards.  I should mention it was New Year's Day, so probably disregard this."
Tee M.,"Miami, FL",95,249,101,5.0,1/2/2013,"Yo, I'm soooo in love with whomever the bartender is!  My drink was SUPERB!  The food was awesome to me!  I had the avocado egg rolls (all though Cheesecake Factory tastes better), Thai shrimp wraps and the Mahi Mahi tacos. They were all delicious unless I was super hungry.  I did not have to wait long being that I went and sat at a table bar.   This is an official spot for my friend girl and I to meet on Fridays and unwind from the work, kids, stress week lol!  Hopefully I can keep on having good experiences."
Edi B.,"Homestead, FL",6,35,,2.0,8/16/2014,"45 minutes and all we got was 2 beers and a salad, while watching others being served. We ordered a sandwich and an appetizer. The manager was nice enough to apologize and offer to comp our meal (that never came), but it wasn't worth it. Better service at the TGIF across the courtyard."
Kaitlyn M.,"Miami, FL",0,2,2,5.0,1/1/2015,My sung Marcy works there that place is so  SO SO SO SO  SO AWESOME is suggest you everybody out there go to bjs  brew house
Janio V.,"Miami, FL",15,40,,3.0,10/6/2014,"Jeremiah Red... Great beer. Its a strong ale and I really enjoyed it. This is a good enough reason to come back. Also the service was great from our bartender ""Tyrinee"" I think her name was. She was extremely kind and attentive. The food wasnt amazing, I had the fettuccine alfredo which was ok. The beer though....15 dollars for a pitcher of Jeremiah Red which is very strong. I think this reason alone is a good reason to come back."
Kristin M.,"Miami, FL",0,4,4,3.0,12/29/2015,Over all I would rate this place 3 stars. I went with my family and we all got different dishes and they were just okay. Pasta could have came with a bigger portion as the steaks weren't cooked to our liking. Might give this place one more shot.
Kenneth M.,"Miami, FL",2,23,7,5.0,9/21/2014,"I really enjoy coming here, been about 3 times and it's always been really nice, the Inside is nice and always clean plus the bar looks pretty neat all lit up, and the food is always great an they have wedge fries :) service is fast time, can't really complain too much at all, one of my favorite restaurants"
