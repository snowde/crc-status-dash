Sarah K.,"Miami, FL",3,16,5,1.0,9/1/2013,Awful. Food   Service super slow.  My. Third time here  and it doesn't change. I guess that's the definition Of insanity and expecting different results. Order the barbecue and chicken for two and it felt like I was eating cardboard
jen r.,"Miami, FL",312,701,2,2.0,3/22/2013,"we decided to give this bj's a shot after our doral experience left much to be desired. it was meant to be a quick weeknight dinner. that turned into a 2 hour ordeal (against our will). we sat, requested waters while we reviewed menu. a good 10 minutes later, still no water. finally we get our appetizers, and our now empty water glasses are still sitting there. the manager came over to apologize to us and say dessert would be on the house bc of all the delays ( we hadnt even complained but kudos for a manager that actually realizes his restaurants incompetence).  our food came out and was just ok, we all had sandwiches which were nothing special and the fries were just alright, actually room temp not freshly fried.  the waitress was sweet but aloof and didnt really become chatty or attentive till she brought dessert, coincidence thats right before the check and tip time. ps - the restaurant was freezing, seriously it was bordeline miserable, so make sure you have a jacket."
Valerie A.,"Hallandale, FL",2,19,3,1.0,2/21/2015,"My family and I live in West Palm Beach and have always wanted to try the BJs near home. Upon visiting The Falls, we decided to give this location a shot. Big mistake. The server got our drinks wrong first. Then we ordered the potato skins appetizer, which was horrible. It was potato halves with cheese, bacon, and chives, except it was deep fried and lacked flavor or seasoning, yuck! Then our meals came. My husband ordered the Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos, which he said were bland and just didn't have that ""umph"". I ordered the Shrimp Scampi Pasta, which tasted horrible! When you think shrimp scampi, you think lots of flavor. This tasted like shrimp sautéed in dish water placed atop angel hair pasta. Not even salt and pepper could help this dish. I sent it back and asked for a burger and fries instead. My replacement meal tasted average. Even our two children didn't finish their meals (two mini burgers with fries and chicken tenders with fries respectively). The chicken tenders had too much batter and the mini burgers were dry. This was a horrible experience for my family. Do yourself a favor, go to TGI Fridays across the walkway instead of this place. You'll thank me later."
Gina B.,"Miami, FL",0,6,,1.0,6/18/2015,"Yelp- it's time to add a 'zero' star rating. One star is entirely too generous for this restaurant.... It's been 5 months since my last visit, and boy did BJ's live up to their reputation!  I reluctantly accompanied a group of friends for dinner tonight. I was initially relieved that most of the tables were unoccupied...they weren't busy, so the service would definitely be better, right? Wrong.   You can put lipstick on a pig, but in the end, it's still a pig.  This restaurant looks nice on the outside and has a decent selection at the bar.....but that's where it ends.  We waited 25 minutes for a server to bring water and take our order...45 minutes later, our salads arrived....we didn't see our server again for about 30 minutes after we finished our meals. A mediocre salad and a glass of wine in 21/2 hours...really?.   During this time, we watched the servers ignore 2 groups - both of which were seated in booths near the restrooms. The first family was seated and handed menus- they got up and left the restaurant when no one approached them to even offer water after almost 30 minutes.  The second table received water upon being seated, 35 minutes later, they were still without a server and we were still waiting for our change...... Disgraceful."
Kiki B.,"Greenville, SC",196,135,48,3.0,7/7/2013,"The food we had was very good.  The baby back ribs were plentiful and tasty.  The Balsamic Chicken was also very tasty, though for sure it could have used much more of the balsamic sauce and the serving was pretty small.  The Corn Fritters with Bacon Aioli were Amazing.  Service, to be totally honest, was pretty bad.  Very slow.  The noise level was the loudest I've ever heard in a restaurant."
Oscar M.,"Miami, FL",46,11,,3.0,4/13/2013,"It's a popular spot and the place is nice, I'm just not really much of a fan. The service is good, I'm just not too crazy about the food. You should definitely give a Pizookie a try though."
Jenna M.,"Miami Beach, FL",63,219,13,2.0,10/21/2013,"There is nothing special about the food at BJ's and after waiting 45 minutes + on the weekend for a table, your taste buds need to be satisfied. Disappointing blackened salmon salad of some sort is what I ended up with. Couldn't even take a second bite it was so bad. My husband and my dad seemed to be OK with their food. But it was nothing spectacular."
Erik W.,"Doral, FL",15,3,,2.0,1/2/2013,"Slooow service, incorrect orders, lackluster food and didn't have the beer i wanted. The one in Doral was better. Someone fix this place because It has potential!"
Charity Z.,"Miami, FL",204,147,863,3.0,9/11/2013,"food is good,  had the California club flat bread and that was pretty good, service is a bit slow, but overall its a cool place to go for dinner with the family."
Erin A.,"Miami, FL",0,5,,4.0,5/27/2015,"Definitely a fan of bj's, always have a good time and the drinks are the bomb diggity! (:"
David O.,"Athens, GA",89,193,79,4.0,12/20/2013,"Service is hit or miss, especially If you sit on the patio. I do like this place though, food is decent but the drafts could be a little cooler."
MaryJo M.,"Miami, FL",1,3,3,1.0,1/21/2013,"Two thumbs down: now a days in a world of rich free mass media, shame on BJs for not providing free WiFi ."
Joel S.,"Miami, FL",24,103,3,1.0,11/21/2012,Well I can add another place to the list of places I never need to visit again.  That is probably pretty harsh but what I got today was inedible.  Their menu is HUGE so maybe I am being unfair but it seemed like generic bar food and thats not my favorite anyway.  I got their version of a patty melt I guess with a veggie burger.  I would tell you how it was but all I could taste was butter.  The bread must have been soaked in butter that I literally couldn't taste anything else.  The skinny fries were pretty good but the butter sandwich was awful.  I am imagining that is probably their MO for most dishes - butter and/or salt.  No thanks.  The beer selection looked good - thats about it though.
Arek G.,"Miami, FL",12,11,68,3.0,4/28/2013,Good and friendly customer service.  Great beer selection and appetizers were ok.  Main entrees left much to be desired.
Reg F.,"Miami, FL",0,12,,2.0,2/22/2013,"Dined on Sat Feb 16 2013.  First, the mgr was VERY accomodating. We were a party of 10, and he seated us in under an hour.   Menu is similar to cheesecake factory, so it takes a while. If you are a foodie like me..read it prior so it doesnt take you 20 min to decide. :)  ok, now food. Had he thai shrimp lettuce wraps.they were good. My friends ordered chicken, no biggie, PF CHhangs much better. Ordered a cheeseburger. Came out with no cheese at first, and came back very very dry. no flavor. Fries are thin and good. Some of friends had cold fries.  Other items ordered was steak- dry.  tilapia- very good.  Overall, i was disapointed.  Service was very slow.  Prices are decent however. I would go again, but order a bit differently.  I think the kitchen is not prepared on the weekends for the mass of people that come out.  No recession in restaurants for sure!"
Martha M.,"Miami, FL",2,6,,2.0,7/1/2014,"BJ's is essentially an over priced Chili's, or TGI Friday's. The restaurant is big, and the bar looks fabulous. The service was good. I went on a Friday night after seeing a movie at The Falls movie theater. The ladies at the hostess desk were not very welcoming and were more interested in having their own private conversation. Although it was a Friday night, we were seated right away. I ordered the shrimp pasta. I figured you can not go wrong with pasta. Well I was wrong, there was so much oil in the pasta, you could see a pool of oil at the bottom of the plate, and they put melted cheese on top, it looked like a big glob of pasta. I guess I did not fully read the description following the item on the menu, where they mentioned cheese...I have to say that the portion was huge. I only was able to eat about a quarter of it, before I was full. My husband ordered the parmesan encrusted chicken, with mash potatoes. He said both the chicken, and the mash potatoes were bland. I was debating whether to order any of their ""brews"", but decided not too, since it was already past my bed time!! For about 6 dollars they have a small sample of five of their beers, which I will try next time. I do think I will be back to BJ's, but next time I will stick to a burger or pizza, and try some of their beer! As for the dinner menu, I think I will pass..."
Sue S.,"Miami, FL",59,66,50,5.0,6/8/2013,"I have been here a couple of times and have never had a bad experience. My waiter was Eddie. He was helpful, attentive and very friendly. The food came out quickly, no complaints. I highly recommend the Pizzokie dessert. yummy!"
Patty F.,"Miami, FL",5,20,,4.0,6/12/2013,"California club flatbread is a must have.  My husband and I shared the New Orleans Jambalaya and it was delicious, we love spicy food and it was perfect, even broke a small sweat!!"
Rachel P.,"Ponte Vedra Beach, FL",63,398,23,3.0,2/17/2013,"Can't get over the awful reviews, really is it that bad? My friend and I met up today and she chose to meet here. I had the soup/salad combo and flatbread and everything was pretty good. It is a chain, so I would compare it to the quality of Chilis/Cheesecake Factory. The restrooms were very modern and clean, everyone was also very friendly, and the service was fine. It's worth giving it a shot for lunch."
Lissette M.,"Miami, FL",53,2,,1.0,5/31/2014,"My boyfriend and I had been here once before, and other than having a bit of a clueless waiter, our experience was fairly pleasant. However, this time around, our experience was anything but pleasant. We went with a friend to watch a Heat game last night, and we were unhappy at being seated outside without being told that the outdoor TVs had no volume. We were obviously there to watch a Heat playoff game, and should have been advised of the volume issue. Every other restaurant I've been to has had no problem accommodating the customer when unhappy with their table and has done everything possible to resolve the issue. However, the hostesses and manager here, I believe his name was Pierre or something to that effect, were completely useless. Even though there was an empty booth, they refused to move us to it and wanted to put us back on a ridiculously long waiting list. It would have been simple for them to move us to the indoor booth and place the next person on the list at our previous table, seeing as how we were there first. However, this was apparently too much to ask. While I admit to becoming agitated and using a cuss word or two toward the sorry excuse for a manager, it shouldn't have had to escalate to that point, because our request should have been properly and quickly handled. The manager even threatened to ask me to leave, so I did. We went next door to Friday's. Even though we had been on their list earlier and left to BJ's, the hostesses at Friday's were wonderful and quickly accommodating. They promptly found us a table where we were able to enjoy the food and the game. What a difference! Needless to say, with so many better dining options with much better service in the area, I will never set foot into BJ's again. All I can say is learn how to treat your customers! Wish I could give this place zero stars."
