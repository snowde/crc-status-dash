Matthew O.,"Bryce, UT",30,265,11,3.0,12/3/2012,"This is the second BJ's Brewhouse I have been to.  I don't think it has been open very long and it kind of shows.  The wait staff and servers all seem a little green. The concept is good though, they take the best ideas from pizza hut and the Cheesecake Factory and add beer.  I think this location will get better after a little time passes and the staff finds their groove."
Rafael C.,"Celebration, FL",11,36,4,3.0,3/22/2013,"I guess I had higher expectations, but food was just OK.  service reeeaaally slow.  There are better places for bar food than this.  Noise level really high also."
Daniel C.,"Miami, FL",402,13,2,3.0,1/13/2013,"Really noisy, but pretty damn good food, (and beer).  Sitting outside is the way to go."
Dorian W.,"Providence, RI",8,22,4,4.0,3/11/2013,"Great ambiance and TVs everywhere. Didn't get to try much of the food or drinks because i was in recovery mode but from what my company said, food was really good"
Max T.,"Miami, FL",25,144,20,3.0,11/19/2012,"I went the first week they opened. The burgers came out cooked perfectly; service was Hit and miss in my two visits. The crafted beer tasted good, but needs to be served much colder. This is not England, serve the darn thing just shy of freezing. The food was good, they had about 100 waiters in training, so I will cut them some slack. Plenty of TVs; the prices were similar to TGIF, so it should bankrupt the TGIF located ten steps away."
Green L.,"Homestead, FL",1,117,,2.0,6/19/2013,"The service sucked, the only reason its not getting one star was because the food was pretty good and the pizzookie was awesome, I also felt it was the food was overpriced, considering the service sucked so much....."
Ivan G.,"Miami, FL",0,4,,4.0,4/7/2014,great place and chill atmosphere for a college student went on monday and sat at the bar and had 5 dollar mojitos and just chilled with friends great price and bartender was mad cool
Elba D.,"Miami, FL",3,13,,4.0,3/17/2013,"Great food, great ambiance, tasty cocktails. I went on a Thursday evening and it was packed, which explains the noise level. it was very loud. I could barely hear what my date was saying. The best thing on their menu is The Pazookie Trio. HEAVENLY is all I can say."
Paulinacasado O.,"Miami, FL",95,13,3,4.0,2/28/2013,Cant be beat happy hour! Sign up for the card and servers know your name and faves before you sit down. Insta grat! Buff chick pan pizza insane- add jalapenos. So good...
Ivette R.,"Miami, FL",268,1047,251,3.0,6/10/2013,"When I went to the BJ's Brewhouse at the falls we waited for 20 minutes. then we sat down and got our drinks and ordered our food.  We got a sampler appetizer which had artichoke dip with chips, mozzarella sticks, avocado eggrolls and the south western eggrolls.  The appetizer was good but my mom thought it was   dad thought it was good too.  I ordered an individual sausage pizza and my dad had the pot roast   mom had the mushroom appetizer with macaroni and cheese.  I loved my pizza, my dad loved the pot roast sandwich, but my mom was not happy with all the food she ate.  The food there was good but the service was terrible my mom and dad had to wait for a long time to get their drinks.  Our waitress should've done a better job of making sure we were happy.  Overall I'd give it three stars because the food was good but the service was bad."
Lizzie I.,"Miami, FL",170,5,,1.0,4/15/2013,"Slow service, I had the BBQ chicken pizza and it was terrible . Worst thing I've ever had. I wouldn't feed it to my dog. Never going back"
Henry S.,"Miami, FL",0,76,,1.0,11/28/2012,"The service we experienced was completely unacceptable. One of the servers (not our waiter) spilled a bowl of soup between us and the people seated next to us and didn't so much as say sorry. When he later returned with another bowl, he blamed us for the spill. The other servers heard what this jerk said and mentioned it to the manager who finally came over to apologize when we were finished with our meal. It also took a long time before anyone cleaned up the spill.  To top it off, the service was slow and the food was mediocre.  At least the beer was cold, so one star  for that.   All in all, it's a typical chain restaurant. Go elsewhere."
Ricardo C.,"Miami, FL",0,12,9,2.0,1/4/2014,"Best part was our party of 7 was seated within 15 minutes of reservation time. From there on was downhill experience.  Shocked that in a Brewhouse they were out of our beer of choice (Stella!!).  Ordered a bottle of wine and server brought hot glasses. I asked and they had just come out of the washing machine. Waiter said no problem that wine would not heat up too much. I asked for cold glasses and he put ice in them which was good but glasses came full of water from melted ice which we had to pour out. On the food side calamari was ok. Main courses were average at best. Baby back ribs were good but baked potato was tiny and almost no toppings even though we asked for loaded. Steak was cooked right but white cheddar potatoes tasted like pre-frozen and heated. Cheeseburger was missing cheese and we sent back...came with a small patch of cheese in center of bun, most places at least try to have cheese size of burger patty. Pizza was good but toppings were tiny.  Pizookie was yummy but small. All in all probably will never go back since bill was ~$200 even sharing one main course. For sure there are much better options to spend that kind of money and get decent food and drinks."
Sarah C.,"Miami Beach, FL",0,34,,5.0,6/10/2014,"Shocked about all the bad reviews, I love this place! Good food (it's accurately described on the menu), friendly service, and good happy hour."
Blake B.,"Palmetto Bay, FL",0,3,2,4.0,1/23/2013,"Pretty good food, especially the homemade soda, only problem is that it took 45 minutes to get a table and when we did the service was pretty lousy. But overall pretty good food."
Tony I.,"Miami, FL",93,31,1,1.0,4/11/2014,"Be careful where they seat you when you go for happy hour, they will try to seat you anywhere but he bar area, because apparently that's the only area that there is a happy hour even though no one bothers to tell you that little bit of information. And the manager there will tell you "" sorry that's the rules"" GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE"
Angel D.,"Miami, FL",2,47,2,1.0,5/31/2013,"Terribly, terrible poor, POOR service!!!! It is sooooo bad!!!!"
Vanessa V.,"Miami, FL",46,2,,3.0,12/2/2012,"This place is a must-try during NFL sporting games. Not only are all appetizers half off, but cocktails, beer, and wine are discounted all throughout the games as well. Their NFL happy hour make for quite the Sunday Funday, making it a great option for those of us who just weren't able to make it out in time for a Sunday Brunch. I recommend the chicken lettuce wraps and Asian dumplings."
Jacqui Q.,"Denver West, CO",0,65,,2.0,7/7/2013,Service was very poor. Servers continued to try and give me other people's food. Saw it happen several times to others. It's like no one knows table numbers or anything. I sat and watched the family next  to me not get greeted for 15 mins. Mgr came over finally but didnt offer them anything for it. I don't think ill be back as its kinda pricey.
Allison M.,"Miami, FL",0,17,,2.0,2/21/2013,"Beer is good+, everything else was average. Spinach stuffed mushrooms were mush and a little cold. The chili burger was monstrous and good, but average tasting chili... Nothing special. Thin French fries were good, with the beef slider appetizer (which came with basically no grilled onions on it). Probably won't be going back there for anything other than alcohol."
