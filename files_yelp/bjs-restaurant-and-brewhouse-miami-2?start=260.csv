Juan Pablo J.,"Miami, FL",0,2,,1.0,6/16/2013,"Service is horrendous.  Got out chips and salsa and kids dishes.  Entrees took over 50 minutes. We ended up canceling the entrees because the kids were done eating. Manager did not comp us and we had to have a fast food dinner at the crepe place while the kids were eating ice cream. I know its Miami and service is bad, but BJs takes it to a new level.  They need to fire the manager and bring some one from Tampa. He was more concerned about talking to the girls in the front then checking on his customers."
Sally F.,"Miami, FL",4,4,2,1.0,1/4/2013,"Not impressed at all. Too much hype about this place. They don't take reservations and we called ahead to be put on the list for our party of 8, as suggested by the website, left on hold for 15 minutes. When we got to the place, young 20 something hostesses don't acknowledge you and even worse said that our name wasn't on the list, after being on hold forever. Good thing I got the name of the person I was talking to that took my name. Finally shown to our table after having to talk a manager because of the screw up. Nothing more than I hate when they have to apologize for their staff, don't apologize just fix it. I guess we weren't the only one upset with our evening there, another customer was yelling at another manager for being charged for something they didn't order and then being double charged for drinks. Food was ok, would have been better off at TGIFridays next door. I wouldn't suggest coming here unless you're willing to pay for incompetence."
Chris D.,"Miami, FL",0,4,,1.0,2/5/2013,"I usually never write a bad review but had to chime in on the terrible service and food.  Went on a week night had to wait 40 minutes for table went to ladies room at 7pm and not a single stall had toilet paper, rest room was dirty that should of been the first red flag.  Took 20 minutes for waiter another 30  to just get our drinks.  Finally got less than medicore appetizers.  I swear the food came from bjs wholesale warehouse.  Finally go I dinner an hour later the deep dish pizza was pure mush regular pizza worse than a frozen box pizza pork chops were the size of a 50 cent piece green beans shriveled mess my order had wrong potatoes so waiter said go ahead and have those for free and we will replace with right order, shocker they never brought right ones.  We certainly didn't even want it box up our uneaten meals.  Management has a definite problem.  Don't waste your time or money here for sure."
Natalie S.,"Miami, FL",0,9,2,2.0,4/24/2014,"I've been here before the food is good, but the service is mediocre at best. this time in particular the service was worse than ever possibly due to the inexperienced server  we arrived here at 6:54 PM it is not 8:05 PM and we have yet to receive are entrees.  The manager, Prince was helpful and was able to get our order straight after the server failed to even put it in :("
Karen E.,"Homestead, FL",0,11,,2.0,4/24/2014,"Went in to watch the Heat Game, surprisingly the bar wasn't crowded but all seats were taken.  Actually I was surprised at how much room was at the bar, it didn't seem like all the chairs were there.  Anywhat we just ordered some apps and drinks, it took 10 min to get acknowledged another 5 to place an order.  2 bartenders and they didn't seem slammed even from table service.  Took about 20 minutes to get our apps and was never asked if we wanted another drink, we actually had to flag her down to get one.  Once we saw it was half time & realized she just took our empty glasses without asking if we'd want another, we decided to cash out and drink at home.  And when she took our order, we said are you sure you don't want to write this down...she said no I got it.  She came back 2 times to be reminded of what we had.  As for the apps, they were good..but it was fried apps, hard to go wrong."
Fines H.,"Miami, FL",0,2,,1.0,1/21/2013,"Came here twice.  Service provided was slow, the 2nd time we came it took for our server Christy to get our order. She did not even bother to ask how's our food, and took forever to take my order for desert so I decided not to get the desert and just asked for the check. The check included charges that we did not order. She did not bother to apologize for bad service or for the mistake made on the check. Bad service and rude server."
Ed H.,"Miami, FL",0,4,,1.0,12/16/2012,"I love the BJ's in Orlando and Pembroke Pines, but this location has consistently bad service. Food is OK, but always comes out cold. Staff seem out of it. They just don't seem focused, and don't seem to care. They stop by once in a while to let you know that the food is ""almost ready"", and the manager stops by to apologize for the delay. They seem to know they have continually bad service, but don't seem to be at all interested in doing anything about it. Stick with one of the other locations and avoid this one."
Cathy C.,"Miami, FL",1,9,1,3.0,11/16/2012,They just opened so we'll give them another chance.  The house beer was excellent and the service was very good.  The food was meh however and the noise level was uncomfortably loud.  The acoustics are so bad that everyone in the packed place is yelling which perpetuates the problem.
Bryant F.,"Miami, FL",33,19,11,1.0,8/21/2013,"I've been twice to this restaurant twice and the service was terrible.  I will only speak about my recent visit since it was their ""second chance"".  We were greeted and seated immediately which was probably the one highlight of the evening. Problem #1 After waiting 20 minutes, I had to find a waitress just to take our drink order.  Our drink order came quickly but once again, we had to find our waitress once again to check on our appetizer.  Apparently, socializing with her friends was more important than customer service.   25 minutes later, our appetizer came with an excuse....the cooks ""screwed up"" the order and to ""be careful because the food is really hot"".  I found this rather funny because the food had obviously been sitting under a hot lamp for quite some time.   The appetizer was cold and no sooner when we picked up our forks, the entree came.  It doesn't take a genius to figure out that the mistake was not the cooks but our server.  We complained to the manager that our appetizer was cold and we were promised that it would be taken off the bill and a fresh appetizer would be out in 5 minutes.  Some people have no concept of time and 27 minutes later, we received our appetizer.  On a positive note, the burgers that we did order were much improved from the first visit, and the appetizer was not charged to our bill.  I almost forgot, don't go expecting a refill on your drink.  Not once did the waitress ask if we needed one."
Cathy F.,"Homestead, FL",2,11,7,1.0,7/10/2013,"My husband and I have eaten here a few times, trying to give it the best possible chance. Yesterday was the last time. I ordered the lunch chicken tacos and when I bit into it there was a rather large piece of plastic in it. Our waiter was very apologetic and said the manager would be right over. Well that never happened he did not see fit to take two seconds to offer and apology or ask if I would like something else. This manager just threw his waiter under the bus. I am not sure who the idiot was that hired the manager but they both need to be replaced. This place has great beer, and good ambiance and  it will be sad to see it go, but unless some changes are made in management that is in its future."
Rick M.,"Miami, FL",6,22,9,1.0,6/8/2013,"POOR POOR POOR SERVICE.I have been here 4 times, each time hoping it gets even a little bit better, but alas I guess it was not to be, first of all the wait is always crazy,  over 20 minutes each time, even if no one is waiting ahead of me, I got frustrated 1 time and asked who else are you sitting ahead of me, because I am the only one party here, they just shrugged their shoulders and said we are very busy, I looked at them like they were crazy, the waiters and waitresses were just  standing around talking and laughing. My 2nd time our waitress had an attitude and threw us our menus, when I asked what is good here, she said certainly not the tips, and walked away mumbling to herself, we then did not get attended for another 15 minutes till we complained, we got another server, I guess she just quit. On my 3rd attempt, there were people complaining that they had been sitting for over 35 minutes with service at their table, I told them , I knew exactly what they were going through, they waited another 5 minutes, got pissed, got up and left. I was with my jaw opened . no one even came to the table to clean it, 10 minutes later they sat someone else at the same table. My wife went yesterday with a party of 6 girls, there was plenty of tables inside, she said first available so they sat them outside, my wife said why are you sitting me outside it there are so many tables inside open, once again the shrug of the shoulders and out they went,  then the waitress comes out and says, wow, it is so hot out here, and walks away from them and does not bring them any water or utensils, she then avoided going outside for over 10 minutes, before my wife had to go in and ask for water from someone else, ridiculous, I do not know if this is corporate owned or owned by someone, regardless , get the hint, read your reviews, little to your gripping clients, your servers and managers - are HORRIBLE, and do not have a clue what they are doing. The food is meh at best, I can go to Fridays next door get the same food, but at least get better service. If you are in the falls, the place may look really nice from the outside, but spare yourselves, the lack of service, and poor management will have you out of there quickly."
Arlene P.,"Miami, FL",3,33,11,1.0,4/12/2013,"Once again disappointed with this establishment. Went yesterday 4/11/13,  I thought that I would give this place one more try but I should have just stuck with my gut feeling. The service was once again very slow. Drinks were ordered and we had to remind the waiter that we did not receive them. Refills of soda or water were never brought out when our cups went empty. After waiting forever for our food, everybody's plate which ranged from pasta, meats, seafood... was just mediocre. The steak tasted burnt and bitter, the seafood did not seem fresh, the pasta had no seasoning. Finally we get to dessert, ordering one of their famous pzookies.  The order was brought out wrong. The waiter who had not been by our table, was told by another employee that we had the wrong order.  He came by and said that he would have to call the manager. We once again waited. When the manager came out he was very apologetic and offered dessert on him (which he did take off the bill) but the damage was done.   We were just so disappointed that we had just spent over $130 on a meal that could have been served at a dinner for half the price."
Astrid S.,"Coral Gables, FL",0,1,,1.0,1/4/2014,"Horrible service. Food - whatever. Our server took 20 minutes to get our water, even after we asked him. Plus he messed up with the checks multiple times. I wish we had gone anywhere else. The food is whatever for the price, I'd say spend your money at the bakery down the street. It was also really cold inside."
Bob S.,"Miami, FL",0,17,,2.0,10/18/2013,Nice place inside but service is very hit/miss. And after 3 visits and 3 different food choices none of it was particularly good.   Wont be going back.
Julianne M.,"Miami, FL",1,22,2,2.0,3/13/2013,"Went two weeks ago on a Sunday night. After an 1.5 hour wait time just to sit a party of 5, the last thing we wanted was extremely slow service. Our food all came out at different times, we had ordered a small deep dish pizza (which is not a deep dish at all)..they tell us they only have medium after 20 min of waiting for the pizza. Everyone at our table had finished their meal, it was almost 10pm at this point and my family member was just sitting waiting for his pizza- with no explanation or apology or some sort of solution from the waiter. We end up asking for the manager, who took a while to appear at our table and he peronsally brings out 3 small pizza's after they had even mentioned there were no smalls and 40 min after everyone was done with their meal. The manager comped the pizza and apologized but not sure that i'll be returning any time soon. I'm definitely looking forward to Brio opening up and hopefully their service and staff competence will be much better."
Justin A.,"Miami, FL",0,2,,5.0,5/12/2013,Wood Grilled Turkey Burger is SO DAMN GOOOD!!!! so was the patato wedges and sauce on the side.. one of the best burgers ive had at a restaurant. Bar is really nice too.
Andrea C.,"Miami, FL",1,22,,4.0,11/28/2012,"Very good service and food.  Had the turkey Cobb sandwiche w/ New England clam chowder.  Fresh, ample, and tasty.  Choice of fries also came.  Price was very reasonable.  Friend was pleased w/ her sandwich.  Waiter was friendly.  Will go again next week."
