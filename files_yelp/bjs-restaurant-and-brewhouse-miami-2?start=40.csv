Mauricio V.,"Miami, FL",68,98,48,4.0,4/18/2016,The mahi mahi tacos here are delectable. Scratch that! BEST FISH TACOS IN MIAMI! The Tatonka stout is delicious. The Jeremiah Red isn't bad. The ziti deep dish is yummy. The service after paying the tab (asking for a glass of water)? Not so much.
Katelin K.,"Miami, FL",10,54,131,2.0,10/7/2016,"I went to BJ's this week because I was craving a beer. As far as beer goes they have a great selection to choose from along with a fun atmosphere, great for watching a game, or enjoying happy hour with friends. The food department doesn't come close. Do not order steak!!! I ordered a steak and it was awful. I guess it was my fault for thinking it would be a good choice here but it was dry, over cooked, and tasted like it had been sitting out all day. I'm guessing that the bar food would have been a better choice. Our service was excellent but I chose to give this location two stars because if they have something on the menu it shouldn't be awful."
Suley T.,"Palmetto Bay, FL",258,87,430,1.0,2/2/2016,I came here on lunch break around 1ish with my boss after visiting my locations at the Falls. It seemed like a great idea because of so many options on the menu- anything from lunch/ GF/ vegan/ comfort food ect options.  I ordered the roasted chicken quinoa bowl which included spinach and tomatoes.  Let me start by saying first that the restaurant was almost empty and it looked like plenty of of staff. The food took almost 40 mins to come out and was overpowered with seasoning. I couldn't find a waitress to refill my water for that entire timeframe either. I have tried to give this place a chance about 3 times and I have gotten the same results each time- never enjoying my food and getting frustrated with the service. I will not return to this chain again.
Zaina M.,"Metairie, LA",2,37,48,1.0,2/26/2017,"I've been to this BJ's multiple times. We drove from Brickell to come to this location and had horrible service. Our waitress was extremely rude. We came in for pizookies and though we got them for free for being a loyal reward member we planned on tipping her for the service. When Sandee brought our cups to the table she slammed the cups on the table, didn't smile, interact, or acknowledge us when thanked. We tried to be understanding thinking she's having a bad day but we overheard her talking about our table receiving free pizookies. The point of being a loyalty member is for these types of perks. I won't be visiting this location again. Even with the bad service we still tipped her. Hope Sandee has a better night"
Ho J.,"Miami, FL",0,92,6,1.0,2/26/2017,The TVs are big and good for football. The food is gross. They have a huge menu book with nothing good in it.  Everything I've eaten there is gross. How is that possible?
cristina b.,"Miami, FL",160,138,451,3.0,1/26/2016,"Ok, so my experience with this place was not out of this world but it was not as bad as some of the reviews that are written here.  I went with my daughter (can't remember if it was a Tuesday or Wednesday night) the place was pretty empty and we were seated very quickly.  My daughter ordered the kids chicken tenders and I ordered the mahi tacos and brussels sprouts as an appetizer. The brussels sprouts never came but I was pretty full with the entrée itself. The food was not spectacular but it was fresh, flavorful and well portioned.  I can't complain about service as our server was excellent, knowledgable about the menu, friendly, and attentive. He was very apologetic about the missing appetizer and did credit it back onto my tab but I was left with the curiosity of how they would taste. It is not everywhere that they offer brussels sprouts on the menu.  I will probably try this place again just to try something different from the menu but with so many other options nearby, don't think I would wait more than 15 minutes to eat here."
Tanya B.,"Homestead, FL",35,44,25,5.0,10/1/2016,"Walked in before the rush. Was able to order and eat while watching my Canes play!!!! Being that this is one of my all time favorite places to eat, it was an obvious choice and a winning one all around!! Had the tacos, which were delish. Alex, my awesome server, helped me pick them. Finished it all off with the trio mini pazookies. (Chocolate chip, Cookies and Creme, and Monkey Bread) They were great, but there should be a law against the Monkey Bread Pazookie!!! Totally enjoyed my visit, which ended up being one of the highlights of this weekend!!  By the way, not a side note, ALEX WAS AWESOME!!! She is definitely one of the best servers that I have had here."
James B.,"Miami, FL",150,163,335,4.0,4/2/2015,"I've been to BJ's 3 times. My last meal was last night. I have to say that i've had a positive experience every time i've gone, though I have heard a few mixed reviews from friends and family members. The times i've gone, service was always attentive and on point. The atmosphere is always vibrant and their bar scene is very active.  I've had their pizzas twice, deep dish. Last night I had the BJ's Favorite. The pizzas are alright. I would rate the pizzas 3 out of 5. They're average. They are not bad but they aren't anything special to write home about. If you want good deep dish pizzas, go to Manhattan Chicago Pizza in Pinecrest.  We also ordered the deep dish lasagna, and I was pleasantly surprised by this dish. I would definitely order this again and highly recommend it. The lasagna had a cheesy top layer of mozzarella. It was light on the meat, but it had plenty of ricotta. It had very rich flavors and I was happy with the portion.  I would give it a 5 out of 5.  Their pizookies are always amazing. My favorite is the white chocolate macadamia nut but they're all frickin good. I order these every time.  In the past I've ordered the New Orleans Jambalaya and it was tasty. I would recommend this dish and give it a 4 out of 5 rating.  My dad has ordered the cherry chipotle glazed salmon with couscous the last two times he's been at BJ's. So that's a good sign.  Also, i'm a huge fan of their craft cherry soda.  Overall experience at BJ's has always been a positive one. I see many negative reviews, but i've been fortunate to not have experienced any negatives."
Paul W.,"Miami, FL",876,1200,548,4.0,11/18/2015,"Wow, I'm surprised that the overall rating of this restaurant is so low! (2.5 overall stars as of this writing).  On the night I came here with a friend for dinner, we were pretty happy with everything. We came here on a Thursday night for a late dinner, were seated right away, and our server was spot on and very attentive throughout the meal.  We both ordered steaks (which were a touch on the spicy side), I ordered the mozzarella and tomato salad and fries, my friend had the broccoli and mashed potatoes and both of us were happy with our meals and with our steaks, and we're people who dine at better steakhouses like Graziano's on a semi-regular basis. This place has lots of TVs for watching sports and other programming, has a decent beer and drinks menu and a food menu that offers something to satisfy nearly everyone. I'd previously visited the BJ's location in Vegas a few years ago before this chain had any locations in S. Florida and am happy to see they've since opened a few restaurants in our area.   Buddy and I split the bill evenly, it came to $27 each before gratuity."
Tricia K.,"Miami, FL",165,478,683,3.0,8/7/2016,"Convenient location at the Falls.  A good place to eat before or after the movies.  There was no wait for a table and we got our food relatively quickly.  We ordered the crispy calamari, the spinach artichoke dip, a flat bread pizza, a soup, a BBQ chicken deep dish pizza and 3 mini pizookies (cookies & cream, chocolate chip & macadamia nut).  The crispy calamari & the pizookies were my favorite.  Danny, our server, was cool.  Great place for happy hour as they have a nice drink selection."
Gess G.,"Miami, FL",22,10,,5.0,3/29/2017,Rebecca was excellent!! Couldn't ask for a better waitress. So attentive and welcoming
Claudia D.,"Miami, FL",41,11,70,4.0,8/22/2016,I had grilled salmon over a bed of quinoa and vegetable. I really like it. Very well cook.
Rabia J.,"Sacramento, CA",2,2,,1.0,2/26/2017,"I'll keep this short and sweet. I redeemed my free mini pizookie and Sandee was my waitress. Sandee was rude, refused to smile, and was clearly smiling at other tables/customers. I would not recommend this location to others, and whether your table is redeeming meals for free or spending $600, stand out employees treat all customers with the same respect and attention. I hope Sandee has a better day tomorrow."
Kemal K.,"Miami, FL",152,126,298,5.0,11/16/2015,"It may be in a mall atmosphere but the restaurant is very up scaled with a reasonably priced menu. Came here for lunch,the jalapeño burger is to die for. If you enjoy a sports bar with an up scaled restaurant twist,this place is where you want to be! Great lunch specials."
Crystal G.,"Miami, FL",3,96,,5.0,1/5/2017,"Great service, great food, nice venue. Definitely recommend the salted caramel pizcookie, absolutely delicious."
Candice C.,"Miami, FL",1,32,6,5.0,7/8/2016,The dessert is to die for! The monkey bread was amazing. Our server was the wonderful. I will ask for him the next time we come back. Thanks Christopher for making our first time at BJ's memorable!  I think I might skip dinner just to have dessert.
Deborah V.,"Miami, FL",0,4,11,5.0,2/4/2017,"I am a regular here. They offer the BEST service & excellent variety of food and drink. The staff is awesome. I have had the pleasure of meeting some great servers, which include, Lynda, Eddie, Danny, Ronny, Cricket, Victoria, & Darian. Always appreciate the friendly and attentive service."
Emily S.,"Miami, FL",1,22,,4.0,2/20/2017,"I feel like this place is always consistent. The food and drink is pretty quality for a chain. The handcrafted sodas are delicious, and the pizookies are a must. Everything else is pretty standard"
Hilda H.,"Miami, FL",570,339,7455,2.0,5/1/2014,"They get a full FIVE STAR for service, I left y key and the manager was very friendly and kept it safe for me. He was funny and very approachable. O the other hand the two stars in for the food. Their food lacks L O V E. Their flat breads have very few scattered ingredients, barely any meat. We ordered the vegetable flat and even that was poorly presented and very few vegetables, almost as if they were running out of condiments. My girl loves her GUINNESS with a beautiful head, chilled and thick consistency. Her beer was water very diluted. The restaurant was nice to take it off the bill, they told her that was the bottom of the keg. We also ordered cheesy spinach and artichoke stuffed mushroom caps. They were great tasting but the chef seems not to pay attention to detail and has o consistency in the kitchen. Some of the mushrooms were flat, lacked cheese, artichoke and spinach and some were perfect, there was no consistency and some were not appealing to the eye even though they tasted ok, some were better than others.  I think that more attention to detail should be put into the food and passion. This is not a place that i would frequent or even come back here to eat unless they up their game and actually serve me something i feel compelled to consume."
Jennifer M.,"Miami, FL",598,176,142,3.0,3/30/2016,"The location is convenient, and the servers are friendly but the food is pretty average and the happy hour menu is not impressive. It's never been my decision to visit BJ's and after my last visit, I remembered why. With so many places to eat at The Falls, as well as real breweries in Miami, I will probably not be returning for a while."
