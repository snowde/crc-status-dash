Zoila P.,"Miami, FL",54,5,,3.0,1/7/2017,"It's a good place to go drink beer at the bar, or go with a big group.  Don't expect much quality in the food.  It's a step down from Fridays."
Ronnita W.,"Miami, FL",72,70,128,5.0,11/6/2016,"So my brother and his now FIANCEE had their first date at this location last year. So as he planned his proposal he toyed with the idea of doing it here. Well his work schedule just would not let us be great! Until yesterday he got a shift change...so he contacted the restaurant and was told they could not accommodate him for the requested time. Well I called back about 3 hours before show time and spoke with the manager Laz. When I explained what was going on Laz seemed to really want to help us get this done. So he agreed to the selected time with our party split in half in two different areas. We agreed and were very grateful. Laz explained the whole party had to be present to be seated and we had a 20 minute grace window. My brother's FIANCEE had family returning from Orlando and we were getting close to the end of the grace period. I called the restaurant and they advised they would wait for us and understood. They also were able to get us all seated together!  We came in a group of about 25-30 (planned for 20...) and surprised her at her. He did his proposal she said yes we made lots of noise. Some people left so we maintained our 20, but we slowly moved to our reserved area. Sooooo much excitement!!!! The staff was patient and repeatedly checked with me to ensure we had what we needed and wanted. The service speed was really good for a party this large (actually any sized party) and the checks were appropriately separated with no automatic tip (unusual - I would not have mind if they did...but we made sure to show the staff how much we appreciated them). As far as food...I didn't eat...only margaritas and patron shots..but my 3 children had lemonade, pizza and fries and they were all very pleased. Any place that can host this amount of excitement and still equally please my 3, 4, and 6 year old...is five star in my book. My parents had clam chowder bread bowls and they reported they were good also.  Thank you Laz, BJ's, and staff for helping us get my brother and FIANCEE into the proposal location that was meaningful to them."
Andrej M.,"Miami Beach, FL",101,154,547,3.0,9/30/2016,The food is good. It can be a bit pricey for what you are getting at times without taking advantage of the happy hour special. Not all the waiters are on top of their tables. Have had some times with wasted time waiting while watching waiters shooting the breeze with each other. Definitely could use improvement on service.
Susan B.,"Miami Beach, FL",9,5,,4.0,1/4/2017,"Servers are awsome!  Fav is the rootbeer glazed rib appitizer, and chili bread bowl.  Nice decor, noisy sports bar atmosphere."
Lou C.,"Miami, FL",0,7,,1.0,7/19/2017,"I'm so sorry to say our recent experience at BJ's was an incredible disappointment. Overall the service was good. The waitress spent the night apologizing.  Not her fault the food and/or kitchen were lacking. Party of five on a weeknight I really expected a decent meal. For starters we ordered two beers at the bar - they were not cold. The two appetizers we ordered - one came cold and the calamari was 90% tentacles and 10% rings.  The mahi tacos were good and I would recommend them. However, the honey crisp chicken salad tasted like fish - the chicken and the lettuce.  The Prime Rib Dip sandwich came without the au jus nor dipping sauce - and we were finished with our meal by the time my son received the sauce = cold sandwich and hot dipping sauce.  The mac n cheese couscous and dipping sauce seemed to lack in quantity - I guess supplies were down in the kitchen.  The saddest part is having to pay for this meal.  I'll frequent Flanagans, Duffys or Keg South before visiting BJs again."
Mom O.,"Orlando, FL",1,47,13,5.0,3/8/2017,"Laqueaba Walker from the front was VERY NICE AND FRIENDLY! my kids loved talking to her while getting everything ready to sit at our table. Michelle, our server was very nice and attentive. The only bad thing was our fries... very grassy. So disappointed but at least the service was out of this world. Hopefully the food will be good next time."
Babak N.,"Miami, FL",3,12,4,5.0,1/13/2017,They are allergie friendly which is great for my son who has several allergies. Service is great and the food is good allergies well. The pizza and burgers are my go to every time.
Donna D.,"Melbourne, Australia",206,302,395,3.0,6/4/2015,"I came here for beers and a light bite. So picking from the appetizer menu, we decided on calamari and avocado rolls. I really enjoyed the avocado rolls, the sauce is yummy and they are light, flavorful and good to start with. On the other hand, the calamari, you don't need in your life. It was tastelessly bland.  Now the beer, my friend told me that they do their own brews, and that really intrigued me. I tried both the red ale and the porter. Honestly, they just didn't float my boat.  Also, we were seated within ten minutes of arriving and giving them a name. The waitress was also very sweet and our food got to our table incredibly fast, just seconds after our drinks got to the table.  Now, I came on a Friday night and expected a long wait time, BJ's exceeded my expectation in that department. On this particular night, there were 6 birthdays being celebrated just adding to the noise level. Keep in mind that it is a loud place, so be prepared to use your outside voice."
Giraldo G.,"Hialeah, FL",23,41,295,4.0,7/18/2015,This place the food always great. We are regulars here because had a lot the tastier draft beer. We always ate in the bar because of service is better and faster. We take appetizer some time. But I ate lunch today I was expecting some lunch specials but no was like that. The lunch especial look like expensive snack so I ate a house top sirloin come with 2 sides. I choose the white cheddar mashed potato and the salad was mozarella with tomato was recommended for the bartender so I tried it.   The salad was delicious. The meat was so tender that melt in my mouth the mashed potato was creamy and in point. The price normal when you order a meat.  But the other ways the pasta dishes a little overpriced. Excellent place to drink and appetizers.
Esteban V.,"Miami, FL",3,60,4,1.0,5/24/2017,"Pot Roast with Parmesan Mashed Potatoes and roasted vegetables = average meat with instant mashed potatoes, half of a raw onion cut in half with raw carrots and raw celery sticks! All for $13. And the tilapia from last visit was raw in the middle. Sorry, never going back."
Katie M.,"Miami, FL",0,32,20,2.0,12/7/2016,Seems to be just like cheese cake factory or any other large chain. Not impressed with their food
Razaa A.,"New Orleans, LA",7,63,43,1.0,2/26/2017,"Worst service ever. We were greeted very nicely at the entrance and asked if we were Loyalty members. The 4 of us said yes, and we said we actually have 4 free mini pizookies in our app, can we claim them? She said sure. Once seated, the neighboring table looked like all employees of BJs who were very loud and looked to be intoxicated. Unprofessional. To make the situation worse, we are all visiting Miami for vacation and were craving late night pizookies. We made the late night ride, and walked away disgusted with the service from Sandee. We overheard Sandee say to the intoxicated employee table that we were just there for the free pizookies. Part of working in the service industry and having a loyalty app is to get folks into your door, show them good service and offer rewards. This, in turn, would have those first time customers become repeat customers to your location. Sandee placed our drinks very loudly on the table and was visibly upset. We understand we didn't spend $300 at BJs,  but now we won't be coming back or recommending this location due to your lack of professionalism and poor behavior."
Timothy P.,"Miami, FL",0,4,,4.0,6/24/2017,"I normally hate chain restaurants, but the food here is surprisingly good, reasonably priced, and with generous portions.  Their inspection reports are impeccable.  I have eaten in the restaurant and also ordered take-out from Door Dash, and food quality was similar.  Huge menu, which usually scares me that everything is going to be frozen, but I have yet to be disappointed with any of their entrees, sandwiches, or pasta dishes.  The only knock would be that the servers sometimes disappear for long stretches. I have not gone during peak hours, so it is hard for me to give a good sense of the service."
Rebecca L.,"Miami, FL",0,8,14,5.0,12/7/2016,"Even though the salmon was undercooked, I give it a 5 for service. The server was nice about it & the manager Gabe was aswell. He got the food cooked again & it was perfection. Would recommend this restaurant to one. Plus the pizookies are amazing!"
Michele L.,"Miami, FL",33,155,,5.0,2/26/2016,"I'm enjoying all the benefits of the BJs Reward Program.  You get regular ads for specials and events but receive lots of discounts.  The BOGO lunch, 1/2 off Monday pizza and happy hour meal and drinks specials are the best!"
Damaris J.,"Miami, FL",16,6,9,5.0,4/18/2016,"Originally I was going to rate the restaurant four stars because of the wait to get our order taken and then the wait to get our food but our waiter, Carlos, made it a point to apologize and to explain to us why he took a while so that smoothed things over for my boyfriend and I. The staff is friendly although a little forgetful, we asked for ketchup and honey mustard twice and we never got it even though they passed by us every five minutes. Oh well. The food was good as always, the guacamole burger is good, has a bit of a kick to it. Overall, I'd still recommend BJ's to anyone at The Falls, especially after watching a movie."
Shaawn A.,"New Orleans, LA",243,68,17,1.0,2/28/2017,"We often bring our guests visiting Miami to this location for our favorite dessert, a pizookie.  On this night, BJs was running a special stating a free mini pizookie for downloading the Rewards app.  We all did so and planned to tip the waiter/waitress the entire cost of our meal ~$20.  We were being served by Sandee and she looked like a sweet lady but we were fooled.  She was very rude and standoffish once she realized we were here for the free pizookie offer.  She did not make eye contact.  Did not respond or acknowledge our thank yous when she brought us water.  She slammed the water glasses on table.  And we once again thanked her when she brought out our food.  This was a terrible experience and looks very poorly upon the company.  Perhaps she had a bad day but it's important to do better when customer service means everything.  We still tipped her upon leaving Bc that is the right thing to do."
Andrew L.,"Miami, FL",0,2,,5.0,11/2/2016,Your bartender  Christina is so attentive. And so details on everything..she alway happy and smiling   By looking at up coming patrons her approach is so inviting.  Makes everyone feel welcome.. she is a asset to this bar..we venture out frequently and I wish a lot of the other places that we go to would have someone as attentive as she is.
Michael S.,"Miami, FL",433,341,1940,4.0,2/1/2015,"Wow. What a treat. This place is nice, open and a great menu with lots of options for everyone. Higly recommend."
Andrea A.,"Miami, FL",364,15,5,3.0,11/20/2015,I had a great time when I can with a friend for happy hour last week. Hates it the other 4 times I have been here because of the service but this afternoon was different. We enjoyed the call drinks... Only $4 and the server was awesome. Let us enjoy - no rush and he was attentive still!!! But the food wasn't so hot - fresh or tasty. And that's why I had to still rate my best experience here at 3   I'll be back for happy hour though!
