David M.,"Miami, FL",24,4,2,1.0,12/14/2015,"I was really hoping for a nice dinner. We've come here before and it wasn't so bad, but today was especially disappointing.  We literally stood in front of the hostess waiting for her to acknowledge us, while she stood there typing on her phone.  Service took longer than normal, just to say hi or get drinks ordered.  Appetizer was delivered to the table but no silverware to eat with, the food runner should either ask if we need anything before leaving or bring silverware by just being observant.  I asked for a medium rare burger and got well done with burn marks.  We always specify that we have 2 adults and baby with a stroller, we do this knowing that we don't want to block the aisle of disturb a table that might be too close. They obviously didn't care as they sat us at a couples table and we had to park the stroller in the main aisle. Not comfortable for us nor the baby and I'm sure not for the servers having to get by.  The bathroom was disgusting. Paper everywhere water on the floor making it very slippery. Overall the decor is nice, menu is assorted, food taste is mediocre, ambience is ok, service sucks, bathrooms are dirty, and our visit was a weekday low volume day."
MICHELLE C.,"Plantation, FL",2316,2081,4444,3.0,3/28/2013,"Very large place but be prepared to wait, they get packed. It is loud, TVs located throughout the place, huge menu reminded me of the Cheesecake Factory, makes deciding very difficult. Our server was friendly and very knowledgeable of their beer selection.  I told him what I liked and he suggested the right beer for my sampler pack. The crowd is fun here.  It is a very lively place.  We ordered the stuffed pizza which our daughter raved about.  When it first arrived it looked like a Chicago style pie.  First bite, oh no where close.  The ingredients were fresh, crust was good but the sauce was super sweet, yikes I so dislike sweet sauce.  I am eating a pizza not dessert. Also, very light cheese, way to skimpy on the cheese for my taste.  All in all this place is fun to go for maybe  to watch a game or with a large crowd. Great beer selection as well and good service. Cool place just not known for their food.  Next visit I will try some other items."
Top R.,"North Miami Beach, FL",0,27,45,5.0,3/2/2016,"I like this place.  The quality of everything was really good.  They have really high end Belgium beer on bottle. At 10 they have appetizers that go on half off which were outstanding.  I had a flatbread for 5 bucks that was awesome. , then i had the Ahi poke which was great.  I didn't like the fried wanton chips that come with the ahi poke, so they brought me out torilla chops instead along Siracha which set the plate off. It was kind of dead at the bar on Wednesday night at 10ish when happy hour starts . Another good feature is that under the bar around where your knees are, they are fitted with power outlets. So if you want to crank out some work over a berr snd some good appetizers: this is the place."
Nelson T.,"Miami, FL",42,66,172,4.0,1/4/2016,Any time I'm anywhere there's a BJs I'll stop in for the perriana beer that's my choice of the beer line up they have.  I usually will also do some of the classic style wings and salmon is pretty good to.
Odalissa C.,"Miami, FL",68,15,4,4.0,8/15/2016,"I've been multiple times to this location and service is always alright. Went this past Saturday night. Waited about 15 mins and got sat with Brandon A. The good was great like always. But service was excellent this time around. Brandon provided five start service by cleaning the table every time plates were changed, napkins where changed with every drink. Overall, we were super impressed."
D S.,"Miami, FL",0,10,2,1.0,9/3/2016,"We went to this place last night with our 8 month old daughter. Our table was right on top of both tables on either side with kids climbing in and out the entire time. The waitress took forever to take our order. The food took an hour to come out. When we finally got our food my Steak was completely Raw inside. I can eat rare steak and have never sent food back but this was a joke.  The mashed potatoes under the steak were soaked with blood. We had to wait again for the waitress to come back and take it. They took the same cut open steak and tried to cook it more and brought it back after my wife had already finished eating. Look at it again and its chared and burned on the outside, still raw on the inside and unevenly cooked / dried out from being cut open and re grilled.     Our 8 month old is ready to go home and getting upset. The manager takes the steak off the bill. ( sent back a second time)  I tell them we need the check, we cant wait anymore.    We get the bill and they charged us for food we didn't even order. Baby is upset and wants to go home and we have to wait again for the waitress to come back. She takes the bill and has to wait for a manager to correct the bill. still waiting..... We will never go back to this place and you shouldn't waste your time here"
Chris C.,"Miami, FL",432,333,18,5.0,6/19/2015,"I haven't had anything here I didn't like. From pasta to fish tacos, to chicken pita sandwiches. A massive menu and everything good. Full bar, large beer menu... it's a chain restaurant, but a very good chain."
Claudia L.,"Kendall, FL",35,16,35,5.0,1/16/2016,"First time coming here and I loved everything!  Fast service, good food and big portions and the place looked nice."
Lyndenise B.,"Miami, FL",294,530,2076,3.0,9/15/2014,The BJ's at The Falls is nice but the overall service was not. We had to wait to get utensils and napkins even after the food was brought out. The salad I had was OK but it seemed to have been out of the fridge for a little too long. I also had the gluten free cheese pizza which I think was great. I'm also a fan of the potato skins as an appetizer. Hopefully next time the service and salad will be better.
Mario S.,"Miami, FL",2,20,4,5.0,12/11/2015,"So I'm at the Falls and wanted a lite lunch. So walked in to Bjs was greeted with a smile by the nice hostess she gave me a menu. While looking at the menu the manager (Mike) came to say hi let us know about the lunch menu and it sounded great so we stayed.  I've eaten there in the past and want to say the service was ok,but very slow!  This time around Rusty our waiter was Outstanding! We ordered all you can eat soup and salad.  So the house salad is good, but all the soups are very good!!!! So thank you Mr Mike (Manager) for getting us to stay and turning things around over there! Rusty keep up the good work! You should be training employees your attitude was great!  Will be back soon."
Yani R.,"Miami, FL",17,20,22,4.0,7/12/2016,"Just ate here with my boyfriend and we both agree that the service was excellent. The hostesses were nice and welcoming faces and our waiter, Kevin, was very attentive. He always made sure we had refills (free refills on strawberry lemonade yay) and constantly checked up on us to see if everything was okay. I love BJ's because of the variety they have on the menu. There's a little bit of everything for all sorts of tastes. Food was tasty and came out quickly. I'll continue to go back."
Adolfo S.,"Miami, FL",14,6,6,1.0,3/28/2015,"I'm trying to say something nice, since the place is nicely decorated, plate presentation nice. Dont order  the top sirloin it is a hamburger join, manager missing I must say my waiter was nice his name is mike. As I read other comments I am definite not alone. This place can be so much better if you change the manager and the cook. Welcome ladies need lots of training."
Kai P.,"Brooklyn, NY",159,55,133,5.0,8/2/2015,This place just looks great ! The ambiance is really cool! Me and my girlfriends had lunch there and the prices were sooo great! I was surprised because when you step in you would just think it is a super expensive place.  I had the fried chicken which tastes soooo good. I wasn't a huge fan of the gravy so I asked for it to be placed on the side but the crunch on the chicken soo good and I believe I only paid 8$ for a decent size portion.  My friend ordered the salmon she loved it and my other 2 gfs ordered the club sandwiches and they thought it was great! The seasoned fries were sooo good! I think I stole more from her plate than she ate herself! The drinks are also really good!  I would def recommend coming here and ordering off the lunch menu for a great meal at a great price!!
Amy B.,"Miami, FL",70,120,166,3.0,5/5/2016,"Everything you would expect from a chain restaurant, nothing spectacular but nothing to complain about. Service was decent, food was good and we left happy."
Julie M.,"Miami, FL",8,160,19,1.0,8/6/2015,"This place has so much potential! Extensive menu, great selection of beer, and really nice atmosphere. However, the service is consistently terrible!!!!! I don't care WHAT you serve for food, or how many beers on tap you have - if your service lacks, you're not getting my money...  Ok, I lied.... I keep giving them my money, and I think it's because I am desperately hoping that their service has improved. Unfortunately, my last visit was no better than the ones before it.  I went for lunch with a group of friends and their kiddies, and it was one of the worst experiences I've had at BJ's. The waitress did not say a word to us, she didn't smile a single time, or respond to us when we would ask for something. I said ""thank you"" several times and not ONCE did she say a word back to me, but rather I just got an attitude-packed glare each time. My previous visit to BJ's was a similar experience, but with a male server. He was absolutely awful. We told them that we had a birthday at our table and he came back with a candle and a dessert, plopped it on the table in front of the birthday boy and walked away. No one sang happy birthday, we had to start it ourselves. It was just awkward!  In a nutshell - great menu, mediocre food quality, and slow service with a side of attitude."
Brandi M.,"Orlando, FL",32,44,20,4.0,10/6/2015,First time coming to this place regardless of living very close to it and I shall be coming back many more times. Lovely atmosphere and attentive service and GREAT burgers!!! But the best part of the meal was the chocolate Pizzookie (pizza cookie) so good but not big enough for a large party I needed like 3 of them.
Rosa V.,"Hialeah, FL",6,13,7,1.0,2/3/2016,"I looked up previous reviews on Yelp and I really wish I had listened. Went in with my boyfriend on a very slow Sunday afternoon. Server seemed uninterested entire time. She was in the middle of taking our order and kept looking away at what was going on at the server station behind us. Food took forever to come to the table. And when we did get our food, my boyfriend's burger had no burger. Yes, you read that right. The burger had NO patty. My deep dish pasta was extremely oily but by this time, I was just too hungry to care. If you really want good food, just keep driving. Skip this place altogether"
AK G.,"The Hammocks, FL",6,101,18,3.0,2/24/2014,"Came here yesterday to watch the Heat game. The place was pretty packed. A spot quickly opened up at the bar and opted for it since after all, we had been completely ignored by the hostess after standing in front of her for quite some time. Not good. After finally getting the bartenders' (Michael C.) attention, I ordered the usual... a pint of the black stuff. Always poured beautifully here. In spite of the fact that Michael C. was the only one behind the counter pouring drinks on a busy Sunday afternoon, he was attentive, polite and most importantly made me feel welcomed. Made me want to stay longer and come back again :) Although nicely baked and flavorful on parts that did have the goods, I couldn't find much of anything on the Black and Bleu Flatbread. It was pretty much all bread. Cadillac Ranch knows their Flatbreads! Grilled Chicken Club Sandwich has good flavor, except the bread is very oily. Ewwww. I must admit they make really yummy salads. Nice big portions too. Love the atmosphere and the bartenders are always great. BJ's Brewhouse... an extra bartender wouldn't hurt on busy days."
Chris V.,"Plantation, FL",7,3,,2.0,12/11/2015,"I heard a lot of good things about this place from my folks who visit here often, but I have to say I was not impressed.  Let me start by saying I got take out from BJs, but many mistakes followed. Their web app allows ordering which was convenient, but they didn't actually ""get"" my order until well into an hour after ordering. We had to wait another 30mins. Fine. It's ""new"" technology, so I'll go along with it. Then, once we pick up the food, they ask if I wanted the free garlic knots that came with the order, and I clicked on the web app to get.  (""duh""). So I had to wait another 5-7 min for a regular (not garlic) knot.  Here is the kicker: the turkey burger I ordered was plain without any fixings and the Santa Fe salad was minus the Santa Fe (no dressing).  I agree with most that the food is decent but the overall execution is very poor. Which after reading most reviews here, fall right in line."
David F.,"Orlando, FL",0,9,3,2.0,6/25/2016,Overpriced like crazy but that not the biggest turn off. The server who's name was Rocky R was not only rude but seem to be in a hurry and didn't seem like he wanted to serve us. Made the atmosphere feel unfriendly and when we asked for something extra he seemed annoyed and when he came back responded with attitude. Because of this I will probably not return to this restaurant ever again. The only reason I put 2 stars was that the food wasn't as awful as the service.
