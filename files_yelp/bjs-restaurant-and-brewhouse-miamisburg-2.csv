Ben S.,"Dayton, OH",43,50,31,2.0,12/13/2017,"Ok first off let me say I have had multiple great visits in BJ brewhouse. But this last visit was....um...horrendous! First the good. BJ's features a huge bar, tons of taps, lots of seating, clean bathrooms and generally great service. The menu is very large with something for everyone. And the quality is pretty good. I was excited to eat here because of my previous visits but man did they drop the ball. I can pretty much sum up my 2 star rating with 2 sentences.  6 people, 3 hour wait when told 45. Food came out and was cold.  I'm not kidding, 3 hour wait from the time we walked into the restaurant to when we got our food. I ordered the quinoa rice with shrimp (thought I'd try something new) and it came out cold to the touch. The manager blamed it on Christmas party's but good god Man that is bad.  I will probably be back to BJ's (1 because I love there piranha pale ale, (made in house) and 2, because our friends just love the food)  Fingers crossed for a better experience next time!"
Christopher K.,"Springboro, OH",16,32,,4.0,12/29/2017,"Every time I visit BJ's I leave with a smile.  This location is close to home, and with a family of four, the menu provides a wide enough variety for everyone to find something they'll like.  During our most recent visit, I decided to give the Double Bone-In Pork Chop a try and was very happy with my choice.  The pork was tender and juicy and seasoned to perfection.  We always enjoy the craft sodas and the Monkey Bread Pizookie is a great choice for dessert if you still have room."
Amanda H.,"Cincinnati, OH",98,166,477,4.0,11/1/2017,"We went during happy hour before the Alton Brown concert and was so so pleasantly surprised with their menu. First of all it's Very large. Shirley something for everybody. We did the happy hour and got half off a bunch of different things. I love the wings they were amazing, the avocado rolls were great, the pizza was just OK. It was about 2/3 crust and only a tiny little bit of toppings. (actually the only thing we did not like.) And the wine was half off which was awesome. We will definitely go there again if you're in the area. I'd recommend it just your clear for pizza unless maybe the bigger ones are full of more toppings"
Jason K.,"Dayton, OH",39,31,370,2.0,4/1/2017,"Wow. I'm not sure where to start. I've had some amazing food at this establishment, and some mediocre food. What really brings this place down is their far from stellar service, time and time again. This is by no means and expensive Michelin star restaurant, but not having your appetizer brought out for 30 min, and never being able to get one refill is ridiculous. We were asked once if we needed a refill, only to have the server walk by 15 minutes later and realizing she forgot, then taking another 15 minutes to come back with them. We were so feed up, we didn't even eat a 1/4 of our dinner and we're scared to even wait for a take home box, let alone the check. Hopefully they get their act together, because this place could be stellar for what it is."
Mark L.,"Dayton, OH",1,7,3,2.0,11/10/2017,We arrived at 11 am and we are still waiting for our food 45 minutes later. Place is completely understaffed. Some booths are waiting for someone to take their order still. Unbelievable!!! Place is poorly managed obviously. This is my second lunch visit and the same thing happened last time. This will be my last visit to BJ's regardless of the good food.
Chris M.,"Lebanon, OH",19,32,4,3.0,9/27/2017,"Good atmosphere, great brew selection. Food is usually good but last few times haven't been that great."
Nicole G.,"Raleigh, NC",10,145,58,4.0,12/26/2016,"I usually enjoy BJ's when I visit other places. All are not created equal, of course. We were seated quickly and the waitress took our order in a very pleasant manner. I ordered the cherry glazed salmon, couscous, and asparagus and we ordered monkey bread and ice cream for dessert. I also ordered red sangria and it was delicious."
Amber G.,"Miamisburg, OH",0,49,13,5.0,6/28/2017,"The staff are all very friendly and accommodating. The restaurant is great for large groups. I've brought a group of approximately 25 or so several times and they put us in our own sectioned off room. My favorites from the menu include the pizza, mahi mahi tacos and the pizookie cookie desserts."
Hannah D.,"Charlotte, NC",76,71,3,1.0,11/26/2017,I usually love BJs - the pizza was soggy at this location and my deep dish ziti was awful. It tasted like it was right out of a can.
Ellie D.,"Dayton, OH",0,67,1,4.0,9/22/2017,"I could live off of their Brussel sprouts and chicken tortilla soup.  Other tasty items I've tried from here are Mahi Mahi, fish & chips & steak (fantastic)  The atmosphere is nice and the service is always good.  Definitely a good go-to if you can't decide on where to eat!"
Brian K.,"Cedarburg, WI",14,3,4,1.0,2/12/2017,Went here for lunch today. We really enjoyed the one in Peoria As but this one today made use really open our eyes that even a chain can disappoint. My wife ordered a beef dip sandwich and when it arrived it was cold as well as the wedges. Considering it was busy we overlooked that. Till she took a bite and had me try it cause it seemed a little off. The beef tasted like the beef when you put it in the microwave. Has that certain taste that is hard to overcome. Second is the broth to dip the sandwich in. It was a bowl of oil basically. It or left a heavy coating in your mouth and sick to your stomach. My wife has being curled up in bed now for 3 hours. She could only eat 3 bites of her sandwich. Cold fries are nasty to begin with. I ordered the guacamole deluxe burger. Felt like I was at a MacDonald restaurant. The patty barely filled half of the bun.
Teresa R.,"Kasilof, AK",29,2,,5.0,9/16/2017,"Good food and good service. We went a little late, but got in pretty quickly on a Friday. We had to sit in the bar, but it was a nice atmosphere.  Best thing about restaurant is a large variety of food options. If you go, be sure to have a pizzokie (cookie and ice cream)-delicious!"
Holly K.,"Springboro, OH",0,8,1,2.0,1/13/2017,"Will not be returning! Food was just ok, but service was bad! Again! Glasses left sitting even after server was by 4 times and the manager once. Oh well....."
Amanda S.,"Dayton, OH",0,5,,5.0,9/1/2017,"Kids meal is literally an adult portion, by far the best deal and always such great service. Except for that one time you forgot my roll lol other than that its been 100."
Nikki D.,"Dayton, OH",14,29,10,2.0,7/29/2017,"I'm super disappointed that this place wasn't what I wanted to be! The hostesses were very nice and accommodating but our server was less than attentive. We were never offered a refill and had to flag our server down for each one. Our appetizers took over 30 minutes to appear and were overcooked. Our meals were less than thrilling; undercooked broccoli and brussel sprouts, small pasta portions for the price, overcooked salmon, etc. I had a burger, fries, brussel sprouts and a soda and spent $22 before tip. For that price I'd like good service and good food, or at least one of the two!"
Beatriz D.,"Monroe, OH",17,2,,1.0,8/27/2017,This is not my preferred restaurant! It took about an hour to get our meals. And the request for butter for the baked potato (when the potato & green beans finally came) took 20 minutes. And the restaurant was not even full.....
Quentin C.,"Windsor Locks, CT",30,24,14,1.0,1/28/2017,"The menu here looks pretty good, BJs has a wide variety of offerings.  But the truth is that most of what we ordered here tasted of the ""heat and serve"" variety.  Not only that, the service here was ALL BAD!!!!  It's ridiculous, we've gone during peak hours, slow periods, and a few times in between... we've gone in a large group (~10), a small group (4), and as a couple...  each time it was exactly the same. I do NOT recommend this particular location.  Others may be better, but not here!"
Rob M.,"Cincinnati, OH",0,4,,2.0,7/29/2017,"This a good place to socialize and have cocktails. However, if you are looking for a good meal and service,  keep looking.  Two bad experiences in the past three months.  Shame on me...."
Kim N.,"Cridersville, OH",10,91,74,5.0,1/17/2017,"Don't miss this place! We have been to three different locations, multiple times each and have NEVER had a bad meal or service! Clean, gorgeous decor, modern, full bar, superb food, lunch specials, full dinner menu... heavenly! I love the tomato/mozzarella salad, chicken tortilla soup, potato wedges, chicken/shrimp jambalaya, and pazookies!"
Samantha A.,"Davenport, IA",0,10,3,5.0,7/24/2017,The lemon thyme chicken and Barbacoa chicken are both great dishes! Avocado eggs rolls are DELICIOUS
James K.,"Lebanon, OH",2,6,2,5.0,8/12/2017,I love this place they brew their own beer and pop rootbeer is fantasic and their pizzas and chicken wings in there rootbeer rub is fantasic. Not to mention they have plenty of tvs so u wont miss any sporting events and there service is great
April A.,"Dayton, OH",50,39,29,4.0,6/19/2016,"It's Father's Day, so I expected a long wait, but the wait really wasn't that long, maybe 6 minutes.  As far as atmosphere is concerned, I like this BJ's. They have that sports bar feel, but it still looks classy. I wanted to sit outside, but my friend said it was too hot, so I compromised and we sat inside. Our waitress Elizabeth was very friendly.  When we walked in k saw that they had some new appetizers, so I decided to try that. They were quite tasty. I would definitely get them again.  For my main meal I ordered the lemon pepper wings. I love the lemon pepper wings at my favorite spot, but these didn't come close. They were really salty, so I sent them back and ordered the grilled chicken Alfredo, which was really good.  I thought I would have room for dessert, but it didn't happen this time."
Sharon M.,"Waynesville, OH",0,5,,1.0,8/1/2017,"I will never go to BJ's. They have a dining app where you accumulate points,and on my last visit they took points away instead of adding them. When I contacted corporate via email, I received no response . I hate being ripped off. Their food is not all that great anyhow."
Rob M.,"Miamisburg, OH",0,19,,2.0,4/4/2017,"Trying to be careful here since I usually don't mind going to this place.  I would just give them One Star since zero isn't legal but I do have a history of coming here and I hope this was just an aberration.  Typically, we have decent service, a decent atmosphere, and decent food.  Not great nor particularly fast, just decent.  Not so much this Sunday, 2 April 2017.  Honestly, I've notice a gradual decline toward mediocrity which is sad given that I rather like the Nutty Brunette (the beer, not the waitress) and how crowded and popular this place was just a year ago...so ""Meh, I 've experienced better"" is as low as I'll go today...but know the urge to totally dump on this place is there.... Our issues this Sunday were pretty basic.  I had a party of 6&1/2, so we called ahead after Church (Around 1230 or so) and was told that we were looking at a 30 delay.  Outstanding, put us on the list and we'll be there in 15!  Sounds perfect, right?  It took a full hour and 10 minutes to get us a seat!  We saw similar parties in size come in and be seated...no biggie ""if"" they had called ahead but here's the thing, they didn't.  When we were finally seated, it was because I went up, showed the gal on my phone where they acknowledged my call-in to which I got a bright, ""Oh, You're Next""...No apology or other acknowledgement of an error.  I did hear one of the gals mutter to the other...""oh, I f'd up"" as I passed the hostess area.  Lack of professionalism aside, somebody should have apologized to us for the error. Still, water under the bridge, we were seated back in the last section and...ignored.  Two other large parties were sat near us and...ignored.  Another full 20 minutes and one...one...only one...server showed up to work the ENTIRE FREAKIN' SECTION!  Thought she was going to cry when she saw the number of folks in her area.  Still, she gave it a heck of a go!   Sadly, nobody was supporting her...food was slow to come out and therefore no longer warm...drinks were slow...everything was S.L.O.W.  Good thing my family all liked each other at that particular point in time and the Grandkids were angelic...even the baby...which is suspicious, but on a different level.  Other tables were not as forgiving.  Kind of embittered the entire section if you know what I mean.  Poor kid. We finally got our bill and paid our bail bond to get free of this situation.  Walked out the door at 3:45...with nary a manager to be seen.  He/she didn't come out to support the Waitress, not even once.  I did not push it since family was mostly happy, a little stir crazy but mostly happy.  But dang, what a complete and utter failure on the customer service side.  Sadly, this BJ's location is off my food radar for the immediate future.  Maybe once the colleges let out and they get some additional help but for now...nope. Oh, and I tipped that poor waitress in cash.  Hope she pocketed the whole thing and didn't share with the back staff...they really let her down."
Drew K.,"Franklin, OH",58,57,66,3.0,5/4/2017,"Cannot figure out the check in process and seat people to save their life! Basic logistics people! Get us checked in, get us seated. Somehow you can't sort it out."
Paula K.,"Dayton, OH",0,41,,2.0,10/4/2016,Came with 5 other women today @ 5 . NO one in room but us. Service utterly horrible...one ordered wine - never came - one meal wrong side - refills one glass water... Hardly came to see how we were doing to check in  One lady had to ask for a pop refill- dessert came -- for 3---2 came 15-20  Min later -1 never came - no checking in for an explanation - no nothing --she finally got dessert after everyone had finished theirs and it was they had to make the cookie - why didn't u come over and explain -- nothing  Lousy service and not busy - came for one lady's birthday --- -
Sean H.,"Dayton, OH",0,11,,3.0,2/27/2017,"The food was ok. I had a burger and my wife had a cobb salad. My 5 yr old son loved the Kraft Mac & Cheese. We finally tried the Pizzookies(trio plate) and it was very good. The service was not bad, but the server never offered drink refills when our glasses were empty. When we stopped the server and asked for drinks, they were brought out quickly. The prices were fair and the restaurant was nice and clean. I would go back again, but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to eat here."
Karen D.,"Cincinnati, OH",40,25,5,3.0,4/28/2017,I use to love coming to BJ's but I'm not sure the food is as good as it use to be. The drinks are really good and my husband loves the beer choices.
Amanda L.,"Waynesville, OH",0,9,2,5.0,6/2/2017,"Awesome restaurant, delicious food from the appetizers to the entrées, just a huge selection on their menu, as well as several options for the beer and other drinks. Nice environment too. Will definitely go back."
Kimberly J.,"Lebanon, OH",414,438,2368,4.0,2/11/2015,"This a great spot. Like a higher end sports bar. The food here is really great and they have a lot of portion size options which I think is awesome. The have small bites, appetizers and meal sizes. We split the California burger which was amazing. I loved the bread alternative. Plus splitting the sandwich left us more room for two of the light bites: the bruchetta and corn fritters. Both were really great.  By the way their beer selection is expansive and they even have beer they brew themselves. They allow tasting so sample a few and take your time. There are a lot of really great choices here. I like to sit at the bar but the main dining area is very pretty and gives less of the ""sports bar"" impression and more of a casual dining one."
Patricia H.,"Panama City Beach, FL",0,17,4,3.0,2/4/2017,"Just ok today, the last couple times Ive came I haven't been that happy with the service or the food."
Martin S.,"Raleigh, NC",57,164,58,4.0,2/13/2016,"Local Brewpub in Dayton with a rather decent menu. Excellent for groups, the lonely traveler looking for a decent, quick meal, with a great pint. I do find a lot of the food a bit too salty, so I always ask that they leave the salt off or promise to use it with moderation. I've enjoyed the salads, flatbreads, particularly the gluten free and flying pig (I think), as well as the steaks. You're not in a steakhouse, so set your expectations for better than a burger, and enjoy. The house beers are all terrific, and there are about 50 more guest beers to choose from. If you're in town, and like good beer, no reason not to come. They also have the largest damn television I've ever seen. Games are quite cool, though I don't watch sports, so I have no idea what's really happening ..."
Jim T.,"Etobicoke, Toronto, Canada",0,12,1,2.0,4/10/2017,"Well, they did it again!  We went once before, the service was horrible but the food was good. This time both were bad. We waited forever to even see a server.  Then after we ordered it took another 30 minutes to get our food. The soup, fries, and burger were lukewarm at best. The burger was below average, even had it been hot.  It also came with no cheese or onions although I had specifically ordered both. Not a great experience."
Jay S.,"Greenville, OH",11,27,19,4.0,4/7/2017,I have been in multiple locations for the brew house restaurant and they have all been enjoyable. Great place to eat. Nice selection of food at a decent price. Their house beer is very good. Large restaurant with plenty of seating and a good atmosphere. Friendly service.
Blue B.,"Dayton, OH",0,5,,5.0,5/14/2017,"This restaurant has so far been one of my favorites. The drinks and sodas are prepared nicely, and the best part is the shrimp spinach quinoa dish. Splendid service and nice tables and mood lighting."
David H.,"Miamisburg, OH",9,10,,3.0,5/13/2017,I would have given a higher rating for the food. This particular visit my server was non existent and absent minded. The restaurant was not busy as it was early lunch. My appetizer (flatbread) was overcooked and burnt.  I asked for a refill and ice...refill came with no ice.  10 minutes later I got ice and was told they would be right back to refill. She never returned. She brought the check with a full glass of ice sitting on the table and no refill. I'm thinking carry out from now on. I love their pizza and salads but service  is awful!
Katie S.,"Louisville, KY",56,17,3,3.0,4/2/2017,"Gluten free pizza is very good, several gluten free options but pizza is definitely the best dinner choice.  Service was quick, staff was very knowledgeable and helpful about menu items.  Accepts reservations for bigger parties so that is awesome!"
Ran G.,"Dayton, OH",0,30,,1.0,8/17/2017,Woe what a joke asked several times to do something for a friend for her bday. Nothing happened at all. 9people at our table food arrived in different times what a mess. Never even came back to ask anyone for another drink. I went up front asked  for manager and told her what was going on.  Not at all  concerned with us.Never going back total joke prices are way too high I hope a regional manager calls me that staff needs to go manager included.
Jeff G.,"Centerville, OH",306,226,137,4.0,2/2/2016,"This place is a cross between Cheesecake Factory and J Alexander's. I wanted to rate it three stars but the fact is the food is pretty good, the service is always very good, their house beers are tasty, and they have about 20 guest taps.  This is not a place I frequent but when I go I really have nothing to complain about."
