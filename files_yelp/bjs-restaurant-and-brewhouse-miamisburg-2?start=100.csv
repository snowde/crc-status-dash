Phil M.,"Cincinnati, OH",2,175,,3.0,12/1/2013,"Visited just today as I had heard good things about the place. After reading the sign, I stood in the lobby for 1/2 hour but it never materialized, so we went to sit down. It's a good effort for the area. The beer list definitely had promise, but we were there for lunch and I only drink after 12:15.  My bison burger had less meat than one at a vegetarian restaurant, so it was just okay. The side salad thing was caked in dressing and oniony to boot. The service is definitely good but I don't think it will turn into the high class place they're trying to make it be. When I got home, I let out some high class farts"
Will B.,"Middletown, OH",0,28,6,5.0,3/27/2015,"I'm a BJs Premier Rewards member, and I have to say that every time my girlfriend and I have eaten at this one or the one in Tri-County, we've never been disappointed.  We both really enjoy the Parmesan Crusted Chicken (which says a lot for me since I usually order a steak when I eat out) and the pizookies.  She even made some for me for Valentine's Day.  I'd recommend their food and especially their desserts to anyone.  I'm always impressed with the service and friendliness of the staff, as well as the knowledge of the menu and drinks.  I would also recommend their homemade soft drinks, which I also don't normally drink, but whenever I go here, I indulge.  Will definitely go again!"
Lisa H.,"Dayton, OH",16,4,,5.0,6/22/2015,Went there for lunch today had the black and blue house burger it was very good and the spinach and artichoke dip for appitizer it was good 5 stars
Hanna H.,"Miamisburg, OH",0,10,,2.0,4/13/2015,Been to this restaurant 4 times.  1 time was great!  The other 3 times horrible!  Service and food was not to par!  Slow service and I never send back food but I got the Mahi one night and it smelled so bad a bait shop would have smelled better.  The server even had the nerve to tell me that Mahi Mahi smells like that!  Obviously she never has fresh seafood!
Jhan N.,"Lebanon, OH",24,9,1,4.0,10/16/2015,"Great lunch. The tomato bisque soup was fantastic, the Cesar's salad was great. The service was great."
Karen P.,"Springfield, OH",3,74,6,2.0,1/8/2015,The only thing that I can say is the best thing about the experience was the server Caycee. My husbands well done burger was rare- replaced and comped but a quick Sunday lunch was almost a 2 hour ordeal ! Yikes!!!
Jessica A.,"Lansing Charter Township, MI",2,15,3,4.0,7/16/2015,Great service and the flights of beer were awesome.  Every kind I tried was good.  The lettuce wraps were excellent.
Amber C.,"Meridian, ID",38,75,34,3.0,9/27/2013,"A group of us from work went here for lunch. They have been pretty busy all week: this is the first week they have been open. They are in the new Austin Landing development, next to Panera.  We went fairly early to try to beat the lunch rush. The place was starting to fill up but there were lots of open tables still. The wait time was ok, (just over five minutes) but the communication between the hostess and our party was pitiful. We were unsure of where to go or what to do based on her half-formed responses and then she basically just ignored us.  The restaurant itself is very nice inside, with lovely high ceilings and dark wood furniture. We did not go in the bar area but it looked nice as well. The staff was attentive but there were so many of them all over they were tripping on each other. I assume that this is a ""first week"" issue that I am assuming is due to training and guessing at needed staff levels. I hope so.  Our server was a very friendly at first, although he seemed to ""get lost"" half way through our meal and then managed to turn from being very friendly into almost rude when resurfaced. The servers are obviously all still learning but the bussers and runners managed to ""serve from the right and pull from the left"" although our server did not. Normally that type of thing wouldn't even occur to me but they are aiming for a fancy look here and the hundred other people who came to our table (we honestly had at least 5 people running back and forth serving us and such, it was a circus at times) all did it so it stood out when he didn't. I will give all the million and one servers credit however: the manager was walking around checking on tables (lovely) and wasn't quite shy about correcting any of them in front of everyone (not so lovely).  The important part: the food. I had the roast beef dip sandwich with wedge fries. The fries were ""eh""...a typical wedge fry. Not much to do to make them amazing or horrible. The sandwich was great, even though I had forgotten to ask for it without cheese. The roast beef was delicious and the bread, although much too ""doughy"" was a good complement. The horseradish sauce was phenomenal: simple yet just perfectly tasty. The au jus was cold when I got my plate and the cheese on my sandwich was as well (it was melted, but already cold) which leads me to think it was probably sitting for too long before getting to me. It is still a sandwich I would order again, with the exception being I will get it without cheese and with the string fries instead. My co-workers all enjoyed their meals as well. Three of them got the flatbread/salad combo, and it looked light and delicious and fresh and is definitely a good choice for a lighter lunch. Two others got the quesadilla, which looked very nice and was well plated. Both seemed to enjoy it as well.  Only one person tasted a beer, a Blonde (hey, it was a working lunch!) but he said it tasted fine.  The end of the meal ended with our now impatient and smart-alec server dumping a glass of water on two of us. Sigh.  Overall, the food was very good. The lunch menu is a great option and a decent value, the rest of the menu is way over-priced for what you get. The service could definitely have been better, but given it is so new, I am erring on the positive side, believing they will iron out the wrinkles and lose the attitudes once they gain more confidence. It took us an hour and half to dine there and part of that was almost ten minutes of waiting for waters/drinks! Again, I am hoping that a bit more time will smooth out that time issue as well, as it is not an option for a working day lunch for those of us who have an hour or so.  I will try them again in a few weeks and go with my son and without a schedule in mind so we can relax and enjoy it more. Hopefully that will kick the place up another star or two!"
Gary W.,"Dayton, OH",20,22,,3.0,5/14/2015,The inside is nice. The food is average and expensive. The service is slow. The beer is very good.
Jared R.,"Maineville, OH",3,33,11,3.0,12/13/2014,"Good pizza.  Not great.  For $24 per large pizza, I expected a whole lot more.  Pizza lacked toppings, sauce, had a lot of crust.  I would had rather spent  $20 on two larges from Pizza Hut."
Benjamin S.,"Monroe, OH",15,3,1,5.0,7/31/2015,Great service. Great atmosphere. First time here and I will be back. My wife and I brought our two kids with us ( 5 and 2 ). Could not have been treated better. The wait was to be expected and my pizza was the bomb. Her burger was great. Service was what will make me come back. The beer was a bonus. Come check it out.  Come see keven.
A M.,"Dayton, OH",0,15,,4.0,4/9/2016,"This has become our ""go-to"" when we can't get to dinner or lunch in time.  We love the on line ordering and curb side pickup.  The food has been consistently good."
Natalie D.,"Dayton, OH",0,1,,5.0,11/22/2014,"This was our first time at BJ's and we had an amazing time. I had the chicken pita tacos and my husband had the fried chicken dinner and they were both delicious. Our server was Chris and he was great. He helped my husband and I pick out beers to try, and was really knowledgeable about what beers we would like and what beers we should try for the first time. All of the beers and food he recommended, we loved. We will be coming back and asking for Chris to serve us every time."
Jordan S.,"Dayton, OH",3,2,,5.0,5/16/2015,"Really great restaurant. They have a great selection of dishes, let alone pizza. And their cookies and cream Pizookie (I think that's what it's called lol) for dessert is delicious! Definitely will be visiting more often."
Jordan C.,"Dayton, OH",19,9,2,3.0,9/20/2014,"BJs is sort of a mixed bag. The beer is great, 5 stars! But the food and service seem to be lacking. While everyone is very polite, it seems like they are understaffed. My party and I waited about an hour for our food and after we finished eating we waited about another hour to get our checks and pay. The food is 1-3 stars depending on what you get. We ordered some dumplings as an appetizer, but they were cold in the center. I have a suspicion that they microwave a lot of food. I think if they tweeked the menu and hired some more waiters they'd be one of the nicest places around."
Bob P.,"Dayton, OH",13,10,1,4.0,8/26/2015,"My wife and I went there for our 20th anniversary.  We asked around from friends as to where to go.  This was a place we've never been to before.  The outside of it was really nice.  Our son went there for prom over a year ago and had great service.  Our sever's name was Cynthia.  She was awesome!!  Highly recommend her!  What I liked about it was the homemade soft drinks they offered.  A choice between root beer, cream soda, orange or black cherry.  They even came in frosted glasses!  I ordered the ribeye steak with a salad and a baked potato.  It was cooked to perfection!  My wife also ordered a steak.  Hers was good also!  She got the asparagus which she said was ""delish!""  To top off our night, we ordered the ice cream trio.  It was a cookie baked in these little pans with vanilla ice cream on top!  Yum!  I also liked that they offered big screen tvs with sports on them!  We will definitely be back!"
Julie G.,"Dayton, OH",2,58,,4.0,9/24/2015,"Haven't been to this place in ages until yesterday. I received an email with a Party for Two ad. Two salads or soups, a medium pizza and a pizookie for $25. We had to ask about this special, since it was not advertised anywhere. I guess if you're going to frequent this place, you need to be on their email list. The patio was very nicely appointed, and the service was good. My husband was very excited about their pizza. The salads were nice, made with romaine and spinach. Tried the peanut butter smores pizookie. It was very good. All in all, I like this restaurant, it's a bit expensive. If you get the email specials, it's reasonably priced, too."
Debora D.,"Redding, CA",1,15,3,4.0,12/27/2013,"Have been there on several occasions at different times. The first time was overcrowded and we ate in the bar area which normally I do not prefer. The food and service was really quite good. I ordered a hamburger cooked medium rare, came out perfect! Husband ordered the pulled pork sandwich which was also quite tasty! Second time on a whim, ordered the mozzarella and tomato as a salad starter. Excellent choice as tomatoes tasted like they were just pulled out of the garden.  Ordered the pan pizza on the second trip, again normally not a fan of thick crust, but I think it is the best thick crust Dayton offers. The pizza was doughy and after two slices I was completely full. Really look forward to going back and just trying different menu items because so far, we have enjoyed the new digs in south Dayton."
Melissa S.,"Centerville, OH",35,88,,4.0,11/10/2014,"I've been to this restaurant multiple times since it's opened.  Every time I've been I thought the food and service were both good.  Not the best I've ever had, but above average.  There are always games on the multiple tvs if you're looking to watch something.  Pricing is pretty reasonable.  Not my first choice of restaurant, but I definitely enjoy it when I go"
Sharon L.,"Fairborn, OH",0,11,,4.0,9/23/2014,"My husband and I went here for lunch today.  He had a lunch portion pasta  and it was a good sized portion and came with tortilla soup,  which was so good.  I had the lunch buttermilk chicken with mashed potatoes, gravy and tortilla soup,  $6.95.  Amazing!  Portion was just right and it was so fresh and delicious.  Soup was poured at the table, so it was piping hot.  Our server was just right.  She didn't hover, but tended to our needs professionally and was friendly.  I am In a wheelchair, and everyone was very accommodating, which isn't the case everywhere.  I don't get to eat out often, and this was really a treat!"
