Samuel D.,"Lebanon, OH",8,1,,5.0,9/20/2015,"This restaurant made my Homecoming a night to remember.I highly recommend the Chicken Alfredo,personally.If you are to come here,try their homemade sodas,free refills and you can switch between all of them as long as your there.All I have to finish up with is it was just amazing."
Donna J.,"Dayton, OH",25,19,26,5.0,9/12/2014,"We went there for the first time at 9pm on a Thursday. The restaurant was still pretty full considering the time of day. Our server, Brandon, had the right mix of attentiveness and enthusiasm. He was never too far away and never hovered. He knew the menu and was able to answer every question we had (neither of us had been there before.) We loved every recommendation he made. The manager, Jason, was also great. You can tell there is a culture of great food and great service here. We will definitely go back and will be asking for Brandon when we do!"
Noah M.,"Dayton, OH",14,12,21,4.0,4/22/2014,"Fairly formal decor, feels like a cheesecake factory and bar Louie had an illegitimate child. Full menu and not bad original brew list. Bison burger ftw"
Dave H.,"Lexington, NC",1,35,1,4.0,6/10/2015,"Went for lunch. The weather was nice so we sat outside. I ordered the Mahi Mahi. It was cooked excellent. However, in my last bite, I was stabbed in the roof of my mouth by what I assumed was a bone. When I pulled it out, it was a piece of wood. I finished the meal and showed it to the server. To be honest, it wasn't that big of a deal to me. It was wood, not something grotesque. She went to the kitchen staff and showed them. Next thing I know the manager is there apologizing profusely. I assured him it was fine. He paid for my meal. I also told him that was not necessary. I felt they went out of their way to insure I was a satisfied customer. If I had known that would be the reaction, I probably would not have said anything. I will go back and order the same meal again. It was good. I highly recommend this restaurant."
Ryan M.,"Niles, OH",0,2,,3.0,12/24/2013,"Three of us went on a Monday around 4pm.  No waiting to be sat down.  The building comes off as Cheesecake Factory-esque, but it is clean and spacious.  The food was pretty good.  I had a pasta and chicken dish that provided two meals.  My wife had a deep dish pizza that she felt was OK.  Mom in Law had the parmesan crusted chicken.  She liked it a lot.  I tried a few of their homemade sodas; both were tasty.  I would go back, and will try their beers next time.  I always try to find local spots, but you could do worse with chains."
Andy K.,"Clarendon Hills, IL",0,55,,4.0,10/9/2015,Solid chain restaurant.  Food was a solid B which is amazing for anyplace in the Cincinnati / Dayton area.  My biggest complaint is the limited draft selection and being out of my top 2 choices.  The food menu is way to large.  It's like reading the bible...... so many pages.  Food was very good though.
Chris H.,"Hamilton, OH",41,212,134,3.0,4/23/2014,"We've been to BJ's twice now. This location and the one in Tri-County north or Cincinnati. Both times we have found to food to be good, if not a bit on the pricey side. This visit we decided to get a large pizza to split along with two appetizers. The aps, fried artichokes and bruschetta were both good and reasonably priced. The pizza too is good, which we have had twice now. Service was a bit slow, although our waiter was friendly enough, I think he was stretched too thin with the number of tables he had. Overall the food is A-Ok and the service is acceptable. BUT I would not go out of my way to try this place, especially given the menu prices."
John G.,"Centerville, OH",0,9,,4.0,11/23/2013,"For what this place is, it is good. Wouldn't be my first choice for an A + meal or the best micro brew, but they are solid.  The stout is good, think Guinness minus the bitter aftertaste. The pumpkin ale was also pretty tasty.  The food is what you would expect from a chain. Got the turkey sandwich, didn't knock my socks off, but was satisfying. my wife had same thought on fish tacos Service was great, but we went early at lunch. Waitress made a couple good beer recommendations. 1st time we tried going, walked out after hearing it would be a two hour wait."
Bruce F.,"Xenia, OH",16,9,,5.0,3/9/2014,"The initial wave of crowds trying the new restaurant in town have tapered off, so we finally decided to try BJ's, we had heard good things about it. We were very pleased. Our waiter was very attentive, brought an extra plate after over hearing we were going to share one of the dishes. We got a pizza, a burger, Mediterranean tacos, a flight of beers and a desert. All of the food was excellent. Deep dish pizza had a great crust, it wasn't too greasy like some deep dishes can be. Great flavor in the marinara. Burger was good sized, cooked medium as ordered  Good flavor, has a special sauce that was tasty. I didn't try the tacos, but my wife said they were great. The only complaint we had was the time it took for our food to arrive. It wasn't excessively slow, but not as fast as I thought it could be. I still give 5 stars because all the other plus make up for the one minor issue, the food was worth the wait."
Matthew W.,"Lumberton, NJ",65,208,20,5.0,6/10/2014,"Great food. They have booth, high top and bar seating. The high top and bar seating are the best places to watch the game. The drinks are a tad expensive, even for draft a Yuengling was $6. I went there with two friends to grab a bite and watch the Stanly Cup Game and we had a great time. It seems like a great place for friends, family or a date."
Victor C.,"Washington, NJ",49,55,2,4.0,4/30/2014,"Good food, good selection, nice decor and friendly service. 40 Beer taps! Great!"
Duane G.,"Anna, OH",27,2,,3.0,4/3/2016,"Oddest occurrence eating at bj's.  Arrived at 630 on a Sunday.  Think they have front of rhe house mgmt issues. Just after normal rush hours and seated  as soon as we walked in.  No silverware.  Server takes our order, does not say anything, no silverware.  Salads appear before anything else,waiter drops salads, does not notice or look to silverware ( third person)  rushes off before we can say anything.  Beers not yet arrived and servers avoiding eye contact . ( I am not a youngster; but I am cleancut?) Almost 10 minutes before we can catch servers eye and gain silverware ( still no beer)  finish our salads, talk for several minutes and  entree arrives, we mention beers, which are brought with apologies.  Entrees, especially cherry glazed salmon was excellent, wings more just ok.  Before I have consumed a couple of swallows of beer server asks if we want dessert.  Saying no, the bill arrives quicker than anything else.  Very good food, beer (amber oasis) ok,  service. MEH.  Clearly a training issue as it involved a number of servers.  Too bad, I wanted to like this place more."
Scott H.,"Springboro, OH",2,8,9,4.0,9/13/2014,Excellent burgers and great service been to 4 different one and experience and food is always great. Also refills on BJ'S root beer in a frosted mug is great.
J B.,"Dayton, OH",0,15,,2.0,12/5/2013,"Overall ""meh"". For all the hype, I don't understand what everyone's buzzing about.  I was referred by a friend who apparently had a much better experience than I did. The bar staff are fast and seem to be knowledgeable, however for their prices I don't think I'll ever drink here again. I noticed they had Goose Island's 312 on draft and I ordered one,  thinking the total would be $5.50 or less. Nope! $7.50 for a draft of Goose Island. Never again!  Our food was decent, nothing spectacular. We were seated in a lower level booth with other booths above us, where we could not see what the other diners had ordered. After eating the table above us that I could not see had ordered some sort of fish that smelled amazing. When I asked the served what they had ordered, she replied, ""I'm not sure I'd have to see what it was"" and then walked away. Now, if I had just wrapped up a dinner with guests who have not yet paid I would go above and beyond what it takes to ensure a good tip. However this waitress didn't think it was necessary to continue decent service and couldn't care less as to if we returned or not. So guess who's not returning? Yep, this guy."
Tony R.,"Flemington, NJ",0,14,,1.0,10/14/2013,"Horrible dining experience.  Poor service.  Took over ten minutes to be greeted by our server.  Got lost for long periods of time as drink orders took exceptional wait times surpassed only the the inordinate delay in getting two of three entrees.  The third seemed to be as lost as the kitchen staff.  Asked to see manager but was told he was working on the cooking line. Are you kidding me?  The food is a mediocre attempt at making American fare.  The southen fried chicken is two thin chicken cutlets breaded, over fried to dryness and served in 45 minutes over pasty mashed potatoes.  The chicken pasta was a pasty  mess with some broccoli thrown in and no real discernible seasoning or taste.   Cheeseburger has no flavor and despite menu description of being served with thousand island dressing none appeared and the server was perplexed as to what to do.   Finally the beer.  Having been to many microbrewery pubs the first requirement is that the glassware is ""beer clean"".  Fastest way to tell if they are beer clean is the amount of head when poured.  Of four beers ordered at the table not one had a head on it and no effervescence.  When questioned the server said it always looks like that.  Sure cannot tell if the beer is any good but it sure goes flat quickly.   I cannot tell if the crowds are because it is a new restaurant or if the time to turn over a table exceeds two hours.  Stay away from this place.  If you go don't say you weren't warned."
Adam M.,"Dayton, OH",0,7,,2.0,11/18/2013,"Just like every other chain restaurant. Focus primarily on environment and atmosphere, not much focus on the food. I'll give them a little of a break because being pretty new they were packed to the gills. So I can forgive slow food and drinks(our server was very polite and apologetic about any slowness which I appreciate). So here is my complaint. If your gonna take extra time getting me food at least make it good. We had pizza, burgers, appetizers, and beer.  Everything was bland and so so. Not the worst thing I ever had but definitely not great. Even my 12 year old was like ""eh"". If you can't excite a teenagers taste buds with pizza and burgers then you are really doing something wrong. Beer also was just OK. If your looking to go somewhere to watch a game and chug some beers it would be ok. If your looking for a nice meal with the family, go elsewhere."
Johnathan R.,"Goldsboro, PA",1,19,,5.0,7/18/2014,"Beer was good, lunch was a steal with beer specials and generous portions. The Parmesan crusted chicken sandwich was good, as were the fries. Great place to grab lunch close to the hotel."
Amanda B.,"Lima, OH",10,30,1,3.0,2/15/2014,"A little disappointed. Food was good not mind blowing. We started with the black and blue steak flat bread. That was very good. Then five minutes later our entries came out. I order the Mahi mahi grilled fish toco's. And my boyfriend ordered the bison burger. My fish toco's were good. They were topped with slaw and dressing. The red onion over powered everything else in the toco. It came with a side of chipotle salas, guacamole and corn chips. I got a harvest  hefeweizen which went nicely with the toco's.My boyfriends bison BBQ burger was good. It was very moist, topped with pico de gallo(which was really all tomatoes) and then layer of BBQ sauce. His came with a side of slaw. We both wish we could have chosen our own sides. The appetizer was the best part of our meal. Service was slow. The food was good. I would go back just not for a while."
Ciara B.,"Dayton, OH",0,19,12,4.0,7/7/2015,"I've been here twice and each time was a great experience. The food is delicious and the portions are more than generous. They offer an array of dishes to choose from. It has a great atmosphere. Even though there seems to always be a lot going on, the wait staff never forgets and you and are super friendly."
Sahana K.,"Dayton, OH",0,1,,3.0,6/7/2015,"Food was excellent but the service was mediocre. We ordered salmon with Quinoa but the server brought a completely different salmon entre with brown rice. When we pointed it out, he tried brush it off by saying ""oh it's just another kind of salmon"". We had to insist that we wanted what we ordered before he agreed to bring the correct order. Disappointing."
