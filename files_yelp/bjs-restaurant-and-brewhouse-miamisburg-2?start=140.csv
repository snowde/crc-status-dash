Ryan P.,"Centerville, OH",101,330,36,2.0,11/11/2013,"They are obviously experiencing growing pains from just opening, but the food is decent.  Highly recommend the avocado egg rolls and deep dish pizza, although the regular crust pizza is good as well.  Was disappointed by the mahi tacos. Try a Light Switch light lager for a flavorful, light beer."
Danette G.,"Tipp City, OH",0,6,,2.0,5/9/2015,Visited here a few weeks ago. Sat at the bar and had appetizers. Was enjoying the potato skins until a long hair that was melted in the cheese ended up in my mouth!  Manager apologized and offered a replacement but had lost my appetite!  Did take them off my bill.
Jose R.,"Dayton, OH",0,12,,4.0,1/11/2015,Great beer selection.  Good bar service.  Great food for bar restaurant.  Great bar restaurant ambience.
ChadandStephanie B.,"Ann Arbor, MI",12,9,1,4.0,1/7/2014,"Great service. Beer is all handcrafted which I like. The IPA was phenomenal but the hefeweizen was eh...  Food was really good. I had the grilled mahi mahi tacos and the fish was moist, not too dry. Definitely worth a stop if your in this area!"
Steve G.,"West Chester Township, OH",58,20,4,4.0,10/10/2013,Nice beer selection.  The home brewed beers are pretty good.  I had the jalapeño burger and it was great.  My girlfriend had the chicken fresco and she really enjoyed it as well.
Morgan E.,"Dayton, OH",1,6,,3.0,3/23/2014,"Slow, but worth it. I ordered the cherry glazed salmon, delicious, wish there was more in the dish.  Also had the corn fritters and again to feed a whole table it would have been ideal to have more than 4fritters. We waited a long time for our food, the waitress also forgot to put in our app. So that arrived with our meal. Not compensated for the mistake either.  Many craft beers and blends to choose from.2-3 pages of drinks in the menu.  Definitely call ahead to get a table as it's always packed."
Debra I.,"Springboro, OH",1,4,,1.0,5/4/2015,"Just went to BJ's for lunch. Terrible experience! The service was not only slow, our server was completely uninterested. I had a BBQ Chopped Salad. What can you do to salad you ask? It was watery and completely tasteless. If it had dressing on it, that would have been news to me. The soda was watered down. When I expressed my opinion of the salad, our server said, ""Oh? That's too bad. I love it."" Well, missy, I didn't ask if you liked it. There was no mention of any type of replacement or concession of any kind. Even though the entire salad was still sitting there. This place was seriously terrible. Obviously, no return trip here. Also, the servers were more interested in gathering at the hostess desk and visiting than in serving the guests. One of the male servers was even standing there playing with one of the other servers hair. Yes, at the hostess desk. Just stroking her long hair, over and over. Yuck!"
J H.,"Middletown, OH",0,12,,4.0,1/11/2014,"Great Decor Dinned here 3 times and would recommend it. Other than the LONG wait, love it."
James M.,"Dayton, OH",0,20,,2.0,12/27/2013,"We really want to like this place. It would be great to have a new, fresh restaurant to frequent. The food is really good when they get it right. Unfortunately, every time we visit we end up with something free because of horrid service or wrong dishes. Is the problem in the kitchen?  Is it the wait staff?  Is it management?  I don't know, but call in ""Restaurant Impossible"" now!  We want you to succeed!"
Steve K.,"Lebanon, OH",1,1,,1.0,3/14/2014,"YUCK!!!  There was a hair in my fries and my black & blue burger was raw in the middle.  I did not notice until I was 3/4 of the way through it since it was soggy to begin with.  The other people in my party liked their soup, salads and pizza, but said it was average."
Jeff H.,"Xenia, OH",14,6,1,4.0,6/2/2014,"Great overall atmosphere. I highly recommend the calamari with the lemon garlic aeoli and spicy marinara. Had the PM Porter and Hoppy Scotsman. Both were very tasty. Service left a little to desire. Waitress during a small lunch crowd seemed over tasked although it wasn't a huge group. No problem getting seated during the early afternoon but I would imagine the evening may be a different story. As a beer snob, I would've hoped to see more of the brewing vessels and the bar had a ton of taps but seemed to highlight liquor instead of beer. Impressive display of liquor bottles and lineup of taps but you wouldn't know about the taps unless at the bar."
Ryan B.,"Warehouse District, Austin, TX",132,8,3,1.0,1/16/2014,"It's just another chain.  Came here to drink a good hearty IPA and nothing here to be found.  We asked to try the The BJ's hopstorm, which I didn't care for as it didn't have a full bodied taste.  Disappointingly enough, we were charged $3 for a TASTER! There are much better places to grab a beer, and definitely better places with more love coming from behind the bar."
Brian C.,"Dayton, OH",83,282,26,3.0,11/20/2013,"When I write a review I hate to compare one place to another but the whole time we were here we kept thinking how much BJ's is like the Cheesecake Factory except with pizza and beer. The decor, menu, even some of the food items like the avocado springrolls are very Cheesecake Factory-esque. The place was packed, took us a few laps to find a parking spot but once inside the wait was 15-20 minutes and we were seated in about that time so not too bad. The beer selection was great, not quite as good as Chappy's Taproom (sorry, another comparison!), but pretty danged good for a chain! The service was friendly and prompt and our avocado springrolls came out pretty quickly. We ordered the deep dish pizza which is their signature dish (we ordered the gourmet meat version), and it was served shortly after we finished our appetizers. Overall the pizza was pretty good, not our favorite in town but pretty solid. Our favorite part about the pizza though was the crust, it was reminiscent of the old school Godfather's Pizza crust (dang! another comparison!), but seriously, it was light, crunchy, and buttery like Godfather's used to be way back when. For a chain, BJ's is pretty good and overall it was a solid experience. It was a little pricey, $40 for one regular sized beer, a beer sampler, a small pizza, and the avocado springrolls."
Clenn G.,"Dayton, OH",4,21,11,1.0,3/8/2014,"Waited 60 minutes for carry out, after a quote of 20 minutes. The food was no better than a TGI Friday's on a bad day.  The deep dish pizza was an ode to Pizza Hut on its worst day."
