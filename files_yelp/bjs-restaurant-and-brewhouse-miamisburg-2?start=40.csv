Claire N.,"Ypsilanti, MI",100,3,1,4.0,4/21/2017,One of my go to places to eat. Great atmosphere & love their daily specials. I mainly go thru the week as the weekends can be super crowded.
Lucy F.,"Dayton, OH",0,6,,5.0,8/12/2016,"8-5-16@8P took my sweetie here for BH dinner - met & surpassed expectations we sat at bar which was cool cause we got to chat w/interesting people that sitting at table wouldn't have happened- bartender was very knowledgeable about beers- I'm not a beer drinker but told him I liked moscato & he mixed two beers that were as sweet/tasty as my fav wine- Sam had BJ Classic rib-eye done perfectly, I had hickory brisket & bacon appetizer California club flatbread yum Good prices for excellent meal - service & good time Sam (Big A) & Lucy"
Wink B.,"Centerville, OH",14,184,866,5.0,8/23/2015,"Had the cajun shrimp this time. Solid. My wife had the Ahi salad and the creamy Wasabi was off the hook sinus clearing magic!  The kids had pasta and corn dogs and, wait for it, smiley fries. Yep. Stuff for everyone!  Love the place. If you haven't been here yet. Come on over. Oh, and the craft beers are outstanding. The bartenders are as crafty as the chef and the kitchen team."
Eden S.,"Indianapolis, IN",104,332,313,3.0,6/19/2016,"The food was good, but our waiter kept disappearing for long amounts of time! The restaurant is enormous, so plan to spend a while here while the staff helps everyone out! The food and drinks were very fun to try! My friends and I all split the Garlic Chicken Pesto flatbread, Honey Sriracha Brussels sprouts, and mozzarella sticks; all of which were delicious, but my favorite hands down were the Brussels sprouts! That was a completely new recipe involving Brussels sprouts in my world! I could eat them every day!"
Rhonda W.,"Franklin, OH",156,511,20507,4.0,11/10/2015,Tried the soup and ribs ... some times they are good ... somethings too fatty. My husband got the club sandwhich.
Jess H.,"Dayton, OH",81,240,283,5.0,6/19/2015,"I first tried this chain restaurant in California. I remember calling my boyfriend back home and telling him ""man, I wish they had a BJ's near us!""  ...lo and behold, there was! I had never heard of the chain before so I was pleasantly surprised to dine at this location after my California excursion.  The setting is like an upscale sports bar mixed with an Applebee's. The prices of the food and drinks are OUTSTANDING.  Seriously. It was the very first thing I noticed... everything is relatively cheap, compared to other restaurants like Friday's, Applebee's, etc... I don't like those restaurants for their bland food and overzealous prices. And there's a large selection of different appetizers and entrées. What a THICK menu!!  Our server, Lindsay, (sorry if I'm spelling your name wrong), was unlike most servers we've had before. Her serving style was so...blunt? There wasn't any artifical sweetness, no flattery and small talk...it was almost as if she was serving us as we were her aquaintances, so she didn't need to put on all those unneeded frills. It was honestly strange at first, but then I found it to be quite refreshing. I've worked at Fleming's for a little while and it reminded me of the regulars and servers interacting as friends...not as a tip-fishing waiting staff serving a customer. But anyway... way off track. The BLT salad was good... I wanted more blu cheese :'( but the portion size of the toppings were correct for normal people. The bread bowl with tomato bisque I ordered was AWESOME... Not a traditional dinner by any means, but it made me very happy. All of our food came out relatively fast. The salty caramel cookie... (I forgot the exclusive name of the dessert) was HEAVENLY. I freaking love the salty sweet combination and it was just perfect. So perfect.  Our server took great care of us, and we'll definitely be back. The hostesses up front should appear/act more friendly and attentive. There was a group of five or more staff members idly chatting away with each other as customers left the restaurant. Someone should put them on task for the sake of appearances."
David R.,"Dayton, OH",0,85,18,4.0,12/7/2016,"Always packed, best to call ahead. Food is good. Beer selection is very good. Nice decor. Well worth giving it a try."
Jill M.,"Glasgow, MO",0,11,1,5.0,6/1/2017,"Excellent place to eat! The Blonde craft beer is amazing. My kids loved the cous cous mac n cheese and the artichoke dip. The Mahi mahi tacos are so good. My hubs loves all the craft beers and burgers (which are gigantic). Have never had anything bad there! The only down side is the wait staff always seem depressed, and are not very helpful nor care."
Tyler S.,"Springboro, OH",81,2,,5.0,6/17/2017,The food is excellent! I love their pizza and craft beers!!Highly recommended if you're in the area!
Ryan B.,"Dayton, OH",0,15,,4.0,12/14/2016,This is fairly new to the area and I am very impressed with it. The food is good but the beer is the highlight of BJ's to me. If you're going to go you should at least sample their beer. Nice atmosphere as well!
Morgan P.,"Dayton, OH",0,5,,5.0,12/10/2016,"BJ's is a pretty good corporate restaurant chain, nothing that's super different than Cheesecake Factory or a business like that. However, what makes this particular BJ's at Austin Landing extraordinary is one of the main bartenders, Bijohn (not sure of the spelling of his name). Every time we come in we make an effort to sit at the bar because we know we'll get great, HONEST reviews on beer and food, as well as great conversation and just an awesome personality. BJ's is slightly overpriced in some categories, however the rewards system on our phone makes up for that with the coupons and deals offered quite frequently. But in totality, I go to BJ's for a cold IPA and to chill with Bijohn. Sometimes I get a pizzookie."
Lisa L.,"Loveland, OH",121,246,196,2.0,8/6/2016,"This was my second time here, first time after they opened, and now over a year later. Great service being there's barely anyone here on a Saturday at lunch which was odd to me. Was sat immediately, got a free appetizers feom yelp, I ended up trying the avacado eggrolls. Very bland and just plain boring! I couldn't even get past the 2nd one.  Then for my lunch I ordered one mahi mahi taco and one shrimp- again lacked major flavor! I ordered a side of rice pilaf rice wasn't even cooked. I was very dissapointed AGAIN. I wish I didn't have to give bad reviews wherever I go!!! I'm just being truthful! My waiter was great and I didn't even bother to tell him how terrible it was. Another place I would not recommend nor go back to! Save your money!!!!"
Diana M.,"Miamisburg, OH",34,4,2,4.0,12/1/2016,"I really liked their food and service. A few days ago, they messed up my to go order and I didn't want to go back to pick up the missing item but they did adjust my bill because I paid with a credit card. Check your to go before you leave but kudos for making it right."
Dustin C.,"Middletown, OH",15,2,,3.0,1/19/2016,"Decided to check out BJ's. It was my first time there and I was underwhelmed.   First, the host didn't really greet us and was kind of smug. After we got to the table, we had sat there for about 10 minutes before a server took our drink and appetizer order. We ordered the lettuce chicken wraps. They were actually really tasty. I had ordered the jalapeño burger and my wife ordered the cherry glazed salmon.  We both enjoyed our entrees. The server did a good job keeping my water refilled and did what was necessary for above average service. My only complaint was how little personality anyone had.  There is no reason I wouldn't go back, but it definitely wouldn't be my first option."
Lesha S.,"Springboro, OH",0,12,,2.0,5/15/2017,The service is just bad at this location. We have been there at peak times and slow times - it's still the same. Waited today during non-peak lunch time for 15 minutes and no server even took our drink order. We left.  Needs to improve before  we will be back.
Cheryl B.,"Middletown, OH",0,21,,2.0,11/11/2016,"Went here at Austin Landing for the 1st time.....outrageous prices and small portions. A Bud lite beer in a bottle was $4, I got 2 plus something that looked like a very small chicken burrito with cold frys (like u get at steak n shake)....bill was $18.......wont go back. Service was ok, food was not."
Tony S.,"Dayton, OH",27,76,20,3.0,8/20/2016,"I thought this place was relatively average. Nothing bad, but nothing that said hey come back. I also really hate places that funky tasting water either due to being straight from the faucet with no filter or residue cups. Water is gross here."
Tony F.,"Franklin, OH",0,4,,1.0,10/6/2016,"Looooong wait for food. Chips soggy with oil. Main waiter spilled my nephew's drink on him. Extra waiter dropped a knife on my lap. Was told my chips would be remade. Didn't happen. And my drink went dry. But, the waiter was really nice. Said my nephew would get a cookie for his birthday... They must be harvesting the flour first. Every time that darn server comes around, I can't keep being mad, tho. Really nice."
Rick E.,"Dayton, OH",0,1,,2.0,9/28/2016,"We had a group of 10 with half not satisfied. 2 had ribeye steaks that were so tough, you couldn't chew it. I wrote to corporate office a month ago, with zero response. I feel the lack of response to a problem is a bigger problem than the poor quality of food."
Amanda G.,"Trenton, OH",0,17,,5.0,2/19/2017,"We LOVE BJ's---actually we went here for three days straight! Everything is wonderful; from the burgers to the pizza, the craft beer to the lemonade. This is a great place to bring your family."
