Brittnay C.,"Cincinnati, OH",72,28,16,3.0,10/9/2015,"The saving grace of this place, and the only reason for three stars is their great beer selection. I got the berry cider which was a bit tart but it was still pretty good. My boyfriend got the chocolate raspberry porter which he loved.  Now on to the food, well appetizers, our party got. I ordered the calamari, it was swimming in grease to the point where the batter was sliding off the squid. The squid was slimy and tough to chew. My boyfriend got the Mac & Cheese and it was seriously lacking flavor. The bacon crumbles didn't even taste like bacon, it was basically noodles with a side of grease. The other couple we were with ordered the spinach artichoke dip and according to them it tasted like it came out of a jar and was reheated.  Bottom line, if your stopping in for drinks you won't be disappointed. From my experience at other BJ restraints I'd suggest getting a pazookie or two....I wish we had."
Susan S.,"Raleigh, NC",0,2,,1.0,12/29/2016,"Unbelievable.  I ordered the shrimp soba noodles.  She said it was one of her favorites.  I even pointed to it in menu.  I got noodles with chicken in it .  When I asked she apologized.  At that point, I said it's fine.  Then she gave back the credit cards to the wrong people.  I guess when we were fixing it my cc fell.   I left and went shopping .  Had to drive 30 minutes to go back and wait for them to go get it.  Had time to look at menu.  The chicken soba dish had 1040 calories versus the 450 for the one I ordered (for that very reason!!)  When I exclaimed that it was more than double calories to them, they just looked at me. Boy do I wish I had said please give the correct dish.....3 dollars less and almost 600 calories less!"
Tricia M.,"Loveland, OH",1,26,86,5.0,11/3/2015,One of the best places in Austin Landing. Love the ahi tuna salad. Kevin is a very attentive server!!  Love the pumpkin pazookies!!!
Jason D.,"Boca Raton, FL",53,43,22,3.0,8/16/2015,"Honestly a subpar chain restaurant that could be better, but needs better food and service-basically the core tenants of a restaurant. When we arrived they said 60 minute wait, but they forgot to mention that we could go to the bar area and not wait at all. We sat down, and didn't get menus for 10 minutes. Half the tables weren't cleared either. Slow service. Food: Had garlic parmesan wings as an appetizer- they weren't crispy enough, and the sauce was basically a salad dressing, very poor choice. I had the Barbecue Bison Burger and it was subpar to be honest. The burger patty was pretty small and dry. The ""spicy"" coleslaw that came with it was well below average.  Overall- decent atmosphere, Friday's quality of food. Service could be improved."
Tracy W.,"Miamisburg, OH",59,91,305,4.0,7/6/2015,On a Monday night we had a quick 5 minute wait for a table. My husband had the balsamic glazed chicken and I had the classic burger.   Both were great meals.   We love coving to BJ's and will definitely be back soon.
Christianne B.,"Memphis, TN",34,106,167,5.0,5/18/2015,"An enjoyable dinner all the way around! We ate at 8:30 on a Monday, so there was no wait to be seated. We were greeted by our server, Sarah, within a couple minutes of being seated which was great. We each ordered a beer and decided to split a pizza and have salads as an appetizer. The beers came within minutes of ordering and the salads shortly after. Both of which were good. The pizza was excellent! Deep and loaded with toppings. We tried the BJ's favorite which was basically a deluxe pizza. My only complaint was that the pizza had hardly any sauce, but our server was very attentive and brought me a side of marinara. All around great dinner and decent value for the price! Would try again."
Amanda J.,"Franklin, OH",0,2,4,5.0,5/28/2016,I've been there twice and the food is always fresh and delicious! The staff is very friendly and professional. My boyfriend and I always try to make this place our date night!
Derrick A.,"Bellingham, WA",26,8,,2.0,12/26/2014,"We have been to BJs several times. The place has good points and bad points.  The Good: the deep pizza is pretty good for the Dayton area. They also have a good beer selection and the main bartender is pretty knowledgeable. The dessert cookies are pretty good as well.  The Bad: The service is pretty awful. The servers are pretty slow even when the place isn't all that full. I've had the wrong pizza, cold/undercooked pizza, missing kids meals, cold fries, fries that came out 20 minutes after I finished my sandwich and MIA servers. A lot of the appetizers also look and taste like they came from the frozen food section of the Kroger across the parking lot, except you have to wait longer and you pay a lot more. The wings would be on this list, and they are plain not good. Basically, go for deep dish pizza and decent beer; but sit at the bar if you want a chance at decent service.  Better places for pizza, beer and wings (or 2/3): Deweys, Archers and Milanos."
Mike B.,"Dayton, OH",3,60,5,2.0,1/8/2015,"Stopped in to check out this restaurant which is relatively new to Dayton. Was there about 4:00 PM. Restaurant only had about 5 or 6 tables eating. Ordered a bacon cheeseburger and fries. The burger appeared  to be the puck type that comes out of a box. The bun was burnt so it made the sandwich taste sour. I would not recommend the burgers here at all. For less than $14.21 the are much better options for a lot less(Slyders, Pine Club).  The only thing that gets this restaurant a second star is a great selection of craft beers and the clean atmosphere. I may come back to try another dish but I doubt it."
Jason S.,"Fairborn, OH",36,16,2,5.0,5/21/2016,Great experience.  They have a huge Craft beer selection that the server was very knowledgeable about. We ordered several appetizers and all were wonderful.  I cannot compliment the server enough he was wonderful everyone should visit BJs.
Sherry E.,"Springboro, OH",70,138,199,3.0,10/30/2013,"I have been here twice since this location opened and each visit was satisfactory. Our food was prepared adequately and the wait staff were average. BJ's reminds me of a typical chain restaurant; maybe like a cousin of Applebee's. Several selections varying from burgers to pasta, and even pizza. My favorite experience has been the cookie dessert. A personal pizza-sized baked cookie with ice cream on top. Mmmm. BJ's has a large beer selection that the franchise apparently owns/ brews in some location unknown to me and ships to its restaurants. Although the beer is a somewhat neat and unique marketing ploy, I find the experience a bit over saturating. IMO, a beer crafter finds a style of beer and perfects it. BJ's has attempted to create every type of beer on earth. It makes their beer expertise feel too diluted. A side note to the manager: you would make more money off of me if you offered happy hour to the entire front of the house and not just the bar. After discovering that dinning room guests are excluded from the benefit of happy hour, I have vowed to never buy beer or an appetizer during happy hour. We often get an appetizer and I usually drink beer when we eat out, but never again here."
Oliver R.,"Philadelphia, PA",5,69,41,2.0,11/9/2013,"This is just another in along line of typical chain restaurants. This place is a cross between Fridays, O'Charley's and Applebee's.  We stopped in for a late lunch. We had the avocado egg rolls, one small pizza, one soup and salad combo, one drink and one beer. Our total bill was $49. Decor: It is a nice place. It is very clean and the TVs are not overpowering. They are there and you notice them but you are not forced to look at them all the time.  Food: Average and pricey. See above for what we ordered. Service: This being a chain restaurant I know that service is hit or miss. Either you get a good server or you do not. In this case, we did not. We had to ask for water four times before any water was served. The waiter seemed very rushed and did not offer ideas or explain what BJs was all about. Our experience was more of a ""what do you want"" versus the server talking to us to offer suggestions and guide us through our meal. Not all servers are the same and I'm sure there are others that are great."
Marci J.,"Dayton, OH",7,4,,4.0,9/12/2015,Loved the enlightened menu but all restaurants need to pay more attention to their carry out patrons. They need to package them appropriately. My meal should have been in a bowl not such a huge box. They need to work on presentation to go with their food. Magi was just a tad too done. Broth had lots of flavor.
Juli C.,"Gilroy, CA",0,9,,2.0,11/5/2016,"Poor Service twice in a row when restaurant was quite empty. Once for Sunday lunch and the 2nd an early Friday lunch.  Waited over 30 minutes each time after ordering dessert and our server completely disappeared both times.  Had to chase one down as we both had to return to work, no apology, no dessert!  Sad because food is good but the service ruins the experience.  Two times in a row within a few weeks of visiting sends a message about the lack of strong operation."
Steve K.,"Springboro, OH",0,4,,1.0,10/25/2016,"Arrived for dinner around 7pm on a Tuesday. Service was slow, they were out of the first 2 appetizers we ordered, food took over 30min to arrive at the table, and the salad I had ordered with my entree was delivered after the food arrived. Refills were slow and only after requested. BJs was offering a free dessert with the purchase of an entree, which seemed to be an inconvenience and surprise for our server when we inquired. Once the entrees did arrive, the side items were cold and my steak was lukewarm. Spent over $100 on a very poor experience, which I did go on their website and communicate a week ago, provided my email and phone number... no response or contact by BJs to date. They clearly are not interested in their guest's feedback nor care about the issues or concerns."
Aimee P.,"Springboro, OH",35,3,9,1.0,11/14/2014,"Went to BJ's to celebrate signing the lease of our new apartment with my new roommate.  SERVICE-We were not told ahead of time that Happy Hour specials were served only in the bar area. So after sitting ten minutes in the dining room waiting for someone, anyone, to take our drink order, we flagged down a server and asked where we could find a listing for Happy Hour. She responded that we needed to be seated in the bar to receive those and seemed annoyed that we asked. We moved and were quickly greeted by a new server. She started out really strong with great service, unfortunately that level of service dropped off as our visit grew longer. She became less attentive with each question we asked. It got to the point that we decided to end our visit even though there were more items we wanted to try. We felt rushed and not welcomed.   FOOD-the menu is pretty good sized, maybe too big for its own good. It took quite a long time for our appetizers to come out once we placed our order. I have been in the restaurant industry for 25+ years and know it shouldn't take a half hour for apps to come out. I had the California Club Flatbread. It was ok. Not great, not terrible. The blend of flavors was good, but the amount of toppings was off. The avocado was nearly non-existent. I had a glass of the Berry Burst Cider, and that was definitely the highlight of the evening. It was fresh tasting and filled with delicious fruit flavors. This cider is well done! But once again, I think the beer menu may be a bit ambitious as it offers so many variables it can be difficult to decide. For dessert, we split the peach cobbler and it was simply divine, but it took entirely too long for it to be served.  ATMOSPHERE-The restaurant is clean and well maintained. It is what I would call classy casual. Nothing stood out as unique or exciting-just a nice looking, shiny place to eat. Overall, I was extremely disappointed with BJ's. The food is not worth the price we paid for it and the service was simply not up to par. I was expecting a lot more bang for my buck, and as such, will not be making a return trip unless it happens to be on someone else's dime because they sure will not be getting another dime from me."
Kathleen C.,"Miamisburg, OH",35,61,14,4.0,11/5/2013,"Food was good. Avocado egg rolls are good for an appetizer. My husband loved the beer sampler and that you can choose the number of samples. The place is big enough that you don't have to wait long to be seated (on a weekday).  I had the pulled pork sandwich with wedge fries. The fries are really good. Sandwich was good as well. Nothing unique, but good. My husband had the wings. He LOVES wings and said they were really good.  The service was fine. Not great, but not bad. But we are not high maintenance customers.  We would go back. At minimum for appetizers and drinks."
Linda S.,"Utica, MI",17,18,2,5.0,1/2/2016,"We got the gluten-free pizza, which is exellent, the crust has a blend of spices that makes it different and yummy! I also had the GF chocolate chip cookie with a scoop of ice cream, so delicious. Great service and food make this a must stop when in the Dayton, OH area!"
Sidney S.,"Dayton, OH",66,101,45,1.0,9/22/2014,"I dined with a party of around 8, had great service no problems there whatsoever.  BUT I'm at a restaurant ultimately for the food!! 3rd time's a charm, and let me say they did not bring the magic.  For the 3rd time in a row I received COLD food here at BJs. I ordered the pot-stickers, shared with my table. I was not the first one to comment on how cold they were. Not to mention there were no chopsticks (personal problem on my part tho haha) I ordered shrimp tacos, they were also COLD. It came with nearly a head of shredded iceburg lettuce (yuck) and my shrimps were undoubtedly a frozen-farm-raised type that was not enjoyable whatsoever even if they had not been cold.  Count me out of any future eating here. I will, however, still come for drinks if invited! It is a nice large and lively atmosphere with lots of libations to choose from."
Cindy D.,"Springboro, OH",0,5,,5.0,10/5/2016,I absolutely love this restaurant. I first tried it in OK and was so excited to see it come to the Miami Valley area!  Lots of variety and each selection has been delicious.  Friendly and efficient staff too!
