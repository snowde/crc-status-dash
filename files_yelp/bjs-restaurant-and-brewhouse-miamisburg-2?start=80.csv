Samantha B.,"Springboro, OH",0,10,,4.0,10/4/2016,"Went here with family to celebrate a birthday... The food was good, but the service was kind of slow."
Sharon P.,"Dayton, OH",0,8,,3.0,10/2/2016,Early evening dinner on a Sunday. We just ordered burgers and fries.  Our favorite burger place is Rusty Bucket. We should have gone there. We were both disappointed. Burgers were very dry. Fries were just okay. Service was good.
Melissa D.,"Fairborn, OH",27,26,25,2.0,9/5/2014,Normally I have a lot to say.  Only one word describes our experience tonight: meh. Beer: Big selection! Impressive. But the BJ brand beer was pretty meh.  Tried several and nothing stood out. Drive the extra 5-10 minutes to Miamisburg and enjoy Lucky Star or Star City Breweries. Food: The food was.... Meh.  The pizza did not impress.  Say home and order Jet's.  Better value for the money.  The scallops were bland and smothered in pepper.   Service: Our waiter was nice.   There are better places to go.  Probably won't be back.
Ken H.,"Mundelein, IL",1,11,1,5.0,11/3/2015,"I have been here several times.  The beer was good and the food was good. I realized when I sat at the bar that this place is even better than I had experienced in the past. First of all, the happy hour mini pizza rocks, great price, great flavor (even the crust & I'm from Chicago)!  The beer selection is far better than the printed menu suggests. This is a problem for the place since the printed menu is probably always out-of-date, but their beer selection is outstanding.   For me it's not a negative because I should know that a place like this has more than a printed menu would indicate.  They had great regional beers that I never saw in print.  While I stick to beer at what I perceive to be a beer place, the hard liquor selection looked good.  Hey, if you want great beer, exceptional bar food, in a lively but conversational locale, this is Your happy place."
Timothy S.,"Plainfield, IL",0,5,,4.0,3/11/2016,"I really enjoy this place because of the wide variety of beer and food. Everything I've had has turned out great. The Crispy jalapeño Burger, New  Orleans jambalaya, Chicken Club Sandwich, and the Italian Pizza are great. Love them all. I prefer the Nutty Brewnette to wash it down too. Great Beer and Great Food for a wonderful price!"
Ben H.,"Springboro, OH",294,34,,3.0,12/12/2015,Beers are good food is decent - seems a bit overpriced & I have not had anything that I would recommend or want to have again.  Always crowded though?
Anton B.,"Dayton, OH",0,6,26,1.0,2/22/2016,"My wife and I went a week ago and although it just opened is already challenged.  Host didn't greet us just waited for us to walk up to them and ask if we could be seated.  She seemed challenged by it so we went to the bar.  2 bartenders behind bar with 4 people sitting ant the bar and it took 5 minutes to get greeted.  My wife asked about a special drink and bartender gave us menus to review.  My wife liked the Non-Alcoholic Mocktail combination of Monin Raspberry syrup and club soda and asked if she could have her vodka drink with a combination like that.  I ordered vodka and club soda.  My drink was $7.  Her drink of vodka and club soda was $7 then they charged us an additional $3 for a squeeze of the Monin raspberry syrup.  Come on, that whole bottle costs $3.  We had moved to a table by the time we got our check and asked the server to review the additional charge and we could see him walk over and stand behind the manager on the phone for 18 minutes...literally, we timed it.  When the  manager came over he wanted to debate the $3 charge as he said ""the specialty drink is very involved to make and that's why it costs the extra price""  I asked what was in it besides ice, club soda and a squeeze of the syrup.  He said it didn't matter it was just a very involved drink to make.  I asked again and he said that he didn't know but that they were very difficult to make. He then advised us that we should've ordered it a different way and we wouldn't have gotten charged for it.  He awkwardly made us feel like it was our fault and he was doing us a favor by removing a $3 charge for about $0.10 worth of syrup.   We also ordered the Brussels Sprout and they were burned and REALLY, really salty.  We were going to re-order them but server could not be found.  We were looking around for about 10 minutes when a different server came over and asked us about it.  She never apologized, she just said she would tell the server.  Calamari also overcooked and this dish had NO salt.  It really seemed that the cook had forgotten and seasoned the Sprouts twice and not the calamari.  The Club Flatbread however was very good. We won't be back anytime soon."
Karissa E.,"Maineville, OH",27,1,,2.0,2/20/2016,"Giving his place 2 stars because the food is hit or miss and the same can be said for the service. Pros: First visit.... The queso was really great, bbq brisket burger is awesome, fish and chips were excellent, drinks were to be expected. Cons: Second visit.... We called ahead and were told that it's not their policy to allow call ahead for a party of 8 and that the wait would be 2 hours even though it was almost 9:30 by the time we arrived and not a prime hour for business... called back and manager informed me that 2 hrs was an inaccurate assessment and they would try to get us seated since we were giving an hour notice. Fair enough. Arrived when no one was waiting and was seated within 30 min which is much better than the original 2 hrs quoted. My husband ordered the sirloin med-well and it came out dry and closer to well-done. I ordered the Santa Fe salad and it came missing several items such as cheese, corn, and tortillas on top. The food was dropped off by runners who quickly ran off without asking if we needed anything else. Waiters are always running around when it wasn't even busy and acting put out if we asked them for something. When we finally caught the waiter who was avoiding our table, we kindly asked the for another steak and they obliged but it came after everyone was finished eating. We weren't given anything for our trouble but an apology which is great and all but when you can't even enjoy your meal with your family and have to hurry up to eat after everyone is finished, what's the point? To summarize.... This place is great if you want just drinks and appetizers but don't expect excellent service and get used to having to flag down your server if you need anything because they've probably checked out by the end of the night."
Chris M.,"Quinnesec, MI",1,25,,4.0,7/13/2016,Went with a large group so we made a reservation. Waitress came right away and took a drink order which was quickly served. Took the food order and came back to check several times for addition refills before the food came. Everyone was served their food together which was good. Portions were good size and food was good. Their beer was good too. Would recommend trying it out.
Michael G.,"Dayton, OH",1,5,,5.0,11/12/2015,Been there several times I've had everything for barbecue chicken to the chicken fettuccine to Pizza the root beer is awesome definitely recommend this place it's a little pricey or than an Applebee's but not quite as expensive as say Montgomery Inn but definitely a good place to eat good service good food
FreshTake '.,"Catonsville, MD",1,50,2,4.0,12/24/2014,"All the appetizers have really good flavor,  I love the mini bruscetta.the dessert pzookies are really good as well.   We had really good service sitting at a booth in the bar. The mojitos were good,  had enough alcohol and weren't watered down like at brio :/ I haven't actually eaten many of the entrees so I'm not a fair judge of that but I love the atmosphere.   My main complaint is that happy hour ends at 7 pm. I know that's probably typical but it's crappy for any one who works late than 5..."
David M.,"Dayton, OH",0,5,1,4.0,2/6/2016,The parmesan crusted chicken is fantastic. Their pizza is very good as well. The Jeremiah red beer is excellent. Highly recommend.
Jamie A.,"Hamilton, OH",22,147,23,4.0,5/17/2014,"Good food and friendly service! We went on a Friday night around 6pm... The place was packed and we had to wait about an hour for our table.  Our waitress (Elizabeth) was incredibly sweet and chatty. We had drinks and an appetizer not too long after we sat down.  I had the Jack's Berry Lemonade - it was a strong drink and a little too sour but still really good. My husband ordered a Long Beach Ice Tea that he wound up not drinking (said it was too strong) and luckily, they took that drink off our bill.  The drinks are expensive. They were all close to $10 each - which I didn't realize until after I had ordered a Strawberry Splash (frozen and delicious!) We had some mozzerella sticks that were a little lacking in the cheese department but the breading was so good, you didn't notice too much.  We split a deep dish pizza with pepperoni and italian sausage. I LOVE their pizzas. So, so good.  Over the years, I have had a wide variety of items from their menu and have never been disappointed with any of it.  Our service slowed down significantly halfway thru the meal but the place was still busy. Our waitress was absolutely the nicest at all times.  We took most of our pizza to go but it was worth it.  2 boozey beverages, root beer, salad, mozzerella sticks, and a large deep dish was over $70 plus a hefty tip. It was an expensive meal but we were celebrating with friends and it was worth it. I would recommend going for lunch as their lunch specials are much cheaper!"
Dwaine B.,"Dayton, OH",0,1,,2.0,6/7/2016,Went on a Sunday at 5pm. Got a table right away even with A party of 7. Put in our order in a timely manner. After that it was downhill. Not one time did a server come back to ask if we needed anything. Not even A refill on drinks. Five out of my party of 7 left because they had to be somewhere and two of us sat there and waited on the bill for 10 minutes with the waiter walking by numerous times.
Heidi K.,"Bellbrook, OH",26,7,,3.0,10/11/2015,Great food and great beer....but I find it absolutely ridiculous that they don't want to fill growlers that are not their own. Shady.
Ryan H.,"Portland, OR",5,43,22,2.0,2/23/2014,"Well, this is another case of money spent making a place look good, but forgetting that the food should BE GOOD. We ordered avocado spring rolls as an app, there was no crunch, a mouth full of mush, needs to have some chunks and something to give some crunch, maybe some rice noodles.  Entrees were spaghetti and meat sauce, and some kind of creamy chicken pasta dish. The meat sauce was so bland, and thin. None of the sauce stuck to the noodles, and it was so boring. The creamy dish had rigatoni or penne and chicken, the noodles were grossly overcooked, inedible, we had it taken off the bill, my wife left hungry and had stop at Panera on the way home for something to eat. On top of bad food, our server was MIA most of the meal, so other than a nice looking dining room there is nothing to this place. It was like trying to have a conversation with a beautiful woman/man that has nothing intelligent to say. I would have rather gone to Outback."
Michele P.,"Dayton, OH",2,6,,2.0,5/4/2015,"Only go if you don't have time restrictions. Service is slow - everything from getting orders taken, refills on drinks, and food. Food is okay, but not worth the slow service."
Doug B.,"Jackson, MI",46,69,6,2.0,2/7/2014,"Took the advice of a local and gave this place a chance.  Foot came very quickly which left me wondering how fresh it was.  We were placed at a table next to what appeared to be the employee day-off table.  A couple of loud mouths holding a table by sipping their waters and providing a place for the waiters and waitresses to stop by, sit down, and take a load off.  It was great seeing my waiter at their table while our drinks sat empty. Left wondering if he'll figure out why his tip was as empty as my drink glass.   My advice:  keep driving on by this one."
Bethany B.,"Dayton, OH",63,44,81,2.0,2/14/2015,BJs Brewery was a favorite spot for my husband and I. I loved the pasta with artichokes and he loves the pizza and the Hefe. So Valentines Day where do we choose to go ... BJs! We find that they had a menu change and my trusted favorite pasta was gone . So I order a steak cooked medium well with a little pink through it. We wait (a long time) but we have a appetizer so .. It's all good. 2nd steak comes out ... I cut it and the waitress says OMG there's no pink in that steak again. Now I'm a little frustrated but just ask to have it removed. The manager comes to apologize but when the bill is brought to me they charged me for two steaks and only remove one (neither were eaten)! Wait again to have it removed .. We get our bill and I'm thinking Geez ... At least comp ONE of the beers ... Nope! We paid our bill .. Left and guess what .... I won't be back.
Brian H.,"Cincinnati, OH",52,146,86,4.0,9/6/2015,Been here several times now and the food is always consistent and the staff very friendly. They have the biggest selection of foods to pick from there's something for everyone's taste. My only complaint would be the price of their beer. It's over priced for the amount you get and while it's decent it's nothing spectacular. If you like pizza you won't go wrong with any of their pizzas as it's what their business was built on.
