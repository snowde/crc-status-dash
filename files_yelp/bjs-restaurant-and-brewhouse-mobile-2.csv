Joan G.,"Union City, GA",130,20,86,4.0,10/29/2017,"Bj's is cool place to stop in for a quick bite and cocktails. A really nice looking Restuarant very inviting aesthetics. Parking is plentiful and free for all. There is not valet. When walking in there is a free standing sign listing daily specials for each day of the week. The hostess were front and center ready to seat you or direct you to the bar area depending on your preference.  Very nice clean looking restaurant. The bar caught my eye immediately due to the large lighted color coded liquor wall case. It's is very pretty and organized display. Although I was there for lunch I couldn't help but wonder what happy hour or an evening bar area mingling would be like.  The menu had tons of options. Recommendations made me to me were the pizzas, jambalaya, lemon thyme chicken but of course I figured since it was a steakhouse I should try a steak first. Everything appeared to be a good options. Sirloin with asparagus and bowl of lentil soup was the final choice.  The medium prepared sirloin was decent but wasn't what I expected for a steakhouse. Perhaps I should have chosen a different cut of steak. The lentil soup was good similarity to chili in taste. My mother went with the spaghetti and meatballs which was pretty tasty.  I ended up coming back a few days later and just as I thought the bar area was crowded and definitely the place to be. Seating in the bar area is first come first serve booths and all. I will definitely return to try the lemon thyme chicken. Until then Bj's!!"
Alexandra F.,"Mobile, AL",44,60,143,3.0,7/14/2017,"UPDATE: While I still stand by everything I said in my first review, I will be bumping them from 1 star to 3. My boyfriend had his birthday dinner here so I decided to give them another try. We ordered the app platter that included wings, spinach dip, mozzarella sticks, and spring rolls. I really liked the wings (get the ones with the root beer glaze), but not much else on the platter. For dinner I ordered the California chicken club, which was very good, and this time I decided to stick with the side that came with it: fries. They were a fully packed restaurant this night but it still took a very long time (longer than normal for a full restaurant) to get our food. I do like how they have many options for my boyfriend as he is a vegetarian and he enjoyed his meal. Because of the fact that there aren't many places to eat in Mobile that are vegetarian friendly, I'm sure we'll be back at some point.  I honestly don't know where to begin with this place. My brother, mother, and I went here for a late lunch/early dinner around 4:15. We were seated right away but had to wait about ten minutes for drinks after we ordered them. It is important to note that at this point there were six tables, including ours, in the entire restaurant. No one at the bar. Six tables. So after we get our drinks we order. My brother ordered fish tacos, mom got the quinoa bowl, and I got the jalapeño burger with a baked potato. We order and we're waiting, and waiting, and waiting. After we ordered we waited for 45 minutes for our food. Now I know that at peek dinner rush in a big restaurant 45 minutes isn't unheard of. But it's now 5:00, and there are six tables in the entire restaurant. We finally get our food and I'm not pleased. Usually when you order a baked potato it comes loaded, unless you say otherwise. Well this one came slathered with sour cream, and a tiny spoon of butter that I almost didn't see due to the sour cream. You may be thinking well why didn't I just ask our waitress to fix it? Because I was really hungry when we got there and now I was feeling sick so I ate what I had. Moving on to the burger, to say I was disappointed is an understatement. Between the fried jalapeños and the chipotle mayo I was expecting spicy. I did not get spicy. What I got was a grease trap. The kind of thing were you take a bite of it and grease pours down your fingers. I couldn't finish it because the grease was making me the kind of sick where you eat a bunch of fried stuff and eventually you start to feel like you're the grease trap.  We complained about the wait to our waitress and she did nothing. Didn't bring a manager, didn't ask if we would like to speak to one, didn't offer us any compensation. I honestly don't think I will ever come back here, which is a shame because I really had high hopes for it."
Randall F.,"Satsuma, AL",1,17,38,4.0,1/3/2018,"I started with cheese curds,  then had the southern comfort chicken sandwich. The food was very good, however the service started off great then I felt we were forgotten. My drink stayed empty for awhile, I finally went to the bar to got a refill myself. While I was getting my refill I did get to meet Chris the bartender, he was nice and cheerful so I was able to forget about my thirst. When I got back to the table there was another Dr Pepper waiting for me. All in all good food nice people just the one flaw. If they would have been busy I wouldn't have said anything."
Lena S.,"Mobile, AL",21,93,113,4.0,6/3/2017,Many of the post complain about the customer service in this place but everyone from the front of the house to the back were SOOOOO nice. Very accommodating. We were initially seated at a tiny table. The waitress noticed how cramp we were with our big hips and big purses and immediately sprung into action to move us. Then when she left to get our drinks the front host that seated us noticed we were alone and stopped to make sure we had been greeted by our waitress and that our drink order had been taken. We thought that was so considerate seeing that after seating guest with their menus and silverware you normally never see the front hostess again.  The menu is extensive. Lots to choose from. I chose a lite fare(ahi with shrimp) with water. I was happy they allowed me to flavor my water with cucumber and lime. My dinner companion had Parmesan crusted chicken and potatoes. I'm assuming it was awesome because she left nothing on the plate. I ended up taking most of mine home but I must say the flavors were bursting.  So much to choose from I have to come back with my honey.  I'm giving four stars because the seating situation is terrible. I saw 3 men hanging off the edge of 3 different booths all at the same time. They tried to cram 6+ people in each booth and it was not working. I can see how uncomfortable each party was as they tried to enjoy their food. If they could rectify the seating situation this place would be top notch. And I'm normally and anti-chain-restaurant person. But I'm digging BJ's!
Ashley H.,"Mobile, AL",1908,594,3776,5.0,4/23/2017,"We decided to give this place a try last week after seeing some great reviews.   We started with poke, which consisted of chucks of sashimi grade tuna, avocado, and onions, etc, covered in poke sauce. It was served with pita chips. It was absolutely delicious, but I love anything with tuna and avocado, so no surprise I loved it.  So many things on the menu sounded amazing, and I can't wait to go back and try more dishes.  We ordered a deep dish pizza upon the recommendation of some nice ladies we met while waiting for our table. It was deep dish pizza, covered in toppings and light on sauce.  My son said it's his new favorite pizza.   My hubs was pleased with their beer selection.  He had a Duvel and a BJ's Brewhouse IPA.  I had a strawberry mojito, and it was well prepared, not skimpy on the alcohol.   Our waiter was really cool and service was fantastic.  We don't eat at chain restaurants often, but I can see us frequently visiting this one."
Michelle L.,"Mobile, AL",158,86,174,4.0,6/17/2017,BJs was an awesome experience! I tried the Maple Salmon Pita Tacos and it was a great blend of flavors. I also tried the four beet taster. The ACE pineapple cider was my favorite. The spinach dip appetizer was great. Our waiter Matthew W. was great! He answered all of our questions about the beers on tap and got our orders out to us quickly. I will definitely visit again.
Jennifer P.,"Mobile, AL",38,28,12,5.0,11/13/2017,Had the light menu and did NOT get the usual cardboard offerings.   It was tasty and flavorful with plenty of spice.   The chicken was moist and not dry at all.  The berry cidar was so amazing... and pink.  LOL!  Coming back soon and I'm not an out to eat person!
Kimberly R.,"Mobile, AL",54,9,7,5.0,10/29/2017,This is one of my favorite restaurants in Mobile.  Their specialties are burgers & pizzas.  We ordered the prime rib.  Not tender enough for hubby so they swapped it  out for the rib eye.  OMG! It was delicious!  We inhaled it so quickly I was unable to take a pic!  The berry burst cider is the bomb too!  Gotta try it!
Krista R.,"Satsuma, AL",81,65,124,5.0,9/30/2017,"Yum! You have to go here! From outstanding service (ask for Grant ) to a wall full of draft beer, this place is top notch. I got the parmesan chicken with cheese on it. And then don't forget the pizookie dessert! Different options of cookies baked in a cast iron skillet! This is my new favorite restaurant!"
Karla A.,"Mobile, AL",58,89,83,5.0,4/6/2017,"Open FOUR days and so far so good. I'm a fan of BJ's Brewhouse in South Center in Kent WA.  It's a great place for good food, great drinks and killer brews.  If you come anytime soon please be kind and know that they are still in training.  Don't be quick to judge the service or the kitchen. So far so good in my book and I worked in the food service industry so be kind and you don't be disappointed."
Harmony G.,"Sunnyvale, CA",0,7,,1.0,11/29/2017,"Well their menu looks great but we wouldn't know if the food was good or not because apparently no one wanted to serve us. Went in for lunch starving with two kids. They sat us, it was pretty empty, but no one ever came over to even take a drink order or say we'll be right with you until we stood up to leave someone said your server will be right over. Sorry we ran out of time waiting for someone."
John C.,"Mobile, AL",1,28,,3.0,12/5/2017,"Three of us had beers and pizza, Nashville chicken sandwich and a salad. The pizza was oily and mostly bread, like a biscuit...tasted ok but not wonderful. Son said chicken was decent. So thats a fail. I could tell it was just ok. Some folks say other menu options are good. We just saw what we saw... Service was nice...beer was really good. I will post updates if I go back."
Ray S.,"Daphne, AL",19,332,40,3.0,8/15/2017,"I've been to a few other BJ locations and nothing particularly stands out about this place. Yes they have a big menu. Yes they have an extensive beer selection (yet no Corona to have with tacos). Service wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great. We sat in the bar area on a Friday afternoon/evening and our server was very friendly, but she wasn't around that much. All the pizzas we ordered came out quickly but were just average. Overall for Mobile, it's borderline great, but compared to the rest of the US, it's just average."
Tanisha B.,"Pinewood, Mobile, AL",117,6,,4.0,12/1/2017,Chill atmosphere. Nice drink choices! I will definitely be back for meals.awesome! Awesome!
Evetta I.,"Eight Mile, AL",0,4,1,4.0,12/1/2017,Good spot with a big menu. Perfect when you and your friends or significant other want different things.
Kenneth F.,"Mobile, AL",21,37,5,3.0,8/12/2017,"The food is okay quality. My steak was noticeably undercooked, but I tolerated it. They have many beers here and a lot of drinks to try. Everything seems a little overpriced to me, and pizza seems like a weird thing for a place like this to be popular for. Anyways everything is just okay."
Dave T.,"Mobile, AL",62,4,,5.0,11/16/2017,"Fourth visit in a month!  Have had different entrees and sides each time.  Food hot, flavorful, and generous portions.  Have had excellent service each time.  Audrey and Cheslea were great!"
Jasmine F.,"Mobile, AL",38,13,1,5.0,11/25/2017,"I enjoyed the food and the service was also great. We ordered the avocado egg roll for an appetizer and it was absolutely delicious. For my entree I ordered the chicken fried steak burger just to try something different. It was a large portion and I barely finished half of the burger. My husband ordered a burger as well and enjoyed. I will definetly be back again to try more menu items. I am not a beer drinker but it's one of their specialties along with burgers and pizzas. I also enjoyed the ""laid back"" atmosphere of the restaurant."
David C.,"Mobile, AL",89,14,31,5.0,7/8/2017,"Looking for a great burgers, steak, or pizza coupled with a vast selection of beers in a cool relaxed enviroment? Look no further than BJ's.  In my first visit to BJ's I was with a large group (about 20) that had made a reservation. When we arrived we're told we would be waiting just a few minutes. Soon after they came with Pizza samples for all those waiting in line in order to assure no ones hunger got the best of them. After about 20 mins of waiting the manger came to us and apologized with a gift card. Soon after we were seated. The service was fantastic! Our waiter was good with everyone in our group from the oldest (80's) to youngest (8). I had the ""Black and Bluehouse"" burger. Being the sucker that I am for blue cheese I couldn't resist. When it came I was delighted by its taste, portion size, and wasn't offended by its price. Overall BJ's was a great experience I can't wait for the fall as I think I will soon be Mobile's hottest place to catch the game!"
Don K.,"Birmingham, AL",0,2,,5.0,10/29/2017,"Excellent food, service, menu choices, and beer selection.   I had the deep dish ziti.  Loved it."
Shane H.,"Mobile, AL",17,88,81,5.0,7/14/2017,"Well, this has become our weekly thing. I'm telling you right now, this is hands down the best thing going in Mobile. We have yet to get a bad dish or service. Normally with a menu as large as theirs it's difficult to do everything well. BJ's has done that very thing. It's become my obsession to work my way through the entire menu. Tonight my wife went with the steak and garlic green beans and I went with the full rack of baby backs with the sauteed brussel sprouts. We started out with the trioof small plates and we chose the turmeric cauliflower, parmesan carrots and the golden beets with goat cheese. Outstanding! My wife said that the Turmeric roasted cauliflower with lentils and almonds was her new favorite. Our server, Sabrina is the absolute best. Their manager Celeste is the greatest. She has a great restaurant with a great staff and she's doing it right. I will post our pictures. Now as I have said before, if you haven't been for whatever reason, GO..The food and drink selection is one of the best in Mobile!"
Britt D.,"Mobile, AL",1,6,17,2.0,5/18/2017,"I'm always glad to have new restaurants open up in Mobile, but this one won't make my list to visit regularly. I'm pretty sure the servers don't like the bartenders because they won't run their food for them. If you don't mind waiting on the food or strictly want drinks - sit at the bar, but the bartender informed us they aren't allowed to leave the bar so don't expect a quick meal otherwise.  Chocolate Chip Cookie pozukie is pretty awesome. Don't waste your time with the soba noodles."
James S.,"Mobile, AL",87,5,8,5.0,4/6/2017,"The food was phenomenal. The drink I had was out of this world. The selections were crazy! 50 draft beers, not to mention the cocktails and margaritas, etc. Ambience was lovely, TVs all over the restaurant. Plenty of parking. If I had one thing to critique, it would be the service. Our server was confused. Didn't know a thing about the menu. Had to run and ask for assistance throughout the ordering process, which is understandable considering they opened less than a week ago. She also continuously kept complaining about how tired she was and how sore her feet were? I'm a server too, and rule #1 is no matter how bad a day you're having, you don't let your tables know. Overall, wonderful experience! I highly recommend. We will be back!"
Jerome R.,"Mobile, AL",0,2,,5.0,4/8/2017,"My fiancé and I ate here on their fifth day being open and you'd think they had been open and functioning for years. The service was among the best I've ever had. Every waiter or waitress who passed by our table said hello and smiled. A man by the name of Miles was our waiter and he was entertaining, energetic, knowledgeable, and above all service oriented-he went above and beyond!  LOTS OF CRAFT BEERS AND GREAT COCKTAILS!  I had the Hefeweizen beer, and an American Mule....both are incredible!!  The food was incredible! I had the prime rib which was very juicy and flavorful. The horseradish dipping sauce was not overpowering, yet provided just the right amount of kick to where your taste buds will recognize the taste. The steamed mixed veggies were very fresh, not soggy, and not too hard. Their cheese mashed potatoes are very tasty and taste authentic. Finally, the pazooki is without a doubt an awesome dessert to top of an already feast of a meal. It's a large cookie-several different kinds-that tastes freshly baked and are served warm with a scoop of ice cream on top. It's large enough to split between two people. Don't leave without at least getting it to go...it's the bomb.  I will be a lifelong customer!"
Laura C.,"Mobile, AL",45,47,16,5.0,9/19/2017,"Had really great service and good food. Our server was fast, friendly and happy to recommend a few dishes to us. For the amount of food and good service I'd say the prices are fair. Plenty of beers on tap to choose from. The wait to get a table on a weeknight was nothing. I'll be back."
Kristine K.,"Mobile, AL",36,4,3,1.0,4/18/2017,"I was required to give one star. I guess that one star can be for the spinach dip. But, that's all. Thirty minutes for our drink order to be taken. Forty five minutes for our drinks to arrive and my drink was incorrect. Ten minutes later I was able to get a server's attention (not ours) to correct the drink. Ten minutes later another server brought what was supposed to be a sparkling raspberry lemonade. There is no ""sparkle"" at all to it. Five minutes later another server brought me another drink which was totally different and told me it was a sparkling raspberry lemonade. Ok? It was sparkling either. Ordered the appetizer combo after sitting for over forty-five minutes. Twenty minutes later it arrived. Cold. The only think on it that was good was the spinach dip. Chicken was fried gristle. Mozzarella sticks were cold. Eggrolls did not even closely resemble their picture on the menu, not to mention the unidentifiable mush inside them. So, over an hour later for lunch on a Tuesday, with only one adult and two kids, I paid almost $40 and left hungry and irritated. Never again."
Gilbert D.,"Helena, AL",0,9,3,5.0,7/21/2017,Food and service was excellent! Tchlinda (I'm probably spelling it wrong..sorry) was an excellent host and had a very good attitude.  The quinoa shrimp bowls was delicious!
Dan J.,"Mobile, AL",6,27,5,3.0,12/13/2017,"I've been here about 4 times for dinner and always had to wait a while for simple things, like taking our drink order or getting the check. I feel the service could improve a lot."
Joe B.,"Ocean Springs, MS",0,24,,4.0,9/17/2017,"Very nice and new concept in the desert  of Mobile Alabama.  The menu was presented well and had  a large variety of items to select from. Not an advid beer guy, their selection of beer was vast and impressive. I would recommend this Resturant to anyone looking for a ""non-Alabama' experience."
Allyson L.,"Mobile, AL",45,21,,4.0,10/3/2017,First time going and I'll def return. I enjoyed my burger and the BJ Amber beer was tasty. There are lots to offer on the menu so I foresee several trips in my future.
Hannah B.,"Millers Creek, Mobile, AL",23,1,,2.0,12/9/2017,"I don't think I've ever been as disappointed in a restaurant experience than I was with BJ's tonight. It was pretty packed, but it was a Saturday night and we had no issues with waiting the expected 30 minutes the hostess told us it would be. When we got to our table the hostess had forgotten the silverware and said she'd be right back, we never saw her again. That's fine, our waitress will bring them to us, whenever our waitress actually comes to our table, that is. After sitting for awhile another waitress lets us know ours will be right with us. When she gets there we order two waters and a beer and say we need a few extra minutes to look over the huge menu. She brings the water, no beer, and after twenty minutes we're able to get her attention and she brings the beer, but doesn't take our order even though we're ready. We sit and wait at least 20 more minutes and I hear the couple behind us ask another waiter to get their waitress (our waitress). She finally comes back and takes our (and the other couples') orders. We both got sirloin (medium) and broccoli cheddar soup. I got sweet potato fries and my husband got the mashed potatoes. The soup came first and I was happy with it, nothing special but it was soup. Remember the utensil issue I mentioned earlier? Our steak was brought to us by someone other than our waitress and we had no forks. After waiting an unreasonable amount of time my husband got up and walked to the back corner where she was and asked for forks. Finally, we're eating. Tyler cut into his supposed to be medium steak and it's dry and over cooked, mine seems okay, though. As we both keep eating it's like we switched steaks. They were so unevenly cooked that we both had half medium and half well done steaks. It was not appetizing. The sweet potato fries I had were mostly descent if you exclude the ones that didn't seem to be cooked all the way through. Neither of us finished our meal. Before leaving I stepped into the restroom where a worker was talking on her cell in a stall and she actually said ""I'm hiding out in the bathroom"". My husband plans on going back for the bar sometime and hopefully he'll be able to leave a better review but for now, based on their customer service and the badly cooked food, we don't recommend it at all."
Shawn B.,"Mobile, AL",2,16,46,5.0,5/6/2017,"Food was exceptionally good at BJ's, which is not uncommon. Have been to a couple different BJ's in different cities this one is new to mobile, AL. Happy hour drinks were delicious as well"
Lashelby C.,"Mobile, AL",0,2,,2.0,7/15/2017,Normally I love this place but recently the service is really terrible. Just the servers have attitudes and can't answer simple questions when i ask can my daughter sub her fries for something as simple as fruit. I know the answer is yes but I ask hey what fruit do you have cause she doesn't eat alot. Just know I will sit at the bar with some awesome bartenders from now on
Kyle R.,"Fort Walton Beach, FL",32,28,,4.0,9/12/2017,"Huge menu, good beer selection and decent place to watch sports. Nice variety of beer, you can order a taster paddle which is nice and they make their own beer which was pretty good. Tons of different food, took a while to actually pick what we wanted. They have a nice happy hour menu for the football games on Sunday as well."
Bill C.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,7,1,5.0,5/8/2017,"I was happy to see a BJs pop up in Mobile. It was our go-to favor in Colorado, and I really liked it. The main reason? The varied menu could keep or immediate and extended family very happy. I believe I have tried at least half the menu, and I would have to say I have enjoyed every single dish. I was happy to see that this location honors the same recipes, execution, and attention to service as all the other locations I've tried.  There are lower calorie options for those inclined, and they are every bit as tasty as any other menu item.  When I can't decide which great item I want, I'll order my usual: one of their flatbread appetizer pizzas and an order of there broiled Brussels sprouts with Sriracha.  Oh, and beer selection is always outstanding, with draft and specials on the big board.  I recommend this restaurant to anybody, without qualification."
Jef C.,"Gulf Shores, AL",0,5,,3.0,11/14/2017,"The food is good,some of it very good a tad bit pricey though. The service at the bar  has deteriorated some since opening particularly if you go on a weeknight after 9 p.m. they aren't exactly rude but aren't friendly either and give you the subtle impression that you are the only thing keeping them from leaving"
Janet R.,"Conroe, TX",3,15,11,5.0,7/3/2017,Immediate seating and great service during a busy holiday weekend. Our server was patient and attentive and the food was amazing. Two of us ordered the Southern Fried Chicken and another ordered the all-you-can-eat soup and salad. I was too hungry to snap a photo.
Connie H.,"Mobile, AL",58,100,39,2.0,5/15/2017,"Came in on Friday night it was a bit of a wait. So we sat in the bar area no wait. After sitting there for 15 min and wait staff everywhere no one acknowledged us I walked down to the managers and advises not even a drink order.  They assured me that they will get someone to help me after  about 5 min a lady came and took our drink order and advises Matt was our waiter. After another 10 mins the manager checked on us we still had not ordered. She looked our order and gave it to Matt. The food came shortly and it was very tasty, hot and fresh. The service was terrible. I advise the manager on the way out. She ran after me on the parking lot and offered her apologies and offered me a 25.00 gift card."
Hien H.,"Biloxi, MS",206,10,3,2.0,7/15/2017,"Food is mediocre. For the price that they are charging, it is not really worth it, but I shouldn't really expect more from a chain restaurant. Steak wasn't seasoned well. My side dish had rice in it and it was really hard."
Jewish J.,"Semmes, AL",1,20,4,5.0,5/24/2017,"Very good food and I sampled a house draft brew that was comparable to Blue Moon but it was on special.  No complaints at all. Burger with brisket is good, sampled the chicken club which waz very good. There is a huge assortment of food....you are sure to find something you have a taste for.  Desserts are in another category....anything with warm cookies and ice cream is an instant hit for me."
