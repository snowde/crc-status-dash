Alan B.,"Mobile, AL",15,5,2,4.0,5/30/2017,"Great beer selection. Pleasant surprise was the food. We just had appetizers but they were delicious, little pricey on the beer but all in all a nice place for a beer and better than average food."
Summer H.,"Mobile, AL",6,40,26,4.0,6/16/2017,Love the spinach artichoke dip!!  I had the Salmon and my husband had the burger...both excellent.  We will be back to try the pizza!
Justin S.,"Mobile, AL",172,7,9,3.0,7/2/2017,"Food was above average, but being a new place the service was very average.  In saying that management stepped up and comped a dessert in the process.  I have high hopes for a better future."
Morgan Leigh V.,"Mobile, AL",59,10,6,5.0,4/12/2017,"Since they have opened we have been twice! Both times we have been the service has been AMAZING, and the food is just as good! They have their own brews which you can sample and I chose the berry cider and my husband chose the blonde ale. The spinach stuffed mushrooms for an appetizer are delicious, and we have eatin the prime rib dip, the chicken bacon ranch pizza and the hickory brisket burger. The food comes out within minutes of being ordered and prices are pretty average. The only thing is that the menu is VERY overwhelming because there are so many things to choose from, other than that I see this as one of our late night bar spots!"
Brandon K.,"Mobile, AL",41,3,201,2.0,5/27/2017,"First time ever visiting BJs, was greeted by the hostess staff. When I went to the to go area. I saw a customer that was picking up a few orders she had placed. So I'm standing there patiently waiting and I notice the other waiters/waitresses talking to each other at the end of the bar. Keep in mind that the front of house manager is also there too. Two of the kitchen staff came out and went to the to go counter saw me waiting. Wasn't asked by them nor anyone if I was wanting to place an order. The woman in the to go area didn't seem notice nor care that I was waiting either. So I Ended up walking out."
Robert D.,"Mobile, AL",32,1,,5.0,4/8/2017,Great food and service.  The cookie dessert was outstanding! I highly recommend this restaurant.  The atmosphere was very cool!
Liz B.,"Ocean Springs, MS",0,16,,5.0,5/27/2017,Great atmosphere!  Ask for Remy. Great service. Salad and avocado egg rolls were tasty!
Amber E.,"Mobile, AL",0,5,2,3.0,6/9/2017,"Food was pretty good. Brussels sprouts were marinaded in a vinegar base, just roasted would have been better. At least that's my preference but it's always best to try new things. Sirloin was cooked as ordered, medium. Mashed potatoes were okay, but not made fresh. They had more of an instant taste to them. Overall it was good. Our server was awesome."
Margie B.,"Pell City, AL",34,1,,5.0,6/6/2017,"Ate here with my husband and daughter. Everything was  fabulous ! Food, drinks and service! I highly  recommend this place !!"
Matt D.,"Mobile, AL",0,6,,2.0,5/18/2017,"One word:  forgettable.   Drinks made with generic mixes.  An encyclopedia of a menu that promises all the wonder of a Hungry Man TV dinner.   Forced service from barely trained employees. If you manage to make it to desert without hanging yourself in the bathroom, try a Pizookie - no one can mess up a hot cookie with ice cream... not even BJs."
Leori P.,"Land O' Lakes, FL",35,37,1,1.0,7/30/2017,"I usually eat at BJs 1-2 times a week when I am out on the road or at home. Since this one has opened I have visited 9 times since April during my visits here in Mobile. I usually order car side to go and the woman who does the car side is exceptional. She has a pleasant personality and the absolute best customer service. This is where my compliments end. In the 9 times I've eaten here 8 of those times my order has been wrong or not fresh. I order the same thing each and every time I go ahi Tuna poke and some random entree. The poke is my absolute favorite. However once the chips were stale, twice I had 4 wonton chips, another time the Tuna wasn't fresh, and believe it or not twice I've had it with NO POKE sauce. This is pitiful considering most times when I go in they aren't even busy. Tonight was the last straw. After driving 5 hours into town and ordering (I went inside this time to make sure my food wouldn't be screwed up ) sure enough get to my hotel and absolutely no sauce. Just some raw tuna. Disgusted and now hungry I called back and got a half apology. So from now on I will no longer be visiting this establishment and will take my money else where."
Miles D.,"Auburn, AL",0,4,,5.0,4/22/2017,"I had the bacon-guacamole burger which came with beer-battered fries, both of which exceeded my expectations. The burger was a little messy, but tasted satisfactory; the fries were golden and cooked to absolute perfection. Our waitress also made a solid recommendation from their draft. The beer complimented the food very well. Finally, we also received a free dessert after simply downloading the restaurant's smartphone app, and I do declare the ""pizzookie"" (which is a warm cookie topped with ice cream and, in my case, salted caramel) is one of the top 3 desserts in the Mobile area."
Elizabeth G.,"Pensacola, FL",2,98,135,4.0,4/20/2017,"Bj,'s good food and environment for crowd groups.  If you want to enjoy a quiet dinner not the place,  I feel a little priced.  Steaks are good  and juicy.  Not much on anything else, greasy food has made me sick. Place is spacey. Not my top pick.  1-50 I'll keep it in the 30's."
Frank F.,"Mobile, AL",2,27,,5.0,6/12/2017,"Nice atmosphere, good food, cold beer. Our server Briant was very professional and knowledgeable!"
Nicole S.,"Mobile, AL",0,3,3,5.0,4/9/2017,"Excellent all the way. Excellent food, excellent selection, excellent happy hour, excellent service. The ahi appetizer tasted fresh and the sauce was great. I highly recommend this restaurant."
Patick O.,"Mobile, AL",0,1,,4.0,6/20/2017,First visit and really enjoyed. Steak was really good. Wife had chicken and was excellent also. Huge menu to chose just about anything your in the mood for. Waitress was great and helped us with the menu. Will definitely be returning
Rhonda R.,"Mobile, AL",0,12,1,3.0,5/3/2017,"Super slow service. Pizza was mediocre the last time I went. It came out on a plate rather than in their signature deep dish. I cannot stress how long our wait was for our dessert. One item was requested ""on the fly"" to feed the one yr old at the table. That item came out with the pizzas and the mushy substance was super cold. We were never offered a replacement. I give them 3 stars instead of one or two because they're a fairly new establishment and I believe they'll figure it out eventually. Hopefully!"
Eddie G.,"Mobile, AL",0,7,,5.0,4/22/2017,This place is awesome!! Great drinks and food. They have an interactive app that allows you to pay for your meal. And you get points. The wait is long but if you get the app you can get put on the list ahead of time.
Troy J.,"Mobile, AL",0,1,,1.0,4/11/2017,"OMG what a train wreck. 100 servers and the service sucks!! Take my word for it, Stay the hell away!!"
Zenobia C.,"Mobile, AL",1,4,,5.0,4/19/2017,"This place is very new, so I was blown away by the outstanding service. My sister and I decided to try this place and didn't have to wait long even though we were initially told the wait time would be 20-25 minutes for a table. I thought it was very sweet of the staff to bring out food to those waiting outside for a table. That was something I had never seen before. It was also very convenient that a text was sent to my cell phone to let us know when the table is ready instead of having to listen for our name or having to carry around one of the devices that restaurants usually have. The waiter (wish I remembered his name) was very entertaining and knowledgeable about the current specials. We ordered our drinks and entrees and with a few taps on the tablet he advised that they had already been sent back to the kitchen. I enjoyed the fried artichokes for an appetizer and the late night burger for my entree. Maybe next time I will have room for their dessert which looked pretty good. This place has easily slid into my group of top picks for restaurants in this area. Keep up the great work."
