Talmadge N.,"Grand Bay, AL",3,7,,4.0,8/5/2017,"Found this place by accident while dodging rainstorms and looking for a place to eat.  Boy, we are glad we found it.  The menu is massive and the list of brews will blow you away.  We were immediately seated and our server, Myles, was there as we were seated.  His knowledge of the menu and beer list was remarkable.  He gave us his full attention and engaged in conversation, which made it feel like he enjoyed interacting with his guests.  After he provided sample brews, we ordered our drinks and there was no undue delay.  Our food order was taken.  I had the prime rib and wife ordered the baby back ribs.  I am not going to say the food was great because I have had better, but I have also had worse.  Maybe I should rethink ordering prime rib in a pizza and burger restaurant.  However, the prime rib dinner also included their signature desert.  I think it is called a ""Pizookie"".  Whatever it is called, it is fabulous.  That alone almost made the visit worthwhile.  In any event the visit was made notable due to Myles, our server.  We would recommend that he continue to interact with his guests as he did with us.  Even though we stumbled upon this place, we will definitely be returning and look forward to being served by Myles."
Arnold L.,"Mobile, AL",13,141,,5.0,6/11/2017,"They seem to have really gotten their act together. Last night we were there and were served by Margaret O. (#329) who seems to go by ""Cassie"". She was excellent. She knew the menu, had excellent warmth and professionalism and her timing, re visiting the table was perfect. She made for a wonderful evening. Try the Root Beer and Cream Soda that is made at BJ's. It is excellent. The salads are enormous and the Kale salad is unique, The food is fresh and tasty and the portions are enormous. What you do not see often is an active participating helping manager. I did not get her name but she was referred to as ""The Non-Pregnant One"" by a lady at the next table when I asked her if she had gotten her name. She was also amazed that a manager was ""in the game""!! Anyway, BJ's is here, and I can see why they are successful by last night's experience. The place was packed at 9:00 pm. One last thing to remember. The call ahead feature is real and if you do this you can save yourself a wait. They do need to fix the app advertising a free appetizer with an entre purchase. Evidently this changed but the app ad had not. Again, if you have the right staff, no issue. Our waitress explained the problem and did it in a way that there were no hard feelings. Her service gets 5 stars. The food last night was also 5 star. Thank you BJ's. We will be back."
