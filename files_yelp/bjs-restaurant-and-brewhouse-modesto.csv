Donna F.,"Ripon, CA",1,83,396,5.0,10/29/2017,"BJ's is our favorite restaurant and BJ's in Modesto is awesome. We've had some hits and misses on the food and service but 99% of the time their right on perfect. They have a great crew such as Teo, Yvonne, and Micala.  We have had so many dish here: California club flatbread impressive tasting; Margherita Fresca flatbread, it's OK, I like meat on my pizza. Chicken wings are as good as their neighbor's, Chili and Sriracha Queso is delicious; Seared Ahi salad was good but would liked a little more ahi on it; Mahi-Mahi tacos very tasty, a favorite of mine; Honey-Sriracha Brussel sprouts smell and taste like Brussels sprouts, not my favorite, didn't order that again; Hickory Brisket and bacon was good, strong BBQ sauce flavor; Bacon-Guacamole deluxe burger was awesome; our favorite is their Piranha nachos doctored up....AMAZING. They have great beers such as the Tatonka, Jeremiah Red and the host other brewery's beers.. Back again got to meet a new bartender, Angela, really sweet and great services.   Tio and kitchen staff did an amazing job on our nachos. Back again, We have been to other BJ's location and the food has been good.  However we really enjoy the crew at the Modesto location.....good people.  We are always met with smiles and true kindness.    It just a great group if people: Chris, Tio, Oscar, Elliott,  Micala, and"
Brittany C.,"Modesto, CA",15,7,2,1.0,10/26/2017,"My two friends and I went to BJ's on a Thursday night, after the dinner rush. We ordered the cheese curds, chips and guac, meatballs with mashed potatoes, a chicken salad and a pizookie. None of it was edible. All of it was room temp, except the potatoes which were hot in some bites, cold in others, so I suspect they microwaved them. The tortilla chips were stale, the cheese curds chewy, no dressing on the salad and the cookie was so cold it actually kept the ice cream from melting. On top of all that, it took us over an hour to receive these, and they are all appetizers other than the salad.  Our server kind of apologized, you can tell she'd been apologizing for quite some time now. We did speak to the manager, we explained all of it wasn't worth eating but I'll take my salad home and add my own dressing to it. (Can't mess up chopped lettuce.) She did comp all of our order except our 1 cocktail and 1 pepsi. This was 2 1/2 hours of waiting for food we couldn't eat."
Chip L.,"San Leandro, CA",37,8,4,5.0,10/7/2017,"My wife, daughter and I popped into the Concord, CA location yesterday after a funeral. We were in need of a good cheering up, which we tend to do with food. We popped into BJ'S by chance, and were very impressed by the food and staff. I was especially pleased with the pizza I ordered, but I digress... We came to the Modesto location today because we were waiting for roadside service after visiting the mall. Battery was dead, and we were bummed. Again, the service and food were remarkable. Our server Megan was very sympathetic to our cause, and limited food order (we had beers, juice/soda, and an app sampler). She treated us with the same care as folks ordering meals, and checked on us frequently, with a very pleasant demeanor. My wife and I had already been saying that BJ'S might become 'our place' after yesterday's experience. Today sealed the deal."
Christie R.,"Fresno, CA",1,7,,1.0,1/6/2018,"Me and 8 of my coworkers came here for dinner on a Tuesday the 2nd and had the worst dining experience. Our server never smiled and took forever with everything. We were there almost 3 hours!! My food was ok but it was cold. In the beginning we sat with our salads and it took us 15 min after getting our salads to get any silverware to eat it with. And in the end when we waited a long while to order desert he comes out with our bills, we told him we wanted desert and he acted so irritated with us. to another server. Who was also incredibly slow but at least she was nice. Pizookies came out and they brought one of them that was wrong and took so long for the server to come back that my that time it was all melted and we just kept it. Eventually said he was going on break and gave us. I will never go to another bjs again."
Erendira L.,"Modesto, CA",17,76,61,2.0,12/30/2017,"Service here is handled by a team of sloths. Don't come hungry, because getting a server to take your order takes a long time. Getting your food served takes even longer. Don't bother ordering a pazookie unless you have another 30 minutes to kill after you've finished your meal. Getting your bill takes a long time too. Seriously, SLOTHS.  I guess not all BJs were created equal."
Erica A.,"Brentwood, CA",70,3,1,2.0,12/17/2017,"We were seated fairly quickly yesterday during a busy time. We waited about 30 minutes for our food but our waitress was kind and apologetic. The reason for the two stars was the sad, soggy, COLD, chicken club and bottom of the barrel fries. I picked the sandwich apart looking for something edible because I was starving. We paid the bill 20% tip because it wasn't the waitresses fault. The bathroom was nasty. Water/urine on the floor, clogged bathrooms, paper towels everywhere. No seat covers in my daughters stall. Kind of bummed. I have never had a bad experience at BJs over here in Brentwood. The wait is always long but the food is usually worth it."
Carole C.,"Modesto, CA",27,4,,2.0,10/21/2017,"This was my first time here however my daughter's and husband have been here before. This will be my last time. We ordered 2 apps before our dinner and received 1- they had to reorder 1 as ours had been given to another customer. We didn't get it until AFTER we received our entrees. Half of our table (of 6) had issues with our orders. My husband's jambalaya was missing shrimp, 1 chopped salad didnt receive dressing until our 3rd request for it and my sweet potato fries were ice cold- the plate was warmer than the fries.  I imagine this place must lose a lot of money, comping food when simple things could've been done to correct the problems. Half our table ended up getting comped which was fine  but if this is an indication of how they operate, I certainly won't be back, comped or not. All of the reviews about service are misleading. Our service was chaotic at best."
Audrie B.,"Monroe, LA",13,1,,5.0,11/3/2017,"We love bjs! We come all the time. We love the avocado egg rolls and pizza! And the wedge salad and pazookie is a must! However, our last visit we had such great customer service we decided to write a review. There actually was  a mishap with our order and for some odd reason our pizza was taking a little longer than expected. The manager Sarah went above and beyond to make it right and made our experience worth the wait. Along with the attentive service with management our server (lizzeth D) was so sweet and very apologetic for the mishap. She made sure our drinks were always filled and always asked if we needed anything every time she passed the table. We have three small children so something always comes up and she was willing to get everything we needed. We really appreciate the service they gave our family and reminded us how costumer service should be! Thank you Sarah and Lizzeth!"
shannon p.,"Modesto, CA",112,44,,4.0,12/15/2017,I love BJs first and foremost because of their HUGE menu selection. Food and service have always been excellent.
Alysia M.,"Pleasanton, CA",127,7,2,4.0,12/16/2017,"Like coming here drinks are good, food is good just wish the service here was faster. It takes almost 40 minutes to get food and I come here on my lunch break at work."
Alice C.,"Irvine, CA",1936,1026,623,1.0,8/14/2017,"we couldn't figure out what to eat sat night so eventually settled on bj's because, well it's bj's, they can't mess that up, but then we were wrong. for a party of 2 at approx 7p was a 50 min wait. we opted for the bar area since it was open seating.  waited about 10 minutes, no one bothered to come by to greet us, get our beverage order, or hand us the menu, meanwhile 4 different servers passed by.  uh, are you guys wearing blinders? then we've got a middle-aged couple sitting next to us, complaining to the manager about the service quality, manager making up hella excuses for the server.  said manager eventually finished the conversation, didn't even bother to come by to check how WE were doing. we left.  took our business to a local business that actually cared about their customers. suck it, bj."
Mark D.,"Modesto, CA",30,27,,3.0,11/27/2017,Met my girlfriend there for our first date. That turned out well. Food was not as memorable. Just an ok experience.
Souporn H.,"Escondido, CA",73,132,14,4.0,9/24/2017,I looooove their avocado eggrolls!! The way they melt in my mouth and how the salty and sweetness blends together so well. Last time we were here something went wrong with our meal. I'll leave it at that. And the server and manager were amazing at handling the situation. I'll definitely be back! Those eggrolls will always be calling my name.
Alicia W.,"Tracy, CA",12,16,18,5.0,9/1/2017,I love their Ahi Tuna Salad....have ordered three times in a roll....yummy!
Jasmine L.,"Manteca, CA",1,6,9,3.0,11/13/2017,"Came in on Wednesday night, gave them our name and the host said it would only be a 5 minute wait. 15 minutes later, got the text that our table was ready so we came in and let the host know. He said we would be seated shortly, but after noticing a bunch of other parties that got there after us, were being seated first, we let the host know again. Finally after another 15 minutes, we actually got seated. Thankfully the food was good and the server was attentive. Everything else was fine, but that front desk staff needs help."
Chris F.,"Modesto, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/1/2018,"BJ's again disappointing! Working in the mall right next to BJ's I would go there once a week for lunch. I would say a least 40 % of the time there was a mistake with my order. I decided to stop going there, which I have not been back in a year. Today I wanted to buy my employee's lunch for working New Years and placed a order online. When I got there to pick up they did not have my order. I had a print out and confirmation of the order. I has told that 2 of the four items were sold out, but they could start making the other items now if I wanted to wait. Had to go back and tell everyone that lunch was not on me, because BJ's can't seem to get anything right. Shame on me for trying this place again. I guess staying away a year wasn't enough time to forget how bad this place is. Never making this mistake again, staying away for good this time!"
James C.,"Manteca, CA",81,1,,1.0,12/30/2017,"First off this review is based only off of curbside ordering to go. IT FUCKING SUCKS. I placed my order, when I get there the curbside parking is full with empty cars. So I call and ask where do I park? The lady on the phone was very rude, called me out of my name twice and then hung up on me. Then she comes out with my food, hands it to me, wasn't friendly at all and after she takes my payment I proceed to look into the bag and notice that my Cesar salad was actually a house salad with Cesar dressing. How hard is it to make a Cesar salad?! I also got a burger with fries and ""Cesar salad"" so I tried a fry and to my not so likely surprise it was cold. When I get home about 10 min away. And guys I understand food isn't going to be super hot like it just came outta the kitchen but my chicken fried steak burger was cold. I'm talking like my melted cheese was cold like you melt it and stick it in the fridge then serve it. Not to mention that I think the burger itself was undercooked, almost raw. If I could give this less than one star I definitely would."
Sydni A.,"Modesto, CA",2,11,1,3.0,11/29/2017,"Good service & clean restaurant. I rated it a 3 because the food at this location isn't that good anymore (burgers greasy, salad soggy, portions smaller). I've been to this chain in many different cities and this one when it first opened. If they can get back to when they first opened, I'd rate them higher."
Eidit C.,"UC Campus Area, Berkeley, CA",228,133,417,3.0,2/4/2017,"Variety of food selections from pizza, burgers, steak to pastas. The food is high end fast food. Good enough for a dine in after a long day of shopping at the mall. I got the traditional flatbread pizza which was okay, a little too soggy for the crust from my perspective. Got a side of house Cesar salad on the side, it was heavy on the dressing so if you're not a fan of that ask for the dressing on the side. The best part was the great server and the Pazooki for dessert. The Pazooki alone is enough to make me come back."
Robert W.,"Patterson, CA",1668,147,857,4.0,7/21/2016,"I come here with the family quite a bit. It's a huge menu but I stick to just the deep dish pizza. I tried other options but never really cared for much of their food but I love the deep dish pizza. They have many options or even a build your own. I usually split a large with my wife and get half one option and half another. All the options are great so we switch up all the time. They brew their own beer, the Hopstorm IPA is excellent. They have many beers on tap and a full bar area.  Weekends will get very busy but you can call ahead so you can alleviate some of the wait time there. There is a ton of large screen TVs around the restaurant so you don't have to worry about missing your favorite team kick some butt while you have some pizza and beers. I've always had good service and the food comes out reasonably quick. Located right next to the mall, so you can pig out and walk it off while watching your wife spend all your money."
Bruce H.,"LAKE VIEW TER, CA",1,107,345,4.0,8/31/2017,"I've been to this location once before a couple of years back and have been to many BJ's for their 10pm happy hour. I have not had the experience only but once (but not quite as good) as the service I had tonight here. My server was Yolanda.  She was on top of here game. Very social,  professional and proficient.  I never had to wait for anything and always delivered with a smile. Will return because of her."
Jennifer M.,"South Milwaukee, WI",45,36,1,1.0,11/16/2017,I came in as a single person. Told it would be 10 min wait for a table but could go to bar as well.  The bar was busy due to happy hour.   But I found a seat.  Sat there for over 10mins.  The two bartenders were too busy filling drink orders from waitstaff they never knowledge me or anyone at the bar for that matter.  So I leave and go back to wait for a table at front desk.  Finally get seated after another 5 mins.    Waited at table without being seen for 15 mins.   So I left.... ridiculous
Liz H.,"Modesto, CA",0,46,,2.0,11/22/2017,"Really, BJ's?! You went from being one of my favorite chain restaurants to the bottom of the barrel. Tonight is the night before Thanksgiving. So as not to mess up my kitchen, and because I had a gift card, and as a treat for my kids and grandkids, we decided to go to BJ's for dinner.  I called for a reservation early in the day, but was told it was not an option. So our party of seven, five adults and 2 kids arrived at 5:30. We were told there would be a 30 minute wait. No problem. Then we waited and waited, and waited.  After an hour we told the host we would be okay with being split up. And then we sat there while over 20 smaller parties were seated. We were told a party of eight was done and should be leaving soon. Only they didn't.  Finally my son in law asked for a manager. She told us appetizers would be comped and took the orders for the kid's drinks and dinner. After we were finally seated, an hour and a half after arrival, our waiter told us again and again how our lousy service was not his fault. Maybe so, but the delivery of the pre-ordered kid's meals took forever and our dinners took even longer, and did not come out together. Then my daughter made the grievous error of ordering dessert, and me, a second glass of wine. We waited, and waited, and waited.  Thank Goodness the two toddlers were well behaved! But our 'treat' turned into a complete ordeal.  Not happy. Not coming back."
Umar G.,"Turlock, CA",91,257,22,3.0,6/25/2017,"Not too bad, but not great either. Large corporate restaurants always have this challenge of not becoming too bureaucratic and rule based rather than consumer oriented. It tends to take good management to not lose that aspect. In this case, management is failing. Table prep was hasty with no sweetener on the table. Certain sections were completely empty and yet the hostess refused to open them and was offering 25 - 30 minute waits instead (and this is at 5.00 pm on a Friday so it still wasn't rush dinner time).The food wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. Run of the mill offerings, though I do like their avocado spring rolls (what I mainly came for). I wasn't disappointed in them, but I was a little disappointed with my salad. The Ahi tuna portion wasn't generous and the salad hadn't been tossed properly, so all the dressing was at the bottom. They got the spouses first burger wrong but eventually fixed the problem. And the bill without drinks was over 50 bucks.. a little too expensive for a medium end corporate chain.  Overall if there was nothing else around and I was stuck at the mall, I would go here again ... otherwise I'd probably go with Texas Roadhouse .. I feel I get a better bang for my buck there."
David D.,"San Francisco, CA",27,1,,5.0,12/24/2017,"Great place to eat. Ribs have a great flavor. Pizza is always good. On second and third visit started taking advantage of their specials, worth the savings."
Dee H.,"Escalon, CA",61,67,14,1.0,6/17/2017,"I'm giving a one star for the sole fact that they could have made me very sick or killed me. I am allergic to shellfish, squid, and other seafood. I was never informed, nor does it state anything about how they cook all of their fries and fried food with the seafood and shellfish.  I ordered a burger and fries, while it was very good, something wasn't right. I started to feel my face and mouth swell as I broke out in hives. My mouth was itching badly as well. It wasn't until I actually found a piece of calamari in with my fries that I realized what the problem was.  I immediately called the waitresses attention to which she responded by calling over a manager. I don't remember his name, but he was rude. So rude. He basically said that I should have asked if they cooked any of their food with what I was allergic to. Seriously? That is not my responsibility. You as the establishment serving the food, need to notify or at least state a warning somewhere clearly in the menu.  We paid the bill and headed towards the door, I needed an epinephrine pen and a cold bath for the swelling. As we were about to walk out the door he sarcastically stopped me and handed me a card that was a coupon for 10% off my next meal. As if I planned to return? He was rude through the entire ordeal and had no sympathy.  I even contacted corporate. This happened a while ago and I contacted corporate promptly and haven't heard back from them either. I don't think they care about their customers well being and satisfaction with their products.  Beware if you have any sort of allergy while visiting this place."
Becky G.,"Dearborn, MI",1,5,,1.0,7/27/2017,"Worst service ever!  My husband finished his salad before the drinks arrived, been waiting for dessert for nearly a half hour."
Mohammad S.,"Modesto, CA",1,16,13,5.0,11/2/2017,I've always enjoyed my self when I come here. Food is good service is awesome would definitely encourage anyone who haven't been their to give them a try
Terry C.,"Modesto, CA",76,59,10,5.0,9/30/2017,Once again we visited this wonderful resturant. Vibrant atmosphere just even one relaxing and enjoying their meals. Appetizer appeared and no rush getting us to hurry up without bring dinner on top. Dinner arrived we received plenty of refills in a very quick timely matter. Service is outstanding with wonderful staff. I HIGHLY recommend this establishment!!
Riley V.,"Ripon, CA",0,11,,5.0,11/5/2017,"Love this place, Sarah at the bar is spot on, and will definately take care of you.  If Sarah isn't working hopefully Evvon is, she's just as good!  They have a great pumkin ale!"
Jeff R.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,2,,1.0,7/3/2017,"Stay away from this place!! Ordered the jalapeño Burger that was delivered to my table cold with raw uncooked bits of hamburger meat inside. This place has the potential to make someone very ill if they have not done so already. I am honestly shocked that food would be allowed to leave the kitchen and delivered to table in such horrid condition. Our Waitress was very nice and sympathetic but how embarrassing for her. The manager came over and apologized but quickly made an excuse stating that my order had been crossed up with a customer who ordered their hamburger extremely rare....hmmm I guess that customer also likes their hamburgers served cold with a greasy stale bun. What a disaster! I am honestly not one to complain and I seriously have to feel very inspired to write a review but I think it's important that people know my experience. BJ's seriously! What happened?! This is unacceptable, irresponsible and dangerous! You can do better! Your customers deserve better! Modesto deserves better! Please clean up your act!"
Michelle T.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",70,182,155,4.0,7/5/2017,"Entertained my BF's sisters' new man in her life a couple weeks ago. We finally got to meet him and wanted a nice, ambient place to have dinner. I thought this place would be nice. It definitely was. We enjoyed our evening and had the pleasure of Eddie and Tony serving us. Working together as a team to resolve the issues we encountered, they both did a wonderful job taking care of our needs. The place was extremely busy but they both were doing their best. Attentive, quick and courteous. I especially appreciated that both showed up to the table when Eddie was about to go on lunch. He introduced Tony and didn't just leave us wondering what the heck happened to our server?? I can't tell you how many times that has happened to us. It's very annoying and messes up my meal. When all was said and done, we had a delicious meal and terrific experience. It was awesome. Thank you to both Tony and Eddie for allowing us to enjoy our dinner. We hope to have you both as our servers next time!"
Paisley D.,"Turlock, CA",0,6,2,4.0,10/2/2017,Its a great place! I had a pazooki abd it was DE - LI - CIOUS! I had to wait quite a long time but it was worth it! It was probably one of the best places to go if you love good food and a nice and fancy restraunt! Oh and since I had a long wait the manager gave me and my whole family a free pazooki! So all in all one of the best places EVER
ALANA M.,"Modesto, CA",19,93,103,5.0,7/10/2017,This went from 1 star to 5 thanks to Saraha. She is a great server and doesnt rush even if its close to closing. She honestly had such a great attitude. Enough to bring this review waaaay up.
Denton A.,"San Jose, CA",31,42,,3.0,10/11/2017,I never have a complaint about the food or drinks; and the bartenders area always nice too. The hosts and waiters are often rude and lack the customer service skills exhibited on the other side of the restaurant from the bar staff.
Bethany S.,"Lodi, CA",77,47,97,5.0,5/11/2017,"I want to give this place 5 stars! I loved our sauces as usual. Our server was the best part. Very attentive and hard working! That girl was running circles and taking care of so many patrons! I was very impressed, and I think her manager should know too! Thank you Jenn for a very wonderful fun experience for my son and I! Your hard work most definitely did not go unnoticed!"
Gail W.,"Atwater, CA",1067,39,477,4.0,5/22/2017,"Stopped at BJ's to have a quick snack.came to the Vintage faire mall to sell our iPhone 4 and 5. Found that the Eco whatever in my opinion is a TOTAL rip-off,whatever. so we have a iPhone 4 and iPhone 5 in great condition for sale"
Autumn J.,"Los Banos, CA",0,4,1,1.0,10/16/2017,Waited to get seated took about two minutes we all sat down and looked at the menu found what we wanted to drink then went onto finding what we wanted to eat after 5 minutes we still weren't helped we continued to wait we waited about 10 minutes and walked out because no one came to help us
Erika L.,"Salida, CA",7,6,,1.0,10/6/2017,"I honestly can not believe how horrible the service and food combined was and the worst part is we didn't even done in! My boyfriend used to be a cook at the BJs in Dublin and the food his coworkers would prepare is nothing like what we received. A steak that was supposed to be medium rare came out so well done it shrunk to a patty. My seared ahi tuna salad was in a lagoon of dressing filled with wilted lettuce and about 5 pieces of completely raw mushy tuna, no sear whatsoever. To top it off, when we tried to return the food the girl at take out told us ""so what do you want me to do?"" I walked out and left my boyfriend to handle it. I'll never be back."
Molly H.,"Ceres, CA",8,21,8,3.0,6/5/2017,"We went to BJ's the other day for lunch with my son and his best friend I have to say the food was prepared perfectly however our waitress was very rude and abrasive. She  forgot things that we asked for right up front and continuously rolled her eyes when we called for her to come help us. it was very upsetting to the point I wanted to move sections but my son said we were almost finished and just to let it be. Needless to say I did not leave her a tip because of how rude she was and that is actually upsetting for me because I put myself threw college being a server, and if you're going to roll your eyes when your customers want service,  don't be in the service industry!  get a different job"
