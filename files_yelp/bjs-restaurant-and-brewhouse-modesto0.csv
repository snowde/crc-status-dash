Teddy R.,"Modesto, CA",1,15,9,1.0,11/3/2014,"Ill make this short and simple.. Ate here twice, and both times my wife and I, received horrible, terrible, i mean just awful service!  No one acknowledged us for 15 mins prior to getting seated. My wife had to raise her hand to finally get someone to serve us.  Our entree came before our appetizer,  and our server did not even checked on us once.  When we finally asked for our check and change, she then took another 15 minutes!  Top 10 worst service in my book  To top it off, the table right next to us, had the hosts taking their order and she admittedly said it was her first time taking an order.  They really need to get it together, and I don't blame the host, servers but I blame poor MANAGEMENT!"
Roxi L.,"Los Banos, CA",1,10,2,2.0,2/20/2016,"Hadn't been here in over a year so we decided it was about time to make another visit. We arrived a little before happy hour so it wasn't too crowded. The beer was flat... huge disappointment.  We ordered calamari which was good but could have been a little more crisp. The Mediterranean pizza was great! Very flavorful and filling. Our server wasn't the friendliest, she was rude and seemed to be losing her patience with a table next to us. This visit wasn't a horrible experience (that pizza was reeaally good) but when you go to a brewery you expect the beer to be at least decent."
Lisa T.,"Ripon, CA",11,97,309,5.0,5/16/2014,"Ahhh it's my BF BiRtHdAy!!! Linsey @ the bar took great care of us for a Litl BDay spirits and our lunch Bday Boy had some Mahi mahi   n scallops  Me, avacado  wraps w/spicy dipn' sauce Yumm!! BJ'S is always great . Bon appetite all"
Rya L.,"Stanislaus County, CA",117,211,19,2.0,2/4/2015,"Came in on my birthday and was greeted by a nice fellow...one star. The other star is for our waiter who gave such great effort, only to be let down by the cooking staff. We ordered avocado egg rolls to start, a pizza, bleu cheese burger & fries, a strawberry splash cocktail and a pizookie for dessert. Only the pizza and the cocktail were tolerable. I'm not sure if my tastebuds are more refined now that I'm older, but this BJs was a true let down. I've been to many BJs in Southern California and the two that I've tried here, Modesto and Livermore have been awful. So let me start with the egg rolls. They tryin' to be Cheesecake Factory or what? Doesn't even come close, especially if you leave the end pits inside two of the egg rolls! No excuse. I bit into one and my husband bit into the other. All downhill from there. While ordering, our waiter had asked me if I wanted wedges or skinny fries and I chose the skinny. He also asked how I wanted my burger done, and I said 'well.' Hmmmm...can you guess what happens next? :) The burger comes out medium and the fries comes out as wedges.  I didn't even want to order dessert, but I was hoping they would redeem themselves. Not quite. Pizookie was a gooey, undercooked mess, I don't think that's normal.  This BJs experience really blew, in a bad way."
Walt N.,"Roseville, CA",26,231,143,5.0,9/30/2014,"Came to Modesto on Saturday with a couple of teenage girls for a soccer tournament. They insisted on lunch at BJ's after the tournament.  After looking at all of the weak reviews, especially regarding service, I was skeptical, but knew I was no match for 16 year olds that had pazooki desserts on their minds. BJ's had the typical lunchtime wait of about 25 minutes. We were prepared for a long wait for food, etc., so if the service was weak, it was not going to be a big surprise. The kids wanted to see the games on the big screen tv's, soak up the atmosphere of the restaurant and have a good time, regardless of the slow food service. In reality, the service was about as good as it gets. Our server had water to our table within a minute of our seating, took our order promptly, and the appetizer plate of avocado rolls was in front of us within minutes of ordering.  The rolls were fantastic. One of the girls ordered clam chowder, which was just about as good as you would hope to get at Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco.  The meal service was truly perfect. The side salads were fresh and well prepared, and the main courses, of which we had three different at our table, were all excellent.  The water and drink glasses were kept constantly filled, the server was polite, professional, and knowledgeable about the menu items.  Dessert was no exception, the pazookies were brought to the table fresh from the oven. The restaurant was packed the entire time we dined, yet service was exceptional.  I'm not a big fan of corporate dining or large chain restaurants, but this was a very pleasant luncheon experience and we will definitely visit this BJ location on our next tournament visit to Modesto."
Joseph R.,"Lake Balboa, Los Angeles, CA",1,20,3,3.0,6/26/2015,"I went here tonight for the first time. I saw the three out of five stars here on Yelp and thought ""Hmm, it is probably just one of those average chain places..."" My experience went as follows: Arrived at 7:20, waited only 23 minutes for a table. That's okay. It was a Friday so I understand. We ordered an appetizer and some drinks. They came to us with relative ease and time. When the rest of the group came things started taking forever. That's okay an all but wow... It was slow. We ordered pizzas, the deep dish ones, and they were not hot not cooked all the way through... I asked for BBQ sauce and it was not put on. They were quick with bringing drinks but other than that the food was very mediocre and the service was so so.  Overall it was exactly what Yelp reviews said. 2.5/3 out of 5 stars. Just a mediocre chain place like most chain places.  I would not recommend this place to others nor do I ever see myself returning for mediocre food and slow service"
Dustin H.,"West Chester, PA",53,95,148,3.0,3/30/2015,"BJ's has a great selection of beer and food. It was a bit crowded at times, but the service was always adequate. The egg rolls were very good. The calamari was average and the pasta dish I got was delicious. This was the first BJ's I had been to. I returned again several nights later, and have since been to a BJ's in Houston. It's definitely a restaurant worth checking out."
Darlene M.,"San Francisco, CA",2198,254,680,1.0,3/25/2013,"We're not from Modesto, but was only here for the Modesto Marathon. My fiancé and I wanted some good source of carbs so we went to Bj's to get some pizza. Rita was our server. It's a bad start when our waitress was already rude to begin with and had to apologize for her rude behavior before we even said anything.  We ordered a large sweet pig with NO tomatoes and on half of the pizza, we said light cheese. When our pizza came out there were big chunks of tomatoes with NO cheese. Our waitress even said she noticed that there was no cheese on the pizza and saw the tomatoes, but looked at her paper and saw she wrote light cheese and no tomatoes, but gave it to us anyway. On one of the slices, my fiancé noticed something green on the pizza that looked like mold. The general manager, Fred came because my fiancé wanted to ask what it was. He said it wasn't mold, He took our pizza right awy and made us a fresh batch before we can even observe it even more.  With all our time wasted, they gave us our bill and expected some sort of compensation for our time wasted by our incompetent waitress, but my fiancé ended up paying for the whole bill.  We asked for a box for our left over pizza and she comes and brings us a small to go boxes. We asked if they had any pizza boxes left cause we had 7 slices left. She said she'll get us one.  Man! Our waitress was a complete airhead!!"
Kevin S.,"San Francisco, CA",0,45,,1.0,9/22/2015,"Acutely terrible.  They were obviously having an off night and usually I'd let that slide, happens to the best of us and sometimes there's just no fixing things until the new day.  This was something special though.  Not only was the food bad and cold, it took over an hour and we had to order it twice. Also our waitress got into a verbal fight with another waitress.  They came back and forth to enlist our support (this is why we had to order twice, because apparently our aisle of booths was ""the other one's"" responsibility, until they turned on the hostess for seating us all there in the first place.)  Dinner and a floor show, and neither worth even free admission."
Maryanne F.,"Fremont, CA",0,3,,5.0,4/4/2016,Normally I don't use Yelp to write reviews only to search but I had a great experience yesterday at this store and felt like it needed to be mentioned. It is usually a hit or miss here as far as service but I have been an avid customer. Our waitreess her name was Krystal (crystal?) was super friendly and attentive she actually made conversation with my children and I and even made my husband laugh which is hard. Food came out perfect and very quick. I had a great experience and because of the service I will definitely return.
Daisy A.,"Stockton, CA",0,88,94,4.0,3/29/2015,"So, I'm not a big fan of BJs, but decided to give it a try today. My past experiences have been rude customer service and slow service, but I must say today was different.As we walked in the young woman greeted was blah and asked if I was a premier member? No, I'm not I responded and She replied ok... Isn't this where you explain what it is? (I thought) as we carried on to sit in the bar area our waitress did take a bit to come, but it was busy. As our experience continued our server was quick and courteous. The avocado rolls were perfect, Bloody Mary and main entree was all as ordered. I ended up asking our waitress about the reward program and enrolled. I look forward in coming back for brunch."
Raul V.,"Modesto, CA",18,5,1,5.0,4/2/2016,"The food, the place, the vibes and everything else felt really amazing.! Food speechless about it really good good food. Will recommend it to my family and everyone else who wants really good food"
Shane L.,"El Sobrante, CA",440,87,5,1.0,9/22/2014,"GAWD AWFUL!  They sat us at the wrong table, then when we got to ours, the table was crooked and uneven and had chocolate shit alllllll over it and our menu's. the ""famous pizookis"" or how ever you spell them were a joke. My partners came out hella thin and burnt and we saw the table next to us and they had a HIGE one of the same kind, I believe the cookies and cream one. So that was LAME that we had to pay for a hot mess plate and watch another person eat a great looking one. PLus our waitresses changed half way though, and honestly, of half my F****n plate is a leaf of lettuce as garnish, maybe you should invest in SMALLER damn PLATES. Oh and are you Victorian, a garage, or a Sport bar? Pick one. Redic decor.  Can I give zero stars, Yelp? I HATE this place. HATE. H-A-T-E.... This one, the Oakridge location, and Concord. This chain is GAWD awful!  Luckily I had a blast with the people I was with, but my good time was not because of anything that this company did...."
Em L.,"Madera, CA",0,8,,5.0,8/21/2016,"Stopping by Modesto for dinner decided on BJs. Food was really good used coupon for free app of calamari. We split a Mini pizza, and side salad and two waters. Ticket totaled $15 and change server Gina did a great job offered what sounded like great drinks but we were on the road. She was super friendly and a small ticket usually bad service ... Not here. Thanks for taking good care of us when we just want to eat lighter. Bathrooms really clean, hosts gave a cheery goodby .. Thanks we will be back great job"
Rachel S.,"Pleasanton, CA",757,547,284,5.0,8/19/2011,"I went here with my three daughters and met up with my friend and her son for lunch today. Our kids ranged from ages 3-7 years old. We arrived at about 2:30, so we were seated right away.  We were busy catching up with each other, instead of looking at the menu. Our waiter came by almost right after we were seated and took our drink orders. We started with the spinach and artichoke dip which was so good!  I ordered the deep dish bbq chicken pizza, my friend ordered one of the flat bread pizzas, the kids ordered chicken strips, corn dogs and grilled cheese all with french fries.  I'm not usually one to order pizza, if there are a lot of other options. But I felt like pizza, the pictures looked good, so I went for it. I'm glad I did because it was amazing! The dough on the deep dish was so good, it tasted like fresh baked bread. The bbq sauce was good and they used just enough and it was loaded with chicken and cheese. The kids meals price includes the entree and drink. The portion was actually pretty large for a kids meal. But mine didn't mind, they loved the french fries.  Our waiter was nice and attentive. The only thing is that he brought out the wrong flat bread pizza for my friend. My friend really wouldn't have noticed, but he came out and told her that he brought her the wrong pizza. He did give her the right one (on the house), she had a bite of one piece and then took the rest home. But other than that, he was good with keeping our drinks full and making sure we had everything we needed. I didn't think the overall price for what we ordered was bad. It was really good food, I'm sad that we don't live closer or we'd be visiting more often. But this is a restaurant that I wouldn't mind taking a 25 minute drive to dine at. And next time I'll make sure to save room to get a pazooki."
Keelan G.,"Modesto, CA",2,1,,1.0,10/15/2015,"Bad experience 3 times in a row. Poor service, mediocre food and horrible prices. On a personal level, I would not recommend coming here."
Ariel C.,"Merced, CA",80,8,,1.0,8/9/2015,"I'm here to complain about the service, the food was great, satisfying as always. Although the service was terrible, the worst by far that I've ever experienced. I wish I remembered his name but he didn't ever introduce himself like a proper waiter would have. It took him about 20mins to take our drink order another 15 for them to come out. Then another 15 to take our order, keep in mind there are only myself and another in the party. So a total of 2 and it took a total of 50 mins to get our late lunch started. I believe he took the opportunity to judge us as being the young couple that would be less generous in the end tip,because he continued to avoid us, avoid eye contact, avoid refilling our drinks. He continued to serve his larger parties, no hesitation but it took us to turn our heads and raise our hands to get any of his attention. But there was no hesitation to rush us out of his section because he continuously ask if the bill was ready to be taken care of, while we were still enjoying our dessert. Not sure if he thought we'd dine and dash or was about to clock out but any server should know if a check is ready to be taken care of, then it'd be on the edge of the table or standing up. Like I said I wished we remembered his name but this mishap took place on Sunday the 9th of August around 4pm and we're  seated on the second row of two top booths farthest from the bar, fourth booth down.  P.s we're servers like you. We're on the same boat, there's no reason to ever neglect a table like you did ours."
Shelly B.,"Modesto, CA",1,18,,1.0,8/31/2014,"Service sucks. We come here for lunch breaks , terrible service. Orders usually wrong . Plates dirty . Staff should be lucky they have jobs because 90% of them no one should hire. Most of them don't even smile . The first manager was great after he left , all went down hill . Sucks because it's a nice looking restaurant .               So I thought I wouldn't post because I felt bad. The rest of our visit today our waiter couldn't stop yawning. I can't tell you how many things were wrong with simple orders. And to top it off other servers kept coming to our table to bring food for other tables. Sent back dirty plate , wrong drink, forgot fries, ordered 3 desserts got 2 of them . Waited another 15 mins. What a joke"
Jessica S.,"Los Angeles, CA",155,106,41,1.0,8/18/2015,"BJ's food is good.. Nothing spectacular, but it's good. So our food that we got was good. I can't complain about the quality of that.  So it's a Sunday night. The place is decently busy but it seems like everyone around us is getting their food and not having any problems. There is an ample amount of waiters and bus boys so this isn't a situation of being understaffed.  We order our food with this great waiter, and then someone else comes over and tells us he's taking over and the other guy is going on break. Whatever. Think nothing of it.  This guy was not necessarily rude... But not nice or pleasant at all. No smiles. Only business and there to get the job done. Which is fine! But don't expect a tip for your lack of service.  Our food comes out.... 45 minutes later- everything except for my friends soup..  - and our waiter comes over and tell us ""your soup will be right out! They're finishing it."" 5 minutes goes by... He comes by again at least three more times ""your soup will be out in two minutes!"" 5 minutes later- ""they're pouring it and giving it to me now"" - 10 minutes later- finally she gets her soup.  Also, it took 10 minutes for my friend to get her ranch. That she asked for with her meal order. Then asked for when we got our food. Then it finally came- after he walked by at least four times to do other things- with my friends soup.  So it's an hour after we've sat, and we didn't take too long to order- it was relatively normal timing. Anyway, so we get that. Then we order some dessert. A pazookie! We get that 25 minutes later. And then finally the guy comes by with our checks.  I should have asked for the manager sooner but I didn't want to stir the pot and was wishful thinking, having some hope in BJ's. But I finally did and he gave us some free pazookie certificates. But it was my fault that I spoke to the manager after our bills were paid.  But our service was just so terrible. I'm only in Modesto twice a year and for 2 days at a time. I don't want to waste my time sitting at BJ's, waiting for the damn waiter who keeps lying to us about the soup! Fine, if it's going to take longer, don't tell us ""2 minutes."" Be honest. And apologize about it.  We were there for a total of 2 hours and 15 minutes. As a party of four. The table that had 7 across from us came after us, had dinner and dessert just as we did-left before us. They had a different waiter.   I don't know if I'll return to BJ's. I think there are much better establishments in Modesto that I'd rather give my money to, when I am in town. So disappointed."
P E.,"Salida, CA",318,335,875,1.0,7/10/2015,"Sat at the bar tables today to enjoy a pizza and some beer. The service I received from our server was the sh#t! I was noticing how she was treating everybody else and she was super nice to them! I had to wave her down to get her attention because when she would pass by us she would ignore us! All we needed were napkins, because we never got utensils or napkins. When she brought out bill, she just slapped it on the wet table without the bifold and when she picked it up it was all wet and soggy from the water that was on the table, when she brought it back, she brought it back in a bifold and said ""thank you! Have a great day!!! Expecting that I leave her a great tip (I am a good tipper by the way). Needless to say I will still go back to BJ's (people that know me know that I go to BJ's a lot) and I hope I get better service next time. The 1 star is based on today's service, service that I've never received before."
