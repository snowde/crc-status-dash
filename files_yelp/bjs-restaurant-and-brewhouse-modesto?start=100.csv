Chelsey S.,"Fresno, CA",0,6,,1.0,2/6/2017,"BJs is our go to place to satisfy a variety of people's taste. Unfortunately our car side to go experience was absolutely unacceptable. The waitress was quick, sweet, and understanding however the food itself was disappointing. The avocado egg rolls were half burnt and the sauce was only filled a quarter of the way. Paying 12 dollars for only 6 small rolls you would think they would be more appealing. I ordered online and paid extra to add bacon to half the pizza and extra pineapple to the whole thing. We literally counted 10 tiny pieces of pineapple that sprinkled the medium 8 slice pizza and the bacon that sprinkled the whole thing.  $26 Pizza was cold and unsatisfying. Probably will dine in only to avoid poor quality of to go food.  With tip spent $45, $30 too much in my opinion."
Sarah R.,"Modesto, CA",0,21,,5.0,9/11/2017,"This is a great restaurant. We get good food, great beer and we get to watch the game! Elliot is a great server!  He gave us the best service we've gotten in a while. Attentive, funny and made great suggestions. I would definitely recommend sitting in his section. You won't be disappointed."
Aj M.,"Merced, CA",25,18,5,2.0,8/10/2016,Calamari was awesome...Caesar salad with anchovies great...my favs...but the 18.50 shrimp with asparagus sucks...it's been on the heat lamp too long...dry out the  noodles...dry and awful. ..
Alexandra R.,"Modesto, CA",3,22,1,5.0,3/6/2017,"Excellent service! Came here for my 21st birthday along with a party of 21 people. All servers were super friendly, the food was excellent. We came on a Saturday night and of course it was packed! But the servers did a great job of being personable and frequently checking up on us to make sure we were satisfied at all times. Bartenders are excellent as well, had some awesome drinks that night! Thank you."
A R.,"Hidden Valley Lake, CA",34,37,39,4.0,4/18/2016,Great pizza thin crust!! Real stuff! Hubby got the crispy jalapeño burger he was not impressed.

Greasy ! So disappointed!! The potato skins are great!! Salad with balsamic dressing wonderful! Iced teasGreat! Service wonderful!!
Cesar V.,"Modesto, CA",16,1,,1.0,5/2/2017,"Overpriced flavorless food and slow service. I went in for dinner on Monday night for what I thought would be an enjoyable meal but instead I got food with no flavor. The worst thing was their tiny steak, it looked like a piece of coal from how burnt it was. All the other food we ordered was bad as well. Would not recommend it."
Luna S.,"Tracy, CA",0,7,,1.0,2/13/2017,"Watch out if you go to this so called bar/restaurant.   If you sit at the bar,the bartender ask if you will be having more drinks and will request your credit card to keep an open tab.   These thieves turn around and use your credit card while you are still sitting at the bar and pay for charges over the phone for cloths, shoes, phones, you name it.   They are working with merchants around BJ's in Modesto.    Big scam.     Managers were contacted, but I'm still waiting for their call."
Dr J.,"Modesto, CA",2,55,7,1.0,3/27/2017,"When we got there we were sat we waited almost 20 minutes for the waiter came to us. After taking our order it took almost 30 minutes to get three simple breakfast dishes. When the order finally came, the order was completely wrong. The wrong type of eggs, missing items, and cold! After taking the order we saw the waiter maybe one time. Somebody else started coming to the table brought all her dishes and fixed all the mistakes. But our original waiter never came to the table never asked if everything was OK. The restaurant was not busy and the waiter was not slammed. The manager was kind enough to take their error off our bill. But that's not what I was wanting. I hope management of this restaurant looks at and within themselves and their staff and make sure that they're hiring better people who are qualified to be doing what they're doing. Whether that be a waiter, cook, or a hostess."
Fern D.,"Turlock, CA",24,13,3,1.0,11/11/2016,"My 3 coworkers and I went to BJ's in Modesto, CA Friday  11/11/16 to celebrate a new career opportunity to one of us, we had drinks and dinner as well as dessert . We finished our dessert and we're in the middle of a conversation when the manager at this hour went to our table and ask us to leave due to a ""2 hr policy"" that only allows customers to stay in the restaurant no longer that that time. All 4 of us purshased dinners and pay to have a good time. None of us have felt so unwelcome as we did in this occasion."
Shelly R.,"Fremont, CA",185,7,8,5.0,4/10/2017,"Angelina saved the day! if it wasn't for this very lovely manager this experience wouldn't have been so great... so a little bit of a back story, I work in the mall so I come to Bj's for lunch / dinner often and their service is usually out of this world but this experience was very different from the rest! The hostess was very rude and did not check my friend and I in, in a timely manner and once I approached her, she shrugged me off and didn't even acknowledged that we were there. Once we were finally seated our server was very kind and got the manager, Angelina, for us in a timely manner. We had explained to Angelina the situation and surely enough she took great care of us! She was very kind and understanding of the situation, she made my experience 1000x better so because of her and all the other great experiences I had before this one, I give this restaurant a 5 out of 5!"
Olivia M.,"Ripon, CA",0,40,6,1.0,3/11/2017,"I came here today for lunch, brought my little sister for a nice lunch & some shopping. Long story short it took 20 minutes for us to get our DRINKS, I'm not exaggerating, 20. The waitress had orange hair, she never said her name but was super rude. Didn't even bring us plates with our appetizer. Then she went on her lunch break & we had another waitress with brown hair who was a little better. They never even introduced themselves with names. I waitressed for 6 years & this was highly disappointing. My poor younger sister was so thirsty for 20 minutes ! Who is managing these servers? I usually love this BJs, but today HORRIBLE SERVICE"
Drew D.,"Modesto, CA",2,12,1,1.0,11/27/2016,Not even sure if this place is worth one star. A group of friends and I came here for my friend's birthday. As multiple people were finishing their meals and getting to-go boxes one of my friends still hadn't even gotten her soup while another had yet to receive her potstickers that were ordered 25 minutes before hand. Not to mention the hair that was found in the birthday girl's dinner!! Currently sitting here waiting on another one of my friend's pizooki while everyone else already got theirs. Overall the service was just awful and not worth the wait at all. -2/5 stars
Haunani B.,"Napa, CA",1,6,2,3.0,3/3/2017,Great food today and good service.  Really enjoyed our time.  Reasonably priced as well.
Marcus T.,"Sacramento, CA",1,2,,2.0,3/21/2017,Bad customer service at the bar. But really good food and drinks; I just wish the bartenders were more friendly and now so cocky!!
Joan P.,"Livermore, CA",7,3,2,1.0,1/23/2017,"Service needs improvement and food was cold. Manager came out to apologize and say she will make sure the kitchen staff will do better in the future. She did offer to give me a free dessert. Later I hear her apologizing to the table next to us, and offering more free desserts. What a bad way to spend celebrating my friends birthday. Will stay away from BJ's Restaurant from now on!"
Bill A.,"Modesto, CA",0,109,,1.0,10/16/2017,"The truth is, this place is just simply awful and overpriced. I've been there a few times because it's convenient, but I've now given up on it. It always takes between a half hour and 60 minutes to receive your order, whether for dinner or on a tight lunch schedule. A few times I've had to walk out because it took to long. The last time I was there for dinner, it took 40 minutes and the steak was so covered with black pepper (after I told them light on the seasoning), scraping it off wouldn't even make it edible. the waiter took it back, but never even so much as asked if I wanted anything else until he brought the bill, and we were ready to leave. I had honestly thought that since he didn't ask if I wanted something else, they were going to correct the problem and bring me another steak. It's also one of the few restaurants that doesn't offer any bread with dinner, you actually have to pay for it. A few weeks before that, I tried their spaghetti which was worse than something you would find in the freezer section of the local grocery store. It boggles the mind as to how someone can mess up a simple marinara sauce so badly it become inedible. It just seems the quality of chain restaurant fare has been getting worse and worse, while prices keep going up and up. BJ's however is a new low."
Karen C.,"San Jose, CA",163,507,424,3.0,8/23/2015,"My friends and I were shopping at the mall and decided to have lunch here.  I would say our food was good and the service was excellent but the AC was on so high, the place was like a meat locker.  I told the hostess when we walked in and she said she would talk to the manager.  Well the AC was never changed and I froze through the whole meal.  I complained later to the waiter and he apologized but the AC was still not changed. For our entrees, we had the Garlic Chicken Pesto flatbread pizza, the Kale and Roasted Brussels Sprouts Salad on the EnLIGHTed menu, and the tomato soup in a bread bowl.   I had the salad and really loved it.  Lots of good toppings: Baby kale, herb-roasted brussels sprouts, romaine, blueberries, red grapes, dried cranberries, goat cheese, cucumber, candied pecans, toasted pepitas and red onions tossed in strawberry vinaigrette. My friend who had the soup wished there had been more soup.  I don't think they took enough bread out of the middle.   Our server was very attentive.  He brought us refills and checked on us frequently.  Definitely a great waiter. So I may be back here as I enjoy BJ's but hopefully the AC will not be on so high."
James S.,"Alameda, CA",425,316,1,2.0,5/12/2015,"This place is ok.  I came here to watch the warriors game last night.  waited for about 15 minutes to get the menu.  once i got the menu, it was good from there. it's your typical chain restaurant.  nothing fancy."
Kevin B.,"Weatherford, TX",0,6,,5.0,7/30/2017,"I'm very pleased with BJ's. It has a comprehensive menu and it has something for everyone. I highly recommend the Super salad (with quinoa and kale) and the Kale Brussels Sprout salad. That's always what I get and I'm never disappointed. Also, my server was Kelsey. She has been my server twice and this girl hustles! She has a bright future."
Ruben B.,"Lodi, CA",3,11,1,2.0,1/23/2017,"I've been here before and service was fine. But it's probably because I've only sat at the bar and the bartender is always there. But last night I went to dinner with a friend and our server Wilman kept rushing us as if he was getting off work or needed to be somewhere. That obviously wasn't the case since we sat there for some time after we had paid for our tab, and he happened to get 5 more tables back to back. Not to mention he did not give me correct change!! I felt robbed.  I recommend someone go over steps of service with him, and not overwhelm him with too many tables."
