Gineeta L.,"Manteca, CA",59,57,56,4.0,11/2/2016,First overall good experience here sometimes they are so slow and I think the servers are a bit tipsy...but aside. from that the tomato bisque was delicious as well as lettuce wraps.  Kids really liked the smiley face fries and little more variety on  kids  menu then the average hamburger hotdogs Mac n cheese option. our Carmel Pazzoki was delicious.  Server was very nice as well.
Dan D.,"Modesto, CA",0,51,3,2.0,1/20/2017,"Great ambience, gracious host and staff. Why are all the restaurants putting in all the tvs? Feel like I'm at a loud sports bar. Four thirty on a Friday and service felt slow.  I had soup, which was good but it was just barely like warm. I also had the root beer glazed ribs. The sauce on the ribs was really good, unfortunately the ribs were burnt and crunch. A little char is good on a rib but these unfortunately were burnt. The side of Asian slaw was to hot for me and the cabbage was limp, inedible. My friend had some kind of bacon brisket burger, it wasn't very appealing and he said it was just ok. He said it wasn't as good as those he's had in the past.  This place has always been hit and miss for food. I guess this was one of those miss times. Sorry, won't be back for a long while."
Tasha H.,"Modesto, CA",0,2,,5.0,2/10/2017,"Our family's favorite place! Beautiful, clean space, friendly staff and yummy food. Love their beer!"
Lisa M.,"Modesto, CA",75,30,6,1.0,3/4/2016,"I came here with my coworkers (4 of us)  for the lunch specials, we had an hour lunch break. It was not very crowded and we were seated after 3 minutes and not sure we had to wait at all. Bunch of empty tables, The sever didn't smile or introduce her self. It took a while to get our drinks and orders placed. This place was really dead yet the service so slow, by that time only 2 out 4 people at my table had gotten their food and our lunch break was ending soon. Soup was served cold. We returned it which took forever. My salad had no dressing.  We had to get our food to go before we even ate it.  It took more time sending those items back. Our office will not go back for lunch."
Sam M.,"Modesto, CA",22,13,,1.0,3/27/2016,"I'll keep it simple. Some of their food is good, but they have consistently horrible service. Every time I give BJ's another chance, I end up regretting it with their unrelenting poor service. UPDATE: I contacted the person who commented below and never got a response... Maybe just trying to seem like they have better service than they actually do?"
Dimitry E.,"Modesto, CA",159,5,,3.0,1/12/2017,"Big menu, its a chain restaurant and runs like one.  Nothing bad, sometimes service is a little slow but mostly its pretty good spot."
David K.,"Manteca, CA",7,14,30,5.0,10/7/2016,"Great time with Lindsay. She's a great bartender. The Westlake location can learn a lot from this place.  They have some great team work,  yes they do have there bad days, but they are far and few between."
Eric P.,"Manteca, CA",6,91,28,2.0,6/9/2017,"I went to bj restaurant today for lunch with my family and I felt like my whole experience was not great. First off! I felt like the waitress was rushing us to order and she was not attentive to us at all. We didn't have any silverware, just the whole experience was not great!"
Gursewak B.,"San Jose, CA",0,1,,1.0,7/3/2017,Pretty ridiculous service for a party if 9. We waited over a hour to just order our food. Server didn't not recognize and was pretty rude when bringing out our drinks. I'd avoid the location for party with of 4 or more
Ken S.,"Turlock, CA",24,113,25,4.0,10/12/2016,"This restaurant has a variety of great food and a great selection of craft beers. If you like, you can order an assortment of these beers to sample...they come in small quantities. My wife usually orders a different entree each time. Some day I'll explore the menu, but each time I'm there I'm drawn to one of their ""brew house"" burgers with skinny fries. Not a cheap burger, but well worth the price. Also, great waitresses."
DeMaris Y.,"Modesto, CA",23,3,,5.0,1/12/2017,"Great food, great service, Hannah was awesome! I will definitely be back again. Next time for dinner rather than lunch so I can take my time and enjoy the ambiance. I would definitely recommend this place to friends! Bon Appetite!"
Hungry M.,"Prince Rupert, Canada",0,42,,3.0,12/31/2016,BJ's is typical chain-restaurant food. Lots of options to choose from and reasonably priced. TONS of drink options. BJ beers are actually pretty good. Service is good and super friendly.
Marissa M.,"Los Angeles, CA",22,357,91,4.0,8/23/2015,"This was our second time coming as we havent been here in almost a year.  I have to say the food was delicious.  My burger was made well this time and was greatly enjoyed.  The beer was cool and fresh.  At first I was kind of iffy, I was with 4 other family members and all their drinks where brought and our server brought all the drinks except mine.. and then asked for our orders and I had to ask her again for my lemonade.  Another thing was that when we had chips and salsa, and we ran out of chips but their was plenty of salsa as we had not yet recieved our food.  Our server came and asked to take the plate and if we where done, we assumed she would automatically just replace the chips being we had more salsa left.  But all in all it was super pleasant and the food was great, and thats what counts :-)"
Marnie B.,"Oakdale, CA",20,12,2,1.0,7/27/2016,"Boy oh boy, I was invited to dinner with my good friend  & her family at B.J.'s by the mall for a Special Fund Raiser for their Church!!! It was the WORST Service Ever!!! It started out waiting 20 minutes for a table, then we were seated at 6:20, by 6:30 NO One came by to get Beverage order! So my friends husband went to find someone & I Called B.J.'s while Sitting at the table! Finally a Server showed up! It went Downhill from there. There were 6 of us, 4 Adults & 2 Children, we Waited anywhere from 20-60 Minutes for our Beverages to Arrive! Then we had to Wait for Silverware & Napkins! Finally food came, But they Messed up her husband's order, plus he Didn't get his Soda until an Hour After we were Seated! It was a 'Comedy of Errors' Except it Wasn't Funny!!! my friend Waited 30 minutes for a glass of wine, her friend Waited 40 minutes for her Beer, the Boy's Waited 35 minutes for their Beverages!!! I Waited 3 Times to get my Water Refilled! We were there 2 hours & 20 minutes, We even Waited 20 minutes for our Dessert After the Manager Personally took the Order!!! I asked a server to Close the Blinds, since the Sun was in my Eyes, I Thanked her & she just Glared at me and Kept Walking!!! The Manager Apologised, but Our Server ""Disappeared"" for 45 minutes, then ""Miraculously"" he Appeared when the Manager Showed up to see how things were going! The food was good, but Not good Enough to go through the Grief we went Through & we Were NOT the Only Customers having problems!!! I realize that they were busy from all the Fund Raiser Guests, but that is NO Excuse for Not being ""Prepared"" for Customers, it's Not like this was Sprung on them the last minute, this is the 2nd time a Fund Raiser had been held there!!! They Didn't even Reduce the Bill, but it's ok our Server was left a .19 tip   :-) I won't Ever go back to B.J.'s!!!"
Nicole W.,"Turlock, CA",0,2,,5.0,6/29/2017,"My husband and I have been to BJs on multiple occasions. The food is always good and the service ranges. We have had the servers that are visibly flustered, non-attentive, or seem so rushed they forget items. However, this evening Loggan was our waiter and his service was absolutely great. I spoke with the Manager on Duty to inform her of how great he was. He was attentive to not only our table, but the tables around us. He was very customer service oriented and always made sure to ask if there was anything else we needed. Thank you Loggan for the great customer service. As a manager, it is hard to come across employees that have the natural ability to offer a positive memorable experience. Thank you again."
Daisy A.,"Modesto, CA",0,5,4,1.0,7/26/2016,"I usually receive exceptional service when I sit at the bar, unfortunately tonight was very different. My usual bartender is Yvonne and she is the absolute best, but tonight it was a young white male that was just terrible. He was accompanied by a younger female, which did not even bother to acknowledge my presence. I asked the male if he would mind wiping down the bar before we receive our menus. He said sure, but proceeded to attend other customers at the bar. I understood and continued to wait patiently, unfortunately he never came around to wipe down the bar top nor give us our menus. So we decided to take our business else where and will not be returning for a while, which is unfortunate because we love this place."
M P.,"Modesto, CA",0,6,3,2.0,9/25/2017,"We decided to eat here for lunch on Sunday, showed up close to 12:30 pm. We had a group of 7 so we knew there would be a wait. We checked in with the hostess, she tells us it will be 20 minutes and asks if we want to receive a text message when our table is ready. We say yes, enter in our phone number for the text and go outside to wait on the bench. About 15 minutes later we get a text saying our table is ready. We go inside, let the hostess know we got the text and she asks us to wait over by the side. The place she had us stand to wait for our table happened to be the stroller corral, so we were squishing together each time a new stroller was parked. We waited in the stroller corral for over 5 minutes while they sat several more customers. Finally, I ask who I assume was the manager (she was ordering the hostess and waitresses around) what we were waiting on since we received a text message that our table was ready. She jumped down my throat saying she called our name 3 times and we didn't answer so they gave our table away. I asked why she called us when we asked for the text message. At first she said she didn't know we wanted to be text messaged but when I called her out on that (considering we got a text message from them) she became even angrier and started arguing with me that we should have heard her calling our name and should have answered her if we wanted to be seated. She also asked why we didn't text them back to let them know we were coming in! What the hell??! We were literally right outside the front door and walked in as soon as we got the text! She was rude and extremely argumentative. I am NOT one of those ""the customer is always right"" person, but in this case, she was flat out wrong. We followed what they offered, a text service to notify when the table was ready. We weren't asked to text back, we walked right in and then we were berated by this so-called manager. We cancelled our table request and walked right across the way to Buffalo Wild Wings, had great food and great service. We were seated within 5 minutes on game day Sunday at 1 pm. As for BJs, they lost a $150 tab due to poor management. My suggestion to them, don't offer a texting service if you don't know how to use it."
Angelica U.,"Modesto, CA",0,1,,1.0,12/3/2016,Place took so many days. Came with a group and they said we'd wait 25 mins but an hour had already passed and we still had not been seated but others who came in after us were getting seated. The server was rude when we asked what was taking so long.
Sarah A.,"Modesto, CA",472,35,447,2.0,1/30/2016,"I used to love this place but it's gotten really poor in service lately. I called in to place my name to get a shorter waiting time, which they told me 20-30 minutes. Then when I arrived and I told them that I called in before I still had to wait for 45 minutes. The waitress was very kind and visited our table often. I really only good here for the pizookies because the pizza is only below average. They don't a whole lot to choose from so one can only find themselves going here if they had a craving for it."
Yvonne R.,"Modesto, CA",19,2,,1.0,7/28/2016,"Just had terrible customer service on the managers level waited 20 minutes for guacamole and chips and never got them but bartender very nice manager complete incompetent.  Hopefully they will credit back my card I cannot believe manager was happy with a terrible review. She basically insisted so here you go, you can't plan blame the wait staff if this is their leaders."
