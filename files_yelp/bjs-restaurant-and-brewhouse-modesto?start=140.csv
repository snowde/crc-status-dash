Kevin A.,"Salida, CA",0,4,,1.0,6/2/2017,"Worst place I've been to. I've seen more enthusiasm in a morgue. The service is almost non existent. We (7 of us) were seated and literally ignored. I had to physically stop a server to help us and that was 45 minutes in to us being seated. You know BJ's, your a pathetic example of a restaurant"
Brooke H.,"Modesto, CA",181,4,2,1.0,11/27/2016,"Ordered soup and salad combo to come out at the same time. My salad came out at the same time as everyone else's main dish at my table, but my soup came out 25 minutes later because they didn't have enough prepared. My friends even were getting to go boxes when I still haven't received the rest of my meal. I would've rather ordered something else but they didn't give that option. ‼ Samkhid L was our server, she was professional I guess but the miscommunication is unacceptable. There was also a hair in my friends salad... if 0 stars was an option, I'd choose it"
Melissa H.,"Turlock, CA",97,6,,2.0,10/23/2016,"Worse experience ever!!! Had to send almost everything back ! Ordered a rib eye and it was cold, my kids burger -cold our waters were warm..."
May Y.,"Merced, CA",21,2,,1.0,4/21/2017,"I was here earlier today and the food looked good but the service was awful! Was there at 11:15, faxed our orders the day before because we were on a time budget and it still took them 30 mins to get our food to us.  Then went over 20 mins to get us our cks. Not so good."
Tierhog S.,"Modesto, CA",59,33,2,2.0,11/6/2016,"Slow to seat.  Slow to serve.  Food is OK.  Perhaps, all restaurants on Dale are slow?  Just allow plenty of time and expect weekend waits in the 60-90min range.  If that doesn't bother you,  you should be fine."
Esho D.,"Chicago, IL",1,9,,1.0,10/4/2015,"First question our waitress asks, ""Would you guys like to start out with some drinks or appetizers?""  Sure! We ordered the stuffed mushrooms and fried artichoke hearts. We also ordered two pepsis.  Waitress congress back a couple minutes later to take our entree orders. Waitress completely disappears for a half hour. Appetizers never show. Entrees arrive about 40 minutes in. Still no appetizers. Waitress finally arrives about 5 minutes after food does. ""Is everything tasting fine?"" Sure! Except we never received the appetizers. I'd like to cancel them at this point. She says no problem and leaves. At this point my glass  has been empty for about ten minutes. Waitress a no show. Meal is finally done and still no waitress, but something else does arrive... Ahhh there are the wonderful appetizers only an hour late and a half hour after we cancelled them:) Never got a refill, but got the check real quick. Service here absolutely sucks and the food isn't anything to write home about either. Wish i would have gone to BWW next door instead. At least you go there with an expectation of mediocre food and service."
Marian T.,"Ceres, CA",59,96,52,3.0,6/30/2016,Service was mediocre. I felt they were understaffed and only had one waitress. this has always been the case with service-extremely delayed.don't know if its the cooks in the back who aren't organized or the overwhelmed waitress who can't handle all the tables at once (which i don't blame) HOWEVER if you smile and engage i bet you'd be making more tips....just sayin
Robyn R.,"Rosemead, CA",8,16,5,1.0,6/9/2016,I should of known by walking in and it being super empty. I just moved here from Los Angeles and the bjs over there are beautiful. With chandeliers and great ambiance. The one in Pasadena looks awesome on the inside and food is great. This location was horrible.  Our drinks were good we got strawberry lemonades. We ordered a deep dish pizza and side salad. The salad was so small and I literally ate it in like 3 bites. The pizza came and was cold :( won't be coming here again. To get the full BJs experience go to LA trust me.
Katie T.,"Valley Springs, CA",289,16,,1.0,9/5/2016,Had a pretty poor experience here today. Our orders kept getting mixed up with other tables.  The waiter argued with my friend when her order came out wrong and insisted that's what she wanted. I was pretty disappointed in the slow service as well.
Hunter L.,"Modesto, CA",104,23,26,2.0,6/29/2016,I really enjoy the food here. However the service lately has been keeping me from wanting to come back. We asked the server simply to help with some recommendations on the menu and he told us it not my choice it's yours. Never have I ever had a server do that to me. I would not consider this place a family friendly environment. I work in this industry and I would never say that to a customer. This place is slowly falling apart. Sad to see. Two stars because I do enjoy the food.
Karman S.,"Manteca, CA",0,12,,3.0,4/8/2017,"This place is just like any other BJs. Always crowded, okay food, and mediocre service. It seems as if BJs menu has shrunken over the years and I'm not very impressed with what's left. It's only about one notch above diner food. The only real appeal of coming here is for the pizookies."
Robin N.,"Tracy, CA",14,6,,5.0,3/13/2016,Angela W is by far the best server we have ever had at this location. She has an amazing smile and positive attitude we enjoyed our lunch  Food served in a timely matter. We do not live in the area but will revisit
Maddison B.,"Arlington, VA",0,2,,5.0,4/1/2017,My sister and I go to BJ's often and we have never received the customer service that we got from Elliot. He was amazing and on a busy Saturday night! Best customer service we have ever received there. Made sure we had everything we asked for and we didn't have to wait or ask more than once! Very satisfied!
PrabSimran B.,"Manteca, CA",54,26,5,2.0,5/15/2016,"Alright so this is a normal spot we go to since we live so close but this time we came here and it was by far one of the worst services. We ordered out food and about an hour and ten minutes later the food came out cold. One of the orders was wrong and when we told our server it was not the right order she basically said do we not want it or what. On top of waiting so long, the food was cold. The server then asked if I need a refill on my regular Pepsi, she brings me back a glass full of diet Pepsi. The manager was informed and he was kind enough to offer us a pazooki on the  house. Besides bad service the manager handled the situation well."
Felicia G.,"Salida, CA",151,47,27,5.0,8/1/2016,"I love coming here I love the atmosphere the servers are always nice and my food cravings are always satisfied. I always get the house salad with crispy chicken salad, and an order of pot stickers. I've switched it up a few times but that's defiantly my go to. Potato wedges are good, chili baked potato, regular baked potato, chicken Alfredo everything I've ever ordered was good."
Erika C.,"Sacramento, CA",160,35,48,5.0,6/22/2016,Took my dad here for fathers day they showed him nothing but respect and served him everything he ordered the way he ordered it no problems
Mike C.,"Salida, CA",0,7,,4.0,3/21/2017,Great and beer! If your lucky enough to sit at the bar and have Marcus help you you're for definitely in for some great service and positive vibrations!
Miriam L.,"Atwater, CA",6,6,,2.0,7/20/2015,"I have to start by saying I love BJs just this one specifically is not like most that I've been to.  The first time i came here with my bf before we were served a waitress tripped and hit a customer causing the customer to drop her beer on my boy friend. I mean it was an honest accident completely understandable but that same waitress was our waitress and she was very rude.  She rushed us through our meal and forgot to get a drink I asked for four times, even though I didn't get it I was charged. I was so frustrated because she didn't have any other tables and we didn't show up 30min before closing, so there was no excuse for such frustrating service.  This was just one visit, just know the service is not like your usual BJs."
Daniel A.,"Modesto, CA",0,5,,5.0,9/10/2016,"Best damn food ever! Ive had the burgers and steak and their both amazing. The ravioli is also really good and a good size, it does take a while but its so worth it."
Kay g.,"Manteca, CA",1,14,7,3.0,2/15/2017,"Good ribs, but got burnt pasta for my daughter. They replaced it with good one. Good services"
