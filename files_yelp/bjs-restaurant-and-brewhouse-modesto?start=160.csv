Christina F.,"Manteca, CA",10,33,,1.0,1/23/2017,"Usually have the best food and service here, unfortunately this last time was horrible. Salad was ice cold, I mean so cold it hurt our teeth! The food was nothing special at all. The waiter was more worried about a different table, he would literally ask us is howwe were doing as he walked by us, When we tried respond to tell him about the salads he would keep waking! We had to tell someone else. Seems to be a pattern from what I'm seeing on other reviews, to bad cause I use to love coming here when I would hit up the mall. GAVE IT A SHOT AGAIN! Well gave it a shot again cause like I said I use to love this place.. no better then the last time. Waitress was very bland, I mean like not rude, but not friendly or attentive to our table either. Food was very cold again!!!! Except for the caprees sandwich my daughter ordered.. that was amazing!!  I don't think complaining would have done any good because by the time my food was redone, my daughter would have ate hers already. When we asked for juice for my granddaughter the waitress just seemed annoyed, maybe because we asked for ketchup before that. Oh well I won't stop going to bj's I will just not go to the one in Modesto."
David B.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,15,,1.0,2/14/2017,"Been here many many time and always leave happy with food and service but last Sunday went there party of 4 with reservation and still wait for table no problem coz I used to work food and beverages industry so I know. At the beginning our waitress seems good so order appetizer come but no share plate my kids order come out wrong and I expect my fires small and crunchy how they used to have and I ask she said they just change so it's ok but she willing give me same fries I used to have and even manager come and said he is making fries for me I was so happy but when fries come it was not the one they used to have? It was soggy can't even eat so it's I just don't bother, what makes me so disappoint no service she disappears and after 10-15min later guy came and said she went for break and he will take over but barely show up and so slow now I have to think twice to go again"
Shannon F.,"Oakdale, CA",387,123,644,4.0,12/22/2015,"I give four stars for service and food. You get what you pay for. I'm not expecting harvest moon. I ordered a ceaser salad and tortilla soup. It's great! The martini is great, too. Exactly how I ordered it!!!"
Seth M.,"Modesto, CA",12,65,1,4.0,7/8/2016,"I love this place. I've been to three or four different BJ's restaurants around the country, and it is consistently terrific. They seriously have the best deep dish pizza ever. Sweet Pig and Pepperoni Extreme are my personal favorites. Their beer selection is top notch if not a bit pricey. Their wine pours seem very pricey, but I'd argue you get two solid glasses from each. Huge menu, good ambiance, great employees."
Anush D.,"Merced, CA",0,19,1,1.0,6/21/2017,"Maria is honest to god the worst waitress we've ever had. When we got there, she took our drink and app orders and then spent 35 MINUTES chit chatting with her friends at the next table. She then told us she would 'check' on our calamari and didn't even bother to take our order. And then disappeared for another 10 minutes. Seriously. And then she brought our calamari and took our orders. When I told her I want the BBQ pulled pork she told me they 'might' be out of the pulled pork. I told her if that's the case I'll have fish and chips. Waited and waited. All of a sudden another waitress comes up and tells us she's gonna take care of us for the night. NEVER got another answer from Maria about the fish n chips/pulled pork. After a few the waitress tells us they're out of both (keep in mind my bf has his food by now). So I ask for a menu. And re-order. And this was on my birthday. Seriously, if you go to this BJ's make sure you don't sit in Maria's section. Don't. She was the worst waitress I've ever had. I plan on contacting corporate about her."
George S.,"Turlock, CA",155,3,1,3.0,1/31/2016,"Chicken potstickers are the best I've ever had. The fish and chips are also very good. As an added plus, you can journey across the street to the Apple Store while you wait to be seated. Went again Jan. 30, 2016. Worst service ever. They ruined the clam chowder on a sourdough bowl by over toasting it. I asked them to bring me a better one, but the second one took 20 minutes and was worse than the first. Pazookies are great but service was way too slow. Manager took the clam chowder off my check but didn't make up for the horrible experience. I'm torn now on this place. Dropped my overall rating to 3 from 4."
Mary D.,"Modesto, CA",0,40,,2.0,5/20/2016,This location is not the best. Service is waaaay slow. Twice already our appetizers never came out... our drink refills take forever...even when its not busy. They are never apologetic.  I gave them two chances so my family and I will not be back and my friends and I will meet somewhere else....
Ian S.,"Arden, NC",0,13,,1.0,1/13/2017,Way over rated pizza. Ordered a pizza and got a pizza with cheese no sauce . Bread and cheese. Wow  that's 20 dollars that went to waste.Better pizza at papa johns  for the money. I asked about it and she said we put the sauce on light. Really how cheep can you be. I should have just ordered cheese sticks and a glass of water . Poor service.
Leslie R.,"Round Rock, TX",4,7,,1.0,7/31/2017,"I understand that restaurants have human beings working for them and mistakes are made, heck I make mistakes all the time. What makes a difference is how it's address and handled when it does happen. This is where they failed in my experience. I ordered the tuna seared salad specifically because it has avocado in it and I was having a crazy craving for it. When it was delivered, no avocado. I kindly informed my server and she graciously apologized and took it back. When my second salad arrived (delivered by someone other than my server) it had no avocado in it. When my server returned to check in I told her and she was embarrassed at the point. She offered to take it back... I suggested she bring me a side of avocado. She agreed, apologized again, and said she would have a manager come by my table. Well, that never happened. You'd think this would be a time that would warrant it. Who knows what happened, maybe she told the manager, maybe she didn't, maybe the manager stepped out, who knows, there's the human being factor again, right? Will I return there next time I'm in town, likely. However, I hope the manager reads these reviews and hopefully will use it as a training opportunity as to what to do when this happens... servers should treat things like this as ""mission critical"" and send someone, anyone, by the table and ""act"" like a manager to apologize. Food for thought."
Bobbie G.,"Modesto, CA",214,96,16,4.0,10/30/2015,Always busy so be prepared to wait unless you would like to snag a seat at the bar (if they even have a open seat )  Food has always been wonderful  They also have a gluten free menu !!  The balsamic chicken is AMAZING !!  The lettuce wraps are a MUST HAVE
Vishakha G.,"Modesto, CA",56,89,14,1.0,4/30/2015,"Been here thrice . The food is not bad at all. Avacado egg rolls and the veg pizza were good . The problem wasn't the food . It was the crappiest service I have received in my history on this planet. NOT ONLY was did the waitresses  obviously hate their jobs , they  were  inattentive, disappeared for long periods , were rude . In my latest experience here the waitress gave us dirty napkins dropped her tray and splashed water on everyone and didn't even apologize . Just the worst service I've ever encountered. She then picked up my plate and dripped food on me and when I told her she did that she said "" what did you say ? "" so I repeated my self . And she said ""oh "" .   Don't go here if you want to be treated like a decent  human being. Update - was asked to contact lady . I did . No response . Maybe a show to make you feel like they take you seriously."
Billy P.,"Modesto, CA",1,9,,5.0,1/15/2017,"Gotta love BJs!! Had lunch there today, English was our server and she was fantastic.  Food was great the Mediterranean pizza is amazing along with our favorite the beignet with ice cream and strawberries. Thanks again Miss. English."
Neel P.,"Modesto, CA",0,2,,1.0,1/14/2017,"Worst service ever, I've always enjoyed eating there but this trip left our family feeling discriminated against. Another table received our appetizers, my youngest sons order was done incorrectly and he ate his meal 20 mins after all of us were done. Other people were getting their food well ahead of our order. Just didn't feel right."
Mar D.,"Manteca, CA",1,53,17,4.0,6/21/2015,"Been here a handful of times, usually for a Special Occasions so I expect a wait.  Today for Fathers Day wasn't too bad at all. We got a table after only 20 minutes! Our waitress was very nice & attentive! She brought drinks out quickly & kept them filled during our stay.  Only negative is that some of our favorite menu items are no longer available (Pot Roast, Chicken Pasta) Pizza is just Ok.. Overall a nice place for Lunch/Dinner"
Claire N.,"Valley Springs, CA",0,3,,2.0,5/3/2016,"I ordered fried chicken that came with mashed potatoes and corn ""succotash"" and it honestly tasted identical to a KFC famous bowl, I think they're called. The quality of the food is just not very good, like fast food or microwave meals. Which would be alright if it were cheap, but it's regular restaurant prices."
Tylor M.,"Seaside, CA",39,94,3,1.0,3/20/2015,"This is one of my wife's favorite restaurants.  I used to eat here all the time when I lived in Modesto.  The last two times I've been in touch with this BJ's were two of the worst experiences I've ever had with any restaurant. On my wife's birthday, we came in with a group of about 10 family members.  We called ahead and showed up early, and the hosting staff told us it would be about 45 minutes wait after we arrived.  We weren't seated for over 2 hours.  More than half of the food ordered at our table had to be sent back.  Dishes were cold, unseasoned, and/or entirely wrong.  I chalked this one up to a fluke. We tried to go back for my wife's baby shower.  I called 6 hours in advance to see if they thought they could seat 7.  The hostess was quite short with me and said she would check with a manager.  After being on hold for 9 minutes, another person picked up the phone and asked how they could help.  I repeated my request, and said that someone was checking with the manager.  This employee told me the manager was in a meeting and would return my call within 15 minutes.  I didn't hear back, so I called an hour later.  The first employee answered the phone.  I repeated my request yet again.  She snapped at me and told me that they would not be able to accommodate us at all that evening, but that we were welcome to ""come by and walk the dining area.""  I was confused, and said ""no, thank you"" and that we would ""look for another place to eat."" An utter shame.  I'm glad I now live close to a BJ's that employs people who remember they are in the service industry, and who treat their customers with respect.  We went to BJ's in Salinas last night and had an excellent experience!  Thanks, Jeremy!"
Fav C.,"Los Angeles, CA",75,31,21,5.0,11/27/2015,Emily was our food server such a doll! Came in from la for some thanksgiving fun...hit up the mall for Black Friday.  Worn out and ready for some yummy food was please my greeted by a bouncy sweetheart! Loved her service wish they all could be like her.
Jennifer A.,"Modesto, CA",176,35,183,5.0,9/12/2015,"One of my favorite restaurants not only for the good food, but also for the fact that when I come here to relax & watch a game, the girls already know my drink of choice & what food I want to order!!! Love  it here!!"
Avery J.,"Ceres, CA",509,1,,3.0,4/30/2016,Always a long wait. The little blonde girl said we had to wait and hour so I was going to walk out. Then another girl with long hair and braces got us sat in les then 5 minutes Thank you. I had a good waiter and the southern fried chicken was good
Willie Y.,"Modesto, CA",22,71,5,2.0,3/28/2016,"Fry it more next time, why don't u? Just order the pizza or any of the appetizers with their beer and you should be ok. Even those aren't that appetizing but they'll do. The only reason places like that exist is cause of word of mouth due to ambiance, location, and convenience. Other than that, it's fake, fried and generic food that they serve you."
