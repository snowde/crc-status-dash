L. T.,"Tracy, CA",40,61,36,2.0,4/1/2016,"I used to love coming to BJ's but it's kind of gone downhill. The last couple experiences weren't that great. The servers are nice, The drinks are expensive, the food isn't as good as it used to be. That's a bummer, this used to be one of my favorites & now id rather go somewhere else. Sorry BJ's, I'm disappointed to write this review."
Kevin B.,"Easley, SC",0,19,3,3.0,7/30/2015,"I'm so confused about California. When I want my burger RARE, I want them to ""wipe his butt and put him on the plate"".  I'll chalk it up to liability issues, but extra rare obviously means soles that have less than 2 miles on them.  The service here is wonderful. Very busy (was here at happy hour) and it was a short wait and friendly staff.  Cost was reasonable and they made the over done burger right on the bill.  Would recommend to friends and family."
Dalton P.,"Turlock, CA",23,3,,1.0,4/3/2016,$22 for the rib eye steak was burnt and was nothing but fat. Horrible food along with hit and miss service. Do not come here to celebrate your birthday.
Heather O.,"Modesto, CA",101,34,47,5.0,4/26/2016,"My friends and I like to come here for drinks and appetizers. We always get great service, drink prices are good, and more then anything we come back because of their bartenders.  Chris and Justin are awesome. We always have the best time when they work."
Anne M.,"Edison, NJ",14,51,4,4.0,4/29/2016,"I have been here a couple of times when visiting my parents.  The menu is good, the beer selection is excellent.  I find the service to be fine and the atmosphere is better than I had anticipated.  We ran into an issue with time and slow food the last time I was in but the server was fantastic in responding to the problem."
Aimee F.,"Ripon, CA",0,4,,3.0,12/13/2016,The one thing that gets me every time I go here is how long it takes for service/meals/check.  I understand they get busy but so does every other restaurant in that area. Even when they are slow Im still getting slow service. Other than that they have a great menu and the staff is generally pretty nice
C M.,"Atwater, CA",0,2,,1.0,3/31/2016,"If I could give negative stars, I would. Wish I could write a food review about this place, but we never even got seated. We were told the wait time was 50 minutes. After waiting for an hour, we asked the hostess if there was an update on our wait time. Turns out, they never entered our name into the system. People make mistakes, I get that. But BJ's assumed no responsibility (in fact, they actually accused us of being out of range of the sensor, when we were actually seated by the counter the entire time) and continued to make us wait for an additional 30 minutes before we finally decided to leave. Thank the Lord above for Chili's across the street for seating us in less than a minute."
Richelle S.,"Triangle, VA",3,38,1,3.0,7/25/2015,Four of us in the group. Not very busy but drinks took longer than expected. We started off with the Buffalo Wings. They did not have much sauce but look very appetizing. Had to wait for silverware while our mouths watered. Hope it tastes better than the anticipation. It did taste very good. Our entrées were good but not great. Nothing special.
GAIL M.,"Newman, CA",60,88,110,3.0,2/25/2016,"Came here today with the husband and grandson. Our waitress and can't remember her name was pretty friendly. My husband ordered the French dip and he truly enjoyed it. I tried it and it was so so for me. I had the lunch special and half a sandwich which was the California club,  tomato bisque was heavenly and the shoe string fries. The  fries were crispy and crunchy exactly how I like my fries. My grandson who is sitting next to me said the fries are good. I would like to go back again. But I will have to split plate of food with someone. The plates are huge very  very huge. My grandson said they're very huge."
Devin K.,"Oakland, CA",4,7,,5.0,8/11/2015,"I've been here a few times but my most recent had to have been the best in terms of customer service. The host boy (i believe his name was Efrain) was very kind and helpful,  our server girl (Adriana?) Was excellent as well. The avacado rolls are amazing, and so is the beignet. I am usually disappointed by slow service here but our host and server were both amazing and prompt. Kudos to both of you Regards, D"
InPopeWeTrust P.,"Ceres, CA",4,51,352,4.0,7/7/2015,"Service is good and place is clean. Lots of menu choices. The menu strength is in appetizers, desserts, and drink selection. The place can be noisy but good for groups and large screens for sports."
Jeni M.,"Modesto, CA",32,2,,5.0,5/7/2016,I'm not one to post a review and I expect more than required from any server but today Emily G was just wonderful  Service was quick food was yummy and Emily was adorable and cheerful... One of my best BJ's experiences
Jacinda B.,"Modesto, CA",89,4,,5.0,5/4/2016,This is my favorite restaurant in Modesto. I love all the servers here. Tonight my server was Adrian and he gave excellent service with a smile. I really enjoy the food and the atmosphere here. I will be coming back soon.
Jason G.,"Manteca, CA",14,5,,2.0,3/13/2016,Disappointed me and my wife ordered the ribeye steaks they had no flavor at all  I could of got a better meal at a fast food place the quick service and waitress was good  just disappointed in the food
Cecilia H.,"Modesto, CA",0,3,,5.0,4/28/2016,"When I originally showed up to bjs to share my birthday with my family I was told that the wait was 40 minutes after calling and being told they couldn't reserve but there wouldn't be a wait...but let me tell you our server Nick C made it totally worth the wait. He was very attentive to our needs and very entertaining. I could definitely say he turned our experience from a one star to a five star, one of the best servers my family has had the pleasure of having in a long time! Thank you Nick!!"
Jenny C.,"Salida, CA",8,29,42,4.0,7/2/2015,"I basically come here strictly for the avocado rolls. I can't even remember anything else on the menu. I'm not a big drinker, so this place isn't necessarily my scene...but everyone who is intoxicated really seems to be enjoying themselves! PAZOOKIES! Pazookies are also on the menu!"
Tony S.,"San Francisco, CA",0,8,,1.0,1/2/2015,"Absolutely horrible.  Would give 0 stars if I could.  I was staying in Modesto with my girlfriend around Christmastime and we decided to hit up BJ's for dinner.  Despite my desire to look on the bright side of things, I cannot help but feel utterly disappointed with this place.  WHAT WENT WRONG 1. OLD FOOD BITS IN THE DIP -- It seems this location reuses their dip, because when we ordered appetizers (Santa Fe Spring Rolls) there was a piece of chicken already in the dip.  Pretty gross. 2. FOOD NOT AS DESCRIBED -- There was no avocado in my California burger, which pretty much ruined the experience.  Would have ordered something else if they were out of avocado, but apparently the servers were not aware of what was going on in the kitchen. 3. THEY CARD -- Despite my being WELL above the legal drinking age, I was asked for my ID.  4. RUDE, INATTENTIVE STAFF -- Server would come by and ask how we were doing, but not wait long enough to listen for an answer, rendering their having asked in the first place pointless. CONCLUSION On the bright side, the beer wasn't bad, and we were promptly seated in a booth as requested, but it definitely wasn't good enough to justify the bad experience.  The thought of old food in the dip makes me sick.  Never coming here again."
Bonnie G.,"Modesto, CA",19,2,,2.0,5/16/2016,"I wish they would put their pot roast back on the menu. It was so delicious! I have a very very limited diet so the only thing I can eat at BJ's now is the ribs, dry without any sauce; which you would think would be terrible but they are still delicious! That is at the BJ's in Fresno. I can also eat the white cheddar potatoes which are also delicious at most BJ's  ( I stay in AZ in the summer to babysit my grandsons and their food is also delicious) but for some reason at Modesto's location they are extremely dry. Also the service the last two visits has been lacking.  Did not have place settings on our table, had to ask for them.  Beverages were ordered but never brought until I asked a different server why.  The specifically ordered dry ribs came out with sauce and of course the potatoes were dry as a bone. They do not have ""real"" butter so I cannot use that to try to moisten them.  Asked for gravy and was told they do not have any. Use to be great there when they had the pot roast a few years back.  Also have tried the French dip sandwich which was dry and stringy at this location.  Have not tried it in Fresno yet.  The Pazookie, another use to be favorite of mine, was very doughy,  With me it is usually three strikes your out with a restaurant but since Fresno's location is so much better I will just drive the extra 15 minutes there to eat when I have to.  We live 45 minutes from Modesto and about an hour from Fresno."
Atari S.,"Stockton, CA",158,34,33,2.0,7/13/2016,We had a horrible experience.  The best thing about our entire visit was the greeter at the front.  She was awesome.  After being seated it was as if we no longer existed.  Our entree came 10 minutes before our appetizer.  The person delivering it actually took my salad to two different tables asking if someone ordered it before getting it over to me.  I was disappointed knowing my food had that many people around it before getting to me.  Then the appetizer was finally delivered.  The calimari was over cooked and almost burnt.   I have never received this level of service.  Our server did not even come back to check on us and we ended up paying through the app(which double charged me) because no one even brought our bill out.  This was my second trip to modesto and the first time was not good but we decided to give another try. MISTAKE.  First trip there they delivered part of my order to another table and never even noticed it until I asked them to take it off my bill because we never got it.  I understand it was a large group of us so no harm.
Vanessa R.,"Modesto, CA",0,4,,5.0,4/21/2016,"Was a little skeptical about ordering takeout after having a horrible experience before, but we were around the area so we decided why not. Laura was a very sweet girl and was very talkative. She made sure our order was perfect and the wait was not long at all. Our order was a little complicated and I was surprised how fast she brought out our food. Such a doll. Will order again from her soon."
