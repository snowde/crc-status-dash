Adam E.,"Manteca, CA",168,10,53,4.0,2/26/2015,John B was our server. He was very polite and attentive. Wouldn't mind him being our server again! The food was good as always. Our dessert took a little longer than expected but other than that the meal was perfect!
Cheeks L.,"Modesto, CA",105,158,16,4.0,1/31/2013,"Jeramiah Red... how I love thee.  I really love this location. Lots of friendly faces and great bartenders. *Love me some Lindsay*  Lunch specials are cheap, the food is good, beer is cold and potent. Will always come back."
Lakeshia J.,"Modesto, CA",26,161,34,5.0,9/25/2015,I went here by my lonesome one day because I was starving and didn't want to cook. I sat at the bar. Their service was pretty nice easy going. It wasn't too crowded for a Saturday even with a few games on (baseball mostly). The bartender was very sweet and went out of her way to make a woman's drink a little less spicy (pre made mix really nothing she could do). She also didn't make a big huge fuss when I paid for the older woman next to me meal. Just let me do my good deed and leave; all she said was thanks you're super sweet and went right along bartending. Nice right?  Give it a go
Mike R.,"Escalon, CA",0,4,,2.0,8/11/2014,"I struggle with BJ's. I would truly rate at 2.5 stars, but since that's not available I figured I'd go with 2 (hoping somebody who can make a difference will notice). I like the food, but the service is painfully slow and inadequate. Last time we were there we ordered the Thai shrimp lettuce wraps, which are just a little bit on the messy side, and the server didn't bring any plates, we tried to flag down a couple other servers, but apparently we were in stealth mode because they were unable to notice us, so finally my wife got up to ask the person who was at the little desk near the restrooms, then about 5 minutes later they finally bring some plates.  Then we had issues getting silverware and napkins and eventually got 3 settings for the 4 of us to share, no joke! It's always the same experience.   I wish they would get it together there because BJ's has a great atmosphere, the food is decent, and the vanilla cream soda is wicked good!  So if you work at BJ's and happen to read this, please, please do something to improve the service!"
Michael M.,"Salida, CA",15,10,,3.0,12/16/2014,"Always a good experience and a good environment. The staff could be more attentive but realize it is a lot of younger staff and also gets very busy. Portions on some menu items can be small, but quality is always good. Update- I had to order a drink outside of happy hour because the server wasn't at the table for 15 minutes and I was done with my drink. The staff needs to be trained. Lowering the rating."
Dawn D.,"Woodbridge, CA",0,34,4,5.0,1/24/2016,The menu is extensive and I've never had anything bad here.  Could come here 4 nights a week easily.  It's a family place but has a large bar and if you're looking to try new beer this is a good place to start.
Laura H.,"Modesto, CA",0,2,,1.0,6/5/2016,BAD SERVICE!!! We sat for about 15 minutes and nobody offered us drinks and the customers after us were being served. We were totally ignored
Stephanie P.,"Newman, CA",10,17,66,5.0,1/8/2015,"What is with all the hate?! I've been to this location about 30 times so I feel I can actually give a great and accurate review.  Food is always great and the decor is awesome. Looks very modern and I love all the tv's and chandeliers. Been here with the hubby a lot and he loves it as well. Been here with some girlfriends for lunch and dinner plus birthdays so this is an all around versatile restaurant for any occasion. Food wise, thin cut fries are the best! Sounds ridiculous to rave about something as simple as fries but they're awesome. White cheddar mashed potatoes are tasty as well. Hand breaded parm is delicious and well as their broccolli and chicken pasta. What I love is that no matter what you get whether it be a sandwich or a steak, the presentation is beautiful. My FAVORITE thing to eat here is the Pazooki! The red velvet is the best but they don't have it anymore so instead I get the white macadamia pazookie which is delicious!! Chicken tortilla soup is amazing. Pizza flatbread is good but enough to share between 2. If you're a group of 4 or more you'll get one thin small piece a person. Burgers are great they look amazing like the picture. Pizza is very popular there as well.  Service isn't bad. Its like anywhere else, it just depends. Most of the time I get great service with the exception of 1 time but management did a great job of redeeming themselves. Thats the great thing about bjs. They really care about your experience. If I got anything late, I got it free or discounted. I even had a $60 plus check comped before. Im not much of a drinker but they have an extensive beer selection if thats your thing.."
Andrew G.,"Fremont, CA",33,5,1,1.0,10/18/2015,"Came here to watch football on Sunday. I ordered a bloody marry. I don't know what they served me, but it tasted sweet; it was almost like they mixed up bloody marry mix with the strawberry daiquiri. The football games on the big screens were getting block. Black screens on Sunday during fourth quarter for multiple games. Pretty poor form for a location that uses sports as their draw."
Matthew W.,"Lodi, CA",0,12,1,5.0,7/31/2016,"Well - must give credit where credit is due. Returned to BJs at the invite of general manager Chris Miller, following a poor experience couple months prior. Bravo BJs, bravo!! The service was quite simply the best customer service I think I have ever had...anywhere! Food was served quick and well prepared. Our server Mick (?) went above and beyond as did Mr. Miller. I appreciate the opportunity to give them another chance - came thru with flying colors - will definitely be back! Well done BJs!!!"
Sports G.,"Modesto, CA",0,29,8,2.0,2/12/2017,"Upon arrival, my friend and I were told it would be a 30-45 minute wait.  I gave my name and phone number so we could receive our ""text or call"".  Why bother doing that when they were calling out names the entire night?  After the 45 minutes came and went, my friend asked about additional wait time and she was told ""20-35 more minutes"".  We were seated 1 hour after arriving and when I asked what a particular alcoholic drink tasted like, was only told ""heaven"".  I wasn't offered a taste like I have been in the past, so I had to ask for one.  My friend did as well.  It took a good 10 minutes for those to come out.  The tastes came out in cups the exact size as the salt/pepper shakers and barely enough poured in for a small gulp!  I've had tastes before and was given much larger samples!  My friend and I decided to order the drink and those showed up maybe a minute later.  The rest of the food came out alright, and we paid our check and left."
Catrina G.,"Opa-locka, FL",0,5,3,4.0,3/19/2015,"This is one of my favorite restaurant. Their nachos dip i like, fried chicken and Michelle is my favorite waitress she's always nice and friendly. I go their twice a month reasonable prices two thumbs up!"
Abraham G.,"Merced, CA",0,1,,5.0,10/4/2015,Inglish is an amazing waiter. She really hooked us up! :)  I hope I spelled her name right. Definitely request her as a waiter if you can!
Steven G.,"Modesto, CA",84,945,143,5.0,7/19/2012,"Had an amazing experience this time around! After being completely DENIED at Unos, we jetted across town to BJ's thinking this environment was better for my friend and I. We walk in, take a seat at the bar and this is where the magic began! We were first greeted by a cute but mousey girl who quickly gave us attention almost as if we were the only ones there. She took our drink orders then gave us menus so we could decide on any of their stellar offerings. Having to tend to the others she walked over to the other side of the bar and we were left with her counterpart who was equally cute and feisty as all get up! You should've seen it, the banter between my friend and miss fierce was CLASSIC! She was such a tease and made our little visit sooo much fun. Of course our original bartender joined in on the fun and it was a riot! Out of this visit we felt welcomed, they fed us well (jambalaya) and the drinks were mixed perfectly. I'd say this visit was a definite win!"
Fillionaire H.,"Tracy, CA",185,3,,5.0,1/28/2016,Sometimes it's not the easiest job in the world to deal with my mother. But if you are able to have her smiling by the end of the date you get an A+ for your patience. Miguel was by far the best waiter I have had at any restaurant in a very long time. I did not care for my food too much and was asked what else would I like and also given a salad on the house for the wait. Love love love this place definitely coming back!
Stephen D.,"Modesto, CA",0,2,,1.0,8/22/2015,"Don't ever order any fish here, drier than dry!  You'll need something to wash it down if you decide to go the fish route..."
Dena M.,"Manteca, CA",0,6,,4.0,7/26/2016,"Food was great, my server Lisa was awesome!  I only gave it a 4 star because of the fairly large birthday party we were sitting next too. They were loud and rude! Our poor server took the brunt of their poor manners. Some people should not be let out of the house!"
Kelly M.,"Modesto, CA",26,66,14,4.0,5/4/2015,"The food and service is good every time I come here idk why people are hating on BJs. Their beer selection is awesome, not as good as dust bowls though. The pizookies are amazeballs! The best bday dessert any chain restaurant gives out. They have a light menu with lower calorie options which I like. The male manager is friendly I forget his name."
Peter G.,"Modesto, CA",1,258,41,5.0,10/17/2015,"Angelina was initial was not our server but was the server for the next table. She took it upon herself to come to our table and said ""I notice you were waiting for your server. I can take your order and give to your server."" Wow that never happens! First time a server had the heads up! Great job Angelina! Ultimately she was out server. Very impressed! O yeah the food was good too."
Patrick G.,"Torrance, Los Angeles, CA",20,3,,5.0,7/28/2015,"Good appetizers & great drinks, especially the beer; I recommend getting the sampler to try them out. If you're really hungry, the food is good and the servings are large, so prepare to take some home."
