Danny H.,"Atlanta, GA",9,408,38,3.0,5/23/2012,"The 14-year old in me was cruising down Rte. 99 on my way to Modesto to see a minor league baseball team called ""The Nuts,"" when the hunger struck.  I'd say I whipped out the trust ol' smartphone, but I'm a responsible driver, so I made my friend do it instead.  As a rule of thumb when traveling, try nothing you can get at home - and when the name ""BJ's"" came up, the 14-year old said to say no more, that's where we're going. It didn't occur to me that Beej's was a regional chain until after the visit, but the point remains is that it was new to me, and that was all that really mattered.  The Modesto location is conveniently located immediately off of Route 99, as part of a shopping mall.  That being said, parking is often predicated on the time of day, and/or the demand of something at the mall.  Considering the parking lot was completely packed when I got there, I wonder what alternatives there are to do in Modesto.  Needless to say, there's plenty of parking spaces, but being shared with a mall, it may or may not be an easy plight in finding a spot to actually park. Regardless, I must have gotten there at a perfect time; it was a Saturday afternoon at around 5:00 pm, so I'm guessing I was literally just arriving moments before the dinner rush was to begin.  So, in spite of what other reviewers mentioned about long wait times, I was seated promptly by a pretty hostess who seemed oddly interested in the weather in Atlanta upon chatting with me for a moment. Service was prompt and attentive, and more than willing to give suggestions and field my questions about their house brews.  I'm no expert on beer by any means, but I like to drink what refreshes my pallet so to speak, and because I have a fascination with buffalos, I ended up going with their Tatonka stout.  It was a bit sweeter than say a Guinness, but it wasn't as thick.  That being said, it went down smooth, and could be a brew that I could easily thrown back several before knowing what hit me. As for the food, I ordered the fish tacos.  Actually, they were kind enough to do a one-and-one for me, and give me one of the chargrilled mahi-mahi and one chargrilled shrimp.  The shrimp taco was a little on the bland side, but the mahi-mahi taco was excellent.  A good amount of flavor and sauce, without totally drowning out the taste of the meat itself.  I made the mistake of eating the mahi-mahi first.  It was served with chips and dip on the side. The price of my entire experience was nothing really out of the ordinary.  They're not expensive to where it's worth complaining, and they're not so cheap to warrant talking about.  If I ever head back up to the NorCal or Modesto areas, I'd gladly give Beej's more business, as I'd like to go and sample all their house brews, as well as their in-house root beer and cream soda.  Easily worth making a repeat trip or two."
Robin S.,"Modesto, CA",0,19,,4.0,1/12/2016,"Ok so we go in on Sunday around 8 the kid at the host booth tells is about 15 minutes. Isee an open table in the bar so we take that instead.  No one approahes us. So I pull out my watch out of couriosity I hit the timer.on a time keeping basis here is how it broke down.  9 minutes for a person to take our drink order.  12 minutes with an apology in the middle cause the bartender"" is behind"" to actually get drinks. Ordered food when drinks arrived.  22 minutes to get the  to the table. Ordered dessert after. Yep 10 minutes to get that. FOOD  The deep dish pizza is awesome!  Drinks Stiff! Bartender knows what she is doing.  Staff  A little cold just going through the motions. But get I came for the pizza"
Maelien S.,"Stockton, CA",0,24,23,1.0,7/19/2015,POOREST SERVICE YET. I'm so disappointed. I go to the location in Stockton all the time and this was just a sad visit. I was basically unattended to. I waited so long to take my order that I had to ASK someone to take and when I got my food I wasn't even hungry anymore. Halfway through my meal I was thirsty and reached for an empty cup a couple times which seemed to sit here until I had ASKED for another by the end of my meal.
Mmmber M.,"Modesto, CA",40,47,,4.0,7/7/2014,"Me and a few friends went in there for lunch, and were seated right away.  Their brewed rootbeer is delicious, our waitress was overly sweet and the food was really great. I already have plans to come back. :) I also really liked how the calories were listed for each Item, and the menu is very large and full of great stuff.  The drink menu was very extensive, a whole page for wine, I ordered a BJs rootbeer alcoholic drink, cant remember the name, but it tasted just like an alcoholic root beer float, it was VERY good, plus I got a buzz off just one, which was surprising."
Judy C.,"Del Rio, CA",44,12,,5.0,6/7/2015,"We come here every time we come to the mall! My teenage daughters love it here we generally have good service and the food always good. This review could have turned out awful if not for Maria. The hostess sat us and we waited for what seemed like 15 minutes... In the defense of the wait staff the place  was a zoo due to the warriors game... When out of no where pops Maria and kindly asks if we belong to anyone... I said nope , her response well than you'll belong to me  despite the  hectic environment  she made us feel important ! Keep up the great work maria! Side note 10 minutes after our appetizer and drinks arrived our  ""real"" server finally appeared"
Thomas H.,"Empire, CA",138,681,241,2.0,4/17/2014,"I really had hoped that the food would be better than I remembered but I was very disappointed the last two times I was here: first time, the lettuce of the salad was badly browning and the second, the pizza was bland, and played dead on arrival. I was not to be disappointed.  Well, I wasn't -- as I was.  To say the least about BJ's: they are consistent. We could hardly hear ourselves think as we sat in the cacophony of bar noise, news shows, and a few competing basketball and baseball games -- especially that from the loudspeakers of the establishment across the courtyard. The pizza looked okay, but like a photograph of a real pizza, it lacked real flavor, especially the tomato sauce.  Nothing remarkable about it other than its price.   The pizza was colder than the beer. My culinary companion du jour's salad looked like the oldest lettuce in Modesto.  After she picked out the few good bits from her salad, then she noshed on my cold pizza.   Cold pizza is the best, right? she asked... Fickle girl. Our server bounced up to our table and gaily asked if she could get us anything else?  I indicated that the meal was ghastly, and that we wanted to pay our check and get out.  As if I indicated that I really wanted to wanted to be further disappointed, she happily launched into her script asking if we wanted to try their fabulous desserts?  I shook my head (emphatically) no.  She knew all the lines of her script about the wonderful treats they had... while my date looked at the floor, chewing her lower lip to stop herself from saying something we'd both regret. I guess you need to be hungry and drunk enough for the food to rate 3 stars.  BJ's food is a monument to epicurean indifference."
Jennifer R.,"Santa Barbara, CA",151,107,1169,3.0,4/17/2013,"First off, the pazookie is bomb! They have a few different kinds but the vanilla ice cream with the warm chocolate chip cookie is a little taste of heaven. I ordered the Sweet Pig thin crust pizza. It came out looking like a cheese pizza with sparse toppings of pineapple and ham =( It wasn't bad but not something I would order again."
Ireeta M.,"Riverbank, CA",6,1,,1.0,5/10/2015,"We were there before they opened, were first in line. We had to wait an hour before we were seated, another 45 minutes before they took our orders. Another 20 minutes before they started bringing orders, which were partially wrong. The food was good but the service was horrible. Not our waitresses fault. She was great. Tables of 8 and 10 seated after our table of 13. They were served, finished and out the doors before our orders were even taken. Horrible customer service."
Angel O.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,22,1,2.0,5/5/2015,"Mediocre at best. Always busy & loud, service isn't great & food is greasy. Perhaps LOTS of beer would make it better."
Ivette A.,"Turlock, CA",18,148,131,5.0,5/18/2015,Great pizza! Great drinks. Fancy bar/restaurant. Come here often
Mimi P.,"Modesto, CA",2,15,3,5.0,4/3/2014,"Quick service, great drink selection, noise level isn't high because of great room between tables, kind staff, and delicious food.  Great date night restaurant! Nicer-casual attire is preferred but not required. My boyfriend and I showed up in jeans and sweatshirts because we were starving and drove by. So glad we were able to try the food here!"
Greta R.,"San Rafael, CA",60,522,57,3.0,5/24/2014,"The food was good and I love the beer at BJ's.  It was a weeknight but service was still pretty slow.  That was my only issue.  I had to flag down a server in the bar area.  However, once I was able to order things went pretty smoothly.  I did want a second beer, but since it took a while to get the first one I decided to pass."
Arvin L.,"Modesto, CA",55,5,34,4.0,2/5/2014,"Avocado egg rolls, clam chower, and heffenweisen = great combo  Even when busy the service is usually on point. My request to change tv programs, usually for sf giants games, are always granted. Speakin of busy, it always is! Nice atmosphere inside and next door to apple, coach and buffalo wild wings makes it very convenient to eat then shop or vice versa! Parking is extremely hard to get, but worth it for the great food plus you lose a few calories walking to your car!"
Summer S.,"Roseville, CA",0,13,5,1.0,2/16/2016,"Thanks for ruining our Valentine's Day dinner! After waiting for 20 minutes to be seated we sat and odered our food and got flat pepsi while we waited for our appetizer. Cold, overcooked calamari and fried artichokes that were pure squish! I asked the waitress if they were canned or something because who would fry canned artichokes right?!?! She giggles and said ""wow, how'd you know""! Our salads came next with no dressing (I ordered ranch with extra on the side) my salad was not green, it was a completely yellow wedge... Then I asked for dressing and we watched the waiter who delivered our food walk away, go bus a few tables, go drink some water and flirt with a girl in the computer area. So my man got up to ask him again if he was going to get my ranch since I couldn't the eat salad sitting in front of me. He said ""yeah, I'll get to it""... We had to ask two other people before I finally got it. About an hour after we order and still no entree, a manager comes and apologizes for the Long wait, our waitress hasn't said a word. I didn't want to complain about what had been going on and further ruin our night out at this point. The food comes next and we don't have extra plates or silverware (we were sharing each others food) so we say until it was cold about ten minutes later before someone brought silverware...Terrible service, terrible food"
LaVonne G.,"Manteca, CA",92,40,17,1.0,5/13/2014,"I had high hopes for this restaurant since I only heard good things before. We decided to eat here for mother's day since it had something that would cater to everyone's difficult tastes. We were a party of seven (4 adults, 2 kids and an infant) and we got there and they said 30-40 min wait. We decided to stay since we figured it would be a 30min wait anywhere else. WELL we waited an hour after watching them call people with tables to 4-6 endlessly. I finally said something once we had hit the 40 min wait because my girls were getting antsy. We were waiting for 2 tables to get up...  Out of ALL those tables in there, only two could be used for us? I would have left had we not waited so long. Waited another 20mins while I sat watching this couple slowly finish their drinks.  Besides the wait I can say I was not pleased with my martini. I ordered the Pink Cadillac and it just tasted sweet without a trace of alcohol. My boyfriend ordered a beer and it was warm. Food took another 45mins to come. The only person who enjoyed their meal was my boyfriend who had a jalapeño burger. Never again will I eat here."
K B.,"Modesto, CA",0,53,,4.0,11/14/2015,"BJs is always consistent and the atmosphere is great.  The avacado egg rolls are amazing.  Beer is also good. It is a little expensive, but its good for big groups. The only downside is it is always busy so you better get there early, before the rush or you probably wont get a table for at least 30 minutes"
Alyssa H.,"Modesto, CA",3,6,,1.0,4/15/2015,First of all the staff was goofing around the whole time. I should of left before I ordered. I ordered southern fried chicken that stated it came with 2 chicken breasts and the whole works. I ended up getting 2 pieces of flattened chicken breast that I am sure was 1 chicken breast cut in half. It was ok but it came with canned corn and an over spiced small portion of mashed potatoes and a drizzle of gravy:/ the fritos nachos looked like something I order from taco bell but tasted worse. Basically fritos over a bed of canned chili with canned jalapeños sour cream and nacho cheese. Their pizza was worse than pizza Hut at 20 bucks a pop! At least the manager was nice apologized and didn't charge us. I didn't even go for free dessert or take home any leftovers! I'm never going here again! Yuck
Julie T.,"Modesto, CA",19,33,19,1.0,5/16/2015,"Went to have lunch with my 5 year old daughter today, just the 2 of us. It was moderately busy...not too bad there were at least 10 or more open tables that I could see. They told us it would be a 15-20 min wait. That was fine, we waited. Once we were seated by the hostess we sat waiting for another 20 mins and we were never even greeted by a server or asked our drink order. Once I watched 5 different parties who came in after me be greeted and receive their drinks I told my daughter we had to leave and we just got up and walked out. I can't believe how horrible their service is! We just went to Chipotle instead and my daughter was happy with that! Don't waste your time at this BJs."
Thomas K.,"Nampa, ID",0,61,,2.0,6/24/2016,"I don't know why I even bother with these uber chains.  Anyplace that has over 100 items on the menu can't be good.  We started off with watered down overpriced drinks while enjoying the spinach dip right from the heat and serve bag.  Followed by a salad that not even a border jumper on a fake ssn card could mess up.  I finished with chicken pasta with sauce made from a mix of powder and water. Ever hear of heavy cream and real cheese people.  Service was scripted like every other chain, so dont expect any personality from your server because its obvious it must be against corporate rules. Obviously from watching other tables complain it occurred to me this is a chain that goes for massive sales, comping complainers and at the end somehow ink out a profit.  I recommend staying away from this place and going to an independent for your family night out.  It can't be worse and likely much cheaper. Oh and don't lie and say it's your birthday just for a free pizzokie. Have some class and just complain about the entree, they will comp it guaranteed."
Hans S.,"Chowchilla, CA",9,4,,2.0,5/2/2015,"Second time at this location. Second time ordered the burger and fries. Second time I was disappointed. First time me and my girlfriend came the fries tasted old asked for fresh ones came out just as nasty as the first time. Second time here the burger was dry dry dry. And that's after I added mayo and ketchup to the bun. I noticed when I lifted the top it looked liked the cooks cut the burger to see if it's done, bad bad bad. Once you cut the meat it releases the juices. And I wouldn't doubt that probably press the burgers as well. I gave them 2 stars because both times the waitress was good other wise I would've given only 1 star. Needless to say I won't be going back to this location."
