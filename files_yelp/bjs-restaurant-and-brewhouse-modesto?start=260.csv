Jennifer S.,"Manteca, CA",4,22,,5.0,4/4/2015,"We LOVE this place!!! My favorite to get is the Parmesan Crusted Chicken. The lettuce wraps and the corn fritters ( I think thats what they were called ) are always yummy. Yes, this place gets busy, but we seem to plan on going in when we know it's not going to be a complete zoo! We have gone here for Easter brunch the past two years and its wonderful because it's not crowded like most places and they make the BEST bloody mary's :)"
Jeremy B.,"Tracy, CA",0,4,3,3.0,9/14/2014,Bj's is one of my favorite.their food is good but be very careful ordering any change in recipe cuz it happened to me couple of times and I have to leave my food unfinished  I think they need better communication between waiters and cooks.
Mika K.,"Tracy, CA",20,3,,1.0,5/3/2015,"Three strikes and you're out!! The food is okay, but really nothing to write home about except the pizookies. They accommodated our large group with no problem but the service is mediocre at best. Our food orders were not correct and most people were done before one of our party even received their food. While awaiting our dessert our glasses were empty and we had to request for refills. Been here over 2 hours with the restaurant barely full! VERY DISAPPOINTING!!!"
Sonita N.,"San Jose, CA",10,16,4,5.0,3/17/2015,Wow! Endless selection of beers! And I can't get over their deep dish pizzas! Love at first try. I really enjoyed our super sweet server Meg. Overall great place to grab lunch or dinner. Plenty of TV's around the restaurant also.
Maira V.,"Fresno, CA",28,12,2,5.0,8/4/2015,"I had the Alaskan salmon.  I how I love it!  Very delicious with the extra sauce they give and lemons.  I tried the peranna beer and it was too strong for me but was ok.  The kids ate the kids hamburger and it comes with two so my 5yr old and 3 yr old share the plate.  1 hamburger each and they share the fries. So much food!  Also,  we always have to get the white macadamia poozookie so delicious!"

Jake R.,"Merced, CA",20,10,5,1.0,5/4/2015,I was enjoying a good meal of their classic burger and potato wedges with a ice tea while watching the basketball playoffs. Until they change the 4 split tv that's on top of the bar and put on the Giants game instead. I ask politely to put back at the basketball game and mention that all the other TVs in the vicinity also was on the baseball game. With no luck I decided to leave without finishing my meal.
Nikki J.,"Tracy, CA",39,41,5,4.0,12/10/2014,"Went for dinner last night. Miguel served me my friend and her daughter. Service was good, baby girls food was late so he made up for it with a mini Pazookie which was perfect to make us happy."
Haley B.,"Modesto, CA",252,3,1,1.0,11/1/2015,"My food was brought to me RAW and I didn't notice until I ate half. The chicken was completely Raw and not one person said ""sorry"" they took my plate and said ""we are slammed."" Because you are busy does not mean you give your customers raw chicken. Now to just hope I don't get sick.  Horrible service"
Carie C.,"Modesto, CA",1116,7,1,2.0,3/29/2015,The server touched our table one time in an hour. It's only two stars for me and that's because I enjoyed one cocktail.
Armando G.,"Ceres, CA",0,5,,3.0,8/3/2015,"Food was great, service was eh, got my salad with my food, why? Got my beer that was recommended to go with my food not minutes after sitting. When we left I had forgotten the babies bottle, I returned from the rotating door to find the table cleared and the bottles was thrown away, I didn't  even leave the building yet. Bottles are expensive but I guess they don't care cuz I had already spent 70 dollars  on the bill."
Glen G.,"Oakdale, CA",58,15,6,1.0,1/17/2015,"This may be an exception and the the usual, but tonight the service was extremely slow. It took what seemed like forever just to have our order taken. Then, it took so long to get our food that I had to ask the host. The good arrived and burgers and fries were cold. Pita bread burnt. Very disappointed. I will not return to this restaurant."
Jerad H.,"Modesto, CA",948,111,63,4.0,1/28/2015,Always a decent experience. Sometimes the servers seem rushed but the food is always good. Never have I had a bad experience at any BJs location.
Melissa C.,"Lathrop, CA",24,35,15,4.0,12/16/2014,This is a fun energetic place to eat. I love the spaghetti! The pot stickers are amazingly great!  The beer is to die for! I got a beer and they mixed it with a cider and omg I was in ah. It was sweet and delicious with my food.
James P.,"Stockton, CA",77,1,28,5.0,11/26/2013,"I went there to replace my iPhone5s at the apple store, trying to cope a deal by the mall, but I ended up paying $300 for the insurance.  As I was leaving I had to use the restroom before I left so I decided to walk into BJs restaurant.  After I used the restroom I realize it was lunch time so I sat down for a steak and lobster.  The food was great, the waitress asked if I wanted my steak grilled or blackened and I said blackened.  This was the first time I've ever heard the question about a steak in a restaurant and I've had a lot of steak.  The beer was good too.  I wanted a Bear Republic IPA but the waitress said the restaurant makes house IPA and it's cheaper during happy hour so I tried both beers just to see what was good.  I went with the house IPA but you might enjoy the Bear Republic IPA better.  Great for lunch on a Tuesday afternoon!"
Kristen H.,"Manteca, CA",50,21,32,2.0,3/3/2015,Came here for lunch and we had to send a meal back because everything was cold. Got it back and it was still cold. Good customer service but the food is nothing special.
Ron S.,"Merced, CA",0,14,4,1.0,11/5/2014,"I should have read the reviews on this place, so I'd know to avoid this place. The few times I've been here, the sitting has been horrible. We call ahead each time, but when we get here, we get the same waiting time as walk up people. The hostess was irritable and rude when I asked about their obvious BS. The little short African American girl was extremely rude when I asked why people of the same group size that checked in after us, and had not called in, were seated before us. She said she was, ""Trying her best,"" and turned around. When I tried to talk further with her, she ignored me. I can't believe BJs would let her be the first face you see when you come to this restaurant. She was sour!Another girl brought over a manager. He apologized and we were finally sat 72 minutes after we had called ahead, 45 minutes after we had checked in. The server was great and took good care of us. I had the bacon burger. It was good. My wife's chicken sandwich had a hair in it. The manager was nice and recognized our bad experience. A hair in food is a mistake that happens. The poor service with seating is a common fault of this restaurant and for that I'll never be back to this one."
BaNaNa B.,"Modesto, CA",1,153,,1.0,9/6/2013,"I'll keep this short and sweet.  Mediocre food, rude servers, crappy service in general.  Even management wasn't quick to rectify problems when my food order was completely botched.  About the only reason I can see going here is to get drunk and gawk at the eye candy that walks in. Oops...  I don't drink so I guess I'll just never come back.  You've been warned."
Aly I.,"Modesto, CA",31,135,31,5.0,4/3/2015,"We came to BJs for a surprise babyshower for a co-worker. The staff was extremely accommodating and treated us so well. Even the manager came over to congratulate the mommy-to-be. The food was great, the drinks were very good as well. The server we had was so sweet and he was constantly making sure we had everything we needed. Based on this experience and the two other times I've been there for normal dining, I really love it. The menu is pricey but the food always speaks for itself. Love this place."
Donni N.,"Ceres, CA",0,8,5,4.0,7/19/2014,"I came here with my boyfriend on a dinner date and this place was a very chill place. I liked how things were pretty fast even though the place was packed! The food took about 20 minutes to come out. It sounded reasonable because my boyfriend got a burger with a side of fries, and I got the Shrimp Scampi Pasta. My boyfriend said that was the best burger he ever ate! I'm sorry I forgot what kind of burger he got but he knew there were grilled onions in them. And i'm sure the pasta could have a little bit better but it was still good! But I do recommend this place for dinner. It's very friendly. And my waiter was very nice as well, she checked up on us a few times not like some waiters who would just ask us every 5 minutes. But this place is a go go."
