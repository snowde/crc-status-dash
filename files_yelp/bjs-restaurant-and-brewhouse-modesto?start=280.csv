Diana I.,"Modesto, CA",1,28,,1.0,2/4/2015,"Food was Ok very mediocre was not impressed. I was not too thrilled about the service at all. Waitresses horrible and not friendly, barley checked up on me never going back again it was a big turn off."
Leslie A.,"Lodi, CA",0,24,10,1.0,12/21/2014,"Went in with my 2 daughters for a break from shopping. They seated us and gave my kids 'adult' menus. I asked for kids menus since they are both pretty young. The server took the adult menus and said she would be back. Another server came again with adult menus. I told her I requested kids menus for the kids. She said oops, she would bring them with our drinks and took our drink order. One daughter order hot chocolate, the other lemonade.  Took a while but finally got menus and ordered. Got 2 appetizers, 2 kids meals, lunch and coffee for me.  When the bill came, they changed for the drinks my kids ordered. I questioned the waitress. She said they were brought out in full size cups so they are full price. Clearly on the kids menus drinks are included. She refused to take the drinks off the tab. I told her consider that $6.00 in drinks her tip. I always tip well but this was ridiculous."
V S.,"Phoenix, AZ",2,15,,3.0,2/26/2015,"Ok, I don't recommend this specific location. We went for my birthday and the server got my order wrong...we actually had three or four different servers assigned to our table throughout the night. The fries were stale. I wanted a hot drink as dessert so I ordered hot chocolate and it literally never came. I'm sure I could've had a better experience."
cm g.,"Modesto, CA",51,67,74,2.0,6/27/2013,"Noisy, upscale sport bar restaurant Busy glossy magazine cover restaurant.  One more restaurant that rolls out the ""wait for 30-40 minutes take a plastic led calling card and we'll buzz you"" experience only to be welcomed by mediocre food that isn't imaginative or memorable.  Modesto seems to love this package, as does other suburbia towns.  We have a fine collection of small independent restaurants that are amazing, why does our community support the corporate chains as if they are an amazing goldmine, waiting for hours to get a table, and for what? There is nothing really special, but I guess that mediocre is ok here."
Crysalyn M.,"Ceres, CA",7,7,,2.0,11/11/2014,"I used to really like coming here with my friends because I loved the atmosphere and the food was good. I brought my boyfriend over the other day and the service has taken a MAJOR plunge. We were seated promptly but a small rush followed and our waitress was clearly overwhelmed. We got our orders in and she brought my boyfriend's soda promptly but I was left waiting for another five minutes. Then several times as we were waiting for our food she passed by saying ""your food is almost done"" just to be left waiting some more. I'm kind of a nice reviewer but I couldn't do it for BJs because of our drinks. We didn't get ONE refill all dinner. I hope they get their staff together because I would like to be able to enjoy this place again."
Crystal P.,"Modesto, CA",1,17,6,4.0,8/31/2011,"My husband and I have eaten here a couple times, and have done their take out (to-go) many times. When we ate at the restaurant, the first time it seemed very nice, had a good atmosphere, but it quickly went downhill. They first brought us the wrong drinks, then the wrong appetizer, when we told the girl it wasn't the right one she was like oh yeah this is there's and grabbed it off our table and took it right over to the table behind us.....oook. She did end up bringing us our correct appetizer, fresh from the kitchen at least, and not from someone elses table! Our take out orders have ALWAYS been wrong, they have forgot to add meals that were paid for, gave us the wrong meals, and even forgot to add the chicken to the Cajun chicken pasta, how can you forget the chicken! With all that being said, we still eat there because the food is good, but there are always mistakes with our orders. With that being said they always fix the problems with correcting orders and making the meal on them.  Always check you have the correct meals before you drive off with your to-go order though!"
Mehndi M.,"Modesto, CA",48,255,271,2.0,9/13/2014,"REVIEW BASED OFF CATERING EXPERIENCE! Last weekend, I had my birthday party food catered from BJ's. It was pretty simple to do. I just went into the restaurant a few hours before my party and went to the take-out area to order it. I chose to order the Family & Friends Party Pack, $99.95. I added on the appetizer package as well for $33.95. The Family & Friends Pack serves about 10 people. It includes: 2 large Pizzas, 10 pieces of Balsamic Glazed Chicken Breast, 2 large Specialty or Enlightened Salads, 20 Chicken Wings, and 4 Party Sides. The Appetizer Package included two appetizers of your choice. I picked the Avocado Egg Rolls and the Spinach and Artichoke Dip. I was VERY disappointed by all my catering.  When my boyfriend went to pick up all the food, they charged him for everything but they didn't put the Appetizer Package in any of the bags. He had to wait another 30 mins for them to make that which made him late bringing the food for the party while our guests had already arrived. That was MISTAKE #1. I had a few religiously, vegetarian guests therefore I ordered a vegetarian pizza and a vegetarian salad. When we served the food, someone noticed that there were small chunks of chicken in the VEGETARIAN salad!! How bad would that have been if my aunt who has been vegetarian for about 50 years ate meat for the first time because of a screw-up from BJ's?! MISTAKE #2. For the 4 Party Sides, we ordered two mashed potatoes, one of the baked potato option, and one rice pilaf. When we opened the Party Size Sides, we were in shock. The so called ""party sides"" that are supposed to be enough for 6-10 people were so ridiculously small! The two sides of mashed potatoes were like the smallest size of mashed potatoes you get from KFC (like the size of an ice cream scoop). How on earth does that feed 6-10 people?! The rice pilaf was of the same size. MISTAKE #3. Then we opened the box with the baked potatoes that were supposed to feed 6-10 people....it was ONE baked potato. How does ONE potato feed 6-10 people?! MISTAKE #4. When we opened the Mix & Match Appetizer and I quote from their website ""serves approx. 6-8 people"" ....the Spinach & Artichoke dip was SMALLER than a kid's size ice cream scoop from Baskin Robbins!! Explain to me BJ's how that can feed 6-8 people. The Avocado Egg Rolls were 3 egg rolls cut in half, making 6 pieces. MISTAKE #5.  For the amount of money we paid for all this food, it was not worth it at all. Glad I know now though! I called to let them know about all these problems especially about the vegetarian mistake and the manager sent me a $15 gift card for the $140 we spent on their food. My family & I will not  be ordering Party Packs from BJ's ever again & our guests won't be either as they saw how ridiculous all the portions were."
Kyle B.,"Manteca, CA",30,15,2,1.0,12/11/2014,"I eat out quite frequently, minimally biweekly, and I can honestly say, tonight I received some of the WORST service in my entire life. I cannot believe the attitude of my waitress and how long just getting drinks took my party and I. It took over a half hour just to get the check and my change. She had the audacity to take her rudeness to another level through being sarcastic as we were talking amongst ourselves about how long it was taking. I couldn't be any less pleased, as this was the third and final time I will have horrible service from BJ's. It must stand for 'big Joke' in terms of service. I was so irate I couldn't even speak to the manager of the service for fear of losing my temper. Don't waste your time here, McDonald's is far superior in regards of customer service (And I truly dislike McDonald's)."
Jay S.,"Modesto, CA",0,53,1,2.0,8/23/2013,"Ive been to this BJ's plenty of times throughout the years and have been to many others as well.... Few things always seems to be consistent:  Below average service, good food and above average atmosphere. The other day we went there for lunch and ordered a few beers.   When the tab came , I was shocked that we just paid $6.50 for a PINT of Stella....  $6.50??? That just seems waaaay out whack. to me.  With UNO's coming across the street, offering the similar product, much better service and much cheaper... Good Luck!"
Brook G.,"Beaverton, OR",0,80,1,2.0,1/17/2015,"Let me first start out by saying that today's disaster could have been avoided if BJ's had ANY decent low-carb options on their menu. Even their salads have things like beans and corn and breaded chicken. Anything you order must be altered in order to get it to be a low carb meal. However, I have never been to this BJ's and been able to order a single thing (even non-low-carb) with a specialty (even just swapping the type of dressing on a salad or a side of anchovies with a pizza) without having an issue.  Apparently this BJ's specifically has a problem with specialty orders. Today, for example, I ordered the Toasted Turkey Bacon Sandwich. I ordered it on lettuce instead of bread, provolone instead of swiss, and no tomato. It came with a salad, so I ordered the salad with no tomato and no croutons.  The sandwich (now a lettuce wrap) came to me looking like they had thrown it together with spite because I had asked for it to be a special order. Then, I found that it had no mayo (it is supposed to come with it) and no cheese, on top of it looking disheveled. It also came with a side of ranch, which I couldn't figure out because I had not ordered that and the salads always come pre-dressed. My husband and I have been to many BJ's locations and have always been pleased with our service and our food, however we have been to this Modesto location several times and every single time they have messed up a specialty order, even if it is just ""add grilled chicken to my pasta"" or something simple like that.  I also had to ask for my salad twice after my main dish came, and each time I specified no croutons, no tomato. When I finally got it, it had tomato, which I picked off and ate without complaint because it was such a big deal that they finally got at least half of something right. Our server was nice about everything, although she could have avoided the comment about how ""I could have just ordered a salad as a meal"" because she clearly has not ever looked at the nutritional info of their menu.  I can't figure out if the wait staff just forgets because they never write anything down, the kitchen staff is angry and spiteful because of a picky order (sorry, there are people who have special dietary needs which BJ's fails to cater to!), or if the kitchen staff is on autopilot and never gets a special order correct because they don't know how to break pattern.  I won't be coming back to this location. I know from experience that a customer's picky order can be frustrating, but it is also frustrating for a customer to have to sit down at their favorite restaurant and not be able to order their favorite meal because of new health restrictions. I also hope that BJ's some day comes out with a couple of low carb options on their menu. It would be much easier than trying to customize an order and dealing with frustrated staff."
Joe H.,"Turlock, CA",75,13,,5.0,6/27/2015,"Me and my daughter went here for a early Father's Day Lunch on 6/16/15. We asked to be seated at the bar as I wanted a good view of the games. I then met the best bartender EVER! Linsey at the bar made great conversation, was very polite, well spoken and was so on top of taking care of us. I was impressed with how well she was handling us, I started to watch her handling the other customers rather than watching the games. All I can say is this girl knows her stuff and does her job very well! So Well that I left her the biggest Tip (30% of our meal cost) that I've ever left anyone. Thank you Linsey for the awesome experience!"
Luke S.,"San Mateo, CA",477,1211,,3.0,7/17/2013,The bathroom here sucked. No toilet paper and no paper towels . The menu is very tricky with prices too.  Make sure to read the small fineprint.
Cheryl B.,"Modesto, CA",0,1,,2.0,11/1/2015,"Just left BJ's and was never so glad to leave a restaurant in my life! My husband and I had soup and salad, which was good, although we had to pay extra for the garlic knot rolls. The restaurant was extremely crowded and as a result, extremely noisy. As if it wasn't noisy enough they had hard rock music cranked up as if it were a nightclub! We could barely hear one another talk! On our way out, we asked one of the hostesses about the music. She couldn't even hear it! Poor thing...she must have gone deaf from working there! My suggestion to BJ'S....turn the music down when you have a crowded restaurant! It would make dining far more pleasurable."
Blanca M.,"Atwater, CA",0,28,47,5.0,12/6/2013,The food is always so yummy went in for lunch service was great bartender very attentive that's a must she new her bar I'll be back for sure great prices !!
Joshua G.,"Modesto, CA",27,53,21,3.0,3/2/2015,"Came here for dinner on the 28th. We were sat quickly and our waiter quickly came over to greet us. There were 5 of us in our party. We ordered a variety of things from the menu. One person ordered a sandwich, two people ordered steak, one person ordered from the kids menu, and one person ordered a pasta. It took an unusually long time to get our food which seemed odd being the restaurant wasn't that crowded yet, but someone did come to the table and apologized for the wait. Food overall was good. Portion size generally matched the price the price point, except for the steaks which were severely undersized for the price point. (We ordered a New York and sirloin). The weight on the menu for the New York steak is deceiving. It states the steak is a 16oz, but is bone in, which means much of the weight is attributed to the bone. This is not restaurant industry standard for a New York cut. The sirloin didn't list a size on the menu, but when it came to the table, it looked like a 6 oz. Very disappointing. For the price point, we were expecting a piece of meat about double in size. We felt misled. Side portions with the steak dishes were very small for the price point. Waiter was attentive, however. Atmosphere was good, albeit slightly noisy.  Bathrooms and restaurant in general was clean.  It is a good place to have a meal, you just have to avoid certain menu items. I would recommend avoiding the steak section."
Prashant P.,"Fort McDowell, AZ",53,17,6,1.0,10/14/2015,"I was super excited to eat at BJ's after trying it in Vegas . This was my worst experience at any pizza joint I have ever been to .  Waitress was rude as soon as we got there . She kept saying I was moving spots and getting annoyed , mistaking me for my friend ... I guess all brown people look the same ??? Took forever to bring our drinks and appetizer ( she brought mine with the pizza ) didn't ask once how our food was , had to chase her down for a drink refill . The best part was that there was beef in my vegetarian pizza , my friend is also vegetarian thinks he ate something he thought was a mushroom but tasted weird . She was not apologetic at all she just got us another pizza . After making this type of mistake they still charged us for the pizza ! After complaining the manager took it off the bill . Waitress just slammed the bill down rudely . We were a party of 9 and everyone was shocked with the service we received today . Don't go here unless u want horrible service , maybe just do takeout !"
Denise V.,"Modesto, CA",0,5,,2.0,1/11/2015,"So what better yet than a Pizza pie on a cold, foggy, football Sunday? Well, it was minus the pie. Buttery, thick, and baked pie style it was not!! I was disappointed that BJ's did not come through on my suggestion to the boyz on game day!!!"
Ryan T.,"Modesto, CA",0,6,,1.0,1/9/2016,"The salmon was awful and the atmosphere was extremely unpleasant. the ghetto people next to us were cursing very loudly. It was f word this and n word that, the waiter didn't have a problem with it. The only reason we sat through it was because I had a gift card."
Megan M.,"Stockton, CA",96,144,63,2.0,4/5/2013,"I've never understood why BJ's is always packed, & my most recent experience only confirms this. My order took a much longer time than everyone else's to come out, & my waitress kept checking on it & even sent a manager over to speak with me. While I appreciate the thought, I was a bit surprised that my drink wasn't comped (I got a strawberry lemonade, so I don't think this is asking too much). If the food had been stellar, I could have even overlooked this, but after all this trouble, the food was just ok. Definitely not worth a repeat visit."
Belinda N.,"Salida, CA",57,23,2,1.0,9/28/2015,"My daughter and my small grandkids went here today about 2 on a Monday, my babies had just lost their dad suddenly on Friday so this is where they wanted to go, one of their favorite places... I realize that we were tired and have dealt with a lot but it took like 15 minutes to get us a drink (soda and water) about 10 min after that for our order to be taken (it's a Monday afternoon) I finally asked our waitress nicely (lip tattoo on her neck I have tats I have no problem with that) do you know if our food is about ready? "" i don't know I haven't asked"" alrighty then. My grandkids got their food and asked for ranch she was aggravated to go get some, they were half way done with their meal when we got ours another waitress had brought ours out, our original waitress walked up and said that was suppose to be frys with her order not salad, slapped her side with aggravation and walked off to get the fries, she did come back and apologize for the mistake but other than that I couldn't believe it. Don't want any body to get in trouble with their job, we all have our own problems...."
