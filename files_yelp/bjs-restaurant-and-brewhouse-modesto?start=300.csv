Rob G.,"Madera, CA",10,48,30,5.0,1/27/2015,Best food hands down. I love the all you can eat salad and soup. Lindsey is the bar tender....always cheerful and upbeat even when she is busy. I have a BJ's rewards card/app which adds points that Talley up and I can use for dollars off future visits....I downloaded the app for easy convenience to save or build up my points. When I'm with family or friends this is the place to visit......
Sierra C.,"Modesto, CA",7,7,,3.0,5/17/2015,"Meh. I hate all these places by the mall like applebees and the elephant bar. Skip the bj and get yourself over to chipotle for a tasty burrito. They give you too much food, the people and music are too loud and it really isn't the best family place. If you like sports there is a TV. Food is decent/good but not worth the wait or the time. It's like a carbon copy of Chicago Uno. Parking at the mall is bananas."
Army T.,"Modesto, CA",52,47,8,1.0,11/14/2015,"The food is okay. Not worth the high prices or, worse of all.. The ridiculous wait. Ate here a few times but most recently for a friend's birthday. They said it would be about a 75 minute wait which was fine and we began to wait. After seeing numerous groups and couples (who walked in as much as 40 minutes after us) being seated before us, I decided to see what the hell is up. The girl at the counter said that we were supposedly given a wait time of ""90 minutes"".. Uhhh, no. So as I asked to speak to the manager, they got spooked and gave us some other b.s to buy them time. Eventually we got seated... Eventually as in, about an hour and 45 minutes later. Took forever to take our drink orders, even longer to bring them. Longer to take our food orders and even longer than that to bring us our damn food. This place is ridiculous. We were here over 3 hours total and only had 3 beers and a entree each. Wow."
Terry W.,"Lathrop, CA",69,64,41,1.0,11/6/2015,"BJ'S just isn't  what it once was. Tonight our food was cold under/overcooked and slow. This wasn't the first time nor is it unique to Modesto. This was actually the first time to Modesto we usually go to the Stockton location. It's a shame because the ambiance is quite nice for a social gathering. Unfortunately  they are one of the few locations that cate r to the gluten-free individuals, this is primarely why we come here , a few of the friends require  this."
Tracy M.,"Modesto, CA",11,11,,3.0,5/10/2015,I am only giving 3 stars because of the Pzookie. My food was long after everyone in our group and it was wrong. Service was ok but place was so busy not sure how servers kept track of tables they waited on. This is my second and last time at this restaurant.  Trust me the line isn't long because the place is outstanding!!
Karina L.,"Modesto, CA",37,9,8,5.0,7/31/2013,"I'm only giving it 5 stars for trying to accommodate vegans! I don't like that they sell a lot of animal products, but so do most other restaurants.  We were there after 10 pm and we actually found 4 different dishes that they were willing to change for us. The manger came to our table, because I'm not only vegan, but I also eat gluten free. She was very respectful, patient and supportive and really helped us figure out what we can eat.  The waiter was great too. I had a veggie, gluten free pizza with any veggies I wanted. The pizza was very good! My boyfriend had a veggie burger. There were at least 2 other dished that we could have changed. That is more than most restaurants, except maybe ethnic places.  I hope they will have more vegan options in the future. If you are vegan go here and ask wherever you are. They will provide what we ask for! You are the customer voting every day with your wallet!"
Adam D.,"Modesto, CA",12,85,28,3.0,1/16/2014,Good food and decent service but pricey beers. I had the meat lover style deep dish pizza and it was really good. I washed it down with BJ's beer the light switch and it was really good just didn't like paying 6.50 for one glass of beer. Other than that there is plenty of food choices to choose from. I'm sure I will be returning to try different items here.
Michael K.,"Berkeley, CA",343,20,8,1.0,1/6/2013,"This was literally the worst restaurant experience I've ever had. I went with a group of 4 friends at 8:30pm on a Saturday night. We were given a half hour wait, which I had expected. Our buzzer rang at 9 and I thought that this meant they were ready for us. The waitress told us to wait at the side. Many groups after us were instructed to do so and subsequently given tables before us, until almost the whole waiting area had been cleared - which made it seem like they forgot about us. After 10 more minutes we were finally given a seat. Once we sat down a waitress told us she'll be right there and placed one drink napkin on the table (um, what?), but it did take more time before she actually came back. We ordered 2 Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo's, 1 Chicken Marsala, 1 club sandwich. The final person wanted to try to loaded baked potato. Before ordering, he wanted to know why just a baked potato was $8.00 and a menu category. The waitress assured him it was plenty of food (there's a point to this later on). She memorized it (cue signs of something bound to go wrong) and was off. We waited another half hour for our food, which I initially thought was fine. But then the food came. The two Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo's came without bread, with the waiter remarking that they were making more and would be brought out shortly. My friend's ""giant"" loaded potato was normal sized and obviously not enough for a full meal. I thought my meal would be the only one that worked, but then I cut into my chicken. It was COMPLETELY RAW aside from the outside. Disgusted, I called the waitress over - she quickly apologized and brought it back to the kitchen. My friend then called over a menu and ordered a bowl of clam chowder to add to his obvious unfulfilling potato. I then waited another 20 minutes for my food to be returned. My two other friends finished their pasta's - but they never got the bread that the waiter said he was bringing (didn't see that one coming). While I was waiting, another waiter brought my friend a cup of clam chowder - which he then had to ask another waiter to fix because he had, like I said, ordered a bowl. Their fix? They brought out another cup of clam chowder claiming that two cups were equivalent to one of their bowls (by this point, I was having trouble believing them). Then, finally, they returned my Chicken Marsala with another apology. Fortunately, it tasted fine; unfortunately, I was the only one of our group of 5 now eating. Then, when I was almost finished, they brought out the bread he had promised 45 minutes ago. We finished our meal with a pizookie trio. They gave us our check once we had finished the dessert, and I noticed there were very few people sitting around us. The time read 10:45pm - 2 hours and 15 minutes after we had originally came to BJs. I'm fine with waiting, but that seems a little extreme. Oh, and did I mention that they billed us for my raw chicken dish? I'm not one to complain about  waiting or prices, because both of these things can't be controlled by the staff. But I'm giving 1 star because literally anything that they could have done wrong to us happened."
Troy L.,"Oakland, CA",104,15,9,4.0,8/16/2013,"Now my first time to this place was 2 weeks ago, I had NEVER been to a BJ's before in my life. And I have to say that I liked the menu as well as the drinks prepared here. Far from my favorite restaurant serving so many types of food, but hey... In Modesto, this place is amazing. I've had their Caesar Salad, Pasta, and Pizza. They were all great, and I would definitely go here again when I'm back in town for work. Modesto doesn't have much in the way of restaurants, unless you think of fast food joints. So I will be succinct, go here if you're ever in town. It's the best place I've eaten at, so far down there, that's gave me good service and great food."
Courtney R.,"Modesto, CA",3,65,5,1.0,8/29/2014,"This is one of the worst restaurants in Modesto. The service is consistently awful, the portions are very small, and the food is expensive. Especially the miniature drinks for full price. I give this place a chance every once in a while and nothing ever changes. I'll be at Johnny Carino's from now on."
Carmen F.,"Turlock, CA",284,18,1,1.0,9/6/2015,I've never had a problem here until last night. My chicken came out RAW. shouldn't the cooks be checking if the meat is cooked thoroughly? The waiter comp'd me a salad while I waited for my dish to be prepared again but even then there were still stems in the salad and I had to pick them out. He also informed us that throughout the entire day orders have been coming out with RAW meat and that they were running out of food in general. We were still charged for the mess up. Not planning on going back there anytime soon.
Jessica G.,"Oakdale, CA",126,42,25,4.0,12/27/2013,"Even though every time me and my friends go to BJs they treat us like shit we always keep coming back. The food is so consistent, can't argue with it plus the rewards program is legit. Service is like, the worst but we've come to expect it. Atlantic salmon is so good and chicken club flatbread pizza as an app is perfect. Love the big booths too!"
Christina M.,"Atwater, CA",0,4,,5.0,1/19/2016,"I finally went back to BJs. Complete turnaround! The waitress, Micayla, was very friendly and welcoming in addition to efficient. The food was amazing (I strongly suggest the Brisket and Bacon burger, it's excellent). I'm very pleased and more than willing to come back. Thank you!"
M. M.,"Escalon, CA",0,1,,1.0,11/15/2015,"Ordered Tomato Bisque soup and got this 1/2 inch of oil in a bowl!  Unedible....could not believe that a server would put that in front of me.  When the server asked what was wrong with the soup I told her about this oil slick in my bowl and she said....."".Oh ya, I noticed that!""....really? Got my new bowl and have been sick ever since.  Horrible.  It's a shame because it used to be so good.  Service and food have both gone downhill.  They are pulling a Chilies.  Get us to come in and then slowly cheapen up on quality."
Jackie Z.,"Modesto, CA",191,571,520,2.0,6/10/2014,Food was great but the service was awful. Our waitress couldn't handle a party next to us and us at the same time. We asked for the manager because we wanted refills and the server couldn't do that. The waitress I guess came by while I was in the restroom and told the rest of the table that she was sorry she couldn't serve us better. WOW! Might wanna look for a new job since you can't do this one.
Wendy M.,"Riverbank, CA",4,52,11,5.0,9/9/2012,"Went with the family today for lunch, and while I agree that it's more of a date night sort of restaurant, our visit was a great one! They've got a great modern design, obviously a brewhouse so a bit of art is there. Spotless, plus the lighting and seating are both gorgeous. The food is just wonderful. We got a two of the ""2-for-20"" specials, which included a soup, medium pizza and dessert. Clam chowder was creamy and thick, delicious. Pizza wasn't exactly breathtaking, but excellent for its price. For the meat lovers I suggest the five meat gourmet! Afterwards we received our cookie+ice cream dessert in triple chocolate. Warm, gooey cookie with two chocolate scoops, plus a nice chocolate piece on top. Talk about a new guilty pleasure! Strawberry lemonade is lovely. Service was very nice, we were constantly checked on, treated like respected customers. Definitely coming back."
Kirk T.,"Portland, OR",124,112,423,2.0,5/16/2014,"Service on the floor ANYWHERE here, other than seated on the bar, can be hit or miss. It is nice however to have a brewpub in Modesto that 1.) Has a fair, proprietary brewed beer selection on tap. 2.) Has killer pizzas. For both points, you may have to put up with sub-par service, and/or long waits. Should you have to? No. Share your truthful, concise comments with the on-duty manager. Maybe someday, we will be heard.  Until then, 2 stars. Oh, and Chimay Grand Reserve is still here in the 11 ounce bottles. That might make 3 stars...  Nahhhhh."
Thatguy E.,"Modesto, CA",0,7,5,3.0,12/23/2014,It's a little rough in Modesto to get good service with out an attitude when a place is slam. My experience was not the best but it they were slammed and short handed so I don't blame her. The company should have anticipated this before Christmas.
Alex S.,"Modesto, CA",0,10,,4.0,3/2/2015,"The food is really good and the setting is pretty good too, but there are all lot of people waiting for a limited amount of space , The wait time usuallyis between 25 to 30 minutes but sometimes the wait is horrendous"
Juan C.,"Salida, CA",11,165,82,5.0,1/16/2015,"I love this place. It's one of my top picks for dates with my fiancé. I love to eat their Maui glazed pork chops, or buffalo wings. My favorite drink here is the black cherry soda they handcraft there. I'm always pleased every single time I go here. They also have a few games going on every single time so definitely two thumbs up here!!"
