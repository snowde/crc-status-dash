Bonnie V.,"Modesto, CA",2,22,5,5.0,7/17/2014,"I love their pan pizza so delicious.   had lunch with my best friend today even though it seem busy their service really quick, big plus is our server very friendly"
Tabitha M.,"Mountain View, CA",13,3,,1.0,10/7/2012,"Horrible customer service every time and an impossible wait. Whatever the wait time they tell you, double it and then maybe you'll get in.  Food quality is generic and poor. Overpriced food and drink. Overrated and don't understand the wait. Go across the street to mikes roadhouse for outstanding service and support the local businesses"
Joshua L.,"Ripon, CA",4,7,,3.0,8/26/2014,"The food is good and usually there are very polite and courteous waiters, but every time I go there someone in my party or myself has to send the food back and have the cooks fix the order. Either there is miscommunication between the cooks and the waiters, or the cooks are just becoming lazy and not making the effort to change the recipe and customize the orders."
Nick M.,"Ceres, CA",34,34,3,3.0,11/15/2012,"It's unfortunate to rate this place only 3 stars. The building is beautiful and nice to look at whether you're inside or outside. The food is great in my opinion. I haven't had any item off of the menu yet that I have been disappointed in.  Where BJ'S is lacking are there servers. They hire a bunch of pretty, young, forgetful little girls that can't seem to remember easy things like drinks, dipping sauces, garlic bread, etc. even after writing everything down! If you want to finish your meal sometime in this lifetime BJ's is not for you. If you don't mind waiting for long periods of time and having to remind your server two or three times about what you have ordered then you will feel right at home at BJ's.  Two stars for the service and another star for the food. If I didn't love their Hopstorm IPA so much, I might consider not coming here as often, but it is too good to resist!!"
Cecilia B.,"Manteca, CA",141,118,30,3.0,2/26/2013,"Like any other main stream kind of restaurant... Service here is a hit or miss. I work at the mall and sometimes come here for my lunch break. Unlimited soup & salad for $8 not a bad deal Monday-Friday until 3PM. Recently, I've been here and the bartender, Lindsey, was amazing! It wasn't too crowded at the actual bar around 1PM but all the other tables in the bar area were occupied. She was real attentive to me and the 3 other guys at the bar. She was witty and made nice small chat with each of us. That was nice!  Dinner time and weekends its rough! Busy and not the best service sometimes. But like I said with such a big chain of a restaurant it's a hit or miss."
Rosita I.,"San Jose, CA",28,23,4,4.0,3/3/2013,"Friendly people! Great lunch prices! I would love to see more of a beer selection.  It is a ""Brewery"" It would be nice and great advertisement for other local beer companies!  Great place to hang out with friends and family."
Shreya G.,"Fremont, CA",27,169,184,5.0,12/22/2010,"I want to give this BJ's 4.5 stars. I'm only giving a -0.5 because their floors are so clean I pretty much almost slipped and caused a scene.  It was noon, 12 on the dot, and my mother and I walk into BJ's hoping for a nice, sit-down lunch. Every single table was filled. I've been to many BJ's locations, and this particular restaurant was almost twice the size of the ones that I have been to. We were seated very quickly at a mini booth, where we were quickly served drinks (water). Within five minutes, we had a waitress coming to us and asking us what we wanted, and we ordered the endless soup and salad for 6.95. Within three minutes, we already had our salads and soups on the table. This is what I call fast service!  My mother and I are enjoying our meals and as we finish our salad, our wonderful waitress walks by and ask us if we are ready for our next salad.  What? She asked us if we were ready? How amazing is that? At the BJ's in Cupertino, flagging down a waitress for a fork was a big deal. Here, our waitress, who you can tell was trying very hard, was ready for us to receive our next salad and soup.  Throughout the whole meal, on target, as we finished our soup or our salad, our waitress was there to make sure that we received our next rounds in a timely manner. Did I also mention she asked me if I wanted my soup in a sourdough bread bowl? I had the tuscan tomato bisque in the bread bowl, and let me tell you, it was definitely worth the extra $2.  I really do wish I knew my waitress's name, but she was so lightning fast I couldn't see her name tag. She really was outstanding amongst all the other waiters and waitresses there, and even outstanding amongst other waiters and waitress that I have seen."
Shalonda A.,"Pleasanton, CA",77,32,13,4.0,6/15/2013,"My 1st experience was a great experience. Took my father, for Father's Day, he's a very picky eater. He loved it. It was nice & clean & great service, good food. Yummy desert. Dad doesn't drink so must come back with some drunkards LOL"
Jessica B.,"Modesto, CA",0,9,,4.0,2/4/2015,"I had great service and the beer selection has a nice variety. The entire staff is super friendly, and the pizookies with the vanilla bean ice cream is a must if you come here!"
Jorgess M.,"Roseville, CA",198,268,166,1.0,7/17/2012,"The second BJ's I have ever been to and the first one in Roseville is awesome. I was excited to go to Modesto with my boyfriend to go shopping and to actually eat here. It was between this or Buffalo Wild Wings right in front, unfortunately BJ's won. I regret it now....  Walked in, hostess told us it'll be about a couple minutes because they're still cleaning up our table. So we stood there, awkwardly, with her just staring at us, and awkward.... We finally got to our table and long story short....  Service:  Waitress came off as rude, but I didn't wanna judge her right away, however, throughout our lunch I realized she really was just rude. My boyfriend is a pretty chill and nice person, who doesn't get bothered by anyone, but this fool just rubbed him the wrong way. She seriously just ignored everything about us. We put our glasses at the edge of the table so she can see that we need refills but still nothing for about fifteen minutes until my boyfriend finally decided to ask her. The craziest thing at the end of our lunch happened too (as if we didn't already hate her), we asked for more refills and she filled it up HALFWAY!!!!! WTF!!?? Seriously!? Food: Their pizza didn't really help our experience either. We ordered a medium great white and that was lame. Barely any sauce which made the whole pizza extremely blah, and the chicken was as dry as the desert, so that was probably one of the worst pizzas I've had (Digiorno Pizza is better). We also ordered calamari and that was even worse. The presentation was horrible!!!! Horrible I say! It looks like it came from a frozen meal, the whole thing was falling apart, and it tasted like it was just microwaved, no crunchiness to it whatsoever, or just anything. Unfortunately, never ever coming back here....Buffalo Wild Wings it is!"
Cat R.,"Petaluma, CA",124,8,,2.0,7/27/2014,"I normally like BJs, good menu selection, good drinks. Today I was pretty offended. I came here for lunch with my 2-year old daughter. We ordered and received our appetizers in a timely manner. I then took my daughter to the bathroom and of course took my purse with me (why would I leave it? I don't trust anyone). When we got back, our whole table was cleared, high chair gone! What in the world?!  Rude! Are patrons dining alone or with small children not allowed to leave their table for fear that everything will be gone when they come back? We were gone 5 minutes! I can't imagine what would happen if she took a long time in the potty. Would there be new customers at our table? And no one apologized as they were rushing to bring everything back."
Mike A.,"San Jose, CA",0,13,,5.0,10/26/2014,"Outstanding service! I've always enjoyed bjs food, however every time I visit this location the service is stellar! The server Sarah and busser Jaran are both great and very attentive. I strongly recommend visiting this location if quality food and amazing customer service is what you're looking for!"
Kendyl P.,"Ripon, CA",231,8,13,1.0,8/11/2015,"Okay I've been here many times and to multiple restaurants. This was by far the WORST experience I ever had. Minus the fact that it wasn't busy and we waited over an hour for our food, we got our drinks well after our appetizer came out. Our waitress was not the best and her attitude seemed somewhere else rather than to the customer. The food this time was just okay, and our food came out one plate at a time and 10 mins apart!! We ordered clam chowder in a bread bowl and at first they brought it out in a bowl, then we told them that we ordered the bread and the boy (not our waiter) we extreme nice about it, but the surprise came when we got it back, they reduced the size of the BOWL of soup to a cup. I have never seen clam chowder in such a little portion before. They said they use a ""new device"" to make the hole in the bread.. The new ""device"" seems more to me like the top of a cup.. We talked with the manager after and he was very sweet to use and gave us a courtesy card but I just could not believe the service."
Yesenia A.,"Modesto, CA",0,8,,2.0,7/26/2015,BJ's is good if you're going to be eating there. This is the 4th time I do the Curbside (Take Out) and the food is HORRIBLE! I keep trying it thinking that maybe it was just that one time and no its horrible EVERY single time.
Lore P.,"Minneapolis, MN",9,11,20,4.0,8/7/2011,"I have always had great food at BJs but I tend to get the same things (like tomato bisque in sour dough bowl).  Even though I always get the same thing, the other food seems to be pretty good.  My family leans towards the bbq pulled pork sandwiches and the salads.  Their food consistently good and my husband loves the beer & root beer. Service can be pretty uneven though.  Today as I write this we have an awesome server but there have been times when the service has been quite poor.  I also find it a tad too loud.  With the loud music and the high ceilings sound just echos and echoes, so it isn't a place to go for quiet conversation.  Its like part sports bar and part brew pub, but it doesn't have the energy of a sports bar or the coziness of a pub. Still, without uneven service and loud atmosphere, I would give BJ a five star because their food is very tasty, creative and fun!"
Ry D.,"Los Banos, CA",0,30,7,5.0,5/4/2014,"One word: YUM! BJ's restaurant never seems to disappoint. I've ordered many different things here and it's always yummy!! Service is great, they're friendly and pretty fast at getting orders out. My favorite thing here is the deep dish pizza! I get mine with cheese, ham, bacon and Alfredo sauce. It's delicious!! This is one of my favorite restaurants! Oh by the way, it's always busy so be prepared to be put on a waiting list, especially on a Friday night."
Chris N.,"Knights Ferry, CA",0,71,3,4.0,9/13/2013,"I really like this location - Great quality and service. The four star rating is based on their lunch menu deals. - A lot of great food, at a low price. The first lunch - Half a stuffed potato (a *large* half) and their house salad. Friend had the personal deep-dish pizza and Caesar salad. Really good, and inexpensive to boot. Second lunch - We both had the unlimited soup and salad. There were five salads and five soups to choose from. The day's special salads were excellent - One was sliced tomato/buffalo mozzarella cheese salad with a great vinaigrette, and the other was a watermelon and feta cheese salad. I also tried their wedge salad, which had thick-sliced bacon and chopped tomatoes over chunky blue cheese dressing. (The other two choices were house and Caesar, which I had before and were fresh and tasty).  The Chicken Tortilla soup is great. They bring out a bowl with fresh avocado, cheddar cheese and crisp tortilla strips and then pour the chicken soup into the bowl there at the table. It comes with a nice lime wedge, and all of the flavors together are SO GOOD. The clam chowder is almost like a ""stew,"" incredibly thick and just the right potato/clam ratio. Delicious. The chili was great, and I can't speak for the other two soups as I was too full to order another dish.  All of this, for only $7.50. It's a deal that's hard to beat.."
Noemi B.,"San Jose, CA",14,7,1,1.0,3/10/2015,"This was the worst experience at this restaurant the food was okay and me and some friends along with my 5 year old daughter ate diner last night at the restaurant when everything was said and done and received our bill we noticed that there was an item that we didn't order (it was less than a 5 dollar item) so we didn't make a big deal when the server asked what was wrong we mentioned there was an extra item and she said sorry ill fix that and a manger/supervisor by the name of STEWART LENOWITZ 6'3  came and said verbatim ""I hear that there is something wrong with your bill and its something you ate but not wanting to pay"" he was standing over us and my 5 year old daughter yelling and being condescending. I was mortified my friend was standing next to him and asked to back off because he was centimeters away from his face. He not only cussed at us but was yelling saying he was calling the cops. This whole time my daughter was crying and scared we paid of course but this man should not be a manager everyone looked at him disgustingly because we had a child and she was scared. Worst experience ever never going back and hope this man realizes what he did."
Bailey H.,"Modesto, CA",2,21,,4.0,10/25/2014,"Really nice selection of beers, although that's to be expected at a ""brewhouse"". They have really fresh, delicious food. I love their caprese salad and their parmesan chicken is to die for! Definitely recommend!"
Christine S.,"Orlando, FL",4,12,14,5.0,4/16/2014,Omg so yummy! Everything was fantastic from the service to the parm crusted chicken with phenomenal asparagus to the salted caramel PAZOOKIE! Out waiter Josh was awesome! So attentive and quick to fill our drinks!!!! REQUEST HIM! The new manger Eric B is on point! So friendly and personable and amazingly is able to run this large restaurant with ease! GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE AND FOOD! These days it's hard to find both BUT this BJs has it all figured out!!!!! Can't wait to come back!
