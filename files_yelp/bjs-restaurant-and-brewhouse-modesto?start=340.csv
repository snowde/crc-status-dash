Aden B.,"Modesto, CA",0,8,3,1.0,6/28/2015,"Ordered a pizza at BJ's. It was pretty bland in flavor, but we ate it, until we found - you guessed it - a used bandage. This is not only a foreign object but a biohazard. This place is in serious need of a health inspection. Oh, and the waiters were very rude."
John B.,"Ripon, CA",0,30,,5.0,9/29/2015,Good brew. Multiple brews. Large menu. Good staff. The burgers are great. They don't have garlic for their fries which is a bummer
Donna H.,"Modesto, CA",22,12,,5.0,11/11/2015,Thank you for the veterans day meal.  Husband had cherry chipotle salmon and loved it. Just the right amount of kick in the seasoning.  I had tomato basil soup and I can't get enough of it - perfect texture and flavor.  I also had the tomato salad - yummy.  Service was great and the place was really really crowded.
Chris B.,"Modesto, CA",155,33,2,5.0,8/7/2014,Took my girlfriend here and we both loved the food.  Very delicious and fast service....  I would recommend this place to everyone...
Maddy F.,"Gustine, CA",2,6,,1.0,1/25/2015,My waitress was terrible. Her name was Kristin. And the manager adrian didn't help at all. The food was disgusting and I will probably never come here again. I'm disappointed.
Nick B.,"Tracy, CA",0,9,,4.0,9/3/2015,"really liked the tatonka stout, the PM porter was below average in my opinion. the chicken bacon ranch deep dish pizza is solid.  a bit expensive for the quantity, but not too bad"
Ana S.,"Modesto, CA",0,4,,1.0,5/18/2014,"Went on a weekend to hang out with family. After we got seated we ordered a few drinks from the bar and after 15 minutes we called up to speak to a manager and it still took another good 10 minutes. Like hello, get more people to work in the bar when its the weekend. Our waiter was excellent however the wait time was ridiculous."
Cheri B.,"Modesto, CA",14,32,,2.0,2/12/2014,"Eh where to start. Every single time I have been here they ALWAYS put tomatoes on my great white pizza. Idk why it's always so hard. The last time we were here I reminded the waiter 2 times about the tomatoes and what do you know we still got them on our pizza. The manager came up and offered a pazookie on the house, we ordered half peanut butter half Oreo. Well we got half Oreo half chocolate chip. The food is so good but sick of them always messing up."
David P.,"Modesto, CA",0,3,,4.0,7/21/2015,I'm a fan of their eclectic menu. Went for brunch on a Sunday and really enjoyed their pancakes.
Charlie O.,"Waukon, IA",776,1198,210,3.0,8/13/2011,"Stopped in here the other day for lunch. We both ordered the deep dish pizza and drinks, me water she root beer. Our server was very nice, helpful and brought our drinks right away. The pizza's once we got them were very good. The problem was that the kitchen made a mistake and had to redo them. Our server came to apologize and explained what had happened. She then sent the manager to our table to also explain what had happened to our order and stated that our lunch would be comped and we would be receiving a free dessert. This was fine with us. We weren't complaining, just figured that they were busy but we did appreciate the apology. In the meantime our server brought us samples of all of their sodas which was very thoughtful of her.  Here's the bummer. When we were done our server brought us the bill and then told us that the dessert and one drink were comped. Whoa!!! What happened to the manager stating that the whole ticket would be comped??? Manager had a change of heart???? Not good business. When you tell customers that you screwed up and that their lunch will be comped, you don't go back on your word. Wish I would have gotten the managers name. Would like to have blasted it all over Yelp. Anyhow people if it ever happens to any of you I would suggest you get the ""your lunch will be comped"" in writing."
Paullette W.,"Modesto, CA",8,2,,5.0,9/23/2014,"My daughter and I stopped in a couple of weeks ago for a cold drink and appetizer to take a much needed break from a day of shopping !  This was our first time visiting and we loved it !  Great atmosphere, service and our server was Awesome !  We are going again tonite as my daughter wants to go here for her birthday dinner. Looking forward to a good time with family and good food too !"
Mark M.,"Chino, CA",0,2,1,1.0,4/29/2015,"waited over 1 hour for our pizza to come out, and when we ask to follow up our order, the server told us its only been 10 min! and with an attitude when its clearly its over an hour already, when i asked for her name she walked off then The manager came and we told them about our complain and he him self was showing an attitude towards us, so we just decided to just cancel our order"
Jane P.,"Long Beach, CA",13,34,11,2.0,8/13/2013,"Service - I don't want to do this, but I'm going to pull out the race card. To Karen, did you not want to serve us, that resulted in you not clearing off the table that we had asked for. Well, at first, that's what I thought.  So, when 5 minutes gone by, and still no one came. We sat ourselves at the bar nearby. We waved it off. We, too, owned a restaurant. We know how it feels like to be busy. In fact, we just closed it down, and came to BJs for a late dinner. (Had to point that out to prove we can relate :D) We waited for you to take our orders, but after many servers walked passed by.. We finally flagged one down ourselves. Awesome. After we got our drinks, we waited for our appetizers.. And after we finished our appetizers.. We waited to order our entrees. We asked for forks and spoons 3 times after appetizers. Then we realized, we weren't the only customers that waited a bit too long for the order to take place, the food to get to the table, etc. When you were caught up between our table and another table, you didn't bother telling us to that you'll be back.  Yes, you did come back, but I still find that extremely rude that you turned away from us without explanation. A simple one wouldn't hurt. My cousins reassured me that this is normal, you guys are slow. Forget the food. Food's not enjoyable when servers dampens your mood. Customer service do matter. Try it one day, you might actually get more tips. Well, if you want more tips, I guess."
Michael K.,"Modesto, CA",0,11,,1.0,1/24/2014,"Been to BJ's several times. Used to be a solid 4 stars. The service has gone down hill and the food has really taken a turn for the worse. They changed their menu to eliminate the traditional dinners. That leaves you with pizza, sandwiches, burgers, pasta, and a few other items. Our sandwiches were terrible and the blue cheese salads were worse!  How can blue cheese dressing taste like sour cream mixed with feta cheese? The au jus for my beef dip sandwich was so salty it could not be used. The only good thing about our meal were the straw fry's. Honestly, Perco's has better food than BJ's. Don't waste your money. It's a shame such a nice place could just fall apart like this."
Joe A.,"Modesto, CA",0,5,,4.0,9/11/2014,"Had a delightful night, service was on their toes, drinks stayed full and so did our bellies. Perfection was in the beer sampling, must say it was the right place to go at the right time. We hope everything that happened tonight happens on our future visits."
Megan S.,"Modesto, CA",0,25,2,5.0,7/25/2014,"I love this place! Great food, my top 3: BJ's favorite deep dish pizza, french dip and the California chicken club. Those skinny little fries are delicious too! I've never had bad service, they have any amazing drink menu - great beers and cocktails and I love the restaurant design. Oh and the pizookies are one of the most amazing desserts to grace the face of this earth. One of my favorite places to eat!"
R K.,"Modesto, CA",66,28,10,1.0,12/23/2014,"I have been here many times, however, I don't know what happened to this restaurant. We had bad service, ignored, extremely long wait to get food (it was not busy), food was mediocre at best. Wont go back. Bill was $90. Absolutely not worth even half of that! Still havent gotten a reply back from corporate, after filing a complaint."
Robert S.,"Merced, CA",39,4,,2.0,3/9/2014,"Friendly staff. Greasy food but, good taste. Dissapointed in the portion size for the price."
Jeff S.,"Modesto, CA",37,8,,2.0,7/31/2013,"I went to eat here with my wife and the service I got here was horrible.  We sat at our table for 30 minutes before we even got a water.  It seemed like the tables with 4 or more people were getting much more attention.  Finally I ordered. I asked for their avocado egg roll appetizer and they completely forgot to put that order in. The waitress said she was overwhelmed. Come on now she just didn't give me or my wife any attention. Finally got our food 1:40 after being seated. Good place to eat with a group of friends and drink beer, but horrible place to take your wife or go on a 1on 1 date"
Rusty S.,"Modesto, CA",107,4,,5.0,5/14/2014,"A little on the loud side, but a lot of people were there to watch sports and take advantage of the happy hour. Everything I noticed seemed really clean, and our server was very funny."
