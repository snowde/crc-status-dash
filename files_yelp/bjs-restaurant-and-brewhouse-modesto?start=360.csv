Erica C.,"Oakdale, CA",1,7,,2.0,2/16/2014,"We used to love this place but last night we had a very bad experience- quoted that the wait was 30 min and waited 50 min, appetizer took forever to come out & we cancelled it, food also took a while to come out, food was mediocre.. Only went because we had gift cards.. Probably won't be going back"
Eyn E.,"Modesto, CA",9,40,51,5.0,12/25/2011,"The atmosphere is casual yet classy at the same time. The foods is great. The fish tacos are my favorite. They also make a really good tomato bisque. The burgers are good too and cooked to medium with just a touch of pink...perfect. If you're a beer fan (me me me I am I am!!!!) Then this is a great place. Jeremiah red is my favorite. Great food, great service, great beer."
Judy S.,"Modesto, CA",12,1,7,1.0,11/2/2013,"Bad service and the food was just nasty!Thought I would give this place another chance, but this is the last time I'll be coming here."
Amber S.,"Turlock, CA",0,20,1,4.0,3/7/2016,"I order BJ's To-Go probably once a week. It's easy because it's restaurant food you can order through their app, get rewards over time, park at curbside, and you don't even have to leave your car (food typically ready within 15min of ordering). I'm obviously a frequent customer at curbside and there's only been 2 instances where my service was just terrible to say the least. When you order through the app, you get a link to do a survey after you've received your food. I normally give high ratings and praise for everything so when those 2 separate times came around and my rating was lower than normal, the managers listened! I did not expect any kind of monetary gain from the surveys (and honestly doubted anyone read them) but when I informed them each separate time about the bad service through those surveys, I got a curtesy gift card and apology from the manager. This is the kind of service that keeps me going to BJs. An off server or bad experience one day does not omit all the other good days I experience with them."
Manija H.,"Manteca, CA",3,39,18,1.0,9/19/2013,Normally I'm one to write reviews about places that I enjoy. Places I dnt like I just dnt ever go back. However I usually like the service here and the food is good. on a particular night I had a waitress who  rubbed me the wrong way. Take that racist attitude elsewhere. There was another waitress nearby that actually noticed the other girls attitude and started to serve us. Our original waitress even got offended that we tipped the waitress that served us the whole time we were there! U should be happy u even got a tip from me. I'm sure with that attitude she has had plenty of complaints! Fire her!
Kasey V.,"Ceres, CA",12,9,,1.0,5/27/2013,"I have eaten here about 10 times and each visit is worse and my experience yesterday ensures I will not be going back there again. It was a lunch with my mom cousin & aunt for my birthday. My mom and I arrived first so we waited to order. Our waitress took our drink order and we got those right away. So while we are waiting I notice our waitress leaning on the wall with her head resting on the wall as well. Completely unprofessional. After she took our order she went on break. Our new waitress brought our drinks and my cousins was diet when she ordered regular. They brought her another diet to replace it. Finally on the 3rd try they got it right. Then we get our food except for my aunt. All three of us were done eating and my aunt still hadn't got her food. We ask about it and turns out that they just forgot to cook it but were cooking it then. The manger brought it out and apologized but did not offer any discount. They our bills come and we see there was no discount so we mention it to our waitress and she has the manager comp my aunts meal (that was nice) My cousins pays with a hundred dollar bill. She gets 2 rubber band stacks of ones back for change. That is $50 in ones! could not believe it!  I ordered the grilled mahi mahi. It was way over cooked, rubbery and no taste. The rice under it was mushy but tasted good. My IPA I ordered was great though.  It is extremely loud and the service is always disappointing."
Caligirl C.,"Modesto, CA",13,50,122,5.0,8/9/2011,Food is good.. Great location..good selections on menu.. I've been here many times.. I will keep going here if things only stay on a postive note..
sarah s.,"Stockton, CA",29,24,2,4.0,4/26/2012,"One of my favorite places in Modesto. Love their balsamic chicken dish, its my fave!  I was dissapointed with their customer service on my last visit; thus, when I went home, I filed a complaint. The manager responded the next day & apologized for the bad service & asked for my address to send me a complimentary gift card! He was super nice & friendly. Will obviously be returning:-))"
Mary H.,"Tracy, CA",338,197,868,5.0,10/13/2013,"Yvonne was a great server. We came late night because it was open and we were waiting for out daughter to deliver our grandson at Kaiser, just down the road. We had happy hour specials...buffalo wings, sliders and chicken lettuce wraps. Service was great, we ended with a peanut butter pazooki that was yummy"
Lucas P.,"Modesto, CA",1,9,1,4.0,10/30/2013,Great food great service. If they do get something wrong or take too long they always hook you up with a free dessert or whole meal. But they do screw up a lot lol so I guess I get a lot of free food there lmao
Vince V.,"Carlsbad, CA",200,496,89,3.0,5/25/2011,"***Bar review only*** So my brother lives near this spot, and this is his weekly bar.  It's a typical BJ's restaurant, just what you expect.  The bartender? No bueno. Wasn't a fan of her whatsoever.  They offer a daily happy hour from 3-6PM, and again at 10PM."
Vinay D.,"Modesto, CA",0,1,,2.0,11/1/2014,"Where do I start? First we wait almost 1.5 hours to get seated.  Then we we order our appetizers.  One appetizer comes 35 mins later, the other the waiter says is on the way.  We wait another 20 mins and still no appetizer. Our waiter said he's gonna check on them in the kitchen and after three visits to our table still no wings.  He said there was a mishap with the order and askes if we still want the appetizer.  We cancel the order for the appetizer and place our dinner order.  That goes well and we get the food promptly.  It's good, which is why I gave the 2 star rating instead of one.  We want to order dessert, but our check is already at our table.  So we say screw it let's just get out of here.  We got one check for 8 people.  The guy didn't even ask if we wanted it split.  After we explained how we wanted it split, he brought the new checks back.  He messed up splitting the check and ended up charging the whole thing on one card.  No apologies for anything, the wait or the screwed up order or the botched payment.  Were not annoying or obnoxious customers that deserve to get that kind of service.  Worst birthday dinner ever."
Belle U.,"Manteca, CA",2,33,3,2.0,7/27/2013,"This is not the place to go for a nice, quiet lunch. It seems like they are super busy every day during lunch hours. The wait is super long and the lines start outside. The service is horrible since there are so many people. I barely ever get service. I try to give this place the benefit of the doubt every time I come here but it's always horrible. Not worth coming to at all unless it's during a time where it's not busy at all."
Honest M.,"Modesto, CA",1,34,2,1.0,11/6/2015,"Disappointed. We came here for my father in laws birthday, and we sat at the bar to wait for our table. My mother in law accidentally spilt her entire drink following the hostess from the bar to the table. The hostess told her don't worry, I'll get it replaced. The waitress, English, comes up to our table and apologizes saying they can't just ""give free drinks"". We explained that we weren't looking for a free drink, we were simply asking for what we paid for to be replaced. She spoke with a manager, he/she said no. I asked for her to speak with the head manager, and apparently the head manager said no also - stating that again, ""they don't give free drinks"". Are you serious? She was trying to walk with a cocktail to the table and dropped it. Where's the customer service? Maybe the server or hostess should take the drinks from the bar to the table for their guests. Hmmm, just a common sense thought. English was respectful, but she could have at least sent the manager to talk to us since I complained about the drink replacement twice."
Raymond R.,"Turlock, CA",3,73,12,3.0,11/19/2013,The food here is good. Prices are reasonable. The only thing that bothers me is that its a hit and miss with true customer service.
MaryAnna F.,"Pacific Grove, CA",1,4,27,5.0,10/27/2013,"We had a Party of 16 People Celebrating my Parents Anniversary, Our waitress was so accommodating, she was excellent. The food was wonderful everyone in our Party was very pleased. I highly recommend BJ 's  Brewery for any occasion."
Victoria B.,"Ceres, CA",27,15,,3.0,8/13/2013,The food was good enough but the service was awful. The wait staff took forever to do anything I mean anything and everything was a waiting game. From taking our order to bringing us our order. The one thing good i can say is the three star rating is for the manager. When I told him that we had been there for over 2 1/2 hrs for just a pizza order he apologized and gave us the pizza and desserts for free
Bryana M.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",0,44,12,4.0,1/19/2014,"Excellent food. My husband and I both love to eat at BJ's. Apparently so does the rest of Modesto. It is one of the ""nicer"" restaurants in Modesto so it is understandable that it is so busy. Service is usually slow which is one downside to eating here...overall I am happy with the service and food"
Richard G.,"Santa Clara, CA",4382,841,711,3.0,12/5/2012,"It's your typical BJ's. I've been here a couple of times for happy hour and the food has just been OK. I didn't care much for the pizza, but the appetizers have been consistently good... If you are looking for a good time and food that is sub-par at most  then this is the spot for you...I'll just stick to the drinks here overall....."
Marcy B.,"Modesto, CA",3,18,,2.0,11/15/2014,5 of us went for dinner. Appetizers came out fairly quickly. When dinner came 2 out of the 5 had there entrees. A little later 2 more entrees came. 10 min later the waitress came by and we asked her where the missing 5th entree was (it was just another burger). The waitress replied they told me he got it. Well we hen you come up to a table and the person who was suppose to have his food has no plate in front of them ......  Finally 5 min later when everyone elses food was cold the burger arrived. My husband's burger which was one of the originally delivered entrees looked like someone sat on it flat as a pancake. Will never go back.
