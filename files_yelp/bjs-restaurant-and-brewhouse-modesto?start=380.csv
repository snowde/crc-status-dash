Deana L.,"Riverbank, CA",1,17,,4.0,11/2/2014,"Stopped in for lunch, service was friendly but a little slow and I had to ask for a drink refill but the food was great, we ordered a flat bread pizza and pesto chicken sandwich and they both had great flavor, no complaints on the food! We will be back!"
Gary B.,"Oakdale, CA",5,127,30,1.0,10/9/2010,"Slow. What else can I say.  I've been here like 3 times now.  Each time has been pretty much an equally bad experience. One time the manager had to give us our dinner and drinks we sat so long.  Another time we just sat and sat and sat.   For some strange reason we decided to try it another time.  And of course, slow. Good beer and decent food but I can't see going ever again."
M S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/28/2013,"My experience was so terrible that I had to create a Yelp account!!!  There's absolutely ONE reason why I'd give this location a star: the server. He was wonderful & helpful & the only one who went out of his way for his customers. I am a regular customer to BJ's but this was my first time at this location & the worse restaurant experience ever!! Everything was just ridiculous. I went in tonight for dinner, my last night before I head home tomorrow, & was met with a horrible, horrible experience. The food, the manager, the food AGAIN, then the manager AGAIN! I came into dinner with a party of 4 including myself, & we were seated promptly. Orders taken & everything in an orderly fashion. My first complaint is that one of the orders, their famous rib eye steak, was literally half fat. I understand that it's a fatty type of steak, but for half of the steak to have that much fat, we weren't paying $20 for fat. So the server replaces it with the new york steak because it's leaner, & that was charred. Burned. Inedible. However we weren't going to wait an additional 20 minutes for another awful steak. Then a manager, named Paul (just Paul since he refused to give us his last name) passed by with a ""oh, your new steak is here"" without even caring to stop. Just passed by. After all of that, I ordered my pizookie, because at this point that's the only thing that could make this AWFUL experience tolerable. & after a few bites, I find a sharp piece of plastic, in my mouth. I ask for the manager once again, & the only thing she offers me is a guest complaint sheet. What good is that to me at the moment?! The management is horrible, not going the extra step in making their customer happy. The management didn't know how to handle the situation & left customers unhappy & dissatisfied!!! DRIVE the extra miles to the next location!"
Rogelio M.,"Modesto, CA",10,52,3,2.0,1/12/2013,"The only good part about this place is the building, it has nice atmosphere and is very clean. The food is gross, no flavor, and overpriced. Service is below average."
Sean K.,"Modesto, CA",0,13,,4.0,4/6/2015,"My daughter and I are regulars here.  Staff is always helpful and friendly.  My daughter has a special beverage request, and it's never a problem for them to accommodate ( cherry pepsi with extra grenadine ).  Pizza is amazing, but honestly?  What really keeps me coming back is the beer.  The stout is a favorite, but the seasonals are all amazing."
Alyshia O.,"Stockton, CA",181,33,74,5.0,3/27/2013,I love carmen! I miss carmen :'( Best waitress ever! Chicken Parm and fried artichoke allday on mines!
Manny F.,"San Francisco, CA",1453,574,369,3.0,7/21/2010,"This place wasn't really what I was expecting. First off the WPA style Socialist themed murals seemed a little out of place in conservative Modesto. This is a chain brewpub but I'd rate both the beer and food better than Gordon Biersch, the only other chain brewpub I've been to.  I ordered the beer sample set and it was a pretty decent size. For the most part the beer choices were fairly typical for these places The only interesting choice was the Russian stout but there were a couple drinkable  beers in there. I also had the flat bread pizza with it and thought it was decent."
Walker S.,"San Diego, CA",13600,511,2167,3.0,6/1/2010,"Chain restaurant with focus on micro-brew beer, no Corona here.  The decor is beautiful.  Minus two stars for the unbelievable SLOW service.  Food is average, generous portions.  Maybe you should find someplace else to eat."
Omar J.,"Seaside, CA",68,184,157,4.0,8/16/2010,OMG- The Parmesan Encrusted Chicken!!! Is so good loved every bite. Just went again and finally had there deep dish pizza and i was in heaven  This place just keeps getting better. If you plan on drinking ask for Sean to make your drinks... And the dessert YUM YUM YUM
Shirley M.,"Santa Clara, CA",639,296,861,5.0,7/17/2012,"Nice waitresses, brings out food promptly, atmosphere is great, food average bar type of food... Thai chicken salad is yummy and low calories!"
Audrey H.,"Riverbank, CA",44,59,28,3.0,7/23/2013,"Even though I had no intentions of ever returning to this BJs, a friend of mine really wanted to eat here so I reluctantly agreed to join her.  All the staff I encountered was friendly and attentive.  Glad they improved because I really dig their avocado egg rolls! :)"
Edgar V.,"Turlock, CA",8,36,3,1.0,8/7/2010,"Okay here's an update to my last review.  This time my co-workers and I went there for lunch on a weekday.  One of our co-workers actually got there about 10 mins before we did to get a table for 10 of us.  We even took an extra long lunch just so we can enjoy ourselves.   The services was downright unacceptable.  We literally sat there for almost a good hour before our meals came out.  But here's the kicker, we were getting a plate of food almost ten minutes apart from the next plate to be served.  By the time all of us were completely served we had to rush back to work.   I will never ever go back to this place again."
S S.,"Modesto, CA",43,1,,1.0,2/5/2015,"Had a birthday here, have to ask for everything from plates to forks... the waiter was ok.  We are not the type to complain.  We are in the food business so I know whats  lazy and service is.  If this was an Audit day he would have have failed all through out....."
Kevin K.,"Middletown, PA",4,44,25,4.0,7/9/2013,"I love BJ's Brewhouse (if you've been to one, you've been to them all). I got the Mahi Mahi Rice dish and it was delicious. Nice, light meal, not heavy in any way. Great place with nice beer selection (their pear ale is awesome!). Highly recommended."
T. W.,"Manteca, CA",61,90,36,5.0,1/27/2013,Went with the In-Laws for the Beer and Dinner Pairing event. Had a great time. I would do it again.
Darcie N.,"Patterson, CA",9,116,9,5.0,9/4/2014,I've never had a bad meal here! Everything I've tried has been excellent!  The new pepperoni dip is out of this world yummy!! This is one of my favorite places to eat.  The wings are cooked just right. The chicken tortilla soup is a huge favorite of mine. The portion sizes are enough that you'll be bringing home leftovers.  Whenever I get the chance to come here I do.
Leslie L.,"Escalon, CA",0,14,,4.0,1/1/2014,"I guess this place can be a hit and miss on service from what I'm reading.  We have been 4 times and have lucked out? with all great servers.  The manager came over to us at our first visit and got us signed up for their free rewards club.  We like trying beer, so that aspect is a lot of fun.  The food is always good.  We did have one snafu with a meal gone missing, but they apologized and gave us a free dessert."
A D.,"Manteca, CA",4,15,4,4.0,10/17/2010,Great location.. good desserts and drinks.  Not so much for meal  !  Good place to chill  !!! .....
Thomas P.,"Lathrop, CA",41,240,22,4.0,3/25/2013,I loved the deep dish! My burger wasn't bad I like it! Drinks were great! My daughter didn't like her turkey burger she said it was no different than red robin! So the staff was actually pretty great so hats off to them!
Ann N.,"Parker, CO",1,36,,1.0,7/24/2012,"Sat in bar.  Waiters too busy to check on you.  First waiter told me to order a bottle of wine since they were half off on Tuesday's and he would recork it and let me take home!  I think that's against the law!  Asked for utensils, never got salsa, had to ask for refills continuously!  Manager needs to be fired."
