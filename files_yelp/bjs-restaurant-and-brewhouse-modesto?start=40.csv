Alberto J.,"Cicero, IL",21,10,,4.0,10/18/2017,"I honestly enjoy going to this place with friends. It's a nice comfortable place to just go, have some dinner and enjoy your time with friends and family. It can get a little crowded and loud at times but nothing too bad. The food is great and very reasonably priced. Although the food can sometimes take a while, the wait is certainly worth it. 10/10 recommend this place."
Armand A.,"Modesto, CA",1,27,,3.0,10/14/2017,"Everybody really likes BJ's in town, but I've never really been hyped up about it. In truth, I didn't come for the longest time because I believed that the hype would die eventually.  Once I caved, I first noticed that this place is always busy and people are happy and laughing when they are here. The food is good, but I'm always going to lean on the deep dish pizza- clearly a gem on the menu. The hype didn't make too much sense, seeming disproportionate, as the food was good but not to the extremity of what people say. So I thought. It took me till my 3rd visit to try the Pizooki, and then I understood.  Ultimately, the restaurant is always busy and the food is generally good. The dessert is the best part of the night, but that's just not something that one should regularly engage in. I would not recommend this restaurant, but wouldn't dissuade anybody who would like to try and am not averse to going again."
Steven L.,"Turlock, CA",230,32,26,1.0,2/13/2017,"Currently here at 10:17 pm. Came with a party of 10 at 7pm with reservations.  The food came out really late, no sauces came out until we were all finished with our food. They were out of chicken Parmesan so 2 of the people didn't even get food.  Appetizers came out after the meal.  And we still have not gotten our check..."
Zack H.,"Modesto, CA",0,3,,2.0,9/28/2017,I usually love this restaurant but I just had a the worst steak I ever had. I ordered a medium well steak and it came out really raw they also forgot one of my sides. The avocado egg rolls are insanely good though. Probably the only reason why I would ever come back after this terrible steak.
Night W.,"Modesto, CA",0,53,,4.0,10/6/2017,"Ill keep this one short, because every time I come by for a date or with friends its a good time. I suggest their house sodas. My only complaint is the menu is not really special, but still good food none the less. Always will return."
Dee C.,"Turlock, CA",0,7,8,1.0,12/4/2017,Me and my friends went here on December 3 at 9:00pm. Dominique was our waiter. I believe that was her name. She was very very nice however when she gave use silverware it was used. I'm talking like had stains on it and old food particles on it. I wanted to bring up to her but my brother said not to. We just asked for extra silverware and that seemed liked it had just been rinsed. I woke up ok the next day but brother and friend was very very sick next day. Not coming here again. I had fish and chips and seemed liked old pieces were double fried. Tasted horrible.
Lin C.,"Lancaster, NY",13,46,7,2.0,9/12/2017,Did not really enjoy my dinner here. Food was not good. Salads are way over dressed.  They just don't have their taste palettes down. Foods do not pair well with what they are made with at least for their cushion dishes. Maybe their normal American food dishes are good. Service was really bad. I waited 25 min for my drink.  All I got was a water and cucumber refresher. There's a long wait. They don't train their waiters well at all.  I was pretty disappointed by this place. But it's pretty busy. So there must be something good about it.
Daniel J.,"Modesto, CA",0,1,,4.0,9/26/2017,I wanted my buffilo wings to come faster. I wish we had a better water with lemon. It was good but the water with lemon ehhhhhh. I wish I had a pizookie
Eddie M.,"Stockton, CA",66,7,,2.0,9/22/2017,"I didn't have high expectations cause I was there at the 12:30 lunch crowd.  But you decide, It took 8 or so minutes to order water, drinks, and an appetizer.  The egg rolls were really good.   I ordered a chicken parmesan.  Roughly ten minutes later they explained they ran out of the pasta so I had to reorder,  I went with the a Maui taco thing.    They rushed my order but forgot Oscar's order.   Did I mention that our waitress was never available, we were helped by two other servers.  I'm off on the timing, all I know is we sat at 12:30 and received our food at 1:30.   After my margarita, which took ten minutes plus after ordering...I seemed to be the only one drinking as I checked other tables.  Why so long?  It took two servers to check on that drink.   When I finished the drink I then went with a beer, IPA, yumm!   oops, per the server the tap was out, I had to reorder that too.       I will end with the fish tacos, I asked for grill.  I founds bits of fish in the first one....surprise, the fish strip was in the second taco.  I was happy to see that.   I give the place two thumbs down.  We got out of there by 1:10.  Our official server finally gave us the bill, which we had to wait for as well."
Em K.,"Las Vegas, NV",212,1,,1.0,3/13/2017,This place sucks !!!! Every time I come here they get everything wrong and my food always comes out cold .... and it takes forever to get your food  .... hate this place
Chet M.,"Riverbank, CA",12,12,,1.0,12/21/2016,"We were told our soup is still frozen so we were asked if we wanted something else.  I said I'll have a salad.  My salad came and I was given a bottle of balsamic vinegar to go with it.  Later I was brought yet another bottle of vinegar to have with my salad.  By the time I am done with my salad, they brought me olive oil.  I didn't know that I was to make my own dressing. I ordered the Holiday Rib-eye steak, medium rare and double on the asparagus since I don't want mashed potato. My steak was almost well done and I got mashed potato.  I told the server who brought my steak out what I ordered and he said no problem, he will get another order of asparagus.  Never got the order of asparagus. All in all... the services was very lacking tonight.  Will stay clear of this place for awhile. Will see how the rest of the night goes."
Ricardo R.,"Ceres, CA",131,3,,1.0,8/27/2017,"So we ordered take out online, showed up 20 minutes later and what do you know they're closed! I guess they were having some kind of plumbing issues but man we literally wasted gas and our time coming here. The website should've alerted us that they were closed!"
Junior C.,"San Jose, CA",17,1,,1.0,11/14/2017,"For the past 2 years all i hear about is how the day time servers jip the food runners on tips because the management doesn't even want to deal with the complaints. So sad and pathetic. The daytime servers are rude anyways I come in every Sunday and its so easy to hear all the side talk about how everyone is being jipped and its so sad because the food runners are so much more nicer than the servers sometimes. If you're one of those servers and you KNOW who you are. Shame on you. Other than that, the napkins are cool."
Kelly L.,"Modesto, CA",61,5,,1.0,7/2/2017,If you like hot food AVOID THIS PLACE! We have came here time and time again trying to let them redeem their selfs but every time they fail us. We brought our kids for brunch and my feel felt as if it came from the refrigerator. My husband bacon was not cooked. This used to be a great place to eat. We will definitely NOT be coming back!!!!!!!
Paul E.,"Manteca, CA",16,9,,1.0,4/18/2017,"So, did online checkin...seating for 1. A couple that arrived after me that definitely didn't check in online either, got sat for 2 before I did.  I ask the hostess how that makes any sense, she proceeds to stumble over words, then tells me she thinks they got sat first because they got a table and I'd probably want a booth.  I can't imagine what she must have meant because she points to them as they're in the process of sitting down at a booth.   Then she apologizes and says I'd be seated right away, and I'm sat at a booth that has been empty since I got here.   I keep coming back because the food is often good, but the staff has an aura of ""I don't really care about anything but I'll give you an attempt at a half smile"" pretty much everytime I come in."
Patti H.,"Modesto, CA",0,1,,4.0,8/28/2017,Service was great. The food was not as good as always. The calamari appetizer was greasy. The sweet potato fries were cold in middle. We always enjoy going here. Maybe this was just a busier night. We also should have brought it to the servers attention.  Over all we enjoy coming here. We will be back. Pazookis great.
David W.,"San Clemente, CA",0,6,,1.0,11/9/2017,"I was visiting Modesto a couple of weeks ago and went to BJ's because I eat there often in Orange County, where I live. Normally BJ's is great, but this particular one has some serious staffing problems. The server barely paid attention to our table. My drink came in a glass that was dirty. I asked to add bacon to my burger and they didn't. While we were eating, the manager (I didn't get her name but she was below average height and died blonde hair), was actually yelling at one of the customer right in front of everyone. I was absolutely shocked that a manager would behave this way. I will continue to go to BJ's but just not this particular one."
Marcos B.,"Martinez, CA",0,60,,1.0,10/31/2016,"I've never had a server introduce themselves while walking from behind me and seeming impatient before even getting to the table. I've also never had a server take the check from me before I even had the chance to look at it, return it and tell me to sign it before taking it again.  I visit this BJ's when I'm in the Modesto area, and always have a great time with the employees here without even knowing them, including today with one exception. Cheers, Lisa L. I hope you can be retrained soon as the work ethic I unfortunately had to endure for the short time we were there today was atrocious."
Adam K.,"Manteca, CA",64,27,1,1.0,6/30/2017,Came in with the family. Ordered a beer. 20 minutes later still had not come. Ordered an appetizer at the same time and that came without plates or utensils so I assume we were supposed to eat like animals? Service at this location has really gone down hill. Sad.
Tuan N.,"Stockton, CA",58,32,25,5.0,8/19/2017,Came here to catch with with some friends. Service is pretty good . Price is decent . Food and beer is good! Highly recommend anyone to come enjoy dinner here or just for a drink
