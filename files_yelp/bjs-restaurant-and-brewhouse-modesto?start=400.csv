Jeff W.,"Modesto, CA",0,20,,5.0,9/5/2011,"Ordered the full rack of ribs. The ribs are comparable to Tony Roma's, which is saying a lot. The baked potato was the size of a football. Best meal I have had since moving to modesto."
Ron S.,"Tracy, CA",72,331,289,2.0,7/13/2010,"Sweet another chain resturant, nice wide open dining area but serving the same old ""chain"" style food, burgers, fries ect.  I got the burger melt, I ordered it medium  it came well done, figures!! Very bland meat nothing special on sourdough bread with a tasteless 1000 island spread, but to come and just use the bar is a great place to check out, but if you want to eat maybe look at other options."
Leng P.,"Salida, CA",10,3,,2.0,7/7/2014,"It never occurred to me to Yelp the reviews of this place which probably would've saved me some genuine confusion and second guessing of my ability to identify my leafy greens. About a month or so ago, I was excited to learn that they were offering a kale and brussels sprout salad (Usually kale is used as a serving bed or garnish). What I got was an arugula/brussells sprouts salad. I was told by the waitress that her manager told her the arugula was indeed kale. I replied that I know what kale is (it is quite possibly one of my favorite food) but I also enjoy arugula and as to not waste food, I wasn't interested in sending it back but I thought I should point out the difference. The manager did not concede on the kale front but offered to remake my dish because he wasn't satisfied with the way the chicken looked (which I thought was fine). Magically, when the salad reappeared, it was indeed a kale/sprout salad. The waitress explained that they ""found"" the kale.BJ establishment; You are a restaurant. Food is your business. You sell it to customers. Know what you are serving. Serve it well."
Yatzeny C.,"Modesto, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/11/2015,Poor service!! It took way too long to get our food and when we finally got it we waited again to get our silver wear after asking two different waitresses. One of the children waited an extra 20 mins to get his meal because they forgot to put the order in. Definitely not a good experience.
Roxy L.,"Stockton, CA",51,258,232,2.0,2/11/2012,"Two stars because of the wait. We were told 30  to 45 mins  but we waited 70 mins and still no table!  Luckily a table in the bar area opened. My dinner buddy and i rushed to the opening. We ordered a couple beers while deciding what to order. Carmen, our waitress, forgot to put in our beer orders twice. We finally ordered...and eventually our beers arrived. Nice ceasar salad, decent tomato bisque. I really like the bisque at Nordtroms and Elephant Bars alot better. I ordered the ""new"" portabello mushroon pizza. It was so new my friend didnt even have it listed in her menu. Our dinners and second round of refreshments came eventually. Great food, too long of a wait. Oh and me and my buddy didnt get the memo that if your a female under 50 and want to go to BJ's you must dress like a total prostitute even if your not on a date. 6  inch stilettos seem to be a must"
Diego H.,"Riverbank, CA",31,36,7,4.0,8/20/2010,"BJ's restaurant has not disappointed us yet. The restaurant staff is always attentive and polite. The food quality is consistently great. The menu items are never over-seasoned and offer just enough flavor, very well balanced American menu. Their selection of beers is excellent and if one is not in the mood for beer, definitely try their ice-cold rootbeer. We love the chicken pot stickers."
Jessica R.,"Modesto, CA",44,27,2,3.0,4/11/2013,"BJ's food is tasty but it isn't anything to write home about. I like the lively atmosphere and that there are a plethora of televisions. If it is super busy, which is pretty normal for the weekend, try to snag a table in the bar area."
Neill H.,"Lakewood, CA",2,6,,2.0,1/8/2012,"I recently came to this Bj Restaurant and we had a terrible waitress and food experience. I obviously knew it'd take time for the food to cook but we waited nearly 30-40 minutes for the 5 of us to get our food. I've come to visit Merced and originally live in Inglewood and have had a much better, quicker, tastier food back home. My aunt n cousin got the Rib Eye Stake really dry and my cousin got a Calzone that was puny and demeaning to what the description said. I give it 2 stars cause my wings were delicious and drinks were good too. But the quality of the rest of my cousins family food lacked greatly."
Nic R.,"Tracy, CA",19,53,,4.0,3/7/2011,"I had the specialty calzone.  It was good, but it was a little dry because there was a lot more dough than contents in it.  Didn't stop it from being enjoyable though. My date had a salad which looked like it was very good as well. I'd return again."
Amanda H.,"Modesto, CA",0,29,,2.0,3/25/2012,"Seating takes a long time and so does the food. The noise level is a little much for me because it's always packed and it's a big place (I mean, I understand that part is out of their hands but thought I would mention it for your sakes).  I have been there 3 times by chance. The first time, i had pizza. It was blazze. I love the decorations and it's a very clean place. The second time, I had a delicious peach daiquiri, fantastic artichoke spinach dip, and a positively addicting avocado roll.  The third time, I had a really bad shrimp scampi pasta. It didn't taste of garlic at all and was dry and flavorless. 2 mediocre at best meals and 2 fantastic appetizers. I have 10 people in my family and we all went together. No one liked it. I would come back just for the avocado rolls and the spinach artichoke dip."
Marta C.,"Fremont, CA",33,53,3,3.0,1/9/2009,"I was so excited to learn that Modesto has a BJ's! I have always been a fan of their beer and pazookies (not together of course).  The staff is all very nice, but sometimes I get the feeling they are a bit forgetful.  A few weeks ago was my first time here, and while my mother and I were waiting to be seated we had a drink at the bar. The hostess told us our wait would be 45 minutes. An hour later I asked her if our table would be ready soon, as it was apparent that there were a few empty tables in the place. She quickly apologized as she realized that she had forgot to call us when our table was ready. We had originally gone there with the intent of lunch, but now the lunchtime special was over due to our extra wait. We explained this to our waitress and she kindly obliged us with the lunch specials!  I just returned home from my second experience with the restaurant. Pazookies were so good! They even gave my friend a birthday candle for the celebration! Again, little things were forgotten, like the specially requested lemon and extra set of utensils. No biggie though, the yummy desserts made up for it!"
kevin b.,"Tracy, CA",80,113,9,4.0,12/10/2010,I love this restaurant and especially this location.  Not all locations have the same level of service and food quality.  Most locations have the same quality of beer which is very good. You can't beat the lunch specials.
Bob B.,"Ballico, CA",0,25,,2.0,5/20/2014,"For a restaurant that seems to be growing, appears popular, and has a neat facility...it basically sucks.  I give it two stars because the staff is really great at the bar and at tables.  But wow....I couldn't believe how mediocre the food is.  And their own beer reminds me of something some dude made in his garage with beginners home brewing equipment (not that home brew is always bad, after all, that's how places like Sierra Nevada got their start, but its just bad). Or made by one of the big three, attempting to trick us into believing its a micro.  I give them a star for the fact that they serve beer from other companies and a star for the servers.  But the food is what's its all about and they fall way short."
Steven Z.,"Modesto, CA",177,113,23,4.0,1/11/2011,This place is exactly what you'd expect when you look at it from the outside. A nice clean and probably tasty brewhouse and grill. There is such a diverse menu selection as well as their brew it's almost impossible to come back and get the same thing over again....unless you're just one of those people. I thought I was until I came here but with so much to look forward to on the menu its tough. Try the Deep Dish Pizza's and a Pizookie for desert.
David S.,"Modesto, CA",0,23,,1.0,12/6/2011,"Another chain restaurant with scripted servers and bland food.  I've been here four times and I have never been satisfied.  I had a burger and asked for medium and was given a medium well.  The beef had little flavor.  I had a salad and again, it lacked any flavor.  The last time I went was for a family birthday dinner.  I ordered off the appetizer menu and it was the most satisfied I have been there.  I don't recommend this place for food at all.  It's noisy and the servers don't have any personality."
Anne B.,"Merced, CA",286,325,7,2.0,11/25/2011,"Terrible.  We came here for lunch with some colleagues and arrived well before noon.  Interestingly, it took nearly an hour for our party to get their order, even though we had sat at the bar in an attempt to expedite things.  Food came out in no particular order, with soups and salads spaced twenty minutes apart.  We had left with plenty of time to spare, but ended up needing to rush out to get back to work in time.  No bueno!"
Nelson M.,"Modesto, CA",94,77,41,4.0,7/27/2013,Sometimes I wounded about the service but food is good.
Sargon K.,"Manteca, CA",43,49,5,4.0,8/30/2012,"I've been to BJ's a handful of times, i usually just get their burgers, nothing else, the menu is too long, the beer selection is great, the service has always been good at the place as well. I would recommend this place, great for kids too because the environment is already loud."
Colleen W.,"Modesto, CA",1,15,17,4.0,7/9/2013,"Food was great, the wait is incredibly long on a weekend night."
Valeria S.,"Turlock, CA",153,9,7,2.0,3/5/2014,"First.time going and probably last. Worst service,  but servers were nice..  drinks weren't that great either, overpriced."
