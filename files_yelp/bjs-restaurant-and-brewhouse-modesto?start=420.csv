Dan L.,"Modesto, CA",17,20,10,1.0,10/12/2013,I can't give any more than one star due to the fact we didn't even get any food. I ordered online..... and after trying to figure out what the family wants for 20 minutes we finally placed or order.... so total wasted time so far is 30 minutes. I hey a message on their website that says please call with you're order number. I call and the girl days Oh you'll have to talk to a manager. I wait another 10 minutes on the phone and finally someone picks up only to hang up on me. I'm now furious!! I call back and the girl days oh I'm sorry but good news is we found you're order. I said well that's good but I didn't order any of that and she says well I can take your order then. I'm already 45 minutes in to this order so I might as well just give her my order and call it good. I bring up my order on my tablet again and wouldn't you know it. It went back to the main screen on their website and poooof.... my order was gone....GGGGGRRRRRR. I GOTTA START OVER AGAIN. This has already taken an hour and they don't give a crap. Im done. 1 Star.... GOODBYE!!
Christy B.,"Patterson, CA",10,52,7,4.0,9/6/2012,"My son loves this place... but I think its the atmosphere more so than the food that keeps him asking to go back! Personally - I think it's an ok place to stop for a quick meal. I don't really care for their pizzas, I find them pretty dry, but like I said - my son thinks they're great. I did have the miso salmon (Cheesecake factory fav) and quite enjoyed it. Cooked well, very tasty. Again, not fine dining by any means - but a fun place to go with friends & family."
Chris B.,"Modesto, CA",13,41,19,1.0,8/5/2011,I recently dropped in for a going away party for a coworker and experienced some of the worst service of my life. Our party consisted of about 30 people and for some reason they chose to assign only two waitresses to take our orders (which for some reason took nearly an hour). After the orders were taken half of our party received there entrees while it took another 10-15 minutes for the rest of us to be served. One poor guy didn't receive his food until the rest of us were done eating. And as an additional slap in the face it took them over 45 minutes to bring us our checks. They also didn't even give the guy a discount for messing up his order and bringing it out late. Like I said earlier... worst service of my life.
Natasha A.,"Colorado Springs, CO",3,37,3,1.0,7/11/2011,"Horrible customer service! Our server did not serve my boyfriend what he ordered, she had an attitude and then I heard her talking about me to her co workers..mind you I have no clue who she was. My recommendation is they need to start hiring more mature servers or business will be lost. They lost mine and whenever someone asks to go there, I tell em what my last experience was like here and we end up going somewhere better."
Nely L.,"San Ramon, CA",54,22,10,4.0,8/21/2010,"This place is okay when it's NOT busy. Otherwise, you'll probably wait a very long time for your food. One time I went here for my little cousin's 8th grade graduation dinner and EVERYONE got their food but my uncle. It was a party of 7. By the time my uncle got his food, everyone had already finished!  It's really a hit and miss with this location. You either get prompt service or slow service. Luckily, on Thursday night, it was decent service. We had their beer which is always good and their chicken wings which was also VERY GOOD. My fiance got his free birthday pizookie which is freshly made."
Margaret R.,"Merced, CA",34,10,6,2.0,2/19/2014,"I was there for dinner, 4 of us total 4/17/14. The food was just about as plain and nondescript as you could get.  I don't see a reason to go back for a meal.  Although we did order a pazookie to share and that was delicious!!!"
Nancy S.,"Roseville, CA",12,28,,2.0,2/19/2014,"Sitting here right now eating my mediocre salad.  I had complained directly to the manager in the past regarding their solicitous servers, which they seem to have handled, but the noise level, the music in particular, is sooo loud, I just want to finish my lunch and get out of here.  I agree with so many of the other posters.  BJ's is average at best.  They should try to make the dining experience a little more pleasant."
Marcos S.,"Fresno, CA",0,42,8,3.0,5/31/2014,The pizza is good but the service is hit and miss. You could probably toss a coin to see if your service will suck. Drinks are hit and miss too. Once my wife got a drink that was just vodka. It would have been cool if she were a kid at a club but not so nice when your trying to enjoy a drink with your meal.
Tornado J.,"Turlock, CA",2,50,,4.0,3/1/2010,3 words say it all. Parmesan Encrusted Chicken Outrageously good. Will have me coming back often.
Emily E.,"Modesto, CA",9,20,70,3.0,8/19/2012,Well the food is good but I've always had sucky service. Maybe they were just having a bad day...every time I came. Three stars for the avocado rolls and pazookie.
Paige L.,"Modesto, CA",79,37,4,4.0,11/14/2011,"Convenient location next to the mall, lots of seating and a big bar. TVs everywhere makes it a nice place to watch sports if you don't feel like going to a carpeted sports bar type place. Pretty versatile menu, and everything on it is really good. Love the avocado egg rolls here, and try to save room for a pizookie for dessert. It gets a little busy and loud in here, especially on game nights."
Andrea S.,"Modesto, CA",699,10,8,4.0,8/4/2012,"One of my favorite spots to grab a beer and bite to eat, a bit pricey but the food makes it worth it."
Nichole D.,"Manteca, CA",7,7,,1.0,2/12/2012,Horrible service!!!!! waited forever had a waitress with an attitude problem. Idk why people go to this place. If i could give 0 stars i would!
Melissa S.,"Riverbank, CA",5,105,4,2.0,9/8/2011,"I have eaten here a couple times and have yet to be impressed. The food is nothing special. I have tried the pizza, stuffed potato and several other dishes. The service has been fine, but I feel the price for the food doesn't match up with the quality."
Jay A.,"Modesto, CA",297,5,46,1.0,8/30/2012,"Been there 3 times and everytime i got there is a huge line, plus the staff is just overworked and they tend to forget they have paying customers waiting to be seated"
Ed X.,"Merced, CA",7,56,16,4.0,8/25/2012,"Good food. Wish the server would pull her hair out of the food though. The only one walking around with a pony tail IN FRONT of her, just whisking the food...."
Mihir M.,"Fremont, CA",307,821,493,4.0,5/31/2012,"Great service from Tyson at the bar late night. I had a personal size vegetarian pizza once happy hour started - 1/2 off. I also got their house made sodas, but instead of trying one, I got as many shots of the 4 they have (root bear, orange cream soda, cream soda, & black cherry) for the same price as one soda. This is a lively place."
Erica A.,"Roseville, CA",42,352,1,2.0,2/9/2009,"I doubt BJ's needs one more bad review, but I still can't resist. I'm not a huge fan of chains, so maybe that's why I don't love BJ's. I can't stand a place that has a phone book for a menu. I like choices as much as the next person, but I also like quality. That's what BJ's lacks in my opinion. Any restaurant can have a surplus of go-to menu items. Our waiter wasn't the greatest either, and that set the tone for the meal. We had to ask several times for the basics, uhhhh silverware! How the eff am I supposed to eat a baked potato??!!? Also, our beers sat empty for awhile, again we had to ask 2 different people. Come one, any server knows if you keep the drinks flowing your tip will be decent. All in all, I think BJ's is good for beer and maybe apps. Nothing more."
Noelle M.,"San Francisco, CA",212,407,163,2.0,1/4/2009,"I feel kinda guilty updating with a 2 but last night I had such a bad experience. I was gone for my birthday (disneyland, woo!) and so when I came back I wanted to celebrate my day with my mom and dad. After dinner at home I knew the perfect ending would be a pizookie and some drinks from BJs-mhhhhh! So I call ahead, which is a great option, and they tell me it'll be an hour and 40mins- perfect because my dad was still watching the game. We get in, I let the greeter know my name and everything and she says one moment....5minutes go buy and I check on everything, I guess she put me in as someone else and forgot about me-at this point she seats us right away-kinda annoying, but it was quick in the end. So we sit, I order a mojito and a 1/2pb 1/2chocolate chunk pizookie to share- telling them we're here to celebrate my birthday with a delish dessert. The mojito comes out and it is HORRIBLE-gag- I think the soda was flat or something but it was so sweet I could hardly drink it. Then 15 minutes goes buy and we still don't have dessert! I was shocked- finally almost 20 minutes after ordering my pizookie comes...sans candle! WTF! Okay, thanks for acknowledging my day...ugh. So this AM I called BJs up and asked if they did anything for birthdays- I was informed they give out a free birthday pizookie and put a candle on it...hm...problem...cus I had no candle and mine wasn't free! She asked if I'd like to talk to a manager so I did and the manager let me know she'd put a $5 courtesy card in her manager box for next time I come in- so I guess it all ended up okay, but last night really just SUCKED! Makes me not want to come in again."
Lawrence L.,"Los Banos, CA",0,64,5,2.0,2/4/2013,"$12 for a personal size pizza? For that price I thought I was going to get something amazing.......no, it tasted EXACTLY like a Pizza Hut personal pan pizza. Never again."
