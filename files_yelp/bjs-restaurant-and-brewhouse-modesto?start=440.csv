Teresa M.,"San Jose, CA",31,137,16,1.0,12/16/2010,"So I'm from San Jose, and I usually go to BJ's at Oakridge mall, but since I was visiting my cousin out there, we decided to go.  I was thrilled to see that there was actually a BJ's here, but I had no idea what I was getting in to.  I ordered the chicken fried steak because I wanted to try something new.  Man o man, I was slapped back to planet earth.  The steak was soggy with oil, and it tasted like burnt oil.  I told the waitress that it tasted awful, but instead of offering to replace it she said, ""well, all our fried food is fried in the same oil"".  Ha!  That's nasty.  I mean, I know oil is used quite a few times in restaurants, but damn!  Was it  months old?  It seriously tasted super  BURNT!  The table behind us also had problems with their macaroni and cheese which also wasn't replaced.  I told the waitress that I couldn't eat it cause it was so nasty, and ordered a cold sandwich with sourdough bread.  Usually in San Jose, the sandwiches (even though they're cold) come with warm buttery sourdough bread, but this one was cold as heck.  It tasted as if it was pulled straight out the freezer.  NASTY!  The hostess was also rude.  This girl stood there mean mugging us, and I asked, ""are we suppose to follow you?"" and she nodded with a huge attitude.  Man, how sad that this place is taking up valuable real estate on this mall's parking lot.  I'll just stick to SJ's BJ's which is the BEST!"
T D.,"Tracy, CA",0,50,,5.0,3/7/2012,"I have had some bad experiences with BJs service in the past (not this location) Yesterday they were at the top of their game. They brought the kids smiley fries (appetizers to keep your kids quiet) in about 5 minutes. They had my beer, my wife's iced tea and the kids milk on the table in about the same amount of time. The pizza was excellent, they allowed a substitution on a coupon we had which said ""no substitutions"" and the waiter came by often to check on us. Perfect service, great food, happy customer."
Dee W.,"Palo Alto, CA",45,76,,1.0,11/19/2008,"Service is a bit lacking.. unexperienced servers.  Came in on a Tuesday night.. party of 2.. got sat at a dirty table. Was told they didnt have what we wanted after we ordered. about 15 mins later.  When we finally did get our food.. a good half an hour later.. it was cold and soggy. Besides letting our food sit.. which was a no-no.. they messed up on a simple order. Sandwich with just the patty and lettuce.  Our server cant even be called unattentive.. she was pretty much MIA and liked to play the blame game.  'omg.. im sorry the kitchen didnt tell me until blah blah..  'i cant believe they sat you at a dirty table blah blah'  'oh it was suppose to be lettuce only more blah blah.' -Servers should know to check their tables food before running it. And before leaving to bitch at the hostess..  the problem couldve been fixed. The whole night we kept hearing I'll speak to the manager about this & that, yet we never saw a manager in sight. The whole restaurant was dead so there was really no excuse.. especially for having our food sit.  Will I go back? Probably.. when I'm desperate for food and nothing else is open. It is Modesto.  Curbside service.. doesnt exist.  was told to 'come inside and get your food.'  took 35 mins for one order.. which they messed up on.  the order was placed online so the instructions were pretty specific."
Pete S.,"Modesto, CA",9,89,5,2.0,8/6/2011,"While writting this review, I thought I'd take a look at what other reviewers had to say... seems they're experience was generally the same as mine, BAD SERVICE! I've come here several times since they opened. Every time the same service at the bar, SLOW! I think it's excepted that when someone sits at the bar, they're thirsty and some effort should be placed on giving the new customer a good first impression by getting a drink in their hand in a reasonable length of time. I've been here when they're busy and not, no difference. Plan on waiting 10-15 minutes for your first beer. Last visit, it took 10 minutes to take my order at the bar and another 10 minutes to get my ""on tap"" beer. The bar was half full and the bartender, after taking my order, went back to talk/flirt with the guys she was talking with when I sat down.     It's too bad the service is so bad here, the food is a little above average and the beer selection is OK. They also have a good selection of Belgian beers in the bottle, nice!     Sorry guys, the cons outweigh the pros. I'll go elsewhere."
T I.,"Modesto, CA",0,12,,1.0,4/25/2014,"The food was bad, I ordered a meal I have enjoyed in the past and I was disappointed . We were passed over for service many times, it was 15 min before our drink order was taken. The drinks that came were not what we ordered, when our drinks did come, the beer my husband ordered was very, very flat. We were so disappointed, we used to enjoy eating at BJ's, this is the 3rd time we have been disappointed by service. We won't be back."
Jenna L.,"Manteca, CA",3,35,3,4.0,6/2/2011,"Good to go at lunch. Dinner is SLAMMED packed! Food is awesome every time, the waiting service is on the OK side... nothing to rave about."
Karen G.,"Turlock, CA",307,611,7,3.0,9/22/2008,"It is nearly impossible to get into a new restaurant in Modesto.  By that I mean horrendous wait times and the crowds.  That being said, I finally decided to check out BJ's.   First impression, very open atmosphere with a plethora of tv's.  The bar appeared quite long and was absolutely packed.  Decor is nothing fancy, but it appears very neat and tidy.   There was about a 20 minute wait, which isn't too bad considering it is a new restaurant. The hostess and the waitress were both really sweet and friendly which is always a plus.  The menu was fairly expansive, although definitely nowhere near the selection of Cheesecake Factory.  The only reason I bring up the comparison is that I heard several people say how BJ's had the largest menu they had ever seen.   I settled on the turkey burger with all white meat.  The burger was so thin and the meat was so tightly compact it appeared to be a processed turkey burger.  The burger was grilled and all I could taste was the blackened grill marks on the meat.  Hello carcinogens!  I did have a yummy raspberry lemon drop (delish) which made up for my sad little burger.   I would not rule BJ's out.  I would like to come back and try the pizza which they are supposedly known for.  Hopefully the food will be better next time!  Three stars for yummy cocktails and friendly service.  ;)"
Reg E.,Bay Area,45,81,9,2.0,12/24/2010,"Bjs is pretty much your average chain restaurant that serve your basic appetizers, burgers, salads, pastas and some other random shit.  The ambiance is the same as any other-they all look alike.  It's the service that sets them apart. I came here on a late Monday night and it was pretty empty.  The hostess tried to seat us in this lonely dark corner away from the few people that were in the restaurant.  Well, this area was too dark for my little one so I asked to be moved.  I pointed to a booth in the middle part of the  restaurant where life was actually taking place and she replied with, ""that section is closed off... there's no server"".  As she was finishing up her sentence I see this guy seat a couple at the table I wanted to sit at?!!? WTF?? I looked at her and she said, ""oh, he's going to be serving them.""  That shit made no sense to me... I was still standing there waiting for her to seat us somewhere and she points to a table allllll the way on the other side- another lonely corner- but I agreed to it because there was more lighting. We were greeted almost immediately by a bubbly waiter who was extremely nice and friendly.  He offered us a drink and waited patiently at the table while we sat and tried to decide.  We took a while and I was thinking how awkward it must have been for him, but he stood there and didn't make us feel rushed so that's a plus. We ordered: 1.) Crisp potato skin platter ($8.95)- this was ok.  It tastes like baked potato topped with pieces of bacon, cheese, and chives.  It was served with a side of sour cream and ranch. 2.) CA burger ($9.95)- avocado, green chiles, pepper jack on sourdough bread.  BF ordered his burger rare and added a side wedge salad for an extra $2.95.  Pretty simple salad with tomatoes, ranch and bacon bits.   3.) Ahi poki ($8.75)- ahi, onions, avocado with wonton chips.  This one was alright.  They put too many chips (which i didn't care for) and not enough tuna. 4.) Sweet pig pizza SM (11.95)- pineapple, tomatoes, ham. 5.) Gourmet Mac & cheese (3.95)- pasta with cheese baked with bread crumbs or something.  My daughter ordered this and liked it.  I didn't try it. 6.) Classic burger ($8.95)- thousand island dressing, toasted bun, meat. 7.) Pazookie($5.95)- chocolate chip cookie topped with vanilla bean ice cream. Ehhhh.. The cookie tasted undercooked. Anyway, the food is pretty basic, theres really nothing special about them, and my experience here sucked because of it: 1.) My BFs CA burger came out cooked the way he asked but it was burnt on the outside.  It tasted like they didn't clean the grill before they slapped on a new patty.  This didn't fly with him so he pushed it to the side.  The waiter noticed this and asked if everything was ok.  We told him what was wrong with it and he offered to make another.  We were afraid it'd come out the same but he assured us the grill was just cleaned. 2.) My BF ordered the classic burger in replacement of his burnt CA burger.  You can tell the grill was cleaned but his meat was freaking cooked well-done.  Come on, server... He ordered it blue the first time around.  He ended up passing on this one too because the meat was cooked too much for him to enjoy it. 3.) They brought out a kids Mac for my daughter when she had asked for the mini gourmet Mac.  They changed it without problem but by the time it came out we were almost done with our food. 4.) Their pizza is supposed to be really good here but mine came out freaking cold with an extremely soggy crust.  It really tasted like it was sitting out before they decided to bring it to me.  I didn't enjoy this dish at all and with all that was going on with my daughters gourmet Mac, my BFs burnt patty, and then overcooked burger... I didn't even want to bother about my pizza.   This dining experience was a huge disappointment and I really felt like I wasted my money because everything that came out was crap after crap.  I don't get it?!?! I give this place two stars because our server was patient with us and he did not express any rudeness or discontent with our complaints. ***I should have read the yelps before I suggested BJs but we were doing some shopping at the mall and this place is at a damn prime location.  We also finished up pretty late and BJs is open til 12am so it worked.  Thank goodness for us we didn't have a rude server because that along with the shit food they sent out would've sent me over the top for sure!!!!!"
JOE M.,"Hayward, CA",58,66,90,2.0,2/12/2009,"The food - not all that great!  How hard is it to mess up pizza and fish and chips? Our server - really slow and didn't even attemt to offer us more glasses of beer. The only good thing was that the beer was damn good, the tv had some good stuff on and the dessert was decent.  Not a place I'd go back to unless I was just looking to drink a good glass of beer - microwaved food could taste better than what I was served!"
Coleen L.,"Lincoln, CA",0,49,3,1.0,1/8/2011,"You'll pay way too much for mediocre at best. Feels like a food chain - tastes like a food chain. PLUS waiting over an hour for a table only to be whisked in and whisked out was a bummer!  That's happened 3x...yes, we've tried...  Noisy-Noisy-NOISY, poor service, meh food: not worth it. Bye-bye"
Christine C.,"Ripon, CA",0,13,,1.0,9/9/2011,This is the worst BJ's location I have ever been to. The service here is ALWAYS terrible. Once I sat for 15 minutes while it was dead and no one even came to ask for my drink order. I stared at every waiter that walked by hoping that someone would come over. No one ever did. The hostesses are always rude. You can get much better food and service and at a better price at other restaurants. Don't waste your time. Go to Johnny Carino's if you're in the area.
Jenn F.,"Livermore, CA",11,78,,3.0,11/17/2008,"I remember the days when BJ's was actually a small college hangout in San Diego. We'd go for the deep dish pizzas and the pizookies-- it was actually the only place really open after 9pm in La Jolla. Now, it's just a big ol' chain, and it doesn't even look like it used to. :(  Anyway, we got there after shopping, and wanted to check it out. 35 minute wait at 2PM on a Saturday... wtf? So, the hostess told us that we could skip the wait and grab a table in the bar area. I almost lunged for the only empty table. I got the turkey cobb, my friend got the chicken something. Both sandwiches were okay, fries were okay, strawberry lemonade was too sweet. Best thing about the meal? The wheat rolls they gave us in the beginning."
Kandace H.,"East Bay, CA",0,35,,4.0,6/11/2012,"So I came here with a few friends during a lunch break from our shopping expedition and I would say it was a pretty decent experience. We went in during lunchtime and it was pretty busy but we got seated right away. We ordered the avocado egg rolls, shrimp tacos, sweet pig deep-dish pizza, BBQ chicken chopped salad, and a chocolate chunk pizookie. We only had to wait around 15-20 minutes for our food to get to the table which was pretty decent timing considering how many people were there on a Friday afternoon. Our waitress was friendly but never checked up on us after we got our food. All in all it was pretty good."
Kori H.,"Vallejo, CA",239,14,1,5.0,12/27/2010,Can't resist the avocado egg rolls and shrimp lettuce wraps. Mmm.
James S.,"Modesto, CA",16,27,30,3.0,9/6/2009,"Very nice atmosphere. Booths have been a little messy when we are seated (food on seat/bench, table not wiped down well enough). Extensive menu, great beers, pretty good food. Reservations have not worked out more than once - lost or refused.  Call ahead, and if they say they don't take reservations, call back and the next person will take it."
Kristin P.,"Riverbank, CA",202,194,52,4.0,8/19/2008,"SO I finally tried BJ's after my friend Kelly has been talking it up since it opened. I went on my lunch break from work with a co worker, so I unfortunately wasn't able to try the beer...which sucks since I'm a big fan of beer! The service was pretty prompt after we sat down...a bit too promp because we had no sooner opened our menu, and our waiter was ready to take out order so we told him to come back...one minute later...um, we aren't ready. Geez, can you give us a minute we thought. SO, when we were finally ready, he didn't come back for like ten minutes! But, I'm not really writing to complain about him, I'm just telling you what happened. He was actually a very good server for the most part, our waters were filled regularly, he suggested the lunch portion of what we were ordering because we would get more food and it would be cheaper. One more thing he did do though was bring us the wrong check...when I saw the coffee on the bill, I knew it belonged to the group of old ladies behind us...(since its a universal fact that old people will drink coffee even if its 100 degree outside). And when we finally got the right check, it took him about ten minutes to get back to us with the change! Anyway, we both ordered the California Chicken Sandwich, which came with Avocado (SOLD!), grilled chicken, chipotle mayo, grilled peppers, and pepper jack cheese. With the lunch portion it came with a half sandwich, wedge cut fries, and a salad wedge. Neither my co-worker nor I like blue cheese so we were not too happy when the salad arrived covered in blue cheese crumbles...we should have asked. Oh well, we ate it anyway and surprisingly, I thought it was really good anyway. It was covered with a really yummy white garlic dressing, and I just picked around the cheese crumbles. The sandwich came on a garic-ey grilled sourdough which I could have eaten alone, it was so good! CO worker raved about it. The sandwich itself though was a bit soggy due to too much chipotle mayo so In the future I;d request lite or none at all. Last but not least, the fries were great too! And all in all, the portion was very adequate. And it was about $7 for all of it! I can't wait to go back and try the beer when I'm not on the clock!  And as for the waiter, he was really pleasant, and I could tell he meant well, all his minor mistakes aside."
Weston W.,"Hilmar, CA",27,129,59,3.0,3/4/2009,"A welcome addition to Modesto. Their burgers and pizza are easily one of the best in Modesto for the price and style. The BJ's favorite is my favorite pizza and be sure to try the Santa Fe egg rolls. There can be a bit of a wait during peak lunch traffic but if you've got a party of even number you seem to get seated faster... no idea why, but I've eaten here quite a bit and have watched it happen numerous times. Beer selection is good and while a bit pricey everything I've tried was good."
Nancy F.,"Mountain House, CA",27,219,257,4.0,10/28/2010,OMG the pizookie is the best get it first forget about dinner. On your birthday you can get a free one!
Julia N.,"Elk Grove, CA",1303,601,65,4.0,11/29/2008,"Had a great salad here called the ""Santa Fe."" It was the perfect mix of greens, fixin's and dressing. Usually, one of three scenarios happens when I order a salad as a meal:  1. Way too many greens and no fixin's (e.g. no corn, avocado, ya know...the good stuff...the stuff you're actually paying for).  2. Way too many fixin's and no greens. When this occurs I feel like sending it back and ordering a double cheeseburger with bacon because I may as well; the calories I will consume will be about the same.  3. WAY too much dressing; a sea of dressing if you will. The lettuce has soaked in a long hot bath of dressing and now resembles cooked spinach covered in mayonnaise.  My point? It's hard to find a salad that satisfies me on every level and BJ's has done it. P.S. The chili was worth grubbing on as well."
Tyler M.,"Newman, CA",3,86,,4.0,2/21/2011,Been here a couple times and always enjoyed the food.  Has a modern inside with a nice bar and tv's throughout the inside.  They brew their own beer of all colors to suit whichever type ya like.  Will come to again.
