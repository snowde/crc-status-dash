Tia J.,"Salida, CA",3,40,,3.0,10/22/2008,"This is one of the places you can go on a lunch break and call ahead to have your name put on a list to cut down on wait time - the problem however is that they are so busy you can barely track down your waiter/waitress, place an order, get your food, get your bill, pay and get out within your lunch hour. They do (which I should try) have a take out menu that can be utilized and they even have on-line ordering. They have some really great lunch specials ($5.95 for a mini pizza and side salad or chicken sticks and fries, etc.), but since I was late back to work it cost me a little more than that. I would go here again, but not on a lunch break, it's not fast enough and it's too loud to carry on a conversation without yelling."
Jen G.,"Oakland, CA",53,102,92,4.0,7/31/2011,"Love this place! I've been to the Concord and Modesto location. Both had great service. Huge menu of apps, food and beer. Sports are always on their many jumbo tv's.  I always enjoy going to BJ's. Definitely try the Spinach and Artichoke Deep dish pizza."
Nicole S.,"Modesto, CA",22,175,2,3.0,11/10/2008,"Service was s-l-o-w.  Make sure you call ahead. They did give out pizza slices while we waited though. I wouldn't bother with the steak or balsamic chicken.  I had them both.  the first was undercooked, the second overcooked.  The parm crusted chicken and the salmon were both excellent though. Lots of TVs here. Hence the ""good for kids and ADHD adults"" vote. I might come here again, for the novelty."
Simon L.,"Oakdale, CA",86,27,6,4.0,9/21/2008,"Went there with my girl for lunch.  We've been to other BJ's before, so we thought we would give this one a try.  Stepped in and this place actually felt like a brew-house.  It had tall ceilings and a lot of TVs.  Our hostess sat us in minutes.  (I would suggest going to BJ's for lunch.  Modesto restaurants could get busy during nights and weekends.)  The waitress stopped by and I ordered a beer to start.  I decided to order the special brew...   YUCK!  Never, never, never order the Nit Wit beer!  Coriander should not be in beer.   Had to order the Hefeweizen to take the Coriander taste out of my mouth.  Waitress noticed I did not like the beer, but did not comp the new brew.  (Only reason for the 4 stars).   Other than that, the food was good (not great) and the atmosphere was excellent.  A lot of TVs in the place.  Should be a great place for football.  Have to stop by one Sunday."
Master P.,"Merced, CA",14,6,61,3.0,7/31/2011,"I went with a big group of 10, and it took us about 30 minutes to get seated at around 2:30-a very busy place still on a Sunday afternoon. Their burgers never amazed me so I ordered the Tuscano...it was ok..a little on the dry side. Our waitress did recommend extra sauce which I requested but they did not grant. The deep dish pizza my brother ordered was one of the better dishes. I will stick to pizza the next time I go. The Pizookie was delicious...nothing spectacular other than a cookie with ice cream on top, but it was delicious on a hot day."
Evonne T.,"Modesto, CA",8,39,5,4.0,8/25/2008,"Okay, so I wasn't really excited about getting another restaurant near the mall. Don't get me wrong- I love food and more than loving food, I love to eat!! But I think more than loving to eat is my love for shopping and with a huge restaurant slab in the middle of the mall parking lot, made me nervous. I already have a hard time finding mall parking, what if there was no where to park in the middle of my shopping spree, would I (gasp) actually have to walk miles and miles in the snow with no shoes....So, I went there with full intentions on picketing and was drawn in by that interesting revolving door that looks like the one at my dr's office. The wait was 45 minutes but it went fast, we memorized the menu while we waited. The staff was nice, the hostess talkative (think I learned her whole life story in the brief walk to our table) but the waitress looked stressed out and didn't once crack a smile.  In her defence, it was very busy and she was good.  She was probably just wondering how on earth she was going to be able to serve all the tables she was assigned to. We ordered Stuffed Avacado Egg Rolls which were delicious- cream cheese, sweet onion, avacado, tomatos, beer battered fish and chips and BJ's speciality deep dish pizza. The food was very good plus they brew their own root beer with endless refills. Yum!~  The inside is very well decorated (reminds me of the Venetian in Las Vegas) and there are TV's everywhere-perfect for football season. All in all, I would say this was a nice place to eat, but expect to pay around $50 for two."
Chama E.,"San Jose, CA",28,43,12,3.0,6/23/2011,"Sat us quickly, service was great!  Our waiter was on point and very attentive.  But the food was eh, well at least my dinner was.  I ordered the Scampi Pasta, I've had this dish at other BJ's and it was very delicious.  The Scampi Pasta I ordered last night was very dry and the presentation was different from the other BJ's restaurants I've ordered this meal from.  But all in all, we had a good experience.  The kids enjoyed their meal and we celebrated my son's birthday without a glich!  I definitely would go back, but this time, i'd try something different on the menu and stay away from the dry pasta."
Flora M.,"San Jose, CA",28,114,6,4.0,6/23/2009,"Came here for Father's Day because it was close to my sister-in-law's place in Modesto. I'm not a fan of the big-box equivalent of restaurants, but I was pleasantly surprised by the food and service. I ordered the Field of Greens salad with grilled chicken and it was delicious.  Our table also ordered two pizzas; one was half and half of two of their pre-made pizzas while the other was a build-your-own style pizza. Stick to the pre-made ones because they come with tons of toppings and that's probably worth your money. The build-your-own pizza was skimpy on the toppings.  I also had my first encounter with the Buffalo Bite, a mix of their Cider and Stout beers. I forgot where I was for a second as I enjoyed this delicious concoction. Does anyone know what it's called at any other bar? It's 50/50 of cider and stout. But anyway, I digress... The waitress was a little fake, but she was good. She kept checking on us, filling our glasses, and made sure everything was OK."
Hair Bear T.,"Modesto, CA",110,43,,1.0,7/25/2010,"Being a server I tend to be VERY generous with service related mistakes. That's why I gave BJ's a few chances to get it right. Waste because shocking I went 5 different times, different times of the day, week etc... Awful every time. The last time was so Terrible I called management the next morning. I DO NOT take it that far. Keeping with the norm, manager claimed he would look into the situation, informed me he had a similar complaint already come in, took my info... It's been 3 months, he never called back.... This place has been open long enough to have it together, I doubt they ever will."
Arthur D.,"Merced, CA",146,61,82,4.0,12/23/2010,Love that I can get GLUTEN-FREE pizza!!!  Yeah!
Corinne W.,"Hilo, HI",23,8,1,4.0,8/3/2009,"I've been to BJ's a handful of times and have never been disappointed. This restaurant is right next to the mall, so the high volume of business and the resulting wait times are pretty much a given, particularly during weekends and around dinnertime. If we know we're going to be in the area, we phone ahead. But we generally do this just about everywhere we go. I don't care if BJ's is a chain. The food is consistently really good here! Pizzas are yummy, pizookies are delish, pastas are great, stuffed potatoes are awesome (and HUGE) and the tomato bisque is to die for. Their beers aren't half bad either. Food here can get a little pricey for the younger crowd, but the lunch specials are incredible. Hubby and I can grab a large, satisfying lunch and a round of beers here on a weekday  for around $20. Service is okay, provided how busy this restaurant is. I've only had one bad experience with them (Ordered a wedge salad with no bacon, received one with bacon. Waited five minutes for waiter to come back, then another five minutes for new salad, only to realize that waiter had accidentally swiped my fork when he took the first salad. Had to wait another five minutes for waiter to return.) but it was a silly mistake, and definitely not enough to keep me from returning. The wait staff is friendly, and will do their best to correct any problems or mix-ups that may arise during your meal. Bottom line: If you can handle the wait, it's totally worthwhile. If not, phone ahead and get your food to go."
D H.,"Modesto, CA",1,7,,1.0,7/25/2014,"If I could rate this place a zero, I would. The service is TERRIBLE from the minute you walk in the door. Last night was our daughter's birthday, she selected BJ's as the location for her BDay dinner. We were hoping for an enjoyable experience to celebrate the occasion. When we walked in, the hostess took our information and indicated about a 10 minute wait. Interestingly, several large parties (8 or more) were called to be seated before us. No problem, they probably called ahead. The annoying part was, for all - only 1 or 2 from their party was present when called. So......why seat them when you have others waiting. After 25 minutes we were seated. Once seated, we were there at least 15 minutes before anyone ever came to the table to greet us, take a drink order, or anything for that matter. Once the server came, she apologized for the delay...someone called in sic...blah blah blah. Don't care - that is the manager's responsibility to call someone else in. It happens in businesses all over the country. One in our party ordered a root beer. 10 minutes after other drinks were brought, the server told us she had to go to the bar to get the soda. Okay - so go get it! The time spent to come tell us could have been better utilized to get the beverage. It arrived after we inquired twice more. Meal arrived, asked for ketchup...three times. After the third time, the party next to us was kind enough to give us their bottle of ketchup. These kind of actions continued to happen throughout. Our bill comes - it has charges for items we didn't order. Server says she has to find a manager for the correction. 10 minutes later, comes back to tell us the register had a malfunction and she needs a manager to assist with reprinting the bill receipt. She finally comes back and....extra chargers are still on there. SERIOUSLY....ARE YOU DUMB OR WHAT?????????? 1 hour and 45 minutes later our meal was finished. I hope BJ's corporate reads this. The food is good, we have been to other locations and the service has been better. The MODESTO location needs assistance, new management, better hiring practices, or SOMETHING????? This isn't the first time the service has been poor in this location. I PROMISE I won't be back nor will I ever recommend this restaurant to anyone. I will bad mouth BJ's Modesto every chance I get."
Chanmary K.,"Rocklin, CA",32,157,25,3.0,10/11/2008,"We went to BJ's for the first time on Thursday night. We tried the 7 beer taste testers, that was fun.  I had ordered their $19.00 NEW YORK STRIP STEAK...big disappointment for big price. Had no flavor, I asked for Medium rare and got medium well. A good steak wouldnt need any A1 sauce...even with the A1 it was still too chewy, dry and without any flavor. They brought out my salad and never gave me utensils. We had to wait a while, so I could wave someone down for my fork. My boyfriend had sprite and they had filled his half empty cup with water! LOL. The waiter and waiteresses were really nice about everything... I MIGHT try this place again...MIGHT. I guess if you want a good steak youd have to go to Tahoe Joes or Outback.  Dont get me wrong...their pizza was great!"
Katrina W.,"Pleasanton, CA",5,6,,5.0,8/13/2011,"I went here for lunch and was able to sit anywhere. They were prompt and I had the best service. The food was great. Mac and cheese with bacon was awesome and the pulled pork sandwich was great. Peach margarita was good, a little sweet but good. I would recommend this place to anyone that has a group of friends that want to eat great food!"
Harry P.,"Martinez, CA",46,46,1,4.0,6/15/2009,"Had a great time here. The beer was excellent as were the mixed drinks. I ordered a half rack of the baby back ribs and I was NOT disappointed. They were excellent as was the clam chowder soup I ordered on the side. The staff was friendly and courteous and deserved the extra tip I gave them for above and beyond service. Overall, this place was awesome and I will be back when I am back in the area again. The only thing preventing me from giving this 5 stars is the crazy price tag on the menu items driving my bill past the $100 mark with ease. However, the food was well worth it."
T Z.,"Modesto, CA",0,7,,1.0,1/6/2014,"I've never written a bad review before, but I am inclined to share this experience, for those of us that do not look all prim and proper. I chose to watch the Niner game at Bj's, as my family was gone for the day, due to a death in a friends family. It was chilly, but I decided to ride my motorcycle, to have a little therapy as well. There is no good parking for a bike at this location, and I always have to worry about it, but chose it because they have big tv's, good beer, and I always thought a decent breakfast menu, I used to meet friends from out of town here after church, because it's close to the freeway and aways has had friendly service. As I finally got a decent parking spot, not to far from the front, I went in and got lucky with a decent seat at the bar. I asked for a menu, and it was, I noticed, 1:07 pm.. I asked the bartender if breakfast was still being served, and she said NO, brerakfast ends at 1pm, (that was 7 minutes ago) I said in my head. Ok it is what it is, the eggs must blow up at 1, hell I don't know. I put my leather coat on the chair, and leather gloves on the bar. I kept stepping away from time to time by the bathroom where I could hear the phone calls about the arraingments for the friend of the familes loss, then periodically going outside to check on my bike. Leaving my EXPENSIVE LEATHER COAT on my chair, and gloves, while each time covering my drink with a napkin. Mind you I'm very polite, and ALWAYS say please and thank you, and respect the service industry greatly, I always tip very big for good service, sometimes 10 or 20 dollars on a small check, if I have the money, because I know that is their income, and it's not easy. I noticed the two ladies kind of whispering, and glancing at me a couple times, mind you, I didnt have a hoodie on, and I was pretty much occupying a space there. Now I didn't order a bunch of drinks, or steak and lobster, my bill was a whopping 13 dollars, when I stood up about 45 minutes in, during a commercial to go check on my bike, thats when mizz bartender (I'll leave her name out, as she will know if she sees this, and if the boss reads these and cares, they will figure it out) decides to say, in front of EVERYBODY there, a full bar. ""IF YOUR GOING TO KEEP GETTING UP FROM YOUR CHAIR, I'M GOING TO NEED A CARD FROM YOU"". I smiled and said ""I'm checking on my motorcycle, because you have no safe place to park it, and my $500 dollar leathers are right here at my spot, I don't think I'll be leaving them for a 13 tab"". I never said another word about it, although it did change my whole attitude, about the moment, the two service ladies, and the people around me spoke about it some throughout the game, IT WAS VERY UNCALLED FOR. I've been in customer service for years, and if she or those two, were not observant enough to see my big azz leather jacket on my chair, gloves and helmet to boot, please have the class to not call a customer out in front of several other patrons. I also had asked to sample the three light beers, and asked if they had anything besides breast's for chicken. Maybe this was too much extra questions for them I don't really know. The game was great, and she couldn't ruin the taste of the few  beers, or the kool people around me. When everyone cleared an hour or so later, I found the manager on duty, and thanked him for letting me park where he did, I never mentioned my experience, was very tempted, but just chose not too. I finished my beer, taking my time, because I, of course wanted to make sure I wasn't buzzed, she did fill up my water about 10 times, maybe that was too much, again, don't know.  I gave her my American Express, and took the time to write a big ZERO on the tip line. and wrote in. You shouldn't judge people by what they look like, and basically embarass them in front of everyone. I usually tip big, God Bless !! :-)....... I think what really hurt, was the fact that I was being very polite, and we were all talking about other local places, and I was just REALLY taken aback by being called out like pond scum over a 13 dollar bill. It only cost her 10 bucks,s my bill was 29 dollars when all was said and done, but i all adds up, I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one, ya never are. Moral: pay attention, if I was going outside with my leather jacket and helmet on, then maybe she would have had concern, or better yet, make a policy to give a card when the tab is started. DON'T EVER CALL GOOD PATRONS OUT, BECAUSE I PROMISE YOU NOW IT WILL COST YOU HUNDREDS IN THE FUTURE. THERE ARE MANY FRIENDS, AND MANY GAMES, AND VERY MANY OTHER PLACES TO CONGRAGATE !!!"
Dee H.,"Lake County, CA",1,44,2,2.0,6/9/2012,"I was here a couple of years ago for lunch and I remembered it being really good so while in town on a visit we decided on a late dinner here. It's always nice to be greeted with a smile (first rule for customer service IMO), we weren't. Our server was polite and friendly but oh so slow except when it came to ordering , I felt rushed. I had the Sweet Pig, not very flavorful, think Round Tables ham and pineapple is better. My husband had the deep fried prawns, they were a little over cooked but tolerable. Our friend had the fish and chips, he said pretty good. Before we were finished our server asked if she could cash us out because they wanted her off the floor. Hmm, another not so customer friendly move. All in all I would say this place serves the standard chain food that is a bit lacking. They have many choices on beers and other alcohol which seems to be their forte. Service pretty much sucked. Not sure if I will try BJ's again, for sure not this one."
connie w.,"Tracy, CA",36,45,,4.0,4/22/2011,The server was good but the food service was a bit slow. The flat bread pizza was good as well as the lettuce wraps and  tomato mozzarella cheese salad and chocolate chip pazookie. With the exception of the pazookie everything on this list was very diet friendly.
Kellene M.,"Modesto, CA",14,16,,5.0,4/12/2011,I love the avocado rolls. The steak is not so great. Drinks are a lil pricey. Just ask them to make it strong and not so sweet.
Zohra A.,"Livermore, CA",98,53,1,3.0,5/9/2011,"So, the wait was long to get seated because we tried this place out on Mothers Day, 45 minutes, but then the food took a good hour. The appetizers were fast and not that bad, avocado rolls and potato skins. I liked my dish once received, the salmon in thai sauce.  The restaurant had a busy active feel to it.  Overall the food was good, the service was too, but note to self no more holidays. I would go again."
