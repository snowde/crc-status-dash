Rachel S.,"Modesto, CA",217,40,26,4.0,7/27/2010,"Lunch was delish...inexpensive, and service was swift and friendly. I loved the deocr, nice bar area.."
Paul p.,"Provo, UT",0,17,,3.0,8/16/2011,"Nothing spectacular. I wish I had more to write. The food was edible. We were waited on in a timely manner. Nothing here really stood out. I think I will try someplace different in the future just to take a risk. This place just seemed ""safe""."
Donna R.,"Modesto, CA",0,2,,1.0,10/16/2012,"Although my husband and I have eaten here a few times over the last two years and it was all OK,  we ordered pizza last night after getting back from a trip to the east coast and it was pathetic,  just really thin crust with very little sauce and none of the toppings ordered,  just some scattered onions and bell peppers????  Was suposed to be half ham and pinapple and half combination,  was neither.  Not going back.  I would get Little Ceaser's pizza (and I hate that pizza) before paying what we did for the one we got at BJ's."
Katie M.,"Modesto, CA",27,36,8,4.0,6/3/2010,Great food an atmosphere. Parking sucks so plan on walking a ways during the busy shopping seasons.
Nick S.,"Modesto, CA",8,16,2,3.0,5/4/2011,Good food for lunch. Great Service about 90% of the time. Prices are fair. Have not tryed the brewed beers as of yet. But its easy access to the mall.
Danny F.,"Modesto, CA",11,33,8,3.0,7/11/2010,Food was decent service was junk. It was a friday night so I understand it gets a bit busy BUT come on this was just horrible ordered a pizza and 2 appetizers.....pizza came out first appetizers came out after the pizza had been killed off yup they were cold too. If the food was not so good it would have got 1 star
Tee w.,"Oakland, CA",58,168,4,4.0,1/28/2009,"I like this location better than the one in Stockton. I had a parmesean chicken dish with panko breading, and it was good, needed just a little more seasoning.  I like this location because it is right in walking distance to go walk those calories off at the mall!"
Brian H.,"Catheys Valley, CA",74,444,1,1.0,10/2/2009,"What  restaurant has a ten minute wait on a weekday night with plenty of open tables?  If your answer was BJs, then you are correct.  Screw this place."
Sharon S.,"Modesto, CA",84,158,95,4.0,10/11/2009,"My husband and I shared the meatloaf dinner! It is sooo good! They give you three generous slices of meatloaf that is baked and then grilled with great mushroom gravy, mashed potatoes & mixed fresh vegetables! Quite flavorful! All this for $12.95! Great service too! We have never be disappionted when we've come! We will be back!"
Victoria G.,"Salida, CA",3,18,8,1.0,5/23/2010,"OK so after about a week I am still recovering from all the food I ate at BJ's. I prefer homemade food, not sure if that's why I feel like crap still, but its almost like I have to retrain my body to like not so salty, fried, chemically enhanced food? I'll just stick to the Mudslide next time."
Sharan S.,"Modesto, CA",123,46,22,3.0,12/18/2009,"Poor service would be understandable if the restaurant were overcrowded, but there's no excuse once the slower hours hit. Servers are forgetful, and a little bit rude. One of my friends ordered a drink and wanted to send it back because it was made too strongly, the server actually spent several minutes trying to convince her that it was made correctly. If it had been or hadn't was besides the point, the server should have fixed her drink without issue. The food can be described as average, and the pizza and pizookies are great. BJs has it good days and it bad days, but can never be described as spectacular."
Michael C.,"Las Vegas, NV",39,249,17,4.0,8/29/2010,"Buddy liked the one in Irvine so much, we stopped by on our way back from Yosemite.  The service was just as well here, the server paid extra attention to make sure my salmon was seared correctly.  Bj's seems to maintain a very consistent operation."
Dora H.,"Modesto, CA",21,26,,4.0,1/29/2011,"I have been to a few different BJ's and when the one in Modesto first opened, they could have done better.  Since then they have improved greately.  I love the BJ's Favorite pizza and the fried artichokes off the small bites menu.  I have never had bad service, except when they first opened.  I think I drive my husband crazy because it seems whenever he asks me where I want to go, my answer is BJ's."
Jennifer R.,"Manteca, CA",0,24,1,4.0,1/19/2011,"Great drinks. Good Food. We went on a Friday night, our server was freindly almost acting the friendly part a bit much but her tip was well deserved. We had a nice appetizer and dinner. We will be going back in the near future."
Liz I.,"Modesto, CA",8,124,4,2.0,10/5/2009,"The food here is fine, generic chain fare.  Service has been adequate the few times I've gone.  I think my problem with the place comes from the time I ordered an appetizer (I believe it was the southwestern rolls) and I asked for some modification of it, to which the waiter replied that they couldn't since they got the packaged frozen items from another location.  Always good to hear you're paying good money for frozen packaged food."
Melissa P.,"Manteca, CA",146,18,3,5.0,8/6/2010,I had a great time here! Our server was prompt and attentive and the food came out quick and hot! I also enjoyed a strawberry splash since I was in the mood for a piña colada type drink. Can I say YUM?! You'd be surprised with the taste and alcohol content!! Overall a really great time and Sam was awesome! Request her!
Miharu Y.,"Portland, OR",13,98,,3.0,5/22/2010,"while it might seem strange to review a chain i just want to share an interesting experience my childhood girlfriends and i had while lunching here a few weeks ago. we ordered an old favorite appetizer - potato skins. seems simple enough, right?   wrong. my friend found what we believe to be a rock with her teeth (fortunately her beautiful smile is still in tact)  the manager said that our rock was just something from the fryer and that he would make sure it was cleaned out and comp'ed the plate.  two thoughts:    1: gross! clean the fryer BEFORE it becomes a dental hazard    2: if they had left that piece of petrified carbon in the fryer any longer we could have had a diamond!"
Sofia H.,"Tracy, CA",91,43,1,2.0,3/16/2011,"Nice building, tasteful decor inside, good service, but food not so good. With the way this place looked I was expecting great tasting food but it tasted almost exactly like Applebee's food? Don't get me wrong I like some things at Applebees but if I wanted that I would have gone there lol So back to the food...one of my friends had the Alfredo pasta and it was very dry, yes she asked for extra sauce on the side but that defeated the purpose of it being served right. My husband had the chicken fried steak and fried it was, pretty dry. My mom had the fish n chips and her fish was over cooked the batter was dark brown when it should have been the usual golden yellow. I of course went safe because I was hungry and ordered something they couldn't really get wrong which was the Caesar salad and it was good. Everyone else had basic stuff like a sandwich and burgers and they said it was ok nothing special. So overall I think this is a good ""lunch"" place but for good dinner food I think not. Oh yeah the prices aren't too bad which is good because I would not have been happy if I had to pay alot of $ for mediocre food."
Victoria B.,"Turlock, CA",7,121,9,2.0,2/24/2009,"Yea, I've experienced better.I didn't know they were serving Pizza Hut at BJ's!!? I ordered a ""chicago"" style deep dish pizza with cheese and pepperoni. It came and I swear you guys it tasted JUST like Pizza Hut's pan pizza. Our server was not the best. She seemed too busy with the groups at the bar who kept trying to get her attention just as much as us. The meal overall was mediocre. I don't know how you can just LABEL something as good quality and then serve crap. I would only go to this BJ's again if it was by coincidence. ALSO, their wait? Ridiculous! They have this call ahead thing but it's not really call ahead because you still have to wait an outrageous amount of time....for....PIZZA HUT!"
Eden A.,"Salida, CA",0,11,,1.0,4/27/2011,Let me first say that they have a fun bar atmosphere. However in the handful of times I've been there I've had no good experiences. My first experience we were given a pager and a wait time of 20 minutes. We waited in the lobby and about 40 minutes later I asked the hostess when we would be sat. She told me that they had already called my number a long time ago and that we'd have to wait again this time for 30 minutes. Seriously? I ended up talking to a manager and he basically said there was nothing he could do for me and that it was my fault. So months later we went back again. This time there was no wait. However when walking through the dining room I slipped and fell. I ended up spraining my wrist. I was asked if I was ok  but no accident report was ever offered to me. Luckily im not one to sue. Then after we sat it took our server (who was obviously busy) almost 15 minutes to even acknowledge us. To top it off he brought me the wrong drink. I've since returned but now I only sit in the bar. The food isn't bad but the service and standards are less than average. The only reason I go is because my boyfriend likes their beers. I don't recommend this restaurant.
