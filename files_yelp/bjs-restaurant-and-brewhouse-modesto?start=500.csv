Al N.,"Novato, CA",8,6,,1.0,2/16/2011,"Where do I begin been to the modesto Bj's twice about a year apart. First time had a couple of beers and the avacado egg rolls.  I asked about them brewing there the bartender said no the brewery is in Reno, NV.  I could tell I tried Three of there ales and they tasted old and had a funky after taste.  I asked why they call it a brew house they don't brew there she said it's because they have brews there.  That is not a brew house, BJ's is an ale house she had no clue what i was saying.  If you are going to sell craft brews why is there a staff of people who know nothing about beer.   This last time i went my wife and i ordered the chicken potstickers, Fish and chips and pull pork sandwich.  The potstickers were flavorless even after dipping them in the sauce.  My fish and chips again were flavorless no seasoning the fish was rubbery and the batter was greasy.  the potato wedges were cold and bland.  i gave it two tries but on this one two strikes and your out."
Jami N.,"Tracy, CA",62,62,8,2.0,2/9/2009,"They are only getting 2 stars because the pizookie was good.  Other then that this place was extremely disappointing.  My fiance and I had heard a lot of great things about BJ's from family members who had been going to the new location in Fremont.  Being we live in Mountain House and had made a trip to the mall in modesto we decided to give BJ's a try for lunch.   My fiance got the open face meatloaf sandwich that his brother had been raving about, and I got the california burger with thin fries. Both dishes were very bland and unsatisfying.  I make meatloaf and mashed potatoes 50x better then the crap that my fiance had, we've had better meatloaf at Red Tractor Cafe in Dublin for less then $10 LOL.  My burger was very tasteless, I was hoping it would have more flavor and spice considering it was supposed to have pepper jack cheese, green chiles, chipotle mayo,and ranch dressing on it.   I didn't taste mayo nor ranch, and I did check to make sure it had mayo on it.  The pepper jack cheese was even bland and the green chiles were the same kind of stuff I buy in a small can at the grocery store.  We've bbq'd up some better turkey burgers w/ pepper jack and green chile's then what I had at BJ's.   I really don't understand what the hype is, the food is below even mediocre, and the service is nothing to get excited about either.  I never once got a refill on my soda despite the constant refilling of my fiance's water, and at times the waitress seemed as though she could give a rats you know what if she was there or not.   On top of all that we waited almost 30 min to be seated, totally not worth the wait or the money.  I don't think we will be returning to BJ's unless it is a family dinner in which someone else requested to go there and we have no other choice but to join them."
John A.,"Modesto, CA",1,14,,1.0,9/20/2008,"I guess I HAD to give it a one star just to get the review up.  I took an old friend to BJ's on Thursday at 4PM.  I noticed that this place is a bit pricey for what you get. The beer was $4.50 a glass.  I guess this is OK, but when you consider the price of the food, all of it is way too expensive. I had a baked potato with broccoli and chicken with Alfredo sauce.  Not bad but not something I would ever want again.  Not for 10 bucks! The appetizer was chicken pot stickers.  The photo on the menu looked good but when they arrived they were the same pot stickers that you can get at COSTCO for 10 bucks a bag full.  Here you just get 6 for 10 bucks. My friend ordered the angus burger and it was cold and flavorless. The waitress was nice but the hostess didn't seem to want to wait for a couple of old men (one of us is blind) to get to the table.  She ran way ahead of us. I would not ever go back to BJ's.  Mediocre food and high prices. One more thing.  Why are they building so many new restaurants and buildings in the parking lot of the Mall?  The lot is way too small for the Christmas rush already. Don't waste your time going to BJ's.  It is obvious that the good reviews are from employees or the manager of this place.   The real reviews are not so great!"
Saurabh S.,"Modesto, CA",22,68,2,1.0,12/2/2012,"i joined the BJs rewards program, prior to going. they gave me a coupon for a free pizookie. i went there to go out to dinner with my parents (they don't get out much). the waitress saw me checking into yelp as I was seated. i ordered a large deep dish pizza and drinks. it was good. at the end of the meal I ordered a pizookie and gave the coupon and a coupon for $4 off. 10 minutes later, a lady without a name tag came and introduced herself as the manager. She tells me I cannot have the $4 off and a pizookie, even though neither coupon says that. I told her I will only take the $4 off. 10 more minutes go by and a guy brings a pizookie. I turn it away. then the waitress comes back and says they already made the pizookie, so I can either have it, and would I like to pay for it or have it for free. So after all that, i got $4 off and a free pizookie. It probably cost BJ's $1 to produce it and they wasted 20 minutes of my time and the managers dignity to try to not give it to me."
L L.,"Modesto, CA",0,12,5,1.0,3/12/2013,"I will never again go to BJ's in Modesto. First, they tried to seat my party of 6 in a small booth that would only fit 4. So they walked us back to the lobby to wait another 10mins after we already waited 15mins to be seated in the first place. So they seated us a a regular table that was only 5feet away from the booth they tried to seat us at first which we couldnt understand why they couldnt just seat us right away instead of waiting to confirm with a manager. This us what i call poor customer service! Having us wait longer for a table! Before we sat down at our table we seen a bigger corner booth and we asked the hostess if we could sit there she said no because its closed off, so we went on our way to our table. 10mins later we seen with our own eyes another party being seated in the same booth we asked for and was denied. The staff has no order and no sense of customer service! That was the icing on the cake! Horrible service and hostess had a bad attitude! Never again at this location! I love the BJ's in the bay area way better so ill be taking trips out there if i really want some pizzokie. I dont think BJs in Modesto deserves a star at all!!! No stars for BJ's in Modesto!"
JENNA L.,"Sacramento, CA",1,32,,1.0,8/31/2008,"The wait after call ahead seating...60 Minutes!!!We decide not to ""wait"" the 60 minutes and order food to go. They said 20 minutes to go for the pizza. How long did we wait? I kid you not, 60 minutes!!!! All we ordered was a large pizza, a house salad and a rootbeer. I get in the car, look at my salad that I was sooo  in the mood for...Limp, wilted, hot looking lettuce that looks like it sat out all day under a heat lamp, and one measly slice of a tomato in a giant box. I call back thinking, yea...this can't be right. Most house salads anywhere have green leaf lettuce, croutons, shaved carrots, tomato and occasionally red onion and cucumber. Nope, BJ'S house salad is lettuce, tomato and cucumber and apparently they forgot the cucumber under the heat lamp. Oh yea, I ordered the salad and the small rootbeer separate from the pizza. $9 for the hot lettuce I didn't even eat, what a rip off."
Rob P.,"Modesto, CA",58,97,2,5.0,8/27/2008,"I have to give these guys a good review after today. I went there for lunch/dinner and I actually enjoyed myself. the seating is alittle too open for my taste but other then that it was good. The food tasted good, nothing super-spectacular but still good, and the service was great. I assumed the calzones were ""Rob"" size (inside joke) but they turned out to be alittle too small for me. SO they just gave me the one they gave me and made me another one at no charge. I appreciated their attempt at keeping the customer happy at their expense even though it was my mistake to make such an assumption, very nice!"
Doug S.,"Modesto, CA",30,92,,3.0,12/11/2009,"If you are prepared to sit and have five different waiters, than BJ's is a great dining experience. The food is wonderful, but don't be mislead by the claim that the brewery is on site--it's not. Also, one time I went and they gave me a slice of deep dish pizza while I waited, I know, cool right? Well, hasn't happened since. It irks me that they would do it the one time and just stop. It's misleading."
Kristina R.,"Burlingame, CA",4,131,,4.0,7/28/2009,"The reason this place gets 4 stars from me..is it is one of the better ""chain"" restaurants in Modesto. They have excellent deep-dish pizzas with inventive flavors..such as buffalo chicken. The pizookie is also to die for! I have been going to the one in San Mateo for years..but my family got excited to try this ""new"" place in Modesto. The service here is very good and so is the food."
Jess d.,"Modesto, CA",0,9,,4.0,1/1/2012,Not bad. We got there on a Saturday night so it was pretty busy and we were seated in just a few minutes and we got our drinks in just a couple minutes. The pomegranat martini is awesome. The food is pretty good and prices are so so. I think it helps if you get an older waitress they tend to be more experienced and more friendly. All in all I would go back. The atmosphere is fun and youthful. Not a bad place.
Roberta G.,"San Jose, CA",0,3,,1.0,9/28/2008,One of the worst luncheon experiences for me and my family!!! Service and food was LOUSY....My pizza was burnt to a crisp and my moms chicken alfredo pasta was dry and undercooked.  We were there for a total of 2 hours and 15 minutes.  We had a 30 minute wait time to be seated and had to wait another 45 minutes for our lousy food.  I complained to both the server and the manager but nothing was done to resolve the matter.  This BJs cerrtainly does not meet up to it's standards.  Both the service and the food were of POOR QUALITY!!!!!   I don't recommend it to anyone who wants a good meal.  Fast food might be better than this.
Tim K.,"Ripon, CA",0,3,,4.0,12/19/2013,great place to eat with the family! prices aren't to bad. 4 stars
Michelle T.,"Fremont, CA",4,35,,3.0,3/26/2009,I came here for happy hour and it was $1 off draft beer and half off pizzas. Needless to say I got one cheap dinner. I ate in the bar and the service was great. I had a mini pizza and the food was okay. I tried two of there brews. One was a hefeweizen. I am a huge fan of hefeweizen but I didn't like this one too much. I also had the nutty brewnette which was better than the hef but not by much. Overall can't beat cheap food and beer with a big screen tv. Probably wouldn't come if it wasn't happy hour though.
Stefani E.,"Modesto, CA",0,2,,3.0,12/17/2009,"The atmosphere of the place was very fun and just like a BJ's down south. However the food was not as great as what I remember. But the service was great! I will probably go back here for lunch or dinner sometime, but i really hope the food is better."
Margaret Y.,"Modesto, CA",14,35,28,5.0,9/17/2008,"This place was soooo great!  My hubby and I went there for lunch last weekend around 11:45.  Since it's new I expected a long wait, but they seated us right away.  The same night however, my in-laws tried to eat there and the wait for 2 people was 1.5 hours.  The food was awesome and the root beer was so good.  I highly recommend this place and will be going back."
nancy c.,"Modesto, CA",0,9,,3.0,11/7/2011,"Went there last night.   Food was good.  Service was not the best.  Ordered two coffee's and one ice tea.  Had to ask for the sugar.  Had to ask for spoons for the coffee.  When our order came I was told I had to wait.  I ordered chili in a bread round.  My husband ordered chili on a baked potato.  Our other two guests were served their meals.  My dinner came after everyone had eaten half of their meals.  My husband ordered some soup and it never was served to him.  So guess what, I finally called for the manager.  This was a first for me, I told her that I expected to be comped  for my dinner.  And do not charge us for the soup that never came.   It will be along time before I go back there again."
Rebecca P.,"Salida, CA",13,8,7,1.0,7/29/2010,"Don't Eat here.. I waited over an hour to be seated and because it was so busy I thought it would be worth the wait ..WRONG!!! My food was burned, Tasteless and for some reason came with a giant baked potato!! I ordered ribs and they were the worst ribs I've ever eaten in my life! Maybe the other food there is better but I'm not going back to find out. I guess if you're really in to beer u can go there for that, it would have to be better than the ribs? The place looks all fancy but I go to a restaurant for the food. The worst restaurant experience I have ever had!"
john h.,"Long Beach, CA",19,58,,3.0,5/5/2009,"Over priced, too many cholo's. Food is ok, beer is good.  I have been here twice and the same result.  The staff tries, but a little contrived."
Stacy M.,"Modesto, CA",0,20,,4.0,7/25/2011,"We love to eat at this restaurant! The service is always good and the food is always as it was the last time you visited...Yummy! I have not had a bad meal here. I am a huge fan of the Pazooky and I love their Berry Cider as well! I have to give a shout out to one of the servers, Monica. She is the BEST!!!"
Jason R.,"Merced, CA",90,7,1,5.0,2/5/2009,"When I went, on a busy Friday night, service was fast, for it being so busy. If you have a party of 9 or less call ahead at least an hour, so when you get there, you will get a table within 20 minutes. Otherwise, you will have to probably wait awhile. So be smart and call ahead. I had the small pepperoni pizza, plenty of pizza for one person, if you're smaller, get re mini, I'm 6'1"", so ya. A large could probably feed 4 people, easy. The specialty dessert is awsome, hot sizzling cookie with ice cream on top."
