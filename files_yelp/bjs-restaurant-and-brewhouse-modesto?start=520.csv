Tala F.,"Turlock, CA",0,1,,2.0,7/7/2012,"I typically do not like chain restaurants because I feel the quality of the food is somewhat mediocre and something that I can make at home, however, I have enjoyed BJ's because they have a pretty descent selection of beer and good food. I was with a large party and had one hell of a time getting a grilled turkey burger. I was one of the first people to arrive and order my food. When I received my food they had given me a veggie burger and insisted that it was a turkey burger, my waiter finally offered to correct his mistake and get me what I originally ordered. I figured it would be out quickly, but to my surprise it took an hour and a half to receive a turkey burger but no fries. Then it took like 15 more minutes to get the fries that were supposed to come with the meal. The manager came over to apologize because my meal was mistakenly given to the wrong table and offered to comp my meal. I was extremely annoyed with the fact that it took so long to rectify a mistake and that my waiter hardly had any help!! Don't know if I will go back at least not with a large group!!"
S S.,"San Jose, CA",0,14,2,5.0,9/9/2008,"Well I started out to go to the Harvest Moon, after reading the reviews, so i called a old friend to met for late lunch early dinner. Since i was heading down 99 Friday from Sacramento and decided I would take a detour though Modesto.  We never made it, she says hey why don't we  hit the freeway go to the new BJ's instead of driving around in circles in the middle  of mo-town, at this point being a Friday and traffic i was game and hungry! It was impossible to find parking and getting through traffic to get to the Harvest Moon so they lost my business for that day.  What a excellent choice! An speaking of Choices it was so hard to know what to choose. They don't give you a menu they give you a book!!! There is so much to choose from we kept having to tell the waitress to keep coming back poor thing, our waitress was so patient and  excellent!.  When we finally did decided,we had the advocado egg rolls, and the chicken pot stickers to start, i had a root beer as well as a mixed drink which the root beer was excellent !!! They guy sitting across from me says pssssst  try there root beer its the best if you like root beer so i decided i would have both!  Food was excellent we both chose something that we both could spit she had the Meat Loaf sandwich, an i had the chardonnay shrimp pasta we were so stuffed!  Just roll us out to the car hahah kidding!!!   I just also thought they just had beer, i was miss staken, they also have a full bar, and sooo many different drinks to choose from.  I am not a big fan of beer so she had a beer and I had a mixed drink, it was delicious, I tried her beer and now i am hooked on there beers for not being a fan now I am! We were  going to have another drink, after all we ate we were so stuffed we could not drink another thing.  I normally do not eat that much, there was so much we both could not resist. I will definitely be back if not to this one there are others now I know. Oh and the decor is perfect too!!  I cannot wait to go back again to any of the BJs to try more other things. next stop will be to the original place hmmm maybe  if I can get parking with out walking a mile if i cannot find parking then well you can figure where i will be.   Oh yeah almost forgot don't  leave unless you try one of there Pzookies!!  dessert was great the famous pzookie was mmmmmm wonderful!!! It is a good place to go for sure! Just bring your appetite!!  I took a to go Menu so the poor, waiter or  waitress won't have to wait so long next time!!! Next time i will go prepared!!   Bon Appetite!!!!!"
Dave W.,"Modesto, CA",25,91,,3.0,12/29/2008,"good drinks, ok food.  id rather go to tony romas or something. pretty slow service, it takes a while to get seated and like i said, the food is nothing to write home about. the bar is cool though, they have tons of liquors and a buncha tvs all around the place.  nice ambiance also.  great location, right off 99 near the mall."

Christine S.,"Salida, CA",0,8,6,5.0,11/28/2009,"Yum! We always go here when we have a chance to eat out. I always order the cheeseburger melt with yummy skinny fries, they are to die for. They are sometimes kinda slow but definitely worth the wait."
Joel G.,"Modesto, CA",0,3,1,1.0,5/31/2009,"I've been to BJ's a couple of times and it's usually okay, nothing to WOW over, but the food is good, drinks are okay as well, but the service sucks booty. OMG, I went there the other day for a bday party and the service killed it. They took a good 30min just for drinks. It was a joke. Even though we brought the cake, they usually give you a bday cookie ice cream pastry and I felt so bad cause the bday girl wanted it and she never got it. I'd say I would come here for drinks and appetizers, but the hell with that, they take way too long. It's incredible that this place is so nice and they have crappy service. I think this place can be good, if they hired new staff and let go of these idiot high school & college kids. If you pay close attention, there standing in the back by the bathrooms texting. Attitude is a little thing that makes a big difference.  Sorry BJ's you only get 1 star, and I don't think you deserve even that."
