Nicole H.,"San Francisco, CA",7,39,83,3.0,6/10/2017,"My boyfriend and I came here for the game yesterday and had planned to stay the whole time but decided to leave cause our server Micayla sucked. We were sitting at the bar and it was weird how attentive she was to the people next to us but it's like she'd forget about us or she'd be sitting at the end of the bar talking or on her phone or something by the register. We were sad because there was a blonde server before her that seemed so nice and attentive but she was getting off when we got there. We ordered the calamari, fried asparagus, lettuce wraps, and avocado egg rolls. I liked everything as usual except the avocado egg rolls. The calamari and asparagus were delicious and crispy. Bj's has my favorite lettuce wraps, those were good as usual! But I wasn't a fan of the egg rolls. They weren't necessarily bad just too mushy for me. I love the berry burst cider too! All in all it was nice I just didn't care for our server.."
Ravi T.,"Livingston, CA",0,2,,1.0,7/3/2017,They sucked so much. Waited hella long so we left. Like over an hour golly. Jeez that was terrible.
S P.,"Modesto, CA",191,27,11,5.0,4/27/2017,All you dumbasses putting 1 star reviews! This restaurant is the bomb and the staff is hot fire! Go to chilli's and if you don't know how to tip stay in and make some mash potatoes.
Joshua L.,"Lathrop, CA",1,19,16,3.0,8/1/2017,"Waited for appetizers for about 20 minutes since we ordered. I expected to be at least earlier than that. Felt like the wait was 30 minutes. At least it was okay, I guess. Refills of our drinks came after and the food. Randomly, the manager came to apologize of the wait for appetizers. I heard they were short on staff today. First time for the classic prime rib dip. Did not like the horseradish sauce and dip but won't blame them for it, just simple that I don't like it. Both the fries and sandwich are okay. Sparkling raspberry lemonade was good. Cookies and cream and churro pizookie was good as well. Server was also nice to us especially when he was sorry about the appetizer. At least everything turn out alright. Removed the price of the appetizers."
Jennifer O.,"Sonora, CA",0,1,,5.0,7/9/2017,"We visited Friday 6/30/2017. Food was great! Love the avocado egg rolls and the beignet. Our drinks were top notch, not your watered-down mixed drinks. The Mahi-Mahi had great flavor and the Mediterranean chicken tacos were refreshing.  As we were seated our drink order was taken immediately. Miguel was our waitor, a delight to say the least. He was personable, friendly, attentive, and suggestive. I especially like that when we asked his opinion on food options he didn't say 'everything is good'.  He told us what HE liked, which is what we asked.  His customer service was top notch. To later find out he was recently promoted to training supervisor (Miguel did not tell us) seemed to fit him well and had shed more light on how modest/humble he is. BJ's was packed! Enjoyed great conversation with Diana, a mgr. She was friendly, passionate, and all around good person. Time flew, as our conversations moved from on topic to the next. To hear her passion in the way she spoke about customer service and the food service industry is what we hope to find everywhere we go. The time we spent at BJ's was well spent and hope to visit again soon."
Celia M.,"Ceres, CA",6,20,5,1.0,7/19/2017,"Worst customer service I brought my employee staff to lunch it took a minute for us to get our drinks we got the appetizers pretty fast but our sandwich and flat bread pizza took longer than expected and nobody came to refill our drinks at the and we asked for a refill on my daughters to go cup The server never came so we just left !!! Bad service ,,"
Nathan M.,"Modesto, CA",1,32,,1.0,7/28/2017,"Boo on chains, if we as diners & hopefully travelers. We will have the same strip malls spread across our nation, an huge one with Couture exactly what we can imagine, look at how big our country as compared to Europe and how much you would expect the cuisine to change, if we continue to frequent places like this or god for bid The Olive Garden we will know nothing of the people who have lived there, the food that they made, the lives they lived and the happiness enjoyed I employ you move on kill the blood sucking heartless fakes forever.... mom & pop. Always"
Rob M.,"Turlock, CA",4,171,107,4.0,7/21/2017,"For a ""chain"" restaurant, this place is way above average.  They have an extensive menu with something for everyone.  Their jambalaya is excellent for a non-Cajun restaurant.  They have a lot of beer on tap, but I always try their own.  I'm a big fan of their Jeremiah Red.  Their Blond, Stout, Porter, and Nut Brown Ale are also good.  About the only thing keeping this from 5 stars is the drink/seating wait times.  If there are empty tables all over the place, why do I have to wait 15 minutes before I'm seated?  Also, good luck trying to get a drink at the bar when all the bar seats are taken.  They need a better system for ordering/delivering drinks.  Even when we were finally seated at our table, our drink orders took way too long to arrive."
Karrah F.,"Modesto, CA",85,3,,1.0,8/7/2017,Ordered takeout to pick up. I live about 15 mins from the restaurant. They told me it would take 25 mins for the food. I arrived at BJs 25 mins after I placed my order. The woman informed me it would be another 5 mins after paying for my order in cash. It really was a 10 min wait which I don't really mind. (I understand cause I used to work in the food industry). What upset me is when I got home I was missing the fries I was supposed to receive with my sandwich. I would expect after waiting 35 mins for my food that I would have everything I ordered. I called back the restaurant to inform them they forgot my fries and asked if they delivered by chance. Which they don't. I didn't want to drive back 15 mins for fries and they couldn't refund my money unless I went back to the restaurant since I paid in cash. First time and last time getting pick up from BJs
Alice M.,"Ceres, CA",0,4,,1.0,6/14/2017,Had wonderful service from the person that passes out the food but the actual  server took over an hour to deliver our order. Server acted like it was normal to wait this long.  She was one of a few full time servers who seems to take her full time status for granted.  I've worked customer service for a long time and find this unacceptable.  Food was room temperature upon arrival.  Have always enjoyed the food here but will not be returning to this location.  I always start my restaurant visit assuming a 30 percent tip and doc tips with major errors.  This went down to ten percent.  Two hours elasped from seating to receiving tab.  I was having a great day until this happened.
Amanda F.,"Newman, CA",0,5,2,1.0,6/9/2017,I've been to BJ's many times and it was good food. I'm not sure what changed but today's visit was pretty bad. My silverware was dirty to start with. My salad was wilted and just didn't taste good and when they brought our meals out we were very disappointed. My French dip was about 80 percent fat. By the time I picked the huge chunks out of my sandwich there wasn't much left. I finally decided that it was enough to complain about and the waitress was very nice and had the sandwich taken off of the check. The experience was enough that I won't be going back again.
John A.,"Modesto, CA",1,100,8,3.0,7/8/2017,"Cool looking place with huge tv screens.  Group friendly and very busy mall eating.  The food is a bit expensive for what you get and the food is ok, but good for strip mall type restaurant."
Jamie L.,"Modesto, CA",4,33,12,1.0,2/29/2016,"Something has changed at BJ's. I haven't been to this location in some time, I came here with my coworkers for the lunch specials, we had an hour lunch break. It was not very crowded and we were seated quickly, that was the only good thing about this lunch. The sever was friendly at best, took a while to get our drinks and orders placed. This place was really dead yet the service so slow, by that time only 2 out 4 people at my table had gotten their food and our lunch break was ending soon. We had to get our food to go before we even ate it. My coworker got a salad that had no dressing and a soup that was lukewarm, it took more time sending those items back. I don't like to give a bad review but our lunch just sucked. Slow service for food that wasn't worth it. I don't think I'll be back anytime soon. I do like BJ's though so I might try a different location."
Cadence E.,"Modesto, CA",64,37,,4.0,6/26/2017,"This location is like many others, great atmosphere, great food. However 9 times out of 10 I'm usually there for quite awhile waiting on either the food to be done cooking or to speak to a manager. I have walked out after waiting well over an hour for my food including my appetizer, then asked to speak to a manager and waiting for a very long time for him. Service is usually good, I especially love Ramtin, he was my server the last two times and he is very kind very upbeat and speedy with his service. I think that the kitchen is usually going down, or low staffed because it does take them awhile from time to time. Almost always I have a great experience though."
Joann T.,"Modesto, CA",1,7,,2.0,5/20/2017,Went there for lunch. Had the Kale and Roasted Brussel Sprouts salad.  It was tasty but only counted 6 half very small Brussel Sprouts.  It was disappointing. The service was quick but our waitress kept coming over to our table every few minutes to see if we needed anything. Very disruptive!!! She came by 3 time to see if we paid the bill yet while we were still eating and that's besides all the other times she stopped. Won't be going back any time soon.
Jacob K.,"Sonora, CA",22,6,15,1.0,10/11/2017,"Walked into a pretty much empty restaurant for lunch at 11 am, asked to be seated at a booth but was told no because they didn't have enough servers on yet so was taken to the back of the restaurant where they have all the large parties. Was sat at a dirty food stuck on from last night table and the hostess didn't care. I know she was wearing glasses but couldn't be that blind. It was literally covered in salt and dried colored tortilla chip strips. We moved to the table next to it in the corner, even though there we're PLENTY of clean booths available in the main dining section. RIDICULOUS!!! Also their was a hair in our desert... everything was gross..they don't care."
Carmen A.,"Tracy, CA",0,3,1,1.0,7/24/2017,"This was my first time at BJ's and I was really excited to try it.When I put my name on the waiting list the hostess sat 3 other parties before my party of 4, meanwhile I had arrived before those 3 other parties and 2 of those parties were larger parties then my mine. Anyhow when sat we were introduced by one server whom got our drinks and appetizers. I had ordered a soup with wings and my soup arrived first before our drinks then after that came the wings. Anyhow after that a different server came and took our order and I was confused because should I have had the first server ? That server didn't go on break or go home I saw him after I left. So was it that he didn't want to serve my table? And it was not a busy night FYI. Anyhow my server didn't seem so pleased to be serving us either which made me feel more like a bother than a customer. We waited a really long time for our food to come out. It was as if they forgot about running our food out to us. When I got my sirloin it was warm not hot my asparagus was cold and my mash potatoes were cold as well. I didn't say anything once again because I had already waited a long time for my food to come out. dessert was good however when he dropped the bill off he didn't discount the half off pizza since it was Monday night their and had charged us regular price I had him correct that for me. But overall my dinning experience was not pleasant."
Kimberly U.,"Modesto, CA",48,8,,4.0,7/22/2017,"Always good food, Haven't had anything Ideast. like.. With the EAT24 appjget your restaurant quality food from BJ's delivered to your home."
Hannah P.,"Salida, CA",34,3,,1.0,5/21/2017,"I would give this place a better review, but every time we are here we have horrible service. We had a party of 12. I understand that it can be hard to deal with a large group. My daughter, husband and I ordered first. Then everyone else ordered. Then everyone's food arrived except for my 6year old daughter and my husband. I tried several time to get the attention of a member of the wait staff. All just walked away. No one would even glance at our table to see if everything was okay. No one checked on us. I couldn't get the attention of a waiter that was right behind me. I finally just yelled, ""will some one help us"". Oh, all of a sudden they come running. The food was out in two minutes. Then our tags were wrong. We were there for two hours. Most of it just waiting for things, food, tags, comps... This is the worst experience I have ever had. I WONT BE COMING BACK!!!"
Sara D.,"Austin, TX",0,3,,1.0,5/17/2017,"This was by far the worst service I've ever experienced on a slow weekday night, after the dinner rush. It took 15 minutes to get drink orders, 20 minutes for our app. It took well over 40 minutes to receive our meals, and the steak one of us ordered had been left under the heat lamp so long it was rubbery and over-cooked. They did replace the meal, but it took another 25 minutes to get the replacement. The beers we ordered were flat, and after a marathon 2.5 hours, we finally escaped.  TLDR: the service was terrible, food and beers were messed up, and the replacement orders took way longer than they should have."
