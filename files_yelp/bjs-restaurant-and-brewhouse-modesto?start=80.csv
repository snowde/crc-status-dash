Kevin L.,"Oakland, CA",22,28,,2.0,4/26/2017,BJ's at this location is really bad. Waited so long for them to give me utensils my pasta was cold. Texture of the noodle was like plastic.
Susan N.,"Modesto, CA",4,2,2,2.0,7/19/2017,"So I ordered a kid's size pizookie to-go today and this is what I received. Not sure if this is what it usually looks like since this was my first time ordering a kid's size pizookie, but I'm guessing (and hoping) that that's not what it's supposed to look like.. Hoping for the latter because I really do love their pizookies!"
Omar C.,"Modesto, CA",6,37,,3.0,7/3/2017,Are these chain restaurants pretty much the same - or at least supposed to be?  I've been to a few and this one is no different from the others.
Thong T.,"Garden Grove, CA",52,22,78,4.0,5/27/2017,Lots of beer selections. Love the deserts menu. I didn't see much selection on the beef though =|
Mak K.,"Modesto, CA",0,13,,3.0,7/16/2017,"Something weird always happens when i go here lmao. The first time I guess the pizza oven caught on fire and we waited 2 hours for our deep dish, but there was 7 of us so we were chillen. They were nice enough to give it to us for free. The second time our waitress spilled our drinks everywhere in front of our table. The food is always a hit or a miss. Meaning it will be delicious or, just eh. Good place, but you never know what will happen. The staff is great."
Amy P.,"Coalinga, CA",18,12,23,2.0,12/17/2016,"Had dinner here on a Saturday night. Got there before 5 pm and it wasn't too crowded. They have an extensive 20 page menu which was all sticky and gross. They also have a kids' menu. My kids got the pizza and mini corn dogs. We asked for that to be put in right away and it came out in a timely fashion along with our calamari appetizer which lacked a little flavor. 30 minutes later we still didn't have our entrees. The server was nice and apologetic saying that their system was down, so that's what was causing the delay, but 45 minutes to get food is unacceptable. Steak was on the dry side and Super Salad was fine. Nice selection of drinks but would not go here again, though convenient to mall."
David S.,"Los Angeles, CA",49,49,21,2.0,6/18/2017,"Ok this is an edit from a previous rating. I am dropping them from a 4 star to a 2 star...let me explain. Two times in a row this location has had some kind of communication problem that left us waiting for food longer than expected. The food is very good, service is great and they have comp'd us both times admitting their error. The first time the error led to others getting their food ahead of us even though we were there first. My wife and I ate while my son waited. The second time on Father's Day the waitresses tablet froze and I got my food before my wife and son. All 3 meals came out at separate times. We could not eat as a family. I appreciate them comping the tickets both times, but probably will not visit this location again!"
Samantha S.,"Fresno, CA",0,1,,2.0,7/9/2017,"I would give them 2 stars because my food was decent and my waiter tried his best. However the service was so slow and our server took way too long with the orders and our salad came with our food even though he asked and said would come out before. We also sat and waited for 20 minutes asking for the check twice, come to find out our waiter went on a break before giving us the check. Two tables left without being served in the short time we were there just because we were waiting so long and they didn't seem that busy."
Val E.,"Delano, CA",0,1,,2.0,7/9/2017,(GP) Deserves 4% tip.... Poor service.... Slow service.... Dirty spoon ... Poor customer satisfaction....
Mike B.,"Modesto, CA",151,6,,1.0,2/13/2017,"Having to give this place one star makes me cringe. I've been here dozens of times and have never had a good experience here. All of my friends know that suggesting BJs for dinner will result in a fight because of how completely shitty this place is. It's been years since the last time I set foot in here and time has not helped. The whole time I was sitting here wondering how the hell did I end up here.  It's my cousins birthday and we have a table of 10 people. I understand that larger parties take a while to get seated and for our food to come out but out experience was ridiculous. Not only did we have to wait over an hour and a half for a table on a MONDAY night but it took over 20 minutes for someone to even ask us what we want to drink.  Anyways, we order our drinks and then appetizers. I had the best (worst) beginnings. My table was convinced that everything was picked off of half eaten plates and put together. It was cold and stale. Whatever we were so hungry we didn't even say anything. Then comes our food, let's forget about how long it took to finally get to us. The food was cold and nasty. Two of our friends were told they were out of what they ordered. Of course they waited until everyone's food was out to say something. My friends didn't want to wait and just said they didn't want anything. I could barely swallow my burger because of how dry my throat was. Whatever. We dealt with it. We were there for almost 4 hours. I don't even understand how a place can give such shitty service. NEVER AGAIN. NEVER."
Dani E.,"Oakdale, CA",1,4,,2.0,10/1/2017,"Our order was wrong, Megan the waitress never checked on us, drinks never refilled, wedge salad had the large stem still attached, and the utensils were dirty. Terrible experience."
Joshua O.,"Fresno, CA",367,3,,4.0,5/13/2017,"Food was pretty good, as usual. Had a few service issues early on in the meal but Chris made it right and went above and beyond to ensure we enjoyed the rest of our meal. After nearly 3 hour drive to visit my in-laws he made sure my wife and I enjoyed the visit. Thank you!"
Lindsay K.,"Vail, CO",462,28,8,2.0,5/24/2017,Service was horrible! I sat for 20 mins with my food and literally no beverage of any kind. Literally dying of thirst!
Christina M.,"Escalon, CA",0,8,,3.0,6/14/2017,Food is normally delicious but today our soups and some of our meals were cold but the service is wonderful and they kept our drinks filled
Dave N.,"Woodbridge, CA",14,66,398,4.0,1/19/2016,"Got here early before the lunch crowd and was seated immediately. We were seated in a huge booth for ourselves. Our server was very friendly and took our order quickly. The food came out in a reasonable amount of time. I went with the Parmesan Crusted Chicken to compare it with the one here in town. My girl went with a mini vegetarian pizza and we both split wedge cut fries. Their french fries are good. She suggested them. If you're eating a vegetarian meal and want good fried food, try the wedge fries! By the time our food came out, the restaurant was starting to fill up with more and more people. The lunch crowd was finally arriving! Luckily we were well into our meal to where our ticket wasn't put into a queue with a lot of people in front of us. My food tasted the same as the Stockton location. They even slack by giving you a tiny portion of broccoli. I've always joked about there being a shortage of broccoli in the back at the Stockton Location. I can confirm it's standard to ship this dish out with a small amount of vegetables. I asked to get a side of broccoli to get a good portion of veggies with my meal. Instead of looking at the plate and acknowledging the short portion, she didn't have a problem charging me around $4 for the side of broccoli (photographed below).  Complaining aside, the food tasted fine. Neither of us had a problem with the staff, and the waiting time was minimal for our food, getting seated, and getting our drinks. This place is clean inside and they're in a great location to get a lot of foot traffic (by the malls in Modesto). I wouldn't mind stopping by and visiting again in the future."
JennMurder C.,"Merced, CA",0,8,1,3.0,6/12/2017,"Been here a couple times... food is great every time, service is not so great.. I mean it's a Monday afternoon, this place is really not busy and our waitress sucks!!! Took forever to get our beers, appetizer, and I'm sorry but it bothers me that I ask for ranch when I order and have to re ask for it every single time my food is delivered... I mean wouldn't you write that down?! Moral of the story is great food, shitty service!"
Michael T.,"Modesto, CA",43,37,1,3.0,2/3/2017,Servers here are generally great. What seems to be falling short is the food prep staff and the host area. The hostess here are either happy and pleasant or they seem annoyed yet smiling (because it's their job)? Next a string of bad / not well made food over my last few visits has me questioning this place. While the managers always rectify the situation I would think it's better to just get it right the first time then have to shell out free food because the second time was a mess as well. Overall I'd still return here because when they are on point they are awesome. I'll try to update things when I return.
Nick G.,"Stanislaus, CA",100,40,27,2.0,2/4/2017,"Service was extremely slow, we had 7 different servers come to our table, we got cold queso dip, it took 40 min to get our first order of drinks, our salads came before our drinks and we were brought 4 meals that we did not order... although seemingly incompetent the wait staff was friendly enough and the food wasn't bad. All in all I won't be going back"
Sonia K.,"Modesto, CA",67,93,5,1.0,2/14/2017,"Steak was totally overcooked. Asparagus was dried up and flakey.  They messed up our drink orders, and they got my son's order wrong too. It wasn't even that busy, but the staff was slow, and spent a lot of time hanging out gossiping with eachother, rather than serving customers. We ended up spending $65 and left hungry and disappointed."
Larry R.,"Modesto, CA",0,2,,1.0,3/5/2017,"The poorest experience I've ever had at a BJs. It started off with little things. The waitress forgot to put my root beer order in so I'm waiting and waiting, no sugar for my wife's ice tea. Waiting and waiting. The manager comes over to break the news that they are out of spinach for my wife's salad, we substatute mixed greens, no biggie, but still no sugar. We tell the manager and she brings it. Another 10 min and a reminder and I finally get my root beer.         Dinner arrives and my daughter's order is completely wrong. Waitress takes it back, then brings the plate back to the table to munch on the sides while we waited. Waiting... waiting....waiting. The waitresst hen asks us if we are ready for dessert??? WTF??? Can we get our dinner first? She says she'll check on it. Waiting... Waiting... Waiting... She then approaches the table and asks again if we have thought about dessert??? Are you EFFING kidding me!?!?!? My with now expresses how frustrated she is that my daughter still hasn't gotten her dinner. The waitress says ""oh yeah"" and goes back to the kitchen. Comes back with the proper plate as the table was being cleared.       She didn't even recognize that something was wrong. The manager came over about some lettuce but couldn't address an issue like this. I was amazed at the incompetence. Really turned me off of BJs. Probably for good"
