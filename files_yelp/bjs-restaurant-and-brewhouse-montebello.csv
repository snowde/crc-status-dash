Kristina K.,"Montebello, CA",43,84,17,4.0,12/28/2017,"Dined in after a very long hiatus and was pleasantly surprised by their revamped menu. Some signature items were still available along with a broader range of burgers, tacos, pasta plates, and other varied selections. I went with the classic Cali chicken club and the rest of our table went with some flat bread pizza, Turkey burger, shrimp plate, tacos, and the appetizer plate. Everything tasted great and was as expected. Loved the fries since I wasn't into the former wedge and thin fries they used to offer. Pizookies are always on point!  Service was really great and he was so patient with our group. Some of the helping staff was a bit clumsy and not as friendly, but I couldn't do what they do, so not judging.  Overall we had a good time! I recommend getting to the restaurant around 6pm for dinner so the wait isn't as long."
Carmik T.,"Gilbert, AZ",67,382,737,3.0,10/8/2017,"Not the service we generally receive from BJ's. Came in to dine about 6PM. A 25 min wait.  Our server took our drink orders. I asked for a water with lemon, that request wasn't followed through. We started with the chicken wing appetizer. Very  late arriving to our table. Meals ordered were the BJ's Brew Burger, The Pork Chop and the kids meal ( for bigger appetites)  Chicken & Rice. Our meals arrived and they brought the wrong kids meal?! It was a Alfredo Pasta instead of what she originally ordered. Chefs had to remake our daughters meal & by the time it arrived,  we were half way done with ours! They didn't comp it, nor did we get drinks replenished through out our dinner. Many delays from service to cooking staff.  Hostess station seemed to have been running smoother' Food was good. Unfortunately, we were a little disappointed in the over all experience."
Juan H.,"Pico Rivera, CA",350,212,89,4.0,10/4/2017,"The family and I came in on a Saturday afternoon. My daughter had just finished up a performance that was given by Simon Mall in honor of Hispanic Heritage Month.  We decided to go to Bj's since it has been awhile that we've been there. We were seated fairly quickly as it did not look busy. There were some tables that had large parties but it seemed manageable. Our server was Maria and although she was great at helping us with our son's order, her overall attentiveness was lacking. Again I don't know if she was tending to one of those other larger parties, but I must stress, when she did give us the attention, she was awesome. We ordered calamari and were impressed at the sauces and flavor of this dish. The kids ordered their own pizza and as I said earlier, Maria was very accommodating with my son (he's 2) in ordering a pan style pizza rather than a deep dish. We also had some wings with two sauces. The wife and I got a burger each and it was very filling. Overall we will come back and patronize. Anytime you can spend with family is time well spent."
Abel B.,"Los Angeles, CA",396,84,1363,4.0,11/9/2017,I felt like not eating at home.  I live in East Los Angeles and without a doubt there is great food all over.  But I was feeling a bit more commercial last night so we decided on BJ's.  Aside from having poor service in other BJ's this one has certainly provided good service every time we have visited.   I had a pulled pork and bacon burger which was too much for me to finish.  The offered unlimited fries for $10.  It was a deal.  I noticed that the fries are air fried which is good if your heart conscience.    Anyways this spot has always been good to me so it comes highly recommended.  Food and beer always good here!
Char B.,"Yucaipa, CA",73,86,65,3.0,1/8/2018,Very disappointed with my top sirloin steak. I will not order steak again at BJs. It was not hot and very dry and super peppery. It tastes like a reheated steak. I literally inly had 2 bites. The  ribs are good but if they are going to have them on the menu they really should provide finger wipes. It seems standard. White Peach margarita was way too sweet and syrupy. I couldn't drink it. Baked potato was cold. I love BJs but this meal made me sad.
Brian P.,"Montebello, CA",32,92,171,4.0,9/12/2017,My reviews solely based on the food because it seems like everyone that's leaving reviews are throwing shade on the workers. Place is usually pretty packed on the weekends but if your eating out in Montebello the choices are pretty limited. For large parties I suggest you make reservations or come early and put your name down and browse around the mall. The restaurant has a lot of drunk patrons as well so if that's not the environment that you anre seeking with your family than this isn't your place. Pizzas are really good especially the thin crust. Jambalaya is a bit pricey but that would be my all time favorite! Their beers are awesome and fresh because obviously they brew in house. Overall not too bad unless you have high expectations so just go in and grab a brewski and relax. Life is as hard as you want it to be.
Pete B.,"Long Beach, CA",377,407,2246,3.0,7/31/2017,"Went here for lunch, I hesitated long and hard before I ordered the half rack of short ribs.   I kept thinking are going to be awesome or just OK.   The ribs here we're good and my side order of Brussels sprouts was a little too peppery for my taste The Caesar salad that I got as a side order was the favorite part of my lunch.   The Caesar dressing was the best I had in years.   I don't know if they make it here but its really good. I'm definitely coming back for a chicken Caesar salad on my next visit."
Rosie S.,"Central LA, Los Angeles, CA",0,26,4,3.0,12/29/2017,Long wait time but service and food was delicious. Drinks were ok too. I would make reservations ahead. Parking is an issue at this location.
Irene S.,"Rosemead, CA",0,11,10,5.0,12/8/2017,"My boyfriend and I just had a wonderful experience at this BJ's location last night. Our waiter, Brian D., went above and beyond with his services. We enjoyed his upbeat personality and appreciated his great suggestions as we struggled to decide what to get on the menu. As busy as he was, we were surprised at the amount of times he came to check on us (take it easy sir!). The food we got was also DELICIOUS~ the honey sriracha brussel sprouts, the rib eye steak (holiday combo deal), calamari and pizookie~yummm! Thank you again BRIAN, you are awesome!"
Larry H.,"Los Angeles, CA",119,352,32,5.0,9/13/2017,"Well, for the first time ever, I was pleasantly surprised on our visit to this BJ's in Montebello. We came for lunch and we were seated swiftly.  Our waitress  Kristian was friggin 'AWESOME'!!!!  I have NEVER had as good as service at any BJ's as we did with Kristian in Montebello.   Kristian was extremely warm, polite, made sure everything was perfect and it was genuine, not an act.  I told her that the entire BJ's staff should be trained by her for customer service and how to interact with customers.  Simply the best!!!! We ordered our food and we tailored it to our liking and it came out as ordered to perfection.  This has 'NEVER' occurred at a BJ's for me. The Prime Rib dip was perfect with the sauteed onions and green bell peppers.  Made it close to a Philly sandwich.  It was perfect at all levels.  Taste, consistency, exactly enough onions, and peppers as asked for.  The salads were also done as we requested, perfect. The chicken club was also made as ordered and was delicious.  On this visit, it appeared to be that the QA was finally being watched at this establishment which was so refreshing. Good food, AWESOME service = great customer experience at BJ's!  A recommendation to BJ's management, get Kristian in a lead role to train your staff.  Kristian gets it!!!  IT is hard to find, don't lose her!  :)"
Jeff L.,"San Marino, CA",130,337,833,4.0,4/3/2017,"This BJ's is in the Montebello mall.  It's fairly big and there's tons of pokestops in reach for all you pokemon trainers that are still playing.  This is a pretty standard BJ's, food is great.  The pizzas are great, the pizookies are a must get dessert.  Their sandwiches and other dishes are also really good so they're worth trying if you're not in the mood for pizza.  I got the California chicken club this time and it wasn't bad at all.  The sandwich is what it sounds like, chicken club sandwich with avocado.  It came with a side of fries.  I would also recommend their root beer too which is worth trying out. On occasion they'll have a 2 for $x however much it is now, and that's usually a pretty good deal, you get a soup/salad, medium pizza, and a pizookie.  So be sure to take advantage of that deal whenever they have it. Download their app and you can make reservations through it.  You can always call ahead as well, since they get pretty busy you won't have to wait as long.  There always seems to be a wait here so being able to skip the line is always a plus.  Apparently you can also pay for you bill directly at the table as well so that's another benefit that our waitress informed us about."
Casey B.,"Temecula, CA",84,27,7,2.0,12/18/2017,"Normally the service isn't the greatest but tonight I encountered not 1 but 2 rude waiters/waitress' like really? You work in a fast pace environment that's always busy in the evenings and esp sporting events, if you can't handle the heat take ur crabby ass elsewhere! We came here to spend money not be treated like shyt because you guys are busy and nobody has even noticed us sitting here for 20mins. (Had to go to the bar and order our drinks separately!) asks I wanted was an appetizer sorry to burden you with my business!) anyway if the beer wasn't so awesome I definitely wouldn't bother coming here"
Nichole R.,"Fullerton, CA",65,13,10,2.0,1/5/2018,"Came in on a Friday afternoon with my mom sister and our kids (party of 10 total; 3 adults, 1 teen, 5 children, 1 toddler) were told wait would be 10-15 minutes as they had to set up table. 20 minutes later still not called so I asked how much longer, 10-15 more minutes because  the server for our table are was on break? At this point the kids were hungry we didn't want to go elsewhere and wait another 30 minutes so we waited. 20 minutes later again we ask what the hold up was and we were told the server still wasn't back and ""they must be running late"". How the heck is that our fault. At this point our toddler was screaming and kids were very hungry and inpatient as we watched at least 10 other parties get seated. I asked for the manager and as soon as I asked for him we were seated. Manager apologized but the kids were already freaking out hungry, fussy, and we were so frustrated it really ruined our experience. 2 stars because our server Brandi was very nice and brought out ""children's starters"" right away for the crying, hungry, toddler (she was very friendly very quick and did great) but we were already left with a sour taste in our mouths after the terrible service. Sorry BJs Montebello u guys really need to improve ur service."
Teresa G.,"Rosemead, CA",0,41,8,1.0,9/30/2017,Wow!!! So the general manager only acknowledges the good reviews. I notice I left a bad review 21 days ago. Wasn't even acknowledged. A good review was left 12 days ago & the general manager replied.  To: general manager  You should acknowledge all your reviews. Good or bad. Especially the 1 stars to find out what you can do to improve  your restaurant. Or what you can do to bring the people who gave you 1 star back to your restaurant.  I just checked my messages. Sorry... you did not send me a private message on 9/16. You must have forgotten to hit the send button. Have a good day
Ken K.,"Jacksonville, FL",24,289,23,2.0,8/30/2017,"OK - 1st off, I hate Yelp reviews that ding staff  too much (The server did not make eye contact, yada yada, yada....) and don't focus on food, because as long as you're not blatantly rude, I don't care. BJ's was blatantly rude. I travel on business, and don't drink on the road (being in and out of germ tubes knocks down immunity, and I always get sick if I drink on the road) - I walked into a 3/4 empty BJ's and asked for a small table...The hostess asked if I wanted to sit at the bar, I said no (What's the use of being in a bar if you're not drinking? I just wanted a quiet meal) She then said, you're by yourself, are you sure you don't want to just sit at the bar? No, miss....I'm 46 years old, and quite certain I know where I want to sit.... So I get a table......and wait....after what seems to be @5 minutes with no one coming over, I set my timer and thought to myself, ""I'll give this place 5 minutes"" At 4:26 (now @10 minutes) someone finally came over - I ordered a diet coke and a flatbread. Diet coke came, someone other than my server brought flatbread (very good, BTW)......I sat with my rapidly empting diet coke with no interaction from server at all - for @15 minutes - server finally came, with check, asking if I wanted a refill, by this time, didn't bother... said no thanks - she drops check - full price for flatbread (1/2 off on Mondays....) - she snootily agrees with me, comes back with corrected check.  Now I know 1 guy, no drinks taking a table not good for a server - I would usually tip 25% of full price - but in this case, gave 15 and left. As for the food, meh - decent - chili's food with a lot of different beers."
Ray R.,"Alhambra, CA",576,86,617,4.0,4/5/2017,"This is my go to place for a descent cold beer and great eats.One of my favorites are the brunettes,and the Blondes.Im talking about beers.I love the nutty brunette so much I married one.The small appetizers are my favorite you gotta grab a few of those.The stuffed mushrooms are my favorite.Bjs is all good at Montebello.The staff at the bar is fantastic,and there always looking to pour you another pint.We had a chance to go the other night on free poozookie night,what a treat!4 stars."
Andy N.,"West Covina, CA",163,36,164,1.0,9/25/2017,"This the worst service I ever been, appetite I ordered was wrong I asked for rib but come out boneless chicken wings. And take forever to get drinks, meatball spaghetti too much oil the meat I can even describe how bad it all fall in part no favors. I want have them to take back but the servers is too busy with other three tablets. I when to so many BJ's this one is the worst ever never going back again."
Vincent Artemio E.,"Monterey Park, CA",66,126,624,5.0,9/19/2017,BJ's is an ideal place to meet with your friends especially after work. It's also an appropriate place to meet for a first date because the menu is geared towards small meals or large entrees or simply drinks. It's easy to slip in and sit near the bar or wait for a booth or larger table. The menu is a bit inflated in that there are too many choices. I usually order a seared salmon salad which is always fresh and delicious. The dishes here are not overly prepared or massively proportioned but there are so many choices that you have a difficult time choosing exactly what to order. The service here is excellent. The one time our order was late (very late) the manager came out and explained and apologized to us and provided us with a complimentary item. It was a very busy night and I appreciated that the manager took the time to see that we were satisfied and not feeling neglected. Recommended but prepare for a wait during peak times.
Gracie A.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,70,21,4.0,11/14/2017,"Happy hour Mondays and 1/2 off pizza. I crave the gf pizza w an ice cold Berry Burst Cider, yum. I always enjoy this BJs restaurant better than all others. Staff, James is super friendly and cheery. Always a pleasure to be served by him. And Gabriel , he was super helpful and went out of his way to accommodate my request. I suggest more gluten free options and if the happy hour specials also include the gf items, that would make it more amazing. Overall, love it"
Rosquete B.,"Belmont, CA",17,950,366,4.0,9/2/2017,4* BJ's Montebello Very nice Happy Hour The staff were very friendly and helpful (vast improvement over a previous visit) The salads are excellent The lunch combos are a great value Nice beers by the glass
Victoria R.,"Valencia, CA",0,15,2,1.0,11/13/2017,I called to place a pick up order and the guy transferred me and left me on hold for 6 minutes and I finally hung up and called back. Then i was on hold for another 5 min so I gave up and placed the order online. I got there after the food was supposed to be ready by and no one greeted me and the food still wasn't ready. When I got the food the chicken was disgusting and cold and there was a piece of cilantro in the ice cream.
Oscar B.,"Monterey Park, CA",0,2,,1.0,12/8/2017,Waited 40 minutes supposedly to get seated. Ask the front desk how much longer. Said half an hour more people don't want to leave. They could have text and said it's going to be a while.. never again at this BJ's
yoonji l.,"Los Angeles, CA",70,39,,1.0,8/9/2017,The hostess today was by far the rudest.  I've never had an encounter with one as bad as her.  It wasn't even busy and we were not rude so I don't know what her problem was.  She should work in the back.  Our food came out 45 minutes later.  It was just a pizza and salad.  People who sat after us got their meals before us of course.  The waitress said it's because pizza takes time.  Then the pizza should be HOT. NOT COLD.
Maria C.,"Walnut Park, Los Angeles, CA",22,35,35,3.0,11/26/2017,Slow service! We had to scarf down our meals and had to take the delicious Oreo Pizookie to go because we ran out of time. We waited 40 minutes for our food. I recommend the Downey location instead.
Anthony H.,"Los Angeles, CA",45,1,1,1.0,8/3/2017,"To be honest one of the worst experience I have ever received at a resturant. Our server seemed uninterested in attending us let alone take out order. The food came out in an odd order. We got apps 25 mins later one entree and 30 mins later the last two entrees. I joined the member program and to be honest only thing that gave me service. We used a coupon code to get our free pozoki and we never received it. Had another code for $10 off and it wasn't applied. Had to walk to the host stand to get my check from the supervisor. When I toled him about our experience and our service all he did was apply the code I presented. No other action was taken. Food 1/10, service I can't rank because we didn't receive any. Overall experience we won't be back."
Angela R.,"Los Angeles, CA",227,4,,1.0,7/19/2017,"So I've never had complaints about this location until now. My brother and I got there and it was fine, we ordered our appetizer and we waited 30+ minutes for ALMOST cold chicken wings. We let it slide, it's a busy day. But it was not the end, our waiter also barely attended us to ask if everything was okay or if we needed anything really. Anyways, we ordered our dessert, 1 macadamia nut pizookie and 1 churro with ice cream which took another 30 minutes which was delivered by someone else and the ice cream was looking more like a pool that a solid scoop.  BUT THAT WASNT ALL, when I tried to get a scoop of cookie I began having to stab it and even then it would not come apart. So i had to tell Nicklus our waiter the cookie was super hard and he brought another one. Luckily it wasn't another 30 minutes but rather a bit over 5."
xiomara c.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,7,1,3.0,6/15/2017,"We had the best server James G. This location is so lucky to have him working here, he is attentive and so pleasant, however the kitchen needs a little work we ordered some salads and they gave us so much of the romain ribs that I had to show the manager. The manager was apologetic and pleasant overall"
Donna S.,"Los Angeles, CA",234,443,531,5.0,5/31/2017,BJ's Favorite pizza is always a safe choice here and always good! I also love when BJ's has promotions like a free appetizer with over $10 purchase because it allows me try something new. Make sure to check online for coupons before going so you make the most out of your meal. And definitely join their rewards program so you can earn free menu items or credit.
Diane C.,"Monterey Park, CA",70,1,,2.0,7/20/2017,"I started patronizing BJ's in1999 at their Westwood location when I would order lunch for our office staff 2-3 times a week.   At the time, although they'd mess up the order 75% of the time and offer a free lunch the ""next time"", which was an awesome deal for the office, pretty much all of the salads were excellent, especially the Garden Medley Salad with Blackened Chicken. Sat at the bar last night and ordered their Santa Fe Entree Salad with Blackened Chicken.  The lettuce in the salad consisted ONLY of the Ribs of Romaine, no leaves!!!  Who the heck does that?  While I realize they may use the leaves for burgers and sandwiches, I hardly think that the remaining ribs should be all I get for $13.75!  I saw a photo on another review of a salad with only the romaine ribs too, who in management decided to tell their cooking staff to do this?  Really poor decision... I think yesterday was the last time I'll ever consider ordering an overpriced salad with poor ingredients here again.  In fact, maybe I'll just go with drinks at the bar, at happy hour or, maybe NOT!"
Angelica S.,"Anaheim, CA",180,23,1,5.0,11/9/2017,The food and service was exceptional despite us having such a large group. We had a party of 20 and were seated within maybe 10 minutes of arriving. The food cane out fast and was delicious. Thanks everybody!!
Chrystina B.,"West Covina, CA",34,55,100,5.0,11/26/2016,"For my FIRST time ever being at a bjs, I'm so glad it was at this one in Montebello!  Service : 10/10 The food : 10/10  Atmosphere 10/10 I was really shocked!  Since I was a first timer, I decided to order a little bit of everything.  We ordered :  - Appetizer -A mini deep dish pizza (11$) : my only regret was not getting a bigger one lol  -Dinner-12 oz Ribeye w/mashed potatoes, veggies and shrimp. It can with a claim chowder (30$) : The meant wasn't chewy and it was literally cooked and seasoned PERFECT. Also comes with a free pizookie  -Jambalaya (18$)  : spicy and not shy with the chicken and shrimp  -Dessert- warm white chocolate macadamia nut pizookie. Worth every calorie ! My bill was 70$ and worth EVERY cent! I will definitely be back and to this specific location."
Rachel V.,"Montebello, CA",0,1,1,4.0,11/14/2017,"I crave a good salmon plate once in a while and I love their cherry chipotle glaze salmon, it's amazing! If you like beer, their house Hefeweizen taste great. Family friendly place if you have children. Friendly and helpful waitresses:)"
Robert V.,"Monterey Park, CA",401,54,20,2.0,11/14/2017,"Went there for lunch, was in the mood for a pasta. I got the jambalaya, my better half got the chicken and asparagus. We also ordered some avocado egg rolls as an appetizer. The egg rolls are not the same as I remember them. They have a new sauce in them, with like a spicy sour cream flavor. Not good at all. We get our dishes and for some reason hers is actually steaming and mine is barely even warm. The bite I took tasted as if it was coated with black pepper, no other flavor at all. It had a couple bits of sausage and 3 tiny shrimp, I asked the waitress why is it not steaming like her plate? She said I can put it in the microwave for you! I was like ok... While we waited I got a bite from my girls food, it was supposed to be penne pasta, we wondered why there was so much spaghetti noodles in there lol, we left most our food. We will not be going back soon."
Jennifer C.,"Los Angeles, CA",46,132,212,3.0,9/18/2017,"Went to go eat on Sunday night. We saw one family was waiting. I asked the front how long is the wait and she said 20min. Really?! I see a lot of open tables and booth. I guess they were short on staff. We went ahead and got our selves seat at the bar. Bar had couple open booths plus tables. Even though they cleaned the table, there were still crumbs on the table and chairs. We looked at menu for good 5 mins and was waiting for a server to stop by. Couple of sever pass by but none of them stop for us. 15 mins later, server came by to take our order. We figured if we order just drinks, she won't be back for another good 20-30mins so we ordered everything at once.  10 mins later, a male server came by to drop off our appetizer. Appetizer came before the drinks... The drinks didn't even come til 10mins after. I didn't like their hibiscus tea. Didn't taste as I thought it would be. Our food arrived about 20mins after munching our appetizer. The presentation and the quality of the food was decent. Since my food was a little greasy, I needed refill on my drink. I put the empty cup by the corner so that our server can see but non of the server weren't generous enough to ask me if I wanted a refill. Couple mins later our server came back and I told her I would like refill.  Depending on which location you go but this one is not that great."
Ivette G.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,35,9,1.0,8/4/2017,"Having a fever in this 90 degree weather is no fun. I decided to order some delivery from BJS today. Order was placed at 12:53 pm; Which included a clam chowder, some grilled chicken alfredo & a Pepsi. My order was set to arrive at 1:45...it's now 2:15..no call from any BJ's employee or even the delivery driver themselves explaining why they're taking 30 minutes + to deliver.  Update: my order isn't coming. Called the restaurant to cancel my order and get a full refund, the manager was really nice.  Tip: don't order delivery from this BJ's."
Jen H.,"Pico Rivera, CA",1,17,50,3.0,8/6/2017,I use to love the Mac and cheese here but they  DC... Boooo. Totally sucks. Clam chowder is pretty good though. Pizza is good. Nothing special. Sweet potato fries are great here.
Perices M.,"San Diego, CA",0,16,1,5.0,10/5/2017,My experience at this location was amazing. Jessica made everything perfect for me. I was dehydrated and very hungry. I sat instantly right at the bar. She catered to me right away not even there for 5 minutes. Take in mind the entire bar was full. I got a few items off the lunch menu. It was easy and good. She filled my water up every time without me asking. She definitely was on her A game. If you are out on business in Monterey park I definitely suggest you stop at the bar.
Laura S.,"Bell, CA",5,52,59,2.0,4/27/2017,"I have had unpleasant experiences at this Bjs, the times I've been here with friends.  Both times I see that the waiters take on more parties than they should. First time we were there he forgot to bring us our coffee and pzookie we had to ask again.  Second time there Michael was told there was a birthday I think he forgot about us because he just returned to give us our credit cards and that was the last time he was seen at our table. In shorter words please don't take on too many parties, then you provide bad service to others and in my opinion this isn't fair."
Chris C.,"Whittier, CA",2,18,,2.0,6/19/2017,"Came here yesterday for Father's day, which I knew I shouldn't have, but the misses insisted. Wait was about 40 minutes, it was expected. Server was nice and friendly, I chose the jambalaya which he recommended, it was smothered in white onions and too much sauce drenched the rice pilaf. There was powdered pepper all over side of the plate, as if whoever prepared my plate was in a hurry. Was far too spicy for my liking, I couldn't really taste or enjoy. Very little meats. Left more than half the plate, all vegetables and sauce.   I usually don't like coming here because the food isn't the best. Should have gone for a pizza of theirs instead. They did give out a Father's day glass and a 20% VIP card to use NEXT visit. Lol they could've just let you use the 20% for Father's day there and then. Oh well."
Gabby S.,"Los Angeles, CA",54,12,12,4.0,10/17/2017,Glendale great place to have a late night pizza craving. The service was a little slow but overall enjoyed my late night dinner and the fact that it wasn't so crowded.
