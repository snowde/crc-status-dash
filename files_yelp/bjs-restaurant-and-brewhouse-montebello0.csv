Ashley D.,"Los Angeles, CA",118,45,140,3.0,4/26/2016,Food was good but our waiter was very slow with food and drinks. I was done with my food by the time he brought my second drink. I wanted a third but he took to long so i said forget it
Bobby L.,"Downey, CA",0,4,,2.0,1/4/2017,"I got there with a party of 3 at around 10ish on Tuesday night.  Upon arriving, the host was not very nice.  She welcomed us with a half smile and she looked like she was more than ready to go home.  Our server was Nicklus and was very sad to get service from him.  He was very dull and was not very welcoming.  I saw other servers and was ready to ask them for service instead as they looked very happy and were paying attention to their tables.  Nicklus not so much.  As a server, he's suppose to pay great attention to his guests, but man he didn't even give us a refill.  Sure ill come back, but if I get Nicklus again, ill get back on the waiting list or ill get some sbarro from inside the mall."
Julie D.,"Pasadena, CA",144,654,49,4.0,7/10/2014,"Haven't been to this place in like 4 years.  Overall, the service was good but a bit slow on a Friday night, probably due to them being a bit busy.  We waited less than 10 minutes to get a table for two. Due to my baby wrecking havoc on my normal eating habits, we shared a pork chop plate (2 pork chops, green beans, cheesy mashed potatoes), which was pretty solid.  I would have preferred a better apple sauce, though.  We also shared a personal-sized buffalo pizza, which was kind of salty and a touch dry.  Finally, I had a coupon for a pizookie, and we got the salted caramel one since I have tried the others.  I didn't find it that great -- it seemed like a white chocolate macadamia nut cookie with some drizzles of caramel sauce over the ice cream.  It stuck to the plate a lot and wasn't warm and gooey like I had hoped. I like the extensive menu and fun atmosphere, so I'm sure it will be less than 4 years before I return..."
Zahra B.,"Los Angeles, CA",86,35,32,5.0,2/16/2016,Special thanks to Irene ( shift Maneger). professional services.  She came to our table and make sure everything is ok.

Brian F.,"Lakewood, CA",158,270,170,4.0,1/24/2015,"BJ's has always been good to my friend and I. We like to come here after work and relax over a beer and some food. I've seen some very mixed reviews here, but suffice it to say I have never been let down.  Great service. Busy but fun atmosphere. Tasty good at fair prices. Customer service is top notch.  I enjoy the house blond beer. It's crisp and clean. Gives me a nice shopping buzz for when I need to walk off the calories. The food itself has always been great.  I always try something different here which is a great indicator for me.  The menu offers a lot of lighter fare as well, which is respectable.  Great experience from our waitress Jessica. She smiled a lot.  Brought me quick beers. Oh and she checked on us frequently.  That's a huge positive in my book.  I'll be back again for sure."
Andrea E.,"Torrance, Los Angeles, CA",142,9,,2.0,11/29/2016,"No wonder why this location only has 3 starts! Ordered a sandwich and the bread had MOLD on it, when it was brought to their attention they gladly took it back but too my whole plate when I wanted the fries it came with! I asked for the bill and that took a while since they had to take off the moldy sand which! Yuck. I got the bill and they didn't discount anything else or even offer a free dessert. Lucky they are getting 2 starts from me but 2 thumbs down"
Giovanni R.,"Whittier, CA",449,12,1,5.0,2/12/2016,Our server Stephanie went above and beyond her duties always with a smile on her face. Thank you for a great night and service. Leaving the restaurant name on high. Keep it up!
Tina G.,"Pico Rivera, CA",22,26,11,4.0,3/18/2014,"I gave this place 4 stars. Not because of the food but, because of the customer service was awesome! The Tuscany Chicken lemone was way too lemony. Ask for Jessica Y. the Server. Shes a great great server!"
Peter L.,"Temple City, CA",7,33,12,5.0,3/22/2014,"So this is an update from my previous review. Again, Brian has done it again! He made me feel special and happy with his waiter ways. I don't know what it is about him, it's just so cool to have a waiter making you feel so special. At first I had another waiter, who was positive but not the same type of positive. Then I got Bryan!!! He is the exact same positive I wanted and he makes the food taste more better for some reason. Today I got a BJS Favorite Pizza and it was dreamy. When I saw it, my jaw dropped and mouth watered. I couldn't believe something can look so beautiful... AND DELICIOUS! I ate and loved it! Perfection indeed. Then I got the chicken tacos, which were okay just needed pico de gallo. The whole experience is amazing, thanks to Brian!"
Jones T.,"San Francisco, CA",61,1330,5,2.0,7/12/2015,"Service is great but the food isn't very good Shared with friends , tried the pizza, steak , and pasta."
Dub L.,"Mesa, AZ",8,79,328,1.0,4/2/2014,"Ordered and waited over an hour for our food to come out -- actually, the food only came out because we tracked down our non-existent waiter and got the manager involved. Apparently they lost part of the ticket (everything except for the starter salads), didn't know how it happened, and attempted to makeit up by not charging us for the food. If only my party could get our Time back and the two kids at the table that night didn't have to cry from waiting/being hungry. :P   P.s. the angel hair pasta dish is pathetic - it had 5 pieces of broccoli in the whole dish :P I make better pasta in my kitchen for shits and giggles."
Monica L.,"Los Angeles, CA",2357,1171,1522,3.0,11/10/2013,"Come early and expect to wait a while. We came at 6 and the line was already about 30-45 minutes long...I guess there's a lot of early hungry shoppers. The employees were nice and helpful, and the menu selection is extremely vast. I got an ahi tuna salad, and for the most part, it was enjoyable. However, the tiny dabs of wasabi were extremely strong--I know they're dabbed on the sides of the plate, but I didn't see it til I swallowed the first one clinging to a random leaf. I would suggest transforming it into a dressing or doing something else to alleviate the strength of the wasabi--I love wasabi, but this was pretty intense. Also, there were several slices of tuna that tasted overly fishy...to the point where I wanted to gag. I really didn't want to finish the rest of the fish in fear I'd get another bad slice, but I just swallowed and hoped I wouldn't get food poisoning.  The bf got a deep dish pizza, and he LOVED it. The toppings were spread all the way to the edges of the crust, and the fluffy dough complimented the rest of the ingredients perfectly. Verdict? It's okay...moreso for the bf than for me. Personally, I wouldn't want to come again because I keep thinking of those nasty slices of fish, but the bf definitely wants to return. Maybe I will try a different  salad dish with a fully cooked protein this time."
Marcos M.,"Pico Rivera, CA",1,6,,3.0,12/8/2016,"Earlier today I experienced extremely horrible service, and it wasn't the first time either. Not sure why I will come to this BJ's. The moment we got there, we waiting 30 minutes just to order our food. Our server Jessica P. was no where to be found. And when she did come around she was too busy with other tables and flirting with a group of guys. Finally we order and another 30 minutes went by until we received our food which was very good BUT once we were ready for our check, Jessica was once again missing. Finally we asked for it and another 20 minutes goes by until we receive that check. By the time we were completely finished I barely had an hour to shop at the mall. Very very disappointing. My last time going to this BJ's."
Stefanie A.,"Whittier, CA",295,25,5,5.0,2/12/2016,"I love avocado egg rolls but lemme tell you, James made my day. He truly was such a breath of fresh air and so positive. I had a horrible morning and he totally made it better. I wish all the waiters were like him. Thank you James for being one of the most kindest souls"
Angelina B.,"El Monte, CA",3,9,6,1.0,3/12/2015,"Here during  happy hour and was charged regular price for my beer bummer, our waiter was good but his back up got all pissy once we noticed the overcharge.  Sorry for counting my pennies. Will try mot to get beer at this place next time, wait im at a brewery where they specialize in beer"
Ben W.,"Montgomery, AL",37,69,103,3.0,7/27/2015,"Had the Cesar Salad with grilled chicken. Not bad lots of salad... Not much chicken! Everyone in our party was pleased. Others had burgers, pizza and Ahi Tuna salads ... No complaints! 3 Stars for ok... But average! Service was very good!"
Kevin W.,"Whittier, CA",219,2,,4.0,5/1/2016,Great service but the food wasn't that good. I got boneless buffalo wings and they were dry. Jeff was our server and he made us feel very welcome.
