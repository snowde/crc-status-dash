C J S.,"Shafter, CA",0,23,2,3.0,6/4/2017,The food is very good here but the place is not fun to dine at as the place has terrible accoustics which makes conversations difficult. The menu has many options and their tortilla soup and salads are delicious.
Demi C.,"Long Beach, CA",463,5,,4.0,2/8/2017,"Although my boyfriends jambalaya was missing the shrimp, James was an amazing server. He got us a side of shrimp to make up for the missing shrimp. He was so nice and made sure we were happy and feed. I will come back just for his service!!"
Vic C.,"Duarte, CA",107,2372,8712,4.0,1/14/2015,"This BJ's Restaurant is located at The Shops at Montebello (formally the Montebello Mall), specifically located right next to JcPenny.  (Review is for To Go Order only)   Decided to make a to go order for lunch for both my husband and myself this early afternoon. I called to make a to go order before leaving work (I work pretty close by this place) and was told my order would be ready in 15 minutes. This is what we had: Mahi Mahi Tacos- ($9.50 prior to tax) I had the option of having my mahi mahi tacos grilled or fried and decided to opt for grilled (healthier option). This entree comes with 2 tacos and chips (with avocado cream sauce and fire roasted tomato salsa packed in a separate container). I really liked my mahi mahi taco. The chipotle mayo added a little spice to it (which was plenty spicy for this non spicy eating person) but my husband added a bit of sriracha to it. I thought the fish was nice and tender. The shredded Napa cabbage and carrots added a nice crunch to it. The chips were just ""eh"". I have had better chips from the market.  Kale and Roasted Brussels Sprouts Salad- ($9.75 prior to tax) This salad is pretty good with the different flavors and textures. Not only is there kale and roasted Brussels sprouts but also blueberries, sliced red grapes, dried cranberries, candied pecans, chopped cucumbers and toasted pepitas. This salad also comes with goat cheese and red onions but I requested to omit this. I love the sweetness and flavor from the fruit and the strawberry vinaigrette enhances that light sweetness throughout each bite. My dressing automatically came on the side since this was a to go order, but if I dined in, I would normally ask for salad dressing on the side (don't like my salad swimming in dressing... kind of defeats the whole purpose of eating healthy).  When I arrived exactly 15 minutes later (told you I work close to this BJ's location) after I placed my to go order, it took another 10 minutes to pick up my order since there was a person ahead of me making an order and the computer system was moving slow (according to the employee who was helping me with my transaction).  Making my order to go over the phone was easy, along with pick up. I like that you can also have the option of making a to go order online as well, but I didn't want to use my cell phone data to do that for this visit. (They have free, fast WiFi here by the way). Overall, had a fantastic lunch with my husband at a price that was reasonable. Will have to come back for a dine in experience some time."
D M.,"Monterey Park, CA",0,2,,1.0,6/17/2017,"Waited for my take out for over 30min! Server knew my food was ready, but ignored me while I was standing there waiting in plain site. Pretty sad. Asked how long my food was waiting, and she commented she was waiting for my side. Really? It takes 30min for my side dish?? Just BS! 6/17/17 waited 8:50-9:30"
Vince B.,"Covina, CA",52,12,,2.0,6/16/2017,"One of the best parts of on-line order is being able to arrange what time you will be picking up your food.  One of the worst parts of on-line order is when you food isn't ready at the time specified.  I'd arranged for an 11:45 a.m. pickup - paid for it at 11:30, but still had to wait over 10 minutes.  Sure - not the end of the world, but still very frustrating as I had picked the time for specific scheduling, and it was a inconvenience to have to wait."
Fannie B.,"Redondo Beach, CA",25,135,60,1.0,2/9/2017,"Bad service, mediocre food. We were a large group of 20 for lunch. Some people in our group never even received their lunch or drinks. The place was empty so not sure why they could not provide good service. Very sad. Will not return to this location."
Patty L.,"Pico Rivera, CA",1,8,,5.0,5/4/2017,"One of the best customer services, & the food was so yummy. The price is not too overwhelming, either. I'd go again!"
Jose T.,"El Monte, CA",0,2,,4.0,5/19/2017,"My wife and I love to come here for lunch or dinner. We're big fans of the BJ Signature deep dish pizza. But my favs gotta be the pepper BBQ ribs. They got the right amount of ""POW"" to them. Service is great all the time."
Tim M.,"Montebello, CA",202,130,430,4.0,2/22/2016,I've been going here for a few years now since it first opened.. this place always has good food and good service. Typical BJ's food and menu. I like the pizzas  and appetizers. Some of my favorites are the santa fe rolls and stuffed mushrooms.This location has large TV walls and regular and late night happy hour. They also have a good selection of beers on tap along with a full bar. Good place to watch a game and have pizza and beers!
Emiko H.,"Rosemead, CA",253,26,8,1.0,4/1/2017,"My friends and I come to bjs occasionally to do celebrations for birthdays, New Years, and coworker dinner parties. This is the first time ever coming in and leaving with anger and confusion.  We came in on Friday night and was told that our wait was about 20 minutes; but instead, my friends and I waited over an hour to be seated. It didn't really bother us because it was a bit crowded so it was understandable.  But what confused me was that no waiter/waitress came up to let us know that he/she would be serving us that night. We looked around and tried to flag down a server but were ignored countless times. One worker stood by the pos system while the other 5-6 waiters were on the other side near the stairs just talked amongst themselves while they stared at the customers. Excuse me? My friend raised her hand to get service but instead of being attended to , she was completely ignored by the waitress even though we clearly saw her eyed our table. What I don't get was that if she wasn't our server, why couldn't she let our server know that we are ready to order? We sat there for over 30 minutes plus the hour we've waited for our table. We were all hungry and pissed off so we stood up to leave. As we walked out, not one server gave a damn and just watched us leave. What a complete waste of our freakin time. This will be the last time any of  us will be back. We will also be sure to let our friends and family know of our experiences because why should anyone support a restaurant that doesn't care about their customers."
Kevin W.,"Temple City, CA",499,1787,7849,5.0,2/19/2015,BJ's has some pretty good brews! Blonde - $5.25  HopStorm IPA - $5.75 Chicken Ranch Mini Deep Dish Pizza - $6 - Awesome happy hour item. You get a 6 inch pizza of your choice. Chicken ranch was a nice twist on the normal ddp. Crust is good and the cheese that crisps up on the edges was delicious. The ranch drizzle on top added a nice creamy flavor.
Gigi g.,"Los Angeles, CA",201,60,26,1.0,1/31/2017,"Hostess was rude. Did not even acknowledged us. So we  went to the bar area to seat ourselves. When we sat, we were asked for ID. I was with my 19 year old daughter. I know of you serve food in a restaurant you can have minors on a bar area. We just wanted food."
Aer D.,"Park La Brea, CA",6,71,20,1.0,3/2/2017,"Food came at all different times. Do not get the ahi salad. Dressing drenched the wilted leaves, plate was dirty and soiled with grease, ahi tuna smelled fishy, and it was overly vinegary. Pickled cucumbers worsened the dish. Tomato chunks were too huge in size."
Ryan J.,"Tracy, CA",0,11,7,4.0,5/6/2017,Just another BJ's. Nothing special but the bartenders are definitely above average.  This BJ's is located inside the Montebello Mall next to the 60. You cant go wrong with the Parmesan Crusted Chicken.
Carlos R.,"Pico Rivera, CA",0,13,2,4.0,5/1/2017,Very good ambiance. Very good service.  Calamari appetizer very good. Nutty brunette beer & Jeremiah red a must try.
L V.,"Stanton, CA",0,5,,1.0,9/3/2017,"Omg, the service here is sooooo slow. Our server took a long time to get our order and the food took forever to arrive. We also lost our server until the time we have to pay. She did not checked if we need anything. I'm very disappointed with this location"
Elizabeth G.,"Pico Rivera, CA",257,7,,1.0,9/2/2017,"My review is a accumulation of visits into one. This is by far the worst BJ's location. Only thing giving it a star is the conveniency of the location as a meet up point for my friends. Waiters and server are just terrible. One visit, I ordered a mini pazookie took more than one hour to receive it. I had the same waitress twice after that and never had a good dining experience with her. Another visit, we never got a refill on our drinks until after we were done eating. Oh and once we were done eating the table was never bussed. The empty plates sat in front of us for at least 20 minutes before we finally got the attention of our waiter. (We were so kind enough to stack them on top for him *sarcasm) Another visit, the waitress kept forgetting everything, mixed up orders, and etc. The manager even admitted our table wasn't the only one who made a comment. It was not a good experience. So yeah this location is a no for me and has been for awhile. I recommend BJ's Downey location. Best to management."
Orlando S.,"Long Beach, CA",1297,29,1,1.0,12/11/2016,"Tonight I ordered a Kale & Brussel Sprout Salad for take out. I picked it up and when I got home, the shrimp in the salad was ice cold, not blackened as I asked, and there was only four in the salad. I called and was immediately transferred to Ryan the manager. This guy started making excuse after excuse as to why the salad was made wrong and when I asked for my money back, he told me i'd have to get in contact with the general manager. Tomorrow I plan on calling corporate and getting my money back. I will NEVER order from this place again until Ryan is no longer an employee of this restaurant."
Dania D.,"Los Angeles, CA",52,8,1,5.0,4/1/2017,Amazing service! Definitely the best BJ's I been to. My boyfriend and I have date night on Thursday and this is our go to spot. DEF RECOMMEND
Janelle G.,"Monterey Park, CA",52,252,56,1.0,1/1/2016,"This is my first time at this BJ's. The service is HORRIBLE!!!! I couldn't keep track of how many servers helped us. One girl sat us down, another came to our table, who claimed to be our waitress. A few minutes later another waitress came and said she was taking over for our first waitress. We ordered our drinks, which took about 20 minutes to get. Some guy brought out our drinks, another guy brought out my soup, then ANOTHER guy brought out our entrees. My deep dish ziti was not so ""deep."" It was basically a few noodles with a gob of cheese with a cup full of grease on the bottom. The ""waitress"" never came to refill our drinks or ask if we needed anything else.  The tables are ridiculously close together. It can't possibly be safe in there if an emergency happened!!!!  I WILL NOT be returning to this BJ's!!!!"
