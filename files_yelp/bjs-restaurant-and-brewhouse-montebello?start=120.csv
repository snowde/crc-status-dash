Tiffany C.,"Pico Rivera, CA",1,93,31,1.0,2/14/2017,This is the fifth time I ordered to go and the fifth time they messed up my order. I asked for a half and half pizza. Half NO onions and NO olives...well guess what...I opened the box and found onions and olives. Thanks for nothing BJ's. Seriously-get it right.
art D.,"Whittier, CA",89,8,,1.0,3/27/2017,"I was just watching the commercial and wow BJs looks so good! It makes me sad that whenever I try this place the service has been so bad I will never go back again. Last time I was there I ordered a calzone and it was ice cold in the middle and they heated it up twice for me and it was still not cooked all the way. I had to pay a full bill and I did not even touch the calzone I was so grossed out. I couldn't get out of their fast enough, just a very bad vibe. And the service was extremely slow. I hate to complain or write a bad review but that commercial brought back that feeling of bitter disappointment. Hopefully their service has gotten better, but my experience was terrible."
Kenneth S.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,39,127,4.0,8/19/2017,"This is one of my favorite restaurants to visit and have good food and watch the games on tv. The staff is always nice and professional and take great care of us when we visit. We ordered the pepperoni, sausage and mushroom pizza and it was excellent as always. Our server was Kristian and she was nice, had a smile on her face and professional. Looking forward to visiting again."
Lynette V.,"Whittier, CA",0,1,,5.0,8/9/2017,This place was great. The food was amazing I got the fettuccine Alfredo with a side of fries. The fries were the best fries ever. And the pasta was a great size of a lunch special. And the bread it can with was amazing. Will absolutely come back.
Rebecca G.,"Buena Park, CA",117,7,3,1.0,7/1/2017,"Had never been to this location before. My husband's work friends chose it for a send off dinner for him. I get we had a very large group on a busy night so we expected the service to be a little slow but to wait 30 minutes for a beer after asking for it 2-3 times, 40 minutes for checks and being over charged for stuff that wasn't ordered. And the service was flat out rude. I was engaged in a conversation with my husband and one server came with a drink and set it right between us and didn't even have the decency to pour after she behaved to rudely(it was a split of prosecco) Its clear that the servers here are poorly trained and/or overworked. These servers need to be retrained in the art of customer service.  The food was ok. We ordered nachos and wings. There was no guac on the nachos so we ordered a side of guac. The guac had CELERY in it! Who puts celery in guacamole!? A cheap ass restaurant trying to stretch ingredients and skimp on quality, that's who. I sent it back and the server tried to save face by saying, oh its a mix that they put in. Uh no bitch, that shit was ground up and mixed in. Clearly, in an effort to stretch it out. At least try your shit before you serve it. Also, celery is not a typical ingredient. What happens when you serve that to someone with an allergy to celery? Good luck with that one. If I'm ever in the area again I'll choose Olive garden instead....and I don't even like Olive garden's food."
Rizzomar ..,"Arcadia, CA",0,20,5,4.0,8/22/2016,This is my 4th time coming to BJs. I really love the Shrimp and Asparagus Penne. The hot and spicy wings have an intense smell because of the sauce but they are pretty good too. This place gets very busy but the food has been good so far. The service is nice too. My fiancé ordered an Avacodo burger which he loved. This place is definitely an option for us when we want to eat out.
Carol D.,"Rosemead, CA",97,2,,1.0,12/8/2016,"All right, where to begin... Service was bad; our waitress seemed to forget about us entirely for half the time spent here. Our food was delivered by someone else, and we had to flag down a busboy for utensils. That, unfortunately, was the best part of my experience. My biggest issue was the food poisoning I contracted from the meal. I had the Baby Back Pork Ribs with mashed potatoes and Brussels sprouts, and my boyfriend had the BJ's Classic Rib-Eye. We both got sick, but I had to miss work the next day on account of horrible nausea, muscle pain, and fever. Suffice it to say we will never be returning to this location again."
Lizbeth M.,"Downey, CA",0,12,8,2.0,6/6/2017,"My experience was ruined before I even arrived at the place. Customer service is not a priority here. I called to ask what the wait time was for a party of 7 and was told they can't give an accurate wait time for over a party of 6. When I asked for the wait time for a party of 6, I was hung up on!!! I tried calling again, this time simply asking the wait time for a party of 6, and I was told 15 minutes. 5 minutes later I arrived at the restaurant and the wait time was 2 hours. I understand a lot can change in 5 minutes, but that was RIDICULOUS! I was so fed up I ended up picking up fast food and eating at home. Terrible customer service."
Rachel H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,48,10,2.0,6/26/2015,"Sundays, Fathers day, was a wonderful experience. Not crowded, we were seated fast.  Came back on Tuesday night, 3 of us, the experience was horrible, the waitress had attitude, we ordered drinks, my drink was not my drink, i returned it. then we ordered a small dish (see picture) burnt, they burnt it!!!"
E L.,"Alhambra, CA",314,220,139,4.0,1/23/2017,This place is always great for their Tatonka stout.  That's probably the only beer I would recommend.  Food is okay.  Always try to sit at the bar since you'll get better and faster service.  They have late night happy hour also.  Usually the beer was $4 a pint but i think its closer to $5.00 or $5.50 now.  Very clean and spacious place.  Good place to watch sports at the bar area.
Marissa A.,"Monrovia, CA",0,1,,5.0,8/10/2017,We had a waiter named Daniel. He took over from our previous waiter while he went to break and took very good care of our table all the way til we ended our night.. and sang a great happy birthday song all by himself. Definitely love bjs and there drinks and food.. and good service. That is Daniel!
Renee C.,"Los Angeles, CA",79,18,5,1.0,7/12/2016,"I decided to drop in, solo, after shopping at the mall. I walked in to see four ladies standing at the front counter they greeted me and when I informed them that I was a party of 1 for dinner I was told that I could find a seat at the bar, because it was happy hour. I hesitated for a moment but was not offered another option. I asked if there were tables available.  They said they didn't  know but I could seat myself anywhere. I I walked to the bar area and although there were pub tables, I turned around and walked out.  Not one comment from the four ladies there.   I know that front desk is a sturdy piece of furniture that does not require 4 bodies to hold it up. I will be withdrawing from their email list.  An email was what brought me in this evening."
Aly B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,11,2,5.0,2/17/2017,"I've been coming to this location for over 8 years and truly have never been disappointed with my food or service, staff is always so friendly and attentive. My Boyfriend and I had  dinner today and we were served by Nicklus he was more than friendly and helpful of all our needs he went above and beyond to make sure we were well taken care of constantly asking how we were doing, we got our food in not time and he was on top of his game refilling our drinks. This review is way over due but it felt like the right time! Thank you BJ's for your Delicious food and outstanding service."
Edward R.,"Los Angeles, CA",51,144,468,4.0,11/11/2015,I have came to this BJ's many times and never have any problems with their service.  The server usually is good about following up and checking if everything is well and if we need anything at all.  The appetizer comes out first and devour it prior to our main entrees.  I recommend this location since I have never had any issues and rate them with a 4 star.
Sally C.,"Santa Fe Springs, CA",0,23,3,1.0,7/22/2017,"Sat down very quickly. Server never came, no waters, no acknowledgement of any kind. We got up to leave and told the hostess that nobody came to attend to us. No apology and very indifferent if we stayed or left. Terrible service!! We walked to the sushi place and we were taken care of ASAP! BJ, you suck and I won't go back."
Jose S.,"East Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",22,14,69,5.0,7/1/2016,A regular at this place. Love the food and the service. Brussels sprouts on point. Recomendable appetizers.
Lori M.,"Costa Mesa, CA",127,4,1,2.0,7/26/2017,"Good food HORRIBLE service. As soon as we sit down we notice the waiter was going to deliver anything but good service and we were right. We get our food and it was great all of our orders for that matter. Which made us overlook the waiters horrible customer service. Until it wasn't. Our Pizookie was rock hard. So I decide to say something to the waiter. Only thing, no waiter. He had checked us out before we got our dessert, which made me realize he wasn't coming back. So I go up to a waiter and what seemed to be a manager and let them know and they say ok sorry we'll send one right out. 20 mins later still no Pizookie. I go ask again and this time they did bring it out fairly quickly. What made it great.. as we were leaving the manager asked us if the second Pizookie was better. I told him, after waiting over 25 mins .. and he says but was it good? Just not the best customer service. But overall the food was delicious, second Pazookie was better. I do want to add that our server (gentleman that brought out the food) was amazing!!!! Wish he was our waiter !!!"
Julie L.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,13,3,1.0,1/22/2017,"Horrible experience, they had a problem with  my to go order and when I asked for the manager, they bring me the KITCHEN MANAGER.. how unprofessional is that?  and he's shirt was all dirty like really . I was a loyal customer from this location until yesterday.  I don't need managers to give me attitude like if I was asking for free food . I will take my money elsewhere."
Luis C.,"Pomona, CA",0,10,1,2.0,1/17/2017,"Went to this location on Martin Luther Kings, Day a bit busy services was a bit slow we ordered a pitcher of beer are glasses were very dirty had to replace them twice flatware was also very dirty spotted and had dry food on it pretty gross. pizza was good and so were the appetizers. Received our bill they did not give us the discount for happy hour we had to complain they did change it after a bit of complaining I don't think I'll be come back to this location. The West Covina location is much better."
Shaun B.,"Montebello, CA",0,3,7,2.0,8/19/2016,"Service was incredibly slow, we came here for a quick meal at 8:30, were seated at 8:45, it is now 11:05 and our server Martin G has disappeared once again for almost 10 minutes after giving us the check. I ordered a BJs favourite deep dish pizza which was quite average - not bad, but not great either. The wife ordered the fish & chips, of which the chips were ok but the fish was so overcooked and had so much batter it was basically fossilized. We will not be coming back."
