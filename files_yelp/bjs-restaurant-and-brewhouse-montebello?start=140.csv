Elizabeth G.,"Rosemead, CA",2,12,133,3.0,7/5/2016,"Family friendly restaurant with a big selection of menu items. Their pizzas are very good. Loud atmosphere with televisions for watching sports. Good bar selection of beers as well. I always get their pazookis. Great dessert! Service is a hit or miss. Always crowded. Make reservations before you get there. Wait can be long at times. Overall, the quality of the food is descent and I would come back to explore other dishes."

Jessica W.,"Alhambra, CA",2,90,187,4.0,7/18/2015,I ordered the chicken tenders with crispy thin fries and the sparkling raspberry lemonade. They were both good.  The waitress was friendly. I wouldn't mind coming here again.
Kathy M.,"San Gabriel, CA",154,10,21,3.0,6/20/2016,"The hosts were friendly and welcoming. We were told we would be seated in a few minutes, which we were. The host that guided us to our seat walked in a nice timely manner. Jimmy then greeted us as our server and took our drink orders. Here is where it turned a little bad.  A different server came and took our food order. We got our food order in a timely fashion.  Between getting sat and placing our order, we never got our table settings (napkin and silverware). So I kindly asked our server for some settings. He came back a few minutes with one fork.  I then asked if we can get two settings, with the napkins and silverware.  He looked at me with a confused look, but when he returned with what I've asked for, there was some attitude given back at me. I also asked for some ketchup and Tabasco. It took about 3 minutes to get the condiments.  I understand how servers work.  I also understand how some customers are jerks, but that doesn't mean to push it onto other customers.  I set my glass on the side for a refill. He took my glass hoping to get it refilled.  Nope. I waited over 5 minutes before asking a busser for a refill. When we were done eating and received the bill, that was when I found out his name, Carlos.  It wasn't until we paid our bill that he became super friendly. Overall, food was great, but the service can be better."
Alex M.,"Pasadena, Los Angeles, CA",119,388,1757,3.0,4/8/2015,"It was Saturday night after just leaving a comedy show and we were looking for somewhere to eat. We seen that this place was still open so we popped on in. The bar is open seating so we got a booth for the two of us. We sat and our waiters walked right up and introduced herself. She was carry happy, attentive and very polite. After looking over the menu we ordered. We started with fried artichokes that are awesome but don't forget to ask for extra dipping sauce. My fiancee had a Thai chicken salad that they forgot to put the chicken in. The waitress was kind enough to bring some out for the salad after told it was missing. I had the California burger cooked medium. It was delicious. Meat cooked just right, flavorful and juicy with wedge cut fries. Although they forgot the chicken in the salad we will be back. It's never disappointed before."
Danny L.,"Monterey Park, CA",529,214,256,3.0,4/27/2015,"Man back in high school BJ's use to be the place to be! I don't know if my expectations are higher or I was just naïve, but BJ's just isn't that great anymore. The servers are always very courteous, but not very attentive. Last time I was there our server came 4 times and we were there for like 3 hours. First time for drinks, second time for food, third time for dessert, and the last was for the check. Maybe it is their policy not to bother their diners too much so they can enjoy their meal in peace or they are just under staffed. Either way, I think they should check up on all their diners more often.  My 3 star rating is mainly cause of the food. First the food takes forever to come out! If you are looking for a quick meal before going out or watch a movie, this is not the place to be. So make sure to grab one of their house beers, which are pretty good, sit back and relax. I have had a lot of different main courses here - pizza, burgers, and pasta. Every main dish I have tried here is extremely salty yet still pretty bland. I definitely prefer their appetizer menu over their main courses. I like their the avocado rolls and spinach & artichoke dip. Oh and their pizookies are  !"
Janell C.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,26,1,2.0,3/5/2016,I really don't know why we came here. Not my favorite.  We were invisible.   The service was awful.  The server was some young kid that looked like I bothered cause I was ready to order.   He didn't roll his eyes but I was waiting.  Never again.  Soooooooo disappointed.    Beer was cold. I guess that's the two stars.  Flip this joint.
Darlene Q.,"Temple City, CA",15,241,58,1.0,10/4/2016,They don't even deserve a star for the wu their bathroom is. A lot of dtalls didn't have toilet paper and there was paper all over the floor. The toilet seats were also dirty. Where's the person who's supose to keep the bathroom clesn?
Amelia L.,"San Gabriel, CA",6,19,,2.0,4/27/2017,"My experience with BJ's has been up and down, never consistent. I had visited this restaurant with my family before and received exceptional service. I don't understand why this time was different. Our female server, don't know her name but she wears glasses, was enthusiastic at first and seemed prompt and friendly, but her attitude gradually fell along with the service she gave us. We ordered two hickory barbecue burgers, a parmesan crusted chicken, a salmon entree, a sandwich, and a large pizza. The pizza was the first to come, which took me by surprise because it usually takes the most time to arrive. Twenty minutes had passed and the entrees started to arrive one by one. I ordered a well done burger and I received medium rare. My dad's sandwich hadn't arrived yet, but the table next to us ordered the same sandwich and his arrived first (even though they were sat 20 minutes after us). I think they made a mistake and gave the sandwich to them instead. After the food arrived, our server stopped checking up on our table. We saw her jumping from table to table, but never checked up on us. We had to wave down a bus boy to ask where my dad's sandwich was because everyone's food had arrived. 30 minutes later, we decided to ask for a manager and he came to our table. We told him that my burger was made incorrectly, and didn't receive the sandwich. Another 20 minutes passes, but at this point our server was avoiding our table because we complained about our service. We thought she did it on purpose because she felt embarrassed. But my question is, she is our server and if she made a mistake, she should be the one to apologize for the inconvenience. Why was she acting like a child by avoiding us. She kept checking up on the surrounding tables, but never made an effort to stop by us until the very end to drop off the check. They took off the sandwich from the bill, but we told the manager there was no need to do that because we weren't looking for a free meal, we just wanted our food. We did appreciate the effort, but it came too late. Instead of making up for it at the end and apologizing, make the moment right and do something about it when the time comes. We could have gone to other restaurants, but we chose this one because of a previous experience. This is unacceptable. Will not be dining here for while and will visit the Arcadia location instead."
Abigail Abby D.,"Corona, CA",83,7,1,2.0,1/4/2017,"Terrible service. They have this new texting where they text you when your table is ready and once they send the text, they will only hold it for three minutes. We checked for our table because we have been waiting more than the 30 minutes that they estimated and they said they texted us. We didn't get it and they didn't call us and we were standing right next to them. When we went up to ask, they didn't even look at us."
Sandra J.,"La Mirada, CA",2,2,,5.0,6/23/2017,We had a party of 16 water polo players on Fathers day and they accommodated us last minute!
Sharon A.,"South Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",9,2,,1.0,1/13/2017,"The servers were amazing, however the cook is lazy and doesn't care about the quality of the food he serves, I gave him 2 not one but 2 chances to pre pair eatible food and he could not the jumbolia was burnt and flavorless disgusting and then I order the salmonand that came back horrible I'm not sure if he was tired or what but I was served dinner way after my family so now I'm the spectacle at the table because the are done they had pizza and a burger I quess fine cuisine it's not in his ability as a chef he sucks and the experience thank you but no thank you I will not be coming back here ever"
Dora C.,"Montebello, CA",0,18,,2.0,7/11/2017,There were three of us in the bar area sitting at a booth. Our waitress took such a long time to take our order for drinks and took even longer to take our order for food. She only came around once to check on us . Our food which was only a few appetizers took even longer. It was a frustrating experience and we felt bad for the other servers who helped us because we couldn't find our waitress. Won't be returning there for happy hour.
Bryant R.,"Montebello, CA",181,2,1,1.0,7/9/2016,"1. Their pasta is straight garbo. I feel like those people who get catfished, who think someone looks fire but realize it was the filters that created the illusion.  The pasta looked dumb flames on the menu, but in real life, na. It taste like it was forgotten in mad max truck, as he drove across the dessert for safety. I mean, I'm still going to eat it. But I'll have to warm some of that vegan tomato basil sauce at my crib tomorrow....as a pasta enthusiast, I ain't feeling it. Little cousin said it was unnecessarily spicy.  2. Table service, trash !  3. This man gave us one ranch, for 3 people.  Do the math.  4. The boneless wings, messed up or order, and they barely have bbq on them. Also, one ranch! 5. Sliders are alright,  remind me of my school lunch. 6. My friend is thirsty. He ran out of his drink. Again, bad service and the flat bread pizza, ugh. 1 star.  Just hit the Pollo loco."
Garrett J.,"Duarte, CA",0,17,1,1.0,7/1/2016,The waitress seemed put out that I was there. When my pizza came out it wasn't cut. Only when I asked another waitress for utensils she noticed it wasn't cut and took it back. When my pizza returned it was a mess. The original waitress just flopped it down over my shoulder and walked away.  Horrible customer service. There is a picture of what happen to my pizza.  **Reply to manager.  I did ask to speak to someone. That's when all of a sudden she was friendly and was trying to do everything but get one. At that point I offered to pay for he soda and just left.  I understand when it's busy and you can tell the staff mind is a little off. It's ok because there is a reason. It wasn't busy that day.
Jenn N.,"West Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",170,20,40,2.0,1/17/2016,"The food and service at this location is absolutely underwhelming.  As much as BJ's try to to be diverse with their menu, if you order anything other than pizza and beer, you'll be disappointed. Their salad selection isn't too bad either.  Basically stay away from anything that requires some culinary skills. Its safe to stay with the fresher menu items such as their salads as they're required to keep things fresh.  Their pizza selection is basically the only sure thing on their menu."
Vishnu And Emily S.,"Irvine, CA",19,50,82,4.0,7/21/2015,"I ordered the calamari appetizer and the clam chowder bread bowl. They were both delicious. The only issue I had with this place was that the waitress took forever with everything. We waited around for our bill for about 5-10 minutes after we asked for it. And after we put our credit card down, we waited another 5-10 minutes to get our receipt and card back. I like that while you wait, if there is a wait, you can just go shop in the mall. Very convenient. Great location."
