Melody C.,"Los Angeles, CA",44,119,198,3.0,4/11/2016,"I really like BJ's. My 3 stars are only because the Grilled Salmon I ordered had to be sent back, not once but twice. I finally just asked to have it removed from the check. I've had it here before and it was good. Maybe they were just having an off night but whoever was cooking the fish last night around 5PM needs a little refresher course. Otherwise the ribs were good and the Brussels sprout and kale salad was enjoyable. I tried a new BJ's root beer and liked it too."
Xochitl G.,"Los Angeles, CA",12,43,10,2.0,7/22/2016,"Staff was nice and friendly,  however our order was all wrong, my beer was hot, we had all got our food except for my little nephew we waited and waited.  I got pizza and salad.  I was disappointed by the pizza nothing but bread salad was meh.  My daughter ordered the broccoli and cheese soup which was absolutely delicious.  It was a bitter sweet experience."
Cindy W.,"El Monte, CA",343,58,102,5.0,4/14/2015,"A friend and i came here yesterday night at 11:25pm knowing they would close at 12pm so we asked the host nicely if they would still seat us he was totally nice about it and told us we could grab a seat in the bar area ourselves! (Didnt get a chance to get his name)  We decided to sit in a booth table area and menus were brought to us . Valerie told us john will be right with us if she can just grab us drinks first we just asked for water to start and we waiting a while so i guess valerie ended up just being our server she was totally awesome and sweet ! She got all our orderes correct and told us some of the items were happy hour to save us a few bucks which is great!  As we continued eatting the manager i believe his name was daniel came around to check on everyone and got us another round of beers even though it was probably a minute past last call !  Love this place would totally come back for the beer and happy hour appitizers!  We ordered pitcher of blue moon ! Chicken winga , flat bread , and nachos !  We also ordered more but i only have pictures of these items!"
Phillip G.,"Downey, CA",0,11,2,1.0,11/29/2016,Service here was horrible went in on a game night and the waiter took forever to take our food order then when I ordered my beer it was flat. (Maybe they do this intentionally since everyone is getting drunk for the game) Our server them comes and tells us he is going on lunch and tells us another server will take care of us but yet throughout the whole time we see him still working! Manager can see that we are upset and we can tell he does his best to avoid us! My gf usually gets mad at me when I complain and get mad but this time she was even upset about the service as well! Then they use my reward points for stuff that I never received. I talk to management and his excuse is we are busy how can that be your excuse is you are a huge restaurant chain and it's not like this is your first night you ever get busy!!! Service here was just horrible and management is just as bad!!!
Robert P.,"Riverside, CA",533,501,375,3.0,11/9/2014,"Our lunch bunch decided on BJs because of BJ's purported skill in providing gluten free salads. One of my guests has Celiac disease, and so informed the staff in no uncertain terms.  We were 1 fork-full away from a bad outcome.  The staff brought the wrong salad to my guest, but in the dim light we could not tell. So she started to mix the salad and gather the right stuff on her fork. She paused when she noticed it didn't have dressing. The next moment the staff brought over her correct salad and... whew.  They apologized politely, but this mistake should not have happened. The only reason for this review is to share the story with others who suffer from this disease. Don't assume they (BJs or anyone) does it correctly. Inspect your meal!"
Melissa Z.,"Monterey Park, CA",133,4,2,1.0,11/26/2016,"Alright so the first time I came to this BJ's it was with my friend. We were seated in a booth, which was pretty cool. Service was good, good was great everything fine. Which is what the star is for.  SECOND time I came here was tonight with my family for my brothers birthday. So, we wait about 5-10 mins to be seated which is no problem. Then they seat us at this small table next to the pilar where all the waiters walk so that was annoying. My mom wanted a booth to put her purse so she didn't have to hold it, but we decided to stay.  Then, our waitress comes and says ""I'll be right with you for drinks I just have to greet this other family"" or something like that. And we never see her again. We sit and wait and watch everyone else get drinks, food while we sit there hungry and irritated. Then another waitress comes, and you can tell she was not our new waitress because she took our order on the back of a receipt. We order drinks and food because we've been waiting so long and were hungry.  Another 10-15 mins pass and still no drinks. Finally we get them and we drink, and wait another 10-20 mins now and as soon as we were about to get up and walk out, they bring our food. Then the part of the table that is extra and folded under falls and hits my mom right on her knees. We ask for the manager who had the best attitude of the night and fixed it. My mom asked a waitress for mustard and I promise she looked at my mom like she was from another planet then went ""...yea"" and left. So rude. We ate and waited again for the birthday pizookie for my brother which was not that long of a wait. He eats that then we leave. The food here is good, but this bad service and rude attitudes left a nasty taste in my mouth about this restaurant and I don't think I'll come back anytimesoon."
Karen K.,"Alhambra, CA",601,639,607,2.0,12/13/2014,"Meh. I got a lunch BBQ Platter.  It had chicken breast that was so dry and stiff, and the pulled meat sandwich was small and just okay.  It wasn't anything to write home about.   They did keep my water full, however, which is a plus."
Medz H.,"Montebello, CA",16,35,30,1.0,11/8/2015,"When will restaurants figure out that service is just as important as good food? It seems that most of these places figure that if the food is good then people will comeback no matter how lackluster the service is.  What is even more surprising is when bad service seems to be a regular complaint on yelp and its never addressed. The reason for my rant was, my wife and I know that the service at this location is slow but we were hungry after shopping at the mall and gave in. I honestly have to say this most recent trip takes the cake. Not only was the service horrible, but the food made us stand up and leave( I will get to that in a second.) When you walk into a restaurant, you expect to be greeted in a happy, polite manner. In this instance the hostess never said hello nor made eye contact with me. After standing there for a minute or two I finally said ""I need a table for two"" at which point she asked for my name and putt a pager on the counter. 15 min later she yells out my name even tho I have a pager( which was never used). We get guided towards a table by a someone  who seems disoriented and couldn't decided which route to take. During this this walk she must have asked us at least 3 times how we were doing but kept turning her back to us before we answer, just plain rude if you ask me. We finally get seated and a few mins later a different person came to take our drink and appetizer order, she is friendly! So we give the order and get our drinks... We ordered chips& guac with a side of salsa( not to random) she brings us chips and guac then vanishes. We have no napkins or utensils, and start looking around for help... 15 min goes by and our real server appears ( I have no idea what her name was because she never said it). I explained we needed that stuff and also that we asked for chips, guac and salsa but didn't get salsa... ""Oh you ordered two?""she replied. WTF? No, we were just missing the salsa I told her. She leaves a bit confused and then we see he talking to the nice girl that took that order and looking our way. After a few minutes pass the ""nice"" girl comes and brings two little sides of salsa ( you know the cups they put catchup in) what the hell will we do with this?  We each ordered a mini pizza and side salad. My wife got a caesar which looked like it had no dressing at all and  I got a house with ranch( mine had a dollop of dressing) both were pretty sad even for a side salad. We eat those and wait for another 20-25 mins for our pizzas... They finally show up and both are not fully cooked. When the pepperoni on top of a pizza is still soft and pale colored you know something is off. We called the manager( who was understanding) but who seemed to have this speech down pat! ""Cooks didn't make it right and I'm sorry for the service"".. We offered to pay for the drinks and appetizer but he said no. At this point we left. I would avoid this establishment at all cost and you are probably better off eating in the mall food court next door!"
Robert A.,"Pico Rivera, CA",96,5,1,1.0,4/23/2017,Ordered food online and came in 5 mins after it was suppose to be ready. Still waited another 20 mins to get my food after I got there. Service sucked and I'm never doing pick up here again. BJ's needs to get step up their game or they will lose alot of customers for their horrible service
Adrian G.,"Whittier, CA",30,5,1,2.0,12/8/2015,"This is the second time in a row that we come here and the service SUCKS!!!! I guess the secret is to be on the staff because they all appear to be carrying great conversations with one another.  The waitress has not been by to check on us since other staff dropped off our food. No refills, no margarita for my wife, and no attention. One would think that they would have brought out the alcohol first and fast so we would continue drinking. No way!!! Not here.  It's not like the food is to die for. I can get crappy service at other places that serve ok pizza, mediocre salads and bland appetizers.  Unless you're a local or work here don't bother coming they'll ignore you. The bj's in Arcadia is better....way better."
Jenny L.,"Monterey Park, CA",28,184,32,2.0,12/16/2015,"How can such a well known restaurant serve such shitty food? How do you do it BJs? My top sirloin was overly dry, brussel sprouts were kind of gross actually and even my clam chowder was subpar. My friend didn't like her chicken.  Even though the food was bad I ate ALL of it. Why? Because the server hardly came by so I had so much time to just sit and pick at my food until it was all gone 1hr later.  Nonetheless, they have a good beer selection and my server was nice...slow but nice.  We got a free pizookie for my friends birthday though. Probably the best tasting thing all night."
Roni H.,"Rosemead, CA",0,16,18,3.0,3/27/2016,"I visited BJ's on my birthday 3/22/16 the food was good but you can see the servers were overwhelmed. The restaurant is clean and welcoming. The only problem was having to ask for silverware a few times so we canstart eating. I had my daughter with me and she ordered the kids mac and cheese which was dry and didn't look so appetizing our waiter took it back and brought us a fresh batch.  Other than that we will be coming back, they just need more staff."
Iris J.,"Whittier, CA",254,273,738,1.0,6/16/2016,"I walked in and it was packed, so the hostess told us it was open seating in the bar. We walked over to the bar and took a seat. We were looking at the menu and I started with water while my friend decided on a cocktail.  The waiter then rudely informed us that we could not sit at the bar because I wasn't ordering a ""real drink"".  At that point he took our menus from our hands and asked us to leave the bar since it was so packed. I was also bothered that a very young couple sat down next to us and he served them alcoholic beverages without asking for valid forms of identification to verify their age before serving them liquor. We got up and went to the hostess to explain what had just happened at the bar with the rude condescending waiter that booted us out of his section. I asked what we should do as far as seating because we still wanted to eat there. The hostess did not try to accommodate us or apologize for that server's actions. We asked for a manager and she ignored our request, but perhaps she didn't hear me.... I'll give her the benefit of the doubt.  Either way we ended up walking out and took our business to another restaurant where we were treated with courtesy. We will not be returning to BJ's anytime in the near future."
Fernando A.,"Monterey Park, CA",9,44,5,3.0,9/9/2016,"This place is ok, there pizza and wings are really good, pretty pricey and you could get better pizza elsewhere, the brewery part is legit the beers are good, they have different season beers, but due to the location, its always packed."
Cristian G.,"Pomona, CA",85,22,1,1.0,7/16/2017,"This place is pretty sad. My wife and I are new to the area, and were happy that there was a BJs Brewhouse in our neighborhood. Welp, we weren't happy for long. We arrived here about 8pm on a Sunday night. The place was not too busy when we arrived, but I couldnt help but notice that it was in disarray. There was quite a few pieces of trash on the floor in every direction I looked. We waited to be seated. I headed to the bathroom to wash my hands, of course in here there was trash all over the floor as well. So I went back to find my seat. I noticed when I sat down facing my wife, there were a childs hand prints all over the booth right next to my wifes head. It looked like the booth wasnt really cleaned. On my side there was trash on the seat. Anyways we were just there for dessert, and would be on our way shortly thereafter.  The waiter took a little longer than expected to arrive. He took our order for one chocolate chunk pizookie and left. He brought us some water shortly after. It took about 20 mins for the pizookie to arrive. Once it was delivered we never saw our waiter again. We ate the dessert and waited, and waited. No one came to bring a check, or see if we needed anything else (we were never given napkins). So after waiting for about 15 mins i just left cash on my table and we left. I did look around to see if we could find a manager. I tried to get his attention but he was busy chumming around with some of the wait staff. Poor customer service here, especially for something as easy as dessert. The entire restaurant looks very unclean. And not much can be said about the management. I would give zero stars if I could. I am strongly considering sending a letter to corporate headquarters detailing exactly the lackluster experience I had here. I will never return again."
Linda S.,"Monterey Park, CA",27,103,117,2.0,3/12/2015,"Mediocre food slathered with a lot of butter and oil. This place never fails to make bland and salty foods. I have tried their burgers to their pizzas to their pastas. This is definitely a last-resort restaurant where I would eat at only if my friends can't make up their mind or for convenience. I definitely don't recommend this place if you're looking for good food.  I have to give it to them though, for their pazookie that is. You can't mess up cookies and ice cream.  Also, their customer service is quite good and the ambiance is laid back and clean."
Bettina H.,"Monterey Park, CA",96,82,4565,3.0,11/13/2014,What was ordered: personal pizza shrimp scampi avocado egg rolls lasagna kale salad combo platter southern fried chicken berry mojito What I'd come back to order again: shrimp scami southern fried chicken berry mojitos only during HH
Adilene M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,2.0,4/9/2017,"Came here Thursday to celebrate my daughters bday everything  was great food n service but my son n husband got food poisoning. My son ordered the mini hamburgers from the kids menu, he ate one and my husband the other. Next morning stomach pain and running to the restroom. This was our first time here and enjoyed it but with this who kmow if we will be going back."
Daniella A.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,23,,4.0,2/22/2016,I'm here about once a week and food is pretty good and service is as well ...the only thing is the wait but hey it's probably always packed because this place has a bar and good grub... If you are coming with a big group make sure you tell them you want a big table because they try to squeeze you on  little tables! I recommend the house salad and clam chowder soup
Tad K.,"Monterey Park, CA",292,206,1103,2.0,8/14/2014,"This is the nearest to the house and wish there were another one closer.  Less than impressed tonight. Place was pretty full, for a Wednesday night - got there around 730pm.  Seated promptly, but server didn't come check on us for 15 minutes.  The lowlights: Food too 25 minutes with cold fries, wrong salads and soup in a sourdough bowl taking another 10 minutes after that.  Fish and chips  - fish was hot but not much crunch with cold fries - wedge salad came w blue cheese when asked to omit when ordered, and sandwich, although tasty, looked like it was made at home - smooched a bit. Server either over stationed or new, I asked the hostess if this was a training store, and was told it's not.  A turned away salad (not prepared as requested - no dressing) was an obvious annoyance to the server who brought it... Overall, not the best this place has done.  I'm sure we will be back, but not for a while."
