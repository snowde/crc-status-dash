Benjamin B.,"Los Angeles, CA",21,7,5,5.0,6/29/2016,"Came here to celebrate my brothers birthday. It was an amazing dinner, and the staff were attentive. One of 2 rib eyes came pretty welldone. More than our liking. They replaced it, and took both rib eyes off our bill. IRENE the manager, and Stephanie L. Our server were both amazing at correcting the situation. Because of this, i will happily come back. Kudos to them both! Stephanie L. Made a huge difference with her hustle, charisma, and good vibes! Thanks Steph!"
Lynn U.,"Pismo Beach, CA",58,111,688,4.0,8/5/2014,"Had great service and a tasty dinner last night.. The only thing was when we walked in we waited in the front without being seen for over ten minutes, there was nobody working in sight..meeting? I'm not sure but the food was great and so was the waitstaff! I never felt like I was looking for a refill or anything else. So great job BJ's!"
Maria P.,"Whittier, CA",26,4,,1.0,9/11/2016,I feel this establishment is discriminating against me for bringing my children we were here first to watch a football game and they wouldn't put it on instead they put us on the other side of the room thank you BJ's...
Ed M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,82,214,4.0,2/4/2016,Nice place to watch a game and spend some time with friends. It's a clean place. The waiting time is something to work on. Sometimes depending on the person with the list it kind of gets lost. But overall I give the 4 stars. Good customer service. Price is fair.
Gus C.,"Los Angeles, CA",32,122,276,4.0,11/12/2015,"Always good service, and the new menu selection is on point, especially the craft brews."
Maria N.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,17,,3.0,8/8/2017,"I like coming here for drinks during happy hour. Drinks are good but I am not so fond of the happy hour menu. No margaritas or martinis on happy hour menu. Only limited options for happy hour appetizers. We tried the bjs brewhouse burger with fries and it looked very delicious but my half tasted a bit odd. The bun had some crumbs that made me wonder if they used a special type of bun. My boyfriend noticed it too, but we didnt mention it to our waitress. So I decided to order the seared ahi tuna salad because last time it was excellent. Sadly this time it was disappointing. They added way too much dressing that made it hard for me to enjoy. The tuna was so so. So this time i did mention it to the server that only serving while our original server went on break. She wasnt really polite she just grabbed it off our table and tried to send out another one. As if I my comment annoyed her and she just wanted to rush off. I decided to try the avocado egg rolls and they came out slightly burned and were just terrible. I like avocado but that appetizer was just not enjoyable at all. It was uppsetting to have good drinks but not good food. I wish they would have a wider selection of happy hour food items."
Jorge P.,"Los Angeles, CA",10,107,57,4.0,8/4/2015,"I like coming to this BJ, the calamari usually is very well done and they serve it with a white dressing and marinara. I like to dip each side separately because it gives you more appreciation for the squid. I've gotten pizza the stuffed mushrooms ribs and fries.  The fries were a joke tho, I think I was served the bottom of the bag because they were so thin and small they soaked up all the grease. No good.  The ribs were good, nothing special but edible and soft meat. The pizza was very very tasty got the supreme taste as it should with good looking breading. The mushrooms are a must try just eat them warm they don't taste the same cold.  I'll go back to this one, the one in Glendale is awful from food to service not this one."
Josie N.,"Long Beach, CA",269,7,1,5.0,5/27/2016,Stephany clark was the BEST!!!! Thanks for the service ...:) great attitude ..  Will come back
Danielle G.,"Monterey Park, CA",1,19,1,1.0,7/8/2016,"I really had much rather given 0 stars. I hate this fuckin BJs and I have no idea why I go back. I've had my share of shitty experiences there and out of the 10 times I've been there, about 6 or 7 times was only for late night happy hour and 0.5 stars only because those nights with friends are what makes it memorable -but still, even then, the service always sucked. I figured hey, lets give the morning shift a shot.(shitty idea) I went in once for lunch, service and food, sucked. Overall experience 3/10. I went again recently with a friend before engagement ring shopping = meaning he was stressed = wanted a beer to mellow out = bjs = good idea.  That shit turned out to be the dumbest idea we had. We had sat in the bar area because the there was a wait for the dining area even though it wasnt even crowded and we went a little after they opened.. um whatever, lets sit in the bar.  Sat in the bar and encountered a woman who had no smile, I'm assuming she lost it on her drive to work or something.....? Poor girl.  Didnt introduce, no hi, just - sumthin to drink...?...?........................... uh k. We ordered water to start and looked through the menu, she came back again with no emotion whatsoever and totally gave us judgemental stares throughout the entire ordering process. She seemed rushed and impatient because I didnt know what I wanted so I just decided on brussel sprouts and that I would order a meal later on. Each time we asked/said anything to her, she never said any ""I'll be back, ok, sure, no problem, thanks, i'll be back with that, i'll put that order in now"" nada- she would turn her back and dart off. It was insanely weird. Anyway- I decided I had lost my appetite. Didnt finish my appetizer and my friend never even ordered his alcohol because.. god forbid he ordered a beer with her.  At the end of the meal, I wanted desert but again.......god..forbid. My friend pointed out that in the table tent thing there was an advertisement for ""use mobile pay thru the app (for the first time) and get a free mini pizookie"" YAY! When the server came by, she brought the check= get out, no desert for you fatasses. My friend ended up flagging down a hostess and mentioned the ad and wanted to order the pizookie- the response from the hostess was ""oh thats expired we no longer honor that."" k, even tho there was no exp date even in the fine print and yet the same advertisement was all over every other table..... cool. we payed our bill, were annoyed as fuck, didnt tip, and left. that waitress didnt even deserve $1 which is saying something. I was insanely bothered still because like I said, i have no idea why I go back, but its closeby, cheap, fast, simple and i knew i would obviously go back but seriously didnt want to encounter that server again. Called the manager, complained, he seemed appalled at everything he was hearing and was sincerely sorry and said ""next time you come in please ask for me so i could make your experience better"" so hey, i gave bjs another try today. service in the dining area - server had the same attitude as the other. annoyed. rushed. could give a fuck less about her job. did i bother calling the manager? no. what for? what could possibly have turned around yet another shitty experience? ha.  also, the hostess mentioned when we sat down ""free pizookie when you pay with the app!"" screw you bjs. also i wont put up the names of the two servers who suck extreme balls cuz i dont want to put them on blast but - i hope they get their heads out of their asses sometime soon."
Priscillla S.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,8,2,5.0,1/29/2017,I love this place. The sodas are always on point. Shout out to Priscilla the Bev. tender/ Host/ Food runner. Frankie was very nice and helpful along with adolfo and Angela. All the servers are super friendly. You will always have a good experience here. I will defiantly come again.
Anna G.,"Norwalk, CA",0,6,,5.0,2/8/2017,"A group of six of female friends are there today, service was excellent by our waiter Taylor, very professional, funny and pleasant, our experience was really good!"
Jocelyne Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,,1.0,7/20/2016,My boyfriend and I decided to drop in for a quick dinner before we started shopping. We get seated at this horrible table where they said we will be served right away but we were completely ignored by our server. Our appetizer came 20 minutes late so what was the point since our main course came right after? Not to mention my boyfriend ordered a ranch dip and it had hairs on it. Completely disgusted by this we couldn't enjoy our meal and we were ignored. We are never coming back to this place. Horrible food horrible service. Beware and stay away.
Eileen L.,"Monrovia, CA",22,17,,1.0,6/13/2016,"I always try to give BJ's a chance, but I'm always disappointed.  The service here is HORRIBLE:  The beers that they feature/list are never on tap,  the last 3 times, it took literally 30 minutes or longer for our food to come out. Despite the horrible service, the food remains good and consistent.  This BJ's is lucky it gets customers even with its horrible service; most likely because the surrounding restaurants are crappy."
Veronica S.,"Glendora, CA",0,29,2,1.0,1/13/2017,"The service here made my mediocre food even less enjoyable. I've never been to this location, and won't ever come back. I waited 20 minutes for a table, which is understandable. Now I've been waiting an extra 45 minutes at my table to get water that I've ordered. The majority of the people here are already served. Which leads me to believe getting my water shouldn't take more than 3 minutes.  Also every server here is walking around lollygagging while all 6 people at the front are talking to each other or texting. I think this is the most horribly trained staff I've ever seen. At this point the management should consider training properly or hiring better people, I could dine and dash because Jessica isn't paying attention. This location is giving the company a bad representation of what food service should be. I definitely won't ever come back here, and will need to be persuaded to go to any other location."
Garen A.,"Montebello, CA",487,671,2009,2.0,6/28/2013,"I'm sorry, but I was so disappointed with the service I got here during my last visit that I couldn't give it more than 2 stars.  The meal started off just fine. The waitress seemed involved, and we were seated relatively fast, and it all went downhill from there.  Let's start with the food. We shared a hand-tossed buffalo chicken pizza. The new-ish hand tossed pizza isn't bad, but the deep dish is way (and I mean WAY) better. I wouldn't bother with the hand-tossed. The flavor is ok ... I personally think BJ's puts too much buffalo sauce, but that's just me. I also had a side Caesar salad with chicken. It was pretty bland (I've had much, much better).  Now for the service. First the waitress completely didn't understand that I wanted the dinner portion of the caesar salad. There were four of us, we were all sharing the pizza and getting salads as well (cuz two slices of pizza isn't enough for me in my hungry mood) ... we all just ordered the salads we wanted (didn't specify dinner or side) - she brought two of us dinner portion salads and the other two side portions. Who brings two people full salads and the other two side salads - makes no sense to me - and if the waitress was confused why didn't she just ask us to clarify.  Anyway, so because she thought we wanted side salads she brought those out way before anything else (leaving us to deal with the awkward waiting until we start eating to be courteous) ... then we waited another 20 minutes for the pizza, and another 20 after that for the other two salads. At one point it had been so long since we'd seen our waitress that we just assumed she'd kidnapped by previous angry customers. The best thing was that she said the delay was due to the fact that they were 'making' more chicken (though apparently they had enough for the pizza and my salad) ... none of this makes any sense.  I won't go on ... needless to say I was really disappointed. It wasn't even that full of a night (if your service is horrible on a Wednesday, I don't want to know what Friday night is like)."
Ryan K.,"Whittier, CA",4,10,1,2.0,3/12/2016,Food was good service was shit. Our server had a bad attitude almost as if he didn't want to be working here. My advice hire people who are more outgoing and not douchebags ! That's why I go to Brea bjs! Step it up montebello. Beer was good tho
Val R.,"Monterey Park, CA",2,17,11,1.0,6/10/2016,"I normally love BJ's but not today. We sat in the bar and had the worst service (it wasn't busy at 2:45 on) our waiter seem to not like his job or us, no smile and Bad attitude. He never came to refill our water we had to asked, even though he passed us several times with the water jug. Basically he didn't care about us everything we got we had to ask for! When we asked for our check received it never once did he ask if we wanted anything else like maybe dessert. We spoke with the manager he  know the person we're talking about like this had happened before.  Come on BJ's I know you can do better with your service!"
Jose F.,"Houston, TX",523,257,668,3.0,2/25/2016,"I mostly stop in for the late happy hour but I have dined here on occasion. My favorite appetizer is the avocado egg rolls, they are crunchy and salty with that creamy avocado flavor. As far as the entrees they are well portioned. Not the most flavorful, but they do fill you up. Service is okay."
Barbara L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,7,2,1.0,6/6/2016,"The service today was just bad. What happened to all the awesome waiters??!! Monday night service sucks!! I'll be back tho, but on my usual Sunday night where the staff is awesome!"
