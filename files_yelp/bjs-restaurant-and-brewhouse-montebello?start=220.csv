Sam B.,"Bell, CA",2,12,119,5.0,7/19/2015,"Great place for that late night cravings  avocado rolls, wings, pizza and pazookie is a must. Cajun pasta with shrimp is good plate to share."
Alan M.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,132,64,1.0,11/26/2014,"Bad experience with waitress ""Jessica P"".  11/25/2014.   The restaurant was typically crowded and nothing out of the ordinary from my past visits.  Highlights of our bad experience include: - Lunch for two took one hour even after kind reminders at the 30 minute mark. - A different waitess brought our food.  She explained our waitress forgot to submit the order. - No apologies whatsoever from the Jessica.  She just returned our change and took off. We were polite and considereate despite the experience.     (I don't want to have saliva in my food) After I wrote this review, I scanned recent reviews. Apparently, I'm not the only one experiencing bad service here.    Adios BJs at Montebello."
Edward C.,"Los Angeles, CA",88,10,2,5.0,7/17/2015,Awesome place to eat! Great environment and lots of friendly staff! Honestly can't think of a better place than this one hen it comes to delicious food and terrific customer service!  The front desk could improve but eh  5*
Art S.,"San Gabriel, CA",0,2,1,5.0,9/13/2015,James and Susana give the best service. All the food is good and drinks are better. I'd like to see a large steak added to the menu. Great vibes here
Ramy S.,"Fontana, CA",8,3,1,5.0,4/12/2016,Ordered on the app. Fast. Convenient. Great service. Food was good and not cold when I ate it.  I will most likely use the app to order lunch everytime.
Dennis G.,"Rosemead, CA",16,26,86,5.0,3/29/2015,Wow this is pretty yummy  like I said a bit outside my comfort zone but I'm truly enjoying this...
Chris M.,"Montebello, CA",21,40,6,2.0,1/27/2016,"Oh man. One of the worst visits here. Sat for a while before any one attended to us. Then,  Waited over 30 min for a drink."
Liz M.,"Whittier, CA",2,2,,1.0,11/14/2015,First time at this BJs location and the hostesses were rude. We we're told our seating wait time would be 15 minutes for a party of two. We waited a lot longer than 15 minutes plus people who came in after were being seated before. Don't recommend this location.
Lionel G.,"Monterey Park, CA",597,80,59,4.0,5/8/2015,This place is really nice. The wait is a bit long but to be honest after getting seated and settled I felt like the service was top notch. The servers would connect with you and recommend you food that they think would best fit for your taste. I personally think this place is a good fit for a big group just to socialize and have a good time.  It does get crowded on a Friday night but knowing that it is a big restaurant i would say the wait isn't too bad!  Lots of parking in the parking lot!
Alma R.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,19,32,5.0,11/15/2015,Omg I am so happy that I chose the country chicken it was amazing! !   can't wait to come back again soon!
Belen B.,"Whittier, CA",41,16,9,5.0,4/18/2016,"We came for lunch for my son's 16th birthday, party of 8. The food was very good and the service was excellent. A server brought over a little dessert with a candle, I was hoping for the whole loud birthday experience to embarrass him a little but it was still great. We didn't wait long for a table, check out was fast."
Melanie D.,"Downey, CA",0,9,1,1.0,4/2/2016,"My kids and I like BJs, but the last few times we been here, it's just not good. The restaurant is not busy at around 3pm on a Sat, we didn't have to wait to be seated but the table were dirty and uncomfortable. The server greeted us right away and we were able to place the order. We ordered drinks, app, and a pizza and kids meals, we waited 15 min to just get our drinks, another 25 min to get our app and the food came out a min later. Not a good visit overall."
Joe G.,"Eastvale, CA",407,550,5221,4.0,3/8/2015,Service was great! Food is always good. Calimari and supreme veggie pizza with a couple of beers. The only downside was it took forever for them to bring out my wife's golden beet and arugala salad. For some reason it took forever. We got our pizza before the salad showed up and that was 20 minutes after we had ordered. Not sure what the deal was. Then when salad was delivered the lettuce was wilted. We usually get better quality food when we eat at BJs but that's at our regular spot. We were driving by and thought to check in and try out. FYI : use the bjs rewards and you could do the call ahead seating. Always works well for us. Happy eating!
James J.,"Los Angeles, CA",180,10,1,2.0,4/16/2016,"Food is amazing, service was mediocre  at best to be nice. Server. Was not good at following up on request or giving altertanitives to request. I was not impressed. I was however presently surprised with how good the food was. The Avocado Bacon Burger and the Spizookie trio is too die for."
Marzella G.,"Redwood City, CA",1,10,7,5.0,4/16/2016,"This review is solely for customer service their food is good but our server Alexis was beyond amazing! She was very helpful and attentive, even joked around with us and made us feel comfortable. The hostess seemed a little bothered when they asked her to seat is which is why Alexis made my night more enjoyable! Ask for her when you go in she will definitely take care of you!"
Eric O.,"Laguna Hills, CA",236,219,53,1.0,9/18/2014,"I had just come back from being out of town, and was craving a pizza from BJ's. I happened to be in the area and decided to go here for dinner. I was quoted 10 minutes, but I think I only waited 6 minutes at the most. So far, so good, right? Jessica P. was my server, and visited my table a few minutes after I had been sat. I noticed she had a large party, and several two-top tables, and it appeared she knew one of her tables personally - a lady with a small child in a rainbow tu-tu - as she was spending quite a bit of time at their table. She took my drink order and asked if I was ready to order, but I advised I would get an appetizer, but needed a few moments to look at the menu. Well, I definitely got those few moments - 8 minutes to be exact. That's how long I had to wait for my drink. I didn 't say anything, but kept that in the back of my mind. In fact, during the entire 8 minutes I was waiting for my drink, I didn't see Jessica at all. After I got my drink, I noticed BJ's had some skillet appetizers - so I ordered their equivalent of Texas Cheese fries - shoestring fries, cheese, jalapenos, pork, and verde sauce, so I placed that as an order stressing I was ordering this as an appetizer, and would order dinner later. Jessica acknowledged this and went to wait on other tables and place my order. A few moments later, I finished my Pepsi, and set the empty glass at the edge of my table - a universal sign I wanted a refill. Remembering how long I had to wait for my initial wait, I made notice of the time, and watched and waited to see how long it would take for a refill. It took 9 minutes for her to bring me a new drink. During this time, I saw her talking with the lady with the child in the rainbow tu-tu, and lean at the server station at the end of the row of tables chatting with several servers. She glanced over occasionally at her tables, but that was it. Finally, after about 7 minutes, she walked by my table, noticed my drink was empty, as were all three drinks at the table next to me, and made the comment to both tables, ""I'll be back with drink refills for you"". In the meantime, my appetizer came out, and still being without silverware, I asked someone for silverware, which they brought out to me.  A few minutes later, she brought drinks to all of us, and when she dropped my new drink off, she glanced at my empty glass - I watched her make eye contact with it - and then walked away, leaving the empty glass on my table. Gee, thanks. Because my table isn't tiny already, you're going to leave a dirty empty glass for me to look at. I glanced around at the other tables in Jessica's section and noticed EVERY SINGLE ONE of her tables had multiple empty dirty glasses. Apparently Jessica is not a fan of pre-bussing her tables. To her credit, she DID come by a few moments later and asked how my fries were, and I told her they were good, which was the truth. Although the cheese made my stomach feel weird each time I ate a bite, the rest of the fries were actually quite tasty.  I had now been in the store for about 40 minutes, and Jessica had still not come back to take my dinner order. By this time, I had finished my second Pepsi, and waited to see if she would offer to bring me a refill. She stopped by about 10 or 11 minutes later, after I had finished my fries (I now had a mostly empty skillet of fries, and two empty glasses of Pepsi on my table) and asked if I was good. She didn't ask if I wanted a refill, nor did she ask if I wanted dinner. She just asked, ""Are you doing ok?"" At this point, I just wanted to leave, so I asked for my check. While Jessica left to get my check, I stopped another employee and requested to speak with a Manager. A few minutes later, that same employee came back around and told me a Manager would be stopping by shortly. When the Manager came by, he leaned over, and asked how I was doing. I then asked if Jessica was new, and a look of ""I know what's coming next"" came over his face. I politely asked him to sit down and told him we needed to talk. He obliged, and I recounted my experience to him: my being out of town, craving BJ's pizza, no silverware, the long wait for drinks, no pre-bussing, and most importantly, never being asked what I wanted for dinner.  The manager looked upset, not at me, but at the circumstances which I had experienced. He thanked me for letting him know, and told me he would be right back. I saw/heard him talking with Jessica at the server at another server station, and then he brought me a comped check - taking care of everything ($9 worth of food/drink). I really wanted to have dinner here tonight, but after my experience, I just couldn't stay another moment. The food was incredible, but there was no excuse for the sub-par service I (and other tables) received.  If she was overwhelmed with too many tables, that is on management for having too few servers on hand and/or giving her too big a section."
Lexi C.,"South Pasadena, CA",131,85,27,2.0,9/16/2014,"My girlfriend and I decided to come here on a Friday night. We usually don't do dinner on weekends and forgot how crazy it can be which is totally understandable.  I got there a bit earlier than she did so I checked us in. The main host girl, who was not very friendly or welcoming let me know it was going to be a 20-30 minuet wait and handed me a pager. My girlfriend arrives, we get to chat, next thing you know 30 minutes are well up. Since our pager hadn't gone off we decided to check and see what the holdup was... As we walked up we took a quick glance and it was apparent there were quite a few tables open. My friend speaks to another host girl and explains that we have waited over the quote time. She looks confused. Speaks to the original unfriendly host girl who quickly rolls her eyes and said we're just gonna have to wait. Second girl says ""well it's probably going to be another 25 minuets or so.""  SQUEEZE ME? No little missy. That's where you are mistaken. We have waited over your quote time and now you're telling us to wait longer?? Manager please! Manager heads over to quickly rectify the situation. THANK YOU. Within the minute we are seated... Why??? BECAUSE THERE ARE PLENTY OPEN TABLES! We sat and quickly ordered. I should have started a count as to how many times the hostess walked by and threw dirty looks. If I had a dollar for every time it could have paid for our meals. If we weren't that hungry (or already waited that long) after a long day @ work we could've easily gone somewhere else. If your hostesses don't know how to quote times properly, trust me you're losing business!! Get new girls. Server was good, but unfortunately my food came out about 10 minutes before my girlfriend... Mehhh. I threw in an extra star because it's inexpensive, and I like the atmosphere."
Magaly M.,"Whittier, CA",132,43,87,4.0,11/13/2015,"Snake bite with some saracha queso dip! Queso was saucy, cheesy, and hot!!  Yum. It was 9pm and i didnt want to eat too much but it was still tasty. The server was a bit too dull, kinda like he was ready to go home (he probably was). Over all i enjoy this bjs"
J B.,"Montebello, CA",0,22,4,1.0,6/5/2015,Temperature in the restaurant must have been about 65 degrees. Our entire dinner party was freezing cold through the whole meal! It made for a very miserable meal.  Both men and women's restrooms were closed due to plumbing issues. We had to walk into another store to use the restroom.  Food came out late and was not good. Our appetizers came out with the meal!?! Tasted like frozen food just warmed up! I was unbelievable bloated the entire day.  Servers were very rude and did not greet customers kindly.  We will never be coming back.
George Meredith M.,"South El Monte, CA",6,3,,2.0,10/18/2015,Need a new bartender this girl has no people skills took her own tip. It is funny... took a while to notice i was here. Doesn't make feel comfortable i feel like if she's doing me a favor for me to be here.
