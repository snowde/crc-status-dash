Lupita G.,"Montebello, CA",0,18,15,5.0,1/17/2016,My family and myself absolutely love BJ's. We go there a few times a month always have a great time. We tend to order something different every time we go but we especially love the appetizers. If you ever sit at the bar ask for JAMES  he will make you feel at home every time. He is so friendly and loving my family and I love JAMES.
Amy P.,"Los Angeles, CA",1358,849,1152,2.0,7/12/2013,"On Tuesday, I had made a reservation for yesterday (Thursday) for a party of 12 at 7pm. There is a 20 minute grace period after your reservation before they seat everyone present and give up the rest of the tables. Thankfully I tricked my friends to thinking my reservations were at 6:30 and we would lose our tables by 7pm so we were all here on time =) They almost hated me but .. who could hate the birthday girl?! That's just cruel .. We were seated promptly. The boys went to grab some beer at the bar since there was still 10 minutes left into happy hour. Our waitress was meh. No one else said anything about us bringing beers back to our table but she gave us a hard time - probably because she wanted our bill to add up so she would get more tip. Our food came out in a reasonable time -- 20 minutes or so for the deep dish buffalo ranch pizza. It was just okay. Asked to connect a empty table right by us since we were expecting 2 more people. Our waitress said she would ask and never got back to us. We asked another server and he came back within minutes to help us connect the tables. At the end of dinner my boyfriend told me he told her it was my birthday but she also never brought out the pizookie. Not sure if its because someone in our group ordered their own pizookie seperately? ROOOOOODE.  Too bad I don't remmeber her name."
Yen X.,"Monterey Park, CA",0,67,,1.0,10/14/2016,"It is a Friday night and it's was crowed.... I placed an online order 1 hour ahead of time for pick up at 7:30pm. I got there a bit early and waited a few mins before a young lady asked my name and said to go back to get my food. She disappeared and never came back. I waited another few mins and another young lady came and asked for my name, said she will be right back with my food. She also gone and never came back. The line was forming and a gentleman came and asked if I need help. I explained that two ladies went missing in trying to get my food and he apologized. He asked for my name, confirmed my order and went back to get me my food.....This time he came back, told me all my food are in two bags in front to the side. Waiting on the manager to confirmed a coupon. She came and helped me out and asked the male server to make sure all my food are there and he said yes. I already paid, said thank you and went home...... Then I proceed to grab my favorite Clam chowder soup, I love this so much I ordered two. I opened the first one and it's was mashed potatoes. I ordered one so no biggie...but there were only two white containers. I thought both were soup. I then opened the other, also white, but not soup. Yes, it's also mashed potatoes. So I ordered 1 mashed potatoes and 2 clam chowder soups and i got 2 mashed potatoes and no soup...no biggie. I tried to call the place first to correct this. I was hung up a few times and was trying to get to someone for a good 35 mins of trying, I went to eat my cold food.....and after that? I am here writing this review. You guys owe me two clam chowder soup, please make some effort to provide them as I did paid for them...Also, if not too much trouble....someone to answer the phone to talk to would be so helpful. Obviously the best thing would have been someone who can pack the order correctly in the first place."
Henry C.,"San Gabriel, CA",3,21,1,5.0,2/16/2016,Great service. Our server Michael Cano (who worked the night shift on 2/16) made us feel as if we were home. Great manners and a professional gentleman. He made the experience that much enjoyable. Seek for Michael. You won't regret it.
Jason P.,"West Covina, CA",217,268,206,3.0,11/9/2014,"2nd visit at this location. Came here on a Saturday night around 9:30. Our group of 5 waited about 30 mins for a table, perfectly understandable. Our waiter was polite, kind, and nice. Only complaint was that service takes way too long. We were able to flag the attention of waiters. We didn't have our silverware and it did not arrive about 5 mins after one of my friends had received his salad appetizer. Our waiter only came to check up on us once (he was really nice though) on how we were doing. Food was delicious. That alone gets 5 stars from me. Started off with the mini bruschetta and finished off with the Brewhouse Black and Bleu burger. Definitely a top 8 burger.  This isn't my usual BJs I go to but I experienced the same kind of lagging service even the first time I went here back in 2013. Food is awesome though."
Belinda C.,"Pico Rivera, CA",0,6,2,5.0,4/12/2016,"My family and I took mom for dinner to celebrate her birthday, super pack and waiting for a table for 23 was a long wait but totally worth it.  The manager was super nice and accommodating, they even gave our entire party free dessert.  Thank you for making mom's birthday special."
Yuliya T.,"Los Angeles, CA",26,151,158,4.0,2/9/2015,"I've been here a couple times for dinner, it's alright. It's usually busy but you don't have to wait too long.  The food is good. You MUST try the avocado egg rolls.... they're amazing and the sauce compliments them well.  The pizzas are decent and filling.  I've also had the Thai chicken mango salad.  It was good but I wish there was a bit more spice and jicama.  The employees are nice and attentive. Good experience!"
Uel L.,"Fairfield, CA",45,99,205,2.0,8/30/2015,"This place is so crowded and loud on a Sunday evening dinner. On top of that, the service was lousy and too long. Waiters and waitresses seem to be over worked. The food was cold by the time we got it. Then they forget to bring those condiments we needed for the food. Bt the time we reviewed the cindiment, we already consumed our food."
Josephine C.,"Los Angeles, CA",92,425,1832,3.0,1/5/2015,"On a Saturday, they open at 10am for breakfast. Who knew! The greeters are nice. We sat in the bar area and the place was dead at 11am. Our waiter, Jonathan wasn't cheery but he was good on refills and took our orders. I ordered mini pizza and salad. It was tasty and delicious. The place is clean and lots of places to sit. By noon time, the place was getting busy. It's handy that is in the mall."
Sergio S.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,10,1,3.0,4/21/2015,"Great in check in, but very slow when it comes to the dinner. Steak needs to be cut more when it comes to the lean, chef. More snap to your asparagus as well. All in all, it was an ok dinner night."
Yolanda A.,"Montebello, CA",0,5,,3.0,3/30/2016,First time here for me.  Pizza Cold sent back they reheated it n it was still not hot but pan was turns out a new one was being prepared and different server brought the wrong one out. Daughter order salad order was never placed we were a party of 12 oops anything can happen.  Manager handled situation well.  Other then that kids were happy with dessert.  Lol I guess we'll give them another chance in November.
Maggie C.,"Los Angeles, CA",3683,2700,11555,2.0,12/27/2012,My co-worker & I planned to go to Marie Callender's at first but we had to wait 10 minutes even though there were a lot of empty tables.   Lunch time is very precious..some of us can't afford to wait.  BJ's to the rescue.. We were seated right away @ BJ's and the place was packed. Ordered southern fried chicken.  My friend ordered bruschetta and fish & chips The food was okay but it was cheap and fast. 2 stars!! BJ's restaurant is almost yummylicious!!
Rene M.,"Pasadena, CA",0,4,,1.0,11/15/2015,BAD BAD BAD service... Waitress was not nice at all!! It took us about 10 minutes to get our utensils after we got the food!!! And food wast horrible!! Never never going back!!!
Mireya O.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,5,2,4.0,6/6/2015,"To start we had the bazooki 3o and for appetizers we had the stuffed mushrooms and tomato and mozzarella salad. We then had the shrimp scampi, burger and a new dish in the menu, fire roasted barbacoa chicken.  The bazooki 3o was very good. Not to sweet except for the macadamia one which was a bit to sweet. The chocolate chip one was very good as well as the 3pl chocolate not to sweet, crunchy edges and soft center toped with ice cream made this dish AMAZING! The stuffed mushrooms: now this dish I absolutely loved a crunchy top soft center and drizzled with pesto sauce the taste was very flavorful. I recommend this dish!!! The salad: we very much enjoyed this this dish. Tomatoes were fresh and the flavor was great! The shrimp scampi: the shrimp were delicious with almost a buttery taste to them and the pasta was soft and delicious too but had too much black pepper.  The burger on the other hand was perfection the meat was juicy and a great flavor. The fries with a crunchy thin layer on the outside and soft on the inside had a delicious flavor.  The chicken dish: according to our server, this dish was added last week and I can say it was very good! The chicken was soft with a crunchy crust but the best part was the flavor, very juicy! The service: everyone from the front till our server were very nice. But our Server Jeff B. was what put the cherry on top. He was just great and a delight! We did not have to wait for our food neither was our food brought too early. Everything came just as we finished each dish. He was on top of our drinks and had no problems with our orders.  THANK YOU JEFF B.!!!"
Mo G.,"South El Monte, CA",60,127,53,1.0,8/29/2015,I came here for two birthday dinners including  my own this week. The service  was terrible and our waiter had an unnecessary attitude even though he had our order wrong. Our drinks took a life time and they gave my friend meat in her food even  though  she requested a vegetarian dish.  It absolutely  ruined my birthday  night.
Eva I.,"San Gabriel, CA",471,471,3416,3.0,3/30/2013,"Scampi pasta& Pizookie. That's pretty much my order everytime I come to BJ's. There's an addicting factor to the saltiness of the scampi pasta. It's quite salty but it's yummy! I love the garlic bread that it comes with too. And what's not to love about ice cream on top of a warm cookie (: This BJ's could be better if the service wasn't so off. Orders are sometimes missed, and food takes a while to come!"
Food Lover E.,"Los Angeles, CA",19,250,196,2.0,1/17/2014,"Soggy greasy burger with no lettuce or pickles.  Corn fritters were denser than expected, slightly dry and the sauce was not blended well. Loved the thin crispy fries though. Pizookie was...a pizookie. Service was good. Their sauces suck though.  Salsa tasted like marinara. Creamy avocado sauce tastes like watered down, left over guacamole. Buffalo sauce: good (but also seems like it's bottled). Expansive lunch menu though and prompt seating."
Tony A.,"Montebello, CA",22,1,,1.0,3/25/2016,Fish plate came 20 min. after the steak. Everyone was done eating when I got my food. Never coming back.
Chris A.,"San Jose, CA",4998,745,1908,4.0,4/8/2013,Great place and wonderful service at the bar.  This is only place that open late in the area after 11pm on Sat night lol.   After wedding and we were looking for a place to drink  and driving around and can't find any place that open after 11pm on Saturday night so we ending up here.   There was a lot of table to be seated but we all seat down at the bar so that we can get our order quick.  We all order up some drink and food and I had a wonderful time here.
Jasmine J.,"Artesia, CA",63,3,1,5.0,8/27/2016,"Last time I came to this place I said I was never coming back because the wait was so long and to top it off the server forgot about my table and she took forever with refill. Anywho Ieft an event at the sports arena and wanted to get a bite, so I decide to give this place a try again because it was amongst the only few places open. Anyways the wait time for a table still takes forever about 40-45 minutes, I wasn't too happy about it but then my waiter Steven came and took my order promptly and he was so polite. I told him I was starving and I wanted to order right away. I ordered the rib eye streak and he came back with little garlic breads and butter since he said the steak would take a while. He was amazing checked up on me more than once made sure I had everything I wanted. They also had a free promotion for a pazooki, I forgot to tell him about the pazooki and closed out my bill. He kindly told me that in order to get the free pazooki I had to let him know before hand so that he can comp it on my bill. I told him It was fine, yet he went out of his way spoke to his manager and got me my free pazooki. I used to hate this place because the service sucked but Steven made my experience so awesome I'm willing to come back I hope I get him again, he was so polite and prompt with everything."
