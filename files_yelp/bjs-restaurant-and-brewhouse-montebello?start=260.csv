O D.,"Monterey Park, CA",0,2,,1.0,9/11/2016,"I've been to numerous BJ's in southern California and every time we go to this particular one, I regret going.  As soon as you walk in, there's a wet mop odor that hits you instantly.  The service has always been slow but when you get seated, order an appetizer and get your appetizer and you still don't have utensils... Really?  Then you ask for some and then they don't bring enough for everybody at the table???  The food arrives and we ask the server for more utensils and never comes back with any???  This was on our last visit.  HORRIBLE HORRIBLE SERVICE.  PLEASE GO TO ANOTHER BJ's."
Lola P.,"Panorama City, Los Angeles, CA",0,41,1,4.0,8/29/2014,"BJ's is always consistent with good food and drinks, especially their pizza, baked potatoes, and pizookies.  It's like higher end family dining. My favorite is their happy hour!  My husband and I each have a drink and are stuffed on appetizers for usually around $25.  Our favorites are their cosmos, daiquiris, beer, mini pan pizza, avocado egg rolls, and spinach dip   If you have room, the Oreo pizookie is delish. The service is always great!  You have to sit in the bar for Happy Hour and usually most places don't have the best service there, but BJ's is the exception.  Our servers are always fun, friendly, helpful, and present."
Veronica E.,"Whittier, CA",213,85,83,4.0,9/6/2014,BJ's is always fun. Have great food and a great selection of drinks. They have their own beers they are great ! Not to much a beer drinker so it takes a lot to say that. Piezookie is always so yummy ! Make sure to get there early on game days or else it's a full house.
Brian B.,"Anaheim Hills, CA",426,698,43,2.0,6/30/2014,"I have had so much better.  Service sucked, all the servers need to go to etiquette school. Sitting in the bar with an aisle on either side and every time the server out runner came by they would reach across someone. Ron was taking a bite when they shoved my food in his face. When refilling drinks same thing, when they bothered to come refill, even after being asked for a refill, they reached across people rather than go around the table to the other side.  The food, I got the roast beef dip. It was small, much smaller than and less delicious than say Philippes."
Jesus R.,"La Puente, CA",71,23,14,1.0,8/14/2014,Horrible wait. We waited for over an hour at out table and when the food came it was long from good. Wings were the size of nickels and dimes. Won't come here again. Horrible service...
Laura C.,"Norwalk, CA",33,254,271,2.0,11/24/2015,"Came in with colleagues to celebrate a birthday. I usually order the bison burger although I've never had it here. It seemed really dry while I believe its been moist along with some BBQ sauce. I do enjoy their beer selection and happy hour. Service was eh, okay."
Joanne ..,"Los Angeles, CA",300,31,13,2.0,7/16/2014,"I've been to a few BJ's and this one by far wasn't really impressive. Sat at the bar and ordered a BJ's special. The pizza was okay, but the dirty plates we kept getting was not. We asked for new plate when there was still food stuck on the ones we had. The second one just looked like someone's old plate with grease all over it.  The only plus was one if the waiter, an older gentleman was checking in time to time with a big smile. He was always making sure we had enough drinks.  It's a great place if you want to just hang out for a beer or two but I wouldn't go here for a meal."
Slim L.,"Monterey Park, CA",1,15,3,5.0,1/26/2016,"Love the atmosphere and the food. Met up with a friend and enjoyed their mini deep dishes and brussel sprouts. Everybody loves pizza, but i didn't know brussels sprouts were so good. Will definitely come back for more food and drinks!"
Sandra J.,"Whittier, CA",0,5,,2.0,2/10/2016,Had dinner 2/10/2016 and was not impressed. Service was fast but our server had no intention of helping modifying a plate since the chicken  parmesana with spaghetti was no longer on the menu. I had the shrimp with asparagus over penne pasta and honestly there was nothing about this dish that would make me want to go back. It tasted like a recepie you can find on pinterest. The whole point of going to a restaurant is to leave wanting more of what you ordered right? Even the Arnold Palmer drinks were not evenly half and half. The only good thing about our visit was the  avacado rolls appetizer. You can't never go wrong with these. They are delicious! Overall blahhh....
Marco F.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,3,,4.0,2/25/2016,Great food but most importantly I loved the mojeto  Ask for Sandra she is the best waitress ever we lover her every time we come here
Jeremy B.,"Anaheim, CA",199,13,2,5.0,1/22/2016,"It's refreshing to have a superstar server! I am a food and beverage manager for Embassy suites hotel and it truly is hard to find a customer service driven waitress! Jessica was  fantastic, engaging, friendly and extremely hard working! She is a shining star in your  restaurant and the sole reason for the five star rating! Thank you for your outstanding service Jessica, my family is very grateful!"
Monique E.,"Fontana, CA",0,16,9,1.0,2/6/2016,The service at this bjs is a joke this is the second time I have checked in via their app and been totally disregarded. I check in head there to be told I have to wait the standard waiting time what's the point in checking in online then? What's the point in supposed preferred waiting list? So the hostess tells me come back in forty minutes so I come back in thirty just in case and boom of course they gave my table away and then they say I'm sorry you will get the next table all lies. They put me back on the freaking waiting list and was told by the other hostess it would be thirty more minutes dude I'm done
Cin M.,"Montebello, CA",13,38,18,5.0,11/21/2014,Food is great and service has always been good here. I usually get the Cajun shrimp pasta. And avocado rolls.
Ariel F.,"Los Angeles, CA",117,1,,1.0,7/18/2014,"I came in a few weeks ago and it was the worst experience ever ! I usually come here and I've had no problems, but that day was one of the worsts !  It was about 12:30 when we went in. The waiter comes to out table to get our drinks, we tell him that we are also ready to order, he takes our order and leaves. 10 minutes pass and they bring us our drinks, he tells us that the good would be out shortly. 15 minutes pass and he brings out our appetizer, and says that the would be coming out in a minute. We said no problem and wait, and wait, and wait, and wait, we waited over and hour !!! Everyone who came after us were already finished eating And we still didn't have any food !! It was already 1:45 and we still had nothing. I tell the waiter that I wanted my check and I just want to pay the drinks. He left to get the check and never came back!  25 minutes later, he's comes with the check and says that we should still keep on waiting, I'm sorry but I don't have time to be waiting ! He claims that the food was already being cooked and he couldn't do anything about it. We just paid our drinks and left.  I was here for almost 3 hours and didn't even get food ! This is unacceptable !! I don't know if I'll ever come back !"
Mark K.,"Rosemead, CA",12,111,180,2.0,7/10/2014,"Came here for lunch with my girlfriend, and the last time we were here was a few months after they had opened.  First off the food is just okay, nothing amazing just the same old menu. Second the service was okay at first but got worse as the meal went on. About only 5 minutes of getting our food the waitress comes by to tell us she is leaving (normally thats fine). Then she continues to tell us that if we want desert it has to be ordered in 5 mins before she leaves, right away this was a red flag for desert because we don't like to be rushed. After our silent pause she then continued to say the check is ready and that if we want desert we have to tell her in 5 mins, then another pause and she says ""or"" I can give you to another waitress. At this point the beginning of our main meal was ruined and we no longer wanted to order desert. Won't be coming back anytime soon, you'd think for being open for so long that the service would be better."
A S.,"Pico Rivera, CA",0,12,,5.0,2/2/2016,I am here now.  I have a food allergy to pepper.  I wanted an appetizer of guacmole and chips.  Problem is it has pepper.  Our waiter checked with the chef and it was made without pepper. Most big restaurants don't make anything themselves.  Everything is premixed and served as is Our waiter Efrain made our day. Food was good and so where the drinks
Marc M.,"Bedford, NH",10,19,2,1.0,8/10/2015,"Brought my mom, five year old daughter and nine year old son to BJ's here in the Montebello mall. The first thing I did was to order the kids food, so that they wouldn't have to wait long for their food. After 35mins. with no food arriving, I asked if they could just pack our meals to go. It's now been over 45mins., our food just arrived (in to go containers) but we're Still having to wait for the bill to be delivered so that we can leave. Will not be back anytime soon."
Greg B.,"Whittier, CA",59,5,,1.0,10/1/2015,Service was shit. Five employees couldn't even ask us for our order. Straight garbage
Nate M.,"San Ysidro, CA",30,100,4,2.0,7/4/2016,The service is as bad as advertised. They simply do not have enough employees working during prime hours. We came in as a party of 12 and there was extra charges for things not received. We came in for my birthday and chose this one due to location. The city of Industry BJ's has better service hands down.
Jennifer N.,"Ewa Beach, HI",81,41,120,3.0,7/7/2015,"Advice to all cooks out there. Get your temps right. Especially with the rares and med rares. We who like bloody meat want it bloody. Its not just BJs but most place I go can't give me the bloody meat I want. I am not being a snob, I started as a cook and am now a kitchen manager/chef. I went to culinary school but you Dont need schooling to cook food to the right doneness. Please help the carnivores! The bartender Laura (?) was very attentive and that's why I added a star."
