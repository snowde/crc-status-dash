Shiloh F.,"Whittier, CA",649,113,1614,4.0,11/3/2014,"What really makes this spot for me is the staff and the beer! The food is whatever, but I come due to how welcoming the vibe is. Always a great time here. My buddy and I get a beer thats half Tatonka and half Jeremiah red and call it Red Bison. Give it a try ;)"
Kelly V.,"Pico Rivera, CA",108,48,9,2.0,4/25/2014,So done with this BJ's. Service is so slowwwww and waiters don't care that you're upset because you've been waiting. I gave it a second chance after the first time we came. Service sucked just as bad the first time. Most definitely will not be coming back. One extra star for the food being okay.
Darren L.,"Montebello, CA",110,63,9,3.0,11/15/2014,"Went there for their seasonal beer which was a Belgium Limited Edition abv 10%, ibu 11.  It was so tasty I ordered the two house limit due to the alcohol content.  Ordered the fried artichokes which turned out to be very good, then for my dinner, had the Beef Dip.  Love the horseradish mixed and the beef dipping sauce and dipped my fries in the horse radish dip.  It was very good. Waitress was very attentive to all of our needs.  A great outing."
Francine L.,"Los Angeles, CA",1577,1657,3140,3.0,6/25/2012,"Montebello Town Center is an interesting place and this BJ's is quite popular with a lot of people. I've only sat here for dinner and thought it was pretty nice. Always got to sit way in the back and not that many people eat that late at night. Had a few drinks here and yes they are pretty strong, well for me I'm not to sure about all the other alchy's.  The place is comfortable and you can order a lot of different types of food from pizza, seafood and steak. I would say it is a variety of options that makes me like this place and also just having fast and quick service is always good.  For a chain it's pretty alright and I would say if you want to grab a few drinks with a few friends you can do that sitting down on the tables or they do have a very large size bar area for people to meet some new friends!"
Amanda C.,"Whittier, CA",118,4,1,1.0,5/1/2015,"Worst service I've ever received at BJs restaurant beginning with the Host. Right when my boyfriend and I walked in he didn't acknowledge us and turned his back! Mind you it was a Friday night at 11pm and no one was around. I actually had to greet him! When we were finally seated we ended up waiting 15 -20min before we got up and left. NOT ONE PERSON greeted us or asked if we wanted to water. Before we left I informed the host that no one had acknowledged us and if he could get me the manager. You would think he would have said, ""I apologize! What can I do to for you let me get someone to you right away"" but all he said was ""Oh he's over there his name is Earl"". If anyone ever asks or is telling me they are going to Bjs I'll definitely do them a HUGE favor and tell them to go to Puente Hills or West Co. A little further but worth it instead of getting shitty service. All I wanted was a pizza:("
Julia G.,"El Monte, CA",2,3,2,3.0,1/20/2014,"Today was my first time trying BJs & it was an alright experience. Many of my friends say its really good and all but it wasn't all that. My waitress was nice for the most part, but when I'd ask if she can add something to my tab she would give me a funny looking face that I did not appreciate. Their menu is filled with many selections, which is good.  Their strawberry lemonade was very refreshing! The appetizer, along with my family's plates look really nice & presentable; but my plate (the parmesan chicken) wasn't put very well together. It looked sloppy & was kind of cold.  For a first timer, the experience was ok."
Roman R.,"Azusa, CA",161,6,,1.0,1/14/2017,"This BJ's is by far the worst place I've ever been to. Usually I don't write reviews, but this place was so horrible, I had to share with everyone. First off, my girlfriend and I waited 20 minutes(not bad), but when we got seated, it took us 30 minutes to get our ONLY glass of water and ironically it took us 20 minutes to get our food. But, meanwhile, while we are waiting, there's about 8 hostess up front doing absolutely nothing, one girl was walking around in her phone constantly, and the servers were so lackadaisical. Our server never asked if we needed refills, never asked how the food was, and never had a smile on her face. On top of that, when we were done and ready to pay, we had to wait another 20 minutes. Definitely didn't wanna be there for an additional 20-30 minutes just waiting for our check to be ticketed out. But luckily the ""Manager"" was able to ticket our check. Whoever hired the employees definitely needs a reevaluation on his/her management and hiring skills. The service was so bad it made mediocre food taste horrible and unappealing. If I could give a 0 star I most definitely would."
Brianna H.,"Victorville, CA",0,3,,1.0,6/9/2015,"The food was good! We ordered at 4:25, and we got our food by 5:35. The wait time to eat was horrible! We kept seeing waiters come out with our food, asking multiple tables if they had what we ordered. And every time they said no, they kept going back to the kitchen with our food. Then finally, our food comes out with a server, and she tells us not to touch the cast iron pot that our pizzas came in because they were burning hot. She wasn't our waitress. So, I touch the pot to see if it's hot and it's cold. . So our regular waitress comes and asks how everything is and we tell her ok, or food was wondering for over 30 minutes. And that the skillets our pizzas came in are warmish not even close to being hot. And she says oh there not supposed to be hot. But yet the lady who brought them out said we would get burned. So, don't go here if you expect good service."
Laura O.,"Whittier, CA",54,283,134,5.0,9/1/2014,"Whether you are celebrating a birthday, anniversary, special occasion, or just a simple chosen dinner location, this BJ's does not disappoint! The staff is nice and the food is delicious! I think because of the location though it gets crowded and full very fast so expect to wait outside for awhile but it is worth the wait to dig into their specialty pizzas and beer! :)"
Juan Z.,"Huntington Park, CA",73,67,10,4.0,10/26/2015,This is the third BJ restaurant that I have visited and it was the bit disappoing service that I had. My usual dish is the baby back ribs with the side of steamed broccoli and wedge cut fires. The food was great but it was disappointing that it did not include the bbq dip for the ribs and the ketchup for my fries. I think the waiter might be new but I give kudos for the effort.
Nathan M.,"La Puente, CA",0,3,,1.0,7/14/2016,"So I never leave reviews but I felt like this time I had to, first of all they messed up on an order and the right one came out with plastic in it, second my brothers dish came out super late and to top it off it was my birthday and I had a terrible time, my pazookie and check came so late that I couldn't even stay to eat it"
Coco P.,"Monterey Park, CA",1,33,15,2.0,8/15/2015,The staff was nice and the food was good but I literally have to cancel my plans for the day because it took sooooooooooo long to get served and to get our check. They need way more people on staff
Brittany J.,"Whittier, CA",54,19,8,3.0,3/19/2015,"I come to BJ's on a regular basis the food is always good and the service is above par. Today was an exception. The waiter didn't write down the order (very simple classic burger no cheese no mayo) a few min later he comes  back to ask if I want tomatoes.......uhhhhh if he had written it down he wouldn't have to ask. My boyfriend ordered a pulled pork sandwich which was very good and why the rating isn't lower, but when my very simple classic burger comes out its covered with cheese and mayo. The waiter then tries to plead his case by saying I told him ""no bacon"" which doesn't even come on the classic burger. So bottom line I was very disappointed in what is normally a above average restaurant"
Della N.,"Whittier, CA",21,3,4,1.0,7/4/2015,"I was looking forward to a nice dinner on a Friday night. All I got was a plate piled high with disappointment.  Table for two. 25 minute wait. But it was really only 10mins maybe less. We are escorted through the dining room floor and it was just too crowded. It was like being at a concert. After bobbing and weaving to our tiny table, we get our menus and sit patiently for almost 20mins before our waitress comes by.  Drinks ordered. Water and a lemonade.  10 more mins until she comes back to take our food order. I ordered the same thing I had ordered the last time I was at BJ's. Fish and chips.  She asks me ""wedges or crispy string fries?"" I said, ""Crispy fries."" She confirms by repeating 'Crispy fries' and takes note. Food runner comes out and gives me fish with a pile of wedge cut fries.  .......really?  I hate complaining but I was disappointed.  I had some encouragement to flag the waitress and let her know she had ordered the wrong fries. I tell her.  I don't remember her saying sorry, but I remember her saying, ""keep those fries and I will bring you a plate of string fries."" Another food runner comes with a plate of fries.  The fries were burned.  I'll never go back to this BJ's.  Probably never go back another BJ's again."
Alan K.,"Monterey Park, CA",471,650,10,4.0,10/3/2012,"3.5 Stars, if you will. I like this establishment, I have a few problems with this place sometimes; but at the same time they try to remedy it. I feel so confused about this place because my overall experience here can't be described as consistent. FOOD QUALITY: Do I like their food? Well.. yes. I think they're above-average quality in their pizzas and most of their dishes. Clam Chowder is always a delight to eat. Pizzas are pretty large (but not the best tasting). Sandwiches I feel could shine more if they tried; they taste and feel like average sandwiches. Open-faced burgers are HUUUUGE and flavorful; their pastas are unique but I feel are overpriced. Jambalaya is super oily for sure (thank you andouille sausage.)  To this day I still don't know how or why their baked potatoes are monstrous-sized.  To this day I still think PIZOOKIES are the best thing to eat here.  SERVICE: Hit or miss! I do notice that a lot of times my waiter/waitress disappears for some time to the point where I feel like once I have his attention I have to get everything I want done in one go or else I will never see my waiter again. ENVIRONMENT:  It's pretty spacious in here. Dark. Loud & noisy. Seating is generally comfortable but I disagree with a few of the table arrangements because I dislike having to look forward only to see a family eating in booth seat.  It's very convenient to have a BJs at the mall, so I'm glad that it's just around the corner to deliver some quality dishes."
Nikki S.,"Alhambra, CA",96,4,,1.0,3/3/2016,"Take out service sucks. Called at 9am, they told me to call back at 10:50. Called at 10:50 and was told my order will be ready in 30 minutes. Got to the restaurant and nobody greeted me. Hostesses are no good, just told me to wait until the take out girl gets there. Finally about 20 minutes later I paid for my order. I didn't get my food until 12:07 when I was suppose to have the food for important meeting back at work. When I finally got back to work I realized the sides and soup were missing. I hate to be a bitch about stuff like this since I understand it's the peak of lunch hour but this order was for a lunch meeting at work and for someone to not eat during a lunch meeting it just made me look really bad. I would've gone back to pick up what was missing but I was already late to my lunch meeting. There was only one girl dealing with take out. Disappointed in this place and probably won't be coming back."
Adell L.,"Monterey Park, CA",2,49,,3.0,9/23/2016,"My family and I had a birthday dinner at BJs (9/21/16).  The young man serving us was nice and helpful, he just seemed alittle nervous.  Maybe he was new.  But not an issue.  My issue was the meal I ordered.  I asked for the Cherry Chipotle Glazed Salmon.  I've had this a couple of times before & it was awesome.  But when I took my first bite, All I tasted was SALT!  It kinda left a slight discomfort on my tongue.  I gave a bite to a couple of family members with me to make sure it wasn't just me.  They all said the same, very salty.  The server asked me if I wanted s different meal as a replacement but I said no, I'd like a less salty salmon dish.  He obliged & took my plate.  After everyone was done eating my replacement meal came.  So much better.  But since everyone was done I took it to go.  It was maybe 15 min. wait.  The server apologized & told me to ask for ""low sodium"" next time.   A major chain like BJs should serve each dish the same way every time.  You expect to get what you've had before, the same flavor.  It was funny because at the BJ's in Covina a few weeks prior, the same thing happened. I order the same dish & it was over salty.  I didn't complain at that time but I should of.  Like I said you expect to get the same dish flavor every time.  Let's hope the next time is better."
Sally Z.,"Rosemead, CA",131,34,69,2.0,8/8/2015,I'm not a big fan of BJ's but today was the worst service I've had. Been here many times and service has never been this terrible. We were seated and not once asked if we wanted to start with a drink. We waited 20 mins and had to get up to ask for assistance. Finally Michael came to wait on us. He is very nice and accommodating. He didn't know we were seated which shows how poor their communication is with each other today. I had to vent since I came here starving!
Stephen K.,"Alexandria, VA",181,378,235,5.0,1/22/2013,"Love their happy hour food specials.   I have not eaten at BJ's much and enjoyed getting to try so many of their different pizzas and other appetizers.  Went with a group of friends and shared quite a few appetizers.  The lettuce wraps are great as well! Oh, and try their house Root Beer.  Comes in a frosted mug and is better than A&W."
Andrew  P.,"Bell, CA",27,19,15,5.0,9/10/2015,"So 8 months ago was the last time I actually reviewed this place and again I got lucky and got Chris as my waiter. He still remembered who I was and asked him how the job had changed since the last all he had to say is ""this is a job I love to do because I interact with different people and having them satisfied with their orders and drinks makes me happy because the rewards are great"". His positive attitude after 8 months does impress me because the consistency of his customer service has not changed since I first bumped into him. In this field consistency is key to great service. On top of that Bjs has a better menu to start off they have new wings which look bomb and they also started the OKTOBËR FEST tradition with the new beer on tap. Can't wait till the weekend for the events but for now the vibes and customer service here at Bjs will do along with my Jeremiah red and the first game of the season! LET THE GAMES BEGIN!!!"
