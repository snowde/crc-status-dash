Valeria A.,"Pico Rivera, CA",25,120,12,1.0,5/2/2015,I called to ask a simple question & I didn't hear the girl very clear over the phone so I asked again & she just said no. Then she hung up on me before I can ask my second question. It's very clear that they don't want my service so I'll make a drive further out to another BJs.
Tony M.,"La Puente, CA",271,109,190,4.0,7/10/2014,"Totally cool and casual, can get really busy, not as big as the normal BJs I've encountered, but still a cool spot for some beers and tasty treats."
S C.,"Los Angeles, CA",12,40,3,1.0,4/12/2015,"Tried calling ahead for a take out order at 7:55pm. Got put on hold for over 5 minutes then got hung up on. Strike 1. I was already driving there so I said screw it, I'll just order there. I placed my order at 8:24pm. The guy said your order should be ready in 20 minutes. I went back to my car, waited 19 minutes then walked back in. No one came to the register until 9:00 was told that my order wasn't ready quite yet. So I sat inside and waited, and waited and waited. Food came out at 9:14pm. Strike 2. Got to the car, the pizza I ordered was cold and the salad was warm. Strike 3. It was Saturday night but it was not that busy. Terrible service."
Tevi S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,8,4,2.0,10/22/2015,"The only reason I give this place an extra star than I would it's because of their chicken alfredo, But if it weren't for that I would give this place no stars if I could. I came here for dinner with my boyfriend and the waitress or whatever came to us with an unnecessary attitude well, towards me (I did nothing wrong). She was being more polite to my boyfriend but that didn't bother me because we ignored her once. She said ""Do you need a box?"" at the end to him and when she was already leaving she turned around and said ""or anybody??"" Point here is, because of her she ruined our night, we didn't want to leave any tip but because I'm not such a bitter person I left 3 dollars so she can fix that attitude up. Oh and food took a long time on top of that. Won't come back!"
Nicolette S.,"Long Beach, CA",0,7,,1.0,12/13/2016,"I came here to watch the mnf game with a friend. We wanted the nachos and the menu didn't list any meat ingredients, just black beans and veggies. We checked with the waitress just in case because I'm a vegetarian and she also said there's no meat! Nachos arrive, i grab one, and while chewing it realized there was meat on them!!!!! Vegetarian of SEVEN YEARS over here and i ate meat because of this place!!! This was yesterday and im still sick 12 hrs later because of it. And on top of that, the nachos were prepared terribly. They gave us another order without meat and only about 5 nachos actually has cheese on them. There was no lettuce, salsa, or avocado on them and the menu listed all of them. Instead they were covered in olives which were not listed on the menu and both of us hate olives. These people clearly don't follow the menu so make sure you quadruple check if you have allergies or diet restrictions."
Ara K.,"Middletown, NJ",7,48,34,2.0,7/6/2015,"Came here tonight with my wife and son. We hadn't been here in a few years, but I quickly realized that we weren't missing much. We ordered the  iced tea and a flight of beers which was very good.  For an appetizer,  we ordered the avocado rolls, which were barely cooked on some edges and then some edges overcooked. I ordered the BBQ pizza and my wife had the honey chicken salad. All it was was a fried chicken patty on top of a pulverized bed of lettuce, hard boiled eggs (that were the size of tic-tac), and corn. The waitress brought us the check without asking about dessert. When I see this, I like to drag things out for the waitress, because I know she is dying to leave and go home. What bothers me is that there were still four tables other than us, in her section. If we were the last table, we would have just left without dessert. But we legitimately wanted dessert and ordered some. So, the waitress took the check back and reprinted the check with the dessert added on, but still, no dessert was served yet. Dessert was damn good.....just eat the Pizookies ASAP because they harden and become inedible. It's ok."
Virginia Y.,"Northville, MI",179,253,609,1.0,8/8/2012,"Walked in and was greeted awkwardly, the hostesses looked like they were new and not sure what they were doing. When she introduced us to who was going to take us to our table she seemed nervous because her sentences came out unsure. A new guy who was ""training"" seated us (you can tell he was really nervous but I gave him the benefit of the doubt.  We came here for lunch today because I saw an ad in the newspaper for Party for Two deal for $19.95. You get a choice of 2 salads or soup, a medium pizza, and a pazookie to share. The pizza we ordered (combo) was bleh, it didn't seem fresh, tasted like it was sitting out for a bit before they brought it to us. My bf ordered a turkey cobb sandwich and received a turkey club. He ate it anyways because he didn't want to have to wait for them to bring out the correct order. (waitress seemed like she was in a rush when introducing and taking our order) I wanted to sign up for the BJ's premiere card and asked the waitress if I could sign up, she said ""yeah"" and walked away. I was confused, yeah I can sign up or yeah I'll go grab you a form? So I went online to sign up because I wasn't sure if she was coming back or not. She came back with the form and said to fill it out and let her know when I'm done so she can scan it. I was expecting her to explain the program to me but she just dropped it off and walked away. It seemed as if our waitress didn't care to be there or maybe she just didn't want to wait on us. Her answers were short and she always ran off before we could ask her anything.  We ordered our pazookie and boxes for our leftovers and waited for the waitress to clear our table, she dropped off the pazookie and boxes and didn't come back until we asked for the check. There was no room to eat our dessert, I had to start stacking the dishes so we could make some room at the center of the table to eat it. The cookie for the pazookie seemed really thin, you could barely taste the cookie. I haven't had it in awhile not sure if they changed it or if its only at this location.  Overall I would NOT come back to this location. Probably the worst service and quality of food!!! I normally like you BJ's but you sure let me down this time."
Kelvin C.,"Brea, CA",162,1069,1028,4.0,2/13/2012,"Probably one of the only places in the area where you can grab a drinks and good food all in one package.   They also just upgraded their taps so you can find items like Pranqster, Green Flash IPA, Racer 5 IPA, Sierra Nevada Celebration, as well as several others including their own brewskies.   I do love their happy hour : $2 off apps, $5 mini pizzas, $1 off beer).  Their appetizers are consistently good as I recommend the Tuna Poke, Wings, Sausage thin-crust pizza, Sliders, and the Pulled pork sliders.   I'd definitely recommend that you sit at the bar/counter as that is probably where you'll get the best service...sitting elsewhere could net you some pretty spotty service. 4 stars."
Alex C.,"Los Angeles, CA",114,156,61,2.0,11/18/2011,"First of all, God knows why the people who founded this place named it BJ's. This place has been the butt of all sophomoric jokes ever since I can remember. WHERE are you going to eat? [snickers] I came here for a company lunch. The good thing is they can handle a large group of people. We had 12 in our group.  I'm just going to get right to it. All the food was salty. And I mean salty as in ""I need to drink a gallon of water after I eat"" salty. Is today National Cherish Sodium Day? I could not taste my food at all. It's no wonder Americans are getting so damn fat! I feel my heart racing as I'm writing this review. Our server was a trooper though. She was great at trying to keep our drinks refilled. - First star for the Pumpkin Ale. Yes, I drank at lunch. That's how I roll. - Second star for the Pazookie dessert.  Thanks BJs for ruining an otherwise great name! Boooooo....."
Robert A.,"Whittier, CA",50,145,40,4.0,3/4/2014,"Been coming to this location for quite some time now and figure it's time to apply some stars to BJ's profile. Food is actually really good, as long as you stick to what they do well. In this case the shining stars of the menu are the pizza (both deep dish and hand tossed), the chicken wings, and their burgers. Unlike a traditional Chicago deep dish, the BJ's deep dish takes a more California take on the recipe, meaning it's more doughy, yet still crispy on the outside. The burgers here are also surprisingly good, especially the newer ""Brewhouse"" varieties. Everything else here is about average, except the pastas. For some reason, I've rarely heard good things about their different pastas. So it's best to steer clear. Service is always good, but can feel a little stressed during busy periods. This location gets VERY busy during weekday lunch, so either arrive early or be ready for a short wait if you come for a weekday lunch. Otherwise, shoot for a late lunch/early dinner if you are looking for more personal service and a less packed dining room. Speaking of lunch, they do have some very good lunch specials that are plentiful and won't put a huge dent in your wallet. So that's a huge plus."
Sergio Z.,"Monterey Park, CA",4927,521,7192,4.0,12/8/2013,"BJ is your average gastos/brewery restaurant plus a sport bar atmosphere always packed with raging fans rooting their favorite sports team.  The food is really good depend on your choice of meal, you see in their menu if like pasta, pizza or burger even ribs.  They have a good selection of their beer mix drinks including their limted and seasonal beer.  Me and my wife order the bacon fritter they were so good we try them during the summer when they have the bbq deal. I order the crispy jalapeño burger with wedge fries, first I took a bite it was good it need more flavor but over all I enjoy it.  My wife order the chicken pasta she enjoy it..oh yes I try their pumpkin ale very good with the taste of pumpkin."
Stephanie M.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,23,40,4.0,6/8/2014,Really like coming here on Thursdays night between 10pm-midnight. Happy is great. Prices are good service here is friendly. I think I've interacted with most of the servers and they're kind and efficient.  Happy hour menu is good food. Can't complain this is my Thursday night happy hour spot. Don't come here aside from happy hour.  Beer is great.
Vanessa M.,"Cypress, CA",6,3,1,1.0,9/22/2015,"So first of all, we ask..are there any booths available and got a nasty response from the hostess! Not cool. We knew from there that this wasn't going to be a pleasant dinner. Then, it took forever to get our drinks and order our food. Once our food came, we asked for ranch from TWO different waiters and there went by another half hour waiting. We will definitely not be coming back to this location. Disappointed."
Holly L.,"Rosemead, CA",369,65,15,1.0,12/22/2013,"Im currently writing this from yard house in pasadena. My friend and I had just gotten off work and decided to come to BJs. We get to BJs and were greeted by the host and hostess. We were seated and thats where our service ended. We sat for about 10-12 minutes. During this time we made eye contact with many of the employees, all of which did not come to the table. We didnt even get a ""we will be right with you.""  This has been by far the worst experience ive had. I dont see any reason to come back to this location. Ever. Im sure that maybe it is just one of those off nights but again, I see no reason for coming back which is a shame because I was invited to BJs by 3 employees who came to eat where I served and they were genuinely lovely people. Im glad that I didnt see any of those 3 working during tonights horrible service. Or lack of service."
Sherry C.,"Whitestone, Queens, NY",101,193,719,2.0,2/13/2014,"Came here yesterday and the service was terrible. No water, no utensils, no napkins. 1 star really but I give them 2 for taking the pasta off of our check and I'm just going to assume that I came here on a bad night.  Service was so bad that I was not going to tip them... (but I'm a nice girl and left a 10% tip...) Ordered pasta, avocado egg rolls, & chicken and bacon ranch pizza.  I really wanted to ask if I should eat my pasta with my fingers but I didn't....I should have!  They weren't rude but our waiter was ignoring us for while.  I mean if the food was great or at least decent, then I would have just stayed and enjoyed the food. The appetizer was alright but we waited a really long time for the rest of the food.  I mean a really LONG time.  We even had to grab another waiter for water.  Took forever for our napkins and for utensils.  The pasta had NO flavor whatsoever.... sigh!.."
Elaine L.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,44,8,1.0,5/27/2015,I'm so disappointed at this resturant. I went on memorial day to have lunch with my bf. We order hot wings and pizza right very simple.  Server forgot to bring us utensils. When I wrapped the utensils they were dirty including the napkin it was wrapped in. Thats nasty.  The hot wings came out first they look a bit undercook once I took a bite they were very rubbery.  Ask our server to please take back and have them fully cook to a crunch. The pizza was cold by the time it got to our table oh yeah. I ask the server for plates to eat she just brought one plate. I was thinking its two of us eating.  No attention to wgat was going on at our table.  And it wasn't that busy. I've been to the bj that's in Downey so much better food and service. Never again.
Anne Marie B.,"Monrovia, CA",9,51,,5.0,6/21/2014,"I know what the food will be like when I go to BJs since it's a chain. It's delicious, not very creative, but very fresh.  I'm writing this review in regards to service I recently experienced. The service was superior! My waiter was Bobby Spider. He was attentive to all the tables even though it was really busy at lunch time. He really made our experience excellent with his inviting demeanor and attentiveness to my friend's dietary needs.  Thanks, Bobby!"
Cesar V.,"La Puente, CA",19,20,8,1.0,8/11/2015,"Bad service,  at the bar area, they keep  forgetting drinks food, they bring the food and just drop it off, not realizing we don't have no plates or utensils on tables, the girls just drop of the food and don't bothered to ask if we need to any else or check our table to see if we miss anything, it took over 10 minutes to get 2 beers WOW! How hard is it to pour 2 beers and place was not pack, just don't get it, believe me I'm big tipper when it comes to Resturant service, but please do you job properly."
Jesse R.,"Monterey Park, CA",215,84,39,1.0,1/2/2015,Went in yesterday to crab a bite. I used the bjs app to reserve a seat    Email confirmation was sent back to me for ten minutes.  Keep in mind I was in the mall.  I also went ahead and used the app to order ahead. When I arrived to the hostess station I was told I would have to wait another 15 minutes. The food was ordered and confirmed by the hostess so ok what choice do I have.  We finally sat down and the hostess comes up to us to take our order.  I informed her that we already ordered through the app. 10 minutes later she comes back and says our order was never processed. That's when I should have left. But we went ahead and placed out order again.  Well my drink came out 5 minutes later and hers came out in ten.  Our meals close in total 30 to 40 minutes later.   When asked what was going on. The blame game started and no one wanted to take responsibility     Why is this location always a bad spot to go to. Rumor has it it's a training site and the staff is raw.    Who knows but at least they are consistent with their bad service.
Darla D.,"San Dimas, CA",166,885,685,5.0,3/19/2014,I like the food and drinks here. Happy Hour is always a plus. It can be very busy and parking is decent depending on what day of the week it is. I havent had a bad server as of yet and the Berry Burst Cider is my fav! Total Yumminess! My fav place to have drinks and apatizers in the bar on friday nights ...
