Christian R.,"Monterey Park, CA",3,6,,1.0,9/26/2013,"Where do I start? Maybe the horrible service, the cold food? I rarely come to Bj's, if I do it's because it's near by and their happy hour specials are pretty good. Although, the most recent time I went, it was the worst experience yet. I ordered my food as soon as they sat me down. Maybe that confused them, who knows. But my platter didn't arrive until 52 minutes later! The place wasn't even busy. I had to ask my waiter if there was a problem with my order. He assured me other wise. When my food arrived (small pizza and fries) it was COLD, as if they had it sitting there not knowing who ordered it. I kindly asked for a new order, when they arrive with ""my"" food it's not the same thing I ordered.  Last time I will come to this place. It's no better then applebees."
Angie W.,"Alhambra, CA",1017,600,491,4.0,8/1/2013,"We've been coming by for the good lunch specials. Lately,  they have the BBQ lunch platter for $5.95 & comes with a pulled pork slider, bbq chicken breast, fries & cole slaw.  Some of their salads are very tasty but small for lunch portions.  They also have a pretty yummy flatbread pizza with side salad that's pretty delish also.  Mainly a sports bar, the ambience is pretty relaxed & nicely decorated.  Dinner & drinks are the perfect time for this establishment though the food prices can be high.  The service can be slow but the food is better than most other restaurants in the vicinity.  This location is located near the food court of the mall so when the wait is to long,  we head over to the mall food court."
Jeanette D.,"La Puente, CA",58,28,26,1.0,11/11/2014,"Never coming here again. Waited 20 min to take my drinks and order. Then another 30 min for my water that never came so I just decided to leave. Wow! I'm so disappointed and very hungry. Sucks! So unprofessional. I wish businesses/restaurants could actually respect their customers. I've noticed now a days it's really difficult for businesses to actually do that. Oh well! Nothing I can do, but never come back. HORRIBLE SERVICE!"
Albert C.,"Huntington Park, CA",101,73,45,4.0,11/10/2013,"Some of these reviews are too much. This is not a fine dining establishment, just in case you guys didn't know. This is a chain restaurant and better than the alternatives in the area. Sure, we have our bad experiences but some of you are being babies...  I've been here multiple times and have never had any issues. If the service is a little slow on the weekend, I don't mind because it allows more time to socialize, but come on now... You're expecting fast service during peak hours? You deserve one-star not the restaurant."
Joe G.,"Montebello, CA",96,58,117,4.0,5/13/2014,"I love the happy hour here! The Goliath IPA, hot wings, & avocado rolls are great! Been here quite a few times in the last few months and left with a big smile on my face each time:)"
Vanesa G.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,25,22,3.0,6/22/2015,"Came to eat on Sunday Father's Day.  Everything was good only had to wait 5min server Mike was great, food we didn't try it. I saw a roach come out underneath and we told the host and instead of killing it or removing it he walked to look for something 5 min later my husband had to get up and killed it.i couldn't stay sadly my husband really wanted to eat. Hope next time this doesn't happen"
Jesse A.,"Montebello, CA",1,17,1,5.0,9/10/2015,Came to dinner with the family.  We were greeted at the door by the friendly staff!  We felt so welcome! Darlena and Rae took our names and seated us in a prompt and friendly manner! We were unfortunately seated in a round booth but upon asking for a long booth they rectified the situation even though it was crowded due to the game. Darlena came and switched us likity swift. We always love coming here! Loyal customers!
Marcy M.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",0,3,,4.0,8/6/2015,"Came here for dinner last night at about 8:30pm because it's within walking distance of our hotel. Food and service was good, nothing to complain about. I was with 6 other people and they all enjoyed their meals and drinks as well. Black and blue burger with wedge fries and 2 dark castles after a 5 hour drive hit the spot."
Toni A.,"Montebello, CA",93,35,124,3.0,3/27/2014,They make their own Black Cherry & Root beer sodas.  Can't go with out ordering the pisookie trio too.
Kristina B.,"Los Angeles, CA",164,62,1,5.0,10/31/2014,"I'm giving this location a 5 star rating for several reasons. There's always parking since it's attached to a mall, even if you have to walk a little (don't be lazy. you're probably going to the mall to WALK around anyways). Service is usually fast. If on the rare occasion I can't find something at the  bar, I'm usually seated within 10min. The servers are generally attentive, fast, and friendly. The food is always delicious BJs quality. I truly have nothing poor to say about this location or my experiences. It's perfect after a long day of shopping or just to grab some drinks with friends."
Davina D.,"Rosemead, CA",80,143,25,4.0,2/11/2015,"I really like BJs. I have eaten most of their food before and drank all the beers since I had an ex that worked there for a few years so I know how things are supposed to be and how they operate. I was a little dissapointed last time I went cuz they are getting skimpier with their food! I got the spring rolls and they are super small now. I also got my favorite vege potatoe but it's not enormous anymore! It used to be as long and as fat as a long plate they used to serve it on but it looks like a regular size now on a small plate, I couldn't find it on the menu either for dinner so I  had to ask for it. I really enjoyed the roasted brussel sprouts which is new and you can share that with like 3 or 4 ppl since its a lot! Another favorite is the chicken parmesan, yummy. Pizzas are good too along with the famous pazookie dessert! I still enjoy this place cuz the food quality is worth it despite them down sizing the food a bit."
Jason H.,"Whittier, CA",0,5,,1.0,4/2/2016,"Bad overall experience from the beginning, walked to our table on the most slippery greasy floors ever. Then they served my wife a gummy under cooked California Chicken sandwich. Then when I informed the manager of the meat he proceed to take food without asking what we would like to do with the plate of under cooked food or did not offer an apology. The waiter was not attentive at all and didn't offer much an apology for the food. The least that could have been done was to offer some sort of discount for the gross under cooked chicken that hopefully will not get her sick (time will tell). Horrible experience and we will never be attending this or possibly any BJ's again."
Michael Anthony H.,"Glendale, CA",890,101,20,2.0,7/27/2013,"I have always liked the service and food at my local BJs in Glendale, so when some relatives came into town from Northern California, I figured it would be a safe bet to meet them for dinner at the BJs across from their hotel in Montebello.   As usual, the food was good, but the service was not as good as the food. We called about 10 minutes before walking in and gave our name and how many folks were in our party.  They said there would be no wait when we got there.  Walked in and gave the name, and they said they don't take reservations, so we waited 10 minutes for a table to open up. Waitress took our orders, but we never saw her again for the rest of the night.  Our food was brought out by other servers, and for some reason, one of the kid's orders didn't show up until 10 to 15 minutes after everyone else was served.  I even had to ask another waitress where his order was before it finally came out. Again, our original server was never to be seen nor did anyone come to check on us until we were almost done with the meal. Finally, a new server comes over and starts taking care of us, but never did advise us of any shift change, nor did she even introduce herself, but hey, we were getting full at that point, so I let it slide. Then, it happens...... The power goes out in the restaurant, and we are sitting there for 45 minutes in complete darkness with an ear piercing piezo fire alarm and flashing strobes.  In my younger years, I would have ordered a couple shots and enjoyed the light show, but we were busy catching up with our relatives.   The waitress comes to the table and advises us that she will have to manually calculate our tab and asks us what we ordered.  She returns with the homemade receipt and advises us that we are only getting charged for the entrees.  That the drinks and appetizers would be waived for the inconvenience.  Considering our drink order consisted of 3 kids drinks and one adult drink and 3 waters and the appetizer being calamari, I gladly accepted the discount.   Handed over a large bill and again sat in complete darkness to wait for the change. Waitress comes back and hands me the tab folder and quickly utters that she found my ""correct"" bill and quickly walks away.  I open up the folder and see that I was billed full price ""for the inconvenience."" Whatever happened to customer satisfaction and keeping your word on something you offered to the customer? THANKS BJs for cutting our mini family reunion short tonight...."
Gabby N.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,10,32,1.0,9/22/2014,Customer Service Sucked. Employees were Rude and not very patient. Also my sister read something off the menu and the waiter in a very rude manner corrected her.
Kevin M.,"Alhambra, CA",3,11,3,2.0,10/11/2014,"Horrible service. Even the manager was awful. Just awful. I am never coming back. They forgot our drinks. Food took 30 minutes after our drinks and then the manager asked if we needed anything, and didnt come back with it. WHY BOTHER."
Tiffany L.,"Temple City, CA",1034,251,515,4.0,12/15/2014,This place has really great service! Came here for a bridal announcement dubbed the atmosphere and kind waiters made it very memorable fir our dinner
Jennifer G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,66,71,1.0,4/4/2015,Service always sucks at this Bj's they always take forever to come take your order and they take even more time to serve your food. I literally have to order my dessert once my food arrives because they'll take another hour to bring it out. If you are starving I would not recommend to come eat here!
David B.,"El Monte, CA",24,11,8,2.0,9/15/2014,I miss old Pazookie that BJ's use to make. Came here for lunch and order Pazookie and use to get 10% cookie and now you only get 5% but after baking cookie and thats if its not over cooked you only get 3% . The Pazookie I got today was hardly any cookie mostly scrapping metal pan with my spoon. Maybe BJ's wanted to cut back on the cookie dough used. If this is how they want to make the Pazookie's now then I will stop ordering dessert
Allison W.,"Monterey, CA",0,17,,5.0,6/12/2015,"My family and I stopped by today for a quick bite. The food was amazing but the best part was our server Roquel. She was lively, quick, and made our experience worth while. We watched her be sat 6 tables IN A ROW and still managed to keep everyone happy. Bravo Roquel!"
Michelle G.,"Montebello, CA",1,4,,1.0,11/14/2014,Really really bad service!!!!! No joke the waitress sat us down and left she never came back not even if we wanted a drink. We asked another waitress if she could help us and she said I'll find out what's going on! That girl Never came back!! We just left. Instead of staying we went to KING TACO WAY BETTER. .
