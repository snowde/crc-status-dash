LA Slug V.,"Los Angeles, CA",37,88,139,4.0,3/9/2014,"I like coming to this place to watch sports, eat pizza and drink beer.  It gets packed during football season and any playoff game so get to the bar early if you want to sit by the big screen.  They have smaller TVs all over so most seats in the house are pretty good.  Good food and service.  More importantly a solid selection of beers to choose from."
T L.,"San Francisco, CA",26,439,383,1.0,9/9/2014,"Not one of our best experiences. Service was super slow that we had to keep reminding them about our orders. Pizza was not completely baked that we had to send back, salads that took an hour and just not organized like a big establishment should be. We will not be returning any time soon. The best parts was that they had lots of room, modern style and a huge bar area."
Jessica X.,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",186,201,282,3.0,9/5/2011,"I came here after a long day of shopping with a friend just to get something warm and delicious in our tummies. The food court was closed, so we resorted to eating at BJ's. After being quickly accommodated to a booth near the bar, we ordered the small deep dish pizza: half great white (creamy alfredo sauce with mushrooms and tomatoes all over chicken breast) and half portebello mushroom (flame grilled portebello mushrooms with balsamic vinaigrette dressing all over caramelized onions with balsamic glaze). It all came out to be ~$16 w/tax. The Great White was a bit disappointing because there were no pieces of tomatoes or mushrooms on it.. unless they all magically jumped to the Portebello Mushroom side. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't the best. The chicken tasted plain. It wasn't seasoned at all and I suppose the ingredients in the pizza should have ""seasoned"" the chicken, but you can taste how bland the chicken was. The Portebello Mushroom was alright, but that's because mushrooms is one of my favorite toppings on a pizza. It was good, but I feel like with a name like Portebello Mushroom, they should have put a generous amount of mushrooms on the pizza, but when it came, all I saw was a pizza with a couple slices of mushroom here and there drizzled with balsamic glaze over it. They were a bit skimpy on the mushrooms. If you think the small is too small because it only comes with six slices, you are wrong. My friend and I had two slices left over because we were way too full. Don't forget it's a deep dish, so there's plenty of crust all around to fill you up. The service here started off wonderfully, but ended tragically. It's like they wanted us to stay and didn't want us to leave because when it came down to asking for a to-go box and the bill, they took half an hour! I don't usually come here unless it's for a banquet or birthday or something, but I don't think I will see myself coming here often."
L R.,"Yorba Linda, CA",0,31,19,1.0,4/7/2015,"Would have scored no stars just like Angelica (#228), our server (if we freely assign titles to the lazy). I had to order my water multiple times and though I understand we are in the middle of a drought, the eye rolling was a bit much. Angelica's awesomeness was followed by asking if we wanted dessert, cool right! Well, it would have been had I not been in the middle of my dinner, actively putting food in my mouth. Maybe I led her astray with the whole eating thing because shortly thereafter she brought the bill.   I hope Angelica learns some manners and comes to understand the premise behind ""you catch more flies with honey."""
Tesh R.,"Ontario, CA",80,133,75,2.0,1/10/2016,"First time at this place ever. We sat at the bar to avoid the long wait for a table. The servers were nice. Food was meh. My husband had the bison burger (yeah, IDK wth he was thinking!) and he said it was very bland. The burger also fell apart as he ate it making it less than enjoyable. The presentation was meh. I had a bbq chicken salad and it was pretty good, but nothing to do back flips about. We didn't bother to try the pazookie we always hear about. A guy sat next to me who couldn't get a drink because his ID was expired (lmao) and tried to bribe the bartender with ""favors"" from the dealership he worked at (what a joke). One of the servers got smacked in the face by the door and none of her coworkers bothered to go to her aide (talk about team work!). I felt bad for her as she stood there holding her nose and people were just laughing! Just awful!!! As far as returning, only if the wait at Olive Garden is beyond ridiculous."
Cathy L.,"San Gabriel, CA",244,28,5,4.0,3/3/2014,"PLEASE DO NOT GET THE SPAGHETTI WIT MEAT SAUCE AND MEATBALLS!!!! Save ur money for something way better! its so bland and barely had any sauce at all. I had to ask for more sauce and they gave me 2. When I asked for sauce for to go since I couldn't finish it, they gave me 2 sauces again (cause they know its so dry and bland). I would definitely need those 2 sauces when I eat it as leftovers :(  The big appetizer plate was probably the best thing of the night, a few people said that at my table of 11 and I would have to agree The service is superb!!!!! Our original waitress went on break so another waitress helped us and this waitress was so much better!!! She was enthusiastic and seemed like she actually liked her job or at least didn't mind serving you. The first one was more like a robot. blahh!"
April P.,"East Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",82,9,4,2.0,4/5/2015,This place sucks the service was terrible the waitress took 30 minutes to take our drinks. Normally I understand food takes a while to cook but there were hardly any people here today and it was still taking forever.
Tommy Smalls S.,"Pico Rivera, CA",30,54,75,5.0,4/1/2015,Great service from Alex. He went out of his way to make sure my table stood full. He looked out for us on happy hour and all. Over all he made this a very good visit plus a well deserved tip. Peace Tsmalls
Sandra R.,"Montebello, CA",0,83,32,5.0,4/23/2014,Lllooovveee coming here.  Love the grilled Atlantic salmon..mushrooms appietizers... Love the ambience... Def reccomend it...
Arric B.,"El Monte, CA",1,10,19,4.0,6/17/2015,Good food / great service! Patricio did a great job of getting us exactly what we ordered in a timely manner. He continuously checked on us to make sure we were content with our food and service. I had the club sandwich which was a little too salty for my taste and the mozzarella stick were a little too fried but the rest of the dinner was good.
Jose M.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,5,8,1.0,11/8/2013,Very rude service as soon as I walked through the door. The food here is not fresh and I will not recommend this place to anyone unless u like paying top dollar for a frozen TV dinner! Long wait time and unhelpful front desk plus bad food! Next time I'll just try the food court at the mall!
Rom S.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,38,8,1.0,10/20/2014,"This place is a ridiculous, I was there a few times and got bad service every time, it's like no one there is even care, the food comes different then what is the menu and the servers are almost rude, I got bad service in the bar and on a table as well, one time I was waiting for my order on the bar for so long when ppl around me came after me and served before me just cuz I am a regular, when the food came so late, my table wasn't even set yet. When I called the server on that he opinionated at me deciding I am ""cranky cuz I'm hungry and I am afraid my food will not come""  no I am cranky cuz your service sucks. I called the head quarter got the same attitude, I guess the fish stick from the head. Now I only getting to go orders to avoid the horrible service."
Eric M.,"Santa Monica, CA",377,426,116,4.0,9/9/2013,"BJ's is BJ's.  You know what you're going to get.  The four stars is purely for the service.  It is fantastic.  Friendly and attentively.   We also enjoy the $20 deal.  Two salads/soups, any medium pizza, and dessert.  Unbeatable."
Eder P.,"Los Angeles, CA",357,608,122,4.0,7/29/2011,"Every Bj's I go to is always great. Good service, nice servers. Food always comes fast, which is amazing. I always fear they have these plates ready and they just microwave em' since it comes out fo the kitchen so fast. I read other people's reviews... sorry you're dumb if you dip you're steak in tabasco sauce... there's a thing called STEAK SAUCE... so I'm guessing the problem with BJ's is that people that never go to restaurants and the only thing they know is BJ's can easily complain. You know there's a few Taco spots down the street I'm pretty sure would suit their small brains. Go here and enjoy some good food. I had the Pork chop from the healthy part of the menu. Good eatin' with that there. Oh and give their mojitos a shot too. No drink on their list is a wrong choice."
Anita G.,"Pico Rivera, CA",30,38,18,2.0,4/12/2015,"Still not impressed with this place, and that's why I stopped coming here. Service was horrible, no refills on drinks, no asking how we are doing, and dirty plates left on tables from previous patrons. We were escorted to our dirty table, but had to wait for it to ne cleaned before we could sit."
Joel B.,"Los Angeles, CA",42,17,8,3.0,4/9/2015,"It's disappointing that my favorite restaurant have so many flaws. I've moved from Temecula less than a year ago and the BJs there does not compare to any other in this area. This is my family first visit to thus location. Our host sat us in the center aisle where is the busiest. Problem is that I have a 3 yr old girl and a 6 month old boy that we don't like to sit on high chairs for safety issues. We asked to sit on a booth and the hostess was kind enough to accommodate us on a booth at the far end of the restaurant by the restrooms(I did not mind that). The waitress came to take our drink and appetizer order but we went ahead and order our main meal along with appetizers. We received our meal and drinks, no appetizers. The waitress completely forgot about our appetizers. Any other place would've gave us a free lemonade or something for the trouble. We just got an apology."
Fairuza H.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,12,14,4.0,6/6/2015,OMG today was the best day at BJ's! I had the best dinner while everyone was screaming for the soccer game! Go Barcelona! Woo! Woo!
Angel A.,"Temple City, CA",4,9,2,1.0,4/6/2015,"This place is insane! So I'm sitting at the bar and I finish one drink, can you tell me why I waited an hour for my husband to actually order my drink. I'm at the bar!! If my drink is done why the hell wouldn't you ask me if I wanted another drink! This is fucking insane!"
Angela T.,"El Monte, CA",211,316,183,2.0,5/2/2011,"Yet another bad service review. I think they really messed it up for me  this time.. If you can see, they just lost a star from my previous review. I ordered Parmesan Chicken. Some way or another, my waitress can mess it up and bring me Chicken Parmagiana or something of that sort. I tell her and she gives me the worst attitude ever with annoyance in her voice and her eyes rolling! To avoid missing my class, I say, I'll just keep it, even though I'm furious. Good thing, the manager came over and apologized and tried to fix things! (he's the reason why I'm not giving it 1 star!) He took our appetizer off the bill and  we just paid for the entrees that were ordered. The order I got? It was horrible. After I ate it, I literally felt nauseous. The chicken wasn't even chicken. It's was breaded cheese with cheese on top. -_______- Their spaghetti with spicy marinara sauce tasted like plastic. I don't even know what to say. Whoever cooked my dish needs to be fired. Immediately. Especially when he's cooking that crap? Me thinks so."
Rios M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,7,,1.0,11/22/2014,"5pm 11/22/14- First off let me say that we never received our appetizers and they still tried charging us for them until I brought it up to the server. Then on our way out I asked for the 4 piece pilsner cup set that was advertised for $11+ tax and the manager, Mark H charged me for each individual one, and the total came out to $15.26. When I brought it up he said thats how much it's supposed to be with tax which is bull. When my friend payed for his individual cup he gave him the exact change. Mark dropped it then told another server, ""It's not the right change, he probably lied. "" I also heard Mark talking rude to his server telling the young man ""get over here, NOW."" in a horrible tone. If I could I would give this place no stars."
