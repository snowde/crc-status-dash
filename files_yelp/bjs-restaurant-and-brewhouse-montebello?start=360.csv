Rick S.,"Upland, CA",15,75,4,1.0,3/10/2013,"From what I understand, BJ's-es (what's the plural of BJ's?!) are very good. I wouldn't know. I've been in the lobby of the one in the Montebello Town Center, but that's it. We walked into the restaurant and stood in plain sight in front of the desk where three female staff members were deeply enthralled in their own conversation. It must have been extremely important, because they never said a word to my friend and me. They never even looked our way. So ... I walked to the counter, not 6 feet away from them. Still nothing. I cleared my throat loudly. Nothing. I said, ""Excuse me."" More nothing. We left.  I'm sorry, but I don't want to beg to be noticed in a restaurant. I want to be more important than staff members' gossip. .  It's funny, I didn't get a single morsel of food or sip of drink at the Montebello BJ's, but I left with a terrible taste in my mouth!"
Nelson B.,"San Gabriel, CA",2,123,67,1.0,2/8/2015,"I recall trying there breakfast and it was delicious.  However, today experience was horrible from beginning to the end.  First of all, the server can't get my order correct and had to correct her 3 times.  Second of all, they kept forgetting to bring the food I ordered.  Third, once the food came out it tasted disgusting.  The country potatoes were bland.  The pancakes were just as bad.  I will not come here ever again."
Jolene B.,"Montebello, CA",3,9,,3.0,4/30/2015,Bj's Pizza is beautiful inside and out there are just a few things that i was not happy with one my food took very long to come and our server as well. The food was good but needed more flavor on the chicken alfredo.
Naomi D.,"Glendora, CA",92,8,,3.0,5/30/2015,The food here is good but the service needs work. It took us over an hour to get our food. It shouldn't have taken that long.
Nicole G.,"Las Vegas, NV",755,454,410,2.0,5/29/2011,"Pizoooooooooooooooookie! yep thats the only reason why i like this place & think it's okay.. The pazookie is the ultimate desert. Giant cookie that has the taste that can blow your mind, yep I order it every time!  other than that the food is just like every where else.. plain. The pizza has no flavor, and the last time i got pizza here it was cold. WTF!? Considering that when i came it was slow that is just unacceptable. Had the steak and it was super overdone. I don't even think my dog would have wanted to chew on that. he'd pick his bone. The veggies here have no seasoning. Were they just picked form the ground. Um no, that would have to mean they're fresh and they certainly taste frozen.  Good place to come in groups. There service is not bad. Not exceptional though. They do they're job and do nothing more.  Not up to my standards thats for sure."
Cindy L.,"Los Angeles, CA",181,774,55,4.0,11/11/2011,"BJ's Happy Hour: Mon - Fri (3-7pm) & Sun - Thurs (10pm - close) - yep! late night HH!!! At the bar - self seating, good amount of space.  Specials: $1 off beer; $2 off appetizers (excluding small bites & snacks? or something); Half off mini pizzas (comes out to about $5-6 during HH).  We tried their buffalo chicken mini pizza (4 slices) & it was really delicious! Full of flavor and not skimpy on chicken. Crust was a little soggy though. Also got their chilli cheese nachos (called something else on their menu) & it was MASSIVE. I think we barely made a dent in it. The weird thing is that the chilli is in the bottom of the dish, so it was challenging at the beginning to get some chips & chilli together.  Taste wise, even though fresh, it could've used chicken (add'l charge) & some guacamole. Yard House Chicken nachos are waaaaaay better & cheaper during their HH.  The time frame & the variety of offerings is good enough for me to want to come back & try out more things. Service is definitely lacking/slow but understandable because they are usually SWAMPED with customers. So patience comes in handy. Be prepared to flag a server down after you get seated for menus/orderings & such.  Parking: easy - outdoor montebello mall parking (but probably nightmarish around the holidays)"
Mary B.,"Huntington Beach, CA",1,19,6,2.0,5/27/2015,"This restaurant has gone down in quality of food lately. It is extreme large and loud. Servers are overworked and snippy. The chili tastes like it came from a can but the macadamia nut pizzoki is pretty good. Hostess are always pleasant. Management is rude and corporate doesn't care as I texted them.  BJ's has grown too fast. No longer personalized .It is good place to grab an ale though,and watch a game if you're in the Mall"
David A.,"Costa Mesa, CA",1066,585,1044,3.0,12/17/2010,"Typical for a BJs, but not my favorite (HB is).  Smaller than most.  Its one redeaming factor (if you call it one) is that it is attached to a mall.  Only one that I know that has that feature. Wait staff was nice.  Clients were friendly, though sloshed. I continue to order off their secret menu (Flatbread pizzas can be ordered of any of their specials and those are half off during happy hour.  You can also usually order off the lunch menu at any time.).  Am very disappointed that they took the shrimp skewers off the small bites menu.  Pushing them to get them back on."
Kayden H.,"Los Angeles, CA",19,116,1229,4.0,3/5/2013,"Try this place back when it barely open in the mall, but been wanting to come back since I have been getting advisement in the mail about there lunch special.  Came on a weekday and the place was pack, so it must be good.  Got the lunch specials and some burgers.  Everything was good, and service was fast and friendly.  Probably will be coming back to try other things on the menu during lunch."
Norberto S.,"Los Angeles, CA",24,23,5,2.0,5/9/2011,"I ordered a Top Sirloin Steak and trust me, there was nothing ""Top"" about it. Almost thought I  was chewing on some gum, the steak felt dry.  I had to submerge it in a sea of Tabasco sauce before I was able to get a good taste from it."
Christopher B.,"Tampa, FL",29,10,4,4.0,2/7/2015,"Delicious food, although the service from the hostesses can be a bit spotty at times. Still, great environment to watch a sports game as it is spacious and very welcoming for large parties. Give it a shot!"
Marco J.,"Los Angeles, CA",158,217,470,2.0,10/13/2011,"I sometimes come here with my coworkers after work. Let me start off by saying that the service is pretty much bad to moderate on any given day. The only time I had good service at this BJs was on a slow day when I sat at the bar with a date and the bartender was very nice. Besides that, the waiters and waitresses often forget orders, take too long just to bring drinks, and will sometimes bring you your box for leftovers like half an hour after you asked for it. Now onto the food. It's pretty much basic fare. The broccoli cheddar soup is really good, as are the wings and stuffed mushrooms. Everything else is pretty much OK. I've tasted much better sandwiches and fries elsewhere. The real highlights are their Pizookie dessert and their Irish Root Beer drink. 2 1/2 stars."
Travis C.,"Whittier, CA",0,2,,1.0,5/3/2015,Let me start by saying love bjs pizza go at least 2 times a week..but after my visit to the one in monobello.. Was waiting over 30 min to just get some water. They seated a couple next to us and they got there water within 3 min.. They said y they didn't even know who my server was. I left went Applebee's got my drinks and appetizers within 10 min..I would give no star if poss. Never will I go to bjs again in any state or county
D J.,"Pico Rivera, CA",17,3,9,5.0,4/29/2015,Pretty cool for a wed. Out having drinks with some friends didn't expect so many peeps out but enjoying the evening out.
Stacy K.,"Brea, CA",0,40,10,1.0,1/4/2015,"My fiancé and I came in today for brunch. It was really slow. We walked up to 5 girls in the front sitting there chit chatting. Not at all friendly! We stood there for 5 mins just looking at them until a girl said ""I can take you"" we followed her to the table and was seated. When I asked for a booth she replied ""there's nothing open you're going to have to go back up and wait"" the place was empty!! So I said nvm it's fine. We sat and here comes our waitress. She didn't introduce herself and seemed miserable to be at work.  barely opened her mouth and I could barely hear her. She didn't have a smile on her face. It was as if I was interrupting her lunch!!  When I asked for a turkey club (I read it on the (menu) she said we dont have that. She didn't give me other options. She just stared at me. The worst service ever!!"
Sam E.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,,3.0,2/15/2016,"Only reason this place is getting a 3 is because our server Jennifer was awesome! Great service by her! The host in the front with short hair and the girl that sat us were pretty rude. She awkwardly offered us a spot at the bar but we declined, and when we did she rolled her eyes. Her and the other girl seemed pretty high but hey more power to ya."
Steve C.,"Pasadena, CA",2,10,,5.0,7/26/2015,"Good food and friendly service! The pizookie is really good too, they give a free one on your birthday!"
Jessica S.,"El Monte, CA",2,8,5,5.0,3/22/2015,Bianca is the best server ever!!!!!!!!! Extremely nice and very attentive!!!!! She's awesome and the food is awesome as well :)
Nicole G.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,34,5,4.0,2/18/2014,"We ate here over the weekend and the food was delicious as always.  The service was exceptional.  Unfortunately I don't remember our waiter's name but he was great with the kids and the service was super fast.   The best food on the menu is the Brewhouse Black and Bleu Burger.  I wish I could afford to eat there everyday, both in my wallet and in my waist.   The Bloody Mary is pretty great too."
Derek W.,"Los Angeles, CA",467,633,2477,3.0,11/20/2010,"Located minutes away from work, not sure why I don't head here for take out food more often.  I've only been here a few times, but recently a coworker ordered their Mediterranean pizza and damn was it tasty.  We also ordered some of their chicken wings to share.  What's weird is that they don't toss their buffalo wings with the hot sauce and just simply package it on the side for you.  I have not dined inside the restaurant so I'm not sure whether they do this on purpose (to keep the wings crispy?) or not but it is different. Will have to try some of their other dishes one day."
