Kat G.,"Los Angeles, CA",188,60,2,3.0,4/10/2013,"Okay, I love the food here, I love the drinks here, but I am really not a fan of the service.  Don't get me wrong, the service here isn't TERRIBLE, but it's definitely not worth the amount of money you end up spending here. I think that a place like this, that tries to pride itself on somewhat ""gourmet"" food and drinks, should really also work on Grade A customer service as well.  Luckily for me, I haven't had just one bad experience with the service here, my opinion of the service is mostly based on the fact that every time that I've been here, the service was just not that great.  I'm giving 3 stars because I still enjoy their food & beer.  Minus two stars due to long waits (even on weeknights?!) and waiters/waitresses who rush your order, get it wrong and constantly have to be reminded to bring something you asked for.  You know what though? All in all, the bad service still isn't enough to keep away from this place . . . it just makes it so that this place is not my first choice in restaurant/bars to eat at."
Sophia P.,"Alhambra, CA",70,13,17,5.0,6/21/2014,The server there by the name Jonathan is the best server ever! Super attentive and so nice to us! He definitely deserves a raise $$$ oh and food is good as always
Vanessa P.,"Bell Gardens, CA",3,8,11,4.0,1/31/2015,"Customer service is great I love coming here every weekend, but unfortunately I'm disappointed that they no longer have the swirly noodles for the Alfredo pasta. That's the only reason I come to BJ's all the time!  All my friends loved them and my family now I got to break the news to them :("
Liz D.,"South Pasadena, CA",81,116,38,1.0,5/1/2014,"For the start we got the calamari rings, to eat she had the burger and i had the shrimp scampi with clam chowder soup.  I forgot the girls name but she was a little weird. Not friendly and not rude, just weird. She asked about my watch and when i told her where i had gotten it she made a face. I don't know why, but whatever, bring me my food!! *I understand that the calamari rings are fried, I've eaten them plenty of times. These were disgustingly drenched in oil. It was more oil than calamari GROSS! * Clam Chowder was good in salt and flavor. * The shrimp scampi had more than 5 pieces of shrimp which was awesome! The taste of the sauce was a little off, it had that burnt taste to it. Since I was hungry I ate some and took the rest home.  When we were done the girl brought back the check and kept standing around for us to pay, i thought that was a little rude, especially since we weren't done with our food and drinks. Once I was done paying She brought back my receipt and was out of our sight. We left 30mins after that. I never once bothered to check and see if my credit card was back in my purse. Went to work the next day and as i was pulling into the gas station i began to pull my hair because my card was not in my purse, little did i know my card was back at BJ's!!!!! I called right away to find out ; the girl who answered asked me a million questions just to ""verify"" if it was my card. For example: What color is the card? Whats the name on the card? What kind of card is it? What are the last four numbers on the card? What are the last three numbers on the card?... IS IT MY FUUUUUU**ING CARD OR NOT????? I was frustrated and going crazy, she finally said: ""yes its here, will you be picking it up today?""  Me: Yes! I will be swinging by tonight at 10 or 11 pm!!! Her: Not a problem see you tonight! I showed up later that night at 11:15pm just to hear ""sorry we don't have any cards with that name"" WTF!!! That was another scene! Long story short, i had to wait 30mins to speak to a manger before i got my card.  Never again BJ's of Montebello"
Satish E.,"Montebello, CA",7,2,,4.0,3/29/2015,I had been here for 3-4 times... you get chilled brewed beer... food is good too...! I like tavern cut pizzas here...only problem with this place is that it's crowded on weekends and u need to wait for the table...
Rolando P.,"Los Angeles, CA",35,208,183,2.0,8/15/2012,2.5......Waiter was distracted and not attentive. He would disappear for long periods of time (about 10 mins at a time).
Kevin R.,"Montebello, CA",0,2,,1.0,3/11/2015,"Ordered the fish n chips, received 2 pieces of burnt fish, and 2 pieces of batter with no fish inside!  I was looking forward to it, and it was so disappointing!!  The server was very nice."
Cintya P.,"La Quinta, CA",190,441,517,3.0,1/12/2011,"I just came back from BJ's and I think it's time to update my review from the last time when I stated that my job here was TEMPORARY. Yes, I came back after a couple of months  and it seems not much has changed. Well, they do have some new menu items like the mini tacos, the spinach stuffed mushrooms, the BJ's baked beignet and the berry crumble. Nothing too spectacular to me though. However, I can say that the service tonight was one of the best I've ever had at BJ's! Maybe because it was Happy  Hour (3-7pm)  and the waiter was such a nice guy and the hot wings were decent! It was a good night at BJ's in Montebello after a hard day of work! On the other hand, I did not really get that WOW factor that BJ's strives for.   I'll leave at three stars because of the service tonight."
Ashley V.,"San Gabriel, CA",198,228,148,3.0,5/23/2013,"I've come here numerous times, and each time was a hit-or-miss. Sometimes I get great customer service, sometimes not so much. Food is average. They have a good selection to choose from, ranging from sandwiches, to pizza, to salad, etc. Wait time here is usually a while bc it's always packed. It's conveniently located at the Montebello Town Center, so I'm sure alot of people go eat after shopping. Since it's at the mall, parking is mall parking."
isaac b.,"South Gate, CA",12,8,,1.0,5/21/2012,"This is a review of my experience at this location that i left on BJ's Facebook wall. Just want to share my worst experience ever at a BJ's restaurant. Last thursday, i called BJ's Montebello to place an order to go (mini pizza, grilled chicken salad, pasta and 3 soups). That was at about 11:05, 5 mins after opening. They took the order down fine and said it would be about 20-25 mins. So i drove over, got there 25 mins after i called. They said the food would be a few mins, i said thats fine and took a seat. About ten minutes after, they came out to tell me they dont have the soups i ordered. Also that their computers were down. Fine, i cancelled one soup and replaced the other one with a soup they did have at the time.  As all this was happening, several customers came in after me, picked up their food and were out. So i had now been sitting there for about 20 mins. I eventually had to get up and ask for my food. They said, since our computers are down, we cant remove the soup from the bill and just stared at me, maybe just waiting for me to say thats fine? The employee helping me had a very poor and rude attitude. I could tell she was very frustrated, but that is no reason for them to take it out on a customer, especially one that has been waiting for over 20 mins for food ordered over 45 mins before. So she eventually took the soup off the bill by using a calculator like i suggested, she took a carbon copy of my credit card and just handed me my bag. No sorry for the wait, sorry for the inconvenience. Nothing! I did not receive a receipt, and to top everything off, when i got to my destination, The chicken on the grilled chicken pasta was badly charred, and no i did not order the blackened chicken, and they did not throw in the side of buffalo sauce i ordered for my pizza, which was also made very sloppy.  I have been going to bj's for years, and only once or twice been disappointed, but i have continued to go, because of the awesome food. But after this, it will be a long long time before i go back to a BJ's restaurant. And i will NEVER go to BJ's Montebello, even if lunch is paid for by a friend.  Please take a look into the opperation at this location. My sister, for whom i bought the food, also says she's had poor experiences at that location. Her and her husband also refuse to eat there.  Thank you."
Byron A.,"VALLEY VILLAGE, CA",42,131,17,4.0,9/14/2012,"A lot of negative reviews on this BJ's. I wonder why. My experience was pleasant. We were seated immediately and our waitress was really helpful and attentive. I live near the Burbank area so have only been to the BJ's in Burbank, but this one wasn't bad. Same selection of foods and drinks (it is a chain after all) and even though I usually stick to the pizza this time around I decided to try a low calorie chicken item on the menu and was pleasantly surprised at how tasty it was. Overall it was a good dinner experience."
Mr. M.,"Las Vegas, NV",233,78,87,4.0,6/4/2014,"sat at the bar and order some drinks.  happy hour pricing is on point.  The food needs a little help but still not bad for the price.  Bartenders make nice drinks and pour beer correctly.  They are also friendly and helpful.  Hostess needs work, they are to busy tending to their own needs."
McQueen Q.,"Montebello, CA",4,105,18,3.0,8/3/2014,"I personally like this place, but my husband hates it. I love there Long Island and the sampler appetizer is so good. Every time I've gone I have had great service but this last time I have got really disappointed. The waitress never came to our table. In order to  order we would have to get the attention of Another waitress. My husband hates this place since they don't accept his ID since it's a Mexican is. Even if he takes a passport they go ask there manager ."
Joelle R.,"Covina, CA",42,79,5,1.0,3/30/2014,"Been here a few times and just like everyone else says, the service sucks. Other locations are much busier, yet you get better service there. They make you wait forever for drink order, food order, and anything else you may need. Food is okay if its not served to you cold because they took forever. I would drive a little further to avoid this location."
Regina X.,"Los Angeles, CA",260,29,10,5.0,11/17/2014,Food is good felt a little rushed with the tab but they are just doing their job. It was a busy night other than that its a great place better than apple bees I will definitely keep coming back.
Paul D.,"Los Angeles, CA",11,38,11,3.0,5/20/2010,"I honestly love BJ's and constantly go as often as I can. Let's start with the hostess, I don't remember her name exactly and I wish I took it down but she wore eye glasses...  I know I know that doesn't really narrow it down but whoever she was, she had to be one of the worst hostesses I've ever experienced at a restaurant.  She did not even say one word.  After she was assigned to us she just expected you to follow her without acknowledgment and just stood by a table without telling you directly that it was your table.  Sure I guess these are little complaints but communication between an employee and a guest would not hurt. So just like the BJ's in Burbank we had to wait in between 15-20 minutes just for someone to ask us if we wanted anything to drink.  Because so much time had elapsed we were also ready to order our food but they just left once they took our drinks down...  WTF?!?!  So another 20 minutes passes by and our drinks finally arrive and our main order is finally taken down...  Another 20 minutes and we were finally in pasta heaven... See... I do love the food quality from BJ's but the service is so close to $4!T it's not even funny...  We had an apathetic hostess and literally waited in between 50 minutes to a whole hour just to enjoy a meal...  If I would've known this was going to happen I would've just eaten at the Jack In The Box down the street and gotten my food within 5 minutes to enjoy... So a 3 is all they get just cuz they got the food right..."
Lizzy M.,"North Las Vegas, NV",54,13,10,5.0,11/12/2014,"Wow! On my way I called ahead for a party of 6. They put us on the list and by the time we got there, our wait was less then 10 mins. It was a Saturday night at 7. So of course it was packed! I couldn't even tell. The service was absolutely awesome. Also the chicken wings were amazing. The quality was through the roof. Our pizza's were served quickly and were delicious. Also. We got a free pizzokie even though our bill was only $98.70. I totally recommend this BJS for any size party. Food was good, the service was better!"
John D.,"East Los Angeles, CA",1,11,,1.0,7/4/2015,First started coming here a few years ago on a regular basis and it was okay. Recently it's gone downhill. Always mess up our order and double charge us. Management sucks. Staff are nice but incompetent. Just save yourself some money and go to McDonalds.
Lorraine S.,"Downey, CA",0,4,,1.0,6/6/2014,"Awful, awful, awful!! Came here for an end of school year luncheon. I swear everything was prepared in advance! As soon as we sat down, no sooner than 10 minutes our food was served! Cold DRY burgers and cold pasta dishes! The female bartender...a true snooty patootie!! A not so good experience! I give it a one star, because our waitress was sweet. BJ's is so over rated! I use to enjoy the chain...but recently it's taken a dive...even the lemon drops...not so good anymore."
Shan L.,"Los Angeles, CA",309,303,1518,3.0,7/9/2012,"Came here with the kids after a ROUGH day. We were tired and really hungry. We were greeted by a nice hostess that informed us that if we ate in the bar area we could take advantage of the happy hour menu. Well,  we couldn't find sitting in the bar area and had to sit in the main dining area. Our waiter,  Jimmy,  told us we could we still order happy hour items. So, I got a mini portabello mushroom pizza, chicken won tons, and Thai lettuce wraps. The pizza was really yummy. It was drizzled with balsamic vinegar and the bread was soft and buttery. The won tons were OK. The meat inside was kind of mushy. The lettuce wraps were tangy and refreshing.  My son got the lunch portion of chicken tenders and fries even though lunch was over (thanks Jimmy!). He ate it all so he was satisfied.  Baby girl got the kids hamburger sliders which looked pretty good and I would've ate myself. Our meal came up to $30 which pretty good. The restaurant itself is very clean and staff is nice."
