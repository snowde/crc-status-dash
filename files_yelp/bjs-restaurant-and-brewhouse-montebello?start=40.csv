Luis A.,"Santa Ana, CA",70,9,23,1.0,9/21/2017,"Been coming to BJ's for a long time now. Must say, today I have experienced the worst customer service. Guess I'll need to switch to a different location.  Called in my order and the person taking my order kept charging me the wrong price several times. I asked for a few extra garlic knotts and they were trying to charge me extra. They had always given me a few complimentary. They said the rule was ""if it's 4 or more, we charge."" I then said, I only asked for 3 extra, but they continued to insist in wanting to sell them to me. I don't mind paying, but be consistent with what you say. They offered to bring a manager to speak to me, and took forever to come out.  I guess the service is reflected equally from the top to the bottom."
Enrique C.,"South El Monte, CA",1,2,,3.0,5/16/2017,"Nice place, ok food. I wonder why it takes forever to get drinks from the bar, is it a tactic or something they're not telling us? I could easily have 3 drinks wherever place I go for dinner expect here.  Takes forever! Forever! Lol"
Tom H.,"Rosemead, CA",63,21,,1.0,12/13/2017,Ulf Adamson. I never heard from the Montebello BJ's. I didn't really expect much. I've dealt with Ryan before and nothing ever came from that discussion. The Montebello BJ's needs a lot of changes. Puente Hills is about 9 miles further away but it's run so much better. The managers and staff should spend some time there and learn how a restaurant should be run.
Mandee F.,"Raynham, MA",142,51,2,4.0,5/5/2017,"4 stars for a great menu and lots of options! Our first visit here, we had Daniel as our server and he was excellent! Despite how busy he was with tables, he was quick to act on every request and checked in on us frequently. He even put us at a larger booth without us even asking which was amazing. Highly recommend! The 2nd time (2 days later) I believe we had Cheyenne according to our receipt. She didn't introduce herself, nor was she anywhere near as receptive or alert to our table. We had 2 different items that came out either with something we asked to remove (no lemon in waters, both came with lemon) or with items we asked for extras of (additional garlic knots). When she brought items to us, she dropped and walked away so quickly we couldn't even get a word in. It ended up prolonging the visit longer than we wanted because she was always moving too fast for us to ask anything.  Definitely ask for Daniel if you go. Great server!! Would've been a 5 star experience had it not been for our disappointing experience this evening."
Leslie E.,"Long Beach, CA",720,298,468,4.0,3/14/2017,"I had the deep dish pizza.  It was great.   The waiter was very nice and kept giving us attention even know he was busy.  The main problem was.  It was very loud. There was a lot of background noise.  They need to put some type of noise dampener if the place.  My wife had the calamari.  She asked for a box to take the leftovers home.  The waitress was fast. But, not as fast as my wife. To say the least no we did not need a leftover box.  There is a big discrepancy of BJ restaurants. The quality out of the kitchen is not consistent. The location is consistently excellent.  I recommend this location."
Lidia B.,"Baldwin Park, CA",20,32,,5.0,9/1/2017,Stopped by for a couple of mimosas after some shopping and met Gabby who was attending the bar at the time. She was so nice and cheerful. Insisted on cleaning the area I sat down at even though I didn't mind. We started chatting in between her helping the other patrons and found out that she was another I Love Lucy fan as me. She was as sweet as can be. Will definitely come back to pay her a visit.
Lizette Z.,"Montebello, CA",0,3,,1.0,12/7/2017,Our server was great. Food is alright. Costumer service was horrible with the other workers.
Katie N.,"Los Angeles, CA",47,94,95,4.0,9/24/2017,I had an awesome time in BJ's last night. The rib eye steak was cooked well. The steak was nicely done and moist unlike other steak places. I have been to many Good steak places so far and this is one of my favorite. Customer Service wasn't bad. It's Saturday so it's gonna be crowded. I was okay with the customer service. Don't forget to order Honey Glazed Chipotle Salmon. It's really good. The only thing i didn't like was honey saracha brussel sprouts.
Ejler B.,"Brea, CA",7,19,2,1.0,8/27/2017,"Absolute worst service. Been here for three hours. Ordered a pozo olor about an hour ago. Manger is involved, took a good 10 minutes for him to even come over. Staff is super rude, had to ask several times for silverware and sugar for my coffee. Took them forever to bring it out. Still waiting for the pizookie..... when we asked for the manager the staff member was super rude about it."
Oscar M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,12,4,5.0,10/9/2017,"Came into this place a couple days ago craving some pasta. I have never been to BJ's before so I was amused by the nice big menu they have. They also do sell a bunch of alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages. The small garlic bread that comes with your pasta is so delicious, I wish they came in two on your plate. Pasta was also very tasty and with a hint more of parmesan cheese making it even tastier! Great place to come and watch a game also. Lots of TVs and a huge projected one on the bar side area. Hope to come back soon and try some steak!"
S K.,"Alhambra, CA",0,24,37,1.0,12/4/2016,"Not a good experience. I had my first experience here on a Sunday night. A party of 2. We arrived at 7:11, got seated around 8. We were still waiting for our dessert to come when we were asked to pay at 9:30 (which we did). Everything was so slow. Our sides came first, even before our utensils. Then our food, which was over cooked and super salty. When they replaced our steak, they failed to bring me back the side that it came with and the knife to cut the steak. So much butter on everything. The pizza was good. We asked for a refill on our drinks on several occasions, but never got refilled. Not happy and will not be coming back."
Christina G.,"South Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",15,6,,1.0,10/7/2017,"Of course BJ's is great... However there is one server who my husband and I happened to get twice, and she gave horrible service both times. Her name is Raquel and she doesn't come back often enough to check on drinks, forgot condiments we asked for and even some initial items we ordered. Crazy enough a third time we happened to get her and we had to walk out and go to another BJ's. We love Bj's but we might have to go to another location further from us just because by our luck we always get seated in her section."
Daddy E.,"Newberry Springs, CA",0,4,,3.0,6/1/2017,"I enjoy coming to this BJ's in Montebello. It's relatively close to home. The service is great and the food is delicious. There is just a huge issue that I have. I typically visit for big sporting events, to hang out with friends, watch the game and enjoy a nice cold BJ's brewed Oasis Amber. The problem is that their tv's are so out dated, viewing the game is difficult when their main screen keeps flickering at the top. Their picture quality isn't up to par and their tv's all around are just as bad. (Sad face) If it weren't for the tv's, I'd definitely rate this place a 5 star."
Shelby R.,"Pasadena, CA",79,7,15,1.0,7/16/2017,"If I could leave no stars, I would. Not only are their servers incompetent, their customer service is subpar at best. It took us one hour to receive our food once ordered, and when we did receive it, my father pulled a 6"" hair out of his BJ's Brewhouse Burger. When we asked to speak with the manager, he proceeded to try and make a joke, and laughing matter out of the situation despite our disgust. They made no attempts to redeem themselves, and the manager wasn't helpful or attentive in the least bit. We've lived in Montebello for over thirty years, and will be sure to never return to this location, and will ensure that our friends and family are aware of what has happened, and how we were treated."
Denise G.,"Long Beach, CA",0,32,74,5.0,3/31/2017,"I recently visited for lunch and I must say it was delicious! The lunch options are great sizes and then if you have the mobile app everything is just made 100% simpler as you can use your coupons/specials and pay your bill all at your own convenient time. We got the bison burger, the mini pizookie, soup and salad combo, and the fried chicken. All these were the lunch portions but beyond perfect sizes. We were seated promptly and given great  service. We will definitely be back for lunch. Be sure to keep an eye on your rewards, the happy hour specials, any online coupons, and any weekday specials as you can combine all of them at the same time to walk out with a bargain!"
Evelyn E.,"Alhambra, CA",0,2,1,1.0,1/22/2017,"Manager, greeter, waiter and runner were great! However, we found a penis shape sketched into our kids food! Not cool!"
Sergio G.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,76,,1.0,11/17/2017,"Beware this BJ's has the RUDEST and clueless bartenders. I've been to quite a few BJ's locations and the Montebello facility employs by far the most unfriendly team of bartenders. I can't quite figure out why the bartenders have such a shitty attitude. Not sure if they have a crisis in their personal lives or if they're just plain idiots that need to be re-trained pronto in the area of customer service. Whatever the case may be these individuals are too complacent in their role at work. Obviously their IQ level is rather low that they can't quite comprehend that patrons are the ones who pay their salaries and patrons are the reason why their sorry ass isn't at the unemployment line.  I strongly recommend to BJ's management to dissolve the current bartending team and hire a crew that is professional, attentive and appreciates the business from paying patrons!  The more some things change, the more they stay the same..."
gArrett T.,"Glendora, CA",26,39,42,1.0,7/16/2017,My father in law just choked on a long hair that was inside his burger. We were so grossed out we got up left. Do not eat here.
Genevieve G.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,65,38,3.0,2/19/2017,It's a great place to eat if you go when they open.  If you go after 5 pm it's busy and you will get wonderful service from Valerie- or Maria - but if u sit towards the back where restrooms are the service tends to not be so great .  Try to be seated  next to entrance I notice those tables get served faster and better. If the woman manager is on duty service is probably going to be good .  The food is delicious order over phone if u don't want to wait to be seated and served . Lunch portions are big and inexpensive.  Drinks are good  .  It's just ok service if it's after 6 pm - depends who takes care of u . Val is the best server !!! Ask for her or Maria if u go in morning ! So mornings on the weekends are great
Kit C.,"Pasadena, CA",12,11,,2.0,8/7/2017,I should have left when they told me I have to wait 40-50 mins. I have been many other BJ location. This is the worst I can ever experienced. We have a large party and the server is not attentive at all. I understand it was busy. But she never come and check on us after we ordered our food and like other people mention here the food come in odd order we got one entree and the rest of the 8 people's just have to stare at one dish? When I told our server they forgot to put avacado on my taco which I know it's a add on. She gave me attitude and I was shocked. I love their deep dish pizza but I guess from now on I just have to go to different location :(
