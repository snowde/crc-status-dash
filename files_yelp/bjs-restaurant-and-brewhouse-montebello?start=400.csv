Libby R.,"Los Angeles, CA",1818,630,671,3.0,1/21/2010,"There is truly only one reason to know about BJ's and that is the Pizookie.  Period. But I am forced as is my Yelpy duty to actually write a review so I will. The food is decent, the drinks are good and the service is about as quick as a tortoise walking through molasses.   But the co-workers consider this the go to spot for Happy Hour on Fridays, so I will partake....but only if I get to order the Pizookie ;)"
Bethany E.,"Simi Valley, CA",102,59,23,2.0,10/17/2015,"Went out to lunch with my old roommates and we picked this place. We were sitted very quickly. Unfortunately there menus still had the old ones and didn't have the updated ones, so 2 of us had the right menu and the other was not updated. We ordered drinks and appetizer. I had a strawberry splash really good and my friend had a very overly strong long island. We had calamari it was pretty good, not amazing, but it was good. The side sauces the Marinara was delecious and the white sauce tasted just like tarter sauce not the sauce it was suppose to say. We ordered 2 pizzas one all meat lover and the chicken bacon ranch. The crust was to soft and kinda doughy. The house salad was very good thou. The service was alright, kinda lacked luster. The staff seemed to be all over and it really wasn't that busy. 3 people were just hanging out talking and chat and 3 people where just chatting away in the bathroom too. The restrooms were veru gross. Stalls were missing seat covers and toilet paper in 2 stalls for ladiesroom and 2 restrooms stalls were very dirty. Instead of chatting the staff members in there could off cleaned, instead of talking about universal and how the Halloween horror nights sucked and they're to expensive. To see employees just messing around and it seem to take a bit just to get a water refill and get some chips. Not happy with service and the food was not great at all, just the salad. I will not be going to this BJ again."
Sandy F.,"San Fernando, CA",0,17,3,5.0,8/8/2014,"So I had dinner w/ mom & sister on this Friday afternoon. We checked in and it took around 5min to be seated. Great!!! The waitress was nice took our drink order so when she came back we were  ready to order. Keep in mind we were starving & wanted to order right away. No time for chit-chat, lol!  For the appetizer we got the artichoke dip, entrées were as follows : grilled chicken pasta (didn't disappoint) turkey club (good) & herb thyme chicken w/veggies (my mom loved it)  We waited about 25-30min and still no appetizer, I was beginning to wonder.!! Then here comes our entrées. I asked the waiter about the artichoke dip and he stated it was still being delayed  because it was made fresh. My thought was.... by getting the appetizer with the entrées defeats the purpose of ordering the appetizer. Specially if we were starving.!! Then comes the manager who was the nicest person and apologized for the mix up and offered to comp the appetizer and  threw in a free pizookie!!!  Bottom line,.. I understand mix-ups happen in a busy restaurant & it's up to the managers to keep the customers satisfied. I was very pleased with him because he went above & beyond to fix the problem. I would differently come back and give them another try!!!!   Great customer service on his behalf."
W. N.,"Orange County, CA",34,283,4,4.0,6/15/2012,"I am never disappointed with BJ's. What I like about BJ's?  No matter where I go...Huntington Beach, Monterey Park or Stockton California, I know I will ALWAYS get a great pizza, very good beer and a big screen TV to watch hockey.  And unlike the over priced burger joint Islands, the server can hook you up with the sport you wanna watch on the TV you wanna watch it on."
Jennifer U.,"Los Angeles, CA",56,19,3,4.0,1/4/2015,Atmosphere is great . Pizza is awsome  . Service is great. Parking is a little challenge because is with the mall parking. But overall is not that bad. Great beer.
Linda C.,"Diamond Bar, CA",8,43,37,1.0,8/22/2015,"WOW!!! Not a good experience. Came in on a Wednesday, before 11:30. 1st no no...they asked how many and I said four and hostess reply was, can you wait?  Wait, what? Your restaurant is empty and your servers are standing around talking. Please tell me what I am waiting for, on my limited lunch hour. Or say, it will just be a moment. We sit down and server comes over, we order water and I let her know we have two birthdays and request pizookies, which she writes down. We finally order and two of our party ordered the same burger. At the time if ordering we ask our server to make sure the fries are hot as they always come out cold. 2nd no no...food comes out with cold fries on all plates, wedge and skinny and the two identical burgers, made differently...can you say quality control? When she finally comes to check on us, we let her know about both she brings out one order of hit wedge fries for four people and asks if we want a plate of lettuce...really??? Over an hour later when I flag her down for the check her comment is....no no 3....I haven't placed the order for the pizookies. Really...in over an hour??? I get check, go up to the hostess and ask to speak to the manager...I'm already late for work, so whatever. Guess what the hostess says...yes, no no one, can you wait. Manager, you need training...this meal should have been on the house. He asked what her could do for me and I replied...you don't expect me to pay for this do you??? In the end, he gave 50 percent off. Not going back. Food just adequate and service subpar!!!!!!"
Tina-Marie L.,"La Mirada, CA",592,586,357,4.0,1/26/2010,"I come to this BJ's all of the time because it's close to work and close to my mom's house. Sometimes the service is great. Other times you feel like you're on your own.  My favorite dish is the Angel Hair Toscana with Chicken. It's obviously angel hair pasta. They toss in olive oil, garlic, sun-dried tomatoes, fire-roasted red peppers, fresh basil, feta cheese, pine nuts, Roma tomatoes and top it with fresh Parmesan cheese and parsley. You also get some garlic bread too.  Another thing that's tasty is their Fresh Basil and Sausage pizza. It's a flatbread pizza with mozzarella, Fontina and Parmesan cheeses. They add fresh basil, Roma tomatoes and Italian sausage.  I went with friends recently and someone ordered the Potato Chip appetizer.   They were awesome! And that means a lot because I don't even like potato chips. For dessert, you can never go wrong with a pizookie. I hear they have individual ones now. My fave is the white chocolate macademia nut. While I like this BJ's, I also plan accordingly. If I need to be somewhere in an hour or hour and a half, I'm probably not going to put this on my list because of their incosistent service."
Sim G.,"Whittier, CA",300,96,79,4.0,6/27/2012,Tatonka Stouts and Pm Porters for days!! yaaaayy. they have a reasonable happy hour. I love this chain just because they make their own beers which range from hefs to deliciously tasty stouts. The food is great no matter what you order!. The staff always seems to be on their toes and very polite. They have big screen tvs to watch all the sports.. yaaa!
Fred P.,"El Monte, CA",23,29,64,2.0,7/27/2012,"this is the second time that I have come early in the day (4pm). we came to beat the crowd and enjoy ourselves. Ha! It was not crowded and we sat at the bar, It took about 22 min to get a brew. We were given menus and waited about another 20 min to order. After finishing the first round, nobody came by to check on us.  Service is Terrible-Terrible-Terrible, our order was incorrect and the server was a girl-with low communication skills as she could not explain anything. We were quite lucky to have a 2nd brew and left immediately.  Oh yeah, my friend's pizza was already cold and so were the calamari-it was like the diet calamari order-tiny. I will choose not to return- this place sucks- save your time and money"
Kien H.,"Alhambra, CA",26,23,5,2.0,1/23/2012,"Whatever. Came here with friends for dinner. We were served by this bitch ass waitress with enough attitude to power a whole city. Our asses were barely settled into the chairs before she came back and demanded that we be ready to order. NO. So she huffed and puffed away. My friend got take-out for her boyfriend and requested that it's prepared at the end, but we got that order before any of our food even came out. The waitress barely came by to check up on our table throughout the meal, and we didn't get a single refill on water until we asked a different waiter for it. Then she forgot to give my friend the birthday dessert thing people get here. When we got the take-out order at the end, she gave it to my friend without a bag. REALLY? I hope this silly bitch enjoyed her tip. Can't believe I actually had my birthday here a few years ago. Would not have wanted her to serve 20 people, since she's barely able to handle 3. The food was good, though. I loved my seared ahi salad. Yum. Bad service at this place is apparently no surprise based on previous reviews. Get your shit together. That's all."
Maggie K.,"Los Angeles, CA",749,413,35,2.0,9/17/2012,"I have an aversion toward BJ's. It's awful food, overpriced drinks, but the layout is nice and it's one of the only decent places in Montebello. But, I will not forget THE PIZOOKIES! Sweet baby Jesus, it is God's given gift to mankind! Such a great indulgence! For sure to cure any heart ache or break up!"
C W.,"Chino, CA",12,178,14,3.0,8/6/2014,WTf is up with the quality of the pizza? It isn't the same as it used to be!  I come here only for the wings and the pizzokies. I'd rather go elsewhere for some good pizza.
Maria V.,"Los Angeles, CA",60,23,8,4.0,7/3/2012,"I go here often on dates with the boyfriend and outings with friends.  Love the environment and pizza.  I've never had a issue with service. I won't have their other food because I don't like it.  The pizza is the only thing that's really good here. (Okay, I like their avocado rolls, too!) Their sampler is the best, but I usually just stick to their House Heff or their Blonde...  What can I say?  I'm a lightweight :)."
Kyle G.,"Huntington Beach, CA",10,13,1,5.0,7/16/2014,This BJ'S is really clean and employees are on top of everything. You can never go wrong with there happy hour! The food is always made fresh and delicious 5 stars for me.
B M.,"Los Angeles, CA",67,108,,4.0,6/21/2012,"I seriously can't understand all the bad reviews. Everytime i come here the service is great, and the food is good. Yes this location is always packed for dinner, and there is usually a 30 minute wait. For the most part I always order the pizza. Specifically the Portobello mushroom. I love me some mushrooms! Balsamic vinaigrette, marinated oven roasted mushrooms, caramelized onions, fresh thyme, parsley, Fontina cheese and balsamic glaze. Amazing! I always request to add some jalapenos on it, to give it a little kick. The pastas and burgers are never a let down either.  Pretty good beer selection. Options from German Kolsch, to Russian stout. But I always stick to my Stella. Big screen TV's at every angle so you never miss a milisecond of any game. If you are impatient, then you might want to go to different location. The fact that this BJ's is at a mall, is the reason it is always jam packed, thus the waiter's will be a tad bit slower. If not, Im sure you'll enjoy it here, just as I always do."
Loretta C.,"Los Angeles, CA",3524,954,21679,4.0,10/16/2010,"This is a nice sit-down place for both couples and families, and located within the Towne Center Mall They had lots of TV screens throughout the restaurant, with a main screen at the bar showing what's on the other 8 TV screens, all showing football games heh. The service is great and the waiters constantly checked in on us. We ordered mozzarella sticks and two small pizzas; the Great White and the Southwestern. They took a while to make the pizzas but when they came out, both were amazing and cheesy!"
Wilson H.,"Los Angeles, CA",98,17,,1.0,3/30/2014,"Let's keep this short & sweet.  Waiter messed up order for my gf.  The amount of fries on my plate was minimal.  When I made a comment, he said ""that's the way it comes.""  Funny thing is my son ordered a burger & his fries were normal.  So I did what I could.  No tip.  BJ montebello is no bueno in my book.  Here's a tip buddy, don't brush off your customers when they make a comment about the food/service."
Heather H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,39,2,5.0,7/19/2014,Love this place! It's a bit pricey for montebello but the happy hour is awesome :) the staff is really friendly too!
Karina M.,"Bakersfield, CA",1,16,8,4.0,8/8/2014,Luv! The food is delicious. The chicken pasta with broccoli & the Alfredo always my go to dishes. Pasta perfectly cooked. Same with the chicken. Sometimes i do ask for extra sauce on the pasta with broccoli bcuz in some occasions it does come a little dry but not a big problem just ask for extra sauce. Individual pizza is good. Husband always gets the California chicken sandwich. Yum so good! The wait can be a little too much but i don't complain.
