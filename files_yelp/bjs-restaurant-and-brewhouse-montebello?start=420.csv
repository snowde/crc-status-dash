Ji T.,"West Covina, CA",259,797,101,4.0,6/25/2014,"opens till late, friendly service, its not a place im yearning to go back to but still decent enough for me to consider as an option for late night if i'm in the area i got the prime rib, pretty decent cut for the price, but then again, it could be a lot more expensive and i know it i tried their pizookie.....ice cream on a huge cookie basically....interesting if you love that kind of stuff, i'm not a huge fan....i'll just take ONE PIECE.... they have their own in house beer selection on tap with many HH options i would definitely consider trying one of their pastas next time though"
Annette M.,"Santa Fe Springs, CA",0,38,11,3.0,7/12/2015,I love BJ'S food but service today was so bad I don't think I'll be coming back to Montebello location for a while.  We ordered calamari and it seems the portions for alot smaller and for the same price.  I wasn't to pleased today.
Cameron P.,"Highland, CA",51,51,2,3.0,4/24/2012,They tried seating me by the front door in a huge booth for families when it was just two people. So I'll take off a star. The bartenders were nice though. I love their buffalo pizza and avacado deep fried egg roles...yum!
Jorge C.,"Pico Rivera, CA",16,16,2,3.0,7/23/2014,I dont know what was worst the bad attitude from the hostess..(not a single welcome or smile).or being left alone for 25 minutes with no server.....we ordered a pizza no plates on my table...I saw the server with my food waiting for the thing that is used to hold the pizza....no refills....but when jessica took over....we had a different experience. ...she was awesome. ...made us forget the bad service...a big shout out for u jessica...
Jenay M.,"Alhambra, CA",39,26,3,2.0,7/12/2012,"Typical ""American"" style food. Much like Applebee's, Denny's, and any other restaurant chain.  But this particular BJ's has a very RUDE staff. I have been here at least 3 times, and the staff here always seem so rushed and give you that ""GET YOU IN, GET YOU OUT"" feeling.  The BJ's in West Covina is much more mellow for some reason. Much better vibe, nicer staff, and you dont have to seek out your waiter to help you with anything because they are usually visible when you need something.  I'm done with the bastard staff at Montebello."
Frank R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,8,,1.0,9/10/2015,"I honestly do not write reviews on yelp but I just felt I had to comment on poor customer service. I ordered two items, a sandwich and a pizza. An hour to get my food but it was busy no biggie. My pizza arrives first and the server tells me we put the wrong toppings on your pizza but keep this one while we bring yours out. Then comes my sandwich, I ordered it with out garlic aioli mayo. I'm not one to complain though I just politely asked if I can get one without it. From that point on the servers attitude changed. They brought my pizza out and it was still wrong I ordered it with roasted red peppers and they literally just sprinkled regular green bell peppers on top. I didn't care though. What was the real issue and most upsetting was that after I requested the bill, my sever tried to come and give us a lecture on what an aioli is and that it's not mayo. I am in the restaurant business myself, I know what an aioli is but I'm going on how it's Written ON THE MENU there's no need to try to lecture my table, and she literally says well now you know. I'm receiving attitude for the restaurants mistake when I did not even complain. Upsetting never coming here again."
Courtney J.,"Walnut, CA",7,301,693,1.0,11/2/2011,"Nice beer selection... Too bad, bartender name Brittany is lousy in her job!! All she cares are fast order, fast re-order, fast ""Here is your Bill"". The worse bartender ever."
Maria A.,"Washington, DC",404,287,7,3.0,12/28/2011,"The ONLY place to hang out in Montebello after hours. Be prepared to see your elementary school enemy, your middle school crush,  and your high school nemesis at this location if you lived around Montebello. So awkward. Anyway... service ranges from absolutely excellent (there is this one guy some nights that is just SO happy to serve you, and SO excited about the menu and you and life.) And there's this one girl at night who might as well be throwing your plates to you from a distance as she stares you down. Food is good, thankfully. I'm very rarely disappointed by a meal I order. Pizza is nice and carby, appetizers are nice and greasy, just what I'm looking for usually. The star of the night is always the pizzookie.  I am ashamed to admit I visit this BJs WAY more than anyone should. But that's what you gotta do when you live in Montebello. -___-"
Christopher A.,"Montebello, CA",43,10,3,5.0,4/2/2014,"Happy hour specials are pretty bomb. Can't go wrong with any of their flatbread pizzas and I've never tried a brew I didn't like their. Also, they have a very friendly staff of waiters. Usually not too crowded except on game days"
Elisa D.,"Pico Rivera, CA",3,17,8,2.0,7/7/2014,"Decent. The whole experience was just weird.  Had to ask for silverware. Strawberry lemonade was nasty. The pasta and pizza were ehh, mediocre.  The only thing I loved were the mozzarella sticks."
Erika R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,25,5,5.0,3/30/2014,"I've avoided BJ's since the last experience was not very good (about a year ago, the waiter kept forgetting about us), but decided that a year might be enough for change, and boy was I right. The service was great! We had a very nice waitress (Raquel I believe was her name). I tried one of their new salads as an appetizer (arugula and bean), and it was very refreshing. I also tried the chipotle-cherry glazed salmon and have found my new favorite dish, it was very delicious!! Their alcoholic beverage selection is great. I opted for the pear cider; small alcohol content, without the strong beer or sweet fruity drink taste."
Kaylin O.,"Los Angeles, CA",219,887,306,4.0,11/13/2009,"It was packed for a Thursday night.  We decided to try some of their new items on the menu: bbq pulled pork sliders, bbq chicken sliders, fried calamari, caesar salad with cajun shrimps, and the pizookie trio. I really like the bbq pulled sliders and the coleslaw that accompanies it.  The bbq chicken sliders were good too.  I didn't get to try the fried calamari.  After having caesar salad at morton's, parkway grill, and other fine restaurants, this salad was horrible.  Too salty and the cajun shrimp makes it even worse.  Pizookie trio was good but I'd rather stick to my favorite white chocolate macadamia one. Service was good."
Amy R.,"East Los Angeles, CA",6,60,10,5.0,5/18/2014,Love it. Hubby and I always go for special occasions..we love the steak and fettuccine Alfredo with chicken yummy.. Love the flatbread margarita fresca... The strawberry lemonade is my favorite. Customer service is pretty good. Thanks guys.
Chi T.,"San Gabriel, CA",145,361,138,3.0,6/20/2012,"I've eaten here a few times, and the food is usually mediocre, at best. But this time, I was in for a treat!  I ordered their PM Porter beer and accompanied it with the bbq ribs per the menu suggestion. Well, the beer was surprising very good. It went down very smoothly and didn't have the strong alcohol taste.   The ribs were delicious! I had the half order, which was quite big. I had to take half of it home.  The meat was tender and fell right off the bone.  Now, I'm not sure who writes the beer and food pairing, but I don't think these two went well together.  The ribs were good and so was the beer, but when combined, the ribs cancel out the taste of the beer.  I felt like I was drinking water. The taste of the ribs was so strong that it made the beer bland.  So...the ribs were good as was the beer, but just not together.  Maybe you can down a few brewskies and then order the ribs."
Victor Q.,"Covina, CA",1,29,,2.0,4/27/2013,I normally have had great experiences at most Bjs restaurants.... but.... theres always one stragler..and Montebello Bjs is that straggler.  The servers have this attitude problem..and when i summoned the manager... the apple didnt fall too far from the tree. I can see where they get it from.  so i ended up calling corporate.   dont bother with this one... it just ruins your opinion of a good Brand .
Cesar D.,"Montebello, CA",26,47,19,3.0,10/21/2013,Busy spot on Sundays during NFL season. Not a bad place to catch a game if you can get a table or a seat at the bar.
Michelle C.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,11,2,1.0,1/23/2014,"Probably one of the worst dining experiences I've had in a while. Hostesses at the front didn't even bother to greet us when we entered inside. We asked for a booth, and the hostess seated other guests before us (even though we arrived before). Once seated, our server took nearly 20 minutes to finally take our order. To top it off, our food came out cold and nearly burnt. So unprofessional."
Amber B.,"La Mirada, CA",0,7,,1.0,6/25/2014,"I love coming here.  The atmosphere is great. The beers are tasty. The only thing that has made me upset, is the steak. I've tried ordering the steak about 3 the different times and every time,  the steak is cooked wrong. I ask for med-rare and it was practically raw.  I had them recook it to med-well and it was still too raw.  Today is my fourth time ordering steak. I asked for med-well.. they gave me (and im not exaggerating) the driest steak I've ever gotten from a restaurant. I love steak,  but I couldn't even eat this one. So if you decide to visit this restaurant (at least at this location) DO NOT ORDER STEAK.. you won't be pleased."
Perla G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,,1.0,5/2/2016,"Now, I've been here before and never had this problem but I was very disappointed this last time I was here. I came here during your dinner rush recently and didn't even stay 10 minutes because the hostess is by far one of the worst hostesses I've ever encountered. She barely looked at me while I stood there and seemed to be extremely upset and annoyed to be there but the second a coworker would come around she was all smiles. I don't understand why she'd be positioned to greet your guests with such a nasty attitude. All she said with a monotone was how many before she brushed us off and said gimme 10 minutes. Maybe you can find a position for her in the back of house. She was about 5'5 glasses, dark hair, dark brown skin when I asked for her name she rolled her eyes. No I'm not lying she rolled her god damn eyes like if I was asking to split a $10 check 17 different ways. She replied in a very annoyed tone and said her name was Marlene. Sweetheart, you get paid to be a hostess, do your job or quit. This is a business, a corporate company you work for...get it together or ask for a different position. The food isn't THAT good for us to be subjected to such horrible service."
AG G.,"Buena Park, CA",0,18,16,1.0,9/29/2014,"Live near the mall  my brother and I went in on a Saturday for dinner.  They sat us,  we got menus  waited 1/2 hour.  we decided to leave.   Never again will I return to this specific  location again."
