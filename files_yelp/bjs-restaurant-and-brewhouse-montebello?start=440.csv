Jair F.,"Huntington Park, CA",7,8,,5.0,7/14/2014,Great service. Great food. Clean environment. Really enjoyed my experience. We were seated right away and our server didn't hesitate to bring us water right away while we decided on drinks and gave us enough time to think about what we want to eat without being pushy. Didn't have to wait long for our food either. Very good service!
Evan R.,"La Puente, CA",9,20,13,3.0,5/14/2014,"This place is very average, the location isn't great either. I've been to better BJs restaurants. It seems like I was given a much smaller portion of food then I've received before. I don't go to BJs every weekend but I've been there enough to remember the normal size of the entree I get. The balsamic glazed chicken was a very small portion. It was a little disappointing because I was looking forward to my meal, and 8 bites later it was gone.. Maybe I'll have better luck at a different BJs. Our waitress was a Debbie-downer also, overall a very average night."
lester p.,"South El Monte, CA",452,142,127,4.0,5/31/2011,"This is one of the smaller BJ's I've been to. But the staff here is friendly and the hostesses were welcoming. I haven't had to wait long for a table ever last couple of times I've been here. The food here is cooked to perfection. I haven't had any complaints about my food. I happened to sit at the bar tonight. It was a sunday evening and it wasnt all that busy. Had a few drinks, watched some sports sports and munched on some appetizers., service was pompt and the spinach and artichoke dip was good."
Jeannette N.,"Montebello, CA",0,7,1,1.0,10/2/2014,If you want to be ignored? This is the place. Terrible service. The girl in the front with the computer whos one job is to write people down didnt write us down. When we saw people pass us she said someone else went in as us. Really? Maybe it was because she looked down at her list and didnt write us down. Were not going back.
Luna M.,"Los Angeles, CA",26,26,6,5.0,3/19/2014,My boyfriend and I come here very oftenly. We live less than 5 minutes away.  It is a nice place. It has big selection of everything ! We also do take outs too! It is a nice place to go and just sit around and eat or do take outs if you don't feel like cooking. :)
Wendy L.,"Rosemead, CA",87,30,24,3.0,1/6/2014,"The girl that was serving my friend and I was pretty nice, but still the service was just awful. My pizza took a really long time to come out, also it came out kinda warm, I'm guessing it was sitting there for a while before anyone had brought it to me. They didn't gave us any plates to feed ourselves either. My pizookie took 20 minutes to come out. The cookie was kinda warm too, it wasn't hot like it should be. Service sucks at night."
Karen Y.,"Montebello, CA",184,559,329,3.0,9/24/2011,This Bj's is small and located in the mall. Don't even think of going on a Friday or Saturday night cause it's at least an hour wait. Probably more. The food at this location is ok. The avocado eggrolls come with this way too sweet dip. I'd suggest light ranch instead. The new portobello pizza wasn't good at all surprisingly. They usually do good with their pizzas but this had no flavor and was dry.  The pizookies here are usually a little under done. I like my cookies a bit more cooked. You can get half and half flavors on your pizookie too.
Dv T.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,3,,1.0,12/10/2013,"The food is always good at bj's but the customer service is horrible !!!! Even the manager (a girl ) was super rude. We got there at 11 pm and they close at 12 , around 11:40 they turned on the lights & turned off the music & we fell like we were in the cafeteria . The server kept on rolling her eyes . Just bad service ."
Jenny C.,"Alhambra, CA",144,125,,3.0,1/1/2012,"before going any further, just so all of your guys know, a 3 star is NOT BAD. NOT BAD AT ALL. the overall experience was great. the service was good, slightly slow on bringing us the drinks, but still nice and helpful. the food was GOOD. at first i thought it was going to be one of those over priced, small portion, rude fancy restaurants, but their food was good and is a good portion for the price you pay.  friends ordered the spaghetti and a burger, both are delicious. i ordered a chicken a la fresca, which was decent, good for girls if you're into that health stuff. the chicken was a little too burnt for my taste.  the mood of the restaurant is good, the lights are dim but you can still see your food. there's a bar section if you are interested in watching the sports, but still very classy. i would go back again because all the food seem pretty good."
Ashita K.,"Glendora, CA",101,98,109,2.0,9/24/2013,"This review is about their customer service, not their food.  I'm giving them two stars only because of the food. Otherwise this review would have 0 stars.  We went to this BJ's a while ago when they had the 2 for 20 deal (that deal is back now). We were immediately seated so we were really happy to start off with. Who gets seated right away in a BJ's on the weekend, right? But we should have known better than to get all excited because we didn't have to wait.  After being seated, we had to wait a good 20 mins for our server. And we could see her going back and forth to the table right across us. She finally came and we gave her our order right away and told her we were going for the 2 for 20 deal. Then a good 30 mins passed before our soups showed up. Now here's the thing.....we barely put our spoons in the soups and this guy showed up with our pizza. I'm sorry, but I don't like eating cold pizza. I would like to have enough time to finish my soup. Anyway, we took a look at the pizza and saw the pineapple was missing. The server came along and we told her the pizza didn't have pineapple. She said she could bring it on the side! Who eats pineapple like that? A side of jalapeños, I understand, but pineapple?  We told her it was okay and that we don't need it on the side. We finished eating and then played the waiting game again. It took her 40 mins to show up at our table. Till then, the server helping the table next to us got our ranch, chilli peppers, and water. Our server showed up and we ordered our dessert. We got done with that and we waited again. After 20 mins, she came with our bill. How much was the bill? 46 dollars. This time I didn't even bother waiting for her. I just called the other server and told her we had ordered the 2 for 20 deal. She apologized and fixed our bill. Right then, our server showed up and I told the other server I would rather tip her than our server. And I did.  My boyfriend even sent BJ's an email. But they don't care!  Pathetic customer service. And it's only at this one that we always get bad servers. Go to West Covina. They have much better customer service there!"
Karla G.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",2,14,,2.0,10/14/2014,"Super disappointed with this BJ's. I have a BJ's closer to home but since this one is located in the mall, I like to bring my mom for lunch and do some shopping. Lunch hour is our favorite, I completely understand when it's a full house, people coming in on their lunch break but I'm not exactly sure if they were under staff but being a frequent customer I noticed a lot of new hires and not one person seemed to know how to balance themselves. The host in front was too busy talking about her personal life with her co worker, my mom handed her our BJ's member card and gave us a poker face and told us to hand it to the waiter. Our waitress was alright, not good not bad. They brought my moms soup and forgot about mine. Not once did they come to us asking if we were fine, seemed like not only our table but the ones around us needed to wave our hand just to get a waiters attention. It took a lot for us not to get up and leave, as we watched others do so. Finally our food arrived and it looked half assed. At this point I just want the check, unfortunately that took over 20mins to get. To only person who made eye contact was the bus boy. After we were handed the check, no one bothered to pick it up, we walked to the front and the girl sent us back to the table. I wanted to pay with my card but I got so impatient I used cash and left it on the table. The location itself is alright, I like the one better by my house but the service here really failed me today."
Priscilla R.,"Monterey Park, CA",0,3,,1.0,5/9/2015,"This used to be the place we could count on for a good burger, pizza and steak, but this last meal was horrible. My daughters steak was cooked super well done when I requested medium, my sandwich had a strong chemical taste on the grilled bread and the rest of the food we had was horrible.  I think the only thing we enjoyed were the skinny fries.  $100 worth of food down the drain. Definitely won't be coming back.  Pretty sad"
Gloria S.,"Los Angeles, CA",44,13,,5.0,4/11/2014,"I needed to go to the mall and had dinner first at BJ's Restaurant.  Our server, Gabriel, was awesome.  I am one of those that has to have everything right.  If it's iced tea, it has to come with a slice of lemon.    I ordered a salad and my friend had the fish and chips.  We also had the avocado rolls for appetizer and those were the best.  Our dinner was perfect.  Gabriel made sure we were happy and had all that we need for a nice dinner.   I usually get the Ahi tuna salad and it's always made just right.  I've been here alot and this place, although sometimes real busy, offers great customer service and good food.  I will be back soon."
Honest L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,7,,1.0,10/29/2013,"This place is the worst Restaurant I have been to in a while. The service is horrible, I waited 15 min just for the server to ask us what we wanted to drink, an extra 15 to  take our orders and 20 min to deliver a salad that was dry with rotting leaves. DISGUSTING!!!! When I made the server aware of the horrible salad she, with an attitude responded I'll get another one. Furious, I just left after more than an hr waiting on our food. This place needs to get shut down, how in the world are they still in business!"
Anthony U.,"Montebello, CA",162,165,41,3.0,2/21/2011,I went to BJ's with a friend just to get out for an hour or two and have a few drinks. Not only was it freezing outside but of course was packed with people inside. This is one reason more stars don't come their way. I don't even know why they put one here in Montebello to begin with but since it is they do I have to admit keep it clean and well maintained.......and there was no gas leak this time. The wait to be seated was not that long only a few minutes or so. We ordered our drinks and they also arrived promptly. I got the jaramiah red and my friend got a tequila sunrise. He wanted something to munch on with the drinks so I suggested the chicken potstickers and he sounded like he was game so he ordered them and he was pleasently surprised at how good they were. The waiter came back and we ordered another drink each. The waiter was cool and gave him his second sunrise in a huge glass compared to the first one he brought and I was wondering where my larger beer was...Oh well I wasn't paying so I didn't really care a free buzz is a free buzz.
Dr K.,"Rosemead, CA",180,663,248,3.0,5/6/2011,"Loud, so very loud. On a random note: Most of the servers look good but walking around I notice most people in here are pretty fat.  Probably cause the 700 cal salad is one of the lower calorie meals here."
Jay H.,"Phoenix, AZ",157,82,,5.0,3/11/2014,"Came Here a bit late around 10z happy hour starts after 10 on weekdays and closes at 12. Great selections, had the Stella and avocado slider snacks was amazing . Freely staff working here and accident all major cards. It is located inside the Montebello mall."
Roni R.,"Los Angeles, CA",159,369,,4.0,1/23/2012,"I love the bread they bring out.  I've been loving their light menu -- the tilapia is fabu as is the chicken with rice and salad.  SO GOOD.   Oh, I also love their lunch specials and you really can't go wrong w/a cup of clam chowder with sandwich and fries.  I mean -- you lose track of your calorie count but oh so good!!!  The service is hit and miss depending on the waiter so that would be my only minus.   OH, and thei light beer is horrible!  Really bad.  Don't order it.  It was my fault for ordering light beer to begin with ... I'm just a hopeful romantic when it comes to beer, though."
Leslie P.,"Whittier, CA",0,5,,2.0,10/15/2015,"TOOK US FOREVER TO GET A TABLE HERE. Me and my friends came last week to celebrate my friends birthday. They told us 20 mins. At 30 MINUTES I go up and ask the women how much longer it would take, she was kind rude and just looked up and told me ""you're number 13 on the list of 45 people"" ummm really?? Thanks for the help lady. At 45 MINUTES, servers came up to us and gave us a slice a pizza. Then finally at 55 MINUTES! They gave us a table. Our waitress was nice, but she had to leave and we were left with some guy. HE WAS SO RUDE!! On my menu it that my meal came with 2 pieces of chicken. I'm not complaining or anything but if it say 2 then why did I only get 1. I mean I am paying for 2 right?  I asked the waiter and he so smart with me and told me if I wanted to I can pay extra? And he gave me an a face when I asked him if the lunch special prices were the same at dinner time. The only reason why it's not a 1 start review is because they did give my friend a free small desert because it was her birthday."
Linda T.,"Monterey Park, CA",0,28,11,3.0,3/4/2014,"Service is rather slow.. Waited about 20 Mins to be seated when restaurant looks empty... Whatever.. We did the wait. We ordered a pizza that's supposedly Chicago style but it's definetly  not! It's more like Pizza Hut pan pizza. Chicago pizza is usually dense and full of toppings. The pizza served is airy and light on the toppings. We ordered a large pizza, Pizzokie, glass of beer, and kids chicken tender meal. $55.00 including tip. Better off ordering piZZA Hut."
