Marco G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,1.0,11/17/2014,Never in my life have I waited so long to the point where I decide to leave. I guess there's always a first time for everything. Got sat pretty quick but not one server seemed to acknowledge us even as they passed right by our table.
Mimi B.,"Valencia, CA",0,3,1,1.0,4/1/2016,"Went here on Wedsday for dinner because were staying at the Hotel across the street.  Hostess said 15 min, we were seated in 5. Hence, the 1 star.  Server came up to take a drink order. 2 sodas and a kids milk.  He disappeared for a long time and finally came back to take our order.  He brought the sodas and a GIANT cup instead of a kids cup, which is a bummer since my kiddo couldn't even hold the cup by herself.  We ordered the santa fe roll appetizer, shrimp & asparagus pasta, and the triple decker sandwich.  Plus, a kids mac & cheese & potato wedges.  He didn't come back to refill sodas at all.  NO appetizer came out, but the food did.  So we mention to him we're missing an appetizer.  He didn't seem to concerned, and said he'd go check on it. A few minutes later ANOTHER server ended up bring it out after we started eating our entrees, with no apology or anything. Our server never apologized for the mess up either.  As far as the food, the Eggrolls were bland and tiny, the pasta sauce tasted like something poured from a can, and the sandwich was very plain.  I didn't bother to taste my kids mac & cheese but I can tell you the potato wedges were also quite flavorless.  When we asked for the check he brought it, then disappeared for a long time before coming back to take payment.  We literally waited for him to bring our card back while he was at the table behind us flirting with a group of young girls for a minimum of 5 minutes.  All in all, the service was atrocious, the food sucked, and I would never come back. Dear Management: DO NOT HIRE KIDS WHO DONT CARE ABOUT YOUR PATRONS.  Had the service been better, I would have overlooked the food sucking and rated this place better.  I'll stick to the BJs by my house which actually seasons their food, and has nicer servers who are smart enough to bring a toddler a childs cup and bring out an appetizer BEFORE the entrees."
Diana L.,"Pasadena, CA",48,148,69,4.0,2/8/2012,"I had the Enlightened Barbacoa Chicken Tacos.  It was full of flavor and only for $5.95!  Their service is really sloooooooooooow, especially during lunch hour even when there wasn't a lot of people!  Minus 1 star."
Esme N.,"Los Angeles, CA",29,4,3,2.0,6/16/2014,The service was not good at all. Our waitress had a very dry attitude which made my group and I feel very uncomfortable. They brought our food out and after that she was no where to be seen for over an hour. It frustrated us so much that the manager came out to take our order. If she went to take her lunch or take a break she should have at least had another waiter to help.Then when she came back out to help she seemed bothered that she had to come back to help us. We weren't rude to her so we did not understand why her attitude was so sour. The food was okay. The AC was a little to high for our liking. Overall not the best dining experience. Maybe its just this location or just the BJS restaurant.
Jenny P.,"Alhambra, CA",7,105,5,3.0,2/21/2014,"This BJ's gets very packed as you would imagine being attached to a mall, but if you don't mind a little wait for both a table and then food, it's what you'd expect for a normal BJ's restaurant. We go here because the selection of different foods is very broad."
Jonny R.,"Monterey Park, CA",36,132,,1.0,2/9/2015,"if you're into slooowww dining, and hostesses that act like you're bothering them when you check in, then this is the place for you...not a fan because an average dinner for 3 of us went over 2 hours...that's including the debacle that was my daughters steak which had to be sent back for sitting too long in the broiler...bar scene looked fun"
Rony B.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,83,25,5.0,2/13/2011,Start with a Brewhouse Blonde followed  by a Jeremiah Red and then Fish n chips... It hits the spot! Avocado rolls are the best appetizers!
Joss A.,"Pico Rivera, CA",219,6,4,4.0,12/31/2012,First time in this BJ's and I have to tell you.  It was a great experience. Service was great and fast !!!!
Amanda M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,33,,5.0,9/23/2013,"I usually come to this BJ's on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon. There's never too long of a wait time and plenty of seating at the bar, unless of course there is a popular game on.  There's not one thing I don't like on the menu. It's very extensive but the food always tastes great. Usually a manger will walk by and make sure everything is running smoothly. There have been a few times they either forgot a dish or some other mistake happens on a busy day but I'm not really one to complain or make a scene. They're very nice and apologetic. You may even get a freebie or two! The main reason why I'm writing this review is for JAMES! He's always there when my boyfriend and I visit on weekends. We always try to sit in his section because he has the best attitude I've ever seen in a waiter! There's not a day where this guy seems like he's having a tough day and is upset. He's very attentive especially on busy days, not to mention hilarious! I always leave notes on our receipt hoping he'll read it because we really do appreciate  his great service. There need to be more people like James in this world!"
Aldo R.,"El Monte, CA",127,41,7,3.0,12/8/2011,"Like any other BJ's, pretty good bar and food. The only down side is the pasta, every time that I have being there the Fetuccinni Alfredo has been horrible, always under cooked, not aldente, just under cooked, stay away from it."
Joel T.,"Los Angeles, CA",124,55,40,5.0,1/20/2014,"Food and Service is always good here. Usually best time to go is during happy hour. I woudl reccomend the Mini meatball pizza, wings are off the chain good, sliders are excellent and avocado egg rolls. Could also live off the Bj's Heff and the strawberry donut desert."
Dana T.,"Daly City, CA",721,16,,2.0,1/23/2012,"I've been to a lot of BJ's and have always been treated with great service, but this restaurant came up short in the service department. It was not a great experience. The hostess wasn't very professional. It seemed like she was new and didn't know what to say, nor give a very good seating selection when there were clearly many other open tables that were much better than the corner we got. It felt like she seated us for the convenience of the waitress, who was also waiting on the three tables directly next to us. The waitress took way too long to get us water while we needed to buy time to figure out what to eat. It felt like a 5-10 minute wait for her to come back with our drinks and take our order. She didn't even serve us our food, instead a food server came out with our dishes. The food was pretty good, though. I noticed most of the workers were busy with their own side conversations and seemed like they didn't really enjoy working there. I like going to BJ's for the great dining experience and atmosphere, especially considering the $$ price tag you pay for most of the food. Maybe I was spoiled by other BJ's with their great customer service (Chino Hills and Irvine), but this BJ's is definitely the runt of the litter."
Daniel B.,"Whittier, CA",2,7,1,4.0,4/6/2015,"We visited on Sat 4/4/15.  By far it was the best service we have received from anyone anywhere in a long time.  Our server was Crystal and she was on top of it.  She took our drink order, had the presence of mind to ask if we wanted her to bring out the kids food when ready ahead of our food, she kept our drinks refilled and checked on us just enough.  I had a beef dip sandwich with horseradish.  It absolutely hit the spot.  My wife had a salad that she enjoyed.  We were lucky enough to have an isolated booth that kept the noise level down and let us drop the guard on our kids.  It was well worth the trip."
Jason F.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",384,796,834,2.0,10/1/2011,Came here for happy hour around 3pm. Drinks were weak and watered down. Service was okay. Nothing to rave about.
Joanne T.,"Alhambra, CA",25,157,,4.0,12/12/2011,"Good place for family and friend gatherings. Nice big TV in front of the bar. Plenty of seating deep within the restaurant. Service is standard and they usually come around to check on you.  Food comes out a bit slow, but that's what the TV is for, I guess. I liked the sliders, minestrone soup (although a bit salty when I had it the second time around), asian chicken salad, and the pizookie!  You have to order the pizookie if you come! It's simple, choose your cookie dough and top with ice cream. When I used to eat chocolate, I luved the warm white chunk mac nut with vanilla ice cream. It was sooo delicious!  This particular location is quite busy at night, but it's within a mall, so there's plenty of parking. Not too fond of the crowd though, but sometimes you just have to tough it out especially if you're craving some pizookie!"
Juliana Y.,"Pasadena, CA",379,419,1839,1.0,1/6/2014,been here a few times and it was xmas eve so i already expected poor service which is not a big deal for me.. i get it.. it's xmas eve they dont wanna over staff and hold them from their family gatherings.. surprisingly there were more people there than expected.. their system kept on crashing.. my order took a long time.. the food was still pretty good except for my salad which was overly dressed.. had to send it back.. the soup and bread bowl was good.. at the end when the bill came they had forgotten to take off the salad.. and i was told that the system was down so i might not be able to use my g/c.. also they did the calculations manually since the system was down.. and over charged me.. b/c once the system was up..my total was different.. is there something wrong there??? -_-
Galen C.,"Chino Hills, CA",0,14,6,1.0,2/21/2015,Very mismanaged. The hostess made us wait in the lobby for no reason!  Terrible service.
Juan B.,"South El Monte, CA",19,9,8,1.0,5/19/2013,"The food was good. The service was mediocre. They gave us dirty looking silverware twice. I had to get ice out of my water to clean the silverware. Not one server or bus boy had the presence in mind to pick up the pile of dirty silverware from our table. Even tho this BJ's is by far closer to where I live, I would not go back to this one. I would go to Arcadia or West Covina instead."
G D.,"Beverly Hills, CA",2,15,,4.0,2/17/2015,"While this isn't the first time I've been to this location, I wanted to give my compliments to the manager. To set the scene, I went with my girlfriend's family to eat and we were a big party. It was about 6 pm and the place was pretty busy. Waitress came and took our order. Wait time for food was longer than normal, but acceptable. I ordered a buffalo burger off of the ""healthy"" menu choices, medium rare. I was aiming to not totally pig out tonight. Anyway, the food came out, I cut my burger in half, and took a couple of bites.  It was rare at best, but I think it was slightly raw. I flag the waitress down and tell her about it. She says I can have it cooked more or have it remade.  She also suggested upping the temperature to medium. I thought remaking as medium was fine and she takes my food back. While waiting manager (I think his name is Chris, but not 100% since it was pretty loud) comes by, apologizes for under cooked burger, and offers a soup or salad to tide me over. I decline because I didn't want to over eat. Second burger comes out and I cut it down the middle.  It's even MORE under cooked and looks raw in the middle.  My girlfriend brought a waiter (not the one serving our table) and sends the burger back.  Manager comes back and apologizes again. I ask him for a menu so I can order something else (grilled turkey and ham sandwich). He brings my food out and apologizes again. About half way through me eating, manager comes back to check up on me. He offers dessert to the table. I tell him others have already ordered a pizookie and he says he'll make it so we can all share it. I believe it was also comped. The pizookie was upgraded to the large size and it was half white chocolate and half regular chocolate. Don't know if anyone from BJ's will read this but I wanted to give credit to the manager for handling the situation professionally and quickly. I can't thank the manager enough as not all mangers were as nice as him. I also hope he was able to actually see the second under cooked burger I got. The cooks probably need to cook the buffalo burgers on a part of the grill that isn't quite as hot."
Jackie D.,"El Monte, CA",14,16,8,5.0,10/8/2013,"Love this place! Pizza is great, great variety in beer!
