Rome T.,"Rowland Heights, CA",217,23,33,4.0,1/31/2012,"Server oh Server John (416 G), you DA man! You've saved BJ's from a terrible review today because of your excellent customer service. If every worker is as easy going as you are, then they place would be screaming of laughers! Not to also mention, your ""glass of water"" always being half plus full, lightening fast speedy service! Literally, eat bite I take into my awesome buffalo chicken pizza lightly drizzled with ranch, there's John right beside us asking if everything is okay.  Why this BJ's location suffered from 1 star shy away of perfection was due to the waiting time and the poor front desk service. It took us nearly an hour to be seated when we got there around 10PM and they close at 1AM. The front desk personnel appeared to had a much more greater time ignoring us and smoking/joking. Then again, we came in with a stampede of 8 people vs. the normally 3 - 5 people party that simply walks on through the entrance and on to their non-reserved seats. For BJ's: Keep in mind that your estabishment have starving people that needs assist ASAP!"
Ariel M.,"Huntington Park, CA",331,443,198,3.0,3/28/2011,"Packed, as always but I love to come to this particular location with my girls to drink and chat it up. The last time I came with my friends, the waitress rushed us and that wasn't a customary tactic of a BJ's waitress so I'm not dinging them for that, but if it happens again, I'm definitely updating my review with a lower grade. I like the TV's, the appetizers, and the beer. And when I come with my gal pals, I like it even more. The nachos are bomb diggity! I really like their tomato soup too. The best alcohol prices are during happy hour and their house brews. Large beer selection and the staff know how to pair the beers for the most part.  Stay away during a Lake Show or Dodger game because people hoard their tables and bar stools and you'll never get a seat. Also, phone ahead to sign in save time waiting!"
Eugene G.,"Pasadena, CA",15,177,,2.0,3/25/2011,"BJs use to be one of my favorite restaurants. You would get a pretty good pint of beer and a tasty slice of deep dish pizza. Now it seems that things are going down hill.  Came here and ordered a potato skin appetizer and never got it. I must have been forgotten in the sea of customers. Then ordered a porter (beer) and it just does not taste as good as it use to. I remember really enjoying the porter here. Is quality control going down hill or are they using cheaper ingredients.... or better yet is there a new brewer who isn't doing a good job? Probably a combo of both. The pizza was ""meh"" I remember really enjoying it but now its just forgettable and I'll probably look elsewhere for a decent deep dish pizza. Girlfriend ordered jambalaya and it was not very good at all. I could have made a better version at home with simpler ingredients, our version was pretty bad, not authentic and just a weird combination of flavors and ingredients. Such a disappointment."
Ashley V.,"Montebello, CA",69,4,,2.0,3/14/2014,I came to eat here with two of my friends and the waitress brought out our drinks 10 minutes after we had ordered them. They also did not bring out a pizza that we had ordered over an hour ago and when we spoke to the supervisor he didn't do anything besides offer to take it off our bill. This was the worst service I have ever gotten here and hope no one has the same experience
Eddie C.,"Downey, CA",12,186,241,1.0,11/17/2013,I hope this BJs burns to the ground! It was horrible! Pretty slow for a Sunday night and it took about 40-60 minutes from the time we ordered our food to get the food. Our original waiter left without saying anything. The food sucked. My medium-well steak had too much pink. I send it back and it came back with a bit of char on the outside but still just as pink on the inside. My dad's pizza was sad. It looked like bread and cheese. Never again coming to this place!
Vanessa G.,"Los Angeles, CA",187,32,22,5.0,2/28/2012,"Hef and appetizers ;) Oh and I made my own pizza combo and put Bacon,green bell peppers,onions,tomatoes,cheese,and pepperoni. We ordered a medium pizza and took a slice home which was just as good the next day re-heated in the toaster oven and even crispier than the day before. Our waiters were both crazy and nice and kept it real about the menu on which foods were just OK and which were to die for!Next time trying the mac and cheese just because of how he described it!Bacon baked on top=Heaven teehee! My boyfriend and I LOVED the house Heff's so much we got two each and walked out feeling pretty buzzed,nice and strong beers my favorite! Some girls next to us were celebrating their Bday and got a nice big pizzookie desert for free,I'm taking my boyfriend back here for his Bday next week to get him one too! This place is excellent for dining with friends, a date, or to watch games because the atmosphere is fun,loud,and has tons of TV's to watch games ect."
Janie T.,"Montebello, CA",57,81,195,3.0,10/10/2011,"went here for a late dinner on Saturday night after the Tiesto concert. *clam chowder- yummy! tho it was a bit salter than normal but nonetheless it was still good. grilled pork chops-  two pieces of grilled pork chops on a bed of apple sauce with a side of green beans and a side of cheddar mash.  * apple sauce- I didn't care too much for it, probably better to eat by itself as a desert after you are finished with the dish than eating it with the pork chops.  * pork chops- The first piece of was good, juicy and perfectly cook. Tho the 2nd piece was a bit on the dryer side. Perfectly seasoned.  *mash- tasted like any other mash I've ever had * green beans- steamed and not seasoned. I love veggies so this was tasty even without salt lol * mini 5 meat pizza- yummy!  * service- we sat ourselves and had to ask for menus. BUT everyone was friendly and welcoming. Food runner was super nice when he brought out our food, asked us if we needed anything else before he left.Our server was awesome! checked up on us enough to keep us satisfied. =) sorry guys, minus 1 star for the dry pork chop and having to seat ourselves."
Ami S.,"Walnut, CA",0,12,7,5.0,3/22/2015,"Can never go wrong here, great food, good selection of beer. Friendly service, always go there for avocado eggrolls and Pazookie."
Tina R.,"Alhambra, CA",25,296,54,2.0,9/3/2013,"Food was Ok but, Horrible Service!"
Disenchantedone Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,59,17,4.0,11/22/2011,"So...I've got to make amends and say  - Service here has gotten way better!  I now enjoy coming here. The ladies up front can use a slight  ""genuine"" adjustment, but other than that, most servers are well mannered and have done a great job serving us. The last lady that served us got a great tip cause she was ""the best BJ's service we've ever gotten.""  I know my little yelp comments - my complaints into the world wide web of the unknown - probably had little to do with the improved service (though I'd like to feel like it did), but at any rate...I would totally go back there again. Thanks for renewing my faith in your restaurant.  PS: Begneit! Begneit! Begneit!"
Kevin S.,"Brea, CA",184,313,35,3.0,4/13/2011,"The food and drinks are all fairly priced for the quality of food and venue, and there are plenty of TV's here to watch the game on. I give this BJ's location minus one star from my Brea location review simply because this one is super crowded a lot of the time (especially during Laker games), which for me makes it much less desirable to go to."
Jackie L.,"Los Angeles, CA",84,102,,3.0,1/25/2011,"This was your typical casual lounge type eats.. some pasta some sandwiches, pizza, flatbread.. We came here for a birthday party and we had a large group. I think we waited maybe about 20 minutes on a saturday night so that wasnt too bad.. We had a greatt server I forgot his name :( He was super friendly and took care of us the whole night.  We ordered the Ahi Poke (it was not too bad) and the BBQ chicken sandwich.. it was overtoasted and dry and there wasnt enough sauce but I swear there was a whole head of lettuce in there! After we got a free warmed chocolate chip cookie with a scoop of icecream on top and dat was pretty good. Other than that.. it was nothing too special but i mean its Bjs I didnt have high expectations. The server definately put it from a 2 star to a 3! Will I come back?....mmm not sure.."
Downtown B.,"Los Angeles, CA",254,337,51,3.0,4/14/2011,"Come on, admit it--how many of you tried this place for the first time because you had a gal-pal or buddy that said ""I WANT A PIZOOKIE!"".  ""A what?"" you say?  Then off you go to find out with a Pizookie is.. Their pizza's tasty, I'm more of a thin-crust kind of girl but I I can hang.  Keep in mind, I am the pizza-connoisseur-equivalent of a 10 year old..quite happy with Papa John's...but I would return repeatedly for beer and pizookie!"
Kim H.,"Los Angeles, CA",451,911,481,3.0,5/26/2011,Good selection of beer.  Little better food than Yardhouse but similar offerings.  These places that try to serve everything just can't seem to get it right on quality of food across the board.  It does it's job of chasing the hunger away and with all the tv's and ambiance this place is also perfect for those work lunches where you don't want to talk or don't have anything to say!
Sam C.,"El Monte, CA",0,4,25,3.0,12/20/2013,The food is sooo good went with my family and we all loved our dishes I think this place is going to become a regular for us. As for the service they were not the best they never came to check on us just came to give us the check and you have to wait a long time for your food and the place was not full so that was the down side. Just don't go when you are hungry cause you will get annoyed.
Rachel C.,"Montebello, CA",11,4,,1.0,4/28/2014,"Went with a group of friends to eat here for a celebration. Server was rude and cussed at us. I don't care if there is a lot of us and one if you. There is no reason you should be cussing at your customers. Food took forever to come out. One of our orders didnt get put in and after asking for it about 5 times he barely told us.  Cancelled 2 of our orders cause it took ridiculously long to come out. When we finally left and gave him a tip. He opened the door to yell at us at the parking lot saying ""thanks for the stupid tip"" rudest customer service ever!!!"
Casey B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,50,10,5.0,10/9/2013,"Not sure why all the bad reviews. I dinned solo, in town on business. I was seated promptly and the waitress came and took my drink order right away. I ordered strawberry lemonade YUM, a bowl of Tuscan Tomato soup YUM YUM, and the Sesame salad, was good too. I got my soup instantly and the salad came when I finished my last spoonful of soup. Fast friendly service and good food. Thanks!"
Russ N.,"Monterey Park, CA",57,189,151,3.0,3/5/2011,"Pretty good happy hour times (i think 4-7)  and decent beers.  I would strongly recommend to drinking only the beers they have on tap unless you really want one of those bottled belgium beers (usually have to ask for that menu) food is decent if you get the bazooki desert, make sure you get the normal chocolate chip cookie and vanilla ice cream.  the other combinations they have aren't as good."
Mimi C.,"Washington, DC",814,2317,481,4.0,5/23/2010,"Fast, efficient and always yummy food.  I really have no complaints about BJ's, it's such a wonder how they  get so much food out to so many people in such a short amount of time.  What's nice about this BJ's is that it's in the mall, so you can get your shopping done when you're done. :)"
David K.,"San Gabriel, CA",14,118,120,3.0,8/12/2008,"Decent large brewhouse/sportsbar chain resturant, food is not cheap however. The food and service has always been pretty good every time I go, though some of the servers seem a little... well... strange. The pizookie is a great dessert if you have never tried one its worth getting at least once. I suprisingly enjoy their salads and sandwiches and burgers and the pizza is okay too. I have gone to the location in arcadia/monrovia for years and years, and for the most part this location is far better then that old one. At least this one doesn't smell like old one does sometimes."
