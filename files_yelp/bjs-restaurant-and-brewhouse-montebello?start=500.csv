A M.,"La Mirada, CA",0,3,,1.0,1/30/2015,"Who is in charge of this place?! The customer service is horrible. Grilled fish tacos are good, getting them is the hard part."
Ashley S.,"La Habra, CA",35,7,4,1.0,4/1/2014,"This is how my 4 year old daughters birthday was ruined...My daughter loves the happy face potatoes here. We went last year for her birthday. We had a great experience. We went again this year, per her request. The hostesses were great. After that it was the worst service I've ever received anywhere. It took 40 minutes for us to be able to order. Then once the order was about to be put in, one of my guest suggested we should change the crust of a pizza. The server, Raquel, rudely interrupted our conversation, demanding we tell her right then and there what we wanted. I told her I would let her know when we were done discussing the issue and I would let her manager know myself. Her tone changed immediately. At this point I thought she was already overly rude and asked her to leave the table. As She walked away she said ""I knew this would happen"" loud and clear for my 15 person table full of family to hear. This was so embarrassing to be disrespected in front of my whole family. Then I went to speak with the manager to let her know I wanted another server. I walked into the server bad mouthing me. Then the manager slightly acknowledged me. I went back to our table the manager came and explained she was the GM. put a New server on our table, who we rarely saw. She gave us 3 pizookies and 10 dollars off a 300+ bill. Thanks! Oh yea and they kept some kids vouchers we didn't use after all. The only reason for a star at all, are the hostesses and the random server who showed up and gave us boxes and all kinds of waters to go... I hope the tip went to him and him only. I will stick with Pasadena or Downey from now on...."
Rzzzo B.,"Eastvale, CA",1,25,12,1.0,5/31/2012,THIS IS THE MOST -ABSOLUTE-WORST-FCKN BJ's ever. go to Arcadia or Chino Hills. PERIOD. this aint even worth my time to post my experience. just read all the other negatives here.
Burrito M.,"San Francisco, CA",0,769,49,2.0,2/24/2011,"There really is no where to eat in the city of Montebello, CA.  So if you gotta grub, I guess you have to go to BJ's.  The food is edible, but on par with other chain sit down restaurants (i.e. Chili's, Appleby's, etc). I ordered the 1/2 chicken club w/ a side caesar.  The club was decent, but the salad was so gross, the lettuce leaves were wilted and disgusting. I would have rated it a 1, but the service was pretty good, and like I said, there is NO where else to eat!"
Suzanne L.,"Alhambra, CA",1,50,7,1.0,6/2/2014,"The food here is just okay, but the service is terrible. Came here with my whole family to celebrate my sister's birthday. The waitress seamed flustered and bothered by having to take care of such a large party. She was rude and unhelpful and when I went to complain to the manager she brushed me off and waived over the assistant manager. He apologized for both the waitress and the manager and did his best to help service the rest of our meal. Meanwhile the manager never even bothered to come speak with us and did her best to not look at us on the way out. All in all definitely not work the trouble for mediocre food."
Cali E.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,75,1,4.0,6/23/2011,"This review is for the bar area during happy hour. A friend who swears by BJ's for happy hour demanded we go here. It was very crowded and there was nowhere to sit when we first got there. But we camped out near a couple who looked like they were going to leave and got a booth within 5 minutes. We sat down but didn't get any attention from a waiter or busboy for several minutes. It wasn't until we asked for someone to clear and clean the table that they did anything. Aside from the rocky start, once the waitress came by, we were served promptly. The prices are very reasonable for happy hour. My friend and I shared a mini pizza, each got side salads, and shared a mini pazookie (sp?) and I got a sangria and it was all under $22. Not bad! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because the tables, even after being wiped off, were still greasy. The salt and pepper shakers also needed to be cleaned. Definitely won't let that stop me though. I'll be back for more soon!"
Johnny L.,"Monterey Park, CA",637,44,,4.0,9/5/2010,"One of my favorite spots Good for happy hour! 3-7pm (m-friday), and late night happy hour 10pm - 1am (sunday - thursday) $4 pint house brewed beers here are awesome. I recommend the jeremiah red if it's your first. But you can also ask the bartender to mix the beers for you if you're into that, A red + blonde, is a perfect mix by the way. but they have a great menu, and the staffs here are friendly, especially the bartenders.  they might be slow on the service sometimes, depending on how busy it is but just be on top of your server and they'll pay attention"
Alberto C.,"Burbank, CA",0,19,,2.0,10/13/2013,"Took the Mrs for early dinner. My wife ordered a  burger which she claims was okay, however fries were served cold. My wife have potato wedges. My Cesar salad wasn't good but I still ate it. It was too tangy and the lettuce tasted old. The portions were small compared to the price. The habit burger grill has the best Cesar salad. They get it right all the time. My clam chowder was awesome. The portion and temperature were perfect. I needed something hot because the place was too cold. I'm glad I a wore a sweater.  The waiter was great and the place was very clean. The manager came by but we did not tell how we really felt about the food. We were disappointed."
Eddie G.,"Montebello, CA",0,2,5,1.0,12/15/2013,"We like to watch football at different restaurants, where the beer selection is good, I enjoy IPAs and ciders. BJs meets the requirements, but the servers there act like they are doing us a favor and decided to argue with us. She got the order wrong and told us what we said was what she brought. I have been in this industry for 20 years and for her to tell us that we were wrong and continued to say it over and over was......  Well we stood up, turned around and slowly walked to the front door. I know she saw us leaving and did nothing to stop us, or try to fix the problem. In stead she cleaned off the table and waited for the next guest to insult.  I understand that it is busy and that you maybe a bit stressed, but as someone in the   Service industry you should always handle yourself in a professional manner. One should never make the guest feel bad or sorry that they walked in the door. Bottom line is we are there to spend money and a good time if BJs can't deliver we will go somewhere else. We went across the street to Applebee's. It is really sad when my community and local restaurant gets such a bad review. Listen up all you bad servers please go do something else if you do not enjoy working around people, it will save us all time and frustration. Also to the management that hires these people please don't settle find the right person for the job!! Remember that servers and host are on the front lines they are what makes it or brakes it for us, your food could be out of this world, the beer could be one of a kind but if you treat me like ....... I will never talk about it to my friends and family. As a matter of fact they will only hear the bad stuff because I am spending my hard earned money at a place that took it and punched me in face in the process. It's sad that I need to go to another town or community to spend my money!!! Think about this people."
Leslie T.,"Rosemead, CA",369,57,4,3.0,8/15/2012,"A typical place my friends and I go to have birthday celebrations. Probably because of the free mini pizookie they give. I think that's my favorite thing about this place, the pizookies. Anyway, I got the scampi pasta which was pretty good. The shrimp was very flavorful and I liked the lemony taste of the angel hair pasta. The garlic bread was mediocre though. Although the food was good, the service was terrible. When we asked for the check and to-go boxes, it took forever and our waiter forgot the to-go boxes. I'll probably return every now and then..."
Shirley L.,"San Gabriel, CA",141,31,16,2.0,2/20/2013,"Came in here for lunch with my sister this afternoon and when we walked in, the host in the front was wiping windows and didn't greet us and just looked at us. There was another lady in the front but she didn't bother asking us anything or greeting us. Atleast our waitress was alright. But the food wasn't. My chicken fettuccine alfredo tasted really plain and came with probably 8 strands of noodles.  The pizza was whatever. Right before we left, some customers were leaving and were greeted with a bye. When we left, we got nothing. I thought these restaurants were all about customer service."
Kendall Y.,"Oakland, CA",0,10,5,1.0,12/2/2013,"Staggers the imagination, it really does. I did not know a business with this poor quality food and service still existed. I wished I had read a few Yelps before going. I'll make this brief: 1) awful food 2) worse service My burger looked like a (literally...) McDonalds cheesburger, they got the order wrong... twice... too forever to served. Ok look, I understand this is not ""fine dining"" but does it have to be THIS BAD? It is an embarasement, really it is.  I suggest run, don't walk from this place...."
Jimmy K.,"Rowland Heights, CA",79,49,92,2.0,10/25/2012,"I'd give it a 1.5 if I could. I honestly never really liked BJ's. The food is whatever, I'll eat it but it's not something I ever crave for. The service here sucks. It must be because we are Asian or something. We were quickly seated but the waiters took forever to come take our orders. So long to the a point where I wanted to leave. There were many waiters walking by us but never even looked at us when we tried to get their attention.  There were about 5 tables that were seated AFTER us and the waiters were very prompted in getting their orders. Those 5 tables weren't Asian guests...I'm just saying. Finally the waitress came and took our order. The food and drinks came out pretty quick but she didn't even bring us small plates for the appetizers. That should come out right after we put the order in. The waitress also took forever to refill my drink. And I thought Korean restaurants had bad service."
Jer D.,"Los Angeles County, CA",9,37,12,2.0,3/25/2013,"I don't know what happened with their deep dish pizza or what kind of corporate agenda they've got at BJ's but I was disappointed with their so-called ""deep dish"" pizza. It's no longer served in a deep dish pan but in a tray. I haven't been there in a while but this happened? Not pleased because i obviously went there to have their signature Deep dish. Chicago deep dish is no longer at BJ's. I liked how it tastes but i expected something else. That's what is keeping it from better earned stars"
Haik K.,"San Francisco, CA",412,474,13,1.0,2/6/2010,"Alright. THe first time I went to this place I took my little sister so we could check out Montebello's new place to eat and drink. The PLACE IS PACKED all the time. The place attracts mostly a clean cut, family oriented, non-raunchy types. Big Woop.  The reason this place gets 1 star is because my friends decided to get me drinks when I turned 21. Great friends. They called BJs and said if it would be alright if we came in at midnight, and started drinking. They said YES. When we got there, I had a couple drinks in me already and the waitress sat us allll down, made us order our food and drinks, but told me I COULDNT HAVE ANYTHING TO DRINK. Well FUCK YOU BJs for your CORPORATE TRIFLING WAYS. They made everyone pay for their food and take it to go. We went to ORDONEZ, which is, despite considered by some to be worse than BJ, turned out to be a place where they could respect a man and his friends in festivities. Even the people around us were buying our party drinks. THATS A REAL FUCKING BUSINESS, LOVE YOU ORDONEZ AND HOPE BJs can go out of business and be replaced with a payless shoe store.   The  bartenders are cool, but the rest of the service pretty much sucks. Oh yeah, another thing that gets me about this place is that ALL OF A FUCKING SUDDEN, everyone in the area goes out for drinks here. As if a great institution like Charlie Browns across the street was never there. Psh...goes to show you that if you have a Corporate name on your side, youll get all the fake ass people with the shittiest service with sub-par food and crappy tasting homemade beer. NEGATIVE STARS."
Berta R.,"Whittier, CA",111,6,1,5.0,11/2/2014,"This BJs has always been good to me! Don't know why it got bad reviews. I love it! Food is great, service is great, it's always busy which may be a good or bad thing depending how you feel. I love it and I still continue to go!"
R A.,"Anaheim, CA",0,17,4,1.0,8/22/2013,"Wow what the f! Got seated and waited 20 minutes until we were able to flag someone down. Pissed off, didn't even bring our soda until we were done eating. $0 tip, goodbye. Never again."
Trish C.,"La Puente, CA",35,20,1,1.0,7/18/2012,"Screw this place, the service sucks and the food is lacking flavor. Stay away from the turkey burger, the only good part of it is mushrooms & avocado.The waiters here are extremely rude and just want to get you the hell out of there. It's always super packed and you will always get shitty service."
Claudia V.,"Whittier, CA",2,11,2,2.0,1/17/2010,"My husband and I always resort to this bj's because it's close to home but we always leave disappointed. Yesterday was the kicker. We were seated immediately but it took the waiter about 15 mins to acknowledge us. It took another 15 mins to get our salads. It took a few more for the waiter to fetch silverware so we were just staring at our salads for a while. 5 minutes later, our entrees came. My husband ordered the fish and chips and I ordered the chicken pasta. The pasta was a little dry. My husband requested malt vinegar to go with his fish but finished his meal before it got cold. The waiter came  10 mins later with it claiming he had to refill the ice bin. Aren't customers their first priority? Food was so-so and the service was horrible!!!!"
Michele S.,"Montebello, CA",58,98,17,2.0,6/8/2010,"When you tell someone it's going to be 50 minutes for a table, know what you are talking about. I checked on my reservation and I was told there were 40 people ahead of me! FORTY!! so it would be another 40-50 minutes.  I've been here before and the food is fine, but this lack in knowledge and wasting my time makes me think twice about trying you again."
