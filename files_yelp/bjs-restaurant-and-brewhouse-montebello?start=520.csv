chavo d.,"Los Angeles, CA",183,181,1111,3.0,11/15/2010,"Great lunch specials, but hit-and-miss service. Sometimes you get a friendly and bright individual, but now and again, you get the doe eyed apathetic teenage drone. Like Libby R. says. BJ's is all about the Pizookie; sound advise. Next time I'll come for the gigantic cookie bar-side, and avoid the robots."
Daisy A.,"Los Angeles, CA",10,144,35,1.0,10/30/2012,"We phoned in an order and were told it be ready in 15 min. We show up and are told the ""takeout guy"" is out on a delivery and will be back in 15 min...we had to wait while our order is sitting there ready and ALL the ""non takeout"" Employees are standing around chatting. Baloney. Stupid people."
Diego A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,13,,4.0,7/9/2013,Service was good. Food was good but food did take a little long to get to our table on a slow day.
Jess J.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,2.0,6/16/2013,"The food is good but seriously sometimes the waiters......  I mean seriously some are just horrible! Tall blond guy.... slow took FOREVER to bring a sample of beer and when my boyfriend did get it was warm. Girl with red hair..... only came to our table twice... she asked us if our food was okay..when we did not even touch it because our beer took AN HOUR TO ARRIVE AT OUR TABLE.... and they brought us the wrong beer.  We just asked to get our beer with our food..... Ha.... Nice work you two! I think the only good thing about the service was that the waiter, who had mostly all the tables and a party of 20 or more people was able to give us good service.  I think this BJ's is okay, certain food is really good and certain food is not. The beer they have here is good too. But seriously like one person said ""service is a hit-or-miss"" here. And this night was not the only time the waiters are just whatever, it has happen a couple times.  Another time our waiter actually sat with us to take our order and even asked for his tip because he was leaving early."
Gladys R.,"Los Angeles, CA",17,23,12,1.0,5/29/2012,"First time trying BJ's after hearing many good things from many different people, I was disappointed. Bad service, disagreeable food, worthless experience. Came in around 9:30pm, group of 4, as a hang out. Ordered drinks, all good. Ordered the wedges fries to start off and the others ordered a ""Pizookie"". Why did it take over 40 minutes to get some fries and a cookie?? And the restaurant was rather empty! I had considered ordering an entree but the wait and unappetizing options on the menu turned me off. We got the fries and pizookie after what felt and was very much likely an hour. You could taste the frozen storage inside the hot yum-looking fries-- Not fresh, not cool! The cookie was good but what hot cookie doesn't taste good? The ice-cream was forgettable. My friend got ugly oranges on his Blue Moon and when he ordered a second one, I'm sure our server forgot after 20min. about it and the bartender brought it over.  Don't plan on coming  back... That's why I usually stay away from big restaurant food chains because they get away with crappy food and bad service but make tons of money thanks to tv commercials that lie."
Christopher C.,"Montebello, CA",1,30,1,5.0,11/24/2012,"This place gets extremely packed on weekends. Thank goodness for the fast servers and waitresses here. I they take your order in a snap, and although the food takes a while to come around, it is without a doubt delicious! We spent about an hour and fifty minutes total for a short family dinner and had to order and extra entrée to go for my brother which took about half our stay here. The manager approached us and told us that he was extremely sorry for the wait and that it wasn't right that it took so long and gave us a new bill in which he took off the price of the extra entrée we ordered. The place is run the right way and it's nice seeing true service like that."
Stephanie L.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",829,111,17,4.0,1/17/2008,"LOL! I've been reading these comments about the Montebello Mall.. I will have to admit, it is ghetto as all get out. I grew up in the South Bay, so I am used to Class A rated retail. Anyhow, this BJ's is right across the place from where I work, so it is very convenient for me :) I have gotten to  know a couple of the bartenders and their service is unparalleled.... the food to me was ""ok"" -- I am not really a fan of BJ's food but the Blackened Chicken sandwich rocked. The pizza was decent. I can't really complain. The only thing I will complain about is the ghetto-ness. I hope this place lasts... it always seems to be busy, at least when I am there!"
Rosie S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,,4.0,10/20/2014,"Had the turkey burger (my new trend, not eating red meat but once a week)  it has a good taste and very filling! It comes with fat or skinny fries. Everything that I have tried at BJ's has always been good! Even their lunch specials are filling!"
Anthony V.,"Montebello, CA",57,34,7,4.0,10/8/2010,"I go to BJs for the beer and sport events, everything else is a bonus.  The beer selection is pretty good. The Jeremiah red is tasty, the hefe is light but satisfying and the occasional seasonal is decent. My beer choices usually come off the Belgian menu though. Chimay's, Duvel, Orval, Delirium Tremens, Westmalle, etc. That is a pretty impressive list of beers for a chain restaurant. The food varies and can be hit or miss. I love the buffalo chicken pizza, buffalo wings and the french dip. They aren't top of class plates at all but they go well with beer. The food here isn't supposed to knock you out of your seat, its supposed to be something you throw in your stomach to compliment the beer. Its good for what it is and most of the time its satisfying. Don't come here expecting much and you will leave pleasantly surprised."
Jennifer Z.,"San Gabriel, CA",307,4,,3.0,5/26/2013,"I planned a birthday ""dinner"" (which started at 4PM because they couldn't take later reservations). The manager there was VERY impatient and rude over the phone. Things were more complicated than they had to be. It was understandable that at least half of the party had to arrive before we went in and the waitresses there were nice and welcoming! The food was alright... Or at least what I ordered when reserving was. We paid $20 each for 3 kinds of pizza, one salad, and one pasta and many of us paid extra for large pizookies. But the $20 definitely wasn't worth it.  I give it a 3 only because the service there was nice. But the manager most definitely gave me a bad impression."
J M.,"Los Angeles, CA",25,25,10,1.0,6/29/2010,"Worst service EVER!  2nd time coming here. Ordered my food and received something entirely different.  Brought it to the attention of our waitress and was told I was wrong-mind you, she never wrote down our order but informed us she would remember!  First time here was for my birthday where everyone else received their food and had eaten it but I never got mine!   NEVER AGAIN......I would rather eat at Burger King upstairs!"
Tiffany I.,"Rosemead, CA",1871,79,6,4.0,10/21/2012,"I really like the location of the restaurant! This location is so close and so convenient as well. Everytime I wanted to go to a BJ's, I either had to drive all the way to the one in Monrovia or in Covina. Then, I realized a Pizooki isn't worth my gas and time if I can just get one over here close by."
Jay K.,"Los Angeles, CA",1127,338,660,4.0,9/19/2010,"The service was simply outstanding. I made a large party reservations, the reservationist was absolutely polite and upbeat. When we got there, the table was ready PRIOR to our arrival. The server was the best I had in a long time. He was busy, but attentive, accommodating and sincerely nice. All this when the place was packed w/ guest.  Thumbs way up based upon service!!!"
Maria S.,"Los Angeles, CA",59,9,5,2.0,4/29/2013,"Noisey, parking is ALLwAYS a problem, and as busy as this place gets one would think that management would schedule accordingly.   But this is not the case.   They were understaffed and service was therefore terrible. Just to get the bill the wait was about 40 min."
Christopher M.,"Pomona, CA",0,5,1,4.0,6/29/2013,The atmosphere is very relaxed with a hint of bustle.  The food was prepared in a timely manner.  The temperature was a very welcome escape from the scorching heat of the summer sun.
Steve G.,"Los Angeles, CA",28,87,52,3.0,10/31/2012,"Spoons and forks are dirty, there beer is good. new variety of food... something different.. pizza is good. descent.. !"

Ralph C.,"Chino Hills, CA",1,4,,4.0,12/14/2009,"When me and the wife come here it's always to the bar. It gets pretty packed here. They have some pretty good brews. I like the Jeremiah Red and just recently tried the delicious Tatonka Stout. Both strong beers. Happy Hour is the best time to come. You can't really beat $3.50 for some nice beers. And half-priced mini pizza. My wife is a fan of their potstickers, especially for $2 off appetizers. Oh, and a mini pizzookie with your stout to finish it off. And that's Happy Hour...  Let's see.. on the actual meal side, I've had: Burger melt with seasoned wedge fries - Awesome with that sauce they put in... Jambalaya which is really spicy (Not recommended before bedtime) Chili in a bread bowl - Really good as well. My wife said it tasted like Weinershnitzel. But I like Weinershnitzel. So that's a good thing.  Overall, the service is really good. They had their problems when they first opened, but everything runs much smoother now. The ambiance is very laid back, which i like. It's not too loud or anything. It's a very Hispanic BJ's. Very comfortable. I don't feel like i belong when I'm in a restaurant full of white people. sorry. Growing up in East L.A. does that to you, i guess.  Oh, first review! I did it! :D"
William M.,"Baldwin Park, CA",252,439,155,2.0,4/25/2010,"I met a friend here for lunch today- We sat at the bar so we could catch the NBA playoff game. Bar was kinda empty maybe 5-6 tables taken. Bartender comes out to greet us and take our drink orders. The thing that bugs me is they dont carry the beer I like (fat tire). So I order the turkey club since I had pizza the other day. Plus Im not a huge fan of their pizza. Its way greasy. Turkey club was ok - nothing special about it. The service could have been better IMO. She hardly came back to check on us, my buddy ordered another beer and it took forever for her to get it and by this time there was someone backing her up at the bar. The food was ehhhh and the service was blah......and it wasnt busy."
Kat L.,"Monterey Park, CA",176,31,6,3.0,1/23/2013,"Even though there were many negative comments on this place my friends and i still decided to try this bjs out. Our waiter was very attentive and always came back occasionally to check on us and to refill our drinks although the wait was 40 minutes i would say that this should not be the bjs of your choice. Their cream sodas look like sodas but do taste like cream usually they would serve it in mugs with cream looking on top but for some reason all we got was regular looking soda. The steak were A-OK, their pasta and calamari was A-OK because it was left sitting out too long or in the fryer too long because the calamari came out soggy."
