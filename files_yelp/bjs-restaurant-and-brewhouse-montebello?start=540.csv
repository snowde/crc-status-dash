Stephanie D.,"Monterey Park, CA",203,96,85,4.0,8/21/2012,Great menu with lots of variety... some of it is pricey but well worth it. Everything they serve is full of flavor.
Jeggicah C.,"San Gabriel Valley, CA",11,181,146,4.0,2/6/2012,"why people give 3 stars with pretty good views, I have no clue.  Service is pretty good here, and even though its at Montebello Mall, I can appreciate that the mall is upgrading itself from its old school Raider Nation days and added this restaurant in addition to Marie Calendars.  I was here for a party and the catering was great with spaghetti and pizza. Came on my own, and still felt the pizza was good, but their salads are amazing!  The cobb (minus bacon) is soooo good. I love that they dice the salad so small that you don't have to take your knife to it just so you can fit it in your mouth. Its chilled perfectly that it just makes you want more. The same goes for their BBQ chicken and caesar.  Their appetizers are pretty good, mostly i enjoy the artichoke / spinach dip and Santa Fe spring rolls. I'd skip out on avocado rolls unless you really really love avocados, and I do mean really.  Pizza of course their speciality, is great and full of carbs, reckless to the body, but great for the soul."
Sarah M.,"Boston, MA",107,87,2,1.0,10/24/2012,The pizza arrived cold. The waitress refused to even acknowledge our table for probably half an hour and wouldn't bring our food out without a manager's intervention. I was actually scared that the pizza was undercooked and had meat on it. They are going to make people sick with this raw meat and terrible service.
Terri C.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,16,9,1.0,2/10/2013,"They sat us down and took about 10 minutes to take our drink order.  Our waitress brings the coffee and it is all a mess. The coffee spilled all into the saucer. Server stated she would bring a new cup, never brought it. Even after I asked for a new cup since the coffee was cold. Finally took our food order. 45 minutes later, our waitress is no where to be seen and our food has not arrived. Well it did, put another server gave it to the table next to us. But, wait it gets better, not only did the server not notice that he delivered the wrong food, neither did the patrons who received  it. Everyone around us , who were seated after we were received their food before we did.  Asked both our server and the server who gave our food to another table to call the manager, but he never came over. We had to call him over.   The worst service I have ever received. Clueless Staff and Clueless Manager."
Adriana Z.,"La Puente, CA",4,1,,5.0,3/14/2013,I highly recommend Bj's. I enjoyed the atmosphere and friendly staff. I like their mojitos and their pizza is amazing!!!
Josh V.,"Montebello, CA",37,13,3,5.0,2/19/2012,"Very dope place to go with friends, family or even a date. Awesome food, good prices, service can be better though. But it's a good place to have lunch or dinner at, I enjoy there salads, sandwiches an there deserts 6:"
Justin T.,"Los Angeles, CA",181,91,64,3.0,6/4/2012,"We had a platter combination, a burger and salad. Food was ok, service not that good."
Dana P.,"North Hills, CA",65,299,28,3.0,2/13/2010,"I am a huge BJ's fan.  We order here for work often for parties and such. This location looks nice, but the servers virtually vanish into thin air once you order which makes it painful to come here on your lunch hour. Also, we had a couple of screw ups with the to-go orders, but nothing TOO major. Will continue to come here, but they really need to work on the customer service."
Thomas T.,"Placentia, CA",35,51,,3.0,5/8/2011,"I go here for three reasons - Jeremiah Red, Great White pizza, and to watch the Lakers or Dodgers Play. The service can get slow and sloppy during happy hour, but the quality of the food is always good. One thing to pay extra attention to is the cleanliness of the plates and glasses on the table. I have seen numerous things left over on dishes, such as salad on a plate or lip gloss on a beer glass that the dish washing machine failed to remove. Overall, A-OK."
Ayami H.,"Orange County, CA",658,546,745,4.0,5/31/2009,"i like this location!! less crowded than the monrovia or brea locations... i've only had to wait one time in the many times i've been here and that was because it was a friday night.  i almost always get the chinese chicken salad (that's not what its called but thats what it is). cabbage, some kind of nappa looking leaves, wonton crunchies, green onions, tangerines and slices of chicken on top. i've been asking for the dressing on the side now since BJ's doesnt provide nutrional info on their meals... you need to eat good to be bad with the pazookies right!? eh... food is good and the service is good. if i have a problem, ive always had friendly help from the workers there.  tried the thai shrimp wrap today, it was pretty good considering i dont like shrimp. i just put it aside and ate the rest :)"
Tanya P.,"Los Angeles, CA",35,39,5,5.0,2/16/2012,"I love this bj's! I come here at least once a month. Yes the wait can be long, but you're always warned. The servers are always nice. We had an issue with our recently and they were so gracious about it that we couldn't be upset about it, everyone makes mistakes. The manager, Alfredo personally came and apologized and comped out dessert. We didn't need a free dessert, but he didn't have to comp anything. The food and drinks are always yummy, but I think the excellent customer service keeps us coming back."
Eric H.,"Whittier, CA",10,70,2,3.0,7/1/2009,"This is like most of the other BJ's (if you know the chain), just smaller.  We've had mixed luck with dinner service, but weekday lunches are very fast and service is excellent if you just sit at the bar.  Joshlind is there most weekdays, and is fantastic - the food consistently comes out fast from the kitchen right behind the bar.  Only frustrating part is I have to stick to root beer because I have to go back to work after :-(  but I highly recommend the Nutty Brewnette if you are free to imbibe. For the un-initiated, the highlights here are craft beers, Chicago-style pizzas (deep-dish with chunky tomatoes) and the Pizookie, which is a warm-mushy cookie in a pie plate, topped by a huge scoop of ice-cream, which is great for sharing."
Andy F.,"Whittier, CA",120,175,15,4.0,8/25/2011,"BJ's Brewhouse is the same all around. Good mini pizza's specially when they are on happy hour prices, can't go wrong with  one of those. I had the pepperoni and mushrooms always a favorite. This location is a good size, I always enjoy the bar area since they have plenty of TV's to keep you up to date on sports."
Cynthia A.,"Montebello, CA",2,11,,3.0,4/7/2014,Great salafs. Great drinks. Child friendly.  A lil pricey. Always crowded. Long waiting but they move pretty fast. Service can be improved.  Way too noisy. Tiny full bar area
Bijan A.,"Montebello, CA",341,73,75,3.0,6/15/2009,"Ok, I've been a fan of Bj's since I first discovered them years ago.  This location though, not so much.  the food is what you expect from Bj's. Everything has always been served piping hot and tasty from my experiences.  The only complaint I have to this location is the wait time.  The servers are very friendly and informative but they just don't seem to have the rhythm down. They lack the skills.  You'll soon go parched and pass out of thirst before you see a server within range to be flagged down. And the time that goes by from being seated to having someone come and ask to take your order is sometimes ridiculous.  The food has always come quickly when I've visited though.  I was there for the Laker game last night, GO LAKERS, and we ordered burgers, appetizers, and a sandwich and had it all at the table in just under 10 minutes which was a huge surprise given how busy it was.  This location is not the cleanest either. I usually find myself asaking to have the table wiped down again when I'm seated. Sorry, but I don't like a greasy table to eat at. Gross.  This place is, in my opinion, average. Nothing special.  Decent prices some good food.  Definitely not a place to go for dates, to take your parents to, or even co workers. LOL. Just a spot to eat with some buddies maybe.  I prefer the other BJ's locations over this one."
Vicki L.,"Stockton, CA",60,73,21,2.0,7/15/2011,"We came on a weekday around lunch time. It was pretty empty considering it was lunch time, at a mall, and during summer. We were seated a few minutes after entering the restaurant but the waitress took about 10 minutes to get to our table. We ordered our drinks and food right away since they gave us such a long time to look over the menu. It took about 20-30 minutes to get our food. We waited for such a long time but the waitress never came by to tell us when our food was coming or anything. I was a bit disappointed by the amount of time it took. Service seemed pretty slow all around though.. judging from the people around me twiddling their thumbs waiting for their food too."
Eric B.,"Alhambra, CA",221,8,,3.0,8/23/2010,This place is a good place to go have appetizers and watch sports events. the service is okay not the best. it gets really crowded when there is a sports game on. the food is good.  i love their clam chowder. their entrance spin door is a plus. tvs are all over so you can watch anything on espn. they have a fully stocked bar and brew of their own mix. the parking is kind of bad because they share with the mall.
Gwen S.,"La Verne, CA",20,15,1,4.0,8/7/2011,"I've been coming here once in a while when I visit my family. It's pretty good service and the food is great. I love the chicken wings and the desserts, yummy! I'll be coming back! =)"
Laura R.,"Whittier, CA",6,117,1,3.0,1/2/2012,"My best friend invited me to dinner with her daughter.  She suggested BJ's and I agreed.  I had only been there once before, but had always wanted to come back.  I ordered the parmesan chicken and it came with mashed potatoes and broccoli.  When it came the side of broccoli consisted of like three tiny little florets.  My friend asked for more and they did bring some but I just kept thinking of that scene in the movie Road Trip with the pancakes and the horror stories my brother Vince told me about his days working in McDonald's. I always try my best to be nice and polite to my food handlers for fear of retaliation. Just saying. So the food was good, and my dessert was even better.  A baked beignet with a scope of vanilla ice cream with strawberries and whipped cream...interesting take on the strawberry shortcake. It was delicious.  All in all, I couldn't complain about the food or the service.  I hear it gets really crowded at night and that you might bump into someone you know if you grew up in the area, but I didn't see anyone I recognized. The hamburger my friend's daughter got looked really tasty and I guess it was with the way they devoured that thing. All in all it was a good experience with some good food. There are a couple of dishes I wouldn't mind coming back to try, oh yeah and that baked beignet."
Stephanie V.,"Los Angeles, CA",115,67,25,4.0,1/22/2012,"BJ's is one of those restaurants that always delivers. They have good happy hour and the pizza here is great. They have a good selection of beers and home brews. Great place to catch a game, but hard to find seating once the game is going so make sure you go early enough to find seating. The staff is good and knowledgeable."
