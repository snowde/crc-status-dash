Jer C.,"Monterey Park, CA",11,19,1,3.0,4/11/2009,"Came to this place for a birthday gathering that the girlfriend's middleschool friend threw.  Swivel Door!! There were a couple of pizzas, a salad, and alfredo. I liked the pizzas; they were very warm, thick and soft. But they're just pizzas, so it doesn't get more complicated than that. The girlfriend complained about how thick the crust is, but I thought it was alright as long as they weren't stiff and dry like the usual fast-food pizzas out there. I liked the MEDITERRANEAN pizza over the BARBEQUE CHICKEN and SWEET PIG. Sorry it's in all Caps, I pasted from the Site Menu. The Alfredo was alright. Very thick sauce. The pasta was a bit stiff, though. But nothing a hungry asian can't handle.  The BBQ CHICKEN CHOPPED SALAD was pretty good, though. I especially liked the black beans that they put in there.  I must say, though, for a big group of 40+, we sure had good service. The first waitress that took our orders for our drinks (and continued asking if we needed refills every 10 minutes) was friendly, cute, and patient. The girlfriend immediately struck up a conversation with her about Target pens =_= Lastly, the root beer; rich, smooth, nice. And as an added bonus, I met a very interesting couple. Schwing!"
Fanon P.,"Los Angeles, CA",215,388,248,3.0,9/5/2011,"Ok another attendance of one of those dreaded bday bad restaurant of choice celebrations! Today folks behind door number 1 is BJ'S (insert cheer track). Ok what really  made my gears grind were the little ass cups of beer at this location, and the fact our waitress had no clue of life, Other than that I had fun, and drunk a lot, I ordered buffalo wings and these bad boys were screaming! I mean I didn't even expect the wings to be this damn good, definitely took me by surprise, they were cooked perfectly. only other thing I had were the avocado egg rolls and those were aight, but I now know what my favorite thing on the menu here is. HOTWINGS"
Matthew C.,"Pasadena, Los Angeles, CA",191,12,16,5.0,7/21/2011,Everyone there was so friendly and had a great environment. The food was prepared quickly and had great service. The beer selection of house beers are great try the Jeremiah red gets you wasted quick
H. M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1305,134,254,1.0,10/31/2012,"had just tried bj's for my dinner last night with my bff actor/artist/model, m.t. and while waiting to be seated, noticed the very stunning art deco era spinning glass entrance doors. loved it! and the interior lightings reminded me of a mini vegas casino restaurant area which was pleasant. a little vaca imagination.  but the whole restaurant was not completely packed and yet the wait (for a very hungry person as myself who hadn't yet eat all day because i was occupied with work) was a bit long. the so called five minutes wait was actually 30 mins wait.  as we were led to our booth, we had ordered and the waitress left to take orders from her other tables. as my bff, m.t. and i were waiting for our dinners, my caesar salad arrived and i immediately noticed there were no forks, spoons, and napkins on our table. which was naturally an epic fail in management. how the manager seem to bypass the training of his employee/waitresses and waiters was a very big question mark. AND THIS HAPPENS AT EVERY BJ'S! tried them all to see if there's any difference. no difference at all.  furthermore, bj's strawberry lemonade was way too sweet. the drink was calling out, diabetes?! don't mean to be funny here but the drink was sweeter than sugar cubes themselves.  and bj's pasta (the fusilloni pasta in which they mistakenly had in their menus as ritoli/rinoldi noodles) was a bit soggy when the pastas should've been a bit harder.  overall first impression of this place did not meet up to its fine and lux decor.  quite disappointment."
Ianne M.,"West Covina, CA",75,7,9,1.0,4/28/2012,I'll give this branch 1 star! very slow and lousy service even when very few people are there + waiters are rude! will never eat here again!
Edith R.,"Los Angeles, CA",45,29,,4.0,1/23/2012,I've gone twice and don't have much to complain about. The food is great. I've ordered the jambalaya and it's amazing! The beer is also very good. The service was more than great.  The floors can be slippery so be very careful when u walk. I fell and unfortunately I cant blame it on the alcohol :( if it werent for this i would have given it a 5 star
Jose C.,"Whittier, CA",0,29,1,3.0,1/8/2012,I usually avoid chain restaurants but I come here for lunch at the insistence of my colleagues.  They have decently priced lunch specials.  The Cajun talapia is pretty good.
Airi M.,"Pasadena, CA",266,62,7,3.0,11/6/2010,"Pizzas rocks!! Pizzookies ROCKS!! Great place to go with friends and cool ppl. I live too far, but that place made me find other Tjs around my area!!"
George A.,"Pico Rivera, CA",14,13,79,5.0,4/11/2011,Me and my friends come here and I like it I love there pizza lol really good and service it's really nice
Alison W.,"San Jose, CA",413,1590,952,3.0,6/7/2011,"Every time I come to BJs, I think I should really try their deep dish pizza. I've only ever had deep dish in Chicago but there's looks pretty good too. But then I always get their lunch specials. This time I had the half sandwich and soup entree. I got the chicken club and the clam chowder. It was really good. Chowder was a bit salty so I could only have half of it before giving up. And the chicken was cooked well - not dry and it went well with the other ingredients in the sandwich. It also came with the option of steak fries - I love steak fries and these were seasoned really well. My friend got the grilled cheese and tomato bisque. Kinda a small potion but it was only like $6 so it was expected. They offer half a sandwich for a dollar less which would be good for a kid but you'll barely be full just on the whole sandwich. Then cause it was my birthday, I also got a mini pizookie for free. I'd never seen their mini size before. It's perfect for one but of course, I shared with my friend. For birthdays, they used to offer the regular size pizookie of any flavor but now they're skimping and only had the mini one of chocolate chip flavor. Oh well - still delicious. It wasn't too busy during a weekday lunch but our waiter seemed very scarce. Could do better in that department. Otherwise, this is def one of my fav chain places due mostly to their pizookie. Mmmm."
Bart S.,"Montebello, CA",0,4,,1.0,5/19/2013,"Went there this morning.  Okay, I admit I probably did a poor job of ordering, but I ordered the scrambled egg breakfast.  Eggs were bone dry, hash browns were bone dry.  Sourdough bread was bone dry after trying to butter it with a few frozen butter bricks.  Daughter got a baked potato and soup.  Wife got a pasta.  $47 bill.  Should have gone to Marie Calendars."
Adrian L.,"Los Angeles, CA",40,11,4,5.0,10/18/2013,"Pizza is good, but extra good with beer and good company here. Had the pepperoni extreme. Very good. Was there on a game night. Dodgers were playing, restaurant had enough tables for walk in customers."
Chance B.,"Anaheim, CA",229,23,,5.0,12/5/2011,I love this place... My better half and I order pizza to go and they got the order wrong so I had to high tale it back because white bread is not an option...once I told them they gave back the same pizza and said have it we will make a new!!! Service food and beers are always the best here!!!! Forever a loyal patron and guest!!!!!!
Art N.,"San Francisco, CA",81,26,,2.0,6/24/2011,"Consistently bad service. well at least they are consistent right? Everyone in the area knows how terrible the service can be at this location. Recently I had to ask for straws and silverware. Beverage refills and condiments we ordered for our food 3 times (yes, told the server 3 times to get us a sauce) food gets to the table at completely different times from the rest of the people you are dining with. I've gotten my salad after my entree and the food has been cold. The only thing i recommend is to have an appetizer. Its straight forward and hard to mess up. I have faith in this restaurant, more so due to its geographical location convenience but service really has made me go elsewhere."
Javier J.,"Los Angeles, CA",1656,1996,248,3.0,5/28/2008,"The Montebello Mall. You really can't get more Ghetto than this. The only problem is that it doesn't want to admit how ghetto it actually is. It hides behind some higher end shops that the are way out of the league of the average Montebello shoppers range. You have a Coach store. I'm surprised most didn't realize it was actually spelled Coach and not Couch, as their flea market knock off's would have been labelled as.  Back to BJ's. It looks nice, then again, it may as well not even be in the mall as the only entrance is located outside of the mall. A detail that allows them to serve alcohol and stay open past the hours of the mall, I bet.  The place is small for a BJ's. But what it lacks in size it makes up with numbers of TV's they have. If you're ever in the mood to watch a Lakers, Raiders or Dodgers game, you're more than welcome here. Unless you're routing for the other time. In which case don't wear your colors, you'll get shanked.  The bar area is huge. there's a large wall of liquor that just makes you want to hold your liver and be thankful it still works. Which can lead to a nicely brewed beer. They have many seasonal beers that will peak your interest and the sampler will have you on the floor.  With all this talk about beer you'll need to fill that stomach with some food. BJ's, as a chain, is pretty good. Over all the pizza quality and sandwiches are ones that I can't get enough of. Just don't walk into the mall. I guess it's a saving grace that they aren't any possible chances of stepping into the mall when you walk in here. Separated by glass, you can look at all those folks in the crappy mall shop away as you drink some good beer and drown your sorrows of being near the Montebello Mall with a piezookie."
nar b.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,31,4,1.0,8/25/2011,"Everyyyy time I go to a BJ's, they always mess up!  The most recent time I went, however, sucked! Don't get me wrong, the food IS good but they always screw everything up. For example: I had ordered a certain type of pizza, they brought me the totally wrong thing! When I nicely asked about it, the server replied, ""Oh no, that's it."" Um, nooo! I know what I ordered! The ingredients in the description didn't even match what I got! He kept saying, ""No, this is right!"" Whateverrrr. Also, my friend got a sandwich and they brought out the fries in the end. Wth?? They also took foreverrrrrr in bringing us food! Even our water! Really, it takes 25 minutes to bring water?!?! and eggrolls?! and then missing french fries and getting my pizza wrong? Ugh. He did give us free dessert for ""waiting for the food"" but still! Hmph."
Fernando Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",86,52,76,1.0,4/8/2009,This BJ's is just a regular restaurant. Nothing screams out above average. The service is poor since our waiter got one of the food orders in my group wrong and also spilled beer on my friend when he brought our drinks to the table. The waiters have a tendency of dropping and spilling things since I saw them drop plates and a pitcher of water on a table with customers sitting there. The food here is just ok. I had a Cobb salad but it just lacked flavor. It just needed more bleu cheese dressing. My friend had the pizza and looked very good but I rather go somewhere else for pizza than coming here for it.
Tatiana D.,"Pico Rivera, CA",54,48,,4.0,3/26/2008,"Nice addition to the Monteghetto mall! I LOVE pizookie!! The service here is okay. Seems like everyones new and doesn't really know what they're doing. I expected more from a ""high volume"" restaurant. When you get there when they're about to close, they tend not to care about you too much. I'm sure they just want you out but I'd probably do the same if I worked a closing shift."
Mick G.,"San Diego, CA",500,506,54,2.0,5/3/2008,"I am not a huge chain food fan, but BJ's has always managed to sorta stay on top of the fray a bit to me ... Until I dropped in here. 1.  LOUD.  REALLY LOUD.  SCREAMING LOUD inside. 2.  Poor poor poor service. 3.  Overall:  LAME."
Tania m.,"Azusa, CA",69,149,104,3.0,6/17/2008,"JUST A NOTE: the first time I went to BJ's was the one in Monrovia and they had excellent service.  Then we went to Montebello........... -1 star right off the back for having TERRIBLE service.  When someone makes a reservation and the staff is aware that a party of 13 will be arriving, wouldn't it be logical to be prepared and ready to serve?!?! NO!  It took them forever to ask us what we wanted to drink, then it took them just as long to bring us our drinks.  When we would ask for 2 drinks they'd bring us 1.  And what was their excuse? ""we were changing the keg""   wow i didn't know it took 45 min to change a keg!  (and YES I DO KNOW HOW LONG IT TAKES TO CHANGE A KEG I WORK AT DODGERS!!!  2 SECONDS) By the way... they still managed to charge us for that second drink they never brought us. HMMM! Now that I've made it clear how sucky the service was... THE FOOD... They finally managed to get our drink order right, so did they take our orders? NO!?  Another 15 for them to ask us what we wanted to eat. YAY! Finally the food arrived and even though the service sucked I must say I DO like the food.  Well at least what I had. (avocado egg rolls, HUGE bake potato and the apple crisp)  Also, I must give props to the beer (the blond) Some dishes are kinda pricey but  13 people ate, drank and had dessert.  Finally cost $300.00 including the tip.  Not too bad..."
