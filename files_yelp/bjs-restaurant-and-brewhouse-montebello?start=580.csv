L S.,"San Gabriel, CA",122,85,2,2.0,9/17/2008,"services here is horrible, came here last night with a group of friends to celeberate a bday. We first ordered a pitcher of blondie and they ended up bringing out  a pitcher of hef. To be honest this wasn't really a big deal because beer is beer it all ends up being pissed out in about 10mins anyways.  But, what wasan issue is that they didn't bring out enough cups and when we asked it took them 10mins to finally bring out the extra cups that we needed. The same went for the table setting and plates .. All in all the food here is good but the services really spoiled the night for us. I expected more from Bj's esp being a big chian and all."
Cesar C.,"Montebello, CA",56,39,14,4.0,6/19/2011,Very friendly staff!!! But the wait.......I am just going to stay quiet. :/ Our server was awesome very friendly.
Suzy G.,"Whittier, CA",78,157,84,3.0,1/5/2011,"Love the food here, especially the lunch specials! It's a good price for a good portioned meal.  Unfortunately,  the service (for the most part) is pretty slow.  The couple of awesome waiters I have had don't deserve a bad review. But really? How hard is it to have my drink filled and get me condiments like ketchup or a red pepper flakes for my pizza? i could be halfway through my meal (And I don't even eat that fast) and I could still be waiting for the stuff. And when it comes time to get the check, It's another long wait! Overall, can't come here for quick lunch...It's just not gonna happen!"
Phil W.,"Burbank, CA",188,307,37,3.0,6/7/2010,"BJ's seems to do a lot of things fairly well, but nothing exceptionally well.  I've been here several times now, and I've had their pizza, their calzones, and their chicken fingers.  Everything manages to fall on the better side of average without really standing out too much.  On my latest visit, I had the chicken fingers lunch special, which at $6 was a pretty good deal.  It turned out to be better than I was expecting, and the selection of dipping sauces was a nice touch.  The waiters are always very friendly here, and while it's not my favorite place to eat, it provides a good experience when everybody wants something a little different."
Baback D.,"Las Vegas, NV",1286,229,61,1.0,2/27/2008,"ONE STAR! Horrible service, food, atmosphere.  It's not even worth my time explaining the rating I gave it, never going back."
Mel Z.,"Cypress, CA",278,150,116,3.0,11/7/2010,Excellent pulled pork sandwiches! In general all their food is tasty and well prepared. Very clean place with a wonderful staff. Love their Blondie Beer =0) Will definitely come back here for lunch!
Matt M.,"Monterey Park, CA",195,61,28,2.0,5/22/2010,"How the hell do the appetizers get there before my beer?   I don't know what the plan is but for a brewhouse, MY BEER SHOULD GET THERE IN LESS THAN 15 MINUTES!   And BJ's beers aren't all that great anyway.   The only saving grace was when they had some different beers on tap like Arrogant Bastard and such.  Now they don't even have that.  Stella?  Seriously!  That isn't even beer!  If you are in the area and you want a good beer, ditch BJ's and go to 38 degrees in Alhambra.  Food's just as good and the beers are 6.02 x 10^23 times better!  Yes!  I said it!  6.02 x 10^23!  That's a mole!"
Judy a.,"Ontario, CA",26,256,185,4.0,10/27/2010,"Went here for lunch today, VERY busy, but the hostess tried to help and did, She took our order, I had bbq chicken and house salad. I must say it was very tasty. Will be back."
Denise S.,"Pico Rivera, CA",119,60,60,4.0,10/26/2008,"Come for happy hour....well actually don't...because I LOVE it right now because out of all BJ's happy hours that I've been to, this one is the least crowded! :)  At first I was a little weary, since I always go the Brea location and personalized service since their bartender knows my fiance and I...and I did get a negative experience during my first visit, since they didn't have any brewhouse blonde on tap since they were ""out.""   Anyways, I don't think half the crowd knows that BJ's is known for their great beer...since half the clientele kept asking for Coronas....yeah...I'm not gonna stereotype the crowd...but literally, that's all I would hear around me is people complaining about how they didn't offer Coronas.  I was like LAME---you come to a BREWHOUSE for BREWS!!!  The other thing that BJ's is known for is Pizzookies!  YUMMERS!!!  They are so good, and everytime you buy the chocolate chip pizzookie, they give a little to charity :).   Anyways...I had an awesome server named James a couple weeks ago...so go see him and when you do, tip him good because he's a sweetie and kept the glasses full! :)  The Octoberfest brew is pretty good...so go try it before it's gone."
Dana B.,"Rosemead, CA",25,35,15,2.0,10/17/2010,"Very disappointing restaurant! The service was horrible, the food was cold! Maybe I went at a bad time but regardless of that it shouldn't get that bad! I will not be going back to this one. The manager seemed unprofessional and it wasn't a acceptable experience for me unfortunately!"
Martin W.,"Vallejo, CA",169,61,21,4.0,9/22/2010,Best buffalo wings. Great customer service and they had the game on the big screen!
Mina W.,"Anaheim, CA",407,155,168,3.0,12/17/2007,"This place just opened a few months ago inside the (GHETTO-ASS) montebello mall.  It's the only decent place to eat in the entire mall, so obviously it gets pretty craaaaaaaaazy during peak hours (last night was a 1.5 hour wait! so we bounced like bad checks). I went there again today during lunch b/c I had a free coupon for a pizookie.  Luckily we got there before the lunchtime rush (11:40am) b/c by 12:30 it was utter madness!  The party of 10 right next to our table got their orders messed up like 5x.  One waitress was acting all rude like it was the customers fault.  Luckily, my friend and I didn't encounter such problems, but the hectic craziness all around me was kinda stressing me out.    K, now on to the food:  Their pizzas are decent, definately not the best.  Stay away from the thin crust appetizer pizzas!! The crusts were soooo thin it felt like i was eating baked crackers with pesto dip.  The pastas are mehhhh.. nothing to write home about.  I'd stick with the specialty pizzas and the appetizers.  Also, they have special deals during lunch and happy hour if u wana save a buck or 2.     The highlight of the meal was definately the pizookie!! For those pizookie virgins out there.. its basically a ginormous cookie in a mini pizza pan with 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream on top.  Get the ""black and white"" which is 1/2 chocolate chunk 1/2 white chocolate macadamia nut cookie.. yummmm :]"
David W.,"El Monte, CA",12,127,15,1.0,12/17/2007,"I came here with my staff from our Xmas party.  It was nice that they were able to accommodate 18 of us without any problems.   My order was horrible.  I ordered the grilled salmon.  I got charcoal salmon.  It was very dry as well as ashy because they had seared it beyond edibility.  Usually I love BJ's.  I love the pizookie but this place really messed up my salmon.  My brother also ordered the same dish and his was just as bad.  It was horrible.  The thing was that it was EVIDENT It was burnt and they still sent it out to us!!! 12/20/2008 I CAN""T BELIEVE I CAME BACK!!!! I got the Great White pizza and it was soggy.  My friend got the Chicken Alfredo and said it was good but somehow my food always sucks at this location!!!! I can't believe they still served crap when they could blatantly see it."
Federico M.,"Monterey Park, CA",0,9,10,1.0,5/22/2011,If I could give no stars I would. The service is pathetic. Been here a few times before and the service is always hit or miss but the last couple times it's been consistently horrible. Decided to give this place one last try. Server sat us at our table then never came back. Waited fifteen minutes and not even a drink order was taken.  Walked out and never coming back. Sad sad sad place.
Mary S.,"Carlsbad, CA",33,46,44,5.0,10/2/2008,"This Brewhouse has good food, good beer, good drinks, good pizzookies.  I have always enjoyed everything I've ordered so far... salads, sandwiches, pizza, soup, pasta, and the pizzookies are always delicious. The servers have always been kind and responsive, even during playoff times when the place is loud and busy. I don't know why everyone else seems to have a bad experience. I live in Montebello and probably eat here with my husband 2 - 3 times a month. The only other BJ's I've been to is in Burbank, so we were happy to have pizzookies close to home!"
Margaret F.,"Los Angeles, CA",644,430,74,2.0,8/31/2009,I ordered the open face meat loaf sandwich with masked potatoes and veggies. I personally love meat loaf but this one could of been better. Mind you this is the 2nd time I ordered this because i wanted to give BJ's a chance to prove themselves. Maybe i should have stuck to the pizza but I didn't. Food seems to lack flavor. Nice place to hang out but not too great for the taste buds!
Jazzy Q.,"Montebello, CA",5,9,2,5.0,3/5/2013,"right when I walked in i felt comfortable and welcomed. i was seated right away. the service was exceptional, the food was great and the staff was outstanding! Its a great place to dine for a special ocassion or just casually."
Bill E.,"Orange, CA",98,166,21,4.0,10/6/2010,I am a fan of BJ's.... their food is consistent with some good choices. I like their deep dish BBQ chicken pizza as well as their standard wedge salad. I have been to this location on several occasions and it is always quick and good.
Jocelyn O.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,245,33,3.0,2/15/2011,my experience was OKAY??? nothing special at the time i went i wasnt old enough to drink and i really wanted to try the & beer sample.
Crystal H.,"Pasadena, CA",1,20,3,3.0,6/11/2011,"It's a tap pricey and the food is sub par.  I feel BJ's has gone downhill in the last couple of years, it use to be a favorite spot for us to hang out at.  Its right next to the mall so thats pretty convenient if you want to go shopping or watch a movie.  You have to try the alfredo deep dish pizza, I ALWAYS get this when I come here."
