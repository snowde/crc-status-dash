Jennifer W.,"San Gabriel, CA",598,162,738,3.0,12/17/2015,"Came here for a work holiday lunch. Service was soso. Food definitely takes forever though. It was decent to the taste. Id come back to drink here. They have a huge selection and its nice their drinks menu has a break down of beer pairings. This review is more of a 3.5. Id give it another chance.  For food, I got the salmon quinoa bowl, cherry chipotle sauce instead of the miso glaze. Surprisingly filling! It was on the sweet end, but went really well with red pepper flakes."
Hector R.,"Whittier, CA",0,5,,1.0,8/4/2017,It was a great experience until she couldn't break a check 3 ways...thanks for having us do the math for 20 minutes
Grace C.,"Monrovia, CA",272,841,720,3.0,6/23/2016,"One of our default spots for lunch outings if 1) we can't think of where to go; 2) we don't want to go far; 3) we have a sizable group; and/or 4) we want to appeal to everyone's taste (some people consider Asian cuisine too exotic). One of the downsides is that you'll get slow service no matter what time you go. I typically order the seared ahi salad if I'm feeling in the mood for a light meal (ahi with baby field greens, napa cabbage, romaine, red bell peppers, tomatoes, avocado, pickled cucumber, cilantro, wasabi, wonton strips and green onions, tossed with rice wine vinaigrette). If not, I like their lunch flatbread and soup combo (margherita fresca and clam chowder). Plenty of mall parking. A/C tends to run cold here, so bring a sweater if you're sensitive to the cold."
Ji C.,"Tustin, CA",167,152,385,3.0,12/26/2016,"Pretty standard corporate-owned dining experience. The food is decent, ambiance is above average and service is standard. It's a good place for standard issue events like holiday dinners, get-togethers and other times when you need a safe-choice without too much risk (IE when you don't seek the adventure of an ethnic menu at a mom & pop place you've never been to). A little pricey for what you get but it's like a bond - safe."
Ricardo S.,"Central LA, Los Angeles, CA",0,3,18,2.0,2/14/2017,"I really don't understand why people go crazy for BJ's restaurant. I stopped by last Friday with my best friend, and we didn't have the best experience. It was disappointing and disheartening since he really likes this places and comes here quite often. The restaurant was clearly understaffed that night for all the people that were there. We waited for about 10 minutes, and our waitress wasn't all that friendly. Then it took her another 10 minutes to deliver the drinks after we placed our order. The food took too much time to arrive as well and yet no apologies at all. I was really hungry, so I must say that by the time my food arrived, I was really cranky and the dinner ruined. Maybe my review is biased because of it, but I really hate abnormally long wait times for service and food, and I got both."
Don C.,"Alhambra, CA",16,50,60,4.0,3/2/2017,"Considerable improvement since my first review so I have become a regular again.  I just wish they would bring back some of my discontinued favorites such as the sesame chicken salad, grilled pork chops, and mahi mahi - or any other fish than salmon! Reasonable prices, friendly and attentive service, fresh items (crisp salads), and a willingness to cheerfully make a substitution (I can have rice pilaf or baked potato in place of fries for example) make this a great place to dine!"
James K.,"Davis, CA",41,64,,1.0,9/4/2017,"All the reviews you read here about the service at this restaurant are true. The service is atrocious. I came here on a Saturday to celebrate my mom's birthday. It took ten minutes for our server to take our order for drinks. It took ten minutes for the drinks to show up. We had to place our food order with the hostess (who was extremely nice and far and away the most helpful person) since we were seated in a table near the front. Literally the hostess would be the only person we would see for large periods of time. Drink refills were few and far between and took ten minutes to get.  The food was ok. My garlic green beans did not have any garlic and were burnt. The ribs were good. My mom's ziti had several tablespoons of fat in the bottom. It's probably from the pepperoni that is in it. They don't render some of the fat out or use a leaner pepperoni so the dish was swimming in fat. Wife had the Cobb salad, which she said was decent.  After we were finished eating we asked for my mom's birthday pizookie. We waited and waited and it never showed up. Asked for the bill. Saw the free pizookie was charged to us. Had to have that taken off. The hostess helped to take the pizookie off and she brought us out a pizookie to go with an apology. Our server was slow and incompetent.  With all the negative reviews pertaining to service you would have to guess it's a systemic problem. This stuff reflects poorly on management who I would think is the real problem. Either they don't know how to train staff or they don't know how to schedule their employees (or both). It shouldn't take well over an hour and a half to eat dinner  (unless you want it to of course).  Pro tip: Don't eat here if you would like service."
Nicholas A.,"San Jose, CA",332,55,137,2.0,8/20/2016,"When attending a chain restaurant - there are two things I look for: consistent food quality and service.  Food Quality - consistent with other Bj's that I have visited through Northern and Southern California. No complaints on the deep dish or thin crust pizza that was ordered.  Quality of Service - if you made it to this point you are probably wondering ""why the 2/5 stars?"" Well the service was below any prior experiences that I have had at a Bj's. Long waits during each stage of the meal required proactive flagging down of our waiter or other staff walking by the even get the enough plates or sets of silverware on the table. Drink refills. Getting the bill. Paying for the bill. Slow. Slow. Slow. Fortunately the food came out at a good pace. Thank goodness for that!  Gonna pass next time I considering going to this Bj's location. I'll stick to others."
Antonia R.,"Oceanside, CA",33,10,,1.0,9/10/2017,"I had to ask the wAitress 2 times to bring me ranch dressing and she forgot. Then i asked her for a refill on my drink, took a while to get it. After i was done with my food she says ""u still need that ranch""! Ughh really. And to top it off the food was warm, not hot."
Carlos U.,"Monterey Park, CA",69,5,,4.0,4/22/2017,"This is the one place that the whole family can always agree on when we can't agree on anything else. The kids love the pizza but I recommend the Ribeye steak. It was super juicy and tasted fantastic. All the appetizers are great. My fave are the avocado egg rolls. And the blackened salmon is another go-to meal for me.  The place does get busy in the evenings and weekends so you can expect a wait. They have an app that you can use to get on the wait list. You can also pay your bill and you get really good discounts and offers.  Big bar, lots of TV's everywhere."
Gregory M.,"Rosemead, CA",98,23,,1.0,8/14/2017,"Ordered giant meatballs and spaghetti to go and when my daughter took a bite, she spit it out...WAY TOO MUCH WHITE PEPPER!!! Why do restaurants over season foods? This has become more common these days...why? No one here could it...had to dump it...wasted my money on that one..."
Vinh H.,"Fountain Valley, CA",13,24,30,5.0,1/15/2017,"I've been to many BJ's restaurants but this was my first time here. I saw the 3 star review and it didn't phase me because that's how big name restaurants always go.  Anyway, I ordered calamari, honey sriracha brussel sprouts, stuffed mushrooms to start. My entree was jambalaya with a side salad of tomato and mozzarella. My fiance ordered spaghetti and meatballs. I would take pics but the restaurants lighting is too dim and I'm not fond of using a flash. Now I usually order the same stuff at every BJ's and sometimes I send stuff back when it tastes terrible. Today though, every single thing we ordered was delicious! Oreo Pizookie was on point as always. Service wise, everything was great! our servers name was Stephanie. She was super nice and accommodating even to my picky nature. (I can sometimes be difficult in restaurants because I expect to get what I paid for) I recommend giving this place a shot. Ask for Stephanie for great service."
Ralph T.,"Montebello, CA",2,10,,2.0,7/7/2017,"Came for dinner with 3other friends, ordered ribs. The ribs were okay, joined the club did not receive the free desert. Will not be returning."
Mei M.,"Monterey Park, CA",750,120,3805,1.0,4/28/2016,"I was very disappointed with the service tonight. One of the reasons we decided to go to dinner there tonight and not Fri-Sun was because we thought it would be less crowded and therefore better service. While the first part was correct, the second part was not. We were promptly seated and abandoned by our server (or so it felt at least).  Our server would disappear for long periods of time. I understand (in talking to him) that 3 servers called in sick that evening. So our poor waiter was left running around covering more tables that he normally does.  We requested apple juice for my niece a few times with our main server, once from a supportive server and once from someone who seemed like a manager of some sort. We waited about twenty minutes for our main server and supportive server to bring the juice. Our main server told us once he had to go check on if and the other time he said he did put in our juice order but that juice came from the bar and they had not done it yet. I know the bar was working...as I saw plenty of patrons in the bar and surrounding tables with alcoholic drinks. Maybe our juice was made a low priority since it didn't make them as much money as the alcohol. After waiting twenty minutes with no juice we asked a manager for it and got our juice in 5 mins, right after our main server finally brought us our juice. Then we asked for soy sauce for my niece's rice, that took another 15 minutes to come up. Tonight's dinner was more waiting than eating which only took away from our family dinner experience.  In the end the short staff was paid by a flustered waiter running around and hungry people at their tables. People hungry either from waiting for her food (if they were lucky) or waiting for their server go take their order (as was a majority of the tables. It would have been nice had management had a contingency plan in place to avoid such occurrences next time so that restaurant patrons don't have to pay the price of the restaurant being short staffed. It will be a long while, if at all, before I return"
Ivan M.,"Diamond Bar, CA",371,9,1,4.0,3/13/2017,"We were seated quickly most likely because it was a monday night but the hostess was friendly! The food was good too, our salmon came out super burnt the first time but the second time it came out beautifully.  What made this visit a great one was our server, Rudy. He was super patient in helping us with our order as well as dealing with the burnt salmon issue. Rudy went above and beyond to fix our minor little situation, and when it comes to diner satisfaction, the little things count. Rudy deserves to be recognized for that. Thank you Rudy!"
Trish C.,"Los Angeles, CA",398,18,,4.0,8/26/2017,Great customer service.  I loved this place. The waitress checked on its regularly and made sure we got everything we needed. I loved the variety of drinks and the live up beat atmosphere.
Omar R.,"Whittier, CA",0,6,1,1.0,6/5/2017,Overall all I had a very bad experience at this location. Management team at the bar has very poor customer service skills. Seems like they just put anybody into management.
Brandi F.,"Fullerton, CA",217,5,,2.0,6/3/2017,"I love Bj's Brewhouse for the food but the service has never been great; tonight however it was atrocious. All I ordered tonight were 2 pizookies and not only did it take forever to come out, the cookie was not hot...I asked for water along with an order of coffee while ordering my pizookies and the pizookies came out before my water and coffee. Our waitress was named Julianna G and she was not attentive to us at all. I know it gets busy but honestly she was just so rude. Until of course she saw I was writing a review and started to become a kissass. Never coming back here and I highly suggest the same for others planning on eating here: don't."
Exie B.,"Montebello, CA",5,14,4,1.0,5/26/2017,"Terrible service during happy hour dirty tables you have to remind them to clear the tables so you can have a seat, waiters sit around by the bar talking in stead of attaining to customers the more I come here the worst the place get, this will be my last time here"
Melody T.,"Fullerton, CA",273,81,108,5.0,4/4/2016,"Its funny how all the reviews on here have comments about the horrible service when my experience was just the opposite! Came here late night after work with a girlfriend, and our server Ephraim ( pretty sure not Ethan) was really cool. He told us how to get the $10 of a $35 bill on our phone and was super upbeat and friendly the entire time.  I ordered an ahi tuna salad and told him not to include a bunch of things, as I'm a super picky eater. When I received my salad and began eating, I noticed there was still some cilantro inside. I don't know if he forgot to tell them, or they picked it out shoddily, but I absolutely can't stand the taste of even a little bit of cilantro. I didn't want to be that difficult customer, but I ended up telling him and he was super cool about it and said he would take it back and bring me something else. I really liked that he didn't make me feel guilty about being so picky or act annoyed. I then ordered the flat bread, which was pretty good !  All in all, I had a pretty good experience here, and was pleased with what I ordered as well as the service."
