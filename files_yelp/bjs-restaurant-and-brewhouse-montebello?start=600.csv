Mark C.,"Monterey Park, CA",2,352,,3.0,8/19/2012,Service was average to below. Food average. Atmosphere nice. Ordered the ribs. Sauce was too thick and sweet. Calimari good but sauces lacked. Ahi salad seemed good. Fish chips just ok. Lacked authentic British flavor. My mom had a birthday desert but the server forgot to bring any spoons. I had to go to the kitchen.
The D.,"La Habra, CA",0,11,8,1.0,3/4/2011,Normally BJ's would get a higher rating. This one has no clue what they are doing. The servers are inexperienced and my order is ALWAYS wrong!!
Amy C.,"Montebello, CA",0,9,5,1.0,2/15/2013,"Let me tell u what poor customer service this place has !!! We went there for lunch and ordered pizza which took about 45 min to come out then it didn't look cooked so I told the waitress and she responded by saying yes it is and walked away WTF!!! We tried it and of course it wasn't cooked so I made them take it back and cook it some more, our waitress didn't even apologize like it was our fault!! Long story short they made a new pizza which took another 45 min to come out so we were already full off of our Salad still no apology!! I asked to speak to a manager and when she came by I don't know who was worse her or the waitress now I know where she gets her customer skills from!!!! Lets just say that's last time I will be going there and trust me there is nothing that I am missing out on except POOR customer service skills and SLOWWWWW  service!!!!'"
Tiff L.,"Anaheim, CA",8,141,12,3.0,9/2/2010,Sampler platter was goooood.  Also had the great white and BJ's favorite pizzas.  Decent prices since it was happy hour.
George G.,"Los Angeles, CA",120,457,35,1.0,12/8/2009,"Terrible, HORRIBLE service. Food was average. Anywhere where it looks like the girl spent more time on her eye makeup than on her serving skills is always a red flag. Requests for water and drink refills were ignored repeatedly. I'm kind of disappointed by this BJ's. I've been going to these for a couple of years, and nothing I've ever been to has been THIS bad."
Howard T.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",242,323,74,3.0,5/8/2008,"Decent food, though a little on the expensive side. I'll never come here for dinner. Very loud at night and most of the beer sucks. People mainly get the Blonde or Hef. You'll get better tasting beer at the Yardhouse.  I usually go for lunch. They have a great deal on the half sandwich, fries, and a big bowl of chowder or chili for $8. Best thing on the menu...other than the ice cream and cookie....cant think of the name.  This place hasn't been opened very long so at first the servers were slow and confused. Since then, they're slower and . They still mess up orders or take your order to the wrong table. What can you do?  If you live around Montebello, then this is probably the only place to go to. Needs more improvement. **edit** went there again for lunch. service has improved greatly. bartenders are cool and take good care of you. +1"
Anthony Y.,"Rosemead, CA",372,59,4,3.0,9/9/2012,"very casual atmosphere, but the pricing was rather high. the food had a lot of variety but the food was rather average since i started to not like the food i ordered after eating a quarter of it. overall, this is the kind of place i would go to if i would just stop by and eat with friends for a short while, just think of it that way."
Christine G.,"Fremont, CA",82,24,16,2.0,7/18/2011,"I am reviewing this place because of the TERRIBLE customer service! I came here to have dinner with a couple of friends a couple days ago on my bday and so we all made our orders. The waitress seemed very impatient and unfriendly in the beginning but I just ignored it because I didnt want it to ruin the night. THEN, when it came to the bill, we wanted to pay cash, and stated how much to charge on the ATM and CLEARLY told her to charge whats left over ($32) on my BJs gift card which had $50 in it. So she comes back with just a receipt for the ATM card and just hoped we forgot about the extra money on the gift card, until i mentioned it to her. So she came back with my card that still had money in it and she totally gave me an attitude and literally threw my confirmation receipt to me. Considering that shes not doing her job accurately, and that it was my bday, maybe some common sense would help!? I love BJ's but if you want good service AVOID this spot! Her name was NAOMI!!! Very unprofessional and rude! And btw i only gave a 2nd star because I love the pizza."
DALILA L.,"South El Monte, CA",2,8,4,5.0,12/2/2010,I love this place if u go try the spicy spaghetti with shrimp its delicious. Have always received excellent service.
George K.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,20,,1.0,1/29/2013,"Bad service.  Took 20 minutes for ketchup, additional 20 to get my food re heated via microwave.  Service needs woek, spoke to manager that told me my waitress was working sick.  Yea thats somebody I want handeling my food."
Kate R.,"Alhambra, CA",3,3,,4.0,1/26/2011,"Hands down the best resturant ive ever been too, my boyfriend took me here for one of our first dates, I love the food its freakin awesome, spinach artichoke dip and chips is like fireworks in your mouth I always get chicken fetticine alfredo and my bf gets the grilled chicken pasta. This location is always packed with people on weekends but I think its worth the wait, sometimes the waiters can be rude but im guessing there just rushed and there trying to do their job quickly as possible,overall I would marry Bj's :D"
Jess R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,19,1,4.0,6/22/2010,the food here is great the drinks are good  i always get a little bit tipsy . ha!  the customer services is great  expect for this one time that the waiter was setting with us  and was hurrying us to pay so he could get his tip  and he took forever to give us our food  other then that bad experience  all the other times I've been here were great and everything was good
steve B.,"Huntington Beach, CA",104,180,2,3.0,5/12/2009,"Had Lunch with a coworker at BJ's today we only have so much time for lunch so let me state that first thing if you re in a hurry don't come here it will only piss you off, I don't expect much from franchise eateries as for the food I had their Field greens salad it was good fresh and hit the spot perfect lunch just not quick , BJ's is a great place when you have time to socialize relax drink beer so take it for what it is just don't be in a hurry! The moral of the story is eat, drink, be happy but if you're in a hurry don't come here."
Kristen V.,"Los Angeles, CA",61,73,2,4.0,11/29/2009,"I can regularly be found here at least 3 times a month. I used to frequent the Cerritos BJ's location but as soon as this one opened up, it was closer to home so I started to frequent it more often. I have never had any problem with the service, and just as any BJ's. . .the food is very tasty and the beer is even better when they haven't ran out of their seasonals!"
Shaun M.,"Benicia, CA",7,27,1,4.0,3/31/2010,"BJ's is close to my office, but I can't eat gluten, so have never tried the pizza. Went for drinks after work one Friday and was shocked to see gluten-free beer Redbridge. Then was even more shocked to see they have gluten-free pizza. It's thin crust, and personal sized, so you don't have to buy a large pizza like most other places that have g-f pizza. And, almost all of the toppings are also gluten-free (I think the only exception was meatballs). I've wrote a more extensive review on my web site, plus other gluten-free reviews, web site is in my profile)."
T Bird W.,"San Jose, CA",236,281,37,1.0,12/19/2011,"Worse customer service ever!! The server or servers ignored us the whole time, didn't bring us utensils, drinks, or even sauce we asked for. Its not like we were rude customers. Anyways I see why they have one of the lowest BJ's yelp ratings now."
cristian c.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,9,,3.0,8/20/2009,"Their food is pretty good, i think their pizza and artichoke dip is on point. The waiters and waitresses seem really occupied and always running around. The drinks are decent and the seating is fairly fast. During a Laker's game it gets packed!!!!! but yeah BJ's is pretty cool....oh one day i went out with this girl...so we went to BJ's and we were talking..she says that she thinks that place is cool. I then said ""yeah i love BJ's"" ha ha so yeah funny moment there mates!"
Maritza C.,"Montebello, CA",21,32,,3.0,3/22/2009,I love the Root Beer.  The service is fine and they are friendly but the food is just ok.  The food is average and nothing too memorable.  The Chinese Chicken salad is a good choice or a chicken sandwich.
Brandon B.,"Carson, CA",0,11,,2.0,7/31/2012,"I come here around 2-4 times a month ( not my choice) and they have some okay service but today was the worst.   We get here at lunch time and the place is a bit empty and we are seated right away.  From he time we sat took literally about 10-15 mins Neil a server approached. For drinks. I gave her drink orders and also my sons order because he as hungry. Roughly 5-10 mins later we got our drinks. So we then gave our order and she takes off. For almost 20 mins e don't see our ever and the hostess came over to get refills for us.  About 10 mns after our server stops by and asks for refills. She takes off and another server delivers our appetizers. I get my soup and ask for crackers. 1 soup down nothing, they co,e out and ask if I want more soup and I said yes and still no crackers. Our server appears with a spoon....why I don't know, she leaves they bring me my crackers, then the soup is delivered. At that time another server brings ur food. We eat, our server reappears, and asks for refills and take ps off. Well you know what, his just repeats n and on until we just to up and started walking out. For an empty restaurant the service was horrible."
Kenneth S.,"Rosemead, CA",18,185,239,3.0,4/14/2011,came here one time for their pizza and it was too pricey compared to other authentic pizza places. it was good though.
