Rosa C.,"El Monte, CA",2,3,,1.0,8/23/2010,My first time and last coming here the worst service you could ever have..Not recommended I rather go eat at a fast food place better service and you sure would get your food quicker...They just seem to be all lost.
Lilly N.,"Los Angeles, CA",48,218,42,4.0,9/17/2009,Love their food.. always comes out perfect.. I ordered to go perfect service nice friendly.. everything was good. if they were to mess up my order or what not they would give me a free drink.. pretty cool
Eric S.,"Montebello, CA",21,73,110,4.0,11/15/2011,"ive always been a fan of BJs. its a decently sized place within the montebello mall. the service is attentive, and there is a moderately sized bar area where there are plenty of TVs for sports fans. its a great place."
Kyle T.,"Los Angeles, CA",13,33,1,2.0,12/15/2009,"So me and my girl got the ""california burger"" w/ the BJ special bread. Guess what? it was probably the most mediocre burger i have ever had. You know it is below average when they do not ask you ""how would you liked it cooked?"" anyway we also ordered with their thin cut french fries along w the potatoe wedges. These two set of fries tasted exactly like potatoes, no seasoning, nothing, very bland. So for the burgers and fries, do not get. The highlight was the plain ice tea, yeah thats how bad it was."
Richard M.,"Montebello, CA",0,2,,5.0,6/14/2010,Great place to go had a lot of fun last friday. Good food and great drinks what u know about the nit-wit mmmmmm bomb-e
Nik N.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,134,48,1.0,1/2/2010,The service is good but the food is way too salty!  We had the bj's favorite and the buffalo chicken pizza and the clam chowder..that's 3 out of 3 tries and they were all a salty experience.  :(
Carina K.,"Arcadia, CA",0,1,,2.0,2/28/2012,"This Bj's is definitely one of the worst I've ever been to. First off the service is hit or miss. I've had terrible service as in the waiter drops off the food and never checks back to refills our drinks, to very attentive friendly waiters. But the biggest issue for me is the quality of food.  First off it seems that every time I go there's always something that goes wrong with my order. Every time I go I expect for my order to be screwed up. It falls in between asking for a side of Ranch Dressing multiple times, which isn't really a big deal, to them not topping an order of nachos with chili, the bottom of the plate was covered with it. When I flagged down a waiter and asked if that there was supposed to be more chilli the waiter with a straight faced confirmed that yes, that is how the dish is served and walked away without offering anymore assistance. Obviously, chili goes on top of the nachos, a fact they overlooked somehow. For a restaurant known for its pizza they served a Great White with marinara sauce and not white sauce. It wasn't until later that I realized what was wrong with that pizza.  For some reason the food seems off. I don't know if its the inexperience kitchen staff or what but the taste of the food is different then from others I've been too.  Due to these reasons and examples I have since refused to go to that Bj's. It has been a constant stream of mistakes that they don't catch or refuse to correct. It had gotten to the point where when I went I expected something to go wrong. Don't mistaken me, I have gone to other Bj's and have had the complete opposite experience. Maybe with time, and better management, this place will get better."
Bryant T.,"Monterey Park, CA",674,19,365,1.0,7/15/2011,"Many reasons why i dislike this location.  1. I came on monday 7/11/11 and was turned away my i assume the manager because he was in a dress shirt telling me they had to  close early because of an emergency, i look inside, PEOPLE WERE IN THERE EATING! if it was an emergency, wouldn't they have gotten people out? or at least offer me something like even a 1% off my next bill for my waste of time driving there? he didn't even say it all that nice either 2. so i decided to come back here yesterday night on wednesday 7/13/11 because i was still craving for the food and i had a card that gives me a free pazooki with a purchase of an entree. so i gave it to our server and she was okay with it. then comes back THE SAME MANAGER that turned us away on monday, came to our table and stated in a rude manner ""we cannot give you the pazooki, the card expired already"" and while he was saying that, he was already turning his back on us and walked off. did not even ask us if we still want to order it or anything else for desert. I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THIS GUY GET FIRED for his terrible and rude customer service."
Megan J.,"Alhambra, CA",0,71,,4.0,6/2/2011,"This location is much less crowded than Puente Hills or West Covina, which automatically gives it an edge.  I haven't tried too much off the menu, but the handful of things that I do order (grilled chicken pasta, crispy chicken sandwich, baked potato...) are always really good.  I know everyone loves the Pizookies, but to be honest, I'm not really a fan.  Somehow I feel like the cookie dough is not entirely cooked.  It feels like I'm eating really hot raw cookie dough.  Which might be good for those raw cookie dough fans out there.  Overall it's a fun place to gather with a big group of hungry people."
Jose C.,"Downey, CA",20,64,,3.0,2/3/2011,"I have mixed feelings about this place. The service has been either super outstanding or really bad! During the lunch hour it has been really bad, but for after hours dinner or birthday celebrations the services has been really good. The assistant manager is super sweet and very nice! She made sure we got our food and service as quickly as possible. The food is good and the drinks are also good but I think because it is at a mall they are not as stiff or strong as they could be! It is a good place to eat if you have the patience and time to wait for your food! The waiters are cute and the waitresses are sexy as well. Nice place but I had better! Of course pizza is the best!"
Ron M.,"Montebello, CA",66,240,13,2.0,5/5/2008,"I thought BJ's used to be a restaurant first and a bar second. Now it seems like it is a bar first and a restaurant second. The food here taste like it has been sitting under a heat lamp all day, the floors are dirty and tables take forever to get cleaned off. The service suck, except for the few servers that actually care about their job. Sad to say, but I will probably be back. I am sucker for a couple of pictures of Heff or blonde."
Marien P.,"Los Angeles, CA",13,36,7,2.0,12/3/2008,I go to BJ's because it is a 5 minute drive & the Pizzookie is the best! But the service is horrible!!!!! I have been there 5 times & every single time the service  is awful. I get seated rather quickly but to order drinks & food you literally have to flag someone down. The servers always seem to be preoccupied or just to busy to give you good service. I would give them a 5 star rating on food & drinks but the service SUCKS!
Andy s.,"Los Angeles, CA",246,32,,4.0,2/16/2011,Jeremiah Red makes me happy. But when fall rolls around be sure to have a Pumpkin spice brew with a pizookie. you wont regret it!
Chili L.,"San Marino, CA",128,183,16,1.0,12/18/2007,WTF? a BJ's at the ghetto mall this is a all time low!! whats next a Nordstrom?
Gabriella P.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,31,3,5.0,6/4/2009,"One night I was visiting my sister (who lives 5 minutes away from a BJs) and all of a sudden I was craving a Pizzookie.  It was already 11PM and was almost dissapointed because I thought they were closed however, I went online and checked what time they were open til (thank god for technology!) and saw that they were still open for another hour.  I went ahead and gave them a call to place my to-go order.  Anyway...who gives about my story so here is my actual review: I went to pick up my pizzookie from the bar and the bartendar was nice enough to offer me a drink while I was waiting ( i ordered an iced tea to-go too) so I just asked for my drink and he gave me one in a glass cup and then gave me my to-go iced tea when I left too.   So 5-stars for their great service and yummy pizzookie.  Most places start giving you attitude because you come in last minute and they are about to close...but this place was friendly about it!"
Quinn M.,"Long Beach, CA",38,192,2,1.0,7/10/2008,"This is an awful BJ's!  We went for late lunch (2 pm) on a Wednesday.  Sure, we didn't have to wait for a table since the place was nearly empty.  But the service was horrendous!  Our server announced from the beginning that he was new and his trainer would be watching to make sure he didn't mess up.  I want to know what in the world was wrong with his trainer then because they were BOTH AWFUL! Offenses committed by new guy and his trainer: 1. Assuring us the appetizer would be ""right out"" and then us waiting 15 minutes.  2. Not bringing plates or napkins for the appetizer.   3. Not bringing utensils for the salads. 4. Handing us our utensils FROM BEHIND US OVER A COUNTER BECAUSE HE WAS TOO LAZY TO WALK AROUND! 5. Forcing us to demand refills instead of noticing our loud straw slurpy noises when we were done 6. Leaving empty cups and plates on the table when bringing refills 7. Forcing us to tell him we were out of room and that he needed to take the empty stuff away. 8. Taking frickin' forever to bring things we asked for; it was later determined that his slowness was because he refused to take a trip out of the kitchen until he had supplied the requests of all three tables he was waiting.  So if you were the first person to ask, you had to wait until the other two tables wanted something for him to go get it. 9. Placing our drinks at the far end of the table, forcing us to pass them to the appropriate people (this was the trainer and this was done with cold calculation as she did not even lift her eyes). 10. Not remembering that my friend didn't want croutons. 11.  Rounding the credit card split charges to the nearest dollar, resulting in one person from our party paying less than the other two. WHAT THE HELL?  I have been to other BJ's locations during the evening rush and had really good service.  This place is just awful.  And since this guy was terrible under the direction of a so-called trainer, you can rest assured that future generations of servers at this location will be learning the wrong way to do their jobs."
vivian G.,"Whittier, CA",53,2,2,1.0,3/14/2011,customer service sucks! the waitress was rude it took forever to get my food and when i finally got it i was wrong and on top of that when i askd to speak to a manager it took about 15min to get a hold of 1....i am officially never going back its a waste of time since they take for ever and a waste of money!!!!!!
James R.,"Long Beach, CA",0,7,,2.0,9/3/2008,"There is nothing to complain about the food or drinks served as they were actually pretty good. We had a departmental lunch party of 12 a while back, and needless to say from the other posting, the service is horrendous. We had to wait about 45 minutes before we were seated. The team was pretty much standing around the whole time as there were not enough seats for them. The only form of entertainment we had during that time were our conversations, the menu, and one of the BJ's employee who was pushing water out of the center of the waiting area with a big squeegee as it was raining pretty hard that day. We were planning on having a team luncheon that would last for about an hour or an hour and a half as some of us had meetings to attend to. So after we get our food, I pretty much had to wolf down my lunch so I could make my scheduled meeting which I had to reschedule by 30 minutes. Luckily, no one was upset. So bottom line, the food and drinks are good, but the service needs much improvement, especially for company team meetings."
michael t.,"San Gabriel, CA",4,22,,1.0,3/26/2008,"I don't even want to give this place a one star.  They deserve a .000001 star for just being open and employing idiots so that they aren't working at my other favorite restaurants.  I have been twice and will never be going back, except to use my free $50.00 ""courtesy card"" that they tried to buy me off with that wasn't offered by the manager but instead when I had to waste more of my time to call corporate.  The Manager there, Jay Kim was a total idiot and certainly not helpful at all.  We were ignored by the service team for about 15 minutes after we sat down and were only helped by a server who was on her way out the door and noticed us sitting there like idiots.  I then didn't receive my condiments for my pasta and pizza dish that my wife and I ordered for at least 10 minutes after the food arrived and by that time it was cold.  BRRRRRR!!!!!!!!     I asked for the manager and there was not even an apology offered which was all we wanted.  SOME ACKNOWLEDGMENT!!!!!   He couldn't even do that, instead he said, ""my server didn't apologize?""  I was then super pissed and replied with, ""no i meant an apology from you, the manager"" Very Long Story short...........I will not go back and I completely hate the service there and the management team for wasting my money and time."
