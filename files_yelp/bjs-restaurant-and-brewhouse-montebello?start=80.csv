Marina P.,"Montebello, CA",101,2,,1.0,6/7/2017,"This is the shittiest BJ's. The place is always over populated with rude ass people and the servers are the worst. I used to love coming here but since has been run down. The food is great YES, the beer is good,YES. But that's BJ's. Go to ANY BJ's for the taste: this location in particular needs work on its service for sure. The staff has such a bad attitudes. Maybe it's having to serve the lame ass clientele this location attracts. ‍"
Sylvia M.,"Alhambra, CA",0,6,1,1.0,5/18/2017,"This is a horrible place for dinner...it's so loud, you can't hear the person you're having dinner with!  This place was so loud, there were people having dinner and the fool was offering his little kid some Here!  Where's the manager??"
Karina R.,"El Monte, CA",0,3,,3.0,8/5/2017,"Didn't have to wait for a table, which was good. Food we order to eat was fast and great. Our server BIANCA was doing good until the end. I decide to order to go but took too long of a wait and when the food came out a bag was not offer to us. The box was hot at the time and we had one left over box. To charge us she forgot the little black book, which she warn me she will bring it but had to wait for it. We felt like toward the end she forgot about us. Food was great But the service we got from her was slow."
Fiona C.,"Rosemead, CA",147,15,10,1.0,3/31/2017,"Racist as fuck.  Came in tonight and they told us it's a 25 minute wait but we ended up waiting an hour before we got seated. After leaving us with the menu, nothing. Ignored us the entire time. I tried to wave a waitress down and she saw me but just stood there and ignored me. A lot of them were just standing around doing nothing but they just ignored us the entire time. We decided to just get up and leave and they didn't even bat an eyelash. They just looked as us while we walked out. 99% of their customers are probably Hispanic. Don't come in if you're asian."
Charlie A.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,19,9,1.0,11/15/2016,"I don't even know where to start with this review. First off today is a Tuesday (11/16/2016) the restaurant wasn't that packed so the service shouldn't have been as horrible as it was. My family and I walked in close to 6pm. We got seated and a couple mins later the waiter came and took our drink & appetizer order. We were off to a good start or so we thought. The drinks arrived and the waiter took our entree order. 15 mins later and still no sign of the appetizer or the waiter. Our entrees arrived but they forget my son's plate, we remind the waiter about my son's order and we tell him we no longer wanted the appetizer since it arrived late but he comes back and tells us it's on house (great right?). At this point the service still sucks since the waiter hasn't even offered refills on any of the drink orders, my husband calls the waiter and asked him for refills. Waiter comes back and this is where it all went to shit. I ordered an ice tea, it arrived and I start to drink it but my straw isn't picking up any tea, so I decide to stir it and that's when I see a big nasty glob of slime! If you have ever seen what placenta looks like picture that in your ice tea! That's what the glob looked like. We were so disgusted and puzzled as to what the f*%# this slimy glob was that we didn't take a picture. My husband calls the waiter and asked the waiter what the f*%# that is. The waiter is even more confused and disgusted than we are! He takes the ice tea and says he will find out. He comes back and couldn't tell us what it was but he apologized and said it was going to be taken off the bill! Ummm sorry but NO! You would think the manager would come and apologize and try to make things better. At this point I couldn't even finish the rest of my food. We had to call the manager over he gave a lame apology and couldn't even explain to us what the protocol was when something like this happens. I'm sorry but if it would of been a fly or even a roach in the ice tea at least we would of known what it was but the fact that this slimy glob was in the drink and no one could identify it is utterly disgusting and unacceptable. The meal was comped and we filed an incident report but I rather had paid and not had to deal with this. Never going back again. *Update it's been a MONTH and no one from Bj's has contacted me and that's okay I posted this all over social media and none of my friends & family will ever be stepping foot at any BJ's location. The lack of urgency goes to show what they think about their customers. Thanks Bj's!!!"
Lynda R.,"Covina, CA",12,16,1,1.0,4/10/2017,Probably one of my worst experiences at Bjs thanks to your server Patrick. Had to constantly ask him for lemons which we never received and food was brought out so late it was cold. It was also my friends bday and he never got his birthday pazookie after Patrick asked him what kind. Did not care to wait. Getting the bill was a hassle as well.  I like coming to this bjs and it sucks that I have to go somewhere else and spend my money for now on.
DrewsMom p.,"San Gabriel, CA",9,41,4,1.0,4/23/2017,"Terrible service tonight. We were here for over two hours what a waste. Drinks took forever. Food took forever. No one ever commented about how Long things were taking. No apologies, nothing. My husbands order was wrong. He ate three bites waitress never questioned why his food wasn't eaten when we questioned his order, she just said that's what he ordered and moved on. Paid way too much for a wrong dinner taking way too long. Wrote comments on the back of my receipt with my email address. Wonder if anyone will even reach out. We will never go here again."
Aaron A.,"Downey, CA",17,18,1,1.0,4/3/2017,Was there this past saturday. Horrible customer service. The server couldn't find my assigned table because of the overlapping shift. Not once did she come by to offer us a refill or anything... we had to ask the buzz boy for water ketchup etc. I'd rather take my business elsewhere. I'd grade this as a negative ten!!!
Jessica A.,"Alhambra, CA",8,144,44,1.0,9/4/2017,"I wish I could give more, but I cant.  We decided to eat here because I have some dietary restrictions.  I remember seeing an seared ahi salad on the menu so I knew that is what I was going to order.  When we got there it was not busy and we were able to sit right away.  The server came and greeted us.  We asked for some water and I ordered the ahi salad right away.  When I got the salad, I was a bit disappointed when I saw the tuna.  The knife was not sharp at all, It looked like it got cut with a butter knife or a hacksaw.  I couldn't eat most of tuna had so much sinew.  I also noticed there wasn't any avocado on it and I asked the server if it came with avocado, and she said no. When I was getting towards the bottom of the salad, I noticed that there was so much dressing it looked like soup.  The friend I was with ordered a burger with a beer.  We had to flag down the server to ask for another one (isn't it the servers job to make sure to ask).  My friend was not fully done with his burger when the server dropped the check.  I looked at her and said that we haven't gotten his beer that we ordered and that my friend was still eating.  She didn't seem to be concerned or care at all that she made us feel rushed.  Again, it was not busy at all.  Im not sure who told her it was proper to drop off a check when someone is still eating and waiting for another beer.  With this said, I don't think I will be eating at bjs anytime soon."
Lindsey N.,"Fairfield, CA",74,20,1,1.0,4/9/2017,We were told that our wait would be 15 minutes and that they would text when our table was ready. Thirty minutes roll by and we went to check up on the status of our wait and they had 'forgot to text us'
A S.,"Walnut, CA",386,47,26,2.0,6/25/2017,"The food is mediocre and so is the service. The staff do not appear attentive. I understand it gets busy sometimes and it's difficult to keep up, but please actually make a genuine effort to be courteous."
Michael B.,"Simi Valley, CA",1,36,3,2.0,4/6/2017,"Not the best experience here folks. Poor service. Terribly long wait for drinks and food. Made me late getting back to work for lunch. When food did finally arrive, it was garbage. Very disappointed for a BJ's. Maybe dinner time is better. I gave it two stars because the server tried to deliver, he just couldn't."
Jasmin C.,"Whittier, CA",3,12,3,4.0,2/23/2017,"Came for lunch , it was super busy but we had an awesome waiter Nicko which made the waiting experience not so bad . He was attentive and sincere about us having to wait so long . Food was delicious."
Audrey L.,"Covina, CA",147,3,,5.0,7/3/2017,I came here last night with my husband and had a great experience the food was very yummy but best of all the service was great our serve Steven Corona was soo friendly and helpful!!! I uploaded the Bjs app and got a free bazookie!!! We are eating healthy so we opt for healthier choices my husband got the Quinoa and chicken and I had the Barbacoa chicken with feta cheese and Greek yogurt and black beans only 560 cal so yummy!!! Highly recommend this dish and that server Steven Corona!!!
Mimi T.,"Temple City, CA",55,3,,1.0,10/8/2016,"Food was good! Service was horrible, horrible!!! Waitress Jessica C. was very unprofessional, unfriendly and rude!!  We were there for lunch for the fact of Free Pizookie, we weren't offered until we asked for it, and Jessica was giving us attitude like we were there for free food!   We paid for our lunch!!! Jessica brought us the Pizookie and dropped it on the table, not a word of ENJOY or SORRY...She needs to be taught of basic manner before being a waitress.   I like BJs, but i would never go back to this location again."
Ojitos S.,"Los Angeles, CA",804,44,226,1.0,1/30/2017,"I honestly stopped going to BJ's when they got rid of their meatloaf which was the best ever! Last night we went to the one in Montebello since we were close by with friends. We sat in the bar area in a booth and we ordered our drinks and the waitress comes back to take our order which was 2 calmari, hot wings and small ribs. The server brings one order of calmari. A few minutes brings the ribs then my boyfriends gets up to find the waitress and oops she only got one order after we repeated the order smh then the server brings the hot wings which was supposed to be an order of 10 and there was 8 1/2 .... really! So my boyfriend calls the waitress to show her there is only 9 and a 1/2 of another and she picks up the plate and says I will get you another one with no apology. Then they bring the calamari she forgot and minutes later the wings so by then we were eating cold calamari smh I was irritated and hungry so we just ate. From the time they brought our first plate to the last was almost 20 min! When you order together they should bring the food at the same time. This was my worst experience ever at any BJ's and I would have called the manager to complain but we were running late for a concert in Anaheim. Great wings and cold calamari! I definitely will not return to this BJ's the service was bad and the worst part is that I did not get her name."
Krystal Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",73,40,,1.0,8/5/2016,"I've been to bjs several times when it first opened and thought I'd go again for lunch with some family, bad call. We were seated and I though all was well when we received our drinks. .. it wasn't till it came to the food. Our orders were wrong, it took forever for them to be corrected, it took 30minutes for ranch and we waited so long for the check we had to demand it from the hostess because any other waiter we encountered were just ignoring us!  I'm pretty understanding when it comes to food service because I've worked as both server and hostess, but when your rude, slow and the restaurant is slow... What is your excuse?!"
Bai C.,"El Monte, CA",0,1,,1.0,8/18/2017,"This restaurant doesn't even deserve one star. Servers are rude. The people cleaning start cleaning and picking up items while people are still eating at the table.They tend to make a lot of mistakes when it comes to the food. I've been here about 12 times this year and the service is always horrible. I try coming here with an open mind and I try to take a lot into consideration. At this point management here needs to get it together the waitresses need to be better prepared. And for the people cleaning they should get some manners. Don't come here, go to Arcadia instead!"
Lucia P.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",195,2,,5.0,7/1/2017,"Steven C. was such a pleasure to have as a server. He was very attentive, very friendly and overall just knew how to do his job correctly. We'll definitely be coming back. And Steven if you're reading this, awesome job!"
A M.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,39,3,1.0,9/2/2017,Worst customer service.  Im at my lunch and I'm at the takeout  station.  A worker says that someone will be right with me.  Workers keep passing me by and no one comes to take my order. 20m waisted in waiting and no one is coming. #getittogetjerbjs never coming here for lunch.
