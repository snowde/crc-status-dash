Jason M.,"Riverside, CA",43,52,39,4.0,12/17/2017,"The server was excellent.  A little too much, over the top friendly.  It was appreciated though. I ordered the tomato basil bowl of soup.  The portion was terribly small.  It was presented in a flat bowl.  It was almost a plate.  The volume was the same as a cup. Pay less and just buy the cup of soup.  The soup was tasty but they over charge already for soup and then are very Stingy on the portions. The meat balls we ok, also only a few small meatballs.   You can go to Yard House or several other places in the area and get equal taste and larger portions."
Samantha V.,"Fontana, CA",2,22,59,3.0,1/6/2018,"Long story short:  We paid $60 to wait a long time to eat good food at a claustrophobic table in an establishment with enough drama to be a high school.  All of the food we ordered was really good (which is the only reason I gave 3 stars) The tomato & mozzarella salad was refreshing, the wings were nice and crispy (could've used a bit more sauce), and we both very much enjoyed the dishes we ordered.  Short story long:  My experience here was mediocre at best. The food was really good, but the atmosphere & flow of the restaurant really ruined the experience for me.  We were a party of 2 and seated in a mini booth. Our drink orders were taken promptly, Diet coke & water, and we also ordered the buffalo wings appetizer. Our drinks took quite a while to get to us. Once we got our beverages we asked for more time to look over the large menu. About 10 minutes later we ordered the rest of our food: a stater salad, spaghetti & meatballs & lemon thyme chicken. Our server informed us that the wings app should be right out.... about 15 minutes later A different server brings us the wings & starter salad & literally walking right behind her was another server with our 2 meals. I have no idea where our original waitress was?  So picture this, a couple at a mini/half booth with a drink each, a long rectangular plate with wings, celery & ranch, 2 small plates to eat the app on, a salad plate & our 2 meals! We had to play Tetris to attempt to fit everything on our Table! So my boyfriend decides to try to scarf his salad down to make us some room. We then put the salad plate under the plate of wings so we could have some room. All of a sudden our original waitress comes and goes to grab the stacked plates, which makes sense if the plates were stacked & empty, but we still had 4 wings left and 6 celery sticks. The only reason these plates are stacked is so we don't have to eat our actual meals on our laps! So I tell her ""  We're still working on the wings, we just didn't have room for everything"". So instead of taking the empty plate under it and the small plates with bones of the wings we had eaten, she sets the stack back down and leaves.    So now we're eating our meals & we overhear a different waitress exclaim to a busboy "" I'm going to the back, I don't want to see him!"" And she walks away. Now the busboy is swearing "" F this & F that"" and he's getting all riled up. At this point I ask for some boxes and the check and we leave in a hurry."
Sydney M.,"Riverside, CA",64,3,,1.0,10/26/2017,"Update: I received a message from someone at BJ's Restaurants. She gave me her direct e-mail and phone number. The e-mail bounced back, and the number was constantly busy or just rang. Still not going back to this location.  I went out for dinner with a friend, it was a Saturday night and very busy, so I expected the service was going to be affected. However, after a series of events that could have been avoided, I've decided to never return to this location.  1. Server spilled an entire tray of beer on me (3-4 ice cold bottles of beer). 2. When she realized what she had done, she ran away to go on break and never returned. 3. It took 10 minutes to get the attention of anyone.  4. A bus boy brought over more cloth napkins (that honestly do nothing to soak up any amount of liquid) and literally stood there staring at me, doing nothing until I told him I needed the puddle in my seat mopped up.  5. The manager never told us who he was, he just stood at our table making awkward conversation, reassuring me that the server was going to be okay, it's just embarrassing to spill orders, while I was standing there dripping. 6. It took over an hour to see our waitress again because, ""I saw you talking to my manager and I thought you were upset with the service, so I didn't want to come back to your table.""  All in all, a very poor dining experience. I've eaten at this location before and had some troubles with servers taking a long time to take orders, or basically just dropping orders and then disappearing until its time for the check. But this experience was the last straw. Just a warning to anyone in Moreno Valley who wants pizza and beer AND good service, go somewhere else."
Kevin B.,"Westminster, CA",153,73,93,5.0,12/20/2017,"had to come here with da boys one night. Once we got there, it was a long wait..probably about an hour, so they gave us pizza samples in the meantime (thank goodness bc i was starving). Once we were about to get a booth, we ordered immediately since we were friggen hungry. The ribs were bomb, potatoes, clam chowderrrr, etcc etcc. I also got some moscow mule and it was super refreshing. Like words on this review cant show what my expression was like when i was eating, but it was sure dam gud. come here if yall want some typical american food and dranks!"
K M.,"Whittier, CA",10,68,48,4.0,11/15/2017,"This is one of my usual spots. I ordered the avocado egg rolls & they were super spicy. So they brought me the spinach dip, which was good.  I also ordered the sweet pig mini pizza & u can't go wrong with their pizzas. I also like the 5 meat, bbq chicken, & great white pizza!!!!  We also had some calamari which was good. And of course, I finished off my meal with a mini cookies & cream pizookie!!!!!"
Esmeralda H.,"Riverside, CA",0,11,3,3.0,12/26/2017,"I have tired this place several times and always leave disappointed. I say disappointed because the food is good, however the service is mediocre and wait times are long. I am willing to wait and pay and tip if I feel like they are Interested in their guests.We are only a party of 2 and it took us about 10 minutes to even get acknowledged and get a water to drink. Next, we ordered drinks and then our menus were taken away. We didn't order yet. We also asked to have the tv to be changed to a specific game and the waitress explained that the manger was busy and wasn't able to get to the remote. Which is acceptable...however, if you want me to come back please acknowledge that exist and possibly check how my food if i need anything. That's called good customer service."
Exquiste M.,"Los Angeles, CA",183,19,14,1.0,12/16/2017,My first big outing after being in a major car accident and I ended up leaving this establishment Hungry. Could not eat with my daughter on her birthday because everything was cooked with latex and management refused to let the cooks make my food w/o the gloves. I was told it was California state law to cook with latex gloves. My family is eating there and I had to walk over to Olive Garden to eat there instead by myself. My daughters wish for her birthday was ruined
Melissa V.,"Moreno Valley, CA",152,134,112,5.0,10/20/2017,"Great service.  We recently went for my dad's birthday, and the service was great. I called ahead of time with some questions, and everything was answered and our visit went smoothly. I will return!"
Sal L.,"San Diego, CA",242,12,4,5.0,11/9/2017,"We had a birthday party of 12 and were taken care of by Nancy. Even though it was super busy, we all got taken care of quickly and treated tremendously well! The managers Mark and Sara came over and made sure we loved our food and we had everything we needed. They even treated us to a complimentary birthday pizookie! I will definitely recommend this place to all my friends and will be back for our next celebration!"
Troy S.,"San Diego, CA",350,73,105,4.0,10/13/2017,BJs is one of my favorite places even though it's a chain.  They always have a good selection of beer and their brews are delicious. Customer service rocks always leaving you with a good feeling for what you paid for...check out their happy hour...$4.00 pints!
Karl H.,"Wilmington, CA",23,7,,1.0,10/13/2017,"Well. I am not a fan.  Was craving prime rib. Bj's had a prime rib special going. They advertise in the menu a 15oz cut cooked to perfection. This is not true. It was more like a 12 oz cut and it was not seasoned whatsoever. The salad came first and not 2 bites into the salad my prime rib came. I said it was too fast and they offered to take the roast and keep it under the warmer. Which would have cooked it more and dried it out so i said no. The prime rib was cold and was kind of choppy the way it was cut. It was not a desirable cut of meat.   The server was a female. Her name was michelle and she was ok. But was over swamped with a table of 8 and mine and another table of two so i kinda got lost in the shuffle.  I was done eating and got my dessert included in the price, and it was good but too hard to eat.  It was the piezookie cookie, I didn't like the way they served it. Got cold too fast and the cookie stuck to the metal dish and was very hard to eat.  After dessert i waited about 15 minutes before i got my bill and then another 15 to get it back with my credit card.  Overall the meal was not worth the $27.00 they charge for it not to be cooked right and the right weight/size. The turn around time from salad to entree was way too fast and the long wait for the bill and return was kind of upsetting.  I will not come back unless bj's makes an appeal for me to do so. Not happy. Sorry not sorry."
Josie L.,"Arcadia, CA",466,77,74,1.0,11/30/2017,"When we first got here it was packed, which is understandable on a night with many football games but when we were seated we were asked to moved and offered a free appetizer after we already ordered. When we were moved to a booth, no one took our order for the ""free appetizer"" and no one came to ask if we were okay or needed a refill. We sat for a good 15 minutes after our meal was finished and no one came by to clean the plates or offer the bill. And we were ignored for the night since we sat in a booth all the way in the back. Servers walked by as if we were invisible. Thanks BJ I did not enjoy my visit and I am still waiting to be served as I write this review."
Sarina L.,"Riverside, CA",468,173,233,3.0,12/12/2016,"This review is for this location specifically. I love BJ's wide menu choice and it usually comes out pretty good. Their service is not too great though. I've been to this location multiple times to dine in and to have take out as well. From my dine in experiences, the waiter/waitresses are usually really nice and happy to help out. They are also really busy helping multiple tables so sometimes it is hard to flag them down. The food always takes forever to come out. I don't mind that too much as my friends and I usually have good conversations while we're waiting and I also know that they're taking their time to make it if it takes that long. In a few instances, we've had mistakes in the orders where they forget to mention to the cook about a change or overall did not enter an order into the system.  In my take out instance, it took a while before someone can help us with our order. When they did, they apologized for the wait time and took our order. The food took even longer to come out. I would say I was there for almost 1.5 hours waiting for my food, to go. I might as well dined in at that point. Though the staff was apologetic of the wait, I think there might need ot be a better system implemented to prevent this long wait time, especially for to-go orders. Food: Their pizzas are always a good thing to order, deep dish or flat bread. I had their avocado eggrolls, perfect if you're an avocado enthusiast like I am. Pizookies are always amazing, if you're feeling full but want to squeeze in a pizookie, you can order a mini (even though that option is not on the menu, just ask!) I'll still be coming in to eat here as I like their huge options and of course the pizookies. If you do come here, just make sure you're not on a time crunch because the wait will take awhile!"
TV Installation I.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",66,54,66,4.0,11/8/2017,This place is Class Act... Wanted to give this place Five Stars however it took a decent amount of time to get our final check over 30 minutes to be exact. However this service was superb! Elias was our server is a tremendous guy very friendly. Went here to celebrate a birthday and it is a very clean place to do so. I can understand why the reviews weren't tremendously great in this place however our experience was decent! We basically just came here for a few drinks dessert and appetizer. I have the snake bite paired with the calamari... The trick is to put a lot of lemon on it that way you don't taste as much as the seafood flavor to the calamari overall it was flavorful
Kathy Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,2,4.0,1/1/2018,"Although there was a really rude party next to us, and gave our waiter a tough time. He did everything to make sure we had a great experience. Sadly I didn't get his name but the receipt says ""mark g"" so I hope that was him"
Steven F.,"Sun City, Menifee, CA",13,5,1,2.0,10/19/2017,"I walk in, The BJ's people were very nice I told him I would like a steak. they said they had two kinds of steak so I ordered the house steak. I was very disappointed when it showed up in front of me and the steak was the same size as the little cup  that they bring your butter in for your baked potato. I'm not joking. I would be very embarrassed to serve this to a customer. I don't think I'll be going back there anytime soon not for those kind of prices"
Owen H.,"Los Angeles, CA",362,163,405,3.0,2/18/2017,"Pizookie tho.... The pizza here is actually really good with pretty cheap prices. A huge restaurant making it easy for large parties to come. - 5 stars UPDATE: so i ordered a pizza with my friend and it took an hour for it to get done. we were told ""5 more minutes, we didn't forget"" for 30 minutes straight and it still didn't come... An hour later they came and told us they were out of the kind we ordered. i would say never coming back however the pizza here is pretty good. they gave us complementary (i hope) lemonades while we waited for our food and that was nice. - 2 stars...."
Mandisa M.,"Riverside, CA",82,1,,5.0,12/5/2017,Daniel was amazing.  This will be the Bj's my boyfriend and I come to from now on. Hands down the best customer service we have experienced in a while.  Thank you Daniel very much.
Morgan L.,"Los Angeles, CA",649,31,6,5.0,2/14/2017,I'm here right now at BJs & as soon as I walked in the host had a very unpleasant welcoming face I almost turn around & left but I'm glad I didn't because my waiter Sasha she's pregnant with her baby reemy was awesome . She's sweet with great energy & full of life . Thank u Sasha for giving me a great experience at BJs :)   PS .. new host is needed her face expressions are not welcoming I almost left after seeing her face .
Angelica S.,"Anaheim, CA",180,23,1,5.0,11/18/2017,"Jessica did a great job as did the chef; the food and service was great as always. It was a little busy but I never waited for refills, food, or for service. I will definitely be coming back soon"
Amber R.,"Moreno Valley, CA",37,5,,5.0,9/22/2017,Honestly the food is always good  But service was EXCELLENT  Or servers name was Daniel excellent  Always came to check on us made sure or food was great  Just incredible service  Would recommend!
Manpreet R.,"Riverside, CA",16,106,374,5.0,8/1/2017,"This is our local go to restaurant. My fiancé, cousins, nephews, girlfriends and I know we can count on great service and consistently good food at this location! Not to mention we love their app and goodies! Absolutely love the pink Cadillac martini! My fiancé is a crafty guy so he usually sticks to ballast point brews."
Rodel J.,"Riverside, CA",14,5,1,1.0,7/18/2017,"Been to different BJ's restaurants but this branch in particular never fails to ruin the day. The service and the wait time is just terrible. 1. It took 32 minutes wait just to sit us when I can actually count the guests inside. The restaurant is not even half full!!! 2. When we finally sat down, Our server was very rude and was giving us all the attitude and won't even let us finish talking. It turns out she wanted to get off her shift already. 3. Another server took over who in fairness is much nicer. However, more than 30mins has passed now and we're still waiting for our food to be served. All in all, including the wait time for us to be sorted, took us 1hr 24mins before we were able to start eating"
Eric S.,"Moreno Valley, CA",30,7,,5.0,11/9/2017,"Just stopped by for a few drinks on 10/30/17.  Was slightly disappointed that they no longer carried ""A Drink Like That,"" but the bartender, Trevor, informed me that it was due to the fact that they were no longer producing 151, which can't be blamed on BJ's.  Trevor also recommended some good alternatives, and knew his whiskeys.  Great bartender!  Thanks!"
Steven B.,"San Diego, CA",0,2,1,1.0,11/12/2017,"Family went here on a Sunday, saw 16oz prime rib on the menu with soup or salad, 2 sides, and a pizookie for $27. The prime rib had 6oz of meat and 10oz of Fat. Our waitor did nothing, but talk from a distance, or get on his knees on the ground to take our order. Just a bad overall experience."
Jeremy H.,"Riverside, CA",0,1,,4.0,11/9/2017,"I've been to this BJs location a few times... customer service has always been an issue and that was the case with my last visit. Luckily the manager, Mark, was awesome and made everything worth while. My server/waitress tried to give me a serloin steak when I ordered the rib eye. She end up giving my streak to someone else and then charged me for both in the end. Mark came to the rescue and brought a perfectly cooked rib eye himself. He also removed both steaks and our appetizer from the check saving us almost 40 bucks of what it should of been on the check. His hospitality and respect for us as customers was awesome! Thanks Mark!"
Pimlada I.,"Riverside, CA",0,7,18,5.0,6/20/2017,"I alway came here hangout after work .. late night JORDAN is my favorite server ,, she always make drink right ! Attentive  friendly"
Libby R.,"Los Angeles, CA",116,5,,1.0,6/19/2017,So this isn't the first but third time we have found glass in our food during this meal! Plus my friend has found glass in hers in a previous time. This is utterly ridiculous and could seriously hurt someone! This came through a straw! We were also giving the water to a toddler who luckily didn't invest this.  The manager has yet to come speak with our table and rolled his eyes when the waitress told him about the situation..
Momma I.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,30,5,3.0,7/21/2017,"I was hoping it would be diffetent, but not, my lemon pepper wings were worse. Last 3x's, wings were dry.  What's worse,  the price was higher this time."
Alyssa L.,"Palm Springs, CA",295,5,,5.0,10/18/2017,"Came here and my kids were very cranky. Manager came over and offered us crackers. The server then brings crackers, fruit, and bread knots for the kids. Completely turned out dinner around. That aside, the service was excellent, and everything was brought in a timely manner. So exceeded expectations!"
Angela M.,"Fresno, CA",659,14,3,1.0,9/17/2017,"Been to plenty of restaurants and worked as a server for 8 years but to take over 10 minutes to even great a table of two on a slow night is ridiculous. Your servers suck balls we had like 4 of them walk by the table without even a ""I'll be right with you"" and none of them looked busy   Step your shit up because we didn't even wanna eat here after this. Went to place a Togo order instead and no one was even coming to the Togo counter till the manager saved the day. He was cool but prob not aware of how bad the servers suck nuts"
Karen S.,"Riverside, CA",1,8,3,5.0,10/21/2017,"Love the food and service here .  Walked in and got seated right away . Daniel our server was awesome . Great attitude, answered  our questions about the menu. Explained our options and got our drinks & appetizer right away. The beer is nice and cold .  The avocado rolls are delicious . The seared ahi salad is my favorite.  Thanks again Daniel for the awesome service . Look forward to our next visit ."
Peter G.,"Oceanside, CA",0,9,1,4.0,8/9/2017,"Took my relatives out for dinner. Service was good, they were out if my wife's IPA ale, she was disappointed, drinks were slow coming. Food was hot, but they got the desert order wrong.  We got it straightened out, wife was happier. My burger was good, i didn't have desert."
Zanae Z.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,4,,1.0,12/14/2017,"Its so much that happened I do not know where to begin. First I scheduled a party for my two girls by going in and meeting with one of the managers Mark. We discussed having guest up to 25-30 people and I was interested in the buffet pizza & two types of pastas with meat. I was quoted $14.95 per person. Myself, my husband, and our girls sat down with Mark and discussed the menu and also the pazookies  as a desert for our guest. We were happy when we left Mark stated he would email us the contract. Needless to say I never got the contact so I call and got another Manager which was a female she ended up sending asking for my email address to send the contract so that we can finalize are agreement. I checked a couple of days later no contract I called back spoke with Mark he said he would email it over again. l checked and received the email; however, the contract was not correct. I then went back into the venue the next day and spoke with Camrielle and we went over all the details in person and finalized the contract.  The night of the venue was on 12/9/17 the manager on duty was the female manager I spoke with to finalize the contract. Once the pastas came out I noticed that neither had meat. I brought that to the managers attention & her reply was well that will be an extra $2 per person. I informed her that I was never advised of that and I do not feel I should be charged for something that I was not aware. Again I came down twice and responded through email to make sure everything was correct. She replied ok i'll take care of it. The manager came out with chicken and meatballs on a plate and put them inside of the warmers with the pastas ""NOT OK!"" Shortly after one of my guest was eating the pasta and found a long curly blonde piece of hair. She went to the manager asking if she could replace the pasta because there was a piece of hair inside & the manager reply was that she do not have employees with blonde hair ""NOT OK!!"" After my guest informed her it dose not matter we do not want pasta with hair in it. After this issue I asked about the individual dessert and she stated that they do no offer the singles anymore and that I would have to get one big platter for my guest to share which was not a part of the contract again ""NOT OK!!!"" The overall service was not professional and the service this night was terrible from this manager  my server did his best to accommodate my large party he did have assistance, but when we ordered adult beverages it took 20 mins at a time and when my guest went over to the bar to order they were told by the manager that they could not take their drinks from the bar. This took too much time away from my children party & I am very upset to say the least, but I did not say anything then because I did not want to ruin my girls party!!!"
David L.,"Concord, CA",367,107,18,2.0,6/14/2017,"Good food, good service and awful tv. Tv is constantly not working and it drives me crazy, especially on game 4. Other than that. It's pretty good. The wings are great. Bj's ran out of mini pizza, so the waitress gave us medium pizza instead and didn't charge us extra. Over all, It's okay to come for happy hour, but I would not recommend to come here for watching important sports games."
Victoria N.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,11,29,3.0,10/10/2016,"Went here last Friday and had the best service with Isaias (Isaiah?) I wanted to give 5 stars for the service!! But I'll go in further if why the 3 stars..It was me and my brothers and my fiancé and my sis in law and we all shared an appetizer and each had our own entrees. Isaias was checking up on us often, filling our waters and always with a smile and positive attitude! It was very contagious! He deserves and deserved a big tip every time!!!! Will come back if the service is with him!  Now the food! I had the BBQ chicken salad! It was really tasty and with the right amount of dressing! Pretty light which was perfect! My fiancé had the bison burger, which he swore he enjoyed but he was throwing up all day the next day and ended up with a fever. He lost 5 lbs in one day :( My younger brother had the brisket burger and had a stomach ache for 2 days. I can't say for sure that it's how the food was or wasn't cooked but all I know that half my family got sick from eating that night...which knocked off 2 stars! So all in all...Isaiah made the night enjoyable but the food made it memorable...and not in the best way."
Bryan D.,"Carlsbad, San Diego, CA",0,3,,5.0,6/21/2017,"I really enjoyed my time here even though the bar was SLAMMED! Our bartender was Mellisa, she went by Mel. To be honest, the only reason I keep coming back to this location is because of her. She is always welcoming, takes care of my family and I, and is the sweetest. BJ's needs to give this woman a raise, because she holds it down! Thank you for making my experience awesome Mel!  Mel for president!!!"
Ric T.,"Las Vegas, NV",216,5,,4.0,9/23/2017,This place has some nice appetizers and beers. I want a pizooki again that stuff is so good this place is honestly amazingggggg
Belinda N.,"Irvine, CA",0,9,,1.0,10/1/2017,It smells like vomit once you enter and the waitresses are very rude. The foods ok but management remy needs to do something about the staff
Tony Y.,"Riverside, CA",0,2,,1.0,9/9/2017,"I saw the 3 star rating but should have read the previous reviews, I have had two bad experiences in two weeks and the most recent visit I didn't get to experience anything but horrible service. The menu is attractive so that's what had us coming back but couldn't handle the bad service and left after being there just at an hour after being told a 15 min wait without even getting a water we had to forefit the mission. When we were told at that point that our server would be with us soon because she was backed up...just meant it was only going to get worse. Stay clear, been to other locations and they have been ok but this one has been terrible multiple times and doesn't seem to be a fluke."
