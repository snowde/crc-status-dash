Marlene S.,"Moreno Valley, CA",29,19,19,5.0,7/14/2015,"Pretty Good!! At night is more of an adult place to dine, I suggest you don't bring your kids, people are mostly there for the food and drinks!"
Christina C.,"Riverside, CA",134,39,31,4.0,3/16/2016,Our host Isaiah was great very kind and prompt with our order. We had a great meal and a great time. Food was great!!
Maria M.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,6,,4.0,11/16/2016,"Came in to have dinner with some friends, we were seated quickly, but then we sat there for more than 10 minutes before our waiter came and ask us what would we like to drinks, by time she's back with our drinks we were ready to order our appetizers/food. We figure they're taking so long with coming to our table  why not order everything at once we asked her  to put our appetizer orders in first then our meals. We waited 39min before we saw any food and the first thing that comes out is our meals. We asked our waiter where was our appetizers and she said she's sorry she forgot about them and suggested that she wrap them up for us to go. We just looked at her and asked her to remove them from our bill please, the service was beyond  horrible!!!!! The only reason I'm giving them 4 star's is because the food was amazing and I love how much I got for what I paid for."
Ronni A.,"Moreno Valley, CA",54,16,,1.0,11/13/2016,Always come here and normally we have great service. We came and had a server with short blonde hair. She was very rude and treated us like we were bothering us! I won't be back anytime soon id rather take my business elsewhere. When we were leaving she came up to the hostess and told DO NOT put anyone else in my section it's too much for me so I assumed she was mush busy but she was VERY RUDE.
Che M.,"Moreno Valley, CA",2,15,1,2.0,4/16/2016,I went here for my Birthday and the service sucked. We waited for 25 minutes to order to just have our waiter disappear for over 25 minutes. Our entrees came out before our appetizers and one of our appetizers never came to where I ended up cancelling. I order balsamic chicken and it was raw to where I sent back. When food returned I still wasn't pleased and asked for them to box up. Waiter knew I was unhappy. My hubby had them bring me out a pocookie with ice cream for my b day to calm me down. I must say that was the only thing that I enjoyed when I ate it. I don't know when or if I would go back for pricey plates and bad service!
Lily T.,"Riverside, CA",1,25,43,4.0,6/7/2015,"Service is good, food is above average. And we can enjoy beers during watching the games."
Al O.,"Riverside, CA",0,29,,5.0,11/6/2016,"Good food,good drinks, good service! Love the appetizers and the huge menu-whether we want something light or a full meal this place aims to please!"
Claudia L.,"Redlands, CA",12,8,3,1.0,10/23/2015,"The hostess was horrible. Super rude. We asked to split our party, then she gave our tables away and made us wait almost 2 hours. She was incredibly rude and basically shooed us away. I am honestly baffled at how she can even be consider for a position for a job that relies on customer service. At the very least she could be polite. It was our friends birthday for Christ sake. She is a white middle aged lady with dark brown hair. I hope that she can read this and reflect on her incredibly poor service"
Maddie D.,"Murrieta, CA",0,3,,1.0,5/4/2017,"My family went there, (5 adults: dad, brother, sister in law, my hubby, and me. 3 kids: 5 yr old, 1yr old, and a baby) for some reason they spread us out over two tables which was annoying from the start if you're trying to have a family dinner. Anyway it takes about 15 minutes just to get a waiter to come take our drink order takes even more time after that and for some reason my brother's margarita was taking awhile anyway he finally comes back with the margarita and we order our appetizers which are gone pretty quick. Then waited even more time to order our actual food by this time I'd emptied my water but I also had a pink lemonade so I waited to say something we ordered our food my usually favorite dish came out with the rice being cold, hard, and dry. My brother's meal was totally forgotten about and by the time he got it everyone else was already done. And at this point 3 of us had finished our drinks and we're still thirsty couldn't track a waiter down for more. Then we ask to speak to the manager who takes an extremely long time to come out and talk to us and we just wanted our bill which took another 10 minutes. Then finally got to leave. Probably won't be returning to this BJ's again. They weren't even busy. To have all these problems when they aren't even busy is ridiculous."
Jose R.,"East Oakland, Oakland, CA",154,4,4,5.0,3/1/2016,"Ok so this Bj's has provided the best service I have received. The waiters name was Isaiah and was very attentive. There wasn't a moment where I was thinking ""where's my waiter??"" There was a few mix ups but they were negligible. Good was good drinks were good ordered a mojito and it wasn't too strong. The main thing that stuck out was how fast my drinks got to me, usually the BJ's in the Bay Area take ages to get me a drink I would order a beer and it would get to me when my food got to me. Here the max wait was about 3-5minutes. I would recommend this place and the waiter"
Rory R.,"San Diego, CA",39,263,,3.0,3/26/2015,"This place is no different from all the other BJs in the world.  Food was normal, beer was normal, ambiance was normal.  Reminded me of any Applebee's or Fridays, but with a bigger beer list. Worth noting on this trip though was the service.  I sat down at about 6:35 PM, and noticed happy hour went til 7.  The server came by once to bring me a menu, but it wasn't until 6:48 that he was back and ready to take my order.  It almost felt like the servers are trained to ignore guests until happy hour is over, so they don't have to serve discounted food and drinks.  Thankfully, I was able to get a second beer ordered before 7:00, but I wasn't finished with my first, so the second one sat on my table and got warm for a couple of minutes.  :/  Not impressed."
Tony A.,"Moreno Valley, CA",24,29,6,5.0,2/27/2016,Love the beer! and the avocado egg rolls are so good! Pizza is also very good! Restaurant and bathroom are always very clean. Service at the bar is excellent. They have a wide selection of beer and alcohol. Lots of choices for food and good portions for the price.
Vicki E.,"Brawley, CA",82,201,62,2.0,2/13/2016,"Very loud location of this chain. Waiter seemed disinterested in our table, and hardly answered some questions. Food was okay but nothing special."
T M.,"Moreno Valley, CA",25,28,4,1.0,10/7/2015,Taking a star away from my previous review. After manager reached out on Yelp she never contacted me again. Looks like she was just trying to make it look good on Yelp but didn't bother to actually follow through and take care of the customer.
Sara N.,"Riverside, CA",96,183,34,3.0,11/16/2015,"We had lunch here today and brought our toddler and infant, and any parent knows that timing is everything when dining out with a toddler...  Our lunch experience started out normal, we placed our order with our drink order and waited for our food. Our drinks and soup came out like normal.... Things went downhill when our toddlers lunch came out... And 15 minutes later my husband and I were still waiting on our pizza and our toddler was done eating. Our waiter kept checking on other tables in the area but never came by to check on us, 20 mins after our toddlers food arrived we finally were able to flag down our waiter, who confirmed our toddlers food arrived (duh, it arrived 20 ago) and that our pizza should be ready soon.... He never came back. 10 mins later we flagged down another waitress and asked to speak to the manager, while she was getting the manager another waitress came to our table and advised us that our waiter went home and she was taking over....  A couple minutes later the manager came out carrying our pizza and apologized for the delay of our pizza.  We ended up taking our pizza home bc after 45 mins waiting we knew our toddler was not going to sit any longer and was going to make a scene soon, which if we all would have eaten together (like you normally do when you eat out) we wouldn't have had to worry about that. Had the manager not been so awesome and  gone above and beyond to recover the mess the waiter had made, this review would have been a 1 star.  We offered to pay for the kids meal, our drinks and soup bc we were able to partake in them, but the manager insisted on taking care of it all and apologized numerous times for the lack of service we received."
Jodi K.,"Moreno Valley, CA",1,46,47,3.0,3/16/2016,We go there because of the pizzookies but the last couple of times they have been under cooked and doughy. So we haven't been back but we did lol me the food there.
Cindy W.,"Carlsbad, CA",2232,1937,4290,3.0,5/12/2011,"Been to a few other BJ's a few times and it's not bad, for a chain. It's much better than Chili's and whatnot, but it isn't the greatest.  I've been to the one in Escondido when it first opened and had the paella, which was rather decent. I also went to the one in Rancho Cucamonga and had their tomato basil soup and sandwich, again, decent. This specific location, I only went for the happy hour (my husband and friend who was in town was drinking) so it was a little late. I ordered pot stickers and mozzarella sticks with my virgin raspberry limeade while the guys shared a pitcher of beer. The service was quick, food wasn't bad, but that's all I can say about it. There's no wow factor here."
Mary L.,"San Bernardino, CA",230,110,103,4.0,12/13/2015,"I love this place, the atmosphere is fun and the food never disappoints. The experience was made delightful because of the bartender, Melissa. She is the sweetest girl ever! She's so funny and every time I go there, she never cease to provide the best service. We are never disappointed when we come. The pizza is so delicious and marvelous!"
Lisa T.,"Newport Beach, CA",1,23,6,2.0,9/5/2016,"So we came out to MoVal from the OC for a cousins bday lunch. Several things went wrong during our visit. We had a group of 14 people. It took way too long to get drinks, no waters (even though we asked for them). Now I am not a snob or even a crazy foodie. But service here was far from good. The people are nice enough but slow as molasses. We got here at 1:30, waited about 30 minutes to even get appetizers. At the end of it all we found a long hair in our pazookie... So gross!! We will never make our way out here to this BJ's again!! Do something management... You only have 3 stars!! I was nice giving you two..."
Miss J.,"Riverside, CA",0,25,22,1.0,10/3/2015,"Received horrible service from the waitress Tessa tonight! She came to our table didn't introduce herself, smile or have any personality. She never refilled our drinks. And she slammed our pizza on the table! After I spoke to the manager Dean she came back to the table arguing with me about how she's sick. She needs a lesson in customer service."
