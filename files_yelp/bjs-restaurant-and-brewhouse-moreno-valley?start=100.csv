Jamie A.,"Moreno Valley, CA",1,2,1,1.0,3/14/2016,"I'm only giving one star because I have to just to write a review!!!  This was the WORST service EVER!!!  We sat there for at least 20 minutes before we were asked what we wanted to drink!  That should of been a clue as to what the service would be like!!!  We literally were there for an hour and a half without being asked once if we wanted refills, if we needed anything else etc!   I spoke to the manager and he did nothing to help the situation!!!  He asked us if we wanted a free pizookie!  Which they were giving away for free since its Pi Day!!!  Ridiculous!!!   haven't been here in 3+ years and after today I now realize why I don't come here and definitely will not be again!!!  Do not come here!!  Worst service seriously!!!"
Juan C.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,7,1,3.0,11/20/2016,"Had a horrible experience but the Manager definately made up for it.  We brought my niece to celebrate her birthday and the server was very rude and unprofessional.  She brought my wife the wrong order and when she said this is not my order she double talked her instead.  We told her it was the little girl's birthday and totally disregarded it so we cancelled the rest of our order.  So i went up to other employees and asked for the manager as he came shortly.  We explained the situation to him and he responded in the most polite way possible. He apologized, and served us from then on and definately made up for that girl's lack of work.  If i could rate the manager himself I'd give him 5 stars.  I hope that girl is fired by now and if anyone experiences anything similar notify the manager immediately and he will take care of you."
Kate H.,"Stanton, CA",1,2,,1.0,12/31/2016,12/30/16 I would give negative 5 stars if allowedwas my first time at Bjs . I couldn't believe when I took a bite of my chicken I thought it was a piece of bone  that hit my tooth but no it was a huge piece of metal! HOW ON EARTH IS THERE METAL IN FLAT CHICKEN??? The kitchen manager came out and did a report and said the manger would be out but we never seen the manager. Service also was slow I do not recommend this location they did give us free meal but charged us for dessert
Kaite C.,"Moreno Valley, CA",23,25,18,3.0,2/21/2017,I would give one star for the customer service but the food was decent enough. This particular location seems to have very unhappy staff that look bothered every time they have to deal with you. Every time we have gone our waiter just passes by making every attempt to not meet eyes with us and our attempts at getting their attention are brushed off.
Kristina R.,"San Francisco, CA",3,19,2,1.0,11/13/2016,"The pizza was cold and they brought it out with a glove. I picked it up with my bare hands. My husbands pizza took 20 minutes after mine came. We ordered at the same time. His was also cold and he grabbed it with his hands to check when the waitress brought it to the table. This location use to be great, now it's below average. Even the manager asked, ""oh, well, what do you want me to do?"" Uh, I don't know? That's your job. We walked out and told her we're not paying for food we didn't eat. She understood and said it wasn't a problem, but still. Very sad to see this restaurant go down hill."
Denise R.,"Perris, CA",150,168,181,2.0,12/30/2016,Thought we were eating here but the wait time was 1.5 hour long. NOPE you're not that great!! Most Yelp reviews stated slow service and that could be the reason. I hope the managers will see these reviews soon.
Christy D.,"Riverside, CA",0,21,,1.0,4/1/2017,"Terrible service! We made a reservation for 20 people and in true BJ'S fashion, they didn't have all of the seats available when we got there so 5 of my family members had to sit at the only booth available and the rest at a table until the party next to us left. When they finally left, I waited about 15 Minutes before I bussed their table myself so my family could finally be all together. My cup sat empty for most of our time there and when they set up the family sized salad and pizza, they shoved a table against the wall and left about 12"" of space to fit in to serve (causing someone's backside to be in the face of two people at the end of our table. We had to keep requesting more dressing for the salad because they kept bring tiny bowls, hello... 20 people here! The waitress was slow an unattentive. I will not be back. Ever."
Martin S.,"Moreno Valley, CA",94,180,704,4.0,9/15/2015,I have been here several  time now. Everytime it's been a nice experience. Love the atmosphere. The menu is huge. Something for everyone. If your looking Foa an appetizer and you like avacados....the avacado egg rolls are the bomb!
Rina B.,"Hemet, CA",18,1,,5.0,8/19/2017,I love everything about this place. They have variety of salad and the seafood menu are amazing.  I don't usually drink beer but there Stout and Porter beer is good and at a reasonable price. I love the fact that most of the tables are booth.
Malvika T.,"Irvine, CA",213,148,266,3.0,5/20/2016,I'm not a big fan of their pizzas cause I don't like deep dish style pizza but their drinks are awesome! The strawberry mojito is amazing here super flavorful & sweet but you can definitely taste the alcohol.
Antonette M.,"Santa Fe Springs, CA",46,5,,1.0,10/29/2016,The service was horrible. They brought me the incorrect salad which originally took 40 minutes to get them the correct salad took another 15-20 mins. Will never return here.
Puneet D.,"Hercules, CA",2,55,12,5.0,1/8/2017,"I know BJ's is a chain but this specific location always has amazing service and food. It gets busy at night and on game days but even then I'm always seated promptly and food comes out fast. The biggest plus point is the manager, Mark. I see him on the floor helping his servers and greeting customers with the biggest smile. One specific time, I came with ppl who had a lot of dietary restrictions. He made sure to personally oversee the food that was made for us to make sure nothing was missed. It was beyond what was expected and we were so grateful."
John B.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,10,,5.0,8/14/2017,Great food as always! Love Bjs pizza it's always delicious. Service was great! Thanks.
Robyn S.,"Fallbrook, CA",42,1,1,5.0,2/17/2017,Amber our server was great...she was entertaining and showed us a very unique mix between a jerimiah red and a pirrhana beer. It was excellent.
Vallite S.,"Perris, CA",8,14,4,5.0,2/15/2017,Recently went here for a date and it was a great experience. Our server was very friendly and the food was great. My personal favorite is the chicken tenders. Nice atmosphere for a date.
Christina L.,"Sun City, CA",19,34,11,3.0,5/17/2016,"I love BJ's, but this location really just needs to step it up all together. Slow customer service, and oh my, the bathrooms were disgusting! I understand it is busy at times but knowing that, hire some more servers!"
Braden G.,"Norwalk, CA",109,3,,5.0,7/25/2017,"This was far and away the best BJ's I've been too. I don't know if it was the food or the service that made it so amazing. Everything from the Siracha Queso dip with chili verde to the Pulled Pork Sandwich and the tomato soup bread bowl was phenomenal. And to top off the food there was Jordan, who is one of the best servers I've ever had, My drink was never empty she was interactive but you could tell it wasn't fake or trying to put on a show and seemed to actually care about our table not just trying to get the next people in. So if you're in the area I highly recommend stopping here and asking for Jordan's section."
Leah I.,"Novato, CA",0,19,1,1.0,4/28/2017,"No stars! BJs are you anti military? I hope it was just MARK the manager and not company policy like he said it was. After waiting 35 minutes to be seated my husband and 4 friends  who just flew into march Air Force base a few hours before went to celebrate his buddies 32nd bday...they ended up waiting 45 minutes for a beer after being seated! Food came still no drinks... 4 had Out of state IDS (ok I get it) but every guy had military IDs and offered it up....NOPE still no good...the manager needed to APPROVE  military IDs! The manager was soooo busy they sat and waited another 45 minutes! The  waiter came and apologized repeatedly for the wait until finally they demanded to speak to the manager. MARK the RUDE manager came over, My husband politely informed him they are visiting military celebrating a bday, can we get our drinks now? Sure he says, gives them IDs back and walks away never apologizing for the wait or even a happy bday, nothing.....15 minutes later the beers finally arrive! I would never treat a guest in my home that way let alone service members. Is this your policy BJs? To add insult to injury the food was cold and no silverware! If your this close to a military base train your people to respect our service men and women, they deal with enough bull shit as it is!"
Lori O.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,20,1,5.0,2/24/2017,"We always love eating here.  Lunch or dinner!  We eat here at least once per week.  Today I realized that our wonderful server makes our meals even more special.  We have the pleasure of her company often times and I want to give her kudos.  The receipt lists her name as ""Azubah S"" and she is amazing.  A friendly, smiling face and excellent service.  She is a jewel in the crown of this restaurant."
Sara G.,"Yucaipa, CA",0,3,1,5.0,4/29/2017,"I had the best service today dining in for dinner. My server Daniel made sure my party had everything they needed, and was very attentive. Made sure to check in and asked if were we doing okay before we even had to ask. He was very kind, and made checking out for our large party smooth. I will definitely ask for him next time I come to this location."
