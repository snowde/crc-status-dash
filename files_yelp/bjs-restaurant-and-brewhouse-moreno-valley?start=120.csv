Denise C.,"Beaumont, CA",0,4,2,5.0,2/14/2017,Our waitress Amber was super fantastic!!!! She has the best personality ever...so happy and always smiling....such a joy to have her as our waitress!!!
Sanai A.,"Riverside, CA",0,15,24,5.0,1/14/2017,I love bjs so much. I always come and order the broccoli cheddar soup in a sour dough loaf and  their buffalo pizza. Don't forget to get a bazooki
ralphy a.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,1,,1.0,7/28/2017,"So late last week I went to this restaurant with my kids.  I pretty much ordered their large appetizer and some battered  asparagus, pretty harmless right??? Well, about 40 minutes into our dinner, my daughter realizes that the battered asparagus had an octopus tentacle...ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!! A veggie food with seafood!!!  I WILL SAY THIS, FOR PEOPLE THAT HAVE SEAFOOD ALLERGY DON'T EAT HERE.  Turns out, I had to call 911 because my throat was closing. Obviously, I had to have an Epi, steroids and other medications to avoid death.  THIS IS NO JOKE. PEOPLE WITH ALLERGIES ASK HOW THEY PREPARE YOUR FOOD."
Yuan C.,"Chicago, IL",387,344,433,2.0,5/5/2014,"When I was back in high school, BJs was my favorite restaurant! Buuuuut something drastic must have happened within the last several years. Either my taste buds are suuuper different or BJs changed up their flavors. The most recent time I was here, the food was kinda awful :( Here are the items I ordered:  1. Avocado eggrolls- 5/10, not that bad. The sauce was too sweet though, so I ended up  adding some salt and pepper to spice up the sauce lol  2. Buffalo chicken pizza- 1/10. EWWWW. Seriously, BJs, you GOTTA take this item off your menu because it is inedible. The buffalo sauce was so powerful that it STUNG my nose. In the end, I just picked off the bits of chicken and ate that instead.  3. Tuscan chicken limone: 1/10. Another dish we regretted ordering. I was hoping it to be just a hint of lemon, but each bite of the pasta was like eating a single piece of lemon.  4. Pizookie: 10/10! If you're dining at BJs and you don't get this, then you're missing out big time! What is a pizookie, you ask? It's basically a yummy , warm, melty cookie with a scoop of delicious ice cream on top!! BJs has several different flavors to choose from. I ordered their newest one, salted caramel, which was AMAZINGGG.  So I definitely recommend this!  Overall, service was okay and the food was eh (except pizookie!)."
Anthony B.,"Mesa, AZ",1,43,,3.0,4/5/2016,"Some people demand going to the ole franchise fast food place(s) and chain restaurant(s) to have the amazing experience with food they want.   Recently heard someone complain of everything the menu did not have then complaining to their waiter who was obviously a college student caught in the head lights about ordering what was not present on the menu and got an attitude when he said no we cannot. Calm down people, it is one thing to ask if I can substitute fries for vegetables or salad dressing on the side and quite another to ask for something not even there. That said, Bj's in Moreno Valley is really good in my book for the casual no reservation and hungry group with expectations of well prepared consistent food is delivered.  this is not a five star joint so if you are looking for one go to one. They need to place the NY Steak back in the game on the menu though, just saying!"
LJ P.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,19,,3.0,7/11/2017,"Decent food. A tad overpriced. Pickup and curbside service is uneven. Other places make an equivalent burger, and since they removed their signature wedge fries from the menu, no real reason to pick B.J.'s over a dozen competing burger joints."
Jazmine V.,"Moreno Valley, CA",19,11,2,1.0,6/23/2017,God there service sucks ass here!! Customer service here is horrible! Every single waiter just looking and passing is by and it's not that busy tonight! Wish I can give them zero stars
Ian B.,"Riverside, CA",90,3,3,5.0,2/1/2017,"When my wife and I first moved into the area a few years ago, we needed to find a late night place where we could have some fresh food and a few drinks. We were lucky enough to get Melissa as our bartender. She learned our names and what we like to eat and drink right away. She is always so helpful, fun, and kind. We have been coming back to see her ever since, even though it isn't the closest option to our house. Highly recommended!"
Richard L.,"Moreno Valley, CA",4,4,,1.0,4/28/2017,"I have never had bad experience eating here before until last visit two days ago.  We ordered the BJ's favorite deep dish pizza and chicken wings.  The wings were overly done, as dry as dead wood.  The pizza was not warm, close to cold. The sausage had no taste and looked like sheep's dropping.  Could hardly find any pepperoni at all. I have to drop previous rating from 4 stars to one star this time."
Reginald C.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,4,,5.0,1/27/2017,"1/27/17, approximately 12:00 am. Went in and asked for a courtesy cup of water, the young lady who greeted us promptly retrieved it and it tasted excellent."
Oscar L.,"Moreno Valley, CA",26,3,,5.0,12/25/2016,Though I've been to this BJ's numerous times over the last 5 years or so. for the last few months the food has really excelled on all fronts. Service has never been a problem there; Bartenders and Servers have always been excellent. Simple things like salads and appetizers have been so much more beautiful in presentation. Never had a reason to review this particular BJ's before but after my last few visits I really believe they hit the solid 5 stars.
Caitlin G.,"Moreno Valley, CA",79,2,,5.0,1/21/2017,"Amber the waitress is an amazing​ unicorn. We came in cold,  hungry,  grumpy,  and left so happy because she is amazing! My husband and I had birthdays and she hooked the family up with good drinks, good food,  and amazing service! Thanks Amber, you da best! We have never had a better waitress!"
Robert F.,"Buena Park, CA",1,324,,1.0,1/15/2017,"Ugh, BJ's is the worst. Why do people come here? It's for the Pizookie, isn't it? Isn't it about time we demythologized the Pizookie? It's mediocre, undercooked cookie dough, people. Go to the store, buy a tube of Tollhouse cookie dough, throw it in the oven, and in like five minutes you'll have the same thing, only better. Their regular food is awful. I got a pizza this time, because experience has taught me to stay away from all non-pizza items, but even the pizza was bad. Why would they put canned tomatoes on a white pizza? That's disgusting. It wasn't even hot, which means it'd been sitting out for a while (which is even stranger considering I received my food last, in a party of eight)."
Rachel M.,"San Diego, CA",8,12,2,5.0,9/24/2016,I am beyond satisfied with my service this evening. Mark the manager and Trevor the server in the bar literally made my entire week. Absolutely recommend coming to this BJs location! Thank you thank you thank you!
Jesse L.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,1,,5.0,1/11/2017,"This restaurant never disappoints....unless you hate good places to go...then I guess it's not for you. I enjoy going to bars in downtown San Diego, Newport, and (if I'm feeling like dealing with traffic) downtown LA. This BJ's is less than 10 minutes from my house and I get way better service and cleanliness here than some ritzy bars I've been to out far away from me. The servers are great at what they do for as busy as they get. Don't get me wrong, no one is perfect but this restaurant and bar are one of the best and professional in the Inland Empire in my opinion.  The bartenders make delicious cocktails, so that should be reason enough to come here. Honestly I don't know how the bartenders keep up with the bar area AND making servers drinks for their tables, all while still being able to converse with people at the bartop and be attentive to them. Melissa(as well as all the bartenders) is an amazing bartender and person in general. Proof? I know people who are regulars at this bar and they don't even live within 30 minutes of here. One guy comes as far as Carlsbad just to get a few pints and watch Sunday/Monday night football. Never a wrong decision coming here. End speech."
Siiva G.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,52,,1.0,7/9/2016,Warning! Dont go here. I mean wow. I am so sorry to anyone that goes here. Rude employees. Unclean plates. Please wash your dishes well. Not worth your time and money at all.
Lettie D.,"Perris, CA",12,25,21,5.0,4/9/2016,"We had an issue with our food. Beth (the GM) was so very kind and fixed it on the spot. Props to Beth, you have made a return customer of us!"
Lyza H.,"Moreno Valley, CA",14,15,,4.0,9/13/2016,"I love BJ's. Good food, good appetizers, good desserts and good drinks. Sometimes you can get slow service at the bar but overall good. I also hate how slippery the floors always are. not great for high heel pumps."
Denise G.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,5,,4.0,7/6/2017,We come here a couple of times a month. If you get there past 5:30pm be ready for a long wait! Even when using the waitlist app on the phone. Besides that the food is great! Melissa the bartender always has a smile on her face and makes the best drinks!
Inah G.,"Moreno Valley, CA",4,31,94,4.0,11/13/2016,Very good food and birthday package..Friendly staff and nice waitresses
