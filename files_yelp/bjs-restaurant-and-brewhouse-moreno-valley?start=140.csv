Jacqueline G.,"Yucaipa, CA",0,13,,1.0,3/19/2017,there's nothing worse then a lazy waitress! we brought our family to eat and they gave us the wrong good with no apologies! i asked for an appetizer and never got it! this place is not family friendly only single men friendly so these lazy waitresses can get their little tip. i would not recommend this place
Paul C.,"Riverside, CA",0,37,,2.0,6/27/2017,"I used to come here somewhat regularly, but during multiple visits, they were in a rush to turn our table. This was annoying because we weren't even closed to be finished eating. If it had happened only once, I could have ignored it, but the fact it happened several times indicates they have placed some type of metric on how fast they can get people in and out."
Brandi K.,"Riverside, CA",408,33,40,2.0,2/20/2016,"Hate to dip in the servers pockets... But they need more servers! Our visit was over an hour, which could have easily been 30 minutes had we not spent so much of our visit ... Waiting...  In the hour we were there we seen our server maybe 3x."
Shelley G.,"Rosemead, CA",1060,186,1356,1.0,2/25/2014,"UGH, worst BJ's I ever went to.  The service of this place is horrible. The waiters are okay, but they are not that attentive towards you if they are busy.  If your really hungry and your coming to this place hoping to fill up your stomach fast, well GOOD LUCK with that. The food takes forever to come to your table and since they want all the food to arrive together, some of the dishes would be cold.  As for the food itself, its MEH, nothing really special. The dish I ordered ""Tuscan Chicken Limone"" was TOO sour. I do not know what, but I think they put a little too much lemon sauce in it. Also for the price your paying for that dish, it totally not worth it. If you want a good worth pasta dish, get the Cajun Pasta. That pasta dish had three times the amount I had in mine.  Would not come back to this BJ's."
Frank A.,"Moreno Valley, CA",2,3,,1.0,6/20/2017,"I walked in to place a to go order.  The hostess was busy with a patron in front of me and had a 5 minute discussion with him and never acknowledged my presence.  When the gentleman left, I asked her if I could place a takeout order.  She directed me to go around the corner where I would be helped.  I went around the corner where the host told me he would be right back.  He never returned.  Another hostess then took my order and said it would be ready in 5 minutes.  Ten minutes later I walked out with my salad.  Very poor customer service."
Patricia P.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,3,1,1.0,2/27/2017,"Who is in charge of hiring the team here?!?!? Worst customer service everr!!! Came in about 7 pm last night for my sister's bday along with my mother. It took the waitress 37 minutes to finally take our order for drinks and ONLY because i caught her attention asking if she knew who our waitress was because they were taking forever. She then tried to play it off saying ""im not sure i will find out, but i can go ahead and take your order for now"". Her name was Tiffany btw. She was clearly our waitress and was definitely ignoring us. A family of 5 came in about 7 minutes after us and they got their drinks and food before us. She was taking care of everyone else except us. We finally got our appetizers after about an hour, Hot wings to be exact, and we didnt even get plates on the side. We finally got our drinks i didn't get my margarita on rocks like i asked. We FINALLY GOT OUR MEAL. I had the grilled chicken sandwich and to my surprise it got worse. My bun on the bottom was so soggy. Disgusting!! I will never come back again!!! Customer service is the #1 thing at a company and BJs is not the place for it. If you want to be ignored and go unoticed BJ's is the place to go!!!"
Stephanie M.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,3,,5.0,12/2/2016,"Just had Atlantic salmon dinner cooked to perfection husband had jambalaya it was delicious!!!! What made the dinner and experience even better was Awesome service from BRANDON....!!!props to bjs for Hiring a friendly,professional , employee!!!"
Leon G.,"Charlotte, NC",274,17,32,3.0,8/26/2015,"This review only pertains to their House Top Sirloin and service. Simply put, the service was great; no complaints. The steak was ""blah."" It was seasoned great on the outside but for ""medium"" cook steak it was tough to eat, unfortunately. Considering this restaurant looks to be known for its beer, I'll try the beer and a different dish next time around."
Cindy M.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,4,,1.0,5/29/2017,"Im actually sitting at the restaurant, and I am just thinking of how rude our waitress is as soon as we ask her a question. She answers us in a sarcastic way as if we knew the menu as much as her. We then get our utensils & there's a long blond hair wrapped inside next to the fork!!! We ask for ranch and we waited about 5 minutes for someone to bring it and they never did the waitress was helping someone else now & we also ask our waitress for some cheese & red pepper flakes and they continue to make 2 trips back and forth but never decided to bring us our items until we had to ask them again. It's quite frustrating because it wasn't busy or packed with people to be that busy or rude.  I just know good customer service when I see it and we didn't get that at all!"
Caitlin G.,"Grand Terrace, CA",0,5,5,1.0,10/22/2016,"VERY UPSET.... as I'm trying to eat this food right now at home. My boyfriend and I ordered food to go, which we waited outside for a long time... anyway I ordered the ""Spicy peanut chicken soba""excited to try this new meal I was in aw how they prepared it. They just threw together noodles, broccoli, chicken and carrots, all dry ingredients. Missing was the SAUCE very important I would say... the sesame seeds, the cilantro and lime... I was already home when I opened the box, and tired calling and NO ANSWER. I see this place already has issues. NO STARS if I could."
Crystal Grace G.,"Long Beach, CA",851,306,818,3.0,1/12/2015,"I've come here a couple past times for birthday celebration dinners with family and friends and that's when BJ's is the most busiest. I came today to get a pizookie with a friend and they were slow. It's a weekday, 4pm in the afternoon so we were allowed to sit anywhere. The first thing when we walked in two people were at the front but they didn't even greet us. Okay...they told us we could sit anywhere so we did. The waitress that was helping us didn't greet herself or anything and she wasn't very friendly. I've come when there have been great waitresses and waiters and service was awesome. The pizookies are delicious and the food I've had here is above average. But the service and all is mediocre."
Regina R.,"Moreno Valley, CA",1,5,,1.0,9/26/2016,"I am shocked at the bad service that I received yesterday. My family and I came in for brunch on a Sunday morning and we were the first three to sit in our section. A little over 5 mins later , a party of 4 came in and sat next to us. After waiting 15 mins for our drinks, we noticed the table next to us received their drinks first, even having coffee. And here we were just waiting on 2 waters, and a small apple juice for my son........When she Finally gave us our drinks I thought ok, maybe now she'll take our order. Nope. She took several mins to take THEIR order first and then put it into the computer system, which tells me not only did they get their drinks first but they were also about to get their food first as well. So after about 25 mins of sitting down, I was pissed. My husband and son left for the car while I waited for our server to come back so I could pay for the apple juice.  She came and apologized but told me I didnt have to pay for it. So I left and spent my money elsewhere.  What a waste of time. As fond as I was of this place, I am honestly thinking if I even want to go back."
Tugboat W.,"Newport Beach, CA",0,105,28,2.0,11/7/2014,"I was driving though town and decided to get a bite to eat here.  I have eaten at other BJ's Restaurants before so I thought I knew what i was doing. Got seated almost immediately.  For a Thursday at lunch time I was happy for that.  The place wasn't crowded at all but was unusually loud. Sat down, drink orders placed.  Drinks come except for the alcohol.  a different person brings the alcohol drink.  whatever no problem.  So I had to wait a few more minutes for my drink. Lunch orders are then placed by a server that was nice and did her job.  then we waited.  For a place that wasn't very crowded it look an unusual amount of time.  and then when the food came out.......... The food was brought out by yet another person. The lunch specials were not very ""special""  the food looked dry and unappealing.  The cole slaw. Or cole SLOP as it was referred to at the table was one of the grossest thing I have seen in a while.  The pizzas were ok.  Nothing great.  Nothing to give three stars over. I guess to sum it up Im just not a fan of this location."
Cece C.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,2,,2.0,10/31/2016,"Food was good but service sucks.  My server ignored us most of the time, no refill, no dessert offered.  He even made a face when I showed him my coupon."
Trina M.,"Riverside, CA",115,15,152,3.0,1/31/2016,Average and decent food. Went for brunch. French toast is very good with adequate portions. Seasoned potatoes were a bit cold and dry. Clean restaurant. Didn't have to wait long to be seated. Great customer service. No parking problems.
Jasa S.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",56,128,119,4.0,11/10/2014,"I gotta say, I like the Temecula location better. Me and my boyfriend came here for lunch before going to the movies, we were both starving and excited for the food here. I was looking at the little menu that has new and seasonal items and saw pumpkin pizookie, definitely wanted to give that a try. I ordered my favorite dish, parmesan crusted chicken and my boyfriend ordered a steak medium rare.  When we got our food we both dug in. My boyfriends steak was well done...he was too hungry to ask for a new one because then he would've had to wait, so he ate it. I could see how much he really wasn't enjoying it though. My food was ok, idk the chicken was a little on the dry side the mash potatoes were good, broccoli was a little cold, but edible. During the course of our meal I overheard the party next to us try to order the pumpkin pizookie to be told they don't have it...bummer!  When the waitress came by my boyfriend told her about the steak. She said she would tell the manager. A manager came by our table not too long after and apologized and gave us a free pizookie. So that was really awesome.  The pizookie was the best thing we had."
Tina R.,"Sun City, CA",118,5,,5.0,9/11/2016,"Went in tonight for my moms birthday, when we were seated I was concerned that our table may be to small for a party of 7, was going to ask for a bigger table until our server came to the table...Amber, she was so kind there was no way we were moving!!!  Our service was excellent, she was very attentive and treated us so well!!! Thank you Amber for making our visit such a pleasurable one!!!  Keep up the great work!!!"
Lauren C.,"Corona, CA",0,7,,1.0,12/3/2015,"This review is in particular to the location not the quality or the actual food, as I enjoy there selection very much. Would highly recommend to make the drive to the Corona Crossings location! This BJ's has the worst customer service and management.  Came to this location for my birthday celebration with my family and friends. Made a reservation for a Sunday morning right at opening a week ahead of time. Even with a reservation they were under staffed, waited 45 minutes for our first round of drinks. Half of tables order was made incorrectly, food came out either cold or hard as a rock, took over 30 minutes after that to then get out proper food, being the birthday girl my meal never even came out again after being made wrong, and then manager never addressed table or apologized for the situation.  This is not the first time I have had a disappointing experience at this location. Avoid."
Cindy T.,"Rowland Heights, CA",6,20,,5.0,2/5/2017,Sorry for the late post. We had brought our daughter here for her birthday. The service was great and we will be returning back. Thank you for making our daughter her special day even more special.
Destiny J.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,7,,1.0,12/8/2016,"Used to love this place but now the service is terrible every time. They take forever and don't interact with customers properly. Once they dropped all my food after I had been there for like an hour, so I had to wait another 45 min for them to make it again... Didn't bother me that the food was dropped, it happens, what bothered me is that they didn't try to make my visit better. Waitress just said I'm sorry someone else dropped your food it wasn't me tho, and then later she said her manager was going to come talk to me... But they never did. So I stopped eating here and tried picking up pizookies to go a few times... and they've always been poorly made, extremely burnt. So I give up on this place completely now."
