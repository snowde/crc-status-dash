Missy T.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,6,,1.0,3/31/2017,"Unbelievable,  arrived with my party of 8 and we were told all the large tables were reserved for parties,  we waited an hour to finally be seated and all those tables were still sitting empty. Then the host tried squeezing us in the smallest corner booth and when we asked why we couldn't have one of the big still open tables they finally sat us there. Both hostesses were less than welcoming and our waiter hardly made rounds so we were almost done with our meals by the time we finally got everything and I never got a water refill.  It took more than 30 minutes just for appetizers and even longer after that for meals.  They spilled tea on my mom.  Also knats were everywhere! I got a box and will eat at home thanks won't be back here for awhile"
Bar- B.,"Riverside, CA",0,1,2,1.0,3/31/2017,"This place used to be pretty good. Not any more. The recent Sunday night we went to celebrate my kids March Gladness placings, the Avocado egg rolls were missing the cream cheese and the avocados did not look/taste fresh, the calamari rings were mostly ,tentacles (nothing like what was pictured) and I had to ask if half of the pizza was BBQ chicken because it didn't look or taste like there was sauce or chicken on it.  For a $28 pizza?  It was late and the kids were tired or I would have sent it back or gone home. Who has time for that when there is a hungry 18 month, 4 year old and 3 more kids waiting?  Not worth $55 even with a coupon."
Paula T.,"Riverside, CA",53,38,54,2.0,10/14/2015,"Sloooow waitress.  Had to ask 3 for silverware. Really, we did!  So wrong! We already had food, nothing to eat with.   She put in the wrong appetizer.  We ate what she brought.  Food was decent tho."
David C.,"Indio, CA",0,22,1,2.0,1/21/2016,"Service is not their strong point here. Our server was not very experienced in the sense that she didn't check with us after we tried our food. We waited and waited to ask for marinara sauce for the deep dish pizza, which seemed as though it had none. Finally,  we flagged someone down and they brought us this very small container which was barely enough for one slice!  ""Can we have some more, please"", we asked?  Never saw her again.  I understand why they're lacking stars. We normally read Yelp before dining at places. Oh well...we won't come here again!"
Cherrie M.,"Moreno Valley, CA",66,1,,1.0,9/18/2016,"Horrible wait time so I gave 1 star.. FYI, we have 2 babies at home, we were hoping to get home at a reasonable time. Waited an hour for our food. The manager did not notify us in time that they messed up our order. She apologized, & we got our meal for free."
Jason T.,"Beaumont, CA",31,14,6,1.0,9/6/2015,"Last weekend we went to the San Bernardino BJ'S,  and it was fantastic. I liked it so much I wanted to go again,  but this time we went to Moreno Valley. I was so disappointed,  lack of refills on water, the 30 min wait to get a beer , and it was made wrong (dark castle ) more like just a new castle with a splash of Guinness . The food runner communication was horrible , here is all your poor quality food all at once. Head over to San Bernardino, if you want quality.  I will not be going back Moreno Valley."
Carrie M.,"Newport Beach, CA",19,263,48,5.0,12/15/2015,"BJ's has a huge menu. Something for everyone.  Five of us when for lunch. We all liked our selection. I had a portobello mushroom salad with beets, an all portobello mushroom ""burger"" with thin fries.  Our waitress was really nice and helpful."
Teri P.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",0,15,,3.0,9/9/2016,Loved the appetizers as usual. The 3 stars is for the service. We came on August 31 and our server brought out avocado egg rolls we didn't order and kept insisting that we did. Why the heck would we order something then say we didn't ?! She walked away shaking her head. Then she had another table pay our check so we had to pay theirs. Trying to pay through their mobile site was difficult and as she tried to help she was getting very upset. My sister is part of the points program and when she didn't get them she wanted to tell our server but by this time we were afraid of her reaction since she was already about to flip out! She made us feel like she believed all the problems were our fault. In the end the manager was very kind and he helped us out. I wish I had written her name down but she was older with short blonde hair.
Cory Y.,"Waipahu, HI",294,50,143,5.0,10/28/2015,One of my favorite restaurants to eat at. Had the always amazing avocado rolls and chicken bacon ranch and the Mediterranean pizzas. So much food in the deep dish we couldn't even finish it. And if you come around this time of the year new favorite beer is their bjs oktoberfest. Pumpkin ale is very good as well. You won't be disappointed when you come here
Rene F.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,82,56,5.0,5/28/2016,THE best atmosphere and food locally! Servers a always helpful and friendly too. I have been going here for over 8 years and have NEVER been disappointed. Every dish has been tasty from salads to the bar drinks. The quality of every menu and bar item is there!
Kevin G.,"Las Vegas, NV",12,18,11,5.0,6/19/2015,"I work in the industry and nothing makes me happier than having great service and Sasha gave us just that. Every time I come to California I will come back to this BJ's to see her she set the standard for what a great server should be. She guided us in making excellent choices and our whole party is leaving satisfied. We are leaving here with a new friend and that means a lot, not many people can insert a presence that makes you want to have them as part of life she became family and she made the BJ's team family. We will definitely be back and I would love to see her move forward here. Until next time BJ's. If you want top notch service and have an amazing time you ask for Sasha and you'll get just that."
Tim K.,"Moreno Valley, CA",30,56,6,2.0,6/21/2016,"Ate here a few times over the years. The last time we were there it was really bad. The food was good, but the service was horrible. I don't even remember leaving a tip it was that bad. Which as you know, if you have bad service it can ruin a good dinner. It was just too busy for my liking as well, lots of riff-raff there."
Suzanne T.,"Indianapolis, IN",14,4,,3.0,2/26/2017,"Prompt seating, extensive menu, delicious food and pleasant service help give this restaurant at this location a positive rating.  Really chilly temperatures and loud ambient noise detracted from overall pleasure!"
Erma T.,"Beaumont, CA",0,1,,3.0,2/22/2017,"Pizza came cold, without the veggies I ordered on it,  when the server brought them, the were awful. The bathrooms were disgusting..."
Renee H.,"Riverside, CA",0,2,,1.0,1/19/2017,The service was terrible and the employees were unprepared to offer good service. I believe the Manager Ashley is incompetent to lead and that is why the establishment will continue to fail. I hope that the corporation steps in and re/vamps the restaurant...it should be a great place to go!!!
Tiffany B.,"Beaumont, CA",143,96,50,5.0,10/11/2015,"One of my top 5 places to have lunch or dinner. In love with the tortilla soup. Please don't ever get rid of it. Sad they stop serving the cork-strew pasta for the chicken Alfredo. Big fan of their deep dish pizza, and I will always be a huge fan of the Pizooki. They also have great coffee. The costumer service is always a hit or miss but regardless of that I still come Back"
Giselle V.,"San Francisco, CA",4,4,,1.0,5/21/2015,"So I've been going to this location since I was about 15 years old. I've never really had a problem or been annoyed other than the times they take forever to get your order ( which I dismiss when the restaurant is at its full capacity). I  walked in today at about 2pm. The restaurant was close to empty. I saw lots of empty tables and waitresses walking around serving and taking orders. I only went in because I forgot my glasses the night before. I called and a nice lady wrote my name on them and placed them in a secure location for me to pick up.  I waited at the front for what felt like forever. There was no hostess and no one was coming to ask me if I had been helped. I noticed the waitresses glancing over and looking at me but they kept walking away and doing other things or not even acknowledging  me at all. A lady finalllyyyyyy came and asked me if i needed help ( she looked at me as if I was a BUM -__-). I told her about my glasses and she called her manager. He came out and said im sorry they are not here. Then I told him to please look again since I had called and someone had put them away for me. He came back 10 minutes later apologizing and saying he found them.   Anyways. this place sucks, food is not that great, and most of the recent times ive gone, the hostesses are not even nice, the waitresses are always rushing me, and hardly ever come by to fill my cup. not coming back."
Eric O.,"Washington, DC",20,181,1,5.0,9/1/2015,Always get good service and great food. this location deserves 4 stars at the very least.
Linda W.,"Moreno Valley, CA",12,37,84,5.0,8/9/2016,Great food and service tonight! Thanks Savannah for making our night out a super evening! Ordered some pot stickers a bottle of Chardonnay and some brews along with some great dinners. We finished with a killer s'more pizooki and coffee. Loved your positive attitude and smile ;)
Heather C.,"Santa Barbara, CA",34,42,5,1.0,5/26/2015,"I'm a huge fan of BJ's, but I must say, this one has the WORST service I've ever encountered.  I frequently travel for business in the area and call in orders for pick up.  Almost every single time, I am put on hold for several minutes before anyone picks up the to-go order phone or I end up hanging up and calling back. My latest call hold time... 9 minutes the first time and 13 minutes the second.  NO ONE EVER ANSWERED!  I finally gave up.    When picking up orders, I'm very rarely ever greeted by the to-go server and then when someone else says ""someone will be right with you"", I end up sitting around for another 10 minutes as I watch all of the servers chatting away amongst one another.  When I recently ordered several items for a large group, my pizza wasn't ready upon arrival and I was told I would have to wait another 15-20 minutes.  WHY, when I ordered 40 minutes prior and the other five meals were ready??  The server couldn't (or wouldn't) answer me.  When I asked to speak to the manager, I was finally told that my pizza had been dropped and they had to make a new one.  OK, fine, shizz happens, but why not just tell me the truth and offer a drink or something while I'm waiting?  Even that didn't happen when the manager got involved.   So, unfortunately, as much as I really do like the pizza at BJ's, I definitely won't be returning to this one!"
