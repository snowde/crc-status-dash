Elene G.,"San Clemente, CA",10,28,,4.0,6/3/2015,"Personally I think the pizzas are all right. After my first time there, I realize I'm a thin-crust pizza girl. However, this review is to their pizookies. I love cookies of all shapes and forms. Thankfully, BJ's presents it in the best form possible. Warm and gooey, with a generous dollop of ice cream. It's a deadly combination, one that I'd gladly visit often to try all their pizookie flavors."
Ana C.,"San Francisco, CA",2,208,115,5.0,12/1/2016,"The service was great and our waiter was so nice and kept ask us if we need anything.  Foods are slightly salty, but I still like the service of this restaurant"
Amy H.,"Moreno Valley, CA",14,57,19,1.0,3/26/2016,Seriously the service needs to get it together! Food takes forever and waiter not attentive ! 3 hours for dinner is ridiculous . Took the family here for my 3 year old birthday because he loves pizza and cookies! Made a big mistake !
Cynthia W.,"Moreno Valley, CA",74,21,1080,5.0,4/29/2014,I've been to BJ's a total of three times and each time I was very impressed with the service as well as the food and drinks they have to offer..  Positive points are:  Your seated right away  Foods good  Beer and alcohol are good  Parking lot  Cleanliness Great service  9 plasma tv's  Full bar  The ambience is great Negative points are:  Hard to find a parking space  Other then the parking issue I have nothing bad to say about BJ's. Needless to say I have a new favorite place to eat at and will be making an appearance more often..
John V.,"Moreno Valley, CA",1,11,20,5.0,7/18/2016,"Absolutely love this place, not as a franchise but as a restaurant as well.  Especially the one in moreno valley. A must go kind of place."
G B.,"Chino Hills, CA",0,55,24,1.0,6/12/2016,I've been to BJs a ton of times and today has been the only bad experience I've had.  Wait time was horrible.   We went in on a Sunday around 330pm.  First waitress took out order and that was about the fastest thing that happened.   I got my beer and never offered round 2.   Took forever for food to come out. I had to ask for my daughters drinks to be refilled.   Most frustrating part was that my servers station was literally no more than 12 ft away from our booth.  Upon completing our meals dishes weren't cleared.    I did speak to manager and informed him.   I am glad that our BJs in our local area has provided better service.
Tosha L.,"Riverside, CA",41,189,333,4.0,6/25/2014,"Had the extreme pepperoni pizza, which was lacking pepperoni and sauce. Its a deep dish, so everything should be equivalent to the bread. The strawberry lemonade was on point. Wasnt watery and was nice and sweet, just the way I like it."
Erin S.,"Riverside, CA",0,2,,1.0,7/4/2016,"We had such high expectations for our Fourth of July lunch at BJs. Unfortunately, the staff was very slow, sparse, and it was obvious that they didn't want to be there. We had to wait 10 minutes before someone came to get our drink order. Our dinner salads were served 10 minutes before the table appetizers which was awkward for those who didn't have salads. No one ate until everyone had something in front of them. When our appetizers did arrive, we had to send one back for being overcooked. It came 15 minutes after our meal had been served. The entrees were okay, nothing special. We had mahi, salmon, broccoli soup, and salads. All in all, an unremarkable dining experience. I won't be back, on a holiday or otherwise."
Chris R.,"San Bernardino, CA",2,7,,5.0,5/2/2016,"After my previous review on the poor customer service experience, the manager Dean contacted me.  He was very concerned with my experience and after a half an hour talk on the phone, he insisted I returned to his restaurant to earn back my business.  We returned a couple weeks later and the experience was perfect.  Our server, Ashley, who was not aware of our previous experience, was extremely friendly.  One of my friends couldn't decide on a beer so she took the initiative to bring him 3 samples of beers she thought he would like.  That was beyond our expectation.  Dean came over to say hello and was happy to hear we were having a great dinner.  I am very pleased to report that BJ's does care about their guests and if things go wrong they are more than willing to fix them.  I will definitely return to the Moreno Valley BJ's and will try to request Ashley as well."
Jacqueline D.,"Beverly Hills, CA",91,10,,1.0,7/28/2016,"DO NOT COME HERE!! WORST BJ EXPERIENCE IVE HAD SO FAR! Go to Sizzlers or any other place instead they're better! Waste of money and very run down in terms of food and utensils. Came in after a swim meet nearby because we were starving and the only place we knew nearby that showed up on our search engine and was open was BJs.  We came in and sit down, just a few people were eating since it was a few hours after noon in the middle of the day. Our server comes over and greets us and we give her our drink orders and since we already knew what we wanted to eat we gave that order to her as well. She doesn't write down any of our order and walks to another table to take their order right away once we were done. Later she comes back to give us our drinks and she forgets my drinks but I let it slide since I am normally fine with water anyway. She asks us this time what our order is again because she forgot on the way because she did not write it down. A little bit unprofessional.  We get our salads and notice that the forks are all beat up and bumpy. I don't complain but my mom tries to get another set since hers are worse than mine and gets another set of beat up utensils but they're better. My salad is alright but it is noticeable the lettuce is going old. My mother complains about her salad while she's eating it that she had some tomatoes that were old. We did not say anything to the server about this because we didn't want to have our food messed up because we got the restaurant angry with us complaining. When our food came out, I was given an extra side I did not ask for. I didn't say anything but in the end I was not charged. My fries were alright but my steak was well done. I know this is not a fancy expensive place to get steaks but the least they could do is not cook our steaks where they were well done and super dry from being so done. They were extra chewy and difficult to eat. I actually had to put ketchup on my steak to get rid of the bad taste it of drowning in seasoning. My mother on the other hand not only has the same issue but her mashed potatoes were extremely dry. She loves mashed potatoes but she couldn't even eat a few bites.  All in all, I would not suggest this place to anyone I know. Ive had some bad experiences at other BJs but never this bad."
Sarah N.,"Riverside, CA",30,77,33,3.0,2/26/2015,Ok so Kaitlyn put me on hold for 15+ minutes for a damn Togo  I called back twice. And she kept placing me on hold  Wtf? My food could have been ordered and made in that time!!  Called back a third time and Tommy placed my meal right away  Thank you Tommy  Kaitlin get your ish together cuz your tipped on hospitality
Marikka A.,"Riverside, CA",0,2,,5.0,11/10/2016,My server Trinity was extremely accommodating. I accidentally ordered the wrong item and she sorted it out in an efficient and timely manner. Great table side manners !
Alicia G.,"Riverside, CA",17,48,60,4.0,4/8/2016,"Cheat meal. Pizza was good. We waited a little to be acknowledged, but our server apologized. There was some confusion about who was assigned what tables. Understandable. It happens. Got the boneless wings and some pizza. Good as always. Can't complain."
Ana R.,"Moreno Valley, CA",3,11,3,1.0,3/12/2016,"Overpriced buffet crap. This place was such a disappointment. The wait was 45 minutes but I can understand that. What I can't understand is the dirty utensils, bad service, and bad foods. To start off, the first thing I noticed as I sat down was the stained forks. I don't know what was on them but they had some type of crusty residue. Aside from that, our waitress only came to us twice, to take our order and to give us our check. I don't know about you but I appreciate when my waiter/waitress checks up on me and my family. The place was not even that busy or full for them to be ""too busy"" or distracted to stop by real quick. The food. Oh my goodness. All the meals were not a filling portion size and also not good. The fries were so thin you couldn't taste the potato. The Ziki pasta was small and tasted like an old pizza hot pocket. The fetuchini alfredo was probably the best thing ordered but still a 6/10. The kids spaghetti tasted like it was from a crappy buffet, no flavor at all. I do not recommend this place to anyone."
Chad W.,"Corona, CA",2,14,3,1.0,1/31/2015,"Ok, so...... My wife and I go to this BJ's often, and the service is normally acceptable. Last night however, made us contemplate never going there again!!!! The service was terrible, drinks were missed, food was added on the bill that was NEVER ordered, drinks were added that were NEVER ordered. WTF BJ's???? Keep treating customers like that and you will be out of business by the end of the year. Additionally, I have an allergy to a certain type of food and I made mention to LEAVE that food type off my plate.... It came on the plate. BJ's, check your employees and make sure they get their act together."
J B.,"Riverside, CA",0,15,2,1.0,11/8/2016,"Please drug test the manager...he is inappropriate, unprofessional and rude. I can't believe I was treated this way from an individual in management. What are the requirements for management. My order to 1 hour to be completed and I couldn't even get the food cleared from the table. I will not be back!"
Carlos M.,"Fontana, CA",1,37,10,5.0,4/6/2016,Spencer was the best server ever... Hopefully you are as lucky as our party to have her.
Eric G.,"Moreno Valley, CA",95,3,3,1.0,5/4/2016,Spent 15 minutes going over the menu online with my mother who is unable to go into the restaraunt. When i call to place my order they no longer serve her top two choices of chicken fried steak and pirhana pale ale chili cheeseburger. Get it together Bj's and update your online menu
Steph M.,"Costa Mesa, CA",0,14,,2.0,2/5/2016,"This should be one star, but I'm only giving two because it's not fair to the rare workers that are nice! I've been to this location a handful of times. My visits have been okay, nothing extraordinary but I've never complained either.. until last week. Our hostess (a blonde who I believe was named Jessica) was just clueless! I don't know if she was new or just lacked customer service. I asked for a dish that was no longer on the menu and she instantly said ""no we can't make it because it's not on the menu anymore"" , mind you I have ordered this same exact item before AT THIS LOCATION! It was also not on the menu back then! My problem with this was that she didn't even bother to ask the cooks or anyone, it was an immediate no. At this point I was just irritated since this is the only thing I order every time. My boyfriend suggested we leave if I didn't want anything else but I didn't want to because he had already ordered his food. During the few times when she decide to check on us (which took a while after she told me about my item), she would only ask my boyfriend if everything was ok or if we needed anything. I felt uncomfortable and couldn't wait for us to leave. I admit that I was also annoyed and it probably showed but that was because of the customer service that I was receiving.  I have ordered the same exact thing at other locations (in Orange county) and although it's not on the menu anymore they still accommodate my request. So with that being said that's the last time we go to the Moreno valley location.  Btw my item was a chicken sandwich! It can't be that difficult of a request, right?!"
Stephanie C.,"West Hollywood, CA",744,79,24,5.0,1/28/2015,"Have I mentioned before how much I love all BJ's restaurants? They just kick ass.  -Fried artichoke with fresh-squeezed lemon and lemon aioli dipping sauce -PIRANHA PALE ALE CHILI oh man is it good. -pizza cookie. Wait time is always on the longer side, but one of my favorite chains. Ever."
