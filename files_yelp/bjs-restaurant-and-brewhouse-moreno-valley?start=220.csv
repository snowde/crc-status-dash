Lily L.,"Riverside, CA",189,165,65,4.0,11/30/2015,Good place to come with friends and they have great happy hour on the weekdays. I always come in and order the Gyoza  sooooo good. The best I've had so far haha I love the beer selections they have and the service is getting better which is great considering how bad the service used to be.
Karen A.,"Burbank, CA",290,67,277,2.0,9/12/2015,"Whatever you do....DONT ORDER THE BBQ CHICKEN CHOPPED  SALAD!!! Trust me! and if you DO order the BBQ chicken chopped salad, get your dressing on the side...TRUST ME! Other than that, the service is great! Drink on!"
Gurchet R.,"Castro Valley, CA",1,13,5,3.0,3/28/2015,Eh it's open late so why not. On a diet so got chicken breasts and vegetables. They weren't badddddd but they could be better. Great service though
Christy B.,"Riverside, CA",0,12,,3.0,3/11/2016,I order the full rack of ribs. Delicious ate everything but the plate. The only thing that sucks was my waitress. She kept getting lost if I remember her name I would post it. We order a pazooki (giant cookie with ice cream) she took almost an hour to bring it out. We kept seeing her come out but would avoid our table. When we asked another waitress if she could find our waitress. She finally came and asked if we needed anything but still did not bring our dessert.
Melissa S.,"Porterville, CA",0,7,4,5.0,5/12/2015,Delicious with great service! Our food was excellent! We ordered 2 appetizers and 2 main dishes. The steak and burger were cooked to our liking as we had ordered them.  We were seated right away because we choose to eat in the bar and that was nice. Our server new the menu well and was very pleasant. We did order a drink from the bar that was exactly what we were looking for when we gave specifications that changed it up a bit. The manager was very kind and helpful. We had a wonderful time and would go back again! And great atmosphere as well!
Gary Debbie D.,"Riverside, CA",0,20,2,1.0,8/15/2015,"Food was good. Menu's smelled like a mildewed sponge, same with the table. Women's restroom had toilet paper rolls on the floor of the stalls, not on a holder. Disgusting.  Complained to the corporate office and heard nothing."
Paloma B.,"Moreno Valley, CA",17,13,1,1.0,1/8/2016,"Terrible experience at this location. The hostess was extremely rude, unprofessional, and unwilling to help. They did not have clean glasses for our drinks so we had to wait about 30 minutes before we got our drinks, the quality of the food and presentation was disappointing. The management was ineffective to say the least, the way this restaurant is being run is unbelievable, there is NO customer service, and terrible food quality. Not going back to this BJ's."
Rob A.,"Los Angeles, CA",2105,788,4022,4.0,10/26/2012,"First time ever trying this chain.  Came here because I was on business travel and the other guy I was with said it was good.  Okay, let's give it a try.  There was a waiting list but my co-worker told the hostess we would sit at the bar.  She said okay, so we walked passed.  On the way to the bar, he spotted an empty table and proceeded to sit.  Umm, okay. The waitress, very friendly, showed up a few moments late and brought menus and took our drink orders.  Okay, fast forward time; I ordered the fish and chips.  It was pretty good, not great but good.  Kind of on the smaller portion side.  The place is large with huge TV's showing sports.  He enjoyed the place and asked the next day if  I would go back with him.  We did. This time I ordered the small pizza.  This pizza was good.  On the exceptional side.  This time we were seated like normal without cutting in line.  The staff was just as friendly and responsive as the first time through.  The beer I ordered was perfect.  If I come back this way, I'll stop here again."
Jesse C.,"Moreno Valley, CA",2,68,15,5.0,1/27/2016,Always seated fast especially when you use the app to reserve a spot. Root beer is delicious as is the Jeremiah Red. Love the Mediterranean tacos and the Pulled Pork. Always a great spot.
MyDami K.,"Los Angeles, CA",191,54,86,4.0,11/15/2012,That's the spot....to watch the LAKE SHOW...with good company!   Those Long Island Ice Tea's are something else!  That's my story and I'm sticking to it.
Stacey O.,"Riverside, CA",1,2,,5.0,12/27/2015,This place is in our top list of favorite place to eat. The chicken Alfredo pasta was bomb!!!! And the waitress was on point.
Jason L.,"Los Angeles, CA",65,69,51,4.0,10/20/2014,"Overall the food here is great. Their pizza is definitely something to try as they are deep dish and delicious. Their other food items are also really good like their burgers, salads, apps.  Service is on point. I come here often and have not had any issues. The food price is also decent.  If you come, you gotta try the pizzookie."
Renesha R.,"Moreno Valley, CA",64,6,,1.0,2/12/2017,"The wait was short which was lovely, however when we sat down the waitress came over and introduced herself. Trinity was lovely and very polite. We had a party of 12 so she did the best with what she had. She took our orders and said she would be back for our food orders. 35 minutes later we started to look around for her and she was getting our drinks at the bar. BY HERSELF!!! I watched her several times ask for help with assistance to our table, obvious she was rejected.  We asked for the manager and he walks over and listens to our complaints and that's it. I told him to please don't penalized Trinity for anything because she's working hard and we are not her only table. He proceeded to tell me, she should have asked for help. I told him, actually  she did.  I watched her. He says nothing and walks off. He is a horrible manager and needs to be retrained on hospitality. I have been coming to this restaurant for years and I'm sad to say that I will not waste another penny in there. I've watched this BJ's go down the drain. I wasted my birthday dinner in here and it saddens me to think I may not be the only one being treated like this. Kudos to Trinity for her hard work. I'm sad she's under a manager that just ""pass the buck"" on his employees with sorry excuses of blame. Shame on you!!!"
Carlos G.,"Riverside, CA",0,20,6,2.0,1/15/2016,The food here is good but the service is terrible. We had to keep asking for everything. Not so busy at this time to not have better service.
Renee H.,"Riverside, CA",18,48,21,2.0,7/15/2015,"Yesterday we called in a to-go order for two buffalo chicken pizzas. They were ready quickly (within 10-15 minutes) and were nice and hot. When we got home to eat them they did not taste like the usual buffalo chicken pizza we get from BJs. We ONLY go to BJs for their buffalo chicken pizza. Granted we do not visit on a routine basis, but I'd think we know the pizza well enough. This time the time the buffalo sauce was mixed with BBQ sauce. You could taste more BBQ than buffalo! I don't know if maybe they changed their recipe for the buffalo chicken pizza or if they were just running low on buffalo sauce so they substituted with BBQ???, Either way we were pretty disappointed.  Usually the pizza is spicy for me and I have to use plenty of ranch (which is no big deal, I prefer it) but not this time. I didn't have to use one drop of ranch because the BBQ overpowered the buffalo sauce so much. If the cooks did this because they were running low on buffalo sauce I wish they would have said something instead of just giving us something made incorrectly and hope we wouldn't notice. Makes me wonder if they would do the same to dine-in customers, or only to-go customers?  I will state that the pizza was not terrible, but it was not great either and certainly NOT what we were expecting. It was very disappointing. Definitely not expecting a BBQ chicken pizza with a little bit of buffalo sauce when you order buffalo chicken pizzas."
C K.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,1,,1.0,2/10/2016,"Bad 'to-go' service, really bad.  No apologies for waiting 10 min just to place an order.  Manager walk by twice and couldn't be bothered.  Oh, and when you need to ask for the soap to be refilled in the restroom, it's not a good sign the employees are washing their hands. Update:  they even got the to-go order wrong.  Never will go to this location again."
Ron A.,"Perris, CA",543,51,14,4.0,2/9/2016,Great service by Ashley! Always a pleasure to dine here... Managent did right by discounting our meal for a voucher with no expiration date. Will definitely continue to be a customer at this location.
Pricila A.,"Perris, CA",101,16,18,3.0,7/8/2015,"Came in for a late dinner, Ashley took great care of us, although she forgot my lemon the whole night after I had asked twice. My boyfriend couldn't decide what kind of beer to order so she was very nice enough to bring a few samples. Service was a little slow for the time being, the restaurant was not busy at all. Chocolate chunk Pazookie was amazing!!"
Felicia L.,"Long Beach, CA",600,1593,658,3.0,3/21/2011,"I usually do not like to review chain restaurants, but what the hell. The food I always get is a spinach and artichoke deep dish pizza. It's soooo yummy. The crust really is pretty damn good. It's light and fluffy which goes well with the creamy spinach. YAMMI. Pizookie is always good. Warm cookie and cold vanilla ice cream is always a win. Just reminder to go on your birthday for your free pizookie! (or at least fake it, lol). They have a new pizookie.. the red velvet! It's delicious! As for the other food, the other food is pretty blaaaaah. Just stick with the pizza and pizookie =) Also not to mention, happy hour specials are pretty good... $5 mini pizza and $1 off drinks, among other deals. Happy hour I believe is from 3-7 and 10-closing, depending on which day. My favorite drink to get here is the strawberry breeze and the peachy keen sangria... Still kinda expensive with the happy hour deal but whatevers... drinks are delicious! Another thing I liked about one of my recent visits to BJ's was my waiter. He was really funny and accomodating. The way he talks was like the Old Spice commercial guy. I gave him a pretty nice tip. Also the bartenders are pretty cool too."
Sergio B.,"Murrieta, CA",129,51,27,4.0,5/31/2015,"Checked in and ate here last night with my wife and son as I work nearby and I gotta say that the service was great this time around it's always hit or miss at all BJ's but I'm happy! The only reason I didn't give a 5 star is because they brought me the check before we even finished our meal and desert. Almost got the 5 Stars but I will be back Great Job Crew! I love BJ's but always second guess the service at all their locations like I said it's hit and miss and mostly understaffed most of time, don't know if that's a staple of the restaurant because it's at al locations mostly."
