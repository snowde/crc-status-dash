Rex T.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,16,,5.0,2/16/2016,"Been coming here for almost 7 years. Love the food and drinks. Servers are very professional and cordial. Would recommend to anyone looking for a nice place for dinner, or maybe even a date. Great ambiance, definitely beats most other restaurants in the area. I recommend the Oasis Amber beer, traditional wings, and Parmesan Crusted Chicken. Awesome. I frequent this location weekly."
Taylor F.,"Riverside, CA",100,30,,5.0,12/10/2015,"What guy doesn't love BJ's? :p Food is always fresh, hot, and tasty. Always get the burgers or pizza but decided to try the root beer bbq ribs with fries. They were so flavorful and I wish I had ordered more. All around great place for lunch/dinner. Great ambience and staff."
Adrienne R.,"Ontario, CA",180,240,238,2.0,2/16/2013,"Wow Bjs, we should definitely see other people. It's not as if BJ's is exactly fine dining, but it is always so ridiculously busy as if it was lol - if it wasn't busy all the time I would probably go more often, but since it is always busy I go every few months or so.  If you're going to BJ's, especially on the weekend or a holiday, plan on waiting at least 20 minutes even if you call ahead.  I made the mistake of going on Valentine's Day because I wanted a drink, they have a bar, and the peach frost I got there last time was delicious - plus we are in love with the ahi poke tuna appetizer, seriously, the best appetizer they have - but even that was not up to par.   Pretty much everything I put in my mouth was bad. We got the ahi poke, it was good, but not as great as usual.  First bad sign.  I ordered a drink and it took 10 minutes and when I got it, it was the ABSOLUTE WORST PINA COLADA EVER MADE.  I've ordered food before, my plate be completely wrong, and not sent it back because I dont like to make a fuss haha, but I just had to send that back.  I got their house favorite drink, the strawberry splash, and they couldnt even make that taste good nor was it fully blended.  Pretty much, they both tasted like vodka blended with some ice.  I didn't ask to send it back but the waitress saw that I wasnt drinking it and insisted so she brought me a strawberry mojito because it is her favorite drink - I didnt like that either, but I drank it so she wouldnt feel bad lol and we tipped her extra for caring so much.  Whoever was the bartender on Valentine's Day night is HORRIBLE.  I also ordered a tomato bisque because their's is my second favorite in the area after Romano's, it was as good as usual.  And for my entree I ordered the chicken limone which I have gotten before - it had no flavor at all, I wasnt even sure if the sauce was really on there, and it made me feel a little sick later too.  So the service was great, but like I always say, I dont go out to places for service, I go to restaurants to eat, and it was just not good - not good at all. Sorry BJ's, it was fun while it lasted."
Kay S.,"Riverside, CA",15,15,4,4.0,10/29/2015,"Date night out with hubby.  The food was great!  Excellent wine selection with an even more beer selections for John.  Atmosphere was wonder, service was excellent.  Only small error was that our Sriracha queso dip wasn't very spicy, come to find out the waitress had put in the order incorrectly...  our fault for not recognizing it in time to correct it."
Patricia L.,"Riverside, CA",307,10,24,4.0,6/30/2014,"I wish I could give 4 1/2 stars.  I love this restaurant. Beers and mixed drinks are always great, food is always hot and delicious! Waiters and waitress's are great, they are very observant, attentive, and social. Service is fast too. It gets crowded early evenings and weekend nights, but not too crazy. The reason I can't give all 5 stars and wish I could give 4 1/2 is because the only thing is the hostess, I don't know her name but 90% of the time I come here it's the same hostess and she always seems like she hates her job, hates talking to people. She mumbles, never makes eye contact, just seems like I'm bothering her when she's taking my name down. Huge negative for me. Hopefully they fix that soon. Everything else is great though!"
Bradford S.,"San Clemente, CA",23,23,,5.0,3/4/2015,"I love BJ's. The pizookie is the bomb! I love the feeling of the hot cookie in my spoon next to the ice cream. It's absolutely heavenly. No matter how my day goes, by the time I get my dessert at BJ's, it's all good in the end.  The pizzas are my favorite, just because they're deep-dish. I love the amount of crust I get with each bite against the toppings. Always my fail-safe, hands down."
Thomas A.,"San Jacinto, CA",0,4,2,1.0,4/1/2014,"I have eaten at this BJs restaurant many times but after this last visit I will not be going back. I went with some coworkers on 3/21/14 for a lunch meeting and a friend of mine ordered a burger. He pulled the lettuce so he could redistribute it on the burger evenly. In between two leaves of lettuce was a wad of black hair (refer to photos 80 and 81 in the photos).  When it was brought to the attention of the server she said, ""that's the worst I have ever seen!""   Clearly this has happened on more than one occasion based on the server's response. I will not be returning to this location."
Michael C.,"Riverside, CA",0,19,2,5.0,1/11/2016,The pizza at BJ's is so good! If you're looking for good Chicago style deep dish pizza then check this place out. I went in the evening and it was quite crowded but that's to be expected at that time. The wait wasn't too long for a party of 4. It looked like they had something on the menu for everyone. I need to return ASAP!
Josie G.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,6,3,4.0,11/12/2014,Nice setting tend to me quickly. But major downfall was they are out of Stella Artois! How could this be possible had to substitute with four light beers which okay in flavor. Liked the BJ's brewhouse light. It was good quick and warm. Would come back again :-)
Kelly P.,"Moreno Valley, CA",48,54,11,3.0,8/4/2015,its whatever. Their food is basic nothing special and their a bit pricy for just A-Ok food.
Raymond C.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,8,,2.0,12/20/2015,Called a little after 5pm for Call Ahead seating and was told there was no wait to be seated.  Six of us arrived and were told the wait was 20-30 minutes and it turned out to be just over 45.  Told the host someone was having a birthday and they did nothing.   Food was OK but seemed to take forever.  Visit on 12/19/15
Lorena V.,"Moreno Valley, CA",2,2,,2.0,10/18/2015,Our server didn't even make it to our table to take our order. She goes by Lucy.  So another server noticed came over and took the order for us!
Suzanna C.,"Moreno Valley, CA",1,19,2,4.0,3/24/2014,"Today's date is February 7, 2014.  Arrival time is approximately 6:19 PM.  The purpose of this review is to let others know that it is okay to enjoy going to a commercialized Restaurant. 1) Appearance: Nice and modern.  Located in a Shopping Center.  Parking close by can get difficult. 2) Menu:  Don't just try the Pizza.  Their Tuscan Pasta is good too. 3) Drinks: Beer.  Try their Beer.  If you are a foreign tourist; who cares if the beer is cold, try the beers. 4) Atmosphere:  Lively In conclusion, if you like to eat and drink cold Micro beers, you should go."
Bryan M.,"Moreno Valley, CA",190,17,5,2.0,10/2/2015,"As I am sitting here, I am reviewing the restaurant and service. Very clean and I was sit almost immediately since I put my name on the waiting list on the app, cery clean restaurant but the 3 times I've been to this location, the service is horrible. I waited 15 minutes to be approached by my server and I couldn't even ask her what beers were on the happy hour menu because she wouldn't answer me without seeing my I.D. first. Never coming back to this location."
Robert U.,"Pittsburgh, PA",130,696,131,3.0,5/29/2012,"BJ's is a good choice for this area.  If you want a slightly upscale brewpub, this is it. They always have four or five of their own beers on tap.  I really like their amber ale.  They have some good seasonal brews, too, so ask, if they don't tell you. The menu is a bit huge.  What's their specialty?  They have pizzas (appetizer and full size), soups, salads, seafood, steaks, pasta, burgers, and sandwiches.  Everything I've had here is really good, but not quite stand-out/excellent. They have lots of TVs, including a giant-screen one over the bar. If you're watching the game, there are few bad seats. But if you're in this area and want to sit down someplace cool and clean, where else are you going to go?"
Amos R.,"Fontana, CA",1,4,1,3.0,4/19/2015,"I like BJs, I like it because of their variety of food and beer. However, my last two visits have resulted in the same gripe. I ordered a pint of their PM Porter and both times they've brought me a pint glass that just reeked. Now I don't know how or who washes the dishes, but I do know the smell of a dirty, damp, bacteria infested, moldy, old sponge. And that's exactly what my glass smelled like. BOTH times. The other occasion was at the BJs in Rancho Cucamonga. Other than that, I really have no other complaints about this chain. I go to BJs every now and then and I'll continue to do so. Just please BJs... clean your cups, or get a new sponge... ugh.. that smell."
Kim J.,"Riverside, CA",18,156,18,4.0,3/2/2015,Great service. We had a party of 12 and the service was wonderful. The food was great. Several individuals ordered pizza and it looked yummy. I ordered chicken club with fries and it was tasty. I might try dessert next time.
Tim J.,"Corona, CA",0,17,,1.0,11/8/2015,"I've eaten at their Laguna Bch, Fountain Valley location,  but I will never eat at their Moreno Valley  location ever, for the price I paid,  the pizza should  have plenty pepperoni, cheese, worst pizza ever. Never  again."
Desirae G.,"Moreno Valley, CA",44,4,1,3.0,12/16/2015,"This place is cool, the food is good but the service was a little slow for me the few times I have been here"
K R.,"San Bernardino, CA",1,3,,1.0,1/12/2015,"Unfortunately everytime I go to BJs we have horrible service, but the food is decent so I continue to try my luck. However, at this particular location, I've had two poor experiences in a row and won't be coming back. Just last week the waitress misunderstood my co workers request for Canadian bacon, and ASSUMED she wanted bacon bits on her pizza. Well she blamed my co worker because she didn't say ham. She had a nasty attitude from the beginning, and we had to wait for them to make another pizza without a clear apology or accommodation.  No refills, until check time and unfriendly service."
