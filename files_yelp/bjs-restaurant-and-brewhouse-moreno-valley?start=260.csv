Jamie A.,"Riverside, CA",2,1,,4.0,4/19/2015,"The location is nice, everything inside is well kept and clean.. The food was good (even though they messed up a small part of my order). Service was exceptional but, the restaurant was busy so I understand. Overall the experience was a good one, I recommend this place."
Cliff H.,"Mesa, AZ",10,23,3,3.0,7/5/2014,Good burgers I had the bison Biggest disappointment is the kids meal  mac and cheese Kraft out of a box seriously they already have a pasta dish how hard is it to make cheese sauce this is a pet  peeve  of mine when restaurants make kids meals less than something that would make for an adult
Christopher M.,"Orange, CA",1,59,5,1.0,12/21/2014,"Not sure what was worse today, the cleanliness, food, or the service. When we sat down at our booth there was the unpleasant odor of rank bar.  You know, that smell of a gross dive bar.  Either the drains are backed up or the bar is just not clean but it is not appealing. As for the food, the Mahi Mahi with pineapple fried rice was so oily we sent it back. Oddly the waitress chose to bring a plate of half cooked brown rice in return.  That's what one gets for assuming a new order of rice with pineapple and other veggies would be the replacement.  The new lasagna is a mockery of its namesake; its just cheese ravioli in a pan with no flavor. The menu said it would have sausage.  It had two pieces like you would have on a pizza. The sauce had a canned metallic flavor.  We both left half our food behind.  As for service, besides the rice debacle, the waitress was completely incapable of getting our drinks right.  I ordered diet coke, my friend a regular coke.  They started off reversed and every refill she failed to bring the right version mixing them up over and over.  The other notable issue was after the food was delivered, the obligatory food check was skipped leaving us for about 5-10 minutes while we were not happy making the fried rice debacle more like adding insult to injury. This was my third trip to this location and will be my last."
Brenda A.,"Riverside, CA",0,1,,5.0,10/25/2015,"My husband and I always go to the San B Bjs, we thought we would try out the moreno valley one this time. I must say we were very impressed. We were greeted with friendly smiles and felt welcome as soon as we walked in. We chose to sit in the bar, we didn't have to wait our table was cleaned right away. The service was spectacular, Our server Sara greeted us immediately. She was one of the best servers my husband and I have had, And yes we do eat out alot! She had a genuine smile, and a very warm pleasant prescence. We never had to ask for a refill or for anything along those lines! We never felt rushed, We actually stayed and had a couple drinks after dinner because we were having such a good time. The food came out perfect we got the jambalaya and the Barbocoa chicken(delicious btw). First time at moreno valley was awesome we will be back and definitely will look for Sara."
Rebecca B.,"Moreno Valley, CA",1,4,2,2.0,1/9/2015,"So I'm not super happy right now...its been a heck of a week..I'm tired..and probably way too grumpy. This was the first time me and my husband used the curbside check out. I ordered the potato skins (among other things)... However if you're going to have potato skins, how hard is it to make those? You can't call two pieces of cheese, one piece of bacon and one green onion on top a potato skin when that's all thats on it!... just sayin!"
Karl P.,"Julian, CA",1,17,1,2.0,8/20/2015,"My fiancé and I went here for date night a couple of weeks ago. We arrived on a Friday evening around 7pm and the place was packed. We were seated right away which was nice and overall the service was above average especially considering how busy they were. However, the food was a dismal disappointment. Her fish and my chicken were both over cooked and it looked like both entrees were left under a heat lamp too long. The beans had become dry on top and the sauces were crusty. We had the calamari appetizer which was luke warm and chewy. The server however was attentive and knowledgeable concerning the large beer selection. I would have given one star but the service deserved a better score."
Clinton K.,"Moreno Valley, CA",3,10,3,1.0,11/23/2015,Me and 4 other friends met up here a few nights ago just to grab some dessert. All we ordered were waters and pizookies (the gooey cookie in the pan with ice cream over it). All 5 of us got food poisoning and were the sick the next day. We noticed all the silver wear and cloth napkins were dirty but we hoped it was just water spots. Looks like I was wrong. Will not be coming back here just due to my own health and safety concerns.
Chris B.,"Perris, CA",0,3,,1.0,10/14/2015,"The Lemon Thyme chicken with Brown Rice was terrible, like bland as fuck. Happy they had Stone on tap as a ""Guest tap"". As we were eating outside around 9 pm a guy came out an started to loudly remove all of the chairs from the tables. So it was just two of us sitting at one table with chairs. Quite awkward an very much not cool. Will not be going back anytime soon."
Elizabeth L.,"Riverside, CA",99,38,3,1.0,12/24/2014,I'm very and annoyed at the manager today! I asked four times to put the Laker game and he can't manage to get it done. It's Christmas Eve they are not busy and he hasn't bothered to get it done! Lame!
Sue T.,"Matawan, NJ",36,11,1,1.0,4/9/2016,"Oh my goodness, what a terrible experience at this place. We had a large party (10+) on a Wednesday evening at 5:30. They seemed to not know what to do with a large party, and even after they had cleared and readied a table, it still took 20 minutes for them to actually seat us. We all ordered, half of the folks got their meals and finished them before the other half of us even got our meals. And... They forgot my meal. The waitress never put the order in. She kept telling me that my meal was coming, offered to bring me a salad. She finally admitted that the order was never put in. The only good thing was that they didn't charge me for my meal but I definitely will never go back."
Rebecca R.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,12,1,5.0,7/4/2015,"Thought about going to Riverside for a ""good"" restaurant. Decided on BJ's in Mo Val instead and this was thee best decision we could have made! You dont have to leave town for quick service ( was told wait was 25 min but got served in 10 min!) the menu had a large great selection! The server was very happy and attended to us with great service! (Wish I rembered his name, we gave him a great deserved tip) and the food was HOT, TIMELY AND PERFECT WITH GREAT PRESENTATION AND GREAT TASTE! So,... Go to BJ's in Mo Val for a fantastic meal! A+ rating!! Thanks BJ'S"
Kiki W.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,7,1,4.0,9/23/2014,The only reason I giving this a 4 is because the pizza is not good as it use to be. When I first tried bjs pizza it was one of the best pizza I've. However on my last couple of visits the pizza was whatever. It wasn't bad however it wasn't great. However my new favorite item it the New Orleans Jambalaya. This dish packs so much flavor plus the portion is more than enough. The Jambalaya with the Handcrafted Black Cherry is the perfect meal!
Maria L.,"Riverside, CA",0,12,,5.0,9/21/2015,It was a busy Sunday at BJS and I didn't  expect the best service due to the crowd of people. Boy was I wrong. Server Andre walked up with a smile and was right on top of it. I settled in and decided to get an appetizer after all. I was in no rush to leave as I previously thought I would be. I had a fantastic burger and my iced tea was never empty. I'm definitely going back!
Julie N.,"Huntington Beach, CA",56,251,191,3.0,5/14/2012,"Been going here for more than a few years now.  I meet my friend there. We meet half way.  It's an hour drive for both of us. Guess up until the last time,we were both pleased and never cared much to change our meeting place.  HOWEVER, this last time, we met for breakfast, instead of our normal lunch.   All I have to say is breakfast there was close to awful.  Scrambled eggs were cold... as if they had been made a day ahead and just sat there waiting to hop on someone's plate.  I was starving and after taking 3 bites, decided to send them back.  You know what they say about sending food back, so I hesitated at first, but asked them to just bring me some hot, fresh ones. My friend's order was totally wrong.  She ordered a veggie scramble thing that was on the brunch menu, but instead got normal day old scrambled eggs and bacon.  The waitress seemed quite confused... maybe she was new, so ok, I guess, but this is the very first time I decided to write a review on this BJ's.  Unfortunately, it's not as good as it would have been had I not had breakfast there. We complimented on how good the coffee was though and the waitress said she'd find out the brand, but .. of course, never came back to tell us.  Still good ambiance and we always feel comfortable over-staying our welcome, especially since we drove so far to meet. Since I do love breakfast, maybe I'll giver it another try sometime, but probably not for ""awhile""."
Nicknamed B.,"Riverside, CA",0,101,19,1.0,11/26/2014,"Came here for lunch in the middle of the week. The place was pretty busy. There were 3 girls, at the front with their backs to the door talking and laughing with a male worker. He noticed us and sat us right away. First of all my husband ordered a Long Island iced tea and it was terrible. Our appetizer, the carnitas fries had two small chunks of carnitas and a small amount of the chile verde sauce. It was good, just seemed like they skimped on the meat and sauce.  My husband ordered some sort of avocado burger and it came with two tiny slivers of avocado. Are they on a low supply here? The mozzarella/tomato salad with mini pizza lunch special was fine.  We ordered the triple mini pizooki dessert and found a LONG BLACK HAIR in one pizooki.  I'd have a picture but the waitress came over before I was able to get one...lol. I am assuming the manager came over and apologized....she didn't identify herself but she apologized and took the pizooki off the bill. Such a bummer, I really do like BJs but not this one."
Chelsie H.,"Las Vegas, NV",263,4,,3.0,9/13/2015,"Service is super slow. We come here during our drill weekends and every time we wait 30+ minutes for food. When you only have an hour lunch break, this sincerely poses as a problem. Let's speed it up BJs"
Joe K.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,3,,1.0,10/22/2015,The name is very missleading I wasn't sure if I was supposed to receive a blowjob as payment for the food or give a blowjob as payment. Either way I was surprised when I got the check. 1 star.
Vinicius C.,"Riverside, CA",0,3,,3.0,9/8/2015,I like the BJ's restaurants a lot. This one in Moreno Valley is as good as the others but not so good service. This place produces the only Weiss beer I like.
Ruthanne R.,"Riverside, CA",140,28,33,5.0,1/4/2015,"We went here last night for dinner they said it would be about 25 minutes (which we expected being a Saturday night) but they ended up getting us in way faster than that..all of us loved everything that we order & the food came out fast! Our waitress was very sweet, though I forget her name & she even brought me out a birthday dessert which was very sweet..I love this location & we love the food & service we will forever be customers here. Thanks guys!"
Melissa R.,"Highland, CA",48,3,,1.0,10/11/2015,I had the WORST service last night. We had a party of 7 and everyone ordered a steak/chicken. I ordered a simple dinner salad and everyone got there food before me. I waited patiently and received my food 30/40 minutes after everyone. I didn't get an apology or anything from our waitress. She did not get the manager involved or compensated anything. I have been to this BJs numerous times and now I will never return to this location and I hope no one has to deal with the service like I did.
