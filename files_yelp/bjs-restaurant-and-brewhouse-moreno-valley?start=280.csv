Kevin C.,"Riverside, CA",56,16,5,2.0,4/12/2015,"Went here as a last minute change of plans and was very underwhelmed. I had been craving a nice deep dish pizza from Romanos in Riverside all day but because they were not serving pizza when #bae finally got herself together, I settled for BJs. I normally like the buffalo chicken pizza & it did not disappoint however, the andouille chicken pizza 1. Had a hair in it & 2. Was trash. My server nor her manager seemed to be that concerned about the hair but after I pretty much asked for the pizza to be taken off the bill, it was taken off with no problem."
Jelena A.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,15,38,1.0,4/3/2016,"Food was standard, server was mediocre. None of the staff seems happy, nobody smiling, our server was not friendly, and the bathroom was a mess. I wouldn't visit this location again, who wants to be surrounded by unhappy people?"
Gregory Ignr8nv H.,"Covina, CA",4,57,89,2.0,4/3/2015,"Stopped for lunch, but service was slow, got seated in the back, and doubt that I'll be back.  5 minutes before anyone approached us. But when they did the trainee and her attendant did a fine job.  Thai Salad was tasty and the lemonade flowed. Not my best experience, just the facts."
Sean K.,"Irvine, CA",0,1,,1.0,3/14/2016,"If I could give this bj's a zero star I would. Came here to try a pizookie on pi day...seems simple...simply asked for the ice cream on the side because my girlfriend has a milk allergy...the food runner brought out our pizookie with ice cream on top half melted...we politely let her know that we asked for ice cream on the side when we placed the order...she rolled her eyes and gave a pffftt like we did something wrong and completely inconvenienced her...she grabs the pizookie and walks back to the kitchen...30 seconds later she brings the same pizookie back with the same ice cream sloppily scooped off the pizookie with melted ice cream on the pizookie making it a soggy mess..and basically threw it at us without a word but managed to give one more dirty look...i went to the front to ask for a manager...the hostess went back to the kitchen and said the manager would be right out...then our server came by and asked how everything was...explained what happened...he apologized and took the pizookie and brought out a new one with ice cream on the side...and said he'd get the manager...so it's been 45 minutes...manager walked out several times...completely ignoring us and never came out to the table to address the issue...but had time to small talk with a few employees before disappearing back into the kitchen...the server came out and apologized saying he told the manager 3 times about us but to no avail...now I see why there's so many one star reviews here...if the manager didn't care about the customers, no wonder why the employees don't...customer service is not a priority at this bj's. Very disappointing!!!"
Matt B.,"Portage, MI",1,55,1,4.0,9/28/2015,"I avoid this place on weekends because the parking lot serves too many restaurants, making it a pain.  Otherwise, I have always had good luck getting right in and sitting down.  The food is typical of the chain...consistently good.  The staff has been hit and miss but nothing terrible.  Sometimes just a little slower than others, sometimes a little faster.  Overall, great nearby joint for a dinner out."
Andy L.,"Pacoima, CA",283,220,6,3.0,3/12/2014,"Been to one BJs and you've been to all. Food is consistent with other places but the service has never been on par.  Food: Only been here a handful of times with friends or roommate. Do wish it was in Riverside, (it's like a 5 minute drive but the traffic on the 60 at that part sucks every time we went). When I went with my roommates I usually get a burger and potato wedges. Juicy good sized burger and good amount of potato, the only way I finish everything is if I haven't eaten all day. The couple times I've went with my friends we were a bigger party of about 10, we would grab two orders of spinach dip, 3 pizzas (great white, bbq chicken and meat lovers) and the pizookie platter. Everything comes out delicious and within a reasonable amount of time. Love their house brew beers as well, a different change in flavor for the pallet. Note: try to Irish rootbeer if you want a sweet alcoholic dessert drink.  Service: Never had a good experience with service here. The times I've been here with a big party has always been a mission to get seating. Understandable that we come around the latter part of dinner rush and seating is hard for a big party but when we do go inside to our table half of the restaurant is pretty empty. Their position of customers isn't exactly the best and doesn't maximize seating arrangement. They sat us in the middle isle, combining several tables, and to be honest we could have asked for 2 booths next to each other to save the time. I will them credit that they were quick with clearing our table so we can sit and converse freely.  Location: In the large shopping plaza right off the freeway. Rather large shared parking lot but it was always a mission to find parking."
Martha M.,"El Segundo, CA",717,867,4118,4.0,11/3/2011,"I liked the food, the beer (yum!) and the service at the time we went wasn't bad at all, the only thing is, it gets packed on the weekends, long wait to get a table, but other than that, it was a great experience and good food/beer!!! P.S. They have Hangar on draft!!"
Sam M.,"San Jacinto, CA",0,3,,5.0,4/22/2016,Service was great and prompt even though the restaurant was crowded. Savanah was charming and engaging and very attentive. Jambalaya was delicious. Steak was well prepared. Took great care of our 2 year old grandson.
Ashley B.,"Palmdale, CA",0,1,,5.0,4/19/2016,"Some of the best service I've ever had. Savanah went above and beyond expectations to help us out and had fantastic recommendations. The greatest moment was when she ran to get our daughter a ""magical"" spoon to help stop a melt down before it even started. Literally ran. She was extremely understanding of our wee toddler and helped make our birthday boy's night special. To say she anticipated our every need is an understatement. I'm pretty she she was psychic. Would definitely visit again, especially if she was our server."
Roz Y.,"Mesa, AZ",1,2,,1.0,4/18/2016,Absolutely terrible!  Sat down and waited 15 minutes before the host finally offered us drinks. 10 more minutes and we walked out. The waitress was more concerned about talking about her ex husbands illness than taking care of guests.
Pieter W.,"Moreno Valley, CA",95,3,2,3.0,7/22/2015,"I would give this place 5 stars. But the front desk is like a pack of guard dogs.  But once you past the rude stuck up hostesses, you enter an arena of awesomeness.  The service is great.  The waitress / waiters have excellent customer service and always make up feel at home and appreciated.  Wish we can say the same for the hostesses."
Daisey S.,"Riverside, CA",6,6,2,5.0,3/16/2015,"We planned a last minute dinner for my sister in law. They wanted BJs which I denied due to my bad experience that I had at the one in Ontario. So they insisted and I decided to give it another try, so it was a party of 9 I called to see if I can squeeze in last minute reservations, happily they said yes for 7:30pm so we arrived at 7:15 and by 7:20 I was all ready seated. I was greeted by Azubii (sorry if I misspelled the name) she took all of our drink orders and asked if we wanted to get started on any appetizers which of course I know I wanted the Avocado Egg Rolls and some Potato Wedges. She brought our drinks right  away took our Oder and asked if I wanted my kids meals before ours I was happy she said that my kids were so hungry. She would come back with refills without even asking I loved that!! They brought our food out and once again she asked if everything was good everything was delicious and yummy. At a point my daughter was choking and a piece of food she finally vomited it all out Azubii saw and rushed and gave me napkins and asked if she was ok. Thank god she was she said give me a second I'll bring her something and she did a lil happy face with 2 cherries and a wedge of orange. She also gave me another pazookie for my lil ones I was happy and satisfied so much now only if every timeI craved BJs she was there thank you so much Azubii!!"
Courtney J.,"Riverside, CA",26,9,3,5.0,5/10/2015,"The pizookie, as usual, was amazing!! Repeat customer over and over. The staff is very professional and lovely.  Food is always great and the environment is clean. Lots of space for large groups."
Celena B.,"Riverside, CA",0,12,,1.0,10/5/2016,"I would not recommend this location. The last few times I have been here it has taken two or three attempts to make an order right. I'm not sure if server put order in wrong or what I just know an order should be fixed on second time. I went back recently since this is where my dad wanted his birthday dinner, I came with an open mind but was quite disappointed in the service. I really wish I took a picture of my ""corrected"" order. You know it's bad when the manager comes out right away after seeing what you sent back... my order for extra sauce came out first with very little sauce on my pizza. I requested that they correct it and not 5 minutes later did I have a ""new ' pizza with a pool of sauce on top. I ended up just cancelling my meal. The server huffing about me requesting my order be fixed was uncalled for. I doubt I will ever return to any bjs location after continually being disappointed by both service and quality of food at this location."
karla v.,"Perris, CA",1,2,,2.0,3/5/2016,"Horrible service, the greeter didn't ask for my name when checking in and got three parties before mine! Food took too long, and was cold, and waitress was plain and saw her only three times. Not coming back!"
Chase D.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,3,,1.0,3/3/2016,Extremely bad service really slow good luck to you if you even want a simple refill. Always like two waitress to attend like 40 people. Only restaurant in moreno valley but I really try to avoid this particular bjs establishment.
Eduardo H.,"Moreno Valley, CA",1,12,17,5.0,6/22/2014,"Great food!!!  Good service , never had a dish here that was well prepared and look as good as it taste. Our server Andrew was great."
Christine H.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,7,1,2.0,3/1/2016,I enjoy bjs food but I for some reason when you order on the app they do not get the order right. I have ordered 3 times from the app making adjustments to my order and all times they were incorrect. The first two times I called and they just apologized and asked if I could bring the food back to correct it which I did not because I do not live close by. The 3rd time I didn't even bother. There is never really anyone at the take out spot so you have to stand around and wait for someone to help you. Overall I would expect my food to be right and not wrong all 3 times. They need to work on someone checking the food to make sure it matches the online order.
Aldo U.,"Orange, CA",13,1,,5.0,3/14/2015,"Love eating here.  Food is great.  But most of all the beer is what I come here for.  Service is great, Trevor is amazing!!  Talk about a tan year around, guy is fucking beautiful. Bar service is were it's at!!! All you have to do is scope out a table, rub your scent on it and it's yours. BEEF DIP, ALL DAY."
Christopher C.,"Moreno Valley, CA",41,9,4,4.0,2/12/2015,"I mainly go for the beer, the different seasonal beers they have on tap and their own brews are great.  I can't complain about the food either.  Not to forget about the servers/bartenders.  No matter which BJ's I visit they are always helpful, always makes sure that I'm doing well and always makes sure I use my rewards even though I tend to forget at times."
