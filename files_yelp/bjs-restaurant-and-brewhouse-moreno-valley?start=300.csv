Humberto G.,"Vista, CA",288,496,720,4.0,9/5/2013,"I have been to a bunch of BJ's all over SoCal and have to say I was overwhelmed with the customer service here 2 weeks ago. Our server was one of the friendliest waiters, and it is always a plus when they are able to get my mom to over tip for the great customer service.  We had the pork chops, chili, jambalaya and chicken tortilla soup. I think the chili is just OK, but my sister always loves to order it. The tortilla soup was surprisingly good, and the lime added a nice flavor to a really big portion.  We also ordered off the small bites menu, which has really nice light offerings to sample at just a few bucks. I have been ordering the mini-bruschetta, and everyone always enjoys it. What really stood out was the customer service here. Most know of the food, but when the food is good and customer service is awesome, then you know people will come back."
Marisol O.,"Riverside, CA",5,97,206,1.0,8/22/2015,Give one star because the food was not right when it came out. ...if I could  give the server  stars it would definitely be 5 STARS  to our waiter ISAIAS L he was relly  good  at his job not once did we have to ask for refills on our drinks. We got sat by the regester where they put the orders in and I could here and see the other waitresses  and waiters complaining about there tables and just standing  around. ...not once did I see our waiter  stop and chat he keep serving 3 other tables and ours gave a 1 star because the food took long to come out then my husband's  food was undercooked and my son's chicken nuggets where over cooked  my plate and my other son's plate came out later. ..kinda wanted to eat together since I  didn't have to cook tonight. Overall it was at least good to have a good server which is hard to find now a day's Thanks ISAIAH L for taking care of us...not  so happy with the food
Soraya N.,"Moreno Valley, CA",41,34,15,5.0,1/24/2015,One of my favorite resturant in this area . I love their Pizza as well as their different salad not to mention the bears and awesome French fries! This  resturant has an elegant modern setting .
Richard V.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,9,,5.0,1/27/2016,An attempt to contact me was appreciated. I only want this same mistake no to reoccur.  I'm updating my prior review and giving 5 stars because this location has the best drinks in Moreno Valley.
Gabriel G.,"Moreno Valley, CA",202,9,4,4.0,9/24/2014,"I would give this place a five, but there service at times can be really awful. There are time that it's a hit and miss with good customer service, but there has been times I have had bad and nasty waiters that I have to get a manager involved. Other than there service the food is great and I must say I have tried at least everything once or twice on the menu."
Patrick M.,"Riverside, CA",319,151,186,4.0,2/25/2013,The concept of a Brewhouse and Restaurant is outstanding. I am suprised that Budweiser and some food chain hasn't partner up to create a chain of these.  Visited this place last week to catch up with a friend and enjoy happy hour. Because we sat at the bar there were no issues with getting the bartenders (Rob and ahh... Rob)attention and ordering what we needed.  We ordered the Chicken Wontons. (3 orders) and I had of course Guiness. The wontons were received expeditiously. And we had a good time. I haven't been here in a while but was pleased with the service and the food was good.
Nico F.,"Riverside, CA",0,170,7,4.0,12/28/2014,Been three times to this location. It's a great place. Servers are great and food is delicious. Gave only 4 stars cause the last time we went I had to wait 15 minutes to get a damn beer
Janet T.,"Riverside, CA",3,28,,2.0,2/5/2013,"No amount of semi-fancy decor is going to save this place from bad service and overpriced food.    Our waitress was for lack of a better word, weird. She would come to our table and just have this creepy stare. Yes, this restaurant has their menu decked out with a variety of food options...but it's just so disappointing when a $15 pizza that you expect to be good comes out like its just been frozen and heated up with a microwave and SMALL. I mean, really? C'mon. Their soup and salad combo wasn't bad. It was just soup and salad. It'd be really sad if they messed that up.  I think this is the last visit to this chain."
Tracy W.,"North Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",76,122,20,5.0,11/5/2014,"Nice atmosphere, roomy booths, good service, LOTS to chose from on the menu.  Yummy food.  Plenty of parking.  All good!"
John F.,"Brigham City, UT",15,5,,5.0,3/10/2015,"Wasn't too hungry, so I just ordered apps at the bar. Santa Fe Spring Rolls and Stuffed Mushrooms; very tasty."
Roman B.,"Rancho Bernardo, San Diego, CA",125,233,290,3.0,4/18/2011,"No matter what BJ Restaurant I attend too, I hardly have anything bad to say about them. I came here on Friday night, It was packed!! I believe it was around the time of ""Happy Hour"", but sadly, I came in at 7pm and that was the end of it. (darn it, haha) My wife and I finally got that ""alone time"" since our kids were at the grandmas house. It was fun spending that time with my wife since we work so much and had few drinks, 2 drinks and already feeling good? WOW!! haha I highly suggest anyone to try out the adult Rootbeer drink they offer, I don't remember the name of it, but you could find it. It's pretty damn good and you'll get hooked. I seriously wanted to order another round =)"
Jonathan O.,"Riverside, CA",32,17,3,5.0,5/26/2013,"I am a regular at BJ's, and I've been to quite a few in the SoCal area.  That said, BJ's in Moreno Valley is a great restaurant/bar to go grab something to eat or drink, whether you want a big meal, something light, or just some beer. The Happy Hour menu has great bargains, anchored by their half-priced Mini-Pizzas. The lunch menu is also a great bargain with lots of under $10 options. Lunch beer prices are $3.50 for any BJ's house brews, which are, in my opinion, surpass the other beers they have on draft (or bottle).  BJ's usually has at least two seasonal/limited beers (which change every couple of months) at any given time and you should always make an effort to try them. This BJ's location also opens at 10am on weekends and provides a 'brunch' menu. Their brunch menu is solid and they have some good breakfast/brunch selections. As far as the MoVal location, the bartenders are great. I may be biased because I'm a regular, but I find that they give more attention than the other BJ's locations' bartenders. BJ's in general is a great value in terms of food (good pricing, wide selection) and alcohol (great in-house beers). I can definitely attest that the MoVal location can provide the great value in food and drink and back it up with good service."
Jennifer F.,"Riverside, CA",0,2,,2.0,2/29/2016,"We arrived at opening  (11 am). We sat in the bar area. Cynthia J introduced herself and took our drink order. My companion ordered a vodka cran and I asked to try the berry cider. Our waters and the vodka cran were delivered, but my taster Cindy gave to the table behind us. After waiting at least 5 min for her to return, I asked if I could get my taster and Cindy responded with, ""you will just have to wait. My bartender is helping me with my tables."" When we ordered our meal, we asked to START with the calamari. My taster came just before our entrees hit the table. Our calamari came after we explained that we had not received our appetizer yet. The appetizer was brought out at least 5 min after that, and we're room temperature at best, even though our server said it had just come up. Cindy showed zero concern for our dining experience and we never even saw a manager, unless he was the guy with the laptop in the red shirt sitting at the high top table.  While I enjoy BJ'S broccoli cheddar soup immensely,  this was our first experience at this particular location and will be our last. Table 808, SvrCk: 1."
Frank A.,"Oxnard, CA",0,2,,1.0,8/3/2015,Went for hamburgers for lunch today.  Ordered medium well since I learned. They must have taken a frozen patty and grilled it. Raw in the center. Fries were good. Not coming back.
Juliana M.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,2,,5.0,4/19/2015,I highly recommend BJ's in Moreno Valley. Great food and the best employees!! Me and my family always receive the best service. If you are looking to have a drink with friends the bar here has the best bartender ever!
Sally S.,"Philadelphia, PA",2,12,5,5.0,9/26/2015,Micheal is the best to go person!!  My order was perfect!!  Hope Management notices this young man as an asset to the company!!
Kate V.,"Riverside, CA",2,8,,4.0,2/16/2015,"I'm giving 4 stars because of the food. We ordered the mozzarella sticks, which were amazing! After that, we ordered Chicken Bacon Ranch deep dish pizza and then the pazooki (sp) for desert.  I'm always pleased with the food when we come to Bj's but for some reason it's always a hit or miss when it comes to the service. I'm really picky when it comes to my refills and when I don't get them it ruins the experience for me. So when I have a waitress who just isn't on top of that, I get crabby. The food is always great but the service not always so great!"
Sensi V.,"Yucca Valley, CA",0,56,12,4.0,2/8/2015,The IPAs were very good. Our server brought us IPA samplers without us requesting them. Service was great and the food was decent for bar food. I'd go back.
Sue N.,"Glendale, AZ",33,35,5,2.0,5/14/2014,"Man...I have been here, and other BJ's over the years... but i have to say that tonight was the absolute worst.   Food and drink are always on point.  My issue tonight, service.  Rather, lack of.  We had no issue with the wait staff, our server(I can't remember her name) was great. All is well, a group of 5, we're seated,get drinks and our appetizer.  It's about 7:30 when we place our dinner order.  We're all talking and enjoying each others company when we realize it's been a long time since we've ordered..finally we flag down  a server, she brings us more drinks while she goes to see what he issue is.  She comes back, profusely apologizes about a mix up with our order.  She says the manager will be over to see us and we will be compensated for the wait (it's now 8:30)And that our orders will be right out. We get our food, the manager even serves a plate ... but says nothing....and he never returns. Finally, at 9:15 we get our check..some of them are opened and we all notice no comp for anything.  We ask the poor frazzled server....she apologizes and heads off to find the mgr.   We watch her approach him.. they speak, he walks away, and she walks back and says that he says she misspoke and there was nothing they would do for us.   Some of us pay... but we all ask to speak with him.   Again, we watch as she goes to speak with him....he tells her something... and in a few minutes she returns to the table and had been given permission to comp 2 meals.   Seriously, he wouldn't come talk to us?   I know we all tipped this server pretty good, cause she did the best she could under lousy conditions.   Again, food and drink, on point... management/customer service... just awful."
Liz S.,"Niland, CA",11,7,3,2.0,8/11/2014,"Nothing wrong with the food here. The problem is the staff, I don't know if our waitress had a bad night but she definitely took it out on myself and the group I was dining with. She made references to the weight of some of my friends who were dining with me (basically implied they were fat) at one point even asked if my friend wanted skinny fries or FAT fries...in all my years I have never heard anyone refer to wedge fries as FAT fries (this was just one example, the whole night was horrible) At this point we knew that she was not going to give us good service so we ate our food and left as quickly as possible. Pretty disappointed in the service and will not be going back to this particular BJ's."
