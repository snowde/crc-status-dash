Vanessa M.,"Hayward, CA",143,29,26,1.0,5/24/2015,"Bad service and bad food. The waitress, Tammy, took forever to take our order, to bring our drinks, and to bring out our food. My friend's steak was overcooked, my appetizer was put in to come out with my meal, my husband's burger came out overdone with no bacon (add bacon was specifically requested), and old fries. My pizza was doughy and undercooked. The waitress said the bacon mishap was her fault cause she put the order in wrong and offered my husband a free dessert. He asked for the beignet. She left and came back saying she wasnt allowed to give him the beignet because it has ""fresh strawberries and cooked dough"" ...hmmm really? and he had to pick a pizzookie.  He wasnt really wanting that so he said nevermind. She said you can talk to the manager to see if she'll approve it. So he said okay, mainly to discuss all the other issues. The manager, Vera, took awhile to come talk to us, and when she did and listened to all the issues, she seemed very unphased and offered us the beignet and then asked if we were done. Tammy could have talked to the manager for us and spared us the explanation for some beignets. The manager could have at least seemed half interested and been a little more apologetic. Two thumbs down for BJs."
Iliana R.,"Riverside, CA",31,157,7,4.0,10/5/2014,"So, Ive had their burgers, soups, pizza, salad and fish but my favorite is the Mac and cheese! Yes, its so damn good, the best!  I can order two cups but prefer not to splurge on this cheesy goodness.  The only problem is that they don't offer it as a side when you order a dish. Shame on you!"
Shawna T.,"Auburn, CA",5,78,2,2.0,9/29/2015,This is my second visit in a month. Both experiences were subpar. First time I had parmesan crusted chicken. It Tasted like someone lost the salt shaker in it and the chicken was dry! I didn't complain or send food but because we were with my better halves business associate but I should have said something. Today wasn't any better. They are short on staff and everyone is busy and we felt rushed to order. I had the ahi seared salad. It looked nothing like the photo in the menu. The wontons on top of the salad ( I thought they were old onion strings) were way passed their use by date. The salad was soaked in a very vinegary dressing. It was sent back and i didn't order anything else. Looks like another chain restaurant has gone by the way side. Everyone is cutting back and using gmo foods with no taste. If  I wanted a frozen dinner I would have gone to the grocery store. I won't go back.  For the money you spend you would be better off somewhere else.
Rebecca N.,"Portland, OR",296,151,448,4.0,2/28/2011,"This is a really nice BJs.  Always come here for some scampi pasta, a cup of clam chowder, and a half/half pizookie.  The service here is really good, they do try to get everyone in as fast as they can. Every time I have come here the manager is always there asking if everything was okay. All the food here is really good. However, anytime you go to a BJ's, one MUST order a pizookie."
Lopez A.,"Moreno Valley, CA",1,42,1,5.0,11/5/2014,"Thier Avocado rolls are so yummy !!! And I love the tomato bisque soup ., Our waiter was nice. I've been to this location 3 times and I've never had a complaint or problem with service here.."
Vanessa L.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,9,,1.0,1/24/2016,Very disappointed in the service we received.. Our waiter was not attentive at all! 1st we received our appetizers but no plates i figured she would make a round and check up on us but nope never got em ..instead of us being offered refills we had to be requesting them .. She completely forgot to take our actual main dish orders .. When we finally got our food everything was cold... Wont be returning anytime soon
Adam P.,"Moreno Valley, CA",10,11,,4.0,3/20/2015,Celebrated a birthday here recently. They accommodated our large group quickly. They took in to account our special  requests with out any hesitation. The server  was on top of everything. We never had to request  any refills. Our food arrived  quickly  and didn't disappoint. We new will go here  again soon.
Brenda M.,"Mira Loma, CA",2,20,,4.0,10/9/2015,"It took more than 1/2 hour to get our food. Four stars for great food. What made our experience better was the fact that the restaurant manager, Tim came out without us asking to speak to a manager, and apologized for the tardiness. That speaks a lot of the type of management at this restaurant. Thank you Tim. We really appreciated that."
Eric M.,"Moreno Valley, CA",70,40,28,5.0,7/12/2014,Great food. Always a good time. Perfect place for a first date or to bring your family. The Pizzookie desert is by far the best desert on their menu. Customer service is awesome and friendly.
Oscar H.,"Oceanside, CA",14,15,3,1.0,5/6/2014,This BJs really needs to get their act together.  I will definitely be by passing this BJs and just wait till get to Menifee or Temecula. The staff acted like it was nooo big deal when they forgot my food and were serving everyone around us.  I had to ask because no one came by to check on us. And the food tasted like it was left under a lamp! Has this company ever heard of secret shoppers. We will not be back ever.
R M.,"San Diego, CA",1,60,,3.0,9/14/2015,"Hostess had us waiting for about 5 minutes . Wasn't even busy and bussers, servers, and a hostess all passed us up. The hostess was having a conversation laughing with the take out guy behind the wall and had us waiting til she was finished with her conversation, she looked over and saw us waiting but still went ahead and finished up. We finally got sat and our server passed us up twice then went to check on another table before greeting us so we had time to look through the entire menu and by the time he got to us we were already ready to order. Again, it wasn't even busy. No excuse for everyone to have us waiting like that and passing us by. If anything, we could have at least been greeted by the hostess and then she could have said she would be right with us, not just ignore us, as well as the other staff members who passed us by. The server could have greeted us as well and at least gotten our drink order in first or even just a hello I'll be right with you."
Joyce R.,"Riverside, CA",66,42,33,4.0,5/20/2011,"Went on a Thursday, 12:30pm. Place was busy but we got seated right when we walked in. Check out their menu, especially their lunch portions and ""Enlightened Menu"" for those watching their calories. Priced well and good variety.  We ordered: 1.) Half order of Flatbread pizza (Chicken pesto) + salad for $6.95. 2.) 1 topping pizza + salad for around $6.50. 3.) 1 Soda 4.) Chocolate Chunk Pizookie (They have other choices, and a sample platter too!) Our total was around $24.00 without tip. It was satisfying enough that it didn't make us uber full, bloated, or sick even after we shared (and demolished) that chocolate chunk pizookie! Thanks Joseph and the girl who helped us before him (she didn't have a name tag.) Nothing fancy, just friendly, prompt, attentive service. A pleasant experience. =)"
Ricardo P.,"Riverside, CA",78,41,201,4.0,3/17/2014,All the times that I have been to his Bj's I have had really great service. The food is good and the servce is great.
G S.,"Riverside, CA",0,2,2,1.0,3/30/2014,"Our waitress was nice and provided good service; however, our food not so good because my coworker found a hair ball (picture 80, 81) between the two leaves of lettuce inside his hamburger.   Our group of six was very disgusted.. we did not enjoy our meal after the incident.  The shift manager only took the hamburger meal off the bill and his apology was very poor."
Shayne M.,"March Air Reserve Base, CA",20,13,3,3.0,1/9/2013,"We had dinner there last night,,,the service was good, the snacks were too. I ordered the Rib eye ($18.95) which I thought was steep for that cut...Scott ordered the jalapeno burger. I chose steamed veg's for the side (cutting carbs). I was disappointed at the puny size of the veg's,,mostly those little crappy carrots from a bag and only a couple good ones like broccoli and squash.... but the worst was the steak was chewy as hell. The flavor was fine, it was cooked med, but it was like eating a shoe. Scotts burger was good but his fries weren't piping hot so they were rubbery in 5 min's. For this restaurant which I have liked in the past I expected a better steak especially for $19.00!!  Next time (next year maybe) I'll just get pizza."
Rita D.,"South El Monte, CA",4,12,4,1.0,4/18/2015,This place was horrible. Worst service ever. Aside from the 30 min wait (when there was plenty of tables available and not to forget another waitress arguing on the phone with a family member in front on us. Finally we were seated. The food was cold when it got to our table and our waitress had no personality nor did she check on us throughout our meal. Will not be visiting this BJs again.
Cali R.,"Moreno Valley, CA",3,67,27,4.0,7/28/2014,I love the parmesan crusted chicken. Service was ok could have been a tad better but I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt. Overall Bjs food is great. Only thing is the broccoli didn't taste clean. So I'm only giving 4 stars
Bryan B.,"Plano, TX",1,77,6,3.0,3/25/2013,The food is really good and affordable. The service is good. The drinks are a waste of money. They're expensive and hardly have any alcohol in them. Don't waste your time or money coming here for drinks. Unless you get the beer. Their beer is great.
Chasuelo B.,"Riverside, CA",0,43,2,5.0,8/10/2015,"My boyfriend and I love to sit at the bar. It is an awesome environment! We love it. The servers at the bar are awesome. We know Jacklyn, Melissa, Christina, Mura, Cindy, Trevor, Sara, Sasha, and Rachel will always be AWESOME. They really care about getting to know us and talking with us. Every time we go, we hope to get served by them. They're the best!!"
Rex K.,"Moreno Valley, CA",9,28,,5.0,9/27/2014,"Lovely sit down place. Whether casual or a date setting, this place has you covered. Love the food. My favorite is the Brewhouse Blonde or Tatonka Stout paired with the Grilled Chicken Pasta and traditional wings for appetizers."
