Sophia C.,"Ridgway, CO",13,62,6,3.0,4/15/2014,"BJ's is amazing because the food quality is always consistent, but the service definitely is not. The only reason I'll go back is because I cant stay away from the BBQ boneless wings and cookies and cream pizookie. This location we have had the best of servers and worst. But hey that's what you get sometimes."
SmiLew T.,"Southern California, CA",6,118,11,5.0,4/29/2014,"We frequent BJ's at least 2-3 times per month. (Mostly happy hour) I had a huge problem at the BJ's which required me calling the corporate office. The district manager drove to Moreno Valley same day from OC, apologized profusely by phone and sent me a gift certificate for my entire party. The food is always great, outside of this one incident, the service is great and I appreciate the speed and concern the corporate office took with a customer complaint.....Yep, I'm a fan..."
Jose S.,"Moreno Valley, CA",10,69,14,4.0,8/2/2014,Four stars due to prices but the enlighted turkey burger bomb loved it beer great well go again
Eric H.,"Corona, CA",10,3,,5.0,12/21/2014,OMG... we had BJ's Restaurant Moreno Valley cater our Foster Parent Association Christmas party this year and they were absolutely amazing !!!!!! We could not have asked for more. The food was Awesome... the service Amazing... a truly perfect job. Thanks guys. Eric.
w c.,"Riverside, CA",7,137,11,1.0,2/22/2014,We just had the most awful customer service today with Christina c. Never had this lousy and sloppy service. Very disappointed.
Jennifer N.,"Carson, CA",227,168,81,4.0,6/14/2012,My friends and I came here around lunch time. We were seated fairly quickly. Service was good. Nothing to really complain about. Although the food at times took a little bit longer than I liked but thats probably due to kitchen problems.  LOVE LOVE LOVE the pizookie!!!
Monique F. S.,"Moreno Valley, CA",10,14,7,1.0,2/28/2014,I didn't particularly are for this visit. The waitress told us one dinner came with a salad then came back 10 minutes later and said oh that doesn't come with a salad anymore. Then towards the end we ordered the new salted caramel pazooki and in the mean time while we were waiting she brought the bill and paid it. After paying she came and said oh we don't have that pazooki right now. I know that's not her fault but she still could've came and told us BEFORE we paid that way it could've been taken off the total price
Kon E.,"San Jacinto, CA",22,6,2,1.0,1/24/2014,Horrible service today. They've been ignoring us. Never refilled my ice tea and I've been waiting for our to go box forever. On their birthday no less.
Ala C.,"Portland, OR",19,5,,1.0,2/27/2015,"I recently took a visit to Bj's with a friend, as soon as we enter the restaurant we are ignored completely for about 7 minutes by both attendants at the from desk. I approached the worker and received a very cold response as if I was in the wrong for even entering the facility. After my cold welcome I was then brushed off and ignored for another 5 minutes before once again approaching the worker letting her know nicely we had been waiting to be added to the wait list, once again the worker was very cold and pretended to jot down our names as to be called for seating. I waited 5 more minutes watching as the workers seat 3 parties that had arrived after us, the entire time this happened the manager stood by laughing with the workers instead of correcting the situation. As my friend and I discussed complaining and writing a bad review for the 2 workers and manager, one of the front desk clerks overheard our conversation and scurried to seat us immediately. If it wasn't for our awesome lively waiter I would rate this joint a 0."
Jessica L.,"Los Angeles, CA",124,65,2,2.0,6/29/2015,Second time coming to this location and second time receiving bad service. Probably won't be coming back anytime soon even though it's the only one by my job.
Teresa E.,"Upland, CA",31,24,8,2.0,4/13/2016,"This I my second time dining at this location with my coworkers for lunch. The first time, the customer service was so bad, the manager gave us 20% off of our meal. We tried it out again for lunch and the service was terrible. It seemed that the staff was annoyed that we ordered the food for dine-in online. We were seated in the back corner of the restaurant. Both the woman who seated us and the woman who brought the food out were ice cold, no smiles, and seemed to have bad attitudes. There seemed to be resentment about us ordering the dine in meals. The woman who brought out the pre-ordered food was very rude, not smiling and slammed the food on the table. The gentlemen who served us food was very pleasant. When we ordered desserts, first we were told we could not order beignets. I asked the server to please find out for sure if they were unavailable. She followed up and found out that beignets were available. She brought us the birthday pizookie for the birthday in our party. Then, the rude woman who initially seated us brought the beignet out. We asked her for plates and she brought us 2 plates and 4 spoons. We were a party of 6 hoping to share our pizookie and beignet. Why did she bring 2 plates? Not only did she bring the plates, but she slammed them on the table and walked away. We had to wait for our server to return to bring us 4 more plates. As we waited for plates we decided to use the plate the pizookie was on for someone to put their dessert on. The plate was covered in what looked like dried marinara sauce. They simply put a napkin on top of it and the pizookie pan on top. That is gross! Needless to say BJ's-Moreno Valley is now a last resort for our office to visit for lunch, and probably even with our families and friends. It was pretty disappointing."
Lady T.,Inland Empire,0,79,1,3.0,7/12/2014,"Friday night!The wait for a table for two was very short. Our waiter made recommendations on the 4 glass beer sampler that we got based on our tastes.He did a great job!We decided to order the CA flatbread and two Caesar salads. We didn't see an option for a side Caesar salad on the menu but the waiter said it wouldn't be a problem.Twice a different runner/waitress tried to leave other peoples orders at our table which was kind of annoying.On the third try it really was our order.The atmosphere was typical late night casual and lively. Pros:The food and beer were tasty.The waiter was helpful,and professional.          Cons-I saw some left over pieces of food tucked in between the wall and the seat cushion upon sitting down.I didn't really expect to see that at a place like this.I hate to say it, but the menu was quite large and a bit overwhelming.There were a lot of choices with lengthy descriptions and it was hard to find staples like side Caesar salads."
Patrick L.,"Walnut, CA",407,50,38,2.0,5/10/2014,"Been here a couple times with friends. The place is nice and clean. The service is good. The food is decent. Everything is pricey for what you get. Not much to say about this except that it's just like any other BJ's Restaurant. Also, the wait time for the food depends on what everyone else at your table ordered because they like sending all of the food out at the same time."
Patricia R.,"Riverside, CA",19,29,3,5.0,6/17/2014,"I have yet to be disappointed here. Today was Free Pazookie Day and BJ's just launched an incredible new app for your smartphone! I used it to get on the Preferred Wait List for advanced seating and even though it was incredibly crowded, our wait was less than 5 mins. Also using the app, I preordered our drinks, apps, salads and free dessert. Bethany was a fantastic waitress, very attentive, even though frazzled and a bit overwhelmed with how busy it was. My only complaint was the asparagus, with the delicious Cherry Chipotle Grilled Salmon, were not cooked long enough and super hard to chew. Other than that, Bethany never let our glasses empty, nor finished plates pile up. We also got $5 off $20 for using the app, bonus! Can't wait to come back!"
Steve P.,"Moreno Valley, CA",46,9,16,5.0,8/30/2012,Great salad. Great beer. Hangin out with my best friend at one of my favorite places
Tony G.,"San Bernardino, CA",1,12,1,4.0,7/7/2013,"Visited 7/2/13.  Our waitress was Lindsay (awesome attitude!) who was genuinely nice and very attentive even though it was very busy.  My family and I were there for quite some time talking, enjoying our food and didn't once feel rushed.   Appetizers-Stuffed Mushrooms (amazing!), Corn fritters.  I had the Mahi Mahi Fish tacos, my mom-Fried Chicken on a bed of yummy mashed potatoes, my grandma-Enlightened Thai Chicken Mango Salad which we all enjoyed.   I've been visiting BJ's for many years and I've always had a great experience along with great food.  What really helps a lot are wonderful waiters/waitresses who really appreciate their job and take pride in providing excellent service.   Thank you and will see you soon! =-)"
Jess C.,"Los Angeles, CA",55,111,2,3.0,6/24/2012,This is one of the better spots in Mo Val for beers and dining and the parking lot reflects that. Everyone and their mom is here on a Friday night! It's your run-of-the-mill BJ's just like any location but I would recommend it as one of the better dinner spots in Moreno Valley.
Jacquelin S.,"Indio, CA",3,21,,1.0,11/7/2014,This would have been my first time but we didn't get in the door because of our guide puppy.  They wouldn't let us on the patio either.  This guide puppy has been to fine dining restaurants so not sure why BJ 's has this policy .   Anyways we've been to every restaurant around them with admittance to all and it's no loss other than there's.  Sorry for Bj's not us!
Jo K.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,9,,5.0,9/5/2015,I love this place. Food and service is great. If something is not to your standards they really try and make it right. Yes I would recommend this place.
Aaron S.,"Murrieta, CA",457,323,8,2.0,6/12/2012,"Whenever I don't get pizza, I regret it.. which was just once. I got some pasta thing (scampi on angel hair?) and it was just blah. Always get the pizza! Great White mmm mm. Good drinks too. Piranha Pale Ale is pretty tasty and their fun little soda mixes are good too... The lack of anything yum to eat besides the pizza (oh, and pizookie.. but that's a given) means I can't go over 2 stars.. If you want something eerily similar in food/price/atmosphere go to Yardhouse.. better food and drinks and much prettier waitresses!"
