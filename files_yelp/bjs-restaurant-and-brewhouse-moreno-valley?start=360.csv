Jason P.,"Winston-Salem, NC",36,61,30,2.0,7/10/2012,"Usually when I go to a BJ's it is pretty full, but my recent visit had it kind of light. I figured we'd be in and out pretty fast, boy was a I surprised there. There were plenty of servers as our area had 2 for the 4 tables they served. It took a mere 2 minutes before we placed our drink and appetizers, but it took 20 minutes (ya I was actually watching the clock at this point) to get our drinks, and 47 minutes to get the appetizer (was an order of spinach artichoke dip). The appetizer was not brought to us by our server so we had to wait almost 10 minutes before we could place our order. So being there an hour all we saw was an appetizer and the 2 drinks we ordered (ya no refills occurred). Almost exactly 45 minutes later we received our meal (Hamburger and fries for me [nothing complicated], and a calazone [real simple]), that was 45 more minutes without a refill even after trying to flag our server down several times. The food was alright, it was still not very crowded and I am beginning to know why. We almost went to the Buffalo Wild Wings across the street, and we really should have. I won't be coming to this place ever again."
Jasmine C.,"Redlands, CA",52,34,20,3.0,3/10/2014,"Called a half hour before arriving to put a group of 6 on the wait list. Arriving there, parking was difficult (Saturday night). When we got into the restaurant, I said my name and the host said 20 minutes. Upon stepping outside, we got buzzed backed in. Very quick. The waiter seemed nice at first, but got very distracted. It took us 20 minutes wait to get his attention. He even took the table that sat before us order. Their group size was about the same. Food was ok. Appetizers like the stuffed mushrooms only have only 6 caps in there. The spinach artichoke dip was ""mayonnaise-y."" We got the deep dish Mediterranean and the flat bread sweet pig (both large). It was enough for our group."
Tiffany P.,"Los Angeles, CA",864,433,1378,2.0,8/24/2009,"**BIRTHDAY (BIG GROUP) REVIEW** I've been to BJ's plenty of times for dinner and drinks and had a fine time, but I had a rather different experience when I went last night for my buddy's birthday, so I thought it deserved its own review... SEATING: We had reservations for 14, so you would think they would set aside tables for us... nope.  We had to wait almost half an hour for people to get up so that they could put tables together for us.  We were huuunnngry by the time we finally sat down. SERVICE: Our waitress was very friendly and helpful... that's the only good thing I can say.  Salads came out at odd times (some early, some with meals), food took a long time.  Drinks took a long time as well.  ALSO, the bartender didn't know the recipe for the drink I wanted... and it was a standard IBA drink!  Grr. FOOD: Yes, the food was good.  Thank goodness.  My boyfriend devoured his full rack of ribs (monstrous-looking!) and I really liked my fries and burger melt.  Well-seasoned, well-cooked.  I was impressed that they cooked my burger patty correctly.  I sampled my friend's pizookie (some kind of triple-chocolate thing) and it was orgasmic aaaaaaaaaaahhhh.  So rich and yet not overwhelming. BIRTHDAY TREAT:  My birthday buddy got 2 pizookies with candles (why 2? I don't know... and I also don't know if they were free or if someone paid), and the waiters came over to sing.  Very cute. PAYMENT:  Pain in the ass.  We wanted separate checks and the waitress said that would be totally fine, but 1) she couldn't print just one for my friends who wanted to leave early, so they had to wait for all the checks to get printed and 2) it took FOREVER for them to print out all the checks and do that stuff.  The waitress apologized and said it always takes a long time to do this.  Now, I don't understand what system they're using, but I have never been to another restaurant where they've taken so damn long to do this. BJ's is still a solid restaurant that I'd recommend for an ordinary outing, but you may want to think twice about bringing a big group."
Jodi M.,"Riverside, CA",734,321,46,4.0,7/2/2013,"It's been a while since I've eaten at a BJ's Brewhouse, but they are a favorite of mine.  This is the first time I've been to this location, and the experience was good.  It was a very hot summer day, but inside it was quite comfortable.  The food and service were great.  I don't get out to Moreno Valley too often, but if I'm in the area again, looking for a place to eat, this will certainly be a place I'd return to."
Dr. Catherine L.,"Moreno Valley, CA",517,127,93,3.0,3/6/2012,"I hate looking for parking for this BJ's location. Parking is usually horrible. The wait to be seated at a table also takes FOREVER. Altogether, food is good.. ambiance and set up is good.. price is decent to slightly expensive.. portions are fairly big.. and I do like how bday celebrants get a free pazookie. Very nice of em. =)"
Chris T.,"Riverside, CA",65,124,359,4.0,12/19/2011,"Needed a Girl`s Night Out and met up with some friends at Bj`s. Sat in the bar area because they had a happy hour, but we couldn`t order just yet because their happy hour started at 3pm. Ordered a Mango Iced Tea and a Strawberry Lemonade and started with one of their small bites while we waited for another friend to show up. We ordered two Fresh Mozzarella and Tomato Salads because their small bites, are literally, small bites. Small plates that are a perfect appetizer for one. It was very good. Tasted better than I thought it was going to taste. The fact that the menu said ""fresh,"" I hesitated a little because it sometimes isn`t fresh as they say, but my friend ensured me that it was good. And she was right. The small balls of mozzarella are soft and tender. The cherry tomatoes are cut into quarters and are really juicy and sweet. The salad also comes with basil and red onions. To top it off, they drizzle a balsamic glaze over everything and it`s pretty good. When our other friend finally arrived, she got a raspberry lemonade and started with the Avocado Eggrolls (now that it was happy hour), which seems to be a favorite at Bj`s. I love avocado and the many times I`ve been to Bj`s, I`ve never ordered them. Now`s my chance to finally try them after all this time. We also ordered our entrees. We each got a sandwich. I got the Grilled Chicken Club (without bacon) and my friends got the California Chicken Sandwich and the Crispy Chicken Sandwich, all with shoestring fries. As we chit-chatted for a while, the Avocado Eggrolls came out and they looked really good. They are stuffed with tons of avocado, cream cheese, and sun-dried tomatoes and they come with this sweet sauce to dip with. For the first time having them, I have to say, it is now a favorite of mine too. When our sandwiches came out, I was ready to dig in. Mine had grilled chicken breast with avocado, lettuce, tomato, swiss cheese, and a roasted garlic mayonnaise. Yummy. My friend who got the California Chicken sandwich had grilled chicken breast, avocado, green chiles, jack cheese, with chipotle mayo and ranch dressing. And my other friend who got the Crispy Chicken sandwich, hers had crispy fried pieces of chicken, lettuce, tomatoes, and honey mustard. We knew we wanted to save room for a little something extra, so we ate half of what we ordered, boxed the rest and looked over the menu again. I really wanted dessert, so I ordered the Cookies `N Cream Pizookie while my friends got cocktails: Mango Mojito and Ultimate Long Island. The pizookie was SO GOOD! Chocolate cookie made with Oreos, three small scoops of vanilla bean ice cream, and whipped cream. So yum... I love a good dessert at the end of a yummy meal."
Diana M.,"San Jose, CA",26,149,78,4.0,8/11/2011,Lunch Pasta and a side ceasar Salad. Yummy BF had a Calzone and it was very good too.
Gina G.,"Perris, CA",0,1,,4.0,5/25/2014,I was really skeptical about Bj's but I love there food I go at least 2x a month.....There salads are great and there southern fried chicken is bomb as well as there parmessan encrusted chicken is fabulous. ....love there burgers and wings......you definitely have to try them .....The people that wait on you are fabulous as well.....try them......you got to try there pizzookie.
Cesar L.,"San Diego, CA",1,7,8,2.0,4/15/2014,"Food is great at any bjs, but the service at this one I couldn't believe how bad it was. We orders the chicken wings and I asked for extra ranch and BBQ sauce and it never came. Also the waitress never came by to see if we needed refills on our drinks."
Caitlin Y.,"Long Beach, CA",63,90,165,3.0,11/23/2011,"BJ's has yummy food and their portions are pretty good. It reminds me of a more casual Cheesecake Factory. Sadly, since I have moved to Riverside for school... I have been let down time after time with service. Every waiter/waitress we get seem to have attitudes, are skimping on attentiveness and have even gotten our orders wrong. But, the past service that I have gotten at this one in Moreno Valley has been better than the one in Rancho Cucamonga."
David S.,"Moreno Valley, CA",18,3,,5.0,8/6/2014,Love this place. The food is always good and the brews aren't too bad either. The service is always been great when me and the wife have gone. We've never waited too long to be seated or helped. Nice place to go all around.
Nickolas B.,"Riverside County, CA",16,19,,4.0,2/28/2014,Bj's is a good spot if you want to go out to eat in moval. I recommend the Mac and cheese. Kevin is a good waiter and knows how to time the food properly. If you have Kevin five stars but some of the others rush the food and have your main plate coming out before your appetizers.
Nixely F.,"San Diego, CA",0,13,2,3.0,6/20/2014,Very clean. The waitress was really nice! The pizza was not the best it was pretty cold but the avocado egg rolls for appetizer were the best !
Jade L.,"Woodland Hills, CA",196,37,15,3.0,3/13/2011,"daaayum, I detested coming here before because the service was poop. BUT! my last server, this cute asian chick I think her name was Sandra went above and beyond and changed my mind.  Now, keep in mind I wasn't really in the mood to drive far for my birthday dinner, so I gave up and said Let's go to BJ's I want a pizzokie!!!.... First off, I failed and didn't make a reservation. But it was chill and they still got us a table for 15.   Then, I failed again! and underestimated how many folks were coming because nobody knows how to RSVP anymore. So this girl accommodated my party added a bunch of tables on, separated the checks, constantly kept coming back to check on us. The food didn't take long at all and my alcoholic thirst never went dry! She was fabulous. I ended up with about 25+ people on the outdoor patio area and everyone was satisfied! I hope that I get this great service again, g'job BJs!"
Laurel F.,"Moreno Valley, CA",8,4,,2.0,4/20/2014,By far the worst BJ's around. BJ's has always been one of my favs but I won't be visiting the Moreno Valley one again. For starters it smells bad-like rancid rags and sweat. I took my son there to celebrate his report card and it took over thirty minutes for us to get a burger and a taco. Managers and servers walked by us but never mentioned why it was taking so long or checked on us. The wait ruined our time and my two sons wondered why I though BJs was so great.
Juana S.,"Perris, CA",0,1,,5.0,6/12/2014,"I always have excellent service. Best beginnings appetizer is great. The pizza is always delicious and very filling. But the main reason why I visit often is for the bartender Melissa. She is awesome, by far the best server/bartender I've met. Don't be skeptic to sit up at the bar. I give u my word you won't regret it."
Cinthya T.,"Temple City, CA",1,6,2,5.0,5/29/2014,"Just left. Happy tummy! Our waitress was Erica. It is a clean, nice looking place. Was about $60 for two. Dinner , 3 beers, and desert. Customer service was awesome.  I loved Erica, she was sweet, attentive,  and prompt. This is my second time there, and we will be going back. We will def. Be asking for her to be our waitress, and eating another pizooki. Yumm!!! If you dont get anything else, at least get that!!!"
Kevin K.,"Alhambra, CA",396,100,4,2.0,2/19/2011,"On and off experiences here. One day they'll be cool and everything, next day my server won't ever come to check on me. BJ's food isn't bad so I wouldn't mind taking it out to go. I would just be sure to avoid some of the waiters/waitresses.  Pizookie is, hands down, the best thing at this place."
Jerry C.,"Riverside, CA",206,44,15,4.0,11/25/2013,"A great place for clients and family meetings and fun.  Love the selection and consistancy of the food and service.  Parking sucks.  So sad, as the establishment deserves better!"
