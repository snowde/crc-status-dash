Nathan S.,"Moreno Valley, CA",9,34,4,3.0,10/11/2013,"Food is usually good. Service is def hit or miss. If you get seated in the back, expect slow service."
Lyndsey J.,"Redlands, CA",0,13,,1.0,4/27/2015,"Customer service was awful, and it wasn't even busy in there. Took forever for our waitress to get our drinks. Won't be going back again"
Shelley H.,"Riverside, CA",217,174,1193,3.0,10/28/2012,"We were seated at a table right away.  Ordered a mini veggie pizza and wedge salad sans bacon. The salad was good but lacked toppings and was small for the price. The pizza came out room temperature. The server seemed apologetic and brought out a piping hot replacement, however the taste wasn't spectatular. The crust was chewy and soft rather than crunchy. The atmosphere is nice and spacious, however food was mediocre. The menu is extensive-maybe will try something besides pizza next time."
Kyle S.,"Woods Cross, UT",0,4,,5.0,3/31/2015,"First off, food was fine (Hawaiian Mahi Mahi) and beer was excellent (Seasonal, Committed DIPA... I don't know what the ""D"" stands for) I don't normally rate restaurants... so why tonight?  I started out my night with an average bartender: busy and not too conversational but taking care of me just fine.  Then in comes Jacklyn.  Never before have I seen a bartender pour so many beers/other drinks at the same time with such skill.  I watched her pull three beers from the tap while making two mixed drinks on the side.  All five were made to perfection as far as I could tell.  Jacklyn didn't break a sweat.  Sure, she's a pretty blonde but I PROMISE I envied her for her masterful drink-dispensing skills.  The patrons around me, as well as myself, were constantly attended to while I was there.  People that have a hard time waiting for their food and drinks should sit at the bar and let Jacklyn make things happen.  Things happen fast and, before you even had a chance to tell your date how busy the restaurant is, your food and beer/girly drink is in front of you ready for consumption"
Gina T.,"Moreno Valley, CA",399,32,25,5.0,6/9/2013,So far I have been there 3 times and I love it. The staff are nice and deliver great quality of service. The food is very good. I'm gonna go back and try more
Hanson H.,"Rowland Heights, CA",250,103,,3.0,8/9/2011,"Food quality is good, but most of the dishes are a bit on the salty side. Shaving two bucks off the price of everything on the menu would easily attract even more customers to this establishment.  They have a great selection of drinks. Happy hour is the best time to be here. Staff was very polite and prompt, and the pizzas are absolutely loaded (but, again, REAL salty)."
Rae T.,"Moreno Valley, CA",271,352,708,3.0,5/15/2011,"Dining in experience is always good...take out...food and service are bad. Once they had put all the nacho ingredients separate, then forgot the cheese. The pizza was undercooked big time. We've complained before and gave them a few more chances, but no improvement. Dining in is good when hanging out with friends and they do have decent service. The food is ok."
Michael F.,"Riverside, CA",231,27,2,2.0,1/17/2011,"First of all I love going to a BJ's and getting a pizza, a beer, a pizzookie, a lunch special whatever. But that is BJs in general.  This one is different. It seems everytime I go there I get this one spikey haired waitress that seems to hate me and my gf for wanting to enjoy a meal. How dare we! Seriously, she never smiled, hardly came to our table, and when we ordered she asked ""what kind of soup do you want?"" and I said clam chowder. I didn't know that it didn't come with the meal and cost almost $7. The food is always good here, but I can go to another place and not get treated like dirt. I'm sure i'll still come here due to random cravings for pizzookies. Hopefully that waitress gets fired for punching her boss in the face or something."
Alexis A.,"Beaumont, CA",174,8,,4.0,11/29/2013,"The wait for a Friday night was not bad all. Our waitress for the night was Sarah B... She was definitely on top of her game! We did the $20 special tonight: 2 soups or salads, 1 medium pizza ( chicken bacon ranch & half pepperoni extreme ), with 1 small pazookie! The price was right and the beer was tasty! I'll be saving my left overs for a nice meal tomorrow."
Rae C.,"Buena Park, CA",2,28,36,1.0,9/27/2010,"I love BJ's. But NOT this particular one. Horrible service. Food is not great either. When we entered the restaruant, there was no one at the front to guide us to the table. The place wasnt busy at all. I saw plenty of empty seats. After fifteen mintues of just standing there, someone finally guide us to the table. The waitress came twenty mintues after and that was only because we had to walk up to the random waitress to take our order. The food took forever too. and we didnt even had our utensils. I would understand for little delay if the place was packed. but the place wasnt busy at all. And our waitress just dissapears and she obsiously didnt care about us. Dont come to this place if you want friendly and fast service."
Ryan C.,"Perris, CA",142,17,10,2.0,1/1/2013,"I have been here many times but this time was good until we received our food. So I was just eating, enjoying my Grilled Chicken Pasta. However, my brother Ralph, didn't enjoy his New Orleans Jambalaya. He was half way through his food until he discovered an unusual ingredient, a chewed peppermint gum. Wow!!! Really??? Who does that???? That is just disgusting and unprofessional right there. I'm guessing one of chefs was pissed that day or something, they just wanted to play games or was too lazy to throw their gum away. So our server took the Jambalaya off our bill and got 2 free Pizookie which was cool. Overall, the service was great, I don't know about the chefs working in the back. All I have to say to the Manager, all ways keep an eye on your workers or do a better job on the hiring process for chefs."
Jayden L.,"Arcadia, CA",0,94,4,3.0,7/9/2013,"The waiters are generally attentive and friendly. The food sucks, always has always will but their beer and pizookies are the bomb! especially the oreo pizookie."
Adrianne R.,"Atlanta, GA",924,239,295,2.0,2/3/2011,"Ive been  here several times, and not one time have I been completely satisfied, the service is horrible. One your seated the waiters and waitresses seem like they dont want to be there..I mean I know people have their days but everytime I go I get upset. Either they forget about you or they are very rude. food is ok. Only thing I really care about is the pazookie anyway.They can keep their service and their horrible customer service."
Norissa R.,"Hemet, CA",6,19,17,4.0,6/23/2013,I only ate desert the pazookie of course it was so yummy service was fast and friendly
Tony K.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,250,4,3.0,10/27/2012,"Everything was ok , nothing special. Seems they tack on higher prices to help pay for the 'Sports Bar attitude' we aren't into that so I don't see the need to come back here. We didnt have the best service as i had to wait and wait for refills. The guy who brought our food ask if we needed anything else and i said refllls ! but he said he doesnt do that and would tell whoever we needed refills and we waited and waited again ? If you like beer and TVs while you eat then this your place."
Lin L.,"Banning, CA",35,58,31,2.0,8/13/2014,"Generally, when I come to any of the BJs chains, I receive decent service. However, my experience on 7/25/14 was the very lacking, to say the least. Not sure if our waitress Cherie L (per the receipt) was having one of the worst days of her life or what but she didn't say more than five words to me or my two friends the whole time we were there. It took her ten minutes to bring us water, another ten minutes to come back after that to take our orders, and twenty-five minutes after receiving our food to refill drinks. Also, our silverware was dirty and she gave us attitude because she had to give us a new set. Lastly, I waited more than ten minutes for her to take my payment which she never came back so I had to chase her down (along with another customer) to the register to ring us up. I felt so bad for my friends who have never been there before to experience such horrible service that I paid the bill since I chose that place. I shouldn't have left a tip but I figured leaving a little bit could help her afford to pull that stick out of her ass... Maybe just even a little so the next customers wouldn't have to experience such horrible service. Get a different server if you come here."
Cynthia W.,"Riverside, CA",6,55,6,5.0,6/4/2012,This BJ's has friendly people from the moment you walk in. Great atmosphere and the food is delish! I come for the wings and definitely recommend them.  I usually order A Drink Like That and the last time I was there (happened to be Happy Hour) had 3 of them :)
Jack J.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,17,9,3.0,3/7/2011,"Although I have never had anything against BJ's (It was a popular late night spot when I was at school in LA), this BJ's has been lackluster the last few times I have been in.  I am almost always seated in the far corner of their ""side-room,"" even after requesting I not be seated there. The server's, although friendly, are far too busy to provide decent service. I shouldn't have to flag a busser down for my first refill on my diet coke, 30 minutes into my meal. Despite the poor service, the food is well above average. I'd recommend splitting a Flatbread pizza along with their more traditional deep dish tomato pizzas, as both kinds are hot and delicious. If you love avocado then get the Egg Rolls as well.   Of course anyone who has ever been to BJ's knows to save room for desert. I have yet to get tired of the chocolate chip pazookie.  I do like the chain, i just don't care for this particular location. However bad the service a warm pazookie can always soften a bad night."
Don F.,"Moreno Valley, CA",4,158,,4.0,3/17/2013,"Nice restaurant and usually very busy, nice bar with lots of TV's and sports programming. My fave pizza is here (Buffalo Chicken) with an ice cold honey blond beer is the bomb. Friday and Saturday evenings are very busy and the bar gets packed, a little loud but I really like BJ's."
Jeno K.,"Moreno Valley, CA",6,19,,2.0,4/9/2010,"Are you looking for an overpriced menu with mediocre food and horrible service?  Then BJ's Moreno Valley is your place to go!  Their god awful wait staff will make sure that you sit at your table hungry for over an hour! If that's not enough, they will also throw in a hefty dose of attitude, for FREE!  Service with a smile, not here.  Customer is always right, definitely not.   In all seriousness, I have had several horrific experiences with the wait staff.  Keep in mind, this is NOT TRUE for all BJ's Restaurants, just of this particular one (I have had good experiences with service in Rancho).  The drink prices are decent and they have a good selection of beer on tap.  Here is a little tip: avoid getting a table (you will most likely have to wait for over an hour on a busy night).  If you can (assuming that you're over 21), sit directly at the bar.  I have usually had positive experiences with the bar tenders.  If you're going to order food, I would only recommend the Pizza and appetizers.  Also, Be prepared!  If you are going to have a large group of people, tell them to split the check BEFORE they take your order.  If you ask them to split it after your meal, be prepared for an attitude.   In short: Pizza = Good.  Beer = Okay. Service = The worst. ** I gave a low rating MAINLY because of service..."
