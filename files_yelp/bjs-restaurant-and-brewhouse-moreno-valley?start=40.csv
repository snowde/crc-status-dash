Lenny A.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,14,15,3.0,8/31/2017,"Honestly I think it depends on what day I come to BJ's, somedays my order is really good and sometimes it's not. The Staff are friendly and welcoming"
Yasmine F.,"Corona, CA",0,8,4,2.0,2/17/2017,"I always come to this BJs and they're usually good, which is why I gave it a 2 instead of a 1. Tonight it was TERRIBLE; a definite ""1 Star"". We ordered an Irish Mule and an Alabama Sunset. Both were filled with ice completely with barely any of the actual drinks (which were really good. TOO BAD WE ONLY GOT SIPS OF THEM). I DO NOT eat red meat and ordered salmon pita tacos. The quinoa salad it came with had a long piece of hair in it and my salmon taco had a chunk of bacon in it. REALLY? The chef came out and apologized, and offered me a meal. That was nice but I was already over it and lost my appetite.  Like I said. This place is usually great but tonight was a mess. The manager, who didn't seem to care much at all, said that that's how the drinks are made and apologized for the hair and bacon. All I know is that my dinner was ruined and I'm taking a break from this place. My entree and drink were taken off my tab (not something I ever ask for but tonight was way too much). I hope they get it together.  Oh and clean those greasy floors! It was so slippery that one woman fell and almost broke her hip!"
Alizen R.,"Irvine, CA",778,295,942,2.0,12/13/2015,"Though this was not my first time coming to BJ's, it was certainly one of the most disappointing visits I have had in years.  I came to celebrate my roommate's 21st birthday and despite the fact that they could not make reservations for us on the day of the event, we decided to come around 9pm to try our luck with seating. After waiting about half an hour for a party of 8, we were seated in a relatively slow section--which I always take for a good sign since that means faster service! I forget the name of our server but I suppose it doesn't matter. Her lackluster personality and unprofessional behavior made it hard for me to take her seriously. She didn't card half of my party and the other half only got carded because they had their IDs out. I find this very unprofessional and unsafe as underage guests could have just as easily ordered alcoholic beverages without her knowledge. I'd be a little more careful with a liquor license, but since she was complaining about how late she was working I guess she didn't care about getting the company in trouble either.  The food, on the other hand, was quite delicious! I ordered a bowl of broccoli cheddar soup for $5.95 and though I wish it was a little less creamy it sure hit the spot. For my alcohol of choice I started with a Blood Orange Pom Sangria for $8.25 and a Piranha Pale Ale for $5.50 afterwards. The sangria would've tasted much better without the Fireball whiskey in it but regardless it still did the job.  Towards the end of the night I asked our server for the check. She came back about ten minutes later and took a seat next to me, only to start complaining about how tired she was because she went out the night before and was so hungover that working that day was just a regrettable decision. I asked her how long she had been working and she said 4 hours. I couldn't tell what I found more off putting, the fact that she blatantly did not care about how terrible her behavior was or how badly she portrayed the employees of this restaurant. Either way, I was not impressed.  When we finally got our bill, she got one thing correct: my roommate's birthday. Despite the amount of times we asked her for Parmesan cheese and a myriad of other condiments, at least she managed to bring the birthday pizookie out.  Overall, I am very disappointed in this restaurant. I understand that employees are only human, but considering the fact that her section was relatively empty and it wasn't a busy dinner time at all, I would have appreciated better and more professional service."
Teresa G.,"Beaverton, OR",2,22,,3.0,8/12/2017,"Decent beer selection. I chose a Stone IPA that was good. The server got my order completely wrong (she brought me the wrong thing altogether) and. in my opinion, an apology isn't enough for a big mistake like that. The salad I did order was pretty good, and I really appreciate that they put calorie counts on the menu."
Justine M.,"Riverside, CA",0,13,4,1.0,8/23/2017,Waited 20 minutes after being seated until I decided to leave due to lack of service. Walked over to Olive Garden and received much better service!
Chris N.,"Oceanside, CA",0,24,8,5.0,11/10/2017,"Great place to meet up with friends and family. The food selections are great to either share or feed yourself. The last two times I have gone here, the beer was cold, the football games were playing and the atmosphere was filled with cheer. Always a go to place!"
Eileen R.,"Riverside, CA",0,14,,5.0,11/18/2017,"Went on a date night with my boyfriend tonight. Let me just say we really lucked out finding this place. First, we got front row parking and when we got in, we got seated right away. We had a great waitress who greeted us right away and was very sweet. She was very courteous and gave us refills for our drinks when we needed. The food waa absolutely amazing. Everything was cooked to perfection. Overall, our food and service we received here was beyond expectation. We will definitely be returning. Had a wonderful experience :)"
Jason P.,"Riverside, CA",100,104,17,4.0,8/11/2017,"Eaten here many times over the years. Most of them for dinner, but sometimes for birthday parties. Always good quality food and drinks. The only negative is sometimes the wait, either to sit, or be served, is pretty much always a bit longer than expected. But worth the wait which is why we come back."
Renzo M.,"Vandenberg Air Force Base, CA",8,81,92,3.0,8/7/2017,Nothing really special about this place.  Nothing overly good or bad.  Oh yes Woody's whiskey sour was very good.  Very strong drink...really hit the spot.
Mau C.,"Beaumont, CA",3,8,3,3.0,8/12/2017,"Ordered their spaghetti and wasn't really a fan of it. It was bland and didn't finish it. But the service was great, the lady gave us what we need before we even asked for it. Place was good, clean and cool enough."
Frankie C.,"San Bernardino, CA",4,26,9,1.0,1/5/2017,"Sketchy service and shady business practices will make sure I never visit this place again. The service was horrible. About 20 minutes for a glass of water. Our food arrived and we never saw the server again. Later another server comes by and tells us the original server went him and she will be tending to us. After that we never saw her again until I waved her down for the bill. After being very unsatisfied with out service we just paid and left. Usually I would complain but it just wasn't worth it this time around. I did not leave a tip for the server because like I said, the service was horrible. A couple days later I check my statements and it seems the server helped themselves to a tip that I did not authorize. I was at a loss for words. I thought about calling back but I know I will get the run around and the $8 just isn't worth my time for that. I'll take it a step further and report it to the BBB. I hope the $8 serves them well, they most really need it.."
Carlos L.,"Ontario, CA",0,3,,1.0,8/16/2017,Worst take ever. Not only did they make me wait forever!! And I didn't even get everything I ordered.
Tim G.,"Riverside, CA",15,29,5,5.0,6/18/2017,"This one-day-before-father's-day visit to BJ's for their new Prime Rib dinner was the best visit to BJ's I've ever experienced. First of all, the ""15oz"" prime rib was probably closer to 25 ounces and tender and perfectly cooked. The clam chowder I had was also really good, but the baked potatoes we had were just ok. What made this a five-star meal instead of the solid 4-star it deserved, wasn't the food, but the service! Our server Isaiah was attentive, considerate and very friendly. At the end of our meal, not only did I give him more than the standard tip, I asked his name, shook his hand, and told him how great he had been. BJ's, this is a man who exemplifies great customer service, and I hope you recognize how good of an employee you have in Isaiah."
Conrad M.,"Perris, CA",0,8,7,5.0,7/31/2017,I came here with my GF on Saturday and it was really good! The food and service were amazing! My GF and I shared a BBQ chicken pizza and a pizookie and it was delicious! I think I liked the pizookie the most lol
Ray W.,"Lynn, MA",0,9,,5.0,4/4/2017,"Five Stars! I've never even been within 5 miles of your restaurant, but wow do you have pretentious folks visiting your restaurant! Good for you for dealing with this type of clientele and still staying open at all! I hope yelp lets this post just to balance out the fact that your crowd is absolutely insane. I just found this because I was looking to write a bad review for a voice chat host site. Good luck!"
Rian G.,"Riverside, CA",502,2,,5.0,8/20/2017,Nanci is the best server I've ever had! I've lived in Moreno Valley for years and her charm and customer service just impressed the whole table. She was very aware of our needs and positive! I'd use her as often as possible of course in a professional manner!
Anais J.,"Riverside, CA",380,25,10,4.0,10/25/2016,"Came in on a Tuesday night with my girlfriend and the first thing we witnessed was two separate families complaining to the manager about our waitress. We decided not to let it phase us and continued to order. Once the other waiters started bad mouthing other people though that was a definite red flag and worth the complaint to the manager because the entire environment felt awkward.  Mark is an exceptional manager. He diligently dealt with every complaint and worked with everyone's concerns with a great attitude. 5 stars to him for the recovery, that's the only reason I'm giving this place four stars."
Annie J.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,6,,5.0,8/22/2017,"Came here with a girlfriend for lunch and had a pleasant experience. Our waitress, Debbie, kept our water full and checked on us often. The manager came by a couple times too. I could see that they care about the customer here at this restaurant. It was my first time to BJ's. I see these restaurants at other locations but haven't tried them before now. If this is how good they treat me, I'll try others too."
Rita T.,"Perris, CA",0,26,,3.0,10/21/2017,The service was good everyone was cool real nice and helpful but the food just wasn't as good as it usually is my side salad was real dry but my friend had a ton of dressing on her salad which was weird we enjoyed our entree but what was shocking to me was the spinach and artichoke dip it was surprisingly extremely unbearably spicy I don't know what they were doing in that kitchen but something went wrong with that dip it was a terrible experience to have something as spicy as it was it was like that spinach and artichoke dip took a bath in some hot pepper juice we had to take it back I still like bjs but ima give this one a lil break before going back
Osbaldo V.,"Fontana, CA",62,3,,1.0,2/13/2017,"Does this restaurant believe in customer service?! Waited 40 minutes for my food. 3 kids meal, tacos and a hamburger.  No communication from our server.  Asked to speak to the manager who never showed up.  I tracked him down finally and his response ""no one told me"". I explained the situation and he apologized, looked at my receipt  apologized again and walked away. I will never come here again. The table behind us arrived 30 minutes after we did but they got their order within 5 minutes of us getting our food.  Ordered at 6:11, food arrived at 7:08!"
