Sean P.,"Riverside, CA",172,13,,4.0,5/10/2013,"i will be back. i loved the pizza and the service. if the rest of their menu tastes as good as their pizza,.. i will be a regular"
Chelsea M.,"Downtown, Los Angeles, CA",0,40,3,3.0,8/21/2014,"My glass had a huge crack in it. My friend sent back her shrimp scampi because it was flavorless, but they quickly replaced her meal. I feel compared to the other BJ's this location is a bit run down."
Christina W.,"San Mateo, CA",12,70,,1.0,2/16/2010,"The service here is so horrible that I'm actually boycotting this particular BJs. This location allows you to call ahead to put your name on their list for a table.  Knowing that there's always a long wait, my roommates and I decided to call ahead and they told us our table would be ready in about 30 minutes.  A lot of good that did!  We showed up 30 minutes later like they told us, only to have to wait another 30 minutes to be seated! After finally being seated, it took 15 minutes before our server even made his way to our table to greet us.  Then, once we got our orders in, it took over 45 minutes to get our food with ZERO visits from our server in the mean time!  I literally fell asleep at the table waiting for my food, and when it came it wasn't even good!   Never again."
Carla C.,"Baltimore, MD",23,18,31,2.0,11/13/2012,"Went here with a friend. Found a table near the bar rather quickly, but service was lacking. Waited awhile for a waitress to come by. This was surprising since the restaurant wasn't busy. Our food came out quickly but our inattentive waitress had not provided silverware, so I flagged down a bus boy  so our food didn't get cold. Food wasn't memorable and the service was so bad, I will not be returning."
Virginia S.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",0,18,2,4.0,1/10/2013,"Every time I eat here, the food is good. I think coming for lunch is best. Today our server was Roberto L and he was very helpful & attentive. The main reason we come to BJ's for lunch is for the great selection of entrees to choose from. I'd come here before Chili's any day."
Natalie G.,"Victorville, CA",214,175,76,4.0,7/30/2012,"seating is not too bad. service is ok.  food can sometimes be overcooked , but still good.  Happy hour is not too shabby but their alcohol is very expensive."
Robin S.,"Emeryville, CA",279,14,7,1.0,6/26/2013,"Family went on June 15, 2013 after my sons graduation from UC Riverside. Party of 10 and we waited 45 minutes to be seated. It was after 9:00pm and we were all very hungry. Order some appetizers and half the order never came. Waited one hour and no food. Talked with the manager and after 10 minutes the food came either cold or room temperature. It was going on 11:00 pm and we were frustrated and very hungry. She gave us a large desert and took a few items off the bill. This location I do not recommend."
Eilene R.,"Moreno Valley, CA",12,116,22,3.0,8/2/2012,Okay place. Would only go here if someone celebrates their birthdays here or any type of occasions. Their pizookie is bomb though..just get it at the grocery store. HAHA..
Lauren M.,"Irvine, CA",240,145,6,2.0,9/30/2009,"Probably one of the worst BJ's I've been to. It's standard fare, the food quality is exactly the same, but this BJ's has some of the worst quality in food service I've ever experienced. For one, the waitresses all seem to hate their job. I've worked in the food industry too and I know it can be tough, but these girls are really too much. They don't so much as greet you when they come over to ask for your drink order, they'll disappear for no shorter than 15 minute chunks at a time, and your food takes (LITERALLY) 45 minutes to come out. It's become so bad that whenever my friends come to this location we ask for the pizookie and the food at the same time, that way we don't end up spending 3 hours in there. If at all possible, go to a different BJ's location."
Bonnie P.,"Jurupa Valley, CA",180,342,83,3.0,3/20/2012,The food here is actually really good---I totally enjoyed it--BUT---if you want to have lunch and TALK to the other person at your table ---IMPOSSIBLE----it must be up to the bartender or the wait staff as to the noise level of the MUSIC---it is unbearable!!
Richard C.,"Riverside, CA",40,19,1,5.0,10/9/2012,"Absolutely love this place, the beer can be a little pricey but its amazing. The food is out of this world I either get the french dip, the pirahna pale ale chili cheeseburger, or the california turkey burger. And this restaurant stands by there word, if your order is incorrect or messed up its almost always free. Just don't think about trying to get beer without an ID even if you look old you will get carded and denied lol 2 thumbs up!!"
David F.,"Yuma, AZ",9,9,1,4.0,10/21/2010,"Stopped in on a sunday for lunch and to watch football. Good size bar area with plenty of large screens showing the games. Fairly large menu selection and decent beer. the california burger was tasty. Ordered a salad appetizer and they forgot to bring it out. Got the white chocolate macadamia nut pizookie, delicious! Overall a good sports bar/ casual dining experience."
Jordan B.,"Moreno Valley, CA",56,50,5,2.0,7/31/2012,"I don't particularly like THIS specific BJ's. I'm not sure why, but it just seems below par in comparison to the rest of the chains I've been to. So, I went here before a movie with a date I was with. Well, they cooked our steaks wrong. Not only wrong, but it didn't even look like it was edible, so we asked for another and explained why, they didn't charge us but we were there for about two and a half hours. The wait time is always terrible, the waiters often seem indifferent and can never remember who ordered what ( when there are only two people at the table, it just looks bad on their part). I only come to BJ's if I want dessert, personally. Their steaks aren't great and are expensive, the staff is okay, the environment is often very dim and I'm hard of vision, so it's basically like making me blind, which isn't my idea of a fun night."
David L.,"Fremont, CA",24,368,24,2.0,6/22/2009,"I would rate much of the food served at BJ as average to maybe decent.  Service was friendly but just very incompetent.  I hope the management would take notice and give some better training to the staff.   Our waiter was unable to anticipate any of our needs throughout the entire meal.  For example, our appetizer was served before any of our drinks arrived, and we actually had to ask for (and wait about 10 minutes) before our appetizer plates and silverware arrived.  Our waiter also neglected to ask us what we want as our side, or whether we want salad or soup (even though it comes with our entree choice).   I had the New York Strip Steak (12 oz, $18.95).  It does come with a choice of garden salad, Caesar's salad or soup, and a huge baked potato (huge, as it was longer than the size of my steak.  I had to ask for some A1 to go with my steak, because it just wasn't flavorful enough for me.    Bottom Line:  Mediocre food made worse with terrible service."
bruce r.,"Riverside, CA",0,28,,3.0,11/17/2011,"This is a very stable restaurant with very good service.  The staff are well trained if not a little robotic in their service, I can probably record the greeting on a Monday...come back in on Thursday and a different greeter would greet me with the exact phrase.  The food is above grade, the specialty salads are fresh and delicious, it is what keeps me coming back; although, looking around at the other tables, everything looks good.  I just can't shake that generic feeling when I come to the place, hence the 3 stars instead of 4."
Ben X.,"La Jolla, CA",24,200,22,3.0,1/26/2010,"Well, their stars don't improve because their service, for the most part, is still absolutely terrible. The waitresses are good at simple requests, like refills (they offer them quite often, actually) and if you want salad dressing on the side, but the wait... I really don't enjoy finishing dinner and sitting around maybe 15-20 minutes for a check. On the other hand, that new BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich is a favorite of mine now. Really tasty sandwich, that one. I think I'll get it again if I go again sometime."
Tim H.,"Crestline, CA",0,16,,3.0,5/13/2014,"Great service, decent eats, and free refill rootbeer.  The service is usually excellent and I haven't had any problems."
Lisa T.,"San Francisco, CA",7,34,31,4.0,2/16/2010,"My friend took me here for 21st birthday lunch. Since it was lunch time, it wasn't as busy as it is when its dinner time so I don't know why my order was messed up.  I ordered a California chicken sandwich which was supposed to have avocados. Instead I got a chicken sandwich that had jalapenos. I decided to just pick out the jalapenos and eat the sandwich than place my real order ( for fear that whoever was preparing my food would get angry and spit in it even though the customer is always right). The sandwich was good though. I was almost glad I didn't have it taken back but it would have been better if it had avocados.  I had a salad to start and fries on the side of my meal. They sure don't skimp on their portions! I was just about full from my salad! Me being a virgin with alcoholic drinks, we asked our waitress what woud be good for a virgin like me. She came back with a wicked caramel apple which obviously looked and tasted like a caramel apple. Great suggestion for a first timer and one who doesn't really enjoy the taste of alcohol!"
Jess C.,"Diamond Bar, CA",103,18,18,4.0,2/4/2012,"Great food, great portions. Love the caesar salad and the pizookie. They have a great staff and provide good service. If you don't like a dish, just let them know and they will try their best to get you something else. I.E. I ordered the Mediterranean Pizza and it was too sour for my taste due to the excessive olives and peppercinis so our waiter checked with the manager and I was able to order a different pizza without charge. Awesome! Lastly, they have a wide variety of beers, martinis, cocktails, and mocktails so I'm sure anyone will be able to find something that they enjoy!"
Julia H.,"New Castle, CO",26,93,18,2.0,8/5/2011,"Love the food, hate the service. My husband and I went to this restaurant around 4:30pm. We were seated almost immediately (had to wait for the hostesses to stop talking about what they were planning to do on their break). It took 20 minutes for our server to come to the table and take our drink and food order, then another half an hour for the food to arrive. Of course, the food was cold by the time it got to us. I flagged down another server (ours was nowhere to be found) and asked for a new order of fries. Sure...no problem. After waiting another half an hour a different server came to our table and asked us if we wanted dessert (we were still waiting for the new fries). We said no and she dropped off the bill and left (she wasn't our original server...guess he went on break or something?). We waited another 15 minutes for her to come back and take our credit card before flagging down someone else and making them run it for us.  After the experience, I emailed the restaurant and told them all about it. The general manager contacted me and offered a gift card, which I accepted. He said he would mail it but that was over a month ago, and I still haven't received it.  I love BJ's, but the service at this one really sucks. EDIT: We did receive the giftcard ($50...whoo-hoo!) Service was still slow."
