Monique M.,"Vallejo, CA",134,138,35,3.0,7/19/2011,"Decent, typical American food.  Menu is similar to Cheesecake Factory but the food does not quiet taste the same.    Service is great and always fast."
Helen S.,"Palm Desert, CA",14,29,3,5.0,6/25/2012,"The BEST food ever! Too bad this is far from where I live, but I occasionally make the drive in order to eat here. It is always worth the 40 minute drive!"
Rick H.,"Moreno Valley, CA",23,106,18,5.0,4/27/2009,"Love this place!  The beers are all representative of their styles, and the menu (standard brewpub faire) offers some really good entrees, as well as what is probably the best pizza from a chain restaurant.  The angel hair pasta dish is off the charts, and I always have them make my own pizza: artichoke hearts, black olives, and garlic.   The waitstaff is great, and there are wide-screen TV's all over the place.  Top it off with some tasty appetizers, a friendly clientele, and the fact that they're one of a very few places open late in MoVal, and you've got a winner."
Melissa S.,"Corona, CA",226,127,16,1.0,12/9/2010,"these are are letters my party wrote to moreno valley bj's about there service... they did nothing...never called... never cared.... so Im NEVER going back... and warning everyone of there horrible service. I am very sorry to say that I was supremely dissappointed with the moreno valley BJ's resturant. From begining to end of my parties' experience with this location was a disaster. We made reservations/ called ahead an hour early and still was seated after a party bigger then ours when they informed us we were first on the list. when we finally got seated a little over a half hour later we didnt get to place our order for another 15 min. we ordered everything at one, drinks(both alcohol and water), appatizers and meals. 15 min after ordering a few soups arrived, 30 min after ordering we still were not brought our drinks and our appatizers arrived. we then again asked for our waters. once we were finished with our appatizers our water was brought to the table. ten min later our regular drinks were brought. then another 15 min until our food was brought to the table yet still no silverware. to top it off, everytime our waiter was at our table he cut us off the help another table before we were finished. we finally sent someone at our table to find someone to bring us silverware and hurried to eat our meal because we had already spent too much time at this resturant and just wanted to leave. Before leaving we once again had a waiter at our table who again gave his attention prematurely to the table behind us. We then asked for our bill and the manager. The manager was no help at resolving any issues and proceeded to argue with us about how long we had been there. Ironically he was no where to be seen most of the night (we definitely looked for a manger throughout dinner) and didnt even know who our waiter was when he came to the table. We all left very disappointed and angry at the entire situation.  Dinner should not be a situation, it should be an experience, a happy one none the less. It is safe to say that the dinner service the at your moreno valley location was the worst any of us had had in a long time, or in some cases ever.  I hope this note will help isolate and solve any problems you may have within that location and bring better service to future customers.  p.s. Our bill was a little over $160 and we wouldnt have paid for service as poor as that nights even off the dollar menu at del taco, but we did pay only to suffice your company and quite frankly to get the hell out of there without any more problems.  I would like to say that I had the most horrible service at this location than I have at any other restaurant.. EVER. My group called ahead to place a ""reservation"" an hour before arriving. As soon as we got there the hostess said we would be next, when in fact that was not the case. There were several parties ahead of us that were the same size party as us that were seated before us. We waited over thirty minutes to be seated. Once we were seated we were given a table that was only big enough for four of us to really sit at, so we had to ask for a bigger table in order to comfortably be seated. We waited for over twenty minutes before our waiter even came over and introduced himself to us and to take our drink orders. That was including the waters. Waters should have already been on the table when we sat down. Also, while taking our orders our waiter flat out ignored us when another table asked for something, turned to the other table, and interrupted our orders, not once, but twice. At that point we stated that we were upset about waiting so long and that we wanted to place not only our drink orders but our food orders as well, and we even had to ask for water to be brought out. About 15-20 minutes later some soups were brought out, and we still did not have any water or any form of drinks, as well as no silverware. About 15 minutes after that our appetizers were brought out, still with no drinks and no silverware. At this point we were tremendously upset. For one, how are we supposed to eat our soups/appetizers without any silverware, and for two we had been waiting at your restaurant for over an hour without even getting a drink! About 15 minutes later our food was finally brought out to us, mine being cold, and others not exactly what they asked for. We tried to find a manager throughout this whole experience, yet couldn't even tell who was a manager. When we did finally talk to a manager we explained our concern about waiting so long to be seated and about our drinks and silverware taking so long, and he blatently ignored the whole facts and made excuses as to why the customer service was not up to par. Then we asked for some green onions for a baked potatoe we had ordered. When the waiter brought them out they were subpar, I wouldn't have even expected a fast food restaurant like Wendy's to give us that poor quality of food. .....  ( got cut off by yelp)"
John B.,"San Diego, CA",1,25,1,4.0,2/12/2013,"My wife and I were staying at a nearby hotel for one night and went to BJs because it was noted as offering gluten-free food.  The menu noted gluten-free items and care was taken with our order. Our first time at at BJs, and we were impressed. For dinner we ordered a gluten-free pizza and entree salad to share.  The pizza was delivered right out of the oven and was very tasty. Salad was big and hearty.  Service was pleasant and fast.  Decor is upscale and we were impressed.  A very pleasant meal.  We enjoyed it so much we ended up at another BJ's for lunch the next day. Recommended."
Maria R.,"Moreno Valley, CA",3,24,4,3.0,7/11/2011,"I love the look of this place, but I have trouble seeing because their lighting is too dim. I have been here several times and the food always takes a really long time! I don't really care for most of their main dishes except for their jambalaya which I love, but wish they would bring it down a notch on the spiciness. They plate everything nicely, but sometimes you run out of table space because of all the dishes they use. I really love their avocado egg rolls and the #1 reason I keep coming back is for their PIZOOKIE which is a warm cookie served with ice cream on top! Super yummy! Not a good place to take kids! They are a little on the expensive side, and I don't really care for their pizza. It's a little too doughy for my taste."
Chris B.,"Moreno Valley, CA",2,22,,4.0,10/14/2011,"Great food, great service (they're much better now, as opposed to when they were new and service sucked!).  Staff is always nice.  Only gets one star taken away because they are ALWAYS packed."
Rosas C.,"Orange, CA",69,1,,1.0,10/31/2012,Horrible service worse experience in a long time the waitresses where loud and rude. I asked for them to put the laker game on they made it seem like I was asking for to much. The volume was very low to we're all I could here was the cooks/plates in the kitchen and the waitresses laughing. It's not like I wanted the game at full blast but seriously at least so I can hear it. Worse time worse place ever.
Frederick D.,"Riverside, CA",22,91,146,4.0,3/23/2009,"Came here on a weekday and sat in the bar for their happy hour specials. Pros: The spinach and artichoke dip tastes great and the layer of cheese on top is baked on just right.  They also provide more than enough chips.  This time we had the great white mini pizza which has the alfredo sauce, grilled chicken, mushrooms and tomatoes.  The pizza was great, especially at half off.  If you like root beer, you should try it here.  Our servers checked on us often and were very courteous. Cons:  The potato crisps are described as lighty fried on the menu, they were in fact deeply fried. If you get the pizookie for dessert, do half and half for the cookie."
Amber M.,"Moreno Valley, CA",31,73,14,3.0,5/28/2011,"It gets really crowded at night and it can take awhile to get your food depending on how many ppl are there. However this seems to be the best place for drinks and food in Moreno valley. If youre not in a rush, you will enjoy thus place. Food and drinks are always good. Call ahead if you have more than two ppl or if you're going after 6pm"
Kelly C.,"San Francisco, CA",126,45,6,2.0,4/4/2011,"BJ's is definitely not a place to rave about, especially the location in Moreno Valley. What I detest most about this location for the restaurant is the service that they provide. The service is definitely below par because their servers never really bother to come back and check on you, busy or not. Don't bother to come in a party of 6 (or maybe 8, I can't remember) or more because they will definitely ignore you then. Why? Probably because gratuity is already a part of the check and they wouldn't be losing out on too much if you ultimately decide to not add an additional tip. I don't remember this place being somewhere that accepted reservations, but I do know that the wait is usually long, especially if you come in large parties (8 or more people). Parking is also a pain because the same lot is used for THREE different restaurants; talk about a parking nightmare. Luckily, there are other close-by lots, but who wants to have to walk so far to their car?  The two stars according to Yelp means ""Meh, I've had better"" and that definitely is the case with the food (applies to any BJ's). I've personally tried their pasta, deep dish pizzas, and a few other appetizers (potato skins, avocado rolls (?), and the dumplings of some sort to name a few. The pizza is probably your best bet when making an order. It isn't spectacular and doesn't make me crave for more, but it definitely satisfies your taste buds. Their pasta and other dishes could be ignored, but definitely do remember to try their deep dish pizza. (this is probably why they have two stars in my book). I've also tried their handcrafted root-beer which in my opinion, was too sweet for my liking. It wasn't bad because it came with free refills, but it definitely did not score high ratings that would fly off the charts either. Their pizookies? Nothing special either. My friend has made homemade pizookies that have tasted a lot better than what I've had at BJ's on several different occasions.  Would I recommend this place? For a small group of people, I might, but otherwise, I would really recommend AGAINST this place. I also really wish they would improve their service, maybe then I would update my rating to give more stars."
I I.,"Costa Mesa, CA",0,330,,3.0,10/17/2009,Hit or miss on the service for this location.  I have had good times and I have had bad times. It is off the freeway exit; you cannot miss it.
Akiko T.,"Alhambra, CA",203,330,120,4.0,2/19/2011,"i dont get it?? this BJs is great as any other BJs i go to! :) service is always friendly and food is always good. oh, my boyfriend (hes always trying out different things) got the Mediterranean pizza...oh my gosh. it was heavenly! i am on a diet so i tried to only eat a slice...but failed miserably haha. my friend got america's usual favorite: chicken alfredo, and that was pretty...no, that was really good too :)  pitcher of blonde, medium pizza and im a happy camper at BJs :)"
Melissa C.,"Honolulu, HI",10,66,,4.0,2/10/2009,"Good place to come to after shopping at Moreno Valley Mall and seeing a movie at Harkins. The husband likes the Totanka beer, while I like the pomegranate margarita. The appetizer platter, which consists of avocado egg rolls, spinach dip, and chips, is a good way to start because the service can take pretty long. The big stuffed potatoes are really good. I've tried the chicken and broccoli potato. I've also tried both kinds of calzones, the spinach and traditional. It's a good dish to share with another friend. If you feel like eating pasta, I suggest the fettucine alfredo with chicken and brocolli.  Overall, BJ's has a full menu of salads, soups, sandwiches, pastas, pizzas, and other ""feel-good"" (i.e. stuffed potatoes, calzones) dishes. If you like beer, you might find a new favorite among their wide variety of brews. Happy hour is a good chance to do just that.  The atmosphere is pretty chill here. It can be as casual as sitting by the bar with your friends and watching your favorite sports on the big screen tv's, or as intimate in one of the back tables and enjoying a date while sharing an oh-so delicious pizookie."
Gianni C.,"San Jacinto, CA",47,16,14,2.0,9/18/2010,"Not so good food, at least this location. Waitress was excellent, ambience was great +1, and very cool that the kitchen was open until midnight +1. But, food was mediocre. We ordered the artichoke dip (awful), California hamburger (tasteless), and a mediterranean pizza (good crust, awful ingredients)."
Jill C.,"Redlands, CA",54,6,,5.0,11/29/2012,"I've always loved BJs. The service at this location has always been friendly and quick, they have good food, great beer, and a cool environment. However, they almost ALWAYS got my order wrong. After a number of disappointing experiences at this location (Probably because I have a really neurotic order!), I emailed management to let them know how I felt. This is what I wrote: ""I have been a patron at your BJ's location for over four years. Over those four years, I have visited your store one to three times a month. I have ordered the same pizza every time, and 3 out of 5 times, my order is incorrect. My favorite pizza in the entire world is BJ's buffalo chicken pizza with no onions, no celery, and no barbecue sauce. Sometimes your staff know that your buffalo chicken pizza recipe calls for a mix of buffalo sauce and BBQ sauce to keep the heat down, but most of the time they do not. I have been argued with, I have been told I am wrong, and I have been patient with your staff for a very long time. More often than not, I receive a pizza with BBQ sauce on it, or a pizza without ranch (which seems to be the general ""quick fix"" to a staff member who does not believe me or want to deal with me). I, too, work in the customer service industry, so I understand what it's like to be on the other side, and perhaps that is why I have never made an issue of this. However, when I ordered my pizza with specific instructions last night, paid 25 dollars for it, and received it with BBQ sauce again, I decided it was time to speak up. My only request is that you make your staff knowledgable about your buffalo chicken pizza recipe, so that when I come back and order again, I don't have to feel like your staff thinks I'm an idiot and an obnoxious customer."" One of the managers, Brandy, was quick to respond, very kind and understanding, and even sent us a gift card! We've been back several times since, and our order has been perfect. This is what customer service is all about. We will definitely return!"
Warde M.,"Beaumont, CA",26,94,5,5.0,6/19/2013,"We have been to the BJ's in Corona several times & always enjoyed the food & atmosphere. We were scouting a place to celebrate my 75th Birthday in September. As in the others the place it was busy at 1220PM. We each ordered the Soup & 1/2 sandwich. Nancy got a grilled chicken sandwich w/bacon & avocado, i took the roasted turkey sandwich, both came with a lot of fries on the side. We both got the clam chowder. The 1/2 sandwiches were ample, as large as any I make at home. Both were delicious. The Clam Chowder was as good as any we've had in a long time, this from people raised in the Bay Area, & ate many times on Fisherman's Wharf. The service even at Lunch time was excellent, there was no delay, both the soup & sandwich arrived very quickly, & was hot. The fries were very good, & abundant. We talked to the events Manager & he, was very cordial giving us a run down on what they could do for my birthday, he also told us the San Bernardino BJ's might be closer to our home. Our waitress, (I forgot  her name) was as good as any we've had. We already stopped scouting around & have decided that BJ's is our place to celebrate my 3/4 of a Century."
Tomás G.,"Camarillo, CA",66,300,7,3.0,2/22/2013,"Have been here a couple of times and there is always a wait even though we had prior arrangements on one occasion, the food is decent and the service is good once you are seated."
christian t.,"Compton, CA",7,13,1,4.0,4/15/2011,"Delicious pizza and beer, but other than that the rest of the food is ok. I love the hd tvs great to catch a Laker game. I recommend the buffalo chicken pizza."
Brittany M.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,5,,2.0,9/21/2013,"The only reason why this place is getting 2 stars is because of the food. BJ's does offer a great variety of food and beverages, and they are very consistent with the quality as well. But this location, just as most other Bj's restaurants I have visited, have HORRIBLE service. I have been to this location many times(my husband loves the pizza) and there has never been an instance where I am happy with the service. Waiters are very slow. They don't seem to be friendly most of the time, and I have never had a manager come by just to see how the evening was going. Customer service needs some improvement."
