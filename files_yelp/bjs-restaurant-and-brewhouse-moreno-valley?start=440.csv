Mom H.,"Roanoke, TX",3,49,,1.0,2/14/2010,"Walking in looks promising, we sat outside, service was extremely slow, and the waiters totally unprofessional, one waiter came out yelling the food items and the guests on the patio had to raise their hands, another waiter took dirty dishes from one table and put them on another table where guests were still eating, just so she could open the door, gross. we has burgers, they were totally well done and hard, and not cooked like they said in the menu, my husband's was completely missing the sauces and i has the cuban and ham wasn't precooked, and pickles were raw(supposed to be fried). calamari was totally Mediocre, not going back."
M T.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,44,122,3.0,8/23/2008,"The food is pretty good here, but it's like any other BJ's. There was the appetizer platter with the avocado eggrolls, spinach dips and chips, and what else which all tasted good. I had the mini BBQ chicken pizza which was yummy, but maybe the chicken was on the dry side. The real downside was that service was extremely slow. So slow, that our pizookie platter went to some other table. But no prob, the manager lady came to apologize to us and was really nice to give our $16 platter for free. The only thing to look forward at BJ's I think is the pizookie, which is always worth many stars :)"
Rick K.,"Los Angeles, CA",132,552,22,4.0,5/17/2007,"I went to BJ's in Moreno Valley when they first openned a few years ago, and back then it was a huge success. People would wait 45 minutes to be seated. I suppose things haven't changed much since then.  What I like about BJ's, that one in particular, is that the service is impecable... second to none (in terms of franchises). The Chicago deepdish pizza is very good, and price is okay (not the cheapest place). The interior decor is great (as well as the outside). I don't know much about other locations, but this one in particular was very grand in every way, shape of form.  The service was the best. Even today, i reminisce of the time when i went to BJ's in Moreno Valley and ordered a small pizza. The waitress brought a medium one instead... so I told her ""look, i ordered a small, not a medium."" The nice thing to do would be for her to let me have the pizza and just charge the small... but surprisingly, NOT ONLY WAS MY MEDIUM PIZZA ON THE HOUSE, BUT THEY ALSO GAVE ME A SMALL ONE TO GO!!! how cool is that? from that point on, my trust iin this chain has grown immensely, and I have regarded it with the outmost respect.  I enjouyed the several levels of seats and the enourmous multi plasma screen TVs.  Their famous dessert, the Pizookie, is not exactly what you call the most unique dessert, but it's certainly a crowd pleaser. I am personally not fond of Cookies and Vanilla ice cream, but my friends are.  If you go, you should probably try the BBQ CHicken Pizza (which is delicious). Unfortunately i have not tried the beer, but I'm assuming it's great since that's how they got famous to begin with.  4.5 Stars."
Brodaeous M.,"Moreno Valley, CA",25,54,,4.0,8/22/2010,"Classic Burger, add Bacon and Cheese, unbelievable! Great burger! Service was average and of course, as always, they changed waiters mid-seating on us. Dunno why this always happens at BJ's."
Nicolas P.,"Whittier, CA",250,2,,2.0,1/24/2011,"Only thing good is the Pizzooki and the changed the way the pizza is cooked, so it looks like an expensive Pizza Hut Pizza."
Margot M.,"Louisville, CO",49,37,43,2.0,4/30/2010,Good for quick lunch or drinks but it can be pricy and the food is way calorie loaded and not very good.
S M.,"Riverside, CA",0,11,1,1.0,4/12/2013,"Ordered New York Steak for dinner to share with my son. When the steak arrived, I asked for A1 sauce to have with the steak. The waitress told me that they were completely out of A1 sauce. So I asked if they'd have other kind of sauce at all. The waitress said she'd check. She came back and said they don't have any kind of sauce left at all. On the way out of the restaurant, I noticed a bottle of A1 sauce on another table in the bar area. I guess the restaurant wasn't really completely out of A1 sauce. I've been lied to in my face."
Jen N.,"Henderson, NV",68,316,115,3.0,4/19/2008,"i personally do not like coming here.  My first ever meal here was the fettuccine alfredo, which, to be honest, is worse than a frozen dinner.  I was unhappy and didnt even take it home for leftovers. First impressions here are somewhat everlasting.  I am forced to come here because it is a good place to have birthday dinners, send lunch with friends.  I come back ordering something different, trying to see what i like.  But so far, its just the chicken wings and the pizookie... But the pizookie was the highlight of the meal.  though i can make it at home, far cheaper, its still nice to have it served for you like that.  I always ask for ice cream on the side because the ice cream melts too fast, and its like having milk and cookies."
Andrea L.,"Orange County, CA",463,353,106,4.0,4/23/2010,"Went here last night, really friendly service here and food was pretty good. For the appetizer I ordered the chicken wings and they were so good then I ordered the Chardonnay shrimp pasta and it was delicious a very big amount of food. Trust me when I say big because I wasnt even able to finish the plate I had to take it home and when I ate the rest of it this morning I was so full ! Anyways my boyfriend ordered the California burger it was alright , it wasnt all that great. I honestly didnt think it was $10 worth but thats just me. Anyways for dessert we ordered the white chocolate macadamia pizookie and that wasnt as good either. I mean it was good but it wasnt as good as ive had previous times."
Teresa Y.,"San Francisco, CA",147,647,33,4.0,1/31/2008,"One of the better BJ's I've been to in Southern California. Friendly staff, LOTS of seating and little wait time.  Be sure to come here for happy hour. Get the mini ""Great White"" or ""BBQ Chicken""."
Bijan J.,"Westminster, CA",1,37,1,2.0,3/8/2010,"The food is pretty good. I like their pizzas and the pizookie. They also have their own beer which is not bad. However, everytime I've beem here the service is dreadful. Its been as bad as not getting our beverages untill after the foods come out to just having to wait over half an hour for the food. Sometimes the server themselves are nice just slow other times they act like we are bothering them by coming in. I've started to avoid this particular BJs entirely"
Sara P.,"Murrieta, CA",0,4,2,5.0,12/9/2010,"We stopped at the Moreno Valley location for lunch and I have to say I enjoyed the visit very much. The service was very good and the food was delicious. I had the ham and cheese sandwich with tomato soup. I was very impressed with their soup, the bread for the sandwich was excellent!"
Joedee D.,"Nuevo, CA",100,1,,2.0,5/7/2012,"Service was unfriendly,  almost everyone working there didn't go out of there way to make customers feel welcomed.  Very straight faced.  Food was very good."
Anne-Michelle E.,"Perris, CA",99,82,77,5.0,1/12/2009,LOVE BJ's!! I don't think I've EVER had anything bad at BJ's...their Avocado Egg Rolls are to DIE for!!! And their pizza is delicious too! Great for families or for a date...BJ's has impressed me every time I've eaten there!
michael a.,"CA, CA",3,32,,4.0,10/21/2007,"Good ordinary chain food, better than TGI Friday's but not as good as Claim Jumper.  The beer is really good and there are 9 big screen tv's so great place to watch the game.  No waiting for a table.   The avocado spring rolls are good but don't eat to many... not good for the tummy."
Quinn C.,"Beaumont, CA",36,211,1,1.0,1/9/2011,"BJ's is overpriced!  We ordered a calzone, which I will say was good, but it was supposed to be ""for 2.""  There's no way.  We are not huge people but we should've ordered one of these, each!  I ordered a ""wedge salad"" first.  I've never ordered one of these.  When it was brought out, I felt like I was on a hidden camera show or something.  It was a small wedge of iceberg lettuce with a few tiny tiny pieces of tomatoes and bacon bits.  They forgot the crumbly bleu cheese but when that was brought out it was a tiny amount too.  I have never, in my life, had such a small and pointless salad.  And it's $5.50 on the menu!  The kids' mac and cheese was fine.  We have also ordered lasagna at BJ's in the past that was the smallest slice of lasagna you have ever seen.  Other than the calzones (which are too small anyway) and the beer, we are not fans of BJ's.  Way too pricey for what you get!  Chili's, Outback and Red Robin are much much better chain restaurants for sure!  Oh, and our service at this one was fine.  But I doubt we'd go back."
Reanna R.,"Palm Springs, CA",34,188,81,2.0,8/8/2011,"BJ's is one of my FAVORITE restaurants and this location was the worst one I have experienced out off ALL their locations.  We went on 8/5/11.  The service was horrible.  Our appetizers came out with our dinner.  By the time we finished our appetizers our pizza was cold.  My half was 1/2 crust and the other 1/2 was the pizza (which was lacking some cheese).  The other half of the pizza was the Mediterranean style.  What happened to the other half of the pizza?  We also got dessert which came out the quickest.  We had 2 servers.  As soon as the 1st one finally came & acknoleged us we placed our order, so we wouldn't have to wait anymore.  We saw him once and then went on break.  The 2nd server I don't think had any clue about us, or what our order was.  We will never go to this one again.  We even sat in the bar sections, because the bar usually provides faster service...boy were we wrong.  We spent 3 hours there...and we sat right away, because the bar was open...we left right after we ate...so most of that time was spent WAITING for our food.  Horrible service...we drove all the way from Palm Springs, because it's closer than the Temecula location & we were wishing we would have just drove the extra few minutes for better service."
Mandy K.,"Mira Loma, CA",9,13,2,4.0,6/24/2011,"As many of you may know that there are not too many dining options in Moreno Valley. So when one our clients came to visit I picked BJs to do lunch. Of since it is Friday it was super packed even at 1PM. The server offered us a sit at the bar or 5-10 min wait for table. So we decided to wait, of course the 5-10 min ended up being more like 20 mins. Once we got a table we ordered right away. Within few mintues we got our drinks, however; our food took close to 45 mins. When they brought all the meals their excuse was the fish took a long time to make. Which really sound stupid since fish is most easiest to cook. I had their california chicken sandwich. It had way too much mayo (it was practically drowned in mayo) so the avoacodo kept falling/slipping off. The chicken was nice and yummy so that made it alight meal. So overall, i was bit disappointed with my choice. However, that changed towards end of our meal. The manager came to apolozie for the delay on our food. He brought our check and ga ve us a 20% discount and large pookie! Not many places can admit they messed up and offer something. So that was very refreshing. It was nice to get the 20% discount, but since we had the company card we just overtipped the server for the excellent serve although food wasn't super excellent. i pprobaly will come back given that it only nice restuarnt in m.v."
Amanda W.,"Riverside, CA",22,27,1,4.0,4/27/2008,"Love their pizza and avocado eggrolls.  Those are the two reasons I'll keep going back.  Prices are pretty average for a sit down restaurant, service is decent, and the decor is nice."
Roy H.,"San Jose, CA",1,104,343,4.0,5/30/2008,"Went there for some BJ's and beer.... Left happy and very satisfied. Oh, great food too!"
