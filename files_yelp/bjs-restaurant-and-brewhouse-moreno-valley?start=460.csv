Carol G.,"Menifee, CA",26,50,,5.0,10/25/2010,"This place has something for everyone. Great beer, pizza, pasta, beef dips, salads, lettuce wraps and just about anything else you can think of. Everything is always fresh and in decent sized portions. Talk about friendly servers. They even remember your name the next time you come in. We eat here often and have never been disappointed."
Tom M.,"Washington D.C., DC",1,15,1,4.0,1/16/2011,"Frequently go there for lunch or an early dinner (to avoid a wait).  Food and service are excellent.  Because this is a sports bar and restaurant it can get a bit loud at times.  Despite the noise, we keep coming back."
Simon S.,"San Francisco, CA",34,119,3,3.0,11/19/2008,"We used to come here to a lot to watch basketball games and throw down a few pitchers. They have a wide variety of drinks and food. Service is pretty good. Can get busy during nights and weekends. If you have no where else to go, hit up BJ's, can't really go wrong."
Jen B.,"Moreno Valley, CA",75,284,207,3.0,2/28/2009,i dont really drink so this is not my favorite joint but i'd go every now and then to their happy hour!
Laura K.,"Riverside, CA",2,15,1,2.0,3/12/2009,"We'll start with the fact that I love BJ's, just not this one.  Service was terrible and it took over an hour to get our food.  The waitress didn't even bother to come by and explain the wait.  The food was good, as usual, but the service means I'm not going back to that location."
Dee J.,"Riverside, CA",0,16,,3.0,8/23/2008,"Had 3 bad experiences here about 3 years ago when they first opened.  We just went back for the first time since then and were pleased with our meal.  We received a coupon in the mail for a $20.00 dinner which included a medium deep dish pizza of our choosing, a small salad, and a pizookie for desert.  The deep dish medium pizza alone was listed at $19.95 on the menu (pepperoni, sausage, etc---the deluxe).  Our server brought us a large pizza, which was about $24.00 by itself.  She said they had run out of medium pizzas (not sure how that works, since they had enough dough to obviously make a LARGE one instead)!  So we were happier than a pig in slop.  Our server was very good and very friendly without being to chatty.  They also brought us the wrong pizookie, so they gave us a second one---now I'm in hog-heaven!!!  One comment---The deep dish pizza has got no kick.  As a point of reference, I love the Roundtable pepperoni pizza---it's got a spicy kick in the tomato sauce and the pepperoni.  BJ's pizza had zero kick, so it's not high on my list of great pizzas and I probably would be disappointed if I had paid $25.00 for this large pizza.   But, overall were we pleased with our meal and had a pleasant evening."
