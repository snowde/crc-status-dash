Salvador V.,"Pomona, CA",45,1,,1.0,3/12/2017,"I have never had a horrible experience at this BJ's like I have tonight. From the moment I arrived it took nearly 25 minutes before we were even able to order our food. And that's just because we had to waive our waitress down, if not she would have just kept walking past us. Once our order was placed it took upwards of 30 minutes for our food to get here and not once were we provided an update on the status of it. She walked by us multiple times without even making eye contact  to see  if we were doing ok or if we wanted a refill on our drinks. To add it to it she then apologized saying it took the table next to us 10 more minutes for them to get there food compared to us. Am I supposed to take satisfaction in the fact that I waited more than 30 minutes while the table next us waited 10 more minutes? Everything that we received at the table we had to waive down our waitress or different waiters multiple times. I am extremely disappointed and I am not if I want to return to this location. Hopefully other people will never receive this type of service like we did"
Bisma P.,"Davis, CA",136,68,41,3.0,5/22/2017,"Pretty average for a restaurant. I didn't love the food, but I didn't hate it either. It's just that I could probably make most of the things on the menu at home for cheaper. I'm surprised people come here just to eat a Caesar salad."
Angela P.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,165,117,4.0,6/30/2016,"My first visit for lunch; the place was not crowded at all. The ""lunch menu"" was great & a value.  My friend had a coupon because she is a reward member. BOGO is always a beautiful thing! So between 3 kids and 2 adults it was under 45. Our server was very attentive, kept drinks coming & paid close attention to our ""picky"" requests... The only negative was the time it took for our food to be prepared. It was quite a while even with good company. Since our food tasted hot& great I'm not totally upset.  I'd come here again for lunch!"
Phil Z.,"Winchester, CA",0,6,,1.0,4/11/2017,"If I could not give stars, I would.  This was one of the worst experiences that I have ever had at a restaurant.  Let me preface this with the fact that I am normally very patient and understanding because my husband and I previously owned a restaurant.  We understand that things happen. First, we tried to make a reservation, but were told only groups of 35+ could have reservations.  Second, we tried to ""check in"" with the app.  The app would not let us do so.  We went to the restaurant hoping that it would not be that long of a wait.  I was told that we would have to wait 1 hour.  I explained that I tried to ""check in"" with the app, but the app was not working.  I was told that did not matter.  After I walked away, my husband overheard the hostess manager tell her that was the wrong reaction.  We only waited about 10 minutes.  This was about the only positive part of our night. I ordered the Berry Burst Cider.  A few minutes later the waitress returned to inform me that they were out.  I could order Angry Orchard.  I reviewed the menu and decided on a Strong Bow.  She said they were out of everything but Angry Orchard and Fromboise.  Neither of these appealed to me so I stuck with water. Our appetizer came timely.  But, our meal did not arrive for another 30ish minutes.  Also, it came in spurts.  First, my daughter received her mac and cheese.  It was only warm.  A few minutes later, I received my ""margherita pizza"".  It was only warm.  It was not hot.  I could touch the pan!  After a few more minutes, my mother in law received her parmesean crusted chicken after it was shoved in the armpit of the server.  At this point, everyone but my other daughter had received their meal.  They were all luke warm.  We flagged someone down to get the spaghetti.  It finally arrived.  IT WAS COLD.  Ridiculous!  My mother in law's broccoli was ice cold. My pizza was not a ""Chicago"" style pizza.  I know what ""Chicago"" style is.  My family is from Chicago, and the restaurant that we owned served ""Chicago"" style pizza.  The edge of the pizza that would be against the wall of the pan was non-existant.  It did not have a crust basically.  The middle part of the pizza was limp when help up.  It should have some crustiness to it and be able to stand so to speak.  When I heated up my leftover pizza a few days later, the crust in the middle was just right.  This means that the pizza was not cooked correctly.  Either it was not cooked long enough or the pizza oven is not hot enough.  Everyone else did not have an issue until the pizookie nightmare....... My husband and father in law had birthdays.  We got them the birthday pizookie.  They arrived at the table about 20 min after which is what I expect from my prior experience.  At that time, we ordered both daughters their own child pizookie.  After 30-45 minutes of nothing arriving to the table, we flagged someone down.  It was being worked on or so we were told.  Another 10 min go by, repeat flag down it's being worked on.... Complain to Mark the manager.  He will see what is going on.  Another 10-15 min later NOTHING.  Then, the kitchen manager gets pointed to us by Mark after Mark ran away from my father in law trying to flag him down a second time.  He apologizes.  We complain about everything especially the fact that the 5 and 10 year olds are waiting MOST PATIENTLY for their pizookie.  One arrives while we are talking to him.  The ice cream is MELTED.  So how long did it have to sit for someone to bring it to us for it to be MELTED?!?!?!?!?!?!!?  He says he will comp our meal.  We ask for the other pizookie (for the 5 year old).  It arrives.  NO ICE CREAM!!  Uh, it has no ice cream... Kitchen manager, ""I didn't know if you wanted the ice cream.""  Yes, it is for a child.  At that point, he discloses that they ran out of the flavor that she wanted., and he had to give her one size up.  WHY ON EARTH HAS NO ONE TALKED TO US ABOUT ANY OF THIS?!?!?!?!?!??!?!  So the 5 year old now has her pizookie that is HOT.  It was the only part of our dinner that was hot. So we get the bill....... the drink that I never got which was sold out was on the bill.  The meal was not comp'ed.  My mother in law complained to Mark again about how bad this whole thing was.  She had to demand that he do something about it and suggested gift certificates for us to return.  We got the gift certificates, but we are still not sure about returning.  Mark talked to us and apologized and told us he wanted to make it right.  He is not the right person for that position.  You need a strong leader.  You need someone who will take charge.  You need someone who will TRAIN your people.  Also, the front of the house should be taking responsibility for the mistakes and making them right.  He should not be hiding and sending the kitchen manager to talk to the customers. I left off the part about how the waiters and waitresses kept walking behind our chairs and running into us to get to the table behind us."

Chef E.,"Salem, OR",0,8,,1.0,5/18/2017,"I love pizza and beer! I also like being acknowledged as a guest/customer/person when seated (at the bar) by the bartender or staff. I also like my pizza cooked. ****This BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse doesn't like what I like.***** My reasoning is based on actual experience on a Sunday night after 10pm.  I sat at the end of the bar near the kitchen, where the employees congregate and talk shit about other employees and customers. I overheard conversations. Meanwhile I sat waiting for service for a good 10 minutes or more. I gave it a few more moments before I walk out. Soon someone is behind the bar. A couple minutes later she arrives at this end of the bar and greets me, hands me a menu, and then was about to walk away. ""I'm ready to order"" I speak up before she can. ""Small pizza and an IPA, please."" A few minutes later my beer is served and eighteen minutes later my pizza is served.  Hum? I'll give them the benefit of doubt and I take a bite from a slice. Doughy. The cheese isn't fully melted. Pizza isn't hot. When the bartender came back around I asked if possible to have a cooked pizza with all the cheese melted? She took the pizza and handed it to someone else while repeating my exact words for them to tell the kitchen. Ten minutes later the same pizza is returned with the cheese barely all melted but more than before. My first thought was this sucks. I equated the taste and texture to be as close as possible to eating a used soggy dish sponge topped with canned tomato sauce and pre-shredded mozzarella cheese then microwaved for 18 seconds, then plated and served with a beer. I ate it. Paid the bill with 20% tip. Then left."
Donna B.,"Ballarat, Australia",0,4,,3.0,10/24/2017,"The service was good and the food was nice. My Husband got a pizza and he really enjoyed it, I got steak it was a bit tough but eatable. Cocktails are really nice."
Lisa A.,"Perris, CA",2,54,31,2.0,10/25/2016,"Came to this location 10/20/2016 around 3pm for lunch. The place was pretty empty and we got seated right away. We were very hungry and eager to eat.  The waitress took over 15 to order our drinks, 5 min more to take our appetizer order, she left and came back 10 min later to get our food order. She took forever!   When our appetizer arrived she left it on the table and left. She left us no plates! We had to stop her and ask for them. We sat there with our wings for a few minutes before we got our plates.  Then there is a shift change and we get a waiter. Later, there when our food comes he leaves us our food but no condiments. We wanted cheese and chilli flakes for our food. We found him at the bar so I had to get out of my seat and walk over to him to ask for some. Look the whole point to my rant is that I am angry at this place because of the terrible customer service. Be warned and come at your own risk of disappointment."
Sara L.,"Anaheim, CA",194,2,,2.0,7/8/2017,Food is good but service is horrible. My server walked past and didn't even check up on us even though my drinks have been empty for some time. To make it worse management walked by and did nothing.
Chris R.,"Moreno Valley, CA",1,33,,1.0,7/2/2017,"I've been coming here since grand opening. The food is alright, and the service is okay. But that's not what I'm going to be talking about. Instead, id like to bring up one event in particular.  I wanted to rent a keg for a party. I called the restaurant and ordered it. They told me I could pick it up the day before my party.  I go to pick it up and they tell me that there's a small problem. They have the keg, but they don't have a tap for it. The manager tells me that they can hold it there for me while I go rent a tap from a liquor store. I thought this was a good idea, so I went out and did that.  I showed up the next day (day of my party) to pick up the keg. Larger problem. The manager brings out the keg and it is not what I thought. The attachment for the tap needs something called a bass tap. I had never heard of this before, apparently it is kind of rare to find kegs with this. The manager offered no solution other than to go out and rent the proper tap. If I couldn't find it, I would be refunded. It might just be me, but I would expect a company that owns and rents out these kegs to have the proper equipment to use them.  I caved and went out in search of this tap. It wasn't easy, but I found one and rented it. Even the people renting it to me (a specialty beer shop) were so shocked that they called BJ's and asked why they would even rent something this rare.  We finally got the keg to the party (late). And all was well. That is until the next day when I tried to return it. I brought it in, collected my deposit and started walking out. Another manager yelled at me saying that she cannot accept a ""full"" keg. The keg was at a party. It was less than halfway full. It's usually pretty common to return one that's not empty. This wasn't my problem with what she said, my problem was with the fact that they offered absolutely no way to even use this thing and then expected it to be completely empty. And on top of all that, they took back my $100 deposit.  Long story short, don't rent a keg from here. The managers are completely inexperienced when it comes to this sort of thing and will offer no solution when a problem comes up. If this is the kind of attitude management has for small things like this, then it's no wonder why they received a B from the health department."
Walter W.,"Corona, CA",0,10,1,5.0,7/28/2017,The pizookie is worth the trip alone. I have also tried the buffalo wings and the pizza too. When I come here with friends we always have a good time. I have also tried the burger and it's really good too.
Shawn O.,"Riverside, CA",0,13,2,5.0,7/28/2017,This is a follow up review the GM Lisa replied and asked me to call she Oakes me to try again and ask for her when I do she apologized so regardless of how it turns out I appreciate the offer that shows she is paying attention and working on issues customers may experience thank you Lisa
Carri A.,"Moreno Valley, CA",57,8,2,1.0,5/6/2017,"Didn't see the ""B"" rating until after we ate..it was behind tinted windows and placed REALLY high..nite visible from outside..this along with bad service,  they don't even deserve 1 star"
Chris W.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,1,,4.0,8/20/2017,"I am changing my review because the manager contacted me and was very respectful, and helpful."
Katie C.,"Irvine, CA",47,20,3,5.0,4/13/2017,"We have been here a handful of times and every time we come we always have outstanding service. Every server goes above and beyond to make sure we have everything we need, checks in regularly, and are overall very friendly. The food is good too!"
Aizelle A.,"Murrieta, CA",1,2,,5.0,7/3/2017,"Excellent hospitality and service. We walked in around 45 minutes before closing. We were helped right away by the manager, Mark, and he greeted us with a welcoming smile. We ordered a pizookie and it was out in a jiff. While waited though we noticed how helpful Mark was with customers on the phone. Love seeing excellent management. 5/5"
Dave D.,"Moreno Valley, CA",34,10,,3.0,6/22/2017,"Went to BJ's at 10:27 pm As soon as we got sitted I ask one server to change my rolled napkin because it saw dirty like someone already used it and the table is a bit sticky at 10:37 pm Server told us that she'll be in a minute cause she will take the order on the next seat first. She went back to us at 10:52 pm Server ask if our check will be separate or not before she even ask our order at 10:51 pm Server went back to our table with the beverage at 11:11pm Server went to our table to let us know that the food will be serve in a couple of minutes at 11:18 pm Food came to our table at 11:20pm (my food was  a bit dry, probably been sitting under the heat lamp for a while.) Server told me to get the drinks from her hands cause she was carrying the six drinks and cannot  put it down the table and she lots me that they ran out of my beverage at 11:24 pm At 11:42 pm the room just get cold and I felt like they crank up the A/C Server gave us our bill at 11:42 pm Server gave me another glass of water when I didn't even ask for one at 11:47 pm Server came back with the receipt and told us that our pizookie's are coming any minutes at 11:52 pm Pizookie's came to our table at 11:58 pm"
A K.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,18,1,4.0,10/16/2017,A little nice pizza ria for the fam bam.kids really ebjoy it here.i definenty will return.love the beers.  Waiter was nice.
Dan N.,"Huntington Beach, CA",287,160,197,4.0,10/6/2016,"This is probably the first time I had an overall positive experience at BJ's. It was national pizookie day so I thought why not a free pizookie today. Usually the service is pretty bad at BJ's but this time we had a very good server, a woman wearing a bandana or headband. The food was good too and the price was very reasonable for the lunch specials. I still noticed that they were a little understaffed as she was the only one serving the bar area which was fully occupied but she did a great job."
Bob M.,"Colton, CA",14,31,52,5.0,3/2/2017,"We had just come from hearing the Moreno Valley Wind Symphony concert. It was late and we were hungry. We got seated quickly. Our waitress was Dalia, she had a sparkling personality. She knew the menu very well and made some great suggestions. Our food came out quickly. I tried their SPICY PEANUT CHICKEN WITH SOBA NOODLES, it a new item and super tastee with a nice bit of spicy to kick it up. Ask for Delia she is very delightful."
