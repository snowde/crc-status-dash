Kirsten M.,"Anaheim, CA",457,14,20,3.0,8/7/2016,"I could say today was the worst service I've had in BJs!!! In Moreno Valley.... I had dinner with my mother and friend. My friend and I ordered wedge salads with no forks and then our server brought my mother her clam chowder and it looked very dark.... Usually it looks like a nice creamy, white and pieces of clam all over... Her just looked like a mushroom old soup. And top of that gave her a plastic spoon... I thought those were for to for meals... But when another server brought my food I did mention to him that my mothers clam chowder look old and nasty.... He did bring her a new one.....out server acknowledge us twice   So at the end result food good server not the best"
Silvia I.,"Banning, CA",2,27,11,5.0,4/7/2017,I didn't get the name of our waitress but she is super nice ; they ran out of mozzarella sticks and the chef himself came to apologize and ask what we wanted to replace it for . Oh and don't leave without trying the s'mores pizookie
Sherdon T.,"Moreno Valley, CA",28,7,1,5.0,6/25/2017,"My family and I decided to try out BJ's breakfast brunch here in Moreno Valley on Frederick. Their breakfast brunch is really great, not only is it great but  I also would like to acknowledge and thank our awesome waitress Azubah S. . She is very professional and awesome personality. She repeated our order back to insure she got it right, and keep coming back to make sure was there anything else we need. Her personality is a 10, 10 being exceptional. Azubah is a great asset to your company."
Sandra O.,"Loma Linda, CA",0,3,,1.0,7/30/2016,"The service was horrible! We walked up to the open seating in the bar area and waited for someone to greet us. It was a bit of a dead night. After several servers passed by our table without greeting us, I walked up to the bar and asked for menus. I had to flag a waitress down to take our drink and food order.  The food took over 20 minutes:/  There's potential for good service... you just have to flag them down !"
Devin R.,"Manchester, NH",14,98,37,3.0,2/13/2016,"Hit up the lounge area with some co-workers this week. Shortly after sitting down, we were greeted promptly and offered some beverage suggestions. Given that BJ's brews their own stuff, we asked about IPA options and were advised that they had a seasonal brew on tap - the Committed IPA. After waffling about, the waitress offered to bring over a sample for the 4 of us. Great sample sizes, let me tell you! After giving this a taste, we were subsequently talked into trying the beer sampler option. A little tough to choose only 4 given the variety of beers here, but I made do with a Lager, the Pale Ale, the aforementioned Committed and a Stout. After giving them all a whirl, the Committed was probably the best of the bunch. Their lighter brews all kind of taste alike.  Dinner was a bit of a mess. It started ok with the Tomato/Mozz salad - good portion for a side and tasted excellent. Unfortunately, the main course - the Sirloin - was horrendous. I ordered it medium and it came out pretty rare, and the cut was awful - very sinewy. She took it back to give it some more heat, but we all know how that turns out. The hockey puck that returned was inedible. Without asking, the waitress kindly knocked it off the bill, but the damage was done. With one of these places that has a Cheesecake Factory-esque menu in which they try to provide something for every taste under the sun, it's impossible for the food to be great. So, if you go in with low expectations, you'll probably be ok here at BJs. Unfortunately, not a lot of other options in the area."
Renee H.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,4,,4.0,9/20/2017,"I love BJ's. It's one of my friends and I favorite happy hour spots. The beer is The Bomb. For those of you who don't understand The Bomb, the beer is Delicious. If you join the BJ's reward club they have good deals on a regular basis also."
Michelle J.,"San Jacinto, CA",0,5,,5.0,5/29/2017,BJ's Restaurant has great food and great service. I ordered the shrimp and asparagus penne. It tasted great. I really liked the garlic knot that came with it. Our food came right on time and I even got a free cookie with ice cream on it for my birthday.
Michael F.,"Prescott, AZ",67,156,48,3.0,2/6/2017,My family stopped here for lunch. The interior decor was nice and clean feeling. My Wife and I both ordered the French Dip which was decent but nothing special. They were out of the thin crispy fries that I ordered so I got wedge.The kids got chicken strips which they enjoyed. The service was friendly but very slow. Ill probably skip it next time I'm in the area.
Antoinette H.,"Leimert Park, Los Angeles, CA",32,22,2,1.0,1/22/2017,Took my sis here for her bday. There were 4 of us in total. I ordered a salad with my dinner. The salad never came. When two of the other orders came they were wrong. The waiter took forever coming back to check on us so it took awhile before my guest received their order correctly. By the time they got their food done right I had already ate my entire meal with the exception of the salad I never received but it was on my bill.  Never going back
Morgan R.,"Moreno Valley, CA",102,6,3,1.0,5/19/2017,"I am so upset with BJs. They messed up mine and husbands order multiple times during our visit yesterday. We paid and were about to leave and my husband decided to speak to the manager First, She was very apologetic and said she was going to reduce our bill. My husband paid with the card and was concerned he was going to get charged the full amount anyway and she assured him that would not happen. Checked the bank this morning and lo and behold we were charged the full amount anyway... Im so done with this place."
Alma H.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,3,,4.0,9/10/2017,love this place!!! great place to grab some appetizers and enjoy their crafted beers. you can never go wrong with the BJ Favorite deep dish pizza and a Jeremiah red. if your lucky to have Sarah as your server your dinning experience will be even better.
Erick A.,"Riverside, CA",62,9,15,1.0,6/23/2016,Love the food here but they have terrible phone service. I called to make a reservation for my birthday over the weekend and I waited on hold for 20 minutes and had to explain to 4 people what I was on hold for. In the end I was told I would have to walk-in and wait on Saturday. I don't see why it takes longer than 20 minutes for that response?
Jeremy M.,"Grand Island, NE",3,20,,5.0,10/8/2016,"We had wonderful service here.  Food was fresh and tasty.  Great variety of food available.  Pizza, seafood and sandwiches are all top notch.  Everything appeared to use fresh ingredient. The staff was glad to bring us some raw vegetables for the kiddo in our group.   They have a good variety of their beer available and both the Blonde and Brunette are highly recommended.     The restaurant has a great atmosphere and is awesome for casual dining or spending time with family.   The service we had there was top notch as well. The waitress was on her game and kept drinks full, plates cleared and even took a picture of our group on request."
Sherry B.,"Riverside, CA",48,8,6,5.0,7/20/2016,I love this place! Always made to feel like I'm family! The people who work here are absolutely fantastic! Great food! Great beer! What more could a girl ask for!? Oh wait! A cute guy named Adrian to bring me my food! A perfect dinner!
C H.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,3,2,1.0,6/17/2016,"This has to be the worst establishment that does not care about food presentation at all. I spoke with the manager there regarding the issue with the food presentation and all I got was an apology. No compensation or a replacement. Mind you this was on a Thursday and was not that busy to not care at all about what I was stating as a customer. Thank God they are opening newer establishments in this area because after 5 years of being a customer at this location, I will not return at all and will warn everyone about their service and food. I have attached pictures how the sauces were thrown on the plate and our calamari had a mixture of burnt fries on the plate. Just horrible!"
Christopher R.,"Corona, CA",293,26,5,2.0,5/29/2016,"Out of all the times I've been to this location tonight has to be the most disappointing. The wait time was less than 5 minutes but unfortunately for my friend and I that was the shortest wait time for us the entire night.  It took our waiter over 10 minutes to finally come to our table to ask us for drinks and also appetizers. My friend and I already knew what we wanted to get so we ordered our food the first time she came to our table. Our food was pretty decent at best, with a clam chowder that was basically just a chowder and a lukewarm Parmesan crusted chicken although the salad we had was the most redeeming thing we ordered. After we ate our meal we waited about 20 minutes before our waitress came to ask if we needed the check or if we wanted desserts. We ordered 1 pizookie and that took 30 minutes to come out. A pizookie is good but it's not worth that long of a wait.  I understand the wait times on busy nights but tonight was an extremely slow night with many empty tables within the restaurant. I don't really understand how I've had better service that is expected of BJs at this location on extremely busy nights and even nights when I'm with bigger parties for birthdays. I used to enjoy this location when I was in college so hopefully something gets fixed or I will not be returning when I'm in the Riverside area."
Ronald H.,"Moreno Valley, CA",31,2,,1.0,8/18/2017,"I had one of my worst meals at BJ's Restaurant. The service was really bad, table was dirty., and the food was not that much better. The State B rating was questionable as well when asked to speak to management they never came out to talk to us. Eat at your own risk."
Daniel D.,"Corona, CA",1,60,30,1.0,9/20/2015,"We went on a Sunday at 5pm and the service was absolutely atrocious. We asked our server about the 2 for $25 deal and her attitude immediately changed and she seemed irritated we weren't ordering an appetizer.  We ordered a wedge and caesar salad and when the salads came out, the food runner brought out 2 wedge salads and plastic wear because ""no one was wrapping silverware in the back.""  As we were eating our wedge salad, the salad bowl had tomato sauce crusted inside the bowl. Nasty! It was like eating off someone else's plate. Our pizza came out fast and was fine. Our dessert on the other hand, took 20 mins to come out. If you come to the Moreno Valley BJ's location, don't plan on having good service, clean plates, or regular silverware. It was simply a terrible experience."
Jordan Z.,"Chino Hills, CA",3,17,5,1.0,1/8/2017,"The food was good, took forever to get my ranch. Huge negative because I was 7 fries in without ranch. I sat at the bar and I must say the bar is so dirty. The bartender has bottles out and paree out and not fridge-rated. It's so dirty and she sat in the corner playing with a straw while my water was empty. She came up to me and asked me if I was doing okay and my water was clearly empty. The bartender sat in the corner (LEANING) after filling my water, giving orders to employees. She than told an employee named Jose to clean the 2 tables and he just walked away but she did say it with a huge attitude. Every 5 minutes she will do something than drink her hidden Starbucks in the corner. She leaves fridges open for long period of time as well. For the remainder of my stay she talked to every employee gossiping about each employee. Very unprofessional and when you're trying to have a relaxing dinner, it differ. The only good thing about this stay was the easy to find parking because someone had just pulled out. Hopefully corporate sees this post and talks to her. I am providing this review with one star due to this nightmare of a bartender. Her name is Melissa and if bjs doesn't get her out.. this restaurant will continue to get zero to 1 star reviews."
Amanda G.,"Riverside, CA",201,10,,1.0,11/22/2016,"food was decent but the service sucked.  we were greeted by the manager as we walked in, the host was talking to a server and finished his conversation before greeting us, even after making eye contact with us.  my friend walked up to him and said that we wanted a table for two and the host looked surprised that my friend had even talked to him. the host grabbed two menus and began to walk away. my friend and i looked at each other and the host turned around and motioned to us to follow him. he literally didn't say a word the entire time, he handed us menus and turned around and walked away.  that was so odd?? he didn't tell us to follow him and he didn't say a word.  our server was nice but she maybe came to the table three times. once to take drink orders, once to take food orders where she told us to order our pizookies ten minutes before we want them and then 20 minutes goes by and she still hasn't come back, we have long finished our food and can't find her anywhere. we finally get to order our pizookies (from another server cause we can't find ours) and she comes out to bring them 15 minutes later. and she brought the bill with them. like ok you want us out of here after ignoring us the whole meal? ok?? the food was good and the pizookies were good, i was lucky to have good conversation with a friend but the service was slow and they really didn't care about us at all. as a server it really is unacceptable."
