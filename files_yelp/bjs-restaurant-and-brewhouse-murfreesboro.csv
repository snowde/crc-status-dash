Jason K.,"Moscow, PA",4,27,,5.0,10/16/2017,"The Nashville Hot Chicken wings were really delicious - among some of the best wings I've had. And the ""deep dish"" pizza is totally not authentic by any means, but the California pizza was super good regardless. It was also 50% off because of the Monday night special.  Service was also super efficient and friendly. We'll definitely be back!"
Tommy D.,"Harrison, OH",7,6,1,1.0,10/20/2017,"From Good to Bad and then to Ugly!!! Bj's what are you doing a month ago this location reminded me of the Bj's of Old and that goes back to the locations in Laguna Beach and Maui where you first started years ago. ""I lived in Orange County Ca for 17 years"" Came in for the first time last month and the Pizza tasted like it did years ago, then the wheels must have fallen off the pizza oven belt the last 2 visits. I came in for your Monday special on 10-16-17 we ordered a large 5 gourmet  meats the first pizza looked ok but was lacking toppings but to top that pizza off it was COLD. Then you brought out anther pizza guess what Cold again. Then I though I would give you another try today 10-20-17 we ordered another large 5 gourmet meats and guess what this time no Toppings your pizza was not cut all the way, we asked for extra sauce which their was no sauce to be found.   You have now lost a long time customer from the beginning because of lack of quality control.  Bj's no more Let me guess you pre bake your crust and only proof half the time and you bake for a shorter time then you use to do."
Norra T.,"Nashville, TN",137,76,89,4.0,10/13/2017,"I can't quite figure out what it is that brings me back to this place. Yes, it's a chain. The foods consistent even in Vegas. I actually really enjoy having dinner at the bar here. There are plenty of TVs to catch the game and a massive beer selection.  The bartenders here are attentive and pour delicious drinks. I think it's a good place for me to catch up on emails, have a cocktail and eat some good ahi tuna poke. The ahi poke appetizer is my go to dinner here. For a chain, the tuna is pretty fresh and well prepared. The wontons give a nice crispy texture to the tuna and the flavors are well-balanced. Sometimes I will have a side of fries (a guilty pleasure of mine).  There's usually a wait for a table if are coming as a couple or group. Bathrooms are clean which is a good sign."
Thommy S.,"Murfreesboro, TN",45,85,109,5.0,1/7/2018,"One of my favorite places to go to after a long day at work.  I love the different kind of brews that they have there.  They also have beer flights.  On different nights, they have different dinner deals. Some nights, it's half off a whole pizza if I can remember correctly.  We usually go on the weekends when they do their weekend prime rib special. It's really good.  Their clam chowder soup is awesome.   The bartenders are nice.  Well, actually... I think all of their staff is very nice and welcoming."
Lisa E.,"Murfreesboro, TN",24,12,1,5.0,1/5/2018,"My husband and I love this restaurant! We like the atmosphere and the beer selection. My favorite thing from the menu is the Greek tacos. I've tried other things but always end up getting this favorite again. The pazooki is worth going for. One of my favorite desserts in town!!  We've had great service, sometimes a little slow, but as long as they keep the beer coming, we never leave unhappy."
Mike V.,"Murfreesboro, TN",288,121,270,5.0,9/20/2017,"Love this place especially the Beer Dinner Events. Great food and drink. Just went back in to BJ's tonight for dinner to celebrate Patty's Birthday. I haven't had any alcohol in about 5 or 6 weeks do to a diet/lifestyle change (to lose weight) but was desperately wanting a beer, so I had the Oktoberfest-YUM! I decided on the baked ziti which was good and Patty had the Parmesan crusted chicken with sun dried tomatoes and basil. My son ordered a cheeseburger and loved it. As always, BJ's delivered on food, fun, and service! Our waitress was excellent!!!"
Brian G.,"Stevens Point, WI",0,36,15,3.0,1/6/2018,Standard generic chain micro beer pub thing. Had a burger it was ok. The pizzas looked good the service was kind of slow at the bar. Wish I went somewhere else.
Ann W.,"East Stroudsburg, PA",1,17,5,5.0,1/6/2018,"My husband and I, definitely will be going back to try more of the their delicious food!  So much food to pick from their many pages of menu! The service was efficient and the people were so nice!"
Jai S.,"Lithia Springs, GA",7,88,43,5.0,10/9/2017,"Our experience here was great!! Our server was very nice and we didn't have to ask for anything. My husband and I ordered the baked ziti dish. It was very hot yet delicious!! Our son ordered chicken tenders with fries and our daughter had mini corn dogs with fruit.  For desert we ordered a pizookie. I think that's the name of. I know that thing has hella calories but it was absolutely delicious.  Overall, we had a great experience. The bathrooms were clean, the building was clean and we loved the ambiance. We don't have a restaurant like this in Atlanta so when we see them we like to eat here. The other location we had this restaurant was in California."
David L.,"Shawnee, KS",55,401,407,3.0,9/23/2017,"Nice space, decent food, service.....meh. Not sure what was going on this particular night, but I think some retraining is due with some of the staff. Before I get into that, I like the looks of the place. Laid out well, clean, and just somewhere I could see myself hanging out. The food was good. It didn't make me have a zen moment, but good is good. I'd have it again, although the hot chicken ( a TN staple) was just okay. I'm not sure what the hype is with that sandwich, but I'm happy to continue the search to find out. That brings me to the service. Our sever didn't act new, so maybe it was more than just her. Starting off with the drinks. We were a party of four. Three of us ordered a libation, and one an iced tea (lame, but I love ya man). His came out first of course, then came the others, except mine. Say what?! The other two got a specialty house drink and a black & tan. I ordered a draft beer. When I inquired about my beer, the server said that the bartender was swamped. Okay, I can see the bar, I can see the bartender, what's your definition of swamped? I didn't say that to the server though. That was for Yelp affect lol I mean, I got a draft. Glass, spout, pull the dang handle. But, you can make two specialty drinks? Is it possible you didn't order it? Even with all that, it was some time before I got my appetizer (beer). The food came out slow as well, and not at the same time. I'm rooting for you BJ :/ You've got a nice space and some good food. I just think some tightening up the basics is in order. Follow up to come."
Kari V.,"Downtown, Nashville, TN",41,26,46,2.0,11/4/2017,"Oh my.  I really don't like giving negative reviews, but they earned it. I have been here before and enjoyed the food and the service but this time was different. Maybe it is because we sat up at the bar area?  I had the beet salad,  which can be very delicious but it was definitely more beet than salad and way too many beets.  I didnt care for it at all.  I had the brussel sprouts which were delicious. Our friends tried the tumeric cauliflower, and no one liked it. I also had the chicken wraps and said they were very salty.   I have been here before and have had the Ahi appetizer and I should have stuck with that.  Worst thing about our experience was all the dishes on our table -they need to bus tables better.  They didn't bus our table until we were ready to leave so we had plates stacked up and glasses everywhere and beer glasses of beer that we drank. On a good note, I'm a fan of their beer and they have lots of great choices.  My husband enjoyed his 1/2 rack of ribs and they have great fries."
Andrea M.,"Findlay, OH",8,15,8,5.0,10/11/2017,Amazing desserts! Love the warm cookie and ice cream! Yummy!  Always fantastic service from the staff too.
Andrea G.,"Nashville, TN",20,2,1,2.0,9/25/2017,Decided to come here and give it a try ... Got there and 5 minutes in saw a Cockroach well my friend fid behind me crawling on the wall. Should've left after this but i was starving. The booth they sat us in the light was out used my flashlight on my camera to read the menu. Waitress saw me didnt offer to move us. We literally moved ourselves to another booth with lighting. The cuscus mac & cheese DISGUSTING feels like your eating caviar. Ordered the california sandiwch it was okay. Other than that would NOT recommend this. NOT worth the money.
Amber M.,"Murfreesboro, TN",38,31,27,1.0,5/19/2017,"Well..  great atmosphere but...  my salad was bit lack luster...  I got the Santa fa chicken salad.  There was suppose to be a a whole chicken breast on my salad but if it was a whole breast, it was from a Bantam hen.  AND they forgot the avocado so I asked for it and they gave me a sad little, tiny serving dish of it..  I'd didn't really feel I was getting my $13.75 worth for this salad. Also, my husband orders an alcoholic drink and they asked for his ID which was fine but they actually had to take the ID back to the kitchen to show the manager?  Wth!  We are almost 50 years old!  Lol Server was actually pretty good.  Seemed like management/kitchen issue.  :/ 5/19/17 Servers was better but they over changed me by $30!!  Manager corrects the charge but no sympathy there....  did give a crap..  wow!! Hard to believe"
Robert E.,"Murfreesboro, TN",215,153,,4.0,8/4/2017,"Plenty of parking and excellent location in the Avenues. Went for lunch on a Friday and was seated immediately. Our wait staff was quick and very attentive. I especially liked that wait staff had tablets and typed our order right at the table. The menu is very extensive- salads, burgers, light entrees galore, many options for small plate dishes. I had the Ahi Tuna salad and it was a filling portion and very tasty. My wife had the barbecue chicken salad and enjoyed it also. We will return to try other delicious looking dishes!"
Komal S.,"Indianapolis, IN",313,148,292,3.0,3/6/2017,"I'm not in Murfreesboro much, but my brother lives here and really enjoys coming here. This is your typical American restaurant with some pretty great beer and good food.  The beer selection is great and I love that they have beers brewed by BJ's. And yes, the food is good. The desserts, even better. Everyone raves about the pizookie there is definitely a reason why. It's a warm cookie of your choosing and you choose the type of icecream. Delish.  So why only 3 stars? The service. Even when they aren't very busy the service hasn't been great or even good. If that improved this place would have a lot more going for it."
Shanna F.,"Crossville, TN",0,13,8,4.0,12/22/2017,"Ok, I have to be honest. At first this restaurant selection was just to appease the kids and my husband, who likes craft beer. I noticed the book-like menu and commented that there was no way a restaurant could specialize in anything with such an expansive menu. My expectations were low as I ordered the Chicken Thyme dish and substituted the rice for a baked potato. Our meals came to our table in about 15 minutes(insert my smirk), And at least from the appearance, mine looked delicious. And guess what? It was! Two chicken breasts in a perfectly seasoned broth and topped with roasted brussel sprouts paired with a glass of Pinot Grigio.....heavenly! My husband's pork chop was thick, juicy, and tender. Everyone was happy!!! Our waitress Miranda was knowledgeable and helpful as we made our selections, and we wanted for nothing our entire visit. Lesson learned: Copping an attitude could cause you to miss a delicious dining experience."
Ames H.,"Lewisburg, TN",1,34,34,2.0,7/19/2017,Liquor license pulled???  Whole bar with liquor none of which can be purchased. Beer only during my visit.  This is ridiculous.  Who lets crap like that happen?
Jeremy B.,"Atlanta, GA",151,334,1179,5.0,1/14/2017,always my go to spot for a good meal . I had plans on grabbing some chipotle & then I spotted my favorite restaurant! The menu here has improved quite a lot since I fell in love  with this place 6 years ago. I'm addicted to the Mediterranean chicken pita  tacos which are amazing  & they offer a plethora of beers  to choose from. Of course you can't leave without grabbing a delicioso pizookie! . Man you won't be satisfied if you pay this place a visit & there's a million TV  for the sports junkie!
Dale B.,"Murfreesboro, TN",0,53,,3.0,11/13/2017,"Our third visit to BJs, may very well be our last. First, we seated quickly, server was good. I ordered the Jambalaya again, because no one else serves it but this time was different. I love Cajun food, spicy is great. It's the only thing I've ordered here and the first two times it was great, but this time they over did it with the cayenne pepper. I should have ordered a beer but I was driving. My wife was okay with her shrimp and pasta, but not enough to order it again. We were seated just behind the hostess station and someone had dropped a napkin in the aisle and at least 12 servers walked around it or stepped over it before it was picked up, the same thing happened with a food item. A manager was there, but he didn't bother to do anything. Impressions are important."
Maria K.,"Nashville, TN",127,187,82,4.0,10/24/2016,"I lived in Dallas for two years, and BJ's was a really popular spot. I probably would go there several times a semester. I was so excited to see that they opened one in Murfreesboro, I can't believe it took me this long to go and try it out! This is just a really chill spot with a great beer and food selection. I got a super simple meal; grilled chicken and white cheddar mashed potatoes. It was great with my glass of white wine. Prices were normal for a barish place. Very similar to Chilis or O'Charleys. Our service was great. We had a big group and the waiter was very attentive to our needs. My only complaint is that it took a little more time than usual to get our food out. I will definitely be going back in the near future!"
Chris S.,"Antioch, TN",1,12,48,1.0,10/1/2017,"My salmon pizza tacos was a joke! The Sam in itself is literally 1 inch long!! I literally measured it because I could not believe how small it was. I did call the restaurant and asked if it was supposed to be the smalland they told me they would send me a gift card in the mail. I really didn't care about the gift card, I really just wanted salmon tacos!"
Jason A.,"Johns Island, SC",8,144,141,2.0,5/13/2017,"This place has a massive menu. Which I think makes it difficult to have every menu option be something special. I had the California Club, and I was not impressed. It was extremely bland and the fries that came with it had an odd taste to them. I think if they would down size the menu and focus on what they do good this would be a better place to get food. Since it is a chain restaurant I don't see them making any changes unfortunately."
Tabitha S.,"Murfreesboro, TN",46,219,9,2.0,5/19/2017,"We went to BJs on a monday night which happened to be 1/2 off deep dish pizzas. Unless you like A LOT of bread and little to no sauce and skimpy topping I suggest ordering something else, even if it isnt half off. If you do decide to go with the deep dish ask for extra sauce and cheese. My hubby had left overs and when he went to eat them he had to add more sauce and cheese for it to even be tasteful. I LOVE deep dish pizza but the amount of bread compared to the sauce and toppings you get is way out of wack. All three pizzas brought to our table has the same complaints by those eating them.  Those who did not order the deep dish pizzas seem to enjoy their meals but they didnt get the pizza."
Brad S.,"Nashville, TN",57,1,,2.0,10/21/2017,Funny thing is the food is great... way over priced and VERY UNDER STAFFED... still like the place... just sucks u can't be better served the bundle of dallors ya spend...
Ameila H.,"Murfreesboro, TN",0,1,1,4.0,2/12/2017,Went before as a group and our waiter forgot us. Took 2 hours to get our food. The manager let us all have free meals and desurt but it took us a while to go back.  Went back as just a couple and had a great time. Steak and burger was perfect and the blood orange sangria so yummy. Went back later and had a great time. Its not that expensive but if your looking for desent food and drink that womt break your wallet this is the place.
Shelly R.,"Murfreesboro, TN",0,9,7,4.0,10/10/2017,"BJ's is a cool place. The menu is HUGE, and I love their Oktoberfest beer. I love the deep dish ziti. Good atmosphere, but definitely love the range of food items you can get."
Shannon F.,"Manchester, TN",0,1,,2.0,12/10/2017,"I ate at BJs in Murfreesboro back when they first opened and it was delicious! I met friends there last night and was disappointed to see that the entree I ordered previously was no longer on the menu.  My husband and I both orders steaks. Both were pink in the middle which is fine because that is how we ordered them, the problem is that they were both dry as a bone. I've never seen a steak that was pink in the middle that had absolute zero juice flowing from it. My guess is that they had been sitting under a heat lamp for some time along with our sides. One of our friends ordered a house salad along with their meal and I kid you not they brought him a plate of chopped lettuce. No toppings! We ate around 3:00pm so the restaurant was not busy."
Laura W.,"Murfreesboro, TN",1,18,,5.0,6/17/2017,"Variety of  palate pleasing choices and Signature dishes  When you walk into BJ's the first thing that will catch your eye is the architectural design which includes interior brick and an open industrial ceiling.  The lightening is also has a industrial feeling giving the restaurant and bar stylish relaxed atmosphere. But really, the people make the place.  The wait and bar staff are usually great. There is an extensive variety of meals, appetizers, drinks, signature dishes, hand crafted drinks, vegetarian and even a few gluten free choices is extensive. BJ's also features  handcrafted beer.  I'm not a beer drinker but people who are say it's a plus. My favorite drinks are their cream soda and root beer floats. Other specialties include Chicago-style pizza  and Pizookies (basically a pizza cookie topped with ice cream) I wish they had more whole food, low calorie choices such as Granola Yogurt & Fruit Salad and Yogurt and Granola Trifle for instance. BJ's has a rewards program which gives you a point per dollar spent.  Point may be used as follows: 75 Points = $5 Off 100 Points = Free Pizookie 150 Points = $10 Off 350 Points = $25 Off They have worthwhile daily specials as well as a well stocked bar, hand crafted drinks and big screen TV's."
Leigh C.,"Nashville, TN",1,19,,2.0,9/23/2017,"I used to really like BJ's. I was a fan when they opened and went fairly regularly. It's a little pricey for the quality, but I would have given it four stars. Last night my meal was inedible. I'll preface this with the fact that I love salt. I'm not above licking the salt at the bottom of the chip bag. However, the asparagus last night was truly disgusting and tasted like the top to the salt shaker fell off while someone was cooking. And the steak I ordered medium well was medium rare. The server (who was wonderful) repeated ""medium well"" back to me, so I know it was not a misunderstanding and just something that happened in the kitchen. Both of my sides were really cold. The spinach dip was good, but the chips were stale. I don't know what's happening in the kitchen, but I hope they get it together."
Korreen M.,"Murfreesboro, TN",0,17,1,4.0,4/2/2017,"It was the third time we ate at bj's. My husband who is from England had the fish and chips and loved them! Said they are the best he had in the USA. I had the Santa Fe chicken salad, I wish I could say it was the best I had. First of all, the heart of romaine lettuce was full of too many hearts. The salad could Benefit from iceberg lettuce and arugula and less totilla strips. My salad was suppose to come wth avacado but that was left off so after pointing it out to our very good and attentive waiter the manager came to our table with avacoda and an apology as well as being very gracious and took the salad off our bill!  This was a well needed meal out, we were celebrating a new job so when they made it right and beyond we were very pleased and appreciated.  Love the atmosphere and variety of dishes on the menu as well!  We will be back for sure!"
shaun p.,"Nashville, TN",49,72,24,3.0,7/24/2016,"I had a nutty Brewnette which was great  and we had the stuffed mushrooms. The mushrooms where good I had the bison burger which was good cooked med rare the way I wanted it.Now why it got 3 stars sever had way to many tables the only thing he brought to the table was our waters bar drinks, app and entrees all brought by different servers he never checked back on us I had to stop him for the stuff we needed he may have been new. Nothing was over the top good the place was busy tables around us were all complaining I guess we got abit lucky I also so had a draft root beer which was the highlight of the visit it was rich and smooth just like I remember as a boy. Don't believe I will be back it just wasn't worth the prices and service was very sub par he didn't know much about the food or beer"
Ashley D.,"Nashville, TN",14,14,7,2.0,7/16/2017,"We stopped in to BJ's on our way home from Chattanooga for a late lunch. We sat at the bar and ordered a lot of food -- wings 2 ways, gluten free pizza, a salad with chicken, and a burger and fries. Most of the food was alright, but all of the food tasted like it was made with really cheap and processed ingredients. The burger, however, was absolutely inedible. I don't know if it had somehow been contaminated with a cleaner or chemicals, but it tasted terrible. When we told the bartender, he sweetly took it off the tab, but no one acknowledged or asked about the chemical taste-- I hope they get that figured out!"
Victoria L.,"Nolensville, TN",470,31,64,2.0,12/10/2016,"This place looks cool and new so I had to give it a try. I actually would've given this place a 2.5. I had high expectations because it seemed good from the menu pics and etc, but I was wrong. The food was terrible honestly. I just didn't like anything about it at all. I've gave it a second try and it was still the same. I just didn't like it. I kept giving this place a try until I realized how bad this place really is... BUT! I went back for just dessert and oh my gosh!!!!! The dessert is to die for. Pizookie is bomb.... I would come back for the dessert only! Everything else is over priced and sucked."
Deanna A.,"Murfreesboro, TN",66,99,41,5.0,1/27/2017,"They have wonderful food and drink choices. The place is clean and staff was friendly. The spinach dip was super tasty. And their buffalo burger is super yummy. Great atmosphere for date night, ladies night, or gathering with family and friends."
Jennifer B.,"Decatur, GA",0,69,,3.0,6/26/2017,"BJ's seems to be having some liquor licensing issues, so no cocktails!  I had the Brussels sprouts and the salmon salad, both very good. 3 stars for no liquor as I really wanted, no needed a cocktail."
Careasa G.,"Murfreesboro, TN",74,16,3,3.0,8/18/2017,"Our server was awesome!!!! She was able to provide suggestions for me, as I am Gluten Free and a pescatarian.  However, the food was not good.  I replaced my quinoa with brown rice.  The rice was hard and unappetizing.  Shrimp and veggies were nit very flavorful, but I could eat it.  My daughter had the peanut noodles and she couldn't eat it.  She said it was greasy and the sauce wasn't good at all.  Our first and last visit to this place."
Michael H.,"Murfreesboro, TN",10,77,12,1.0,6/10/2017,"It's a poor mans Cheesecake Factory with a menu so extensive it needs a table of contents and an index. The problem with trying to do so many different menu items is that nothing is really done well. My food was cold after waiting close to 40 minutes which just added insult to injury. Everything felt sticky to the touch as well, which was concerning."
Kris B.,"Memphis, TN",24,124,512,2.0,5/7/2016,Murphresboro dont have any good cooks!!! Greasy California Club was my wife's choice It was greasy and chicken was so thick it slid out of bread along with mushy avacado Waitress was nice and took it off check I had salmon and shrimp over quinoa   Was quite good but wife's fiasco made dining not a pleasure. Hard to enjoy when across the table are expressions of disgust
Andy M.,"Wayland, MA",3,4,,2.0,7/12/2017,"We didn't go for the more natural burgers or steaks, opting for vegetarian options - all pretty tasteless.  The service wasn't that great either - our server forgot to check whether our appetizer was ready for quite a while. Also - no licence for wine..."
