Jessica K.,"Christiana, TN",1,14,,1.0,8/19/2016,"Our office called in an order for 7 people.  They took the order over the phone but failed to tell us that some of the items we ordered from THEIR website weren't actually on the menu anymore.  So instead of coming to pick up food, our office assistant had to get there first, then find out, then place orders and wait there for them to be cooked.  That certainly didn't give them any time to make sure the rest of the orders were correct.  Any toppings or sauces that were stated to come with items were left out entirely, They did not include soups, gave us the wrong salad, and allowed over-cooked food to be boxed up and paid for. No thank you.  The grilled Mahi on the tacos was good, although the menu offers grilled or lightly fried, only to find out (again, only once we were there to pick up) - that 'lightly fried' is not an option after all.  This is no way to get repeat customers."
Nathan B.,"Murfreesboro, TN",42,5,,4.0,8/17/2016,Good food good beer but that bar irritates me. All those liquor bottles that are just wasted up there. I know I'm weird for saying that. It's a little pricey in my opinion but I haven't had a bad experience.
Zathan P.,"McKinney, TX",8,36,34,5.0,9/11/2015,This place has been awesome since they first opened up in Murfreesboro. It's so many options to choose from and their beer selection are amazing grace!!!!! Make sure you try their deep dish pizzas!!!! They now have Lemon pepper wings!!!!! This is our spot and we try to go once a week!!!!!! You will not be disappointed!!! Fast service and always great service!!!!!
Sarah T.,"Charleston, IL",2,48,30,4.0,7/29/2015,This place just opened where my parents live. It took them a minute to get to our table. They have lots of choices I mean lots!! I started with the a black cherry soda that is made there. It was pretty good.  We had the southwest egg rolls for starters. They were fried crispy and came with 2 dipping souces.  I had the deep dish raviolis it was tasty and a very large portion.  They have a reward card that you can get and the more you eat there the more you save which is nice if you eat there a bunch.  They were a little slow but that could have been because they just opened and we're getting into.the swing of things
Michelle B.,"Murfreesboro, TN",17,38,10,4.0,8/8/2015,"Hawaiian Mahi Mahi was very good.  Hubby had the Cherry Chipotle Salmon which was excellent.  Beer selection pretty good.  I wish they had their 2 darkest beers available, but due to something with the state of TN they were not available.   Definitely will be coming back for more good food & beer! I did think it was very loud, so if you are looking for a quiet ambience this is not it.   Go early I you want to be seated in a reasonable amount of time. Otherwise be prepared to wait over an hour!"
Will A.,"Smyrna, TN",7,46,3,5.0,9/5/2015,"You couldn't ask for a better combination of beer, atmosphere and food. I love this place! The food isn't your run-of-the-mill variety, and it's beautifully executed. They go out of their way to please. The building invites you to a spacious, yet hip look. Large classy bar stocked, 30+beers, including their own brews."
Emily S.,"Murfreesboro, TN",300,3,,2.0,7/19/2016,"I've been here about 4 or 5 times since it opened about a year ago...i want to like it SO MUCH but I just don't. I love the way it's decorated, it seems clean enough and the bar area is aesthetically pleasing to the eye....but that's about where the good ends. The service is AWFUL and the food is just...average at best. I've gotten something different every time due to their extensive menu but nothing has even come close to impressing me. The last time I went was a few weeks ago and I will not be back."
Larry C.,"Knoxville, TN",0,21,,4.0,1/4/2017,"Great food and excellent service.  They have an interesting menu, the Mediterranean tacos are very good.  Roasted Brussel sprouts are also delicious and healthy."
Gerardo C.,"Berwyn, IL",0,25,11,4.0,5/10/2016,This is my favorite place for dinner. I have the nutty brunette when I'm there. I'm not sure if this restaurant is a chain but the service is top shelf here.
Keith P.,"Boyce, LA",0,5,,2.0,12/17/2016,"Food was good. Servers were bad. They spilt beer on three of us and barely apologized. They food was good when we got it. But they didn't bring someone's  sandwich because it got ""cold and hard."" When it was a cold sandwich. Took 30 minutes and several talks to the manager for them to bring the sandwich out. After everyone else had already ate. But the manger adjusted the ticket. Overall experience was average, but won't go back."
Kelly H.,"Smyrna, TN",136,9,4,3.0,6/11/2016,"I haven't exactly fell in love with this spot yet. Their beer selection is wonderful, and they usually have my favorite, Good People IPA, on draft. Which is a plus. Their menu is really, really big and there's so much to choose from that it can be overwhelming. We've had their wings, which were good. The southwest egg rolls were mediocre. Shrimp tacos were good. I'd say my favorite thing is their dessert. The cookies are amazing. So my suggestion is get a few beers, the cookie desserts (they're all amazing)....and you'll be set."
Alva B.,"Stone Mountain, GA",37,5,,1.0,3/29/2016,"The service Sucked! The food was lacking. I will not go back..ever! A person in our party didn't get food until it was time to go and the waitress didn't seem to show any concern. We had to get the manager involved and PS. Don't get the deep dish ravioli, the meat was of very low quality."
Scott F.,"Murfreesboro, TN",2,70,,4.0,1/14/2016,"Food was excellent. I'm not generally a fan of deep dish pizza, but what I got was quite good. My wife got the gluten free (alas, celiac) and that was surprisingly good as well. Beer selection is plentiful and the house brews are pretty good."
Rachel G.,"Alpharetta, GA",76,80,37,3.0,2/9/2016,"The food was delicious, however the menu is like 15 pages long. The staff was super friendly, but not very knowledgable on drinks that pair well with food options. (I used google.) I will go back and give it another try, and I'll know what to expect. Give it a try!"
Lisa K.,"Murfreesboro, TN",0,2,,2.0,11/2/2016,Burger was way under cooked and one of the waitresses came over to our table complaining about a table and also cursing. She was extremely unprofessional and because of her alone I will not be returning.
David H.,"Nashville, TN",0,23,,5.0,10/29/2016,What an awesome experience! Open until 1a.m. With a full grill and an extensive menu. I was there with my brother and his wife and had a great time with our bar tender/server Kelsey. She was very attentive and professional. The food is excellent and so many choices of beverages. We were there until 12:30 a.m.  Again Kelsey did a wonderful job. Thank you Kelsey. The Murfreesboro guy.. lol
Andi B.,"Hermitage, TN",1,35,23,5.0,8/15/2015,"Pretty good. Great service, dessert was great. Get the sores pizookie. Justin was our server he was very cool. My hubby had brisket burger and I had fish tacos. We had an appetizer, 2 drinks, meal and dessert for less than $70"
Grant G.,"Rockvale, TN",0,4,,3.0,7/31/2015,"Food was good, service was bad. They opened like a week ago and every server in the place still had a shadow. Way too many people running around. Took forever to get drinks. Way over priced for absolutely no reason. Party of 2, 4 beers, a 9"" pizza and a chicken club sandwich came to $65 without tip.  Not recommending to any of my friends just because of the ridiculous price to eat here."
Amy M.,"Casselberry, FL",93,16,,3.0,8/26/2016,Food way to expensive for the quality .... Husband got jambalaya and tasted like a bunch of cumin seasoning ! For 17 dollars rip off and bbq chicken. Salad had canned hard black beans and corn ! Fir 13 dollars rip off we will never be back it's never good for the price ... You might as well go across the street to bar Louis and get great food
Debbie S.,"Franklin, TN",1,3,,2.0,4/13/2017,"I have been to this location several times. In fact, my husband and I come to Murfreesboro from Franklin just to eat at this restaurant. We always sit at the bar. Our previous experiences have all been good ones. Yesterday we got there and a bartender named Eric R waited on us. Right away he was very inattentive. We ordered a beer each and when he sat mine on the bar the beer was running all down the sides and completely soaked the cocktail napkin leaving a large puddle on the bar. The second beer I ordered had a 1/2 inch chip out of the rim. How do you not notice this? When I pointed it out he took it away and continued making other drinks for the servers before pouring me another beer. When the replacement came, it was pouring down the sides and puddling on the bar again. He offered no napkins, I had to ask. The food was as good as usual. When a new bartender came on shift, he was more interested in talking to them than being interested in his only (two) customers. When we got ready to leave he didn't speak to us even though he was right in front of us. The other bartender told us to have a nice day and come back. I really like this restaurant and want to come back, but with that kind of service, I would not."
