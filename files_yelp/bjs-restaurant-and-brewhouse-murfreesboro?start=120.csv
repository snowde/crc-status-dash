Carrie H.,"Antioch, TN",39,47,78,1.0,9/27/2015,"Horrible food and horrible service. We were there for over 2 hours.... Not a second of which as pleasant. I had hear good things from classmates about this place but found it completely lacking. The service literally took hours and the food was over cooked and nothing special. They had beers listed on the menu they'd have... And server want even aware. Ugh, I won't be returning."
Bryan L.,"Murfreesboro, TN",150,296,61,3.0,12/10/2015,"Man, I hope this location gets on board with the ones in Florida. I get the emails, and lots of the specials and coupons are good everywhere.. EXCEPT HERE. Come on man!!!  And the Happy Hour is a lot more happy in other states too. Maybe because it's new and it is still riding that ""I'm the new place in Mufreesboro so everyone will come here now matter what we are going to be rich cash money millionaires"" wave. But still, I love the Pepperoni Flatbread. And they have a ton of great beer."
Donna V.,"Wartrace, TN",0,17,1,4.0,4/7/2016,"Visited for lunch and requested a booth in the lounge area. There are several TVs throughout the restaurant broadcasting news and sporting events. The service was excellent. The waiter was professional and friendly, prompt, and had full knowledge of the menu. We ordered new paninni-type items from the lunch menu. The food was hot, fresh and well presented, but the wrap was dry and bland, and the contents also lacked flavor. I'd return for another chance of selecting a better meal."
Andrew E.,"Murfreesboro, TN",1,23,26,4.0,3/29/2016,"Been here a couple times for lunch and dinner.  For dinner, especially on a Friday or Saturday night try to call ahead, if not you will be waiting.  It stays pretty busy.  However, it is worth the wait.  There are plenty of food options to choose from.  Everything I have had is delicious.  Their avocado egg rolls are great!  I have had their mediterranean chicken pita tacos and California chicken club, both are very good.  Service is very good and very attentive. Definitely recommend."
Rebecca F.,"Delray Beach, FL",3,11,1,1.0,7/13/2016,"The food is good, but the service is so bad!! I really WANT to like this place but they make it difficult. Last night for example... Tarted off rough- asked for a booth, got led to a table. Ok, no problem-easily corrected. Before we even sit down the server asks what we want to drink. I say Unsweetened iced tea.. He comes back with sweet tea. Now I'm a little annoyed, but still easily corrected.. I order a Caesar salad- but with no meat. I still meant that to be my entree, but ended up with a side salad.. By this point I'm not even bothering with letting the waiter know because I feel it's pointless. They bring out wings with sauce on them when my boyfriend ordered them without, but the waiter noticed and also brought some out without also.. Finally, we order the cookie trio, the whole reason for coming that night.. I ask my boyfriend what he thinks the Chances are of us getting the right flavors, given the service so far.. He guessed 25%. Well, They come out --al the right flavors (first and only win of the night), yet they were all burnt. Again, not worth complaining about because now we had been there an hour and a half and every single thing has been messed up... I really like some of the food here but it sucks that i spend most of the time wondering why they can't get it right."
Kevin P.,"Murfreesboro, TN",10,8,,2.0,10/6/2015,"I went not long after opening. As with others, our wait staff was a confused mess. Orders were wrong. Took us almost 2 hours to eat. Place has a lot of potential...so I do want to go back and see if they have improved. But no way I'm taking kids there again til I can be sure we can get out a little quicker."
Mike G.,"La Vergne, TN",0,11,,1.0,10/16/2015,$41.00 two entrees and a appetizer? Seriously?? The food sucked and the service was not much better. Child size portions that were not even served with bread. This hipster joint won't last.
Deidra L.,"Nashville, TN",10,22,9,3.0,12/30/2015,Meh.. The food was ok with service to match. The menu is massive and unoriginal. There are much better places in Murfreesboro. I will try again after the wait dies down. The beer is great though so maybe a good drinking spot.
Heather P.,"Colorado Springs, CO",14,146,182,2.0,8/15/2015,"They dropped the ball during lunch time. It was busy, however the wait time upon arrival wasn't too bad, about fifteen minutes. You give your phone number to the hostess and receive a text message when your table is available. (Hopefully your information is kept private but who knows.) Anyway, the hostess ended up yelling out our party's name and the text wasn't received until afterwards. We were led to a dirty table so the employee told us we'd have to go back and wait. Our waiting seats were gone so we stood awkwardly by the hostess stand for another ten minutes.  What I assume a manager (not in server uniform but black business attire) came over to seat us and led us to...the same dirty table. While we all stood staring at the infamous dirty table for a minute, I asked if we could just go ahead and sit down and wait on someone to come gather the glasses and wipe the table off. The ""manager"" said sure, left for about five minutes, and returned holding a wet rag and drink napkins and menus. ""I'm not sure exactly how to do this"" was said as the table was wiped off a little bit at a time and then dried with the drink napkins. Okaayy. After the glassware was picked up we finally received menus. And a menu it was. Granted about half was beer selection but whew it was like a small book. I ended up ordering the mahi-mahi fish tacos and since I couldn't decide between blackened and grilled, the server suggested one of each. We ordered an appetizer, calamari, which arrived about twenty minutes after initially ordering. The calamari was about eighty-five percent intact tentacles instead of rings. *shivers* By this point our drink glasses were empty. I'd say a solid twenty minutes passed with no server so we grabbed another server in our thirsty desperation. After another fifteen minute wait, our food arrives. Lukewarm food. My tacos are - tada! - fried. I was so dang hungry, I ate part of it anyway. It was so so. My friend's shrimp scampi was the same, so so. The garlic bread that came with it was as hard as a brick. I got a good laugh seeing my friend try to bite down on it. If you were wondering, our server didn't magically reappear until we had already starting eating. Go figure. Kind of crazy it took almost two hours from start to finish for lunch. I think this would be a cool place to grab a local craft beer with a pal but for food, me thinks not. Higher prices = higher expectations. As the Yelp two stars says: Meh. I've experienced better."
Alexander A.,"Nashville, TN",15,18,8,2.0,12/23/2015,"I personally like it because the Cajun Chicken Pasta is great. But I would def say it's VERY over priced and my wife has yet to have a meal there that she has enjoyed so we haven't returned and as the food specials and drink specials aren't nearly as good as some other places in town (Boulevard, Sam's) it's not for us."
Alice H.,"Murfreesboro, TN",0,2,,1.0,9/12/2016,"Came here this past weekend to get a burger.   Very, very greasy and they undercooked mine and over cooked my friends.  I really think they got the beef mixed up.   Had a piece of bone in mine.   Don't plan on going back.   Fast food burger would've been better and less money!"
Charlie H.,"Antioch, TN",0,15,1,1.0,12/9/2015,"Wow, where can I start. Let's see, what o thought could be a good place to grab a bite to eat ended up being pretty much a repeat of all these other reviews. 1. The server seemed like he was dazed and confused from the get go and didn't really ask if we'd ever been there as we flipped through the massive book of a menu, which is really too much to look at. 2. The drinks were sooooo sweet I thought maybe I'd ordered a glass of sugar with my alcohol 3. The food was atrocious, corporate frozen and bland. The apps were heavily breaded and just yuck 4. How do you mess up a hamburger?! Which the waiter said were the best, good suggestion bro. Ohhhh by overcoming it to well done and looking like it was dropped onto the floor. 5. No check back on how the food was, which is basic server 101. Skip this place altogether, seriously...If I could give zero, I seriously would. This place is def busy not because of the food but for the shoppers at the neighboring avenue."
Jim N.,"Plano, TX",0,36,1,2.0,8/22/2015,Lot of improvements needed. Saw five  yes five dropped glasses or orders on my visit. Two were by the bartender over the ice well. And NO he didn't clean it out. Although did look in there to see if there was glass slivers. Guess not. 20 minutes to receive first drink order. Table took 84 minutes from arrival. Apparently they don't want my money. Chili tasted just like Hormels.
Julie C.,"Murfreesboro, TN",1,3,,2.0,3/6/2016,"The atmosphere was good,  but the food was horrible.  I ordered an appetizer cueso cheese dip,  it came to the table cold,  I sent it back,  n still cold.  I ended up just earing the chips. Steak,  baked potato an broccoli is wat I had,  I ate the broccoli n potato,  they could have kept the steak n ate it themselves.  The steak was bland,  no flavor,  and tough as shoe leather.  I've never had a steak so awful in my life.  My daughter liked her meal,  I guess it was cooked right because it was fish,  I don't know can u go wrong in cooking fish?!?! That's was the first n only time that I will eat there! Unless I just go for drinks,  but definitely no food! Two stars.. Is for the drinks!"
Laura B.,"Scottsdale, AZ",3,40,1,5.0,11/1/2015,Love this place. Perfect brew pub with great service. Very comfortable when travelling on business alone. Good place to watch a game. My new 'Go to' place in Murfreesboro!
Tozia W.,"Murfreesboro, TN",184,3,,1.0,1/8/2016,"If you're a steak person, this isn't the place to get one. My steak came out overdone, and the steak seemed old and very bland. I started off with the honey sriracha Brussel sprouts, and they were overdone. The white cheddar mashed potatoes were amazing though. . . Overall experience was good but once again. Don't get the steak."
LaCresha M.,"Murfreesboro, TN",0,5,,5.0,2/22/2016,"Steffina was great! I would love to have her as my server again! And the food was amazing! And the General Manger, Tammy was very attentive and welcoming!! Will be returning again and soon!"
Susan A.,"Murfreesboro, TN",26,4,,3.0,11/5/2015,"Nice ambiance, but the food that was not supposed to be spicy was, and there weren't many choices if you don't want burning spice."
Taylor B.,"Antioch, TN",16,28,43,3.0,9/7/2015,Mediocre beer.  Mediocre food.  Mediocre service.  Food took 25 minutes to come out and was only okay.  I tried two of their house beers and didn't think they were anything to write home about.  Our server was unattentive.  Boo
Jason B.,"Smyrna, TN",0,94,2,2.0,9/26/2015,The service is the biggest issue. It seems as if they are all new and not at all familiar with the items on the menu or the process of order taking and delivery of food. It was not the only reason to complain. The cost of the food and the one drink I had were not at all a good value. A single cider cost as much as a six pack of the same so I guess the atmosphere is supposed to make up for it. The food was nothing special and the price was not really justified. I went once hoping to enjoy it but will likely never return. It's just noise and expense for little or no value or enjoyment.
