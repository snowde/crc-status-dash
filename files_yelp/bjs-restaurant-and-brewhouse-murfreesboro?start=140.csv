Meredith W.,"Murfreesboro, TN",0,9,6,5.0,11/15/2015,We really like BJ's. Large beer selection and great food. Call ahead so you don't have to wait so long.
Jimmy B.,"Murfreesboro, TN",0,2,3,5.0,11/7/2015,This place is great. They have an amazing flatbread pizza and their light beer tastes great.
Allen T.,"Murfreesboro, TN",45,9,,4.0,1/29/2016,"Food was good. I don't normally pay that much for pizza, but this place makes an exception."
Jay T.,"Murfreesboro, TN",0,10,,3.0,7/30/2016,"3rd time here. First time was just after they opened and it was great. 2nd time was good but not as good as the first. This time was disappointing. The Brussel sprout appetizer we loved so much was cooked to a crisp. Our orders took forever to arrive and they were not what the menu stated. Missing sides, missing ingredients. Overall the quality was a C- at best. Great beer. If you're looking for a place to have a good brew and a quick appetizer this is the place. Go somewhere else for dinner."
Sam B.,"Murfreesboro, TN",26,17,,3.0,1/21/2016,"Pretty okay. The wait staff can be hit or miss. And the food is pretty overpriced. But the cookie trio dessert is awesome,  as long as it comes out fully cooked. We've had warmed raw dough come out to us once.. maybe it was the oven"
Tina B.,"Murfreesboro, TN",0,8,,1.0,7/21/2016,"No beer sampling! Nope, nope, nope. At a BREWHOUSE. As a beer connoisseur, I was very disappointed to see ooodles of beer choices and you can't taste any - at all. Not one. Not even a thimbleful. The food is a little pricey and the brussel sprouts appetizer came out burned. I understand they don't want to lose $$ but, c'mon. There are plenty of other places in town you can go to & they don't make you feel like a cheapskate."
Jonathan S.,"Nashville, TN",1,25,12,5.0,8/17/2015,"We were told by the hostess that the restaurant opened three weeks ago. Our server was still a bit awkward and not 100% familiar with meal modifications we asked for, but we are pretty bad about modifying everything we order (dressing on the side, add hard boiled eggs, no tomato). Everything came out exactly as we ordered it, which was pretty impressive. The gluten-free pizookie was pretty darn amazing. Despite being obviously new, all of the staff was pleasant and responsive. We'll definitely be back!"
Mark N.,"Murfreesboro, TN",0,2,,5.0,7/5/2016,"We always receive excellent service and superior food seasoned perfectly. Luis, the managing partner exceeded our expectations this evening! This restaurant provides the most welcoming atmosphere. You just want to go back for more. Our favorite server is Cassie. Tonight we had Miranda who was terrific."
Jordan O.,"La Vergne, TN",0,10,,5.0,9/10/2015,PAZOOKI HEAVEN! Get one and your life may change.  I loved this place when I lived in Texas and am so happy to see it here now.
Mike F.,"Murfreesboro, TN",4,6,1,1.0,6/20/2016,I wish we liked it here my wife and I have been to BJs out in California many times and loved it but the one here in the Boro is horrible. The food is always greasy or under cooked even cold. Some good waiters and waitresses but very few and far between. For some reason they think it's a great idea to sit in the bar area during thier break counting the tip money chowing down on their food and joking around while customers are in the immediate area. I had one guy site across from me at another table un-button his black shirt completely so I could see his Superman shirt while putting his feet up on the chair so I could see the bottom of his muddy dirty shoes (pretty appetizing). Basically this place is overly unprofessional with bad chiefs and does a disservice to the BJ Brewhouse franchise.
Doug S.,"Nashville, TN",20,2,,5.0,11/17/2015,"Went Sunday around noon and the place was packed, was seated immediately. Ordered "" BJ's Favorite "" deep dish pizza, now I love Pizza and I must say, it was the best pizza I've had in a while. Service was fast and accurate, drinks were refilled often. Atmosphere is a little loud but it was bearable and Football was on every TV. No complaints here. Will go back soon."
Shanntel H.,"Chandler, AZ",1,5,,5.0,10/10/2015,I have dined at this Bjs a couples time now. The service is improving a lot since they opened. Staff is very friendly and high energetic. I highly recommend trying the spring rolls or the Brussel sprouts! Make sure you save room for a famous salted caramel pizookie! I will be back!
Kelly O.,"Murfreesboro, TN",0,11,4,5.0,5/26/2016,We have been coming here for many months since it opened and it has never disappointed. Service has always been on point and food is superb!  Only wish is that they had growlers!!  Maybe one day!!
Sara B.,"Murfreesboro, TN",4,9,,3.0,10/1/2015,good food when it comes out right. But the food is nothing special. Have friends that work there or I probably would not even bother returning.
Chelsey B.,"Murfreesboro, TN",1,6,1,5.0,9/23/2015,Just opened and I've been like 10 times! Haven't had anything I didn't like! The mushroom burger is amazing! The pizza is awesome! Great beer & wine!! Awesome staff! My fav place!
Ap A.,"Export, PA",0,11,,5.0,11/9/2016,"i got the ribs with white cheddar mash potatoes.   the ribs were excellent,  they were coming right off the bone.  the mash potatoes were also very tasteful.   i also had one of their beers which was good and cold.  i would recommend this place and would definitely come back next time im in murfreesboro."
Dee B.,"Rockvale, TN",1,22,3,1.0,2/12/2016,"Update to my review from 1/25/16 -- You can see the GM, Tammy Figueroa sent me a note asking me to call her to discuss my visit... I have called the number twice at different times of the day -- her phone message states "" the voice mailbox is not set up yet"" -- seems even the GM at this place either:  A:  does not really want to discuss the service, or  B:  does not know how to use her phone!  Either way, it's a lose/lose for customers.  Wonder if she ever picked up the phone for any customers for which she left her number!  Nice way to duck any discussion, and at the same time make it APPEAR as though the restaurant really cares!"
Eric S.,"Murfreesboro, TN",2,13,,5.0,8/25/2015,"Loved it here. Yes they do have more expensive menu items and it is reflected by the great quality and freshness of the food they pump out. This isn't a Chilis where you can get some frozen chicken wings for 7$. The food was fresh and had great flavor. I had a Oasis Beer that my sever suggested and it was great. I also had the Calamari appetizer and the Parmesan Crusted Chicken for my main course, all of which was very tasty and fresh. Final bill was 65$+ my 10$ tip and that included 1 app, 4 beers between me and date, 2 main courses. I'll be back to BJ's very soon"
Melissa M.,"Antioch, TN",63,8,,5.0,8/17/2015,This place was Nothing short of AMAZING!! So much beer/mixed drinks to choose from and tons of food choices! We were greeted and seated very fast. Our waitress was awesome. She answered all 1 million of our questions we had and didn't mind helping. My husband had the hamburger/brisket burger and it was HUGE and I had the jalapeño burger. (Both were great) This is the best place I have been to thus far. They did tell me they get super busy on the weekends so u may want to get there a little earlier. Hope everybody enjoys as much as we did.
Brittany S.,"Murfreesboro, TN",0,17,1,4.0,8/9/2015,"We tried out BJ's today for lunch. We got there right before 11, and our party of 6 was seated within 10 minutes. I'm glad we got there when we did, because it filled up fast! We tried the avocado egg rolls and stuffed mushrooms for appetizers. Both were great, but the egg rolls were definitely the favorite! Everyone at the table ordered something different, and everything was delicious. The service was average, everyone was nice, but you could tell the servers were a little overwhelmed with the rush. The food took a while to get to our table, and our drinks were empty a couple of times, but overall it was a great experience! I know they've just recently opened, so some of these things are to be expected.  We will definitely be going back!"
