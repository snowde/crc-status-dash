Josh O.,"Woodbury, TN",0,2,,5.0,4/21/2016,"I'v been here several times and every time it's great! Awesome beer selections and love the ribs. My opinion, it blows Peter D's out the water!"
Kathleen D.,"Murfreesboro, TN",0,3,,2.0,4/12/2016,"Last time I was here, the kitchen was almost an hour behind and my order was still wrong! Drinks are good though."
James P.,"Nashville, TN",0,2,,5.0,1/26/2016,"All the Staff is Geat!  Great Food and Drinks. My Wife and I have never been So Pleased with this Great, Restaurant.  The management is unbelievable.  Thanks for making our visits so nice of an experience!"
Leslie P.,"Nashville, TN",105,144,97,1.0,10/15/2015,"Our first experience at BJ's was pretty good.  We enjoyed the food more than the service, but overall we liked the food and ambiance, so we thought we'd try it again last Friday night.  Our experience then?  Terrible.  Food?  My particular selection, the appetizer sampler, $16 for overcooked and over-fried grossness.  Terrible.  Service?  Even worse.  We'd been seated for about 10 minutes and then finally a woman that looked like a manager came over and asked us if we had been greeted.  We told her no and she just tapped the next server she saw and asked him to help us.  He took our drink order and food order.  We never saw him again.  Two other servers brought out our food, but after that point, no one checked on us, refilled drinks, etc.  It took forever to receive our check and I could not wait to leave there.  A fourth random server brought our check.  Obviously, no one cared to take care of us AND to beat all, our booth was next to the server station!  I guess that's a table where customer service goes to die and that's why our patronage there will die too.  $56 for that experience?  Eek!  Methinks not."
Apryll L.,"Antioch, TN",27,6,2,4.0,4/1/2016,"Everything is good.  The waitstaff is very friendly and helpful.  The wait can be a little long at times, but worth the wait."
Michele E.,"Nashville, TN",5,2,,2.0,12/18/2015,"This place sucks. If I am going to pay $17 for app I don't want the chips to be stale the sauce to have way to much lime and the artichoke dip to be cold. I have had way better for less. Not to mention the service, we had to ask the waitress twice for silverware.  not a great experience."
Denise K.,"Evanston, IL",0,2,,1.0,2/27/2016,"Never again.  Not a fan in general because the food is so, so salty, but we brought an out-of-town guest.  We were told the wait was 45 minutes -- as I write this, we are at DOUBLE that and there's no end in sight.  Would've been fine if they told us the wait was 1 1/2 to 2 hours because we know the food isn't worth it and we would have gone elsewhere.  Won't ever be back.  I'll add poor customer service to the substandard food."
Suzanne B.,"Murfreesboro, TN",0,28,,4.0,8/21/2015,Great root beer! Bison burger was great. The mahi taco didn't have much meat but was tasty. Over pretty good.but I don't like the checking seating thing they do...unnecessary steps that are just a waste of time and space
William L.,"Murfreesboro, TN",0,12,,1.0,2/16/2016,"Terrible service, and food was not cooked correctly. They were great when they opened have continued to go down hill since then."
Scott B.,"Cumming, GA",0,9,,4.0,12/1/2015,"Greeted promptly at the door, and seated quickly, despite being a busy evening. Clam chowder and a wedge salad hit the spot this cool and rainy night. Kelsey T. Was an awesome server, prompt and attentive, and absolutely stunning to boot. I'm not a big fan of chains, but BJs is a regular stop on the road for me, and I've never had a bad meal."
Mike G.,"Murfreesboro, TN",46,8,,1.0,11/16/2015,"Do yourself a favor and don't go to this establishment. Rather go to Red Robin get a halfway decent burger. Go to Old Chicago and get a tasty pizza. Or go into your fridge at home and make your own sandwich because any of these three options is going to be far better than what BJ's has to offer. First off the food is just terrible, and I know it's super cool because it's a microbrewery and they make their own sodas and its brand new in this city but just because the turd is polished doesn't not make it a turd. I went here at lunch and I ordered their deep dish pizza for one it tasted like I was eating straight flower with no pizza sauce on it. After one slice I asked the waitress to bring me a menu so I can in hopes of redeeming this lunch time. But to no avail. I ordered their turkey and pesto sandwich thinking how can you screw up a simple chicken and pesto sandwich? Well leave it to BJ's to figure out how to do so. Now as a fat guy I love food I even love terrible food at times if I'm hungry but I will never be that hungry enough to go back to BJ's! So save your money and go literally anywhere else. Now if you are just going to drink some beers with your buddies then cool it serves its purpose as a microbrewery but it should be left is just that. I'm sorry if this comes off harsh but when you spend 25 $30 on a terrible lunch that in no way was redeemed and even after the server asked you was everything to your liking and you say not really and they do nothing about it then this is what you get an honest review from a guy who pretty much eat anything even if it's terrible."
Mindy S.,"Chandler, AZ",1,2,,5.0,10/19/2015,"LOVED this restaurant! From out of town, trying it for the first time.  Any issues we had were quickly handled by the manager, Melissa, who did it with a smile.  Super customer service.  Very friendly, upbeat service and great food/drinks.  Highly recommend it! Hope to come back before we leave town as the menu is huge!"
Brandon H.,"Murfreesboro, TN",6,148,81,5.0,8/23/2015,This is a brand new restaurant with an entire staff that is brand new. If youre a nit-picky diner I would suggest to wait a while and let them work the kinks out. I loved this place! The food was amazing and they have a vegetarian burger that I didnt see listed online! The house brewed beer was great too! I highly suggest this restaurant!
Nixon V.,"Murfreesboro, TN",0,1,,5.0,1/10/2016,When I'm visiting from out of town this is my goto spot! The hickory brisket is to die for. When the manager came to our table she was very polite and made sure our food was perfect to our liking. Everybody Im in touch with knows about this place. Hope to come back very soon!
Cory C.,"Murfreesboro, TN",0,21,,2.0,1/1/2016,"Wanted to try a new place, but wont be back. The place was kinda slow but full and it took forever to get our drinks ordered and out to the table. The prices were over the top in my opinion for the same chicken sandwich I can get at any of the 100's of places in murfreesboro. The kid's mac and cheese was literally box craft which is .88 cents a box and they charged over 5 dollars for that and a few sides. Way over priced. The food was good, but the price and the service will keep us away."
Linda P.,"Bell Buckle, TN",0,3,,2.0,7/7/2016,"I contemplated a one star review, but thought I'd be fair to the ambiance of the restaurant as well as the fact that the server refilled our drinks quickly.  Beyond that, the experience was terrible.  I've eaten at this same restaurant 3 times.  The first time was AMAZING.  So much so that my son and I were quick to return a week later.  I ordered a steak, my son ordered a pizza.  He has an allergy to tomatoes and asked if a no sauce pizza was available as they say they make their pizzas from scratch.  After many assurances that they could indeed make the pizza without sauce it arrived not only with sauce, but also topped with tomatoes.  The server took it back to the kitchen, along with my steak that was incredibly undercooked.  I specifically asked what their light pink center was (knowing every steak house has a particular verbage for their steaks).  They threw my steak onto the grill and commenced to bring it back very well done, while my son received his new pizza, minus the tomatoes on top.  That would have been great, except he took a bite and spit it onto his plate because there was sauce on it.  Fortunately his allergy is not life threatening (just a little itching on the tongue and neck), but it was frustrating when we found out that ALL THEIR PIZZAS have sauce on them.  We were told by the manager that came by our table to bring the new pizza that the crusts are proofed the night before with a bit of sauce on them, so it was impossible to make a truly sauce less pizza.  It would have been fantastic to know this when we told the server he could not have tomatoes.  The manager also took my steak back because it was very well done.  My son and I both left without eating our meal, but we did pay for our drinks and the salads we'd eaten.  This was our 2nd experience.  Since our first one had been so great, we thought the 2nd was a fluke error, and the server and manger had been nice, so why not try one final time?  It most definitely wasn't a fluke.  We arrived around 11:20 a.m., so they weren't busy, but we still waited a few minutes to be seated at one of the many empty tables.  Our server was friendly and took our drink order and was patient when we needed several minutes to look at the menu ( I will say that is a plus about this restaurant ....many, many selections to peruse).  Since we knew pizza was a big NO for my son, we both chose steak (mine included a scampi like shrimp).  I again inquired as to the exact verbage for a light pink center and was again told medium for light pink, medium rare for a warm pink.  Should be easy enough as my son and I ordered our steaks cooked the same way.  They both arrived with a very dark, rare center but we thought we'd soldier on and try it anyway.  INCREDIBLY chewy.  The first bite took about 5 minutes to chew enough to swallow.  Perhaps it was because it was so undercooked.  The server said it was indeed too pink and advised next time we ask for medium well.  Um....SHE recommended how we order it.  I ordered asparagus and mashed potatoes for the side.  The mashed potatoes were M.I.A but she advised I could take the asparagus off and eat it while waiting for the new steak.  She, however, took my sons entire plate, to include his fries, so he was left with nothing to eat.  I must say, the asparagus was very flavorful and made me really look forward to my newly prepared steak....until I received it.  My son's came back and was still too rare, and his fries were cold.  My steak came back incredibly over cooked and tasted like all the flavor had been cooked out of it.  The mashed potatoes were also cold, which I assumed could be surface cooling from the walk to the table, but when I separated them in the middle, they were cold throughout.  The scampi also had tomatoes in the picture, and since my son expressed interest in trying my shrimp, I asked if the tomatoes could be omitted.  I was advised they could, so imagine my surprise when there were no tomatoes on top, but we found 5 under the shrimp.  It was almost like they'd noticed in the kitchen they weren't removed, so they took off the top ones and flipped the shrimp, but there were still tomatoes under the breading and cheese.  No manager ever came to the table to discuss our meal with us, despite us seeing at least one, possibly 2 people that looked like they might be managers.  Imagine our surprise when the bill arrived and it was nearly $27.  They'd removed my meal, but charged me for my son's meal and our drinks.  I paid it, along with a tip for the server (I figured she didn't cook it, so why punish her), but had to go to the bar to get a to go box for my sons steak as the server never came back after dropping off the bill.  He didn't intend to eat it, but since we'd been charged for it we brought it home to daddy.  We figured he'd never know if it was overcooked or undercooked since he'd just throw ketchup on it!"
Kelly L.,"Murfreesboro, TN",0,2,,2.0,12/21/2015,"The food is SO good and my husband loves the beer selection! However...I have been 3 times and I have yet to get out of this restaurant in under 2 hours (not including wait time to be seated). I think last night will be my last time. It took an hour to get our food and when it arrived cold, we asked to speak to a manager. The manager never came over, but did comp 25% of our check. I've never had a manager refuse to come by when asked. Anyway, the food is good when it's warm and, I think, ordering to-go is probably your best bet."
Tim O.,"Murfreesboro, TN",0,2,,2.0,8/24/2015,"We were hoping BJ's was a good alternative in a town with very few pizza options.  Unfortunately, they confirmed my fears about eating chain pizza.  Had the deep dish, too greasy and salty, little taste.  The service was also poor having to wait 15 minutes for the check after we finished. Won't be rushing back...."
Bree M.,"Lafayette, TN",0,5,,3.0,8/16/2015,"The food was excellent, but the service was terrible. We got our soups before we got appetizers that we had ordered 25 minutes prior. It took FOREVER to get our food and each person's food came out at different times. We will try it again, but not until they get the service and speed of the kitchen smoothed out."
Bruce G.,"Murfreesboro, TN",0,2,,5.0,11/24/2015,"Great beers. Try the 5 oz. Sampler. Four of the BJ varieties of your choice; 20 oz. of beer for only a dollar or so more than a 12 oz. glass. Oh, and the food is really good too."
