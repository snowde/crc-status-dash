David C.,"Murfreesboro, TN",9,9,1,2.0,10/6/2015,"Very loud, very discombobulated/disjointed feel to flow and decor. Place can't figure out if it's a sports bar or a restaurant. Drink and food Menu are all I one and is quite large, 16+ pages, and not well put together. Once seated, Took 15 minutes for our server to come to our table and take drink order. The drinks took another 15 minutes or so to come and they looked like they had been sitting at the bar waiting for pick up. My glass was sticky from where it had overflowed presumably when it was made. They were not busy, maybe 2/3 full on a Tuesday evening. The food was fine but nothing memorable. Everything took a very long time to come out. The Avocado Egg rolls were pretty tasty and the mozzarella and tomato salad was good, so it seemed promising. I had a sirloin. It was a good cut and cooked to my liking but it wasn't seasoned at all, not even salt and pepper. The potatoes were very bland as well. My wife's chicken pita tacos tasted odd, we couldn't put our finger on it. Not terrible but def not good. Server took a long time to get our check and then never returned. Another server took care of it. We were there for almost 2 hours, and like I said, they were not busy. It's not the worse place, the food is ok, just ok, but there are many other restaurants I'd go to before ever going back, if ever."
Kimberly K.,"Pensacola, FL",0,6,,2.0,9/21/2015,"We went on a Sunday afternoon (9-20-15). Our server was not real friendly and told one person at our table that they don't serve Michelob Ultra. He ordered something he was unfamiliar with, then we saw another server deliver 2 Michelob ultras across from us We caught our server and asked to change our order to Michelob ultra. Again she said they don't carry it. We pointed to the other table. She said she would ""try"" and hopefully could get it before they poured the other. (Not really my problem, she should know her menu and Michelob is a pretty common choice). She came back and acted like she had done us a favor by catching them in time.  She continued being distant and not really friendly after that.   Then we watched a different server at the table next to us roll her eyes while waiting for the people at that table to give her their order. This had us thinking that was the general tone of the staff here.    We have enough other choices in Murfreesboro that I think I will spend my money elsewhere."
Carla E.,"Murfreesboro, TN",0,88,5,3.0,8/29/2015,"Another excellent meal with spotty service.  Been here three times now, never once have I seen a manager around.  Need to get their eyes on the front of the house."
Mike R.,"Murfreesboro, TN",39,1,,2.0,8/16/2015,"I have been to BJs 3 times now and it has gotten progressively worse. I was there opening night, on 7/27, and everything ran like clockwork.  The food was delicious and everything came out very quickly, even the deep dish pizza which was very good.  We went there about a week later and things were much slower, but the food was still very good.   We just sent went this weekend for a third time and it was terrible.  We used the BJ mobile app to call ahead and when we got there we were seated rather quickly.  After we were seated, it took us a long time just for someone to take our drink order, which was 2 waters and an adult beverage.  It was not the same person that ended up being our waitress so I think they were in the middle of a shift change.  We got our waters and then waited...and waited...and waited.  We finally had our waitress come to the table to take our order. Still no adult beverage...which was one of their signature drinks.  Eventually, the mixed drink came.  Then we waited, waited and waited.  Our waitress came back to check on us and my wife ordered a beer.  We waited some more and finally our food arrived.  My wife's food was perfect, the Parmesan crusted chicken, but the beer she ordered 10 minutes earlier was still not there.  My burger however, burnt to a crisp.  I tried to eat it but could not.  I sent it back and waited.  My wife eventually finished her meal.  Still no beer.  Still no burger for me.  We waited and waited some more.  I finally had to cancel my order and her beer and we left.  If the management can get the bar and kitchen in order, I would recommend this place.  If not, I would avoid for a few more months.  That might be a good idea anyway as they still do not have all of their beers available (their porter and stout) yet either."
Phillip U.,"Downtown, Memphis, TN",0,13,2,1.0,10/29/2015,"We were greeted with about a 15-20 minute wait...not bad for Thursday night. After being seated our waiter took our order and the table next to us arrived a few minutes later.     While we waited on our food the folks at the next table ordered, received their drinks, had appetizers, and began their dinner. All while we waited...and waited...and waited.  We didn't have anything special, just a chicken salad and a hamburger with fries. Funny thing happened while ordering, when I asked a question about an entree the waiter had to look at someone else's plate to see what the answer was...he had no idea.  During our time waiting he did tell us our food was on the way, I don't know what way it was on but it was another 15 min before it arrived.  He said later there were no runners to bring the food out, I would beg to differ as most people know food that is ready sits under the warmer and the plates get very hot...ours wasn't even warm. I pointed out the quick service at the next table and he was like a deer in headlights-he didn't even understand.  I felt certain we would be visited by the manager but he never came. When we finally received the check I quickly tried to pay and it was another 5 min before the our server returned to the table. After dropping off my receipt the guy physically ran away from our table. Our server was probably a very proficient person but it appears he was set up to fail. The kitchen was probably a disaster and he had to cope with its effects with little managerial support. Mediocre food, desperately poor service."
Wendy J.,"Murfreesboro, TN",3,14,,2.0,1/5/2016,"First and last trip there. My uncle arrived before us and got a table the server took a good 15 min to come get our order after all four of us were seated. Then our food took 35 min to get to the table which was a bit long considering our order consisted of 2 salads, a soup,a kids Mac and cheese, and a  veggie burger. All the food came out separately and my salad came out last, a good 5 min after everyone else's. I ordered the asparagus and portobello salad and it didn't have asparagus on it so I had to ask for that and wait for it to be brought out. My daughter's Mac and cheese and my husbands fries were cold so it was obviously sitting back there awhile. Also the veggie burger looked suspiciously like a turkey burger. We asked the server and he said it was a veggie burger but my husband didn't trust it so he didn't eat anymore of it after that.  Also I never once saw a front of house manager on the floor which is not usually a good sign."
