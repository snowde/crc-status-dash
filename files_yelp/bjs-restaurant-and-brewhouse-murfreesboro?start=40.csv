Matthew B.,"Hinckley, IL",61,6,,5.0,7/4/2017,Stopped here driving through the area. A little of the interstate but worth it. Awesome atmosphere and awesome food. We shared a flatbread pizza for appetizer and it was excellent. My daughter and I split a deep dish cheese pizza and it was great. The service was also very good. Would definitely recommend this place and hope to be able to swing by again.
Stacey J.,"Hendersonville, TN",19,18,,2.0,8/20/2017,I was here on a Thursday night we sat at a booth in the bar area. I ordered the chicken club sandwich with fries. The sandwich was just ok maybe not one of the better menu choices. The fries were cold. The atmosphere is nice. Not a big fan probably won't be back.
Hawk O.,"Clive, IA",2,71,1,4.0,6/11/2017,I really like the place. Very friendly staff. Eating at the bar by myself( looser).Not really travel here to my family. We have come here a few times. It has not been open all that long. Before this place. There were no nice sports bars as far as I know. Family loves the pizza and I always seem to get a good steak. Also have all the sports available on Tv if that is what your looking for along with good food.
Andrew S.,"Murfreesboro, TN",110,140,,1.0,9/24/2016,Ugh. We had such high expectations before eating here. The menu looked so good and they offer so many great beer options. I am not sure we will ever come back.  I ordered the strawberry mojito but it didn't taste much like strawberry and not much like a mojito either. At least it was strong.  I ordered the ribs. They were okay but I don't like when ribs come with sauce already on them. I prefer them naked but the menu didn't indicate they would come with sauce. The broccoli that came with it were tasteless. I also had the tomato bisque which was very average.  My wife ordered the chicken tacos on the reduced calorie menu. Even she had to add salt to make it taste even halfway decent. That shouldn't happen with tacos.  I tried a bite of my mom's hamburger and it was also tasteless. The only thing that was good was my dad's Ribeye although it's hard to screw up steak.  As if the food and drinks being poor was bad enough the service was terrible. It took forever (over 30 minutes) for our food to come out and our toddler had a meltdown since she didn't have any food.  I really wished this place was better.
Megan W.,"Nashville, TN",0,6,1,4.0,5/28/2017,The bar is stocked and the menu is loaded with lots of different options to chose from! They have lots of seating and we didn't have to wait long for a table. Everyone was pleased with their meal and we will definitely be back :)
Karen B.,"Brentwood, TN",0,83,6,3.0,10/6/2017,"We love eating at BJ's! We moved here from SoCal where we frequented BJ's in Laguna and Irvine. Always spot on, and we LOVE the Pizookie! Just wish they had a closer location to Brentwood. Murfreesboro is 20miles out."
Mackenzie D.,"Bradenton, FL",85,16,,1.0,11/6/2016,"Atmosphere: lots of TVs! A great place to watch sports while eating with your friends. It is classier than a sports bar, and streamlined with all other BJs I have ever gone to.  Service: I was with a medium sized group, about 6 to 10 people, and it took about an hour for us to get our food. Our waiter was very friendly, but I was very disappointed with how long we had to wait.  Food: I got the Santa Fe chicken salad, and it felt like a waste of money. There was too much dressing, semi-wilted lettuce and not enough toppings."
Vu N.,"Atlanta, GA",43,3,3,3.0,6/24/2017,"Not too bad, just like every other BJs I've been to.  Just never order the lettuce wraps.  Probably one of the worst appetizers I've ordered.  That dipping sauces tastes horrible and the chicken was half ass.  Other than that,  beer and atmosphere was good"
John N.,"Murfreesboro, TN",0,5,,4.0,6/21/2017,"BIG menu, something for everyone. Service is good but tends to be a little slow.  GREAT beer selection, and their house brews are (for the most part) excellent!!  If you are a beer lover, this is the place for you.  The food is very good, especially the pizza!"
Tia G.,"Murfreesboro, TN",140,104,125,4.0,8/20/2016,"I am completely a fan of BJ's!  They do have a really long menu, but that means you have plenty of delicious choices to choose from!  :)  My favorites: (1) They seriously have one of the best deep dish pizzas in the area!  (2)  Their pasta dishes are also very good! (3)  The pizookies are everything!!!  If you don't get anything else, get a pizookie!  They do have happy hour specials and pretty good cocktails.  I don't drink beer, but it's a brewhouse, so they have quite the selection of beer.  The only ""poor"" experience I have had has been around large party checks.  They usually mess up the checks if there is a large party (3 out of the 4 times I've been there with a large party), but it wasn't a big deal.  They are apologetic and fix the errors quickly.  The staff is extremely helpful and nice.  This is one of my favorite places in Murfreesboro!"
Brandon C.,"Norco, CA",0,2,,1.0,5/27/2017,This is the third time we have tried this restaurant    We will NEVER try it again   Finally got a date night and so excited for prime rib but after one hour and eight minutes are food arrived and was ice cold.   Mashed potatoes were hard as a rock and the green beans were so cold they were stiff as a board.   Prim rib had sat there so long that my rare pice of meat was grey in the middle   It was so well done that I had to saw through it.     I am not one to complain all that much but the same experience three times in a year.   Will not wast my money there ever again
Amy S.,"Murfreesboro, TN",13,125,117,1.0,1/1/2016,"I'm so disappointed with this place. I guess it's so busy from the shoppers from the avenue.  Our waitress, Erica, was very mediocre and didn't seem to want to be there. She didn't have any life to her presence.  We ordered drinks, which took quite a long time to arrive but they were okay. Also was very overpriced. We had the calamari which was cooked perfectly but I could do without the lemon aioli sauce. I had the mini pizza which is seriously overpriced.  My mom had the north mahi mahi with shrimp and she hated it, the squeezed too much lemon juice on top.  Won't be coming back unless it's for a friend or a gathering."
Kyle M.,"Nashville, TN",42,3,,3.0,2/28/2017,The honey sriracha brussel sprouts are good.  Our waiter was good.  My most recent visit is slightly better than my first but I still don't see the appeal of the place as such a great place.  I've had better.
Josh S.,"Fort Wayne, IN",0,8,,5.0,3/18/2017,"One of my favorite restaurants to go to, great food and awesome selection of beer. Came to Tennessee for a business trip and was really happy to find this near my hotel."
Jevon L.,"Birmingham, AL",6,34,34,4.0,2/8/2017,"Descent place, lots to choose from. The hubbs and I ate here while visiting my brother n law in TN. He loves it. I imaging the drinks and beer is good too but I'm pregnant and couldn't partake. But I will next time."
Beth F.,"Murfreesboro, TN",28,56,57,1.0,6/19/2016,"Every time we come in here, they mess up our order!!  Seriously!!  We keep coming back, they TRY to ""make it right"" by giving us gift certificates, but they keep getting our orders wrong!  Very frustrating.  We don't ask for unicorns or gold chips, we just want extra cheese or add meatball to a pizza, and have it come out hot! Ryan, the Kitchen Mgr., was embarrassed, and asked us to give them another chance ...   Hmmm, we'll have to see."
Hope C.,"Knoxville, TN",128,4,,4.0,2/6/2017,"We've enjoyed going to Bjs. The several times my husband and I have been, we've each gotten a diff salad. I think we've tried all of the salads at this point, and my favorite is definitely the honey crisp salad with honey mustard. My husband highly enjoyed the Santa Fe which did look and taste delicious. The salads come premixed with dressing which is a nice touch; the portions are generous. We've also tried the avocado spring rolls and the California flat bread pizza as appetizers. The rolls were awesome, the pizza was nothing to ride home about. We have also tried the triple choc pazookie which was delicious.  The service has been good. Great place to watch a game too!"
Danielle S.,"Antioch, TN",5,14,,4.0,5/28/2017,"Been here a few times and it's always busy at peak times. I or the people that accompanied me didn't get complicated orders. Burgers, salads and one friend at a visit got a steak. It was ok, everything was prepared correctly. Service 2 out 3 visits was great. I don't really expect much from BJ's, maybe a small step up from Friday's, Applebees or Chilis. A place with a wait during peak times for average food and drinks outside of Nashville."
Harvey H.,"Murfreesboro, TN",0,41,22,3.0,11/22/2015,"This place new in the Boro is ok.  I wasn't to pleased with the long wait at the restaurant.  Plus, the food was ok; didn't really excite me.  Average place to go eat... If you are use to good food this is not the place; they have plenty of good beers to pick from though!!! If you love BEER this is your place - lol!!! Enjoy."
Queen B.,"Murfreesboro, TN",0,13,,1.0,4/7/2017,Inadequately staffed when I went at lunchtime. Meal was comparable to fast food. Murfreesboro has A LOT of food options so no need for me to give them a second chance.
