Mary W.,"Jonesboro, GA",26,144,119,3.0,7/3/2016,"Beautiful inside/clean. Lots of TVs for watching different sports events.  I had the Grilled Chicken and broccoli Alfredo. Not the best that I have had, the noodles were too al dente' and the broccoli which was scarce was over cooked. I ordered an iced green tea and it was very weak. The vanilla cream soda was good and the Pizookie Trio finished the meal nicely."
Monica M.,"Nashville, TN",1,16,3,4.0,4/3/2016,"My family and I are regulars at Bjs. We just moved from LA, so we were excited about the Murfreesboro grand opening. This place is so causal, yet delicious. My favorite plate is the California Club Sandwich. It's a hot turkey sandwich with lettuce, tomato, and garlic mayo. The garlic mayo I believe it what makes the sandwich extremely delicious. I always order a strawberry lemonade that tastes fresh.  For dessert, I recommend you should try a pizookie. It is a hot cookie with ice cream on top. It's the perfect mix of hot and cold. With some ice cream and cookie, it'll melt perfectly in your mouth.  The service is always pretty good, however we have had some interesting experiences here. The waiter once added a chair to the table and the servers kept passing by and hitting my dad who sat on that chair. However most of the staff are friendly and they always bring your food out correctly."
Doug B.,"Riceville, TN",5,75,,5.0,6/19/2016,"An update to my previous negative review.  Stopped by with my daughter after our Bonnaroo weekend for appetizer and drinks. All good! I also had an asparagus and portabello mushroom salad that was excellent. Just the right amount of a very good vinaigrette dressing.  Based on this good experience, I came back with my wife this afternoon. A very nice lady behind the bar, Kelsey, made some good recommendations on IPAs. She was knowledgeable and seemed genuinely interested in making sure we enjoyed our visit. The entrees were prepared wth more care than my previous visit, everything was good. Amazing how good service can change your perception of a place. Well done, Kelsey! Only nitpick ... fix your wifi! It nearly kept me from posting this positive review out of frustration."
Laura H.,"Christiana, TN",112,211,42,4.0,8/31/2015,"With brick walls, exposed ducts and garage-style windows as room dividers, BJs appears to be in an old industrial building, although it is brand new. My eyes were immediately drawn to the bar - a backlit wall of colorful bottles offset by three large, clear tv screens. The effect was very visually appealing. Although we arrived just after 5:15 pm on a Friday, the dining area was pretty full, so we were seated in a booth in the bar area. That area was pretty empty but within about 15 minutes, it too, was full and there was a wait for tables the rest of the time we were there. We had a California Club flatbread as an appetizer. Put avocado on anything, and I'll order it! It contained a lot of fresh ingredients and was plenty big enough for three people to share. For my entree, I ordered Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos accompanied by ""bistro seasonal grains"". This dish is part of their lighter menu and while the portion size was large, the calorie count came to 640. BJs is not your average sports bar offering only fattening burgers and pizzas! Their menu is just shy of being as large as Cheesecake Factory's, and there are a plethora of options that should satisfy just about anyone. The tacos were very good and the pitas they were on tasted homemade. The seasonal grains consisted of brown rice, quinoa, cranberries, cucumber, corn and tomatoes with a little kick to them - likely from garlic. This was a perfect side dish for the tacos, and I left there feeling full but refreshed."
Ian G.,"Knoxville, TN",7,138,1,3.0,9/3/2015,"Ate here for a weekend lunch with wife and son. Beautiful rustic factory brewery sports bar/restaurant atmosphere.  Wife and I each ordered a bowl of soup and shared a small 16$ pizza. We waited too long for our food and when it finally arrived it really wasn't hot. Soup was way too thick, like gravy. Tasted OK nothing special. On to the pizza. Best way to describe the pizza would be to say similar to pizza Hut, taste, quality, texture, etc. It was OK.  A little too pricey for just OK.  It never ceases to amaze me that investors can find a million++ dollars or so to build a beautiful restaurant but don't seem to have enough in the budget to properly train the staff before they open the restaurant. First impression is the strongest. Would we try this restaurant in another month+ when they get their act together? Not sure?"
Bob D.,"Hampton Bays, NY",3,82,16,2.0,4/30/2016,"If not for the beer, I'd have no use for this establishment.  Third time I've been here and this will be the last: First time was an ok experience. The chicken pita tacos were fantastic. What killed it was the bartender/ manager who wouldn't let me sample a beer prior to purchasing it. I travel all around this country and NEVER have been turned down for a sample of craft beer. He did however offer me a porter in which he poured half way by accident. To be frank, that's why they got 2 stars.  Second time was better until the food came. The bartender was down to earth and let us know not to order things we mentioned. I ordered the hickory brisket and bacon burger. To start it was over cooked, and they even asked how I wanted it prepared. Secondly, the meat was a patty which I'm sure was previously frozen. Didn't even taste the brisket due to the copious amounts of delicious BBQ sauce, (in which was the best part).  As my side, I elected roasted brussel sprouts. And I got precisely what I ordered. They were crunchy, burnt and dry.  Third and final experience I ordered the boneless buffalo wings. The picture depicted chunks of chicken, not wanna be mc nuggets which I wish they were. These were the last of the bag, got all the frozen breading, some burnt French fries, and some other item I can't explain. The sauce was so overpowering, I couldn't tell if I was eating chicken or lutefisk.   I never return food in a restaurant, I just don't go back.... The stance this place has is not consistent with the price and the quality in which they are offering in my opinion. Freezers are for ice cream and ice........."
Kassi W.,"Hendersonville, TN",35,43,11,5.0,6/25/2016,This place is awesome. Simply said.  Its crowded most of the time hard to find a seat. But it is so yummy. The service is even better.
Diana S.,"Nashville, TN",17,161,697,5.0,8/8/2015,For it being a new open restaurant. We got seated within 10mins for 2 people. They had alot of drinks options. Menu was decent they had a lot of options to choose from.  I thought their drinks was a bit pricy. Paid $10 for my mojito that wasnt strong enough. Server got our food order in and out fast. Overall i had a good experience. Its just another restaurant to try and wouldnt go back unless there was no waiting to be seated.
Mary Beth B.,"Murfreesboro, TN",68,7,9,5.0,12/6/2016,"I've been here many times and have always had a great experience! Yes, there are lots of TVs but it's not that distracting. It's like a nice sports bar. The food and drinks are excellent. Staff is always so nice. Love this place!"
Michelle F.,"Murfreesboro, TN",32,4,,5.0,1/21/2017,"The first time I went to BJ's, I was extremely disappointed. I went to the one in Murfreesboro and sat down at the bar. Our bartender was amazing and very personable. I ordered a hamburger with salsa of some kind and it had a fried egg on it. It was possibly the most amazing thing I've ever put in my mouth. The cook--his name was Ryan. When we go back, I will definitely be asking for him to cook my burger! He changed my opinion with a quickness."
Tad R.,"Murfreesboro, TN",108,5,,1.0,11/22/2016,"Service was terrible, food was just warm.. Manager was rude terrible experience so disappointed.."
Mindy J.,"Smyrna, TN",18,90,67,4.0,3/2/2016,"Get ""to go"" from here sometimes, always good, so i wanted to try eating there, inside. Went for my birthday dinner Saturday with about 6 other ladies, and it was on point. Service was awesome, our server, can't remember her name, wish i had, she was great. From the hard cidar, margaritas, and sangrias to the food. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their meals. Only downfall (which i didn't even mind) I got the Sriracha Bacon Mac N Cheese with Chicken- Didn't come out with everyone else's entrees. Apparently someone else had taken it?  But they were very quick in correcting this, even the manager noticed right away, very attentive staff... So it came out relatively fast,  BUT- While it was seriously some DELICIOUS mac n cheese- I couldnt find any of the sriracha flavor anywhere, not spicy at all... and NO BACON?!?!?!?!??? There was broccoli in it instead? That was pretty disappointing, cause i ordered it based off the Bacon and Sriracha in the title... But i like broccoli, and the chicken was good (found a few gristle/ fatty pieces, but just set them to the side, no biggie. I'm not too picky) Also- the little garlic knot thingy that comes with it was Perfection, as was the Tomato Mozz salad i ordered with it. All in all- still love this place. But dammit! Gimme my Bacon!"
Michael H.,"Murfreesboro, TN",0,22,,2.0,8/28/2016,"Two stars because while the food is not bad, the service is so slow that I can't in good conscience give it any more. They either need more wait staff or the ones they have need to pick it up. We were there 40 minutes before our food was served. Glasses went empty for long stretches. No excuse."
Kaitlyn M.,"Spring Hill, FL",52,3,,5.0,10/27/2016,Awesome service ! Didn't like my cocktail at first but then the bartender added some stuff to fit my tastes better and it was delicious!! Really went the extra mile!
Allison G.,"Murfreesboro, TN",163,7,6,5.0,12/6/2016,The BEST margaritas I have EVER had!! Also the Mediterranean tacos (I think that's what they are called) are mouth watering AMAZING!!!
Regena G.,"Murfreesboro, TN",0,6,,4.0,12/2/2016,It was out 1st trip to BJ's.  For the price it was good food.  We got the artichoke bites appetizer which was pretty good. The clam chowder which was great!  The  sriracha brussel sprouts were outstanding but the parmesan chicken was out of this world great!    Zack our server was great. And overall the experience was really good.
Joseph B.,"Murfreesboro, TN",0,7,,1.0,11/26/2016,"Hate that this place sucks. The atmosphere is the perfect sports bar but the service and management is piss poor. After our food was late they dropped our pizza on the way to the table. Nothing was comped or offered but more of our time as we had to wait for another pizza to be baked. Once we got the ""deep dish"" it was very sub par. The beer selection was good but that's all they have along with the nice atmosphere."
Patrick B.,"Antioch, TN",0,13,,4.0,10/5/2016,"Very good brewery! Clean, nice bar with great service and atmosphere. Great staff and good food, but a little expensive. Try their sprouts app"
Mike H.,"Murfreesboro, TN",0,2,,1.0,5/27/2017,If there are 2 to 4 people in your party don't bother going here. They only reserve large parties and walking are force to wait. I tried to make reservations a head a time but was told to call 30mins before so I did and they send it would be an hour wait for my party size and they may be about to sit me at the bar early. I advise I didn't want to sit at the bar and asked about the table for 2 they had but was immediately shut down stating they are moving over to another table for a large part that has not shown up yet. Will never eat here again worst customer service.  Was able to call another restaurant and they were happy to accommodate us.
Paige E.,"Murfreesboro, TN",76,8,1,5.0,5/12/2016,"If you can't find something to eat here you are too picky and should stay home!  if you do not care for root beer, you have to try their homemade version. You will become a convert! The flavor is quite subtle and very creamy.  With a wide selection of adult beverages and the extensive menu, you are sure to please even the pickiest eaters!"
