Ramona C.,"Nashville, TN",8,1,2,4.0,3/19/2016,Great service and atmosphere....Lots of food to choose from and it's so delicious! Me and my husband will definitely return!
Taylor N.,"Irvine, CA",32,7,2,4.0,11/5/2016,"Service was fantastic & loved the environment. Went there to drink beers & have appetizers. The avocado spring rolls were amazing! And they have a good happy hour during the week 3-6. Will for sure be back, highly recommend."
Christy M.,"Murfreesboro, TN",64,51,99,1.0,1/9/2016,"I'm going to go ahead and write a review before I even get my food because I have been here an hour. We were sat as soon as we got here. It's 2:16 now so it was around 1 when we got here. It took 10 minutes for the server to greet us and get our drinks. I asked for Dr Pepper and she brought me water. She did get the rest of my parties drinks correct. 4 people btw. It took another 15 minutes for her to get to us to ask us our order. For anyone keeping track that's 25 minutes at our seats before our order was even taken. We have now been here an hour and no food. I order ravioli, kids ordered pizza and husband ordered a burger."
James B.,"Murfreesboro, TN",0,8,11,5.0,3/4/2016,"My first time here. They have a massive selection of beer, but I had a cheeseburger and clam chowder. Both were very good, but a great rating isn't as much about food as it is service and ambiance.  Christa was my waitress and she is so awesome. Very helpful, willing to talk, such a nice lady.  The decor is industrial but they did a great job on little details in styling.  If you like local beers this is probably great but for me I think my kids will love the desserts here."
J B.,"Atlanta, GA",3,37,11,2.0,11/3/2015,"Although I really wanted to give this place 5 stars, I was so displeased with the service that I debated on giving it just one star.  Living in Atlanta now but a native of Murfreesboro, I was excited when I came home to visit and my friend wanted to take me to a new restaurant in the Boro for my birthday.   The restaurant is set up nicely and very ""big city"" appeal.  The food was delicious and so were the drinks.  We arrived 2 hours before closing and there were only three other tables besides us.  I'm not sure if it was the servers first night or if it was just a bad night for him but it took him about 15 minutes before he even approached us.  Then the food arrived cold like it had been sitting to be taken to a table for awhile.  He checked on us once and another time after bringing the check.  In a world where customer service is everything and I know this from being a server in college, everything can suck but if the server is friendly and outgoing, they can turn it all around.  It was so bad that the bill was $90 and it hurt my friend to tip him only $5 with a note that said, ""I wanted to leave a huge tip, because I am a restaurant owner, but your service was less than satisfactory.""  Maybe I caught this place on a bad night, but it was upsetting because you only turn 30 once.  The first impression is the lasting impression.  You only get one chance to make a positive first impression.  I will not be back to this establishment and that's a sad thing because the food was quite enjoyable."
Carissa C.,"Smyrna, TN",129,4,,2.0,10/5/2015,"The cocktails were yummy I highly recommend the very berry margarita, even though it was supposed to come in a tall glass but it was served in short glasses... The appetizers are just okay... My steak was impossibly dry and over cooked.  The wait staff was highly unorganized (running around shouting ""Who ordered this or that?!"") Prices are way too high considering.  I won't be back."
Sierra B.,"Murfreesboro, TN",195,50,524,5.0,1/1/2016,"The service is great for the most part. Imma regular here... all the food is unique, well presented, fresh and there are plenty of healthy options and portion sizes for every appetite."
Hanh N.,"Santa Ana, CA",4,26,24,1.0,7/2/2016,Disgusting disgusting disgusting! Avocado egg rolls and calamari has always been my favorite appetizers at this restaurant but the cooks definitely SUCKS. I'm from Cali and here visiting my boyfriend's family. I wanted to show them the best avocado rolls and calamari but damn was it disgusting and a disappointment. Everything else that they ordered were also awful. What a disgrace to the BJ's food chain. Better to shut down this location then to serve nasty food.
Brian C.,"Nashville, TN",0,5,,2.0,9/24/2016,"The pizookie desert is amazing. However, I have been twice and each time the entrees were way overcooked."
Scott D.,"Nashville, TN",21,15,,4.0,9/19/2015,"Large large menu almost to big, I had the ravioli, served in a cast iron skillet, it was good, very filling. Girlfriend got the brisket burger she said it was tasty. It all started off with the honey sirancha Brussel sprouts we thought were over done BUT tasty. Service was great menu is large enough to keep you coming back. Beer was very good, i tried their ""flight"" of beer, which I could only choose 4/5 (darn) the fight comes in larger Pilsner glasses not shot glasses which is why you only choose 4-5. All of the seasonal beers I tried were great but the porter was surprisingly smooth great taste, very nice finish. We will be going back."
Dana A.,"Murfreesboro, TN",0,1,,4.0,3/15/2017,Great place to eat. Huge menu makes it hard to choose. Dessert pizzas are fantastic. We tried 3 different ones and all were great. Went on a Tuesday night and there was no wait. They bring the kids a complimentary garlic knot and small bowl of fruit while you wait on your food. This will become a regular place for us for sure. They also  have a specials menu for each week night in their website.
James Y.,"Murfreesboro, TN",2,9,,5.0,7/24/2016,"We like this place. Has a nice atmosphere, good beer menu, and the food is good. What I like most is they offer some healthier options on the menu so you don't have to just choose from deep fried garbage. The location is great... Just off the interstate and near shopping and theatre."
Camellia T.,"Murfreesboro, TN",30,22,17,4.0,12/5/2015,First time going tonight and I really enjoyed myself. The wait was about an hour so we went and shopped around in The Avenue while we waited. They texted us and let us know when our booth was ready. A very large menu to choose from....sooo many choices. I got the Shrimp Asparagus Penne Pasta and loved it! My fiancé got the Jambalaya and it was very spicy but good. I love the atmosphere. They have by far the BEST Strawberry lemonade ever!!! Tons of choices of beer to choose from so if you're a beer drinker...which my fiancé is....this is the place for you. Very busy tonight. Waiter took a little long to come back and forth to our table but overall it was a pleasant experience. Our tab came to about $60 with my family of 4(with beer ordered). We will be returning. This place is in my top fav places to eat. I didn't give it a 5 because of the long wait and the waiter taking longer.
Ashley T.,"Vidor, TX",5,38,23,5.0,9/6/2016,Hand crafted root beer floats. Cant beat that. There is usually a wait when we go but so worth it. Everything that they have in their menu is very well priced. Staff is friendly. Plus our daughter loves there signature root beer.
Brandon M.,"Murfreesboro, TN",46,3,1,5.0,9/5/2015,"Best restaurant in Murfreesboro, hands down. Beat deep dish pizza I've ever had. Awesome microbrewed root boot. Highly recommend."
Tn S.,"Murfreesboro, TN",1,28,22,2.0,5/7/2016,"Third time here every time I come here there's a problem server had his head up his you-know-what got here at 450 leaving at 6:28 and only had appetizers and a beer everyone that came in after us got served, server said he had a long day which tells me he forgot to put the order in. So immediately we were offered free dessert, not something to make it right but we accept and asked for it to go, guess what he forgot that too, needless to say we will not be back. Food and Beer good but service was terrible and was not even busy."
Tom G.,"Knoxville, TN",46,7,,5.0,8/31/2016,"I was in Murfreesboro on business but was dining alone on this occasion.  I sat at the bar where Kelsey and Michael waited on me.  They both did a great job.  They have a pretty good happy hour, dollar off drafts, they have a great beer selection, not just their own. I did drink their beers because I like to try beers I've never had and was impressed with their selection and the beers I tried.  I had their spinach stuffed mushroom app and their Seared Ahi Tuna Salad as my entree and both were very good.  The mushrooms were good sized.  The tuna was seared nicely and not over cooked. I'll be back...."
Jake A.,"Antioch, TN",149,95,14,4.0,5/24/2016,"I really like this place for good beer, solid pizza, and a fun atmosphere. Met my buddy and I had the honey sriracha Brussels sprouts that were awesome for an app, we split a large BJs favorite pizza that was good but I prefer buffalo chicken. Of course I had to have some beer and I highly recommend he Jeremiah Red. I'll be back to try the BJs enlightened menu for some healthier choices next time."
Jeff D.,"Pearland, TX",0,12,,4.0,12/30/2016,The team was great here! The manager split our party of 9 into back to back booths (the kids were hungry) and the adults enjoyed sitting by ourselves. The server was attentive and took pride in his work. My wife loves the balsamic chicken (no longer on the menu) and the kitchen made it for her anyway (was the server's doing to ask). All around great experience. We come here all the time. I dig their beer selection also.
Stacey S.,"Murfreesboro, TN",31,9,,3.0,2/20/2017,"Service was great, but the food was so so.  I ordered the shrimp & asparagus penne.  There was just no favor.  My husband said his steak was so so."
