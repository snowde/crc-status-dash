Lolita M.,"Manhattan, NY",278,117,641,4.0,10/31/2017,"I really like this place. It's great to watch the game whether you're seated at a table or at the bar and it's got outside seating. The food is delicious and the servers are very gracious and professional. The portions entree portions generous and I really enjoyed the wings. The menu is extensive and can be a bit overwhelming but once you order, everything is promptly delivered. Definitely great for parties, family dinner night, catching up or catching a game. Highly recommended."
Scott W.,"Nanuet, NY",140,2,2,1.0,1/7/2018,"I apologize in advance for the length of this.... And yes, I did try to remedy on site first... Had a horrible experience with curbside to at BJ's Brewhouse here in Nanuet.  Arrived and paid the bill at 6:15, the expected arrival time for the food per the ordering app. Food arrived at 6:40.   No explanation for the lateness...and...this was the bowl of chili (First pic).  Really???? It gets much worse...  I called the restaurant (Nanuet NY) to speak with the manager. After being on hold for 6 minutes, the call was disconnected..... then.... I went to the restaurant and asked for the manager.  He eventually came out.  I asked for him to sit on one of the benches in the waiting area and he REFUSED!!!!!! I try to explain my situation and he has an excuse for every part of it.  About the long wait for my order he claimed it was Sunday. About the chili only being half full he said that is the amount that you get in the restaurant (I will see about this tomorrow when I go and order a bowl of chili and pour it into my container).  He also made the claim that there were, wait for it, 700 people in the restaurant.  Funny, this is what the fire Marshall says in the picture below. I am a very loyal customer and should not have to be subjected to this kind of ridiculousness."
Liz L.,"West Nyack, NY",137,19,2,5.0,9/18/2017,"One of my absolute favorite restaurants! Wide variety selection on the menu, good prices & amazing food!  Make sure to ask for Kevin when coming here !!!!! Being our server, he was very attentive, polite & detailed to our needs. He has now become the bartender & is just as good! If not better. He makes our experience worthwhile!"
Jasmine E.,"Meriden, CT",57,2,,1.0,1/7/2018,"I placed an order online and was given a pickup time of 6:15pm. When I got there, I paid and was told to wait a ""couple"" of minutes. Well those couple of minutes turned into 45minutes. When I spoke to the manager, he said it's busy and shrugged his shoulders. I asked for some type of compensation and his response was ""well I can't compensate everyone"". Instead of finding a solution he decided to blame the circumstances, and couldn't even be bothered to apologize. He took no ownership or responsibility for the poor service. I've been in dozens of busy restaurants and never had any staff (certainly not management) be so dismissive of a guest. I work nearby and used to frequent often, but I will be eating elsewhere from now on."
Claudia B.,"Manhattan, NY",507,88,120,5.0,8/8/2017,"2nd time eating food from BJ's, 1st time eating at the restaurant in Nanuet.  Very good experience and the food is consistently delicious.  It's a blend of uniqueness, healthy, and variety.   Love love the seared tuna salad, soup salad combo (tomato /mozzarella salad is delicious), Alfredo is fresh and tasty, avocado egg rolls and chicken pot stickers. The sample tasters is a refreshing option for you if you want to sample the menu.   The chicken Mediterranean tacos are so tasty."
Marcin G.,"Queens, NY",35,87,305,5.0,8/16/2017,"First time at BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse and what a great experience it was! The restaurant is really nicely designed, with cool chandeliers and wall art all over the place. The seating is spaced out so you're not sitting next to someone and it can be pretty intimate for your date, family night or corporate lunch.  The service was phenomenal. Jennie was our server and she was so awesome. Explained all the menu items to us, went over the daily specials and recommended some drinks. Checked in on us several times to make sure we were good.  The food - simply amazing. I had the Gourmet Five Meat pie and it was so very good. It was a decent deep dish pizza, that was so well seasoned and cooked to perfection. An overall amazing experience, can't wait to come back soon!"
Andrew L.,"Fort Lee, NJ",42,107,134,3.0,2/1/2017,"Came on a moderately quiet weeknight where the wait wasn't very long for two. Yet the service was inexplicably slow. We wanted to give this slightly more established location a chance after having a pretty average experience at the new Teterboro, NJ opening. The experience was different but the end result was similar. Refills were hard to come by, let alone attention from the server. Food wasn't hot but would've been delicious if it was. I can definitely sense the potential of the place and think it can really hit that 4 star mark if they stepped up their service a bit. It took so long to get in & out. But the best part of the night was the pizookie. The pizookie I had at the other BJ's was no good and the server chalked it up to it somehow being my fault. But this one was much better and now I definitely want to order another! I got the cookies & cream variant and the cookie was delicious. There was a perfect ratio of cookie to ice cream this time too! Could've done without the mousse on top. But this dessert truly was the restaurant's saving grace!"
Karina C.,"Yonkers, NY",3,53,20,2.0,12/20/2017,"Went with a group of friends around 9 PM on December 18. The hostess stated that only the high top tables were available when there was about only 6 parties. We asked for a booth or a table and she walked away very annoyed. She then came back to seat us down at the low tables for our party of 4. The entree's were mediocre, kind of tasted microwaved which was odd. Our server was very nice; however, majority of the servers reeked of marijuana. I don't mind the use of it, you do you; however the restuarant smelling like marijuana while eating your food isn't that appetizing. Two stars for the pizookie, other than that.... It's a negative."
Nicole M.,"Mahwah, NJ",204,35,8,4.0,12/22/2017,Good food. Love the desserts! Wait staff always friendly. Busy place but wait is only ten mins at best. Lots of beers to chose from.
Anne A.,"Pomona, NY",0,11,4,3.0,9/22/2017,"This is my first time going here. I went with my mother and my sister for the lunch special 11-3. I ordered the Meat Lovers Piadina with sweet potato fries. The food presentation was very nice and arrived hot. For dessert, we ordered the Churro Pizookie. We devoured it and was so yummy. Would definitely go again"
Dasle K.,"New York, NY",558,251,1394,5.0,9/7/2016,"This place is the best. As good as happy hour can get! From Mon - Fri 3-7pm, they have $2 off appetizers, $1 off wine by the glass, beer, and cocktails and 1/2 mini deep dish pizzas.  Plus, if you download the app, you get a free mini pizookie too. DO IT. You can earn rewards towards future visits, and I promise there will be lots of those.  Having visited BJ's in San Francisco, I had high expectations for this place and was worried that it wouldn't be as good as its CA location. I was pleasantly surprised that the NY location was just as good - if not better!  The restaurant is HUGE and the menu is pages and pages of yummy goodness. Loads of beers on tap, and the homemade cherry soda was amazing!!!  We started with the Sriracha Dry Rub Wings and Sriracha Brussel Sprouts. OMG both were SOOOOO good. Definitely my favorites, and they didn't overkill the flavor. We got the mini deep dish Spicy Hawaiian pizza (1/2 off!) but this was just OK.  The White Chocolate Macademia Nut Pizookie was TO DIE FOR. What a way to end a meal. The ice cream is just normal vanilla ice cream, but that cookie melted in a pan will warm your heart & make your taste buds go crazy. Overall, absolutely loved our visit to BJ's. Can't wait to be back to try everything else on the menu!!!"
Jason P.,"Bronx, NY",182,400,3264,2.0,7/8/2017,"I rarely write reviews under 3 stars unless I feel a strong need to advise others of the sub-par experience. I went to this BJs and had a great experience a few years back. I returned again last night and it was far from great. We called ahead the day before for a party of 7. We arrived about 15 minutes prior to our reservation (call ahead) time and were told that the reservation had not been ________ and that we would have to wait. This was not bad, as we got a table in about 15 minutes or so, which is great in my opinion for a party of 7 on a Friday night. Though I think because they had _____ our reservation (call ahead) they gave us priority which was nice. Our server was great at first quickly getting us our drinks and taking our orders....then...it started. The server took our order of 1 child's pizza, 3 burgers, 1 chicken sandwich, a ziti bowl and jamabalaya dish at 8:45 PM. So we waited...and about 9:10ish we were told by our server that it was ""coming up in a minute"". At 9:35 we were told that it will be ""out in 30 seconds""....we got our food at 9:45!! An hour wait for mostly sandwiches and pasta dishes?!!?! while what seemed to be the entire restaurant who came in well after us had eaten and left. Now the wait is annoying in itself but as a business there are ways to go about addressing it. An honest server is one who can tell the customers of the delay and the ACTUAL estimated food arrival time. A manager is another as any good manager would have come over to us and explained the delay and offered some sort of appetizer ""on the house"". The food itself was good, when it finally arrived, but at the point everyone at the table was a bit moody at the situation. Everyone ate about half their food and was ready to go. It still took some time to get the bill, pay it and some bags for our food containers would have been nice we never had the change to ask as our server disappeared after leaving the bill. Just an overall bad experience at a place that I like and wanted to continue to like. Their food is good, it just doesn't compensate for that kind of service."
Blain B.,"Suffern, NY",148,25,19,4.0,7/30/2017,"What saves this place from a 3 star rating is it's amazing outdoor bar! It's so comfortable and the parking is great. Food is average. It's a chain! But, the amazing staff, beer selection, ample parking and atmosphere are above average. Try the brew house blonde! It's refreshing for summer! Their beer rocks, and the food will hold you over. It's a great spot in the shops at nanuet."
Keturah E.,"Richmond, VA",14,82,137,5.0,7/28/2016,"We visited on a Thursday night and despite being quite busy there was still not a wait time. The menu is quite extensive and allowed for many options to choose from.  We started with the Calamari and ordered drinks. Both were a good choices. The Calamari was seasoned well and looked just like SQUID. Tentacles and all. My coworker said her drink tasted just like juice, I thought it was a good combination of ingredients.  I ordered the Classic California personal sized pizza and it was very tasty, but I would have added more cheese and sauce. Even though the dough was a perfect  texture, there was not a great balance of toppings and dough. My coworker ordered the Deep Dish Ravioli. She shared that it was ""quite delicious"" and had a good balance of cheese, pasta, and sauce.  The beignet with strawberries, ice cream, and whipped cream was ok and I probably wouldn't order it again. I did not like the texture or flavor of the dough. I tried my coworker's Chocolate Chunk Pizooki and it was DELICIOUS! I removed the beignet and added some of her Pizooki and that was a fabulous mix of flavors!  Overall I would come back here and would be brave and try some different dishes."
Nora A.,"Portland, ME",70,156,486,3.0,1/5/2017,"I have ordered and picked up food from here many times but never dined in. We had the jambalaya but it very salty, I had to add extra rice to compensate. The best thing is chicken tenders and fries. Even the sale was salty."
DJ S.,"New Hyde Park, NY",133,67,7,4.0,11/13/2017,Cool chain bar. The beer selection is expansive and they recommend what beers pair with what foods in the menu. The place is very large and the service is very quick. Food was flavorful but didn't have anything unique. Safe spot if you need a place to go with solid options.
Johnny G.,"Hoboken, NJ",144,133,40,4.0,6/13/2017,"Great hangout spot for games, hangouts, get togethers! Great IPA menu. I highly recommend brisket and bacon burger and it was awesome."
Ellen T.,"Edgewater, NJ",1,7,,5.0,10/6/2017,Great food and beer selection!  Had the Mediterranean tacos and cherry chipotle boneless wings.  Both had great flavor profiles and are recommended. No hesitation to come back!
Kerry M.,"Oakland, NJ",0,4,,2.0,10/1/2017,"Food is good, atmosphere good, but service is SLOW!!  Waited to order, waited to get food (more than 1/2hr)  for a burger and salad!  Server said they sent some people home, and then to top it off.  Waited ANOTHER 1/2hr for coffee and ice cream for kids!  Ridiculous!  Will not be coming back"
Burke B.,"Saddle River, NJ",66,16,1,5.0,9/4/2017,"After catching a movie, my husband and I were famished. We had wanted to try this restaurant, but did not always come to the Shops at Nanuet with an appetite. After a short wait, we were seated and greeted by a pleasant and attentive server. The menu is full of many yummy options, including the calorie count. I ordered the Peruvian quinoa bowl with a side salad and my husband got the Mediterranean chicken pita tacos. Both were fantastic choices. In fact, I left with enough for a second meal.  For dessert my husband tried the pizookie, and once again we were not disappointed. When we were ready to pay, my husband used the app. A great idea!! We look forward to returning in the near future."
Heather B.,"Tuxedo Park, NY",172,160,45,5.0,10/12/2016,"This place is awesome. Went here for the first time about a year ago and have gone many times since. It's slightly overpriced for what it is, but the atmosphere is nice and the food tastes good. I love trying all the beers they make themselves and they are super nice about letting you try a taste before ordering. My favorite is the seasonal pumpkin beer! Whenever my boyfriend and I come we have to get the mozzarella sticks. You get so many and they are some of the best you can get. The avocado rolls are also a good app to get. For my meal, I typically get a mini vegetable deep dish pizza. It's surprisingly very filling and I always have leftovers for lunch the next day. Over the summer they had this watermelon feta salad which was also on point. Also worth mentioning: the service is always wonderful. I don't typically like chain places, but I love this place and cannot recommend enough!"
Stephanie M.,"Saddle Brook, NJ",264,24,5,4.0,5/6/2017,"BJ's brew house is . This location in Nanuet I have now been to three times, and have had a great experience all three times.  First time I sat at the bar and had dinner and drinks with my boyfriend. The food was amazing. The beer was good. If you like craft beer check this place out ASAP. The bartender, Jim, was so personable and friendly, but still gave us our privacy to have dinner. Allowed us to experience trying some of the beer before going with something new. I always appreciate a bar-tender that is looking to bring a better experience to guests. The ambiance of this place is upscale rustic. There is outdoor seating too! Heaters, and is open concept indoor outdoor bar in a little part of the patio which is a real cool touch. There are TV's indoor and outdoor, it is a mini brewery after all! Price is moderate with a wide variety of choices on the menu from $5 items to $25 items. Drinks are fairly priced too. I am not a huge fan of chain establishments but BJ's Brew House is not quite a chain and definitely still obtains an authentic feel. The only reason BJ's Brew House earns 4 stars is clear! Great place. It falls short of the 5th start for only two small reasons; so good that you're always busy and there's always a wait, and because the vegan offerings are limited on the menu. I had the Cauliflower tacos and they were DELICIOUS. However, it was one of only about 5 options on the entire menu of 40 plus items. My suggestion to management is to definitely expand on that, or in the menu clearly state for it to be easy option separate meat from vegetarian. The price difference is why offering an actual vegan option is probably easier for everyone. Download the App if you want to get on the line before actually arriving. You shouldn't last minute decide to go here at dinner time if you do not want to wait on a line! However, good things are worth the wait! I checked out BJ's BrewHouse in Teterboro, I will be writing a review on that location next!"
Jay C.,"Valley Cottage, NY",0,7,1,2.0,4/1/2017,"Poor service. Wait for no reason.  There we're a lot of empty seats, open tables,  but unbussed, no one service seemed to very motivated to service.  A lot of uncleared tables.  Food is pretty good. I personally don't like think it's worth the long wait.  Be prepared to wait for no reason."
Rob D.,"Wayne, NJ",1553,298,779,5.0,8/20/2016,Been here a bunch of times. My review is for the bar. Lu is a fantastic bartender. All of them are but he makes this place tick. They have a great selection of tap beers if thats your thing. They sell their own brews and you can get it bottled in all sorts of sizes to go. My friends say the food is good as well. Definitely worth a try if your in the area.
John V.,"Hatfield, PA",32,32,1,4.0,4/16/2017,"Food was pretty good for a chain. We did call ahead reservations which cut the time before airing considerably. While we were waiting people came out and offered complimentary appetizers which was a nice touch.  The menu kind of reminded me of a Cheesecake Factory, lots of options. We started out with the avocado egg rolls.  They tasted okay, but not as good as the Cheesecake Factory. I had the Burger which was tasty. Others had the fish tacos and deep dish pizza. All tasted good.  Decent selection of unique beers. I had the Omnegong Hennepin.  If you're looking for a decent chain restaurant, this is a good spot."
Marie U.,"Monsey, NY",0,10,5,3.0,8/31/2017,"It's a cool place, they make an OK pizza, but for some reason we haven't felt too welcome there. A few times we had to wait for the host for over 5 mins! Even though other waiters passing by have seen us. But no one said a word to us.  I don't want to give this place a totally bad review, but I personally do not feel excited when someone suggests me going there, so I usually suggest some other places I enjoy and feel special at."
Grace R.,"Mahwah, NJ",0,17,15,1.0,8/5/2017,I can't review the food since I never got the opportunity to eat. My husband and I went here to have a nice dinner since we had never eaten there before. The young gentleman who seated us was friendly. We waited 15 minutes and not a single wait staff approached our table. I got up to ask the host if there would be someone coming to take ANY order from us. I was met with a simple nod of yes. No words exchanged. Proceeded to wait another five minutes more....nobody came. We walked out. Even the couple that sat in our section next to us turned to complain that no one had taken their order. Very disappointed...will not return.
Lisa L.,"Uxbridge, MA",197,3,2,4.0,4/14/2017,"Pretty good food and okay service. There are a lot of different kinds of beer on tap, which were tasty. The atmosphere was social and clean. We had the avocado burger and supreme deep dish pizza and they were okay with taste. Service could be slow because they are busy, but they were friendly. The alcohol was the best part. There was a lot of selection and both beverages we tried were good. We had the Lindemans Framboise (tart fruity beer)  and Taronka Stout (smooth darker beer). We would go back and try the Happy Hour!"
Gabriella P.,"Blauvelt, NY",0,2,,5.0,8/21/2017,"I've been here a few times with my friends. I had the chicken club sandwich which is incredible and the cookies and cream cookie, which was also amazing. One time a waiter was rude to me about what I was ordering and I saw him push a toddler in the aisle. Other than this man, this place is 5/5 would recommend."
Larry S.,"Nanuet, NY",0,2,,5.0,12/7/2017,"We started take out in the area and found the food at B J's was better than the rest. The service was lacking and mistakes in our orders were common until Brandon took charge.  He took responsibility and said all the right things. We now try to only to take out when he is there. He is hard working, pleasant, polite, very knowledgeable and caring. He is definitely management material. We will keep going there as long as he is there!"
Gianluca T.,"Norwalk, CT",12,7,3,1.0,8/19/2017,Not a fan. My friends had an incident there a few days ago and they comped our entire meal because of it. Hair & plastic in the chix sala
Michael L.,"Waldwick, NJ",48,358,136,4.0,1/10/2017,"4 stars, ""I'm a fan.""   Think AppleBees meets Disney Springs and you might get the atmosphere that makes BJ's Brew House the family friendly sports bar and grille so inviting to patron. I'm no fan of their pizzas, which is supposively one of their signature highlights.  I focus more on the other aspect, the craft beers.  Both their house brews and craft beers they carry give you draft offerings for every occasion.  Want to take a growler of a house brew home?  They can do that.  They cannot accommodate for the other beers they carry, so be sure to drink your fill. Their award winning ribs are juicy and flavorful for a bar grille, please do not compare to a specialty BBQ place, but they are good.  The ribeye is not to disappoint and the sides can be filling.  Skip the spaghettini and meatball.  The pasta alls well be soup noodles, with a Cheyenne Pepper Tomato Sauce.  The burgers are a decent bite, as well as the salmon offerings. Moving on to dessert, I can hardly resist the Pizookie, particularly the white chocolate macadamian nut version.  Oh, so good, but don't calorie count or you may find it doubled your meal placing inches around your gut. The kids will be glad to know of good in-house wifi, as well as internet provider wifi are also in range.  Kid garlic knots and mixed fruit are offered at no charge.  Complimentary crayons and coloring activity page are part of the service.  A family bathroom is also on site.  The kitchen theater window is a hit with the kids should you request a booth at the rear of the restaurant. Wait times can vary, being 25 min to 40 on the weekend peak dinner times to immediate seating on weekdays.  Oh yes, they are open on many holidays including New Year's Day."
Katrina D.,"Lodi, NJ",222,83,68,4.0,1/22/2017,Yknow I don't like other food on the menu. I tried their dessert too. Not good! BUT! Keyword: BUT! The pizza is amazing. Craving pizza? Go here. Get drunk and eat pizza.
Erin G.,"College Park, GA",0,2,1,1.0,8/6/2017,"My husband just picked up a takeout order which included a small spicy Hawaiian chicken pizza for me. When he got home, and I opened my pizza, there was no bacon and no tomatoes on the pizza. NONE. Not one piece of either. I am very disappointed with my pizza. There should be better quality control in the food that is being served from this restaurant. For the price of their pizzas, I expect it to be much better."
Brad V.,"Wyckoff, NJ",73,134,9,3.0,1/23/2017,"An extremely average place. Nothing was really bad but nothing was really good. The wings were probably the best thing we had, The Siracha dry rub was actually quite good. The fish tacos - 2.0 Salad - 3.0 Service - 3.0 Wings - 4.0"
Leila T.,"Nanuet, NY",2,25,52,3.0,10/1/2016,"Disappointing. I was excited to try this place because it seemed similar to the Yard House in Nyack/Yonkers. Let me tell you, it's not even close. Really this place is more like a TGIF or a Chili's. And while it may have a slightly upscale atmosphere, the food just doesn't line up. We got the appetizer combo with chicken wings, spinach dip, mozzarella sticks, and avocado spring rolls. Everything was greasy. Spinach dip was obviously microwaved. Chicken wings were more breading than chicken. The menu is super disorganized and has way too much variety yet not enough depth. Pizzas, sandwiches, pastas, burgers....with only a few choices in each category. We didn't necessarily have a bad time, but we certainly won't be going back. There are better restaurants in the neighborhood where I'd rather spend my money."
Yasir A.,"West Haverstraw, NY",0,1,,2.0,10/6/2017,"First time walking coming to bjs. At the door, on my way in, a group was walking out speaking amongst each other talking about how horrible it was, and they won't be coming back. I still decided to have lunch here, everyone has their own opinions; now when u sat down. A server next to the table was talking to another co worker about how they don't think its worth working there.. This was all before the food even coming out.. Management, some before shift ""battle plan"" might eliminate that.."
Allen S.,"Old Tappan, NJ",2,7,,2.0,8/6/2017,Food was good couldn't enjoy because service staff was so slow we weren't given utensils to eat with till late waitress acted like we were bothering her no intention of going back
Kimiyo M.,"Tomkins Cove, NY",30,22,9,5.0,5/4/2017,"Variety of food (surprisingly quite a bit of seafood), decent price, good service and clean tables.  The desert (ice cream with cookies) was way too sweet but that's my taste.  I'll go back again for more."
Emily M.,"Nanuet, NY",0,3,,5.0,5/24/2017,The family go to. Service is best in town. Perfect location right in the Shops at Nanuet. The Tuscan Tomato Bisque in a bread bowl is to die for!! Their homemade root beer is like no other. I DEFINITELY recommend you check out BJ's!!!
