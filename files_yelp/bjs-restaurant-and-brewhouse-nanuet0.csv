Linda S.,"Morris Plains, NJ",4,7,,1.0,8/31/2015,Horrible service... couldn't even have the opportunity to rate the food. Cute place and vibe but that was about it. Arrive approximately 1:40p and waited 5minutes to be seated... no biggie. Perused the menu and got excited about our choices. Then proceeded to sit at the table with menus closed for 20 minutes. Nobody approached us to ask for drinks. Nobody approached us to ask if were being helped. Any service people that passed us didn't see our attempt to flag them down. Finally at 2:10 we got up and just left hungry. such a disappointment.
Michael B.,"Nashville, TN",0,12,1,5.0,10/27/2015,"Always loved BJS ever since trying it in LA. Great food for a large restaurant. Huge selection of food and drinks. It's a fun, loud place so be prepared."
Talha A.,"College Point, Queens, NY",71,208,271,4.0,7/29/2015,"good appetizers and small plate choices, great to share. pizookie trio was really good, good selection of cookies and ice creams to mix and match."
Lauren R.,"New City, NY",2,16,4,1.0,12/11/2015,One might consider this place a bust...the waiter super nice and said everything on the menu was fantastic...i beg to differ...can definitely tell that this is a chain restaurant by the quality of the food.  The food was quite processed.  The chicken seemed to be more lime pressed particle meat rather than chicken breast. Sent back both of the adult entrées and left hungry.
Dan B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,7,1,2.0,2/16/2015,"BJs obviously needed more time before opening. The wait staff was very obnoxious - interrupting us every 2 minutes with ""how is everything?"" Even when we had nothing in front of us! It was rude and felt like they were trying to rush us out. The shrimp scampi pasta was tasteless, had way too much pasta and just a few burnt shrimp. Have been to other BJs across the country that were very good - Nanuet  just needs to work out the kinks."
Thomas B.,"Congers, NY",32,7,,4.0,12/3/2015,We have eaten there a few times and really liked it. The only problem is if you get take out check your order. We have twice and both times we didnt get what we ordered which is frustrating when you live 8 miles away
Sharon A.,"West Nyack, NY",0,4,,2.0,1/5/2016,"When this place first opened the food was excellent and the Happy Hour was great! Sad to see that it has really gone downhill in a short amount of time. Servers seem bored to be interacting with customers, food quality has gone down while the prices go up."
Aragus T.,"Mount Kisco, NY",0,6,,3.0,12/28/2015,The drinks where good but the food was meh. I did enjoy the atmosphere and the service was cool but its very difficult to get past the fact that the food was not really that good.
Daniel J.,"Bridgewater, NJ",0,87,1,1.0,3/12/2015,"The bottle beer was good. Service was so-so. Ordered the ribeye. Not much flavor and squished thin. The asparagus was so thin and over cooked, you could wrap around a fork like a noodle. Avocado egg rolls are good. Don't get the Poki if you've ever had it in HI. You'll be insulted. Again, the bottle beer was good."
Michelle A.,"Burlington, MA",0,26,24,4.0,9/23/2015,"Got the 2 for $25 deal! Chili made with beer and a delicious bleu cheese salad.  Then the classic deep dish pizza with pepperoni, sausage and mushroom. Very delicious ! A warm chocolate chunk cookie with creamy vanilla ice cream. What a deal and we will return with friends !"
Roger B.,"Briarcliff Manor, NY",1,38,10,3.0,4/30/2015,"I think the food is pretty good.  They also have a really good selection of root beers (fresh made) and good pizza.   I enjoyed it all.  Service is a bit lacking, but otherwise good."
Mike A.,"Nanuet, NY",14,50,,2.0,4/29/2015,"I ate here last night in a party of 7 for a birthday celebration. In short, the service is poor, the food is typical mediocre quality chain restaurant food, the beer is good. I made a reservation the day before. This is the first time I've called a restaurant and got a prompt with several menu items. You can't just call the restaurant and get the hostess. You have to listen to a menu prompt. To reserve a party of 7 or more you have to wait for option #5 or 6. Then after selecting the correct option you get what sounds like the hostess anyway. But only the manager can make a reservation of 7 or more. Already I'm annoyed because there is a phone menu prompt that doesnt even bring you to the correct person. I wait on the phone for 10 minutes for the manager and spend another 10 minutes with him to make the reservation and confirm the details, full name and phone number. I'm told if I'm not there within 15 minutes of the reservation we lose our table. I would say thats common knowledge when making a reservation and thats fine but I've never been lectured before. I havent even gotten to the restaurant yet and I'm already annoyed from spending 20+ minutes on the phone to make a simple reservation. Last night, Tuesday at 7pm, the 7 of us arrive at the restaurant. The hostess and manager can't find my reservation. After spending all that time on the phone the day before they don't have my info in the system. Now I'm annoyed because we have to wait to be seated, maybe 10-15 minutes. Luckily it was a Tuesday and not overly crowded. The hostess who lead us to our table seemed to really not want to be there. She half assed reach for a menu and drops it in front of us. My girlfriend hands it to her and she grabs it and keeps walking. She may of said thanks but it wasnt heard by either of us. She leads us to our table and immediately walks away. She doesn't tell us who our waiter/waitress will be or tell us to enjoy our meal. Just walks away before the rest of the party even gets to the table.  Our waiter, Mike, was great. He asked us if we dined there before. When we said no he explained the beers and food. He gave us recommendations based on the typical beers we drink. BJ's makes 10 beers they have on their menu full time and had 1 seasonal beer there. I had a sampler of 4 which was plenty of beer for 1 person. All the beers were great and the highlight of the meal. The food was ok. Its in line with Chilis and Olive Garden. Just cheap food to fill you up. Nothing to write home about. I had the thin crust pizza. Others had burgers, salmon, pulled pork and other items. No one really liked their meal but no one hated it. One person's meal had an issue and didn't come out with everyone else. That person had to wait 10 minutes for them to cook him a new dish. Not sure what the issue was but our waiter was very apologetic and very helpful throughout the whole meal. After dinner was finished we walked out with the hostess and manager standing in the front. The manager said good night and that was it.  The manager knew we had an issue with the reservation and hopefully would know if a table was missing a dish. For a place that makes their own beer I would have expected a visit from the manager after we seated and offer to buy the birthday person a free beer. Of if they are too cheap to offer a free beer atleast come over and say sorry and check up on us.   Just a random side note. The line cooks wear baseball caps instead of hair nets. I didnt see any hair nets showing under the caps. It just seemed odd and worth pointing out. After reading one reviewer stating they had hair in their food and seeing the baseball caps I spent a minute to comb through my pizza before I ate it.  To compare similar restaurants, Yard House in the Palisades mall is an awesome restaurant. I ate there several months ago for a birthday celebration, and a few times before that. The whole experience was great (service and food were both really good) and the manager gave the birthday girl a free yard of beer.  Customer service really does go a long way. Even with the mediocre food at BJ's if the manager and staff were more professional this would have been a more positive review and they would have had a return customer."
Ari K.,"Rye, NY",0,15,,1.0,8/20/2015,Train wreck....so much wrong.  They need to get their house in order.   MIsheoom appetizer pretty good.  Beet salad good.  Need to work on service
Thomas M.,"Pearl River, NY",1,10,,2.0,3/29/2015,"Funny first two times we were there, service was very good.   This time it was awful .   Waitress actually told us she was taking a 30 min break.  Crazy.  Unless you are shopping at the Shoppes stay away."
Rebecca F.,"Nashville, TN",0,11,,3.0,4/7/2015,"The food is really good here, but the service really needs work. I've been here at least 4 times and each time there was always something off. Food took too long to come out or an appetizer would be forgotten. One time my food (soup and salad) came out first and a good 5-10 minutes went by before my friends' food arrived (they ordered salads, so I don't see why it took longer). The waitstaff has always been friendly but something seems to always get mixed up. I would give this place a better rating but they really need to work on their service and tightening things up."
Mike F.,"Hillsdale, NJ",22,14,2,4.0,6/11/2015,"Amazing pizza, great beer. Good service and excellent atmosphere. Gluten friendly menu with beer to compliment"
Marcia B.,"New City, NY",0,8,,2.0,7/31/2015,"Just went for lunch here. Heard it was good. I ordered the Asian chicken salad. I have never had such a skimpy salad in a restaurant, especially for the price.  There were 8 small bite size pieces of chicken, 4 mandarin oranges, and a huge bowl of lettuce.  I realized after i left that there were no snow peas  or carrots as stated on the menu.  I am giving it 2 stars because we had a very nice waiter. Not going back so soon."
Cheryl W.,"Oakland, NJ",0,6,,2.0,2/13/2015,"My boyfriend & I were in the area so we figured we will give this restaurant a try. It is a very beautiful & new restaurant in the area. The service was good, it took a little long to be served but it was busy. My problem was with the quality of the food. We ordered avocado spring rolls for our appetizer which were nothing special. We also shared a deep dish pizza which was unbelievably greasy. Hoped to like it but sad to say we will not be going back."
Ben D.,"Devon, PA",1,8,,3.0,8/30/2015,"Not a bad place. Had the Mediterranean chicken pita tacos. The the atmosphere is fine, the beer selection is excellent."
Coco M.,"Nanuet, NY",0,5,,1.0,7/14/2015,Went to the Brewhouse in California and it was great.  My husband returned steak which was ordered medium came out well twice. Everyone completed dinner. His steak finally came out and it was completely rare. This was the second time there and service was lousy.
