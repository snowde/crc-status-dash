Christina C.,"New City, NY",0,14,,3.0,1/27/2016,"Visited twice. Bartenders were too busy servicing the younger crowd, that my group was overlooked. Second time, had table service.  Waiter not available when we needed him. Desserts and flatbread pizza were good.  Everything else, OK."
Dr D.,"West Nyack, NY",0,29,,2.0,10/29/2015,"The most mediocre of bar food. Pretty much Applebees standard. Beers are okay though.   Jambalaya was terribly average and probably not worth the calories. Same deal with the shrimp tacos.   Come here for a good time and some bang average bar food, but not for a quality meal."
Elaine K.,"West Nyack, NY",17,98,400,3.0,9/18/2015,"Yes only 3 stars. Been here a few times both lunch/dinners. My husband & I have had a nice time, but each time we came, they've delivered our appy with entrees! Our last dinner here we had lemon pepper wings that was good, but my entree a deep dish ravioli was salty & lukewarm, only ate 1/4 of it; my hubby had tortilla soup bowl, that was salty too. It was good but he couldn't finish. BJ's please keep our entrees on hot plate until we're ready for it. Or bring out the appy first followed by entrees 5-10mins later."
Chris L.,"Rochelle Park, NJ",41,12,21,4.0,6/11/2015,Good food and beer. Love the siracha  brussel sprouts.  Great tang to them. Chili and wraps are very good too. Try the French dip... You won't be disappointed!
Maricel V.,"New City, NY",154,65,17,2.0,8/21/2015,"So grossly upset with my order!! Knowing that my sister loved their pizookie dessert, I wanted to get her a large pizookie cake. What a HUGE MISTAKE. I called in early to let them know I'd pick it up  between 7:30 and 8:00pm. I wasn't able to pick it up till 8:45.. I called them to let them know I was coming. By the time I got there it was still in the oven and the waitress helping me said it would only take 10 mins. I waited for 30 mins... apparently, they threw out the cake they originally made bc it had been sitting out for a while. I'm not sure I fully believe that and I wouldn't have minded a not hot out of the oven cookie cake. I can understand why they would do that for regular food , but not a baked cookie cake. The wait was horrible! By the time we reached where we were supposed to eat dinner, most of the people had finished eating already. What was WORSE was how the large pizookie cake turned out. It wasn't cooked all the way through.  Some parts were really salty, but most of it was way too sweet. It was inedible. I'd probably need insulin just to be able to get through one piece and come out alive. It was a disaster!!!No one even wanted to eat it, including me. The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1 is because 1) the waitress who was helping me was nice, although she lied about the wait time and 2) because I'm nice! Lesson learned: NEVER MAKING THIS MISTAKE AGAIN!"
Lori L.,"Nanuet, NY",29,21,8,1.0,3/15/2016,"Terrible experience Sunday night . Ordered a takeout order apparently the kitchen was having issues receiving the order.   Staff called to confirm order.  Husband shows up to get order, one item is missing.  They make it, other food is cold!   Get it together!!"
Kathy M.,"Garnerville, NY",2,6,1,5.0,4/5/2015,"First time there on 4/4/15.  Nice and airy atmosphere.  Great menu, and if you have not been there before, a lot to look at. The server was a really friendly young lady, attentive without being too on top of us.  I enjoyed the BBQ chopped salad and the dessert, a Caramel pazookie was delicious!"
Laura F.,"Rockville, MD",0,2,,5.0,12/16/2016,"Visiting from MD, stumbled across this gem! Great service,food& prices!  My son loved the keg root beer!"
Christopher L.,"Monsey, NY",143,154,189,3.0,2/4/2015,"The place looks fantastic. It has a very cool vibe. Service is very good but the food is kinda lacking. Desserts Pizookies are very good, they are like easy bake oven desserts. Entrees are okie and appetizers are okie. Nothing really stands out. They are very new and hopefully the food will improve."
Rob H.,"Tuckahoe, NY",4,6,5,4.0,1/7/2016,The beer options were great. The apps and dinners were great.  I had the quinoa with salmon and really enjoyed it.  The waiter (JP) was awesome.  He let me taste different beers and was attentive all night.  I was impressed.
Brenden B.,"Cambridge, MA",3,19,,2.0,7/6/2015,"Nothing was exceptionally bad, but that's not why I go out to eat; I go out to be pleasantly surprised by good food.  While they do have a decent selection of beers, it doesn't make up for the mediocre to poor food. Come here for a drink after work, but don't bother getting food."
Jefferson M.,"Englewood, NJ",64,5,,5.0,12/22/2015,"Love this place! This is our go-to late night spot (after 10pm - 12 or 1am). The happy hour options are well-priced and it's easy to find something you'll like. Even $10 can get you 2 or 3 items and you'll be sated. $15, and call it a good meal."
Shannon B.,"New City, NY",0,12,,3.0,11/16/2016,"So me and my boyfriend went on a date here. We got sat right away in a nice section and the waiter was attentative. However, the steak we ordered was neant to be med-well and came out rare..like rare rare. The pork chops were good but slightly dry, with the ""apple sauce"" provided they were good. The staff was well run and caring but the food was disappointing."
Liz B.,"New City, NY",192,18,,4.0,2/14/2016,Go to lunch spot... grilled Mahi Mahi tacos are my fav!! The pizzas are great and I love the beet salad!
Doug M.,"New City, NY",0,11,1,5.0,4/21/2016,Service is excellent. Food is prepared the way you order it and it is tasty.
Jacki W.,"East Greenville, PA",17,3,,5.0,11/4/2016,"this place was awesome! we visited for the first time today and could not have been more impressed. we had no clue what to order because everything looked so good so we took advice of the waitress. she definitely steered us in the right direction. their homemade cream soda was divine! everything was excellent right down to dessert! wait staff was awesome and very friendly, prices were fair,  definately recommend. we will be visiting again soon!"
Kat K.,"Rochester, NY",200,10,6,4.0,10/26/2015,"Great deep dish pizza and Sriracha honey Brussels sprouts. Happy hour goes until 11PM which is exceptional, but that's probably the only aspect of this restaurant that would win that accolade. I ate here alone and would do so again, but if you're looking for a date place, don't take your girl unless she burps and likes football. Not that those things are bad . . . ? Necessarily? Ok I'm getting side tracked. Everyone was very friendly. The ambiance is unique - it IS, after all, a sports bar - and I would peg it as ""classy tailgate"" or even ""a restaurant that happens to show sports""."
Kathryn G.,"New York, NY",12,8,1,4.0,12/10/2015,"Went here on a Sunday with my sibling unit for some beers, football and food.  I had a great experience.  Beers are good and interesting, food is good too!  I like the vibe with so many TVs we were able to see all the football games we were interested in seeing.  So thanks!  I will be going back.  :)"
Peter M.,"Nyack, NY",45,14,31,5.0,5/2/2016,"BJ's not only has a great selection of food, but an awesome selection of beer as well. They also switch out different beers to always try to have something new and great for you to try. The food is good and I personally like the pulled pork sandwich and the deep dish pizza! Also, don't forget about the pizookie for dessert. Great place for dinner with friends or to bring the family."
Kristin W.,"Union, NJ",3,60,86,4.0,8/22/2015,"I planned a huge surprise dinner party for my boyfriend. The restaurant put up with me calling them three times prior to the date with changes to the reservation (number of people). Thank you for your patience, managers! The evening of, we had a table set up for about 19 people. Service was at first a little slow, but I think they thought we were waiting for more friends to show up. Everything was fine with our orders - I loved the huge variety of the menu and the super reasonable prices!  Again, we were a huge party on a Friday evening, and the staff was attentive and friendly with drinks and orders. A party of 19 isn't an every day case so I was super pleased when everything went smoothly for my boyfriend's birthday surprise."
