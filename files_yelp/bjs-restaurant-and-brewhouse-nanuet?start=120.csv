Barbra R.,"New City, NY",0,10,,5.0,4/30/2016,"BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse is one of my favorites!  Whether lunch or dinner at a table, or drinks and app's at the bar, the  hosts, servers, bussers and bartenders have always been so welcoming, friendly, helpful and professional.  With the decor, tv's and vaulted ceilings, BJ's ambiance is cool, chill, can be sporty yet has a trendy city feel.  You can hear the buzz echo though the restaurant.  The bathrooms are clean.  And the servers, bussers and bartenders I've experienced keep the tables and bar immaculate.  The place gives a smooth comfortable feel. I need to give honorable mentions of the exceptional service I've had over the lasy year.. Stanley the manager has gone above and beyond ensuring our needs and any issues were met.  Sam the server and Matt the bartender gave the perfect amount of cheer, care and knowledge for a perfect meal and a perfect cocktail with apps. Gerald the service assistant gave the perfect amount of cheer, care and attention to us and our table. So glad we have BJ's in Nanuet, our neighboring town..."
Seth C.,"Suffern, NY",177,27,9,4.0,11/13/2015,Menu is creative and delicious. My blue martini and my wife's pink cadilac were delicious. The lettuce wraps were good and the southern fried chicken was great. My wife had the North Atlantic Salmon and the vegis were slightly undercooked but the salmon was very good. Server was friendly and knowledgeable.
Lori W.,"New City, NY",33,31,,3.0,3/4/2015,"BJs is your typical type of restaurant chain, similar to Dave and Busters. I had a burgers and a salad and 2 glasses of Pinot Grigio.  Service a tiny bit above average same with food so hence the 3 star rating."
B-Man H.,"Orange County, NY",5,70,5,2.0,1/10/2016,The service at this place is pretty awful.  It seems like they lack management.  The food takes forever and doesn't come out at the same time.  The soda is flat.  The food is decent but doesn't make up for the terrible service.  I would not recommend.
Elizabeth R.,"Teaneck, NJ",13,116,41,4.0,2/4/2016,"This is one of my favorite local spots mostly because it is one of the only places open late (until 1 am). The place is pretty big so if there is a wait it usually isn't long, but it's an awesome place to go watch a game, have dinner or just hang out at the bar area."
John J.,"Mount Kisco, NY",3,23,1,5.0,9/15/2015,"Just stopped by for drinks and a quick bite last week. I have to say the service was quick and friendly and my drink packed a kick. I enjoyed my burger  the location has ample parking. It's kid friendly, and the decor is smooth and comfortable. This is definitely a good spot to relax and unwind."
Robert P.,"Deer Park, TX",0,5,,5.0,9/25/2016,"I will make this short and sweet. I was very impressed with the service I received at the bar. The place was getting busy for Sunday football and the bartender, Nicole, never missed a beat. She kept up with everything thrown her way even though she was the only one making drinks for the entire place.I will definitely come back here."
Angel A.,"Fort Lee, NJ",1,13,5,1.0,11/24/2015,Warning avoid this place like axe cologne. Slow service terrible food. The server was pleasant.
Michele V.,"Nanuet, NY",130,11,6,1.0,7/30/2015,"Beware: Husband got food poisoning from the Clam Chowder. Since he's traumatized in going back I went with my sister in law and we decided to order some drinks, an appetizer, and to share the main dish. We ordered the Pulled Pork Sandwich. We started eating and when my sister in law took a bite and placed the sandwich on her plate she noticed mildew on the bread!! (I will post a picture) The server was not even apologetic, offered to put the fries on a separate plate and take back the sandwich. It wasn't till what felt like forever that the manager came over to offer a replacement. We ordered another appetizer but I was so starving by the time it came we somewhat filled up on fries and our drinks and weren't that hungry anymore. The manager also sent us two drinks and when the bill came they charged us for it! Horrible experience, unsympathetic waitress who then rushed us to pay, and the manager wasn't even on top of resolving it by making sure the check was adjusted. Never going back again."
Matthew B.,"Nanuet, NY",1,1,,5.0,10/4/2015,"*** Ignore bad reviews!!! *** Spacious, quiet, delicious, fast, friendly, fantastic! Our server Monica was awesome. Friendly and knew all about the Many beers on tap!  Root beer BBQ ribs were great, so we're the wings, and the deep dish pizza! Prices were not bad at all for drinks and food. Happy hour deals are great and all day Sunday!  We are locals, and we will be back."
Michael S.,"West Bronx, NY",21,11,30,4.0,4/8/2015,"Nice open spacious. The service was excellent and the everything came out promptly. Ordered the pizza, salad wraps, and avocado egg rolls and they were very good for the price. I ordered during happy hour, the mojito was weak but the beer was good. Will go back for the pizza. So tasty and firmly doughy. The texture is like a perfectly cooked Red Barrons pizza on steroids. AWESOME!"
Kristine L.,"Thiells, NY",1,3,1,1.0,8/8/2015,"I should preface by saying that I have 3 kids under three and for us, timing is everything. I came in and asked the receptionist how long the wait was, after asking how many of us and do we need high chairs (yes), she responds 15 minutes. After 25 minutes, kids starting to get antsy, I go back in and she explains that we were specifically waiting for a table to accommodate the high chairs. I told her I didn't know that, I will take a booth if it expedites the process. She said we will sit next. Fine. After 5 minutes I see an outside sitting open up, I go back in and tell her we WANT that table, potentially screaming kids away from a crowd, sound like a sweet deal. She said she'll get it cleaned. Long story short, she forgets to mention its self seating, had I known this I would've guarded that table like a hawk...of course we lose it to another customer. I go in to complain, by this time it's already been 40 minutes of total waiting, spoke to a manager, who did really nothing but smirk and say I'm sorry. End of story, we sat smack in the middle of the dining room after 40 minutes of waiting, waited for our food another 20-30 minutes, even though we ordered right when we sat. You would think, they would at least get the kids food out asap. By the time the food comes out, kids are freaking out since they see food - but guess what, no utensils on the table. Is that not restaurant 101? Utensils on the table?  Oh and the manager - he never came back to see how we were doing. The waiter seemed distracted, was a bit sarcastic, bordering rude. The receptionist, ugh, attitude problem. Great service recovery, really.  It's unfortunate, since the food was good....but service was poor and unprofessional."
Paul A.,"New City, NY",77,18,,3.0,6/25/2016,"went again tonight for the $2.00 off appetizers... almost didn't get it.  our waitress never mentioned the $2.00 off apps were during happy hour, before 6pm.  we were there about 605pm, we specifically asked for the $2.00 off apps... she said ""no problem"" then, when we asked for the check... they didn't deduct the $2.00!!  then, i even had to ask for the manager... she even gave me this attitude, not even apologetic... if you want to try their hidden promos..make sure you read the fine print.."
Dylan D.,"Saddle River, NJ",0,7,,5.0,9/12/2016,"Really enjoyed our meal, drinks, and the service. Convenient location, decent variety to pick from for food and tons of beers. We were unsure of what we wanted and our waiter let us sample a couple of their brews before we selected. Service was friendly and quick and the meal was reasonably priced. Would definitely eat here again!"
John F.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,4,,3.0,3/7/2016,While the food ok and the pizza is different than some of the local places I was so disappointed by the service. They need to have a better check in system. I used the app and it said that there was no wait. I got there and still had to wait.  The hostess did nothing to help and actually made my wait longer.  When I finally sat down the beer list was good and long and the beer was cold. The pizza was delicious yet more expensive than local places.  So the determining factor on a return will be how bad I want a craft beer.
Angelique B.,"Nanuet, NY",0,4,,2.0,3/5/2016,So disappointed!!! We ordered 3 steaks and ask for med well. Came back rare!!! Ask the waiter to take it back and have it cook more still came back rare didn't have that much flavor what a huge disappointment thinking about not coming back. We used to love the place but lately every time we go these days it's been not good. Not happy
Kathy J.,"Nanuet, NY",0,6,,5.0,2/28/2016,"This is my favorite restaurant. I'm addicted to the Mediterranean tacos, and the Brussels sprouts appetizer. I was there Thursday night, and our server, Jaz was great. He was polite and personable and anticipated our requests before we even had to ask. Excellent!"
Jordan S.,"New City, NY",2,36,,4.0,12/29/2015,"Much better than 3 stars! They make their own beer and have a wide selection, so that alone is worth 4 stars in my book. Also the sourdough bread bowls are amazingly tasty. The bread is perfectly toasted every time and they go the extra step of turning the bowl cover/top roasted garlic bread. I can't make a trip here without ordering the New England clam chowder.  Fries are really good and crispy, pizza is very good, so are the burgers (especially the sliders- and I never order sliders) and many other items. The only time I was underwhelmed was when I ordered a Cajun pasta that just wasn't spicy enough, but otherwise pretty good."
Alicia K.,"Monroe, NY",1,48,,5.0,1/22/2016,"I have been here twice and had a great experience both times. The service was excellent and so was the food. They have a big menu and their prices are fair. I had the ribs, which were great, and a beer that was paired with it, which I really enjoyed. My friends also enjoyed their meals. The only complaint I have about the food is that the flat bread pizza appetizer was very dry because the toppings were so sparse, we had to ask for extra sauce. I like the atmosphere, but it is just a little bit too dark. All in all, it's a fun place to visit with great food and service! I highly recommend!"
Briella B.,"Deer Park, NY",0,25,25,5.0,12/21/2015,I love the atmosphere of this place. Cool place to come and hangout for lunch or dinner with friends. Awesome selection of beers and ale's and good food.
