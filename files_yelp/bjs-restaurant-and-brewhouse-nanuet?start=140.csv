David M.,"Haverstraw, NY",19,30,4,4.0,12/15/2015,"Stopped in for lunch the other day and ate at the bar. Received excellent and friendly service from the bartender.  The 2 BJs beers (Jeremiah Red & Tatonka Stout) I had were pretty great and on lunch special. Ordered the Roasted Chicken and Spinach Quinoa Bowl, which was a good portion size for lunch. It was a nice quiet place to enjoy a break from shopping and the service was quick and painless. Can't ask for much more."
william c.,"Newark, DE",95,29,1,4.0,12/1/2015,"Great little spot, good beer, good jambalaya and pretty decent service.  A little slow but still decent."
David S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,7,12,3.0,2/10/2016,It's ok for a beers the food is not that great.. But it's a chain so you know that going into it.
Savannah C.,"Albany, NY",47,49,13,2.0,6/17/2015,"Eh. Just Eh. Drinks (strawberry margarita) are TERRIBLY watered down, even for a light drinker like myself .. The cajun chicken pasta was oversalted, with that being its only ""flavor."" Prices weren't too bad, might try it one more time..."
Eugene A.,"Cumming, GA",39,3,,2.0,8/6/2015,Have been sitting here in the restaurant for 20 minutes now without even an acknowledgement from a server to even offer to bring drinks.  I have to imagine it will only go down hill from here.
Minna G.,"New City, NY",1,31,1,5.0,12/2/2015,Very nice hangout spot. We come in for happy hour weekdays 3-6 and the food/service is on point! Love the pizookie and appetizers!
Diane M.,"Harrington Park, NJ",0,4,,5.0,6/30/2016,"Food is fantastic and service is great! We were offered to sample the new summer beer and took the waiter up on it. If you're a craft ale type person or a beer lover, you will love this place. We shared the honey srirachia brussels sprouts and the crispy portobello mushroom sticks appetizer. Both were bursting with flavor! Then we had summer salad with fresh watermelon and feta which was delicious. Next time, I hope I have room to order an entree!"
John D.,"New City, NY",0,26,5,5.0,2/6/2016,"Always a good meal. This time it was lunch, most times its dinner. Friendly staff and excellent management team"
Spanky S.,"New City, NY",8,103,2,5.0,9/8/2015,"I don't understand some of the negative reviews of this place.  The food is awesome, the beer and drink selections are amazing and the service is absolutely fine.  We have been here several times and whether we order a bunch of appetizers or the complete dinners, we have always been more then satisfied with the food.  The service is professional and attentive.  Keep in mind this is a chain type restaurant, you aren't coming here for fine dining.  The negative reviewers need to relax, sip their beer and enjoy."
Molly M.,"New City, NY",37,21,1,2.0,2/27/2015,"BJ's Brewhouse in Nanuet opened February 3rd 2015. I went for the 1st time February 27th and by my observation they are still in a learning phase which is unacceptable for a restaurant that is a chain. Being in Food Srv Mgnt front and back of house for many years and have been 1st hand a at openings, I know the extensive training that is required for all staff to be universally skilled and knowledgeable w/ all of the menu items as well as drinks We arrived at 6 PM on a Friday and it had a moderate amount of guests already seated. However, the hostess could not take anyone's names because she could not access how long the wait time was without a manager's assistance. There was a line of people who were already there and people who had just arrived. This created a bit of havoc as to who was next to give their names.  When my fiance went to the bar to order a Sauvingon Blanc which is on their menu the bartender went to look at their beers and then was told its a wine not a beer and his reply was, ""We don't have that"" I went to tell the manager that the bartender has no idea what Sauvignon Blanc or that you even sell it and all I was told was ""Oh okay""  I feel a managers' job is to remedy a situation at least with an apology and that he would take care of this. This lack of apathy in management is not encouraging.  My fiance then asked if he could make a Chocolate Martini ( which is not on  menu) but not a difficult drink to make if you are a bartender in a bigger, trendier place. His response was, ""I could but we ran out of Godiva""  This is ineffective ordering of on a Friday at 6 PM when you run out of a liquor that might not have been able to make my drink but it also will not make any other drink on their menu either.  Our waiter was sincere, welcoming and friendly. I ordered a chocolate raspberry beer which i pointed to on the menu, and my fiance ordered the Sauvignon Blanc. The waiter came back moments later and asked me to show him where the beer was on the menu. I asked the server if he was with them from the beginning and he said yes. I asked if they trained him on the menu and his answer was, "" There are so many items my head is ready to blow up"" The drinks took about 10-15 mins to arrive. When the drinks did arrive my fiance was give a red wine. This mishap was corrected. But waiting that long and seeing only 3 bartenders for the size of the place is an accident waiting to happen in terms of wait time and errors.  I ordered the fish taco's with tomato salsa and an avocado cream sauces on the side accompanied by fresh and crispy tortilla chips. Very tasty and presented well on the plate. My fiance ordered the rack of baby back ribs, mashed potatoes and Brussel sprouts. The meat was falling off the bone and the sweet BBQ sauce tasted delicious and house made. The potato's were dry and the Brussel sprouts were very small and overcooked. Over all I feel whatever regional manager they sent to prepare, train and motivate the staff should be retrained himself.  A restaurant which is a chain has a reputation to uphold in management, training, and that manager should not leave until he is assured that the staff is up to par.  BJ's Resturant and Brewhouse you clearly are not ready to serve anyone.  Please pass this place up when choosing to go out to eat."
Juan S.,"Hillsdale, NJ",2,15,1,4.0,10/25/2015,The food was good the jambalaya was excellent as always. There with a party of 12 and they did well considering we all came in at different times. The staff was courteous.
Christina N.,"Glen Oaks, NY",502,186,134,4.0,5/20/2015,"I have to say the waitress was so friendly and accommodating. She allowed me and my uncle to taste their homemade brews before actually ordering one. We asked for recommendations and they were great. The thin/flat bread pizza is so tasty and flavorful. The stuffed mushrooms were delicious. Each dish was so good from deep dish pizza, flat pizza, salads."
Karen P.,"Paramus, NJ",20,21,2,1.0,5/17/2015,Horrible food. My husband ordered the ahi tuna appetizer in poki sauce. No flavor no sauce.  I ordered the buffalo burger med rare with everything on the side. Nothing on the burger of course it came with everything on the burger. Sent it back waited 20 minutes for a new one that one came so well done I could have thrown it and it would have bounced. I couldn't even cut it. Sent it back and after being ther an hour left with nothing to eat. My son had the Parmesan chicken that was okay. Artichoke appetizer was just okay. Service was very very slow. Waitress was very pleasant did the best she could to please. Never would eat here again. Bad experience.
Gregory S.,"Norwalk, CT",63,8,,1.0,2/28/2015,"I have tried to enjoy their food but it is an abomination.  On their first day opening, I tried their Fritos Nachos, which were stale, and not just a little stale, but they seemed to be from a bag opened weeks earlier.  How this is possible is anybody's guess.  The jambalaya although spicy lacked seasoning aka salt, which is a common theme with their subpar food.  Their California Chicken sandwich also lacked any semblance of salt, otherwise known as flavor.  The french fries were soggy and poorly seasoned.  Also, their pizza is on par with a middle school's cafeteria pizza.  Perhaps people in other states like unseasoned food, but this place is not fit for NY."
Sc S.,"West Nyack, NY",0,3,,4.0,6/27/2016,"Went there for dinner with my husband and three kids. Ages 17,11 and 9 for the first time Saturday 6/25/16. Sam was our waitress and she was wonderful. We will definitely ask for her next time we visit.  In fact from hostess to servers, everyone was friendly. The food was very good and priced well. We had the brisket sandwich, hamburger, shrimp tacos and kids pizza. Overall my family gave a it a thumbs up."
Marc L.,"New City, NY",1,7,1,5.0,6/24/2015,"Awesome atmosphere, delicious food and fair prices. Sriracha Brussel sprouts were amazing.   Kaylyn was friendly and helpful."
Paul K.,"Manhattan, NY",1,70,,2.0,11/30/2015,"Typical chain restaurant and brew house. The food is average at best and the beer sucks. I tried some of there house brews and was highly disappointed. I wasn't expecting anything great when I walked in so I wasn't that disappointed. The decor is nice if you like a wide open space, it's like eating in a fish bowl. I would not recommend this establishment to anyone I know."
Sabrina H.,"Suffern, NY",139,52,33,5.0,2/29/2016,"I've always wanted to try this restaurant and since I was looking for a new place to celebrate my birthday, I decided it was time.  We got in around 5 pm with no wait time (I made reservations for 20 people) and the restaurant was packed.  We ordered the siracha boneless chicken, Santa Fe egg rolls, avocado rolls, and calamari for appetizers.  Everything tasted great.  I ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken and my hubby ordered the Deep Dish Ziti.  Both were delicious.  I didn't hear any complaints from any of my guests about their food.  Everyone loved what they ordered.  It was time for dessert and I ordered the Ghirardelli Pizookie.  When it arrived, I was disappointed that I didn't see a birthday candle in it.  Two seconds later, they surprised me with the famous chocolate chunk Pizookie with a birthday candle in it!  It tasted much better than the one I ordered.  I would definitely order that next time!  It was divine!  As soon as the waiters and my guests starting singing happy birthday, everyone else in the entire restaurant started singing happy birthday to me!  It was priceless!  The waiters were so attentive and courteous.  They checked on us many times to make sure we were okay.  The manager, Stanley, also made sure we were having a good time.  Thank you to BJs for making my birthday special and a memorable one!  I will be back!"
Sarah O.,"Hoboken, NJ",133,90,,5.0,3/23/2015,Food and service was amazing!  My friend had the buffalo wings and I had the sliders.  They had accidentally put ketchup on my burgers but they were extremely nice and apologetic by making new ones immediately.  The manager also had made a point to apologize which I thought was extremely professional and they removed it off the check.  Extremely convenient since it is in the Nanuet mall - great place to go to before or after a movie - I will definitely be coming back to BJ's!
MIchael V.,"Nanuet, NY",114,11,,5.0,11/21/2015,Great food and good service .  I enjoyed watching the football games on the TV screens that surround the walls.
