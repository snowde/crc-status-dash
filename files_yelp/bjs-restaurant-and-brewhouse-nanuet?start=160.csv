David T.,"Brooklyn, NY",734,91,65,2.0,4/7/2015,Beautiful building.... the food is good.. but not impressive... the beer selection is killer.. the service is not up to par... seriously  lacking.. everyone there acted as if they had something else better to do than be at work....maybe it is a off night i am not sure but for this being my first time i am not impressed
Maire B.,"Nanuet, NY",11,61,,1.0,11/10/2015,"First of all, it was a cloudy day when my five friends and I were squeezed into a small booth, when the place was 3/4 empty and there were plenty of other tables where we could have been seated.  I faced the three friends opposite me, but with the poor lighting above and the huge window behind them I found it hard to see any of their silhouetted faces even though the sky behind them was so dark and dreary.. My hamburger was not medium rare. It was dry and tasteless. The friend opposite me ordered a chicken over quinoa, I believe and said it was gross. The others who ordered burgers and a salmon dish said they were just ok. So much for BJ'S.  Oh, the fries and coffee was good, served in huge mugs. One star. Sorry."
Pattie G.,"Fort Lee, NJ",1,14,,5.0,4/24/2016,"We sat at the bar today and had great service and great food. The bartender was attentive an knowledgeable. She really knew the beers they served, and made great recommendations. The food was awesome. The prices were very reasonable, we had two sandwiches, two beers and an ice-tea for less than $40."
Marc F.,"New City, NY",93,20,4,2.0,2/26/2015,The service is horrible.  The entire staff (minus the kitchen) is between the ages of 18-24 and this is clearly their first or second serving gig.  The food is very average but expensive for what it is.  I will not be back though I don't see this place sticking around as it has the Rockland County failing restaurant curse written all over it.
Ko I.,"Westwood, NJ",0,2,,5.0,4/30/2016,"This is our second time here in a week. Tasty dishes and fast service. Our server was very courteous as well. Prices were reasonable. Although we did not have enough time for dessert, the selection looks great.  We used to default to the Grand Lux restaurant at the Garden State Mall, but this place is much better IMO. Looking forward to dining here again."
Dan S.,"Bardonia, NY",2,31,4,4.0,7/19/2015,"Went in for lunch the other day and had a very pleasant experience.  Lots of beers to choose from, short of a Yard House experience, but still more than enough to keep your interest.  Ordered the BBQ brisket burger, service was prompt, and the meal was delicious and very proportional as I didn't bust a gut to finish."
Robert A.,"Rochelle Park, NJ",19,114,5,4.0,3/18/2015,"Went for a lunch and found it to be very good.  Although there was some kind of problem finding something on the computer( advanced reservation or club membership) which tied up all the hostesses for a few minutes for a couple ahead of me the seating was reasonably fast. The food was tasty and not overly priced although the ""pizza"" they make is nothing like the ""normal"" pizza found in this area.   The atmosphere is a large cavernous warehouse but , maybe because its brand new. the place was clean and relatively quiet. Looking forward to going back to try some more dishes."
John O.,"Ala Moana, Honolulu, HI",56,4,1,3.0,3/29/2015,"Food is always good....WORST SERVICE EVER! Worse than Chili's, which is saying something (in my opinion)."
Robert R.,"New Canaan, CT",0,24,,4.0,3/23/2015,"Great food for the price point.  Appetizers are huge.  Beer is on point.  BJ's is a restaurant chain based in Southern California.  They've finally decided to put a few locations on the east coast, and it should do well.  If you're at the mall, it's a great place to come with the family to grab some food, either lunch or dinner.  The bar area is great if you're just looking for a place to have a beer or two and watch the game. Their specialty is the deep dish pizza, but it's average at best coming from NY.  It probably translates better out west where local pizza joints are tough to come by.  But if you order an entree, or a burger/sandwich, you will not be disappointed.  Think of it like a Friday's with way better food and a better vibe."
Jen B.,"Rosedale, Queens, NY",4,18,8,3.0,2/24/2015,The food is good but you will be seated for 20mins before a waiter even comes to you. Came here on a Tuesday night & sat & waited for 20 mins before a waiter even acknowledged out presence.
Charlie L.,"Orangeburg, NY",1,125,28,3.0,8/9/2015,"Went here twice and it was A OK. Will be back. Nothing spectacular but was good. First time I went was with some coworkers and we ordered mainly burgers with beers. Speaking of which they had a great selection of beers. It was good enough that I went back with my family and overall it was acceptable again. The atmosphere was great, especially for watching a game while you chow down on some food. Im not going to get into nitty gritty this time because nothing really stood out. We will be back though. Haven't tried the PF changs next door but judging from the yelpers there, I wouldn't want to wait 1hr for my food which did not happen at BJ brewhouse. The food came fairly quickly both times and the service was fine."
Darwin D.,"Nanuet, NY",152,16,1,4.0,5/10/2015,Food's great so does the choices for beers. Just a bit expensive so don't be surprise when it comes to prices.
Ann P.,"West Nyack, NY",10,55,13,3.0,6/11/2015,"I always have a nice time there, but every single time I've gotten the impression that they were trying to rush you out of there!! My friend and I were not even nearly finished with our meal or drinks and they already asked if we wanted boxes to pack up our meal! Every time!"
Keila B.,"Nyack, NY",40,164,65,3.0,5/17/2015,"Went to BJ's for an early lunch one Sunday. It wasn't crowded and we were able to sit outside. Overall the food was good but not incredibly inspired.  I had one of their fun drinks: it was some sort of Jack Daniel's blueberry lemonade concoction. It was good. Right amount of alcohol. I had the Corn Fritters with Bacon Aioli as an appetizer. They were ok except for the fact that they were a little mushy/underdone in the very middle. There could have been a little more aioli.  The mister had the Fritos Nachos. Again, good, but not out of this world. The chili was average and I like how it was served in a deep dish casserole thing. Cute.  For my entree I had the French Dip sandwich. It was very good and the portion was generous enough without being obnoxiously huge. It came with skinny fries and they were really good. I'm a French fry aficionado so I judge. These passed muster.  My man had the watermelon feta salad. He liked it although he later regretted getting something so light because he was hungry. I was full from my meal so he had the second half of my sandwich. My munchkin had the cheese pizza from the kids' menu and she ate most of it so I'll say it was good. Service was attentive and friendly. Would I go again? Not really sure. Although it wasn't bad, it wasn't amazing enough to get me to rush back there."
S O.,"Congers, NY",0,2,,1.0,2/13/2016,"Came in on a Saturday night for a family dinner and waited an extra 45 minutes after calling in a reservation for the ""wait list"" 30 minutes before showing up. The staff including the manager was very  unorganized. Not worth the wait, do not see myself coming back."
Mike J.,"Nanuet, NY",37,4,1,2.0,2/26/2015,"Here for my first time, late lunch 1330 by myself. For whatever reason I came in the back door, by the take out. It was probably a parking issue more than anything else. The girl at the back door was a little troubled that I had come in the ""pickup"" door but did walk me to the front desk where an enthusiastic young lady said sit anywhere you would like. Nice. This is where it starts to go wrong and I start looking for my phone to read how this place has been doing. You know when you have been sitting there waiting so long  that you start thinking about walking out. Thats how long. Its like a quest now. 10 employees of all kinds are walking by. Not a word. Now I have been here a full 20 minutes, no drink, no meeting of the ""server"".    Finally a young girl says hello, I am staring at the TV running some old football show so long that she startled me. She inquiries if this was my first trip to BJs. I indicated it was She goes into a memorized beer pitch, which just by my body language alone she realized that it was time to get down to brass tacks. I ordered food and drink, which came very quickly, was good and fresh. I have never heard of a BJs brewhouse before coming here but I am sure there is a GREAT one somewhere. So great in fact that some smart guy desided to copy it in Nanuet NY. The only problem is that there is no culture of employee here. I am sure at some point they will figure it out, or this place will be gone. If you go leave extra time.."
Jimmy R.,"New York, NY",32,4,2,5.0,4/19/2015,"First time here, stop before during my last service call. Sat at the bar and had Alicia as my server. Asked her what was good on the menu, she recommended chicken sandwich with salad. Great choice and service. I would come back here again."
Jacqui A.,"Nanuet, NY",0,19,,5.0,8/19/2015,"U absolutely had a great time here. Excellent choices of beer matched with food, healthy meals, kid's menu.. Sports and good music on. Lots of fun! Friendly staff! Highly recommend!!!!"
Patrick O.,"Hackensack, NJ",35,25,3,4.0,3/19/2016,Food and service was very good. They were very busy only had to wait about 5 minutes. The only reason why I'm leaving four stars was because there was a hair on the first potato skin I reached for.
Jamie V.,"New City, NY",14,2,1,5.0,8/9/2015,"Let me start by saying that I work in the industry. Going to this restaurant reminded me why I love my job so much. It's an amazing feeling going out to eat and leaving satisfied with absolutely no complaints and that's what happened today.  Great food, impeccable service and just an overall great experience."
