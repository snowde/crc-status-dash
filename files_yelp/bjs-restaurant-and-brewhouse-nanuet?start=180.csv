Jennifer H.,"Nanuet, NY",0,7,,1.0,2/15/2015,"I think they rushed to open and the staff is far from ready.  We did the call ahead reservations only to show up and see a mob in the entry way.  The call ahead system crashed so everyone was ready to riot.  We waited about 30 minutes for our table.  Our waiter was friendly but not very knowledgeable.  It took 10 minutes for drinks.  Another 15 to get our beers and place our appetizer order.  Appetizers were ok.  Meals came but they forgot my husbands salad.  When we ordered a second round of beers it took another 15 minutes, only to find out they ran out of the beer I ordered, so I waited another 10 for that.  Dinners were ok.. sounded better on paper.  We ordered 2 desserts.  My daughters came in a reasonable time.  We waited 25 minutes for the waiter to tell my husband that there was a problem with his.. and then another 10-15 minutes for the manager to come out and basically say we were out of luck.  I will not be returning anytime soon. Also.. bring a coat.  Very cold inside."
Ian W.,"Manhattan, NY",7,4,2,4.0,4/22/2015,I have been here twice and both times I had a great experience. The beers are good even though I m not a brew expert. Food was great and my kids loved the pizza. I would definitely return.
Danni Z.,"New City, NY",48,4,,4.0,1/26/2016,"We are frequent visitors (although it has been about a month since our last visit) and we tried some new items (light Clementine drink, wings, Sriracha Brussel Sprouts, chili) which were excellent. The food never disappoints. But don't forget to try Pumpkin Ale, Jambalaya, Deep Dish Pizza, Chicken Lettuce Wraps, and the entire Enlightened Menu. So many choices, all excellent!"
Gary M.,"Spring Valley, NY",7,13,,2.0,2/4/2015,"Well, the place is new so that can say a few things. That being that the service is trying but needs a lot of help. Our waitress was very sweet. However she forgot our appetizer and immediately brought our main dishes. Those were taken back, the appetizer appeared and again, 10 minutes later they brought out the main dishes. Half our apps still in front of our faces. The manager came over soon thereafter and stated "" We opened only 2 days ago. Maybe on the third we'll get things right."" (I'm giggling right now thinking of how ridiculous a statement that was.) There was one redeeming factor though....Tuesday nights wine is half price. At they're regular selling price, taking 50% off, made it very cheap."
Natalie Dawn T.,"Pomona, NY",1,4,,5.0,10/4/2015,"I am really not sure why this place got bad reviews because this place is awesome! I'm so glad my husband and I decided to ignore what others have said and give it a try.  Our server, Monica was really friendly, really taking the time to explain the Happy Hour menu and even gave us tips about what apps were cheaper on that menu than the full price one.  She knew a lot about beer and gave us her critique on what was good. Her suggestion on the Nutty Brewnette was spot on!  Plus the food was actually very food.  We loved the deep dish pizza and Root Beer wings and ribs.  The ribs were so good, my husband didn't even share! But that's OK by me because I loved the Lemon Pepper rub wings.  Despite the multiple TVs with Sunday Football and Baseball on and a sizeable dinner crowd, the environment was cool. It was quiet enough to have a conversation with your date. Finally,  while the ambiance was relaxing, the food was good and Monica's fast and friendly service was the star, just about every server we came in contact with was just as friendly and warm.  So its safe to say that BJ's is gonna be the place that knows our names because this will be our new date night place for a while."
Jude S.,"Nyack, NY",0,32,,4.0,3/8/2015,It's still in it's learning phase but the food is your regular restaurant food. The flatbreads are better than the pizza. Pizza needs more marinara but still tasty. My server desmond was extremely friendly and got everything to us on time. Try the watermelon and feta salad..
Rachel C.,"Schenectady, NY",0,2,,1.0,4/27/2016,"I was going on a date and decided that BJ's would be a great place to meet.  We were promptly greeted and seated.  The hosts were lovely.  Then our waitress (Kaylyn M) came over quickly and asked us if we would like a beverage.  We put our orders in for drinks and then put in order for appetizers and dinner.  When our appetizer arrived (wings), we still did not have napkins or silverware and or waitress quickly left and we did not have time to ask her.  The waitress in the section next to us realized and asked if we needed something and she got us some.  Then, as soon as we got napkins and silverware, our entrees arrived.  So by the time we ate our wings, our entrees were cold.  Our glasses sat empty for our meals.  The waitress never asked how our meals were.  She never cleared the plates, I had to ask twice.  Then after twenty minutes of waiting with the dessert menu from the table open in front of me, the dirty dishes pushed to the end of the table, and the empty glasses put where she could see, she asked if we would like dessert.  Not only did I have to ask for boxes, refills, and the plates cleared, but she managed to drop the check right after she brought the desserts out.  We weren't even near halfway done.  Meanwhile, in all our spare time sitting at our dirty table, we had a lovely view of the kitchen, which contained five staff in which we were able to count eating off the line.  We managed to get a video and pictures. Two staff were eating ribs, one eating french fries and I'm not sure what the other were munching on, looked delicious though. I do not think I want to return with service and uncleanliness like this, even though I enjoyed the food."
N G.,"Suffern, NY",1,6,9,4.0,2/29/2016,"For a chain restaurant not bad, deep dish pizza is a must, alcoholic drink was on the weak side. Service was good."
Christy W.,"Pearl River, NY",0,20,2,5.0,3/25/2015,"Wonderful experience at BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse this evening. Admittedly my expectations were low after reading reviews from fellow yelpers. Coupled with the fact that this is a chain I was ho-hum about going here, but the boyfriend wanted to check it out so off we went. Let me say that we had none of the issues with service that others have experienced. Every single employee we encountered was friendly and welcoming. Our server, Eric, was one of the best waiters we've had in recent memory. Aside from being a genuinely nice guy, he was extremely attentive and helpful; his menu recommendations were spot on. Thanks to Eric I tried the Deep Dish Vegetarian Pizza and Lightswitch Lager. Both were excellent and worthy of 5 stars. My b/f had the Carnitas Fries w/ Chile Verde and Blackened Shrimp Tacos, and he was also very pleased with his meal. It seems the kinks have been worked out with whatever issues this place may have had previously. I suggest you give it a try!"
N H.,"Nanuet, NY",1,7,,2.0,8/25/2015,"Slow, slow service.  Serving staff that could care less about your wait time.  Less then average food quality. Although pizza was okay.  Took about an hour to get it!  Definitely the type of blah place you wander into on vacation in Florida.  But really has no purpose in an upscale shopping mall."
Christine S.,"Suffern, NY",33,4,,4.0,4/11/2015,"Went here last Monday for dinner. Nice atmosphere and great food. Our server - Samantha - was fantastic. The draft beer selection is incredible - must try Jeremiah Red! Pizza was delicious! Food overall was good. Only issue - my steak was over seasoned so next time I will request to have less seasoning. Great place for a family meal, sports viewing or a casual date night. Will definitely be back!"
Eileen D.,"Pearl River, NY",28,2,,5.0,2/23/2016,Went for late lunch and  our waitress Holly was very friendly and helpful with our selections. She also remembered us from a previous visit. It's nice to have a server who is social with return customers!
Michael H.,"Wayne, NJ",0,2,,5.0,2/23/2016,Love this place... I visit BJ's everytime I travel to AZ now there is one near home. Can't wait till the one in Teterboro opens!!
Alexa T.,"Nanuet, NY",1,9,16,5.0,11/6/2015,"Affordable, good service, good drinks for a good price. Been here several times, I recommend sitting outside if there are seats available, beautiful fireplace."
Aaron A.,"Gravesend, Brooklyn, NY",0,35,,2.0,5/9/2015,Atmosphere and restaurant environment is very very cool and nice. Service is good. Don't come here other than for a burger n beers lol. And/or drinks. The setting is all that deserves 5 stars.
Yard L.,"Spring Valley, NY",217,9,5,5.0,12/14/2015,"I have been to BJ's twice. The first time was amazing but the second time was even better. I never liked avocados, but BJ's made me fall in love with them when I ordered the avacado eggrolls. The flavors, the options, and price point for the amount of food you get is remarkable. This restaurant is always consistant, service is great, food is always on point. Def one of my new local spots."
Sal S.,"White Plains, NY",1,21,29,4.0,4/29/2015,"In all honesty this place was better than I expected to be. I definitely recommend HopStorm(beer). Very Hoppy about it. Goes great with the Exxtra hot wings. I didn't get a full meal as me and my date decided to do appetizers instead. They were all amazing Mac & Cheese, Sliders, Wings, Flat Bread. Staff was very friendly and our waitress was very personable, nice and professional. After we ordered she told us that the good cooks are gone by 10:00pm so the appetizers are a better choice at that time. She was always there but never on top of us. This place is very similar to Yard House. They have a good beer list and lots of TV's. The place was clean."
Rebecca B.,"New City, NY",1,20,3,4.0,8/24/2015,Staff was polite. Waited 45 mins for a table on a Saturday night. Food came fast for a filled restaurant.
Meg M.,"Wildomar, CA",0,13,2,5.0,1/29/2016,Great staff and management! Foods amazing and great beer options. Must go if you're in Rockland county.
Reen A.,"Saddle River, NJ",1,9,,2.0,9/20/2015,"We had a pleasant lunch  in the patio one weekend  and kids wanted to come back for dinner. Unfortunately a completely different experience;  entrees were terrible. Flat bread pizza was on par with frozen pizza, marinara sauce; worse than jar sauce. To top off our meal, we ordered the Pizookie trio dessert which had marinara sauce baked into it. Horrible! Management did stop by to apologize, made another dessert and comped the dessert when the bill arrived . With So many choices  in the casual dining category; we will not be coming back to BJs."
