A A.,"Nanuet, NY",0,11,,2.0,6/29/2015,"We were so excited about BJs opening up in the neighborhood but after going there on five different occasions (with girlfriends, with kids, on a date) the service has consistently been slow and something from our order is always wrong!  We kept chalking it up to they are new but it's been a while now and I have yet to see a manager ever come by and try to make a situation right.  We thought it was a great place to go for drinks and dinner initially but now after several attempts, we realize it's not worth it."
John D.,"Tappan, NY",2,10,,4.0,4/11/2015,"Large open space, great food at reasonable prices. Their house beers are excellent. They also serve your basic beers like Bud & Coors etc.  Service was great . We were a party of 6 and we put our waiter to the test. He came through with flying colors!!! I recommend the Jambalya!!!"

LadyL F.,"Nanuet, NY",0,5,,5.0,5/11/2015,"Had lunch with my boyfriend there on 5/7/15 it was our first time. Great atmosphere the place is nice, and our waitress was very pleasant! The menu had a lot of variety, drinks were great, and at one point the Manager Stanley came over to say hello and suggested a few options. He was friendly, and went above to meet our needs! Will definitely return!!"
Eileen M.,"Valley Cottage, NY",0,2,,5.0,5/5/2015,"This is my third time at BJ's by and I enjoyed it yet again. The service is very good and the food is also great. The manager Stanley even came around to our table and asked us how the food and service was, very rarely have I seen this in other restaurants. I definitely will be returning for the delicious food and wonderful service!"
Alexa T.,"Pomona, NY",0,2,,5.0,2/21/2015,"I love this place!! I went with some friends during opening week and I loved the food. I have gone twice so far. First time I ordered the the Bjs Brewhouse Burger it was juicy and really delicious, I especially loved the crispy thin fries. The second time I ordered the avocado rolls they were nice and crispy and I loved the dipping sauce. I really like the atmosphere great for upcoming sports events since they have tv's all over the restaurant."
Tomas S.,"Manhattan, NY",9,141,13,1.0,3/31/2015,bad food. horrible service. food was served almost raw. chicken sandwich with only one piece of chicken. took an hour for food to arrive.  unresponsive staff. don't eat here. a total zero. Stanley the restaurant manager laughed at us when we complained. shame on him. he should be fired and this restaurant should be avoided.
Corinne A.,"West Nyack, NY",0,12,,2.0,10/11/2015,"This place started out awesome. I went there with my family, and got acceptable service and good food. I was so excited to bring my boyfriend here, cause I figured he'd love it. First time we went was just as good as when I went with my family. From there, it has gone completely downhill. Between being ignored for 15 minutes, my food coming out later than his, and being promised a visit from a manager that never came over, I'm pretty over this place. Just because we look young, I don't think it's acceptable that we have had to wait so long to be greeted at our table, we were on the verge of leaving. And the only reason we stayed is because a waiter recognized we were getting mad, and came over to take our drink order. And let me point out: he wasn't even our waiter, he just felt bad. After all this, I sent an email to their company, and never got a response. It's kind of shame to be honest, I had high hopes for this place."
