Annetta R.,"Mount Vernon, NY",0,59,55,3.0,5/30/2017,I went to this restaurant on the recommendation of a friend. When I heard BJ's I thought they were talking about the warehouse. I ordered the jalapeño burger which was delicious. I also downloaded the app as instructed by the hostess to receive the free Poozookie dessert it was delicious as well. My friends ordered Salmon and Jambalaya which they enjoyed. All in all I would recommend this restaurant and I will definitely go back again.
S S.,"New City, NY",0,1,,1.0,10/21/2017,We waited 45 minutes and the girl that she couldn't find my name in the computer . She continued to seat people although she said we were next. The meal was awful . My prime rib dip had almost no meat on it and had fat on it . My friends pulled pork dip was crispy and hard to eat    My mashed potatoes were like concrete.  For 45 dollars I could have gone to a better restaurant. Very disappointed.
Elizabeth C.,"Hawthorne, NJ",18,6,4,1.0,3/12/2017,I am here At the Resturant made a reservation at 4:50 and it is 6:30 and we are yet to be seated I understand we are a party of 15 but they said are table would be ready at 6. Should not give a estimate that is by far inaccurate. They have 15 of us standing in the way! I am also with a child and a pregnant mother! They have not offer a chair. The food is good but the service not so much.
Matt W.,"New City, NY",0,18,,1.0,9/11/2017,Just a truly terrible experience. Came here on a Saturday night and after a short wait we ordered wings as an app. They came out ice cold. Server said hot ones would be right out and that took about 25 minutes. Onto the main course...I had a sandwich with a baked potato. Potato was cold too. My dad ordered a burger with all the toppings on the side and they forgot all the toppings and that again took forever to be given. Food was not very good either. I contacted the restaurant from their website and never heard back.
Service S.,"Cliffside Park, NJ",0,26,13,5.0,8/19/2016,It not that good in the beginning from the front desk service organize but the waiter solved the problem.  I gave the food 3.5 but the waiter made it all great.. You got five from us...Sam the man:)
Maureen S.,"Thiells, NY",2,5,2,3.0,5/7/2017,"Went to BJ's Friday for cinco de mayo with my husband. The place was busy but we got a seat at the bar almost right away. The bartender was friendly and we had our drinks pretty quickly. We decided to have the mahi tacos. I was very disappointed in them. There was very little flavor. Between the fish, and everything thing on them I can't believe how little flavor there was. Thank god for the salsa on the plate or it would have been a total loss. I've had other dishes there that I love but I recommend staying clear of the mahi tacos."
Bryan N.,"Delray Beach, FL",0,8,6,1.0,3/26/2017,"Now that I've been to BJ's  seven times and have  tried  a variety of the menu items.  1.Decor excellent  great layout and plenty of TVs. BUT the Food is not good.  You ask why did I keep going The answer is that the service is fantastic the people working there are friendly and fun,so I kept trying to find that  signature dish to rely on.  But no  Luck. My advise drink the beer enjoy their home made sodas, watched the games and enjoy the crowds and chat with the friendly staff."
Jennifer L.,"Peekskill, NY",768,555,818,2.0,1/7/2017,"What a disaster. I really wanted to like this place but the service was god awful and the food was mediocre at best. We called in advance to place our name on the waitlist (this was the best part of our visit - service wise). We were seated within 10 minutes. Our waiter came over right away to take our drink order, the kids order and I placed an app order (fried calamari). For my kids I ordered spaghetti and rice (yes rice, my daughter has strange eating habits.. don't ask..) and Mac n Cheese with fries for my son. When or drinks arrived we placed our order - pulled pork sandwich for me and some chicken entree for my hubby... here's where the disaster began. Our calamari came out after a good 15 minutes along with my daughter's spaghetti... then the server went back to get her rice and my son's fries... but no mac n cheese.... so my son tried the calamari Bc he was starving and lucky for us liked it. Mean while I kept trying to find my waiter to see what was going on with the Mac n cheese but he was busy and acting frantic but never turned his head to look our way... after a good 8-10 minutes of my kid eating French fries and calamari (which btw was not good... tasted like rubber bands..) finally our waiter was standing at the register when I had to basically scream EXCUSE ME to get his attention. I asked him where's he mac n cheese and his response was ""oh there're probably still working on it..."" wrong answer guy... so he went to the back and came right back out with it... it was sitting there. Not hot, but warm - warm was fine with me Bc he doesn't like it hot. Now our food comes out. I was expecting typical shredded pulled pork... it was chunks of pork with fatty pieces. It was supposed to come topped with frizzled onions but had none but Bc I couldn't find my server I didn't say anything. I didn't enjoy it though I ate it. Now I drank my whole cup of soda and needed a refill. Once again our waiter was no where to be found. Then when he appeared he was on the opposite side of the restaurant staring off into space. I literally waved him down to get a refill. He apologized and told us he had a table of kids that pulled a diner dash... sucks, but get yourself together and serve the rest of your customers who would probably be willing to give you a good tip had you been a good waiter!!! Maybe they didn't pay Bc you suck!! We ordered the kids ice cream sundaes Bc they wanted one and hubs n i split their cookie/brownie trio  dessert. That was very good. We had cookies n cream, salted caramel and double chocolate. Also had a cup of coffee which was surprisingly delicious. I'd probably give this place another shot with hopes of not getting the same waiter."
Itzel A.,"White Plains, NY",33,133,525,3.0,1/6/2017,This place is cool mainly Bc they brew their own beer. Now how they got the name bjs even allowed with what is known to us as bjs is a wholesale club. Now the bartenders are extremely friendly and helpful. The lack of stars is for the menu. It's similar to a Friday's or a food chain. The happy hour is ok nothing special they take $1 off beer and $2 off appys so you are not really getting a bargain. Parking is not a problem and the food timing was not a dwell. Although the food tastes frozen I hate when I order a chicken breast and it taste frozen not fresh off the grill. But I would recommend and I would visit again.
Caroline M.,"Monsey, NY",0,7,,5.0,4/30/2017,"This is my favorite place to go! The meals always come out great; no matter what ive gotten, clean, cheap (unless youre getting the alaskian caught salmon or the occasional steak), friendly, and always well taken care of. They have a variety of drinks (alcoholic and/or non-alcoholic), and a large variety of food. They also offer lower calorie dishes as well for anyone whos being careful."
Nick C.,"Ridgefield Park, NJ",325,963,1662,3.0,3/11/2015,"Pretty good for a chain restaurant, but for a brewhouse, their beers aren't very good. Came for lunch on a Saturday and it was pretty busy. The place is nice and there are plenty of TVs. Service was pretty good, very attentive. I had the lemon thyme chicken served with brown rice and veggies. The chicken was very tender, I didn't need a knife. The entire dish was flavorful and obviously tasted of lemon and thyme. A bit expensive at near $15 though. I wouldn't mind returning."
Nick N.,"Hackensack, NJ",0,36,,1.0,8/23/2017,"Having been a regular at BJ's new place in Teterbpro, NJ we though it safe to stop in at BJ's in Nanuet Saturday. Like comparing apples and oranges. The place in Teterboro is headamd shoulders above this place  in food and service. Same menu but hardly the quality or presentation I have come to expect and always get in Teterboro. They ought to send the magager from that place up to Nanuet to straighten it out...."
Gerardo Karen P.,"Greenwich Village, Manhattan, NY",9,5,,1.0,11/10/2016,"Terrible service!! Food mediocre but the beer is good!! Do yourself a favor and better go to the Palisades Mall Yard House!! Waiters are young fellows that don't know anything about the drinks they offer (obviously they are above 21 yrs).., I live in Rockland county and I know very well the clientele and the neighborhood is not the most sophisticated.. but the service here is ""piece of crap"" rude, pushing! Never go back to this horrendous bar!!"
Jordyn B.,"Pearl River, NY",199,11,2,1.0,6/24/2016,Horrible food. Chicken came out pink and rubbery. AMAZING service. Too bad the food isn't as good as the service or I would be a regular!
Angelo O.,"Ramsey, NJ",0,23,,4.0,6/4/2016,"The food was excellent. The root beer glaze over the ribs was ridiculously good. The fries were good..but a little too thin, lets beef those boys up a notch. Our server ""Zack"", was awesome. Hooked him up w 20%+ for sure. The bathrooms however, well let's just say, bring your napkins from the table, bc they're out of toilet paper in the ladies room..'during dinner'..how is this possible?  The men's room, not so bad, I mean we're dudes takin a piss, but the hand napkins were all over the damn floor overflowing the garbage. Pull it together cleaning staff!  Other than that, not bad, will go again. Oh yeah, clean the damn menus, mine had food inside of the menu. Yes. Food stuck. Inside the menu. Seriously?  Should prob chuck this joint 3-stars, but Zack saved the day. Promote Zack."
Phyllis K.,"Waldwick, NJ",9,2,,2.0,5/11/2016,"Brought 4 hungry teenagers for a birthday dinner on a Wednesday evening. Wasn't impressed at all. Extensive menu but most of what we ordered was disappointing. Tried a $20 appetizer sampler and the best part of it was the boneless chicken wings. Mozzarella sticks with a sauce that resembled and tasted like tomato paste from a can, an over cooked and tiny dish of spinach dip and mini avocado egg rolls that tasted ""off"".  Main dishes were all lukewarm-cold when they came. Best part of the meal was dessert but wouldn't come again. Kudos for the free soda refills (4 teenagers drink lots of soda) but not for much else."
Aaron C.,"Fort Lee, NJ",118,13,2,4.0,7/4/2017,"Bjs Brewhouse has always been a place that has good food and good vibe.  It is located at the Nanuet shopping complex and has easy access to parking.  The menu consists of various of items.  I love their deep dish pizza.  A small is actually filling for me (6 slices).  The slices are humongous and you can choose a lot of options.  Their ribs are pretty good as well.  The meat easily comes off the bone and it is served with 2 signature sides.  The half rack is $18 and a full rack is $22.  I would recommend always getting the full rack to get your moneys worth.  The sides I usually get are either their fries, rice pilaf, sprussel sprouts and I've recently tried their couscous mac n cheese and it was really good.  It was gooey and filled with tomato, cheese, and bacon. Of course, their desserts is a must have which is their pizookies.  My go to choice is white macadamia nut pizookie with vanilla ice cream on top.  It is always served hot so the ice cream is soft and melts in your mouth.  I'm not a beer drinker but they have tons of beer options, hence the name.  Price is very reasonable ($10-$18) and the portions are enough where you become full.  The only thing I would not recommend is eating their on a holiday.  I went there for father's day and the service was lousy.  We reserved a table beforehand and when we got there, they gave the table to someone else because we never responded to the text saying we were here even though they never told us to respond to a text message saying we were there.  So we had to wait an additional 45 minutes just to be seated.  While people kept walking in and getting seated, we were literally the last ones.  The host didn't know what she was doing and didn't communicate properly to us."
Paul F.,"Park Ridge, NJ",11,30,1,1.0,3/28/2017,"What a complete disaster. Service was horrible and no one seemed to care. My wife had finished her first drink before I had even got mine. There was some confusion at the bar with several beer choices not available, so after trying a couple of samples i ordered a drink. Guess what? The wrong beer came and the server could see we were unhappy. Instead of trying to resolve the issue she turned on her heels and disappeared only reappearing once the food was brought out. Now, onto the food. The sandwich was OK but i have never seen such an abysmal plate of boneless wings in all my life. I honestly believe that I was the third or fourth table to see that sorry plate. Either that or they had been sat under a heat lamp for 20 minutes. They were dry husks and the sauce had been baked in to them to the point that there was not an ounce of moisture left in sight. Horrible and i doubt if I will return."
Christina D.,"Nanuet, NY",81,8,,5.0,5/10/2016,"Extremely disappointed. Just had to walk out after waiting 15 minutes for someone to acknowledge us. We were seated promptly provided a high chair for our 15th month old son. No one came over to give us place settings or take our order.  Other tables were seated after us were given water, place settings and acknowledged.  Employees lingered around and passed right by our table. We finally gave up and left. We are also rewards members and have been dining here since they grand opened. After I posted the review management contacted me to apologize for the lack of service. We have gone there in the past and never had an issue. All of our other dining experiences have been great. Service at the bar is always spot on. They have a great outdoor seating area as well."
Nicole A.,"West Nyack, NY",31,4,3,1.0,3/19/2016,"Terrible experience Thursday night. My coworker and myself ordered take out .. Deep dish ravioli with NO pepperoni. Low and behold there was pepperoni through out the entire dish. I called and spoke to a manager. He kindly offered me a new order and to deliver it to my job! When I opened the new order it was baked ziti ... -_-  We also ordered the trio of ""pizookies"" which were basically cookies in a tin. I'm still trying to figure out what the ""piz"" stands for ..  Overall a very disappointing experience !"
