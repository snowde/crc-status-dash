Brian O.,"Bronxville, NY",0,18,4,4.0,9/16/2016,"Very good selection of their own brews. The food was very good - I had the jumbalaya and loved it. My wife had a nice ribeye. We shared an appy of root beer glazed ribs - YUM! Service was very good, hostess and waitress very nice and attentive. Atmosphere ok. Just a real big room witj high ceilings and a lot of TV's with the Yankees (boo) and (Let's  Go) Mets on."
NY Yelper Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",97,3,1,5.0,1/11/2017,Love this place!! Fast service and the food is AMAZING!! My favorite drink is the Sour Patch!
G M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,408,722,3.0,11/20/2016,"I have been going to BJ's for decades. Originally a pizza chain, but its morphed into something of a sports bar too. The climate is California-trendy, there are multiple screens showing different games, music playing, and its loud and hard to talk. We went on a Saturday night and there was a 45 minute wait. As for the food, it doesn't seem to be as good as the original California BJ's. We had the exact same dishes 6 months ago in Huntington Beach - flatbread margherita pizza, and salmon with quinoa, and both of them were a notch less good in this location. The quinoa was salty and slightly bitter and too wet. The flatbread pizza was kind of bland. We didn't try one of the main large pizzas."
Natalia S.,"New City, NY",0,2,,1.0,4/10/2017,"I have never seen such a show at a restaurant in all my years. So much so that I made a yelp account specifically for the review !! My friends and I sat  at a high top table in the bar and a few minutes later the manager came over and gave us menus. She told us about the pizza special which I was excited about and what we had came for and insisted we try the blonde beer as we first requested bud lights. ( It's our new favorite !) Our server was Megan , although she seemed to be a nice girl our service was horrible. We waited forever for our food which was ice cold , and waited at least 15 minutes for our drinks each time we ordered a round. My food came out 20 minutes after everyone else's and was a hockey puck that I requested to be medium rare. After our server disappeared again I got up and asked Nicole who was standing at the bar to come to the table. After we explained what was happening , she expressed her apologies and assured us this was not a regular occurrence. At this point I didn't want any more food or drinks and I just wanted to get out as fast as I could. She ended up discounting our check which we appreciated very much. Even our exit was rudely interrupted by the bartender screaming ""LAST CALL!!!"" like we were in some packed college bar. What is going on BJs ????  Somehow, Nicole managed to convinced us to give BJs another chance but we'll be very cautious and will make sure she is there when (if) we come back."
Nikki J.,"Mount Ivy, NY",122,15,4,4.0,1/6/2017,"So pleased with my visit tonight. Our server Kevin was amazing, always had on a smile and made sure that we were doing okay. He recommended great stuff and seemed to know the menu front and back. He was extremely patient with me because I couldn't seem to make up my mind! The mushrooms stuffed with spinach and feta was delicious along with the bone-in wings and fried asparagus. For my main meal I got the cherry chipotle salmon and my boyfriend got the full rack of ribs (literally fall of the bone ribs). I will definitely be coming in again! Thanks Kevin for an enjoyable visit :)"
Elizabeth S.,"Kailua, HI",0,4,,5.0,12/11/2016,GREAT FOOD!  Love the portions and the quality.  They have a complimentary kids starter (friut and garlic knot).  Craft beer has a good variety as well!!!  Will go again soon!
Harry P.,"Mahwah, NJ",217,531,636,3.0,3/5/2015,"This is a solid spot, I would give it a better review if it did not take hours to get my food. But when I did get the food, it was very good. I had the California burger with avocado, bacon and a really good spicy sauce along with fresh hot peppers on it. The flavor was there and the burger was cooked perfectly. The bread it was served on was great, and added a nice crispy buttery aspect to the burger. They brew their own beer but I was not so impressed with. I had the Piranha® Pale Ale that supposedly is brewed with cascade hops but lacked that fruit flavor you normally get from cascade hops. I would go back to try the pizza that looked very good."
Kimberly D.,"Yorktown Heights, NY",59,326,1266,3.0,8/13/2015,"Wasn't wowed.  My salad was fine, my husband ordered a burger that was pretty good. Nothing special."
Orlando A.,"Hazleton, PA",0,10,6,4.0,2/3/2015,"I give 4 starts because the restaurant looks great ! The food was excellent, I went during the pre opening and I was impressed by the food.. I had the pork chops with mash potatoes and a tortilla soup. -- the pork was cooked perfectly and seasoned well. The mash potatoes was one of the best I had as well as the soup. I like how they pour the soup in front of you from a stainless steel cup.  My second guest had a flat bread which was great. Perfectly crispy and had great taste.  My third guest had burger sliders which were well done -- had good taste and had the fixings on the side so you could build it the way you like --- the desert which we shared was some kind of pecan which ice cream on top served in a skillet. We finished that in no time, fighting over pieces.  Now for the bad -- service really needs help. I understand it's a new place but the service was horrible. Staff knew almost nothing that was going on, what was on the menu. The person helping the trainee was excellent he said he comes from a bj's in Columbus Ohio. Need more staff like him. A young lady in guessing was the manager was going table to table. Came to our table and didn't ask how our meal or food was but asked ""is all you good"" (the look on everyone face at my table was priceless) -- not what a manager should be asking. She should have ask very specifically about our experience and/or the food"
Steve P.,"Irvington, NY",14,140,6,4.0,10/24/2016,"Not sure why some of the lower ratings here. BJ's is part of a strip mall in Nanuet, sharing space with a P.F. Chang's. a pretty large Friday's style sports bar with a neat outdoor space featuring a grill pit (for warmth on this cold night) bright and lively inside with large screens for sports events, a full bar and tons of large, comfy booths. Service was excellent and a very wide food selection. Had the lie cal spicy chicken with rice and beans which was plain but delicious with a tomato sauce. Wife had a bacon cheeseburger with skinny frites which was excellent. Best cup of coffee I've had in a long while. Very satisfying meal and I'll be sure to return."
Kris A.,"Nanuet, NY",56,56,51,4.0,2/3/2016,"Wanted to give BJ'a another try since I wasn't impressed last time. We were greeted right away by the host and he was really nice, making us feel very welcomed. Although it was around lunch time the place was kinda quiet. I ordered the grilled chicken Caesar salad and my boyfriend got a bacon cheese burger with fries. The salad was delicious. Very fresh and the grilled chicken was juicy, which is sometimes hard to get at other places. My boyfriends burger was really good too. It was juicy and flavorful. The fries were also excellent as well.  We will defiantly be back!"
Josh C.,"Charlotte, NC",155,2,,5.0,12/11/2016,"I tried BJs out when I was traveling for business for a few days. The food looked so good that I had to come back multiple times throughout my stay to try several things. I hardly ever go to the same place twice in my travels, but in 2 weeks I have been here 5 times! The bar staff is also great! Lou and Ericka served me a few times and even remembered me. I would highly suggest trying the spinach stuffed mushrooms and salmon quinoa bowl. Those were my 2 favorites, but everything I tried was great. The only negative I could find were the menus could use a cleaning as they smelled a bit foul. If that's the only negative I could come up with then that's great."
Ashley A.,"Westwood, NJ",117,192,440,2.0,7/31/2016,"Well, after a few trips to BJ's Brewhouse I've come to the conclusion that although the food is good, service just doesn't match up. My last visit was a disaster. We chose BJ's to kickstart our vacation thinking we'd have a great meal and a fun time. It was anything but that. Our waitress was very condescending to my Fiancée basically telling him to ""shut up"". Here's how it started. We were originally seated by a different waitress. We told her we wanted to pay with the bjs online app and that we were members. She took down the info and put our drink orders in. A little bit later a different waitress returned and said she would be taking over. Since the message wasn't relayed to her that we were going to be paying with the bjs app, we reminded her and she took down the info. We, all three of us places our orders. Nothing complicated. I got the veggie deep dish pizza, fiancé jambalaya and brother baked ziti. About 20 mins later the ziti and jambalaya comes out and she says ""it'll just be a couple of mins sweetie"" to me, and btw I'm like twice her age so sweetie seemed weird to me lol. Anyways, long story short another 20 mins go by and finally she brings out the pizza, but it's got ham all over it so clearly it's not correct. I said that and she's like ""are you sure?"" And checked her pad, I was like ""yes I'm sure, I k ow what I ordered and I don't eat ham"" so, no apologies, just takes the pizza away and says I'll have him make you a new one it'll just take a couple mins. So she comes out like 10 mins later and the pizza is correct but it's ice cold, as if it's been sitting for a while. I just asked her to wrap it up and I'll take it home and microwave it and eat it there. She insists that I should order a new one free of charge cause she wants me to be satisfied. At that point we were all tired and just wanted to go home. It wasn't a good experience so my fiancé said ""no, well just take it home"" and she said to him "" I'm talking to her, can she speak? You enjoyed your food so let her make up her own mind"" I was shocked. At that point I just said ok, make a new one. More to keep the peace and just so she would stop insisting and let us be. My fiancé was so upset. He didn't say a word after that. I felt so bad. He's been in the waitering buisness himself and was appalled at how she acted. So we waited about another 10 min, my fiancé didn't finish his food and when the pizza came out, again it was cold. But I didn't say anything because I just wanted to go. I forced myself to eat one slice ""lost my appetite at that point"" and then asked for it to be wrapped. When we tried to pay online we could see that out order was never applied to the app, and she handed us a check. So , for the third time we explained that we wanted to pay online through the bjs app and she acted as if it was the first time she heard this. In the end she gave us the pizza free and 20% off the bill, but after this experience we have decided we will not be going back. Every time we go there's a blunder, and although we get compensated for it in the end it would be nice to be able to go and just have a drama free experience."
Adam C.,"Wallkill, NY",1,2,1,5.0,5/13/2017,Great food and good service. Calamari is good. A lot of great beers as well. My girlfriend got the berry cider and it tasted very good. Recommend coming here
Angela P.,"Keansburg, NJ",10,27,32,4.0,12/20/2015,Discovered this place a few months and now I stop in every time I am in the area. They have a great menu that gets updated regularly and I can always find unexpected appetizers and interesting drinks. The brisket burger here is the BEST burger I have ever eaten in my life- so much flavor!! They are also one of the few places that cook a good RARE burger correctly.  Good service. I don't drink- but they seem to have a good select cool of beers and speciality drinks.  The only drawback to this place is the parking is awful. A lot of restaurants and a mall with little to no parking. If you plan on visiting on a night or weekend- be prepared to circle the lot multiple times.
Shira A.,"Ellicott City, MD",20,15,2,5.0,8/15/2016,"Food was excellent and service was good too. The manager saw we hadn't been helped, came over and apologized, took our drink order and even our food because we were ready quickly. We were actually driving home from NY to Maryland and we were just looking for something not super fancy but not fast food and this was perfect :-) I had the meat lovers Piorini (sp?) and my husband had a burger which he said was cooked perfectly. Highly recommend"
Tink M.,"Elmwood Park, NJ",0,5,,1.0,7/1/2016,"Horrible experience. They put the pizza up on high trays but don't cut all the way through the crust. My mother tried to reach up and get a piece out, the tray slipped off and knocked over and broke her martini. The staff cleaned it up and said "" we'll bring you another drink"" THEN charged us for the second drink! Really poor practice. We'll never return."
Angie K.,"New York, NY",0,21,1,4.0,4/30/2017,"Been here a couple of times. It was very good and the servers and quite attentive. Highly recommend the salmon quinoa and the salads. Everything is pretty good , very well seasoned (maybe a tad too much e.g. my husband's Cajun pasta)."
Lorraine B.,"Nanuet, NY",5,49,34,5.0,12/18/2015,I love this place! We tried the Mediterranean chicken taco and it's amazing as is the the roasted brussel sprouts kale salad! Coming here is fun and brightens the day. The staff is welcoming and efficient; the food is great; amazing drinks so what else do you need?? The menu changes periodically and the classics are always present. Way to go
Barbara B.,"Pearl River, NY",0,4,1,5.0,11/12/2016,This is one of the best places  to eat in Rockland... always great food wonderful wait staff and a very upbeat and fun place... very clean and the best beers....
