Sheera H.,"Inwood, Manhattan, NY",2,8,8,3.0,7/3/2015,Food was amazing however the server could have been a lot better. Our server was very bland & seemed very distracted. We barely exchanged in a conversation... I felt a weird vibe.  I had the BJ brewhouse Burger & it was scrumptious my boyfriend had the Mahi Mahi with shrimp & it was on point. Overall it was great we had a good time.
Lisa M.,"Rockland County, NY",235,100,356,4.0,12/29/2015,"I visited with a few friends about two days and let's just say.. I'll definitely be coming back. The setting is very nice and casual and our waitress was great! If you don't like crowded places, don't go on a Saturday night. The bar was very full (and maybe there was one asshole who just wouldn't let me use a chair for our table). Overall, great experience!"
Ashley S.,"Nanuet, NY",217,15,74,3.0,9/24/2015,"I enjoy coming here to eat and drink at the bar or outside, but the rest of the restaurant is a mess in my opinion. They have great happy hour specials, occasional special beer dinners, and all of their ""house"" beers are really yummy. All of the food I've tried here has been really delicious. From the honey sriracha brussel sprouts to the brisket bacon burger. My favorite house beer has to be their Nutty Brewnette. The bar area is super nice although there are not many seats. The outdoor area is also really nice but with limited seating.  The wait to eat can be very long but if you download their app you can put your name on the wait list before you even get there. I highly encourage doing so. The bar service has been pretty good each time I went but the food can take a long time to come out.  My biggest complaints are for the lobby service and take out service. Sometimes there is only one person at the front desk and they have to take each group to a table then come back and help the next. This can take a while considering the size of this place and they should have 2 people up there during peak hours. TAKE OUT ANNOYANCE: Today I picked up lunch. I ordered and paid for one of their lunch specials online. It was the half flatbread pizza with a salad for $7.75. I got there on time. The woman at the take out desk hands me the pizza. I said ""Doesn't this come with a salad?"" She had no clue. I had to take out my phone and pull up the confirmation email to prove to her that it does come with a salad. So then I waited about 5 minutes to bring out the very simple salad. She asked me if I wanted dressing even though it's supposed to come with it. Finally I have everything I paid for. Then she begins to tell me what I owe. I tell her that I already paid online. Again, I have to pull up my receipt confirmation email and show her this. She didn't even say anything after I show her so I just ask ""Are we done here?"" and she replies ""Yes"". And I'm out the door. I get home and the pizza is cold so I have to microwave it. GREAT It's safe to say that I'm going to wait a very long time before I even consider ordering for take out here again. The managers here really need to do some more training because some of these employees don't even know their own menu. A simple 2 minute process took about 10 minutes. I'll just stick to eating at the bar."
Steve M.,"Nanuet, NY",11,52,33,1.0,8/23/2015,"Abysmal. The food WAS good enough to get them back to two stars, but this ""okay, I'll give them one more chance"" trip proved even the food is not consistant. Service was lazy, uneducated, wrong, haphazard, slow, surly, and ultimately ineffective. This is a BEER place, and you have to ask if something advertised at the front door on a giant poster is still on tap??   And when you ""go check"",  you forget my companions order?  And then when you finally get the beer that I wanted, you forget my companion's order AGAIN? ""Crispy Calamari"" wasn't even half right.  Terribly under cooked, soggy, greasy and disgusting, I can assume it actually squid... but the texture suggested oily dishrags. The Ahi Poke appetizer was tasty, but a miniscule quantity for such little tuna that was barely sushi grade. Her steak was okay, but the brussel sprouts were overcooked and dead. My New Orleans jambalaya was greasy with overdone andoulie sausage. But the CARDINAL sin (in my eyes) was the 35 minute wait for a beer.  I was about to pull a ""Gina""  [that's when you call the establishment, from your table, politely ask for the manager on duty, and then politely ask for somebody to service your table]  but miss attitude finally stopped by (I already asked for another beer from the kitchen carry out guy and a busboy) and my companion says ""Can he get another beer?"" Which should have been a hint.  But no.  It took another 20 minutes with a ""your beer is almost ready""... WTF?  Was it final lagering?  Were they dry-hopping to order?? Not to mention the beers here are mediocre at best.  If you want to dip your toe in craft beer, you might start here.  If you want something other than pretend chain-commercial shite, go elsewhere.  Besides, the service sucks beyond reality. Sucks!"
Jess T.,"Yonkers, NY",0,8,1,5.0,3/28/2017,"Delicious food, great service! Had the broccoli cheddar bread bowl which was amazing! The ribs were outta this world! And omg the desserts! Def going to come back!"
Lisa S.,"New City, NY",43,38,17,5.0,9/6/2015,"We went for dinner on a Saturday night and have absolutely no complaints. Got there about 8:15 p.m. and were sat right away because they had a two-seat booth available. Waiter was friendly and efficient. Hubby loved that Pilsner Urquell was on tap, and I got the house hard cider which had hints of raspberry herbal tea in a very good way. We got one small plate, the stuffed mushrooms, which were excellent, and hubby loved his jambalaya. I got the ribs and, while they weren't the best ribs I've ever had, they were good enough. Portion sizes were good without being grotesque, and the bill at the end of it was not shabby for two entrees, a small plate, and two drinks.  And best of all we made our movie!"
Adam H.,"Suffern, NY",80,38,2,2.0,6/1/2016,Overpriced pub fare menu and mediocre beers - disappointed.
Frank M.,"Westwood, NJ",94,109,2,5.0,7/2/2015,"THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU for bringing this to the East Coast!  I'm originally from California and used to love visiting these back home.  I've got one word for you... Pazookie!  That alone will keep bringing me back. Pizza is great, service is great and friendly, and the beer selection is on point.  Not to mention I love their own brewed craft beers.  I was sad to see they didn't brew them onsite like they do at some of their other locations but hey... it's all the same. Pro tip... download their app and check in prior to arriving so that you don't have to wait as long to be sat, especially if you have a large group (6 or more people) because this place doesn't have much in the way of space for large parties."
Maria J.,"New City, NY",68,5,,5.0,7/29/2016,"Love BJ Brewhouse!  The service is great, the food is great and I love how they cater to children. This is definitely a new favorite place for my family. The drinks list looks impressive; next trip... The bar!  Looking forwarding to retuning soon."
Bianca W.,"Rockland County, NY",6,18,1,5.0,7/9/2016,Their food is great! Nice restaurant and atmosphere.  Prices are reasonable. Drinks are great! I love the outdoor seating. This is a great addition to the area.
June F.,"Rockford, IL",0,31,24,5.0,2/12/2016,Wonderful as always... Sweet Sin Chocolate Ale was perfect for Valentines weekend . Server was great and drinks  and food came out fast!
Shirley S.,"Mahwah, NJ",6,25,1,2.0,6/17/2015,Food was good BUT you don't serve your main entree first & then I had to inform them we order a flatbread appetizer also.  So they bring the appetizer out & now we are eating the appetizer & entree at the same time!   Who does that???  Now we are shoving the food at the same time!  No apologies from the wait service for bringing everything out at the same time!  Not professional at all!   My husband beer( Indian Pale Ale) was so so!   Waste of time to go there!
C F.,"Ridgewood, NJ",1,23,15,3.0,1/3/2017,I went there with a few co workers. The drinks were good. The appetizers platter was good but little pricey. The wait time in crazy but yet they have more tables in the back with nobody sitting there. I don't know why it was like that .
Jaime D.,"Nanuet, NY",1,4,1,1.0,4/29/2015,"Can I give zero stars?! Awful food. Corporate money was spent on a very cool space. Nothing else positive to say except that Zinbergers is right around the corner! What a bummer Bj's. If I were a dude, I wouldn't want one from you!"
Anthony K.,"Englewood Cliffs, NJ",8,25,,2.0,10/29/2015,"I walked in hear thinking it to be a similar experience to Heartland Brewery locations in Manhattan and I was incorrect. They get 2 stars for having unique beers that I've not tried before as it is their in house brand.  I've been here twice, apps and deep dish pizza and nothing about my food wow-ed me but more disappointing the buffalo chicken pizza was so salty that I thought my tongue was going to quit on me. Perhaps it's a way to get more drinks served... ""these pretzels are makin' me thirsty""  In any case, it's a large place with plenty of seating and many options so while it has value in a mall setting I wouldn't go back any time soon if I have other options."
Christian M.,"New City, NY",0,1,,1.0,11/21/2016,"HORRIBLE!! The horrible expierence started when i walked in the door. Waited at the door for 10 minuets for a host to come over and seat us - went on a weeknight not a weekend.: the place was not busy When finally seated, waiting 20 minuets for our server (megan) to come over and get our drinks. We asked to order our drinks and food together since we were so annoyed from waiting for so long- her response was ""ill put in your drinks and be right back to take your order..""  15 minuets later we finally got our drinks.. she never came back to take our order in that time. Instead she decided to talk to her co workers and use her cell phone on the floor. Finally we put our order in..  I got the brussel spouts; she brought them out and i noticed a hair in my food. I knew it wasnt mine because it was long and hair and my hair is short and blonde. Then i notice our server had her hair down and not tied back.. i told her about the hair and she insisted it was mine and not hers. When i asked to speak to the manager she told me that the manager had stepped out and wouldnt be back for a while. Then i asked who i could speak to about my horrible expierence there and she said her. This place is unprofessional and gross. Servers need to tie there hair up. If you do go there prepare to be there half a day and make sure you dont get megan as a server. I will not be back."
Gary B.,"Lancaster, NY",1,107,,3.0,6/27/2016,Not a fan of brew houses and craft beers so probably shouldnt be here but myself and 5 others had to get away from my daughters baby shower and this place was the destination. I dont care for the hugeness but because was a sunday lunch and not crowded at all. Our waitress was very good and attentive and we appreciated how she would bring second round of drinks without asking and that was just fine. She checked on us and was very good with any explanations. The menu weighed about 5 pounds! As for the food - the bacon cheeseburgers were excellent and cooked as requested -was pretty large with plenty of delicious bacon and cheese. The taste was one of the best around. The plate though was overloaded with skinny fries that were all over the place- they were not very tasty but sure were crunch and I stated skinny and long. There was an order of short ribs that 2 split and they it was huge and tasted good and were devoured. The last order was for the shrimp tacos also noted as tasting good but to me looked disappointing as the shrimp were small (makes sense small shrimp- but NOT really) and could have been larger and there were 2. The warm pizookie- a chocolate chip cookie with ice cream deserts were enjoyed by those that got them. But overall the food was very good but the ambiance of the place is like a huge warehouse- its reputation though is for mobbed weekend nights so somethings going well here. But for me its A-ok and a place I would not intend on going back to again- thats just me and the way I feel about these craft beer places anyway.
Sherri O.,"Westwood, NJ",0,48,3,2.0,12/11/2015,Used the app to call ahead and order ahead.  No help.  Still waited and waited and food wasn't ready  Food ok not great - ok if you don't have to wait but not worth this wait.  Not coming back
Elizabeth B.,"Nyack, NY",851,31,9,2.0,10/1/2015,"We were excited to see this restaurant open at the new Nanuet Shops Mall and were looking forward to try it.  The first time we went the hostess was less than friendly and actually handed us the menus and pointed to the table where we should sit.  My husband was underwhelmed by the selection of beer. You can find better and more interesting selections at establishments close by. Service was friendly and you could tell each of the servers were wanting to do what they could to make us happy. Food came came out after a 45 minute wait on our first visit in a half full restaurant. And then on our second visit the food came out in ten min in a fairly empty restaurant.  The food was ok. The Chicken Club sandwich was ok, a little greasy.  The pulled pork sandwich was pretty good. Off the kids menu my daughter had the pizza. It was a reheated frozen Boboli looking thing. It was gross and she didn't touch it.  Overall, its not worth a special trip and now I know what to expect should I find myself there again."
Patrick L.,"Nyack, NY",4,47,41,1.0,3/30/2015,"Been wanting to try since they opened so I took my wife and two of my kids for lunch on a Sunday afternoon.  Really wasn't impressed at all. Simple design to the restaurant.  TV's everywhere.  But if you're going to use kegs of beer as part of the decor, you'd think that you would at least clean them. Hostesses seemed like they didn't want to be there and had no personality at the front desk or while walking to the table.  Not sure if is something they were told to do, or do it on their own, but the hostesses walk to the table at an uncomfortably slow pace.  Watched them do this with many tables. Waitress seemed pleasant enough.  Way too much jewelry on to be waiting on tables.  Menu knowledge needs some work as she needed my wife to hold up the menu while she read the description to see if the kids meal came with a side item. Place was full, but not crazy.   25 minutes from ordering to food hitting the table. Ordered two basic burgers.  One medium, one medium well.  Food runner came out, and when I asked which one was medium, she smiled and said 'they're both medium well'  with a smile, dropped them, and left without questioning the mistake.  Burgers were much more suited for a drunken 1am binge...heavy and greasy...buns were grilled in butter... California club was tasty, but became unappealing upon a short curly hair on the plate...obviously not my wife's or mine. Kids pan pizza obviously a reheated boboli like pizza.  My daughter didn't touch it. Consolidated some food on a plate to bring it home.  Waitress said that she would bring us a box because they 'are not allowed to box things up"" for us.  What?  That made no sense. Their own brand of IPA was relatively flavorless.  Overall tap beer list was very generic.  With Growler and Gill right down the road, there is no reason to go there for a beer. Wine glass for wife's drink was never polished from the night before. Wont be back.  it's a shame.  With G&G down the road in one direction, and Yard House the other, there is no reason to go here for what they should be known for, a good beer and a burger."
