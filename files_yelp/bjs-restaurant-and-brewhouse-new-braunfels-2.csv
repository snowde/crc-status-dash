Katie H.,"San Antonio, TX",127,310,737,5.0,11/22/2017,"The service is 99% fast and excellent. The food is very good (minus the burgers), and they are always updating the menus. I love happy hours and the weekday specials on food and drinks. This place always keeps me coming back- especially the Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos- an ""enlightened"" entree (low calorie) and yet super filling and flavorful! Being a rewards holder definitely has its perks too! I get to skip waits and receive discounts/free pizookies!"
James P.,"San Antonio, TX",5,7,,5.0,7/13/2017,"Tried to eat here and waited 10 minutes after being seated and no server finally got up and left. Stay away unless you have all day to wait, get no service -------------------------------------------------  Update: after speaking to the manager we came back and had awesome service. Kalaya our server was on top of everything. Aaron the manager was good to us and the food was excellent. Thank y'all for the great experience and excellent turn around in service!!!!"
Regg P.,"San Marcos, TX",0,19,40,4.0,12/15/2017,Decided to try again after our visit which was not the best. Recommend the Italian Market tavern style pizza which was pretty good. Also tried their Strawberry Splash drink has a good combination of daquirri and Pina colada. Don't forget to try the Chocolate chip Pizookie. Our server Jared provided good service.
Khian R.,"Universal City, TX",92,91,235,4.0,8/18/2017,This is one of my favorite spots . Yes I have plenty . But I like to come to this location for the great customer service and dessert. I come here sometimes just for a Pizookie. Tonight I tried the steak for the first time. I'm usually eating pizza. It was cooked just the way I ordered it. Our server Nicolas was really nice and attentive . My family enjoyed their meals as well. My go to drink is the white peach margarita. A must try. The sriracha wings were amazing. Spicy !!! But the flavor was so good we ordered more to go. Some of them didn't make it to the car . That's how food they are. Download the app and you can place yourself on the waitlist . Soon as we walked in our table was ready.
Kay S.,"New Braunfels, TX",0,24,8,4.0,10/28/2017,Best experience ever!!  Get Dave as your server!!!  Food was as expected and that's the reason for 4 stars but Dave was a 10!!  Made the lunch exceptional.. way to go!!
Yadhira L.,"San Antonio, TX",439,174,514,2.0,4/24/2017,"BJ's is one of my favorite chain restaurants. It was a restaurant of choice with my BFF when I lived in California. The food never disappoints and I usually have a great time. However, this location must be cursed. It's been a pit stop for me between San Antonio and Austin for a few years now. However, I have not had the best experiences here.  First of all, it feels cavernous. The high ceilings and long center aisle of leathery booths feels like a trek and I'm usually guided all the way down near the rest rooms. Not sure if it's me or their policy to fill seats starting from the back but that's where I wind up. Being so close to the restrooms you would think that it's a quick trip to the loo and back to table. When it takes a lot of hand waiving and a few ""excuse mes"" to get the waitress' attention, it takes the bus boy all of 30 seconds to clear my table when I head to the facilities. I was with my kid and we decided to go together. We had packed up our leftovers and left the box on the table. I didn't think that was enough so I also left my keys hoping that was enough to let them know we were coming back. Not 5 minutes later and everything was gone. My leftovers were tossed in the trash and my keys sent to the back office! Not even at the front desk. Why would they think that someone wouldn't return immediately for their keys?? I was so upset. They offered to make us another plate but I had no time to wait. Iwas mid-road trip and I was already waiting for someone to fetch my keys way in the back of the cavernous long aisle, around the corner, and in their top secret vault. It's just so illogical. Why not wait a few more minutes to make sure we weren't returning. It wasn't crowded. There wasn't a wait. The manager offered me a coupon for a free pizooke but there's no BJs close to my house and I don't plan on stopping by again. It's a shame because I really like BJs and their menu selection. On another occasion, I stopped by with a friend during happy hour. We were headed to Gruene and decided to meet along the freeway at BJs. Once we were seated we could not order anything for happy hour. The waitress said we had to sit at the bar to get any happy hour deals. So, we had to move over two rows, to another booth, to another waitress, just to get the lower price. I just don't understand why one booth costs more than another when they're both the same. It was embarrassing. Made to feel like we were cheap for moving tables with our water, menus and napkin wrapped utensils in hand. I just think it's lame. Again, the place wasn't packed. Who cares where we sit for happy hour?  This location must be cursed or the management likes to keep things hollow and vacant including my table. Happy hour rules do not make for a happy hour."
Eryn P.,"Waldorf, MD",48,33,55,3.0,8/20/2017,"Mediocre food and atmosphere. The menu was so long (20 pages) that it took me forever to order. When the food came I would call mediocre at best. I was a little disappointed. With so many choices, I was sure that they would have something fabulous. The fried artichoke was actually pretty good (if you are lactose intolerant ask for no parmesan on top).  The piadini (not sure I spelt that right) was alright too. And the children's meals were pretty typically, with the mac n cheese being straight out of a box."
Kate S.,"Houston, TX",152,61,78,4.0,8/28/2016,"This was the first time I have ever been to BJ's and I loved it. Our server, Sharisse, was AMAZING! Gave her over 20% tip because she was extremely attentive, knowledgeable about the menu, kind, and not a single drink in my party was EVER empty.  We started with spinach and artichoke dip, and it was good, but I would try something else next time. My boyfriend got the steak and it was awesome, good flavor and perfectly cooked. I got the shrimp tacos which were good, just thought they could use a little more seasoning, marinade or char grill the shrimp versus broil them. My sister got the Mediterranean chicken tacos, she loved them. Then her boyfriend got the jambalaya and enjoyed that too. We finished up with pazookies, and these are a must! Even if you get a mini one, it really brings the meal together at the end, and they are outstanding. My favorite was the cookies and cream out of the two. Overall, food was great, and service was fantastic. I would definitely ask for Sharisse."
Amber D.,"Kyle, TX",0,23,,4.0,9/6/2017,"This restaurant is usually good. I got a tuna salad and my husband got a chicken sandwich. Both were really good and our drinks came out good! I would of like a little faster service considering they weren't busy at all, but I understand some people aren't meant for the service industry. We will be back to BJ's!"
Iz S.,"San Antonio, TX",1,119,12,4.0,3/26/2017,"My wife and I stopped for a quick dinner on a Friday night. Place was getting busy but the wait time was relatively short. I had the brisket bacon burger which was outstanding! My wife had the grilled cheese sandwich which she enjoyed.  Both meals were hot and fresh. Our waiter was attentive and prompt, always checking on us. We will definitely come back."
Chris W.,"Seabrook, TX",43,30,19,5.0,8/6/2016,"After a long day at Schlitterbahn I almost forgot that good customer service exists and a company can actually value a customer and treat them as if though they are happy you're spending time in their establishment.    BJ's helped restore that faith thanks to a great server who seemed genuinely happy to have us in her section.  A friendly smile, a warm greeting, quick drinks and good food helped end the day  The wings app was great, the chips and quest great.  My BJ brewhouse bacon cheeseburger was big, juicy, fresh and flavorful.   My wife's chicken fried steak was average (steak super well done and had to ask for more gravy to help provide more flavor.    A great visit, a great experience and we'll be back."
Erica A.,"New Braunfels, TX",2,20,5,4.0,7/20/2017,"I finally tried this place out for dinner last weekend and I'm glad I did. We walked right in and were seated with no wait on a Saturday night, the service was wonderful. The food was all excellent from burgers and salads to the rib-eye, and reasonably priced. There is something for everyone here, nice variety on the menu and a great beer selection! It is a place definitely worth trying, especially if you are looking for something open late in New Braunfels."
Marcy B.,"New Braunfels, TX",0,7,,4.0,6/27/2017,"Nice staff and service, food was just OK....I had to send mine back, but the manager was very sorry and gave me free dessert!"
Gordon G.,"Virginia Beach, VA",16,3,,1.0,6/23/2016,Worst experience ever.  Hostess dropped one set of silverware while seating us...meal took over 30 minutes to arrive...we asked for a manager and silverware...server insisted I cut into my steak before she left to get manager and silverware...5 minutes later no manager no silverware...our server shows up to ask us how everything tasted...my wife said hard to tell without silverware and again asked for a manager and silverware...another 3 minutes go by no manager and no silverware...we get up and walk out.   Popcorn at the movie ended up being dinner. Never again at that BJs
Emily I.,"San Antonio, TX",2,3,1,1.0,7/31/2017,"Came in for a quick bite in between my shifts, sat at the empty bar around 1:30. The bartenders were nice but mainly stayed in the corner texting and chatting the whole time. They did their jobs perfectly well but I wouldn't have two people on at that point. It's not just a waste of employee hours but you end up having them distract each other rather than give service that is above an beyond. My problem with my visit is because of the manager. The 4 options on the tv were old replays of basketball, a jet ski race, and an interview with Dennis Rodman. I asked the bartender if they would be able to put on Shark week on one of the boxes (my restaurant has been playing it all week and it is a big hit) she was equally excited to put it on and skipped off to ask the manager. Disappointment struck like a Great White clamping down on a surfer when she told me her manager would not allow it because they are a ""family friendly"" restaurant. I laughed at first not realizing she wasn't joking.. I somewhat get that it might not be family friendly if they are showing sharks attacking. But that's not what shark week is, its education programming about sharks and how they are not the man eaters we perceive. But what was most laughable is that the manager would consider sharks not family friendly but Dennis Rodman is! I get it, Bjs has strict  rules, I worked at one for a year many moons ago. But this managers skill need to be checked, the bar was empty, the restaurant was fairly empty, there were workers standing around everywhere just chatting and waiting to go home, and the simplest customer request gets denied. I won't be returning to this location because I live no where near it and was only in the area to help my boss. My comment will probably never be noticed but maybe you Saturday morning manager will see this and learn how to run your floor a bit better. Also I'm just bored waiting for an appointment right now."
Chris N.,"Dripping Springs, TX",0,40,,2.0,7/20/2017,"BJ's used to be my favorite. Prices have gone up, portions seem smaller and not quite as good, management is getting weaker all the time, in house maintenance is lacking, and their rewards program went to crap. And the music is the worst!"
Lauren M.,"Johnson City, TX",44,18,42,4.0,3/1/2017,"I absolutely love their tomato soup! I usually get it in the bread bowls and it is an amazing way to eat soup. I love it. I also had one of their strawberry mojitos, delicious but expensive."
David M.,"Austin, TX",83,120,185,2.0,8/18/2015,"Let me start by stating that I am a huge fan of BJ's Brewhouse, in general. The one in Corpus Christi rocks, \m/ !!! This location, is the most convenient to my current geographical location, so I've been frequenting it.  I have had issues with the quality of my food, items taking forever to be cooked, and delivered to the table, lack of proper service, and excessive wait times.  This location appears to be understaffed most of the time, and the management is nowhere to be found. I have witnessed servers having to stop, and bus their own tables, as the bus persons, were missing in action. Outside on their phones, or a smoke break, I'm assuming. This, in turn, created delays in service. I've observed patrons, chasing down their server, in order to get the check, and leave, or get something they needed. Drinks not refilled, dessert skipped, in order to just get our check, and get out in under two hours!! The waitstaff, has always been friendly, but they are obviously stretched too thin."
K B.,"Abilene, TX",11,46,26,5.0,7/10/2016,"I sat at the bar for dinner (full services) and was greeted immediately by the bartenders. There is a split screen TV for entertainment if you enjoy that while you are eating. I enjoyed the ""Spicy Pig"" thin crust pizza. (SO GOOD). Their cocktails are reasonably priced- I can vouch for the jalapeño margarita && the Bloody Mary. Check it out if you are in the area!"
Chris K.,"Austin, TX",6,17,1,1.0,3/15/2016,"Save Time and Money by eating elsewhere We've been visiting this location about monthly for two years in hopes the establishment returns to the standards it had upon opening. For the past 18 months this location has suffered dramatically in both service and food quality. The last visit included a hostess looking at everything except the guest while talking to the guest! Upon seating, the Hostess thought it cute to play Frisbee with the menu! Yeah, not only unprofessional, but down-right rude. During this visit the food was adequate although we never actually received flatware or napkin (the meal came with spoons).  In short, this location has failed miserably at every possible turn. We're just done with this place. We just don't have it in us again to ever return."
Robin W.,"Spicewood, TX",71,344,184,4.0,4/16/2016,Great food and service. Absolutely love the avocado egg rolls.   Great place to meet up and hang out with friends
Bud H.,"Sherman, TX",0,45,3,4.0,7/18/2016,"We are regulars at the BJ's , like the variety of beer on tap. BBQ chicken salad is very good, tried the avocado wrap for the first time, it is fantastic! From this point it will be a must order.  Carmel ice cream cookie!!! Oh good!!!"
Megan C.,"New Braunfels, TX",64,6,,1.0,8/30/2016,"We come here often. Usually our experience is pretty average, nothing exceptional. The only reason we keeping coming back is because they are the only restaurant still open by the time we are out of work And we have found the staff worth going to.  Unfortunately our go-to servers (Piere and some guy with long brown hair and glasses....Nick maybe) were both off tonight. Tonight bj's gets a 1 star because of the worst service ever. Calaya (I'm guessing that's how you spell her ridiculous name) is by far the worst server they have.  We have had her a few times in the past and she has ALWAYS been terrible. How is she still an employee? She's standoff ish, takes FOREVER and is a complete mood killer. One time I ordered a steak and it came out completely wrong and she was nowhere to be found. 20 minutes later we asked another server to go find her. We were literally one of two tables in the restaurant so we know she wasn't busy. What is this girls problem??? When we realized she would be our server tonight we gave her yet another chance at redemption. She crashed and burned tremendously.  We left before our food could even be sent to the kitchen because we are done with her.  We will ask before being seated next time for anyone besides Calaya. Edit* It turns out several of my family members have also received extremely poor service from this girl. They knew instantly who I was complaining about."
Mike K.,"Canyon Lake, TX",4,71,5,3.0,4/22/2016,Ate here for first time today for lunch. The service was quite crisp. Responsive and not intruding! The food came out a little slow. They were not busy but we weren't in a rush. My guests were pleased with their choices. A chicken club and a hot ham and cheese. I had the mini pizza with soup. Quite small and just ok! It was hot! Don't know if I'll ever return but the service and attention warranted a three star.
Julie H.,"Wimberley, TX",24,15,,1.0,3/1/2017,"If i were to rate nearly every experience here including just the day before it would almost always be a 5. But this is about my last experience when i was trying ti celebrate my birthday with my mom and sadly it's not a five.  We came in excited to spend time together and enjoy the good food but it took forever just to get our drink order taken, and then forever to get refills from our server.  We couldn't get her attention when we needed something because she was standing and chatting with another table for 5 to 10 min at a time.  It is extremely frustrating to eat at a place you enjoy where you know the staff is capable of delivering not only good food but also good service and be totally ignored. At one point when we were looking for some help from the our waitress and she was once again chatting up the other table one of our party approached the front desk where they seat you because 3 waiters were standing at this one table where our waitress had gone and we couldn't get anyone to even get our waitresses attention for us. When I say 5 to 10 min each time I'm not kidding we ate in less than 30 min but it took over and hour and 45 to get through lunch by the way. After we get a waitress from the front to help us since our waitress was occupied, apparently they told her we were feeling neglected and she came and was overly friendly trying to compensate for ignoring us completely and while we already irritated by the bad service we would have chalked up the bad experience to her having an off day and come back again no bad review here and called it a day. But apparently she took what we said at the podium to that table she couldn't tear herself away from because the guests from that table felt the need to walk by our table and make rude comment and try to embarrass us. Not sure why, unless they were friends or family to each other but even then you wouldn't expect one guest to not only hold up the waitstaff from every other guest but to also go out of their way to try and ruin another guests experience when they didn't appreciate the hold up.  The manager was doing his best to apologize for his waitresses poor service and even tried to talk to the guest that went out of her way to be rude but after all of it happened and we paid for our meal we just felt a bit bullied and ganged up on so it just didn't feel like enough to say sorry and offer no real recourse.  And all of this happened when my mom was trying to treat me to lunch on my birthday with my 4 little kids. My oldest son is 6 and was crying in the car when we left because of the stress from the woman who felt the need to come and give us a smart remark.  We were trying to have a nice birthday celebration lunch and by the end of it the day was just ruined. So we won't be back not that they will notice or care but if you want a nice lunch yes they food will taste good but maybe bring water from home and hope nothing is wrong with your order or go down the road and eat at one of New Braunfels other reastaurants that consistently offer good food AND good service."
RussandKim S.,"Sugar Land, TX",26,2,,4.0,12/30/2016,Generally try to eat local but thought we would give BJs a try.  Good and service were very good.  I would consider BJs a go to..
Russell J.,"New Braunfels, TX",0,5,,2.0,6/28/2017,"This is my second poor experience with BJ's New Braunfels take out order, and this is a review of this supposed benefit of their restaurant. Their phone tree system does not always work--in other words when you press 1 as instructed for a take out order, you just keep hearing the blather about their website. Pressing 1 does not always take you to the person who takes your order. It took three phone calls last night to get through to place an order. I'm sorry, but that set's a bad tone for the rest of the experience."
Jennifer C.,"San Marcos, TX",7,7,4,3.0,9/22/2016,"The queso was watered down, the cheddar broccoli soup tasted store bought. The stuffed mushrooms were on point and delicious."
FranChadska B.,"Universal City, TX",16,11,6,5.0,9/25/2015,"Excellent food and atmosphere. Oktoberfest was divine, the lemon pepper wings were delicious and the BJs Classic deep dish was perfect. They are extremely generous with their toppings..I had meat and mushrooms falling off and very much enjoyed eating them with my fork. :)  Also, we had a party of 8 with 4 children and our waitress was so super nice and patient with us. It is rare you find that. Great family place."
Carla C.,"New Braunfels, TX",28,64,43,5.0,9/13/2016,"They have an amazing gluten-free menu! Ribeye was delicious! And the chocolate chip gluten-free Pizookie was to die for !!We ended up ordering a salmon quinoa, and they removed the gluten ingredients.. Lindsay was our server, and she was phenomenal! She knew the gluten-free menu like the back of her hand, and she is actually the one that suggested the salmon quinoa dish and taking the soy sauce out to make it gluten-free. Best service we've ever had here by far!!"
Donovan T.,"San Antonio, TX",314,372,371,5.0,5/26/2014,"I can say I will come back again. Me and the wife came here for dinner. This is not your old school brew house. This is a brew house with class.  The menu leads off with selection of craft beers. I recommend the Hopstorm IPA. Then you move into your food selections. Now this is not bar food. I'm talking Gourmet Mac & Cheese and, Salmon. Which is just as amazing as it sounds in that last sentence.  The service was there. Professional service. For the prices I say this place is bang for your buck. I just changed the original stars I was giving it to 5 after reading what I just wrote about this place. BJ's get my certification of a 5 Star Yelp restaurant.  There is so much more that I could write but you have to check it out for yourself."
Susie V.,"San Antonio, TX",11,14,19,5.0,10/23/2016,The New Braunfels BJ's is terrific! There are a few vegan options including the veggie burger and the Asian Salad (specify no chicken!) Patricia is a fabulous server and always gets everything right. Wonderful place to celebrate special occasions or pop in on your lunch hour.
Abubu A.,"Corpus Christi, TX",1,149,8,4.0,9/25/2016,"Good solid service hence the 4 stars. Food isn't bad but their avocado roll tended to be brown in the 2 times out but we overcame the 1 out of 10, 7.5 level food with their great service!"
Georgi S.,"Knoxville, TN",102,51,53,3.0,5/14/2015,"A good place to have a cider, try the apple crispin with organic honey. Also good food, new menu and friendly staff."
Sean T.,"San Antonio, TX",104,252,255,4.0,4/20/2015,"OK the deepdish pizza wasn't quite what I was expecting but it was good nonetheless.  Frankly better than Gino's in town.  Their beer selection will bring me back.   Salad was amazing, calamari was above average, coffee was great along with our dessert."
Lulu B.,"Great Neck, NY",0,104,,1.0,6/10/2016,Overpriced and generic frozen food.  The menu is overwhelming and I believe that is why everything is so-so.  They advertise hand crafted sodas that taste the same as my soda stream.  Big deal?  Not sure why this place doesn't get it tigether
Melissa O.,"New Braunfels, TX",2,21,8,5.0,9/23/2016,Cold beer Always and some of THE Best food in New Braunfels even if it IS a chain restaurant!
Danielle G.,"New Braunfels, TX",4,7,,5.0,8/14/2016,"I def don't think the amount of stars BJs has represents it-I love eating here. Staff is always friendly, food is always tasty and the menu is like a book so there is something for everybody in the family :)"
Grant L.,"Trophy Club, TX",2,20,,2.0,3/24/2016,"Now look, I'm not the wicked witch of the west-I love a nice little BJ's run for lunch or a quick dinner. Received horrible service at this location in particular though. Very unfortunate because I would have loved to leave a higher rating. I was siting there with one of my bestfriends and his significant other along with my heart and soul. We ordered our food and the food arrived almost 25 minutes for the other couple compared to us. One word, unacceptable."
Daryll B.,"San Antonio, TX",455,480,2805,3.0,6/13/2014,"First time here. Before entering the building, one is greeted with a beautiful moat or pond with cascading fountains as big as the full length of the restaurant. It was night, so I couldn't take pics of this waterscape. We were seated right away and attended to by Pierre, a polite and great server. The menu was average sized and reminded me of TGIF, with similar pricing. The prices were a bit more than Chilis. Sandwiches at Chilis are in the 8.95 range, and here in the 10-11.95 range. We ordered the potato skins with ranch dipping sauce $8.95). They were extra crispy, fluffy, and topped with excellent bacon.  My wife got the angel hair pasta and shrimp. Her shrimp were undercooked, but the manager took care of rectifying to our satisfaction and explaining all their cooking processes. What a way to go up and beyond to satisfy a customer! I had the roast beef dip sandwich, which comes with a dark and rich au jus and horseradish. Outstanding, that roast beef was so tender--and with that jus--I haven't tasted a sandwich like that in ages. Unlike some places that serve processed gristly beef on their Philly sandwiches, this was real beef.  The sandwich was on a toasted french roll and came with with thin fries or seasoned wedge fries. I chose the wedge and dipped them in that jus. They also have steaks, 1/2 pound burgers, pizza, ribs, and a huge craft beer collection. I mean this is a brewhouse.  With this level of customer satisfaction, and that roast beef sandwich, I hope this is the start of a long relationship."
