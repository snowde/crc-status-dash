Ian V.,"Kyle, TX",0,2,,1.0,6/23/2013,Second time going and the service was terrible. Only time we saw our waitress was to order and get our check. She seemed overwhelmed and didn't have a good attitude. Had to chase down other wait staff for condiments and drinks. Will not be going back.
Anna G.,"Georgetown, TX",25,90,5,2.0,6/11/2012,"I was SOOOOOOOO excited to finally get a BJ's around here. I usually frequent this place back at my old University stomping grounds at OSU when I return to hang out. I love their beer, I think it's pretty darn tasty. The Hefeweizen is my go to beer but the stouts are delicious as. The food selection is ""Cheesecake factory-esk"" If you can't find anything on this 8 page menu then you need to work harder. We came on a Wednesday because we didn't want to have to deal with a wait...there was a 20min wait. Ok ok so you just opened fine. I'm good and still excited when we get seated...until that 5min mark has passed and we still haven't seen our server. And when she does show up it takes another 5min to get our drinks. Ok ok so your new, I get it. But then the food came, and it was tasteless. It's just not how I remember it. My excitement has ceased since then. I haven't gone out of my way to come back but wil when I'm looking to have a good beer before the movie starts at the theater behind."
Gwen B.,"New Braunfels, TX",16,3,,5.0,9/21/2012,"BJ's is new to New Braunfels.  Heard it had great pizza.  Ordered a pizza to go on wheat, they called back to let us know that they were out of wheat (normal for a new restaurant until they learn what the locals want). We did not care. Went to pick it up and because they did not have the wheat they gave us dessert and gift cards to come back. Wow!!!  That is way more than was needed.  The pizza was excellent and we can't wait to go dine in!"
Brian B.,"Schertz, TX",0,3,,1.0,6/23/2013,"We have eaten at other BJs and always have great things to say, however this one was bad. The server seemed pre-occupied/overwhelmed the entire time. She also walked away from our table twice right in the middle of us trying to order something. The food was blah. 40 minutes we waited, all the food was just slightly warm. Burned cheese pizza for our daughter. I ordered the mahi mahi tacos, which had very very small amounts of meat, a rip off for the 13 dollar price tag. And here's a tip for ALL servers---don't put hot food, plates, drinks,  or anything else for that matter, in front of a baby sitting in a high chair! A billion years of evolution, all the technology and knowledge we have, the smartest human beings have ever been, and your stupid ass puts a steaming hot plate, and drinks (twice) directly in front of a baby, who instantly reaches at them. Use common sense, and BE POLITE. I understand people have bad days, but your job is to serve food and make the customers happy, if you can't do that, find another job where you Don't have to deal with people. We will not return to this location again!"
Donald C.,"Cibolo, TX",0,4,,1.0,9/17/2012,"Took the family after a high school football game.  Big mistake, bad service, bad attitude, bad prices....but at least the bathroom was clean.  We got an icy welcome when we walked in, followed by a upset sounding follow me by the person taking us to our table.  Yikes, not the way I like to start a family dinner.  Our waitress comes around promptly and takes our dinner order but she apparently wrote everything down incorrectly.  My wife gets the wrong dish altogether, my daughter doesn't get her apple sauce.  My other daughters order arrives without her side dish.  We sent back my wife's plate to get the right order.  Which remained on my bill.  Lame.  My older daughter was dying to try the pazookie.  Reluctant I agreed to order dessert, wrong cookie, wrong flavor of ice cream, only a single scoop, etc.  this was my third time at this location at it has fared worse every time.  Too bad, really wanted this place to be a destination due to being right in front of my local movie theater."
