Gab F.,"San Antonio, TX",0,6,4,5.0,1/29/2017,"tonight I ordered togo from BJs and have never been disappointed. I ordered the garden vegetable potato which is from their lunch menu, yet they serve it all day. When I got home I realized my potato had alot of chicken in it, and I'm a vegetarian. I called back to clarify if it really did contain chicken and the man on the phone(Aaron) was very nice and let me know it was an error from the kitchen. He offered to remake it even this late at night on a Sunday(around 10:30) or give a gift card to cover the problem. I went to pick it up and I am very happy with how they solved the problem. I really appreciate that they remade it for me and I appreciate their courtesy. Never have I had a problem with this BJs and will continue to visit. Thanks!!"
David C.,"Cibolo, TX",12,5,,5.0,7/23/2016,"This was our first visit but, we're going back again. The food was delicious, the Staff was friendly and welcoming, especially our server ""Jessica L"" (who made us feel very welcome and was very attentive)."
Amanda A.,"Llano, TX",60,240,160,5.0,9/12/2014,"Our family love this place!  It's like a Chili's on steroids!!!! A little bit if everything to suit all moods. House specialty root beer- yum! Avocado Egg rolls!  Need I say more?? The appetizer sampler is HUGE!!! I had a crispy chicken salad today, delicious!  The lettuce was all chopped up already, this made eating it faster & easier & I liked it! My 4 year old said the spaghetti was the best he's ever had.  Lots of kids options. Also- the Pizookie desserts are so good!!! Hot cookies with ice cream over the top. The pizzas look amazing, I think I'll try that next. Enjoy this place!!"
Cliff H.,"New Braunfels, TX",0,17,,2.0,1/27/2016,"I've had great experiences at a number of BJ's restaurants across the countryside. This location in New Braunfels.......not so much.  Been three times now and have had three ehh, so so experiences."
Lee H.,"New Braunfels, TX",0,27,4,5.0,12/23/2015,"Delicious and overpriced, just the way I like it.  Seriously though, way over priced.  The beer is really good though.  The food is great most of the time but on occasion I have been let down.  Always had good service. I hate it that when I call I am initially greeted by a recording instead of a real person.  That just seems really unprofessional and classless."
sheila S.,"San Marcos, TX",5,32,9,4.0,4/18/2016,The menu is very large! if you can't find anything to eat there you mustn't have any appetite at all food is good they atmosphere is good lots of great choices I think it's all around good place
Nehal P.,"Bryan, TX",86,7,,3.0,3/11/2016,"Food is good, but I would say not worth the overall price. The restaurant is nice and staff is friendly. However, you will end up spending a lot more than you intended to for food that can be had at 1/2 the price"
Elgie J.,"Missouri City, TX",0,11,4,1.0,11/24/2015,Service was good By Sarah . Chicken undercooked and other order was just wrong . We had to send both orders back   Everyone has a bad day -this was theirs.
Sabine F.,"Cibolo, TX",89,428,1265,1.0,11/15/2014,"The reason why I am giving this restaurant a one star is that the service is zero and they advertise beer they have on the menu that they no longer carry. Instead of substituting the beer with another brand without telling the customer they should let the customer know. In addition, our waiter never checked on us. We won't be eating here anymore."
Justin S.,"Mountain Home, TX",0,10,10,1.0,10/6/2015,"Our first time visiting , a waitress. Dropped a tray full of ice water on my 1 year old sons head, never dod i hear back from a manager to check and see if my son was alright, he was screaming. In pain plus had ice cold water poured on him, from 11:00 that evening until 10 am the next morning i was stuck infront of the toilet pukeing from food poisoning i received from BJ's. . dine at your own risk"
Laurie D.,"San Antonio, TX",97,16,8,4.0,3/5/2016,"LOVE THIS PLACE!  Everything I have tried has been excellent, their microbrews are great, the service has always been good. The menu is diverse!  You can get flatbread pizza or an open faced pot roast sandwich.  HIGHLY recommend the Parmesan crusted chicken."
C C.,"Coronado, CA",0,32,2,4.0,4/6/2017,"2/3 visits have been wonderful! First visit was forgettable but it must have been a fluke because I finally went back after 2 years to try again and holy moly! I am blown away! Both servers have been wonderfully attentive without being intrusive and very warm and friendly. Regrettably I don't recall my second servers name but this last visit we had Madison take care of us and she is wonderful! I was dining with my two very young children in an area separate from all other diners (at my request) and yet she never made me feel forgotten or an inconvenience. The food is good- kids meals are pedestrian and not something I would be impressed with- but my kids eat every bite! I love that y'all send out a little garlic knot and fruit for the kids before the meal, then having that little nibble while we wait for the entrees helps keep things calm! I am stuck on the Asian salad--- I want to try something else but it is so good I can never pass it up!!"
Robert M.,"Austin, TX",13,555,13,3.0,11/11/2014,"Came here after work with a buddy. We worked late and he was in town so he suggested the place. Arrived to a packed parking lot but the place wasn't that full. Some sort of corrupted feng shui going on there. There were plenty of booths so the hostess decided to save the normal booths for someone else and sat us at these weird 1/2 booths. The ones that are uncomfortably small like they are trying to pack more people into the joint so that they can make more money off of you. Wait...maybe that explains the parking mis match. Just about as soon as we sat down, the waiter arrived and asked us what we would like to drink. I had about 15 microseconds to know that I'd like to spend some serious time looking thru the massive drink selection. He seemed surprised that we didn't have it rolling off of our tongues so that he could run to his next income source. I asked him to give us a few minutes and he readily complied. My friend comes a lot and recommended that I try the four beer sampler. There were a lot of good choices and I figured he'd drag me back again so I just ordered the first four pale beers. Rather than one pint, you get four glasses of four ounces each. Seemed the way to go. Then things got a bit weird. I'm a ""fully confident"" guy who doesn't mind ordering ""girly drinks"" if the yen hits me. In fact my go to cocktail is a cosmo which my friends give me endless grief about. So, when the four glasses came, I didn't think much about drinking four beers out of four cutesy glasses that looked like champagne flutes. That is until I tried to get my normal sized nose around the glass. Can I guy just get a drink?? It was very awkward trying to drink from the micro-sized, flute shaped beer cups. I don't think anyone did a test of them before they stocked the store with them. Great idea of a way to sample beers, terrible way to deliver the beer. I had the first four on the menu, but one of the four didn't do it for me. I'm not as good of a beer snob as my friends so I won't try to amaze or impress or influence you with my tastes. Leave it to the fact that you should sample thru them, just bring your own glasses. I had the California club. It was about OK. It was the normal fare with some sort of overly dry bread. Or baked out. It came with great avocado, chicken breasts, slim amounts of bacon and the rest of the normal fare. I rate the beer as better than the food. Perhaps it was my choice. I'm definitely coming back to try some other options and hopefully then I'll just stick to one beer at a time."
Alusha R.,"Oceanside, CA",366,128,69,5.0,7/25/2015,"I was having an awful day. I was seated immediately. The waitress was very nice. I enjoyed a low calorie high carb meal. The check was given to me right after I finished eating. A very enjoyable experience. The kids seated near got obnoxious, but that can't be helped."
Candice J.,"Johnson City, TX",0,6,,5.0,3/20/2016,"Even if it's busy they know how to turn tables and create a positive experience.  The food is always delicious and the service is on point and friendly. Not what I expected in the best ways. This has become a regular dining spot for my family's special occasions. I would highly recommend to anyone looking for yummy food, tasty beer and a great time."
Rachel C.,"New Braunfels, TX",1,26,7,5.0,3/29/2015,"Always have awesome wait staff service. The food is always good and I am never disappointed. They have been able to maintain professional wait staff that bring your food out on time, fill your drinks when they need to be and are always friendly."
Darlyne C.,"Seguin, TX",8,5,1,5.0,3/11/2016,Our server was Pierre. I was inquiring about the Chocolate Ale and he brought me a sample! It was very good! My husband bought a float made from it! Scrumptious! I think it was called Chocolate Sin Ale.
Katy H.,"Seguin, TX",112,66,11,1.0,8/15/2014,"I am generally a big fan of BJ's Restaurant. It is a place my BF and I go to quite frequently. Being a creature of habit, I usually stick to the dishes I know I like but last night, I wanted to change it up a bit.  I ordered the Honey Lime Seared Scallops thinking the description sounded heavenly.  ""Tender seared scallops topped with tomato, basil, fire‑roasted red bell peppers and honey lime vinaigrette. Served with oven roasted asparagus and garlic seasoned brown rice."" What I got was nothing even remotely like this. The brown rice was completely flavorless, it was just so bland, I had to ask for butter to give it *any* kind of flavor. The asparagus were overcooked to the point of being dried and the level of pepper they put on it was so beyond overwhelming.   The scallops had a nice texture but there was no taste of honey or lime, just incredibly spicy. I have no clue if they mixed up my order with someone else's and I should have probably sent it back but I didn't. That being said, the Berry Blast cider was nice as was the Cream soda we had with dessert."
Lacey F.,"Dallas, TX",0,5,,5.0,8/24/2016,Great Place to eat at when visiting New Braunfels.
Larry G.,"Round Rock, TX",124,185,20,4.0,12/17/2013,"Went for the Cowboys game and ended up drowning my sorrows in their delicious Double IPA!!  While BJs is a chain, they have a great selection of draft beers; local, international and ones they brew themselves and I can be down with a place that has that much selection!    Tip of the Day:  $2 off pints and half price apps during NFL games!    I'm a big IPA fan so the bartender recommended the seasonal double IPA that BJ's brews themselves; I went with his recommendation and was rewarded amply!  If you like IPAs, you'd love this one; very hoppy and very, very strong!!  I had two glasses (not even pint size) and I was feeling mellow which helped in the fact of watching the Cowboys piss away another game.  Had some wings which were definitely solid; came naked drizzled in some of their homemade buffalo sauce and came with a cup of the sauce to dip in and cup of ranch as well to smooth out the heat.  No overly spicy but a good flavor.   Liked that they had smaller app plates as well so if you're dining alone you don't have to feel like you need to pig out.  All in all two beers, 10 wings for less than $15; not too shabby!  Will definitely be back next Sunday!"
