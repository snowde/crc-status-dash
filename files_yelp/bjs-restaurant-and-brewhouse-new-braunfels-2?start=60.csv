Bob H.,"New Braunfels, TX",7,31,1,2.0,8/15/2014,"Slow service, unremarkable food on a Thursday night. 4 beers+ 2 burgers = $50.00 You do the math."
Laura C.,"Seguin, TX",0,5,,5.0,7/23/2016,Wow!! We had the best service with such kindness!! They were so sweet to us and our baby!! Thank you BJs!!!
Anita C.,"New Braunfels, TX",20,312,131,3.0,9/13/2014,Great drink list but menu is too much. Too many choices. Overwhelming. I have bee. Here several times and although food was good it wasn't amazing.
_ _.,"Canyon Lake, TX",0,7,,1.0,3/29/2016,"Brought family that was visiting, and I am so embarrassed!  Out of 7 meals 5 had items that were unable to be eaten. The 2 meals that didn't have complaints were the pasta for 2 children..  We were told that the salad greens are always served wilted, (looked like cooked spinach).  At least they were consistent, on all three plates were wilted and slimy , and had to insist that replacements were brought out.  Another gentleman had a hamburger served bloody raw!  He was told that is the way they are served and had to insist that they cook.  A new burger was brought to him...but coleslaw was now on his plate instead of his fries???  What happened to his fries?  One gentleman had made specific requests about his meal NOT to including an item which when served it did, he sent his back to the kitchen and NEVER seen it again."
JE G.,"New Braunfels, TX",0,4,,2.0,6/22/2015,"Update: I submitted a complaint online and surprising was contacted by the GM fairly quickly. He apologized for the experience we had and promised to talk to his managers about this and correct these type of issues. As a gesture , he sent us a gift card and would like for us to give his restaurant another chance to make things right. We may take him up on his offer due to the fact that he did respond to our complaint. I will upgrade my rating from 1 star to 2 until we have an opportunity to return."
Merideth E.,"New Braunfels, TX",9,22,36,5.0,10/2/2014,"Love the gluten free options!!! Woodchuck, gf pizza, and the gf pazookie.  Try the fresh tomato and mozzarella salad- oh my goodness love it!!!"
Kevin B.,"Chesapeake, VA",11,12,28,4.0,12/20/2014,"This was the first visit for me and it's basically a nice sports bar but pretty good food. I got the 14oz Ribeye. At first, I thought it was very good, but after a few bites, realized it was very salty.  It was also rather chewy but it wasn't bad. The mashed potatoes were also tasty but also had some very salty bites. I realize it's not a steakhouse so I would say the steak was good for a non steakhouse. It's also a nice place for groups and it has plenty of tvs to watch the game. The staff are also very attentive and responsive."
Carolyn C.,"New Braunfels, TX",0,1,,2.0,6/18/2016,"Took guests with children and needed a broad menu, which we got.  We were all happy wth the waitress and service.  But, I had to ask for a clean set of silverware- it had food on the handle.  We all enjoyed the meal, and then came dessert.  The warm cookie with ice cream was delicious until my guest spotted a footlong hair embedded in it!  We sent it back and they brought another dessert.  Okay, but I probably won't go back and certainly will not take guests."
joey m.,"Central, TX",3,59,106,1.0,11/26/2013,"Second time here same result, over priced low quality food.   I have tried tilapia dish once and was disappointed and now the chicken dish disappoints.  The rice pilaf way over cooked and mushy.  The vegetables had 8 nearly whole raw garlic cloves mixed in but the chicken was not bad.  We started with the calamari which came out undercooked then 2nd one was fried well but you could tell the oil is ready to be changed.  I ordered a club soda and lime to drink and was brought with no lime and after several promises of brining them I finally walked to the bar and got them myself.    I am unsure if there will be a third chance unless we try the pizza next time.  Pretty disappointed."
Shelby F.,"New Braunfels, TX",0,15,1,1.0,11/29/2014,"This place was really great when it first opened and has just gone down hill from there. Today was the last time we will EVER go back. First our waitress was less than enthusiastic to be there. Not even a smile.  I ordered the chicken fried steak, it came out greasy, greasy,greasy and bland. My boyfriend ordered the fettuccine with rib meat and it to had zero flavor. Geez how do you screw up two easy menu items."
Mike M.,"Iowa City, IA",61,118,28,4.0,8/23/2013,"We try to stay away from chains generally, but we want to like this one due to the beer selection and wide menu for when we can't really decide what we want.  This was the first time we've been to a BJ's where the entire visit was painless and enjoyable.   We were bored and killing time while our child was at Schlitterbahn so we decided to stop in for a beer and something light before we picked up our kid and went out to dinner.  Since we were killing time we sat in the bar and were promptly waited on.  Our drinks arrived in a timely manner, our small plates were tasty, and our service was attentive without being overbearing. Why only 4 stars?  Well, while it's good it's not a place we just loooove.  It's better than the other national chains like Chili's but it's just not a place we will actively seek out next time we are in New Braunfels.  I will say that the north and south Austin locations could learn a few things from this one though.  Every time we've been to those locations something has happened that just rubs us wrong."
David S.,"Rio Rancho, NM",1,7,5,4.0,7/19/2015,"First time there, we were treated very good, food tasted super..... I would  go back again."
Leatha G.,"Clyde, TX",2,9,15,4.0,4/22/2015,Flatbread pizza appetizers enough for lunch and dinner!  I loved it.  Also enjoyed the lunch chicken tacos 'enlightened' version. Definitely going back!
Cameron H.,"Houston, TX",160,348,,4.0,12/23/2014,"This was actually my best experience at a BJ's ever. We stopped in as it was down the road from our hotel and my girlfriend had never been. So, I figured why not take her to try it out. Good idea! We had great service as well as great food and drink. I don't remember what drink she got, but it was tasty...and strong! Typically, I find BJ's drinks too sweet, but this was not too sweet at all. Great drink. I had some great beer throughout our meal, none of which I can remember, because, well...beer. All-in-all, it was a great experience all around and when I am in the area, I will definitely be back."
Tina B.,"San Antonio, TX",223,89,158,5.0,2/1/2014,"Came here after a Junior day at Texas State with our son. We were greeted & seated right away! Our waitress was very nice & attentive! We didn't have to wait long for our food to arrive after ordering! Everything was hot & fresh! The atmosphere was great! Location is great for shopping, eating,& entertainment right down from San Marcos Outlet. The menu offers a wide variety of American fare. Dessert was delicious! You to try the pizookie trio. It's your choice of 3 cookies stopped with ice cream for $10. And the beignets are delicious too. I gave 5 stars because of great location, service, food, menu prices, & great decor!"
Karen G.,"New Braunfels, TX",0,12,2,4.0,3/2/2016,Excellent customer service at the take out desk. Every time I visit I am offered a drink. That is extra touch that keeps me coming back!  That and the points.
Cele G.,"New Braunfels, TX",29,3,,2.0,7/31/2015,"Service was good, however, we found two hairs in two different plates!! We tell the waitress and she says she's going to get a new plate for my husband and then the manager comes and says he's sorry the inconvenience. He comps us for the meal but the waitress never returns with the ""remade"" meal. Maybe for the better. 2 stars for service."
H V.,"San Marcos, TX",1,31,,1.0,5/12/2015,"This is my second trip back here, and I won't be back. A group of friends and I went there on 5/9/15 for a birthday party. While I understand we had a large table - 15 people that does not excuse food being raw, and realizing there is no hand soap in the men's bathroom. My burger was  completely raw, and when I mentioned it to the server and the manger, the manager stood at our table not saying a word, like he was bored. The server tried to remedy the situation by offering me another burger which I declined, because I was disgusted by the bleeding sop of meat on my plate. The manger seemed irritated when asked to just remove the food from the table and my bill.   Additionally when one of the men from our table used the facilities he came back and had to ask for hand cleaner because not one of the soap dispensers had any soap.  The lack of hygiene and proper training in the kitchen is disgusting. I am glad that I wasn't puking a few hours later, but my stomach was upset as I had eaten some of the burger before I realized it was raw.   Eat at your own risk."
Marlena E.,"Highlands Ranch, CO",29,15,34,4.0,8/30/2014,"This place never disappoints. Always good food. I get the tuna tart tar, Santa Fe salad, southwest egg rolls to name a few. They have a beer sample tray so you can order small glasses of beers to try before commuting to one large glass. Mixed drinks are always good. In door seating lots of space for groups."
Verna S.,"New Braunfels, TX",101,66,2,4.0,9/26/2012,"This is pretty new to the area and let me tell you, I AM THRILLED!!!  It's so exciting to have a chain brewery so near by.  I really like the atmosphere of this place.  It's family friendly.  Before the divorce my ex and I used to enjoy going to BJ's as a family.  But that's in the past.  I'm learning to let go one day at a time.  Going here solo was a good first step. Maybe I'll even meet an online date here one day?  LOL!  Sure I wish the bar was smoke friendly but there's few places you're likely to find smoke friendly areas these days.  Honestly sometimes I feel us smokers are discriminated against.  But hey the beer hit the spot and I can go outside and sneak a smoke when I need to. Nice size portions of food.  I ordered Chicken Fried Steak and it was delicious.  Good food, good beer, good times!  I sometimes imagine opening up my own brew pub one day.   DREAM BIG!  The world is my oyster.  LOL!"
