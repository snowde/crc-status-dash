Shina R.,"Houston, TX",38,66,9,5.0,7/24/2014,"I've been going to this BJ's Restaurant with my husband for months now.  We like to go to BJ's before catching a film at the nearby movie theater.  The service has been great every time.  The restaurant is clean and comfortable.  The outdoor seating is great when it's not 100 degrees.  The food has been really good every time we have been here.  Sometimes it gets a little noisy, but other than that it's been great.  The fish tacos are really yummy.  Also the chicken bacon ranch pizza is one of our favorites.  Join the BJ's rewards if you go there frequently, it pays off!  We just had $10 taken off our last meal.  Oh also, they have a giant menu, so there's plenty to choose from."
Gage M.,"New Braunfels, TX",67,30,6,1.0,3/15/2014,"Nice bar but way overpriced and rediculously slow time for such poor quality of food. not a place to eat, maybe just watch the game. Not well managed and definitely understaffed, too."

David R.,"Cibolo, TX",3,27,2,3.0,3/23/2014,Well came after I left longhorn steakhouse for dessert   Yelp shows this placed closed on Sunday but they are wrong. A referred the salted caramel pizzookie with one of there reserve beers grand gru I think he called it   The beer is a must to try if you haven't yet   The cookie was stuck to the bottom the pan and I think they used blue bunny regular vanilla ice cream and not there usual vanilla bean. But if you scraped long enough the cookie was good. Got kinda old listening to 3 servers complain about not having any tables to wait on or short on schedule since they sat down to the left of me at a table that butted up to mine but not a one asked were my server went to   But all in all not bad compared to longhorn steakhouse
Ignacio R.,"Lewisville, TX",1,25,17,1.0,9/24/2013,"The servers suck! I am not sure if they hate the world or just their job, but our hostess seemed bothered with doing her job (that she get paid for!) and the server was confrontational from the beginning. The food is great, but that hasn't anything to do with this place. Every other BJ's I visited has been remarkable. This one sucks!"
Metal R.,"Seguin, TX",1,27,88,3.0,2/27/2014,It could have been better.   Chicken fried steak was bland.  Personal pizza was like from pizza hut.  Beer was flat.  Maybe. ..next time I will have a better time.
Frank D.,"Cibolo, TX",41,20,6,3.0,10/16/2013,The craft brewed root beer is awesome. Save room for a float!
Jason B.,"San Marcos, TX",202,20,2,2.0,1/7/2013,"BJ's is a great place, but the service really struggled at this one. This is our first trip to the NB location. There was nothing big, just a bunch of little things. 2 Apps came 10 minutes apart.  The first one was brought by a runner, and it was 5 minutes before we could find anyone to tell them we didn't have silverware. Went about 10 minutes without a server checking in us a couple of different times, and we all needed drinks. 10 minutes to get check after we had to ask for it. Maybe our server was overmatched, but we waited a really long time.  Not excited about going back to this one.  Food was fine, but I expect better service based on other BJ's I've been to."
Alana E.,"San Antonio, TX",0,16,6,5.0,10/3/2014,"Just wanted to drop a note emphasizing the excellent customer service we received this evening for a wedding rehearsal dinner. Despite the fact that the details of our dinner were planned at the last minute (our fault), the staff at the New Braunfels location were absolutely perfect, accommodating and flexible. I worked with Cipriano (Sipriano?) several times on the phone and he was as gracious and friendly as can be. I understand that our ever-changing plans couldn't have been the easiest to deal with, but he never made us feel like a nuisance and was a true professional. Russ was an absolute gem as well, and took good care of us after Cipriano went home. Our servers, Emily and Liz, were perfect, and everyone in our party was impressed with the efficient and friendly service they provided. Not to mention the food was delicious and served on time without any hiccups. The party staff at the New Braunfels location are rock stars, turning what could have been a stressful event into a pleasant and easy experience. I would absolutely recommend this venue for anyone wanting an easy, affordable group dining location. The oasis of a stress free event in the midst of a chaotic wedding week could not have been more appreciated!"
Kim M.,"San Marcos, TX",13,82,13,5.0,5/24/2013,"So after an afternoon of playing monkey at Alpha Warrior in SA a group of us decided to stop in here on our way back home. What a stroke of good luck. BJ's Brewhouse has guess what - their own home brews and their Hef was pretty tasty. I ordered a salad and it was huge! Full of chicken, avocado and tons of other good yummy things. Everyone at our table raved about their food from salads to salmon to burgers. It's a bit pricey for a family outing but would score big on a date night. Nice clean, relaxed atmosphere with friendly staff to top it off. I will be back!!!"
Jade M.,"San Antonio, TX",204,644,1575,4.0,3/31/2013,"I had my second visit to BJ's in New Braunfels yesterday for lunch. The first visit was during their soft opening last spring. Unfortunately their kitchen was pretty backed up (which I understand - since it was a soft opening), but goodness the food was DELICIOUS. My table of classmates shared the Turkey Club Sandwich, Italian Chicken Parmigiana, Chicken Alfredo Baked Potato and the Miso Salmon. Everything came out hot and tasty - we all loved everything! We ended our meal with BJ's Famous Pizookie - a warm chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream on top. What a sweet way to end our meal! Yesterday the service was much more prompt that my last visit and the server was very kind and recommended some different dishes to me and my group. I had the Fresh Watermelon and Feta Salad - so refreshing and perfectly dressed, and the Chicken Club Sandwich - YUMMO. The sandwich had toasted, buttered sourdough bread, delicious grilled chicken, bacon, fresh avocado, tomato, lettuce and garlic mayo - all music to my ears. I also got to taste the Chicken Bacon Ranch Pizza - all good flavors, however the pizza was kind of soggy in the middle :(. Yesterday our bill was $46, which included the Chicken Club Sandwich, the Fresh Watermelon and Feta Salad (which is considered a ""small plate"" and is around $3), an individual Chicken Bacon Ranch pizza and the Grilled Steak Salad. I can't complain about the overall taste and quality of the food - but I wish it was a little less expensive..."
Keaton D.,"New Braunfels, TX",57,1,,1.0,8/18/2012,Terrible food and terrible service. Took over an hour and a half to get food. And then the steak was awful!! Never going back ....
Alyx G.,"Rockville, MD",17,51,1,1.0,9/11/2012,"The worst BJ's I have ever been to.  Hubby ordered a tried and true Chicken Club Sandwich...ick..mushy bread, soggy bacon, and bland bland bland chicken.  What a dissappointment.  My salad (also tried and true) was just ok. The service was mediocre at best.  We expect so much more from BJ's.  This one just didn't live up to what we had experienced from the BJ's chain in other cities from Washington State to Texas.  Sent BJ's corporate a message stating the same and didn't even get a reply..bad on you BJ's corporate customer service!  With all the great dining options in this area we won't be spending any of our entertainment/dining dollars here again."
Susan C.,"New Braunfels, TX",64,17,,3.0,8/22/2012,Food is fine.  Nothing amazing but perfect for people that are more traditional.  Their beers are mediocre and this is supposed to be the big selling point.
Nathan W.,"New Braunfels, TX",0,11,,2.0,2/23/2014,"Came here Sunday the 23rd had some great beer! Service was ok at the bar, ordered California club flatbread. The menu picture looked great however I got the skeleton version. What ingredients were on it tasted great but not what I saw or expected. Way to much bread and scant ingredients."
Nicole T.,"McQueeney, TX",84,43,7,4.0,7/15/2012,Love the under 575 calorie menu. The veggie pizza on whole grain crust is excellent as well as the mango chicken salad.
Heather M.,"New Braunfels, TX",1,4,,4.0,2/12/2013,"I love this place for weekday lunch.  It offers a lot of food for a more than reasonable price if you order from the lunch menu.  I just wish they would offer more more ""enlightened"" dishes on the lunch menu."
Rodney A.,"San Antonio, TX",76,24,15,3.0,9/8/2012,"Waitress staff was good, Beer selection always good. Food is overpriced, especially for the portions they serve you. Taste good though, just not worth what they charge. The environment is lively and a good place to hang out to watch the game. Dessert was excellent!"
R B.,"Cape Coral, FL",0,3,,5.0,6/25/2014,"Very good selection of food and drinks. Place is very inviting. I had the salmon, which was very good. Also have very reasonable lunch specials, so I went back the next day for lunch. I will definitely go here again when in the area."
Emily C.,"Iowa, LA",0,3,2,3.0,12/18/2013,This is the 4th time I've been here and each time I've tried something different on the menu. Not impressed! Our steak was cold and chewy. The grilled chicken pasta was cold. Our ahi tuna appetizer was still frozen (waitress even said it needed to thaw before she could serve it..it's not fresh and tasted gross!) the only thing I have likes so far is the top shelf Margarita. Good place to have drinks...not so much on the food.
