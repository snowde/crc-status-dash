Kenneth L.,"Union City, CA",29,240,2954,4.0,1/5/2018,"BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse is located in Newark. It was a rainy day, and I felt like having some comfort food.  I decided on BJ's, which, coincidentally, I last visited on a rainy day. The staff were friendly and courteous as I was seated.  After a quick glance at the menu, I decided on Jumbo Spaghetti and Meatballs, since it was National Spaghetti Day the day before.  I also ordered a Peachberry Iced Tea. The Iced Tea was freshly brewed and was tasty and refreshing.  Soon thereafter came the Spaghetti and Meatballs.  It had the right amount of spices and garnish, and it was delicious and filling. I should dine here when it isn't raining."
Tony D.,"Newark, CA",233,17,,1.0,12/27/2017,"Just got done with my LAST BJ's experience.   The Newark restaurant is the worst.   Why does it take 75 minutes - yes an hour and 15 minutes - to cook a hamburger medium rare? The previous visit was about 3 months ago when it only took 45 min to get my hamburger while the other 7 people in our group were finishing their dinner.  The manager did give me a $25 gift card and said he was sorry for the experience.  Well - I finally took my gift card to try again.  An hour and 15 min after we phoned in our order ... I finally got my luke warm burger and the rest of the order came out.  While I was waiting for my food I saw a waitress drop a plate of food and just pick up the plate and walk back to the kitchen - leaving the food on the floor - IN THE MAIN WALK WAY!  The bartender actually came out to pick up the food but the grease on the floor was never wiped up!  Dangerous and unsanitary!   I asked to speak to the manager and waited for about 10 minutes just to find out the manager was ""on the phone"" so I left my business card and asked that the manager call me.  14 hrs later I am still waiting for that call.   Is there anything less than 1 star?"
Megan B.,"Portland, OR",6,33,1,1.0,12/20/2017,"Ok, we love the gluten free options for burgers and pizookies. But the service here is horrible, especially at night. The staff has actually said to me that the kitchen is too busy filling orders for DoorDash and GrubHub, and they get backed up... meaning I'm left waiting for over half an hour for a burger and pizookie. Honestly, the food isn't good enough to balance out the hassle. Adding: Downgrading to one star because after waiting for an HOUR in the parking lot my order came out without the sides, and the waitress gave major attitude when I pointed out because she ""has no control over the kitchen."" The broccoli she brought me was less than a full floret."
Douglas H.,"Fremont, CA",4,57,71,3.0,1/7/2018,"I have been here several times and it has been pretty consistent in food, staff, drinks and service. It is a pretty large place with a bar area and table area which are connected. When you see the outside and inside you would expect more in quality and quantity. They have several items on the menu but not as extensive as you would think. The beer and wine selection are okay and as well as the quality of the food. The staff are nice and service is good but it is not up to what you would think for the atmosphere and price. Good place to go for a Sunday lunch and check out for the first time if you have not been here"
Julie C.,"San Leandro, CA",376,653,175,4.0,12/10/2017,"This is a 3 star chain with a 4 star dessert. One Pizookie is positively pleasant but the Pizookie trio is the ultimate perfect(a) trifecta.  But let me back up and review our entire visit.   I  have visited BJ's in the past but my daughter was drinking from a sippy cup so it's been years.  BJ's is located near the 880, near Newpark Mall, neither of which inspire us to brave the nasty traffic.  But I had a $50 gift card burning a hole in my pocketbook(hurray for work raffles) and the hubby wanted to get his complimentary Veterans' Day meal so we decided to enjoy dinner with the fam on BJs.  Our server was cheerful and laughed at the hubby's wisecracks. We started with the yummy chicken pot stickers.  I was super impressed by my veggie Peruvian quinoa bowl. How many chains can boast a tasty, healthy meal?  The kidlet gave her spaghetti and garlic knots kid's meal good reviews. The hubby enjoyed a Crispy Jalapeno burger. And then the amazing dessert.   Our timing was perfect(arrived around 4:30) because it was a Friday night madhouse as we were leaving."
L N.,"San Jose, CA",66,147,13,5.0,12/30/2017,Service was much better today. We ordered the same food and it was cooked well. And the Brussel sprouts weren't burnt this time and We actually received the srichacha sauce this time. Our order was good
Alicia Marie P.,"San Jose, CA",216,226,82,3.0,11/11/2017,"Cons:  door dash took forever, said the restaurant took forever to prepare just 2 meals. Burger ordered arrived cold and gross, I'm guessing they made that first and it just sat and sat waiting for the other meal.  Pros: Honestly the shoshito peppers with pepperoni is mind blowing. I could live off that dish.  It's highly salty but so delicious."
Sandra O.,"Fremont, CA",0,3,,4.0,1/10/2018,"Fabulous menu and something for everyone.  So many choices had a hard time choosing.  Guess I need to go back to try the other choices.  I had  garlic pesto chicken pizza which was amazing.  Booths are really comfortable and away from the bar area which can be noisy.  Or, enjoy the bar seen.  Truly something for everyone!"
Dominique E.,"Fremont, CA",20,47,46,4.0,7/26/2017,"Bj's is a good restaurant overall. They're reasonably priced and their food is pretty good!  The only reason why they received four stars, instead of five is because the portion of calamari we got tonight. My friends and I paid around $11 for calamari, but only half the long skinny plate it was served on was full. The other half of the plate was filled the two sauces. If I'm being charged $11 for a plate of calamari, I expect to get my money's worth not a couple of pieces.. lol.  Anyways, overall my visit was good. Especially, thanks to our server Michael!! We came in pretty late and he was still really attentive and nice. Thanks Michael!"
Victoria E.,"Union City, CA",6,19,17,2.0,12/14/2017,"The service is always slow. We often have mistakes with the food. I love the handcrafted sodas, but food quality is poor. We ordered the chicken club sandwich with fries and the spicy pig crispy flatbread pizza tonight. The chicken club bread was charred, not toasted, the bacon was very dark, the bread was soggy on the bottom, floppy fries and everything was luke-warm. Chicken should be served hot. The crispy flatbread on the other hand was not crispy at all; in fact it was completely raw in the center with barely cooked edges. We sent it back. It came back raw in the middle again. On previous visits we had a problem with hair in the food."
Denisse Z.,"Hayward, CA",2,9,2,1.0,1/6/2018,"Wow this was the most infuriating experience I've ever had. We get sat down waitress Joyce takes like 20 min to come take our drinks. We order everything at once because she already took forever to come to us we just wanted to eat. We finally get our food and my order comes back wrong. By the time she comes back with my food everyone at my table is already done eating. She does not come over once to ask if we need anything, the other waiters had to come help us. She finally makes her way back to us only to drop off a water! Doesn't even ask if we needed anything!!!! It was ridiculous! I was waiting for ranch for another 15 min!!!!!! Then it took us a while other 30 min to be able to get out of there! I asked for a box and she comes back with no box but eager to grab the money. I was so aggravated I didn't even eat my food"
Kwee K.,"Fremont, CA",0,27,4,2.0,12/18/2017,"Went in on a Sat night,  the wait was about 45 minutes to 1 hour, was not too bad. But, as we waited, we wanted to check out the menu, so we can ordered our meal quicker, and they gave us this menu book that filthy, somebody mashed potatoes was on it and book was oily..yuck.. So, we finally seated, ordered quickly,..and our food was arrived 30 minutes later, and one of the order was wrong..  I understand they were busy, but for sure this is not a great experience at all, especially that when we're seated, it was at the end of the queue..They are trying though, so that is why 2 stars not one..."
Christina T.,"Stockton, CA",129,30,67,4.0,11/24/2017,"Alright! Let me start by saying we had a party of 30ppl celebrating my nephew's bday. My SIL was able to reserve an 8:00pm dinner time.  We had 2 tables and 2 waitresses. SERIOUSLY, THEY WERE AMAZING! We were seated at 8:00pm, had our food by 8:30pm, were singing ""Happy Birthday"" at 9:00pm, bills paid and done by 9:40pm! The only food complaint was a little bit of a dry steak. Other than that, everything else was amazing; honey chicken crisp salad, CA club sandwich, tacos, ribs, salmon, appetizer platter -- TONS OF FOOD!  One soda was flat - they promptly replaced it. Of course there's going to be some hiccups with a big party! But, our service was good! I was pleasantly surprised considering my previous BJ's Brewhouse experiences in my home city has been less than pleasant."
KE M.,"Stockton, CA",6,12,,1.0,12/15/2017,"The worst BJ's I've been to. I was with a party of 6 and we were quoted a 20 minute wait time. 45 minutes later, we still were not sat at a table. I asked the hostess and they stated they were putting menus down. We finally were sat down at our table after a 55 minute wait and speaking to the manager. The manager didn't even apologize or care after we stated the wait time was completely inaccurate. We could of went elsewhere if we knew we would have to wait for almost an hour.  Then, when our bill came, we were overcharged for the drinks the next table ordered!  So beyond unacceptable!"
Alex V.,"Milpitas, CA",70,60,18,2.0,11/28/2017,"I usually like this place, but this was my first time at this location and it wasn't a great experience. The service was very slow and when my flat bread pizza finally arrived to the table, the entire middle was cold and under cooked. I noticed I wasn't the only table having issues with their food. other tables has sent back burgers and chicken for being under cooked."
Missy H.,"Fremont, CA",69,16,,1.0,11/18/2017,"This is a long one so bare with me: Previously, I would have given BJ's a 4 star. Their food is very consistent. We've dined in, Door Dashed and picked up to go previously with no big issues. We usually end up waiting about 5-10 minutes for take away orders. And honestly if I hadn't dealt with the manager at every turn in this experience, I would have let this go but the manager couldn't care less so I'm hesitant to go back. Last night, I put in an order at about 4:50PM with a scheduled pick up at 5:30PM. It was a Friday night so I expected them to be busy and they were. When I arrived with my one year old in tow, there was a gentleman in front of me and behind me and we all paid for our food and sat down to wait.  45 minutes later (almost an hour and a half after the order was placed), my one year old was getting tired an hungry so I stepped up to the counter and told the manager who had rung me up that I'd like to cancel my order and get a refund because I was leaving.  Like magic, my order was ready but we were just waiting on my salad. I had been watching the counter and hadn't seen them bring food out in a while, which meant our food had been in the warmer a while and no one was checking it. I was out the door within 5 minutes of trying to get a refund but when I got home, they had forgotten our appetizer.  I called right away and spoke with the same manager - you know, the one who rang me up, the one I told I'd been waiting 45 minutes, the one I asked for a refund, THE ONE WHO PACKED UP MY ORDER WHILE I STOOD THERE. I told him I was the one who had waited 45 minutes and that he forgot our appetizer. He told me he remembered me and that it was still in the warmer. His only offer was to make me a new one so I could come pick it up. What?!  I advised him that I had a small child who was getting ready for bed so that wasn't possible, to which he said ""well you paid for it,"" and I replied ""yes, I did.""  Silence. I sat there gave my husband an eye roll and he said ""what's going on?"" Still silence. Finally the manager said ""well, I could adjust your bill,"" to which I said ""thank you"". A few things bother me about this: 1 - if I were dining in, I would have been served faster than I was with a take away order  2 - Why did the manager panic when I asked for a refund and throw my order together? If losing customers is a concern, keep up on the to go orders and don't make people keep waiting if their food is ready. 3 - Why was the manager so hesitant to refund me for something HE personally forgot to put in my order? 4 - He only addressed half of my complaint because in what universe is it OK to give someone a 40 minute pick up time and make them wait 45 minutes beyond that?  If I hadn't asked for a refund, who knows how long I would have been there. The gentleman who paid before me was still there when I left, though his food was probably sitting in that warmer..."
Stephanie L.,"San Jose, CA",8,10,17,4.0,1/2/2018,"I've been coming to this location a lot lately because it's close to work.  I always order a salad which seems like it should be easy to put together, but they always end up looking like a sad and disappointing salad. I've order take out from the one close to my house in San Jose and its always perfect with the perfect amount of salad,chicken,onion strings and everything else is should have. I decided to give this location one more chance and today the salad was perfect! Fingers crossed for my next visit."
Mar M.,"Union City, CA",44,100,31,1.0,10/23/2017,Went to get some take out from BJ's and ended up waiting almost an HOUR for my food. It wasn't overly packed as well. The manager didn't seem to care that I've been waiting and passed me off to an assistant. This place usually has okay service but it's definitely been slipping as of late...not surprised they're down to a 3-Star rating. So after forty minutes I ask the waitress and GUESS WHAT...the food had been in their warming drawer for the last ten minutes...they didn't bother to check whose order it was since I was never given an update.  You don't treat your customers like this. Managers and staff were terrible...JUST TERRIBILE.
Mel G.,"Oakland, CA",11,187,235,4.0,11/19/2017,Second time here since they pretty much opened up the place. My buddy brought me for my birthday and j had the lemon parm crusted chicken. First time it came out raw gave it another Chance and it was yummy. We had the flight which all were pretty good to me but one. Dessert was delicious. Pretty much had a way better experience with the food this time around than my last time. Luckily I got to give it another chance.
Mika B.,"Newark, CA",132,181,1068,4.0,10/16/2017,This is probably the third time I've ever been to this restaurant. I came here to have lunch with my old coworker who retired so we kept it simple she had breakfast and I myself had a Caesar salad and a ham and cheese melt. Ryan our servicer was really nice I asked for no sauce for this no sauce for that and he accommodated me. The order was perfect but I have to say that the food was pretty much like black bear or IHOP maybe a little bit better than IHOP.  The restaurant was very clean we were seated really fast and since it was Sunday it was actually pretty busy. I have to say that the one thing I find a bit crazy; the menu is literally an Encyclopedia I think they really need to cut down the size of their menu it is way too big so it takes a while to figure out what you want to eat. So on to the food itself the Caesar salad is a Caesar salad but was actually really good and the ham and cheese grilled was not bad however I found it a little bit oily and the French fries were really good. I really appreciate the fact that Ryan came back and fourth to the table asking if we needed anything and always kept our drinks filled so I have to say customer service is definitely top-notch over here. They really do pay a lot of attention to their customers and I appreciate that and they don't leave dirty plates all over the table but clean it up as soon as you're finished. Since we sat there and talked for a while he never came over and disturbed us and made us feel that we had to rush out of there and I really appreciated that per say the four stars! Thank you again BJ it was great having a chance to catch up with my friend in your restaurant
Robert W.,"Patterson, CA",1668,147,857,2.0,1/15/2017,"We arrived around 4 pm on a Saturday during the NFL playoffs. Surprisingly we were seated right away, thought there would be more people to watch the games. We sat at a table in the main dining area. About 5 minutes went by and no service. We realized that during playoff games they have happy hour specials, but in the bar area only. There was plenty of open seating in the bar so we moved. We were greeted right away and had the specials explained to us. During happy hour all draft beers are a dollar off and cocktails are $2 off. All appetizers, including the huge sampler are half off along with the mini deep dish pizzas. To start, we ordered drinks. Our first two beer choices were not available because they were out. My wife's second beer choice was also not available because they were out as well. We ordered the large appetizer sampler which comes with avocado egg rolls, chips and artichoke dip, BBQ boneless wings and cheese sticks. That was enough to feed us right there. Didn't realize how big it would be, we ordered 3 mini pizzas as well. The mini pizza is nowhere near as good as a larger deep dish. They were a little over cooked and minimal toppings. Overall, this is the worst Bj's I've been too."
Diann U.,"East Bay, CA",411,190,1183,4.0,6/29/2017,"Usually go here for late dinners with the bf or fam. I really love their steak, I think it was the rib eye steak or something. But yes very filling and delicious!!! I also like their stuffed mushrooms :) Best times to go is late like 9ish during the weekday not crowded that much and can be seated right away depending on how many is in your party."
Robert B.,"Union City, CA",0,15,3,1.0,11/20/2017,"I ordered a Pepperoni Extreme and there was absolutely nothing Extreme about it! Hardly any pepperoni, NO SAUCE and just a sprinkle of cheese. I doubt I'll ever go back. I'll just go to Shakers pizza instead, at least it will cost less and I'll get a decent amount of pepperoni on my pizza."
Mark G.,"Fremont, CA",98,170,126,4.0,7/17/2017,"This is like any other BJ's. The food is all the same from place to place. The food is generally good. The servers are always what makes or breaks your dining experience. Call ahead and watch the bar to see if you can swoop on seats. This past time we were here we had Jose as a server at the bar. He was fantastic and was quite personable. He made sure that we had everything we needed/wanted. At the same time he was just an overall cool guy to talk to. He was efficient, which is the main thing I care about when dining. I drank the stout that was only there for a limited time. It was fantastic. What I also like about what this company is trying to do is that they are trying to have different types of whiskeys. They are branching out from the normal, my fiancee got angel's envy in the past and today a whiskey she has had in the past that I forget the name. I have had experiences where the service stunk. We waited due to the server or the food took forever. The drinks also depend on who is making them, so the bartender at the time. Overall you will have a good experience depending on the server and how efficiently everything else is running. Pending that, this Bj's is good. Its really a flip of the coin."
Nicole G.,"Union City, CA",183,316,470,4.0,12/30/2016,"Standard chain restaurant.. you know what you're getting.  This location is always busy due to the limited selection of the TriCity area and/or game night.The menu is large, but has been condensed.  We were lucky to get a table at the end of the bar. The only thing I did not like was the servers and staff cut through that section which is small and my food is right there.  The margarita pizza was good, but the ahi salad was even better. I would recommend the salad if you have not tried it."
Preet S.,"Fremont, CA",32,3,4,1.0,11/13/2017,"This was the wurst experience I had here. Pizza crust was completely uncooked. Manager took the feedback for future but no action today, lol. Let's see what would improve in future. I know there service was always bad but food use to cope up with bad service but now with both food and service being bad I don't know if they can be boy survive on Booz and desserts."
Angela C.,"Union City, CA",13,14,5,1.0,5/23/2017,"On Sunday 5/21 around 6pm. my husband and I went to the Newark, Ca location to have dinner.  My husband ordered a small pizza, pepperoni extreme I believe. We weren't given plates or utensils so when the food arrived he was just gonna eat it from the pan. When he took a slice what looked like a glob of cheese fell from the slice. At closer inspection, we realized it was some sort of condom or finger protector. We were absolutely horrified and disgusted!  For one, this is extremely unsanitary! Condom or not, it didn't belong on the pizza and is just plain dirty.  Who knows what type of bodily fluid was on it. Semen, blood, sweat, puss?? Who knows!?! And two, this could have been a huge choking hazard! Good think my little niece wasn't with us.  The manager came out and was absolutely speechless. He said he'd look into it. We never found out what it really was or how it got there. You can't tell me as an employee, you won't notice that your finger protector went missing?? Especially while working with food??? Not that I'm a person that tries to get stuff for free. I have a job and make money to buy my own things but we were only comped for the contaminated pizza. It was such a horrible and traumatizing experience. They remade the pizza which my husband agreed to. Personally I wouldn't have eaten it.  I want to make sure that this incident is really taken seriously! I want to know that it really was investigated. Are the employees properly trained in food handling??? Is it a disgruntled employee??? Should health and safety or food inspectors be contacted or sent to this location??? I was in shock at first and just laughed it off. But after the shock wore off, it really pissed me off. I don't think I could ever eat at this location again."
Julia L.,"East Bay, CA",550,287,591,3.0,11/17/2016,"I came here with a small group on a late Saturday night to grab some appetizers and drinks. I wasn't surprised that it was busy, but luckily we didn't have to wait long since we opted for the bar. My party and I ordered wings, fried calamari and a deep dish pizza, all of which didn't blow me away. Drink wise, I ordered the Irish Root Beer. It was really good. You couldn't taste the alcohol at all, making it very dangerous. Overall, I'm not highly impressed with this BJ's, but at the same time I didn't have high expectations anyway. Food and drinks are average. Service was extremely welcoming, but delayed. I like how BJ's offers an extensive menu and I like this location, but honestly I am not interested in returning anytime soon."
Nohemy C.,"San Jose, CA",19,212,204,1.0,10/13/2017,"DO NOT COME HERE FOR FOOD IF YOU LOVE FOOD. The service was actually not too bad here although they seem to get really busy so it can take quite a bit to get anything. I am upset about the damn soup. I was sick so I couldn't eat their pizza or burgers so I ordered their chicken tortilla soup. First mistake was that they were out of bread bowls-at 4:30 pm on a Friday!! Come on, people! Second mistake, I paid $7.25 for a freaking 3 ounces of flavored broth with six mini pieces of avocado and some cilantro sprinkled on top. There was 1 bite size piece of so-called chicken and some sprinkled chips. Pathetic beyond belief. This is why I hate chain restaurants. Come here to drink, eat elsewhere."
Ami F.,"Fremont, CA",1,10,2,1.0,12/27/2017,"The worst service. Slow, non responsive servers. A bowl of clam chowder, side salad and a flatbread took over an hour to get (after flagging the server and two other servers down). Flatbread wasn't even cooked all the way through. It took forever to get the check which in fact they did comp most of the meal, but the server not once ever checked on us nor explained the problem during our meal, but yet asked us if we wanted desert LOL....All I wanted to do was leave.. I have tried giving this place a second and third chance to no prevail. Will NOT come back here."
Aide P.,"San Bruno, CA",17,2,1,5.0,11/12/2017,April was my waitress and she is amazing very great i recommend this place the best service and again April made our experience enjoyable
Mike T.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,148,13,1.0,10/2/2017,"This is another of those places that are absolutely horrible, in terms of service. I asked what size of beer they have.. They told me the only have 16oz..alright..not according to the menu.. Then I asked for bread.. No bread. Then we asked for a pizza with light sauce.. They told me is not possible because it is ""embedded"" already in the though. So bottom line, frozen food all the way."
Robert G.,"Hayward, CA",5,2,,1.0,1/1/2018,"I did not like the food that I ordered it was burned. First, we waited for two hours for our appetizers. After a very long hours of wait our food was served cold and burned. I am very upset with this place. I should've never came here for my birthday dinner."
Rc C.,"Newark, CA",7,19,25,1.0,12/22/2017,Waited too long and when asked front booth she has no knowledge of what seating was made.
Katie C.,"Milpitas, CA",198,108,32,5.0,6/3/2017,"TLDR; Based on the reviews below, I think we just got super lucky with the service and food! Service:  Friday nights seem to be super busy here but we still got awesome service! The food came out super quickly. The waitress came to check up on us very often and she was very friendly and helpful. Food: Omg the guac burger was AMAZING. The fries were amazing and crisp. I couldn't fit the burger in my mouth at all. I will definitely order this burger again! If you buy soda, definitely try their root beer! Sweet, but with undertones of vanilla and ""i dont know what but it tastes good""."
Joseph S.,"San Jose, CA",116,1306,2413,3.0,6/21/2017,"More like a 3.5 star.  The beer selection is the highlight of the place, from Blond to Stout, from Brown to Red, and everything in the middle, I can't get enough of it.  The food, is just ok, we ordered the Sriracha Dry Rub boneless chicken and Hot and Spicy Buffalo boneless wings. Well,  the Dry, the Rub and boneless are there, but I have no idea where the Sriracha is, it is just chicken nuggets. The Hot and Spicy is really just chicken nuggets with Tabasco sauce.   Service is great.  Overall, standard chain restaurants, good place to meet with a group, but nothing special."
Max R.,"San Jose, CA",1,3,,4.0,12/21/2017,This is a good location. I do recommend it if you have a free night and  are looking for a big pizza or want to try the pizooki. Go on Mondays because they currently have a deal where all large deep pizza were 50% off
Alice L.,"Fremont, CA",161,11,6,3.0,5/4/2017,"Came here for BOGO free entrees on a Thursday night and it was decently full, but we got seated right away. Food: I got a full rack of ribs, with steamed broccoli and mashed potatoes as my sides. The ribs were a bit dry and over salted, but the sides were pretty good. I also got a peach iced tea, but it tasted like Lipton instant tea and barely flavored. Service: Our server was very nice, but forgot to bring my drink for ~45 mins. We tried to get her attention, but she must have had too many tables to watch over since she was walking very fast and passed us a couple times.  Would come here for the weekdays specials and deals, but probably wouldn't come for full priced entrees."
Janet D.,"San Jose, CA",104,1216,1381,3.0,3/29/2017,Just came here for their Monday 50% off of large pizza specials and am so sad I did. The quality of the pizza was way below average and it was super super greasy. I am sorry I decided to save myself some money and went that route. Will not be back for this pizza special again. And the pizza was super salty. Sad panda!
Mars S.,"Fremont, CA",968,410,295,2.0,3/21/2017,"I don't know what it is about BJ's. I've definitely had a handful of enjoyable times at the restaurant, but at the same time, I've also had an equal number of less than satisfactory visits.  Although their food is better than Applebee's and Chili's, BJ's has never wowed me and can overall be completely hit or miss. Sometimes, I'm 100% happy with my meal, while other times it's just completely off. For example, once I ordered the ahi tuna appetizer and it was pitiful, coming out with 3 pieces of avocado instead of having it piled on like the menu's picture. Another time my friend ordered the sante fe salad and replaced the chicken with salmon as she does not eat meat. The salad came out with both salmon and chicken which was odd, and she ended up having to send it back to the kitchen. In terms of service, again, I've had an equal number of visits that it's been just fine and other times where it's been awfully slow. Overall, for the price, inconsistency with food/service, and the always ridiculous wait times, BJ's is not the place I'd suggest going with a friend given all the amazing new restaurants that are popping up in Fremont/Newark. Additional things worth mentioning: - Lots of cool beer options. I'd suggest taking a seat at the bar with a couple of friends instead of indulging in a full dine-in meal with a larger party as that's where BJ's tends to mess up more. - Huge parking lot, but it's always really full. Make sure to not leave valuables in the car as it's an area that's targeted. Thankfully, they have security guards now, but better be safe than sorry."
