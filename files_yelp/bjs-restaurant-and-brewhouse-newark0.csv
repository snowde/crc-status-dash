Naomi C.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,1,,1.0,2/28/2017,"I went to BJ's on 2/25/17 for a birthday dinner/celebration with a group of around 11/12. This was, by far, the worst dining experience I have had EVER! I mean, I've had better service, experience and food from McDonald's. I encountered the rudest ""manager"" (using this term extremely loose here) I've ever come across in all my dining experiences. Awful! For the large party we had only ONE waitress waiting on us. This is very unusual for a large party especially since our waitress had two other tables and the other table's party was almost as large as mine. While our waitress was very attentive to what we needed and made sure to ask us if we were okay every chance she could, the food she brought out was either wrong, incomplete, cold once it got to us or missing something. After watching this young lady hustle and juggle my table and the other two she had AND watching about three other employees just stand against a wall and watch her, I encouraged a ""manager"" to come over. The ""manager"", Brandi, came over with an attitude and very defensive (unwarranted). I tried to explain to Brandi what was going on and asked if she knew that our waitress was the ONLY one serving us as well as the other two very full parties and, with the great attitude (facetiously stated) she had replied ""I do. So what's the problem?"". The problem is that, BJ's managing style displayed through Brandi, totally caused this young lady to just about fail. This ""managing"" style set her up to fail while other employees set back and watched and nobody tried to help her or display any amount of team work. Brandi, the untrained manager, then stated ""I don't want to argue with you"". Absolutely uncalled for! Argue? Not a single person at my table raised a voice, displayed any amount of defensive, aggression or actions one should be alarmed by, so this, was extremely insulting. Extremely! Brandi proceeds to ask me ""how can I  help you"", I stated, verbatim, ""get her some help"". Her reply was ""I don't do any serving and I'm the only manager here"". I again stated "" Get her some help. I didn't ask you to serve"". What kind of managing style is BJ's adopting here? A manager can't roll their sleeves up and be a teammate? She is absolutely disgusting in this role and should not be one to represent BJ's...at all. This ""manager"" tried to blame our server when it was NOT the server's fault. BJ's manager, Brandi, totally failed her. This managing style totally failed her. The kitchen totally failed her. BJ'S FAILED HER! I am disgustingly offended at the fact that I've freely given my hard earned money to a company that's totally okay failing it's servers. A company that has such a manager in position who can't see past a title and play the actual role. From ONE MANAGER TO ANOTHER: Brandi, you should have played the roll of the manager, pulled up your sleeves, assisted where needed, called a meeting with ALL staff and adjusted so the immediate needs of your customers AND staff were met. You failed both your staff and our party. Lastly, I am, even more disgusted that, the would be celebrated young lady didn't even get her meal and all this ""manager"", Brandi could say was ""I wish this experience could have been better for the both of us"". AWFUL! UNACCEPTABLE! Tell me again how this night wasn't well for YOU when WE patronized the store YOU ""manage""? And received nothing? I'll wait. If anyone wants great service, drive down a little bit on Mowry where there is a Chic-Fil_A. Managers are AWESOME and customer service is extraordinary. In fact, it was the MANAGER at this place that brought me my milk shake. Save yourself a bad time out, AVOID BJ's!"
Joshua L.,"Union City, CA",17,4,,2.0,5/3/2016,Unfortunately the standards at this BJ's have gone down.  I won't be coming back for anything other than the bar.  - Lost food and drinks - Some meals took over an hour -- half the table was finished eating before other meals came out - Incorrect orders - Very small portion sizes when compared to bj's 6-8 months ago.
Ariel H.,"Manteca, CA",137,12,2,5.0,7/20/2016,"Last time I came I had a bad experience with our waiter. I put it aside as my aunt wanted to take me out for my birthday dinner. It was a Sunday night and the hosts said it was about a 10 minute wait for the two of us, it ended up being more like 20 but being someone who has hosted before and now serves, I know what it's like so it doesn't bother me. Once sat we waited maybe 5 minutes before being approached by our server, Amber. She immediately gave off a super sweet and chill vibe. She gave us great service and had small chit chat with me over server life. Great service, great food. Definitely an improvement from the last time I was here. Thank you Amber!!!!"
P P.,"Fremont, CA",84,26,1213,3.0,3/10/2016,The reason I came here again Bcuz my bf wanted to try small pizza with chicken and all meat
Tom B.,"Westfield, IN",28,217,729,2.0,6/6/2015,"Yeah - I wasn't terribly impressed.  My pizza was OK, but nothing to write home about.  The truth is, this place didn't stand a chance in the pizza department, after the places I visited last week in San Francisco.  Overall service was decent, but my one complaint would be the noise level.  Not to sound like an 80-year-old, but does the music have to be that loud?  Couldn't even carry on a cell phone conversation when my wife called - had to step outside, even at full volume on the phone and my other ear plugged.  I felt like I was at a concert, not a restaurant.  Special note to the Marketing firms that advise chain restaurants about how ""lively"" music creates a more inviting restaurant:  The reality is that it doesn't.  It just makes the place loud.  Just my opinion..."
Robert S.,"Redwood City, CA",0,16,,2.0,7/4/2017,"We tried BJ's for the first time. They atmosphere and menu looked really good, but unfortunately the food was disappointing. The over-stuffed sandwich on the menu turned out to be mostly bun and very little meat. Very, very little meat! The fish had much larger portions, but was very greasy tasting. All-in-all we were disappointed with the meal."
Tram N.,"San Francisco, CA",810,215,303,3.0,6/15/2014,(+) Avocado Rolls. I may or may not have been dragged here just because my friend was dying to have me try this appetizer and I have to say it did not disappoint. The portion was HUGE. I was actually pretty full after this dish. They were definitely generous with the avocadoes and the sauce complemented the rolls perfectly.  (+) Mahi Mahi/ Shrimp Tacos WITH SOME AMAZING CHIPS AND GUAC. If you're looking to go with something light for dinner then I would definitely recommend this.  You can mix and match or get both of the same ones. The portion might be considered small if you tend to eat a lot because there's only 2 tacos but it was pretty filling for me! Super fresh seafood! I was pretty full after this. OH and the chips / salsa & guac was perfect.  Customers service was pretty good. The waitress was super patient with us even though we literally took 15 minutes to decide on what to get. We came for a pazookie but did not get a pazookie....
Omar L.,"Pittsburg, CA",4,66,101,4.0,6/17/2016,Came during lunch time and ordered the bison burger along with the Buffalo chicken grilled cheese sandwich and they where both very tasty and waitress was really nice.
Benny H.,"San Jose, CA",2026,1460,8032,4.0,6/2/2014,"Sometimes I can understand the low scores a restaurant and sometimes I cannot.  This is the case of the former.  First, the burger melt is die for. It's no longer on the menu, but they still made it for us! So they have already graced my heart with approval. It's a good meal, despite being very very and I mean very unhealthy. Mighty tasty though.  Lots of beers. So if you like beer then check it out.  Not a perfect restaurant by any means, but much better than the 3 stars indicate. Give this place a try and don't the reviews sway you as they are a bit off."
Puneet G.,"Fremont, CA",1,2,,4.0,7/7/2017,"Reliable and consistent in food quality and service, I can't ask for more from a chain restaurant. Oh yea it great that the game is always on..."
Cristina R.,"Fremont, CA",0,9,4,2.0,2/7/2017,"When first arriving to the restaurant I was so disappointed I wanted to just walk out. The hosts in this location are absolutely rude and inattentive. You have 3 hosts at the reception desk and yet none show a warmth and friendly welcome, as you would receive from any other family restaurant. I stood in front of the reception desk literally for 2 minutes before the hosts acknowledge my arrival. I was told to follow the hosts, just to find the my table is still dirty and the table had not been properly cleaned. We stood in front of our table with the host waiting for our table to be cleaned. The hosts never apologized and said ""we have been really busy"". I literally looked around and saw less then ten tables with people. I was offended to be lied to literally in my face. Her incompetence to assist is far below the standards of BJ's and I am honestly surprise that management settles for less.  The waiter who assisted us was very genuine and caring. Her upbeat attitude makes me feel like this place as a chance of survival. She shared her recommendations and was patient. The food came out at a decent time and everything was hot and steamy. The crispy flat bread nachos and the boneless chicken wings were my two favorite appetizers. The flat bread was crispy and the toppings are evenly spread. Every bite was an orgasm in my mouth.  If you go t BJ's you are obligated to get a chocolate chunk Pizookie for your dessert. Cookie perfectly chunky and warm. When leaving- the hosts just gathered at the Reception Desk ALL on their cell phones with their heads down. None of them welcomed us to come back. I think the management needs to really investigate in training their hosts with proper standards for customer service."
Veronica V.,"Fremont, CA",0,3,3,1.0,1/28/2017,Dinner was great but the server wasn't. We went on the website and saw that there was a free poozokie with any $10 purchase so we asked for it. The server (Jessica) acted confused and was looking at it like it was a made up coupon. It was pretty embarrassing to have her question a coupon that was clearly on the website. She then gave said okay and we got our dessert. We got the check and the coupon was not applied and she acted like she wasn't aware of it then proceeded to say that maybe you need a bjs reward for it. Nowhere on the coupon did it say that you needed a rewards from there. She should have honored it because it was a coupon from the website. I hope next time they know their website and don't embarrass people. Not coming back to this restaurant again.
Gwyne P.,"Union City, CA",549,181,220,3.0,6/10/2015,"We were seated pretty fast even though it was a busy night. More than usual. I usually come here after training. I really like the atmosphere & the dim lighting. When we sat down, it took forever for our server to come. Our hostess didn't even tell us our server's name. We waited a good 10minutes for our server to come but we had to ask another server to take our order. Food was about 10minute wait. I ordered the seared ahi tuna salad. It had too much vinaigrette dressing which made it a bit sour. I ordered this before and it wasn't as sour. I also ordered the calamari, but they ran out! Which was sad considering I was pretty excited for it.  I also ordered the beignet with vanilla ice cream, but there was no vanilla ice cream! They offered the chocolate ice cream but we decided to cancel the order. When we did, the manager came over & told us that the vanilla ice cream just arrived & they were going to give it to us complimentary. Which was nice of them. The beignet was warm with a crispy outside & an soft inside! The ice cream was a good portion & I enjoyed the strawberry sauce.  This wasn't the best experience I had whenever I come here. It was a bit disappointing. But I'll come back again & see."
Nathan B.,"Keauhou, HI",0,2,,1.0,10/15/2016,"Never met such an unprofessional manager. Was there Saturday night with friends, had some issues with an order asked for the manager to stop by, think her name was Brandi. Had to ask 3 separate times over 30 min. End state was her saying well what do you want me to do and rolling her eyes. It was not even a big a cold meal and didn't have time to wait because we were catching a movie. Granted  the place was busy but that does not excuse her attitude. Our server was however very nice and communicated well with us."
Leanna T.,"San Jose, CA",446,15,5,2.0,12/28/2016,"My server was so inattentive. I forgot her name but it took her way too long to take our orders. Once she did, it took a while to bring out our alcoholic beverages and then she didn't even bring us our waters until maybe fifteen minutes after that... We ordered everything at the same time so we should've gotten our waters first. The food took forever to come out and one of our entrees came out before one of our appetizers did. After eating all our food, I asked to see a dessert menu and she didn't even check back in to see if we wanted any. I had to order it from someone else after failing to flag her down several times. I've been a server before so I know it's rough sometimes, but it wasn't even that crowded at the time. I love BJs but I probably won't be coming back to this one."
Edna G.,"East Bay, CA",574,749,8705,2.0,3/21/2014,"Finally rating after 7 visits....if it wasn't for the food, I would not go here. Expect to wait for your food or service.  My experience has not been so good from expecting 6 co-workers asking for a jalapeño burger and they ran out of jalapeños during lunch! Forgetting my drink, order or side many times! Took 45 min for 4 people's food! Taking forever to get you the bill!!  Love their trio Pizookie and root beer drinks as that is the best part! Easy to customize your food, if you get it!? If you are taking your time, go here as their service is super slow; it took two hours for our lunch today....good thing our work is not as mindful of our time but then again, I was with a manager...."
Janessa M.,"San Francisco, CA",194,146,256,4.0,8/14/2015,"Our waitress Jennifer S. Was lovely and put up with our table lol the drinks are decent, food is good. Good environment! Like the lighting!"
Shaunice P.,"San Bruno, CA",0,16,5,1.0,7/19/2017,"The service is terrible. Server stopped by twice. Once to take my order, 2nd to bring my check. My food was gross, and my pizookie cold, my ice cream didn't even melt."
Ria S.,"Hayward, CA",0,7,1,4.0,12/21/2016,I love the clean environment. And the food was delicious plus their hand craft drink was good.
Omar R.,"San Lorenzo, CA",64,344,1387,3.0,7/12/2015,"To begin with our wait time was about the standard for a Saturday night so my friends and I decided to go for broke and play roulette with the bar and hope to land a spot. Luckily we made it to a small table that seated us just right. Plan was just to kick back a few and celebrate with friends.         Our waitress greeted our group immediately and took our orders, to start with we ordered some chicken wings along with a pitcher of beer. Upon arrival of our wings we noticed that they seemed a little undercooked so we asked our waitress if we could send them back to which she obliged and was apologetic. Not too bad, she was very cordial but that was the first strike. Second hiccup on their end was the fact when we ordered calamari it seemed to come out a little under proportioned, I didn't want cause a stir but a friend tried to question the waiter who brought them out but to no avail what was done was done. The waiter who brought them out didn't give any expression, but looked more puzzled then anything. Luckily we had great conversation and tried a couple of their brews, nothing to wild and our waitress was patient and helped with most of our needs. Great time out and caught some of the ball games."
