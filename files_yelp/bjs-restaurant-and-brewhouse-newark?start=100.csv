Nicole M.,"Union City, CA",24,5,3,3.0,9/7/2017,"Service is good although food and menus suck. They changed the menu a while back and I was completely bummed. It's as if they revised everything to incorporate ""healthy"" options. Some items include barbacoa cauliflower pita tacos, yuck. What happened to regular tortilla? I now usually avoid eating here because the lack of good food options."
K. D.,"San Leandro, CA",1,72,6,5.0,9/14/2017,"Food, Desert and Service..... We enjoyed everything. The beginning was a little ify with the hostess not wanting to seat us were requested but..... Rosario to the rescue. Also from her order taking, recommendations, food served piping hot, never an empty drink glass, she is definitely a keeper. If she isn't a shift lead promote her now and don't let her get away. Thanks BJ's and Rosario, We'll Be Back....."
Thanh N.,"San Francisco, CA",11,22,6,2.0,11/17/2017,"Customer service is alright, food variety isnt as exciting as it used to be, now food orders are horrible. The few times i decided to grab food from Bjs and probably 3/5 times there super late. I ordered about an hour ahead each time, deciding to pick them up after some errands, and a few times i ended up getting my food AN HOUR later. Very disappointed. Food is good though, but sometimes they mess up up the order like forgetting to add chicken to my foos, or forgetting the sides"
Swetha V.,"Sunnyvale, CA",0,9,,4.0,9/6/2017,Deep dish pizza was the best on the table. Just loved it!! Boneless wings were too salty:( pasta was good but not exceptional. Pizookie tasted awesome:) being a  desertarian I cannot say the desert was bad;)
Ellen M.,"Aptos, CA",10,100,,4.0,6/29/2017,"Good food, huge menu, nice decor, great wine list. Bar is very nice with a friendly but unobtrusive bartender. Easy place to meet friends and have dinner while in Newark."
Bradley H.,"San Jose, CA",463,397,1,4.0,12/8/2016,"I really enjoy this place! The environment is always upbeat, they always have a good selection of drinks on draft (well, it is a brewery of course), lots of TV screens with a good selection of channels, friendly wait staff, and pretty decent food. Some of my favorites: Seared Ahi Salad--at times can be a little too acidic, but the avocado and the Ahi help to cut the acidity, and it is actually a pretty healthy salad (many salads at these bar places are worse for you than the burgers). All you can eat soup and salad lunch special--you can pick and choose from any combination od their soups and salads.  They usually have some light soups, some creamy soups, and some hearty soups--perfect to go w their house, cesar, or wedge salads. Grilled Fish Tacos--only comes w two, but the serving size is actually quite filling along w the chips.  I recommend the grilled fresher fish over the fried frozen fish. Avocado Egg Rolls--love these for an appetizer.  If I am w a slightly larger group, I like the sampler that gives a bit of everything for everyone to try without spoiling the meal. Happy eating!"
Sharim S.,"Hayward, CA",39,33,83,3.0,6/30/2016,"I used to go more often when I lived in Fremont but times have changed since then. It's even more crowded and I assume it will only get worse once the condos next door get built and the mall is fully renovated. So expect a long waiting line. Came here twice in the span of 2 weeks and had fun both times but the first time had a 30 min wait and the second time an hour wait...yikes.  The food is a bit pricy but heard no complaints except for my friend who said her pasta Alfredo was dry but I love their beer here and their other entrees seem like good quality. I ordered the kale salad and was very satisfied with the taste, not at all bitter, and the appetizers were yummy. My main complaint is the service is very slow but the bathrooms and tables were clean and the atmosphere can get fun since they are very good about showing all the sporting events."
Anu P.,"Santa Cruz, CA",0,11,9,3.0,4/23/2017,Went to this place on a Saturday night with friends. Food was really good.  But very slow serving. Appetizers came after the main course. They dint even give us any plates for the main course.Soup came last and it was cold.  Overall the service is really bad.
Jonathan Y.,"Roseville, CA",0,87,25,3.0,8/26/2017,Normally I don't visit all to many chain restaurants but I have to give some praise on a particular appetizer. The Brussel sprouts with Sriracha were awesome. Other than that same old stuff
Aditi M.,"Chicago, IL",494,123,240,4.0,1/28/2016,"My friends and I have a strange and undying love for this place. Perhaps because we've been celebrating birthdays, graduations, and literally everything else here since we were in high school :')  The bar is huge and they have about 1,000 TVs. The food is enjoyable probably because it is literally packed with calories and fat...and my meal is ALWAYS followed by a chocolate chip pizookie, which likely has more calories than the previously mentioned meal. You will leave here in a coma.  The pizookies are my favorite thing here. I absolutely love them. They are perfect in every regard. Normally, I would probably give a restaurant like this 3 stars, but BJ's in Newark has a special place in my heart."
Kevin N.,"Union City, CA",7,7,9,5.0,10/20/2016,"Me and some friends wanted to get a late dinner after studying all night. Came through and got seated right away. Usually when I come here its super busy but I guess since it was close to 10pm, it dies down a bit. Our waitress was very nice and would check on us frequently to see if we were doing alright. I just had a birthday last week so I was treated with a birthday pizookie. I definitely enjoy the food here. Normally when I come here, I would order their jambalaya. This time I just got their hot and spicy wings and they were great.  When in the area, BJ'S is probably one of my top picks for dining. It's great for sport events. Plenty of parking spaces. And they keep the restaraunt clean."
Theresa G.,"Fremont, CA",152,541,2614,3.0,12/19/2016,"Big franchise restaurant and franchise feel. Lits of space and tables. The menu huge all kinda of plates but us foodies know that, that usually means they make no signature dishes or delectable choices. Too many options, too many variables. We ordered  some appetizers that were at most-ok but service was nice and efficient. Place was packed on a Friday night yet food came quick-hence 3 stars. Problem the food was lacking luster and flavor all around. I bet if the food actually tasted better it would be 5 star. Bummer. Yet we ate because we were hungry but left lots of food. (my dogs ate it the next day-they loved it). The table next to us was the same! Plates full of food unfinished-what a shame! Would go back for beer and appetizers nothing else. I must say that the manager was very professional and attentive and wanted to make things right. Kudos! She comped 1 of our pizzs. It was suppose to be Chicago deep dish and OMG not even close- was like a Expensive little Cesars pizza with less sauce (insert annoyed emoji here). So yeah the food was repugnant."
M H.,"San Jose, CA",0,26,,2.0,8/31/2017,"I've been here a few times. Place is always packed, with long waits, and scatterbrained and exasperated servers. Really long wait times that favor those who call-in over those who have showed up in person--and staff will tell you that to your face after you've been waiting for twice as long as you've been told you would.  Waiter tossed food on the table, our ""made to order"" pizookie came out in five minutes, far before our entrees. We were starving after our hour wait, and had two hungry children with us, so we ate our dessert before our dinner.  Food is fine. It's not great, and it's not quick--unless it's the pizookie. But it does the job."
Melissa Nicole N.,"Newark, CA",364,94,193,2.0,11/14/2016,"Great appetizers and beer! My BF and I shared the ahi poke appetizer and a pitcher of Jeremiah Red, super yummy!  It's a shame that my experience was great here... but what I saw can never be unseen!!!!! I saw the bartender make some sort of strawberry drink. After she shook the drink, she looked at the drink with big eyes and pulled out a set of keys...crazy right?! Then instead of throwing it out and making a new one... she added more ice then sent it off with a waiter!! Because of this I stared her down while she filled up our pitcher! I am NOT taking chances!!! Such a shame because I grew up eating here and it makes me wonder if I have ever been treated like that before, hopefully not! ):"
Paul N.,"Fremont, CA",0,8,,1.0,7/14/2017,"The worst take out service - If they will even answer the phone!!!!! We have weekly offsite meetings for 10-14 people. All the other restaurants love our business and encourage it with good service. On numerous occasions when attempting to call in the take out order, the phone was not getting answered, and when it was I was put on hold and they hang up. I had to call the BJ corporate offices just to get a return phone call from the branch manager to take my order for 14 people. This is the last time. They are a bunch of idiots. Consider your options carefully before making a bad choice"
Jules W.,"San Jose, CA",3,96,,2.0,1/5/2017,"I'm so sad to report that I will NOT be returning to this location. The last two times I came I had to return my drinks... Last night I had to do so twice! I just gave up. One of the bartenders  thought they were being smart by replacing my weak ass long island for an even WEAKER one thinking I wouldn't notice the difference. He must have been on something good. LI drinkers know what to expect, as a bartender you should have known better! Two things about me you should know, don't mess with my FOOD and don't you dare serve me a BS Long Island. 7 liquors in that bitch and I can't taste ONE? Fk out of here. Really? They gave me a carbonated lemon-aid! You know it's probably one of the most  (if not, the most) expensive drink on any menu so please miss me with that.   It definitely wasn't our waiters fault however he wasn't much better. He could have apologized for, 1) me having to send back the first drink 2) me having to send back the second drink 3) when our salads came, asking us a BS question like ""Oh, do you not have utensils?"" ( Do you see any? Your salads aren't that great that we're gonna sit there and stare  at it!) 4) Give or take, just being a monotoned as waiter. No smile, no real greeting, not really attentive. Maybe he was having a bad day, I get it. However, when your customer is clearly unhappy, the least you could do is apologize. Not because it's your fault, but because your team is messing up and therefore messing up your tip! Your money! Ain't nobody got time for that. But it's obvious to us that you could have cared less.. and that's fine honey. So, we up and left that bitch. ( Bj's, not him LOL) We ordered apps which were probably already in the making that we never got. That went to waste. The two drinks that I had to send back went to waste, tho I would have been happy with them just making it proper by adding more liq instead of making two weak ones. The salad that we got but never ate went to waste.  So good job you've wasted all of those items Bravo!  Went to Elephant bar, had a REAL drink and a REAL waiter and ended up having a bomb ass date night regardless. I believe everything happens for a reason, even shit like this, and I was meant to have a wonderful waiter and proper drinks that night. So Thank you. P.s Extra star for the delicious water that was brought out pretty quickly. At least that didn't go to waste."
Donald H.,"Oakland, CA",1,20,10,4.0,3/20/2017,"Only gave it a 4 because the floor is ridiculously slippery here. Not sure why or what causes it but it's definitely a safety hazard. I always enjoy the food and atmosphere whenever I visit this location. My last trip was excellent and our waiter by the name of Benjamin was really cool. He noticed my Dragon Ball Z shirt and started to geek out which was awesome. They were extremely busy at he time and I could tell he was tired when we first sat down, but the shirt seemed to rejuvenate him lol. I'll be back soon but please fix the floor issue."
Ter L.,"San Jose, CA",186,821,8639,4.0,9/7/2015,"Came here to meet and catch up with a girLfriend who happened to be in town. We met up on a Sunday night at 8:30PM and parking was absoLuteLy terribLe. I was not abLe to find an open spot even after circuLating muLtipLe times. If you don't mind a sLight waLk, there is additionaL parking next to the Firestone tire shop (strictLy for BJ's customers). There was a twenty minute wait for our party of two so it was a busy night to say the very Least. The first thing you notice is the open space, the cLeanLiness, and the amazing bar. The food was good and the customer service was even better. Our server was very attentive but wasn't overbearing.  I wouLd definiteLy come back if I'm in the area- it's not convenient driving from San Jose when there are two other BJ Locations in my area.  BUT Kudos to this Location for giving me the best experience I've had, Keep up the great work!"
Isela S.,"Fremont, CA",1,8,7,1.0,3/12/2017,Ordered a grand deluxe guacamole burger well done for curbside service and this is what i get.. an uncooked NOT well done burger. Disgusting. I always have good things to say about BJs but this is the icing on the cake for me. The cook just slapped the burger on and flipped till the outsides were cooked and said it's done. This is UNACCEPTABLE. DISGUSTING. NOT COOKED!!! I contacted the manager and he said he will email a gift card which I have yet to receive any email about. But a gift card is not enough for this raw burger.
Bobby S.,"Fremont, CA",0,11,11,5.0,11/9/2017,Great food and drinks. Must try the deep dish pizza!
