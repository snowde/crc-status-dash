Justin K.,"Atlanta, GA",4,14,,5.0,8/3/2009,"this location of 'BJs' in Newark, CA is a class act. While              mistakenly walking in the ladies room (i thought it was the mens room) I saw an employee do a line of what appeared to be cocaine.  But besides that, I will comment they have some of the best beer and wings in Newark!"
Foodierock n.,"Fremont, CA",20,80,6,1.0,5/15/2009,I had been to the BJs in San Mateo and had loved it. The one in Newark is not that good. We waited for more than 1 hr to be seated even though we put our name on the list by calling them. We were in good mood so I didn't mind it. The place was overly crowded and the waiters have it out of control all the time. Once we got seated our food arrived in 30 minutes. The potato fries were not crispy ( that's the only thing you expect from fries really) The pizza was OK and not hot and so was the pasta.  The Pizzokie was also mediocre. Moreover the waiter just kept avoiding us when we wanted to order. He was more interested in the new parties that were coming in.  The total hours we spent at the restaurant - 4 hrs. Was it worth it? NO.
Olivia N.,"San Ramon, CA",1,2,6,5.0,7/13/2010,"We came here for our friend's birthday dinner on July 4. It was an early dinner and it wasn't very busy. We had a huge table by the window to accommodate 20 of us including kids.  Our party started with a flight of BJ beers (7 beer sampler), appetizer combos, shrimp lettuce wraps and a couple deep dish pizzas. All of them were delicious! For entrée, I had Harvest Hefeweizen paired with Santa Fe salad. I enjoyed it very much.  The servers were attentive and friendly. They did a great job keeping our drinks full and orders straight! The manager even came over and asked if everything was ok. All and all we had a great time here. Thanks to the free birthday pizookie with a candle. We were able to sing Happy Birthday to our friend! I would recommend this place to everyone."
Ha N.,"San Francisco, CA",261,131,63,3.0,12/6/2010,"The only thing I come here for: one word. PIZOOKIE! 887 calories. Enough said, I FAIL"
Omid M.,"Fremont, CA",65,78,1,2.0,1/30/2010,The food is okay. Ghetto type of a crowed hangs out here. Its like a bar with okay food.  I know they have had problems with cars being broken into and fights in the parking lot.  The only thing that is great here is the PIZOOKIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That is the only reason I will go back.
Helen H.,"San Jose, CA",23,16,36,1.0,11/11/2008,"I work not a mile away from BJ's and very excited that it's finally opened.   Opening night, I got there early with a coworker, 5:00 pm and the place was crowded already.  We found a table next the bar and the waiter took his time to greet us.  He went over the beer menu, which was nice, and took our drink order.  He did not come back for a little more while before he took our order (I expected it), so problem.    After he took our foods order, he did not come back to check on us.  We waited for over 45 for our appetizers and finally we had to track another waiter to get our waiter.  When he came, he said, ""hmm, foods are not here yet,""  and he left to check to on it.  As it turned out, he never put the order in!  The manager came, apologized that his staff dropped the ball on us, jokingly, and offered us desert; well, hello, we have not had anything to eat yet!  We decided to leave and asked to have our bill, for a beer and an ice tea.  At this pointed, we both expected the manager to comp our drinks, but NO, and they took forever to come back with our bill.   We walked out of BJ's with shattering disappointments!  I've been driving by the restaurant every day with anticipation for its opening day and now walking away with regrets!   Do NOT come by until this place open for a year when they get their act together!  Very disappointing. Horrible."
Miss H.,"San Francisco, CA",262,324,262,3.0,12/12/2008,"Recently opened -- how exciting! But besides that, it's your standard BJ's. We went at a random in between lunch & dinner time, so we were quick to be seated and our food came out fast. Our server started off by telling us that we were sitting in a ""bad luck"" booth since the kitchen already messed up that booth's order twice -- good to know? Luckily we had no problem with ours, but I could imagine the service to be a little sketchy during busy hours since they've just opened."
Jennifer D.,"Hayward, CA",27,67,21,5.0,11/2/2011,I love their pizookies!!! Chocolate chip cookie and vanilla ice cream...I cannot go without eating this!! I dream about them!  Their service is really good and they let you try as many beers as you would like.  They have a great selection of beer too!
Alex R.,"Phoenix, AZ",52,70,1,4.0,2/8/2009,"An unfortunate name for such a good place. My friend suggested we go to this place because its his favorite place. I had not heard of it before so I figured it was worth a try.   I walked into this place and was impressed. The high ceilings and open layout of the restaurant were really nice.  I was even more impressed when my friend had told me that they brewed their own beers. Sadly this trip I didn't try any but I will next time for sure. I decided I was in the mood for chili. My friend wanted appetizers and said I had to try the pizza. Knowing full well I was going to Yelp this place I decided to go with it all and just sample what I could.  The chili was delicious. It was perfectly cooked with a little bit of spice. The top was covered in a layer of melted cheese with a dollop of sour cream in the middle and some chives. Perfect toppings for chili. We got the appetizers sampler thing with spinach and artichoke dip, avocado egg rolls, santa fe spring rolls, mozzarella sticks. The appetizers really weren't that impressive. I ate all my mozzarella sticks but left most of the rest on the plate. It's not that big of a deal to me because I rarely order appetizers unless its nachos.  On to the pizza. At first I almost waived off the pizza entirely. I mean it said it was deep dish pizza and I figured it couldn't compare to Zachary's or Patxi. Plus the pictures did not look like the deep dish pizza I had had before. When the pizza was delivered I shoveled out a slice grabbed my knife and fork and dove in. I was impressed their pizza was a much doughier version of my previous experiences with deep dish. It has a big puffy crust with very little sauce and then is loaded with cheese and toppings. After the first bite I was a fan. I sat there trying to convince my stomach I wasn't full and could finish my slice and have another. It was an uphill battle but I managed.  During the course of our meal my friend said that this was his favorite restaurant and wanted to come here for his birthday I told him he totally should and do it on a night i don't have class so I can go. He agreed. So hopefully some time next week I will be able to go back and try a burger and get a sampling of their beers."
GG U.,"Walnut Creek, CA",11,17,1,2.0,6/18/2012,My second visit here since it opened.  First visit was about 2 years ago and after going back this I remember why I didn't make it a place on my list of favorites.  Very long wait for the food. People that came in after us were served their food before we were.  Portions are small for the price.  Same as the first visit.  Food is okay. I had the fish tacos and I have had much better at a fast food place.
Jojo N.,"Pleasanton, CA",736,430,188,5.0,7/2/2009,"Okay, so my last review was harsh, but very true. I came here last night with my gf, (the same friend that went with me back in January) We were very impressed with our server Mark. We sat at the bar and was prompted a table right away. Mark was very attentive and friendly. We ordered the Avocado Eggroll without cilantro and split the Giant Baked Potato which satisfied us. They even got our avocado eggroll right--WITHOUT cilantro! Then we got the Pizookie White Chocolate Macadamia which was divine! When I asked for a to go box, Mark made sure he gave me an extra side of Alfredo sauce for my leftover. We really really liked Mark a lot. Definitely will come back here again PS! They have 2 Happy hour deals! Great deals on appetizers and beer!"
Alicia L.,"East Bay, CA",152,83,118,5.0,2/1/2009,"I absolutely Love BJ's restaurant.  This is probably my favorite restaurant; not because of the service (because their service really isn't the best since they are always so busy), but because of the food.  Their food is Awesome. If you ever go to BJ's you MUST have the Pizza.  Their pizza is the best damn pizza I've ever had next to California Pizza kitchen.  Also try a Pizookie (A cookie with ice cream on top of it) because that is super delicious too.  They've got happy hour, a really big screen for all you sport fans, and ultimately the food is just great.  However, not a great fan of the service, but it's not too bad.  I just go for the pizza and pasta mostly."
tracey l.,"San Jose, CA",113,106,29,3.0,10/27/2011,"This place is solid to come here for lunch. The deals are good. I usually get the half sandwhich with half soup/salad and you get fries with it. Its a lot of food for 7 bucks plus tax and tip. When BJ's first opened up, the service was really crappy, but it has gotten way better. Their pizookie is the BEST. If its your bday you get a free one! :D Their pizzas are mainly deep dish and you can share making the price pretty good. Overall solid place, not my favorite bar, but definitely good to go during lunch. If you are on a diet though, don't bother to come as its high calorie dishes!"
James N.,"Union City, CA",790,387,1096,3.0,9/11/2009,"BJ's are famous for their Chicago style pizzas. So what did we came here for? Of course the pizza. My sister was raving about this place so I wanted to come to see for myself. I'm quite amazed at the size of the restaurant everything is so huge. Even at one size of the restaurant my friend spotted some.  We had ordered avocado egg rolls which came in with the sauce. I quite like the appetizer since it had us get ready for our pizza. We had ordered a half BJ's Cheeseburger Pizza and a Mediterranean Pizza. The Cheeseburger pizza is surprisingly good. Mediterranean Pizza however is a bit too strong for me the pesto sauce and blue cheese is overwhelming.  Service was a little inconsistent since we had a waitress who was still under training. However, the waitress definitely is working and not slackin or anything. Food can be better but is rock solid. 3 Solid Stars."
C M.,"Fremont, CA",0,12,14,4.0,6/11/2012,"I honestly don't get the crazy over the pizookie but nonetheless the staff has been friendly and service is good. Everytime we order their pizzas or other entrees such as the cajun chicken pasta, we haven't seen any faults in it. The best part about the restaurant is their late night hours on the weekends!"
J N.,"Fremont, CA",0,77,13,5.0,4/12/2012,I went here for the first time last night. This is a real nice place to eat and have a beer. Atmosphere is very contemporary and the prices are reasonable. I ordered the Deluxe burger and it was really good. I also tried the Piranha Pale Ale which was really smooth for a pale ale. I liked it. The only complaint I have is that the waiter we started out with thought he was cool so he didn't write down our order and to no surprise screwed it up. My wife asked for no onions and she got onions. And I asked for a glass of water and he never brought it.
Agnes G.,"Hayward, CA",0,11,,1.0,5/13/2014,"I was a fan of this place when it first opened a few years ago, however throughout the years their quality has deteriorated. I ordered a veggie pizza and was eating it with a fork and knife, fortunately enough, as a was cutting a piece off, a piece of sausage popped out of the crust. The manager did not charge me for this however it did make me weary of the place. My other experiences were not great as well with my food being cold. I have given up on this place."
Ben Y.,"Fremont, CA",0,5,,3.0,8/3/2012,"Their beer is better than the food. It's not bad, just average. I do like their fish tacos."
Annie M.,"San Jose, CA",7,22,11,1.0,2/3/2009,"ABSOLUTELY the worst service!!  We drove from Tracy to take my mom out for her Birthday Dinner.  We decided to go to the new resto across Newpark Mall only to experience the worst service we've ever experienced in restaurants!!  When the hostess sat us down she offered us the beer menu and I said no but can I have a coke, she replied ""I would get you a coke but I'm not your server"" and left.  She didn't even reply by telling me she would let my server know.  She was pretty rude!! The place wasn't so busy since it was a Monday night.  When our server finally showed up, we placed our orders and when our meal was served, no ketchup, A1 Sauce or hot sauce was delivered.  Just the plain salt and pepper on the table when we arrived.  When I asked for the A1 sauce, she gave me a dirty look and walked away.  Instead of us enjoying my mom's birthday, our conversation was just about how poor the service is and how our server was rude and her facial reaction was unacceptable.  Aside from my brother in law joking about how the hostess made me feel stupid about not being our server, our waitress being rude didnt make the birthday celebration a celebration.   After we finished dinner, I asked her about birthday celebrations.  She said rudely that they don't do the singing thingy, which was fine with us but she didn't have to respond so rudely.  She described the birthday cake and asked if we wanted the dessert menu.  She gave me the dessert menu and took forever to come back.  She was fast on delivering the bill though. When she finally came around about the dessert, we lost our appetite!  Paid in cash because it took her forever to get the bill and we decided to pay in cash instead of Credit Card.  She's lucky we gave her a tip.  WIth that service, I will NEVER come back to this resto.  I'd rather wait 3 hrs for a table at Claim Jumpers since their payback is excellent service! venue:  The resto is nicely decorated! lots of space and not crowded.  Seems like they've put so much effort into the decor of the resto and absolutely NO TIME on training their servers!   Only props was to the bus boy who didn't complain and had a smile on his face.  We asked for a plastic bag for the to-go box the waitress forgot to bring us and he got it right away.  When we asked for a refill, he didn't reply by saying he's not our server.  He got us another refill with no sarcastic look on his face. I don't recommend this place!  THEY NEED TO WORK on their SERVICE.  I'd hate to name names but our server was REALLY aweful and she ruined my mom's birthday celebration with her rude service!  The receipt said our server is Chantell B. OMG! I just tried calling the resto to speak to the manager (to complain about how the server RUINED my mom's birthday Dinner)  and when I first called, it rang 3 times then someone hung up and the second time I called someone named Erica answered and I asked for the manager.  She was really polite on the phone but I was on hold for more than 10 minutes.  5 minutes too long I'd say!  I forgot who I was calling for being on hold for so long."
g s.,"San Jose, CA",8,141,3,4.0,4/5/2012,Great place for happy hour!  Wonderful selection of beers and cocktails. The appetizers are discounted $2 and drinks are off $1. The pizza was awesome and the crust was light and fluffy.  The fried artichokes were great.  Large restaurant with a nice sports bar area.  Back dining area can hold large parties up to 100.
