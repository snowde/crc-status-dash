Glenn Q.,"Fremont, CA",0,30,,4.0,7/26/2012,"Great beer, great food, quick, interesting staff. Went there for a birthday celebration, and will end up going back often.  Defintely try the Jeremiah Red if you like a great ale with less hoppy bitter than an IPA. But I cannot suggest one food item, because everything has been top of the scale, so don't worry. It was great for a one-on-one in the bar recently, and great with four of us (including a baby) on the 4th of July. Highly recommend, and folks I went with said ""This is a new favorite""."
Evan T.,"Newark, CA",10,34,4,1.0,12/21/2008,"So i went here to celebrate a birthday and well... we didnt' reserve in advance but 1.5 hours wait for a BJ's?  It's not like this place is a high class restaurant or anything.  i've been to the bj's in cupertino and that place gets  a thumb up from me since its got decent service and the food is aight. So this newark location... well I dunno what it is.  Perhaps it speaks to the quality of people in Newark/Fremont area, but the service here is absolutely awful.   I'm a simple guy, and when I don't know what to order, I usually order what the place is known for.  So since its a brewery, a beer and possibly a burger or pizza.  I decided to go with the calzone, and i asked the waiter what he'd recommend in terms of beers to compliment what I ordered.  He recommended a beer that he liked, but when i read the description it wasn't something recommended for a pizza-type dish.  I was whatever about it. So i had a party of 4, and everyone got their food in a relatively reasonable time... everyone 'cept me.  The person that brought the food to our table wasn't even our server and I asked ""what about my food?"" and of course he didn't know what i ordered and he said he would go check on it.  Never came back. Halfway through my party's meal, I said...alright 10 more minutes and if nothing happens, I'm taking off and the bill's on them. 7 minutes rolls by and our server comes by and i'm like...uhh i got nothing from what i ordered. He said.. umm, what did you order?  I told him and he walked off to 'check on it' and he said... its still cooking.  i'm like right, probably just started.  Finally he came back with my calzone 5-6 minutes later and i was like, ""umm and my beer?"" It was already too late.  My meal was messed up.  I should have at least gotten my beer at the beginning, and now i have to rip through it with my meal, instead of enjoy my meal in peace. When the bill came, i told him, 'i'd like to at least be comped for my beer"" and the server already knew it was coming and took the bill away even before it hit the table.   This place has got a lot of work.  The area is a deadzone anyway, with failing rasputin and closing mervyn's.  I would expect the servers to know their customer's order, and know how to at least check on their customers.  This guy did not and i found myself flagging out other people's servers to check up on whats goin on.  This place pales in comparison to other chains and is not worth the hype by far."
Noky C.,"Fremont, CA",47,81,1,3.0,11/13/2008,"BJ's is all about compromise. I came here around 5pm on a Thursday night and it wasn't too busy. Took a seat at the bar and ordered a 4 beer sampler ($5.75); all of which were quite disappointing. Pumpkin Ale- watery and bland with a faint aftertaste of canned pumpkin Nutty Brunette- tastes like a slightly skunked New Castle PM Porter- watered down Guinness with no carbonation; literally like half Guinness, half water Tanaka Stout- undrinkable; I'd imagine this is what shoe polish would taste like While I tried to consume these barely drinkable beers, I ordered Angus Sliders since it was still happy hour and appetizers are $2 off (half off mini pizzas and $1 off pints). The sliders were excellent; like miniature In-N-Out burgers (I'm a sucker for all things in miniature). I upgraded my 4 beer sampler to a 7 beer sampler ($9.50) so I can finish off my mini burgers. The results were the same; disappointing beer. Brewhouse Blonde- imagine Bud Light with a faint nutty aftertaste Jeremiah Red- New Castle with a kick (7.3% alcohol) Harvest Hefe- imagine watery, over-carbonated Widmer's hefe I recommend sitting at the bar. Big screen tv to keep you occupied, quick service, free samples, and best of all, no pushy waitress rushing you through your beer / food. Their in-house beers were disappointing, but they carry a vast amount of other beers (draft and bottled craft brews). All of which are reasonably priced from $4-$6 a pint. Combined with a large selection of food and big screen tv, this place is a great hang out.  To sum up this long drawn-out review, keep it simple. Sit at the bar, order a pint of Guinness (or other outsourced brews) and some appetizers. For heartier food, stick with burgers and pizzas. Great place to hang out since they have a large selection of food and beverages; hence the 3 stars. It's a compromise.   ----- More on food: -deep dish pizzas are far too doughy. Thick mushy-soggy bread with toppings; some liked it, I didn't. Go with the thin crust pizza's from the appetizer section. -giant baked potatoes are just that; HUGE!! Looks tasty and filling with all the toppings, but I'd be in a carb-induced coma if I finished one.  -spinach dip appetizer was disappointing; think grocery store jar of spinach dip and a pile of stale tortilla chips."
Henry C.,"Fremont, CA",98,116,8,4.0,11/16/2011,"I've been to BJ's about 6 times, I've had no issues with the food at BJ's for the most part. The food I've had there: about 4-5 different kinds of pizza there (all good), I had the meatloaf (decent), Pulled Pork bbq sandwich (really good), Salads are (okay/avg.), a lot of beer to choose from. the only thing I could say negative about BJ's is the service, its hit or miss at times."
Jennifer J.,"Fremont, CA",127,59,2,4.0,11/26/2008,"I love all the BJ's and I'm UBER excited there's one close to home. Maybe the reason I've had nothing but success in all my experiences at any BJ's is because I always sit at the bar. I just hang out and watch TV until there's a table available for me to snag.  I love their beer - probably because it's so sweet. They have a little known option of 'mixing' the beers.. my favorite is the PM Porter with the Berry Burst Cider. They float the porter on top of the cider so the glass looks so pretty!!! Their food is pretty good. Really good pizzas and burgers, fair appetizers - overall just good straight up bar food. Of course, there are the pazookie's, which are the reason I fell in love with BJ's to begin with. Warm gooey cookie topped with melty ice cream... how could you go wrong?!? If you want to have some drinks and watch a game (or 10), BJ's is the place to go."
Sandy C.,"Fremont, CA",307,54,7,4.0,11/24/2008,"My hubby, brother and I came here for the first time last Friday to celebrate my brother passing the CA bar!! WOOHOOO!!!  We had such an awesome time scarfing down pizza and beer and appetizers....  We got two mini pizzas so we could try different types, potato crisps, and a few rounds of beer samplers... wooo! ...Awesome combo for ultimate guilty pleasure satisfaction. =) The BJ's haters need to relax!!!!  This place just opened and it's jam packed for good reason!  Whiners say... ""eww greasy deep dish pizza""  well you know what I say?  YUUUUUM!!!  I'm all about the deep dish pizza!  I love how it's thick but has a nice crunch to it.  It's not all that greasy but just enough!  If you want healthy food -- go to sweet tomatoes dummies!!! Not only is the pizza awesome, I LOVE the beer samplers.  It's way better than the ones they serve at Rock bottom.  At Rock Bottom, you get these tiny little shot glasses.  At BJ's the beer sampler glasses are much taller.  YAY.  This place sure beats happy hour at hooters with their nasty salty wings.  A nice buzz after work the best guilty pleasure pizza in town 5 min drive from home My only complaint is the long wait to get a table.  It's a 2 hour wait on a friday night!  crazzyyy.... I just ended up getting my drinks and food at the bar.  The bartenders were super friendly and the food and drinks came out fast, maybe because we were sitting in front of them. You whiners need to step aside and take that negativity elsewhere... if the snooty people stop coming it'll be an even happier place with less of a wait."
Leah V.,"Fremont, CA",31,22,6,5.0,3/23/2011,"If you were ask me how I would rate this place a year and a half ago, I would have given it a very low rating.  Although I hesitated to go back here, I just wanted something close to home and the Pizookie's never let me down so I decided to give BJ's at this location another chance. We came here tonight and it was very crowded.  We were told it would be a 35 to 45 minute wait.  We waited and to our surprise we were called to be seated in 20 minutes.  The manager was the one who seated us and he was very pleasant.  It's nice to feel noticed and that is how his friendliness made us feel. Our waiter this evening was Anthony.  Great server, friendly, courteous, and very attentive to our needs.  Always smiling and very easy to talk to which is a plus.  Good vibes, happy staff.  It just makes us want to come back. We are thankful that we were able to have our avocado rolls since the last time we were here (over a year ago) they ran out and I was not happy. And thankful that our order came out exactly as ordered and in good time. Delicious too! Things have definitely improved since my last visit here. Thank you Mr. Manager and Anthony.  Because of your great service tonight we will be back.   Would I recommend this place to my family and friends? Absolutely."
Marsh-Silog P.,"Union City, CA",51,243,2,3.0,11/18/2008,"This rating is more for 3.5 stars.  Now I really can't stand deep dish pizza, its too greasy and not enough flavor....so I thought.  Well BJ's is pretty greasy but I was pleasantly surprised with their pizza.  I don't think it's as ""bomb"" as what people say but it was good and I would order pizza from here again.  Cesar salad sucked though.  The chicken wings with the spicy buffalo sauce was great and so was the white choco macadamia nut pizookie we had.  My husband and I shared a small BJ's favorite with a Cesar salad and my cousins ordered lasagna, chicken pasta and a medium BJ's favorite also....they finished it so I guess they liked it. I only gave the rating because we had 2 dirty plates."
Mike C.,"Hayward, CA",0,17,,1.0,5/18/2011,THIS PLACE IS HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!! Service is awful and the food is mediocre at best. I have been here for lunch and dinner because it is close to work. Every dish tastes the same .........bland.  The pizza is poor compared to other pizza places in the area.  The best thing I have tasted at the restaurant is their root beer. Otherwise try Hooter's or Jack's in Fremont as a sports bar.
J. C.,"Fremont, CA",123,20,7,4.0,11/24/2008,"I loved the BJs in Cupertino.  This BJs is... pretty much the same thing. And now that BJs is here, I can confidently say BJs has the second best pizza in the Fremont/Newark area.  The number one would be Mission Pizza. But BJ's deep dish pizza is a very close second and its atmosphere is superior to Mission Pizza's (big TVs, sports, brewery included, and rowdy young crowd.)   As for the pizza, the crunch and bread in that deep dish is certainly a guilty pleasure and probably very fattening.  But man, what else do you expect?  Wash it down with a pint of their seasonal brew! Of course, having TWO HAPPY HOURS in one day is awesome.  They have a happy hour from 5-7pm on weekdays and another one from 10pm to closing on Sunday-Thursday.  Go then, and the quality-to-price ratio totally fits the bill and is well worth it. Watch out for the crowds though!  For a shorter wait, try to grab a seat at the bar on front of the mega-screen and enjoy the rowdy atmosphere."
Kim-van T.,"San Pablo, CA",163,439,292,2.0,11/30/2008,"I was told this place was relatively new - so maybe they're still working the kinks out ?? i have a long list of complaints that i hope they fix before this place gets burned down by angry customers with torches and pitchforks... i was here for a birthday dinner last night and there were 13 of us - not TOO large of a party. unfortunately something went screwy with the reservations so instead of seating us at 7:30 i think we were actually seated closer to 8:30 (bummer #1). so mostly everyone at the table decided to split pizzas - so they ordered 5 pizzas.  i wasn't that hungry so i ordered the grilled chicken stuffed potato.  i didn't think that the food was coming out that slow - but i guess i was just used to it because i knew we had such a large party and the place was PACKED.  so 4 out of the 5 pizzas all come at the same time and the servers were telling us how lucky we were for getting our pizzas within 20 minutes! too bad the pizza was COLD. and it's deep dish!!!! deep dish has natural self-insulating qualities - how the hell did the pizza come out cold?!  anyways, so we were still waiting on the last pizza as well as someone's chicken alfredo and the server came over and apologized because we had to call him over to ask him to check on the rest of the orders.  he then told us that the manager would be coming out to speak to us and possibly comp something for our patience. talk about being patient! the manager never came out! O-M-G-W-T-F.  one plus, i tried the pumpkin ale - which i actually liked, very light with a hint of pumpkin - i'd recommend trying it.  my potato was also.. luke-warm, although very tasty and HUGE - i could only eat half.   hopefully this place gets its act together. the food is pretty decent - the service is lousy."
S D.,"Cupertino, CA",5,20,,4.0,7/9/2010,"I decided to give a try to BJ's in Newark during Independence Day week end, I was craving for some baby back ribs.  The lunch started with a really good clam chowder which had all the right proportions : lot of clams not too much potatoes, soon after I got the main course of baby back ribs and to my delight it was perfectly prepared : meat was coming off the bone and the sauce was good ! In addition the restaurant was not crowded at all so we were seated right away!"
Jennifer J.,"Oakland, CA",73,35,2,1.0,3/10/2009,"CUSTOMER SERVICE SUCKS HERE! The food might actually be enjoyable if it weren't for the snotty twenty-something's running the damn joint. Me and a few coworkers stopped in for lunch at 1:00 PM and I didn't get my shrimp taco with a side of tortilla chips until about 1:45, please note...my coworkers ordered a side salad with soup! I had to ask the waitress when the food was coming out because I had to return to work and she looked at me like I asked her to bow down and kiss my feet...Hmph!  I will AVOID this place like the plague...or at least until they've been in business for a few years and management steps their game up! Boo on BJ's!"
Kenny L.,"Jersey City, NJ",275,614,25,2.0,2/22/2009,"I like the sampler sets here, $9.95 can get you over two pints of beer.  Problem is, their beers (save for the stout) taste like it's watered down.  Subtle flavors and hoppiness is one thing, but watered down is something different and unforgivable. Brewpubs should have better beer than this.  I am surprised that somebody has finally made a microbrew that tastes like a macrobrew.  The Red, Brown Ale and Porter could have been excellent (nice malts) if the beers weren't watered down. Pizza was in a deep-dish style was was pretty good.  Not because it was good deep dish, but the flavor combinations were adventurous and well put together.  Service was so-so at best. This place has so much potential, but I don't think they will ever fulfill it."
Sherry M.,"San Leandro, CA",46,33,1,3.0,3/26/2011,"This place is always busy. The average wait time is between 45 to 55 minutes. Then again, I was there on a Friday and Saturday nights. I like their beer samplers and appetizers. Save room for pizookie."
Jessica L.,"San Jose, CA",332,79,,4.0,9/18/2009,"I've been to BJ's before in SJ, but this one is near my new house, so we decided to go check it out.  They are usually busy for dinner so there was a bit of a wait, but that's to be expected at most places on a weekend night. We got seated and got a wonderful waiter who made sure we were kept happy and well fed. He talked over beer suggestions with my boyfriend and helped him decide on one that would go well with his meal.  I got the shrimp tacos and they were really good. I also ordered a side salad with the creamy garlic dressing that has now become a favorite of mine. We ordered potato skins and they were the standard fair, nothing special, but good. We had the kidlet with us and she dropped part of her grilled cheese on the floor and they promptly offered to replace it.  Other waiters/waitresses offered to refill our drinks if they saw they were low and everyone was nice to us. All is all a great experience and above standard customer service. We have gone back a couple times and every time this has been our experience. They have plenty of big screens so you can watch the game and a decent selection of beers to try as well as draft root beer, cream soda, and black cherry soda.  The only reason I don't give them 5 stars is because while the food is good, it is standard chain restaurant fair. Good food, I'll eat it again, but not one of those meals that makes you want to run and tell all your friends. I would most definitely recommend this place to people looking for a nice meal in a decent place. The atmosphere is high scale sports bar. Little bit of fun, but a definitely above the average  decor at a chain restaurant.  They have call ahead seating and I highly recommend using it. Beware, not the best place for large groups, unless you plan ahead."
Sandra A.,"Union City, CA",0,2,,1.0,4/30/2013,"I have gone to BJ""s in Newark many times, since it has opened, but today was an absolutely horrible experience.  My server did her job fine.  But my lunch, a french dip sandwich was gruesome.  When it came out it was WELL DONE and the french roll burnt.  Also there was only about 2 thin sliced pieces of meat dried as could be.  They offered to make me a new one, which they did, but by time it arrived my lunch hour was over and I needed to take it back to work.  When it first opened it was top notch, but it has fallen way down.  Not sure I would go back."
Christine C.,"San Francisco, CA",560,279,75,4.0,9/3/2010,"one of the few places like this in Fremont, i like that they have late night happy hour especially since there isn't much to do after 10pm. been here twice before and went last night for a friend's bday. they give you a mini pizooki on your bday! the happy hour isn't completely amazing unless you get their pizza - half off! their strawberry splash is yummy since you can barely taste the alcohol & they do have my favorite belgium beer lindemans framboise. good place to be loud and socialize. i'd still choose yardhouse over BJs tho."
Noe R.,"San Leandro, CA",39,39,6,4.0,12/7/2008,"sorry people i know your expecting some sort of phallic joke but it is just way too easy for this place. But any who... A while back i passed this place up while going to the mall.  I had not herd of BJs before so i had no idea what they served but some friends told me that they brew their own beer. 0.0 Brew their own beer?? hells yea.  For anyone that doesn't know me i LOVE micro breweries so needless to say i was aching to come try it.   I shared a large deep dish pizza with a couple on our table.  Don't remember the exact name of it but i think it was the BJs special or something.  The bread was soft and certain parts were crunchy.  It was delicious.  I also tried the BBQ chicken pizza that another person in our table had.  It was good too but not as good as ours. We also ordered a dessert.  a pazookie i was told.  This dish is one of the best desserts i have had.  Great flavor but had a homey vibe to it that makes you think you can recreate it at home.  Also our service was top notch.  Our lady server was hella funny.  I was talking shit with my friends and what not and she was even giving me some comebacks.  Very cool girl and witty.  Also she gave us some stuff for free and gave us a discount, I'm guessing it was the shit talking and goofing around we did with her. Her service was  5 stars. For their beer... eh i wasn't impressed.  i had the porter and the piranha i believe.  Everyone was talking about how good their beer is and what not.  I'm not going to lie, its good but theirs better places around like buffalo bills brewery.  I do love their bar though.  It is a beautiful bar and huge TV in the middle that splits all the sports games 3x3.  But don't worry, each channel is still great quality, the TV is that big. Overall i love a good old fashion BJs. eh i lied, i love saying sex jokes."
Will S.,"San Jose, CA",98,208,84,3.0,7/15/2009,"After spending a LOOOOOONG time deciding on where to go after dinner, we settled on this BJ's in Newark. Good thing for us, it was happy hour.  So out of all the BJ's I know, THIS ONE has a revolving door. We walked in around 10pm and happy hour seating was scarce. There were barely seats open at the bar and we needed 4 spots. Some guy sitting at the bar was being shady, not wanting to move down one seat so that our group could sit together. JERK. Luckily one of the bartenders pointed out a table open for us to sit. (Good lookin' out).  We all ordered a round of shots first, then moved onto beers. We started off with Patron-chilled. Always good. A friend of mine said there wasn't enough salt on his glass. So he tried adding more to it with the table salt. Haha. It was a no-go but good try.  We followed the shots with a round of beer. I had a P.M. Porter. It was a nice dark beer (usually good for meaty dishes). Mmmm. Real smooth. I forget what kind of beer 2 of my friends ordered but it was a light beer, rather sweet. I had a sip and liked it very much. Another friend of mine ordered a Jeremiah Red. It was somewhat of a dark beer but still had a nice crisp to it. That same friend and I decided to take another shot of Grey Goose-chilled. Seriously, chilled is the way to go. The check was somewhere around $55. But I wound up paying $20, tax and tip for my 2 shots and beer. Quite good, being that it was happy hour. Service was great. Our server kept checking in on us to make sure everything was ok, even if we did just order drinks.  The location was a bit questionable. I pulled up and saw some abandoned building behind B.J.'s with some graffiti and automatically thought ""O...K. Ghetto."" I shouldn't be one to judge but I couldn't help myself.  Anyway, this B.J.'s was nice and perhaps I'll return sometime in the future. But I'm from San Jose and there are closer ones nearby. So maybe I'll settle for those, unless I'm in the East Bay."
