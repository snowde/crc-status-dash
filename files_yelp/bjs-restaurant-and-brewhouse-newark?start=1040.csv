Tim C.,"Berkeley, CA",249,181,27,4.0,11/29/2010,"Great pizza, beer, and pizookies.  Long waits though.  Even calling ahead to put your name on the waitlist does not help much.  BJ's favorite, BJ's red, and any type of pizookie?  Heaven.  And diabeeetttusss."
Keith H.,"Newark, CA",1,11,,3.0,6/6/2012,"Inconsistent. Been here multiple times. Sometimes there is nearly no wait and other times it is insane. Don't make reservations, the BJs franchise as a whole are not good at keeping them. They're often busy and can't exactly keep a table empty for a group who may not show. Food is good stuff despite what others say. Restaurants are often hit or miss with waitresses/waiters and service but BJs is more hit-or-miss than others. But try it for yourself, some people just sound really angry here."
Roopali S.,"Fremont, CA",2,33,,1.0,9/12/2014,Where do I begin. After a long wait I called ahead to be informed that there is no option to reserve seat for three or more persons in advance and i was conveniently added in call ahead sheet or list or whatever that is supposed to be. It was my husband's birthday so I asked them to inform the server to add that in as well. I was told that the request was considered but you need to again inform when you walk-in. I was like OK! Come evening my husband and I with our child check in and are told that unfortunately we were never added on the call ahead list so now you have to wait like all others. On top of that the server we got couldn't follow an ounce of English and brought food in like super late. Finally the surprise never happened I went and asked the manager and he says will take care of it again I wait patiently requesting my husband to sit at the table one way or the other nothing happened. I paid the check and expressed my disappointment to the manager on the way out he didn't seem to give rat's ass. Well so much for loving BJ's. I visited the one in Cupertino so much practically did a project on them at school. Now I feel some other deserving restaurant could have had been my subject of observation. Well never mind I for one am never going back to others who want to venture out all I say is good luck! Manager manager wake up. This action and mismanagement of yours will bite you someday in you know where! Karma is a bitch!
Kermy K.,"Fremont, CA",25,310,,2.0,5/11/2009,Great for drinks and sports.  Not good for food. Their utensils and plates are so dirty. So many times I've found bugs in the glasses or left over things on forks and the benches/chairs. Their food is bleh. I found a hair in the pizza once. Their shrimp in pasta is theeeee tiniest shrimp I have ever seen. I felt bad eating it bc  I thought it musta been a baby shrimp. Forget about counting calories in the food. The desserts are sorry.  Can't recommend this place.
Marcy B.,"Newark, CA",0,11,,4.0,5/27/2010,"Happy, happy, happy!  First time for my sweetie & I - return trip for our friends.  An early Sat. evening supper turned out remarkably well in service and cuisine.  Our attentive waitress was both super cheerful and attended to us perfectly.  Three of us ordered a new menu item, the pulled pork sandwich accompanied by delectable coleslaw and fries.  OK, so forego the sauce on the side as it's way too sweet but the meat is pleasingly tasty without it anyway.  Sampling both ""fat"" & ""skinny"" fries, I loved the seasoned coating and recommend the plump version as the one to opt for. One table member ordered a colorful, attractive, Italian dinner salad, however she found it tasted bland.  She requested a different dressing plus a side of parmesean which were promptly served; she seemed appeased with the supplemental trimmings.  Having advance knowledge of B J's exclusive creme soda and root beer, I opted for the former.  So delicate and smooth, it was nothing like that traditional, harsh grocery store beverage.   Bottom line, the experience was amazingly positive for this Newark chain eatery.  In fact, I enjoyed the meal more than those I've feasted on at the Claim Jumper.  Plus the ambiance is a notch more comfortable too.  We'll be coming back soon as I'm anxious to try out B J's jambalaya!"
Naren C.,"Fremont, CA",0,11,,2.0,5/21/2012,"Not a huge fan of this place and its mainly because of the wait, but also because their food is mediocre at best. The deep dish pizza is nothing like it should be, it should have layers of sauce, toppings, and cheese but its just a buncha dough. They have more than routinely gotten my order incorrect, which I don't really appreciate after having to wait a half hour for my food. At that point it's not really worth sending back and risk it coming back with spit, a half hour later."
Chris C.,"San Ramon, CA",232,294,9,4.0,1/19/2009,"I had a group of 25 here a few days ago. Any group larger than 19 has to be a 'banquet', which I setup a month in advance. The banquet menu has different combinations of things, usually the entree is all you can eat with complimentary soda. I went for the four pizza and added individual pizookies. You get 2 hours for your session, so if you start at 6pm, you would end at 8pm. I had Great White, BJ's favorite, Sweet Pig and another one which I forget as well as the class pizookie. Overall things were fine, the staff was friendly, and we got through round and a half of pizza. They didn't really give me a full-second round of pizzas though, I only remember 2 or 3 of the four getting replaced (maybe they weren't totally empty when they did the swap). Not a big deal, but I went for seconds only to find that there wasn't another Great White. I could have said something, but none of my guests were complaining so I let it slide. Overall, it was a great dinner for my friends, but it would have been difficult had I not set it up in advance."
Emery T.,"Fremont, CA",42,82,,4.0,10/13/2009,"I was really excited when I found out a BJ's was coming to Newark.  The closest one was in Cupertino (which is about 35 minutes away from where I am).  I really like their single serving pizzas.  If you go at a non typical time (say 2 o clock) you can get seated right away.  However, If you go during regular busy hours (dinner time or weekends), you will have to wait a very long time to get seated.  I, personally, have never had terrible service during these busy times.  But I have heard from more than one source that their service is lacking quite a bit.   If you have never been here, you have to try the pizookie (Pizza cookie)!! It's to die for...well if you have a major sweet tooth!"
Rachelle R.,"Fremont, CA",56,69,27,3.0,12/3/2008,"I took away two stars due to my experience last night.  Good 'ol tuesday night...a girlfriend and i make our way to grab a beer(PM Porter, it's my favorite right now) and the bartender tells me that they are OUT of ALL but one of their HOUSE brewed beers! It was such a bummer. It's like going to Baskin Robin's to enjoy the options of 31 flavors and they tell you they are out of vanilla, chocolate, strawberry and chocolate chip??!!  I asked the bartender if he could suggest a similar type beer and he pretty much offered me a Guiness. ew. I could go to Safeway and buy a can. No thank you sir. Here's a tip: Beer comes in on Wednesday's, Tuesday is the WORST day to go. If i would have known ahead of time,  i would have just went to Mission Pizza off Washington Blvd. what i love about BJ's in Newark: 1. PM Porter is a MUST 2. Awesome Pizza...seriously, there is a reason why the pizza is pricey. You get what you pay for. 3. Location Location Location 4. approx. 46 beers on tap 5. the bar television is awesome for Warrior games 6. PAZOOKIE!!!"
Jade K.,"Newark, CA",0,7,,3.0,3/12/2015,"it takes forever to be seated, i understand it gets pretty busy during dinner time but the hostess lie about the estimated time they say it takes about 20 minutes but its more like the double of the time so if you do happen to go there and they say ""itll be like 20 minutes"" just think of it as a 40 minute wait! by the time you get seated it takes like 15 minutes for a server to approach to get you started with some drinks however the food is really good i love their appetizers and is the closet location from my house so over all its ok"
Stephone B.,"Hayward, CA",1,14,,5.0,1/15/2012,Our server was great she recommended beer and deserts that were slammed by my wife and son. We will be going back soon!
Chi L.,"Union City, CA",6,257,26,3.0,11/18/2009,"Ok, when I first saw BJ Brewery is about to open in Newark, I am excited and happy. But I also worry that a lot of time, even with CHAIN restaurant, the fremont version(or newark version) is the worst compared to other location. When this BJ first open, the shrimp pasta dish I got , is not that good,  the pasta is not even 100% cooked(very hard). Now, I went back for second time, after a few months later, food seem to be better. Actually this is one of the good chain restaurant I like. I am glad this location is getting better, but the waiting line could be long even in thursday night, so plan accordingly. The price and portion is pretty good deal in this restaurant.  Beer is good. I am still happy that there is BJ in Fremont/Newark area. Since this Fremont area, usually has NOT MUCH RESTAURANTS to choose from.  Oh, I forget to say the desert is pretty good."
K.D. C.,"Danville, CA",3,53,11,2.0,1/8/2011,Was not impressed with the food. The burger was made of low quality meat. Nice place to watch sports and have a drink but I wouldn't get in the habit of eating there.
Rob S.,"Newark, CA",26,11,,1.0,3/1/2012,"I've been to this BJ's many times only because of the fact of ""going along with it"" The service.. Wait there is no service. The waiters are slower then slow the food is horrible, no really it's HORRIBLE. The only thing good there is the beer and that's not even good. I don't know how that place is still in business. Go somewhere else folks. Go anywhere but there. I wish there were negative stars to give."
Michelle W.,"Union City, CA",187,389,1256,3.0,3/30/2009,"So I have mixed reviews about BJ's. Let me break it down: FOOD - 4 stars. Huge portions, great flavor, wide variety. My favorite are the chicken wangs and deep dish pizza. It's even more delicious during happy hour because appetizers are $2 off and mini pizzas are half off. Even though there's a huge selection of beer, I like their berry cider for HH. And onto their famous pizookies, that alone deserves 5 stars. I used to get the white chocolate & macadamia cookie, until I discovered OREO PIZOOKIE aka the holy grail of pizookies. LOCATION - 2 stars. Don't get me wrong, I've been saying BJ's needed to come to Fremont for years now and I was escstatic when they did, but what's up with opening it up in a run down plaza across the street from Newpark? I know there's going to be tons of remodeling in that area, so I hope they remodel the parking lot cuz it's a lil retarded. I would think Pacific Commons off Automall would've been more adequate. SERVICE - 2 stars. Very mediocre to me. It's a challenge trying to flag them down. One of the HH waitresses tried to rip me off the other day by keeping my change in her folder thinking she was going to get an $18 tip for a $40 tab. Girrrrrl, you must be trippin! Good thing my Chinese math skills kicked into gear and I spoke up when I figured I should be getting $10 in change, or else she would've walked off with my monies. That was shady. I always run into Logan people here. Might as well have a reunion. =)"
Vinay B.,"Union City, CA",8,6,1,5.0,2/20/2012,The best thing to ever happen in Fremont! Go here quite often after a long day at work or for somewhere work discussions! Very friendly staff..great beer.. Could improve on the Single malt collection (hence the 4 stars ;-)) appetizers are gr8 and ofcourse don't leave without a pizookie!
Tiffany K.,"Fremont, CA",904,996,49,3.0,12/7/2008,"Wow, a BJ's in Fremont, well Newark technically? I feel like im in Cupertino!  This particular location is around the same size as the one in South San Jose. Upon entering the restaurant, the first thing I noticed was the rotating glass doors. I thought this was really really odd for a restaurant like BJ's. It doesn't fit with the environment whatsoever, and it just caused unnecessary traffic and issues when the 15 year olds were running in circles and holding the doors so their friends couldn't get through. The service really wasn't that great here... While waiting for a table, my girlfriend and I decided to go to the bar. It took forever to get someone's attention since it was packed - and one of the bartenders just stood there staring off into space, totally not realizing that we were trying to get a drink. One of the bartenders who was actually busy, had to ask her to help us. Our waiter was fine in the beginning, and just totally disregarded us towards the end. After clearly finishing our food, since I left my plate at the end of the table, our waiter just kept walking right past our table not even asking us if we were done or needed boxes or our check or anything. After we finished eating, it took him about 20 minutes to finally come and ask if we needed help. As far as the food, I got a grilled chicken alfredo pasta, and it was okay. my food came out cold. Overall, this BJ's is okay. After trying three BJ's, the Cupertino location is still the best.... however, im gunna have to come back one day just to get a Pizookie. Can't really mess that one up."
Nin R.,"San Jose, CA",22,162,80,4.0,8/9/2009,Love their burgers here. The burger on sourdough roll just kills it. Their spinach artichoke dip is also a great appetizer. I'll give it up to their pizzokie (sp?) though. It's awesome! My friends and I love to order the party size pizzokie. It's about the size of a large pizza. I'd pass on their drinks though. A little over priced. Save yourself some money and goto the liquor store just across the freeway ;)
My C.,"Oakland, CA",86,267,302,2.0,6/2/2009,"If the service was any worst, I'd really need to write an angry letter to corporate or something.. I really wouldn't expect that type of treatment from a chain restaurant.  Our server was absolutely horrible and the only thing giving this review 2 stars is the decent food. First one into the restaurant and last one out, WHY? because our server didn't want to put in our order till all in our parties, though we insisted her to fire it up, had arrived and were ready. But how would the others in our party order if they didn't get the chance to see the menu? I'm pretty sure she was on something because she needed us to repeat ourselves twice on everything.  We saw the food runner/other server WAY MORE often than her.  And to top it all off, her way of getting us out was..""Is this(the check) ready? I have to go home."" We would've been long gone if you had first given us our food 30 minutes earlier on in the visit!  If you ever get the chance to choose your server, stay away from her. I'm assuming she works day time only, blonde curly hair, and looks sort of old.  It seems service is just lacking here after looking at other reviews. I never had a problem with the Oakridge Mall location in San Jose. I'm hoping if I ever go back to this location, the service will be better."
Sophia N.,"Newark, CA",100,96,4,3.0,8/8/2011,"I'm surprised to see that this place has some really high reviews.  I think it's only an alright spot.  The lunch specials for food is definitely a great deal and the tvs while sitting at the bar makes it a good place to catch an afternoon game, but I don't think the food is especially great.  I recently have found that the french dip is very yummy and I prefer their flatbread pizzas over their normal pizzas because the regular ones come with way too much dough.  Their beers are good, but their mixed drinks always come out weak.  I think most people come for the ambiance more than anything.  Eh, I don't hate it, but wouldn't be sad if they closed down."
