Steve T.,"San Jose, CA",62,34,55,4.0,9/13/2011,"this place is nice, like a pf changs or whatever restaurant. we came impromptu to watch the packers/saints game. and got on the waiting list for a table. while waiting some guy came around and gave out complimentary pizza slices. what a nice guy. the waitress was quite a friendly person anyways the pizza was good, the strawberry mojito was good. and the pizookie is always good."
Loren John B.,"Beaverton, OR",137,424,177,3.0,11/30/2008,"So I came into town earlier this weekend to find out this place just opened up recently. I thought this place would take over where the Circuit City or Rasputins used to be. Nope. Its smack dab in the middle of the parking lot. I didn't realize all the cars there were meant for BJ's customers. And the dining area is probably the smallest among the other BJ's I've been to. Yikes. My friend told me that all the other BJs in the Bay (i.e. Foster City and San Jose) that they don't allow you to phone in for reservations, but apparently this place did. Ugh. We needed a table for a party of 8, and the wait would be an hour and a half tops. Double ugh. Mind you this was at 7pm, so since its new I guess it makes sense. I showed up with one of my friends a little early and we chilled at the bar. Fortunately, one big party left their table and we swooped in right away. For the record its open seating at the bar, so we lucked out.  Service was extra slow and they got our order wrong... in a good way. One of my buddies ordered the Santa Fe spring rolls and never got it. We asked for waters for everyone and that took half an hour. Our shots of Patron for the entire table took awhile too. If it wasn't for being surrounded by good company, we would have complained more haha. As far as getting out order wrong, we ordered 2 large pizzas, the BJ's favorite (my personal fave) and the Great White. Our pizzas came out to one small and one medium pizza, so instead of getting 8 slices per large pizza, we got 10 pieces with the two smaller pizzas of each flavor. Woot.  I'm glad there's a BJ's much closer to my home without having to drive all the way to deep San Jose or across the bridge to Foster City. I haven't had it in awhile so it was nice. I'm just not fond of it being smaller than the other BJ's I've been to and the service needs some work too. They also need to revitalize the rest of that shopping center, especially now that the new Mervyn's is closing. I'll review this again if I end up coming back at a later time. And now i just realized that none of us ordered pizookies. Oh well. Cheerio."
Amanda Y.,"San Francisco, CA",18,26,1,2.0,12/21/2008,"This place really is ""meh"".  I like BJ's, especially the ones in San Mateo and Cupertino, but this location is terrible!  I decided to come here with a group of my friends for my birthday, and I really wish I didn't.   The waiters/waitresses aren't very attentive to customers' needs.  My friends and I felt so ignored practically the whole night and our waitress hardly ever came back to ask if we needed anything.  We pretty much had to flag her down every time we needed something.  Our food came out at really random times too.  I think a friend of mine waited 20 minutes after everyone else got their food and it was only a burger. I would suggest getting a reservation at least a week in advanced if you want to eat here without waiting 45+ minutes.  It is packed at almost all hours of the day, except if you come in during the weird times like 4-5 in the evening.  I think the waiters and waitresses have a lot of growing to do in their profession and I probably won't come back to this location for at least 6 months.  Maybe everyone will have their act down by then.  I think coming here for a quick drink would be everyone's best bet."
Ann T.,"San Jose, CA",1,40,,4.0,4/2/2011,"Love the food, this is one of my favorite restaurants, but my first time at this location. 10pm on Friday and had a 20 min wait. I was surprised how crowded it was! The closed Mervyn's parking lot was packed. Interesting patrons...as I was getting seated, a table that was leaving had to carry one of their drunk buddies out. Wow.  But the food was great! Spicy marinara sauce gave the chicken parmigiana a nice kick, and we had to try their new dessert: beignet with strawberries, ice cream, and whip cream! Must try!"
Krista T.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",208,159,4,3.0,3/8/2009,"Read a lot of reviews about bad service but I had just the opposite.  My waitress was ""Zaida"" very nice and attentive.  The staff seemed friendly.  The food was ok, I got the pizza, although my son loved the pizza. My friend got grilled chicken with mashed potatoes on a bed of lettuce and they really liked their meal. CONS:  The parking lot is horrible, needs to be repaved."
Radha X.,"Oakland, CA",9,151,4,3.0,8/19/2009,"Went here for the first time.  Liked the atmostphere...casual, but not too rowdy. Their drink menu is extensive and i liked their ""beer sampler"" even though I didn't like half of the beer. Food was ok. I got the jambalaya...but it was more like stir fry. And my boyfriend got one of their deep dish pizzas, and that was only ok too.  Overall I got the impression of a wanna be cheese cake factory. Or many more like an Elephant bar.  One thing I liked was they had a detailed ""nutrition"" index for everything on their menu. Not that I changed my mind on my entree choice ;-)"
Ray R.,"Newark, CA",41,163,7,2.0,11/22/2008,"Definitely has its new restaurant kinks to work out. Wait was long, even for calling in to be added to the wait-list. On they phone they said 20min, when we got there it was less than 50min (on a Thursday night).  Their Mojito is really a limeade with A MINT LEAF. And yes the root-beer is not like the sugared/carbonated A&W stuff you grew up on, so don't worry. The food was alright seeing that I ordered a medium veggie pizza sans cheese. A country fried steak was also ordered and surprisingly huge. Give it six months to work out its problems, and let the novelty of it all ware off a little."
Tom Y.,"Carlsbad, CA",123,676,317,4.0,3/29/2009,"I have to say I m not going to go back for the food again on my own accord, its overpriced and bland.  Their own brand beers are not bad but nothing to write home about (I am a beer snob) but they have a selection of imported beers that is incredible european beers that are hard to find, for the first time in draft form I have seen in the bay area in such variety."
Henry S.,"Dublin, CA",387,1497,49,4.0,11/14/2008,"Came here last night (Thursday night) around 9:45pm and there was still at 20 minute wait!  Yes I know its only the 3rd day they were open but they are still working out their kinks.   First the bad....I over heard the table next to us complaining to the manager that they have been waiting over 2 hours for their food.  People who were seated after them got their food, ate and had already left.  The lady was soo pissed (I wouldn't blame her either) but the manager comped their entire meal. Service was a little slow but that's expected when a new restaurant opens.  Our table ordered the large sampler plate.  It was good but the spinach artichoke dip was not cooked all they way through.  It was COLD in the middle.  We told the waitress and she brought us another one.  She was slightly slow on keeping our drinks filled but I'm going to give this place the benefit of the doubt. We all ordered their deep dish pizza.  All of them came out hot and really good.  No complaints on the food.   OK the most exciting thing for me about this place was the BIG ASS TV right above the bar.  You can see it from just about every booth in the place.  The GSW game was on so there was tons of fans yelling and cheering.   Great location also....right off the Mowry exit off 880 across the street from New Park.   As our Governor would say...I'll Be Back!"
Tara A.,"Newark, CA",193,19,1,5.0,7/7/2010,"We come to BJ's for Sunday Funday... I have to say I have a slight addiction to Bloody Mary's on a Sunday afternoon. But not just any Bloody Mary... the bartender John makes THE BEST BLOODY MARY IN THE WORLD!!! It's spicy, it's shaken to perfection, the amount of ice is perfect. And on that little stick he puts a beautiful celery stalk, green beans, a pepper and a few olives, don't forget the lime. He even rims the glass with salt and pepper. I'm telling you this man is the Bloody Mary MASTER!! Thank you John for letting me enjoy those Sunday afternoons, is there any way to get a fixed schedule just for Bloody Mary making? The food is awesome too!! Always get a buffalo chicken pizza!! mmmm mmmm good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Alexandra G.,"Milpitas, CA",73,216,136,4.0,8/7/2011,2 for 20 deal what a steal. Soup or a salad ANY medium sized pizza and a pizookie. Left very full and satisfied and no they did not skimp on quality either.
Gerald D.,"Fremont, CA",76,75,3,4.0,4/23/2009,"When this place first opened, it was soooooo busy for the first few months.  Now, it has leveled off. My first visit to this place and luckily, it wasn't busy when we arrived at about 5:30p.  We were seated promptly. We had Cory as our server.  He's half Asian, half Caucasian.  He's real humble. We ordered a Bruschetta to start off with.  The bread was toasted with Parmesan cheese and the tomato salsa was served on the side.  Tasty. My mom ordered the Angel Hair Toscana.  Although there's no kind of meat in this dish, the flavor is bursting in every bite! Then we split a large BJ's Favorite Deep-Dish pizza.  The Italian sausage is off the hook.  It was a bit strange that my mom and my sister complained that the pizza crust wasn't cook though.  The complained that it is too doughy.  They say the crust at Pizzeria Uno's is better, which I agree upon, but I don't have any complaints about the crust. The interior has a nice contemporary look on the inside.  They have HD screens along the walls.  However, there are some mirrors that are hanged on the wall that seems out of place... I would definitely come back here and try their other items on the menu."
Rick R.,"Fremont, CA",0,13,,4.0,2/26/2012,"First time for me, I went there Sat 2/25/12, and had the Ahi Salad.  It was delicious.  Perfect Ahi and delicious fresh greens.  A meal in itself for guys like me who don't need 3000 calories/day. I'll go back for that anytime!"
Angel G.,"Union City, CA",227,205,122,3.0,6/18/2009,"Service was ok, wait was about 20 minutes and that was on a weekday!  Food was ok, the best part was the Pizookie! We were able to take it to go because my son got sick.  The waitress was able to put our ice creams in a 2go container & hooked us up with another Pizookie because my son's meal came with a sundae but wasn't able to eat it.  So she gave us a Pizookie for free!"
Erica R.,"Highlands Ranch, CO",51,178,,4.0,4/10/2009,"Ok, I totally love this place.  Great food.  I'm especially a fan of the broccoli cheddar soup.  I really like the decor as well.  My man and I have been here a few times.  They have tons of great options for different types of dishes.  There's everything from soup and salad to burgers, to pizza. The drinks are always great.  My Cosmo or Sex on the Beach are never weak.  My boyfriend is super picky about drinks (having been a bar tender and all) and he raved about his Long Island. My only complaint is that you can't make reservations for parties under 10 people.  And if you don't have reservations, sometimes the wait can be as long as an hour  and a half.  If you do decide to go with a group smaller than 10, call ahead.  But the wait will still be 30 min."
Athens r.,"Union City, CA",56,134,,3.0,4/9/2009,"I just wanted to see the bar, really. Good place to try next time. yes the trip was justifiable.  Didnt really come here for food, but since its my first, thered be next time to review this place. Id definitely be writing an update. I didnt get to ask and sit if they had a happy hour, but which place like this doesnt? For the dine in sitting-- Elephant bar was better for me, seems like its crowded and congested on the floor and something somehow feels the floor was dug low. Good place to chill."
Sam S.,"San Diego, CA",2,30,5,5.0,12/20/2011,"Classic BJs, but it's a big one, a little nicer, and big selection on the menu."
Vera T.,"Fremont, CA",16,10,,3.0,11/30/2008,"I agree with the other reviewers, it's a long wait for actual seating.  Last Wednesday, a table for 6 at 5pm was 1 hour and 45min.   So instead of waiting to get seated tonight, we went straight to the bar area (first come first serve open seating).  We waited no more then 10 mins for a table to open up.  The service was decent and the Mediterranean Pizza was really good."
Hannah r.,"Hayward, CA",11,2,,4.0,12/13/2011,"This place is clean and the people are helpful. Every time I have been the wait has not been long, even though the place is packed. It's fun for every one even if youre under 21. The personsal pizza dishes are super good, better than your average pizza, its filling and not to expensive, they give out icecream dishes to thoe celebrating bdays, and if you like to watch the football game with a beer, good service and good food its the place to hit up.."
Randy T.,"Manteca, CA",2,2,1,1.0,6/29/2012,"Worst service I have ever had. After taking 10 minutes to get drinks after we were seated, our server told us he was going on break and another server would be taking care of us. We sat for twenty five minutes without even a look from our new ""server"". Even after speaking with management it didn't improve. My wife and I got our drinks refilled once, we had to ask for my son's and my daughter never got a refill. This was the first time I've not left a tip. HORRIBLE STAFF!!!!"
