Laura G.,"Newark, CA",8,6,1,3.0,11/16/2008,"The first time I had BJ's was in Maui. It was so good we ate it three times in one week! So, when I saw there would be a new one in Newark, I was elated! Having worked in the industry during college, I knew the grand opening would be crazy and full of kinks. To avoid the madness, we decided to order take-out. You can actually order online, but I chose to call it in, just to be sure I got exactly what I wanted. I ordered a large sausage and cheese deep dish pizza (uncut, because it stays hotter). The girl on the phone answered right away and was very nice. She told me the order would take only 10 minutes. I thought to myself, ""What? A deep dish in 10 minutes?"" When I arrived, I thought I would be able to park in the ""take out"" parking. The policy is that if you do, they will come to you and bring our food. Well, that didn't happen. The parking lot is a mess and the ""take out"" spots were full. I had to circle three times before I found a parking spot. Grrr...hopefully this will change soon! Take out has its own entrance with a hostess at the front to greet you. The place inside is nice. It's about time Newark has something a little more hip than Swiss Park! When I arrived, I was helped right away and my pizza was ready and waiting. I opened the pizza to make sure the order was correct.  What I saw inside was nothing like the BJ's I remember in Maui. Having a husband from Chicago, I have become very particular about my pizza. Real Chicago pizza has thick dough, sauce, toppings and then the cheese on top. This pizza looked like doughy foccaccia with no sauce, a little cheese and then some sausage on top. (BJ's used to claim it was Chicago pizza...is it no more?) I immediately asked for extra sauce and was pleasantly accomadated. When I arrived home and opened it up for my husband, he turned up is nose. We wondered if it was microwaved or pre-made, as it was ready in only ten minutes????? Anywho, we were hungry, so we ate it. I dipped my bites in the extra sauce and it was actually fabulous! I guess that is the key! It's not as good as the pizza I had in paradise, but it certainly is one of the better ones in the local area.  I think we will do a dine in experience in a few weeks after they have a chance to get the kinks out. :)"
Trish R.,"Fremont, CA",0,20,,4.0,10/2/2013,Boyfriend and I come here all the time and I love it. Each time the service is up to par.  Food is great (not anything fancy or really delicious though) and the pizookie is to die for. :) Well-priced menus.
John B.,"Fremont, CA",1,23,,1.0,3/5/2012,Always understaffed and the food comes barely warm.  Waited for more than an hour and another 45 minutes to get the drinks.  Will not go there again. +1 star for awesome beer.
Neil R.,"Newark, CA",233,369,124,4.0,5/17/2009,"Dude this is a pretty sick place to hang out, grad a bite to eat and drink. Watch some cool shit on TV. And they have quite the selection. Great energy and ambiance.  Their menu just looks delicious. I've tried some of their pizzas, salads, other chicken pasta and or otherwise dishes and damn it... its pure sex. I haven't yet picked something I didn't like. Always a hit.  You see... I don't like trying new dishes cause at most places they disappoint. So to avoid that... I play it safe. But at BJ's... I know I will be OK with trying something new.  I am not a beer drinker and this place does brew their own mix... so I usually get their root-beer and again - a hit. I love it.  PLUS: Food, taste, speed and accuracy of service, parking, accessibility, things to do around the area, the decor and ENERGY of the place, and the staff!  MINUS: Sometimes there's a bit of a wait... but worth it.  OVERALL: Once you get seated, you'll have a blast.  Enjoy!"
Helen T.,"Phoenix, AZ",86,7,,1.0,1/23/2012,"I know there's a lot of lovers of the pizookie famed BJ's brewery, but i just had THE WORST experience ever!!! My mom, husband, and I wanted to watch the 49ers game this past Sunday, along with 3 other people. So there were 6 of us. I called to make a reservation for the bar, since we were a big party, I thought it'd be fine. The girl on the phone said she had a booth in the bar, 3rd row back reserved for us at 2:15. Cool. But we get there and the guy at the front says, ""Sorry, we don't do reservations. And the bar is open seating anyway."" I have worked in a fine-dining atmosphere for years, and I realize that this is just casual but all dining protocol says that this in itself warrants one free dessert. Furthermore, management didn't stand behind their employees, but rather blamed us, the diners, for not knowing that they don't make reservations. HOW WERE WE SUPPOSED TO KNOW?!? Then they screwed up my food order, forgot to put three of the six chairs and silverware sets at the table (so half of us were left standing for 10 minutes until we went and got our own chairs), and then forgot to put in our pizookie order but didn't realize it for HALF AN HOUR! The manager finally brought one out for us, didn't appologize, just ""there it is"". The only saving grace was the waitress that relieved our original, forgetful one. Rose, I think her name was. She was very polite up until we signed the check, then she didn't care who we were after when we asked for to-go boxes. Overall a terrible experience by front of house and management alike. Food tasted good (great job BOH) and was hot when it eventually came out. But I am still NEVER going back!!!"
Shira O.,"San Francisco, CA",162,332,202,3.0,8/4/2010,"Went to the 10-close happy hour last night. Tuesday is 1/2 off bottle of wine/glass night...not to shabby. Discounts on lots of things if you sit in the bar area only. Service is nothing to sneeze at, but I like my beer,  wine and pizza cheap and happy hour at this place hits the mark."
Joanne H.,"San Leandro, CA",291,271,21,4.0,4/7/2010,"see, i'd never thought i'd do it.. to give Bj's higher than a one star... or even set foot into one ever again!  BUT it was either this place of Elephant Bar and i could swear i'd give them both the same bad ratings.  Since i havent step foot into here for about 5 years now, I thought they might have improved while Elephant Bar just went down the drain. Well.. they did good. BUFFALO WINGS :  crispy SPINACH ARTICHOKE DEEP DISH PIZZA:  good OREO PIZOOKIE:  oh em gee.  So good.  even from my last bad experience from BJ's, i told myself i'd only go back for this... and yes it's still so worth it.   at end of the night,  i had to take off my belt to breathe.  KILLED THE PIZOOKIE! murdered it. yummmmm"
Max M.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,46,,3.0,11/19/2013,"Four of us met here for lunch on Friday at 11:30. The place was at 10 percent capacity. We did not want a booth. Our table was in unserviceable zone. I asked a wait staff to find our waiter. No one showed up. So I went to the front and requested a waiter. The fellow was warm and friendly, he took our order, but switch us to someone else right after our drinks arrived. Food was good, tasty and inexpensive. We had unlimited time for lunch but if we did not, the initial confusion on behalf of wait staff would have hampered our plans. I still give them 3 star for the food and service. Will go back for food."
Max N.,"Hayward, CA",70,52,30,3.0,3/30/2009,"Good place, hard to get a spot sometimes when it is busy, but the food/beer is good, and the restaurant is new and pretty clean. Their pizza is awesome although fairly pricy.  Good alternative to Gordon Biersh. Taking the rating down  1 star due to experience on 4/3/09.  Called ahead at 10.30pm asked if they were busy, they told me no, come on down... once there i had to wait 30 min for a table, and got a stunned look at the counter when I asked if a wait is their definition of not being busy. Person that sat us down was kinda rude about IDs claimed that we didn't look 21 wtf...  Then they gave us our $5 bill back claiming their machine didn't work with it?!?! Seriously wtf...  Pizza was still good, and beer was good also. place was clean as always."
Andrea M.,"Hayward, CA",142,406,220,4.0,1/26/2009,"I've been here plenty of times since it opened, including one time before it opened for free food!! :D, and i've had good experiences so far. haven't seemed to have any problems with the hosts/servers yet, so i can't complain about that. i loveeeee the food here. the pizza is hella good.. another thing i like to order is the parmesan crusted chicken (yum!).. the appetizers that i've tried are good, too. i think of all the times i've been here, i haven't had anything i didn't like. i dont think you can go wrong with the food here."
Jackie D.,"San Jose, CA",600,386,31,3.0,4/14/2010,"Wait time is forever with food no matter how big your party. i'm not a big fan of chain places but this isn't too bad. they have baked potatoes and i do love me some potatoes. that's what i usually get every time and a side salad. i always feel like a fatass after i'm done but it's kinda worth it....well maybe not the price. i can only vouch for the potatoes and beer. everything else? i think it's just normal chain food. too heavy, too greasy, too plain."
Rita H.,"San Jose, CA",1,19,3,1.0,9/13/2013,This review is strictly for security guy at night time. Real example of RUDE. Bjs manager should train him more properly. Other than that service was great and food was good.
Allen Y.,"San Jose, CA",4,25,6,5.0,12/21/2008,"Sheesh, we got a lot of tough customers out here. Judging from the review trends, my critique will possibly be the handful of 5 stars the Newark BJs will get. Well anyways I had a great experience coming here. This BJs has a unique set up which is different from the other BJs I went to, which were Foster City, and Tanforan. It has like a main floor which has easy access to view the the multi-sport screens at the bar, and the flat screens surrounding the floor. From where I was sitting it almost felt like a theater.  In attention to food, the pizza is awesome. I'm a pizza lover, and I have to say BJs pizza is my number one favorite as of now. I don't care what people say but BJs is better than Pizza Chicago. The dough has smooth consistency, the  pizza toppings are premium grade, and the crust is soft and crispy. Yum.  As for service, our waitress was friendly, and nice. She was attentive, and quick in responding to our requests. I think people should give new opening businesses a break. People have such high expectations for new businesses thinking they'll pamper them with 5 star treatment. It is like expecting the first generation iphone  to not have no defects when you clearly know that first systems launches always have some sort of problems.(terrible tangent) lol. But anyways chill guys, don't beat them down, but give the manager some feedback if there is such a big issue. (possibly they'll give you a free meal on next visit). I'm sure within a month or so the workers' service will be more efficient.   Yeah the parking was difficult to find considering that Mervyns is closing and having a blowout sale during the holiday season, but the chaos should be expected. Wait till Mervyns closes, then parking will be no problem.  I recommend this particular BJs location, but it should be noted that any BJs restaurants has great food. But try it for yourself and don't take my word for it. Bon appetit ^_^"
Daniel M.,"Daly City, CA",125,438,1,2.0,4/24/2009,"Came here tonight for a drink and a Pizookie.  Strolled in with four friends around 9 pm.  Packed.  No seating available at the bar.  Maybe b/c of the NHL & NBA Playoffs.  We stood around for about 10-15 min before a table cleared out.   The waiter we got was super friendly.  We tried to order the Pumpkin Ale (which was on the menu and the light on at the tap), but it wasn't available.  We tried ordering another ""Seasonal"" that was on our menus, but that wasn't available as well.  The waiter informed us of a third seasonal....but told us it was unavailable when we tried to order that.  So...after about five minutes of trying to figure out what was available and what was not with the waiter, we settled on a pitcher of Heff....and three Pizookies.   Beer and Pizookies...not a good combo.  But that was our bad. Seasonal Beers on the menu, but not available....not a good look.   Oh yeah, for those Rice Rocket drivers that want to check this place out, I suggest you take your other NON-lowered car here.  The road to the parking lot of this place is terrible...and you will definitely scrape the bottom of your car.  Just lookin' out..."
Henry Y.,"Mountain View, CA",12,137,3,3.0,12/13/2008,"I think i would have been a great waiter/host staff here... too bad i applied too late... they are always awfully busy. we had a strange waitress tonight... i wasn't sure if she was being sarcastic, or demeaning mmm"
Jessica E.,"Oakland, CA",70,132,2,5.0,3/27/2010,"So I went here last night on a d-a-t-e... I've heard so many good things about this place from my besticle so i was excited when my d-a-t-e said we were going there. This place was crackalackin lol The wait was an hour, but we didn't mind. It was friday with no reservations OF Course its a wait. BAM our buzzer goes off, we sit down, and here comes the waiter. So we got buffalo wings as the appetizer, & I ordered a caesar salad and a chilli stuffed baked potatoe. OMFG Their food is so delicious. I think I enjoyed the food more than my d-a-t-e. I'll be going back wait a minute did I forget to mention their Cream Soda? Yeah I did that was to die for!!!! They brew their own beer, cream soda, and root beer. If I wasn't laying off beer and alcohol for a few months I'd tell you how good their adult drinks were. Oh well. Me loves this place."
Fikret O.,"Newark, CA",65,9,,4.0,12/23/2013,"pizzas are awesome, good draft beer options. little corwded..."
Lee T.,"Newark, CA",4,14,7,4.0,8/29/2009,"I went here for my birthday back in May. I ordered a rack of babyback ribs, a baked potato, and some other small items that I don't really remember. I do remember though that everything I ordered tasted great, minus the BBQ sauce that came with the ribs. But that's no big deal. The waiters/waitresses were very upbeat and interactive. I liked that."
Ann L.,"San Ramon, CA",31,92,20,3.0,3/8/2009,"So I've been here a few times and I'll just say it's a-ok.  Service can be ehhh and food is just ehhh as well.  The fist time I came here, just shortly after they opened, I ordered their pot roast sandwich, which came out without mashed potatoes on it.  So when I asked the waiter if that was a mistake, he was like, ""Oh this doesn't come with it...""  but as he finished the sentence, the cook came out with a freshly made plate with mashed potatoes on it and said ""I'm sorry, I sent this out to you with no mashed potatoes.""  Whoops.   Also once we ordered the mozzarella sticks and the texture of it was downright off.  Everyone there loves their bbq chicken pizza so we decided to try it once.  The deep dish was a little too ""undone"" tasting and all you could taste on it was the bbq sauce.  Their jambalaya is one of the better tasting meals I've had.  And lastly I've had their California Grilled Chicken sandwich, which, well, lacked flavor as well.  Hm.  The ultimate does like their pizookies... they do have a great selection of beers, the bf likes their stouts and I like their seasonal pumpkin ale and their hefs.   The wait here is a joke, but one good thing is that they do have ""call ahead"" seating.  When you're on your way, give them a call to have your name put on the wait list.  And the parking lot... wow, it needs to be repaved."
Amie R.,"Morgan Hill, CA",35,7,,1.0,10/2/2010,"The food deserves 4 stars but the customer service receives 1 star. They are very slow. Call ahead only takes 20 minutes off your wait. Even if you call in 30 minutes ahead of time. If you want to go to a BJ's with good food and service, head to Cupertino"
