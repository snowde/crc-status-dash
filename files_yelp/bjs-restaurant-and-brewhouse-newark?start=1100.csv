Samuel M.,"Fremont, CA",0,34,1,3.0,9/21/2012,"This is a decent place to grab a drink after work in the Tri-City. Not quite as good as some of the ""dive"" bars or breweries in Pleasanton, but they do have a good selection of beers on tap. Be prepared to wait anywhere from 30 mins to an hour for dinner after 7 PM."
Emily L.,"Fremont, CA",1,8,,4.0,12/7/2013,"The food was good as usual. The new smaller brewhouse burgers and mini pizza were a nice change from the giant portions I usually see. Perfect for lunch. We were seated quickly, but service was super slow once we sat down."
Paulo M.,"Fremont, CA",2,11,,4.0,9/4/2010,"Awesome beer.  My favorite is a toss up between the nutty brewnette and the piranha, plenty of hops for your taste buds.  Their happy hour is great as personal pizzas are half price."
Danielle O.,"Union City, CA",106,171,118,4.0,1/18/2011,Love to come here with friends.  They have a nice beer selection as well as food.  The parking is kinda crappy.  The waiting is a bit long but its only because its sooo pack.  The food especially the PIZZOKIE is amazing.
notre d.,"Fremont, CA",6,14,1,4.0,6/13/2009,"Not bad for Newark/Fremont area and pretty crowded during dinner time, even during weekdays. Be prepared to be patient to get a seat for dinner. Their handcrafted brews are not bad - I really love the 7 glass sampler. A good way to try out their brews. I haven't really had a bad meal their yet. The pizzas are decent with my favorite so far the 2 chicken sandwiches."
Suhas J.,"Fremont, CA",0,5,,4.0,10/1/2013,Probably the best place in Fremont to hangout with friends or family. They have a huge screen which makes watching games a delight. Beer is OK. Food is good. Service is consistent. Fills up fast on the weekends - wait times are between 45 minutes to 2 hours. Call ahead for shorter wait times.
Brendan J.,"Los Angeles, CA",51,365,72,3.0,12/12/2008,The food is okay! The drinks overpriced for Fremont area. Nice place to have a birthday party though.
AP F.,"Fremont, CA",0,3,,4.0,11/22/2011,"Awesome deep dish pizza! Only thing to watch out -- they use to have over 4 toppings priced as 4. But now they changed it -- each topping $1.50. So when we ordered **all** veggies large pizza last time - they charged us some $38 for that pizza alone! Otherwise it should cost you about $25-28. pzookie is great, kids will love it. Their kid's meals are good for my kids, especially the side (salad) my kid gets is worth the kid's meal price by itself!"
Paul C.,"Fremont, CA",49,142,,2.0,4/18/2009,"Came here in January 2009 a couple of months after this location was opened.  The service was mediocre at best and really slow.  We were there in the early evening (around 5pm) so it was not too crowded.  Our server was really slow at getting drinks and bringing our food. When we were first seated, the booth was still dirty as there was a fork on the seat and a dirty napkin.  Next, there was no silverware set on the table which we had to ask for.  It took 10 minutes to get 2 beers and some water.  An order for sliders took 40 minutes to get out and by that time, most of us were done eating.  The server said he would come back to refill our drinks but never did so we had to ask another server.  The only thing I can give them props on was dropping off the pizookie before the ice cream melted. Anyway, service here is terrible, so you're better off going to the BJ's in Cupertino.  I've been there many times and the service is much better and faster if you don't mind the drive."
Lori D.,"Fremont, CA",17,78,7,5.0,1/31/2009,"*drool... Pizookie...* For a chain restaurant, this place is spot-on.  There is quite a bit of variety on the menu, pretty delicious choices for beer, and... oh yes... it even pleased my ever-so-picky father! Despite the crowded parking lot, we got seated in less than 10 minutes.  I have had their Great White deep dish pizza before at the Oakridge Mall location (and VERY impressed, best one around for miles (Pizza Chicago is the only one which exceeds), so I convinced my father to get BJ''s Favorite.  My mom got the Santa Fe salad.  I got a California Grilled Chicken sandwich.  To drink, I had a homemade Cream Soda (no corn syrup!) and wow, you can taste all the flavors to it.  Pops got the Taster, which gives you 5oz. portions of each of their 7 beers.  My favorite of their beers is the blonde, red, and brewnette (funny how my faves were the hair colored ones!). It's rare at times with my family but we all LOVED EVERYTHING!  My sandwich was filling, flavorful, and oh so cheesy!  And I liked how they have an option of the type of fries (wedges or crispy thin), those wedges were tasty.  I was even munching my mom's salad with her, since she was raving about it the whole time (she saw someone else having it at a table before we sat down, she asked what the lady ordered).  And that pizza filled and satisfied my finicky father; plus he had leftovers for tomorrow's Super Bowl Sunday. Then last but not least, we HAD to get a Pizookie!  All my friends from SoCal were raving about them to me so I had to give in.  We shared this new one, double chocolate cookie in the tin with two scoops of double chocolate ice cream on top, with a Ghiradelli square as garnish.  That was simply unforgettable... I highly recommend it to anyone and to even make room at the end of your meal for it (if you're a chocolate fan, like my family is). I have no complaints about the service, they seemed a bit busy at times, but that's because so many people were there! I'm so happy they built one in Newark near Newpark Mall (instead of a Friday's!)  I'll definitely be going back and spreading the goodness to all my Fremont friends.  I'd also like to try more of their specialty drinks sometime too."
Mike W.,"Union City, CA",54,70,42,2.0,1/2/2009,"Food good, but by my book, a brewery needs to be about the beer. The first time, I had their stout and a Marin IPA. Decent stuff. Wish they had a bigger selection but workable. The second time, my black and tan was a failure. That's a huge no-no in my book.  The third time, it was a 45 minute wait at 8:30pm on a Fri night. Errr, pass. I'm a temperamental drinker. There's better, even in Fremont."
Elvira G.,"Union City, CA",33,88,12,4.0,1/26/2011,All the food that I've had here is amazing. Some of the drinks are not that great but if you don't like it they'll let you try something else...the atmosphere is a lot of fun. I came here for the world series and it was a blast. Go here if you want to have a good time watching a good game. Or just want to go with good company... Ps. Try the pazooki...
Samantha C.,"San Jose, CA",75,357,58,4.0,12/13/2010,"I know i know, this is a pizza place, but I Love the sliders here! It's more fun to sit at the bar area as the crowd is so friendly."
reggie c.,"Oakland, CA",180,52,2,3.0,2/25/2009,"Meh wife and I went here on a Sunday Night when there was a football game on.    Place was packed to the gills with an hour wait, so we asked for a seat at the bar.   Food was pretty good.   I had a big plate of Jambalaya that had some good flavors going on shrimp wasn't rubbery and had lots of andoullie.   The IPA was decent, but nowhere near the old Brewpup on the Green. It's a sportsbar that has above average superbowl fare."
Felecia W.,"Dublin, CA",2,51,5,3.0,7/5/2013,"Nice place to come with a group. Very nicely decorated and lively atmosphere. Tv's everywhere. Food is good for a chain restaurant. Similar to like a cheesecake factory or such. Our group ordered the beer sampler and that was fun to sip their house special beers. The dessert was memorable. Giant cookie topped with ice cream and beignets. The meal itself was just regular stuff that I forgot exactly, since I was their over 1 mth ago."
Christian F.,"Philadelphia, PA",60,29,7,4.0,2/2/2010,"BJ's was one of the first breweries that I went to and it's always had a special place in my beer heart. The beers are fantastic, all of them. From the hefeweizens to the stouts. The artichoke heart dip is great along with the wings. The deep dish pizza has almost been a tradition for me and my friends. Lastly there's the famous pizookie. That combination of hot and cold in a single bite is something that needs to be experienced. The service is great. On the few times that there has been a problem, the server was always quick to address it (always resulting in our benefit). It can get pretty crazy busy at times and there can be long waits and you might have to wait a bit for your food, but it's generally within the limits of being understandable considering how busy it gets. Come here with friends for a good time and be sure to try the pizookie!"
Ace W.,"South San Francisco, CA",12,1,1,3.0,7/1/2011,"Service is okay. But the red velvet pizookie is a must try. Be careful, floors in the bar area are pretty slippery."
Kristine A.,"Monte Sereno, CA",275,404,97,5.0,1/2/2011,"Perfect for muchies!!! I live nearby and I always, ALWAYS, call in and order the spicy avocado rolls, calamari (sometimes it is so-so, but still a must, with the 2 ranches and 1 marinara), clam chowder in bowls, and the half oreo-half cc cookies w/oreo whipped cream and ice cream and in less than 15 minutes it's ready for pickup. Eaten in the restaurant a couple times... prefer to toke and choke in the comfort of my own home though :) minus all the people that flock here... every single night. Its what fills up the parking spaces of the old staples/petsmart/kidsrus (now demolished) slash old rasputin, home furnishings, circuit city, dollar tree, and the abandoned mervyn's spaces. Good business. In the same ""plaza"" there's a 76 with really nice clerks, open 24hrs. We order here very often!"
Eddy G.,"Union City, CA",89,20,6,4.0,6/20/2011,"Good Food , tasty beers great service.. Only complaint is the guest. Alot of fake sports fans and young first time binge drinkers . You know the people that scream and yell for a certain team, but have no clue who and what any of the players names and the young college students that spend all their money on beer, but not enough to tip. Yeah those kind of people. Other than that. Its a great place to hangout with your friends and co-workers , when its not super busy!! 4stars"
Heni K.,"Fremont, CA",0,1,,5.0,10/2/2011,Love to start with in house margarita & beer with food.. long waiting every time i go but worth it though!!!
