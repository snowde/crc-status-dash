Peggy T.,"Glendale, AZ",2,12,1,4.0,8/2/2011,"We were promptly seated. I ordered a Caesar salad and tomato soup.  They didn't freak out when I asked for Steak on my Caesar salad but in fact asked how I would like the steak cooked! I asked for nothing to be put into the tomato soup. Most places and even other BJ's seem to struggle with that request and still put croutons,parsley and cheese into it. They nailed it! Crouton,parsley and cheese free!  My husband ate Jambalaya, a little too spicy for my palate but he paired it with their Nitwit white wheat beer. He loved it. We were in and out of there in no time. This was a very enjoyable meal. The place had people lined out the door when we were leaving so it obviously has a draw."
Miko T.,"Fremont, CA",17,59,1,4.0,1/2/2009,"Tonight I visited the Newark BJ's for the first time. My prior experience was at the location in San Mateo (I think?), but it was for a large group, and all of the pizzas were pre-ordered, so my involvement was very limited.  This Newark location visit was mainly a good one. My boyfriend's parents actually got there before we (the boyfriend and I) did. They got there at 5:45 and were told that it was going to be a 30-35 minute wait. We arrived at 6:05 and they had just been seated, so the wait was less than expected, especially for a Friday night.  After getting seated and receiving waters all around, we ordered the BJ's Best (?), general appetizer plate. It had cheese sticks, avacado egg rolls, santa fe rolls (didn't try this), and spinach-artichoke dip. The spinach-artichoke dip was amazing and nice and warm, and served with tortilla chips. Cheese sticks were standard, and the avacado egg rolls were fine.  The main negative here was that it took a long time for drinks other than water and fountain soda to be brought to the table. It was like waiting for food, but it was just a drink. I mean, how long can it take, really?  I ordered fish and chips, with skinny fries. It was good, fresh, though the fries were not hot. In fact, they were a little too close to bla-room temperature. But the fish was definitely just out of the fryer. Boyfriend ordered pizza. The medium was pretty large, definitely a lot for just one person. He ate half of it, and took the rest home for leftovers. He ordered the BJ's favorite pizza (looked good). Salads that can be ordered with a meal are an additional $2.95. Be aware though, that as a side salad is pretty big. Probably served on a plate about 6 inches in diameter. I would skip on a side salad if you plan on ordering dessert.  For dessert we ordered a pazookie, I think the oreo one. The oreo part of it was this little cream on top, otherwise it was a chocolate cookie. So I had heard a lot of hype about this pazookie thing, and understood it as just a cookie with ice cream. However, the cookie is almost like a brownie, fresh out of the oven, and still has that doughy texture. Combined with the ice cream, it's way more than just a cookie, and DEFINITELY worth getting. So skip on salad and little extras, and save room for dessert. Other little tid bits...the noise in this place is pretty intense, and it's probably not the best place for nice quiet, intimate conversation. Another slight negative is that there are servers and then waiters for each table, so it's a bit confusing trying to get something. Because you can't ask the person who brings the beer for another drink--you'd have to ask your server for that. I just don't think that system is the most effective or convenient for either the guests or the employees. Prices are moderately fair, and the menu is extensive. Choices range from salads, potatoes, soup, sandwiches, burgers, pizza, pasta, and more.  Reservations are only accepted for groups of ten or more, and from what I've heard, the wait can be quite long, depending on when you go. I think we just got lucky tonight. Overall, good place. Would go again. Skip salad/sides/appetizers. Save room for dessert. :)"
Derya A.,"Oakland, CA",208,243,141,4.0,2/1/2011,"I love the food and desserts here. Everything I've ordered, from the Cajun pasta, pizzas have been great. The Pizookies are amazing and are a must-have. I say only four stars because the wait is always super long. Sometimes they estimate it to be way longer than it is (ie. 40 minutes instead of 10 minutes) which I guess is better than it being longer than what the wait really is but it's just annoying."
Stefano S.,"Fremont, CA",5,26,,1.0,11/23/2009,"Comon guys. This food is garbage. It's one level above the food court.  Go to lucky's, buy some food, go to BevMo, get some beer, and stay out of this shithole. The parking lot is NOTORIOUS for having cars get vandalized and stolen. It's sitting in an urban wasteland of an empty strip mall (pretty much what Fremont/Newark is)  Stay far, far away."
Brian F.,"San Jose, CA",339,165,1,4.0,12/10/2010,"I think everyone know what to expect when going to BJs, large portions and a large menu. Its not as large of a menu as Cheesecake Factory, but its large enough.  Service was good and the place was clean as expected."
Alex V.,"Mountain View, CA",17,48,6,3.0,8/14/2011,I went on a Sunday afternoon and the restaurant was pretty calm. As far as the food I think it's average but not anything out of this world. The service was okay. It's a great place to go with a group since the seating is conducive to groups with a bar. It was a challenge for me because 'm a vegetarian and I don't drink alcohol.
Francine T.,"Fremont, CA",71,11,,3.0,2/23/2011,Cobb salad $11.50. Good selection of beer not so much for the wine. Many TVs all sports. Be sure to call ahead for seating otherwise there will be a long wait. The service varies.
Julia G.,"Vancouver, Canada",0,18,,2.0,6/14/2011,"We were passing through and wanted to watch the Stanley Cup.  BJ's was suggested as a sports bar we could go to.  What is it about BJ's that makes people line up for 40 minutes? The food was very Cheesecake Factory - huge portions and huge calories.  My chicken fresca salad was OK. The grilled chicken had a powdery texture on the outside. Not enough arugula and the vegetables were barely cooked. It came after 45minutes.  What were they doing? I think they do their pizza best but the portions are so huge it's impossible to order.  The American burger came with toast instead of a bun.??? I guess there's just nothing else in Fremont.  So we ate a so so meal in a PACKED restaurant and watched our team lose.  Oh, the service is excellent though."
Cee B.,"San Jose, CA",1,77,3,2.0,8/6/2011,"The BJ's in Cupertino, which is the ORIGINAL BJ's is by far BETTER than this one.  The food and service is better at BJ's in CUPERTINO.  I've had lunch at BJ's in Newark/Fremont twice and they also catered a lunch for my company, which was not very good.  The pizza's were just not that good and the pasta's were extremely skimpy in the pasta trays.  We all thought it was kind of crappy to be honest.  I've been to the BJ's in Cupertino countless times and NEVER been disappointed.  I've also been to the BJ's in San Jose on Blossom Hill, which I should probably do a separate review on.  Terrible experience  LOL #teamBJ'sCupertino"
Erik D.,"Hayward, CA",165,21,11,5.0,10/12/2010,Gotta try their seasonal beers!
Jason C.,"Hayward, CA",61,28,,4.0,9/5/2011,"It's probably my first time going into this BJ restaurant, but I gotta say, I like their decor here. My friends and I went here around 11 pm for a late night snack. The place was still pretty packed! We mainly ordered desserts here. I LOVE their cookies n' cream pizookie. Hell, I like anything with cookies n' cream, at least for desserts haha. Left a 25% tip because that's how I roll! lol jk, it's cause I was craving for sweets that night."
Roxanne W.,"Newark, CA",24,3,,1.0,7/16/2013,"Beware!  BJ's claim their gift cards expire even though there is no visible expiration date on the card, only when they scan it :-("
Stanley C.,"San Jose, CA",791,655,2686,4.0,9/18/2010,"BJ'S RESTAURANT & BREWHOUSE It's always a great experience at BJ's - friendly staff, large menu, sports TVs, and an all-around friendly/fun atmosphere. It is one of the better sports bar restaurants around. Their deep-dish pizza is pretty good, and is big enough to feed an army. Lots of choices of home-brewed beer, and best of all, the infamous Pizookie - ice cream over a large 6-inch baked cookie (chocolate chip, oreo, macadamia nut, etc.) The best deal at BJ's is the 2 for $20 value meal that they offer: 1 Medium Pizza (we got half Southwestern and half Sweet Pig aka Hawaiian), 2 small salads which were huge, and 1 Pizookie of our choice! Tastes great and good for the money!!! BJ's is a great place for large dinner groups, although the wait can be quite long. Come early to get faster seating, although you can sit at the bar on a first-come-first setting. Great appetizers also! Can't wait to go back and watch some sports!"
Tina N.,"Union City, CA",165,69,14,4.0,11/21/2008,"I've been to other BJ restaurants around the bay; and I loved them all. Now going to one closer to home, will make it more pleasurable and easy to watch sports and have a drink or two. There are screens everywhere, great for Sunday afternoons or Monday nights.  The food is amazing, I love their Together At Last (spinach dip/bruchetta mix) appetizer and I am a big fan of their Pizookie dessert! The Calm Chowder is also full of flavor and has a ton of baby clams.  Our waitress was new, but I mean they just opened up so I don't blame her for being a little rough on the edges. I am definitely going to be a returning customer."
Michelle L.,"Fremont, CA",0,5,,1.0,6/14/2011,"I have been to BJ's numerous times and have always had a pleasant experience, but this time I called ahead to put my name on the waiting list.  They said it would be 20-25 minute wait and by the time I got there we would have a table.  We have a 3 month old and this would be perfect.  We arrived there in 22 minutes and went up to tell them we had called ahead.  The guy behind the counter handed us a pager and said it would be another 20 minutes.  I said we called ahead and put our name down and he said yeah well its still going to be a wait. What is the point in calling ahead then?  With having the baby we decided to go somewhere else that we could get in then.  I'm sorry but the food is great but this place really sucks.  If I want BJ's I will visit another location."
Hans R.,"Wakefield, MA",0,54,,4.0,6/13/2011,"The help was very friendly, manager stopped by to make sure we were happy and the food was good.  Just as important in a brewhouse, the beer was good too. Look forward to going back when I'm in town"
Shawn C.,"Great Falls, MT",4,60,,3.0,10/13/2009,"The first time I visited this location it was horrible. The second time, it was not quite as bad. The third time, Bartender Melissa made it all better with quick and perfect service.  Subsequently, the service has improved with each visit. Keep the service quality up, and this place will shine. The Beer and food are fine... just keep the service level high.  If this place had a brewery on site-- I'd probably rate it a 5 ."
Tyler P.,"San Diego, CA",5,17,1,2.0,1/31/2009,"I hate-love BJ'S.  Some of the food is hella good, in a deep fried greasy way. And some of their food is complete and total crap.  My biggest complaint with BJ's would have to be their service.  Every time I go there I have to ask them to remake the food because it is usually at room temperature or cold.   The waiters and waitress seem to be oblivious to what is going on around them or what procedures are when that happens.   The appetizers are all pretty good.  And they have a 7 beer drink sampler for 10.00 bucks.  .. . Which was pretty sweet.   Anyways I still end up coming back because they stay open late and they are really close. . . . ."
Irfan R.,"San Jose, CA",370,517,37,4.0,1/14/2010,Been here a couple times and the pizza and pasta is very good.  Also have a lot of TV screens all over the place so you can watch different sporting events.  Good place for groups and parties.
Kalvin C.,"San Leandro, CA",69,238,11,5.0,1/6/2010,"I went here with fellow yelper Jowin C. and I have to agree that their deep dish pizza, (The BJ's favorite) is to die for. Their root beer is pretty good too, not to mention they are pretty prompt on the refills so you can keep on chuggin' . It may be a little pricey, but hey theres parking and the foods awesome so its worth the extra couple of dollars here and there."
