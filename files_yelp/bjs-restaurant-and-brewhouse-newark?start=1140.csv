Raymond C.,"Fremont, CA",10,23,3,4.0,11/21/2010,Not bad for a chain which is saying a lot.  A lot of chain restaurants have gone downhill and is not a reliable gauge of consistency any more.  They have an extensive menu so you will find something to you like.
Tim W.,"San Francisco, CA",39,122,40,2.0,9/29/2010,"Meh, I've experience better. The place is well decorated went there for the after hours special drinks. We had couple of beers and mini pizza for half off. I requested to get some waters and that never came. Service took a while. I guess it maybe the server we had, poor service!"
Lisa B.,"Fremont, CA",100,2,,2.0,4/28/2013,"Good food, horrible sercive. Every time I have eaten here the service has been really bad. We went for my man's birthday and it was just the two of us. We were seated at the table and sat there for 15 minutes before someone finally came and asked us if we had been greeted yet. We were so hungry otherwise we would have left and gone somewhere else. My man ordered a beer that never came. I had to go up to the bar and order one myself. Our appetizer came out after his meal and my meal came out 10 minutes later. Bottom line...the food is pretty good but the service needs a lot of improvement."
DANNY B.,"San Francisco, CA",2,60,15,5.0,1/11/2010,I went to this place with the impression that the food was great and to my surprise ----IT WAS... I ate the BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich and I have to say it was one of the best sandwiches i have ever eaten.. A week later I went to the BJ'S in Concord and i ate the same thing and to my surprise it was the worse sandwich ever so i guess I will stick to the one in Newark.
Janet E.,"Portland, ME",2,16,,5.0,2/17/2009,"I've only been here once, but I loved it! It's just my kind of food.  The atmosphere is great, the service was good (I was smart: I went on a week night). There is also a massive television that can be seen from almost all tables in the restaurant, my boyfriend wanted me to mention that. We will definitely be returning."
beck l.,"Fremont, CA",0,173,4,4.0,8/7/2010,"I'm sorry but I had to down grade by 1 star.  Two reasons: 1) The food can be a bit fattening.  Lots of extra butter here and there to make the food taste better.  Watch out for those extra calories.  2) Not because of any fault of the restaurant, but this place is just too busy.  Too many people make me feel nervous."
Jamie W.,"San Leandro, CA",1,11,,2.0,4/1/2010,"...Interesting decor, if you have ADD this is the place for you.  There are multiple tv's on every wall of this place and and they're all slightly delayed from each other by a second or two so there's distracting flashing screens everywhere.   Service was alright.  My dad ordered a hefeweizen and it didn't come with a lemon :( and it took her a couple of times before she came back to bring it to us.   Food:  I saw the pictures for the deep dish pizzas in a couple of places and thought it looked tasty enough, so I ordered a mini original one.  I was pretty disappointed with it however.  It wasn't a deep dish pizza so much as it was a personal pan pizza with just a REALLY thick bottom crust.  And the bottom crust was pretty greasy, not really appetizing.  So I had half of the pizza and switched with my dad for half of his burger.  He ordered it medium rare....and it was definitely more rare than medium.  I swear parts still might have been moving.  I had it anyways, and it was alright, nothing really special about it except for it was really thin.  Came with the option of potato wedges or thin cut fries, definite plus there, I LOVE thin cut fries :)  So we did decide to go for the dessert and got the triple pizookie deal.  I still have a bit of a problem with the name ""pizookie"" it sounds like ""pizz"" and ""dookie"" put together.  :/  However I'm not one to turn away anything with a scoop of ice cream on top.  We got the cookie's and cream, white chocolate mac, and chocolate chunk.  They were okay.... nothing really wowed me.  They looked and tasted like they were baked by a light bulb a-la easy bake oven.  Good to go I guess if you have a large party, wide selection of beer and you can be as loud as you want.  Not someplace I would crave."
Spencer H.,"Milpitas, CA",403,222,,4.0,5/19/2010,"I have had several trips here and each time was a great experience. Give the beer sampler a try. You can do a variety of the beers they have available. Their burgers are delicious and I recommend you ending the meal with their pazookie(giant cookie with ice cream on top) It is so mouth watering. By the way, if you come here for your birthday, you get a free pazookie!"
Dee L.,"Fremont, CA",0,34,19,3.0,11/29/2010,"Typical American bar-grill food and tasty beer. Good place to get a drink with friends. Also, they have Pizookis (giant freshly-baked cookie and ice cream) of ALL flavors."
Stevie O.,"Fremont, CA",0,4,,3.0,1/23/2011,"Went to BJ's with friends after a show.  Had the grilled chicken pasta and the chicken was overcooked and dry, but the baked beignet was pretty good.  The waitress was fairly attentive.  Stays open later than most restaurants which is nice."
Tammy G.,"Hayward, CA",20,21,3,5.0,9/30/2010,I went here for my bday a couple years ago!! The food was soooo good!! The drinks were great too! it was a great experience!!! Been trying to go back since but haven't had a chance!!! I give this place a 5 all the way!! Just a super fun atmosphere!!!
Jennifer n.,"San Jose, CA",259,154,234,2.0,5/5/2009,"You know I am a fan of BJ's pan pizza but the overall experience this time was just disturbing.  The wait was only 10 minutes  so not too bad but what bugged me was the service. It SUCKED and so was my company that came with me. After 2 hours of in-door rock climbing, I decided to join some climbers that I knew to BJ's. The waitress greeted us with a smile which started off nice and took our drink and our appetizer order. As soon as she left another waitress came by to take our order stating it was her section. Long story short, she walked away not happy. (Shoot! If I knew any better she was not happy for me!) When the pitcher of beer arrived we tasted it and asked for lemon and to my surprise got a remark ""That is not how you drink this beer, it is made sweet."" My Asian eyes were as big as my caucasian friends! I turned towards her, smiled and said in a firm voice ""This beer is too sweet and we would like some lemon please"". Waiting.....waiting.....waiting....tick tock....waiting....UGH!. I went to the bar and got a cup of lemons for the table.  When the waitress came back with our appetizer, she noticed the lemon and commented with a smile, ""I like the beer the way it is"". UH HELLO PSYCHO! You are suppose to say sorry for not bringing the lemons and who cares what you like. We are the paying customers!"" 1...2....3...4...ok....calm now....on with the review....Our avocado egg rolls were not too bad  but it would have been nice to have silver wear or at least napkins.  My company was starving so they both ate it without a care. Our pizza came out w/o the pizza server, we still did not have plates and had to request for them.  Sorry fokes but I tip accordingly and these guys that I was with, staring at her hooters thought she was the sweetest waitress there was and EVEN complimented her in the end.  I hate tipping 30% for shiety arse service! I was so sick I wanted to barf!  I was not in the mood to argue w/ these fools so I split the check in 3, paid for my portion and went home. I wish there was a way to review these two guys! They would of gotten  minus stars from me! And they want to hang out again...Uh a big NO THANKS! Ok...going to sleep now. I will be happy once again when I wake up. :D Tomorrow is a new day!"
Jonathan K.,"San Jose, CA",241,248,80,2.0,6/10/2009,"food 3 stars (will not go into detail here), online ordering:1 star. simply put: DO NOT ORDER ONLINE!!!!!! not only is the online ordering system weird (see   ) but it really does go downhill from there. keep reading for a BJ's blow-by-blow. (ha!) i place an order and it says show up 30 minutes later. i show up. she goes over the order and OOPS she didn't enter an item. meaning i have to wait 15 minutes more while they whip it up (a flatbread pizza). lesson learned: online ordering doesn't actually put in an order -- they have to re-type it into their computer systems. turns out at the end we weren't waiting for this flatbread pizza but the lettuce wraps (which were correctly ordered the first time). and then she brings out the food, all done. at which point i notice shrimp on the lettuce wraps. the bf does not eat seafood. me: ""uhh, what is this?"" her: ""it's the thai shrimp lettuce wraps"" me: ""umm, we ordered chicken lettuce wraps"" (reading it directly off my receipt) her: ""uhh, we don't have chicken, just thai shrimp"" she pulls out a menu and points to it. i point to the item directly above. another 15 minute wait while they rush out the chicken wraps. i was offered a sundae for my troubles but turned it down because the bf is lactose intolerant. i suggest maybe a pizookie cookie without ice cream, but she goes in and checks and the manager denies her. (and yet somehow she can offer a full-on sundae?). our consolation prize? two cups of strawberry lemonade. gee thanks. on the upside, i now have thai shrimp lettuce wraps for tomorrow's lunch."
Danny R.,"Fremont, CA",3,39,,2.0,6/1/2009,"The food is good but the service blows. I've been to the fremont location about 10 or so times and while nobody has ever been out right rude to me, however the staff is very inattentive. The main thing that I notice every time i go here is that I have to wait a minimum of 20 minutes before I'm seated, then i'm seated around empty tables? If there are so many empty tables, why did I have to wait half an hour? I dont know what the logic or methodology with their seating approach but it sucks. Luckily they have good beer on tap to mellow me out and stop me from asking ""why the hell was I waiting for 20 minutes?"" over and over. This seating scenario has happened to me on 3 different occasions, i dont get it? ALSO; the menu's are always sticky. WTF? who hands out sticky menu's? How about instead of having the host/hostess up front staring at the wall you have him/her sponge down some menu's? sheezzz.  Now once you get passed the crappy seating, the disinterested staff, and the sticky cola coated menu's; the food is good eats! The chili burger is slammin and the shoe string fries are a must have. I've gotten the Cobb salad here once before and it was HUGE! So if your feeling brave enough to drudge through the lame staff for a good burger and beer, BJ's is worth it."
Gus R.,"Fremont, CA",0,16,1,1.0,12/31/2011,"We have been here many times and have notice the service level has been dropping as time goes by.  The first few times we were here it was great, good food nice atmosphere and friendly people.  I always tip at least 20% so I usually get good service from repeat servers. I don't mind waiting a few minutes and neither does my family so I understand that it's a busy place.   On the second to last night we came here we ordered the same as usual.  Each person in my family has a different favorite dish.  The dishes came out differently and were lacking some ingredients as if they were trying to cut back and make the dish more profitable.  I understand that given the demand of the place and I asked if they were kind enough to include what was in the dishes before and that I knew that I  would have to pay more and didn't mind paying more.  The server kept trying to explain to me that it wasn't included anymore and I understood that the first second.  I kept trying to express that I didn't care that it would cost me more.  Next thing I know I have the manager in front of me with a bad attitude explaining that it wasn't included and that if I must have it they could give it to me to make me happy......!!!!.  I tried to stay calm and told them that it wasn't necessary and that we didn't need to have it. I still tipped well and try to not let it get to me.   I am a small business owner and I understand that owners don't necessarily control what their managers and employees do so I gave the place another chance.  When we got there the server from last time said something to the server we got this time and all of a sudden we were all getting carded for buying a bottle of wine.  Never happened before.  At that moment I knew that I wasn't welcomed and asked to talk to the manager this time.  The guy just laughed at me and said that if I wanted wine I had to be carded.  I said, thank you very much but I would rather go somewhere I can relax to have a nice dinner.  I know that Fremont is well known for bad restaurants but this place is the worst for me so far.  I had some great nights here before but they have taken their hospitality quality to a new low.  I understand that owners don't care much as long as the place is making money but this guys are just plane rude.  I would avoid this place at all costs if you are trying to have a good relaxing time."
David H.,"Fremont, CA",7,178,2,2.0,6/9/2010,"BJ's get's two stars only because they did a nice job with the decor. Otherwise this place is kind of the pits. A hour wait is standard and the food is mediocre at best (bland is the best decription... and I'm talking about blackened chicken breast). They do have a nice selection of home brews and extensive list of Belgian ales that actually impressed me. If you're not with a big group I'd recommend trying to catch a perch at the bar where the turnover seems quicker. Overall I think this place is best avoided, and instead explore the riches of the many food offerings of the area (particularly from Southern and Southeast Asian). Why waste your life on boring food?"
soodteen j.,"San Jose, CA",0,1,,4.0,2/12/2009,New!!! place I like it.  Good Food and Good Dessert  Also I like Strawberry Lemonate Yummy =)  but just a little bit slow for service. I think may be I get there too late at night around 10pm.
Jessika W.,"San Jose, CA",55,14,8,3.0,11/24/2009,"I love Bj's restaurant. But be CAREFUL!!!!.... There is a shady hotel right behind the location. We had out car broken into. Doors were locked, alarm set. Couldn't hear it from inside the restaurant. They stole company laptops. Restaurant experience is fine but I don't know that I could trust my car there again."
Sean C.,"Campbell, CA",0,3,,1.0,12/17/2011,"I have been to other BJ's locations and have always enjoyed myself.  However last night we waited 3 hours for a table.  After being told repeatedly we were next other groups were continually sat before us.  When we finally found a booth in the bar someone pushed past us to sit, the managers only response to this is that the booth was ""first come first serve"".  Needless to say we left and will never be returning again."
Phillip T.,"Pacheco, CA",78,19,,4.0,10/28/2009,"Great place. Good Food. Sometimes service is very fast and sometimes it takes forever to get your food. However, the place rocks!"
