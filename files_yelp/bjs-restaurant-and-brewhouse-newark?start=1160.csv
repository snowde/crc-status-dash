Jennifer G.,"Kansas City, MO",2,12,6,4.0,1/31/2011,"Every time I've eaten at BJ's the food has been either good or great.  I've had the deep dish pizza, shrimp pasta, burger, and the pizookie.  The only dish I had that wasn't great, was the shrimp pasta because the noodles tasted too much like lemon and it was overwhelming...so it was good but not great. If you like sports and beer, this is the place for you.  I'm not into either one, but I know a lot of people are.  They always have at least 2 different games on the big screen tvs, and they have tons of beer options.  They also make their own root beer, but I haven't tried it yet. The reason I can't give it 5 stars is because of the wait time to be seated we experienced the last time we were there.  They do have call ahead seating, and we did call ahead.  So we called ahead, and then drove over and checked in at the desk and they said it would be about 20 minutes more.  That would have been ok, but it ended up being about 45 minutes later that we were finally seated.  They did at least pass out pizza appetizers to those of us waiting to be seated, so at least they were trying to make up for the extremly long wait."
Sarah S.,"Union City, CA",0,12,,4.0,1/28/2011,"I love going to this place with my coworkers and love their signature cocktails. There is wait but it's a good hang out place for friends, family and kids. Their appetizers and platters are enough for 6 people ... it's affordable and a nice place to hang out... if you have more than 10 people and want to go out in dinner time than make sure you call in the noon time to make reservation .. and talk to the mangaer - he or she'll help you out to reserve your seats."
Brian E.,"Newark, CA",0,3,,1.0,12/5/2011,"This place is terrible.  We had reservations for a large group, with confirmation faxes and emails, but when we got there they had no idea we were coming.  Nothing was set up, no food and awful customer service.  The Manager acted like we were inconveniencing him.    Once we showed him the paper work he didn't even apologize.  He and the staff started throwing food at us as fast as possible and wouldn't even honor the endless buffet they had agreed to.  After all this the manager didn't even bother to give us a discount or any sort of complementary entree or beverage.  I don't recommend any body go here!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Connie B.,"Union City, CA",76,6,,1.0,11/24/2012,"Went with co-workers about 11 of us. We were one of the first to be there but those that came in after us were served before us. Their computer system went down and it took forever to get our orders. Half the table was done eating before the rest of us got our food. Horrible! Service was spotty and not very good. Asked for water, never got it. My chicken fettuccine was not cooked all the way and was dry  and not good at all. When I told the waitress she didn't even ask if I wanted something else, oh so sorry was all I got.  Won't be going there again and I suggest u don't either...don't waste your money!"
Amanda S.,"San Jose, CA",0,3,,1.0,1/20/2013,"I am frequently going to this restaurant and last night I was very surprised at the customer service I received. I had left my debit card there and called the restaurant to see if they had it. I was told to call back at 9 pm to talk with a manager several times and they would not let me speak with anyone else. I then got in my car and drove back to the restaurant to see if they had my card. When I got there I asked to speak with a manager and expressed my frustration with the host. The manager did not apologize and just told me that the situation was ""weird"". I am very unimpressed with how I was treated and will NEVER come back to this establishment. This restaurant needs to hire some new employees that actually care about their customers."
Glenda B.,"Hayward, CA",0,10,1,2.0,9/19/2010,"Came in on a Saturday night around 10ish. It wasn't completely busy, but it wasn't slow either. Impressive selection of beers not only on tap but also the bottled-Belgian kind,YUM!  Ordered the Oktoberfest and my friend ordered a Chimay red, as well as an appetizer. Service was prompt, and the wait staff was friendly. The wait staff came by several times to check if we wanted anything else....then several more times after that.....and then several more times after that.  My friend and I got the hint...it was time to move along.  I wasn't sure what to make of the whole experience. It was a little annoying getting interrupted every 10 minutes mid conversation. My friend felt that we were being rushed out of our seats for other customers, but I guess one could take it as them being attentive (even though a little too attentive).  Rating should be 2 1/2 stars. Food & Drinks are great, atmosphere--not so much."
Tammy R.,"Milpitas, CA",0,10,,1.0,11/13/2012,"Horrible horrible customer service. Management needs to change. Reservation at 7:30, were not seated till 8:15, managers reason was that our tables were given to other parties ""on accident."" What's the point of making a reservation if you ask me! Oh, and a person from my party did not recieve their food until after EVERYONE was already finished eating. Very dissatisfied with our visit, and trust me, we will not be visiting this BJ's anytime soon. I do not recommend this BJ's to anyone."
Insatiable Palate M.,"Oakland, CA",2,72,44,1.0,6/3/2012,"This BJ`s was just way too crowded on Friday night 6-1-12. We called ahead but did not experience the benefits. We waited almost 2 hours with 2 disabled adults, 1 special needs child and 2 small children who eventually fell asleep, it was quite an adventure. So we do get seated and after asking repeatedly for a happy hour menu and saying if we wanted to order happy hour at the bar we could go over individually and order our drinks. WE THEN FIND OUT THERE IS NO HAPPY HOUR ON FRIDAY NIGHTS! My husband orders the cheeseburger pizza as he usually does and when it gets to our table we are disappointed.... where are the toppings? Usually this large pizza is chalked full of toppings. We ate, got a free appetizer to split among the 8 of us and left $140.00 later with an added 17% gratuity of course. Just not a good night at BJ`s! We will back back during the week for lunch when the food and service is much much better."
Rox M.,"San Lorenzo, CA",27,325,37,4.0,6/30/2009,"Despite having to wait for a table (ended up being a booth for a party of two, wtf??), even later in the evening, the chicken pizza was surprisingly deeelicious!! The service was good & aside from the wait, it was actually pleasant to eat at BJ's. Drinks were on the house this time around...."
Simone F.,"Oakland, CA",227,129,1511,4.0,6/10/2011,"since i lived in fremont for a while a long time ago and met most of my old time friends from there, it made me ""home sick"" for a bit when sitting at the bar waiting for an old time friend for a pre-dinner drink and snack.  great selections of beer and lots of food to choose from.  i dont have a lot of comments on the food since we only ordered the moz sticks for snacks but it was good for what it is.  will go back for more beer and trying some other food items from the menu."

W B.,"Fremont, CA",3,62,2,3.0,5/19/2010,Food OK.  Service OK.  Beer excellent selection.  Prices good.  -2 stars because it is always crowded.
Deirdre P.,"Boston, MA",1,65,,4.0,8/22/2010,"BJ's Restaurant has a good selection of food, great drinks and good TVs for game watching.  This is a great place for large groups to meet up."
Rudy M.,"Fremont, CA",112,6,,3.0,3/30/2009,"The service here was great. The staff was very attentive and helpful in making selections. The food arrived in a timely manner and the staff always checked with us to see if we needed anything. Unfortunately, I hated what I ordered. I ordered the Cheeseburger Pizza. I wanted to try something new and I should have known better because it sucked. As a pizza it was horrible and as a burger it was bland. Either do a great pizza or a do a great burger but never try to do both at the same time. Avoid this pizza at all cost."
Kira S.,"Union City, CA",24,16,,1.0,6/21/2012,"The service here is HORRIBLE. They must only hire apathetic absentminded people. Every time I've been here, I've had a different waiter/waitress, and I can't think of a single nice thing to say about any of them. There is ALWAYS at least one order messed up at our table, which is amazing since they don't even involve any substitutions - which means they just don't know how to prepare the stuff on their menu?? And the waiter/waitress has never cared - ""oh you didn't order this? are you sure?"" SERIOUSLY? We've had our entrees come out before the salads - we actually had to remind the waiter TWICE about our missing salads - first when he brought the entrees, and again while we were ordering dessert - didn't see him at all between that, we ended up walking up to the bar to replenish our drinks. I've been brought pizookies with cold cookies and half melted ice cream multiple times, and one night our check came with charges for things we didn't even order! Last night, we ordered drinks that the waiter had to come back and confirm THREE times - what the heck were you writing down?? I don't know why I have continued to give this place so many chances. After last night, I probably won't again. There are plenty of places that have better food, and I will just bake my own ""pizookie"" the next time I feel like having one. It's just not worth all the hassle of trying to flag down someone to fix things that shouldn't even be messed up."
Michele M.,"Hayward, CA",21,43,3,4.0,8/18/2011,"I have always enjoyed the food and service at BJ's.  Everything we have tried has been delicious and fresh and very filling.  Recently, we signed up for a fundraising night to promote our 3rd Pancreatic Cancer walk in Fremont, and had a lot of trouble having them fulfill their end.  The date we had secured came and went and we had to end up rescheduling.  My family and I decided to visit last Sat to get it all straightened out and we met with Tom Aragon, the general manager.  Very nice gentleman.  He apologized for the confusion and assured us he will ensure it is all fulfilled this time.  We had lunch as well and they took great care of us.  I should note that last year they did not have the fundraiser program but had donated a gift card for our raffle and we were very touched by their generosity as most of the places we asked did not even give us the consideration of a phone call saying no thank you.  Overall, I am impressed by their concern and willingness to participate in community events.  In this day and age, it speaks volumes about a company to care enough to support the people in their communities.  They have earned a soft spot in my heart and I will advocate for them going forward.  Thanks BJ's!!!"
Daniel W.,"Hayward, CA",0,17,,4.0,11/23/2010,Certainly a kids hang out. If you are not up for dining with teenagers and college students this this isn't the place for you. Once you get past that though I found the food to be pretty good and the beers to be simply awesome.  Service is good. I never had an inexperienced server and always plenty of parking.
California R.,"San Jose, CA",37,155,,3.0,4/8/2010,"I ordered take out but the food here was good. I ordered the ribs and chicken combo and man it was worth it. I mean my boss did offer lunch to hey, good hard or home right? The plate that came in was huge and filled with bbq sauce the way I like it. Id go back for take out again."
Colin P.,"San Francisco, CA",27,597,43,3.0,11/8/2010,Food was good. Took awhile to be seated for a Saturday night. Food service a bit slow. But manager was very accommodating.
Allie H.,"Castro Valley, CA",3,14,1,5.0,7/11/2012,LOVE this place. They have gluten free pizza AND gf pazookie! The service is friendly and quick. We've been several times and our servers have always been courteous and attentive. The food has never disappointed in quality or quantity!
