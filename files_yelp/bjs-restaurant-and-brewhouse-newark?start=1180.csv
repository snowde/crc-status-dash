Will C.,"Queens, NY",2269,594,473,1.0,1/22/2009,"The staff is poorly trained. After dropping a pizza dish into one of the kids meal, anyone with common sense would offer to replace the dish right away. This review is based on service."
Kim R.,"San Francisco, CA",548,284,37,3.0,12/8/2009,"The food here is either a hit or a miss depending on what you order.  I had the chicken sandwich here, it wasn't the greatest.  I use to like the pizza here, but its gone downhill on taste its very doughy, thick and not enough cheese & sauce.  Their pastas on the other hand is pretty good so far.  The margarita I ordered was really strong here, not like TGIF where they skim on the alcohol and pour mostly sweet&sour.  I've ordered this one drink twice on different days and they were completely different in taste, not good.  Consistency is very important especially if you want the customer to order it again.  It's opened late and serves all sorts of beer.  Parking is typically easy to find."
Degustator J.,"Newark, CA",4,71,69,4.0,2/23/2009,"One of those wickedly spacious, almost ""too popular"" for its own good places - sometimes wait is over an hour - not because they are that busy, but because their staff is a little on the slow side. Food is pretty awesome, reasonably priced, well made and of good variety. Beer is drinkable - standard middle of the road micro brew variety. Kids food is cheap and portions are large. Huge TV screens everywhere, great place to catch a game with buddies if you arent trying to actually hear the game and rather focus more on the friends, the appetizers (wings) and brews. Loud nostalgic tunes from the 80s - yay! Much better deal than the Red Robins across the street - definitely kicking their ass."
Andy M.,"San Ramon, CA",0,8,,1.0,5/27/2011,Extremely disappointed with staff attitude and service. Big NO although I am BJ's fan. I'd stick to elephant bar or some other joints. I almost see arrogance in every staff member including manager which is weird.
Lynn C.,"Union City, CA",5,23,19,4.0,3/21/2010,"So my friends and I decided to go to BJ's for my birthday. The wait wasn't too long but our waitress on the other hand, totally disappeared after taking our order. When we asked this other waiter who came to help us, he said he'll be the one helping us since our waitress went on break WITHOUT telling us. Anyways, this new waiter made everything better. He was funny and nice. Overall an okay experience."
Ru R.,"Newark, CA",55,55,3,3.0,6/24/2010,"Good place to go when you got no other ideas. Food is okay, nothing exciting but the pizza there is pretty damn good. Plenty of parking and the bar is good jus a little costly compared to other spots. Never had any bad staff serve me when I was there either."
D C.,"Fremont, CA",1,23,1,4.0,8/15/2010,"My friends & lost our jobs on March 26, when NUMMI closed. We been having monthly reunions every months since then and BJ's is the only restaurant that we been to twice, has a nice bar, the service and food is good. Plus the price is right for us, since we're all living on unemployment. I really like this place but don't know if we can afford to come here once our unemployment runs out!"
Ammar K.,"Fremont, CA",5,13,1,5.0,8/11/2010,"I had the BBQ Beef with the Oreo Dessert. They both tasted AMAZING! They have their own special made BBQ Sauce which is the best! And dont even get me started on the Oreo Dessert, it was I like my brain and my mouth were having sex. It has scoops of vanilla ice cream served on a bed of freshly hot cooked cake like Oreo's, the BEST."
Sarah S.,"Pleasanton, CA",94,94,4,3.0,9/20/2009,"Oh just a typical friday night! What to do? Where to start?  We decide on BJ's. Start our evening with a couple cocktails and some fine dining. Foodwise, BJ's generally does not disappoint. On this particular evening, I seem to remember there being an hour wait and my boyfriend and I wanting to kill some time in the bar as we daydreamed about delicious avocado rolls and pizookies. I stood looking for a table and my bf went to round up some drinks for us, a few moments later I hear my name being called and look over to see my bf motioning for my attention, I assume they wanted to check my id, I understand, I get it, I am 24 years old and look about 19 or 20. I obliged and walked over, ID in hand. The stupid bitch of a bartender says snootily ""we need the real ID, not the fake one."" She followed the comment with what can only be described as a half-assed, watered down witch cackle. I was taken aback, and responded with an ""oh."" I've never even had a fake ID, and what the fuck is up with people who are the same age as me criticizing my age? Bullshit. What a stupid bitch.  Food was delicious as ever, and we were seated shortly after that incident. Service was fine. If I was reviewing based on that experience alone, I'd give it one star. But because the food is delicious, I'll give it three. Still waiting to find a BJs that has all the components of fine dining, they have it all completely down except for the staff.  Stupid cow!"
Alicia K.,"Alameda, CA",12,52,2,1.0,1/5/2009,"BJ'S IN FREMONT BLOWS!! I used to frequent BJ's while living in Los Angeles County and it was my favorite cheap eat with good beer, decent service, and tons of sports on many TV's.  My best friend and I were on our way to Red Robin yesterday and saw BJ's in Fremont and were excited to go there instead...to our dismay.  There was ONE game playing on ALL screens??? Ok, whatever, it was the football game but I'd rather see a variety of sports.   Our experience at the Fremont location was so horrible I'm tempted to stand in the parking lot and warn customers before getting to the door.  I don't expect much from a joint like this so to taking time to write a long review on a brewery... tells you just how bad it is!   We sat in the bar at a six top and there were tons of open seats in the bar and throughout the entire restaurant.  We sat and watched over 10 (yes I was counting) employees cruise right by us, talk at the terminals, chat at the kitchen entry doors for 15 minutes until we were finally rudely greeted with menus that were tossed in front of us.   10 minutes after that our server returned and said, ""Can I get you something to drink?""  After 25 minutes you can get us a lot more than something to drink...you should've at least brought out some water.  We were very polite though so she had no clue we were frustrated.  We placed our order and we were splitting two entrees so the waitress suggested a particular burger they're known for...so I ordered it.  We ordered rasberry lambic's and the server didn't know what we were talking about at all?? They have a total of 3 ciders on the menu...you'd think they'd know 'em...guess not.  After she continued speaking it was obvious that she's not the sharpest tool in the shed...lol.   Our salads were brought out in about 10 minutes (35 minutes seated and still no water, no drinks, no silverware) and I sware to you...they tasted like dirt...they were just regular side salads but I don't know if the lettuce wasn't washed or what but it was gross not to mention that the bleu cheese dressing was so runny it ran right off of the dirty lettuce and carrots. So we were quick to put those aside with our fork and napkins left in them.  Then our drinks were FINALLY brought out without water...after food had been served...after sitting without silverware and salads in front of us.  The salad plates sat on our table in front of us until the end.   Then our food was brought out.  The best employee was the food runner...she was 10x's better than our server...hell, she was our server...we wanted to tip her alone...hahaha.  The menu item that the ding bat waitress suggested and that I ordered is not what I received.  I guess her stupid self decided to order something else?????  We asked for water but never got any, we saw our server go to every table around us and I would have liked to send back whatever it is that I got but no one ever came around to do so.  I ate the 1/2 of my friends meal and left my plate sitting hoping to tell our server.  She never came.  We went to the bar to replenish our drinks since the server was no where to be found and when we ordered rasberry lambic's, the EXACT same thing we just ordered and that is on TAP, the bartender didn't know what we were talking about...we had to point it out to him...WOW!!  Are you kidding me?  He also didn't know how to transfer the ticket to our table which was dead center of the bar.   The server finally came around and we asked for the check.  She left the four dirty plates and six glasses on the table and had the check back to us in 10 seconds....dead serious.  We didn't see her the entire meal but back in 10 seconds with our check.  The fastest service we received was our check to get us out of there...what a welcoming warm feeling...hahaha.   Remember on pretty woman when Julia Roberts goes back the boutique and asks the saleswoman, ""Do you work on commission?....BIG MISTAKE!"" hahaha...that's what I felt like telling her.  My best friend and I are HUGE tippers as we appreciate the fact that serving is hard work and they work for tips as they make minimum wage.  My best friend asked for the check and the check was set in front of me.  I immediately handed it to my friend in front of the waitress and she placed her credit card and gave it back.  She processed the credit card in under one minute and again placed it in front of me...wtf!!??   I wrote a lengthy comment on the back of the credit card receipt and we left her $1.51 as an insult...hahaha...I can't remember the last time we did that....it's been a long time and we eat out a lot and although we've had bad service this extreme combination of customer abuse was unacceptable!! It's sad really because I really liked BJ's and we were so excited seeing one close by...oh well...all I can say is DO NOT GO TO THE FREMONT LOCATION!  No one should have to pay for that type of utter disregard in a service oriented business...WOW! BOOOOOOOO BJ's!!!"
Reina A.,"Oakland, CA",1,27,3,4.0,8/28/2009,"I love BJs! Their portions are large. Great atmosphere and food. Their drinks are delicious! And oh goodness, the pazookies are to die for! Especially the Oreo pazookies! My fave dish is their crispy chicken salad! Only 4 stars because they took away some of my fave mixed drinks from their menu :("
Kat M.,"Union City, CA",133,461,114,1.0,5/2/2009,"Not so happy with BJ's Restaurant right now.  I call at 5:15 and after 25 plus rings someone finally answers  and I request to be put on the call ahead seating for 5:45 p.m..  She tells me that there is no wait and to come on in.  I insist that I want to be put on the ""list"" for 5:45 and again she says there is no wait and to come in...""it shouldn't be a problem to get seated right away"".  Oh yeah?  You wanna make a bet?  We get there and there are people spilling out all over the place.  The wait time?  25 minutes.  How can it go from no wait to 25 minutes in 15 minutes?  I don't get it.  I tell the girl behind the desk that I called and she told me there was no wait and how I wanted to get on the ""list"".  I'm super good with voices so I KNOW she is the one I spoke to.  She apprehensively says she's sorry and tells me that at the time of my call there was no wait.  I ask to speak to the manager who apologizes too and says he can get us a table in 5 minutes.  The hubby is too pissed and the kids too hungry...we ended up at Claim Jumper where we did not have to wait to get seated and served immediately.  Thanks Claim Jumper!!!!"
Joe Y.,"Livermore, CA",93,225,4,2.0,11/13/2008,"The latest of this national chain (of what I call the Applebees of Brewery restaurants) opened in Newark recently. The food is what is to be expected. Burgers, chicken sandwiches, pasta, salads, make your own topping pizzas, and fish tacos. I had the SPECIALTY CALZONE: BJ's classic pizza dough stuffed with a rich, creamy mixture of spinach and artichoke hearts, cream cheese and mozzarella. Oven-baked and topped with a bruschetta medley. I've had better at Pizza Hut for half the price. What I really came to try was the beer. I'm a beer snob. I had BJ'S Jeremiah Red:  An Irish-style red ale with the full-bodied richness of an English old ale. Brewed with a secret blend of five imported specialty malts. Not too hoppy in order to emphasize the complex malt flavor and fruity aroma. It is an excellent example of a mass produced brewery red. Hard to find this style of beer available year round in small micro-breweries. I also tried the IPA, but have had much better at the local brewery in Fremont.  All in all, I thought the service was acceptable, bartenders actually could pour beer, and the atmosphere was typical of their other locations. If I want a quick beer while in the area, I might stop by again. Just skip the food. There is better at Denny's across the freeway."
Chich R.,"Hayward, CA",7,13,2,3.0,5/28/2009,"Food is expensive and inconsistent. However, the menu holds a wide variety of different flavors. Pizookie is what keeps me coming back, that desert alone deserves 5 stars!"
Michelle D.,"Hayward, CA",19,125,116,3.0,2/28/2009,"this place was cool for the most part. i agree with noel that the parking is horrific and needs attention. be careful to not drive around the parking lot @ night while tipsy, for you may accidentally run into an unsuspecting curb. lol. the food, however, was very good and was a great lunch buy. mmmm"
Diana C.,"San Jose, CA",0,2,,2.0,6/3/2010,"2.5 stars. went there last night (Wednesday night, around 830PM). party of 2. no wait on the table. however, the waiteress wasn't exactly friendly. she didn't even look at us when she was taking orders. we had no utensils when the food arrived. dropped off the bill even when i was still trying to finish my food (i was working hard trying to finish, not just sitting there chit chatting). took her forever to come back for the credit card. i don't know if it was just this waitress, but i had the same experience a few months back.i just thought i was unlucky. food was OK.  probably won't go back until i run out of places to eat and forgot how service kinda suck here."
Jennifer H.,"San Jose, CA",25,54,6,4.0,10/8/2009,"Yes, this IS a chain but it's my favorite chain. I typically go to 2 different locations.  This is one of them but I'll review both locations on this post. Despite how many times my high school friends and I have been here, we still come back for the following reasons: 1. Even though the wait takes a long time, we can always chill at the bar.   2. The atmosphere is great. 3. One time we happened to catch happy hour during the FInal Four.  Mini pizzas are only $5 and some drinks half off. 4. I really like their pizzas. 5. The other food is good too. 6. I never had bad service no matter which location. 7. My boyfriend and I don't have ESPN so we've been going to BJs to watch MNF.  TVs on every corner and wall. 8. MNF is awesome there because everyone is into the game and it just adds to the atmosphere. (Plus, I believe MNF is during happy hour). 9. The beers are really good.  My favorite is the Jeramiah Red (sp?)  There must be something in the beer because everytime I come, I get buzzed pretty quick (like after 1/2).  It's a great feeling.  The other drinks are really tasty too. 10. Everytime I come, it's like a party.  We always have fun. The food is satisfyingly perfect for when you want to drink."
Seb. M.,"Hayward, CA",4,13,1,4.0,3/29/2010,"The last time I visited BJ's was for a get together. Service was good. I think we changed tables about 3 times, and the servers were all accommodating. We ended up at the bar since we went there for the ""ambiance."" The bar has an open floor plan, with good lighting.  As for food, you should at least try one of their pizza's. Lip smackin' good. Crust is crispy on the bottom, yet the toppings are not overly dry. Right amount of crust, sauce, and toppings. The portion for a large pizza is enough for one person to share if needed. Goes great with the Hefeweizen beer they have on tap.  It can get busy at times, but I've been lucky thus far and had no issues thus far."
Tyler L.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,12,,2.0,5/27/2009,"Most corporate, franchises, and places like that have consistency in their food and service.  I give this place 2 stars for their consistency in food, and incosistency in the ladder.  A couple of friends and I drank at the bar and the bill was more or less a hundred, that's fine because it was expected.  We paid it with our card and left a twenty in cash for tip.  The waitress stops by and says that she's got a few more drinks to add onto the tab, I said go ahead, the card's right there.  She looks at the twenty and looks back at me and says it's more.  I mean, come on, you can't be serious.  You're going to nickle and dime a drunk person and then expect that person to pay extra tip when he already threw down 20% on the existing bill?  Go to the BJ's in Cupertino, and forget about this place."
Chris C.,"Newark, CA",0,6,,4.0,7/11/2012,"Great food, great service.  I like this place, but you have to try to get there before 6:00 to avoid a wait of more than 30 minutes most days.  They're usually pretty busy.  I've eaten here many times, and the only time that I was disappointed was when I ordered steak."
