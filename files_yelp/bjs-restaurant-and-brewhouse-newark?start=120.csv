Bryan M.,"Newark, CA",1,4,,1.0,4/5/2017,"Normally I like BJ's, their food is consistent and their service is reasonably good for a place as busy as they are... Tonight, however, I ordered take out and it took over an hour for the food the be ready. We showed up at the time the BJ's app selected, and then waited for 40 minutes for the food the be ready.  When the food got home, tomatoes of the food was cold or soggy after sitting there for 30 minutes waiting for the pizza.  This may be the last I eat there."
Navi G.,"Newark, CA",24,29,76,2.0,2/4/2017,Today's review was ugh... not good....food was reasonable.. but we lost our appetite due to lack to of service... waiter was missing most of the time... not sure if he was new... he seemed lost most of the time. He didn't follow up with us at all...   We have had better days here... waiters make a big difference.
Laura C.,"San Francisco, CA",0,29,5,1.0,10/15/2016,"Although I love BJ's this particular location was horrible and very unprofessional.  Slow service, cold food and through out our whole dinner water from the ceiling was dropping on us and our food.  When we asked to speak to a manager the manager didn't come for about 10 min and when she did she seemed very overwhelmed and didn't want to address the problem. Instead she questioned us as if we were lying and proceeded to take the food off the table and throw the receipt on the table just charging us for our drinks. No sorry or any compassion. Very disappointed.  For being such a well known corporation and obviously a million dollar business you would think they would apologize and offer some type of compensation.  Will never return to this location again."
Kaynesha W.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,17,1,5.0,11/5/2017,"Our waiter , Jason was amazing ! He is the reason why we will be back . Food was great too but customer service was off of the charts ! Thank you so much !"
Jessica S.,"Concord, CA",2,5,1,5.0,8/13/2017,The reason this place is getting 5 start is only because of their food. The customer service is vary. I went there last week and I was disappointed in the customer service. But I visited it again to celebrate my brother's birthday and their service is amazing. Overall their food is definitely worth a try.
Gerardo C.,"San Mateo, CA",7,8,2,2.0,7/29/2017,"Food and service was okay but I have to say that their reservation system sucks my family and I came in today Saturday, July 29, 2017 checked in at 4:45party of 8 I was quoted approximately 30 to 35 minutes wait it turned out to be 1 hour"
S K.,"Torrance, CA",0,17,,2.0,8/4/2017,"Food so does not taste good here. Only came bc it was the only thing open at 11pm. Got the pizza ( 1/2 bj favorite and  1/2 chicken bacon) and the sampler appetizer platter.  The ""deep dish"" Pizza is 90% bread! Appetizers try to copy others (i.e. Avocado egg rolls from Cheesecake Factory) and fail miserably. We couldn't eat the chicken wings with the *something* chipotle sause. Tasted sooo sweet and weird. I gave it a 2 star only bc the waiter was nice and friendly. Otherwise it would have been a 1 star!!!"
Al-Leigh R.,"Anaheim, CA",108,14,1,1.0,8/6/2016,"Wait went faster than expected & everyone we encountered was nice enough but... 1. Brought my bf the wrong food. We weren't going to say anything but bc of the price difference in the items, decided to bring it to the waitress's attention. She said she rang it in wrong & would fix it. Manager came by to apologize. 2. Second food order comes out. French fries are missing. Again, we aren't going to say anything but then I notice a long hair in the food. We're done.  At this point we have both barely eaten bc I was waiting to start eating until he got the correct order. We tell the waitress and a manager we just want the check, we're frustrated & kind of grossed out. They offer to take off his food, but not mine which doesn't seem right, but oh well I guess. No pizookie for us :("
Patricia C.,"Santa Maria, CA",78,23,3,5.0,5/15/2017,"Obviously this place is good it's always packed with people that's always a good sign , The food is great and service is good ."
Pavan A.,"San Jose, CA",0,1,,1.0,5/12/2017,"Attitude, Rude, Worst ambience, Bad Service...what not..?? Definitely this not the place you want to spend your Friday night....!!! Hate it...will never visit this BJ's....!!!"
Sherrie J.,"Los Gatos, CA",0,29,1,1.0,12/23/2016,"Came here with some friends on a Thursday night and waited 2 hours for a table (understandable since it was so busy). The reason for the 1 star are multiple things: 1) the hostess that brought us to our table just threw the menus at us  2) did not bring drinks for the whole table and when we requested drinks, she came back 15 minutes later with the rest of them  4) original waitress left and didn't say she was leaving; another waitress took our orders (this isn't a big deal, but almost, if not all the times that this is happened to me, I've had the server tell me he/she was leaving and that someone else would be helping us; maybe this isn't customary?) 5) food orders were wrong  6) dessert orders took way too long (30+ minutes for a pizookie...) We kind of felt she forgot, and when I asked about the status of our order, the 2nd waitress said they were taking care of it (it was brought out about 15 minutes later so it seems like she forgot it and just placed the order for it when I reminded her) Overall, the food was meh for BJs, but I'm hoping that's just a one time thing and not a lack of flavor in their food overall. The service wasn't that great and could use some improvement."
Rebekah N.,"Hayward, CA",74,41,35,5.0,4/10/2016,"Okay honestly I didn't expect much from this restaurant based on the reviews but I actually really enjoyed our food and service. Food: I ordered a mini deep dish pizza with pepperoni and pesto and it was SOO GOOD. Fluffy crust and bread and lots of cheeses I really enjoyed it despite the fact that I got a mini which is literally he size of my hand. However, with an appetizer it was enough for me. My boyfriend ordered meatball marinara and he enjoyed it as well. It was a lot of food for two the appetizer and drinks really filled us up Drinks: I ordered a root beer but the kind that it "" all natural"" and made in house. It does not come with ice so I got that too and I enjoyed it. Very concentrated so I recommend ice and my boyfriend ordered the strawberry splash. I tried it and it was decent I guess I'm not a alcoholic slushy drink type of person but if you like sweet and slushy get it!  Service: our servers name was Joselyn and she was so nice. It took her long to come to us but she explained that it was due to confusions with tables. I appreciated the clearing up of things. Either than that she was very attentive and bright everything right when I asked for it. She is pretty, friendly, and I will totally come back due to her good service Overall: I enjoy everything from my appetizer to my drinks and my meal which is why I think this deserves such a lengthy Yelp review. :)"
Kevin A.,"Union City, CA",0,1,,1.0,5/8/2017,"In short: Stay away from this establishment. Corporate needs to step in.  I arrived on a Sunday evening with a party of four. The restaurant itself was somewhat crowded so I was expecting to have to wait for a table - which I did, no big deal. My party and I are seated in an uncomfortably dark area isolated from most of the other restaurant patrons. As I fear and expect we are left waiting for nearly ten minutes before a waiter attends to us, again no big deal.  At first he seems like a nice guy, a bit awkward but nice, I'll refrain from using his name as I don't want to publicly humiliate him for what follows. He proceeds to take our drink and food order and again we wait another solid ten minutes before he returns with our drinks. As he begins to hand out our beverages he spills a noticeable amount on the table, my arm, and my clothing. I catch him look down but he makes absolutely no effort to rectify the situation - no apology as he quickly dashes from our table to check his phone at a register station.  Another ten or so minutes pass before our appetizers are brought to the table. Stuffed mushrooms with spinach and cheese. One would think - 'how hard is it to possibly mess up a stuffed mushroom'. Well you guessed it, BJs did. They were not only cold and flavorless but about the size of a quarter. Awesome.  At this point I call for a manager, something I've never done at any other establishment, ever. A couple minutes pass before a middle aged women approaches the table and asks what the problem is. I begin to explain the situation to her and she looks noticeably uncomfortable as if she has no idea how to handle the situation. She offers to refund us and bring our meals out regardless but at this point I've lost my appetite, I tell her I simply want to pay for what I've consumed and leave. She agrees and apologizes and leaves to grab our check for us. Again we wait for what seems like another ten minutes before a waiter comes to our table with a comp'd check and apologizes to us, ""sorry our manager is dealing with another problem right now, she'll be out in a few more minutes."". Unreal. We gathered our things and walked out the door.  Never before have I experienced such horrible service from the top down. From the host staff, to the servers, even the management. Every aspect was abysmal. Never again will I return to this particular establishment. There is however one shining star here - April. She's a magnificent employee who deserves much better than this joke of a restaurant."
Vicky T.,"Santa Cruz, CA",446,2659,990,3.0,10/1/2016,"During baseball season, this has been a go-to place to eat before taking Bart to Oakland. The service is reasonable and there is an additional parking lot across the street near the gas station. Nothing stands out as a spectacular, but the french dip and the kale salad are decent. Drinks are usually refilled multiple times and the wait is never long."
Prabhleen B.,"Sacramento, CA",0,15,9,1.0,7/31/2017,"This was absolutely the WORSE experience I've ever had at a BJs restaurant. We had been waiting for 40 mins to get a table. When we were finally seated; we asked if there was any way we could get a booth table and we don't mind waiting. The host showed us so much attitude and said most of these are booked for bigger parties mind you we were a party of 6. When the server came to us, we asked him as well, because we saw a booth opening up. She said that the party AFTER us were given that; and we told her we should've been giving that especially after requesting it. We just sat down at our table and began looking at our menu. We ordered appetizers, which came out but we had NO utensils or plates, also have yet to receive our drinks. After this happened to us we asked to speak to the manager. The manager came and she was unapologetic, as well as making excuses for the host. She did absolutely nothing to solve the problem and just brushed it off.   While we are talking to the manager, the host comes up and starts listening in to our conversation. Finally it took so long for the server to actually place our order. I am a regular at BJs so seeing this kind of service was very upsetting  to me. I wouldn't recommend anyone to go here. The service was horrible, Food was so so. Overall very disappointed."
Steven O.,"West Linn, OR",10,49,5,1.0,7/15/2017,"Customer service is awful here, they gave away our table when we were standing right there. Then the hostess showed a group of people who came after us to a table that we were waiting for. Will never attend here again. Then when we called her on it, she started to say we could sit at the bar. Only when did we get tough did she actually make a decision and got us a table."
Sowmya S.,"San Mateo, CA",114,113,484,4.0,3/18/2016,"Huge quantities of food!  This place was a surprise for us - we didn't expect it to be that big and nice looking! I actually loved the high ceilings, the cute chandeliers and the decor!  The lady who attended for us was very nice and friendly. She patiently helped me pick a 'sweet' cocktail. We ordered a buffalo chicken grilled sandwich and a shrimp asparagus penne and they were both very flavorful and tasty. We couldn't finish the pasta, it was huge!  There is a lot of parking available although I heard it's usually full. One thing I didn't like was all other BJs in other places could be reserved using open table but this Newark BJ's never showed up! Too bad!"
Veronika S.,"Castro Valley, CA",49,11,1,4.0,10/14/2017,"This review is primarily for Roddy, the manager. Tonight's dinner started out terrible. Checked in, quoted a wait of 25 minutes, after 25 minutes told it would be an additional 20 minutes because we were misquoted originally. Quite irritated but whatever. After an additional 20 minutes, told it would be another indefinite period of time because of the call aheads. Frustrated, we talked to a manager. We wouldn't have stayed if it would have been over an hour. The manager, Roddy, was very polite and seated us almost immediately. After waiting at the table for about 5 minutes with no server greeting us, he quickly came by and apologized, took our order and brought us drinks. After a terrible beginning to the meal, Roddy single handedly saved the night. If it wasn't for him we would have been extremely upset , but his professionalism and attentiveness made the night worth it. Thank you Roddy!"
Nixon L.,"San Francisco, CA",34,61,10,1.0,2/20/2017,"Came here with my friend Sunday and the crowed was average. We ordered calamari as appetizer , our main food and coffee all at the same time. Calamari came and coffee - so far so good. Then came our main dish but they got my friend's food wrong. The waiter apologized and said he will take off the calamari from our bill as a courtesy. We waited for another 15 mins for the correct order to come, meanwhile I did not touch my food because it's nice to eat together. When the food came I asked for more coffee. The coffee came and it was cold and probably not freshly brewed. So I complained. Then came our bill and the waiter went back on his word and charged me for the calamari. What's worse is that my friend said the women's restroom was dirty and lacked toilet papers. This place needs to step it up."
Jeanette L.,"Fremont, CA",35,1,,2.0,9/15/2016,"I don't normally leave reviews. But this is the third time I have been in here and the new bartender is just not good. My mom had to send back her margarita because it was done horribly, tasted like no margarita I have ever had.  For me, he has messed up a simple bloody Mary 3 times, once it didn't even come with olives. I know that may sound harsh but this place used to have the best bloody Mary's around. So to go from the best to the worst is quite a landslide. Today I made sure to ask for all the fixings with my drink, he said they only had olives and limes. What happened to the tasty spicy glass rim and the Peruvian cherry pepper... For goodness sake, at least a stalk of freaking celery would be nice!  Food has taken a bit of a nose dive in the past few months also. Too bad, this was my go to place for a quick lunch and drink."
