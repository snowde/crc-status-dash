Cheryl B.,"Redondo Beach, CA",351,221,793,4.0,8/5/2009,"YUM!  Just got back from a quick lunch here and BJ's still hadn't let me down.  Where else can you get a tasty wedge salad and mini 1-topping pizza for $5.95?  I looove me some pan pizza!  B had the crisp chicken salad (tasty), and I tried a cup of their clam chowder (also very good!).  Good deal.  Our server was also very nice and checked on us often.  I thought my strawberry lemonade was a little too sweet, but who cares - I enjoyed my lunch and wish I had eaten there for dinner last night instead of the crappy Applebee's down the street."
Theresa L.,"Union City, CA",153,173,49,5.0,9/14/2009,"I might be a bit biased because my friend used to work there and this is our group of friends' favorite place to meet up and catch up so lots of good memories here. BUT the food is still good! I love the spicy spaghetti with meatballs. The bread it comes with just adds even more flavor to an already good thing :) The appetizers are bomb..good enough to eat as a meal. When youre not super hungry, the portions are just right. The pizookie is the icing on the cake! You could totally make it at home, but sharing it with 5 good friends is totally worth however much it costs. Drinks are decent. My boyfriend's favorite is the buffalo bite, similar to DnB's snakebite, but it's not my cup of tea."
Eegnam A.,"Castro Valley, CA",51,425,,3.0,9/8/2009,"Always a long wait during dinner.  They do have a call ahead option that I would strongly suggest.  The food here is like any other BJs.  I like the chicken wings, chicken lettuce cups, turkey club and of course the pizookie!  I tried the ribs last time and they were good.  Soft on the inside, could have used more sauce though.  The skinny fries here are really addicting.  I like this place for a casual dinner."
Lauren F.,"Castro Valley, CA",24,9,1,4.0,6/18/2012,"4 stars... don't get me wrong. i love the food (try the stuffed potato- a baked potato with grilled chicken, broccoli, cheese and sour cream inside) but the line is just crazy every time i come here. it usually doesn't stop me but i find it annoying"
JAYE m.,"San Jose, CA",4,25,16,1.0,3/30/2009,"i wanna rate this place but i cant i've never been thier, but i herd great reviews about it and my boy's always talking about this beer they got thier called a tatonka i love beer so im have to slide by to bj's one time. well i guess i cant post this till i rate it so im give it a 1 till then i'll rate it better next time."
RdWin G.,"Fremont, CA",3,5,,2.0,11/5/2011,"called to see if they took reservations...""Corrine"" answered the phone in a manner that conveyed I was interrupting her! Guess I'll see how the food & service will be...it'll be my first time there...their ""first"" impression isn't so great...we'll see"
jen r.,"Fremont, CA",2,43,1,1.0,12/15/2011,"this review is merely on the Happy Hour...  never again. their HH deals are horrible....  $1 off beer?  there's gotta be better deals in the area!   unless you're there specifically for the pizookie, food is largely forgettable.  we even made a mistake of ordering their ahi poke and it was tuna mush... i'm still expecting for the food poisoning to commence.   fried calamari was ok.   i've had way better pizzas. what bugged me the most was the sucky service during HH.  we walked in at 4:30pm and the main dining area was completely empty and the bar area was maybe a third full of other HH'ers.  it took forever and a day to get our food.    then when we were done, it took our server 20 mins  after she said ""i'll get your bill right NOW""  to actually give us our bill.  bar area wasn't even all that busy, so i didn't get what the hold up was all about.  nevertheless... major fail!"
Ada S.,"Milpitas, CA",6,47,28,1.0,10/29/2013,"Am I the only one who notice the difference in their pizzas?  I don't know what happened but the quality of their pizzas went down the drain. I remembered about 2-3 years ago that their pizzas are cheesier with a lot more toppings.  The first time I noticed the difference was about 2 years ago. I really thought they forgot to add pizza sauce and cheese because it was that dry!  It was replaced by the same tasting pizza so I thought the cook was probably different that night. I finally gave it another try last Friday only to be once again disappointed.  I had to ask for a pizza sauce on the side but that didn't help.  I'm not sure if this is the only location that serves the dry pizza but my best friend who also loved BJ's pizza at one point noticed the same thing from the Socal area where she lives. Their thai shrimp lettuce wrap was also not as good as I remembered it.  Our server was very friendly and energetic but his breath was really bad.  Oh, they tried twice to serve us pizzas that wasn't ours.  The first attempt was a female server who at least asked if the pizzas she was holding was our order and clearly it was not because I didn't see greens which should have been the bell peppers so I told her it was not our order.  Five minutes later, a male came with the same looking pizza but this time this server did not ask if it was our order. He just automatically tried to place the pizza on our table until I stopped him and said that was not our pizza because I don't see any veggies on it. Lame!  3/4 star for the pazookie and 1/4 star for the calamari."
Skyttle D.,"Fremont, CA",80,61,3,5.0,9/23/2009,"This place has the most amazing food ever_very delicious! Great customer service as well as great friendly servers/waiters. Wait time for a table was quite long (1hr 45min), but it was worth the wait."
Alan N.,"San Francisco, CA",49,158,4,2.0,8/14/2009,After being away from the states for 2 years and coming back home to see how much more fat americans are compared to the rest of the world... then I go to BJ's and it explains everything.  The portions are huge.  Quantity over quality.
Alan D.,"Fremont, CA",30,11,1,4.0,5/22/2011,I don't understand the negative reviews I have been there more times than I can count.  Only once did it take a long time for food.  I have been to the yard house twice and so far I prefer BJ's food.  Can't beat the beer at the house though.
Lady S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,29,,3.0,3/23/2012,This place is ok.  Their menu could be a little better.  Their pizza is really good though.  I don't like that their breakfast menu is only on Saturday and Sunday.  I go here when in a hurry during the week.  Love the curb side pickup.  Never had problems with the service.
Erica T.,"Reno, NV",151,118,36,3.0,6/22/2009,"I thought it was just San Bruno and San Mateo, but I'm glad to know that all BJ's restaurants have a ridiculous wait time!  We decided to grab a beer in the bar while we waited for 45 minutes for our table.  Of course the bar was just as packed, but we were able to score one stool at the end of the bar (thanks to the lady who decided to give up the stool that her sweater was sitting on!?!).  The bartender was very pleasant and served us right away (no need to throw money in their direction!).  She even let my boyfriend test-drive some of the IPA's they had on tap before committing.  I tried out the new flatbread pizza appetizers, which I ate as a meal, and they were quite tasty.  Good bang for your buck!  My wedge salad had a bit too much dressing on it, but who needs to cry over spilled bleu cheese!  All in all, BJ's is relatively consistent with their food, beer and long wait time!"
L W.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,6,,1.0,3/1/2011,"This time around the service was horrible. The buzzer didn't work, the lady who sat us forgot to transfer my bar tab to my table, and my server forgot my gravy for the mash potatoes. Horrible service tonight."
be q.,"Union City, CA",0,8,6,3.0,11/21/2010,"Good food, bad services!  Been here twice for lunch on the weekend, the place is full, the food is quite good, especially the Thai shrimp wrap.  The waiter was not attentive.  Keep forgetting to bring us ultensiles, cordiments etc."
E N.,"Hayward, CA",91,18,6,1.0,7/26/2010,"beware,  our car got robbed in broad daylight, in the bj's parking lot. bad area with zero security!!!! the staff told us that this is an ongoing problem but said they couldn't do anything about it. they said security was not their responsibility even though it happens often in their parking lot. just want to warn everyone!!!!!"
Jess C.,"Fremont, CA",25,59,7,3.0,10/23/2011,"Fun atmosphere. If you call ahead, wait is not too bad. Food is mixed. I like to order the jambalaya, but sub the rice for pasta. Pizza is terrible. Don't even try. Pizookie always please as do the drinks."
paul t.,"Santa Clara, CA",73,83,1,3.0,12/28/2008,"I had me a cesar salad, tomato brisque, & the bruschetta. Cesar salad was well balance and the soup was a tad salty for my taste but was okay. THe worst offender is the buttery greasy bruschetta thay had. Traditionally bruschetta is great with baugettes with a light drizzle of olive oil but this place actually butter the hell out of there bread which is not the business. Would i eat here again? yea of course, try the other dishes but if it aint happening once, twice, and 3x your out!"
Julie G.,"Hayward, CA",7,31,,3.0,9/3/2009,"Went here again last week when family was visiting from out of town. We had 6 people and a baby and did call ahead seating for lunch. We had a brief wait for a table, but not more than 10 minutes. The service was great, the food was good, good time was had by all. Now I'll have to try this place again to see if they can keep up the good work or slide back to mediocre. Our table had a appetizer combo, next time I'll just get the avocado rolls. We learned that the only difference between the lunch/dinner items was the price and not the quantity of food. I had the fish tacos, one fish, one shrimp. Next time just the fish...the shrimp wasn't very good. Hubby ordered the sliders, he was happy with them. Mom and Uncle had the unlimited soup/salad combo and liked the tomato and minestrone soups. Aunt had the Italian chopped salad and loved it. Can't remember what Dad ordered, but no one complained about their food, so I guess he liked whatever it was."
Alvin W.,"Fremont, CA",221,328,87,4.0,5/4/2009,"I've been here on three occasions and now I can compare the service and quality of food.  The quality of the food is always fresh and consistent, although due to the slow service, the hot food turns into warm food, or the cold food (aka salad) turns into warm food. Visit #1 - friend and I both ordered a wedge salad and an entrée.  My salad came out but her's was no where in sight.  So far in sight that her giant veggie baked potato and my chicken cobb sandwich arrived to the table.  We had to remind the server about her salad, and waited another few minutes for it.  Slightly irritated, she didn't hold it against them because after we placed our order with our server, he went to break and another server took over.  The veggie baked potato was pretty good and my chicken cobb sandwich hit the spot. Visit #2 - found an online coupon for $5 off so came here again.  Like the first visit, after our server (different from my first visit) took our order, she went on break and another server took over.  Service was pretty good.  She was attentive and friendly.  We did an order of avocado egg rolls, bbq beef sandwich, and I got their soup & salad combo.  The avocado egg rolls are darn tasty with that sweet sauce.  The bbq beef sandwich was sliced into thin slices so the flavor really came out.  The Caesar salad was crisp and fresh, and the Tuscan tomato bisque was a bit oily but flavorful and spicy.  Visit #2 was better than visit #1. Visit #3 - came here with the extended family to do an early mother's day.  We made reservations for 14 at 6pm.  Upon reaching our table, it was only set up for 12.  The server was a bit irritated with the hostess and scolded her to check on the table BEFORE seating guests.  LOL, I'm thinking this server knows what's going on!  So after we get additional seats and get situated, our server takes our drink order, brings the drinks and then tells us she's going on break.  WTF, it's it my luck that each time I come here my server takes break and someone else takes over?  The service was as good as can be considering our party was a group of 14.  I know she had to serve other tables but service was slow this time around.  I have a feeling that some of our food sat at the counter before we got it as multiple people ordered the same thing; i.e. two people ordered soup.  One was warm, the second one was forgotten and when it came, it was piping hot.  Same scenario with hot water for tea, and soft drink refills took about 10 minutes.  In all fairness, I can relate to a large party and also serving other tables, the restaurant was crowded. Over all, I'd give this place 3.5 stars but I'll round up.  Service does need to improve in order for me to give them a legit 4 star rating."
