Jo W.,"Sunnyvale, CA",10,85,2,4.0,7/30/2011,"Went here with a group of 8 people on a Friday night and it took about an hour to get us seated. We didn't have a reservation, so...sounds about right. My friend and I split the beer sampler, which was a good deal for the price (8 5 oz. beers for $8 I think). The food was pretty good (I got the salmon teriyaki with rice) and the ambience was nice for a group hangout (dim, loud but not to the point where you have to yell). The servers were friendly; however it took almost an hour after we were seated for our waitress to take our orders for the entrees. Maybe because the first one who took our drink orders went on a break and someone was covering her?"
Jennifer D.,"Hayward, CA",195,600,19,3.0,4/30/2009,"The pizza here is deep dish, the way I like it, but overpriced for what you get.  I like that there is a beer selection-try the red ale.  The pizookie is also good."
Vivian R.,"Fremont, CA",75,38,3,3.0,8/26/2011,"Everyone loves to rave about BJ's and it always is packed. The food is pretty good, but too pricey. The avocado egg rolls are amaaaaazing. I would recommend the appetizer sampler (which includes the avocado egg rolls) and their signature pizzas (sweet pig is my favorite). Service is not great, they should hire a few more waiters because they rarely come around after serving your food."
Ken H.,"Milpitas, CA",9,15,,3.0,8/7/2011,"came here for lunch the other day. nothing really special. everything is always the same at bjs, not saying that its bad but so far havent really ran into anything here that has amazed me"
S J.,"San Ramon, CA",1,99,15,5.0,1/25/2012,I absolutely LOVE this place!!!!!!   Pizzas are awesome!  Beer is awesome!   I think Ill go there for dinner tonight......
Holla b.,"Fremont, CA",92,1,,3.0,11/19/2008,"I have never been to a BJ's Brewery before so I had nothing to compare to like most of you. My friends drink beer but I do not so I am glad they have other beverages to offer. We went for lunch and the cost of lunch is what I liked the best. That is why they are getting 3 stars. Now..I must tell you that I work in a restaurant  and I too expect good service no matter where I go. I know BJ's just opened so they certainly need to iron out the details. The service was nice but SLOW! Not slow because they were busy but because the severs were not serving with a sense of ERGENCY.!! You can serve,be polite , give great service and still turn a table fairly quickly. That was not the case here. Lots of servers and LOTS of standing around. I guess that is to be expected when you open when you really don't know what to expect volume wise.  I will give it another try later on down the road."
Juliette E.,"Livermore, CA",0,17,2,5.0,1/21/2012,Okay so I went here on a saturday for lunch.....The place looked nice and clean inside. Prices were very reasonable and the menu was huge. The food was good. I especially liked the stuffed mushrooms. Yummy! The drinks were good too. I tried the mixed berry mojito. It was delicious. Our server's name was Catherine. She was excellent. Everyone who worked there was friendly and helpful. Would definitely recommend.
Carol P.,"Fremont, CA",2,17,,3.0,11/16/2008,"It has only been a week or so since it opened, and I'm willing to give it time to work out the service issues. If that improves, and it almost can't help but do so, then it will get more stars.  Friends and I had lunch there on Thursday, and it wasn't bad. In fact, service was pretty good for the most part. We split the avocado eggrolls, which were excellent. My friend had the fettucchine alfredo (I seem to recall) and she said it was quite enjoyable. I ordered fish tacos. We both had wine, and their selection is acceptable, if not outstanding. Then we took family out for dinner tonite. There were 8 of us, including three children. BJ's doesn't accept reservations, but you can call in and they will put your name down. Nonetheless, it can be trying to wait for what they said would be at least an hour. It turns out we only had to wait for 45 minutes total, not too terrible for a brand new restaurant. As it was before, the food is pretty good. It is bar food, sandwiches, pastas, burgers and the like. All three of the young ones had spagetti with marinara sauce from the children's menu and it seemed acceptable. Adults had jambalaya, fish tacos, strip steak with potato, and chopped salad, as well as a Tuscan pasta dish. Jambalaya was pretty good, and so were the fish tacos. The steak was good, etc. Kids had the children's sundaes, and they looked wonderful, even to the adults. We all split the brownie with whipped cream and I think ice cream - yummy, but huge. Even with five adults, it was a bit much. All in all the food is quitte good for what it is. Service, however, really needs a tweak. The servers were all very friendly and apologetic when they brought a chopped salad that was supposed to be with out the meat .. and wasn't. I had to wait quite a while for my first glass of wine - probably 30 minutes all told. In all, it took more than an hour and a half to get through the meal. I think it will get better; it not, they will have a problem. Parking is abysmal,but again, once the parking lot is finished and Mervyn's is gone, that shouldn't be an issue. We will be back, but we're giving it a couple of weeks. It is nice having a big, well designed and attractive restaurant in Newark. I"
Emma F.,"Fremont, CA",1,13,,2.0,1/13/2012,"The friendly bar service cannot make up for the host staff. Leaving a customer feeling blown off (pager apparently never entered into the system) guarantees a frustrated experience. The food is good, and the service can be, if you ever get seated.  This could have been 4 stars instead of two. As it is, BJs will drop from my go to list for a while."
Betty W.,"Fremont, CA",2,54,,2.0,7/26/2009,"Since I'm definitely not a fan of chain restaurants, I can't give an unbiased review, but here it goes.  For a chain BJ's is ok.  The pot roast was very tasty.  The sodium content of almost every item on the menu is astounding.  If you're watching salt or fat or calories, this is not the place to go.  It's big and loud and charmless, IMAO.  The portions are huge, which to me is unappetizing.  I'd rather pay less and get less.   Moreover, I'd rather support the smaller ""mom and pop"" restaurants around where there is more of a personal touch."
Christa M.,"Fremont, CA",114,74,,3.0,9/28/2010,"I've never been truley impressed by this locations service. One time I went and our server was so rude that he dropped off our food, went to another table to talk to these people (I think he knew them personally) and never came back to our table again to see if we needed refills or if the food was alright (which it wasnt). Our pizza was cold, both of us needed refills, we ended up getting so desperate for service we asked the buser to help us!!! That's not their job!! The server knew we were upset because when he dropped off the check he just put it on the table and left. Never said a word like ""thank you for coming in"" or anything. Another time, we had a server who forgot about our table and never came up to us for 15 minutes! When they got to our table they rushed through our order saying ""what do you want to get"". I haven't been to BJ's recently since these past two times but I might give it a try in the future. I just would like to see the area clean up a little bit. Put in some stores already instead of a boarded up Mervyn's and a fenced old circuit city."
Krista B.,"Milpitas, CA",98,37,,4.0,4/3/2011,"I've been here quite a few times since they have opened and have even ordered take out from here, but haven't dined during a busy night until recently. I went on a Friday night around 9pm. They don't take reservations, but they have a call ahead feature where you can call when your 15-20 mins away to put your name on the list. Love that idea!!! Instead of waiting an hr for a table for 2 we only waited 10 mins. The drinks were good- I had A Drink Like That and my friend had a peach sangria. Both were delicious. For appetizers we have the chicken lettuce wraps and for our entrées I had the grilled chicken club with clam chowder and my friend had the jambalaya. Both were good. The food was not  disappointing, it was more or less our server. She was very nice, but she was wayyyyy to busy and had too many tables. You basically have to flag her down for everything. Flag her down to take your order, give you your check, etc. Other than that it was a great dinner."
Lei L.,"Milpitas, CA",1679,175,17,4.0,2/23/2009,"Nutty Blondy + New York Steak Medium...cesar salad was ""ok"" i could've made it better...but the steak was perfect!....add a lemon!"
Danielle G.,"San Lorenzo, CA",31,14,,5.0,8/15/2011,One of my favorite spots for date night! I love all the food! Everyone is so friendly and ready to help and answer all your questions. Sports atmosphere which i love but it also has a romantic feel. I also had my birthday here and everything worked out perfect and i had a fabulous birthday! Can't wait to go back soon. Make sure you try the stuffed baked potato!! Personal Fav.
Erin D.,"Scottsdale, AZ",165,7,,3.0,5/8/2009,"ehhh it's ok. I like the variety of beers on tap and the deep dish pizza is good but that's about it... any of the other menu item's I've tried have just been ok (pasta, salads, giant baked potatoes) Service is alright but haven't had anyone impressive. I'll come here when I get off work since they stay open so late and have that late night happy hour. Yeah I know having a table coming in a half hour before close sucks but hey I'm helping pay your bills right? I work in the industry too so I know how it is. So sitting in the bar area at a table isn't the best place to be because the servers act like they'd rather be anywhere else. Sit at the bar, bartenders are much more friendly and give way better service."
Starla L.,"San Francisco, CA",45,139,204,3.0,2/19/2009,"I give 5-stars for their deep dish pizza. I had heard it was good, but I didn't think it would live up to all the hype. I'm not a big fan of deep dish pizzas like the ones from Zachary's in Berkeley, so I didn't think I'd like this one. But the crust was crispy, dough not too doughy, and plentiful toppings. Service is another story. It's practically non-existent. I've been here twice so far, and both times the server did not bring us utensils/napkins until after the food arrived, and after we had to flag them down just to ask. They don't make themselves available if we need anything (like ordering our food or getting the check). After the food is served they disappear...until it's time for the bill. Then they're super friendly. A little too late. The wait is long on weekends. They don't take reservations, but you can call ahead and tell them you're on your way and they'll put your name down so your wait time is minimized by the time you get there."
Uland L.,"San Jose, CA",34,131,22,3.0,8/6/2009,"Came here with several coworkers and we were seated fairly quickly. Large dining area and the wait staff is very friendly. Ordered their prime-rib sandwich with shoe-string fried onions ($14), unfortunately they forgot to give me the shoe-string onions. Upon asking the waiter, she comes back a few minutes later with a fatty plate full of shoe-string fried onions, enough to share amongst several people. Overall, this sandwich was really good, plus the beer selection they had was great. Total bill was around ~$20 for my meal."
Joseph G.,"San Jose, CA",37,40,,3.0,6/3/2009,"This Bj's is alright at best. My friend and I both ordered Blue Moons but they ran out of oranges and gave us lemons. The service was slow, but our server was nice at least. There is really nothing much to say about this place, it is just so-so. The only reason I had a good time here was because I was with great company, but if I was with anyone else, this place would just suck"
cedro t.,"Lehi, UT",37,84,155,3.0,3/12/2009,"Chocolate lovers... try the triple chocolate cookie icecream thing (the PIZOOKIE).  Sit at the bar to get in quick.  Waiter was nice both times. Food is average, hence 3 stars. I've been back for the PIZOOKIE. Chocolate. Chocolate. Chocolate."
Juliana T.,"Fremont, CA",157,483,46,3.0,1/2/2009,"A good brewery and bar food restaurant right off the freeway.  Nothing spectacular about them but if you want a yummy bite to eat, this one's the newest in Fremont.  The ambiance is warm and fun but if you're looking for unusual or unique food, it's not here.  This is your basic, pizza, burgers, nachos sort of joint."
