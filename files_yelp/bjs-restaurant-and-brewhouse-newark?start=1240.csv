Adrian L.,"Union City, CA",21,24,5,3.0,9/12/2010,"been to Bj's a about 3 times and i have to say their menu is getting better, i would only go here for appetizers and deserts though."
brett m.,"Pleasanton, CA",73,30,1,3.0,3/19/2011,Good but expensive
Kirsten M.,"Newark, CA",83,101,,2.0,2/9/2009,The menu is good.  They have alot of options.  What I have had has been good. They have alot of good beers to offer as well.  I just wish the service didn't suck so much.  I'm going to try it again after it's been open longer to see if that improves.
RJ A.,"Hayward, CA",296,45,9,3.0,1/8/2011,"This place is alright. Very sports bar orientated. They have a lot of televisions so practically every sport is playing.The restaurant is pretty big very spacious. SO yeah this place is a brewery so they have a lot of different types of beer. The one I had recently that was pretty good I believe it was called Jeremiah Red. Got pretty buzzed after two pints of it but I also didn't eat yet. The food is pretty good and they are more known for their specialty pizzas. The one I enjoyed is called the Great white which has a mushrooms, chicken, tomatoes and garlic and instead of tomato sauce they use an Alfredo sauce that is really good and a worth a try if it's your first time there. Finally on the menu for dessert it's a definite must try is their pizooki which is icecream served over a warm cookie.It tastes ever so good. The only problem with this place is the service.It isn't that it's their fault. It's can just be really busy and most of the time it is. So the waiters and waitress are running around everywhere. So if your a person with patience then you should be fine if now try ordering to go ."
Alexa O.,"Hayward, CA",16,43,,4.0,1/5/2009,"Came here for the first time a couple weeks ago!.. waiters and staff were really friendly!, but considering we only came her for drinks, I can only rate accordingly. Very disappointing, tasted a lot like water!.. yeah too much ice, I don't know, maybe it's just me, but if I'm paying for over priced drinks, I like to taste the alcohol..I'll be back, to taste the food."
Tito R.,"Mountain View, CA",0,9,,3.0,5/12/2009,"I usually avoid chain type restaurants in the Fremont area due to the epidemic of poor servers these places tend to be plagued with & elbow to elbow crowd of locals that all seem to look & act the same. WTF is it with Fremont? Anyhow, I have to admit I went into this BJ's quite skeptical & expecting the usual crappy Fremont experience. Well I was pleasantly surprised to the contrary here. Not too bad. I've been twice & both times I left pleased with the experience & a very full belly (oh yeah, good buzz too, hehehe...). The place is big, clean & bustling with business - which translates to everyone in the area is trying eat here right how. Let me say the wait was very long, I'm sure it was because we went on a busy nite (Friday) and I guess it isn't necessarily there fault if everyone & there mama wants to eat here right now. But what i didn't like is they didn't let us make reservations over the phone so we had to show up & wait (party of 4). It was so packed there weren't even enough of those pager things, we had to check back 20 mins later to get one. It was about an hour wait, but this was offset by hanging out at the bar which wasn't that bad, though there was no space so you are kind of stuck standing in the middle of the floor holding your brew & dodging the waiters going in & out of the kitchen. The bartender was your typical Fremont'y 20-something bartender, but luckily I didn't get the bad attitude I'm accustomed to at these type of places. For being so busy he took care of us in a timely manner, offered refills & I tipped accordingly. The beer was good, BJ's house brews are a beer drinkers delight, I stick with the Blonde. After we finally got seated our server came pretty quick to ask if we wanted anything to drink & I am happy to say she had a great personality. BJ's scored points here with me, she genuinely seemed committed to making sure we were enjoying our evening there. I wish I remembered her name to give her a shout out! BJ's must actually interview there applicants & gauge there customer service ability - THANK YOU . Our group ordered a deep dish pizza (warning: the pizza will knock you the eff out. Its good & BIG!). Nachos, wow these are good too. They did not suck at all, we actually ran out of chips for dipping in the left over salsa & our waitress was KIND enough to bring us an extra serving of plain nacho chips to clean the plate with! I had a chicken sandwich & man it was GOOD. Big portions, we had to take a lot of stuff home! No complaints with the food or servers here ! For being in Fremont & a chain brewery/food type place this place is not bad at all. Go with some friends / family & I think you will have a good time with some good food & drink. I hope they can maintain this level, its not the best I've been too but it's good enough that I will definitely go back. Fremont is notorious for bad making places like this go bad fast. Lets hope that doesn't hold true here."
Ali H.,"Sacramento, CA",19,177,3,1.0,12/5/2009,"I wish I could give this place a 2nd chance, but I just cannot do it!  The place is beautiful inside, nice ambiance with the big screens and nice art.  The service, just plain sucked.  I always order half's with my Sis so we may try more food, Yum...  We decided on the Bacon Cheeseburger & Chicken Club, why not, the holidays are here.  We got the burger, no bacon, fair enough, told the server and he actually went and got the menu to see if we were telling the truth....  Came back and asked if we would like bacon on the side and explained to us that he would usually have to charge us for it.  Seriously he came back with 3 of the thinnest pieces and for a moment, I thought it was a joke.  I told him he should buy my beer and he said they can't do that...  Really?  So he actually did, the tip showed it!  The management did not seem to really care either, the food court in the mall might have been a better choice.  I agree, the food is garbage!  Save a bunch of scrill and go to Mission Pizza, down home and delicious!!!!!"
Bob T.,"Fremont, CA",0,5,3,5.0,7/9/2009,"God I really love this restaurant; not just because they have great food, they help me to retrieve my lost digital camera. It has been 4 days, and I thought I was going to buy a new camera; however, when I asked the server about my lost camera, they kept it for me!!! This is a great restaurant, and you will not regret of coming here."
Oliver H.,"Fremont, CA",8,29,,2.0,12/26/2008,good beer !!    bad food !! poor service !! ...did i mention...good beer !!      (great variety of beers but don't expect too much help  from the staff)
Bella B.,Bay Area,0,77,,4.0,3/31/2009,"Went on a Saturday nite -- got there around 9:30pm. Our party was seated within 10 minutes. Our server was friendly, helpful, and energetic -- and didn't rush us for our order, and after our food arrived, she checked in just enough to let us know she was available, which allowed us to enjoy our casual dining experience. For beer, had the Brewhouse Blonde -- very good. For starters, had the Angus Beef Sliders -- very good; and the combo appetizer platter (sorry, I've forgotten the name), which had my favorite appetizers."
Shadi A.,"Hayward, CA",10,4,,5.0,3/19/2011,"I love this place, service is great, people are friendly and the product is good. Been here a few times and each time left happy"
Kathleen T.,"Fremont, CA",4,9,7,3.0,5/17/2009,"Went here with the little guy, aka my brother, my parents, and my mom's friends. It's really nice looking inside...but now to the most important part: The food. The food took forever, and we ended up finishing our drinks, and the soup. We had Tomato Bisque and Clam chowder. The tomato was way too sour, and the chowder was creamy, however some at the table found it quite salty. And we wait.  For an hour. And my cream soda was long gone, but I reccomend you try one of those Bj's Sodas. Anyways, when it arrived after an hour, the guy forgot our fucking utensils. WOWWWWWWWW. I dug into my now lukewarm jambalaya, and it's huge, and surprisingly delicious.  All in all, the food is pretty good, if you know what to order, but the service isn't exactly the best...."
Megan T.,"Redwood City, CA",56,55,1,4.0,2/24/2009,"We had a large party of about 25 people and four them being kids.  Our service was outstanding.  Our waiter was very attentive, brought refills on drinks without asking.....got the kids orders first so they wouldn't be hungry.  The food was average but I was very impressed with the service.  The other bummer is that BJ's in Newark is located in a ghost town right next to a bunch of stores that have gone out of business and are all boarded up....."
Jello P.,"Fremont, CA",0,28,1,4.0,2/20/2011,"The only reason I'm giving this place 4 stars is solely because of the clam chowder bread bowl and the pizookies. Everything else is just overpriced and bland (pizza, pasta, sandwiches...). So I used to think the only place I could get some good tasting clam chowder is at pier 39 in SF, but now I don't have to go that far to satisfy my clam chowder cravings anymore. If you're going to get clam chowder at BJ's, get it with the bread bowl, it makes all the diference in the world! The bread bowl is toasted to perfection and they flavored the lid of the bowl with butter, some herbs, and cheese and OMG that hits the spot! The clam chowder tastes great; has enough clams and potatos, and goes very well with the bread bowl. Lastly, the pizookie, what a great invention. My favorite is the cookies and cream and my second favorite is the white chocolate macademia. The cookie is chewy, but not soft. It's warm when it comes out to you topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, you get this awesome mix of warm and cool in your mouth."
Ashley M.,"Fremont, CA",0,45,,2.0,4/5/2011,Terrible quality restaurant for its price. I've been here twice and both times their food has made me sick.  It's overpriced for the quality of food and service they offer.  And the wait? Just forget about it. I'd rather make a trip to the mall across the street and eat at Anderson's Bakery or even Red Robin.
Giovanni F.,"Fremont, CA",6,10,1,3.0,1/23/2011,It's a total fail if you use their call ahead system and they don't put your name on the list! The only reason I left them with 3 stars is for the food and beer. A definite FAIL on calling ahead for a table. You have to wait the same amount of time regardless!
Allen B.,"Fremont, CA",0,3,,5.0,4/9/2011,"Ine of te nicer places here in Fremont, especially great for first dates! I lived te happy hour and the choice of pizzas is huge. Also, very nice service; the managers actually walk around greeting diners."
Gab a.,"Union City, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/31/2011,This was my 1st time going to a BJs and.. Its was a nice place except the service and food was ridiculously terrible. Idk if it was honestly the reserants fault but it might be the server mayra? Or Alex?? She completely  forgot the birthday girls salad and food another person salad.. There was only 4 of us ... Terrible and when we finally got settled and got our cold forgotten food got to us it was :( bad. And I didn't like it the pizza was soggy . But maybe I'll try it again as long as it don't take 3 hrs to get seller and eat maybe next time !!
Anna P.,"Fremont, CA",0,2,,1.0,11/27/2009,"BJ' at Newark ..reservation desk is a mess. Recent friday, we called BJ' three times and they assured us that wait -time is only 30 mins and added our name to the list......when we got to BJs they told us we have to wait another hour to get our seating.....so o we left and our 7 yr old said that she never ever wants to go to BJs."
