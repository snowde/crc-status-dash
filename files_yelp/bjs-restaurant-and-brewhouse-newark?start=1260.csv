greg n.,"Fremont, CA",6,3,,2.0,6/16/2009,"Came in here this past weekend for lunch. We were trying to decide on where to eat and this place has consistently been reliable. Not today. Wasn't too busy for a Sunday and was seated within 15 minutes. Our waitress was friendly and helpful as usual. We ordered the Thai shrimp lettuce wraps for an appetizer, the spaghetti with meat sauce and the pot roast dinner with a cup of clam chowder. After waiting about close to 30 minutes our appetizer came out, followed immediately by our main dishes. The appetizer was brought out by our waitress and our main dishes followed not even 1 minute later, served to us by someone different. Our waitress noticed what had happened and apologized and offered to take the main dishes back while we worked on our lettuce wraps, but I declined because I did not want the food getting cold. So we just ate everything at once. I also informed her that my soup never came out, which she apologized for and offered to take it off the bill. What pissed me off was when I looked at my pot roast. I have had this numerous times in the past and have always been satisfied with its generous portion size, not today. My plate had maybe 7 small pieces of meat with the gravy being nearly nonexistent. No broccoli with my veggies, just all carrots with a huge onion cut in half. At first I thought, ""Is this a lunch portion?"" So I finished my food but was annoyed the whole time I was eating because I was looking forward to a hearty meal only to find a kid size serving. They tried dressing my plate up all fancy but this isn't Manresa or some other classy restaurant, it's freaking BJ's! When our waitress returned she asked how the food was and I asked her if the pot roast was a lunch portion because it was so small. She said there is no lunch portion for the pot roast and babbled on with some reason which I tuned out cause I was pissed I was paying 14 bucks for a dish that wasn't even worth half of that. So all in all, if this is the turn they are taking where they down size the food while keeping the prices the same, I won't be coming back, to this location at least. Boo!"
Ambar G.,"San Ramon, CA",4970,244,313,4.0,11/15/2008,"listen, it has only been open for about a week, its  the first major chain restaurant newark has landed in a long time. this is why it is overcrowded, not to mention the screwed up parking that is not even finished yet, there is alot of demolition yet to be done. of course the grand opening is going to be loud and slow-  no one wants to disappointed. give it some time. there is a reason why this place is loved in southern california. when mervyns shuts its doors, there will be plenty of parking! newark is working on a couple other chains that will compliment this chain...just give them a break for now. for people complaining about price- sit home and have a tv dinner, we live in the bay area for gods sake. you cant diss the menu variety- if the beer sucks drink hard liquor."
Mike M.,"Santa Clara, CA",25,271,20,4.0,12/7/2009,"Been wanting to check out this place since they opened a year ago at this location.  First off, the place is huge.  The dining area is expansive, same goes for the bar, and they've even got a special dining area sectioned off for private parties.  The atmosphere is similar to Cheesecake Factory.  I've heard that waiting lines can get long during peak times, but when we came here on a Sat for lunch, we were sat down immediately.  The food is above average.  We ordered a half-and-half deep dish pizza, the classic and the mediteranean.  It does the job if you're craving deep dish but Zachary's Pizza in Berkeley/Danville is still my fav spot for deep dish.  We had the white chocolate macadamia pizookie for dessert which was a nice treat, a little over the top but a nice treat once in awhile.  Anyhow, prices were reasonable, service was good, parking outside is easy, and an upbeat atmosphere.  Another plus for all the flat screens which is great for catching games. We'll be back here again."
Brenda T.,"Fremont, CA",1,29,1,1.0,5/22/2009,I joined 4 friends her at 5:30pm during happy hour and it took 30 MINUTES to get a cocktail and 15 minutes to get a beer! Upon asking the server I was told a bartender had gone on a break! HELLO IT IS HAPPY HOUR. We ordered some appetizers and after trying to serve us some elses appetizers when they arrived they were not anything to write home about. The nacho had practically no cheese - hmmmm nachos and cheese I thought they went together. I don't recommend this place unless you have all the time in the world. We spent $200 for drinks and food and it was not worth it.
ek b.,"San Jose, CA",0,46,1,4.0,8/2/2010,This place is fantastic. We went there for a small office event and we had a great time. The drinks were superb and the appetizers were awesome. The avacado rolls are highly recommended.  The food though in general was mediocre. But overall good place. Try the beer sampler.
Vas B.,"Fremont, CA",0,9,,1.0,1/23/2009,I ordered a Veggie Garden Burger - I have not eaten meat all through my life - the guy at the Take out brought me Turkey burger - I sent it back and he made me wait for 45 more minutes to return with what was supposed to be Veggie burger - Of course I did not suspect it - since it was made clear that I needed a veggie - I went home - bit into my burger (it is against my religion to eat any meat) - of course I find that it is Turkey - the whole place is sad. I called back to complain only to get a lukewarm response that they will refund my money - of course you are gonna refund me my money - it is not like you did me a favor - I took the burger back so they can do whatever they want with it....I am not at all recommending this place.
Alan O.,"Fremont, CA",23,26,,2.0,4/7/2010,"The visit could have been much better. Reason- great lack of energy on the serving staff's part. There had to be at least 6-7 on the wait staff including a manager( from what was seen). We had a birthday that evening and only one person sang from the staff. To me that shows a lack of effort on making a customer feel invited. The food was decent and came to our table at a reasonable pace. Our server was helpful and she served us well, however, the lack of energy from the rest of the staff needs improvement. She even asked the manager to sing along and no comply.  This is a place where you can just count on having it as Take-out orders rather than spending your time in there.  Another Yelper commented on this being like the Fremont's Elephant Bar- in some ways it is- but the staff at the Elephant Bar treats the customers a little bit better- Remember a good business validates their customers. BJ's might need to work on that before i want to make another visit."
christine c.,"Pacifica, CA",0,4,,1.0,6/2/2012,"This was one of my first trips to this BJ's in newark (I have been to the San Bruno and Foster City locations and they were far better).  We had a large party of 12 on a Saturday night, but we had made reservations prior....so the restaurant knew we had a large party....yet for some reason it seemed like they were not prepared.  We arrived at 4:30pm and were told that we had to finish our meals by 6:30pm.  Which we all thought would not be a problem.  However, it took our waitress 45 MINUTES to BRING WATER to our table and to top it off waters, sodas, and drinks were not refilled unless WE ASKED her for them.  3 pizzas were ordered and came out COLD, a steak was ordered medium but came out burned and well done, the manager offered to replace one of our pizzas since it had been cold when it reached the table.  It was a combo pizza, however, the pizza that came out to replace it was not a combo.  In return the manager had given us the steak free and offered a pizookie plattechrr.  The lackluster waitress didn't bring a menu or explain what the pizookie was, so many of the people at the table who had never been to BJ's before had no clue what this waitress was offering us.  We walked out of there at almost 7pm, and the entire 2.5 hours our waitress was talking to her family, hugged a child, and was chitchatting with another waitress.  We observed a waitress who kept touching her hair, putting pens in her mouth, and never washing her hands when she came around to pick up plates or serve.  Sadly, the manager tried to save our waitresses sinking ship (who stated over and over again it's not my fault the kitchen doesn't know how to follow instructions, and I am just the messenger), however, her lack of customer service skills, telling us her life story (I work 2 jobs and have a daughter)...we really don't care....bring us our water and food we ordered and be friendly.  I can say that all the food runners and busboys were working over time, probably to accommodate for the crappy wait staff.  Wish our forced 18% tip could have solely gone to the bus/servers.  I have NEVER had such a bad experience at a BJ's restaurant ever, and will NOT return to the Newark location nor will I recommend this location to anyone."
Je M.,"San Jose, CA",614,185,5,2.0,11/22/2008,"no stars for telling us we had to wait three hours, when in actuality, we waited 30 min. no stars for the rude hostess who when i asked to be updated on our wait time responded bothered and annoyed and i quote, ""your wait time is 120 minutes you've only been waiting 23 minutes (rolls eyes).""  BEEYATCH plz. But one star for the pizookie that made me feel fat. and one star for our awesome hostess, who may have only been nice since she knew my brother? haha, but no she was sweet."
erma c.,"El Cerrito, CA",2,16,2,1.0,2/21/2010,it was not what i expected. anyhow.. to keep the long story short. over priced for the type of food we had. the drinks were not what we expected either .. plus the service front the front desk threw it in the trash as well.
Kelli S.,"Hayward, CA",4,14,2,2.0,2/4/2010,"had the pulled pork sliders, calamari, pot stickers and pot roast. none of which were especially good. the pot roast was very dense and had a texture like pressed meat, not the tender fall apart type i am used to. also the meat had no flavor. the attmosphere is good-young crowd. ok beer, but the food reminded me of microwave dinners which no amount of atmosphere can make up for : /"
Devyn P.,"Union City, CA",25,37,1,2.0,1/13/2009,"Love the food, hate the service. This chain is phenomenol but this store in particular is the black sheep for them. I have been here at least 10 times a already and the service has been beyond crappy each and everytime. I think I would rather drive to San Mateo for the better experience and stick with takeout at the Mowry location."
Ryan B.,"Fremont, CA",0,21,3,3.0,11/12/2008,"We went tonight.. Food was ok, nothing that great.  spaghetti came out with hardly any sauce, so i asked for more and it tasted ok.  Sammy was a good server tho, she got our refills quickly.  Atmosphere is very nice, the big TV is cool.  Its just not a place I would go to alot."
DJ A.,"Fremont, CA",1,10,,5.0,2/25/2010,Wonderful pizza... Great Service... and they make their own Cream Soda... Freakin Awesome.
andrew a.,"Hayward, CA",4,22,9,5.0,6/3/2009,The best place for thick crust pizza. My mouth waters for their combination pizza. Don't be fooled by the size. This pizza is so thick that you are actually eating two pizza stacked on top of each other. Their food is pricey but the environment is what you are paying for.  Great selection of alcoholic beverages and the televisions are mounted all around the restaurant. A great place to watch the game and have a drink. Excellent pizza and social lounge!
Katy B.,"New York, NY",20,74,38,4.0,3/4/2009,"I'm giving this place 4 stars, even though I was disappointed with some things...I didn't realize I needed to call 24 hrs in advance to make reservations...So I called the minute they opened that morning-literally and they told me I couldn't make them...So we went anyway-party of 10-I know it's big...Then we got there an had to wait an hour and a half...Which sucked, but I really wanted to try it...The guy giving out wait times kept changing the times for different people, wtf. The bar was completely packed and service there was average, if not lower than. Good beers though. I ordered the balsamic chicken which was okay, but tasted burnt, but wasn't. The cheddar mashed potatoes rocked my freaking world. haha. Then the pazookie (I think that's what it's called) is the dessert cookie...OMg that thing was AMAZING. You have to get it if you go here! Our meal was moderately priced...I would go again and try different things."
Kei T.,"San Francisco, CA",0,30,,3.0,6/22/2009,"In all honesty, this place does not live up to the hype that it receives. Sure, you can joke around with the name a couple of times, ""Hi, welcome to BJ's. How would you like it today?"", but after a while it just gets tiring. I went here the other day because my friend raved to me about how AMAZING the pasta's here were. But, WOW, really? Amazing must be a pretty ordinary word in his dictionary because the pastas that we had ordered were so much stuck in the ""eh"" section that it did not even catch sight of the amazing mark. We ordered two things here, the Angel Hair Toscana and the Chardonnay Shrimp Pasta (the ladder is MUCH better). The only thing that actually made the meal really enjoyable was how nice the waitress, a skinny and tall caucasian woman, was and how many televisions there were posted around the room. Aside from that, the pastas itself is nothing to go nuts for and definitely not worth getting your hopes up. Sorry to smash the image, but its true."
jen t.,"Newark, CA",126,79,3,4.0,2/7/2009,"Wow, so we pull up to this place and the last I remember of the area it had a rasputins (now closed) and the new mervins that opened and then closed right away.  But the building is beautiful. We had dinner here for my cousins bday and the place was super super busy (it was a saturday night) We had to wait for almost an hour for seats but we were fine with that. We sat and chatted for a while and looked over the menu. The food looks really good and I had the cajun pasta with a Super delicious Nutty Brunette beer (SO GOOD) My meal and beer was fine but my mom ordered a fish taco and got a shrimp (she is mildly allergic to shrimp) and my sisters margarita tasted like it didnt have alot of booze so she went and bought a shot of cuervo to go in it for an additional $7.50. (thats part of why I like beer) Over all the experience was good, we had fun but on the weekend this place was CRAZY! The waiter was professional and willing to help. The food was good but on the pricey side. I will prob visit again sometime."
Bamboo H.,"Hayward, CA",152,65,1,2.0,12/28/2008,"I do not really recommend the BJ in Newark but I do recommed the one in Vacaville.  Vacaville was the first Ive tried and they had excellent customer service and all the food that we ordered was good.  My bf and I tried the one in Newark 11/08 and the Pizza to the onion bloom was salty as hell!!!!!   The waitress was an odd duck first of all and had a weird sense of humor.  Anyways, I ordered the Oreo Pazookie and the waitress tells me later that they ran out of Vanilla ice cream? wtf? Second time I went there was on my fathers bday 12/21/08 and again they ran out of the oreo pazookie? I mean if you know that there  is a  hot item and are known for it.....wouldnt you make sure that your restaurant would have it????"
preethi m.,"San Francisco, CA",0,14,,5.0,5/4/2009,"Some friends and I went here for drinks and dinner on saturday. I have been to other BJ's before and this was my 2nd visit to this particular location. I love the ambience and the décor of this place; It has a very casual yet elegant feel to it. The only thing I hate is the long wait, many times we've decided to go to another place since the wait here was over 1.5 hours. I guess everyone in Fremont knows how good this place is.... We've tried some beers here and all of them were good. This time I got the berry cider beer which is more of a cider than a beer and it was good.  At our table we got the:  Avocado rolls which was amazing Grilled chicken salad - which is topped with awesome onion rings Tomato soup - which had the freshest ingredients, it was a little too creamy for me but it tasted really good... Grilled chicken sandwich - came with the crispiest fries Mediterranean pizza- which was very good I think our waitress was either new or was helping too many tables at one time. She kept forgetting our drinks, silverware etc.  My friend asked for the Grilled Chicken sandwich with soup and not fries but when he got it, it had fries. When he asked them about it, they happily got him a bowl of soup and let him have the fries too.  I ordered the Mediterranean pizza and since I was going to share it, I asked for the chicken on one half and no meat on the other (I am a vegetarian), but when it came to us, it had chicken all over. My husband had already put a slice with the chicken on his plate and started eating it. When I asked the waitress about it, she called in the guy from the kitchen and he took it back to have it fixed.  I suspected they would just pick the chicken and bring out the rest , but no... they were baking another pizza.  The manager came to us and apologized for the mix up, it was no big deal as we were having a good time with friends and there was other food on our table. She offered to get me some soup till I waited, which I thought was very nice of her. Then came my pizza the way I wanted it...it tasted awesome. The manager went one step ahead and took the pizza off our bill as it took a long time to get it done right. I thought this was super nice; they really didn't have to do that. The folks here make customer satisfaction their priority, even on our previous visit they made sure that our food and service was perfect.  The food and the people make us want to keep going back to this place. Its great to come here with friends as you can e sure of having a great time....Kudos to the guys at BJ's- Fremont!!!"
