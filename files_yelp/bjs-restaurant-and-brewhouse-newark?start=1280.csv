Julie Z.,"Surprise, AZ",0,4,,2.0,3/23/2009,"I have eaten at BJ's in Maui, Newport Beach, Boulder and Burbank and had fabulous experiences.  What a disappointment the BJ's in Newark was.   We were seated in a dirty booth that we had to wipe down to remove the food products left on the booth seat.  Never recvd our appetizer.  And never offered a refill on our sodas.  Perhaps our waitress missed career day??"
Joe W.,"Henderson, NV",0,12,,4.0,2/11/2009,"I come here for the BEER!  Get the Red, it's the best  The food is what you'd expect at a joint like this.  The location is like a pool of water in the middle of the desert, because all the other tenants are out of business at this shopping plaza.  Be prepared to wait on the weekends though.  The service I got was pretty good, but the waiter seemed overloaded with work & my order took pretty long.   I didn't mind, cause the beer mellowed me out quite a bit!"
Lorice A.,"Fremont, CA",0,4,,1.0,8/2/2010,"I don't believe I can even rate this place.We couldn't even get a table for 6 after waiting a total time of 1 1/2 hours. Thursday, July 29th my daughter and 4 teens (grandkids) and I arrived at 6:40pm. We asked for a table for 6 and the hostess told us it would be 30 - 45 minutes. We decided to wait. After the 30 - 45 mintues had passed, we would see parties of 5 or less be seated. most of these were groups that came in way after we arrived. We asked the hostess what was going on. She told us that they were waiting for a table of 6 that had already been there for 2 hours to leave so we can have their table. I asked is that the only place you can sit us? She could not answer. I watched her go to her manager and he did not offer her any suggestions or did he try and come over to explain, apologize, nothing. They just let us continue to sit. Finally 1 1/2 hours had gone by and another party of 5 was seated after only being there for 10 minutes waiting. I asked the hostess what was being done to get us seated, she replied they were still waiting for those people to leave. I asked if she was telling me that they couldn't accomendate parties of 6 or more? Once again no answer. I suggested putting table together or bringing a chair up to the booth. The manager came over and said the table where the other party of 6 was seating was their only option. They could not push tables together or add chairs to booths. I told him we had now gone over 1 1/2 hours of waiting and the other party had now been there for 3 hours. His response was only, ""well thank you for waiting all this time"". He could care less. He is a perfect example of a terrible manager who has no clue how to manage a resturant. I have been to 2 other BJ's in other towns and never experienced such stupidity and lack of experience. This place had people sitting on floors waiting. BJ's truley needs to find a more competent manager. This guy was awful. We will never try this location again. If you are going there to party and drink, it may be the place for you, but if you are a family, be ready to be put at the end of the line and forgotten about."
Marcus W.,"Union City, CA",0,21,,2.0,3/14/2009,"I sat down and saw the tab for the people who had the table before us.  They had left a 10% tip.  Sure, the food is good and it came out quickly, but is it anything you can't get from Amicis, Giorgio's, Claim Jumper, or Elephant Bar?  On a busy night, you gotta ask yourself if it's really worth the wait for pizza, beer, and other items on the menu for the waiting time (40 mins) and the frustrating service?  You won't get any service unless it's your assigned waiter/waitress.  I waved to one who was just standing 5 feet away not doing anything and was totally ignored.  I had to put my arm in the way of another to stop them.  We had to ask for utensils after the food started to arrive.  I didn't have much confidence in the waitress afterward and had to prompt them for the things you automatically get from other places.  Things like soda refills, ketchup, pepper/cheese for the pizza, and even the check had to be asked for.  It's the only business left standing in the whole block, so if you see that the parking lot is pretty full, a better experience awaits elsewhere.  It'll be better when the bloom wears off this place and they can weed out all the bad waiters/waitresses.  In the end I also left a 10% tip."
