Randee S.,"Morgan Hill, CA",8,110,,5.0,10/26/2016,Really nice location. Came in here for lunch with a group of 14 of my coworkers. We ordered a lot of food and a lot of drinks. Great customer service and the food and drinks were very tasty. I think this is a newer location because the interior is very new and pretty looking. All of us enjoyed our lunch! We did make a reservation for our larger group and the table was set up and ready for us when we arrived. Our waitress was Randi and she was very accommodating and friendly. They were very attentive to our large group and everyone enjoyed their time here.
Justin T.,"Hayward, CA",157,32,1,1.0,6/8/2017,"Came here for dinner 2 weeks ago. It was our first visit in about a year. We were very unsatisfied with the level of service and the quality of the food. First thing, we made a reservation for a table of 13 for 6:30 the day before. When we arrived, we were told they don't have the reservation on the list. It wasn't a big deal since the wait was only approximately 10 minutes. Second, the waitress did not know the menu very well, she had to match the item on the menu with the price on the tablet to get the order in.  Third, the food was very salty, it tasted like they pour the whole bottle of salt on there. Lastly, the promotional items were not discounted on the bill, we had to ask the manager to get the bill corrected. This took like 30 minutes since our waitress was nowhere to be found. We probably won't be coming back."
Anuj C.,"Newark, CA",219,201,96,4.0,4/21/2016,"This is a place where you are not really going for the food. i mean the food is not bad, but you kinda going here for the drinks with friends and junk food and the sports bar tvs. its a great place to watch the warriors games they even put the sound on so you can hear the commentary. The food is just alright, definitely not healthy for you. The pizzas are good and the salads are alright. their fried food snacks are pretty awesome. just fyi you will really not feel that great about yourself after you eat here, but the food is tasty and decent.  Definitely would come here to watch sporting events, its a great place for it.  FYI avocado rolls are awesome."
Ritchie S.,"Fremont, CA",0,1,,1.0,10/13/2017,"This place has the worst service. Ordered some food to go and they did not get the order right. Did not have the food ready and missed half of the food that was ordered. The worst, ridiculous place to order food. Incompetent workers and incompetent manager. Absolutely ridiculous! Avoid this place."
Mursal N.,"San Ramon, CA",1,27,5,4.0,6/30/2017,This bjs is pretty good and fast with brining food. I would have gave them a 5 star but tonight they brought my crusted chicken a little cold.
Satchel W.,"Newark, CA",3,5,2,1.0,8/2/2017,Came in here for a late lunch today expected to have a nice meal considering it was completely dead in there. Order our food and some wings as a appetizer. First off it wasn't busy so I don't under stand why we waited 45 mins for 3 bacon cheeseburgers and not only that but the wings (appetizer) came out at the same time as the food . We asked for grilled onions on 2 of the burgers which they forgot to put on for what ever reason let our waitress know and she said she would talk to the cook about it. Waited 10 more minutes and finally got those grilled onions although it wasn't the same since we had to spread them on ourselves finally took a bite of my burger and then I noticed there was no mayo on my bread. I then got my waitresses attention and let her know there was no mayo and if they can just remake the burger. She took it back and remade it and apologized but when the burger came out this time there was no BACON on my BACON cheeseburger cmon guys get it together. I let her know there was no bacon on it now and she said she would bring some bacon out I let her know I was fine and I will just pass on the meal the manager came over and let me know he didn't charge for the burger. I will definitely not be back to this location for a bacon cheeseburger again.
Danielle B.,"Fremont, CA",20,11,6,1.0,5/20/2017,Worst service ever !!!! I just left after waiting over 15 mins without being greeted by a server and the resturaunt wasn't even busy. I'm amazed that 5 servers walked by and didn't even ask if I had been helped. Wasn't even offered drinks. When I got up to leave and told take out I wanted the general manager's card because of my bad service experience they failed to offer an apology. I am beyond words....
Roseanna A.,"Newark, CA",92,4,,5.0,7/12/2017,This place is amazing always good for a date night! The pazookies is what I really go for! But never really had a long wait time here. And the service is really good! No complaints here
Ashley Y.,"Milpitas, CA",2,11,3,1.0,10/2/2017,Thought I'd pop in for a quick bite while my car was in the shop at the neighboring gas station. When I first walked in the hostess' back was to the door. She had no idea I had even walked in. Waited a few seconds for her to turn around and notice people had walked in (a group of 4 had come in after me). She finally turned around and saw that people had come in. I told her I just needed a table for 1. She asked me to step to the side and she would seat me in a second. The bar area was pretty crowded (Monday Night Football) but the rest of the restaurant had plenty of open seating. Stood around for about 10 minutes while the hostesses socialized before I left.
Corinne Y.,"Fremont, CA",18,9,7,2.0,5/21/2017,"Sat at the bar, had bad service and it wasn't even busy.  The Bloody Mary was sub-par.  The bartender didn't even look us in the eye once!"
Allan P.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,8,,1.0,7/2/2017,"I've had it with the Newark Bj's.  This is the fourth time I've eaten here and it's gotten worse every time.  Servers don't have a clue, the restaurant is insufficiently staffed, food is poorly prepared, and delivered COLD.  Cold fries don't cut it.  Neither does a bacon burger with RAW bacon. It would be one thing if this was a one-off experience, but this is consistent poor performance.  Save your money and go elsewhere.  There's better food and service to be had elsewhere in Fremont/Newark"
H-D E.,"Hayward, CA",4,40,111,2.0,11/6/2016,"Would recommend the ahi salad -  pear cider very nice - the pita tacos were barely ok -  the concept and mixture of ingredients nice but the pita was doughy -  made for an unpleasant bite-  should probably have the pita warm on the side ?  Well would have liked to try the fries but they came out cold -  sent them back and they never got back to us-the atmosphere was for sports -  so if you like to watch -  big screen was nice to see the opening of the raiders and broncos game -  and would probably be nice for any sports showing !  Be patient as some of the staff is still leading the art ! H - Big game in the Bay seemed to overwhelm staff, particularly the kitchen, fries don't take that long, I've been a line cook, fries are easy!  The wait staff had a hard time dealing with the volume, maybe try with less people."
Dana M.,"Fremont, CA",0,2,,2.0,10/2/2017,"I love the food but this location was horrible on its to go/delivery order! I ordered 4 bacon cheeseburgers and all 4 were missing the bacon. Cheese was so cooked it looked like it was deep fried. The bacon was not an add on its a menu item ""bacon cheeseburger "". Very disappointed! I gave it two stars only because my fries were at least packaged in a bag that kept them crispy."
Tish W.,"Moreno Valley, CA",17,133,183,3.0,10/19/2016,"To me this was typical BJ's.  We had reservations for a party of 11.  When we got there our table was ready.  Our servers were professional, courteous, and fast.  We all had appetizers and desserts due to a large lunch at the Habit. (except my daughter who had the Jambalaya) My husband and daughter thought the Jambalaya was pretty tasty.  Our mini cookie desserts were good  All in all what you could expect from BJ's."
Susana T.,"Oakland, CA",48,21,21,4.0,5/8/2017,Food was good but I felt like it was a tad overpriced being that it's a chain. I do appreciate the wide variety of beer. The service was not terrible but nothing special worth mentioning. The kids menu was admirable for the price. I'll be back another time to see if the time of day will affect the ambience/experience.
sheryl a.,"San Jose, CA",25,33,114,2.0,5/7/2017,"We hardly like coming here cause past 2 times we have had bad experience. Since I had a GO TO coupon We decided to give it another try. We waited for about 15 min for a table for 5. We were seated but was not given the special menu or told about the specials. Went ahead and Ordered artichoke and spinach dip for an appetizer waited a while for that. Our soup and salad came out but we didn't have utensils. Had to ask for those. Main course we ordered 2 prime rib specials, comes with either a soup or salad and then 2 sides and pizookie. I asked for prime rib medium and my husband asked for his medium rare, both of ours came out well done and tough. They took his back and made him a new one. Waited at least 10 min for the new prime rib, it was better. Asked for ranch and it took 3 reminders. Also ordered a sirloin and a small pizza. Now still waiting for our server to come back to order our pizookie. We've been waiting for 20 min. We all finished our food at the table still no one has come back to check on us. Still waiting and managed to finish writing a yelp review. This will be our last visit here, not spending anymore money at this joint. Definitely need to improve their customer service and be more attentive. 1 star for their beer 1 star for their pizookie. UPDATE:it's 8:59 had to update my review since we're still here and been here since 7pm. Asked to talked to manager and she just said there's a lot of things going on and asked her why our server just never came back she said he had some issues he couldn't deal with and had to get sent home. Manager did comp a prime rib off for the inconvenience and tried her best to explain the situation and make things better."
Jen Y.,"Newark, CA",0,7,,3.0,6/19/2017,"Usually service and food is great here. We come here at least once a week. We come when it's not so busy but for some reason, it still takes a while to get our food n drinks. Usually we're pretty satisfied with food n service. One, they were out of a lot of stuff we wanted to order....Tonight, we came for late Father's day dinner with our boys. Took 50 min till anyone came back to see how we were doing after we ordered...we just left, paid for our drinks. We got here at 830pm. Was still waiting for our food at 10:20pm. Wasn't even that busy.  Disappointed. Only thing I'll come back for is a pazooki"
Theresa L.,"Hayward, CA",0,2,,1.0,2/26/2017,"If I could give 0 stars I would. Went to BJ's Brewhouse in Fremont, CA on 2/25/17 for one of my birthday dinner celebration with 12 of my friends. This was by far the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant. I made the reservation for our large party several weeks in advance and confirmed the reservation on 2/23/17. In my opinion this was more than enough time for the restaurant to ensure that they were properly staffed Well they were not. Our reservation was for 6:15pm but we arrived early and were told that we would be seated as soon as our server arrived. We were seated at 5:45pm. We had one person taking our orders and we later found out that this was her 2nd shift. Our server apparently never showed up. As meal after meal came out, many of which were either wrong or missing items we asked for a manager at around 7:45. By this time everyone had been served and me and one other person never received our entrées. The manager, Brandi, came to the table very defensive I might add and told me that our orders had never been placed. As one of my friends was trying to explain what had been going on. Brandi said ""I don't want to argue with you"". Lady no one was arguing We were just stating fact. Brandi walks back over to me and asks if I still want my food. Uuuhh no thank you. Everyone else is done and I've been here for 2 hours already. The sad part is that Brandi was trying to blame everything on our server. Sorry it was not the servers fault that you had them working a large party of 13 people alone and on top of a double shift. Brandi as the manager should have called an all hands on deck including herself.  At one point she says I will be back in a minute. I had to go to the front counter to find her after she hadn't come back for a while. Oh I'm sorry that's probably because the other large parties were screaming and having the same issues as we were. Everyone knows with a party of more than 6, you need an additional server for the party. Brandi finally comes to the counter and says ""I'm sorry your birthday dinner didn't work out. I wish we all could've had a better evening"". Seriously I done at that point. She comes to the table and gives me and my friend who both never received our meals a $25 gift card. I will never use mine because I will never go to BJ'S again and will encourage others not to waste their time. After spending too much time trying to figure out our bill and getting that correct, we fnally left the restaurant at 9pm. Really...!!! 3 hours and 15 minutes and the birthday girl didn't even get a meal....absolutely unacceptable."
Maria S.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",0,21,2,4.0,6/18/2017,"SUPER SLOW service, so I am deducting one star.  It was Father's day, and it was busy when we arrived inn the early afternoon. We were seated after about an hour. Our food seemed to take about that long again to arrive.  The appetizer was never delivered. They ran out of queso and neglected to inform us until we asked. The food, when we finally were served, was great.  Good portions, served attractively, tasted wonderful.  The waitstaff were nice and cordial. We almost left before our desserts were served, because, again, the service was SUPER SLOW... but the ice cream scoop on a warm cookie was delicious!"
Blia T.,"Fremont, CA",0,2,,4.0,9/29/2017,"Came here for the first time for my daughter's birthday with her friends. Appetizer platter was great; club sandwiches were great; lemon chicken...Not so much the best. Unfortunately we didn't get the typical wonderful and fast service (per daughter and friends) instead we ended up being here for 2 hours. The wait time between food, refills, bday treat and tab was so ridiculous, half our party had to leave before the bday treat. Four of us left to wait for it and the tab by the time 10pm rolled around. Everyone is annoyed and I had to let it be know of the service. The GM Evan, wonderful person, hears me out,  checks out the issue, acknowledges the issue and gave gift cards. Definitely convinced me to give them another try. I didn't care about the cards but about the way he handled our issue. Kudos to Evan. Guess I will be back."
