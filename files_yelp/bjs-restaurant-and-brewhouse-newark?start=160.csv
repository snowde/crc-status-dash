Rated Y.,"Castro Valley, CA",6,27,5,1.0,3/12/2017,This place needs to be ran better I ordered a large pizza for pick up and when I got the pizza one side was smashed the pizza was cold and it was not cut into slices on top of that I had to wait 20 minutes with some girl at the front complaining how she didn't get a tip while working a 8 hr shift. I will not order here on a good day.
Kevin L.,"Oakland, CA",22,28,,2.0,1/25/2017,This is not the best BJ's I've been to. Servers are slow and food isn't even warm when it comes to the table.
Alejandro V.,"Manteca, CA",1,2,,2.0,9/26/2017,"Do not order the pizzas - overpriced for the size (medium fro approx. $20) and mediocre quality (greasy, sparse toppings, and absolutely no tomato sauce). Domino's pizzas are far superior than the one I ordered here. Also waited 45 min for a regular pizookie. Was really hoping for a better dining experience."
CAScuba Y.,"Palo Alto, CA",15,288,1463,3.0,10/16/2016,"Popular BJ don't need no more review.  I just want to remind myself their jambalaya was my favorite, much better than Fish Broiler's jimbalaya at the auto-mall.  Wish their beer is pint size for the cost they charge."
Andrew M.,"Fremont, CA",169,517,257,5.0,9/12/2016,"This by far is my favorite chain restuaurant. They have great house beer and still have good outside beers and spirits. The food is always good and service is usually really good. Outside of a few bad times, most are great. Plus if you like dessert, you can't go wrong with the pizooki...or how ever you spell it. The big tvs all around also makes this a great place to watch the game while enjoying some good food. Will keep coming back until it becomes unbareable."
Suzy S.,"Hayward, CA",282,626,134,4.0,1/25/2016,"I don't often frequent chain restaurants, but made an exception when someone gifted me with a gift card, so we decided to try it out. With that being said, I really enjoyed lunch here with Mr. S. We both ordered a entree salad of very different ingredients and both were excellent. I had the Ahi salad that was packed with enough cucumbers and other goodies to satisfy my need to crunch. Mr. S had a Southwest Chicken salad which he devoured in no time. By the time I thought I'd like to sample his, it was gone! Service was fast and friendly. A large movie complex nearby is almost ready to open so I'm sure we'll be back again soon."
Sc G.,"Fremont, CA",5,87,13,1.0,8/20/2016,"Honestly my experience everytime I go here is poor to horrible. Waiting staff are horrible here. They tend to take way to long to take orders, bring out food late or in a weird order. One time we ordered the pizookie and the brought it out with our food and we had specifically said that we wanted to make sure we got it after we got done eating.  And sadly, as good as your root beer and cream soda's are. They alway come out so flat."
Tina H.,"San Leandro, CA",427,137,123,4.0,7/24/2016,I don't come here often but when i do the food and service is always amazing! I usually get order the ribs or a pasta dish but i was in the mood for some steak! I ordered the sirloin steak with a side of seasonal veggies and Brussels sprouts. The Brussel sprouts were my favorite! My friends ordered the deep dish pastas which looked amazing! If you haven't had their pizookie (pizza cookie) before you haven't lived! They're absolutely amazing and well worth the calories!
Stephen S.,"San Jose, CA",514,9,15,2.0,6/18/2016,"I've come here a couple times with my GF. I'm usually pretty basic and either get a pizza or the spaghetti because BJ's got rid of my favorite dish, the Cajun Pasta w/ grilled chicken (UGH).  It's pretty average for a BJ's. Almost every BJ's I've been to has been a very 3/5 stars for service and I've never really had a spectacular experience with BJ's in terms of service. One of our servers did inform us that pizookies were free with a purchase of at least $10 every Tuesday until July (also half off wine! like.. bottles included!) so that was a plus.  The thing that kinda made me EH about this place was that I left my credit card with the bill when I left the restaurant (I have a problem doing this...). I called back to the restaurant because I know for sure I left it in the bill as it was nowhere in my car or wallet and I realized it was missing on the car ride home. I called back to the restaurant and they didn't have it... After checking my credit card online, a $50 purchase was made somewhere in Newark that was not by me. So... I'm pretty sure one of their employees took it and used it somewhere.  Service/food? Pretty average. But sketchy. I had to cancel my card. Thanks BJ's."
Norma L.,"Newark, CA",2,1,,1.0,2/12/2017,The service was bad ....they sat us in a table and no silverware or napkins.....food was good but slow.....server was slow and hardly came to our table......
Rita C.,"Fremont, CA",127,8,1,3.0,4/20/2017,"Went during lunch break at 12:30 not packed. But after sitting at table for 10 minutes had to go to host and ask them for a waiter? Food was good, Service below par. Especially when people are on lunch breaks should have better service.  Lunch was over an hour and all I had was a salad and lettuce wraps."
Kevin S.,"East Oakland, Oakland, CA",0,11,,1.0,4/5/2017,"Waiter here apparently doesn't know what he's doing. Waited over 15 minutes before ordering a meal. Passed us at least 3 times. My water is low a few times and ignores it when he walks by. Then later comes and check on me for a sec but my cups of water was empty. Doesn't offer to fill it up or ask me if I need any water. Waiter isn't very social, doesn't even know where the restroom is. Food was decent but bad service. The other part is he would take care of the other tables. It's pretty bogus."
Stephanie S.,"Long Beach, CA",83,30,,1.0,3/28/2017,"Maybe I came on an off night but this service is awful. Down south the place is amazing service is on point but up here y'all are slow and can't get my order right. Salad comes before the main course normally, extra plates come with the appetizer and when you ask if I want another Dr pepper don't bring root beer mainly not after you brought me a dirty glass previously! With minimum wage going up please get your act together cause this is no where near $15 hour service. If I wasn't so hungry after my flight I would of left."
Temmara S.,"Oakland, CA",157,144,564,5.0,10/29/2015,"We had a group of over 10 people and our waiter Ed was pretty damn amazing juggling all of us. We came here on a Friday night for my friends birthday and was told the wait would be about 1-1.5 hours and only ended up waiting about 40 mins. After sitting down we brought in a cake and asked if they could help us surprise my best friend. As a team, they pulled it off and it was pretty awesome. Since it was a tiered cake, we gave the bottom half to the employees.  The food was ok, there was some complications with he food not arriving on time and not tasting up to par, but Ed, took care of all that for us! He made sure that everything was ok and if we weren't happy, he didn't charge us for it. Some people need to understand that it's not the waiter, they have no control on the kitchen and how long things take. Overall it was a good experience compared to other Bj's(Concord)."
Melissa P.,"Hayward, CA",8,25,44,4.0,4/22/2017,"Review on the to go service, I really was impressed by their service. I ordered a mini supreme pepperoni pizza and their hand crafted root beer soda. I called when I was only ten minutes away from the restaurant to put in my order and when I arrived my order was ready. The pizza was the perfect amount for a single serving and the root beer was okay. My only disappoint about the root beer was I've tried it before when I ate at the restaurant and it was served in a icy cold chilled cup, when I ordered it to go it came in a plastic cup and not as cold. So, probably will pass on ordering their hand crafted sodas to go. But overall the pizza was delicious."
Anais R.,"Fremont, CA",35,13,2,3.0,11/16/2016,"The food??.....its tasty and they have a really good variety of choices.  But its dissapoiting on take outs, it has been twice when i order chicken qings with regular bbq and what i receive is wings with no sauce....mmmmm first time ok! But twice allready?  Oh and csnt forget the face that the hostess haves when u come in!! Look guys i worked in restaurants for several years and still working in a restaurant and let me tell you something, treat others the way you wanna be treated. There is no cost on having a smile!! Any ways thats my review,maybe ill go back bcuse i care less how the staff treats me im just in to the food"
Christian V.,"Oakland, CA",68,2,,1.0,7/18/2016,"Really disappointed today. Went in with a friend after craving BJ's for so long. We've both been to this specific location more than once and have never had a bad experience.  But today was terrible. We waited 5 minutes to be seated when it was not busy.  Once seated we waited for 20 minutes with no service. We had already figured out what we wanted within 10 minutes. We were not offered any drinks and more than 4 different waiters and waitresses walked by clearly trying not to acknowledge us.  We then decided to leave and returned our menus to the hostess. All we were given at that point was terrible service and a 'Sorry' which sounded like a question, ""I'm sorry?"" Did not feel like talking to the manager. We were too hungry at that point so we wanted to leave as soon as possible.   Any other times/experiences this place would have gotten an easy 4 star. But after close to a year of not coming to a BJ's and now experiencing this, I am so upset and disappointed, and most likely never going to come to this location again."
Iris M.,"San Mateo, CA",116,12,1,2.0,7/14/2016,"I've eaten at a few BJs before and this by far was my least favorite. My boyfriend and I stopped by here to eat dinner, before our movie at the AMC theater across the street. Upon walking in, the hostess took about 5 mins before she acknowledged us when the worker in front of her told her that there were customers that just walked in. Yet, she decided that folding napkins were more important.  My bf ordered, a side salad which had only about 3 croutons in it. Where are the other croutons? Did they run out? Next came our spinach and artichoke dip, which was delicious! However, after serving the dip, we noticed that it wasn't even filled half way to the top! We probably only ate about 6 chips with it. So disappointing for being a $10 appetizer.  Now for our meals, I got the roast beef dip and my bf got I believe fish tacos. He was pretty pleased with his food, but as for me, the dip was too thick for an au jus, and lacked flavor. I did not enjoy it, and didn't eat it. The best part of my meal was the thin cut fries and the honey mustard I asked on the side. Overall, I'd choose other places over BJs if I am ever back in Newark. Our server was great. Very attentive and friendly. It's the food portions that need improvement. Especially, being a big franchise such as this. Subway probably would have been more worth it."
Altoni Leen C.,"San Leandro, CA",274,76,134,1.0,7/6/2016,"Is it just me or the portion of the food is less over time.  I've been coming here for years but somehow, its more disappointing of a visit than the previous ones. Why do I keep coming back? sometimes it's the only one open around and i'm super hungry... I went here last night with my boyfriend and we ordered the spinach dip and chips, calamari, a couple of ice teas and root beers, and a large deep dish. Spinach dip: The chips were stale. The spinach dip was burned on the edges and the portion was only filled up half way through the bowl it was in. My boyfriend even looked at me and asked the waitress why the portion is so small. The waitress said that the bowl was just big and that's amount of the dip was their standard amount... lies. I've had more before. it also looked like the dip has been sitting in that bowl for hours cold and then they popped it in salamander oven to heat it up and it got burned.  We hate to send things back to the kitchen and who knows what happens in there with our food. Calamari: Last time my boyfriend and I went there, there were only 8 to 10 pieces of calamari on the appetizer plate, the size was so small, I could grab all 10 with one hand. The plate it was served on was huge as well so it made it look empty on the plate. last night, they had a smaller plate so it seems more on the plate when there wasn't. ice teas: They put too much syrup on the flavored ones. I like sweet stuff but they are very generous on the amount of syrup they pump in these drinks. Pizza: The pizza came out and it looked cold. i ate a piece and half and my boyfriend ate one slice. BJ's in this location would be my last choice"
Éva W.,"Eureka, CA",10,12,3,5.0,9/18/2016,"Great food, the game was on, it was super busy but we were seated quickly. It was my friend's birthday so we got a complimentary bazookie which was very sweet.  Yudasi was the BEST. Very attentive, friendly, sweet and made extra sure we had everything we needed. Request to sit in her section her and tip her well! :)"
