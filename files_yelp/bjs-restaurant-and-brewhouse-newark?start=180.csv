Sofia A.,"Castro Valley, CA",403,156,294,5.0,6/2/2016,"My friends and I came here late on a Saturday night. We were worried there would be a long wait and we were hungry but around 11 there was no wait at all. I assumed there would be a lot of people at the bar. We got seated at a nice booth and our server took our order fast. He was nice but it often seemed like he was rushing us and trying to get us out the restaurant. I understand it was late and he was tired but the place wasn't even closing until 1. Also a big problem with him was that he had extremely bad body order. My whole table could smell it and even when he walked by. We literally had to hold our breath when he came to the table. I guess he was hard at work though right? Hahah As for the food, they have an extensive menu all the way from pizzas to burgers to pastas to unique baked potatoes. Their bacon burger was probably one of the best and highest quality burgers I have ever had. It was so good I'm dreaming about it right now. I also always order their root beer because it comes from the tap with no foam. I'm not much of a beer drinker so I don't really opt for their beers but they have a large array of selections. Overall, great franchise restaurant just wish our server was wearing deodorant lol I'm always a fan of this place."
Alayna S.,"San Jose, CA",203,94,93,3.0,11/30/2015,"I've dined in about 4 times & still haven't had a satisfying experience.  - This review is for this specific night. November 29th, I ordered a to-go at 11pm. This was a hard weekend, my daughters been sick / fever, sleeping / eating schedule all messed up.. We all felt like we needed a nice dinner in bed. Completely happy when receiving our meal. Felt good to know that even when the cooks & employees got that last Sunday night late late late to go order- they still did a great job with our order. - Spaghetti & meatball. Chicken club. Fetti & chicken kids meal.  - The girl who helped us at the to go area was very nice too.  Looking forward to dining in another time & trying that experience out again!"
Mimi 9.,"Fremont, CA",0,15,2,1.0,7/13/2016,"The floor was very dirty, bathrooms wet allover and no paper toilet, although we went for diner, still all this things need immediate attention.. Also I order coffe al. I notice the cup was super dirty from half way down, I asked to have a clean one and the waitress said that all cups are like that!!! supposed to be white inside out, they don't care about the cleanliness... Definitely DON'T COME BACK..."
George W.,"Fremont, CA",226,30,28,4.0,12/18/2015,"For what it is, BJ's is a decent restaurant overall. It is not a NY pizzeria nor is it a gourmet pizza, however it is a nice brewery that happens to serve pizza. Come here more for the social atmosphere and the many beers on tap vs. coming here to get the greatest pizza ever. It's good to have the proper expectations when going into a restaurant so that there isn't a major let down. We were here this past week for an office party hosted by BJ's. Food was decent, drinks were good, the time we had was great. If you have room for dessert.... order the pizookie. That's worth it!"
SouthStack F.,"Hayward, CA",87,18,,1.0,3/23/2017,First we waited 45 minutes for a table after they said 15 minutes.  Second they gave my friend a half a burger patty and had to remake it.  Third a side I ordered never came.  Forth two of us ordered pazookies for desert. Ten minutes later the manager comes and tells us one of our pazookies cant be made due to recalls.
Gaganpreet S.,"Santa Clara, CA",1,6,,1.0,4/2/2017,"Went to the place last week and was having a good time up until I found a female hair in my burger and that too in my bite, in my mouth..Ugghhh.. I felt so disgusted afterwards and just wanted to leave..I rinsed my mouth for like 5 mins straight after that..Terrible experience"
Terri G.,"Albuquerque, NM",105,17,16,3.0,7/2/2017,"I gave up on coming here for entrees because to always been subpar but the pizzookie is always amazing!! I would post a picture but I always eat it too quickly to snap one. Warm, gooey, chocolatey and basically the best thing you will eat in your entire life. Have dinner somewhere else but come here for pizzookie!"
Susan B.,"Hayward, CA",186,46,91,5.0,8/21/2016,"Food is always good, had the clam chowder in a bread bowl. The best I've ever had. They toasted the bread bowl with butter and garlic. It might have been oil and garlic, doesn't really matter. It was fantastic. Yummy in my tummy."
Christina H.,"San Ramon, CA",23,163,71,5.0,1/12/2016,"For the North bay area, so far this BJ's Restaurant is the best. Good service, good food that is always consistent, and good atmosphere. No matter which server comes to serve my team (Work team) it has always been a pleasant one. The food I order always come out delicious. I eat at the BJ's by my work/home in Dublin and I have to say it's like eating at a different restaurant.  If anyone trying BJ's for the 1st time, come to this location. :)"
Mika D.,"Bay Area, CA",83,197,2,2.0,12/28/2016,"Me and a friend went here to eat this past weekend for dinner.I ordered a beer and my friend ordered a soda. A few minutes later he changed his mind and ordered an ice tea. The waitress tried to argue with him telling him she already placed the order, so she could not change (strike #1). We flagged down another waitress, and she with no hesitation went to get the ice tea and apologized for the other waitress rudeness. Waitress brought our food out a few minutes later, and didn't come back to check on us until it was time to go (strike #2). I ordered a chocolate Pizooki to go, she brought back a chocolate chip Pizooki instead! (WTF...strike #3)! I don't know if she was new or just extremely unprofessional, but her service made me think twice about coming back to this one. I've been here several times and used to enjoy it, but I started to notice that many of the wait staff just don't give a $hit about good service anymore."
Josephine L.,"Foster City, CA",305,237,472,3.0,1/10/2015,"Avocado egg rolls: $6 during happy hour, but be warned- it's happy hour-sized! It says so on the happy hour menu, albeit in a very light unnoticeable gray color in a tiny font. We tried to order these but they came back and told us they ran out :( it was around 11 pm on a Thursday night.  Santa Fe spring rolls: these are pretty tiny. Comes with eight halves during happy hour, not sure how many there are in a normal portion. These have chicken, black beans, red bell peppers, cilantro, corn , jalapeño and jack cheese. They were okay. I wouldn't get them again. The avocado egg rolls are way better (I've tried them during regular meal time before), and much larger.  Mini deep dish pizza: $6 during happy hour, also happy hour sized. But you can get as many toppings as you want! It's basically personal pizza size. But it's deep dish! It was good and came piping hot. I got pepperoni pineapple mushroom jalapeño. I ended up ordering another one after we finished the first one... My friend ordered a pizookie, but alas, the waiter forgot to enter the order in, so we did not end up getting one. The waiter was nice enough though, other than that blunder."
Ryan J.,"Union City, CA",445,346,757,2.0,12/7/2014,"Now I know why I don't come here that often....service is SLOW! 3 of my friends and I came here on a Wed night. We sat down and weren't helped for about 10 minutes. Once we looked at the menu and figured out what we wanted we waived down our waitress who zoomed by and told us that she would be with us shortly. So another 10 minutes go by and she finally takes our order, pitcher of beer and burgers all around. It took about another 15 minutes for the beer to come and then another 10 minutes after that for the food to arrive despite the place being relatively empty. Plus since we all ordered burgers, it should be pretty easy to make instead of making 4 different dishes.  We requested that the burgers be cooked medium, yet we all got burgers that were for sure well done. No pink in the middle and it was not juicy at all. We could have asked for this to be cooked a little more, but we were worried that it would take forever for us to get our food back so we ended up just eating the brick of meat. This place gets 1 star for amazing pizookies & pizzas. They get another star for their beers! I love the different cookie selections for their pizookies and I love the beers that are brewed here since they are so rich in flavor! Unfortunately, I will probably not go back here unless I want dessert or a beer. I honestly don't think I should wait this long on a slow day. If this place was packed, I understand, but this is unacceptable. Sorry guys, but I'd rather go to other sports bars/restaurants for quicker service, better food, and cheaper prices."
K P.,"Fremont, CA",0,13,11,3.0,8/21/2015,"Food is very good, service is good, i think most of the things are good and i just want to say about the light, it's sooooo dark you can't read the menu if you don't have the iPhone flashlight with you. Yes that's the only thing I want to let BJ restaurant owner know, may be he/she should go to BJ and try out to read the menu at dinner time. Thanks  Kim"
Stuart B.,"Oakland, CA",69,56,121,3.0,12/24/2016,"They're food and drink menu (including Happy Hour) is too pricey. I ordered the chicken bacon panini with fries. The panini was good. The fries were not on point. They came out shriveled up. I ordered a mojito and it was not strong . The bartender was patient, fairly attentive, and mostly cheerful! The happy hour options are nothing to s"
Anna K.,"Cambridge, MA",153,139,331,4.0,12/18/2015,"Good for a chain, the appetizers are surprisingly yummy. Great selection of beers, obviously. The service is great, fast and welcoming."
Maggie H.,"Daly City, CA",0,3,,1.0,6/11/2017,"This is a review only based on their takeout.  We ordered a BJ's Favorite pizza and a mozzarella and tomato salad.  As we each took a slice of pizza, we noted how odd it was that quite a bit of cheese, olives, sausage and onion was stuck to the bottom of the box.  Some of the slices of pizza looked a bit bare on the toppings, it really looked more like a pepperoni pizza.  It looked as if someone put the pizza in upside down, realized their mistake and just flipped it over.  At the very least, they could've put it in a new box and I would've just assumed they skimped on the toppings!  When we started on the salad, which I had asked for extra lettuce (there was even a sticker on it with my request)...  Well, in case you were wondering, extra lettuce comes out to two whole pieces!   Not a fan of takeout, would never do it again at this location."
Angkor T.,"Tracy, CA",104,36,132,4.0,2/18/2017,This is my favorite BJ's restaurant. I like most of their appertizers and that what we eat most. We went there too many times. Waiters are gerally nice and service is good. We tried their new spicy peanut chicken saba noodles the first time. We did not like it much. Their Ahi Pokes is the best.
Cindy E.,"Milpitas, CA",148,4,2,4.0,11/12/2015,"BJ's has been one of my favorite restaurants for years but since the baby was born, this was our first chance to come as there are not many locations near us. Our party consisted of me, my husband and my 2yr old. Although the food was good, it didn't amaze me like it used to. The Buffalo Wings have sauce on them. If I remember correctly, they used to be dry with the dipping sauces (buffalo & ranch) on the side. We liked it better that way. They just taste like any other Buffalo Wings now.  What really disappointed me was my child's food. Luckily he liked it though. Why? Because his Mac & Cheese was out of the box! He has that once in a while at home but I make it better! I cook it longer & add cheese for flavor. BJ's kid meal Mac & Cheese was chewy, clumpy & lacking flavor. I added a pic to the photos section. The BJ's non caffeinated, no fructose syrup root beer was delicious & a big hit with the kid. The chilled fresh fruit was yummy & sweet. The Kid Meal was reasonably priced at $5.75.  The Hubby said his burger was ""good"". The bun was soft & not too ""doughy"". The double patties were grilled to his satisfaction. My Zitti tasted a lot better than it looked. It was delicious. Didn't look like the picture where you can see the pasta poking out of the sauce. When I received it, I saw a little pan halfway filled with crusted cheese. Didn't see the pasta until I scooped it up with my fork. Extremely flavorful. Although it didn't look like a lot, I couldn't finish it bc the oil started getting to me. The oil naturally accumulates at the bottom of the dish and after a while I felt like I was drinking it.  Our server was friendly although she forgot a few important things. She handed us our food without our silverware & napkins. The wait time for the food was great although the wait time to eat the food (bc we didn't have any silverware) was not as great. We still tipped our waitress generously for her smiles, apologies & effort.  Although we received our meals very quickly, it took our Pizookie dessert almost 4x times that wait. It was nice that our waitress came by twice to apologize & explained that they were backed up in the kitchen. We had trouble staying awake as we were so full and just longed to be home since we had quite a drive. Just as we were about to cancel our dessert, we received it. I normally love Salted Caramel everything but the Pizookie flavor was just too much for me. It was too salty & too sweet at the same time. I'll remember to not order that next time. I did love my husband's Peanut Butter Pizookie though!  Overall, we enjoyed our meal. Husband's meal was free as he was a veteran invited for Veteran's Day. I am extremely appreciative of BJ's support of our veterans. I heard about BJ's special meal through Facebook (many friends were having a meal here too) & since it's our favorite restaurant, I decided to surprise the Hubby with this treat. Being a Stay At Home Mother & having a hard working, dedicated husband, we all deserved this special treat on this special day. Big thanks to BJ's!"
Evelyn M.,"Castro Valley, CA",197,110,1577,4.0,6/30/2016,Last time I came for the free pazookie day I was forgot about so they comped my meal that time n gave me a $15 gift card. Today I am back for another free pazookie day n to use my gift card. Server was nice n food was good the only reason I took out a star was coz the server didn't time right on when to check on us. She checked on us when we just got the food n didn't offer to refill our drink. We had to ask n she got it to us after the other items we asked for when need a lil bit during our meal. but all was good got our free desert n I am much happier than I was prior to the last time I came.
