JaeDean P.,"Buena Park, CA",0,4,1,4.0,1/15/2017,"The hostess had interesting hair. It kept me entertained while we waited. The wait time wasn't usually long. We ordered some drinks (Alabama Sunrise!) which were great. I had two. The woman that brought us the drinks placed the obviously alcoholic drink right in front of my obviously young (11 year old) nephew. That made me uncomfortable. Side note: If you're sensitive to spice, do NOT order the fried chicken. They pour peppered gravy all over it. I ordered the Cherry Chipotle Salmon. It was amazing! I wish they offered it with rice or something with more carbs."
Al S.,"Union City, CA",245,140,272,5.0,4/5/2016,"5-star service for Nate.  He was very friendly and positive throughout our visit.  And as busy as the restaurant was, he made time to check regularly. Side note, BJ's Classic Supreme Pizza was good and plenty. :)"
Laurel M.,"Fremont, CA",45,195,265,4.0,3/27/2015,"Stopped by for a beer at happy hour around 5pm on a Thursday.  The bar was pretty full, but we were able to find a table and were waited in immediately.  The happy hour prices are great for beer and light appetizers.  Since we just came for a drink, we didn't order food this time around, but a few of my favorites are the tomato and mozzarella salad with balsamic glaze dressing and the avocado egg rolls.  The nutty brunette ale is also one of my favorite darker beers and the only one I order at Bj's. Can't go wrong at this place for happy hour!"
Allie B.,"Belsera, Bakersfield, CA",118,6,1,1.0,7/10/2017,"My husband and I were on a date night.  Our service was beyond terrible.   We were in the restaurant for nearly 3 hours.   It took 25 minutes to even get some water and tea.  Then we waited another 30 minutes to get our appetizer.   Took 30-40 to even order our food.  I understand food takes awhile to make but this place wasn't entirely packed and it was staffed very well.  Our food eventually comes out after way too long of waiting for meals, my meal was cold.   The shrimp and pasta noodles weren't even remotely warm.   Our drinks took forever to get refilled.  I asked our server to take my plate back, and it was finally made how it should have come out.   Our server wasn't very attentive at all, my husband had been waiting for a refill for about 40 mins and had to start drinking mine.  Do not recommend.  I was utterly disappointed with the lack of service, and care for their customers.   Was more than annoyed and practically ruined our date night."
Stephani M.,"Airport Mail Center, CA",607,405,1744,4.0,1/21/2015,"#22 Thank you Nate (my incredible service professionnal) for an awesome lunch at BJ's. I went to Newark to meet a few friends for lunch, and they suggested BJ's, so I met them WAY OUT there.  The parking situation was incredibly awful.  I have to park near the door in the handicap parking area at the moment, but there was no easy way to make that happen due to the construction and the poor signage in the lot.  They have the regular parking area fenced off from what looked to be the employee area.  Okay...I will hobble, whatever.   After fighting my way through the cumbersome parking area, I entered the restaurant and the hostess greeted me in a friendly manner.  I told her I would be meeting friends, but right then I saw them standing up, waving and yelling at me...embarrassing ;(  lol I meandered over to the table with Jociel to meet all of our friends awaiting our arrival so they could order.  Nate greeted us at the table and he remembered me from about 5 years ago at a restaurant nearby...WOW!  (I wish I had that memory, my studies would move along so much faster!) He even called me ""Tall Skinny Vanilla Latte"" remembering that I was drinking one when we met and it was easy to describe the drink because i am tall, skinny and vanilla...but anyway... We ordered a few items to begin with: Corn Fritters Ahi Poke Tuna Artichoke Pizzette The corn fritter were crazy good!  They were hot, fresh and delicious.  Served over an aioli sauce that was to die for with real corn nibblets to garnish the dish.  The Ahi was amazing as well.  A pretty large portion for a small bite share plate, but who is complaining?  The little pizza arrived and it was spectacular!  It was hard to save any to take home... Nate took such great care of our every need, even the two people who arrived late.  I would give 5 stars, but that parking was a fiasco!  If I were the manager I would not only complain but would also seek to resolve the parking issues during the construction.  It really is inconvenient to the guests, especially for guests with mobility issues. Nate gets 5 stars, but BJ's as a whole--4...   Stephani Smiles for BJ's ;)"
Aaron S.,"Newark, CA",25,1,,1.0,1/1/2017,"Brought a date here and instead of bringing a small pizza like we ordered, our waiter brought out a large. After letting him know we ordered a small he wanted to take it back and bring out a small. So it was either accept the large and pay for it or wait another thirty minutes for the small to come out. We just took the large and paid for it. Terrible service. Never coming back here."
Thomas C.,"San Jose, CA",0,5,,1.0,7/1/2017,Went here go to after the movies there was plenty of available sitting they still made us wait with our kids for almost an hour as they had no clue or care how to seat people and stood there talking the whole time to each other. management really needs to look into this.
Shema P.,"New York, NY",45,83,47,4.0,4/26/2016,"I love BJs! I've been here quite a few times before I started helping and now that I moved back from NY can go more. I love their Mediterranean pizza! The crust is just perfect. The pizookie is bomb. I don't care for the jambalaya and the chicken Alfredo is ok. I guess Alfredo is supposed to be very bland and if you're going for savory not the best. The root beer ribs is honestly one of the best things. Literally falls off the bone. Prices are good because they give you a lot of food. As far as drinks go, I mean if you're going for alcohol at brewery get beer. I'm not a beer person so I thought I'd get the white peach margarita, didn't really taste any alcohol or peachiness and it was about 97% ice. I'd come back of course but not for the drinks."
Samir S.,"Fremont, CA",176,8,,1.0,12/26/2016,"I ordered the house steak with their ""special"" dry rub. Waited around 30 mins for it to come. Once it arrived it was THE most dry POORLY cooked piece of you know what. Not only did I send my food back but two other tables next to us did the SAME. If you want quality food DO NOT come here. Our waiter was not at fault, this was 100% on the kitchen."
Jackie G.,"San Jose, CA",12,35,3,1.0,2/18/2017,"I went here a few weeks ago, I have not had the time to review but I'm here now to share my experience. 1St off we had a seat and everything was working out it was after a staff meeting next door and a group of us decided to come eat here. The waitress said we can have separate checks which was great because there was allot of us and we all ordered different price items. The waitress took our order and it took 55 minutes to get our food. We were looking around because we wanted to check on the status but no-one would stop by. We saw that allot of the tables around us were having the same problem. The waiters where by the cashiers chatting away. Finally we started getting our order, and one of our appetizers was not out yet. It came as the last dish and when we asked to take out the second appetizer because it had been like 1:25 minutes since the waiter said the kitchen already made it. We asked to speak to a manager and she tried to argue that the avocado rolls were already made. My couleage insisted on talking to the manager. The manager got there and we asked to get  the avocado rolls taken off the bill and told him about our experience. He was arguing that the avocado rolls were requested as regular dishes and not appetizers. Then three coworkers got the lunch specials and they were charge dinner price. When the coworkers asked the manager about it he called over the waitress and the waitress said they never specified they wanted the lunch special price. WTF!!!! The waitress was this young asian girl and i think she had colored eyes. The manager was a young caucasian guy. Both who were useless and ridiculous. The service was horrible and we all ended up getting in trouble for what need up being a almost 3 hour lunch. They need a do some quality control there."
Kristine F.,"Hayward, CA",446,567,3746,4.0,5/11/2014,"I highly recommend the honey mustard crisp salad (grilled chicken on mine). Mmm chopped greens tossed with honey mustard dressing, chopped hard boiled eggs, corn, cucumbers and topped with tomatoes, almond slivers, and normally crisp fried chicken strips.  For appetizers we usually get the spinach stuffed mushrooms and fried artichokes for ~$5 each! The mushrooms sit atop cilantro aioli drizzle and the artichokes are kinda sour (arrives with ranch). My second favorite dish is the parmesan crusted chicken with mashed potatoes and broccoli. The cream sauce is satisfying and not too heavy while the chicken is lightly pan fried.  I prefer the crispy thin fries over the mini potato wedge style; both options are available. As for the pizookies, oh gosh are they indulgent. I got tired of basic chocolate chip with vanilla bean ice cream so I've tried the red velvet and new salted caramel ones. All of them are sweet and take some time to bake so snag your server halfway through the meal to order. Btw, Rosario waited on us during Mother's day and was a great waitress. She was on top of her game and didn't rush when taking our drink orders; she even had time to take all of our orders at the same time (drinks, apps, entrees), which was convenient for our group. She remembered to put in our to go order at a decent time as well.  *remember to do call ahead seating!"
Melea-An A.,"Salinas, CA",468,27,4,1.0,4/8/2016,"I did not enjoy my time here at all. Mainly because of the long wait we had to go through.  We got seated at around 10:30 pm. It was a little busy, but it wasn't super packed. It took maybe 30 minutes for a server to get us some drinks. His section didn't even look super busy! After we got our drinks, it took probably another 30 minutes, or more, for our server to take our orders. Before our order got taken, we were trying to get the attention from a different server so he could help us out, but he completely ignored us and only tended to his section. I found that completely rude. I am also a server at a different restaurant, and I always give my attention to any customer who calls out for me even if they aren't in my section. After we finished eating, our server, AGAIN, took forever for him to give us our check and a to-go box for our food. The manager had to come over and ask us what we needed so she could tell our server. When our server came over to drop off he check and box, he didn't even apologize for the long wait. In fact, he didn't say anything to us at all. He just dropped it off and that's it.  The food was good. I just wish our service was better."
Payal P.,"Union City, CA",40,113,112,2.0,1/4/2016,"This experience is mainly for the service and not the food. Food was fine and pretty normal for BJs but the service was pretty bad. I don't know if it was because the server seemed new or not but it was just not good and I don't know if i'll be back at this location in the near future. Had a table reserved for 8, including 1 baby/toddler. They had reserved a booth but anyone who has a kid knows how fussy babies can get in crowded spaces so a table would have been better? Just to be able to get out in case of bathroom emergencies.  Anyway, so we all sit down and the server eventually comes to us, we order our drinks. When she returned with the drinks, we gave her our appetizer choices since we were still undecided on entrees but just to start the night since we didn't want her to have to wait around forever and be confused. PS BJ's drinks are soooooo sugary. Anyway, we gave her our appetizer choices and asked to have a small pizza made to come out with the appetizers for the toddler since she was getting a little rowdy and hungry.  She comes back a little while later and takes our entree orders. We had a family member who was vegetarian and asked her about more vegetarian options and she completely blanked. I understand it's an extensive menu but I would think it wouldn't be too hard to remember a few vegetarian options since there aren't that many but hey, maybe she just didn't know. Instead of asking someone, she didn't really give us a straight answer and we just haphazardly chose a vegetarian burger since there seemed to be nothing else, at least not that she could remember.  Eventually we got all our appetizers but then.... no pizza. The toddler is becoming fussy at this point and just wants her food. We ask our waitress how long it would be for the pizza and she says ""oh no! I added it to the entree order instead of the appetizer order!"" Let's just say the toddler's parents were not happy. Mind you, there had to have been about 20 minutes between when she took our appetizer order and when she took our entree orders. So did she not put in the appetizer order right away or....? i don't even know but yeah, not cool. The baby's pizza had been cheese with olives and asparagus. When it eventually did come out, it was olives and only the end parts of asparagus. You know, the really hard parts? The ones you would usually throw away because you cannot chew it? Yeah, that's what was on the pizza meant for a toddler. Needless to say, she didn't eat them.  Overall, sorely disappointed with this experience. They were nice enough to toss in a free pizookie for my parent's anniversary but my parents still did not enough the overall experience. I think the should take a little more care when kids are involved because unlike adults, they are not patient. Maybe if there hadn't been a kid involved, we would have been more patient or accepting of the situation. But not when a baby/toddler is fussing and obviously hungry. Just my two cents."
Lai L.,"Hayward, CA",6,43,25,4.0,3/9/2016,"I usually don't do chain restaurants, but BJ's is an exception to the rule. This place is always packed on the weekends, but I don't mind the wait because the service and food are mostly always consistent. I usually go there for the beer. Tatonka, please! There were a couple of times when my food was not at par such as this one time when my fries were cold and my burger was dry as hell. Another time was when I found a strand of hair in my salad, but the manager brought me a new one and didn't charge me for it and even offered to buy my husband and me a drink, so that made up for the hair (eww).  The pizzas are the most popular items here here and my favorite is the Mediterranean. I also like to order their tacos and salads. I always have a great time when I come here and the servers are usually good about checking up on us. Since I visit BJ's a lot, there was one time when I had slow service, but that's one time out of many. Pizza and beer, the American staples."
Adila A.,"Newark, CA",0,1,,1.0,12/4/2016,"Horibble service. Messes up order and wrong cake. Slow service, would not clean up.  Don't  recommend going here. Forgets orders and check.:("
Mary Lynn P.,"Verona, PA",71,16,7,5.0,4/11/2016,TripAdvisor led us to the BJ's - and we are happy!!  We stopped in... not hungry for a full meal but had 2 delicious appetizers!!!  The boneless wings and avocado spring rolls were delicious - served piping hot!  The drinks were ample and the service outstanding - Kishan did an excellent job!!! We will be sure to return the next time we are in the area!!
Yaneli G.,"Hayward, CA",5,3,,4.0,4/22/2016,Amazing place for beer and does avocado rolls. Let's not forget the pizookie!!  April was such a great server checking on us frequently.
Roberta M.,"Hayward, CA",0,11,3,4.0,4/22/2017,"Our group consisted of six grandmas.  Our server was a nice young man named Trevion.  He made our lunch very enjoyable.  He was quick, polite, and very personable!  All of us enjoyed the food as well."
Mihir M.,"Fremont, CA",307,821,493,3.0,9/22/2016,"BJ's is a chain with a variety of food. They are known for their alcohol. They make 4 sodas which are great, with refills, so you ask for shots of each of them & get charged for only 1 drink - black cherry, cream, orange cream & root beer (this is a non alcoholic drink in case you do't know). The virgin margherita was too thick for a drink. During happy hour, many items are discounted, including their personal pizzas, which I don't like much as they don't have a lot of sauce. They have several vegetarian pizzas & flatbreads, which are ok. The atmosphere is young, cool, & sporty. They have cookie (not eggless though) & ice cream (not eggless) deserts which are also nice."
Lou-Lou M.,"Hayward, CA",55,2,2,2.0,1/14/2015,"Service: Came in here earlier for dinner. My friend and I got here around 6:30 pm. We only waited two minutes to get seated. But, it took 10 minutes to find a waiter to place our orders. Our food came 10 minutes later, but the waitress assigned to our section didn't appear until much later. She seemed nice, but for a restaurant staff servicing the dining room, she didn't smell clean. There was one time when my friend and I took a whiff of her body odor as she walked past us and it made us gag while chewing on our food. That's pretty gross. Food: We got our food rather quickly. We only ordered two dishes tonight: 1) Shrimp Scampi Pasta was EXCELLENT! This dish comes with a generous amount of flavored shrimp over angel hair pasta tossed in a light, perfect blend of olive oil, butter, garlic, lemon juice and diced Roma tomatoes. They dish was topped with grated Parmesan cheese, and a dash of bread crumbs and chopped parsley. A full order is about $19, but the serving is enough to be split in two. We truly enjoyed this dish and will definitely get this at the next visit.  2) A large, hand-tossed pizza-half ""BJ'S Favorite"" AKA The Works (Oven-baked meatballs, pepperoni, Italian sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, black olives, white onions and seasoned tomatoes) and half ""Sweet Pig"" (best known as Hawaiian). Both flavors look good on paper, but both failed in taste and texture. Both sides of the pie were dry. Our pizza was served on a cold ceramic pizza plate-not on a hot, stainless pizza pan straight from the oven. The pizza pie/crust didn't taste fresh either-it got cold and chewy fairly fast. Very disappointing. Summary: The restaurant is simple and airy. The crowd is good and decent. Noise level is fair. Tonight's dining experience was below average in my opinion. Sign up for BJ's Premium Rewards online and get free stuff like BJ's Famous Pizookie. They give a point per dollar spent.  Rating: For this visit, I'd give it a 2/5 rating. They need more attentive wait staff or I'd think twice bringing a family here because you'll wait a long time to get served. The food came quick, but we weren't asked even once if we enjoyed our meal.  I'll highly recommend Shrimp Scampi Pasta. I'm not a big fan of deep dish pizza, but I'll give it BJ's pizza another shot next time I come back here and hopefully, I'll have a better review then."
