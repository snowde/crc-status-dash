Tessa S.,"Fremont, CA",52,38,18,3.0,9/18/2016,"I loooove BJ's! I love the food, the drinks, the servers and the atmosphere. There's only one downside - service is sooooo slow. I don't think it's the servers fault though. I think it's management's fault. I'm not sure how many tables one server is allowed to have, but it seems to be way too many in order to make sure all the guests needs are attended to in a timely manner. Either way I'll still keep coming. The happy hour here is too good to pass up. Just wish they could figure out how to speed up the service a little bit."
Beverly H.,"Fremont, CA",0,8,,2.0,5/5/2017,"Came here with my husband on a Thursday night. No wait to be seated.  Looked through the massive menu and decided on an appetizer and our entree long before a server even came to our table to get our drink orders. The couple that was seated next to us got up and walked out because no server helped them after waiting a good 15 minutes. Anyway, my husband and I went to BJ's last week & the service was good and the pizza was good. Not so this time. Service was horrible and my pizza was greasy. We saw the manager once and thats when our neighbors walked out. I normally see a restaurant manager walking around making small talk with the customers. Oh, and don't sit a party of 2 next to 3 huge parties of 8."
Alex M.,"San Lorenzo, CA",12,35,7,3.0,3/25/2016,"This place is never really hot and it's never too cold, sometimes the food is decent but we really don't go here for the food we come for the beer and the space to eat with good company, always a mix of working professionals, family, tinder dates, etc  I don't know why anyone would rate any of this food more than 3 stars get out of the house more often or put a few more miles on the odometer and find a real meal. Same as Cheesecake Factory there's just lots of calories, fats, salts and empty carbs. I would give 3.5 if I could for the beer selection and the place is always clean but just based off food 3 stars. Service is same as food, it's hit or miss"
Sheila A.,"Fremont, CA",6,11,30,1.0,11/21/2015,"Complaint: waited forever for our waiter to take our order, waited for wings (40 min) and it came out wrong. And waited for $10 off coupon to be cleared by the manager (20 min). Manager was not helpful at when we complained to her. Manager, Melissa, is the worse. She needs to stop chatting away with the hostesses in the front and start helping her new employees get the hang of their new jobs. You don't throw your new hires under the bus cause that's a reflection on management and how they prepare their employees.  Our waiter was new (3rd day on the job) so we were understanding on his situation. It just sucks to see that no one was looking over him to see if he was doing okay and able to handle dinner rush by himself.  Our waiter tried his best but needs more training.  Will come back for late night happy hour but not for dinner rush."
Andres S.,"Anaheim, CA",531,90,55,5.0,7/23/2016,"The service was great.  Our server recommended amazing drinks, that we loved.  I definitely like this place"
Marigold M.,"Fremont, CA",15,166,98,1.0,3/21/2017,Food is average not over the top. The service is hit or miss. First time I came April was our server. And was on point. So awesome. Next time we came our server Kassandra spent more time talking to her co workers or completely ignoring us. We ended up asking a busboy to refill our drinks. Then had to waver her down just to get our bill closed out.
Lisa A.,"Fremont, CA",40,71,,5.0,4/9/2016,"Great food.  Great service.  New menu.  The only negative, which is true of most restaurants, it's noisy on weekends at dinner time."
Morgan F.,"Fremont, CA",69,99,271,4.0,4/8/2015,"I go to this place for games, alcohol, and appetizers. And I love it every time!  When I go, I almost always get good, efficient service.  They have a huge big screen to watch sports in the bar area (seat yourself). So many of the appetizers are great. I like the ahi poke, mozzarella and tomato salad, fried artichokes, and thai shrimp lettuce wraps. This time I tried their new pepperoni pizza dip. So good. The Crostinis tasted a bit stale, but they were still worth eating."
Guahivi M.,"Fremont, CA",13,1,1,4.0,4/19/2016,"Great place to have a drink.  I had a shared full rack baby back rib that was so good, also ordered a broccoli cheese soup that tasted more like chip's dip (didn't like it).   Kids Mac n cheese and traditional wings were dry.But in general is clean, good service and tasty. My suggestions try baby back ribs or signature deep dish pizza and come at lunch time because at night is very busy."
Giz N.,"Union City, CA",2,37,1,2.0,10/4/2016,"I'd give this place 2.2 stars only because their beer selection is decent.  Their entrees are mediocre at best.  We had their deep dish pizza and it came out cold!  For an entree like that, I should expect the cheese to be melting and the crust to be hot.  When I took my first bite, i noticed that the cheese wasn't completely melted and the crust wasn't even room temperature.  I asked them to re-heat it and there was no change!  We had the Avocado Rolls as an appetizer and it was the only decent dish we had.  Service was.....mehhh.  The only other saving grace with our meal was the beer.  If you want good beer, come here.  If you want to eat, you may want to go somewhere else especially if you want a deep dish pizza."
kashmita p.,"Hayward, CA",1,9,5,3.0,4/18/2016,"Food is good and the environment is nice. I barely go here, but I love going for the desserts and drinks from the bar. My cousin and I usually get a trio of the pazookies. Recently got their monkey bread pazookie and it tasted amazing. Similar to a cinnamon bun from cinnabon."
Kaila S.,"Newark, CA",1,17,17,3.0,4/17/2016,"The food here is pretty good, nothing really extraordinary though. The atmosphere is nice and open and spacing is great. This place is great for food but it's not a place that I would immediately want to go to if I was craving something"
Allen C.,"Fremont, CA",107,414,3984,4.0,6/5/2013,"Of all the BJ's we've eaten at, this is our favorite.  First off, parking is a breeze at this location.  The lot is large.  I don't usually select pork when I eat out because many places don't cook it the way I like, including the other BJ's.  But our server recommended the Maui Glazed Pork Chop without hesitation so I gave it a try.  It was cooked perfectly - nice grill mark, moist inside and flavorful.  The potatoes would have been better if they were smaller in size but I still liked them.  The green beans were blanched and unsalted for the health factor?  Wife's Creole Tilapia was overall enjoyable except one tomato wedge was frozen solid. We got quirky and ordered the ""BJ's Bake Beignet"" deconstructed as we have an aversion to soggy bread.  It wasn't the Nawlin style fried puffy beignet covered with powdered sugar.  It was more like a light bun topped with cinnamon and sugar. Yum!  So glad we had the strawberries and vanilla bean ice cream on the side. The greatness of the bun itself would have been masked otherwise."
Nichele R.,"Union City, CA",39,138,72,3.0,6/22/2016,"So I came here to do their curbside lunch delivery service which I though would be pretty convenient. Not! I go inside to pick up my order so I can continue on to work since I was on my lunch. I get to the side desk for quick pick up and I see my food just sitting there on top of the back table and the server who is assisting anyone with curbside orders just looks at me, looks away real fast as if trying to purposely avoid eye contact and then continues on sending out orders to other patrons. No ""hi welcome to BJ's"", no ""one moment miss I'll be right with you"". No, I got none of that. Just her awkwardly avoiding eye contact with me for the next 10 minutes while I'm burning holes into her with my stare. I want her to see I'm getting impatient. She FINALLY addresses me in a half-hearted ""one moment"" then jets off to go to another order. Umm, when it come so customer service you at least address a patron who is wasting their time and spending money in their establishment. And you most CERTAINLY assist the person right there in front of you and not someone who has not even gotten to the restaurant yet for their order.  She finally checks me out for my order after waiting a grand total of 16 minutes when it was supposed to be a quick pick up. Hence the reasoning behind why they have this service in the first place.  If you hate your job then change it. Don't take it out on the patrons going to your establishment with no smile no welcome just your bitter attitude. Yuck, where's a different BJ's at? This one lost its luster, especially after gaining some of it back after removing all the derelicts and thieves from the motel 6 that used to be in the back."
Erik E.,"San Jose, CA",0,9,,1.0,4/29/2017,Poor service and cold food.  We never had a dedicated server and had to get up repeatedly to find people.  Don't eat here.
A J.,"Fremont, CA",0,7,1,1.0,3/29/2016,"I used to love this place. Now they cannot keep up with volume. Every Time you go before your order is served your server goes on break??? And now tried take out and got served pizza with hair in it. It has turned into a terrible restaurant. ------- Additional review... So a friend of mine wanted to meet for drinks and catch-up here. He was closer to the place and I accommodated and went their regardless of my disliking couple of weeks back.  Yet again pathetic service level. We ordered second round of drinks and he stepped out for a smoke and  I just went along. We informed our waiter. Ordered more food & drinks while we still had more food. We came back to see all of our food was gone. Person waiting our table was very aware of what happened while remaining order was getting served. However her reaction was a joke ""I guess they are too eager to clean the tables"" not even a sincere sorry came out of her mouth. This is a classic example of when business is going too well. People forget how to treat their customers."
Denzel A.,"Fremont, CA",27,5,,5.0,1/7/2016,"The food was pretty good.  The service was fast.  I came here on a Thursday evening during the weekday, it's usually pretty slow on the weekdays. When I come here I usually get a pizza and share with my friend or girlfriend. Today was no different, I ordered a chicken bacon ranch pizza was pretty good it's always covered in toppings no complaints here. Ended the meal with a peanut butter smores pazookies. The pazookies are the best!"
Brittany R.,"San Jose, CA",410,321,11,4.0,2/15/2015,"Disclaimer: I used to work at BJ's San Bruno and BJ's Concord so I have a good idea of what goes on behind the scenes at BJ's and the code of conduct for customer service. I like this location because the parking is so easy (usually, but right now there is construction going on FYI) and it's also not too big but not too small. The bar is the perfect size so that everyone in the bar area has a good seat to see the TVs.  I'm a big fan of BJ's food so the consistency here is definitely appreciated! Each time I get my favorites, they always taste as scrumptious as last time ;) Speaking of, my favorites are: Avocado Egg Rolls Baked Mac & Cheese Black & Bleu Burger Maui Glazed Pork Chop Shrimp Scampi Classic Combo Pizza"
Mark W.,"Berkeley, CA",0,11,1,5.0,4/27/2016,"Very delicious!!! We ordered Medium Great White Pizza, Caesar salad with Gluten free thin crust Pepproni pizza. The food was fresh and cooked to perfection! The pizza was still warm fresh out the oven, the salad was extremely mouthwatering with the crispy croutons! Lastly but certainly not least ""The Monkey bread pizzuki "" , It literally melts in your mouth. This pizzuki is out of the world and i will definately come back for this again. Even Tuesday seems to be busy night, but service was great and fast! Kishan "" you nailed it"".Great job!! I hope to see you again. I recommend alll the beer lovers to join Bj's Club. Trust me you will not be dissapointed."
Patricia G.,"Sunnyvale, CA",2,25,2,1.0,3/14/2017,"Service was unbelievably slow.  Place was full our dinner took 3 hours to complete.   Our waitress never came back for a second round of drinks, and yes...my single glass of beer did not last 3 hours.  This is how businesses go out of business, I hope management reads this and addresses.  The location is Cupertino is much better. I would not return to the Newark location based on this lack of service."
