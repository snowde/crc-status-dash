Michelle C.,"Fremont, CA",41,16,2,4.0,11/21/2015,"I've been coming to this BJ's since it opened and figured it's about time I write a review.  It's been our go-to place when we can't decide what to eat since they have an extensive menu with something for everyone and the food's pretty consistent.  My all time favorite has been the Ahi Tuna Salad... until recently.  They not only changed how they serve the salad (ex. diced avocado vs. slices), but they have also changed the quality of the Tuna.  It used to be nice and creamy sushi-grade tuna and now it has a steak-like texture with a blah flavor.  At first I thought they were just overcooking it, but the last time I ordered it (a few weeks ago) it was prepared perfectly, but still had the steak-like, grainy texture.  I used to rave to people that it's the best tuna salad anywhere and now I'm sad to say that I will not be ordering it again.   As for the service, it's always been pretty decent and expected for the type of place BJ's is, with a couple exceptions of course."
Kristina G.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,114,9,5.0,4/25/2017,"Came here Saturday night with two of my friends. Not familiar with the area so they drove us here. We asked for a booth and was given one, it was moderately busy so I'm surprised they accommodated our request. I had the jambalaya and my two friends had sirloin and rib eye. We also had beer, wings and the mushroom appetizers. We enjoyed our late dinner. Our server was a very nice young guy, we asked him if he could take a picture of us at the table and even though he was busy he still did it. We had a very nice time!"
Sara N.,"San Francisco, CA",273,418,985,3.0,2/18/2015,"I like that they could carry our bar tab over to our table.  They service was pretty stellar once we were seated, the bar service just plan sucked (we were at a table, not sitting at the bar).  The parking lot is 7 types of confusing and ill situated.   The beers are standard to that of all BJ's establishments, and their happy hour is always busy.  In fact, they are always busy at this location. We ordered for a table of 8, they made a mistake on one order and didn't charge for the item, which was nice.  The beers are always tasty, and your ability to see a tv at the bar from almost anywhere in the venue is a huge plus. Think BWW meets Maggianos with a hint of pizzookie and a smidge of Chili's."
Tameeka B.,"Oakland, CA",217,70,96,4.0,2/1/2016,"My friends and I frequent this place quite often. We are often in a large group and BJ's is always accommodating. The food isn't out of this world but when you want to go somewhere reliable, knowing that the dish you order will be on the better side of good and the price not too steep- you go to BJ's. Their pizza's are among my favorite. They used to have a mushroom balsamic glaze pizza that was the bees-knees! Unfortunately it was rotated off of the menu, I hope they bring it back. Also, if you haven't had a pizookie, you're missing out on one of the happier things in life haha!  Go to BJ's you won't be disappointed!  ***disclaimer: while they're known also for the beers they have on tap, I'm not a drinker so when I say that you won't be disappointed, I am strictly speaking on food and non-alcoholic beverages*** ...carry on..."
Sophia Y.,"Pleasanton, CA",222,264,736,4.0,12/28/2013,"The service and food here is 10 times better than what they serve at the BJs in Dublin.  Love the strawberry mojitos and cookies n cream pizookie! They also offer beer flights that are fun to try out. If you've never had their hand-crafted (unlimited refills) root beer, it is a must try! So smooth and vanilla-y, it'll make even a root-beer-hater a believer. The happy hour specials are the way to go. Calamari, avocado egg rolls and deep dish pizzas are my staples here. Sign up on their website to get a free pizookie on your birthday!"
Lin Z.,"Redwood City, CA",30,5,,1.0,3/4/2017,That was awful walked in at noon left at 1:30 no food and a horrible manager that didn't even apologize.  We watched all the tables around us get their food but we just had to sit and wait.  Finally got up and just left.  We will never go back there
Corrin J.,"Union City, CA",411,32,4,3.0,10/19/2015,"Everytime I come here the service is crazy slow, we tend to always make the mistake of sitting in the bar where there are never enough servers and the servers seem so overwhelmed. My first time coming in my server was a little bit of an older Hispanic guy with a green apron, didn't get his name but he completely didn't care about us. Took his time getting to us and unfortunately he's always in the bar. Must have thought we were young kids & bad tippers (WRONG) Shouldn't give bad service!  However this time I can say our server lance was very nice and polite, a little slow but overall super nice guy so we didn't mind. Food is always really good, I recommend the fries artichokes. They are surprisingly delicious! Overall food is pretty good about 4 star on that...  They just need to work on keeping up with the pace of the bar!"
Mario R.,"Oakland, CA",0,7,6,2.0,4/9/2017,"So my wife and I finally decided to tryout BJ's and unfortunately it was not a good experience. The wait was not bad being it was a Friday evening, we started off w/ appetizers which was calamari, and an order of a small bowl of pale ale chili w/ chips. The calamari came and I noticed the lemon had mold on the inside of the lemon wedges the waitress noticed me looking at it before I can snap a picture of it and asked if there was a problem I showed her the lemons and she apologized and got us a new order of calamari, the chili dip was not what I asked for and instead I was served a all cheese dip. I kept it to not make a big deal but our food came out rite after we had received our appetizers so I felt rushed to eat so the main course didn't get cold. The whole experience at BJ's unfortunately was not what I expected. We should have walked out after the moldy lemons I can only imagine what it looks like behind the kitchen if they're careless enough to send out obviously molded lemons imagine what goes on in the back."
Eric V.,"Los Angeles, CA",61,85,121,2.0,2/4/2016,"Service, service! It is horrible. This area is happy to have a restaurant of this caliber, but the waitresses have been horrible. Tonight I am dinning and Elizabeth is our server and she is no where to be found! We are trying to get water refills and drinks and have to wait for them. Why? Last night it was Andrea, and she was horrible. I would give my review full stars, because of the food. Just wait a couple of months till the get the staff down. You are not going to like the service. Trust me."
Rajbir R.,"Fremont, CA",36,113,27,2.0,12/6/2015,"Wow. I have been here quite a few times and the last time I dined, I was blown away... Blown away by one of the worst experiences I have EVER received at a restaurant. I ordered the new deep dish ziti, more like a layer of ziti. For $15 I paid for 6 tiny pieces of ziti which I finished in 3 minutes. Deep dish my... Host was average. Server did not check up on us at all. The food took FOREVER. My friend's parmesan chicken was good and filling. Ordered the trio of pizookies. Got burnt cookies in larger pans, which didn't make sense. I'm not going to continue ranting, but say that you guys need to work on your service and food. I will be back and hopefully I will receive better service and food than this past experience."
Brian N.,"Long Beach, CA",1,4,1,3.0,2/21/2016,Food overall was good but our Brussels sprouts appetizer was so burnt. It looked nothing like the ad. Get your greens some other way people. Picture posted elsewhere
Sabrina C.,"Hayward, CA",55,114,107,5.0,1/5/2016,"Lunch was perfect. Ordered a Gourmet 5 meat deep dish pizza. Always yummy. Ordered Spinach stuffed much rooms for the 1st time, loved them. I will go back just for those.  Our server was Isabella, I think it was spelled differently though. She was friendly and fast. Very sweet personality."
Mike R.,"Manhattan, NY",1,54,,1.0,10/27/2015,"In our search to find a couple drinks and some food after 10pm this was one of the only places open so we decided to give it a try. When we walked in at 10:30 and asked if they were still serving the hostess was happy to seat us.  our server came right over to take our order and things seemed fine. then we never got our drinks and the waitress was nowhere in sight. our food came, pizza was cold and didn't seem fresh. then when the waitress noticed our food on the table she decided to get our drinks and come check on us. food was bad, service was worse."
Jasmin H.,"San Francisco, CA",188,68,238,2.0,1/3/2016,"(Review is of my experience at the Newark branch only) In general, BJ's Restaurant is a decent franchise. People come here for the good food, beers on tap and the casual atmosphere. You can never go wrong with BJ's, which is why I am generously giving this branch two stars. I have been numerous times to other BJ's restaurants in east bay, and the Newark location is the branch that has given me the worst dining experience. On a weekday night (7PM) I came here with my sister who had a birthday reservation. Despite arriving on time, we were seated an hour and a half after our arrival. Mind me this is after several attempts of trying to get someone to assist us. The service here is awful. The restaurant was severely understaffed and the servers appeared overwhelmed, rude and inattentive the entire time. Our server even forgot two of our orders. Message to management: Please improve your service."
B. M. C.,"Fremont, CA",3,27,,1.0,11/20/2016,"This place has gone downhill in terms of service. Waited roughly 25 minutes for a couple salads that never came even though we told 3 different people we ordered two. After mentioning this to our waitress, she left and didn't return. Granted she was on break while we ordered from someone else first, but she stopped by when she came back from break and we asked for our salads from her. Ten more minutes later our entrees show up and Monique comes back to check on us. She asked if everything was ok. We said no, just cancel our salads. She said, ""salad? oh, what salad? The other waitress didn't know about a salad."" Uh.... we told you ourselves ten minutes ago so does it really matter that the breaker waitress didn't put it in the system?  We asked for more water and apparently that takes time as well. As bitchy was I was with my blank stares, she was lucky I've gotten better at controlling my hangry vocally. My husband was ready for the unleashing, though. Lol. Food was good as usual."
Jesenia C.,"Fremont, CA",0,14,7,5.0,3/9/2017,"Been here multiples times and can truly says Bj's is one of my favorite restaurants. Whether it's an intimate date night or you're coming in with all your coworkers at the end of the night Bj's has something to offer everyone. Bj's is one of those restaurants that was a wide ranging menu that will cater to everyone.      My personal favorite dish here is the seared Ahi salad (yum) if you order the seared ahi salad be sure you read all of the ingredients. The first time I ordered this salad I didn't really read the description fully and didn't realize the salad contained dollops of wasabi so I accidentally swallowed a giant dollop of wasabi thinking it was avocado lol it wasn't too bad but it definitely caught me off guard      A lot of people will complain about the wait but I really don't think it's that bad and I feel like everyone knows how bad the wait can be and it shouldn't be something that surprises you. The only real complaint I have is from the recent visit last Saturday, my date and I were sat at a regular table and this may not make sense to people who don't have tables that open up but the leaf of the table on my dates side kept unhinging and falling into his lap. However, this is the first time I've ever had a problem at Bj's and still highly recommend this restaurant."
Deborah C.,"Fremont, CA",57,31,3,1.0,1/23/2017,"I'm not feeling the staff or the customer service here at all! A few months ago I went here with friends. We parked next to some guy who was getting high and smoking a joint in the car next to us. It turned out that after we waited a long time to be seated, the guy who was getting high in the car ended up being our waiter! With that being said this dude could not remember anything we asked for, (more napkins, drink refills, silverware, the bill, etc)!!! Bad service. So the next time we tried this place, my husband and I went here around 4 pm. It wasn't very busy. The rude hostess who mever smiled or even acknowledged us demanded my phone number so she could text us when seating was available. Keep in mind there was plenty of seating available. So I did and asked how long was the wait. She said 15 minutes. I noticed several people who came in after us but they were seated immediately and we just sat there like idiots waiting for a text that of course we never received!!!  We walked out. I won't be back. Very rude hostesses who have no skills or training in basic customer service and they have high waiters who smoke weed in the parking lot before coming into work and then forget you're there! This to me is a direct reflection on their management. No one's in charge! No one's watching the store and the employees are allowed to run game on their customers without anyone calling them out on their rude and very unprofessional behavior! It's a nice looking restaurant with a good menu but it will fold soon because of the lack of management or just straight bad management. Pay attention to how they treat you when you first arrive. It sets the tone for your dining experience. We left and went to Sizzler instead!"
Christine S.,"San Francisco, CA",1117,1216,4637,4.0,8/31/2013,"When my coworker and I found out about their $5.95 lunch special (served at 11am-3pm), we just had to try it out! Every time we've been here, the service (whether it's a server or even the bartender) has been awesome! They seem so cheerful and happy to be helping you out.  We've tried a few things off the menu, and they were all tasty. The restaurant does get pretty busy, but we've been lucky to always grab a bar table. The wait for food is a bit longer than expected, so if you have a timed lunch, try to order as fast as you can!  Besides the lunch deal, they also have a good happy hour. The best deal for the happy hour is the half off pizza! Yum!"
Claire R.,"San Leandro, CA",0,6,,2.0,2/19/2017,"Our food took almost an hour to arrive even though we ordered the kids' food first and then the food had been under the warmer for a very long time. The kids' juices were huge and were the only thing to arrive promptly so we ended up with hyper hungry kids. We had to ask for silverware multiple times and the server took fifteen minutes to bring drinks and take the rest of the food order. It wasn't busy and there was no obvious explanation for the terrible service at 2pm on a Sunday afternoon. The food wasn't bad, but next time I'll eat somewhere else."
Sara H.,"San Leandro, CA",34,16,,2.0,8/7/2016,"The takeout here almost always goes wrong which I don't understand. When we eat in we usually have halfway decent service, maybe a little slow at times but decent. But every time we order takeout we end up with something wrong, missing, takes way long, or something. This time my husband went to pick up a small and simple order from using their app to order. Ordered an entree salad, kids corndog, and a half pizza half salad lunch. He went to pick it up at the time designated. it was not ready. He waited and when they brought it out they were missing the half side salad. He asked them to make it. It's a simple house side salad. He waited over 10 min for them to correct it. Now by the time he got back home we all had cold, soggy food for a very expensive price."
