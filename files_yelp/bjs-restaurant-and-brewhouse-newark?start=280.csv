mig l.,"Hayward, CA",0,2,,1.0,3/4/2017,Whats the point of ordering online and callng ahead to have to still wait in line... went threw all the prep for no reason. Not worth ordering online or calling ahead to be seated quickly... waste of time!!!
Arcie Marie D.,"San Mateo, CA",9,96,128,1.0,8/11/2014,"Back in the day, when BJs was a newer concept, they had major service issues. I feel as though they have made improvements since then, with the exception of the Newark location. I have NEVER had a good experience here. I don't know why I keep coming back expecting different.  I'm in the service industry, so I tend to be way forgiving when it comes to the wait staff. But when I leave this location upset every time, it's not a good look.  My first visit to this location, the manager had to comp the entire bill bc the food came out wrong. We're talking 0/4 orders correct. And cold. And I was never given my drink throughout my meal. Ever. Even after 3 requests.  My most recent visit was no different. Started off with a quote for a 40 min wait. For my husband and I and my infant. On a Sunday early evening. Okay. I guess we'll wait. Then the host asked which I needed for the baby, a booster, or a highchair. My baby's 3 months old. Tiny. So I explained to her that he doesn't sit on his own yet. So neither. (He was sitting in his stroller, not carseat, so I told her i didn't need a sling either) 55 min later, they realized they had skipped over us and said it would only be 10 min more. Oookay. 15 min later (so closing in on an hour and a half wait time. For 2 people) we were walked over to a high top table in the bar area.  First, that area is open seating, so if you were going to seat me there, was there a need to have me waiting for that long? And second, you're going to seat me a high top and expect me to pull up my stroller next to the table? So I'm going to tend to my baby sitting almost 2 ft higher then him? She agreed to get us a regular table. But of course we had to wait a little longer. 5 min later, she was ready to redirect us to our table and asked me to leave my stroller in the lobby. My now sleeping infant son was nestled in his stroller. So obvi I was confused. I explained to you he doesn't sit up on his own. And you can see I don't have him in his carseat and I explained that to you as well. So you're expecting me to pull him out and what, hold him the entire meal? To add insult to injury, she led me down some stairs. With my stroller. Really??  So we established the hostess had no clue what she was doing. But the food. C'mon!!  I ordered a water and a beer. Never receive my water. I ordered a sandwich. And thin fries. No substations. No special nada. Straight off the menu. Still wrong. Wrong sandwich. Wrong fries. My husbands too.  I paid too much money for that dinner to be leaving so unsatisfied..  I will definitely be avoiding this location in the future. Try Bridgepoint in San Mateo. I've had way better experiences at this location."
Pooja M.,"Manhattan, NY",467,228,918,4.0,7/24/2015,"The food at BJ's is just ok -- not spectacular but not bad either. The real star for me and the ONLY reason I keep coming back to BJ's is for their decadent, divine, and delicious Pizookie. A Pizookie, or ""pizza cookie,"" is a giant freshly baked cookie topped with ice cream, enough to share between 2-4 people. BJ's has several flavors of Pizookie, and my favorite used to be the Red Velvet Pizookie. However it has since been discontinued and for that I am truly disheartened, but I have found a new flavor to replace it. The Salted Caramel Pizookie is so absolutely yummy, and the sweetness from the caramel is balanced nicely by the salt. I highly highly recommend the Salted Caramel Pizookie from BJ's!"
Shelly F.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,7,,1.0,2/27/2017,"My Burger was good!  Cooked just as I ordered it, hot , fresh...  BUT the SERVICE was horrible and just because of that I will never go to this place again!   Our server Amber was great!  She was handling multiple large tables and it was very apparent that she needed some assistance.  Which I'm not sure WHY she wasn't partnered up with another server since there seemed to be several servers just standing around. Anyway, the large parties were pulling her in every direction, asking for this and that, fixing orders, getting water etc.  So our table asked to speak to the manager, NOT to complain about our server, but to ask if another server could help out and maybe provide better service.  Well I guess this was NOT a good night to ask for the manager because Brandy approached our table with a horrible attitude.  Assuming she was stressed from multiple complaint, just from what I saw (but that's your job right?) We began to ask if there was another server that could help and explained what was going on, she basically ignored everything we said, proceeded to tell us that this wasn't what was going on and so WHAT COULD SHE DO FOR US?  We said get our server some help. Her response was ""well I don't serve, I can't help her and I don't want to argue about it""  Who's arguing lady?!?!?!  Uhmmmmmmm you're the manager, you should be willing to do whatever needs to be done.  Anyway this went on, the service didn't get any better and she basically just stayed away from the large party section so she didn't have to deal with EVERYONE in that section complaining. As a ""Manager"" there was a better way to resolve this issue and make everyone happy.  But, I guess Brandy was just not in the mood to do her job!  The entire experience sucked."
Michelle M.,"San Jose, CA",516,550,2836,3.0,5/9/2015,GET THERE: Parking lot is big. Inside is big. Bar area and lots of seating throughout the restaurant. Warehouse type feel.  FOOD: Food is eh. All their food reminds me of bar appetizer type food even their entrees like it was all frozen and they heat it up. Nothing special about their food.  STAFF: Our server who took care of our party of nearly 20 people did a great job he was attentive and my pizza came out really fast. He was quick to get what the kids asked for such as refilling their drinks.
Mary D.,"Fremont, CA",50,28,,2.0,2/23/2017,"Dissappointed the last time I came in.  Ordered chicken wings, looked more like pigeon wings and still ended paying the $11, should have sent them back.  Except the restaurant was vey busy that night, and our server mentioned that there were issues in the kitchen.  Orders were either coming out to slow or not at all.  The Tavern pizza was a plus, and the Santa Fe salad was good."
AJ B.,"Alameda, CA",2,23,18,2.0,8/17/2015,"Worst service ever. The food took waaaaaaaaay too long to get here, even though the restaurant wasn't packed. They didn't take our plates when we finished our food. Our dessert took about an hour and a half to come. The reason for that extra 30 mins is that the food runner gave our dessert to another table by accident. Originally I put one star, but it's now two stars because they realized their mistake. They took off some money off of our bill and we got our trio and they made one of the pizookies a large size."
Tamara W.,"Union City, CA",0,47,4,2.0,1/11/2016,"This place has lost it pizzazz!! They have overhauled the menu and it seems like all the dishes my family likes are no longer in existence.  We went on 01/02/16 around 4 and was seated right away, it was not at all that busy. After sitting in our booth for 15 minutes we had to flag down someone and ask if our waitress could be sent over. After 10 more minutes just as we start to stand up to leave she finally appears. By then we knew what we wanted to order, forget getting the drinks and coming back!! We gave her our order which included side salads and soup. Someone else dropped the side salads and soup off and rushed off so quickly, we couldn't tell them we had no utensils. I finally got up and walked to the hostess stand and asked them for napkins and utensils. Just as we started eating those items our food came out. So now we have everything at once. On the menu the fish and chips state that it comes with tartar and vinegar, our plate did not have it. We flagged another waiter down and asked for some ""oh did you want some?"" Ah yeah, it comes with the dish so why wouldn't we want it? Half that meal was ate by the time we saw those two items. I started to eat my chicken which the breading was over cooked and hardly had any lemon sauce, it was luke warm while the mashed potatoes were cold.  Even after getting our meal our server did not stop by to check in on us. She walked by and we watched her fawn all over several other tables that were all seated after us. We did not receive a refill on our beverages and in the end had to ask someone else to get our check after sitting there for awhile. Our waitress brought over the check and then wanted to know how things were. When we said we were never offered refills she asked if she could get us any, ""I'm leaving now chick!!"" She then wanted to know how everything was. Told her all our issues with our food and with her and not to expect a tip. And that is exactly what happened, no tip. I could see if it was busy but it was not at all.  The place is no longer worth the hype. I will head over to Union Landing or Pacific Commons. It'll be interesting to see what happens when all the new restaurants open at the mall later this year."
Hoa T.,"San Francisco, CA",5,111,30,4.0,11/5/2015,"We came here on a Wednesday night around 5pm. It wasn't crowded, it got crowded like 7p.m. our waiter was very nice she kept checking on us, seeing if we needed anything or order because we were still waiting for our friend. The service was great .   We order avocado egg rolls ( they were delicious.) Deep dish sweet pig and combination( the deep dish was just okie.) Root beer wings ( I would definitely order that again, juicy,tender, and very flavorful taste like root beer.) Asian chicke salad( you can't go wrong with salad.)  Overall try what is new on the menu."
Shawn B.,"Fremont, CA",0,6,,1.0,2/18/2017,"We  went to BJ's restaurant in Newark California  for dinner we waited about 45 minutes for our food,  our dinner came out stone-cold - our server took it back and we waited a little bit for our food - never came back we walked out - what a joke never going back!!!!"
Richard S.,"Hayward, CA",0,4,,4.0,8/5/2016,Yummy bison burger and tatonka stout.  My wife had the Mahi and shrimp.  We had the Salted caramel pazookie for dessert.  K- our waiter was excellent.  We used the super easy app and I got some rewards points.  They are always super nice here.  Our menus were sticky. Everyone seems like they are teens who works there.
Frank T.,"Oakland, CA",43,383,212,4.0,9/24/2014,"Just had a lunch here.  Had the honey crunch chicken salad and the clam chowder for an extra dollar. The chowder was excellent.  I'm pretty snobby about CC, and this had a lot of fresh clams i.e. not chewy.  The flavor was perfect, not too thick and just the right amount of cream.  I would order this again in a flash. The salad was equally as good.  Crunchy chicken breast over chopped salad of corn, almonds, lettuce hard boiled eggs, carrots.  A wonderful salad. Service was exceptional."
Elizabeth J.,"San Francisco, CA",582,621,707,4.0,10/24/2014,"Huge tv screens all over the place. Awesome spot to watch any sporing event.  Awesome lunch specials, Unlimited Soup & Salad combos.   Great spot for lunch.  Will def come back.  Fast service, food came out very quickly."
Brian T.,"San Jose, CA",264,24,3,1.0,7/21/2015,"I went here twice now and now I know to never come back. Both times the server took 15 minutes just to check on us for our orders and on top of that about 40 minutes to get our food. It gets worst after receiving our food, our server Jesse, never checked up on us. We had to flag someone else down to find someone to find him who was just chatting up another table and this is about an hour after finishing our food. Worst service ever. definitely going to the Cupertino one instead. Update 9/13/16: Never heard back from their manager after an offer for the bad experience"
Rosa K.,"Fremont, CA",17,21,15,4.0,6/21/2016,Came here for lunch on a tuesday it was packed!  ordered the lunch special: grilled cheese with avocado and tomatoes and skinny fries. the food came out quick and it was delicious!
Gaea T.,"Union City, CA",0,150,24,3.0,6/18/2015,"Good food, but the service needs huge improvement. I never went to a restaurant where the appetizers arrived before the drinks. The waitress was very apologetic saying that there is only one bartender on call at that time, and that he was very busy behind the bar. Please! The bartender didn't seem to be busy at all, and if that was genuinely the case, why have only one bartender on call for dinner? In addition, he needs to improve his bartending skills; our cocktails tasted more like water than alcohol. Not impressed!"
Clint J.,"Fremont, CA",35,24,1,1.0,8/14/2015,"Wanted to go out for a Friday dinner with my wife, only to have one of the poorest restaurant experiences ever. Ordered a Santa Fe salad with blackened salmon - it came without salmon and had cubed chicken in it. Sent it back. Came back with the same salad, and salmon on top. Later discovered a golf ball sized clump of tortilla chips in the center of the salad. Ordered a pizookie and it came completely raw. Called over the manager and complained and he apologized and changed our check to $0. Sweet, right? Wrong. He said his ""executive chef"" would personally make us a new one, for free. Brought it home to-go because we were quite mad by this point. Just opened it and it is completely burnt to a crisp and inedible. What. In. The. Heck. BJ's, you USED TO BE one of our favorite places to go. Now you will be at the end of our list of choices when everything else is not an option."
Javier P.,"San Leandro, CA",290,501,1782,3.0,5/8/2013,"I've been here 3 times already. The first time I came with my food buddy. She had told me that if we called ahead we could make a reservation. being that it was a Tuesday night I didn't think it would be busy. So we walked in and it was PACKED. We asked for a table for two. Our wait was going to be 25 minutes. In reality it turned out to be 35 minutes.  As we're waiting for our table I asked for a menu. The way I see it is that if you're going to be waiting 35 minutes minus well get a head start by looking at the menu, right? I do this at every restaurant :) Once we decided  on what we wanted we wrote it on a piece of paper. When we got our table and our server introduced herself. We handed her the paper where we wrote our order.  By doing so we sped up the process of getting our food.  As always we ordered the avocado egg rolls for our appetizer. 1st time here I ordered the California Chicken Sandwich. The grilled chicken was so juicy and tender. In other words it was well made. Well stuffed with avocado with pepper jack cheese, ranch dressing, chipotle mayo and roster chili peppers. I forgot what kind of bread it came with lol   2nd time  I ordered the BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad. It had green onions, tomatoes, black beans, jicama, corn and bbq dressing, mozzarella cheese and crispy onion strings. I didn't like this dish much. Mostly because it had more lettuce than anything else and it didn't have much chicken. I wasn't going to pay extra for extra chicken. 3rd time I ordered the Crispy Jalapeño Burger. With 1/2 pound of angus beef, cilantro, lettuce, tomato, pepper jack cheese, red onions, baja sauce, chipotle mayo and fried jalapeño peppers made this one SPICY burger.  I must of had the spicy batch of jalapeño peppers that day. I kept asking for water lol I don't have a favorite dish, yet. I'm satisfied just by ordering the avocado egg rolls as my main dish. It fills you up and every bite has avocado  and has the right amount of spiciness.  One thing that bothers me is why the appetizers take FOREVER. 15 to 20 minutes. I don't know if they're always short handed in the kitchen or if they make the appetizers from scratch. If they do then that explains why it takes time. Nice restaurant to hang out with friends."
Jennifer R.,"Union City, CA",51,33,975,2.0,4/30/2015,I've been to BJ'S a few times & each time i ordered something different & i don't like it lol. They are over priced & the food isn't that great. Today i had the deep dish baked lasagna. $15 what a rip off lol. Definitely wasn't worth the price. I only ate half of it. The pizza is the only thing thats worth eating from this restaurant.
Michelle B.,"Oakland, CA",762,362,450,2.0,4/10/2015,"The wait time is punishment enough.  I just don't understand the everlasting wait time for food especially when traveling with hungry and cranky tweens.  It will drive just any parent ape-shit crazy.  Why is it that the hungriest gets their order last or wrong?  Do they have a radar for ""lets pick out the crankiest and push them to their limit?""   Oddly enough the tweens enjoy it here - is it the feeling of being in a cavernous brewery, situated with grown folk? could it be the food?  Perhaps it is the pizookie?! I used to enjoy BJ's spaghetti with meat sauce.  They got cheap and caught on, instead it's just marinara and you are forced to add-on meatballs.  WTF BJ's, you suck meat balls! I don't fucking know.  If it were up to me I'd go elsewhere. Note*  use of itensifier such as the eff word, suck, ape-shit crazy and WTF are deliberate!"
